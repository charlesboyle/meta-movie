00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,895
[Buzzing]
[Door Opens]

2
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:28,472
I gotta say, it's a little strange having you
two show up at our doorstep like this.

3
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,410
[Grace] Okay, okay. So then he says,
[Joel] Tell him about the--

4
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:35,412
as if he's reliving some memory,
The lust part.

5
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:40,451
- The part about the lust.
- Looking at our priest, and he's looking out the window,

6
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:41,952
as if remembering
something long ago,

7
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,455
says, "Of course, everyone
can lust at first sight."

8
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:47,424
- "Lust at first sight."
- "Of course everyone can lust at first sight."

9
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:48,626
Priest says it?
[Grace] Yeah.

10
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,227
Father--
Father Whatever says,

11
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:52,429
"Of course everyone can have
physical reactions."

12
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:53,998
No, he doesn't.
[Carlo] Yes, he did.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,033
- "Everyone will gape at a white neck."
- He said--

14
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,501
But he said milky.
Wha-- Fine.

15
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:59,370
- Fine "A milky white neck."
- He didn't say white.

16
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:01,105
- He said milky.
- "A milky neck."

17
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:03,173
"The-The gape of a milky neck.

18
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:07,044
- A beautiful lock of hair. The pink of warm flesh."
- No!

19
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:08,312
[All Exclaim]

20
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,648
- We said, "Whoa!"
- Pink?

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,549
- I mean, and we're stunned.
- We were stunned.

22
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,984
- Stunned.
- [All Laugh]

23
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,854
- So Carlo offered him our firstborn.
- Oh, here we go.

24
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:19,223
Did you or didn't you?
I had to sign this piece of paper--

25
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:20,858
Carlo had to vow...

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,994
that he would do everything in his
power to raise his kids Catholic.

27
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:25,562
The paper said ours.
Did it?

28
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:28,098
Yes. It did.
[Scoffs]

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,933
It was just a paper.
It was our spine.

30
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:33,203
It was just a piece of paper.
[Waiter] Whenever you're ready.

31
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:34,672
Oh, thanks.
Hope everything was all right.

32
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:36,774
- [Joel] I got it, I got it.
- Okay. All right.

33
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,809
[Carlo] Well, thank you,
Mr. Money Bags.

34
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:41,612
You are too kind.
[Joel] Best of the Midwest, my friends.

35
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:43,380
You are too kind.
Thanks, guys.

36
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:09,740
[Carlo] Yes, yes.
[Grace] It's all fun until--

37
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:12,576
[Carlo] Leave it to the recovering
Catholic to make things difficult.

38
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,244
[Grace]
Ex-catholic, not recovering.

39
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:16,580
You can't talk about religion in front of someone.
It gets weird...

40
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:18,749
when you talk about religion
and all things holy--

41
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:22,386
[Grace] He asked us, "You two were raised Catholic.
Why not get married in a church?"

42
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:25,089
- And suddenly, he gets very paternal.
- He didn't get paternal.

43
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:28,859
- [Carlo] He was supposed--
- Yes, he did. "Don't you believe in God, young lady?"

44
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:32,029
And I say, "Well, of course,
Father Whatever. Of course I believe in God.

45
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,765
It's not that I don't believe in him.
It's just that he's become impossible.

46
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:38,802
[Carlo Laughing] She said this to a priest,
in that little office!

47
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:41,004
[Grace] I should have whipped out
my diaphragm right on his desk.

48
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:43,841
[Carlo] Well,
that would have been really classy.

49
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:46,377
What are you two smirking about?
You both were raised Catholic.

50
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,279
The only thing Catholic left in me
is my love of the Sistine Chapel.

51
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:51,949
- [Grace] Well, the priest was sweet.
- He got loaded.

52
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:57,020
[Carlo] I guess they have just as
much to stress about as the rest of us.

53
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:59,390
[Grace] He was a very sweet drunk.
I even danced with him.

54
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:00,858
[Joel] He danced?
[Carlo] Yes.

55
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,493
[Sharyl]
Did he lick your milky neck?

56
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:04,261
[Grace]
He put his hands on my hips.

57
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:05,729
My mother couldn't
believe her eyes.

58
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:07,765
[Grace] Your mother laughed.
Your mother danced with him.

59
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,501
[Joel] Liddy?
Liddy did not dance with the priest, did she?

60
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:12,936
<i>[Carlo] No, no, no. No.
Her mother danced with the priest.</i>

61
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:15,172
Yeah, but my mother would,
wouldn't she? [Joel] She would.

62
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:18,108
[Carlo] My mother did not dance with the-- Did she?

63
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,044
Oh!
That's revolting!

64
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:25,682
This sweaty, baldy priest dancing with
all these 20-something bridesmaids.

65
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:28,786
Come on. I'm sweaty and balding, and I would
love to dance with 20-something bridesmaids.

66
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:30,254
[Carlo] Ah.
[Sharyl] That's nothing new, sweetheart.

67
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:32,055
[Carlo] You're balding? Where?
Where are you balding?

68
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:34,124
[Joel] Where?
Where does everybody go bald?

69
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,793
- Let me see. Show me.
- Oh, Jesus.

70
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:38,162
- Ooh! Look at that!
- [Joel] Ooh!

71
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:41,198
[Carlo] It's over for you.
Yeah, it's been over for me for years. Just ask her.

72
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,435
- [Sharyl] Oh, Joel.
- Reminds me of it every night before we go to bed.

73
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:47,137
[No Audible Dialogue]

74
00:03:56,748 --> 00:04:00,517
[Carlo] The show in Denver was great.
It was great. Thanks.

75
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,619
I'm just glad we were able
to make this layover work.

76
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,355
Oh, my God.
[Chuckles]

77
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:07,991
Wow, this is a long way from your place in the Village.
Baby!

78
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,394
[Girl] Hi! [Sharyl] Hello, sweetie.
How was he?

79
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:13,063
[Conversation Continues,
Indistinct]

80
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:16,333
[Sharyl]
Here. I gave you a little extra.

81
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:19,736
[Grace] That's the going rate?
Jesus, it pays not to leave the house.

82
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,140
Say hi to your boyfriend for me.
Oh, I will.

83
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:25,609
[Girl] Have a good night.
[Sharyl] Thank you.

84
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:29,480
Are you, uh--
You okay?

85
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:31,215
Oh, man, are you kidding?
Come on.

86
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:34,017
This is the best day I've had in months.
You're here.

87
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,721
Hey, hey, hey!
Speaking of drunk, balding men,

88
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:42,292
this one is about to make a toast.
Oh, no. Please.

89
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:43,927
Sharyl.
Come on.

90
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:47,231
All right.
To the two of you...

91
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:50,567
- Thanks, Carlo.
- and your wedding.

92
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,736
We're sorry
to have missed it.

93
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:55,772
Grad school.
Such dreams.

94
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:58,675
Now look at us. Settled down,
starting families.

95
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:01,411
It's like we're, uh,

96
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,113
different people, um--

97
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:05,716
Oh, Joel,
don't be such a drunk ham. Ha!

98
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:07,518
[Carlo, Sharyl Laugh]

99
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,686
Okay, anyway--

100
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:12,055
To Carlo and Grace,
to the two of you.

101
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:15,893
To love, success, fortune!
We love you!

102
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:19,263
We think you're the best. We really,
really do. Thank you, guys.

103
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,598
[Sharyl] Cheers.
Mmm. Mmm.

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,101
- Look at that. I love it.
- [Joel] Yeah.

105
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:25,669
[Carlo]
Check this out.

106
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:28,372
Hey, how many inches is this thing?
[Laughs]

107
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:30,040
Let me
show you something.

108
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,942
It's like my wing span.

109
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:34,811
- Come on, man. Easy. Easy. Put that away.
- Yeah.

110
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:37,147
Wi-Fi. Instantaneous.
Clients love it.

111
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:38,649
Boys with
their toys.

112
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:40,751
[Carlo]
Ha.

113
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:43,620
<i>How are your photos coming?</i>

114
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:45,355
- Uh, good.
- Hmm?

115
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:47,190
Really good, actually.
Great.

116
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:48,559
Wow.
[Laughs]

117
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:50,093
That's great.

118
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,396
Yeah.
I have two exhibits this year.

119
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:53,931
Really? Where?
Mm-hmm.

120
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,668
Blott Gallery
and Hasselbanks.

121
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:01,305
- Hasselbanks?
- Yeah, I know. Right?

122
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:03,907
You should see what else they have
lined up at Hasselbanks in the spring.

123
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,311
The Romario. The Romario retrospective.
You know his work?

124
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:11,748
I can't believe that my face is gonna
be on the same brochure as Romario.

125
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,084
- Wow.
- I'm gonna be hanging out with him.

126
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:16,620
It's been a whirlwind.
Wow. Really?

127
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:18,388
Well, hey,
you deserve it.

128
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,892
[Laughs]
You know who's helped me out?

129
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:24,227
Del Piero.

130
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,197
- I haven't thought about that guy in ages. I hated him.
- Come on, man.

131
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,133
The only reason you hated him was
because he didn't like your work.

132
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:33,370
Yeah, well, he loved your work,
didn't he? He did.

133
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:35,072
His agent picked me up.

134
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:36,540
[Joel] Wow.
[Carlo] Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,475
Jesus.
You're in the big time.

136
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:41,311
Hey! That's me.

137
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,947
Yeah, Joel inserted some of his old grad school shots,

138
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,083
so his clients still think
he's cutting edge.

139
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:48,752
College tuition.
Forty bucks an hour.

140
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:51,755
Oh, Jesus. Prints.
Fingerprints. Sorry.

141
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:54,458
[Groans] Grace,
are you still managing the restaurant?

142
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,660
Uh-huh. Hopefully
not much longer.

143
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:58,595
I think I wanna
go back to school.

144
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:00,797
- Oh, really? In what?
- Probably social work.

145
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:02,499
Ah, that's honorable.
Yeah. [Sharyl] Wow.

146
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:06,236
Yeah, a social worker with an art photographer.
Debtors' prison awaits.

147
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:09,640
- [Joel] Well, there are worse places to end up.
- [Grace] We'll see.

148
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:14,111
- I, uh-- I didn't know you were
interested in social work. - I am.

149
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:18,048
- But didn't you do communications in undergrad?
- That was a joke degree.

150
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,517
Gracie, I told you not to do that.
[Sharyl] Come on now, Grace.

151
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,021
No, seriously. What?
You guys got real degrees at real schools.

152
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,256
- I hate when you speak like that.
- Dartmouth, Wesleyan, Cornell.

153
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:32,162
<i>Grace, if it's any consolation,
I learned my worst habits at Dartmouth.</i>

154

[Chuckles Softly]

155
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:36,199
Sounds great.
It's all great.

156
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,335
I think it's a good time for us.
Yeah.

157
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:41,338
Just beware of giving social services with those legs.

158
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,542
[Chuckles] Don't you worry.
I'm gonna have her wear slacks. Woolen and baggy.

159
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:48,912
Right? Whatever I wear,
I probably won't look attractive.

160
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:51,114
- What, are you--
- No, no. [Chuckles]

161
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:52,749
But... maybe.

162
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:54,384
[Joel] Oh, shit! Babies?
While I go back to school.

163
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,386
It's just speculation.
[Sharyl] Are you trying?

164
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,188
<i>We're not not trying.</i>

165
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,956
- Remember when we used to do that?
- Excuse me?

166
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,625
Remember when we, uh--
When we what?

167
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:04,728
<i>When we speculated.</i>

168
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,464
[Clears Throat]
And you, Sharyl?

169
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,235
Sharyl?
Working or-- Me? What?

170
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,037
Are you working or--

171
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,339
No, I'm with
the baby for now.

172
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,075
Are you enjoying it?

173
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,911
Mmm.
Love it.

174
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:23,647
Well, uh, good.
That's good.

175
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:25,549
Oh.
[Baby Crying]

176
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:27,951
Ooh. Sorry.

177
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:30,020
I'll be right back.
[Baby Continues Crying]

178
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:31,922
Give him the, uh,
Chubby Snubby.

179
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:34,891
- It's a brown bear. He loves it. [Chuckles]
- [Sharyl] I know he loves it.

180
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:37,027
I was talking to them.
[Sharyl] What?

181
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,029
- I was talking to them!
- [Sharyl] What? I can't hear you!

182
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:42,733
<i>- [Shouting] I was talking to them!
- [Grace Laughs]</i>

183
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:44,267
[Chuckles]
Sorry.

184
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:47,771
<i>[Sharyl] I introduced the Chubby Snubby to him.</i>

185
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:51,341
<i>- No! I bought it, actually.
- You bought it and threw it at him.</i>

186
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:53,744
[Sharyl] I've actually played with him with the bear.
Are they being serious?

187
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,345
And besides, Joel--

188
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:02,953
Chubby Snubby is dead.

189
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:12,062
[Imitates Choking]

190
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,464
[Phone Ringing]

191
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,634
Eh. He'll cry
himself to sleep.

192
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:20,237
[Ringing Continues]

193
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:25,308
[Beeps] Ah, mom-in-law. Yay!

194
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,344
Hello.
[Joel] What exactly did you mean by that?

195
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:30,013
We just have some friends over.
Excuse me. What-What do you mean?

196
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,915
No, of course we're not bothered.
Is he dead? Since when?

197
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,950
Shh.
Since when--

198
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:35,952
Since when is he dead?
I do have to go, Mom.

199
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:39,823
Joel, easy, easy.
I think this dead teddy bear thing is really upsetting you.

200
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,625
<i>Take the phone.
Sharyl?</i>

201
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:43,493
You killed his Chubby Snubby?
Huh? Yes.

202
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:47,531
<i>I ate his Chubby Snubby.
Now take the phone. [Mom Chattering]</i>

203
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:51,635
What? No, the Chubby Snubby.
The one with the bow in its hair.

204
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:54,938
We took the bear to the Salvation Army, Mom.
We said bye-bye to it.

205
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,507
- The Chubby Snubby was fine.
- You had a Chubby Snubby.

206
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:59,142
No, what was the thing called?

207
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:01,545
What was the thing called, Mom?
It was a--

208
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:03,013
"Bing Bing."
Right. Yes.

209
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:05,182
- Bing Bing!
- Bing Bing.

210
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,784
It had a little bell.
Ask her if she still has Bing Bing somewhere.

211
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:10,120
Wait. Shh, shh, shh.
We made the name up, Mom. Sharyl. Sharyl.

212
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:12,823
Ask her if she still has Bing Bing.
Can I talk?

213
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:14,558
Ask if she still has Bing Bing somewhere.
Shh!

214
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,059
Ask. Ask her.

215
00:10:16,061 --> 00:10:18,361
Do you still have his
Bing Bing somewhere?

216
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:20,230
Did you have
a Bing Bing?

217
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:24,301
Of course she still has
your Bing-- Oh! What?

218
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,736
What? I shouldn't have
thrown the Chubby Snubby out?

219
00:10:26,738 --> 00:10:28,471
Well, thank you,
Mom!

220
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:32,108
- Will you deal with her?
- I don't feel like talking to Mom.

221
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,945
[Phone Thuds,
Slides On Floor]

222
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:36,913
[Joel]
Okay.

223
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,951
<i>[Mom On Phone]
Sharyl?</i>

224
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,822
<i>[Mom Chattering,
Indistinct]</i>

225
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:50,627
Hi, Mom. Yeah, um, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you back?

226
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,929
Thanks. Bye.
[Beeps]

227
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:56,867
[Voice Breaking] So you killed his Chubby Snubby?

228
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,336
[Sharyl] Shut up with the goddamn Chubby Snubby.

229
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,339
Shut up!

230
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:22,926
[Grace] I gotta say,
it's a little strange...

231
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:25,862
having you two show up
at our doorstep like this.

232
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:28,431
[Sharyl] We didn't plan on dropping in like this.
[Joel] It was short notice.

233
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,467
[Grace] I would've prepared something.
[Joel] No, no, no.

234
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:33,570
We came to New York on this, uh,
romantic weekend. [Sharyl] On impulse.

235
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:35,405
[Joel] Yeah, on impulse.
We do that a lot nowadays.

236
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:37,274
We travel on impulse.
[Grace] That must be nice.

237
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:39,910
[Joel] See some shows.
Visit old restaurants.

238
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:44,014
[Joel] Yes! At Le Fou. We ate there.
[Sharyl] We thought of you.

239
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:48,718
[Joel] Yeah, yeah. We thought, you know?
It was so delicious. [Sharyl] We just, you know--

240
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,187
Dropped in and--
Dropped in.

241
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:52,989
Right.
[Chuckles] [Joel] Yeah.

242
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:55,792
Whoa. Come in, please.
Thank you.

243
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:57,661
[Carlo]
Have a seat.

244
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:02,899
We thought you guys wouldn't see us,
but-- Uh--

245
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:04,434
[Carlo Clears Throat]

246
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:06,970
We wanted to make things
better between us.

247
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:09,506
We didn't get a Christmas card
from you the last couple of years,

248
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:12,342
and you really haven't returned any of my calls.
I know.

249
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:15,011
And this is the only way
we could get to see you.

250
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:20,383
Okay, we won't
overstay our welcome.

251
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,886
No, no, no. Please.
No, stay as long as you need.

252
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:24,487
- You can sleep over.
- What?

253
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:29,359
No.
We have-- We have a hotel room that's great.

254
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:32,295
Kind of amazing hotel room.
We're sort of dying to get back to it.

255
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:34,931
- [Carlo] Oh. Okay.
- [Sharyl Sighs]

256
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,967
What is, uh--
What's with the cane?

257
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:38,501
What is--
Is this Mr. Peanut?

258
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:42,605
[Chuckles] Uh, no.
I broke my leg. But it's better.

259
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:44,040
It's getting better.
Good.

260
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,976
[Carlo]
Good.

261
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:49,212
It's great to see you guys.
[Clears Throat]

262
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:51,414
Is it?
[Chuckles Nervously]

263
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:56,086
- I mean, you'd think after last time.
- Come on. We all have our days.

264
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:58,088
- Right?
- Things are--

265
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,390
[Door Buzzer Buzzes]
Things are better.

266
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:02,058
They are.

267
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,162
[Buzzer Buzzes]
Ooh.

268
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:07,998
We ordered--
No, please.

269
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,935
We ordered some milk shakes.
Sit down. Sit down. Put your cane back.

270
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:14,904
[Carlo] Excuse me.
[Door Release Buzzes]

271
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:18,508
- [Horn Honks]
- Is that your limo out there?

272
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,076
Oh, it's a town car.

273
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,912
With a driver inside?

274
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:26,950
It's a glorified cab really.
We've-We've been out all day. It's just so much easier.

275
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:30,253
He's just sitting there,
waiting for you.

276
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:33,323
You want me to invite him up?

277
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:37,293
Okay.
Sorry about that.

278
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,429
Uh, here, why don't
you guys take these.

279
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,331
[Joel Chuckles]
No, no, no.

280
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,733
[Joel] We should avoid-- No!
[Sharyl] We can't--

281
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,201
I insist.
[Joel] Okay.

282
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:48,371
Oh. I gotta get you guys some straws.
Thank you.

283
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,040
Excuse me, baby.

284
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,208
How much did you tip the guy?
Uh, enough.

285
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,445
Here you go. One for you.
One for you. [Joel Chuckling]

286
00:13:55,447 --> 00:14:00,283
- The change.
- Uh-- She's just upset that I gave you guys our shakes.

287
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:03,219
[Grace] The change.
It's two milk shakes, baby.

288
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,389
Fifty cents? Not a tip.
I rounded up to the dollar.

289
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:09,426
- It's embarrassing.
- What am I supposed to do? Tip 30 %?

290
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,327
Why be stingy over some milk shakes?
Stingy?

291
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:14,330
Would you stop her, please?
It's kind of funny, so--

292
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:17,167
Wait, look, he--
I'm glad we're entertaining you.

293
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:18,868
The poor guy
makes no salary.

294
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,604
He's probably an undocumented worker.
Poor guy? Whoa!

295
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:24,274
- Look outside. It's 90 degrees. It's like--
- Hey, easy. Shh.

296
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:26,609
Don't shush me!
It's sweltering. Shh.

297
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:29,312
For your milk shakes.
And you tip him some change. Okay, okay.

298
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:32,215
How about, I'm gonna call him back then.
Call him back, what?

299
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:35,385
I will call him back
and order two more milk shakes.

300
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:39,522
And tip him 20 dollars, okay?
How about that?

301
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,324
[Carlo Sighs] Wow.
No, no, no.

302
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:43,359
Excuse me.
No, uh-uh. No, no!

303
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:47,163
Hi, this is--
Yes, 605 West 38th Street.

304
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:52,368
Hello? Yes, we would like two more milk shakes, please.
Yes, two--

305
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,572
Okay. Thank you very much.

306
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:58,141
All right?
Now will you stop? [Beeps]

307
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:00,543
[Grace]
What a little boy.

308
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:09,819
I cannot believe that you guys
are here right now.

309
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:12,655
- It's tripping me out. - Can you imagine
what these two must think they're in for?

310
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:15,825
- The next apocalypse.
- Well, to be honest--

311
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,494
No, I'm mean,
we're no saints.

312
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,696
We said we would never
see you again.

313
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,601
[Laughs]

314
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:29,339
Well, didn't we?
[Carlo] That's my Gracie.

315
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:31,407
We came here tonight...

316
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:36,980
[Sighs] to apologize.
Yeah.

317
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:39,549
We-- We behaved--

318
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,518
Horribly.

319
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,453
Yeah, you did.

320
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:47,857
We never planned
for it to--

321
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,926
for that to happen.
Look--

322
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:53,930
Please let me finish. We didn't want or
plan for it to go the way it did that night.

323
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:56,599
- Stop, stop. You guys are our oldest friends.
- We're just really sorry.

324
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,334
Really sorry.
We're really sorry.

325
00:15:58,336 --> 00:15:59,802
Yeah.

326
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:07,377
The shakes are delicious.
Yeah.

327
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:09,112
They're good. Yeah, yeah.
[Carlo] Yeah. Yeah.

328
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:11,247
- We like 'em.
- We order them a lot.

329
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:12,749
[Carlo]
We do.

330
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:15,351
We heard from Lucy and Mark
that you had a little baby.

331
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:18,855
- [Carlo] Yes. Yeah.
- Yes. We just put him down.

332
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:21,057
[Carlo]
How's your little boy?

333
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,725
- Forgive me. Li-Linus?
- Lucien.

334
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:25,828
- Lucien. Lucien.
- Yeah. He's good. He's good. He's, uh--

335
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,764
He's gettin' to be less and less of a baby though.

336
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:30,700
- He's getting big, huh?
- Yes. He's ginormous.

337
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:33,303
He, uh-- He's with his
grandparents this week.

338
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:36,272
We're very happy, mind you.
We finally had him baptized.

339
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:38,775
You did?
Yep.

340
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:42,412
We broke down. We felt
he needed to be, uh--

341
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:44,747
I don't know.
What was the word that we-- Anchored.

342
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:48,418
"Anchored" is the word that we used.
[Chuckles]

343
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:52,755
Um-- But, you know,
grandparents were in tears.

344
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:56,025
It was flowers and photos and happiness.
It was really quite moving.

345
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,194
[Carlo] Right.
Yeah.

346
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:01,698
And now you're, uh--
you're anchored?

347
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,968
Yeah, we even go to church
periodically. Don't we?

348
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,937
[Laughs]
No, you don't.

349
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:10,940
You do?

350
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:14,544
About a month after
we saw you guys,

351
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:17,113
I was working in
that guest room upstairs,

352
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:21,417
and I was finishing up
the drywall.

353
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:30,093

[Shouts]
Sharyl!

357
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:42,538
I wound up in the living room for
about six months on that pullout bed,

358
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,341
because I couldn't make it
up and down the stairs.

359
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,578
I was living in filth
and I was drinking all the time.

360
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,180
I was angry,
and Sharyl and I were fighting.

361
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:55,251
And I--
Just one day I just, uh--

362
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:56,919
I was so angry.

363
00:17:58,455 --> 00:18:01,024
And I just took off.

367
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,401
[Sharyl]
Joel!

368
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:22,905
Joel!

369
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,542
[Breathing Heavily]

370
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:30,446
Joel!

371
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,984
[Mouths Word]

372
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:44,026
Well, I'm sorry.
[Grunts Softly]

373
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:46,729
I'm fucking sorry.
[Cries]

374
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:50,066
- [Priest] It's okay.
- No. [Shouts]

375
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:52,769
[Sobs]
It's okay.

376
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:56,606
[Breathing Heavily]
It's okay.

377
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:03,079
"It's okay."
And he kept repeating it over and over again.

378
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:05,481
"It's okay. It's okay."

379
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:09,485
And then he didn't say anything else.
And that was it. [Carlo Clears Throat] Wow.

380
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:13,489
You guys aren't trying to proselytize us right now,
are you? [Chuckles]

381
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:16,826
- You? It would be a waste of time.
- Okay, good.

382
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:20,229
'Cause that's the-- that's the
last thing we need right now.

383
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:22,465
That was
the turning point.

384
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:28,070
I went cold turkey.
We both went cold turkey with fighting, booze.

385
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:30,039
And then
things changed for us.

386
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:33,743
[Whispers]
Yeah.

387
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:36,446
[Carlo]
Oh, yeah, that's great.

388
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:40,483
Never went back to that church. Never even
saw the priest. Some days I think I dreamt it.

389
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:42,718
[Carlo] Huh.
Dreamt it?

390
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,321
Well, it doesn't really matter,
because it wasn't what he said.

391
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:47,824
It was the way he said what he said.
It was his voice.

392
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,960
It was like I heard
this voice from somewhere.

393
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:52,695
- A voice?
- Huh.

394
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:54,263
I'll always owe that man
something.

395
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:57,967
[Carlo] Well,
maybe it wasn't about a man. But it was.

396
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:00,369
Maybe you just needed
somebody to-- to listen.

397
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:03,506
Yes, okay. Who in the end did listen?
Some voice in a dark confessional.

398
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:06,142
Right. Who was probably
masturbating. [Chuckles]

399
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:09,312
- That was inappropriate.
- Inappropriate? It was a joke.

400
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:12,014
- Yeah, well, it's not very funny.
- [Carlo] Whoa.

401
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:14,050
You used to think jokes
like that were funny.

402
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:17,053
[Chuckles] Really?
Did I? Okay, I'm sorry.

403
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:20,122
I'm sorry.
What-What are you telling me though, Joel?

404
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:22,024
That you had some kind of,

405
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:25,328
like, a supernatural experience or some cosmic--

406
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,864
[Joel] It was just a guy on the
other end of a confessional.

407
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,800
He helped me. His voi--
His voice helped me.

408
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:33,636
- [Grace] His voice?
- I was about to kill myself.

409
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,738
- Oh, come on, Joel. Don't be so dramatic.
- What?

410
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,507
- Seriously.
- You saw me then.

411
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,242
I know.
We all go through bad times.

412
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,711
Yes, and some of us kill ourselves as a result of them.

413
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,412
I realize that,
but not you.

414
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:44,914
What's going on here?

415
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:49,118
I was about to overdose,
and Sharyl hid my pills.

416
00:21:53,524 --> 00:21:58,594
- Okay, can we change the subject now, please?
- Jesus Christ.

417
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:02,565
Gracie-- Was it really that bad?

418
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,106
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I-I, uh--

419
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:12,141
I didn't realize.

420
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,712
Suicide is
so removed from me.

421
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:19,615
- You never thought about it?
- [Sighs] Actually, no.

422
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:21,417
Okay.
Dreamt about it?

423
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,185
Mm-mmm.

424
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:26,222
Everyone dreams about it, Carlo.
Not everybody. Not me.

425
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:28,724
I've had dreams about it.

426
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:32,361
- What?
- Just dreams, you know-- That--

427
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:34,564
A nightmare.
I had one once.

428
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,667
Really?
[Grace] I was in Buenos Aires.

429
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:39,702
- You've never been to Buenos Aires.
- I know.

430
00:22:39,704 --> 00:22:43,039
But... I was there.

431
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:47,977
I remember the light. It was not gold,
but just lighter than gold.

432
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:50,546
Full but not heavy.

433
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:55,117
Like... good music.

434
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,886
Light and still full.

435
00:22:56,888 --> 00:23:02,124
And I walked all over the city,
and I mingled with the whores.

436
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:04,327
[Women Chattering] I told them I was from New York,

437
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,395
and they thought
that was wonderful.

438
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:09,498
I thought it was more wonderful
to be from Argentina.

439
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,901
Being from that light,

440
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:15,004
from that music,
from those smells,

441
00:23:15,006 --> 00:23:18,441
and the whores
with braids in their hair.

442
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:23,212
They... fed me,
and they told me stories.

443
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:26,382
And they asked me to take them with me to New York.

444
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:28,985
But I wanted them to keep me here in Argentina.

445
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:32,054
[Women Speaking Spanish,
Indistinct]

446
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:35,558
And they spoke of
their dreams.

447
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,329
And when they spoke
of their dreams, the...

448
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:43,866
word itself...
stung me.

I was home.

[Sighs]

452
00:23:55,713 --> 00:24:00,583
And the...
grief inside me.

453
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:02,852
I don't know
what it was about, but...

454
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:06,055
it was unbearable.

455
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:11,994
[Crying]
And so,

456
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:16,966
I jumped.

457
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:20,136
You jumped.

458
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:23,806
It was just a dream.
Don't you ever have dreams like that?

459
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,608
No, I don't.
I'm sorry.

[Joel] Come on.
Carlo. I don't.

461
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,012
- You don't have nightmares?
- I-I don't tell people about them.

462
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:32,481
- Why not, Carlo?
- Because they're private.

Please don't take this
the wrong way,

but I don't want to know about your attempted suicide.

467
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:47,229
I don't want to know about you and
the church and the fucking snow,

468

or your sob story
in the confessional.

469
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,169
I definitely don't want to know about you
gallivanting with Argentinean whores.

470
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:56,839
I don't want to know any of that shit.
All that stuff is private.

471
00:24:56,841 --> 00:25:00,376
Okay? There's such a thing
as privacy.

We can't all go running around dangling our ids.

It was an important moment in my life.
I felt I should share it with you.

474
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,118
Oh, my God.
[Laughs]

475
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,687
Do you hear yourself?
You felt that you should sh--

476
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:13,856
Since when have you used
a phrase like that?

477
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:17,193
What is that, Joel?
Share it with me? What is what?

478
00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:20,096
Look, every time an adult uses that phrase,
it's as if they've been neutered.

479
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:22,398
Church is where things
turned around for me.

480
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,967
I can't believe what you're-- I cannot believe this.

481
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:27,570
Look. My friends don't have
religious conversions.

482
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:30,506
- Who said religious conversion? It's just a turning point.
- It's the same thing!

483
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:34,076
- And now you're telling me your child is baptized?
- Well, isn't yours?

No.

00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:39,115
Okay, fine?
What?

486
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,517
Don't look at me like that.
I could care less.

487
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:43,152
Right.

488
00:25:43,154 --> 00:25:45,554
- I'm not judging you.
- "Isn't yours?"

489
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:50,092
Wow. Carlo.
Cut me some slack!

490
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:18,654
[Sharyl]
Joel!

491
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:21,657
[Exhales]

492
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,560
Joel?

493
00:26:24,562 --> 00:26:26,896
God, I am hot.

494
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:29,698
- Jesus, it's getting so warm.
- I'm fine.

495
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,534
I'm cold.

496
00:26:41,545 --> 00:26:43,813
[Grunts]

497
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:48,284
[Clears Throat]
[Grunts]

498
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:50,019
Beautiful pool.

499
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:54,456
How are things at, uh--
at the agency?

500
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:59,595
Abysmal.

501
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:04,533
What are you working on?
Oh, shit, come on.

502
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:07,303
[Chuckles] You don't wanna know.
What? Tell me.

503
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:10,406
Give me a break. Give me a break!
Tell me what you're working on.

504
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:14,844
Okay, fine. Last month,
I spent 117 billable hours...

505
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:19,949
trying to get honey to drip just right off of this, uh,
granola bar.

506
00:27:21,918 --> 00:27:24,787
Granola bar?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

507
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:27,122
Okay, well--
[Clears Throat]

508
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:31,427
Obviously you're-you're
exceptional at what you do,

509
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:35,364
so, you know,
I think you should be proud of that.

510
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:37,032
For real.

511
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:41,503
Yeah.
Good wine.

512
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:44,340
[Chuckles Softly]

513
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,212
Sharyl!
He likes it!

514
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:53,649
What?

515
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:55,784
Sharyl!

516
00:27:55,786 --> 00:27:58,487
He likes the wine!

517
00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:02,391
Sharyl.
Sharyl.

518
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:04,660
He likes it. He--
Is that funny to you?

519
00:28:04,662 --> 00:28:06,662
- Is it funny?
- [Laughs]

520
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:08,397
[Locks Door]

521
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:14,069
We had a little discussion
about that earlier today.

522
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,339
Joel, enough. And you see, Sharyl,
in her good mood...

523
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:19,942
Joel.
blindly picked it out of the cellar this morning.

524
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:22,011
[Grace] You have a cellar?
Oh, God, yeah.

525
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:23,979
[Chuckles] Sharyl didn't show you?
Joel.

526
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,215
Come on. Field trip.

527
00:28:27,817 --> 00:28:30,719
Yeah. Oh!
Sharyl loves it.

528
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,688
It's her favorite room
in the house.

529
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,157
You know,
it's dark, damp, dirty.

530
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,360
<i>You really are gonna spoil dinner,
aren't you, Joel? God, she loves the cellar.</i>

531
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:42,031
She loves the cedar shelves.
She loves the goblets. She loves--

532
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:47,369
<i>Sharyl loves her decan--
I personally hate the decanter.</i>

533
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:51,974
- But Sharyl insists on her prized Internet auction--
- Joel. Joel.

534
00:28:51,976 --> 00:28:54,476
[Mocking] Sharyl, Sharyl,
Sharyl-- decanter.

535
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:56,912
Which I find ridiculous
and pretentious, by the way,

536
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:59,848
because if you know anything about wine,
you know you only decant something that needs air.

537
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:04,420
But not Sharyl.
She decants-- [Singsongy] all of them!

538
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:07,656
So I was curious what we were gonna drink tonight,
and so I asked her.

539
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:12,027
I said, "Where'd you grab it from?"
Because I actually know a thing or two about wines.

540
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:14,330
I have them organized
in the cellar.

541
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:15,965
[Grunts]

542
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:21,003
Pinot, Carménère, Malbec,
Riesling, Shiraz.

543
00:29:21,005 --> 00:29:23,973
- Sharyl's white zins in a shitty box...
- Joel.

544
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:25,708
in the corner
beneath everything.

545
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,813
So I asked her. I said, "Sharyl,
where did you grab it from?"

546
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:32,348
And, uh,
she said to me,

547
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,516
in that lovely way that she's known for,
she said--

548
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,752
[Imitating Sharyl]
"How the hell do I know, Joel?

549
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:38,654
I just grabbed one."

550
00:29:38,656 --> 00:29:43,092
And so I pressed further. I said, "Sharyl,
come on. I mean, you're not stupid.

551
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:45,060
Just visualize the corner
you grabbed it from."

552
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:48,097
And she said to me--
I swear to God,

553
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:51,200
she said to me,

554
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:57,172
[Shouting]
"Hell's corner!"

555
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:00,576
[Joel Laughing]
Exactly!

556
00:30:02,412 --> 00:30:06,015
So, I mean-- [Chuckles] we could be drinking...

557
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:09,218
<i>a hundred dollar bottle
of Ruffino, or--</i>

558
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,122
or cooking wine.
[Mutters]

559
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,503
Well, you've decorated it beautifully.
Thank you.

560
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:31,106
You think? Yeah, copper pots in the kitchen,
digital baby grand piano.

561
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:33,409
Oh, hey, let me show you something.
Look at this.

562
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:38,514
It's a,
uh-- It's a limited edition series monoprint by Roberson.

563
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:41,517
It's all kind of revolting,
if you ask me.

564
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,319
So much space.
I'm really happy the way it's turning out.

565
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:47,423
If you're not used to so much space,
it can make you anxious. Can we tell 'em?

566
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:49,425
Can we please tell 'em?
Look at that plant.

567
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:52,194
There's all this free space
around it, you know?

568
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:54,696
The sight of it nags me.
You know?

569
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:59,068
Sometimes I'll even take
something, and I'll move it,

570
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,103
just to fill up that space.

571
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:04,807
[Scraping Sound]
Whoa.

572
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:12,514
<i>Then of course the space I moved it from is now empty.</i>

573
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,684
So I put it back.

574
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:18,987
Well, you have
a beautiful house now.

575
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:20,789
[Sharyl]
Thank-Thank you.

576
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:26,728
It feels very...
opulent.

577
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,667
[Sighs Softly]

578
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:38,107
Really sorry to have you
both sleep in the living room.

579
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:42,845
It's just that, uh, we're-- we're remodeling
the guest room on the second floor.

580
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:48,851
[Whispers]
I'm sorry.

581
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:51,453
[Sighs]
I'll be right back.

582
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:59,695
So, hey, what else you got going on out here, huh?
Any shows?

583
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:01,530
Freelance?

584
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:03,565
Using that talent?

585
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:08,337
I'll go
and check on the baby.

586
00:32:11,975 --> 00:32:13,642
[Baby Crying Upstairs]

587
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:16,879
Let's go do something fun.
Just me and you.

588
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,749
Okay.
Okay.

589
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:25,921
[Sharyl]
Oh. Shh.

590
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:28,891
Shh.
[Baby Fusses]

591
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:31,860
[Sighs, Whispers]
Here we go.

592
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:33,996
Ah. Shh.

593
00:32:33,998 --> 00:32:36,598
He's beautiful.
Thank you.

594
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:45,607
You ever miss New York?
No.

595
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:47,509
[Whispers] No.
[Car Doors Closing, Engine Starts]

596
00:32:49,112 --> 00:32:52,714
[Sharyl Whispers]
Oh, they're leaving.

597
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:55,350
[Sharyl Sighs]

598
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:23,779
- Maybe I should drive. Want me to drive?
- Nah, it's all right. Fuck you.

599
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:27,216
This is a real car.
It's not Sharyl's fuckin' mommy-mobile.

600
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:32,621
<i>- [Grace] Are you guys okay?
- How do you mean?</i>

601
00:33:32,623 --> 00:33:36,091
It's none of my business.
You're right. It's not.

602
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:39,027
But Joel obviously
wants to make it yours.

603
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:42,231
I'm sorry I asked.
Oh, it's fine. It is what it is.

604
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:44,766
[Carlo] Whoa, whoa, relax. Relax.

605
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:46,535
You're originally from
the Midwest, right, Carlo?

606
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:49,504
Uh, well, I warned you--
I warned you. No paradise.

607
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:51,073
Oh, the cold.
Good God.

608
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:54,610
[Carlo] Yeah, the cold is uninhabitable.
And the people!

609
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:57,312
- [Carlo] The people are nice, huh?
- [Chuckles]

610
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:59,448
Do you like it out here?

611
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,817
I do, Grace.
I do.

612
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:05,320
Sure, it's been a change.
But my life has changed. My life is here.

613
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:07,189
[Carlo] Whoa.
Easy there, big guy.

614
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:09,891
Did you ever notice that when you ask
people from these uninhabitable places...

615
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:11,693
what makes this part
of the country so special,

616
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:13,729
they always say
it's the people, right?

617
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:16,331
"The people are good. The people are nice.
The people are friendly."

618
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,200
- Slow down. Slow down.
- You know why they say this?

619
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:20,702
- Because there's nothing else here.
- The roads are big.

620
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:24,773
The sky is big. The houses,
as you can see, are very, very big.

621
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:27,276
Joel.
Whenever there's a lack of anything decent,

622
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:29,645
you can always rely on the good people.
Joel!

623
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,214
- Ice cold winters.
- No grime.

624
00:34:32,216 --> 00:34:35,550
- Gray skies. - You don't have to wash
when you walk in the front door.

625
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:38,287
- Mosquito summers.
- There's no sirens at night.

626
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:40,155
Joel, stop the fucking car!
The people are good.

627
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:42,991
- Traffic.
- Our sports teams are good.

628
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:45,794
The sound of your neighbors
fucking against the wall.

629
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:49,464
That touchdown last week
was so fucking good!

had more to do than
this fucking wasteland.

635

There's nothing.
There is nothing to do.

636
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:13,422
But... we have
our painted faces...

637
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:16,024
and we have
our sports teams.

638
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:20,595
And we have our sausages.
And we have our people.

639

- Let's just go home, all right, Joel?
- Fuck that!

Come on! Let's get some shit beer,
and let's get fucked up.

Hey. Uh, we're at a convenience store really,
really far away.

Joel's pretty loaded.

647

Sounds like you're having fun.
When are you coming back?

648
00:35:45,823 --> 00:35:48,623
Is she standing in front of you?
Uh-huh.

649
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,626
Yeah, all right. Well, look,
when I get back,

650
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:53,528
<i>- we're leaving, okay?
- That's a great idea.</i>

651
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,230
<i>[Door Closes]
Cool. Oh, he's comin'.</i>

652
00:35:55,232 --> 00:35:57,799
I gotta go.
I love you.

653
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,869
Whoo! Go on.
I know you wanna drive this beast! Oh!

654
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:03,739
- Okay. Yes, gladly.
- Besides, my hands are full.

655
00:36:05,808 --> 00:36:08,343
[Exhales]

656
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:11,446
[Engine Starts]
Oh!

657
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:17,486
What's a great idea?
Hmm?

658
00:36:17,488 --> 00:36:19,821
You just said,
"That's a great idea."

659
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:23,825
Them coming back.
That's a great idea? [Chuckles]

660
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:27,496
Don't leave, Grace. Please?
We invited you here.

661
00:36:27,498 --> 00:36:29,731
Besides, it's over now.

662
00:36:34,337 --> 00:36:37,439
- [Joel] Look at you. Whoa!
- Easy.

663
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:40,342
Fierce!
[Grunts]

664
00:36:40,344 --> 00:36:45,781
I have time to work out.
Does it change when you have kids?

665
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,416
Huh?
Kids?

666
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:50,419
Um-- Yesterday I played
with Lucien for an hour.

667
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:52,687
I touched his-- his head.

668
00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:55,957
I kissed his neck.
I kissed his nose.

669
00:36:55,959 --> 00:37:00,695
And he laughed and squirmed.
And I laughed and squirmed.

670
00:37:00,697 --> 00:37:05,267
- Suddenly, he sank his teeth into my shoulder.
- Damn!

671
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:09,004
Lucien did that?
So that's what it's like havin' a kid.

672
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,574
Wow.

673
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,377
Well--
[Chuckles]

674
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:19,347
We had an argument
in school.

675
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:21,016
Argument?
Yeah.

676
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:22,884
I remember very little.
You don't remember that?

677
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:26,521
No, I'm sorry.
I'm not going to jeopardize my career,

678
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:29,491
or who I am, my art,
so I can have some kids.

679
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:31,726
Why? Because society
says I'm supposed to?

680
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:34,062
<i>'Cause my mom-- So you're below having kids?</i>

681
00:37:34,064 --> 00:37:37,432
Well, I'm not-- No, I'm not below having kids.
Yeah. You're being difficult.

682
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,100
You're-You're-- You're special.
I'm not.

683
00:37:39,102 --> 00:37:41,069
- You think you're special.
- That-- That I do.

684
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:42,737
That-- I think that I'm special, yes. [Chuckles]

685
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:44,973
Okay. Well, you know what?
You're not. Neither am I.

686
00:37:44,975 --> 00:37:46,608
And we're both gonna wind up
having kids...

687
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,643
and living in the suburbs.
No. Sub--

688
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:50,479
I ain't livin' in no suburbs.
This is below you.

689
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:51,813
Mm-mmm.
Because--

690
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:54,249
You're drunk,
because what you're saying to me...

691
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:57,018
is simple
and sentimental.

692
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,187
[Mock Whimpering]
"Have some kids."

693
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,323
You know what?
Who am I talking to right now?

694
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:04,559
You're actually drunk,
and you're pissing me off because you sound--

695
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,328
you sound phony.

696
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,530
Phony?
[Chuckles] Yeah.

697
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:14,236
You're sitting here lecturing me about
how special you are as a photographer.

698
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:16,037
How is that phony?

699
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:19,875
These sort of views you've obviously
picked up from undergraduates...

700
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:22,277
who get Daddy's monthly check.
[Chuckles] Maybe.

701
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:25,413
- And you're acting phony.
- Don't call me phony. 'Cause I have an issue--

702
00:38:25,415 --> 00:38:27,148
God, that actually
hurt your feelings.

703
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,985
I call your mom a slut, that doesn't matter,
but I call you a phony--

704
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:35,223
Call me phony one more time,
I'm gonna punch you in your fucking face.

705
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,125
For real.

706
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:41,196
How 'bout that?

707
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,100
Phony.

708
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:49,204
[Blows Raspberry]

709
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:51,873
- [Carlo Laughs]
- Oh, yes.

710
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,943
You fuckin' asshole. You lucky.
You lucky, man. I know.

711
00:38:54,945 --> 00:38:58,613
I live with me.
I mean-- [Laughs]

712
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:00,348
What, uh--
No, but seriously.

713
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,783
All right.
What were we talkin' about?

714
00:39:01,785 --> 00:39:03,285
Your mom.
[Chuckles]

715
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:05,320
You were right.

716
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:09,658
Was I?
You were right, yeah.

717
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,193
Uh,
I wanna have 'em.

718
00:39:12,195 --> 00:39:13,628
I wanna have
a bunch of 'em.

719
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,463
A big family.

720
00:39:15,465 --> 00:39:17,732
Like the one
that I grew up in.

721
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:20,135
I feel like life-- [Chuckles] I can't believe I'm say--

722
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:21,836
I feel like life is meaningless without children.

723
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,439
Well, life doesn't necessarily
become meaningful...

724
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:26,541
because you have children.

725
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:28,510
Well, if not meaningful,
then what?

726
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,179
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
I don't wanna have this conversion, Carlo.

727
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:34,783
Do not ask me to repeat clichés that
parents pass around like cocktail napkins.

728
00:39:34,785 --> 00:39:36,418
Fine.
"Oh. Oh, my God, kids.

729
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,587
They're so much work,
but they're worth it, you know?"

730
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:41,389
"My son teaches me
more than I teach him."

731
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:43,725
"They grow up so fast."

732
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:47,829
Oh, Jesus. It's more energy to
prop up these conversations...

733
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:49,931
than it is to actually have a kid!
Okay.

734
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:51,800
I'm just fumbling through it
like the next guy.

735
00:39:51,802 --> 00:39:56,037
We should stop self-consciously chatting
about parenthood and about children.

736
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,075
I mean, do you hear apes in the
zoo going on about their offspring...

737
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:02,043
and what they've learned
from them,

738
00:40:02,045 --> 00:40:04,346
[Deeper Voice] and how much they mean to them,

739
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:06,448
and nyuh-nyuh-nyuh?

740
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,218
All right.
So, am I-- Am I an ape?

741
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,254
<i>Is that what's happening right now?
I don't know. You tell me.</i>

742
00:40:15,558 --> 00:40:17,158
Are you an ape?

743
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,562
[Joel Imitating Ape Hooting]
You made it back!

744
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:24,165
[Hooting]

745
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,601
[Joel Chuckles]

746
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:29,571
Ugh. Where did you go?
A convenience store.

747
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:31,172
More wine?
Oh, yes, please.

748
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:34,709
I wasn't talking to you.
I'm finished fighting, sweetie. Okay?

749
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:36,745
Just give me some more wine.
Please?

750
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:38,647
I don't think you want any more, Joel.
Oh, really?

751
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:40,682
I thought I just asked you
for some more.

752
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:42,684
<i>No. I don't think
you really want any more.</i>

753
00:40:42,686 --> 00:40:44,519
Do you want more, Joel?
What do you think?

754
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:47,856
- I just told you what I thought.
- All right! For God sakes!

755
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:52,193
- All right, guys. we're gonna-- - We can stay.
We can stay. We'll stay. We're gonna stay.

756
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:54,029
Gracie.

757
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:57,999
Scotch, anyone?

758
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:01,870
Just relax.

759
00:41:03,205 --> 00:41:04,939
Mmm.

760
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:11,046
- You're looking really good, Carlo.
- Thank you. Thank you.

761
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:13,882
I was just telling Joel that I'm,
you know, working out more.

762
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:15,950
- Really? Where?
- Trying to stay in shape.

763
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:17,719
We're just about to have dessert.
[Chuckles]

764
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:19,754
Dessert. Yeah, crème brûlée.
Oh, my God.

765
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:21,823
[Grace] Carlo's favorite.
Right.

766
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:24,392
- Remember when we took them to Le Fou?
- Right. Le Fou.

767
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:27,328
Fantastic crème brûlée at Le Fou.
For your anniversary.

768
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:31,232
- And the waiter spilled coffee all over Joel.
- That's right.

769
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:34,169
[Carlo Chuckles] That's right.
[Sharyl Laughs]

770
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:36,604
Wow, it has really been
a long time.

771
00:41:36,606 --> 00:41:39,074
Oh, I love that place!

772
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:42,477
- And we live two blocks away.
- [Sharyl] You don't go?

773
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:45,580
- We try not to eat out anymore.
- Well, it's nothing like the food out here.

774
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:48,750
Just steakhouses,
sausage factories and slaughterhouses.

775
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:52,687
Well, thank you, Sharyl,
for the crème brûlée. That's very thoughtful.

776
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:55,056
Don't thank me yet,
Carlo.

777
00:41:55,058 --> 00:41:58,393
I'm sure it's much better
than at Le Fou.

778
00:41:58,395 --> 00:42:01,496
Are you always
so ingratiating?

779
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:05,934
Another toast.
Another toast.

780
00:42:05,936 --> 00:42:07,435
Okay.

781
00:42:07,437 --> 00:42:09,204
Age...

782
00:42:09,206 --> 00:42:10,839
earns us...

783
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:13,108
our imperfections.

784
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,845
What the hell sort of a toast
was that, Joel?

785
00:42:16,847 --> 00:42:18,646
So don't worry about it,
Carlo.

786
00:42:18,648 --> 00:42:22,684
- Worry about--
- Age, baldness, kids.

787
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:25,453
You never wanna get
too perfect.

788
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:27,722
Me?
Well--

789
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:29,991
[Chuckles Softly]
Sure I do.

790
00:42:29,993 --> 00:42:33,828
What he's trying to say, Carlo,
is don't try to be too happy.

791
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,565
- It would actually upset him.
- Sharyl.

792
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:41,903
It might actually make him realize just
how miserable he is. Really, it would.

793
00:42:41,905 --> 00:42:45,006
- Yeah, it would.
- It would.

794
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:48,510
Well, you caught us
at a bad time.

795
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:52,480
Sharyl and I are--

796
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:58,086
- How would you describe it, Sharyl?
- Hmm?

797
00:42:58,088 --> 00:43:00,255
Oh, um--

798
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:02,457
We're getting a divorce.

799
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,396
Crème brûlée, anyone?

800
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,849
Your son.
I mean, look at him.

801
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:30,418
Could he be more handsome?
[Chuckles] Thank you.

802
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,056
All those cheeks.
Truly a Gerber Baby. [Baby Exclaims]

803
00:43:35,058 --> 00:43:39,727
Every baby is a Gerber Baby.
That's not true, actually.

804
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:41,830
I think he's ugly.

805
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:45,934
It upsets her when I talk like that.
Of course it upsets me.

806
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:47,869
You shouldn't make jokes like that.
It was a joke.

807
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:50,438
Maybe you're just scared
that I believe it.

808
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,242
Do you?
I'm the only person with a sense of humor around here.

809
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:57,378
Oh. Can I take a peek?
[Whispers] Yeah.

810
00:43:58,747 --> 00:44:01,049
He's usually so fussy.

811
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:05,787
I love how you did this.

812
00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:08,623
Oh. Huh.
You wanna buy it?

813
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,861
It's probably out
of my price range.

814
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:14,929
I doubt that.

815
00:44:15,998 --> 00:44:18,700
Hey, whatever happened
with that Romario exhibit?

816
00:44:18,702 --> 00:44:22,837
It, uh,
got canceled. Why?

817
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:25,940
Well, Romario
is a psychopath.

818
00:44:25,942 --> 00:44:28,810
His wife left him,
so he pulled out,

819
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:32,680
and without Romario
there's no show.

820
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:36,150
And without the show,
you know--

821
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,420
[Grunts]
That sucks.

822
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:42,457
Yeah, it did suck.

823
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:45,393
Do you ever get anxious when girls pair off like that?

824
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:49,831
You know,
when they do something that we should want to do.

825
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:54,435
Something that we should like to do, like...
stare at a sleeping baby.

826
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:57,472
Why would I wanna stare at a sleeping baby?
[Chuckles]

827
00:44:57,474 --> 00:44:59,407
You know
what we should do?

828
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:02,744
We should both go in there a little later on,
play a joke on 'em.

829
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,212
Shock 'em.

830
00:45:04,214 --> 00:45:06,915
You should say,
"Can I take a peek?"

831
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,650
And then I'll say,
"Sure."

832
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:10,785
And then I'll follow you
in there.

833
00:45:10,787 --> 00:45:12,987
Want to do that?
[Chuckling]

834
00:45:14,223 --> 00:45:17,058
Are you all right, Carlo?
Are you doing all right?

835
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,694
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

836
00:45:19,696 --> 00:45:21,996
I am.
But now that, uh--

837
00:45:24,967 --> 00:45:26,935
[Exhales]

838
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:30,238
That story you told me,
I got so upset--

839
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,273
Look, it happened.
I was moved.

840
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:35,743
I know,
but years from now you are going to confess to me...

841
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:38,780
that that whole story
was bullshit.

842
00:45:38,782 --> 00:45:40,448
No. No. Yes.
Yes, you are.

843
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,885
You're gonna confess to me that
whole story was a load of crap.

844
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:45,453
It wasn't a story.

845
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,422
If I'm religious at all,
if I'm spiritual,

846
00:45:47,424 --> 00:45:50,892
if I can even say that with a straight
face-- you know me and my--

847
00:45:50,894 --> 00:45:53,661
If I can do any of this,

848
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:55,997
it's because of poignancy.

849
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:57,899
Because of poignancy?

850
00:45:57,901 --> 00:46:01,336
There are moments when life distills itself very tightly,
just for a second.

851
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:05,273
Something moves me, something...
tells me that I can go on.

852
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:10,044
<i>That I should go on.
That I want to go on.</i>

853
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:14,315
What is that thing?

854
00:46:17,786 --> 00:46:19,988
[Laughing]
I can't do it.

855
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,124
- Jesus.
- That-- That is a luxury.

856
00:46:23,126 --> 00:46:25,960
- A-A luxury?
- A wealthy man's luxury.

857
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:28,162
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

858
00:46:28,164 --> 00:46:31,132
Look, Joel, a lot of people
here on Earth...

859
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:34,068
are worried about their next grand to pay for bills.

860
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:39,741
We don't have time to stare at our navels
and listen to men in confessionals.

861
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:42,677
- You feel me?
- Okay, fair enough.

862
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:46,481
All right.

863
00:46:46,483 --> 00:46:48,316
What's wrong, Carlo?

864
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:50,451
I'm fine.
Come on. You can tell me.

865
00:46:50,453 --> 00:46:53,254
Hey, I'm-- I'm fine.

866
00:46:53,256 --> 00:46:54,756
Okay.

867
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:01,496
I don't know.
You just seem--

868
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:08,202
It's money.

869
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:13,875
[Sharyl] Hello, beautiful.
He looks like Carlo.

870
00:47:13,877 --> 00:47:16,144
I think he looks like you.
[Chuckles]

871
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:19,047
Hello, beautiful.

872
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:22,784
Yes, you're beau--
Handsome. You're handsome.

873
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:24,919
You did good, Grace.

874
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:27,088
Thanks.
You did good.

875
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,123
Did Daddy
wake you up?

876
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,692
Did Daddy wake you up
from your nap?

877
00:47:31,694 --> 00:47:33,528
It's all right.
Yeah.

878
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,663
[Whimpers]
This is Auntie Sharyl.

879
00:47:35,665 --> 00:47:37,598
[Crying]
Ohh!

880
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,368
He's my little man.

881
00:47:41,136 --> 00:47:43,304
[Carlo]
Our debt is crushing us.

882
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,144
Yeah, Gracie had to leave school
and go back to her restaurant job.

883
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:52,146
It's-- I don't know.

884
00:47:52,148 --> 00:47:54,916
Student loans
and credit cards...

885
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:57,485
and going out
a lot at night,

886
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,322
trying to keep up
appearances.

887
00:48:01,324 --> 00:48:05,359
I said that it would all
work itself out, but--

888
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,462
You paid off
all your student loans?

889
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:09,163
Yeah.

890
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,768
I haven't sold
a photograph in--

891
00:48:15,003 --> 00:48:16,704
Jesus.

892
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:19,841
I'm sorry.

893
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:22,009
Well, not as sorry
as my wife.

894
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:23,578
[Laughs]

895
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,114
I can get you an interview
with my agency.

896
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:29,584
I told myself
I would never do that.

897
00:48:30,853 --> 00:48:32,487
How much money--

898
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:35,890
I-I wanted to call you a couple of months ago, but...

899
00:48:35,892 --> 00:48:37,859
Gracie, she--
she wouldn't let me.

900
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:43,331
Oh, so sweet.

901
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:51,272
Breathing in and out
so fast.

902
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:53,141
Did the delivery boy come yet?
No.

903
00:48:53,143 --> 00:48:55,309
[Car Horns Honking]

904
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:58,446
Oh, God.
That I don't miss about New York.

905
00:48:58,448 --> 00:49:00,915
I'm beginning to hate it here myself.
Beginning?

906
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:02,550
You hate New York?

907
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:04,785
Everyone is always
moving, moving, moving,

908
00:49:04,787 --> 00:49:08,990
and-and we-- we just seem to-- we seem to be stuck.

909
00:49:08,992 --> 00:49:12,293
But the rest of the world,
forget about it. They love New York.

910
00:49:12,295 --> 00:49:14,962
T-shirts and Taipei.

911
00:49:14,964 --> 00:49:17,865
"I Love New York."
It's disgusting.

912
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:19,967
I still
love the city.

913
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:22,170
Well, you're from here.
So?

914
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:24,639
So you have to say it.
I have to?

915
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:27,742
That's a stupid thing
to say.

916
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:31,078
Oh, can I take a peek?

917
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,414
What?
Can I take a peek?

918
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:35,249
Can you take-- [Whispering] Can I take a peek?

919
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:37,919
Yes, of-of course.
Please. Of course.

920
00:49:44,593 --> 00:49:47,128
What in God's name
are they doing?

921
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,030
I don't know.
Taking a peek, I guess.

922
00:49:49,032 --> 00:49:50,665
Yeah.
They don't do that.

923
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:52,833
Well, I guess they do.

924
00:49:56,972 --> 00:49:59,006
Now what?
Mmm.

925
00:49:59,008 --> 00:50:02,476
I don't know. I think we just wait in
here until they're very uncomfortable.

926
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:04,946
Then we go
back out there.

927
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,249
Ah, you know what?

928
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:10,284
I remember this age.

929
00:50:10,286 --> 00:50:12,653
It goes by really fast.

930
00:50:12,655 --> 00:50:15,156

00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:19,694
[Sighs]

933
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:23,264
You guys seem happy.

934
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,833
We are.

935
00:50:26,802 --> 00:50:28,903
It's nice to see.

936
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:34,942
I'm really sorry
for what happened that night.

937
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:36,978
Oh, I know.

938
00:50:40,983 --> 00:50:43,150
[Coffee Pouring]

939
00:50:43,152 --> 00:50:45,353
I wanna make things better.

940
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:53,194
So what are you
up to now?

941
00:50:53,196 --> 00:50:55,863
Oh, um, I'm running
the local arts council.

942
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:58,699
That's nice. Mmm.
It's really nice actually.

943
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:03,537
I've been meaning to ask Carlo if maybe he
wants to come in and run a seminar for the week.

944
00:51:04,873 --> 00:51:06,874
I'm sure
he'd be flattered.

945
00:51:09,144 --> 00:51:12,113
We had fun,
the four of us.

946
00:51:12,115 --> 00:51:15,182
Joel says he misses that.
Misses you guys.

947
00:51:15,184 --> 00:51:18,019
W-We miss you guys.

948
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:23,424
Oh!

949
00:51:24,192 --> 00:51:25,860
Almost forgot.

950
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:32,667
I got a present
for the little one.

951
00:51:38,507 --> 00:51:40,608
Aren't you
gonna open it?

952
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:44,011
Shouldn't I wait to open it
in front of the baby?

953
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:46,380
Oh. Okay.

954
00:51:46,915 --> 00:51:48,949
I'll open it now.

955
00:52:03,965 --> 00:52:05,700
Thank you.

956
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:14,041
Are you guys...
having any more kids?

957
00:52:18,947 --> 00:52:21,315
[Sighs]
I, uh--

958
00:52:21,317 --> 00:52:23,351
I can't have any more.

959
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:25,686
[Laughing]

960
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:30,324
Is that funny?

961
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:32,593
Oh, God, no.
No. Oh, God--

962
00:52:32,595 --> 00:52:34,362
I'm sorry.
Is that funny?

963
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:37,531
No, no, no, no, no, no.
[Laughing Continues]

964
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:41,135
No. No.
No, it's--

965
00:52:41,137 --> 00:52:44,138
It's just that
you can't have any more,

966
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,807
and I don't want any more.

967
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,144
Then don't
have any more.

968
00:52:50,146 --> 00:52:52,113
I'm pregnant.

969
00:52:55,417 --> 00:52:58,452
But I'm not having it.
[Sighs]

970
00:52:59,454 --> 00:53:01,856
Carlo really wants to, but...

971
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:05,459
we can't afford it.

972
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:07,928
Oh, my God.

973
00:53:10,832 --> 00:53:13,768
It's hard for me
to admit this, but...

974
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:17,805
I don't love being a mom.

975
00:53:19,441 --> 00:53:21,942
It gets easier after
the first three months.

976
00:53:21,944 --> 00:53:24,278
Don't tell me that!
I don't want advice.

977
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,480
What do you want me
to say?

978
00:53:26,482 --> 00:53:29,216
Don't you ever
get angry about it?

979
00:53:29,218 --> 00:53:32,153
Angry?
Taking care of your baby?

980
00:53:32,155 --> 00:53:34,422
Well... a little.
But it passes.

981
00:53:34,424 --> 00:53:37,124
I-I-I feel grateful.

982
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:39,293
I-- I had a rea--

983
00:53:39,295 --> 00:53:42,263
really bad day
last week.

984
00:53:42,265 --> 00:53:44,932
Do you wanna get
a soda?

01:02:50,946 --> 01:02:53,046
[Grace] Oh!
Thank you, but I got it.

1148
01:02:53,048 --> 01:02:55,115
Jesus, I said I would tip him.
It's done.

1149
01:02:55,117 --> 01:02:56,783
All right.
Take the money. No.

1150
01:02:56,785 --> 01:02:58,318
Come on. Take it.
Are you kidding me?

1151
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,821
- No.
- That's a hundred dollars.

1152
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:02,456
I know.

1153
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,694
Did my husband
ask you for money?

1154
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:10,497
- No. What? No.
- I didn't ask him for anything.

1155
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:12,532
You did, didn't you?

1156
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:20,440
[Quietly]
Thanks.

1157
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,415
[Door Closes]
He asked you for money?

1158
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:31,451
I'm not going home with this hundred-dollar bill.
I'm calling that diner.

1159
01:03:31,453 --> 01:03:34,154
That guy is coming back here
and I'm going to tip him $100.

1160
01:03:34,156 --> 01:03:36,456
- What?
- I'm calling-- Where's the redial?

1161
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:39,626
- Can we just go back to the hotel, Joel?
- Hello? Yeah, hi.

1162
01:03:39,628 --> 01:03:43,263
- Uh, I don't know the ad-- What's the address?
- How the fuck do I know?

1163
01:03:43,265 --> 01:03:47,300
I don't know the address. We just had the milk shakes.
Yeah, yeah, could you, uh--

1164
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:50,670
Uh, uh, could-- Oh, Jesus Christ.
He hung up on me.

1165
01:03:52,974 --> 01:03:56,343
Yeah, hi. Please don't hang up on me.
Yeah, thanks. Would you--

1166
01:03:56,345 --> 01:03:58,578
I'd like you to send
that old man back here.

1167
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,981
'Cause I'd like to tip him
a lot of money.

1168
01:04:00,983 --> 01:04:04,184
Yeah, okay. Well, do that then.
That's terrific. Absolutely.

1169
01:04:04,186 --> 01:04:06,820
Great. Okay.
Thank you so much.

1170
01:04:06,822 --> 01:04:09,489
He didn't believe me,
so I ordered four more shakes.

1171
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:11,992
- How much money did he ask you for?
- I don't know. He didn't say.

1172
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:15,028
He's always been irresponsible, Joel.
Never managed his money.

1173
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:18,031
You know that. Let's not judge.
Who knows what happened to 'em.

1174
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:20,534
It's not a mystery.
He's been in debt ever since we've known him.

1175
01:04:20,536 --> 01:04:22,502
I was in debt once.
And we took care of it.

1176
01:04:22,504 --> 01:04:24,571
Well, some people
aren't as lucky, Sharyl.

1177
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:27,808
Is that what this is about? Luck?
Your luck or his luck? We're not gonna fight.

1178
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:31,278
Showing your generosity by tipping
a stranger a hundred dollars?

1179
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,713
He's not a stranger.
He's a delivery guy.

1180
01:04:33,715 --> 01:04:35,849
[Whispering] We're not floating in money, Joel.

1181
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:38,985
No one admits they're floating in money.
If they did, they'd actually have to feel guilty.

1182
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:40,687
Guilty?

1183
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:43,924
We earned that money. Come on.
Do not start with the meritocracy line.

1184
01:04:43,926 --> 01:04:46,827
I don't want to talk politics.
You know we inherited money.

1185
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:49,529
I took a job I can't stand--
that kills me day in and out.

1186
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:52,432
People inherit money all the time, Joel.
We sacrificed.

1187
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:55,068
We moved away
from New York!

1188
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:58,405
We made choices.
How much does he want?

1189
01:04:58,407 --> 01:05:00,440
I don't know.
He didn't say. He didn't?

1190
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:02,442
No. We were interrupted.
You think it's a lot of money?

1191
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:08,215
There isn't. We have the same dreams,
the same ideals. Come on. Look at him.

1192
01:05:08,217 --> 01:05:10,417
So you're just gonna
give him money?

1193
01:05:10,419 --> 01:05:13,019
If you agree, yeah.
And if I don't agree?

1194
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:16,189
Then we'll talk about it.
And if after we talk about it I still don't agree?

1195
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:18,158
Then we'll flip a coin.

1196
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,327
Very funny.

1197
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:21,761
No.

1198
01:05:21,763 --> 01:05:23,430
No.

1199
01:05:23,432 --> 01:05:26,266
I won't give him money that would
get him out of his crushing debt.

1200
01:05:26,268 --> 01:05:28,068
He said,
"crushing debt"?

1201
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:31,104
Joel, when somebody says "crushing
debt" and they ask for money,

1202
01:05:31,106 --> 01:05:32,606
<i>they mean
a lotof money.</i>

1203
01:05:32,608 --> 01:05:34,908
Maybe we should give 'em money.
Okay, great.

1204
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:38,812
Let's just give away all our life savings
to beggars, friends, delivery boys. Great.

1205
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,814
[Joel]
Jesus Chr--

1206
01:05:41,617 --> 01:05:47,787
Um, Grace said that the delivery
man speaks perfect English.

1207
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:50,957
I started to ask him
do you have any change,

1208
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:52,492
and I stopped myself
mid-sentence,

1209
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:55,228
figuring he probably didn't speak English,
and he said--

1210
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,963
"I have change."

1211
01:05:56,965 --> 01:05:58,798
And I said,
"Oh, you speak English."

1212
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,867
And he said, "Of course.
Why wouldn't I?"

1213
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:03,670
And I said, "My husband said you didn't,"
and he said,

1214
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:06,306
- "Your husband's wrong."
- I didn't even say he didn't speak English.

1215
01:06:06,308 --> 01:06:09,609
- You still want to give him a hundred bucks now?
- Yes, of course. Why not?

1216
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:11,778
Well, he's coming back.
He's coming back?

1217
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,813
Yeah. Joel called him back.
You called him back?

1218
01:06:13,815 --> 01:06:16,750
I said I was gonna tip the guy $100.
He's coming back for the tip.

1219
01:06:16,752 --> 01:06:19,152
You called that poor old man back here?

1220
01:06:19,154 --> 01:06:22,022
To tip him
a hundred dollars.

1221
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:24,958
For some reason,
my husband wants to show his generosity this evening.

1222
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,526
Sharyl.

1223
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:30,964
- You must be enjoying this.
- Enjoying what?

1224
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:33,800
- [Carlo] I thought we said we were done fighting--
- I'm not done fighting.

1225
01:06:33,802 --> 01:06:36,303
- What the-- Enjoying what?
- Him groveling.

1226
01:06:36,305 --> 01:06:39,105
Look at your smug little face.
You love this, don't you?

1227
01:06:39,107 --> 01:06:41,708
What the fuck are you talking about?
This is your revenge.

1228
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,476
Revenge?
[Carlo] Grace, please--

1229
01:06:43,478 --> 01:06:45,478
Whoa. No, no, no.
Revenge? For what?

1230
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,847
[Grace] For your mediocrity.
What?

1231
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:52,052
He was the more talented of
you two in graduate school.

1232
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:55,055
Oh, my God! In fact,
you had very little talent, if any at all.

1233
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:58,225
And you had an inferiority complex about it for years.

1234
01:06:58,227 --> 01:06:59,793
Did I?
You did.

1235
01:06:59,795 --> 01:07:01,661
Grace-- My husband got all the attention.

1236
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:04,197
- He was the star of that program.
- [Chuckles] That he was.

1237
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:06,866
And this is your revenge,
isn't it?

1238
01:07:06,868 --> 01:07:11,471
Oh, it must be delicious for you
to see him so weak and needy.

1239
01:07:11,473 --> 01:07:14,107
So I harbor an inferiority complex,
and I'm without talent.

1240
01:07:14,109 --> 01:07:17,711
- Is that what I'm supposed to believe?
- They're not my words.

This is why I don't
like dinner parties.

1244
01:07:45,673 --> 01:07:47,374
Divorce.

1245
01:07:48,442 --> 01:07:50,844
[Carlo] No,
you can't-- You can't be.

1246
01:07:51,946 --> 01:07:54,180
Yeah, you're right.

1247
01:07:54,182 --> 01:07:55,782
It would be
an annulment.

1248
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:58,518
The Catholic Church would tell
us our marriage never existed.

1249
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,756
Invalid from the beginning.
It was all a mirage.

1250
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:06,593
You guys--

1251
01:08:06,595 --> 01:08:08,662
[Joel] What?
You guys were so happy.

1252
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:10,563
Were we?

1253
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:13,833
We had plans-- our vacation in Costa Rica.

1254
01:08:13,835 --> 01:08:15,935
Well, we're not divorcing
to inconvenience you.

1255
01:08:15,937 --> 01:08:18,138
Well, you could see a counselor.
Counselor?

1256
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,673
A referee? Please.
[Joel] Please.

1257
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:23,510
That beautiful baby boy up
there-- What's gonna happen?

1258
01:08:23,512 --> 01:08:25,812
Are you being serious?
You see that couch you're sitting on?

1259
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:28,148
That is a pullout bed.
Okay, Joel, enough.

1260
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:32,018
I have a feeling my name is embroidered on it.
Enough. It's getting old, Joel.

1261
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,553
What?
The joke is getting old.

1262
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:36,022
Who said it was a joke?
Your sarcasm's getting very old.

1263
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:39,492
She ordered it last year.
Joel thinks I ordered it for him.

1264
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:41,828
We have never had a pullout couch in our lives.

1265
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,130
Not even in our little apartment in New York.

1266
01:08:44,132 --> 01:08:46,433
And she orders
a pullout couch here.

1267
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:49,536
Sharyl claims to be above my nasty words,
but Sharyl fights in very subtle ways.

1268
01:08:49,538 --> 01:08:52,138
Look at the way you're behaving.
I refuse to sleep on it.

1269
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,641
I have sequestered myself up
in the unfinished guest room...

1270
01:08:54,643 --> 01:08:56,876
amidst the paint cans
and the drywall.

1271
01:08:56,878 --> 01:08:59,045
I think I'm becoming asthmatic as a result of it.

1272
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:02,849
[Sobs] But I have to finish that
room so I can get some sleep,

1273
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:05,352
because I refuse to
even sit on that couch.

1274
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:07,554
Because if I do,
she wins.

1275
01:09:07,556 --> 01:09:09,189
This is--
This is too much.

1276
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:10,924
This--
This is nothing.

1277
01:09:10,926 --> 01:09:14,094
We are fine with the couch.
Good. It's all yours.

1278
01:09:14,096 --> 01:09:15,862
I'm asking you...

1279
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,998
politely...

1280
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,134

1281
01:09:21,136 --> 01:09:22,836

1288
01:10:03,612 --> 01:10:05,645
I used to play
our bossa nova CD's...

1289
01:10:05,647 --> 01:10:07,747
to get a rise
out of Sharyl.

1290
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:10,517
Then she found them,
and she threw them out. You asshole!

1291
01:10:10,519 --> 01:10:12,552
So I bought some more
and she threw those out.

01:10:49,825 --> 01:10:53,893
I guess what I'm saying, Joel, is I'm not really
moping because I have nothing to mope about.

1306
01:10:55,796 --> 01:10:59,065
I'm quite satisfied
is what I'm saying.

1307
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:04,037
How do you know
he was my only?

1308
01:11:04,972 --> 01:11:07,774

That's clever, Sharyl.
Really?

1312

Yeah.
What is? Tell me.

1313
01:11:18,286 --> 01:11:20,420
What? What's clever?

1314
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:22,489
You're smug.

1315
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:25,458
But the truth is,
you know nothing.

1316
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:29,062
[Whispering] And I would never
tell you what you want to know.

1317
01:11:29,064 --> 01:11:30,697
One day...

1318
01:11:30,699 --> 01:11:33,566
I'm gonna murder you.

I feel sick.

1323
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:47,780
What do you mean
by "only"?

1324
01:11:47,782 --> 01:11:49,382
We don't socialize much anymore because Joel--

1325
01:11:49,384 --> 01:11:52,452
- What do you mean?
- has the habit of embarrassing us.

1326
01:11:52,454 --> 01:11:56,489
It was one of the reasons we
didn't make it to your wedding.

1327
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:58,558
I am so sorry
you had to see this.

1328
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,794
Are you kidding? This will do them good.
See what a marriage can become.

1329
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:04,898
It will do them good to know
that I find you abominable,

1330
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,468
that the thought of having sex with you revolts me.

1331
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:10,103
Sharyl--

1332
01:12:11,939 --> 01:12:14,340
I would rather you
fuck a whore...

1333
01:12:14,342 --> 01:12:16,576
than put your hands
on my shoulders.

1334
01:12:17,745 --> 01:12:21,281

Carlo and Grace,

1343
01:13:57,078 --> 01:14:01,681
the mold, the archetype
of a good relationship.

1344
01:14:01,683 --> 01:14:05,852
Such passion,
warmth, humanity.

1345
01:14:07,287 --> 01:14:10,023
Sharyl and I used to joke.
Didn't we, Sharyl?

01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:12,792
[Sobbing] Before we started to fall apart.

1347
01:14:12,794 --> 01:14:15,194
When we still had a sense of humor,
we used to say...

1348
01:14:15,196 --> 01:14:18,264
that we wanted the two of you,
Carlo and Grace,

1349
01:14:18,266 --> 01:14:20,433

into a statue...

1350

in our backyard to--

No, I didn't.
I actually wanted to help.

- We don't need your help.
We can handle this on our own. - Can we?

This is between you and me,

- How much did he ask for?
- That's none of your business!

Well, I think it is,
'cause your husband asked us for it. How much?

- Well, my husband is rescinding his request.
- We need $55,000.

Believe me, your husband doesn't need to
rescind anything, because there's no way in hell--

Okay.

any money, no matter what my husband says.

we don't talk about you.

and you scooped up
some food,

to my baby Lucien's lips.

such slutty taste in clothes.

Yeah, you are.

and this painter that's coming through New York,

1427
01:18:40,328 --> 01:18:42,862
as if my husband
doesn't read the trades,

as if he isn't wishing he was here
doing those exact same things.

I don't tell you those things to look down on you, Joel.
Yeah, you do.

- Come on. Come on. You do.

What are you doing?
I'm writing them a check.

1433
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:16,829
[Grace] We're not taking that check.
Why not?

1434
01:19:16,831 --> 01:19:20,199
Because... you made
a commitment to us.

you and me.

[Grace] Not you.

Oh, really? What are you gonna do?
Call a bank? Ask for a loan?

1438

With what equity? Huh?

01:19:36,551 --> 01:19:39,018
It's just a matter of time.
I believe in him.

1442
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:41,654
Well, it takes more than belief to sell photos.

1443
01:19:41,656 --> 01:19:44,657
We're gonna pay him back, Grace,
as soon as I sell something.

Because I deserve that money.

01:20:11,285 --> 01:20:13,953
Oh, please let me do this.
Please. Why?

1452
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:17,690
- I'm paying you back that money.
- No. It's a gift. It's a gift.

01:20:17,692 --> 01:20:19,158
No.
Absolutely not.

Is the money dirty?

No. It's just
not ours to take.

1460

Okay, when I asked Carlo-- I said to him,
I could get you an interview at my agency.

1461
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:41,547
Do you know what he said?
He said "I told myself I would never do that."

1462
01:20:41,549 --> 01:20:43,783
"I told myself
I would never do that."

1463
01:20:43,785 --> 01:20:46,519
Why would he say that?
Why would he say that to me?

1464
01:20:46,521 --> 01:20:49,655
I mean, why not say,
it's not for me, I'm not interested,

1465
01:20:49,657 --> 01:20:52,291
I want to keep doing exhibits,
I want to keep selling art?

1466
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:55,061
Instead, he said,
"I told myself I would never do that."

1467
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:57,296
There's this line
that Carlo will never cross.

1468
01:20:57,298 --> 01:20:59,231
There's something
he will never sink down to.

1469
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:02,101
- Joel, you know that's not what I meant.
- That's exactly what you meant!

1470
01:21:02,103 --> 01:21:05,237
- I meant I have different plans.
- You have the same plans that I once had.

1471
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:07,339
But you changed your plans.
Maybe you should too.

1472
01:21:07,341 --> 01:21:10,242
- No. Why?
- Because they're not working.

1473
01:21:11,845 --> 01:21:14,647
Don't resent me for that.
Grow up.

1474

they beat you down, they destroy you.

1475

Ask anybody who makes a living and
they will tell you exactly the same thing.

1476
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:25,524
Let me fill you in
on something.

1477
01:21:25,526 --> 01:21:28,727
We're not special.
We're not brilliant.

1478
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:30,629
We never were.

1479
01:21:30,631 --> 01:21:34,567
Any artist out there that doesn't think
that they're special, they're lying.

1480
01:21:34,569 --> 01:21:37,069
Okay, then I guess I was never a serious artist.

1481
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:39,105
I guess not, Joel.

1482
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:45,811
You think I don't look in the mirror
and want to scream sometimes?

1483
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,181
But I have a family
and a place to live,

1484
01:21:49,183 --> 01:21:52,685
and people around me
that I love, and... a yard.

1485
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,154
Yeah, a yard...

1486
01:21:55,156 --> 01:21:56,789
where my little boy--

1487
01:21:58,525 --> 01:22:02,661
where my one little boy
can play.

1488
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:09,335
Now, at the end of the day,
what more can I ask for?

1489
01:22:09,337 --> 01:22:12,338
Tell me.
What more can I ask for?

1490
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,707
It's not about
wanting more, Joel.

1491
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:18,144
I just want
something different.

1492
01:22:21,915 --> 01:22:24,617
Well, then,
you pay a price.

Was he happy?
Happy?

1504
01:23:41,329 --> 01:23:43,529
That you gave him
that tip?

1505
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:45,431
He smiled.

1506

Yeah.
