1
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:16,606
Grab it, Lu.

2
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,635
Give me that stick.

3
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,076
Drop.

4
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,017
Drop.

5
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,080
Drop it.

6
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:33,350
That's a girl.
That's a girl.

7
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,850
Drop it. Good dog.

8
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,153
Lucy.

9
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,177
Come on back, girl.

10
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:04,179
WENDY and LUCY

11
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:06,012
Lu, where did you go?

12
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,917
Great dog, what's her name?

13
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,276
Lucy.

14
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,909
You're a sweetheart, Lucy!

15
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,581
What is she?

16
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:55,121
Don't know, really.
A mix of hunting dog and retriever.

17
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,557
Where's the closest
store around here?

18
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,027
I don't know.
I'm not from around here.

19
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:05,499
I'm just kinda passing through.

20
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:06,832
Where to?

21
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,970
Going to Alaska.

22
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,139
I'm headed south.

23
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:16,041
Icky over there worked
the canneries last year.

24
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,408
Hey, Icky!
This lady's going to Alaska!

25
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,578
King Salmon!

26
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,584
It's fucking awesome up there.
You going to work?

27
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,449
Where you going?

28
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,320
Ketchikan.

29
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:30,959
Ketchikan.

30
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,324
It's good for greenhorns. Cooper River
is pretty good, too. Further north.

31
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,901
Lots of work on
that slime line.

32
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,145
You should check out
Northwestern Fisheries

33
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:42,906
because their housing
is fucking awesome.

34
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:47,035
Tell Mike Murphy you met me,
because he's all right.

35
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,871
Okay, I might. Thanks.

36
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,374
The money's better there, too.

37
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,610
There's no expenses, you know?
You just walk with everything.

38
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,489
Well, whatever you do...

39
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,188
don't tell Old Man Brutus
that you met me.

40
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:07,024
Because he was a little upset when
I left in somewhat of a hurry.

41
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,496
There was this incident...

42
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,365
involving me operating
a two ton earth mover...

43
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,064
in a state slightly less than sober.

44
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,035
Some friends of mine...

45
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,606
they were goofing around...

46
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:24,042
and we got the thing started, and
I put it in gear and that was that.

47
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,084
We drove the thing
across the construction site.

48
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:30,950
Getting it to stop, though.
No one told me that.

49
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,523
So, we finally had
to jump off...

50
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,419
and the thing just rolled all the
way across the construction site.

51
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,691
We couldn't stop the thing.
We tried everything.

52
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,056
It snapped the retaining wires.

53
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,667
Huge spray of sparks.

54
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,095
The Cat went over the hill
head over heels...

55
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,331
ass over tit, right into the water.

56
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,759
It was probably a hundred thousand
dollar piece of equipment, gone

57
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:52,399
in four fucking seconds.

58
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:54,978
But they couldn't pin it
on me, man, I was gone.

59
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,433
Ferry Running Times
NORTHWESTERN

60
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,021
Good night, baby girl.

61
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,525
Wake up.

62
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:02,368
Ma'am.

63
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,282
You can't sleep here, ma'am.

64
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:14,642
You can't sleep out here,
it's not allowed.

65
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,277
Okay.

66
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,815
All right, get back, Lu.

67
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,707
My car won't start.

68
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,679
I can hear that.

69
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,420
You can't park here.
That's the rules.

70
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:53,251
Yeah, I got it, I got it, okay?

71
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,297
I don't know what it is.
It was fine yesterday.

72
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:02,528
You just gonna have
to get it off the property.

73
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,732
Well, where is that?
How far is the property?

74
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,310
Street. The street's public.
You just have to get it off the lot.

75
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:21,444
All right, jump in.

76
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,471
Lu!

77
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,473
What do you know about that...

78
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,378
station over there?

79
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,449
Seems to get business.
A lot of cars come and go.

80
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,748
He's the closest.
He's got that going for him.

81
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,918
What about, is there some kind
of grocery store around here?

82
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:03,922
Down the road there's Jack's.

83
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:07,665
Pretty good and pretty cheap.
That's where I normally go.

84
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,371
Stay, Lu.

85
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,509
Hey, Lu.

86
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:11,711
Look.

87
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,435
I know.

88
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:38,109
I know.

89
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:43,147
Okay. Be right back.

90
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,596
You're hungry, huh?
Bet you are.

91
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,459
Come on, let's go.

92
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,256
I can't shut up, I'm choking.

93
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,219
So I said, man, I ain't
staying there, I'm going.

94
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:08,956
Yeah, like one out of what?
Is there like ten of us here?

95
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,059
Found a few cans and then I
went to this place over here...

96
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,264
and laid down under a tree
and went to sleep.

97
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,596
Lu.

98
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,498
Sit here.

99
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,110
There's a long line.

100
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,511
I think some of these machines are
broken today, so it's gonna be a while.

101
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,049
Why don't you buy
her cans from her?

102
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,675
I don't have any money
to buy her cans from her.

103
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,187
But, hey, I tell you what,
I'll take those. Hey, dog.

104
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,021
I'll take those from you and
I'll give you the money later.

105
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,823
I mean, you've only got...

106
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,993
It's not many cans.
It's not worth the wait.

107
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:46,797
I'll find you later.

108
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,702
Okay, you can just take those.
That's fine.

109
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,832
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's fine.

110
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,739
Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot.

111
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,774
Yeah. That's pretty cool.

112
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,581
Don't bother anybody, okay?

113
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:03,086
Be right back with a treat.

114
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:07,580
Hey.

115
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:10,590
What did I say?

116
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:18,093
Don't be a nuisance.
We don't need that.

117
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,282
Hey, Lu.

118
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,721
- Excuse me? Ma'am?
- Let go of me.

119
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,155
- I think you're forgetting something.
- Let go of me.

120
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,717
- But you have something.
- Let go of me.

121
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:27,756
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step inside the store, okay?

122
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,868
Sit here, please.

123
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,406
What's going on, Andy?

124
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,471
This customer neglected
to pay for a few items.

125
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:45,771
I watched the whole thing. I saw
her since she came in the store.

126
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,318
No. I'm sorry,
that isn't true.

127
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,318
Okay, well, what are
we talking about here?

128
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,187
Excuse me.

129
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,456
Sir, I wasn't done
shopping yet.

130
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:08,028
I walked out of the door by accident
without paying for those cans...

131
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,956
because I was going to check
on my dog. My dog is tied up...

132
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:11,957
in front of the store.

133
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:14,034
Mr. Hunt, it was obvious
what was going on here.

134
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,976
Sir, your employee
has the wrong idea.

135
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,377
The rules apply
to everyone equally.

136
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:30,918
If a person can't afford dog food
they shouldn't have a dog.

137
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,188
Andy.

138
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:37,193
Sir, I just made a mistake is all.
I'm very sorry.

139
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,935
This isn't gonna happen again.
I'm really very sorry.

140
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:43,734
The food is not the issue.
It's about setting an example, right?

141
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:46,968
I'm not from around here, sir,
I can't be an example.

142
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,513
We have a policy, ma'am.

143
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:09,255
Hi, this is Andy Mooney
from Jack's on Lombard.

144
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,548
Sir, my dog is tied
up out front.

145
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,428
- Sir, my dog is tied up outside.
- Just relax.

146
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,364
Face forward.

147
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,275
Left. Turn to your left.

148
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,051
Can I get my bag back?

149
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,093
Not yet.

150
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,065
This machine's gonna kill me.

151
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,392
We've got to do this again.

152
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,232
Okay.

153
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,539
Fifty dollars.

154
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:10,947
Excuse me?

155
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,709
You can pay your fine now

156
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,681
or you can come back in two weeks
for a trial with a judge.

157
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,047
Then you can pay
the 50 dollars plus court fees.

158
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:24,324
I don't live here.
I'm just passing through.

159
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:26,458
If you get stopped
in another state

160
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:29,022
you're just gonna end
up right back here.

161
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:33,430
You could use a credit card.

162
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,479
Cash.

Lu!

171
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,523
Has anyone seen a dog?

172
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:09,056

I kind of remember
seeing a white van take a dog.

177
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,714
You do? What time was that?

178
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,406
Around noon?

179
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,448
Noon? You didn't
even start work until two.

180
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,847
Could have been later.

181
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:32,645
Excuse me, a white van,
like a city van?

182
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,089
I don't know.
I could be totally wrong.

183
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,660
She didn't see anything.

184
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,085
Lucy!

185
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:43,594
Lu!

186
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,434
Lucy!

187
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,675
Come here, Lu!

188
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:58,746
Lucy!

189
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:05,780
Lucy, come out now!

190
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,421
What are you doing here?

191
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:13,453
Looking for my dog. She's gone.
I hope you're real happy.

192
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,758
Lucy, come!

193
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:36,911
Lucy!

194
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,362
Come on, girl. Come on out, girl!
Come on, Lu!

195
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,223
Yeah, have a great night, okay?

196
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:58,233
You know, your son
is a real hero!

197
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,539
Lucy!

198
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,804
Come now!

199
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:09,510
Lucy!

200
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,723
Have you seen my dog?

201
00:28:57,868 --> 00:29:00,302
Not since I saw you. Nope.

202
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,838
Is that fucking
garage ever open?

203
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,680
Most days. Yep.

204
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:22,458
Is there a pound around here? There's
gotta be a pound close by, huh?

205
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,256
Not too far.

206
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,758
You all right, honey?

207
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:33,293
Yeah. I just need
to get to the pound now.

208
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,027
Well, that's easy.

209
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,507
You just take the street
right here.

210
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:43,506
Go straight down till it dead ends
that way about...

211
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,947
just right till it dead ends, then
you head right about three miles.

212
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,320
You lose your dog, is that it?

213
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,477
Yeah...

214
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,582
that's what it looks like.

215
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,387
That's a shame.
Somewhere around here?

216
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:00,955
Yeah, that store.

217
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,565
Jack's?

218
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,893
I'm sure someone's got her.

219
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,328
She couldn't have
gotten too far.

220
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,497
I was gone kind of a long time.

221
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:14,370
I'm sure it wasn't that long.
She'll turn up.

222
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:19,741
Okay.

223
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,117
So I just go down this street,
and then I take a right?

224
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:34,029
I'm pretty sure it's close now. You'll
probably have to wait until morning.

225
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,830
But you know, you can get the
number four right here on the corner.

226
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,835
It will take you right there.
Starts at six a.m.

227
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:42,098
I think I'm just
gonna head there now.

228
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,004
It's definitely closed.

229
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,575
Well, fucking Christ!

230
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,547
Well, if she's there she'll be there
in the morning, won't she?

231
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:59,145
A night in the pound
never hurt anyone.

232
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,564
You know, there's a good hotel
down the road. The Palms.

233
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,893
Really good clean rooms.

234
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,473
If I see anything
I'll let you know.

235
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:29,384
Hello?

236
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,051
Hey, Dan.

237
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:35,187
Wendy? Hold on,
let me turn down the TV.

238
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,158
Where are you?

239
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,155
In Oregon.

240
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,601
Raining?

241
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,400
Yeah, kind of, sort of.
On and off.

242
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,441
So what's up?

243
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:58,774
Nothing. I'm just calling.
Just, you know, just...

244
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:01,948
Nothing?

245
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:06,547
The car broke.

246
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:11,216
I don't know.
It's kind of bad here, actually.

247
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:15,855
Lucy's lost.

248
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,428
Who's that?

249
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,799
It's your sister.
She broke down in Oregon.

250
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:22,199
Hi Deb.

251
00:32:23,073 --> 00:32:25,667
0regon?
What does she want us to do about it?

252
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,136
Nothing. I'm just calling.

253
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,215
She's just calling.

254
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,214
We can't do anything. We're strapped.
I don't know what she wants.

255
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,681
I don't want anything.
I'm just calling.

256
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,757
I can't talk with everyone
on the phone.

257
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,485
I'll talk to you when you're
done with Dan. Bye, honey.

258
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:47,520
Everything's all right?

259
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,263
Yeah. Everything's great.

260
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:55,795
You kind of sound like you're busy
over there, so I'm gonna call you later.

261
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,635
All right, if everything's fine.
See ya.

262
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,140
Yeah, see ya, bye.

263
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,634
Lu!

264
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,210
Luce!

265
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,119
I was usually like
the only white person there.

266
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,120
That's so weird.

267
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:26,695
Why does that girl
hate you so much?

268
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:31,664
I saw the cheerleading squad. Madison's
got some chunky cheerleaders.

269
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,296
Dude, fuck,
there's a lady in there!

270
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,740
Your mom's always tired.

271
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:40,240
Yeah, my mom's like,
always, always...

272
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,817
Just a minute!

273
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,337
Good morning. Hello, Amy.

274
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,669
Hello, Mike.

275
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:20,316
What is going on
with the traffic?

276
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:25,055
Well, we have activity on Northeast 53rd
Avenue between Gleason and Irving...

277
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,383
<...so it is closed.>

278
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,207
She's medium sized.

279
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,219
39 pounds.

280
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:59,820
Yellow-gold in color.
Her name is Lucy.

281
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,951
I left her tied up to a post

282
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,022
and then when I got back
she wasn't there anymore.

283
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:07,425
Well, I don't see
anything here that matches.

284
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:11,929
But come on, let's go take a look in the
back. You never know. Okay? Follow me.

285
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,847
Okay, so you can go
right around the corner here.

286
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,913
CARROLL WENDY
CANINE FEMALE SPAYED

287
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:29,037
Okay, no address?

288
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:32,341
And no phone either?

289
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,468
No. I mean, no,
not right now.

290
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,281
I'm just passing through.

291
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:43,075
Do you have a previous address?

292
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,455
My sister and her husband.
They live at...

293
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:51,619
East, 73 East Jackson...

294
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:56,592
Muncie, Indiana, 47603.
You can use that.

295
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:59,295
Okay.

296
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,464
Do you think that
you'll find her soon?

297
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,561
Well...

298
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:07,996
you're just gonna have
to keep checking in, okay?

299
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:10,069
It's gonna be up to you now.

300
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,040
Okay.

301
00:39:14,017 --> 00:39:15,314
Thank you.

302
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,002
I don't think so.

303
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:17,071
Okay, just set the Voltmeter
to the DC scale, all right?

304
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,976
Measure the voltage
across the battery terminals.

305
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:25,384
The volt meter reads
less than 14 volts...

306
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,989
you know, it should read 14.

307
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:29,552
Okay?

308
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:33,560
If it reads less than 12
you might have a problem.

309
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:37,589
Okay, tell you what...

310
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:40,259
you turn on the heater...

311
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:42,701
you turn on the defogger...

312
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:45,600
you turn on the radio,
and you rev up the motor...

313
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:48,074
you're turning on
everything that draws power...

314
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,941
and then you turn on the
motor, you rev up the motor...

315
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:56,279
and if the Voltmeter reads
lower than 14 volts...

316
00:40:56,453 --> 00:41:01,186
your alternator's probably no
good. Okay? Well, good luck.

317
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,052
What's up?

318
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,289
Start talking, I'm listening.

319
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,160
I think I've got a problem
with my S-belt.

320
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,523
What?

321
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:16,233
With my S-belt. I think my
Serpentine belt is cracked.

322
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:18,670
Oh, yeah. Serpentine belt?

323
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,641
A guy in Salt Lake City said that
he thought it was cracked...

324
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,307
and that it would run about
150 dollars for a new one.

325
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,747
You were driving with the air
conditioning on? The engine jerked?

326
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:33,716
Steam came out?
That kind of thing?

327
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,192
No. It just won't start.
It just makes this terrible sound.

328
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:42,687
Yeah?

329
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,001
Oh, man.

330
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:49,105
You are blowing my mind.

331
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,337
You are messing up my mind.

332
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,075
Okay, I'll tell you what.

333
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,112
Yeah, yeah.

334
00:41:57,714 --> 00:42:00,274
50 on Trade Show.

335
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,485
No, that's it.

336
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:08,148
Yeah, yeah, I said, you know, you're
really messing with my mind, man.

337
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,150
Yeah, okay.

338
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,755
Yeah. I'll see you later.

339
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,826
What kind of car
are we talking about?

340
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,362
Well, it's an Accord.

341
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:25,269
1988. It's right over there.

342
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,101
Well...

343
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:29,524
Easy enough to replace
the Serpentine belt.

344
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:31,138
I don't know why
the ignition won't fire, though.

345
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:33,306
Who knows.
Could be the timing belt.

346
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:36,777
How much is a new
Serpentine belt?

347
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,383
A hundred bucks.

348
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:44,820
125. Depends if we have to order a
new one. I'll have to check stock.

349
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,563
And it'll be 50 for labor.

350
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,395
That's the best you'll find.
I promise that.

351
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:56,063
Okay. And what about a timing
belt? How much is that?

352
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:00,275
Could be a little bit more, but I
won't know until I have a look.

353
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:02,435
Okay.

354
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:07,242
And we're going to have to tow it
over, I guess. That adds another 50.

355
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,448
But it's just right there.

356
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:15,815
Well, it's always 50. But there's
no mileage here. So it's just 50.

357
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,599
30 bucks.
I'll give you a deal...

358
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,159
Yeah.

359
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,972
How's the dog?

360
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,340
No news.

361
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,713
No luck at the pound?

362
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,888
Not yet.

363
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,991
I had a Collie once that was gone for
two weeks before he came home.

364
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,794
They'll find her.
They always get their dog.

365
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,463
Yeah, I sure hope so.

366
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:46,740
Could I trade you for a quarter? I need
to use that pay phone over there.

367
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:50,040
All I've got is change
and it only takes quarters.

368
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,038
Lots of minutes. Feel free.

369
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,338
No, no.

370
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,747
No one uses a pay phone anymore.
Come on.

371
00:46:01,057 --> 00:46:02,490
Thanks.

372
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:24,311
Hi, my name is Wendy Carroll.
I lost my dog Lucy and I...

373
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:28,481
Yeah, yeah, hi.

374
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,944
I was just calling to check and see
if there was any new information.

375
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:42,861
Okay, all right, I understand. I'll keep
checking. Okay. Thank you. Bye.

376
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,853
How late are you here tonight?

377
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,979
Eight o'clock.
Eight to eight.

378
00:47:07,123 --> 00:47:07,987
Okay.

379
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:11,324
Better than my last job.
I'll tell you that.

380
00:47:12,028 --> 00:47:14,553
That was all night,
every night.

381
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:19,331
Not a lot of jobs
around here, huh?

382
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,030
I'll say.

383
00:47:21,604 --> 00:47:23,538
I don't know what
the people do all day.

384
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:28,110
Use to be a mill. But that's
been closed a long time now.

385
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:30,105
Don't know what they do.

386
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,385
You can't get a job
without an address anyway...

387
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:40,549
or a phone.

388
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,853
You can't get an address
without an address.

389
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,920
You can't get a job
without a job.

390
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:46,827
It's all fixed.

391
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:49,157
That's why I'm going to Alaska.

392
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,699
I hear they need people.

393
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,601
I hear it's really
pretty up there.

394
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,832
Yeah.

395
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,070
You know, if you need a contact
for the pound or anything...

396
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:05,739
I'm just standing here with my
hands in my pockets all day.

397
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:11,086
You can use my phone
number if you like, you know.

398
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:14,718
Yeah.

399
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:20,495
I might do that.
That'd be good.

400
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:47,417
Floppy ears sharp eyes
yellowish-brown friendly face

401
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,808
I'm L0ST!!!

402
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,512
You lost your dog?

403
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,822
Wow, bummer.

404
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,957
Wow, where did you lose it?

405
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,087
You don't know? Well, I guess if you
knew, you'd know where to find it.

406
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,528
Yeah, I guess so.

407
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:32,692
Well, that's too bad. If I see it,
I'll give you a call. Good luck.

408
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,565
Thanks. Appreciate that.

409
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,589
Lucy!

410
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:45,265
Anything?

411
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:47,139
Afraid not.

412
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:51,637
They came and rolled your
car away about an hour ago.

413
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:58,718
You know, I was remembering today,
when I was a boy I'd go hunting...

414
00:50:59,155 --> 00:51:01,055
and sometimes we'd lose the hound...

415
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,988
so my daddy would take his
coat and leave it in the woods...

416
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,891
the last place that he saw the dog.

417
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,726
And after supper he'd come
back to fetch the coat...

418
00:51:12,168 --> 00:51:15,160
and more often than not he'd
come back with the dog as well.

419
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:19,002
Could I use that phone again?

420
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,336
Sure.

421
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:23,768
Thank you.

422
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:37,320
Hello, I'm calling to check on a dog
that I reported missing. Lucy.

423
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:43,399
Yeah, sorry, I've just been away from my
phone and so I thought I would check.

424
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,027
Okay.

425
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,961
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

426
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,938
Wait.

427
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:02,216
Did you say that the dog would,
the dog came back to a coat?

428
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:03,946
Yes, indeed.

429
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,611
That's how I remember it.

430
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,090
Lucy!

431
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:47,421
Lu!

432
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:13,814
Lu?

433
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:27,796
Please, please, please.

434
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,174
Man.

435
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,215
Don't look at me.

436
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,328
This is a steep hill, huh?

437
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,157
Ain't it?

438
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:49,938
Those kids coming down
on a cardboard...

439
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:52,167
they're having some fun.

440
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,778
Of course if that cardboard
wasn't so worn and old, you know,

441
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,008
they'd slide better, right?

442
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,533
I don't like this place.

443
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:25,106
You know, it's the
fucking people.

444
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,700
The fucking people
that bother me.

445
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:30,677
God, they have attitude.

446
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:36,442
I mean...

447
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,549
I'm out here...

448
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,051
just trying to be a good boy...

449
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,422
and it's just like
they don't want to let me...

450
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,230
you know?

451
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:59,474
I mean, they treat me like
trash, like I ain't got no rights.

452
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,180
I mean...

453
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:09,411
they can smell the weakness on you.

454
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,347
Move it along, move it along.
Fuck you.

455
00:58:14,623 --> 00:58:16,682
You know? Fuck you!

456
00:58:18,594 --> 00:58:23,531
I mean, they gotta know I've killed
over 700 people with my bare hands.

457
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,770
We lost, man.

458
00:58:39,548 --> 00:58:41,641
Fuck if I know.

459
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,183
Hang on, girl.

460
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,227
I'm coming.

461
01:01:59,848 --> 01:02:01,679
You look a little stricken.

462
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:04,411
I've been here since eight.
Where have you been?

463
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:07,681
I had to take Holly's son
to school.

464
01:02:07,823 --> 01:02:09,723
It's my day off today too.

465
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:13,520
You got a call after you left
here last night. The pound.

466
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:14,785
Really?

467
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:16,720
Yes, indeed.

468
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,570
Hi, this is
Wendy Carroll calling.

469
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:34,739
I got a message from you all
last night about my dog Lucy.

470
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,622
Are you positive?

471
01:02:49,898 --> 01:02:53,026
Okay, where is she exactly?

472
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:57,765
Where the 30 meets Leaf...

473
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,475
Where the 30 meets
Leaf Erickson.

474
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:09,784
Okay, well, I'll be there right
away. Thank you very much.

475
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,485
Yep. Bye-bye.

476
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,013
All right? Good news?

477
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:18,555
Yeah. That's good news,
that's good news.

478
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,923
Great.

479
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,859
Someone took her home.

480
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,332
Someone took her home
the day she came in

481
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,413
and that's why they had
such a hard time finding her.

482
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:27,796
She's in a foster home.

483
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:32,771
Great. I told you they would find
her. Let that go on the record.

484
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:34,569
It's on the record.

485
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:38,645
So, that's it, huh?
You're gonna be pulling out?

486
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:39,974
Uh-huh, that's the plan.

487
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,648
Well, I hope it all works out.

488
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:44,080
I know it will.

489
01:03:48,957 --> 01:03:51,653
I want you to take this.
Don't argue.

490
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:53,656
Just don't argue.

491
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,524
Don't let Holly see. Just...

492
01:03:57,933 --> 01:04:02,393
If you ever come by here again,
you just stop by and say hi, huh?

493
01:04:03,405 --> 01:04:05,930
Thank you. I will.

494
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:09,533
Okay.

495
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:10,906
Bye-bye.

496
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:31,428
Ferry Running Times

497
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,460
Finally.

498
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,475
- Good morning.
- Morning.

499
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,012
You're up early.

500
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,179
You want some coffee?
I think the first pot's ready.

501
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:35,063
Yeah, Indiana plates.
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

502
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,066
Got a long way to go, too.

503
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:44,204
Well, the guy was right
about the serpentine belt.

504
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:46,406
It's cracked
all over the place.

505
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:48,533
Just a matter of time
before the car gave out on you.

506
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,507
Yeah, that's what he said.

507
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,206
He wasn't all wrong,
but he wasn't all right either.

508
01:05:53,715 --> 01:05:57,082
The serpentine belt is worn out, but
that's not why the car won't start.

509
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,186
No?

510
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,451
You've got milky oil.

511
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:05,618
I didn't ask you
to check the oil.

512
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:10,221
I'm just telling you.
Look, you snapped a piston rod.

513
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:12,212
Actually, you blew
the head gasket first...

514
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,197
water got into the cylinder
probably when you cooled it down.

515
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,064
The rod can't compress
the fluid then.

516
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:21,643
And there you go, you ended up
with what they call "Hydro lock".

517
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:27,810
And if you want the car to drive again,
you'd have to rebuild the whole engine.

518
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:30,433
Honestly, I don't think
it's what you want to do.

519
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:32,782
It would end up costing
more than the car is worth.

520
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,854
Yeah?

521
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,595
No, I couldn't get
around to it yesterday.

522
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,955
Can you call me back later?

523
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:46,858
Righto. Bye.

524
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:50,494
Are you sure?

525
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:53,130
Yeah. No question.

526
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:02,183
How much?

527
01:07:02,684 --> 01:07:03,981
To fix it?

528
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:07,151
Two thousand.

529
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:10,282
At least two thousand.

530
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,103
Like I said, more than the car's worth.
On the other hand,

531
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:14,162
it's less than a new car.

532
01:07:22,804 --> 01:07:27,741
Look, I know this is bad news. It's
not what anyone ever wants to hear.

533
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:30,266
But see, the thing is,
the car's taking up space out there

534
01:07:30,276 --> 01:07:32,309
and I need to know
what to do with it.

535
01:07:34,716 --> 01:07:37,913
I'll tell you what, just make it 30
bucks for the tow, for the...

536
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,886
to junk it, and we'll take care
of everything and that'll be it.

537
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:45,017
It's just that I can't just leave the
car sitting out there, it's gotta go.

538
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,223
Okay. This is good here.

539
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:31,661
Thank you.

540
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:26,347
Hey, Lu.

541
01:10:29,257 --> 01:10:31,521
Hey, Lu!
Did you miss me? Huh?

542
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,756
You miss me? Huh?

543
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:39,424
You miss me? Huh? Come here,
Luce. Come here. Did you miss me?

544
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:40,996
I'm sorry. Come here.

545
01:10:49,544 --> 01:10:51,034
I know, I know.

546
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:55,046
Come on, Lu, don't be mad.

547
01:10:59,387 --> 01:11:00,376
Here.

548
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,785
I got you something.

549
01:11:05,927 --> 01:11:07,394
Look at that.

550
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:10,830
Go get it.

551
01:11:11,266 --> 01:11:12,824
Good girl!

552
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:16,235
You're such a good
catcher, huh? Drop it.

553
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:18,362
Yes, such a good dog.

554
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,809
Go get it, Lu.
Go get that stick.

555
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,975
Good dog.

556
01:11:24,112 --> 01:11:25,841
You are the best catcher.

557
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,112
Drop it, Lu.

558
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,981
Lu. Lu, give me that stick.

559
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:36,989
Give me that stick, Lu.
Give me that stick.

560
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,491
Drop it. Good dog!

561
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:41,862
Good girl.

562
01:11:44,432 --> 01:11:46,400
It's so nice here, Lu.

563
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,879
That man seems nice.

564
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:12,425
Yeah, you got a nice yard.

565
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:22,531
I'm sorry, Lu.

566
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,277
I lost the car.

567
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:52,595
You be good.

568
01:12:57,105 --> 01:12:58,470
I'll come back.

569
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,069
I'm gonna make some money
and I'll come back.

570
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:11,482
Okay, Lu?

571
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:13,916
Be good.
