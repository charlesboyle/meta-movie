The white zone is for
immediate loading and unloading

00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,395

Wind 050 at 6. Go to land
on runway four-right.

7
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,982
Yeah. You live here or you commute?
I actually live here.

8
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,443
I live in a little town about an
hour north of here called Marlton.

9
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,070
I live in Denver. I came in last night.

10
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,529
You see all those
thunderstorms last night?

11
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,740
I didn't think I was gonna get in.

12
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,408
You know, I picked this up...

13
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,707
No, I haven't done it yet.

14
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,293
I'm still working on them, trying
to get certain days off.

15
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,463
And it looks like the only way I
can get it is to bid the reserve.

16
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,465
Yeah, you know, I go
back to the Training Center.

17
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,510
I have a month on, month off, so
I'll be giving check rides out in Denver.

18
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,679
Oh, that ain't too bad.
At least you should be home.

19
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,431
You cut it close today.

20
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,942
Come on through.

21
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,485
Yes. Next, please.

22
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,740
All right, go ahead.

23
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,742
Okay, please raise your arms. Thanks.

24
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,622
Just come right through.

25
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,457
All right, okay.

26
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,917
Thank you. You're good.

27
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,252
Nice flight.

28
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,087
Thank you.

29
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,925
No, that's fine. Okay.

30
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,971
She's got a crush on
that maintenance man.

31
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,807
See you later, guys. Oops. Oh, sorry.

32
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,601
I keep taking that. Damn.

33
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,020
As I go over here and build my nest,

34
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,771
you want to go outside
and do the walkaround?

35
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,939
Yeah.

36
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,067
I'll be with you in about five minutes.

37
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,278
All right. I'll be here. All righty.

38
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,384
Okay, I'll call her now.

39
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,149
Well, is it a complicated graphic?

40
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,985
'Cause if it's really... Excuse me.

41
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,036
Take care. Okay, bye.

42
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,997
...and I'll call you right back.

43
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,582
And, Kevin...

44
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,049
Drive south. We'll be there in time.

45
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,095
Did you get the word about
putting on some extra fuel?

46
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,931
Yeah. Yeah, doing it now. Okay, thanks.

47
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,029
Good morning.
Congratulations on the promotion, Ben.

48
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,114
Well, thank you very much.

49
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,448
Good morning. Congratulations, sir.

50
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,117
Well, thank you. Good morning.

51
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,161
Good morning. I'm
happy to see you all awake.

52
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,788
John. How are you this morning, sir?

53
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,456
Mr. Sliney, good morning to you.

54
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,791
You know the fellows. Yes, I do.

55
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,875
How are you? How are you?

56
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,001
Good to see you. Good to see you.

57
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,586
Good morning. How are you?
How was that midshift?

58
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,712
Rough. Yeah.

59
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,965
The floor is yours. Hold on,
and I'll see you at the 8:30.

60
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,466
Thanks, John. I'll catch up with you.

61
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,551
Yes. Good.

62
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,885
Ready for a brief? Yes, sir.

63
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,264
All right, sir, we've got a small
system in the southwest.

64
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,724
Nothing too big.
Shouldn't be a big problem.

65
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,018
Some low ceilings over
San Francisco, nothing major.

66
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,396
That system finally
moved off to the east.

67
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,981
And we've got clear skies.

68
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,649
Good. It'll be a good
day on the East Coast.

69
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,318
Yeah, what time is that fog
supposed to lift in the west? Do you know?

70
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,862
We're looking early afternoon.

71
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,155
Excellent. Excellent.

72
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,950
The President moving out of
Sarasota today up to Andrews.

73
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,161
Got restrictions in place till 10:30.

74
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,623
Standard ops in the morning,
normal morning restrictions in New York.

75
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,169
Yeah, he always wants to fly right
when traffic's the heaviest.

76
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,254
Thanks. See you, fellows.

77
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,052
New York cranking up?

78
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,345
Yes, sir.

79
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,514
All right. Good.

80
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,058
What is that? Coordinators down there?

81
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,227
That's right. It
needs to be diverted south.

82
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,104
Dallas/Fort Worth, go ahead. Yeah.

83
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,964
Can you guys hear me back there?

84
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,926
Do you guys have sugars up there?

85
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,302
Okay. Thanks.

86
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,678
Steal us a newspaper, that'd be great.

87
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,263
What'd she say the movie
was? Knight's Tale?

88
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,348
Knight's Tale.

89
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,725
Yeah, for cockpit access knock,
let's use three and one.

90
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,518
Three and one? Yeah.

91
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,603
Got you. Yup. That'll get you in.

92
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,439
Shipley and Mark do that.

93
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
I just didn't want to.
It wasn't the right time.

94
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,317
Yeah, it's Jeremy.

95
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,860
Hey, two things.

96
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:34,114
First, speaking of Shipley,
that e-mail that he sent,

97
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,534
when you respond to it,
CC me a copy of the response.

98
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,079
Isn't that sweet? Yeah,
we're getting a, you know...

99
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,581
No, don't send it
to Kevin. I'm so sorry...

100
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,418
No, it'd just go to waste on Joe.
He'd be just as happy with Ripple.

101
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,046
Ladies and gentlemen, we
will now begin boarding

102
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,757

Club passengers

non-stop service to San Francisco.

104
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,762
I will call you back. Okay, bye.

105
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,514
Any passengers requiring
additional assistance

106
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,182
may also board at this time.

107
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,811
Now boarding through
Gate 17, United 93's...

108
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,481
Hello. Give this to you?

109
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,191
Thank you. Welcome aboard.

110
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,401
Hi.

111
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,403
Good morning, welcome aboard.
How are you today?

00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,322
Excuse me, I'm gonna
follow him down there.

113
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,201
Good morning. Got your seat number?

114
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,078
Right down here on the right side.

115
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,288
Good morning, everybody.

116
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,291
And, sir, can I get you something to drink
while you're waiting for take-off?

117
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,294
Coffee would be great
with cream and no sugar.

118
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,420
Okay.

119
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,754
Good morning. Thank you.

120
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,214
Here you go.

121
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,674
Have a nice flight. Thank you.

Good morning, sir.

00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,529
There you go, have a nice flight.

128
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,494
Good morning.

129
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,746
I'm just looking for 19.

130
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,289
Nineteen? Right down this way.

131
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,457
What seat?

132
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,167
Hi. How are you? Good. How are you?

133
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,752
Good morning. Good morning.

00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,338
Hi.

Perfect.

136
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,596
Let me give you a hand with that.

137
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,806
Excuse me.

138
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:23,932
Sorry.

139
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,102
Did you talk to the guys from Sony?

140
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,897
Sounds good.

141
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,732
Good morning!

142
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,696
Looks good, Captain.

143
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,991
All right, great, thanks.
Turn the lights off.

It's Tom. Hey, what's going on?

151
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,766
Is that supposed to be the latest one?

152
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,351
Where are you?

153
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,686
Oh, good morning, sir. Hi.

Is that the last one? Last one.

00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,363
All right, great. I'll see you later.

160
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,739
I think we're ready for you to close.

161
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:21,907
Watch your hands.

00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,888
Flight attendants, arm your
doors for departure.

177
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,347
You going home?

178
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,433
Yeah. Just here for work.

179
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,851
Your seat belt, please.

180
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,060
Oh, yeah, sure.

181
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,146
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the flight deck,

182
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,648
my name is Jason Dahl and
I'll be your captain today.

183
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,358
With me is First Officer Lee Homer,

184
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,236
and together, the two of us
will fly you to San Francisco.

185
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,822
En route time today is
5 hours and 25 minutes.

186
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,867
That'll put us on the gate in San Francisco
on time or a little bit early,

187
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,244
maybe a little bit before
11:00 local time.

188
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,454
It's a beautiful day for flying,

189
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,457
and our forecast across the country
is much as you see it here.

190
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,666
In just a few moments,

191
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,795
our flight attendants will be showing you
a very important safety demonstration.

192
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,257
Whether you are a frequent flyer
or a first-time traveler,

193
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,176
I urge you to put down
your reading materials

194
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,345
and pay attention to this
very important information.

195
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,305
Thank you, and welcome aboard.

196
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,474
United 93, ops.

197
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,017
Tail north. Then clear to push.

198
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,852
Okay. Tail north.

199
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,438
Clear to push us. Start.
Okay, tail north.

200
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,190
Brakes released. Cleared to push.

201
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,961
Yeah, good morning.

202
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,797
This is Rich Sullivan with the
11:15 strategic planning telcon.

203
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,966
We're updating advisory number 23.

204
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,761
First issue, we're showing
15-minute departure delays out of Newark.

205
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,845
Give us an update there.

206
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,972
I just spoke to Pete.

207
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,057
They're gonna try and get those
reduced or eliminated.

208
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,934
They're gonna get Washington
to reduce their restrictions,

209
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,019
so probably it'll clear up
in about a half hour or so.

210
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,648
Okay, we're gonna lessen the restrictions
or eliminate them on the Newark departures.

211
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,526
And the departure delays
should be coming down here very soon.

212
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,738
Next, we got a large-scale
military exercise off the East Coast today.

213
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,741
All the offshore routes
are gonna be closed at 1400.

214
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,120
All the traffic will have to be moved
inland. Any questions on that?

215
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,915
This is JetBlue. Is Amber
761 available for offloads today?

216
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,542
Don't go for it.

217
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,252
No exceptions.
They're gonna have to wait.

218
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,336
No exceptions.

219
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,921
All the offshore routes
are gonna be closed.

220
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,715
Everyone's gonna be
moved inland. And that's it.

221
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,676
Anybody have anything else
for the morning plan?

222
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,678
Okay, we'll do the next telcon at 1315.

223
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,762
Good job.

224
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:35,684
US Air 29, contact Boston approach
on 120.6. Good day.

225
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,353
Glens Falls. After Glens Falls...

226
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,565
And American 11, climb,
maintain flight level 350.

227
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,191
Air Canada 129, Boston Center.

228
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,818
U.S. Air 129, contact Boston.

229
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,864
That's for American 11.
Climb maintain flight level 350.

230
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,409
Come on.

231
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,288
American 11, Boston. How do
you hear? Boston Center.

232
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,792
Hey, Greg? Yeah?

233
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,878
Try American 11 again.
See if he's on your frequency,

234
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,005
if he came back to you.
American 11, Boston Center.

235
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,506
How do you read?

236
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,053
American flight 11,
Boston Center. Do you read?

237
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,395
There are also two window exits
located over the wings.

238
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,148
Each exit is marked
with a sign overhead.

239
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,735
Look around to locate the
two exits nearest to your seat.

240
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,572
In some cases, the
nearest exit may be behind you.

241
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,201
In an evacuation, exit path
lights will automatically illuminate

242
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,244
to guide you to an exit.

243
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,414
A life vest is located under your seat.

244
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,542
It can be identified by a red tab.

245
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,921
Do not remove it unless directed
by a flight attendant.

246
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
Taxi clearance. Stand by.

247
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,633
We've got your release. I
want you to move up in the line

248
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,094
behind the United 757.

249
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,140
Good morning, ground. United
93, Gate 17, ready to taxi.

250
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,308
We have Alpha.

251
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:03,355
United 93, taxi runway four-left
via Bravo Romeo Bravo.

252
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,856
Hold short of Victor.

253
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,317
Roger. Said four-left
Bravo Romeo Bravo.

254
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,611
Hold short Victor. United 93.

255
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,742
And American 11 on emergency frequency,

256
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,746
if you hear Boston,
come up on frequency 127.82.

257
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,255
Am-X 7281, contact Boston on 133.42.

258
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,216
Athens, Boston.

259
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,552
Do me a favor, you got that
United 175 out there.

260
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:37,013
Can you have them take a look and see
if you can get a visual on American 11?

261
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,306
767.

262
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,686
United 175, turn 20 degrees
to your left, vector for traffic.

263
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,398
In your turn, look for traffic 12 o'clock
to 1 o'clock, about 15 miles.

264
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,401
He's tracking
south-southwestbound. Altitude's unknown.

265
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,028
It's an American 767. Let me know
if you get a visual on him.

266
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,405
Am-X 7281,

267
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,283
proceed direct O'Neill,
resume all navigation.

268
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,079
US Air 312, contact Boston on 133.42.

269
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,708
November 3622. Tango, roger.

270
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,003
Just be quiet and you'll be okay.
We are returning to the airport.

271
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,881
Call in Boston Center.
Say again, please.

272
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,510
Hey, John! Come here!

273
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,723
What's going on?

274
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,726
Aircraft, call in Boston.
Say again, please.

275
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,312
This guy here just
contacted me. I heard some verbiage

276
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:29,191
over the background. It was
not American, it was foreign.

277
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,735
They said something about
taking over the cockpit,

278
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,695
"Stay calm, we're
going back to the airport."

279
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,656
I have no idea who it was. I
think we have a hijack situation here.

280
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:37,824
What makes you think that's a hijacker?

281
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:38,950
Just trust me.

282
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,660
I heard the guy in my ear, okay?

283
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,037
I heard the guy in my ear. All right.

284
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,955
You need to check it out.

285
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,832
Command Center East. Tony.

286
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,043
Hey, Ben, we're doing a
coffee run. You want some coffee?

287
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,586
No, I'm filled up with coffee.

288
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,797
How are they doing on those restrictions
out of New York, Al?

289
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,258
Tell them they got them reduced. So La
Guardia, in fact, is now out of delays.

290
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,551
Newark's gonna stay a while, though.

291
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,303
Good job. Good job. Excellent.

292
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,721
Excellent.

293
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,057
Rich, you need to monitor this.

294
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,522
Yeah, let me take this
stuff. I got to get to the 8:30, so...

295
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,232
Command Center East. Toby.

296
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,691
Hey, Walsh.

297
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,531
Hey, Ben! Ben, hang on.

298
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,698
Yes?

299
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,452
Listen, we're just getting a preliminary
report from Boston Center.

300
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,912
They think they've got a hijacking.

301
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,080
A hijacking?

302
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,958
It's American 11. A heavy 767.

303
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,042
Departed Boston for LA.

304
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,210
Where is he now?

305
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,962
He's about 50, 60 west of Boston.

306
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,338
You got a squawk 7500?

307
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,464
No, I don't think so.

308
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,966
They heard some kind of
suspicious transmission,

309
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,217
so they're checking on it... All right.

310
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,343
It's very preliminary. All right.

311
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,763
When you get some hard information,
let me know and I'll brief the staff.

312
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,014
Thanks.

313
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,099
Did someone say "hijack"?

314
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,477
Everything okay? Yeah.

315
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,728
Good. Before we get started...

316
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,481
Well, that was a
possible hijack. American... What?

317
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,524
Yeah. Hijack?

318
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,942
Anybody remember...
Haven't seen that in years.

319
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,527
Yeah, I know. When was
the last time we had a hijack?

320
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,654
It's been quite a
while, quite a while. '91, '90.

321
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,198
I can't even remember precisely.
Yeah, I know.

322
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,993
No, no. It's Boston to LAX, American 11.

323
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,995
Yeah, they're on it and they're
gonna keep me informed.

324
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,705
I'll brief you. Okay.

325
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,875
Hey, ground. United 93.
What's our sequence?

326
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,836
United 93, follow the
Continental and Delta.

327
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,589
You're number 15 for the
departure. Monitor tower.

328
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,726
Air Canada 273, turn left...

329
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,811
Well, folks, from the flight
deck, Captain Dahl.

330
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,063
Looks like we've run into a little
bit of rush hour traffic

331
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,566
here at Newark this morning,
and that's a typical day at Newark.

332
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,818
I count 15 airplanes
ahead of us for departure,

333
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,945
and they're getting them off
about one every two minutes,

334
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,239
so unfortunately it's
gonna be about a 30-minute delay

335
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,490
until we get airborne.

336
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,993
I apologize for the delay
and I appreciate your patience,

337
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,203
and I'll get back to you
with an update. Thank you.

338
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,246
Yes?

339
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,414
Is everything okay?

340
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,959
Yeah, it's just fine. Just a
normal delay out of Newark.

341
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,587
Excuse me, can I have a pillow
and a blanket, please?

342
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,384
What did you say?

343
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,265
Guys, just keep your
planes away from him, man.

344
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,850
I have no idea what this guy's doing.

345
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:09,935
What do we have, Pete?

346
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,270
I gave all my aircraft
over to Greg already.

347
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,813
He's working them.
I'm holding onto this.

348
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,523
This guy right here
is the only guy I have.

349
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,859
He's westbound right now. I
heard some voices in my ears.

350
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,819
Flight 11, American Airlines?
But no 7500 code?

351
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,238
No, I had no 7500 code. Nothing.

352
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,786
American 11, Boston Center.
American 11, how do you hear?

353
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,038
No, see, that doesn't make sense.

354
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,001
What's up, Pete? Where are we at?

355
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,378
I just put it up into the speaker here,

356
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,214
if we hear anything back, but
right now we just have the guy.

357
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,383
He's due westbound. He's climbing...

358
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,343
I'm going back to the
airport. That's it.

359
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,511
That's it right here.

360
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,805
Somebody's got to pull
these fucking tapes right now.

361
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,848
Pull the tapes now from 0800 on.

362
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,604
To all personnel, NORAD exercise
commencing in five minutes.

363
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,695
Huntress. Weapons. Sergeant Powell.

364
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,164
Okay, and remember
this is a NORAD exercise.

365
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,459
Right now we have Russian Bears penetrating
the ADIZ up off Alaska,

366
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,004
so you'll want your tracker techs
keeping their eyes open.

367
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,881
Okay, stand by, one second.

368
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,516
Dawne, go out and see
what Powell's so excited about.

369
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,892
Yes, sir.

370
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,480
Powell, what do you got?

371
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,816
Hey, I got a hijack
on the phone. Boston.

372
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Is this a sim?

373
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,694
No, real world. Come on, where's EET?

374
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,362
No, it's a no-shit hijack. It's Boston.

375
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,405
Serious?

376
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,115
Yes. All right.

377
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,621
Okay, thanks.

378
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,712
Well, okay, give them a call.

379
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,088
Yeah, we have a possible hijack.

380
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,966
General update. Tell
them we're ready here. Okay?

381
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,092
Can do, sir.

382
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,552
Sir? Yeah.

383
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,888
We have a real world situation here.

384
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,432
We have American Airlines flight 11.

385
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,227
It's a 757 out of Boston to LAX.

386
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:20,398
Ninety-two passengers on
it, and it's at 7500.

387
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,858
Still squawking? No, sir.

388
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,568
Okay. Get Nasypany to the floor!

389
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,820
All operational personnel to the floor!

390
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:29,240
Major Nasypany, report to the
operations floor immediately.

391
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,077
All operations personnel
report to the ops room...

392
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,330
This is Colonel Marr here.
Get me General Arnold.

393
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,046
Here you go.

394
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,362
Folks, Captain Dahl
again with an update.

395
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,947
We're making some progress now.

396
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,698
We're about number four for departure.

397
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,326
I'll get with you when we're
number one. Thanks for your patience.

398
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,954
We just want to take your
order for breakfast after take-off.

399
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,622
You're gonna get it.
We have a hot breakfast,

400
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,541
which is, like, an omelet,
roll and fruit.

401
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,000
I'll take that. Thanks very much.

402
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,544
Okay, great.

403
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,381
I'm sorry for the delay. We'll be
out of here as soon as we can.

404
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,715
I understand. Thank you.

405
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,802
Would you mind bringing me some
water with my breakfast?

406
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,220
I have to take some pills.

407
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,888
Sure. No worries.

408
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,142
I'd just as soon stay out
of the more populated areas.

409
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,309
Well, here are the falls.

410
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:42,063
If we go up there, we'll be all right.
I'd like to get up in that high country.

411
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,824
Go ahead, sir.

412
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,325
Good morning, Major.

413
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,872
We got a possible hijack
in progress out of Boston.

414
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:04,085
American Airlines 757. They're
not squawking. Let's find them.

415
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,587
Copy that.

416
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,799
All right, let's go.
Listen up, everybody!

417
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,760
All right, look, we got
a possible hijack.

418
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,306
This is real world. Possible hijack.

419
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,892
Surveillance, get your tracking
techs on scopes.

420
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,643
I want two on a scope. Copy that.

421
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,478
I wanna know if he pops up again.

422
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,941
ID, get on the phones with the
FAA. Let's get his last known position.

423
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,818
Copy. Weapons.

424
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,529
Otis to battle stations. Copy that.

425
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,115
Do you have a call sign or anything?
Battle stations. Copy.

426
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,325
American Airlines 11.

427
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,827
American Airlines 11 is the call sign.

428
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,787
Sir, it's confirmed.

429
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,541
And now the aircraft is NORDO.

430
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:44,626
We get a lot of that crap.

431
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,337
Somebody's making phony transmissions
on the radio...

432
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,257
If it's not confirmed, it's
probably a lost radio call or something.

433
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,010
Command Center. Tony.

434
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,554
Stand by one second.

435
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,932
Yesterday, we had two
ground delay programs.

436
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,851
One at Atlanta and one at O'Hare.

437
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,771
And we had 850 aircraft delayed.

438
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,106
Hit a 56-minute average

439
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:11,694
and a very modest 47,600 delay minutes.

440
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,781
Benny, that is like, $2,000 a
minute we are talking about.

441
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,449
You are into a hole already for...

442
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,785
No, no, no. ...90 million bucks, Ben.

443
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,537
They're not even my delays.
I started today.

444
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,830
Ben, we need you on the floor.

445
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,582
We're getting more information
on that American 11.

446
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,918
Oh, all right.
Listen, excuse me, John... Yeah.

447
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,586
...and, folks, I'm gonna
go out and take care of this.

448
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,088
We're getting some more updates Okay.

449
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,257
And I'll brief you as soon
as I get some more information.

450
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,716
What do you got?

451
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,510
American Airlines
contacted Boston Center.

452
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,263
Apparently, a flight attendant
onboard the aircraft

453
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,849
via telephone called the
company and she said that

454
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,687
the aircraft is being hijacked and one
or more people have been stabbed.

455
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,896
Stabbed on the plane?

456
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,189
Yeah. Just confirm...

457
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,359
American Airlines gave this information
to Boston who called us.

458
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,736
Is the aircraft still on
course? The last I heard.

459
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,446
Let's get an update
from Tony. All right.

460
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,489
All right, stand by.

461
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,615
This is Boston on
the line right now. Yeah.

462
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,950
They don't know anything more.

463
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,245
There was a suspicious
transmission, the controller heard it,

464
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,456
and they're pulling tapes to see exactly
what was said on the frequency.

465
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,417
And American Airlines is
the one that called them.

466
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,627
Who is it? The ops manager
of Boston Center.

467
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:10,920
Hi, this is Ben Sliney.

468
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,131
Boston thought it may
have been a... They heard

469
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,216
some kind of oddball Yes. Transmission.

470
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,509
Right. So she called the company,

471
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,469
she said their airplane
was being hijacked...

472
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,929
All right. Has he changed altitude?

473
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,515
...don't know if it's a
person or people who've been stabbed.

474
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,933
All right.

475
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,979
All right, we're
pulling it up now, and, listen,

476
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,191
if you get any further information on
the track or the altitude, let me know.

477
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,571
All right. Keep me advised.
Thanks. Yeah. Thanks.

478
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,947
All right, look, the...

479
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:40,867
That aircraft has made a turn southbound

480
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,994
and they're not tracking him any longer.

481
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,788
They're not getting any Mode
C altitude information.

482
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:49,709
And I see our track has gone ghost on
it, but they do say he's heading southbound.

483
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,503
I want us to get in touch
with New York Center

484
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,256
and let them know he's coming. Let's
get everything out of its way

485
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,841
and even give New York TRACON a call

486
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,427
because he may be trying to head
for one of the New York airports.

487
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,595
Okay, right.

488
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,138
Information's that American 11...

489
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,848
Maybe we should get in
touch with headquarters

490
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,975
and start briefing them on this
now. Yeah, I'll call immediately.

491
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,101
Thanks.

492
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,568
Folks, Captain Dahl with some good news.

493
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,070
We're currently
number one for departure.

494
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,529
We'll be airborne shortly.

495
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,699
Flight attendants,
prepare for take-off, please.

496
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,286
You know, I try and drop
as many trips as I can.

497
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,581
I like to be home with my babies. Yeah.

498
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,749
Yeah.

499
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,251
Did you bring some good magazines
to keep yourself awake?

500
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:37,006
I don't think I've gotten through a magazine
in I can't tell you how long.

501
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:45,306
We have some planes. Just stay
quiet and you'll be okay.

502
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,683
We are returning to the airport.

503
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,733
We have some planes. Just stay
quiet and you'll be okay.

504
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,819
We are returning to the airport.

505
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Planes.

506
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,087
We have some planes.

507
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:26,722
Yeah, it's Bob here.
It's "planes." Planes. Plural.

508
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:27,974
Definitely, yeah.

509
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,443
United 93, wind 050 at 6.

510
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,154
Runway four-left.
Clear for take-off.

511
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,450
010 up to 5,000. Clear for take
off. Four-left. United 93.

512
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,035
010, 5,000. Here we go.

513
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,697
Welcome to New York Center.
Altimeter is 2996.

514
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,366
Maintain speed 310...

515
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,659
...speed of 300 knots or greater.

516
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:14,872
Maintain flight level 220 and
maintain a speed of 300 knots.

517
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,875
Roger, you got it.

518
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,505
New York. Thumbser.

519
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,299
Yeah, Boston.

520
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,306
New York. United 175.

521
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,483
All right, thank you.
I got it. All right.

522
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,029
Hey, Dave? Yeah?

523
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,864
American 11 looking
as a possible hijacking.

524
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,408
It may be going back
into Kennedy. Hijack?

525
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,534
They say they heard something,

526
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,160
that there might be intrusion
into the cockpit.

527
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,412
All right, just let me know
if you hear anything,

528
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,746
anything unusual or anything.
I'll watch him.

529
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,248
He's not squawking 7500.

530
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,749
So just keep it normal.
No, he's not doing anything.

531
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,875
I'll keep an eye on him. I got it.

532
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,752
Just keep an eye on him. Will do.

533
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,256
What's going on? We got a hijack.

534
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,633
It might be a hijack, I don't
know. It's American 11.

535
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,010
It's going down. You got a hijack?

536
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,636
We haven't had a hijack in
20 years. I don't know.

537
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,346
Listen, I don't know. What
do you want me to tell you?

538
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,890
I just gotta watch him. That's all.

539
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:17,351
Chris, you got that? Thumbser.

540
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,396
United 175 heavy, New York, go ahead.

541
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,984
...west of Kennedy by 15
southbound descending, it's American 11.

542
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,445
We're not sure what the problem is yet.

543
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,488
Possible hijacking, we're not sure.

544
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,284
Passenger said something
about they're up front.

545
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,786
Roger, United 175 heavy.
Well, I'll pass it along.

546
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:36,912
Wait, I'll talk to him. Paul!

547
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:37,955
Hold on. Paul,

548
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,290
United 175 heavy just called.

549
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,500
He said he heard a
suspicious transmission on the radio

550
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,835
as he was climbing out of Logan.

551
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,464
He said something about, "Everybody
stay in your seats."

552
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,507
He doesn't know who it came
from, but it came out

553
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,009
and he said it was...

554
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,219
He just heard it as he
was climbing out... United 175?

555
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,888
United 175 heavy, yes.

556
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,307
And what about American 11? American
11 's still... It's nothing.

557
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,933
He's just still going slow, you know.

558
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,227
He might be going into Newark
or Kennedy or something,

559
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,647
I don't know. You know, I have no idea.

560
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,491
Continental 1002, Newark
Tower. Good morning.

561
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,330
Why don't you try the next one down?

562
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,707
An arctic fish. How about "char"?

563
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,129
Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Dahl.

564
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,465
As we make this turn, those of
you on the left side of the airplane

565
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,135
have a beautiful view of lower Manhattan
and the New York City skyline.

566
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,804
Looks nice out there. Huh?

567
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,681
Looks nice out there.

568
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,818
What do you mean there's no one
there? Well, you guys must have a backup.

569
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,362
Whatever information they got,
they got to give it to us right away.

570
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,530
All right, good.

571
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,157
Hijack controller, no
one at the desk. No backup.

572
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,826
Looks like they're
on vacation. No backup?

573
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,327
There's no backup.
There's no one at the desk.

574
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,579
Who were you talking to downstairs?

575
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,206
I'm talking to this guy.

576
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,917
He's in the conference room.
There's nobody else in there.

577
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,044
I'm relaying the information,
and then he's moving...

578
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,589
We got it. We got the tapes. Boston
Center got the tapes pulled.

579
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,758
They said, "We have some
planes." Hold on.

580
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,677
That's what he said,
"We have some planes."

581
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,387
That was the suspicious transmission.

582
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,888
Was there any voice recognition?

583
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,640
I'm tracking it.

584
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,183
Jesus Christ.

585
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,147
Med Express 77, maintain 10,000.

586
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,690
The Kennedy altimeter's 2996.

587
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,150
Keep an eye on it. Now watch.

588
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,278
Delta 351, altimeter 2992.

589
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,530
Chilean 4369, New York altimeter, 2996.

590
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,407
Paul, what do you got? Hey,
Mike, how you doing?

591
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,244
American 11. Possible hijacking
on American 11.

592
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,456
He's southbound, 767.
Nobody's talking to him.

593
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,125
I just called the room up
and let them know about it.

594
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,918
They're not tracking
him either, right now.

595
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,378
Where was the target last time?

596
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,464
Last time it was tracked
in New York at Kennedy.

597
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,549
He's heading for the south.
American 11, New York.

598
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,759
What do you want me to check?

599
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,265
Target's gone.

600
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,186
Paul. Paul, the target for American
11 just disappeared.

601
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,605
Just disappeared where?
Right around Manhattan.

602
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:08,773
It just disappeared?

603
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:09,857
It was right there. It just disappeared.

604
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,318
I was talking to the other
aircraft. The target just disappeared.

605
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:15,613
Call Kennedy up. Find out if they have it.
We don't know where American is, all right?

606
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,573
Call Kennedy tower up, see
if they have him down there,

607
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,325
and call Newark tower and
see if they have him there.

608
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,534
Okay.

609
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,954
What do we got, boys? Anything?

610
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,290
All right, sir, you need me to
go ahead and start a recall for you?

611
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,416
Yes, initiate that.

612
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,751
Okay, great.

613
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,796
What's the status with Otis?
Are those planes ready?

614
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,839
Foxy, what you got? You got anything?

615
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,550
MCC, battle stations call made 0838.

616
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,220
Otis attained battle stations at 40.

617
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,097
08? Colonel, 0840,

618
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,183
slams at battle stations.

619
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,519
Otis at battle stations. Copy.

620
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,271
Get me something. Nothing's squawking.

621
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,233
MCC, Boston lost American 11.

622
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,984
They don't see him anymore
on their scopes.

623
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,403
They think maybe he went
below radar coverage.

624
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,988
They have no idea where he is.

625
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,658
We've got Otis. Have the battle ready.

626
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,868
We need scramble authority.

627
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,161
Copy that.

628
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,997
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

629
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,707
Copy that.

630
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,085
Okay, let's get those
Otis birds in the air!

631
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,628
Scramble Otis!

632
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,339
This is Huntress with an active
air defense scramble.

633
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,341
I repeat, active air defense scramble.

634
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,177
Time is 0846.

635
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,764
I authenticate November-November.

636
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,811
Greg, look at the
World Trade Center. What?

637
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,565
Look at the Trade
Center, man. Bob, you see that?

638
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,693
Man, that's a lot of smoke.

639
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,111
I can't believe that.

640
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,534
Yeah, take a look at the
World Trade Center.

641
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,911
No, I have no idea.

642
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,873
I'm getting reports from numerous
aircraft about smoke in Manhattan.

643
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,249
A lot of smoke.

644
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,877
A lot of smoke coming
out of the North Tower.

645
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,797
Thumbser, go ahead.

646
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,800
The American was over Manhattan

647
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,052
A small plane? Is that
confirmed? When I lost any sign of...

648
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,055
Ben, I just got...
New York called. Yeah?

649
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,932
They got smoke out of
the World Trade Center.

650
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,350
Smoke? They think a small plane

651
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,102
A small plane? Has crashed into it.

652
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,186
Small plane. I don't know.

653
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,271
That's what they're telling me.

654
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,189
A small plane went
into the World Trade Center.

655
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,191
You might want to have a look. Okay.

656
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,569
Sir.

657
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,990
CNN's reporting a light civil
aircraft has just hit the World Trade Center.

658
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,242
MCC?

659
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:29,288
MCC, CNN has just reported a light aircraft
has hit the World Trade Center.

660
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,374
Bill, get me CNN up on
screen three, will you?

661
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,792
Ben? Yeah.

662
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:34,919
New York Center called.

663
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,921
They were tracking the
primary target, they've lost it.

664
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,672
They said they'd lost American 11.

665
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,424
Where did they lose it at?
Somewhere over the city.

666
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,550
Over the city? Yeah.

667
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,052
He's down over the city? They don't know

668
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,637
if he's under the radar
coverage out there or not.

669
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,264
All right. Get in touch with the metro
towers, see if they got a visual.

670
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,766
Hey, it's coming up now.
I'll call TRACON, see if...

671
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,267
Jesus. Oh, my...

672
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,686
We're getting reports
this morning, that a plane

673
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,357
has crashed into one of the towers
of the World Trade Center.

674
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,485
CNN Center right now is just beginning
to work on this story.

675
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,863
Obviously calling our sources and
trying to figure out exactly what happened.

676
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:07,409
But clearly something relatively devastating
happening this morning there

677
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,495
in the south end of
the island... I don't know.

678
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,956
I'll tell you what, that
is not a small plane. No way.

679
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
It's huge.

680
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,167
A Cessna would have bounced off that.
Look at the size of that hole!

681
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,418
Look at all them people sitting...

682
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,421
I got a bad feeling about this.
I'll tell you right now.

683
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,799
Is that American 11? Is that
who they were tracking?

684
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,759
Nobody's telling us
anything. No info. I have no info.

685
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,595
Well, which way are we
looking here? If we're looking...

686
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,682
It looks like the sun's on that side of
the building, so we're looking north.

687
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,559
He came from our left. He
had to come from the west.

688
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,895
That aircraft came in from
the west into that building.

689
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,981
Who could it be?
Now where's American 11?

690
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,483
You know what I want you to do?
Get in touch with the NYPD.

691
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,319
See if they have any information on
what caused that in the Trade Center.

692
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,696
Look at the size of that explosion.

693
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,157
Sean, you're on the air right now.
What can you tell us about...

694
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,492
And, folks, Captain Dahl.

695
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,036
We've reached our
cruising altitude of 35,000 feet

696
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,455
and I'm going ahead and turn the
"Fasten Seat Belts" sign off.

697
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,499
That is your signal you are
safe to move about the cabin.

698
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,917
We got the seatbelt sign off.

699
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,043
However, when you are in your seats

700
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,378
I'll ask you to keep your
seatbelts loosely fastened,

701
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,964
as you never know when we'll
get some bumps we're not expecting.

702
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,675
Our flying time today again
is 5 hours and 25 minutes,

703
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,760
and in spite of that
short delay back there in Newark

704
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,722
I'm still projecting an
on-time arrival in San Francisco.

705
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,307
I'll update you on the weather
as we get a little closer.

706
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,309
In the interim now, I'll ask
you to sit back and enjoy

707
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,562
the outstanding service of
our fine flight attendants.

708
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:19,732
If there's anything we in the cockpit can
do to make your ride more enjoyable,

709
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,108
please don't hesitate to ask.

710
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,526
Thank you.

711
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,413
Hey, can I get a copy of the manifest?

712
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,539
Oh, sure.

713
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,332
Thanks. Here you go.

714
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,417
I appreciate it.

715
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,543
Yeah, no problem.

716
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,503
Looks pretty good, huh?

717
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,047
I love these light loads.

718
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,381
I do, too.

719
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,510
I knew you were gonna say
that, so I've planned.

720
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:49,887
We've got...

721
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:53,474
We have reservations there.

722
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,726
And there.

723
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,438
Fedex 7852, we heard it was a small plane
that hit the World Trade Center.

724
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,773
That's the last that we heard. Roger.

725
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,026
Eagle 755, you
contact departure on 126.8.

726
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,737
I gave you that Eagle
755 also, okay? Another one?

727
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,531
Yeah, Eagle 755. 755. Got it.

728
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:13,368
Toggle 9445, you
contact approach on 120.8.

729
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,120
Chris, I need you to
take this one also. Got it.

730
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,873
Hey, Dave, you got an untracked target
five miles east of Allentown.

731
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,916
Thank you.

732
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,836
United 175, I need you to
reset your transponder squawk 2374.

733
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,218
United 175, New York.
You read the radio?

734
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,471
Call American 11 again.
I'll try him again.

735
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,348
Paul, neither airport had
one. Maybe... He must've landed.

736
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,891
Newark heard nothing from
him, Kennedy heard...

737
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,392
Try the towers again. I'll try again.

738
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,770
He's gotta be somewhere.
He's gotta go somewhere.

739
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,939
United 175, New York. If
you read the radio, ident.

740
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,357
Traffic's 9 o'clock and seven.

741
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,944
Southwestbound Delta Boeing
73, same altitude.

742
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,531
United 175, New York.

743
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,950
United...

744
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,411
Paul, United. I think we got another
one. The guy has dropped his transponder off.

745
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,705
United 175, New York.
He's out by Allentown.

746
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,165
United 175. Thumbser.

747
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,710
If you have United 175, you need to
switch him back to... The traffic room.

748
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,213
No, I'm not talking to him. I'm
not talking to him. I know.

749
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,632
Delta 2433, stand by.

750
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,135
I can't take any more airplanes.

751
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,304
He's busy enough. We'll take care
of it. We'll take care of it.

752
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,640
We'll take care of it. They're
standing by, right now.

753
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,810
Watch that Delta 2315. He's
aimed right at him. The same altitude.

754
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,770
He's starting to get close
to him. You see that?

755
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,438
Please.

756
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,649
Give me a chance to
work. Just stay back!

757
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,360
Just give me a chance
to work here, all right?

758
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,113
United 175, New York,
if you read the radio,

759
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,824
you have traffic at your 9
o'clock and four miles southwestbound,

760
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,492
same altitude. It's a Boeing 73.

761
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,995
I'm telling you this is another
hijack. I'm telling you.

762
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,331
United 175, traffic is
your 9 o'clock in five miles.

763
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,083
Jesus. Do you have that Delta?

764
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,962
Delta! Delta 2315, traffic 2 o'clock!

765
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,048
Five miles, southeastbound, 757.

766
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,009
Traffic, three miles.
Turn him. Turn him.

767
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,510
1 o'clock! Turn to one and a half.

768
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,387
Heading southeastbound. 12 o'clock now!

769
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,597
No distance! He's right on top of you!

770
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,098
I'm telling you right now.
This is another hijacking.

771
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,435
Delta 2315, he's right on
top of you. This is a hijacking.

772
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,159
Delta 2315, you still there?

773
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:25,959
That's a roger, New York. We
are clear. Delta 2315. Over.

774
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,628
Paul, he just went behind him.

775
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,046
Holy shit. Good. Good.

776
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,131
Good job, sir. Good job.

777
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,635
She was sitting inside her apartment,
and she looked up and saw the side

778
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,595
of the World Trade Center...
All right. Thank you much.

779
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,597
...explode into flames and black smoke.

780
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,599
Excuse me. If they hijacked them...

781
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,685
New York Center says they got
confirmation that it was a commercial airliner

782
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,395
that hit the Trade Center.
Well, that's it.

783
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,065
That was American 11.
It had to be American 11.

784
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,652
What the hell is going on?
But how could he hit the building?

785
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,863
I mean, why would he hit the
building? Even if it is American 11, why...

786
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,324
It's clear and fifty. You
don't get a pilot flying a plane...

787
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,076
Either they're gonna
ditch it in the Hudson...

788
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,286
They're not gonna do this.
There's no way. No way.

789
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,622
Jesus, how many people
are in that building?

790
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,500
Ben? Ben?

791
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,961
I'm sorry, New York Center wants
you on the phone right now.

792
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,837
Yeah. Yes, New York.

793
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,133
Wait a minute, hold on. They
think they got another hijack,

794
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,551
and it's headed for New
York. Another one?

795
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:17,803
We got another hijack?

796
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,138
All right, United 175.
Get him up on there.

797
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,473
How many people are in that building?

798
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,724
Where is that military liaison?

799
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,185
Can somebody help us out?
We need some help here.

800
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,354
We're trying to get
the military involved.

801
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,689
We can't get anybody at headquarters.

802
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,901
All right, listen, you take care of
your house, we'll take care of this business.

803
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,028
Okay. Let me know if anything
else develops.

804
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,156
United 175, and it's
headed straight for New York.

805
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,368
United 175, New York. United 175.

806
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,245
United 175, New York.

807
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,290
United 175 here. This guy's at,
like, 10,000 feet a minute,

808
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,749
and he's still going down.
I heard. I heard.

809
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,668
United 175, New York.

810
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,505
This guy's dropping like
a manhole cover now, Paul.

811
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,259
He's still descending eastbound
towards New York.

812
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,012
This aircraft is going down,
I'm telling you right now.

813
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:01,221
Call the military up.

814
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,639
Find out where they are. Okay.

815
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:03,724
Are you listening to me?

816
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,018
This guy is going straight down
into the ground, I'm telling you.

817
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,227
He's not answering me.

818
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,313
We're not talking to
him. He's descending.

819
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,897
It's like 6,000 to
8,000 feet a minute now.

820
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,817
Dave, you still not
talking to that guy? No, I'm not.

821
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,070
He's going right through
everybody else's traffic.

822
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,532
The target's gone. It's gone.

823
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,909
The target's gone. The target's gone.

824
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,414
We don't have him anymore.
We just lost him.

825
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:31,752
All right, hold on. Hold on.
I got a primary on a target.

826
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,795
Where? He's rapidly descending.

827
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,464
Can you see that right here?

828
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,716
He's coming down
quick, yeah. Can you see that?

829
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,925
Well, who is it?

830
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,052
I don't know.

831
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:42,095
You see him out the window?

832
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,347
I don't know.

833
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:44,765
Is he out there?

834
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,433
Yeah, descending rapidly.

835
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,559
No, there he is. There he is.

836
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,436
Where? Right there.
Over the Verrazano Bridge.

837
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,897
Oh, yeah. Look how fast he's going.

838
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,774
No, he's going right up
the Hudson River center.

839
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:54,941
Oh, my God.

840
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,115
Jesus! Shit!

841
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,408
What? How does he do that?

842
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,286
There was then an explosion
inside... Damn it!

843
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,373
The building's exploding right now!
You got people running up the street!

844
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,041
I don't know what the hell is going on.

845
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,877
Did you see that? Did you see that, sir?

846
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,964
I'll have to call you back.

847
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,383
Oh, my God.

848
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,176
American, stand by.

849
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,597
Holy shit!

850
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,265
Jesus Christ.

851
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,156
Be advised there's a major
incident over New York right now.

852
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,159
Shawna, what do you got?
What do you got, Shawna?

853
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,994
Boston said that...

854
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,417
Boston just said they have
another hijacked aircraft. United 175.

855
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,877
Copy that. We've got another hijack.

856
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:59,005
We've got two hijacks.
175, also out of Boston.

857
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,091
Are they... Does Boston... Is...

858
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,427
Get on with FAA. Who was that?

859
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,512
There's no confirmation, sir.

860
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,265
MCC, we need our planes over Manhattan.

861
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,183
We need those Otis birds
over Manhattan now.

862
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,019
You got it! All right, weapons! Weapons!

863
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,067
You want any sugar in your coffee?

864
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,193
I'm fine for now, thanks.

865
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,362
What would you like to drink?
I'm glued to this.

866
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,030
Coffee or juice?

867
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,616
Yeah, I'll take some coffee. Hi, guys.

868
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,535
You know, I'm gonna
serve you guys after first,

869
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,787
'cause there's only six, if that's okay.

870
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,747
It was a beautiful take-off.

871
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,459
So you're still okay with the hot?

872
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:38,420
All right, well, then, we'll
bring you something to drink after that.

873
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,547
Yeah, it's like football
with no padding. Here you go, sir.

874
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,215
Hope you all enjoy this.

875
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,468
And I'll be right with you, guys.

876
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,074
And here we go. All right.

877
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,701
Why don't we turn
this around? Thank you.

878
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:10,869
If you could help me. Thank you.

879
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,037
Yeah, that would be great. Thank you.

880
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,622
Thanks a lot. Enjoy.

881
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,353
New York Center wants everything
stopped going to their airports and through...

882
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:39,022
All right, Tony, issue a ground
stop for New York Center.

883
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,982
Nothing goes into New York Center.

884
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,443
Got it. At least the first
tier on that. Yeah.

885
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,531
In fact... Hey, you know what?
Let's stop Boston, New York,

886
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,366
and then maybe stop Washington, too.

887
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,077
Yeah, whatever's necessary.
Just get them stopped now.

888
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:55,455
I don't want any more planes
on their frequency taking off.

889
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,625
Boston, we have no confirmation...

890
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,709
Copy type and tail.

891
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,295
Foxy!

892
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,799
I'm hearing about another hijack.
Keep your ears open.

893
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,717
Too much traffic. We can't
get the clearance.

894
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,386
That's not acceptable.

895
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,679
They're not giving it to us.

896
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,765
If you need to, get on the
line and get the clearance for them,

897
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,725
but don't take that from them.

898
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,852
Where are those Otis planes?
Are we over Manhattan yet?

899
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,646
What's going on? MCC.

900
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,648
What's the status on Otis, Foxy?

901
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,692
We're still trying
to get a clearance, sir.

902
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:27,237
We're getting no clearance from the FAA
to get those birds over Manhattan.

903
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,863
What do you want me to tell weapons?

904
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,199
Screw the FAA. Send those
Otis planes now.

905
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:33,076
Get them over Manhattan.

906
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,955
He says forget about the FAA.
Get those birds over Manhattan now.

907
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:48,508
United 93, Cleveland
Center. Good morning.

908
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,512
United 93, Cleveland Center,
119.7. Good day.

909
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:55,765
You have the aircraft.

910
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:56,850
I have the aircraft.

911
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:08,612
Hi. Breakfast, guys.
Here's one with juice.

912
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:09,654
Thank you.

913
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,531
I'm bringing the other one
with coffee in one second.

914
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,866
Thank you very much. Enjoy,
guys. See you later.

915
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,950
Thanks, Deb. See you in a bit.

916
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,994
What do you need over here?

917
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:23,543
But you know, with girls I can't, I
could never, you know, I couldn't control...

918
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,343
As soon as I get on the ground,
I'll give her a call.

919
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,511
You have kids? Yeah, I do.

920
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,930
I have a 11 -month-old
daughter.

921
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,726
Eleven months. How's that? You
getting any sleep at night?

922
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,729
She's finally beginning to settle down
now, so everything's looking good.

923
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,316
My anniversary's coming up, I'm
taking my wife to London for a couple days.

924
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,361
Well, that should be good. Yeah, I've
been to London a couple times.

925
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,154
You know, we're gonna do the usual.

926
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:55,075
A little sightseeing, do a
couple plays and just kind of get away.

927
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,952
I've got Otis in the air,
and two more at Langley.

928
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,829
Four planes. That's all I've got.

929
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,707
I'm gonna need some support.
I'm gonna need more planes.

930
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:07,170
I've got Otis headed to Manhattan and...
No, the FAA is giving us problems.

931
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,465
All the other fighter planes that
are on the East Coast. Oceana.

932
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,342
No, I sent them anyway.

933
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,886
Right now, Langley's
sitting at battle stations, sir.

934
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,262
Copy that.

935
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,014
Okay. MCC!

936
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,893
Boston is telling us
American 11 is still in the air.

937
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,062
What? American 11 is still in the air.

938
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,730
We don't know who those planes are.

939
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,066
American 11 is still
flying? Headed towards Washington.

940
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,150
God damn it!

941
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:32,153
All right, surveillance, we got
American 11, heading towards Washington now!

942
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,573
Let's go. I want you to light up
every track south of New York over Jersey.

943
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,867
Colonel. Colonel. Hang on. Hang on, sir.

944
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,035
Yes, go, MCC.

945
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,329
Boston is saying that American 11

946
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,541
is heading towards Washington
now. That it's not one of the flights

947
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,377
that went into the Trade Centers, but
it's heading towards Washington.

948
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,212
We gotta scramble those
Langley birds right now.

949
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,297
What the fuck? Hold on, sir.

950
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,967
Scramble Langley.
Scramble Langley to Washington.

951
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,010
Scramble Langley, weapons. Copy that.

952
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,054
Scramble them to Washington.
Scramble Langley.

953
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,890
No, we just got a report.
We're getting bad stuff from the FAA.

954
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:04,561
Bad stuff from the FAA all around.
They just told us that 11 was still flying.

955
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,229
We thought 11 went into the tower.

956
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,482
All parties acknowledge
with initials. Command posts.

957
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:13,194
Tower. Approach. Giant Killer.

958
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,280
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Here's what I want.

959
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,073
I want you to contact all the centers.

960
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:20,076
I want to know about any
aircraft that they deem suspicious.

961
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:24,789
There's NORDO or lost
transponder, off-course, change altitude.

962
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:28,084
And let's get it on that board down there
and start sharing this information.

963
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,836
Particularly with the military.

964
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,588
Where is that military liaison?

965
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:35,049
Go get him. Yeah, tell him
I need to speak to him now.

966
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,596
Indy Center just called. They're
missing an American 77.

967
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,431
They lost it 25 minutes ago.

968
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,558
It deviated off... American 77.

969
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,478
American 77. Out of Indianapolis Center.

970
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:49,731
They said that he lost his transponder
after he turned off-course.

971
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,276
We got an American 77 out of
Dulles, lost the transponder.

972
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:56,821
All right, I need... I want
last-known position, speed and altitude.

973
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:59,282
I want it in his track. I
want to know where he's heading.

974
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,451
We just had two go into the city.

975
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,996
And, you know, anything is suspect now, especially
if he's heading toward the city.

976
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,998
I need last-known position and track.

977
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,959
All right, do you know
who that second airplane was?

978
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,628
Okay. If you find out, let me know.

979
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,798
Boston's tracking
another one, Delta 1989.

980
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:18,134
He's another
Boston-to-LAX, 767.

981
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:19,511
Right now he's on course.

982
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:22,430
They are talking to him, but
they're very concerned about that flight

983
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,766
because it's the exact
same profile as these last two.

984
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:29,145
All right, so listen, fellas. I want you to
get a ground stop out across the nation.

985
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,272
I don't want anybody else
coming into our airspace.

986
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:34,025
How many have I got airborne
now? 4,000 or 5,000.

987
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,485
Huh? Between 4,000 and 5,000.

988
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,029
4,200. 4,200? Jesus Christ.

989
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,156
All right, no more
departures anywhere. You got that?

990
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,326
Call Boston. Call Cleveland.
No more departures.

991
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:48,414
Copy. Boston-to-LA and
that's Delta 1989, suspected hijack.

992
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:52,252
Eagle flight 248,
contact Cleveland Center, 134.6.

993
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:58,550
John, there's a suspected hijack
from Center at Boston, all right?

994
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,343
I need you to confirm
when you can, all right?

995
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,929
Let me know if you
hear anything. Delta 1989.

996
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,931
I'll let you know. Soon as I can.

997
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,017
United 93, Cleveland Center. Go ahead.

998
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:12,605
Cleveland Center, United 93.
Level 350. Still have that light chop.

999
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,367
"Beware cockpit intrusion."

1000
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,370
"Two aircraft hit
the World Trade Center."

1001
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,582
But we just left Newark.
The weather was beautiful.

1002
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,208
That's gotta be student pilots.

1003
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,086
I'm gonna... Let me just confirm this.

1004
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,755
What have you got? Do
we have anything on 11?

1005
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,132
You're spotting nothing?

1006
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,051
Come on, guys. Beat the bushes. Where
is this guy? What's he doing?

1007
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,305
I got two F-16s ready to turn
and burn toward Washington.

1008
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,056
I need to know the ROE, sir.

1009
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,684
Sir, what do you want me to do
when we intercept American 11?

1010
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,604
Do we give them nines in their
nose, sir? I need to know that.

1011
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,564
If we engage, when do we engage?

1012
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,400
How do we get the authority
to get... Colonel, I need to know

1013
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,236
with these Langley birds what I'm
gonna do. Rules of engagement, sir.

1014
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:01,738
Do we shoot this flight down?

1015
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,324
How high up do we have to go? SecDef?

1016
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,493
Vice President?

1017
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,288
The President has to make
the call. Yes, sir.

1018
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,415
Sir, I need rules of engagement.
What do I do, sir?

1019
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,499
Yes, sir. Hold on.

1020
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,752
MCC, I'm on with CONR right now,

1021
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,254
requesting clarification
for rules of engagement.

1022
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,300
Yeah.

1023
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,177
We'll let you know
when Langley's airborne.

1024
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,055
Yes, sir. ID type and tail. Yes, sir.

1025
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,099
All right, thank you, sir.

1026
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,436
We have no shoot-down authority.

1027
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,939
No shoot-down authority at this time.

1028
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,983
It is ID type and tail.
ID type and tail.

1029
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:43,363
Shoot-down authority comes from
the President and the President only.

1030
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,449
How long is it gonna take
to get that authority, sir?

1031
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,576
Where the hell is the liaison?

1032
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:51,079
Boston's stopping.
Boston's already stopped their...

1033
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,163
Good.

1034
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,290
You gotta work the military on this one.

1035
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,709
Colonel, listen. We got
a bad situation going on.

1036
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,963
I need you to do everything you can
to get these lines of communication open.

1037
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:03,257
We got at least two planes
into that goddamn building.

1038
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:06,094
We got multiple situations
going on. We've given you people...

1039
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:09,347
Listen, I know it's not your job to do
this, but you've gotta do what you can.

1040
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:13,977
We gotta get jets on every one
of those aircraft on that board.

1041
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:17,271
Are you in direct contact with the Pentagon
or are you talking to some liaison?

1042
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:18,481
No, no, no, I'm talking to them.

1043
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,943
They understand the gravity of the
situation. I'll give you the best update I can...

1044
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,945
No, I need action is what
I need. I understand.

1045
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,571
I need action. I understand.

1046
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,033
Exactly.

1047
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,578
And long, long quarters
with hardly any breaks.

1048
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:34,414
And, yeah, it's...

1049
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,334
You take out all your aggression

1050
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:41,629
and all your, you know,
all your shit for the day.

1051
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,259
I think golf is pretty
much all I'm up for now.

1052
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,303
Yeah? Well, not like you have
time for anything else.

1053
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,807
You know, but you can make time, though.

1054
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,100
No, you're right.

1055
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,645
You're absolutely right. That's
why I had to... I mean...

1056
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,649
When I left school, I knew I just
had to continue rugby in some way.

1057
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,359
So there were...

1058
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,903
There was, like,
this league that started.

1059
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:09,866
It's kind of like a city league.
It's kind of my outlet.

1060
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,484
Would you like anything to drink?

1061
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:45,610
No. I'm fine, thank you.

1062
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,070
Sure? Yes.

1063
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,679
There you are.

1064
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:55,763
Thank you.

1065
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,265
Have a nice morning. Thank you.

1066
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,894
Excuse me.

1067
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,729
Here you go, sir. Thank you, my dear.

1068
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:04,814
You're welcome.

1069
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,118
Not having breakfast?

1070
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,870
No, thank you. I'm gonna
go to sleep in a minute.

1071
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:19,996
A little early?

1072
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,665
You wouldn't have any Scotch
you could put in there, would you?

1073
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,584
Lt'd be $4. No, I'm just kidding.

1074
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,669
Thank you. You're welcome.

1075
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,004
Thank you.

1076
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,088
Care for coffee?

1077
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,256
Oh, yes.

1078
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:46,480
And, you know, you're
coming up the Jersey Turnpike.

1079
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,691
And I'll tell you, New York was like,

1080
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,985
it was like Emerald City, you know?

1081
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,111
Yeah. Beautiful.

1082
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,779
It was beautiful.

1083
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,199
The sun coming up behind the buildings.

1084
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,143
Time for a drink, even for dinner?

1085
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,228
Yeah, sounds great.

1086
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:19,448
We've got three kids at home, so that's
a full-time job right there.

1087
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,415
And you wanted the hot breakfast, right?

1088
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,710
Everything okay here? Good.

1089
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,950
He's got a bomb!

1090
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,000
He's got a bomb!

1091
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,543
Get back! Get back!

1092
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,919
What's going on?

1093
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,588
Move! Don't stop! Go! Go!

1094
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,644
Open the door. Open the door
and nobody will be hurt.

1095
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,855
Jesus Christ. Go! Go!

1096
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,820
Sit down and fasten your seat belts!

1097
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:41,030
Do it!

1098
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,282
No, no.

1099
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,409
You want to get that?
You got the aircraft?

1100
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,119
I have the airplane.

1101
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,623
Go! Go! Go!

1102
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,504
Get out of here, get out of here! Mayday!

1103
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,131
Get out of here!

1104
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,216
No!

1105
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,428
Tom.

1106
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:07,640
He started to scream, and somebody said,
"Get out of here, get out of here."

1107
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:23,114
No!

1108
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:03,028
No! No, please, no!

1109
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,655
Jesus Christ.

1110
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,616
There's a guy who got stabbed.

1111
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,826
He what? They stabbed this guy.

1112
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:53,329
In first class, they stabbed
him. It's the truth.

1113
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,789
Who is that? There's a
bomb, there's a man with a bomb.

1114
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,666
What? And they have stabbed a passenger.

1115
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,668
Oh, my God! Where's Debbie?

1116
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:03,130
The men took her. They
took Debbie. They grabbed her.

1117
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:04,465
Where is Debbie?

1118
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,842
They're taking over the
plane. They took Debbie.

1119
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:07,968
What?

1120
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,890
United 93, air traffic for you is
1 o'clock, 12 miles eastbound 371.

1121
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,854
United 1523, did you hear somebody,

1122
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,898
did you hear some other aircraft
on the frequency here?

1123
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,107
Fuck!

1124
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,526
Anything?

1125
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,920
United 93, Cleveland.
Verify your altitude.

1126
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:51,136
United 93, Cleveland. How do you hear?

1127
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,644
United 93, Cleveland.

1128
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,941
United 93, Cleveland.
Verify your altitude.

1129
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:07,820
Tom, I'm getting no response out of
a United 93. No response at all.

1130
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,572
Ninety-three? Correct.

1131
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:10,656
All right.

1132
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,660
Delta 1989, Cleveland
Center, 2249. Good day.

1133
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,038
Delta 1989, roger.

1134
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,833
Hey, Tom. Delta just
called in. He sounds good.

1135
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,543
This guy here? I
don't think it's a hijack.

1136
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,712
He took a turn of a 330 heading.
It doesn't matter.

1137
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,589
They said he was hijacked.
They placed a phone call.

1138
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:28,632
Keep working him, all right?
I'm just telling you.

1139
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:29,967
I don't know if we have one or two,

1140
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,511
but I know he is descending on
his own without a clearance.

1141
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,597
Wait a minute. Delta. What about Delta?

1142
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:38,767
Delta's answering. Delta's fine so far. The
only one I don't have is the United 93.

1143
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,603
He's not responding, and he is...

1144
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,189
He was descending on his own.
He appears to be climbing now.

1145
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,775
Cleveland just called.
There's a United 93,

1146
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,944
the controller heard screams
coming from the cockpit.

1147
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,779
Sounds like the American 11. Jesus.

1148
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,449
This is starting to look like a pattern.

1149
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,492
Where was that aircraft
last known? Do you know?

1150
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:56,869
Which way is he heading?

1151
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,495
We gotta get track information
on these guys.

1152
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,332
He was a Newark-to-San
Francisco flight. He's still on course.

1153
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,876
All right, get all the adjacent
centers. Notify them.

1154
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,169
In every direction.

1155
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,504
And keep me advised on flight 93.

1156
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:10,799
Hey, Ben? Ben? Delta's
fine. He's not a hijack.

1157
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,509
Cleveland just called.
Delta's not? Good.

1158
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:15,179
Take him off the board. Delta 1989.

1159
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:19,808
Yeah. Yes, sir. Four planes.
That's all I've got.

1160
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,812
I can't defend the whole
Eastern Seaboard with four planes.

1161
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:24,938
What do you got?

1162
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,192
Washington's on the phone. They said
they've got American 77 lost.

1163
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:30,861
He just went missing, out of Dulles.
He's supposed to go to LAX.

1164
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:31,987
This is another one?

1165
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:34,114
What? What did she say?

1166
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,491
American 77 coming out of Dulles

1167
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:36,992
heading west, going to LAX.

1168
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,744
Light me up every
track, guys. What do you got?

1169
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,622
I don't know how many more there could be
in the air, sir, but the point is this.

1170
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:44,083
We've gotta get them before they're
within range of Washington.

1171
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,834
We gotta get them
before they're 60 miles,

1172
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,795
50 miles minimum, or
we're not gonna have a play.

1173
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,421
We're not gonna be able
to protect the Capitol.

1174
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,110
Come on. Come on, guys.
Answer it, please, answer.

1175
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:14,363
Oh, my God, there he
is. He's on the floor.

1176
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,864
We need something to bandage him with.

1177
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,950
Anybody a doctor? Medic?

1178
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,201
She's an EMT.

1179
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,661
She's an EMT.

1180
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:26,959
I keep trying to call the cockpit.
I can't get through.

1181
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,503
I need you to move over.

1182
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,213
What is going on?

1183
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,468
Okay. Okay.

1184
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,233
Oh, come on.

1185
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:57,239
United 93, do you hear Cleveland
Center? Ident, please.

1186
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:16,300
Yes, I did, 797, and we
couldn't tell what it was, either.

1187
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:19,762
Okay. United 93, Cleveland.
If you hear the Center, ident.

1188
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,518
I got you.

1189
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,613
Hi, my name is Sandy Bradshaw.

1190
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,616
I'm on United flight 93
from Newark to San Francisco.

1191
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,244
The airplane has been hijacked
by three guys with knives.

1192
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,873
One of them's got, like, a bomb
strapped around his waist.

1193
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,336
How many did you guys see? Three.

1194
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,798
She thinks there were three. You were
sitting in first class, right?

1195
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,300
They said there were... They saw three.

1196
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,886
No, they stabbed a first
class passenger.

1197
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:04,097
Thank you.

1198
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:05,224
Did they answer?

1199
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,726
What did they say? They couldn't
tell me anything.

1200
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,520
They didn't tell you anything at all?

1201
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:11,271
It was just the maintenance department.

1202
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:15,234
I got through to United. I got
through on the maintenance line.

1203
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,946
I told them that the plane was
hijacked. I mean, I don't know what else to say.

1204
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,072
I don't know what to do.

1205
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,950
He didn't tell us anything!
He's a maintenance guy!

1206
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,044
No, no, no! You back!
You back! You back!

1207
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,968
Okay. Sit! You!

1208
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:46,765
Ziad!

1209
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:56,108
You heard that also? Yes, sir. Twice.

1210
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,778
Roger. We heard that also. Just wanted
to confirm it wasn't from interference.

1211
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:02,281
Victor, 956. Victor, 956, go.

1212
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,576
I wanted to answer your call.
We did hear that yelling, too.

1213
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,994
Copy that.

1214
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,122
I think we're turning.

1215
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,588
Wait. We're turning. Are we turning?

1216
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,048
That means it's all right. It's okay...

1217
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,676
We're gonna go back to the airport.

1218
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,387
They're going to ask for ransom. What?

1219
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,471
I hope so.

1220
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,975
In 1977 in Mogadishu, they
asked, you know, for money.

1221
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,269
They will ask for ransom.
They will let us go.

1222
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,896
We're going back to the
airport, all right?

1223
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,188
We're going back to the airport.

1224
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,065
They're trained to deal
with this situation. Okay?

1225
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,360
And they'll get us down on
the ground, all right? Okay?

1226
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:44,406
I'm a pilot. I've been flying all
my life. But it's... I just...

1227
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,742
What? Something's wrong here.

1228
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,161
We're okay.

1229
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,586
Anybody know where 77 is?

1230
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,713
Cleveland Center was the
last one to talk to United 93.

1231
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,840
Cleveland Center is the
last one who spoke to United 93.

1232
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,425
But what about the military
response on this?

1233
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,136
I'm talking to them now. I'm
letting them know where we are with this.

1234
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,262
Listen, you got to get somebody...

1235
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:08,597
Where are they when we need them?

1236
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:09,932
...down the hallway to talk to them.

1237
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:12,142
They are supposed to be
liaisoning with the military.

1238
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:15,354
And I've got this colonel here,
he's not giving me the answers I need.

1239
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:18,190
We're giving you the best we can,
sir. The best information I've got.

1240
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,317
We're trying to get this
CAP established over New York.

1241
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,944
I don't give a shit about the CAP!

1242
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,112
Listen to me. I've got
a board full of planes.

1243
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,908
American 77's missing!
United 93 another suspected hijack.

1244
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,576
Where are those fighter
jets? Are they...

1245
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:32,955
You've got to get them into position
to do something about these aircraft.

1246
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:35,123
We've got Selfridge on
the command post right now.

1247
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,626
They've got two jets that can
fly from Alpena right now.

1248
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,920
Get them on frequency. Hand
them off to that. Copy that.

1249
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:41,672
What do you got, Foxy? What do you got?

1250
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,632
We got two F-16s out of Selfridge,

1251
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,134
Chevy flight, airborne,
coming to our freq now.

1252
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,387
They're unarmed, but
that's all we've got. Copy that.

1253
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,472
We're gonna need more support
and I've got to know, sir.

1254
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,391
When they get there, what can they do?

1255
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,017
...for a real world military mission.

1256
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:56,103
I understand it's a commercial
airliner, sir.

1257
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,854
There will be casualties. But what...

1258
01:11:57,939 --> 01:11:59,773
Think about what happens
if they hit the ground.

1259
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,818
Think of what... If they
hit the Capitol, sir.

1260
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,778
Go ahead, MCC. Go ahead, go ahead.

1261
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,823
We got two F-16s coming out of
Selfridge, but they're unarmed.

1262
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,950
But how many more are out
there? That's the question.

1263
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,453
We've got a report of at least
one more. May we engage?

1264
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:17,332
I think we shouldn't provoke them.

1265
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:18,583
Just do what they want.

1266
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,253
And then they'll land and let
us go and let the authorities...

1267
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,379
Shouldn't somebody try to talk to them?

1268
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,880
The police, they'll take care of them.

1269
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,007
Give them what they want.

1270
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:27,009
Maybe we can negotiate with them.

1271
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,280
Quiet.

1272
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:35,243
Just listen to me, sweetie, I want
you to call the authorities...

1273
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,537
I'm calling from the Airfone.

1274
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,625
You believe me, don't you, Mom?

1275
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,504
Did he stab him?

1276
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:53,887
We got to go up there.

1277
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,103
Just take us back to the airport...

1278
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:03,313
It's all right. It's just us.

1279
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,525
Let us see the passenger.
Just the passenger.

1280
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:09,986
Richard, it's Jeremy.

1281
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:15,367
I'm on the plane. Let me talk to Lyzzie.

1282
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,248
Okay... You.

1283
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,042
There's the passenger he stabbed.

1284
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,127
Okay. Okay.

1285
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,088
Okay. We're just checking the passenger.

1286
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,798
Did you contact the pilot?

1287
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,718
No, nobody said anything. We can't
get through to the cockpit.

1288
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,262
We can't get through.

1289
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,307
Okay, okay, okay.

1290
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,560
Sir, okay. Okay, sir.

1291
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:46,273
We're United flight 93. We've been hijacked.
There's three men with knives.

1292
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:50,193
One of them has a bomb
strapped around his waist.

1293
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,626
See if he has a pulse. Is he breathing?

1294
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,922
No, there's nothing. There's nothing.

1295
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,177
Ahmed.

1296
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,188
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1297
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:28,190
You've got to come back
here. What is it?

1298
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,900
Come back here, come back here. What?

1299
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,444
Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1300
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,280
Oh, my God.

1301
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,868
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1302
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,204
Stewardess, what's happening
up there? What is happening?

1303
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,414
This is awful. Listen...
What is happening?

1304
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:47,667
Just... We're going back to the airport.
Everything's gonna be fine.

1305
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:49,127
Call the pilot. Listen...

1306
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:50,378
I don't know.

1307
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,464
We're just finding out
what we can find out.

1308
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,966
Get back here. Get back here.

1309
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,552
Listen, listen, listen.

1310
01:15:57,637 --> 01:16:00,889
Listen! The pilots are on the ground.

1311
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,391
That was the pilots. They're
on the ground outside the cockpit.

1312
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,893
They're on the floor.

1313
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,228
She saw the pilot what?

1314
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,897
What? What did she say?

1315
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:12,150
The stewardess just said the pilots
aren't flying the plane.

1316
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:15,779
She saw two bodies in front
of the cockpit on the floor.

1317
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:21,117
They said they saw the pilot
and the co-pilot on the floor.

1318
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,494
Oh, Jesus.

1319
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,292
Flight United 93, call in.

1320
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:49,145
MCC? Cleveland is saying that Delta
1989 is considered a hijack.

1321
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,523
They're considering Delta 1989 a hijack.

1322
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,776
We got Delta 1989,
suspected hijack, heading west.

1323
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,028
Hit me up every track.
Did you copy that, sir?

1324
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,531
Two planes? Yes.

1325
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,866
This is a second plane, sir, coming in.

1326
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:06,538
We got the one going west out of
Boston, and American 11 coming into Washington.

1327
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,456
We still got the Selfridge planes, sir.

1328
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,542
Yes, sir. These guys are not armed.

1329
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,794
These fighters are not
armed, and we could ram...

1330
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,381
If we ram them and eject, sir. Do
we have the authority, though?

1331
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:21,052
Just spoke to Cleveland, they said
that US Air 2619 was headed towards Chicago.

1332
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,013
They've just evacuated the Sears Tower.

1333
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:24,472
Jesus Christ!

1334
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:26,808
United 93 is now reported as NORDO.

1335
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,728
No transponder, and now
heading eastbound, over Cleveland.

1336
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,313
Let me know what the hell is going on.

1337
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,189
Six miles southwest of the White House,

1338
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:35,525
Boston Center's tracking
a primary moving fast.

1339
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,277
Call Dulles tower.

1340
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,778
Give me this again. Give me this again.

1341
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,823
Can you get me some
verification on that?

1342
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,075
Sir, we have a VFR aircraft

1343
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,495
southwest of Washington,
headed straight in now.

1344
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,164
Sir, I got another flight
coming up south.

1345
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:50,623
We have a plane headed
toward the Capitol.

1346
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:51,750
I got an unidentified plane...

1347
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,836
Yes. I need to know about
the ROE. Can we engage?

1348
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,797
I want you to give me a
30-mile circle around Reagan National.

1349
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:00,216
Right now, you hit me up
every track on every aircraft.

1350
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,635
Do we have any communication
with the President at all?

1351
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,012
Where are the fighters?

1352
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,597
How long can that take?

1353
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,015
Air Force One's taken off.

1354
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,726
They don't know anything about
it. They don't know where he's going.

1355
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,519
Ben, they're evacuating the White House!

1356
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:12,854
All right, thanks, Carol.

1357
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:13,938
They're evacuating it right now.

1358
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,274
Hey, are we gonna get an
intercept on this, though?

1359
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:17,442
Okay. Good!

1360
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,070
Go get yourself out of
your chair and go down...

1361
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:22,614
There's no coordination between
what NORAD has and what we have.

1362
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,407
You know where they're headed.

1363
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:25,492
Just get the fighters up there!

1364
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,912
How about the Vice President, sir? Do we
have a location on the Vice President?

1365
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,581
Well, then the Vice President
can make the call.

1366
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:34,209
The Vice President can make
the call. We can engage.

1367
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:35,502
Holy shit.

1368
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:39,381
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. What's the
ETA on those Langley birds?

1369
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:40,673
Foxy!

1370
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,175
Spiders are airborne at 0930,

1371
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:45,345
but they brought them out on an
eastbound heading rather than our northbound.

1372
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,263
We're gonna get them turned
as soon as possible.

1373
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:49,391
What the fuck? They're what?
They're heading east?

1374
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:52,435
What the hell is wrong out
there? Why are those planes off-course?

1375
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,106
It looks like they came out on a standard
scramble heading instead of the one I gave.

1376
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,066
We're trying to get clearance
to turn them now.

1377
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,442
How the fuck did they get out there?

1378
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:00,693
I don't know, sir.

1379
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,654
What the fuck are they doing
out over the water?

1380
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:06,074
I don't care, God damn it, if they
break windows, you turn them back over land!

1381
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,368
Roll quad sevens. Turn them
towards Washington now.

1382
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,328
Keep looking for him.
Keep looking for him.

1383
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:13,623
It was a plane that crashed
at the Pentagon.

1384
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:16,084
And the Pentagon is being evacuated.

1385
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,587
There is a large fire there,
and that is the smoke you see

1386
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,923
in the shot that you are looking at now.

1387
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,009
Whether that fire is in
the building itself or outside,

1388
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,429
we have not yet confirmed.

1389
01:19:27,555 --> 01:19:30,390
There is a fire on the
Mall in Washington.

1390
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:34,769
The cause of the fire in the Mall
in Washington, we cannot yet tell you.

1391
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:36,062
Oh, my gosh!

1392
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:37,272
Foxy! Sir.

1393
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,441
I want those Langley
birds over Washington.

1394
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,776
...that two planes have
crashed into the World Trade Center.

1395
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:44,070
Surveillance, I want you to
hit up tracks west of Cleveland...

1396
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,448
Get back into position.
...heading towards Las Vegas. Hit up.

1397
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,783
Light me up every track
you've got. Let's go.

1398
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:51,911
Let's go, let's go! Let's keep
going here! Let's keep working!

1399
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,538
ID, what do you got? All right,

1400
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:56,249
he's off-course, he's deviated,
and we don't know why.

1401
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,918
Confirmed. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1402
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:00,295
Confirmed hijackings.

1403
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:03,506
That's the question.
What are we going to do now?

1404
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:06,301
There's a lot of confusion here
at the Pentagon. It appears that

1405
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:10,263
something hit the Pentagon on the
outside of the fifth corridor,

1406
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:11,764
on the Army corridor.

1407
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:15,935
Several Army officers I talked
to reported hearing a big explosion.

1408
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,480
Listen, I'm not taking any more chances.

1409
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,565
We got stuff flying around
we have no control over.

1410
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:24,152
And I don't want a board full of these
planes hitting every building on the East Coast.

1411
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:27,322
This is a national emergency.
Everyone lands, regardless of destination.

1412
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:28,615
That's gonna cost billions.

1413
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:29,699
Just do it!

1414
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,493
We have hundreds of international
flights coming in.

1415
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:32,911
They're already in the air.

1416
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,997
No. No, I don't want any more international
flights crossing the borders.

1417
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,665
They'll have to go back
where they came from.

1418
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,417
Nobody's coming into
the country from now on.

1419
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,793
Everyone? Everyone.

1420
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:43,963
Shut off the East Coast. Shut off
all the internationals from Europe.

1421
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:46,508
Shut off South America,
shut off the West Coast,

1422
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,884
nothing over the top, either.

1423
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:48,968
We're gonna call Canada on that?

1424
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:50,053
Yeah, Canada, too.

1425
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:51,179
We're gonna shut down the airspace.

1426
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:52,472
No, I can't exempt anybody.

1427
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:53,932
Nobody comes in, and nobody takes off.

1428
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,808
Land them all. Take a moment.
Think about this.

1429
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,852
We're gonna shut down
the entire country right now?

1430
01:20:57,937 --> 01:21:00,438
That's right. Listen, we're
at war with someone,

1431
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,858
and until we figure out what to
do about it, we're shutting down.

1432
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:05,485
That's it. We're finished.

1433
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,695
...can handle the emergency situation.

1434
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,411
I don't know.

1435
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:17,747
I don't know what to do.

1436
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,084
Does anybody know about the pilot yet?

1437
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:22,544
They don't know.

1438
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,295
No. They don't know.

1439
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:27,840
What?

1440
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:33,304
Two planes hit the World Trade Center.

1441
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,723
What?

1442
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:38,935
In New York. The World Trade
Center. Two planes.

1443
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:43,940
My wife says that there was an explosion
at the World Trade Center.

1444
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,400
What did he say?

1445
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:49,404
Tell the stewardesses two
planes hit the World Trade Center.

1446
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,573
Two planes hit the World Trade
Center. Tell the stewardesses.

1447
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:52,740
What about the five planes?

1448
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:53,992
Someone pass that back.

1449
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:55,243
Just a second. Right.

1450
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,538
It doesn't make sense. Are you
sure you heard that right?

1451
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,456
Two planes just hit
the World Trade Center.

1452
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,625
Two planes have crashed
into the World Trade Center.

1453
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:04,836
What are they doing?
What are they doing?

1454
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,297
Two planes just hit
the World Trade Center.

1455
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,340
Two planes hit the World Trade Center.

1456
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:11,843
What did he say?

1457
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,262
I don't know. I didn't hear.

1458
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,097
It's on the news.

1459
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,890
It's on the news.
Yeah, it's on the news, yeah.

1460
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,267
Where are you guys hearing this?

1461
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,811
Somebody from up there
said it. Ask up there.

1462
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,606
Sandy, take her back, take her back.

1463
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,441
It's airplanes.

1464
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,525
They bombed the World Trade Center?

1465
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:31,779
One after the other
hit the World Trade Center.

1466
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,198
Lyzzie, is it... It's
planes. It's not a bomb.

1467
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:35,950
It's two airplanes. It's not a bomb.

1468
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:37,619
It's airplanes. What?

1469
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,412
It's one after the other.

1470
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:42,540
One after the other
hit the World Trade Center.

1471
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:45,293
Airplanes, one after the
other, hit the World Trade Center.

1472
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,711
Where did this... Who's hearing this?

1473
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:47,879
Where did they come from?

1474
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,255
He said it was on the news?

1475
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,465
I'm on line with my wife.

1476
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:53,259
Are you hearing this? What'd they say?

1477
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:56,721
Two planes hit the World
Trade Center. Is that right?

1478
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,724
Do they mean prop planes?

1479
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,559
Whose planes? What airline?

1480
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:03,102
Is it United?

1481
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:06,522
Okay, sweetie, I will call
you back, I promise.

1482
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:09,901
I just talked to my wife. Two
planes have hit the World Trade Center.

1483
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,695
There are five jets
that have been hijacked.

1484
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,822
Are we one of them, or are we the sixth?

1485
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,574
Lyzzie, Lyzzie, Lyzzie.

1486
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,244
Lyzzie, not the Trade
Center, right? But the...

1487
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:24,165
Into the Pentagon. It's on the news.

1488
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,043
It's on the news, yeah. There was an...

1489
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,506
There was an explosion at the Pentagon.

1490
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,341
Just tell them that. That's all we know.

1491
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:36,719
Hey, listen, there was an
explosion at the Pentagon.

1492
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:40,098
An explosion at the Pentagon.
Not a fire, an explosion.

1493
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:49,691
United 93, I understand you
have a bomb onboard. Go ahead.

1494
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,613
Executive 956, did you understand
that transmission?

1495
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:59,242
Affirmative. He said there
was a bomb onboard.

1496
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:04,455
Executive 956 turning 180.

1497
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,209
Executive 956.

1498
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,294
American 1060, do you
see anybody northwest of you?

1499
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:11,796
Can you see back that far there?

1500
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,548
Do you have a visual on him now?

1501
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:14,882
Got him. We're looking now, sir.

1502
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,050
United 93, Cleveland.

1503
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:19,971
United 93, call in.

1504
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,806
United 93, United...

1505
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,987
Put your seat belts on!

1506
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,578
Oh, my God!

1507
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,367
We're okay, we're okay. No, we're okay.

1508
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:27,413
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1509
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:32,376
Hey, this is a suicide mission.

1510
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:36,130
We have to do something. They
are not gonna land this plane.

1511
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:37,965
They are not gonna
take us back to the airport.

1512
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,926
I don't think there's any
other option we have.

1513
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,385
If we're gonna die, we're gonna die.

1514
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,346
They're flying us into a
building. We're gonna die.

1515
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:44,514
We should not interfere with them.

1516
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,808
There's a lot of us,
but we gotta do something.

1517
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,643
You see how low we are?

1518
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:51,521
Is there a weapon? Is there
something we can use?

1519
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:53,981
Go back. You go back.

1520
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,983
Stewardess, listen to
me. Are you listening?

1521
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,109
I'm listening.

1522
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:59,946
Go back and you get
everything you can...

1523
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:04,158
You get every weapon you can.
Get whatever we can use as a weapon.

1524
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:05,576
But what are we gonna do?

1525
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,830
We don't... I... We'll figure
that out, but get every weapon we can.

1526
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:11,040
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1527
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,501
Okay. Okay.

1528
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:14,836
Go get it. Get everything you can.

1529
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,630
Okay, we need every big
guy. Every big guy.

1530
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:21,509
Every big guy. Luggage.
Luggage. We need weapons.

1531
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,804
Get back here. Get back here.
Get back here. Okay.

1532
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,848
We need to boil water.

1533
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,224
For what? We gotta get water?

1534
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:29,851
We gotta get weapons.

1535
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,687
Promise me that Emmy

1536
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:35,106
is going to know

1537
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,652
that I just love her very much.

1538
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,196
What else can we use? What else?

1539
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:44,699
Wine bottles. Forks, knives.

1540
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,952
The guy that I was sitting in front of said
that he doesn't think the bomb is real.

1541
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,120
That's all I know.

1542
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,538
He's on his way back.

1543
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:01,215
Come up with a plan, I'm gonna
calm the other passengers

1544
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:04,802
and we'll go along with whatever
plan you come up with.

1545
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:06,679
You've gotta...

1546
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:07,763
Sit down. Sit down!

1547
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:09,473
Oh, God.

1548
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,392
So, what do we do? What do you have?

1549
01:27:11,476 --> 01:27:13,227
We got the forks, knives, hot water...

1550
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,437
Hot water...

1551
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:15,897
Yeah, I gave him the fire extinguisher.

1552
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:16,939
Just let them go.

1553
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:19,066
Hey! Sit! Sit! Just let them
go. Just let them go.

1554
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,192
Hey, come on.

1555
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:25,489
Okay.

1556
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:27,658
They have a bomb!

1557
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,289
Do you really think he'd get
a bomb onboard this plane?

1558
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:35,666
Yeah, that guy in front of you said
he didn't think it was real.

1559
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,251
I know. That's what I think, too.

1560
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,879
How does he get a bomb
onboard this plane?

1561
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:45,843
Jack, are you there?

1562
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:50,431
Wake up, sweetie.

1563
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,686
Okay.

1564
01:27:57,064 --> 01:27:58,898
I just want to tell you I love you.

1565
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:00,942
We're going back to the airport.

1566
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:05,196
I love you. I gotta
give the phone to Linda now.

1567
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,700
Bye, Dad.

1568
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:18,626
I just love you more than
anything. Know that.

1569
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,127
I, well...

1570
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:25,800
Please tell my family I love
them, too. Bye, honey.

1571
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:30,221
Please give my love to Mom and Dad.

1572
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,848
And I really, really love you.

1573
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:35,309
My safe is in the bedroom in the closet.

1574
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:38,646
The combination is 302 and 0913

1575
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:42,108
and it should open. My will is inside.

1576
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:15,516
I'm trained in hand-to-hand,
I'm trained in judo. So...

1577
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,643
Okay. So we go up right behind you.

1578
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:18,686
We have to go very fast.

1579
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:19,770
Okay. Absolutely.

1580
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:23,024
And I'm gonna... I don't give a
fuck if that thing is real or not.

1581
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:26,944
I'm going to get his arm, I'm gonna get
his arm and I'm gonna break his arm.

1582
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:30,031
We need a plan. We need a plan.

1583
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,699
We're gonna do something.

1584
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:32,825
Ahmed. Ahmed!

1585
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,535
What is he doing? Oh, my God.

1586
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:35,911
Hey, no talk!

1587
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:36,996
So what...

1588
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:39,957
Hey! You!

1589
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:42,877
What is it? What?

1590
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:44,545
Stop! Somebody else?

1591
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:48,466
Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh, my God.

1592
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:51,010
Okay.

1593
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:53,179
Just stay calm. Just stay calm.

1594
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,139
You guys are all right?

1595
01:29:56,183 --> 01:29:57,933
Sit! Sit!

1596
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,810
Hey, sit! Sit!

1597
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,315
Oh, my God!

1598
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,233
Get your seat belts on!

1599
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:10,654
You're not supposed to be able
to see the ground that low, are you?

1600
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,615
No, and not this fast!

1601
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:15,201
Hello? 911?

1602
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:16,994
911.

1603
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:19,830
Yes, hijacking in progress.

1604
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:24,293
I'm in the bathroom. United flight 93.

1605
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:27,338
Yeah, I love you, too, Fred.

1606
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,382
Goodbye.

1607
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:38,140
You call your people.

1608
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:39,683
Oh, Christ, it's not real. I understand.

1609
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:41,268
It's not real, so I
can handle it myself.

1610
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:42,937
Go for the detonator first.

1611
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:46,941
How do we get into the cockpit door?

1612
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:48,067
Breakaway panels.

1613
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,276
Just take him down.

1614
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:50,361
You go after me...

1615
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,987
Absolutely. ...but you go fast. Listen.

1616
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:54,949
I'm listening! But we need to
know who's gonna fucking fly the plane!

1617
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:56,700
Go for his throat! What?

1618
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:58,285
He said he could fly!

1619
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,162
He said he can fly! He can fly a plane.

1620
01:31:00,247 --> 01:31:01,539
Listen, I think we might have a pilot.

1621
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:03,290
They said there's a pilot onboard!

1622
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,626
We got a pilot. What? Who? Who?

1623
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,045
Which one? This guy right here.

1624
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,548
Down there. Third row.

1625
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,466
On the right. Third row, third row.

1626
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,718
Okay! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

1627
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:16,846
You were a pilot? Yeah.

1628
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,931
I mean, a single engine,
I mean, you know?

1629
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:20,641
Right. Right, right.
You can fly this plane?

1630
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:23,185
I don't know. I mean, I'll try. Okay.

1631
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:24,979
'Cause we're gonna get you up there.

1632
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,815
I understand. That's why
we've gotta do something right now.

1633
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:29,483
You got a plan? Come on!

1634
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:31,527
Now, we're gonna take you up
to the front of the plane.

1635
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,904
You can come up behind us. Okay.
If you can get me in there,

1636
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,824
I think I might be able to land it,
but I need a lot of help from the ground.

1637
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:39,618
I can talk you down. I can talk
you down. I did eight years ATC.

1638
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,370
Okay. You did? Listen.

1639
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,914
When you get me in there,
you've gotta get ahold of the controls,

1640
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,625
because if he does anything sudden,
we don't have enough room,

1641
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:50,421
to pull out of it. Okay? You gotta
get him off the controls.

1642
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,257
What the fuck is he doing? I don't know.

1643
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,426
Okay, there's a pilot.
We've got to get the pilot.

1644
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,179
We have to do something, right?
I mean, he's all over the place.

1645
01:31:58,263 --> 01:31:59,388
I understand.

1646
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:00,514
We are alone up here.

1647
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,934
Nobody is going to help us.
We've got to do it. Okay?

1648
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:15,821
Who is the pilot?

1649
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:16,989
I don't know.

1650
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,742
Hi, Mom, it's me.

1651
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:24,872
I'm on the plane that's been hijacked.

1652
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:28,792
I'm just calling to tell you

1653
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:32,671
that I love you, and goodbye.

1654
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:39,261
This really kind woman handed me the
phone and she said to call you.

1655
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:44,683
If I don't make it out of this alive, will you
please promise that you'll call my family?

1656
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,562
Thank you.

1657
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,025
Just tell them I love them.

1658
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:57,446
Tell my wife and my boys
that I love them.

1659
01:32:57,822 --> 01:33:01,825
Here, take these. There's more.
Pass these along. Here.

1660
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,373
Who is the fucking pilot?

1661
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:08,874
In the brown shirt.

1662
01:33:08,959 --> 01:33:12,878
Phil, Phil, it's me. I've been
on a plane that's been hijacked.

1663
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,759
Listen, a bunch of
the guys have got together

1664
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:22,304
and they said that we're gonna, like,
try and take over the plane.

1665
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:26,558
But, baby, I promise you, if I get
out of this, I'm quitting tomorrow.

1666
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:28,852
I'll quit tomorrow. I promise,
I'll quit tomorrow.

1667
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,522
And tell my babies I love them.

1668
01:33:55,714 --> 01:33:58,882
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1669
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,343
hallowed be Thy name.

1670
01:34:01,428 --> 01:34:03,053
Thy kingdom come,

1671
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,806
Thy will be done On Earth
as it is in heaven.

1672
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:08,976
And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

1673
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,613
I don't want to be here.

1674
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:24,783
Baby, I don't want to be here. Baby...

1675
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:31,498
We're gonna break into the cockpit,
and we're gonna fly it.

1676
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,500
No, it's gonna be okay.

1677
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:42,509
I love you, too.

1678
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:45,637
You guys, come on, let's go, let's go.

1679
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:53,729
Come on, guys, what are we waiting
for? Let's roll. Come on. Let's go already.

1680
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:55,814
No messing around, boys.

1681
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:57,232
We got no choice, no choice, no choice.

1682
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:58,567
Oh, Jesus, let's go.

1683
01:34:58,651 --> 01:34:59,902
Get yourself going. Come on.

1684
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:12,289
Hey!

1685
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,130
Go!

1686
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:29,598
Get the bomb! Get the bomb!

1687
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:31,058
Saeed! Ziad!

1688
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:38,107
Get the bomb! Get the bomb!

1689
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:50,285
Get his thumb off the trigger!
Get his hand, get his hand!

1690
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:51,829
Get the bomb!

1691
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:05,676
I got it! I got it!

1692
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:08,679
It's a fake! It's a fake!

1693
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:12,891
The bomb's a fake! It's a fake!

1694
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:05,569
Forward!

1695
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:34,681
Look out!

1696
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:43,440
Son of a bitch! Come here, you!

1697
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,442
God damn it!

1698
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:08,715
Go, go, go!

1699
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:27,776
No!

1700
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:40,247
Get the knife! Get
the knife! Grab his hand!

1701
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:41,832
Get it!

1702
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:47,963
Get the pilot!

1703
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:52,426
No! No! Come on!

1704
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:56,179
Get him up! Get him up!
Come on, come on, you can do it.

1705
01:39:05,607 --> 01:39:07,232
Bring it up here!

1706
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:09,067
Move it!

1707
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:15,198
Move it! Come on, move it!

1708
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:25,334
Shit.

1709
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:28,128
If we don't get in there, we'll all die!

1710
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:34,384
Ziad!

1711
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,140
Move it!

1712
01:39:42,644 --> 01:39:44,853
Bring the pilot up!

1713
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,321
Get him up! Grab his
hands! Grab his hands!

1714
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:56,698
Pull it up!

1715
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,226
I can't pull! I can't!
