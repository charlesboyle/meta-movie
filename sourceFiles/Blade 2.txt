1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,160
First time giving blood?

2
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,670
Yes.

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
They pay cash here.

4
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,510
And there's no limit
to how many times you give.

5
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,630
They even buy it
in the jar.

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,850
Jared Nomak,
we're ready for you.

7
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,070
In the past 12 months,
have you gotten a tattoo,

8
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,120
or undergone any ear,
skin, or body piercings?

9
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,620
No.

10
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,120
Where did you get
that scar on your chin?

11
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,330
Childhood accident.

12
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,380
You say you don't have
any immediate next of kin,

13
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,960
- is that right?
- Not that I'm in contact with.

14
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,130
Nobody to call in case
of an emergency?

15
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,800
No one.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,470
- No family?
- I told you, no.

17
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,890
Are you telling me
I can't be a donor?

18
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,270
It depends.
We came up

19
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,310
with some unusual results
on your blood test.

20
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,310
What?

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,320
How unusual?

22
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,440
Let me explain.

23
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,280
Your blood has
a very rare phenotype,

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,700
one we haven't
encountered before.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,080
What? What are you
talking about?

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,580
- Who are you? No.
- Sit down, please.

27
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,300
What is this?

28
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,180
This is a good news-bad news
scenario, Jared.

29
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,010
Good news for us...

30
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,180
bad news...

31
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,190
...for you.

32
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,880
Forget what you think
you know--

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,720
vampires exist.

34
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,890
My name is Blade.

35
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,600
I was born half human,
half vampire.

36
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,810
They call me
"The Daywalker."

37
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,150
I have all their strengths,

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,990
none of their weaknesses.

39
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,580
Except for the thirst.

40
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,160
20 years ago I met a man
that changed that.

41
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,630
Whistler.

42
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,500
He taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay.

43
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,010
Taught me the rules.

44
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,680
Gave me the weapons
to hunt with.

45
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,290
Silver, garlic,

46
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,510
sunlight.

47
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,180
Two years ago
he was attacked.

48
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,850
They took him,

49
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,270
and turned him into
the thing I hate most.

50
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,690
I should have
finished him off.

51
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,980
Now I'm hunting him.

52
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,230
I will find him.

53
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,650
And nothing will stand
in my way.

54
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,680
Daywalker's here!
Stop him!

55
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,580
Where is he?

56
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,660
Hey!

57
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,080
No, no.

58
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,510
Take me to him, and I'll
consider you a loose end.

59
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,530
Catch you later.

60
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,730
Old man... look at what
they've done to you.

61
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,630
Let's go home.

62
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,170
Lock up your daughters,
boys and girls,

63
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,980
the dark knight returns.

64
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,020
- Need a toke of the smokage, B?
- Later.

65
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,230
Cut the lights.

66
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,530
You found him.

67
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,040
You didn't kill him.

68
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,800
Give me a hand.

69
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,880
I got a bad feeling
about this, B.

70
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,220
Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying. He's in pain.

71
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,220
Why don't you just put him
out of his misery right now?

72
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,430
They had him on stasis
in a halfway house.

73
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,350
I'm giving him an accelerated
retro-viral detox.

74
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,690
Like a heroin addict.

75
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,740
Make him go cold turkey
in one night.

76
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,560
Shit ain't
going to work, man.

77
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,700
I say you kill the motherfucker
right now.

78
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,570
Get out.

79
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,870
If there's anything left
of you in there, Whistler,

80
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,330
listen up.

81
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,340
In the morning those blinds
are going to open

82
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,550
whether you're cured...

83
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,550
or not.

84
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,740
Hey, man,
I didn't mean to call him--

85
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,160
Listen to me, Blade.

86
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,790
You're going to have
to finish me off.

87
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,290
No.

88
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,790
Give me
that damn gun.

89
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,130
Now walk away.

90
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,800
Stubborn son of a bitch.

91
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,530
How do you feel?

92
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,690
Like hammered shit.

93
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,490
How'd you find me?

94
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,840
I started out in Moscow.
Then Romania.

95
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,870
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?

96
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,750
- Months?
- Too long.

97
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,020
Years.

98
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,900
They tortured me
almost to death.

99
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,030
And then let me heal
in a vat of blood

100
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,980
so they could go
at it again.

101
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,200
Sorry sons of bitches
could have at least

102
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,540
fixed my goddamn leg
while they were at it.

103
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,250
Where's my arc welder?

104
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,310
What's up? Nice to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.

105
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,810
I'm Josh. You can call me "Scud."
Everybody does.

106
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,670
Tell me something, Skid--

107
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,130
No, man, it's "Scud,"
like "Stud."

108
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,840
Whatever.

109
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,960
- What are you doing here?
- The pimpmobile?

110
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,550
Just a little aftermarket
modification.

111
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,010
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.

112
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,670
You gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping.

113
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,960
The whole package will crank
that Betty up, maybe 300 horsepower.

114
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,180
You'll burn the thing out
before your next oil change.

115
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,150
Where did you dig up
this shitbird, anyway?

116
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,010
What the fuck
is your problem, Poppy?

117
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,240
My problem is I've been
sucking blood clots for two years.

118
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,770
I get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life's work.

119
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,200
We jeopardized our whole
operation to save your ass!

120
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,730
- Our operation?
- Yeah.

121
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,790
Our operation? I built
this operation, you ass-wipe!

122
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,960
Motion sensors!
It's on three, gentlemen.

123
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,880
Human?

124
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,680
Body temperature, 50.
I'd guess suckhead.

125
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,010
Fried. They're using
magnesium flares.

126
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,190
They've got your security
system scoped out.

127
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't trust you--

128
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

129
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,080
Cool outfit.

130
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,590
Guard lights!

131
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,920
We represent the ruling body
of the Vampire Nation.

132
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,300
They are offering you
a truce.

133
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,080
They want to meet
with you.

134
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,420
Scud.

135
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,090
Take off your mask.

136
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,390
My name is Asad.
This is Nyssa.

137
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,360
You have been our most
feared enemy.

138
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,900
But now there's something else
loose on the streets.

139
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,580
Something worse
than you.

140
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,390
What's so funny?

141
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,150
They tell stories about Blade
as the Bogeyman.

142
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,050
Frankly,
I'm disappointed.

143
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,400
You hear that, B?
She's disappointed.

144
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,950
He agreed
to come along so easily.

145
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,740
Come on, B, show her.
Pretty please?

146
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,610
Semtex.

147
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,740
Enough explosives
to level a city block.

148
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,260
You still disappointed?

149
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,360
The guards look human.
They're probably familiars.

150
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,710
You sure about this?

151
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,220
Well, if I'm not...

152
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,600
The true power
of the Vampire Nation lies here.

153
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,250
Father?

154
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,890
Blade, this is
Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

155
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,350
It has been said,
"Be proud of your enemy

156
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,560
and enjoy his success."

157
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,650
In that regard,
I should thank you.

158
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,560
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.

159
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,910
You did us a favor.
Karel Kounen.

160
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,960
- You're human.
- Barely. I'm a lawyer.

161
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,240
European Health Consortium.

162
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,620
As you may know,
Vampirism is...

163
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:57,930
a horrible virus, carried
in the saliva of predators.

164
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,970
In 72 hours, it spreads through
the human bloodstream,

165
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,510
creating new
parasitic organs.

166
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,260
Like cancer.

167
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,470
Cancer with a purpose.

168
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,700
Unfortunately,
viruses evolve, too.

169
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,850
We've encountered
a new one.

170
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,810
We dubbed it
the Reaper Strain.

171
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,320
And like any good pathogen,
it appears to have found a carrier.

172
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,120
There...
Jared Nomak.

173
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,640
Born a vampire,
but an anomaly like you.

174
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,310
Unlike the rest of us,
however,

175
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,270
he feeds on not just humans,

176
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,300
but vampires as well.

177
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,220
- Looks like he was doing me a favor.
- You're missing the point.

178
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,310
Their vampire victims
don't die...

179
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,230
they turn.
They become carriers.

180
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,330
You've got to understand.
These things are like crack addicts.

181
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:07,200
They need to feed daily.
Nomak's been up for 72 hours.

182
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,040
By our estimates, there are already
a dozen Reapers.

183
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,580
There'll be hundreds
before the week is out.

184
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,680
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.

185
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,710
Wait. Let me get
this right.

186
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,970
You want me
to hunt them... for you?

187
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,390
When they are finished
with us,

188
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,720
who do you think
they'll turn on next?

189
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,480
Your precious humans.

190
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,400
Not one of them
will be left.

191
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,230
We spent two years training
a small tactical unit--

192
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,990
The Bloodpack.
We want you to lead them.

193
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,080
Two years?

194
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,620
We've been training
to hunt you.

195
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,090
So, B-man,
what do you think?

196
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,420
Sounds like a plan.

197
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,450
What do you really think?

198
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,430
They're going to fuck us
the first chance they get.

199
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,000
So, we ain't
gonna do this, right?

200
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,020
We'll play along for now.

201
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,020
They'll take us in deeper
than we've ever been.

202
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,020
Get a chance to see
how their world really ticks.

203
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,530
I had enough of their world.

204
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,520
They're just shitting bricks

205
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,690
because they're no longer
top of the food chain.

206
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,530
Damn, man,
I'm really worried about him.

207
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,530
I know he's
your friend and all,

208
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,860
but I think you should
watch him.

209
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,380
Nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night.

210
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,000
Looking to get
hooked up?

211
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,510
Maybe.
What do you have?

212
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,170
No problem.

213
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,710
Horse, Hawaiian Ice,
whatever you need.

214
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,520
Whatever I need.

215
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,400
I like that.
What if I need you?

216
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,280
So, so sweet.

217
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,940
They are ready
whenever you are, Daywalker.

218
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,430
Blade,
meet The Bloodpack.

219
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,770
Lighthammer,
Verlaine,

220
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,720
Priest,
Snowman,

221
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,570
Chupa,
and Reinhardt.

222
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,240
Hey, um...

223
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,670
me and the gang
were wondering...

224
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,260
What was that?

225
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,260
Can you blush?

226
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,800
Here we go.

227
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,100
Oh, I get it.

228
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,970
I see now.

229
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,770
You've been training for two years
to take me out.

230
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,530
And now, here I am.

231
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Ooh, so exciting,
isn't it?

232
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,330
Okay, here's your chance.

233
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,670
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

234
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,570
Here I am.
Right here in front of you.

235
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,250
Adolf here gets the first shot.
Come on.

236
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,410
What are you looking at her for?
You need permission?

237
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,620
Maybe you need
a little bit of incentive.

238
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,680
Okay, I can help
with that.

239
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,010
What's the matter?
Missed that?

240
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,840
It's okay,
I can do it again.

241
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,190
Come on.
What, do you need a manual?

242
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,930
- Do it!
- Kill the bastard!

243
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,650
Now you've got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head.

244
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,670
Silver nitrate. Rigged to go off
if anybody tampers with it.

245
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,910
I'll have
the detonator with me.

246
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,880
And you-- if you so much
as look at me wrong--

247
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,310
From now on
we work as a unit.

248
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,430
You'll be taking
orders from me.

249
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,090
Any questions?

250
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,440
Good.

251
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,440
You want to catch the hunter?
You start with the prey.

252
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:12,630
We'll target all the night places
where vampires congregate.

253
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,340
Blood banks, safe houses.

254
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,870
The bigger the better.

255
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,750
So... what's first?

256
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,380
The House of Pain.

257
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,270
Where's the entrance?

258
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,870
I don't see any signs.

259
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,400
No vampire glyphs.

260
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,290
No, because of you,
we've had to rethink our habits,

261
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,920
tighten our security.

262
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,580
Have a closer look.

263
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,840
Nice.

264
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,720
.38, .45
and 9mm caliber.

265
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,230
All with foil capsules
at the tip

266
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,380
filled with silver nitrate,
and garlic extract.

267
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,550
This hyper-velocity
stake gun

268
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,970
spits out a silver stake
at 6,000 feet per second.

269
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,310
Since you suckers
don't like sunlight,

270
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,160
we've modified the gun's
entry light with a UV filter.

271
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,980
Pop it open--
instant UV light.

272
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,740
Filter's on,
no problem.

273
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,450
Yo, B, check this out.

274
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,780
It's got an pneumatic
syringe delivery system.

275
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,660
The vials are filled with
an anti-coagulant called EDTA.

276
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,970
One punch with this, you'll blow
your target up like a balloon.

277
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,890
The cartridge ejects.
Automatic reload.

278
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,840
Nice.

279
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,770
- Let's go.
- You won't pass for one of us.

280
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,770
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he's right.

281
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,100
Why don't you post up
on the roof over there?

282
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,650
Cover our backs.

283
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,820
So the Bloodpack's calling
the shots now, huh?

284
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,030
Great.

285
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,370
Better curb that dog of yours
or we'll do it for you.

286
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,160
Keep pushing, asshole.

287
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,380
We're in.

288
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,720
You're about
to enter our world.

289
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,900
You will see things--
feeding.

290
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,780
Just remember
why you're here.

291
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,020
I haven't forgotten.

292
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,410
What exactly
are we looking for in here?

293
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,500
Anything that looks
suspicious.

294
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,850
You got to be
kidding me.

295
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,120
Scud, do you read me?

296
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,580
- Scud, you reading me?
- Reading you loud and clear.

297
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,570
The whole place
is a safe house.

298
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,090
The windows are painted black,
one access door.

299
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,550
- 200, 300 suckheads in here.
- That sounds cool.

300
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,920
Hey, W, you got me?

301
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,060
W?

302
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,090
Tell me something,
how's the weather up there?

303
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,060
Walkin' on sunshine,
toad boy.

304
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,740
Look at them.
Half of these bastards,

305
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,580
they're not even
pure bloods.

306
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:33,290
I tell you what, why don't we
just fucking kill everyone?

307
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,080
Just to make sure.

308
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,590
God, it would be
so easy.

309
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,440
He's got you.

310
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,020
Daywalker.

311
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,460
Mother's milk.

312
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,130
I say we got about half an hour
till sunrise, Cinderella.

313
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,760
Hurry up.

314
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,330
I spotted one,
but lost it.

315
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,540
Be on the lookout.

316
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,430
Fuck.

317
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,650
Whistler, they're
on the roof.

318
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,440
I got them on the roof
of my bus.

319
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,720
Shhh.

320
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,870
Nomak.

321
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,570
Daywalker.

322
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,440
What am I to you?

323
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,530
Is the enemy
of my enemy my friend...

324
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,700
or my enemy?

325
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,800
We're under attack!

326
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,730
There's three of them.
Probably more.

327
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:13,410
Daylight.

328
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,850
Silver don't do jack shit.
Don't waste the bullets!

329
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:03,440
- Motherfucker.
- You hear me, Chupa?

330
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,230
Say, "cheese."

331
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,370
Come on.

332
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,040
How about some daylight,
motherfucker?

333
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,450
Fuck!

334
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,060
Listen to me. If you're under attack,
use your UV lights.

335
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,520
Use your UV lights.
They can't take the light.

336
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,940
Priest?
We're not dying here.

337
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,420
- Come on.
- Priest is down.

338
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,370
Daylight's coming.
You're on your own, Blade.

339
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,570
You want me so bad, Blade?

340
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,750
Here I am.

341
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,670
Why kill me?

342
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,130
You and I,
we have the same enemy.

343
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,870
We want the same thing.

344
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,770
We need the same thing,
Blade.

345
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,090
What happened?

346
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,130
Why didn't you tell me
these things

347
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:32,260
- were immune to silver and garlic?
- I didn't know.

348
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,890
If you did,
would you have told me?

349
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:39,060
I think you know the truth
when you hear it.

350
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,300
Mm-hmm.
Then why didn't he kill you?

351
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,640
How long since
he's been bitten?

352
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,770
- About 20 minutes.
- His skin is fucking burning.

353
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,990
He's already starting
to change.

354
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,900
Will someone just
shut him the fuck up?

355
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,670
Hold on!

356
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,300
- Hold him, Chupa!
- Come on, man!

357
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,180
Put him
out of his fucking misery!

358
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,310
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way!

359
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,940
Hold him down!
Hold him down, Chupa!

360
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,440
Move.

361
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,290
Back off!

362
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,640
If that was
your Bloodpack Sunday punch,

363
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,560
- we're in trouble.
- This motherfucker left his post.

364
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,470
- He just disappeared.
- Where were you?

365
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,640
Ran into a little Reaper
action myself.

366
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,970
Oh, yeah?
How little?

367
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:11,730
We lost a man.
Priest.

368
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:15,070
You want me to carve
his name on your chest?

369
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,230
Let me show you.

370
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,240
Saw him moving in the alley
and followed it down.

371
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,920
Found it just like this.

372
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,410
I think they came through here.

373
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,590
It was trying to crawl back
in the culvert.

374
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,250
Caught his arm.

375
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,600
Been gnawing at it
like a coyote.

376
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,590
Little Boy Blue.

377
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,260
It's already dying.

378
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,100
I need to examine it
as quickly as possible.

379
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,270
Okay, look for a lever.
Let's open it.

380
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:18,750
They've made contact
with the Reapers.

381
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,480
- Any casualties?
- One so far.

382
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,760
It was not...

383
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,100
Nyssa, I trust?

384
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:29,270
No.

385
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,890
This a dangerous game
you're playing, Damaskinos.

386
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,940
Blade is too volatile.

387
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,770
You're not going to be able
to keep manipulating him.

388
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,440
You worry too much.

389
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,950
I've been informed
by our friend inside

390
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,170
that events are unfolding
as scripted.

391
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,200
You've already lost
one of your own.

392
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,340
How many more are you
willing to sacrifice?

393
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,300
Everyone.

394
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,930
Even your own
daughter?

395
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,550
Yes. Even her.

396
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,650
Recognize this?

397
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,270
The blood bank.

398
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,060
He's one of the guards.

399
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,530
So why is he dying?
What's killing him?

400
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,660
Time.

401
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,900
His metabolism
is burning too fast.

402
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,570
They need fresh blood
every couple of hours,

403
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:30,410
or they'll start feeding
on themselves.

404
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,420
Nomak's different.

405
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,710
He's the carrier.
It all started with him.

406
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,420
It'll end with him.

407
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,460
Open the mouth, Scud.

408
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,130
Open the mouth.

409
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,710
B, come on.

410
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,450
Sissy.

411
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:31,470
Only the tongue
carries the virus.

412
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:34,150
It is injected
through these barbs.

413
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,020
It has bifurcated
masseter muscles.

414
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,360
Overdeveloped, allowing
for a much stronger bite.

415
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,670
The jaw structure
remains the same.

416
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,840
But there's
no mandible bone.

417
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,790
Squeeze that tooth.

418
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,140
Neurotoxin.

419
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:06,930
Probably paralyzes
their victim

420
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,220
while they feed.

421
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:15,110
Garlic don't work.
Silver, that don't work.

422
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:16,990
We got to go
with the sunlight, right?

423
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,330
That's deadly to us, too.

424
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,830
So let's see what else
we can find.

425
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,430
These things are
as different from us

426
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,970
as we are from you.

427
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,110
Look at that.

428
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,940
The heart
is encased in bone.

429
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,280
Only the side
is vulnerable.

430
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,460
Good luck getting
a stake through that.

431
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,590
Pull a leg off a spider,
it keeps moving on its own,

432
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,620
essentially trying to walk
without a body attached to it.

433
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,460
- What are you doing?
- Hard-wired, right?

434
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:24,180
What the fuck is that?

435
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,850
Brain's dead.

436
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,360
Body's still trying
to feed.

437
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:33,320
We got six hours
before sunrise.

438
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:34,950
Be ready by then.

439
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,150
Hey...

440
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,150
What happens
at sunrise?

441
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,000
Blade,
I'm talking to you.

442
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,000
What happens
at sunrise?

443
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,070
- We hunt.
- In broad daylight?

444
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:51,250
You got be joking.

445
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,920
You better get you
some sunscreen, buttercup.

446
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,220
Listen, shitkicker.

447
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,050
You're about one cunt hair
away from hillbilly heaven.

448
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:00,680
I love it
when you talk dirty.

449
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,190
Sunlight's the only
edge we've got.

450
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,270
- They'll be more vulnerable then.
- And so will we.

451
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,270
Let's be real
about one thing--

452
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,320
I don't expect everybody
to make it back tomorrow.

453
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,900
Remember to protect
yourselves...

454
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:22,940
at all times.

455
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,250
What are you looking for?

456
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,300
Phosphor rods.

457
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,220
If I can suss out the light source
maybe I can make some sort of

458
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:40,130
UV flash-bang grenade
or something.

459
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:41,890
It's been tried already.

460
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,880
Yeah, but you didn't have
the Scudster working on it then.

461
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,660
- Blade.
- Hmm?

462
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:02,950
- The way you talk to them-- us.
- What is it?

463
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:05,290
We are together
in this, remember?

464
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,570
Why do you hate us
so much?

465
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,500
It's fate.

466
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:14,170
- It's in my blood.
- It's in mine, too.

467
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,760
I'm a pure blood.
I was born a vampire.

468
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,550
You know the thirst
better than any of us,

469
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,630
shooting that serum
of yours.

470
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,480
The only difference
between us,

471
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,310
is that I made peace with
what I am a long time ago.

472
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:41,650
How long have
you known Blade, anyway?

473
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:43,410
Going on 20 years.

474
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:46,330
He doesn't talk about
the old days that much.

475
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,490
Blade doesn't talk
about anything much.

476
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,830
You want to hear
something funny?

477
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:55,000
Blade kind of looks at you
like a father figure.

478
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,840
Tell me something.

479
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:00,300
How'd you two hook up?

480
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,930
I was backpacking.

481
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:05,380
I met these two chicks,
decided to take them back

482
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:09,050
to my tent for a little
"Three's Company" action.

483
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:11,270
- Pretty.
- Next thing I know, Janet and Chrissy

484
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,220
start tearing chunks
out of my stomach.

485
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,350
Blade shows up,
saves my ass.

486
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,820
Everything else just sort of
fell into place.

487
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:24,480
- Let's try it.
- All right.

488
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,220
Maybe I fucked up.
Maybe you were right.

489
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,020
All right.

490
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,560
Papa's got
a brand new bag.

491
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,310
Let me ask one question.

492
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,650
How are we going to find
these Reapers?

493
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,480
We won't have to.

494
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,990
They'll come to us.

495
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,280
- What is this shit?
- Pheromones.

496
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,950
Harvested from the Reapers'
adrenal glands.

497
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:48,000
They're going to key to it.

498
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,910
They want us to spray on
some suckpuppy's nut juice?

499
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:57,630
First use your firearms
to drive them back.

500
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,970
- Then toss your UV grenades.
- Right on.

501
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:02,100
This is what we got
for the grand finale.

502
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:03,850
I hot-wired a couple
of these babies

503
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:06,270
into a nitro-vacuum.

504
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,760
Just be real careful
where you pop your load.

505
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:11,190
And you,
you're not coming?

506
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:14,110
No. I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

507
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,600
UV's have
a 10-second delay.

508
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,120
Nyssa...

509
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:23,270
just remember
to take cover.

510
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:28,620
Hey, Blade, give me a hand.

511
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,300
You and Miss Muffet
getting a little cozy?

512
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:39,790
I wouldn't worry
about that if I were you.

513
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,790
Looks to me like you're
getting confused

514
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,310
as to which side of the line
you're standing on.

515
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,980
Those are real hollow words
coming from a man

516
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:51,150
who just spent two years
running with the enemy.

517
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:53,650
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

518
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,980
You know, Whistler,
there's an old saying--

519
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:01,400
"Keep your friends close,

520
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:04,230
but keep your enemies closer."

521
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,360
You might want
to remember that.

522
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,610
Blade, we should split
into three units.

523
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,640
We're trying
to attract them,

524
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,300
not scare them off.

525
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,810
Yeah, well, some of us
can't see in the dark,

526
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,310
you fucking nipplehead.
What am I supposed to do?

527
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:57,850
Bifocals, grandpa.
And try to keep up.

528
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,040
Let's do this.

529
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:05,960
- Hey, hillbilly.
- What the fuck you doing?

530
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:09,940
Ain't nobody here
but you...

531
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,470
and us, buttercup.

532
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:17,990
We lose a partner,
and Blade loses one!

533
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,610
I'll leave you two lovebirds
some time to yourselves.

534
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:40,360
Ah!

535
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,960
I spotted a group
in the east tunnel.

536
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,970
I'm prepping
the bomb pack.

537
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,980
Nyssa.

538
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,740
Get out!

539
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,500
Right now!

540
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:41,500
No!

541
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,510
No!

542
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,840
I'll attract them to me.
Do what I tell you.

543
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,510
Move!

544
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,760
10...

545
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,350
nine...

546
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,990
eight...

547
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:02,980
seven...

548
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:04,700
six...

549
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:07,410
five...

550
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:09,780
four...

551
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:11,780
three...

552
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,360
two...

553
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,630
one.

554
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,100
Piece of junk.

555
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,960
What the hell is this?

556
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,830
You trying to stink me
to death, old man?

557
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:16,150
Wait.

558
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:19,690
- You okay?
- Yeah.

559
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,520
We got to move.

560
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,230
We got a lot
of company.

561
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:29,320
All units, regroup.
Regroup!

562
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:58,180
Eat shit,
you ugly motherfuckers!

563
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,350
There's nobody left!

564
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:25,510
- Where's the bomb pack?
- Down that tunnel.

565
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:28,180
Give me the rest
of the pheromones.

566
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:32,420
Go down that tunnel!

567
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,310
Go, go, go, go!

568
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,400
You obviously...

569
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,770
do not know...

570
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,780
whom you are fucking with!

571
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,570
By the way, Blade.

572
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:21,780
Did I happen to mention
the bomb lever is stuck?

573
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:29,270
Suck this!

574
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:33,290
Let's go!

575
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:16,370
You want a bite of me?
Well, come on!

576
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:17,910
Come on, motherfucker!

577
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,040
Whistler.

578
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,000
Wait.

579
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:43,370
You will survive this

580
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:45,090
only to tell Blade...

581
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,180
about this ring.

582
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,470
About the truth.

583
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:52,710
The truth, old man.

584
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,970
Damaskinos...

585
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:06,990
Nyssa.

586
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,030
You've done
a great job.

587
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,550
Not that great--
I'd say.

588
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:07,490
What is it,
my daughter?

589
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,280
They took them.

590
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,830
All our weapons.
Even your sword.

591
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:03,450
Somebody's been keeping tabs
on us from inside.

592
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:06,300
- Where are we?
- Some kind of chamber

593
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,090
deep in their lair.

594
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:10,140
They smashed up
everything--

595
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:12,300
the workshop,
all of it.

596
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,010
They've been lying
to us from day one.

597
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:20,110
The reaper strain
didn't evolve...

598
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,680
it was designed.

599
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,470
What?

600
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,850
Designed.
Nomak told me.

601
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:27,640
I saw him back
in the sewer.

602
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:31,030
- He let me live.
- Did he?

603
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:33,660
How generous of him.

604
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:37,170
I brought you here to see
the fruits of our labor.

605
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:43,420
For years I've struggled

606
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:48,180
to rid our kind of
any hereditary weaknesses.

607
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:52,130
And so, recombining DNA...

608
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,980
was simply the next
logical step.

609
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:59,220
Nomak was the first.

610
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,390
A failure.

611
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,150
But in time,

612
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:06,490
there will be a new
pure race,

613
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,860
begotten from my own flesh,

614
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:11,940
immune to silver,

615
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:15,030
soon even sunlight.

616
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:18,420
I got a question for you,
you lying son of a bitch.

617
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,200
You want to explain how Nomak
got ahold of this ring?

618
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:35,180
I would have thought
that was obvious at this point.

619
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,190
I gave it to him,
of course.

620
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:40,190
A gift from father
to son.

621
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,070
I thought
he'd never leave.

622
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,370
The wolf has lain
with the sheep long enough.

623
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,620
Reinhardt,

624
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:07,470
you can kiss
your ass goodbye.

625
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,190
I'm sorry, man.

626
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:19,180
B, you're wasting
your time, man.

627
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:20,980
The bomb's a dud.

628
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,810
It was never supposed
to explode.

629
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,390
It was just supposed
to make you feel in control.

630
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:28,320
You thought you had me
on a short leash,

631
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,060
didn't you, jefe?

632
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:39,250
Much better.

633
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:43,920
See this?

634
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:48,090
I'm one of Damaskinos'
familiars.

635
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,790
They needed my help
to bring you here to control Nomak.

636
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,180
The old fuck,
he was always just bait.

637
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,010
I mean, look at him.

638
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,850
He's your only
real weakness, man.

639
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:58,680
You may be fast,
you may be strong,

640
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,340
and all that other
bullshit,

641
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,850
but in the end, B...

642
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,650
you're just too human!

643
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,980
Well, you little shit.

644
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,160
You think they scoped out
my security system?

645
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,330
I let them in, asshole!

646
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,330
I practically
handed them the keys.

647
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,290
You heard cue ball, right?

648
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:24,160
Pretty soon they're all going
to be daywalkers.

649
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,010
When that happens,

650
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,960
I'd rather be a pet
than cattle.

651
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,630
You got me, B?

652
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,100
- What do you think about that?
- Two things--

653
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:37,180
one...

654
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:41,050
I've been onto you
since they turned you.

655
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:43,060
And two...

656
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:46,400
it's not a dud.

657
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,950
Ah, great.

658
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,610
I was just starting
to like him.

659
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,410
Take him down!

660
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:36,820
We're going to harvest
your blood,

661
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:38,320
every drop of it.

662
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:42,570
Then bone marrow,
organs, everything.

663
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:44,490
We'll find
the missing key

664
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:46,580
to creating daywalkers.

665
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,090
Now this
might hurt a bit.

666
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:01,760
Nice.

667
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:05,280
I wonder...

668
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:08,820
how many vampires
he's killed with this thing.

669
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,690
Not nearly enough, Fritz.

670
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:13,910
Keep talking, honky-tonk.

671
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,660
Just makes my sending you
to the next world

672
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,290
- all the sweeter.
- Been there, done that.

673
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:22,840
Do your worst,
chickenshit.

674
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,700
We'll settle up after.

675
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,770
What else
should I find out?

676
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:51,490
I trusted you--

677
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:54,020
with my men;

678
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,160
with my will;

679
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,190
with my life.

680
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:03,170
You sent us out there.

681
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:07,450
You sent me to die.

682
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,630
Our enemy saved
my life twice,

683
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:17,300
and you have used us--
your own children.

684
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,900
Make no mistake, Nyssa,

685
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:24,180
those blood ties
mean nothing to me

686
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,770
when measured against
the ascendancy of our race.

687
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:32,900
Who do you think
God really favors in the web?

688
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:38,740
The spider, or the fly?

689
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,490
Nomak.

690
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:52,750
What about him?

691
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:55,880
He wants revenge...

692
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,930
on the people...

693
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,260
who created him.

694
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:04,020
You may be right.

695
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:06,730
But fortunately
for us,

696
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:08,890
he doesn't know
this location.

697
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:15,580
Now... he does.

698
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:46,560
What the fuck?

699
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,910
Come on, kid.

700
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,830
Don't you even think
about dying on me.

701
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:50,580
You didn't give up on me,
I won't give up on you.

702
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,590
Come on-- Blade.

703
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:03,680
Blood...

704
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,020
Yeah.

705
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:08,030
Blood.

706
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:45,510
Father!

707
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:47,510
He'll never enter here.

708
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:56,660
Father!

709
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,850
Father!

710
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,710
Go on, kid.

711
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,060
Go!

712
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:18,410
Get him!

713
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:32,880
Get in there!

714
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:51,020
Hmm. Well...

715
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:54,020
like my daddy said
before he killed my mom,

716
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,030
"You want anything
done right,

717
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,690
you got to do it
yourself."

718
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,330
He also said--

719
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:21,520
Can you blush?

720
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:37,200
Hey, kid.

721
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,610
I reset
the security code.

722
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:24,500
- We're locked in.
- Are you insane?

723
01:38:26,410 --> 01:38:28,840
- He'll kill us both.
- Yes.

724
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:34,340
Isn't it sad that you die not
by the hand of your enemy,

725
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:37,680
but by that of your own
children?

726
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:49,480
Father.

727
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:25,360
Nyssa.

728
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:17,050
Nomak!

729
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:23,980
Blade,
it could end right here.

730
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:26,220
What do you think, huh?

731
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:24,370
After all,

732
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,370
it looks like I've finished
my father's job.

733
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,720
It's strange.

734
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,430
It hurts...

735
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,020
it hurts no more.

736
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:37,220
It won't be long.

737
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:41,550
I can already feel it
burning inside of me.

738
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:48,730
I want to die
while I'm still a vampire.

739
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:04,490
I want to see the sun.

740
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,720
By booth number three.

741
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,390
Enjoy, man.

742
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:52,400
Are you sure
that the girls are live?

743
01:48:52,430 --> 01:48:54,220
Last time I checked.

744
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:56,030
Thank you.

745
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,890
A couple of razor blades,
just in case...

746
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,780
You didn't think I forgot
about you, did you?
