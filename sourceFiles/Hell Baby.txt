00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,761
- Home.
- Home.

3
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,249
Here's to low-balling
the seller

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,323
and still getting 50,000 off
after the home inspection.

5
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,448
We could paint this place today,
sell it tomorrow

6
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,329
and still make money.

7
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,209
Yes, we could.

8
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,247
- I love you, Jack Watson.
- I love you.

9
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,126
Now, let me carry you
over that goddamn threshold.

10
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,049
Ooh! Wait, stop.

11
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,521
- Let's not squander the moment!
- I peed a little bit.

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,490
- Oh, God! Really? Eugh!
- No, it's OK. It's just...

13
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,369
The babies are pushing
on my bladder.

14
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,841
Will you hand me a tissue?
A paper towel?

15
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,883
- I got it.
- Thanks, baby.

16
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,244
- Hi!
- New, uh...

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,402
- Sorry.
- New parents, soon to be.

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,289
Jack. Vanessa.

19
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,647
- Hi!
- She pees a lot.

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,763
OK.

21
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,163
Come on. Ah! Oh, my God!

22
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,290
If it makes you feel any better,
I just peed a little bit too.

23
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,649
- Jesus, you are fat! Oh, my God!
- Honey! Honey!

24
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,201
Oh, my God!

25
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,084
- Oh!
- Please stop!

26
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,607
Oh! Oh, my God!

27
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,845
- Oh! Ow! Shit!
- Sweetie!

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,088
What are you doing?!

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,765
What are you doing?

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,724
I found this lamp
up in the attic.

31
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,649
I thought I'd get it
working again.

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,126
No.

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,851
Oh, shit! That hurt so bad!

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,002
Please, God, let it be.
That thing'll kill somebody.

35
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,525
Alright. Alright.

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,246
Oh! I know
what I want you to do.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,801
If you have time,
I would really love for you

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,327
to paint over the "Ms 13"
graffiti on the front porch,

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,885
first thing.

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,088
- My God, you're so adorable.
- Why am I...

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,687
"Ms 13". It's "MS-13".

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,561
Mara Salvatrucha.
It's this gang out of El Salvador.

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,405
It's the deadliest gang
in the world.

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,289
One of the...
Don't tell the Crips that.

45
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,363
But they're the deadliest gang
in the world.

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,761
So not only
is our new house tagged,

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,850
it's tagged by a famous gang.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,889
Yeah. It's like Banksy.

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,769
You know how much
you love Banksy.

50
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,048
It's like that,
except, you know,

51
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,851
with knives and face tattoos.

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,402
- Oh, my God.
- What?

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,046
This is the worst idea
of our fives.

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,964
The Lower Lower
Garden District?

55
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,043
Hm!

56
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,123
People don't even know
this neighbourhood exists.

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,449
No, that's actually not true.
That's not true.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,921
White people don't know that
this neighbourhood exists.

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,809
This neighbourhood
is on the upswing.

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,610
I read all about it in "Dwell".

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,808
You're not just a little
nervous in this house?

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,809
Hey.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,606
There is not one thing
to be afraid of in this house.

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,690
- OK?
- OK.

65
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,485
Oh, my God! Honey!
Get something!

66
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,086
Goodness gracious,
y'all gave me a fright!

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,607
What are you doing out there?

68
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,081
I'm so sorry - I was just
standin' in your breezeway

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,969
like some kind of
ne'er-do-well.

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,929
Well, come on in.
Make yourself at home.

71
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,401
I absolutely will do that,
thank you very much.

72
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,166
Please allow me to introduce myself.
I am Fresnel Edmonds.

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,044
I live across the way
over here.

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,771
And you are
Jack and Vanessa!

75
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,287
Jack, you're a PhD student
at Tulane University.

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,169
How are you? Vanessa.

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,890
You are
an occupational therapist

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,923
expecting your first baby.

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,805
- Yep.
- Wow. You know a lot about us.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,402
Come on, y'all - you can't move
into the 'Maison de Sang'

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,085
and not raise a few eyebrows.

82
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,890
- Frenell?
- F'resnel.

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,963
It's spelled
just like it sounds.

84
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,088
Yeah, F-apostrophe-R-E-S-N-E-L.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,050
It's really nice
to meet you.

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,362
It's very nice to meet
the two of you as well.

87
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,484
- Sorry we screamed.
- I'm sorry I screamed.

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,087
- Did you say 'Maison de Sang'?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,368
Oh, yeah. That's what
all the locals call it.

90
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,410
That's the name we've been
using for years and years.

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,289
Oh! Well, that's cool.

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,363
This place has
a nickname already.

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,807
It's like 'Tara'
or 'Twelve Oaks'.

94
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,691
- A little bit like that.
- Well, that's very Southern.

95
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,888
It is very Southern.
What does it mean?

96
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,050
- 'House of Blood'.
- What?

97
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,089
'House of Blood'.

98
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,124
And, of course, the Cajuns,
they like to call it

99
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,446
'Lieu Oú Les Morts
Ne Sommeillent Jamais'.

100
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,165
- Oh, I like that.
- Ain't that pretty?

101
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,288
- I love the sound.
- And what does that one mean?

102
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,647
'Place where the dead
never rest'.

103
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,531
Then, of course,
there's also 'Casa Perderosa'.

104
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,444
That's Spanish
for 'House of the lost'.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,604
And some call it 'the spooky
old house on down the way'.

106
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,569
But nothin' for y'all
to worry about. No, no.

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,123
Nobody has been murdered
in this house in a long time.

108
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,204
I mean, it's not like anybody
got murdered here yesterday.

109
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,169
Wow, see?

110
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,244
Nobody's been murdered here
for a long, long, long time.

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,131
- Years, it sounds like.
- I'm sorry. Did I say years?

112
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,568
If I did, I misspoke.
There have been very recent murders.

113
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,247
It's just that, uh, not any
in this calendar year.

114
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,246
By 'calendar year',
do you mean since January?

115
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,846
Exactly.
None in this calendar year.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,889
Well, that's four solid months.

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,088
Well, give or take.

118
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,449
Probably more like three and a half,
maybe two and a half.

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,331
I'll go, like,
two months and a week.

120
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,608
But don't get me wrong.
It's a great house.

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,728
It got really good bones.

122
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,804
You mean structurally, right?

123
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,406
Not like there's bones
in here someplace!

124
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,166
Sure, sure, Vanessa.

125
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,529
- Let's say that's what I meant.
- Ohhh...

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,969
Well, I will now be on my way.

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,762
So if y'all need anything,
I'll always be real close by.

128
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,604
Goodnight to you both.

129
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,081
- Goodnight, F'resnel.
- Goodnight, now.

130
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,566
- Oh!
- Baby, can you...

131
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,449
Arggh!

132
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,329
- I apologise.
- Oh, my God! F'resnel!

133
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,801
Almost had the babies
right there.

134
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,689
Let me get it.
I'm sorry, y'all.

135
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,320
It sticks on the inside.
You gotta jimmy it a bit.

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,289
But it's real easy
to get open and closed

137
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,681
and get access to the home
at any point in time

138
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,922
during the day or night
from the outside.

139
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,804
OK. Thanks, F'resnel.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,570
- Goodnight to you, now.
- Thanks. Goodnight.

141
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,690
- We have to get a lock on this.
- I know, I know.

142
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,969
What the fuck?

143
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,531
And while confronting the demon

144
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,762
that was inhabiting
the young woman's body,

145
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,287
Father Innocente was...

146
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,727
Himpaled, with an umbrella.

147
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,291
There was blood everywhere.

148
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,364
Not a very fitting end for
such a fine man of the cloth,

149
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,241
to be stab-bed with
the pointy end of an umbrella.

150
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,290
It was actually not
the pointy kind of umbrella.

151
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,886
It was actually one of those
little stubby umbrellas.

152
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,805
It had, like, the logo
of a local radio station on it.

153
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,689
One of those, you know?

154
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,207
It had the face of this guy
they call the Locador.

155
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,091
He's like a crazy luchador
of good times.

156
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,730
And his face
was on the umbrella.

157
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,008
The umbrella comes popping
through the chest

158
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,764
of Father Innocente.

159
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,720
It pop open. His heart
still pump for a few beats.

160
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,484
Blood sprays everywhere.

161
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,440
It was not something
you forget right away.

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,446
- It's all in the report, sir.
- Yes, about the report.

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,648
There is an awful lot
of details

164
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,930
about the impaling of Father Innocente
with the umbrella.

165
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,686
Next time, I don't need
so many details.

166
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,405
Just, yeah, broad strokes.

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,847
- The gist.
- Si.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Eminence, I must tell you this.

169
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,648
It was probably the kind
of umbrella they give you

170
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,087
if you go to an event that
the radio station is hosting.

171
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,969
Swag.

172
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,088
And this is the thing
that popped through the chest.

173
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,129
You know, like the dinosaur.
This one.

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,290
This is how it pop open,
and blood spray every place.

175
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,250
- It was really, really weird.
- It was really weird.

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,210
So weird.

177
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,564
Look, boys, I know
this was a very rough one,

178
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,563
but I may have
another job for you.

179
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,449
What is the case?

180
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,524
It's a real doozy.

181
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,927
You're already
playing catch-up.

182
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,321
Take a look at that photo.

183
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,608
- So gross.
- Super gross.

184
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,684
- Super gross.
- This is just a photograph.

185
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,606
In real life,
it's far more horrifying.

186
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,762
Get your asses on the chopper.

187
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,885
We are going to need...
some per diem.

188
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,490
You know that's not me, right?
I hope that wasn't for me.

189
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,007
- No, no, no.
- I was reminding myself.

190
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,561
"Go to Accounting.
We're going to need some per diem."

191
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,246
Level four. The guy down below.
The hunchback.

192
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,562
Yeah, near the fingers
of St Peter.

193
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,046
Don't let F'resnel
get to you even for a second.

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,043
Let me put it to you
this way.

195
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,089
If you were gonna buy
a lottery ticket,

196
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,163
which I know you wouldn't,
because we're snobs,

197
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,243
would you buy it
from the same exact 7-Eleven

198
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,323
where the last winning
lottery ticket was sold?

199
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,000
No. That's like lightning
striking the same place twice.

200
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,889
Yeah. Precisely.

201
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,123
So the fact that there have been
a couple of murders here...

202
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,564
- Several.
- Several murders.

203
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,326
The chance of there being
one murder

204
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,450
are so slim statistically.

205
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,331
A couple?
I mean, it's almost impossible.

206
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,209
So one more? Forget it.

207
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,569
You're safer than in any of
the murder-free places we've lived.

208
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,322
You coming to bed, baby?

209
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,646
Vanessa?

210
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,283
Sweetie?

211
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,771
Huh.

212
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,683
<i>Hi, Vanessa.
This is Dr Marsden.</i>

213
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,650
<i>I was looking at the latest ultrasound,
and I have to say,</i>

214
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,451
<i>I'm...well, I'm not
quite sure how to say this.</i>

215
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,364
<i>I'm horrified.</i>

216
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,284
<i>Not just as a doctor,
but as a person.</i>

217
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,522
<i>You need to come to the office
immediately...</i>

218
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,727
Arggh!

219
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,841
Oh! Shit! Fuck you, lamp!

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,810
Don't take no shit
off that lamp, Jack.

221
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,770
- Thank you, sweetie.
- You're welcome.

222
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,651
Oh, honey. Don't forget.

223
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,689
<i>My sister's coming
to bless the house this week.</i>

224
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,605
I don't know, baby.

225
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,082
That stuffs a little too
Burning Man for me, you know.

226
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,402
Jack. Please.

227
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,211
It's something that
she wants to do for us, OK?

228
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,850
OK.

229
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,002
- Plus Curly Bear left her.
- The Navaho guy?

230
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,209
Mm-hm. He stole all
her credit cards and her car.

231
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,408
- Oh, my God, that's crazy.
- Mm-hm.

232
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,524
- Marjorie has credit cards?
- Jack.

233
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,365
I did not expect that. It takes
a lot to get credit cards.

234
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,925
It takes credit.

235
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,003
- Be nice.
- Who knew?

236
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,004
Be nice. And let her
do her Wicca thing.

237
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,003
Eugh! God.

238
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,567
Vanessa!

239
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,290
Yes, darling?

240
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,169
What was in that drink
you gave me?

241
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,607
Iced tea, darling.

242
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,647
That's pure paint thinner, baby.

243
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,251
My bad.

244
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,926
You could have killed me.

245
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,208
I'm so sorry.

246
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,240
It's pregnant mommy brain.

247
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,289
I must have misread the bottle.

248
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,247
- Are you feelin' alright?
- What?!

249
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,569
You don't seem alright.
You seem...kind of off.

250
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,041
Me? No!

251
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,685
I feel great.

252
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,729
I've actually
never felt better.

253
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,484
Oh!

254
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,211
Whew. Sorry about that.

255
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,251
Bitches be trippin'!

256
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,004
Am I right?

257
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,283
That's some crazy shit.

258
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,011
I apologise, man.
I just scared the fuck out of you.

259
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,289
I just woke up
in your crawl space

260
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,528
and I was tryin' to tiptoe
through to the bathroom

261
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,411
without bein' seen,
and...

262
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,882
It was to no avail.
You know what I'm sayin'?

263
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,331
Did I hear you correctly?
You're sleeping in my crawl space?

264
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,369
Oh, my goodness, yes. Yes.

265
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,807
How can I explain this
to you, Jack?

266
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,361
You know that Shakespeare play
where the man says,

267
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,284
“Neither a borrower
nor a lender be,

268
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,169
"but to thine own self
be true"?

269
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,369
Yeah. It's Polonius to Laertes,
'Hamlet', act 1, scene 3.

270
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,923
Well, colour me impressed,
Jack Watson.

271
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,445
Colour.

272
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,005
Me.

273
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,241
Im.

274
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,406
Pressed.

275
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,762
Wow.

276
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,565
Hello? Who's there?

277
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,809
Oh, my God.

278
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,562
Hey, Vanessa!
I'm gonna take a nap, alright? I'm beat.

279
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,529
Of course.

280
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,371
Oh! Oh, my God, baby.
Don't, don't, don't!

281
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,650
<i>Oh, my God, no. I can't...
I'm so sweaty. I'm so... I'm...</i>

282
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,009
Oh, my God, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

283
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,528
Nice. Would you do that thing...
Do that thing you did in Cancun.

284
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,047
Do that... Ow! Ow!
Oh, my God!

285
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,565
<i>Huh! Oh, G...</i>

286
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,722
Arggh! God! Hey! Careful!

287
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,928
Careful, baby! Ow!

288
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,764
Honey!

289
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,005
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

290
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,090
Honey, what's wrong?

291
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,049
- Oh, my God!
- I didn't do anything.

292
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,282
- What did you do?!
- I thought it was you.

293
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,920
You thought it was me?
You meant to kill me?

294
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,526
- No.
- Why do you have a boner?

295
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,769
- Honey? What's going an?
- Oh, my God!

296
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,605
- Oh, God. This looks terrible.
- Honey, who is she?

297
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,411
I don't know who she is!
She crept up on me.

298
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,080
- You don't know who she is?
- She crept up on me!

299
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,165
She snuck... I don't know.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

300
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,169
Jack!

301
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,807
No, no, no. We have to...
We have to... We have to...

302
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,247
- She'll be OK.
- She's not OK!

303
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,765
- What?
- She's not OK.

304
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,570
- No, no. She's not dead.
- She is dead.

305
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,200
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

306
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,089
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

307
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,810
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!

308
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,923
Oh, God.

309
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,851
OK. OK.

310
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,083
No. No cops.

311
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,242
Are you insane?
I just killed somebody!

312
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,483
Jesus Christ, Jack.
Jesus Christ!

313
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,644
When did you
start smoking again?

314
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,088
That doesn't matter.
Three hours ago. Let me think, OK?

315
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,482
This woman is dead.

316
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,405
Even if you tell your side,
who would believe it?

317
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,643
You want to be in jail
for the first years of my twins' life?

318
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,848
I've got to tell people
what really happened.

319
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,810
OK. OK. OK, baby.

320
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,048
OK.

321
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,282
What's the story, Jack?

322
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,365
Um... She tried to perform
oral sex on me.

323
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,605
And then I bludgeoned her to death
with a fire-extinguisher.

324
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,167
Holy shit! Oh, my God.

325
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,084
It sounds like I mouth-raped
somebody's grandmother

326
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,129
and then murdered her.

327
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,969
You can't go to jail.
We have babies on the way.

328
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,043
Let me think!

329
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,167
Dig.

330
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,326
- Oh, shit-balls!
- What?

331
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,801
You're supposed to call the city
before you dig.

332
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,962
There could be gas lines
anywhere.

333
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,724
That's real smart, Jack.

334
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,645
Let's call the city
and tell them

335
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,486
precisely where we're getting
rid of a corpse from a murder.

336
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,802
That's fair.

337
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,811
- Did you just hear...
- No.

338
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,281
I didn't even finish my question.
You just said no.

339
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,010
I didn't hear anything.

340
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,562
And if you did hear something,
it's probably nothing.

341
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,924
Oh, shit! Don't move a muscle.

342
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,765
There's a big fuckin' dog
staring right at you.

343
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,088
Invisitis.

344
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,045
Seriously?!

345
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,522
What the fuck is going on
right now?!

346
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,490
- You speak bull mastiff?
- Rottweiler.

347
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,249
- Are you crying?
- No.

348
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,290
- You're crying.
- I was dry-crying.

349
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,568
'Cause I was laughing
a little bit too.

350
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,842
I want you
to see a psychiatrist.

351
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,488
Will that make you feel better?

352
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,530
Yes, it will.

353
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,490
Then OK.

354
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,010
Well, a big hello to you two.

355
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,164
You must be Jack and Vanessa.
Or the other way around?

356
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,049
- I'm Dr Marshall.
- You're... Oh, hi.

357
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,248
I apologise for
the Lance Armstrong outfit.

358
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,125
- I am just nuts about biking.
- Us too.

359
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,931
Really?
What kind of bike you got?

360
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,850
Uh...

361
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,530
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

362
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,409
- We don't have bikes.
- At all.

363
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,483
I was just trying to be nice.

364
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,369
Looks like Jack here

365
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,330
might be Mr Cuckoo Pants,
not you - right, Vanessa?

366
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,209
That's fair.

367
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,681
Doctor, you can see the outline
of your penis in those shorts.

368
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,320
Baby, look.

369
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,686
You are 100% right about that,
Vanessa.

370
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,764
And I will change.

371
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,321
And then we will
open up the hood

372
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,131
and see what's gunkin' up
the works in there, OK?

373
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,288
- How does that sound?
- Sounds good.

374
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,091
Get out of there,
you crazy gremlins!

375
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,686
Leave this nice lady alone!

376
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,684
Don't worry, kid.
Mommy's not gonna be crazy forever.

377
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,524
- OK.
- OK.

378
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,401
There you go. Come on in.

379
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,245
Hold on. I'll be right in, OK?
Sorry.

380
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,165
- Hello?
- Jack, my main man!

381
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,448
There are two police officers

382
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,642
right here, right now,
in your home.

383
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,644
And they seem really anxious
to speak to you.

384
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,364
I didn't do anything.

385
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,562
That's interesting
that you would say that.

386
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,088
That sounds like a thing
a guilty person would say.

387
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,767
Well, I didn't do anything, OK?
Innocent people say that too.

388
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,082
I'm sure they do.

389
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,328
Wait. How did they find you?

390
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,369
Oh, long story.

391
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,091
They knocked on the door
and then I answered it.

392
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,605
At my house?

393
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,081
I just popped in for a shower.
No big deal.

394
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,331
Listen, F'resnel, just get rid
of the cops for now, OK? Please.

395
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,209
They want to talk about
Mrs Nussbaum.

396
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,806
Can we not talk about this
on the phone right now?

397
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,485
Get rid of the cops.
I'm begging you.

398
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,729
OK. Well, consider it done,
my white brother. Much love.

399
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,329
You're a riot!

400
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,204
Thank you so much, Doctor.

401
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,961
I can't tell you how much
we appreciate it. Thanks.

402
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,961
Whew!

403
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,367
That was fast.
What did he say?

404
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,970
That I'm 100% fine.

405
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,766
I'm just stressed out
about the babies.

406
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,207
He even wrote me a
prescription for valium.

407
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,761
- Isn't it great?
- What?

408
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,883
Yeah.

409
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,690
Wait.

410
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,247
He actually said "100% fine"?

411
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,607
And then he wrote you
a prescription for valium

412
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,088
even though you're eight months
pregnant with twins?

413
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,651
Yep.

414
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,688
Wow.
I'm just stunned, that's all.

415
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,525
I almost don't believe it.

416
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,409
Oh.

417
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,767
Well, if you
don't believe me, then...

418
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,163
...why don't you just ask him?

419
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,529
Let me just talk to him real quick, OK?
I'll be right back.

420
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,210
If you don't trust me
as the mother...

421
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,685
I'm the mother of your unborn babies,
but no, no, no, no, no.

422
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,569
I want you to go ask.

423
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,485
- I'm sorry.
- No! I want you to ask him.

424
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,484
I trust you. I trust you.

425
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,768
I trust you. I do.

426
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,367
I do. I'm sorry.
I just didn't trust him, you know?

427
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,841
Come on.
Let's get you some valium, huh?

428
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,088
Let's get you all valiumed up.
Alright?

429
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,605
You're the best.

430
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,882
Help me.

431
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,681
Excuse me. Excuse me, Fathers?

432
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,810
Excuse me. Hi.
I hate to be a pest, but...

433
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,045
Louisiana has some pretty sticky
clean indoor air laws,

434
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,050
and you guys are in major violation
of them right now.

435
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,245
So if you wouldn't mind taking
the cigarettes out of doors...

436
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,403
If we wrap this up in time,

437
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,881
I kind of want to check out
the French Quarter, eh?

438
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,965
Is this a place where
the girls flash their boobies?

439
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,122
Is the Vieux Carré.

440
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,011
It's the original city,
founded in 1718.

441
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,403
It's 78 square blocks
that are all protected

442
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,762
in national historic landmark.

443
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,526
It's an area steeped
in the history

444
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,729
of the Spanish and the French
and the Civil War.

445
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,049
But it is also the place where
the girls flash their boobies?

446
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,402
Si.

447
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,121
College girls taking their
perky brand-new boobs out

448
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,601
for a little victory lap.

449
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,845
Sweat of their young bosom mixing with Jagermeister

450
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,331
and the humidity of the bayou,
jiggling for fool's gold.

451
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,002
Please, my friend, you had me
at "perky new boobs".

452
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,047
Mmm.

453
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,530
Oh! Fuck!

454
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,888
I told you, let that thing be.

455
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,529
Is that dog back again?

456
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,889
I do not like that thing
creepin' around here.

457
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,441
I think it's kind of cute.

458
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,768
I'm gonna buy a gun.

459
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,327
- This neighbourhood is nuts.
- Smart, Jack.

460
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,960
Move to the ghetto and then
bring another gun in.

461
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,884
You should have
your NPR tote bag taken away

462
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,963
for comments like that.

463
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,122
Morning, y'all.

464
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,681
- Hi, F'resnel.
- How you doin'?

465
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,843
Jack Watson?
Orleans Parish Police.

466
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,846
Hi. Yeah. Yeah, I'm Jack Watson.

467
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,764
I'm sorry.
Have I done anything wrong?

468
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,608
You tell us, boy genius.
You tell us.

469
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,560
You wouldn't know the whereabouts
of one Ms Elaine Nussbaum?

470
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,644
About 90 years old, 5'9",
missing a couple of teeth?

471
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,202
- Nope. No, I don't.
- Huh. Really?

472
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,328
Has something happened to her?

473
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,086
You tell us.

474
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,164
- I...
- Is that a yes?

475
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,527
- You tell us.
- Tell us.

476
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,245
I don't know
anything about her.

477
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,801
If you're gonna ask questions,
should we get a lawyer?

478
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,249
If you're guilty, you absolutely should.
Absolutely.

479
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,165
Don't say another word.
If you're guilty.

480
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,921
So...are you?
Are you guilty, Shakespeare?

481
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,482
Are you, Einstein? Huh?

482
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,246
Let me ask you
a question, brainiac.

483
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,689
What did you do
that makes you so nervous?

484
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,444
What did you do, bookworm?

485
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,329
Nothing!
I...

486
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,006
I didn't do anything.

487
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,084
Why don't you take a walk
with us, Casanova?

488
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,323
Wait. I'm sorry, I'm confused.

489
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,289
Am I still Casanova?

490
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,283
Because up until now,
all the nicknames have been

491
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,205
"smart guy"-related, and
that's more like "lover boy".

492
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,887
I was trying to come up with
another smart guy and blanked.

493
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,769
Should have said
"Stephen Hawking".

494
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,763
So you...

495
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,685
Why don't you take a walk
with us, Moliére?

496
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,401
Nice.

497
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,247
So...

498
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,449
Haven't seen Ms Nussbaum in a while?

499
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,206
I'm wondering
how you'd explain this.

500
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,406
Oh, my God!

501
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,882
She just wanted
to say thank you.

502
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,441
Why does she want to say
thank you?

503
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,120
According to her, she got lost
when she was sleepwalking,

504
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,090
you found her, put her down for a nap,
and now she feels fine.

505
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,368
I feel fine!

506
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,568
She lives down at
the nursing home down the block.

507
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,484
She gets out all the time.

508
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,564
- Thought you checked her pulse.
- I did check her pulse!

509
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,849
- Somebody wants a hug.
- No.

510
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,163
It is our duty
to legally enforce that hug.

511
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,482
I'm pretty sure
you can't legally enforce a hug.

512
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,325
- Just suck it up.
- You have to do it.

513
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,802
- Just hug the bitch, champ.
- Guys, listen, listen...

514
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,328
I don't want to hug her, OK?
Please. She's old.

515
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,802
Hey! That is someone's
great-g rand mother!

516
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,521
Don't! OK. OK. OK.
I'll hug her. I'll hug her.

517
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,688
I'm so glad you're OK,
Mrs Nussbaum.

518
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,969
OK. Alright? Great.

519
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,327
Great. OK. OK. Great.

520
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,165
- OK. Guys?
- Act like a lady, Ms Nussbaum.

521
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,567
OK, I need a little help.
She's really strong!

522
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,802
- Act like a lady.
- Be a lady, Mrs Nussbaum.

523
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,849
Knock that shit off,
Mrs Nussbaum!

524
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,923
She's got her finger in my ass
and it hurts!

525
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,168
Bad Grandma! No!

526
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,971
- Oh! Oh!
- Jeez!

527
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,531
- Arggh!
- Still got it.

528
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,523
Her nails are so sharp.

529
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,170
- You OK?
- I'm sorry about that.

530
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,209
- That was gross.
- Is she alive?

531
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,249
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
She'll be fine.

532
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,927
The fucking city turned down the power
on these babies to save money.

533
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,809
These things
couldn't kill anybody.

534
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,246
Oh! Fuck! Shit! Ah!

535
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,880
It's not a big thing.
You don't have to worry about it.

536
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,929
Yeah, you don't have to
worry about it.

537
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,562
Come on, Ron!
Shit, man! I got fillings.

538
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,767
Fuck!

539
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,687
Wow. If you don't need us
for anything else, we should...

540
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,208
- Yeah, that's about it.
- Great. OK. Good.

541
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,930
You know where to find us.

542
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,690
Thanks for helping us
sort all this out.

543
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,251
You're welcome.

544
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,291
Still don't know why that old lady
was dazed and covered in dirt, but...

545
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,522
Fuck it, right?

546
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,047
Oh, my God!

547
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,128
What just happened?

548
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,931
- I thought she was dead.
- Me too.

549
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,082
To living and learning.

550
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,924
To living and learning.

551
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,524
Ahh! Wow.

552
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,567
I think we have to
kill those cops.

553
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,691
- Yeah.
- Honey, they know way too much.

554
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,366
I'm really tired, but I can't tell
if you're joking or not.

555
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,761
I'm fine.

556
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,804
- I didn't ask if you were fine.
- I'm fine.

557
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,285
Need a new bottle.

558
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,050
Can we just tone it down
a little bit with the booze?

559
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,605
Hey.

560
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,240
Judge Judy.

561
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,165
Just everything
in moderation, OK?

562
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,211
No more.
You win. No wine.

563
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,607
I'm gonna go...

564
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,281
I'm gonna go wash all this
old-lady vagina off me.

565
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,324
Oh, my God. Oh!

566
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,681
I'll be thinking about this guy
next time I'm fighting off a boner.

567
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,003
Man! Check this out.

568
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,924
Gross!

569
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,889
Gross!

570
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,046
Gross!

571
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,771
- Eugh!
- Gross!

572
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,763
Hey, Father. Thanks for
coming down so quickly.

573
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,723
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

574
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,644
Peace be with you.

575
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,087
Yikes.

576
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,686
Our chief called you
as soon as he heard about this.

577
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,127
We get some voodoo stuff
every now and then,

578
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,049
but this just seemed
kind of more...

579
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,368
- Biblical.
- Biblical.

580
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,171
- Pretty weird.
- Super, super weird.

581
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,163
- Scusi.
- Be our guest.

582
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,210
Your crime scene.
Your crime scene.

583
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,807
Wow. Get any readings off him?

584
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,361
- We don't get readings.
- That's not us.

585
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,643
That's the ghost hunters.
We don't do that.

586
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,529
But is this
the work of the devil?

587
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,569
This?
Off the record?

588
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,610
Between you, me and
the crucified guy on the wall...

589
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,286
I'd say that this is the work
of the devil.

590
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,920
Or one of his very top guys.

591
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,526
People, they think
that the devil is made-up,

592
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,444
like Santa Claus.

593
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,763
But I assure you,
the devil is real.

594
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,769
And he's a dick.

595
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,851
Well, all due respect, padres,
we still gotta check

596
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,083
and see if there's a human
involved in this clambake.

597
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,890
But we're open
to the devil thing too.

598
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,771
Could be the devil.
Could be an ex-girlfriend on PCP.

599
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,843
- No problem.
- You do your thing, we do ours.

600
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,162
Not trying
to step on your toes.

601
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,405
We'll call the coroner, get him
taken to the morgue, call it a day.

602
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,449
"Hey, you guys new in town?
- Si.

603
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,045
Ever have a Domilise's
po' boy?

604
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,806
- Oh, po' boy.
- It's good.

605
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,090
- Mm!
- Mm!

606
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,930
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

607
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,522
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh! Ow.

608
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,762
Ooh, yeah. Yeah.

609
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,642
I can't eat anymore.

610
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,163
How did you two guys
become priests anyway?

611
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,608
Yeah, you guys don't really
even seem that gay.

612
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,367
My path to the priesthood
was, you know, the usual.

613
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,370
I was up-and-coming bullfighter
in Madrid.

614
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,925
- Wow.
- Shit.

615
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,889
- That's awesome.
- What happened?

616
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,042
What happened...

617
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,529
...is that the bull
does not lose every bullfight.

618
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,849
This bull was like
the Michael Jordan of bulls.

619
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,729
He was amazing.

620
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,281
He poked me through
like I was a custard flan.

621
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,489
And he was...
And he was a...

622
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,850
A bull. Exactly like that.

623
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,684
The bad thing is,

624
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,962
I could hear the parade
they threw for the bull.

625
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,849
'Cause this bull
was very popular then.

626
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,525
He's still popular now,

627
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,802
for almost killing
such a promising young matador.

628
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,043
So, what about you?
Were you a bullfighter too?

629
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,680
I was one of those
living statue guys.

630
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,525
Oh, yeah! Those weirdos
that paint themselves all white?

631
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,569
You make a lot of tips.
Ladies love it.

632
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,085
What happened?

633
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,443
Bad luck.

634
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,968
I got caught in the crossfire
of a local Mafia feud.

635
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,844
They were trying to
shoot a couple

636
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,729
who was testifying
against the family,

637
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,326
and I don't know
if they no see me

638
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,566
or they just think I'm a statue,
but I got shot 19 times.

639
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,564
19 times seems excessive.

640
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,526
They say it's still a record
in that part of Italy, huh?

641
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,282
- Not bad.
- For Italy, that is something.

642
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,965
Put that on your Facebook page.

643
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,851
They take me back to
a local hospital.

644
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,970
And there, the good sisters
save my life.

645
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,728
They suck the 19 bullets
out of my body

646
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,486
with their mouths.

647
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,401
I guess the doctor
was not there that day.

648
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,201
It was a good day.

649
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,051
Describe that memory
for just another second.

650
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,841
It was on that day I decided
to give my life to God.

651
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,441
You're probably wondering
how we became partners.

652
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,364
Let's tell the story.

653
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,410
- I was new to the force.
- And I'm a bit of a renegade.

654
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,887
- I think we get it.
- We get it.

655
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,361
- You no get along...
- Then you do get along.

656
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,244
Could I just tell
a little bit more?

657
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,568
- It's OK. I get it.
- We get it.

658
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,290
We listened to
your whole back story.

659
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,926
- I'm sure it's fascinating.
- I know. You're cops.

660
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,162
You don't get along,
then you do. We get it.

661
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,044
It's actually much more
complicated than that.

662
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,402
- That's OK.
- Hey!

663
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,801
Have you guys ever been
to Bourbon Street?

664
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,684
Hey.

665
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,169
Ahhh!

666
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,968
There you are, Sleeping Beauty.

667
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,367
I'm going back to bed, sweetie.

668
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,201
You've been asleep for 36 hours.
You feelin' OK?

669
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,803
- How many valium did you take?
- Not that many.

670
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,486
These little devils
are kicking me so hard.

671
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,166
And scratching
like a motherfucker.

672
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,049
Scratching?

673
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,490
I don't think that's right.

674
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,449
I think we should call
Dr Marsden.

675
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,807
I'm fine!

676
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,565
Oh. Don't forget.

677
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,206
Marjorie wants to do the smudge
ceremony for the house, OK?

678
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,361
OK.

679
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,607
Hah. Mm. Rrr!

680
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,810
Come on!

681
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,003
Oh, dammit!

682
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,889
Come on!

683
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,364
- Jackie boy!
- Oh, my God!

684
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,363
- Oh!
- Oh!

685
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,442
Whoo!

686
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,729
- Whoo!
- Ohhh.

687
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,008
- Wow.
- Hell.

688
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,846
My apologies. I must have
really given you a fright.

689
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,241
Just lurkin' down here
in your crawl space

690
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,966
like some terrifyin'
man-sized opossum.

691
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,283
I'm sorry.
Holy mackerel, man.

692
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,886
I'll tell you.
They're spooky, marsupials.

693
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,849
- Yeah.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

694
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,729
Now's a good time

695
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,689
to set some ground rules
about coming and going.

696
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,649
Oh, you know what?
That reminds me.

697
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,407
Has somebody removed a box
of vintage pornography?

698
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,291
I had been looking after it, you see.

699
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,364
And then I just came in,
it just wasn't there no more.

700
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,284
It had moved in some
way, shape or form.

701
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,522
- No.
- You have not seen it?

702
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,041
- No, sorry.
- No? OK. Alright. OK.

703
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,841
Well, if you happen to come by it,
I do consider it mine.

704
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,809
- Alright.
- Before you get upset...

705
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,644
I know what you're thinking.

706
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,121
I don't want Fresnel
pleasurin' himself

707
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,682
"in my crawl space
to vintage pornography."

708
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,490
I get it.

709
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,087
I hadn't yet formulated
that thought into words,

710
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,681
but now you say it,
that's exactly what I was thinking.

711
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,524
Know what, Jack?
Let me tell you something.

712
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,091
It's just like
our boy Shakespeare says.

713
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,605
"If we lovers have offended,

714
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,171
"think but this
and all is mended."

715
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,084
I hate 'Midsummer...'

716
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,129
I wanted to ask you
about Mrs Nussbaum

717
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,408
and how she was
all covered up in that dirt,

718
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,050
and then asking after you,

719
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,362
and then the police comin'
and questionin' you.

720
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,249
I mean...

721
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,289
What was that all about?

722
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,647
That was just
a stupid misunderstanding.

723
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,962
- Oh! OK, OK.
- Yeah.

724
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,327
So it wasn't like you thought
you had murdered her

725
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,124
and you were actually
buryin' her alive?

726
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,164
What? No.

727
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,044
No? OK.

728
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,526
- No.
- What?!

729
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,569
No, I-I-I... I...

730
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,246
Well, I... F...

731
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,647
<i>J... J...</i>

732
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,087
No, may I ask what gave you

733
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,163
that very specific
and detailed impression?

734
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,004
Oh, well, you know...

735
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,128
You know, Jack...

736
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,886
Sometimes I see things.

737
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,202
I see lots of detailed things.

738
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,287
We have a friendly
relationship, right?

739
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,090
Of course, F'resnel.

740
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,165
So let's not worry about
my comings and goings

741
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,442
and worry about
our friendship.

742
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,082
Like when one of us sees the
other friend murder a person

743
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,489
and dispose of the body,
then we just let it slide.

744
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,929
Even if it's a half-murder,
like with you and Mrs Nussbaum.

745
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,043
What do you say?

746
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,929
Huh?

747
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,969
What do you think about that?

748
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,445
Of course.

749
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,161
- Hey, let me ask you something.
- Mm-hm.

750
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,721
Have you seen a big, scary dog
around here?

751
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,405
OK, now, Jack,

752
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,410
I'm sorry,
that dog is as exactly alive

753
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,523
as Mrs Nussbaum is dead.

754
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,444
Dog is a...

755
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,001
- I'm sorry, I can't do the math.
- It's a ghost dog.

756
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,288
That's a straight-up ghost dog.

757
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,761
Yeah. People been
seein' the dog and whatnot.

758
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,809
And I don't believe in it.

759
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,849
When you see a big-ass dog
runnin' around,

760
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,002
there's something else that
you see - you know that is?

761
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,407
- No, what?
- Dog poop.

762
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,403
- Dog...?
- Dog poop!

763
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,289
When you got a dog
runnin' around,

764
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,408
there'll be big old piles
of dog poop everywhere.

765
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,325
And I have been here
for 15 years,

766
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,528
I ain't never, never seen
no one pile.

767
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,047
- 15 years, no...
- No poop.

768
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,363
Not a single bit.
That's just a phantom dog, OK?

769
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,126
He's probably a spectre
from the beyond, OK?

770
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,964
He's probably some kind of
devil's minion

771
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,964
who has taken a form
that he knows will scare us.

772
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,566
This is food for thought
for you right now.

773
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,611
Ghosts don't kill people.

774
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,763
People kill people.

775
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,321
And occasionally,
you'll have a person

776
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,609
who's under the evil power of a ghost
who will kill somebody.

777
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,728
But I've gotta tell you
somethin' right now.

778
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,850
This house, I think it's got
its best days ahead of it.

779
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,328
- Thanks, F'resnel.
- You're welcome, brother.

780
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,404
I think...
I need to get a po' boy.

781
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,210
Are you game?

782
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,930
Oh, no, no, no.
I shouldn't.

783
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,570
You know what? Fuck it!

784
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,524
- Mm!
- Mm. Wow.

785
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,961
- Wow.
- Mm-hm?

786
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,122
- Wow!
- Mm! Hot-diggity.

787
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,441
- Whoo!
- Mm-hm.

788
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,090
Wow!

789
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,441
- There it is.
- Brrr!

790
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,887
- Mm-hm.
- Wow!

791
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,371
Ahhh!

792
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,522
Two more shrimp po' boys!

793
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,768
Fuck!

794
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,607
- Arggh!
- Arggh!

795
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,728
Arggh! Arggh!

796
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,530
Oh! Oh!

797
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,490
I AM SO SICK OF BEING STARTLED!

798
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,006
- Mrs Nussbaum?
- No, silly, it's me!

799
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,763
I hope there's some hot water
left over

800
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,810
for ze little monsieur.

801
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,205
- Arggh!
- Oh, my God!

802
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,323
Marjorie!

803
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,689
Why is my wife's sister
in my shower?

804
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,605
I got to set some ground rules
around here, starting right now.

805
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,489
I said it was me. Jeez.

806
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,210
Wait, the little monsieur?
Really?

807
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,886
No! You have to know
the context.

808
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,650
Wait a minute.

809
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,882
I didn't know
you were circumcised, Jack.

810
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,725
Really? We never covered that
at Thanksgiving?

811
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,490
It's genital mutilation,
you know.

812
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,244
Slicing off the tops
of boys' dicks because

813
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,164
a couple-of-thousand-year-old
book

814
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,288
about a medicine man
named Moses says to do it?

815
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,761
- That's religion for you.
- Ha!

816
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,562
OK. Well, um...
Let's talk about something else.

817
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,961
When did you leave
the reservation?

818
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,885
You have a pretty nice dick,
Jack.

819
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,644
Thank you?

820
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,529
You know I don't believe
in marriage,

821
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,409
which is basically
institutionalised slavery

822
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,483
and the subjugation of women.

823
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,369
I've never heard you
say that before.

824
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,763
Just because you're married to my sister
doesn't mean you own her.

825
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,289
So, what were we talking about
before the dick thing?

826
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,205
Uh, yeah. When did you leave
the reservation?

827
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,648
Last week - I moved to
a cooperative farm in Baton Rouge.

828
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,490
- Yuck.
- It's pretty cool. Here.

829
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,887
Help a sister out
and get my back, will you?

830
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,281
- I...
- Thank you.

831
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,362
- Oh, that smells awful.
- It does not.

832
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,727
It's all-natural
organic quinoa flax lotion

833
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,848
with kelp and
octopus placenta.

834
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,322
- Octopus placenta.
- Oh, such strong hands!

835
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,609
My sister's got
such good taste.

836
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,161
Oh, yeah.

837
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,607
I'm a fucking idiot
with guys.

838
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,330
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

839
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,891
Curly Bear left me.

840
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,929
He embarrassed me
in front of the whole tribe.

841
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,650
I doubt it.

842
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,446
He stole my Subaru Outback,
credit cards and banjo.

843
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,204
And my MacBook Pro.

844
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,206
- I bet you called the cops.
- No, of course not.

845
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,523
If anything, I should be
thanking Curly Bear.

846
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,490
You know, I was so wrapped up
in material BS

847
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,244
that I was missing the moment.

848
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,841
Yeah, I know that banjo
was totally holding you back.

849
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,206
Yeah.

850
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,323
- Spin. I'll do you now.
- No.

851
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,442
Trust me - this stuff is like your skin
never breathed before,

852
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,204
like it's been suffocating
until today.

853
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,408
Skin doesn't breathe.
You ever heard that?

854
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,403
- It's impossible.
- Sure, Jack.

855
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,245
Ohhh.

856
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,609
It's not sexual, Jack.
It's just people.

857
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,850
Awesome! Well, thank you
for the octopus placenta.

858
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,729
- You're welcome.
- And that conversation.

859
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,884
And I am gonna go
anywhere else,

860
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,008
because I've got a ton to do,

861
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,891
and this is
wildly inappropriate.

862
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,646
- You have an erection, Jack.
- Yeah. I get 'em.

863
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,406
It's nothing to be embarrassed by.
It's totally natural.

864
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,722
If anything, I think
it should be celebrated.

865
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,928
That's what a maypole
symbolises, of course.

866
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,605
Of course.

867
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,842
- Hey!
- Oh! Wow!

868
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,809
It's like Grand Central Station
in here!

869
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,962
- Hi!
- You must be Marjorie.

870
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,242
Nice to meet you.
I am F'resnel.

871
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,801
I'm very sorry to hear about
Curly Bear.

872
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,964
Pfff!

873
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,007
Thank you.

874
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,369
Ai-baba!

875
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,887
We call on you,
Ogou Fe.

876
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,726
We thank you for cleaning
this house of evil.

877
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,010
We thank Jack for
opening his doors and his heart.

878
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,448
We thank F'resnel for bearing
witness to the ceremony.

879
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,685
We thank this guy for...

880
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,530
I'm just here to install
the cable internet.

881
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,603
Sorry, the circles
aren't even established,

882
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,524
so if you'll bear with us
a few minutes.

883
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,170
Cool.

884
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,684
So sorry
you got roped into this.

885
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,763
Wait. Where's my sister?

886
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,644
She's lying down.
She's not feeling well.

887
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,251
You should have insisted!

888
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,880
I did. And she did this.

889
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,642
- Goddamn! Goddamn!
- Oh, dear.

890
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,326
That could get infected.
You might want some Bactine...

891
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,006
Thank you! I put some
fucking Bactine on it!

892
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,242
- Whoa, Jack.
- I'm sorry.

893
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,525
It's just that this house has had
a strange effect on my wife,

894
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,967
and I think she might be
possessed by a demon,

895
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,690
so I'm a little stressed out.

896
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,683
This is an evil house,

897
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,002
so we're doin' this little
gris-gris ceremony.

898
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,565
And not a day too soon neither.

899
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,290
It's actually
a Haitian ceremony.

900
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,442
It cleans the space
of bad spirits.

901
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,329
Cool! Very cool.

902
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,006
Again, just here for
the cable internet.

903
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,604
- Is there marijuana in there?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

904
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,524
Is that what usually
goes in there?

905
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,207
No, it's usually just tobacco,
but tobacco is so bad for you.

906
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,409
Is it just me, y'all,
or is this some...

907
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,247
...very, very...

908
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,728
...very strong marijuana?

909
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,571
- We grow it on the reservation.
- Do you, now?

910
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,762
- Yeah.
- Good for you, baby.

911
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,924
My hands are like the Hulk.

912
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,809
You know the Incredible Hulk?

913
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,884
They're, like, regular-size?
They feel like Hulk hands.

914
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,769
Oh!

915
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,208
Like I could just punch
a crater into the ground.

916
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,283
I think I should go
to the hospital.

917
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,966
I also have to go to the hospital.
The other me.

918
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,408
He has to go to the hospital.
I can get down there to him.

919
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,087
Shh. Just ride it out.
It's like surfing a wave.

920
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,163
It seems too big at first,

921
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,085
and then soon,
you're coasting into the beach

922
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,083
and the view is fantastic.

923
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,607
You guys, it's so beautiful!

924
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,526
It's not a different me.
It's me from a different time!

925
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,243
Ohhhh!

926
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:51,007
Ee pacho! Ee home! Be clean!

927
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,326
And now this place is clean.

928
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,564
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

929
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,047
- It's an earthquake!
- Go to the doorway!

930
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,091
That is a myth! Get next to
a large piece of furniture!

931
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,686
Run outside!

932
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,521
Well, that is incredibly odd.

933
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,130
Whoa! The earthquake
is only inside the house!

934
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,964
Everybody out!

935
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,891
Goddammit! What...?

936
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,202
Hey!

937
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,964
You guys bought
the 'House of Blood', huh?

938
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,531
Yeah.

939
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,967
Mind if I ask
what you got it for?

940
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,650
320.

941
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,211
Oh.

942
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,482
- Hi!
- Hi!

943
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,962
- Hi. Hi.
- What's happen...

944
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,128
- Hi.
- Hi.

945
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,443
There's an earthquake,
but it's only inside.

946
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,045
It's not outside.

947
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,009
I say we just go
and wait it out.

948
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,845
I'm probably just gonna go,
if that's OK with you guys.

949
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,207
- Yeah, OK.
- Could you sign this?

950
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,330
Saying you're satisfied with
my installation of cable internet?

951
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,881
- OK.
- Just initial that.

952
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,247
- Great.
- Alright. Great.

953
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,402
Are you sure
you're OK to drive?

954
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:36,767
Well, I am very, very high,
so...let's find out.

955
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,490
OK.

956
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,207
We have to get out
of this house tonight.

957
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,124
This is like in the movies

958
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,123
when insane shit happens
and they still don't leave.

959
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,203
No.
Do not be rash.

960
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,482
You always do this.
This is our home.

961
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,369
Something obviously thinks
that it's its home.

962
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,124
It's trying to scare
the shit out of us!

963
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,049
You're screaming at me
and I like it here!

964
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,450
- Well, I don't like it here!
- Hey, everybody, calm down.

965
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,570
Listen, you lovebirds.
Don't fight right now, OK?

966
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,484
We'll talk this all over

967
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,884
over one of F'resnel's
famous pizza salads!

968
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,008
Ha-ha! Alright.

969
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,005
Mm!

970
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,801
Uh-huh. What did I tell you?

971
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,361
When you said "pizza salad"...

972
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,965
...I was kind of sceptical,
F'resnel.

973
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,685
I thought you were gonna
throw pizza slices in a bowl of salad.

974
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,287
That's very much what I did do.
Precisely, in fact.

975
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,330
That's why we call it pizza salad.
Know what I'm sayin'?

976
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,528
You just take a Domino's pizza,

977
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,844
you toss it in a bowl with some salad,
also from Domino's.

978
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,930
Well, I think this is
a perfect time to bring up

979
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,765
some of the weird stuff
that's been going on in the house.

980
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,644
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

981
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,640
Namely Marjorie's
'smudge' ceremony.

982
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,640
Think it may have awoken
something really big.

983
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,280
- Thank you!
- Not a c...

984
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,289
Or 'someone' could have hit our gas line
while digging in the backyard.

985
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,245
- That could also explain it.
- Actually...

986
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,520
I don't think
that explains it, Vanessa.

987
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,729
There is nothing wrong
with this house.

988
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,006
OK.

989
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,770
Old houses settle.

990
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,289
That was...
way beyond settling!

991
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,522
Way beyond settling!

992
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:47,083
I know carpentry.
That was not settling, Bob Vila! OK?

993
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,562
That was a three-minute-long
massive shock wave

994
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,162
that would register at 6 or 7
on a Richter scale.

995
01:03:54,320 --> 01:04:00,521
You are packing your kimono
and we are going to a motel tonight!

996
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,689
- Are you Jack Watson?
- Yeah.

997
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,526
Yeah. I mean,
we met here two days ago.

998
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,604
- Right here.
- Oh. Did we, Mozart?

999
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,569
Did we meet two days ago?

1000
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,770
Don't be a dick...Renzo Piano,
the famous architect.

1001
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,009
- Your fat wife around?
- My wife's pregnant with twins.

1002
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,889
Yeah
right!

1003
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,963
- Heard that before.
- Where's she at?

1004
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,441
In the kitchen eating pizza salad
with my sister-in-law

1005
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,523
and my black friend
and neighbour, F'resnel.

1006
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,041
You don't have to be
that specific with us, sir!

1007
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,770
Mind if we ask her
a couple questions?

1008
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,684
Could I say no?

1009
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,683
Yeah, but then we
come back with a warrant

1010
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,640
and you better be lawyered up,
Gregory Hines.

1011
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,802
The dancer guy?

1012
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,923
- I don't know why I said that.
- I don't either.

1013
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,611
Folks, we need you to look at
some photographs,

1014
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,889
but I will warn you,
they are a little bit graphic.

1015
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,408
- Oh, God.
- um

1016
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,089
Oh, heavens. I apologise.

1017
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,844
Yeah, they're graphic.

1018
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,804
- Jack?
- Honey...

1019
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,043
Oh, no. I'm not gonna puke.
I mean... Not a puker.

1020
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,530
Oh, God, F'resnel.

1021
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,770
It's OK.

1022
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,769
Very natural.

1023
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,888
- Oh, God.
- They're very gruesome.

1024
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,923
Very gruesome pictures.

1025
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,201
It's OK.

1026
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,890
Oh, God!

1027
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,725
- OK.
- OK.

1028
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,287
Perhaps we could continue
this conversation

1029
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,525
in the living room,
which has less vomit in it.

1030
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,562
Mm-hm.

1031
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,884
This is Dr Michael Marshall.

1032
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,687
Or, at least, it was.

1033
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,491
- 'Cause he's dead!
- Oh, my God!

1034
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,369
His records indicate

1035
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,524
that you were the last person
to see him, Ms Watson.

1036
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,606
He wrote down when he died?
That's pretty weird, isn't it?

1037
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,762
"That's pretty weird, isn't it?"

1038
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,406
Fuck you.

1039
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,962
Hers was the last appointment
on his books.

1040
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:42,045
Now, we're not saying that
you did anything, obviously.

1041
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,682
We just want to know
if you saw anything,

1042
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:49,606
heard anything...unusual -
that's all.

1043
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,922
No, I...

1044
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,128
God...

1045
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,084
I can't believe
this kind of thing can happen

1046
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,203
in this day and age.

1047
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,169
Hey.

1048
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,004
What's with the blood
on your shirt?

1049
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,567
- Oh.
- Yeah, gosh.

1050
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,609
I should have
taken care of this.

1051
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,889
I scratched myself earlier,
and, um...

1052
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,570
What'd you scratch yourself on?
A grizzly bear?

1053
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,200
The question remains.

1054
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:33,405
Did you...see anything...
unusual?

1055
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,722
I told you, no.

1056
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,370
Neither of you saw anything
out of the ordinary?

1057
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,050
That's good.
Alright, thank you, guys.

1058
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,009
Thank you very much
for your time.

1059
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,482
- No further questions from us.
- We appreciate your patience.

1060
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,008
We will be in touch.

1061
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,844
Have a good day.

1062
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,928
Well, they're hidin' something.

1063
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,811
While you were talking,
we did a full sweep of the house.

1064
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,167
We searched the place,
and we feel

1065
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,120
there is something very unholy
about this house.

1066
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,930
- Si.
- I can tell you this.

1067
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,048
That fat girl,
she doesn't know a thing.

1068
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,330
The woman, does she look
anything...like this?

1069
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,881
Whoa! Yeah.

1070
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,769
Great skates!

1071
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,809
She looks a lot like that.

1072
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,726
We take these pictures
in the house three minutes ago.

1073
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,326
What the shit?

1074
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,962
You took these in the house
three minutes ago?

1075
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,327
How'd you print 'em out
so quick?

1076
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,089
Holy cow!
That's a small printer.

1077
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,844
Tiny printer, right?

1078
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,809
It's not about the size,
it's about the quality!

1079
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,405
I'm impressed!

1080
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,728
Printer technology move forward
these days, leaps and bounds.

1081
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,211
It's adorable.

1082
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,809
This is the same tiny printer
that is endorsed by Ashton Kookener.

1083
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,531
Ashton Kushner, he say,
"Only one printer I use..."

1084
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,728
- That one!
- Well, he's cool.

1085
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,724
And if he's usin' it, by de facto,
I'm kind of cool, right?

1086
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,609
I like all of the movies

1087
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,161
where Ashton Kushner
get married by accident

1088
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,721
then wake up and, "Oh!"

1089
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,486
And the judge goes,
"I sentence you to marriage."

1090
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,610
- "You can't do this!"
- I love this.

1091
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,889
- "You cannot do this!"
- 'Cause marriage is a sentence.

1092
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,610
What were we saying?

1093
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,211
With the hell hound,

1094
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,011
with the crucifixion
in the doctor's office,

1095
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,722
we feel it is very possible
we have demonic possession.

1096
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,360
I don't know, guys.

1097
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,801
They're actually super-sweet,
and the woman, I mean,

1098
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,769
she's, like,
meggo-preggo...

1099
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,968
So I don't know.

1100
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,282
She is preggo?

1101
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,801
Jeepers.

1102
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,203
How far along is she?

1103
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:53,331
Well, guys, we're not doctors,
but she's pretty far along.

1104
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,244
She's ready to drop.

1105
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,886
Look, we'd love
to help you out, but, I mean,

1106
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,281
just because you think
someone's possessed,

1107
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,011
we have pictures of a ghost dog

1108
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,128
and a gruesome
crucifixion murder,

1109
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,089
none of these things
really connect.

1110
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,810
If they did it,
they'll slip up,

1111
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,440
and when they do,
we'll be here.

1112
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,483
We got everything
under control.

1113
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,568
- Jeez!
- What the hell...

1114
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,845
Oh! Oh, it's just a crow.

1115
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,482
- It's just a crow.
- It's just a dead crow.

1116
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,040
It's a harpy.
See for yourself, huh?

1117
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,165
- You guys get a lot of these?
- You'd be surprised.

1118
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,845
Kinda, yeah.

1119
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,331
What does it mean?

1120
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,847
The harpy? It's a harbinger.

1121
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,490
Of evil.

1122
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,808
It is a message from hell.

1123
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:57,285
Trust me, things are about
to get very, very bad.

1124
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,003
Gee whiz. I am so sorry.

1125
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,801
There was a bumblebee in the car,
and I just lost control...

1126
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,526
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck!

1127
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,882
Well...what should we do now?

1128
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,530
Now we wait.

1129
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,963
Now...we wait.

1130
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,924
- We need a doctor.
- No.

1131
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,924
We need a priest.

1132
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,883
Guys! Guys. Guys!

1133
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,764
Yaaa!

1134
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,730
Have no fear, sir.

1135
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,450
Who are you guys?

1136
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,762
We are...team four.

1137
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,730
Why did you
let them impale me with that umbrella?

1138
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,281
Do not listen to him!
He is the father of lies!

1139
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,367
Ar

1140
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,761
You guys got this?
Everybody cool?

1141
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,684
Oh, God!
Here they come!

1142
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,490
- This is some shit!
- Somebody help me!

1143
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,404
The babies are coming!

1144
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,404
Breathe, Vanessa!
Breathe, Vanessa, breathe!

1145
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,289
It hurts so bad!

1146
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,363
Remember what they
taught us in class!

1147
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,967
- I can see it! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1148
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,724
Ar

1149
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,963
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1150
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,531
- What is it?
- Oh!

1151
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,247
It's a boy.

1152
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,890
It's a perfect baby boy.

1153
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,247
Congratulations.
- It's a miracle.

1154
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,762
You ever seen a home birth before?
They're the best.

1155
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,522
- Honey! Honey!
- Just one more to go!

1156
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,808
You guys, something's wrong!

1157
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,203
It hurts so bad, this one.
Something's wrong! It's...

1158
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,727
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1159
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,611
It's biting me!
Arggh!

1160
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,446
- Focus.Focus.
- Alright.

1161
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,967
Push! Push!

1162
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,042
Arggh!

1163
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,011
Holy fucking shit!

1164
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,685
Oh, faaaa...

1165
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,007
Arggh!

1166
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,290
No, Jack!

1167
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,649
You must kill it, Jack,
you must!

1168
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,569
- He's my son!
- He's not your son!

1169
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,764
He wants to rise and rule the world
for a thousand years!

1170
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,611
Oh, shit!

1171
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,004
- Hey, guys.
- Shh!

1172
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,408
Alright, y'all, I'm goin' in.

1173
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,682
Hello, devil baby!

1174
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,801
Ain't nobody out here
tryin' to hurt you.

1175
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,846
Everything's gonna be OK,
little devil baby.

1176
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,007
Arggh!

1177
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,286
Fuck!

1178
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,920
I stubbed my goddamn toe!

1179
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,003
Oh, that smarts!

1180
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,322
I did the same thing
in there yesterday.

1181
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,050
- Hey, everybody.
- What?

1182
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,362
I'm comin' back with the baby!

1183
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,682
OK, here we go.

1184
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,128
OK. It's gonna
be alright now.

1185
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,250
Fuck this!

1186
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,689
Ar

1187
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,046
- You guys be careful!
- Whoa, sorry.

1188
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,321
Oh, no!

1189
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,329
Ar

1190
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,610
- I got a shot! I got a shot!
- No, you'll shoot one of us!

1191
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,969
- He's a great shot! Take it!
- Be careful!

1192
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,884
Being careful
don't kill devil babies.

1193
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,327
Noooooo!

1194
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,130
Shit!

1195
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,289
No! No! No! No! No! Please!

1196
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,930
Ar

1197
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,483
You! Are! Not! My! Baby!

1198
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,449
That's the spirit, Vanessa!
Punch this devil baby!

1199
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,125
Punch him back to hell!

1200
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,687
I hate you!
You're not my baby.

1201
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,568
Don't listen
to his crocodile tears.

1202
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,131
Mama.

1203
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,328
You want Mommy
to hold you? Come...

1204
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,211
It's OK. It's OK.

1205
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,890
Ah! No, no, no!

1206
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,124
Vanessa! Let go of my sister!

1207
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,723
- Little baby!
- Kill it!

1208
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,928
Let's drown it!
Do you have a woodchipper?

1209
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,970
Not to tell y'all how to parent,
but should we

1210
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,600
let your good baby watch us
murdering the devil baby?

1211
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,922
It might have a lasting impression
psychologically.

1212
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,162
Right. Good point.
Get the good baby out of here.

1213
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,771
Go, go, go!

1214
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,410
- Marjorie?
- What?

1215
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,564
I ain't known you that long,
but I'm 100% in love

1216
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,007
and want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1217
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,089
Me too!

1218
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,290
Just do me a favour
and stay alive.

1219
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,090
I will.

1220
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,005
The spirit gods
will protect me!

1221
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,486
- Oh, shit!
- Arggh!

1222
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,646
Marjorie?
No!

1223
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,885
Oh! Oh!

1224
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,606
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH!

1225
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,649
What can I do?
What can I do?

1226
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,087
Use the Jesus knife!
Kill that motherfucker!

1227
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:39,363
Demonic child, I send you back
to the depths of hell

1228
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,761
from whence you came!

1229
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,322
- Arggh! Fuck this! Fuck!
- Let me hold him down!

1230
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,850
Ah!

1231
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,769
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1232
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,841
Oh!

1233
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,925
Ar

1234
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,684
Oh! Oh, no! Ah! Oh!

1235
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,085
Not going to make it.

1236
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,090
Do it, my friend.

1237
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:34,528
I meant...not going to make it,

1238
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,331
so call an ambulance, please.

1239
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,767
Why you do the pause
in the middle of the first part

1240
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,649
of the important part?

1241
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,407
No! Devil! Babies!

1242
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,564
In! My! Parish!

1243
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,808
Ar

1244
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,961
Oh, my God.

1245
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,126
- I have an idea! Catch!
- What?

1246
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,121
No! Jack! Where are you going?

1247
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,682
You must fight! You are
the only one that can stop him!

1248
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,969
Get off my wife, you asshole.

1249
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,565
NOW!

1250
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,610
Thank you, F'resnel.

1251
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,649
My pleasure.

1252
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,320
Thank you, Father.

1253
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,164
Just doing our job.

1254
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,881
But the...the other priest...

1255
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,530
We're...we're so sorry.

1256
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,688
It's OK.

1257
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,561
He always know one day
the Lord would call his name.

1258
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,882
But he was your friend.
And I'm really sorry.

1259
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,407
Huge bummer.

1260
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,086
Knowing him,
he would rather die this way,

1261
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,489
fighting the devil, than on
a golf course or something.

1262
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,927
- That's the spirit.
- I like that.

1263
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,011
Wow!

1264
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,722
Look who found a bike!
Alright, Mrs Nussbaum!

1265
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,325
That's terrific.

1266
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,209
- Wow.
- Just terrific.

1267
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,886
What a crazy week, huh?

1268
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,362
- I was possessed by the devil!
- I know! You were such a bitch.

1269
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,204
Always freak you out
a little bit.

1270
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,089
I can't believe it started

1271
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,368
with white people movin'
into the neighbourhood.

1272
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,608
- That's crazy enough.
- Only up from there.

1273
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,048
We were already at a seven,
you know? That's crazy.

1274
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,523
I love the way
black people speak.

1275
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:43,241
So I guess everything's
wrapped up, huh?

1276
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,482
All sewn up
like a little present.

1277
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,167
What about that dirty magazine
with your picture in it from the '70s?

1278
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,243
- What's going on with all that?
- Honey!

1279
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:55,041
My mother did porno
in the '70s. I told you that.

1280
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,441
- I knew that.
- Just for a year and a half.

1281
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,886
She paid her way
through college.

1282
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,610
Look at this guy!

1283
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,088
- Look at this!
- Hell, no!

1284
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,369
- I thought you were a phantom.
- I thought so too!

1285
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,966
That's just a big dog that want
a whole lot of love.

1286
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:12,168
That dog's licking
your sister's blood.

1287
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,526
Ohhh!

1288
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,967
- That's creepy.
- No. That's a bad...

1289
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,851
- No, baby.
- Get out of here. Bye-bye.

1290
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,844
- Hey, baby.
- So...

1291
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,447
- What?
- What do we do now?

1292
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,409
Now we live, Jack.

1293
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:34,122
Now we go on about
that crazy little thing called livin'.

1294
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,089
Let's not waste another moment.

1295
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,607
Not another moment wasted.

1296
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:42,048
That's not another moment.
Our lives begin today.

1297
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,090
- Father...
- Si?

1298
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,084
- What's your name?
- Sebastian.

1299
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:52,005
Then that's what
we'll call our son.

1300
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,164
- Oh, my goodness.
- Sebastian.

1301
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:58,290
That is really lovely.
That's so sweet.

1302
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,767
Sebastian F'resnel.

1303
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,046
Watson.

1304
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,085
That's beautiful.

1305
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,601
We wouldn't have this baby
if it weren't for both of you.

1306
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,250
That part's true.

1307
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,370
We'll put Sebastian F'resnel
at the top of our list, because...

1308
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,091
Baby, there's no other list.
That's it.

1309
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,686
There is a list.
We've got a book that we've...

1310
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:26,405
It's just that it's the nicest thing
that any white person...

1311
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,841
...has ever done for me.

1312
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,411
'Cause walkin'
the street sometimes,

1313
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,325
you don't even get
as much as a hello.

1314
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,164
- F'resnel...
- And y'all just...

1315
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,243
Hello.

1316
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,605
Jack, look me in the eye.

1317
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,967
Cool. Well, you're welcome.

1318
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,761
- We'll talk about it.
- That is really somethin' else.

1319
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,649
Remember at times like these,

1320
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,201
you should see the glass
as half full.

1321
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,362
You have this beautiful baby.

1322
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,729
Do not think about the little baby
who you kill upstairs.

1323
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:02,488
If you excuse me,
I got to go bury my friend.

1324
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,405
And then I gotta go
return the rental car.

1325
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,961
- Don't be late doin' that.
- Good luck.

1326
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,088
- Peace be with you.
- Thank you, Father.

1327
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,647
Hey.

1328
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:19,522
It's a brand-new day,
the sun is shinin' in New Orleans,

1329
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:23,207
and everything is just
lookin' on up from here.

1330
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,129
I gotta tell you, man,
for a minute there,

1331
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,846
I didn't think I'd make it
through all that devilishness.

1332
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,883
Whoa! Looky here!

1333
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,805
Dog poop!
That's dog poop!

1334
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,485
Dog poop!

1335
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:38,644
Hot damn! Are you kiddin' me?
And I almost stepped in it.

1336
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,290
Must be my lucky day.

1337
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,408
Ar

1338
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,324
Fuck!

1339
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,246
Oh! Oh!
Did I just hit your friend?

1341
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,089
