2
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,872
Listen, I'm from the Bronx,
so you need to keep it simple.

3
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,240
Why is the bank buying all this
missile-guidance stuff from Calvini?

4
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,343
I don't get it.

5
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,641
The window will stay closed.

6
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,483
You need to relax.

7
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,852
I'm more comfortable tense.

8
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,083
You came to us, remember?

9
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,455
You wanted a way out
and I'm offering you one.

10
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,427
I only met you 30 minutes ago...

11
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:17,126
...and now you expect me just
to walk away from everything I know...

12
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,462
...put my life in your hands.

13
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,633
You want a little more time
to think things through, I get it...

14
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,909
...but we're gonna need
another meet...

15
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,008
...and I'm gonna need to
see some paper.

16
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,615
Yes. Now get out of the car.

17
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,436
<i>- Hey.
- Ella?</i>

18
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,443
<i>- You done?
- Yeah, I just met with him.</i>

19
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,946
<i>- And?
- Oh, he's real.</i>

20
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,345
He's real enough
to blow this thing wide open.

21
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,885
He told me the bank's
buying $200 million worth...

22
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,954
...of missile-guidance systems.

23
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,489
<i>- What do they need those for?
- I don't know.</i>

24
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,126
<i>You gonna see him a second time?</i>

25
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,526
Yeah, yeah. Listen, we're gonna meet
again. He's agreed to bring me paper.

26
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,530
Right, I'll call you later.

27
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,765
Thanks, Elle.

28
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,557
Hey.

29
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,314
Are you experiencing
any blurred or double vision?

30
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,789
No.

31
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,885
Nothing.

32
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,696
Just follow the light, please.

33
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,071
It's been noted that you were
experiencing ringing in your ears.

34
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,497
Yes.

35
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,542
Well, I would like to keep you here
overnight for observation.

36
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,976
That won't be necessary.

37
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,517
Where's my colleague?

38
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,817
Thomas Schumer.

39
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,296
It was definitely a heart attack?

40
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,276
"Acute myocardial infarction. " Yes.

41
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,818
Your penlight, can I use it?

42
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,030
What are you doing?

43
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,300
Can you help me turn him over?

44
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,345
- I'm afraid I can't allow you to...
- Just help me.

45
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,470
We need to contact the Berlin police
and request an immediate autopsy.

46
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,036
Why?

47
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,498
Because I don't think this man
died of natural causes.

48
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,404
Come on, Ella.

49
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,671
If Schumer met this insider
in Berlin...

50
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,543
...odds are this guy's
a foreign national. So it's federal.

51
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,117
But you're not listening to me.
Let them meet again.

52
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,788
The guy's gonna bring paper
and Tommy will close him.

53
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,925
You still have to coordinate with
Justice if you want witness protection.

54
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,857
I just tried both their cells again.
Straight to voicemail.

55
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,223
Shit.

56
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,764
I'm gonna try Tommy's wife at work.
If I have to bring DOJ into this...

57
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,835
...they're gonna do what they've
always done with this.

58
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,905
They're gonna stall us with red tape,
informant's gonna bolt...

59
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,507
...and I'm telling you,
he could be the bombshell...

60
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,235
...we've spent the last two years
looking for.

61
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,743
Voicemail.

62
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,349
What's going on?
Why aren't they calling us back?

63
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,453
What do you want me to do?
I can't afford another turf war.

64
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,591
- It's Salinger.
- Finally. Put him on speaker.

65
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,197
Jesus, Lou.
What took you guys so long?

66
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,233
Hello? You there?

67
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,903
<i>Yeah.</i>

68
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,038
So, what's up?

69
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,398
<i>Tommy's dead.</i>

70
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,272
What?

71
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,811
<i>He's dead, Ella.</i>

72
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,714
<i>I need you to get over here
as soon as you can.</i>

73
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,318
Unnaturally red blood,
lambent membranes.

74
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,756
Two key indicators
of hydrocyanic poisoning.

75
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,463
This lesion on the neck...

76
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,191
...is how the poison was introduced
into the bloodstream, percutaneously.

77
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,426
The lesion tested negative
for any poison.

78
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,095
There are any number of reasons
for this discoloration of the blood...

79
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,275
...least likely of which
is hydrocyanic...

80
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,467
I'm telling you, he was murdered.

81
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,287
Well, I'm assuming
you suspect a combination...

82
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,513
...of prussic acid and DMSO...

83
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,916
...but then the reaction time
would have been immediate.

84
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,924
Within one minute.

85
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,893
Which means the killer
would have had to deliver the toxin...

86
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,328
...after Schumer exited the car.

87
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,370
So did you see anything unusual?

88
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,101
Anybody approaching Schumer?

89
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,379
No. I mean...

90
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,483
I don't know.

91
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,221
What is it that makes you so certain
he was assassinated?

92
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,429
Agent Salinger and I have reason
to believe this might be connected...

93
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,866
...to an ongoing investigation
being conducted...

94
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,235
...by both my team at the Manhattan
DA's office and Interpol.

95
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,041
- What investigation?
- I run a group at Interpol...

96
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,702
...that focuses on financial operations
associated with organized crime.

97
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,274
About two years ago, we began
receiving correlated intelligence...

98
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:16,046
...regarding the illicit activities of
a bank based out of Luxembourg...

99
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,553
...the International Bank
of Business and Credit.

100
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,625
Under the direction of its chairman,
Jonas Skarssen...

101
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,729
...we believe the IBBC has quietly
become the bank of choice...

102
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,798
...for monies associated with
organized crime, capital flight...

103
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,834
How is any of this related to Schumer
and the New York DA's office?

104
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,403
The IBBC's Manhattan branch...

105
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,598
...is the epicenter of its U.S.
money-laundering operation.

106
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,277
Schumer and I
were working this case together.

107
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,073
Agent Salinger and his department
have been assisting us.

108
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,682
Why weren't we informed
of these details prior to this briefing?

109
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,604
What was Schumer doing
here in Berlin?

110
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,568
I set him up on a blind date
with an IBBC executive...

111
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,770
...who was aware of our investigation
and looking to make a deal.

112
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,142
And the identity of this informant?

113
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,877
We don't know. He took precautions
to keep his identity anonymous.

114
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,981
For the past 12 hours,
I've been trying hard to find him.

115
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,318
I believe that if this man isn't
already dead, he soon will be.

116
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,887
Why?

117
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,660
Because, just like Schumer...

118
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,660
...anyone that's in a position
to move against this bank...

119
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,801
...has either ended up dead
or disappeared.

120
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,767
Agent Salinger,
given your history with this matter...

121
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,135
...I should think
you would be more careful...

122
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,777
...before making
such extreme accusations.

123
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,209
My history?
What are you talking about?

124
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,406
We've reviewed your dossier.

125
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,912
Have you?

126
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,848
Well, that means you know
just about shit.

127
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:06,026
I realize this is a trying time
for you both, but until I'm provided...

128
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,429
...with something more compelling
than unsubstantiated theories...

129
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:14,572
...pursuing the IBBC is simply
not going to happen here in Germany.

130
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,983
Concorde Hotel, please.

131
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,959
What was that back there? What
history was Diemer talking about?

132
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,889
- Don't worry.
- Don't give me that shit.

133
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,825
- What do they know that I don't?
- They don't know anything.

134
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,464
Enough to get a rise out of you.

135
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,329
I'm not getting into it.
You're so curious, read my file.

136
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,666
I should never have let Tommy
walk into this.

137
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,242
You didn't. I approved the meet.

138
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,881
I was across the fucking street, Ella.

139
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,912
I was right there.

140
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,120
I saw him go down.

141
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,985
I didn't see a thing.

142
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,097
We won't let them bury this, Lou.

143
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,110
This canvas appeals to you?

144
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,656
I like the look of agony.

145
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,053
Why?

146
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,497
Because I know it's true.

147
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,398
What am I doing here?

148
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,205
Umberto Calvini is disengaging
from the deal.

149
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:44,148
Your principle would like to bring
you in to troubleshoot the situation.

150
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,210
If Calvini refuses to move forward, my
involvement won't make a difference.

151
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,755
Your involvement would allow them
to appeal to Calvini's two sons...

152
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,983
...who are much more open-minded.

153
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,228
You'll find all the details in the file.

154
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,366
I'll contact you
once negotiations are underway.

155
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,591
IBBC executive dies
in freak road accident

156
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,611
Luxembourg high society in shock
at death of Andre Clement

157
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,266
Rene?

158
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,495
What are you doing here so early?

159
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,968
Salinger.

160
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,448
I found the insider.

161
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,449
What?

162
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,460
I found the guy that Schumer
met with in Berlin.

163
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,687
Andre Clement?

164
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,957
The IBBC's senior vice president
of acquisitions.

165
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,000
He was killed in a road accident
just outside Luxembourg...

166
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,438
...approximately nine hours
after Schumer's death.

167
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,340
And this is the gendarmerie's
preliminary accident report.

168
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,776
He arrived in Berlin at 8 a. m...

169
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,515
...on Luxair, Flight 9871
from Luxembourg.

170
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,545
What doesn't track is in his statement,
the IBBC chairman, Jonas Skarssen...

171
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,159
...claims that Clement had been with
him in Luxembourg since 10 a. m...

172
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,058
...which is obviously impossible
if Clement arrived in Berlin at 8 a. m.

173
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,366
Did the gendarmerie say anything
about this inconsistency?

174
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,501
Nothing.

175
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,467
- I haven't told them.
- What?

176
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,301
I wanna go to Luxembourg
and question Skarssen myself.

177
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,443
- No. Absolutely no.
- Viktor, listen to me.

178
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,477
I go to Luxembourg,
Skarssen confirms that statement...

179
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,649
...I catch him in that lie,
I can build...

180
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,478
For chrissake, Lou,
you're not at the Yard anymore.

181
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,348
Interpol is not
in the law-enforcement business.

182
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,521
We deal in intelligence
and facilitation.

183
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,189
Focus on that, work that and pass your
take onto the appropriate authorities.

184
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,488
And then what?

185
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,998
You know we've been circulating
our take since the very beginning.

186
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,363
No one ever does anything,
no one ever can.

187
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,234
Whatever case we have gets lost
in the complexities of international law.

188
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,106
Schumer, Clement...

189
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,907
...this entire fucking wall.

190
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,747
There's nothing that complex
about cold-blooded murder.

191
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,733
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Skarssen.

192
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:34,072
- Your name, please?
- Mr. Salinger? Please follow me.

193
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,511
Mr. Skarssen.

194
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,656
Mr. Skarssen.

195
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,464
Agent Salinger? Please follow me.

196
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,956
Mr. White.

197
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,455
Agent Salinger.
I apologize for the wait.

198
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,631
I'm Martin White,
the IBBC's legal counsel.

199
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,130
This is Commissioner Villon
of the gendarmerie.

200
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:06,031
I thought it useful for him to join us,
considering the nature of your query.

201
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,830
Please, have a seat.

202
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,738
I think there's
some misunderstanding.

203
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,742
I'm here to speak with Mr. Skarssen.

204
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:19,213
Yes, but as Mr. Skarssen's attorney,
I insisted that I speak with you first.

205
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,052
Mr. White, I had a confirmed meeting
with Mr. Skarssen at 11:00.

206
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,322
If I was gonna meet with you first,
why didn't anybody tell me?

207
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,119
I understand,
and I'm sorry for the confusion...

208
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,388
...but I'm sure I can help
answer your questions.

209
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,362
Now, please, have a seat.

210
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,283
As I'm sure you're aware...

211
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,719
...I have some questions
regarding Andre Clement.

212
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,958
Yes.

213
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,628
It's my understanding
that Mr. Clement was working...

214
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,766
...at Mr. Skarssen's residence
the night he was killed.

215
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,458
The night of the accident, yes.

216
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,937
What time did he arrive
at Skarssen's home that day?

217
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,507
If I recall correctly, around 6 p. m.

218
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,912
- You were there?
- Yes.

219
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,178
And you're certain about this time?

220
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,677
Quite.

221
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,984
I'm confused.

222
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,223
What you're telling me conflicts
with Skarssen's statement...

223
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,589
...in the gendarmerie's
accident report...

224
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,891
...which was that Clement had been
working with him since 10 a. m.

225
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,233
I was present when Mr. Skarssen
gave his statement.

226
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,463
- That is not what he said.
- It is according to this report.

227
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,936
May I?

228
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,788
There is an error
in the preliminary draft.

229
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,987
The time is wrong.

230
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,534
The finalized report here
says Clement arrived at 6 p. m.

231
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,141
Clerical errors like this
can happen from time to time.

232
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,810
This is why the gendarmerie
discourages the release...

233
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,208
...of any preliminary documentation
pertaining to open cases.

234
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,878
So is there anything else
we can do for you, Agent Salinger?

235
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,386
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

236
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,431
<i>I just got the results from
the tox analysis I ran on Schumer.</i>

237
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,627
<i>- And?
- It's inconclusive.</i>

238
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,272
Inconclusive? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

239
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,034
<i>They found trace elements
of cyanide in his blood...</i>

240
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,336
<i>...but the levels
are not nearly high enough...</i>

241
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,980
<i>...to meet their criteria
for poisoning.</i>

242
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,044
<i>Are you there?</i>

243
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,695
Sorry.

244
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,042
I'm sorry.

245
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,339
Are you crazy?

246
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,900
Madame Clement?

247
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,139
It's Eleanor Whitman from the
New York District Attorney's office.

248
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,279
I already left a couple
messages just...

249
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,662
Mrs. Clement,
I'm sorry to keep calling you.

250
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,306
I can only imagine what a difficult time
this must be for you.

251
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:40,075
But I'm not convinced your
husband's death was an accident.

252
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,808
Look, here's my cell number.

253
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:49,249
001-917-135-6565.

254
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,853
You can call any time...

255
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:55,516
<i>Stop calling me. I have nothing
to say to you. Just leave me alone.</i>

256
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,525
Please. I just need to ask you
a few questions.

257
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,358
<i>I have two children.
They've already lost their father.</i>

258
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:05,525
<i>- I understand.
- No, you don't.</i>

259
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,364
Are you aware your husband
met with our investigators...

260
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,304
...the day he was killed?

261
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,150
You ever planning to come to bed?

262
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,514
- I heard your voice.
- I'm sorry.

263
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,158
- When'd he come in here?
- An hour ago.

264
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,623
<i>T. rex was in the closet again.</i>

265
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,962
Let me take him back.

266
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,633
Come on, buddy.

267
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,489
Lou?

268
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,161
They knew about
the discrepancy in the report.

269
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,862
They had Skarssen's
statement changed.

270
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,438
How did they know, Viktor?

271
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,667
- Come inside.
- No.

272
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,806
Are you insane? It's freezing out.

273
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,480
Come outside.

274
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,242
Stop it!

275
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,389
Lou, wait.

276
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:45,987
Lou.

277
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,993
Have you lost your mind?

278
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,450
I think we take the dog for a walk.

279
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,810
Get some fresh air.

280
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,191
Who did this?

281
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,732
Who do you think?

282
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:26,997
From my apartment.

283
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,833
Whitman's got them too.

284
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,775
We need to inform
the secretary general immediately.

285
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,138
You gotta be kidding.

286
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,974
We start setting off alarms,
the opportunity will be lost.

287
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,206
Opportunity?

288
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,008
The last thing Schumer told Ella...

289
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,587
...was that Clement was giving him
information on an IBBC arms deal.

290
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,018
Umberto Calvini.

291
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,491
Chairman of Calvini Defense, one
of the largest defense contractors.

292
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,096
And probably
Italy's next prime minister.

293
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,995
This guy standing next to him,
that's our insider.

294
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,063
Andre Clement.

295
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,395
And?

296
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,473
Whitman found out that Clement
was negotiating for the IBBC...

297
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,042
...to purchase a large number
of missile guidance...

298
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,406
...and control systems
from Calvini Defense.

299
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,014
But at the very last minute,
the deal collapsed.

300
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,206
What happened?

301
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,546
We don't know. Whitman's
meeting me in Milan tomorrow.

302
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,689
We're gonna talk to Calvini
and find out.

303
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,857
- Hey.
- Hey.

304
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,094
Eleanor Whitman,
this is Inspector Alberto Cerutti.

305
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,323
- Charmed.
- Nice to meet you.

306
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,899
Please, there's not much time.

307
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,730
Calvini leaves for Turin
immediately after this engagement.

308
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,429
I didn't realize we were meeting
at a political rally.

309
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,235
Best we could do
on such short notice.

310
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,449
Thirtieth floor. I'll be waiting outside.

311
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,525
You need to press the button.

312
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,392
You look awful.

313
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,571
Thanks.

314
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,501
When was the last time
you got any sleep?

315
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,571
Don't know.

316
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,776
When was the last time
you had a healthy meal?

317
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,911
Can't remember.

318
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:06,289
- How about the last time you got laid?
- Why, are you offering?

319
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,551
You need to take better care
of yourself, Lou.

320
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,562
I can't have you crash and burn
like you did two years ago.

321
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,931
Please follow me.

322
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,702
This meeting is strictly off the record.

323
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:25,205
Mr. Calvini cannot be entangled
in your investigation...

324
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,369
...nor can his participation in this
discussion find its way to the press.

325
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,570
We understand.

326
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,616
Wait here for a moment.

327
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,650
So you read my file.

328
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,283
I made a few calls to London.

329
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,384
You should've told me everything...

330
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:46,496
...with your IBBC case at the Yard.
You should've told me it's why you left.

331
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,997
What did they tell you?

332
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,927
That you screwed up because
the witness you brought in was a joke.

333
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,971
And when you were forced to
drop him, the case fell apart.

334
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,507
You flipped out, attacked the assistant
commissioner and broke his nose.

335
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,272
My case did not fall apart, it was shut
down, and my witness was rock-solid.

336
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,414
He gave us everything we needed
against the bank...

337
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,917
...and then suddenly, out of nowhere,
my AC forced me to cut him loose.

338
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,851
Three days later,
they all died in a car crash.

339
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,451
- "They"?
- He had a wife and two kids.

340
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,593
Mr. Calvini, we'd like to know
why the IBBC, a bank...

341
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:27,067
...would be purchasing millions
of dollars worth of missile guidance...

342
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,103
...and control systems
from your company.

343
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,007
The IBBC has purchased
billions of dollars worth...

344
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:39,115
...of Silkworm missiles from
the People's Republic of China...

345
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,445
...which they have presold
to clients in the Middle East...

346
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,212
...contingent upon the missiles...

347
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,050
...being equipped
with VOLCON guidance systems.

348
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:52,062
My company's one of only two in the
world which produce the VOLCON.

349
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:56,529
- Who's the other?
- Sunay. Ahmet Sunay.

350
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,326
Of Turkish Aerotech?

351
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,905
But why is the bank committing
so much capital and resources...

352
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,302
...to the sale of these missiles?

353
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,636
It's a test.

354
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,513
Small arms
are the only weapons used...

355
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,018
...in 99 percent
of the world's conflicts...

356
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,158
...and no one has the capacity
to manufacture them...

357
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,157
...faster and cheaper than China.

358
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,027
What Skarssen is attempting to do...

359
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,592
...is to make the IBBC
the exclusive broker...

360
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:34,438
...of Chinese small arms
to the Third World.

361
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,270
And the missile deal
is the gateway transaction.

362
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:42,407
Yeah, but billions of dollars invested
simply to be a broker?

363
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,275
There can't be much profit for them.

364
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,179
No. This is not about making profit
from weapon sales.

365
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,013
It's about control.

366
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:57,192
Control the flow of weapons,
control the conflict.

367
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,794
No.

368
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,562
No, no. The IBBC is a bank.

369
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:06,503
Their objective isn't
to control the conflict...

370
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:10,071
...it's to control the debt
that the conflict produces.

371
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:14,043
You see, the real value
of a conflict...

372
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,542
...the true value...

373
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,778
...is in the debt that it creates.

374
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,213
You control the debt...

375
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,146
...you control everything.

376
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,655
You find this upsetting, yes?

377
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,023
But this is the very essence
of the banking industry...

378
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:38,429
...to make us all,
whether we be nations or individuals...

379
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,934
...slaves to debt.

380
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,602
You sound like
you're not very fond of the IBBC.

381
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,675
What happened?

382
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,407
I was fond of Andre Clement.

383
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,083
I trusted him...

384
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,946
...and he was a good friend.

385
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,193
Then help us make sure
he didn't die in vain.

386
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,967
Find me after the speech.

387
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,603
We can talk in the car
on my way to the airport.

388
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,253
Umberto Calvini.

389
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,647
Definitely connected to any...

390
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,225
What the hell is going on?

391
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,957
They shot him!

392
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,989
Secure this area
and block all exits, now.

393
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,789
Go!

394
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,893
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

395
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,086
I think so.

396
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,562
Take that left.
Maybe you can cut him off.

397
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,234
Go.

398
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Go!

399
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,494
Turn off the engine...

400
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,073
...and stick your hands
out of the window!

401
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,238
Turn off the engine...

402
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,471
...and stick your hands
out of the window! Now!

403
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:52,429
Our relationship with the Swiss has
become impossible over the past year.

404
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,570
They are discounting
our dollar deposits...

405
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,138
...by 160 basis points below par.

406
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,605
They have doubled the cost
of moving our money.

407
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,540
Well, general, what do you expect?

408
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,577
You've been in the jungle
long enough...

409
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,808
...to know that when the lion kills,
it's the jackal that profits.

410
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,485
Yes.

411
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,985
The IBBC is specifically structured...

412
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,056
...to handle the particular needs
of your type of organization.

413
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,585
We can give you better rates
and terms than other competitors...

414
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,221
...but we can offer you much more:

415
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,088
Weapons...

416
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,035
...intelligence, logistical support...

417
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,637
...everything that
the Revolutionary Freedom Front...

418
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,830
...would need to revive itself.

419
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,236
But in exchange for what?

420
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,936
You must understand,
the RFF has no money.

421
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:44,913
Money is not this institution's
primary medium of exchange.

422
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,883
What are you proposing exactly?

423
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,496
We believe that, with the right kind
of direction and support...

424
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,792
...the RFF could become a very
influential force in your country.

425
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,630
Perhaps potent enough...

426
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:03,034
...to stage a successful coup
in the coming months.

427
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,371
And if this were possible...

428
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,713
...what does your bank
hope to gain from it?

429
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,849
The gratitude and consideration
of a very influential friend.

430
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:21,286
Excuse me.

431
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,487
Mr. White and Mr. Ehames
asked me to interrupt.

432
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,060
Would you excuse me, general?
I'll be right back.

433
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,543
What is it?

434
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:52,286
Approximately 30 minutes ago,
Umberto Calvini was assassinated...

435
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,721
...while giving a speech
at a political rally in Milan.

436
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,687
We've been discussing it.

437
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,567
I think we should wait until
the authorities resolve the matter...

438
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,169
...and then approach the sons
to revive negotiations.

439
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:09,897
How long will this take?

440
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:14,009
I've been assured the investigation
will move swiftly...

441
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:19,312
...but unexpected fallout of an event
like this can always complicate things.

442
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,951
We only have 60 days left
to deliver the worms.

443
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,710
There's no time for complications.

444
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:27,015
That's a risk you take
with such an ambitious agenda.

445
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,627
I don't foresee any problems.
Had it not been for their father...

446
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,820
...Mario and Enzo Calvini
would have made our deal long ago.

447
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,431
Now there's no reason
for them not to move forward.

448
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:40,866
An important man and devoted father
has just been killed.

449
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,508
I suggest that we send a letter
to Calvini's family...

450
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:49,668
...extending our heartfelt prayers
and condolences for their terrible loss.

451
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,505
I don't know, but I'm okay.

452
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,082
The doctors
checked me out thoroughly.

453
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,719
Kiss Jake for me, will you?

454
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:08,392
So the shooter was identified
as a member of the Red Brigade.

455
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,294
What about the guy in the car?

456
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,698
Car was stolen. They were unable
to lift prints, fibers or residue...

457
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,135
...or locate any witnesses
who saw him exiting the vehicle.

458
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,400
- So?
- So the carabinieri are announcing...

459
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,475
...that the Red Brigade
was responsible...

460
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,273
...for the assassination
at the press conference tonight.

461
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,711
We're not convinced
the Red Brigade's behind this.

462
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,647
Someone could simply be
making it appear as though they are.

463
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,387
This isn't my case...

464
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,559
...and the man in charge
of the investigation is very powerful...

465
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:36,953
...and a real bastard.

466
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,426
All we wanna do
is just look around a little.

467
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,181
- Antonio.
- Alberto.

468
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:07,020
Just a moment.

469
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,786
They done
the trajectory analysis yet?

470
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:40,014
Cerutti said no.

471
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,301
If there was a second shooter,
he could've positioned himself here.

472
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,804
The stopwatch they found
in the room...

473
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,035
...it was set on
a one-minute countdown, yes?

474
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,704
Right. Calvini was killed a little
over one minute into his speech.

475
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,951
What if this was all synchronized?

476
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,418
Okay...

477
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,922
...let's say I'm the second shooter.

478
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,091
<i>The guy below
doesn't know I'm here...</i>

479
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,926
<i>...but I'm positioned
right above his room.</i>

480
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:35,899
<i>I'm armed with a Sauer 200 rifle,
just like he is.</i>

481
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,241
I have a stopwatch set
on a one-minute countdown...

482
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,809
<i>...which I start when Calvini
begins his speech.</i>

483
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,480
The sniper below has been instructed
to do the same...

484
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,343
...because that's when
he's gonna fire his first bullet.

485
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,851
If he misses, I'm ready to
follow through with one of my own.

486
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,748
The sniper fires, misses.

487
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,524
<i>Seconds later...</i>

488
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,591
...I take Calvini out with a headshot.

489
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:03,893
It's a good theory,
but there's one problem.

490
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,762
Why?

491
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,806
Two shots were fired
from the window...

492
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,771
<i>...two slugs were recovered...</i>

493
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,274
...and two casings were found
next to the gun...

494
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,040
...ballistics confirming that the casings
came from the gun in the hotel room.

495
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,309
<i>So if the kill shot came from
a second shooter here on the roof...</i>

496
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,181
...that'd be a total
of three bullets fired.

497
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,687
How do you explain
the absence of the third bullet?

498
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,090
I can't.

499
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,757
I think I've seen this print before.

500
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,984
Where?

501
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,924
Hanging on the wall of my office.

502
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,178
So this was lifted from the scene of the
Stefan Heuss hit in Brussels last year.

503
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,476
A former IMF executive director.

504
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,915
Has he ever seen
a tread pattern like this before?

505
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:43,293
He believes it came from
a custom shoe made for a leg brace.

506
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,525
The braces are typically
made out of steel...

507
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,704
...or alloy,
but the condition of the leg...

508
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:50,271
...would determine the specific
type of device used.

509
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,704
He says that the prints
are a probable match.

510
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,850
Please get these over to Alan Kovacs
at FBl Impressions right away...

511
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,747
...and make sure
he has my contact numbers.

512
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:06,382
Thanks.

513
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:10,120
Ella, if the FBl confirms
that these prints are a match...

514
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,727
...it means the bank's
used the same assassin twice.

515
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:17,599
Which means if we can get him,
we can get the bank.

516
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,431
What was that?

517
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,702
<i>That was Capitano Barillo, the man
in charge of the Calvini investigation.</i>

518
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:05,109
- What did he want?
- My ass on a platter...

519
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,613
...and both of you
on the next flight out of Milan.

520
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,986
Didn't you tell him
what we just found?

521
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,654
I tried.

522
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,847
Fuck him.
He can't force us to leave.

523
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,652
He has already spoken
to your superiors.

524
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,988
You have both been ordered home.

525
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,694
Arnie, you can't just sit there...

526
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:24,992
...and lecture me
about protocol and procedure.

527
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,965
You know what's happening here.

528
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,661
Well, who gives a shit
about jurisdictional provenance?

529
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,068
We just had a major breakthrough.

530
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,143
That's great, Arnie.
You're a real stand-up guy.

531
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,473
This is total bullshit.

532
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,982
I wish I could have
been more helpful.

533
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,118
Oh, no, you've been great, Alberto.

534
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,255
I'm gonna do everything I can
to take the heat off you.

535
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:48,122
Thanks.

536
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:52,493
Thanks for everything.
Sorry for all the trouble we caused.

537
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:05,830
What?

538
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:08,443
His leg brace would be made
of metal, right?

539
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,009
- So?
- So if he left through an airport...

540
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,410
...security would have made him
show it to them.

541
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,262
That's definitely him.

542
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:39,135
- He doesn't look like much.
- I think that's the idea.

543
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,537
Seems to know
where the cameras are.

544
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,714
Look how he always angles his face
just out of our line of sight.

545
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:46,314
Even if you do find him...

546
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:49,713
...that's not enough evidence to
convict the man without a confession.

547
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,151
If we find him, prosecution will be
irrelevant. He'll be a marked man.

548
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:56,086
He can either die for the bank
or flip for us.

549
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:01,464
I got him. He is traveling under
the name Sherwood, Timothy M.

550
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:05,795
He boarded Flight Alitalia 422,
departing Milan at 6 p. m. yesterday...

551
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,436
...and arriving in New York
at JFK at 10 p. m.

552
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,809
What time's the next flight
to New York?

553
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,816
Detectives Hubbard, Ward, Ornelas,
this is Agent Lou Salinger.

554
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,078
- Finally.
- How you doing?

555
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:00,813
- Let me take that.
- Thanks. So, what do we have?

556
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,150
Well, we got lucky.

557
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,961
Some clip shots of him
moving through customs.

558
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,994
That's a good one.

559
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:13,458
The Sherwood ID he used? It's clean.
All of it attached to a dead address.

560
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,467
Where'd he go
after he cleared customs?

561
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,505
Don't know.
CCTV footage lost him at the curb.

562
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,700
We canvassed all the limousine
and taxicab companies in the city.

563
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:25,814
Airport parking, rental agencies.
Didn't come up with shit.

564
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:28,075
There's a chance
he might live in the city.

565
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:29,411
Why is that?

566
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,486
Kovacs from FBl Impressions called.

567
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:37,752
"The footprint was left by a shoe
used for knee-ankle-foot orthosis.

568
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,925
The tread pattern is exclusive
to shoes produced...

569
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,396
...at the Isaacson Orthopedic Institute
here in the city. "

570
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,535
The shoe could have only come
from there.

571
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,897
Do you have a contact person
to run down?

572
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:50,697
We got Dr. Isaacson.

573
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,508
All right. You guys go check it out.
I'm expected at the office.

574
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,701
Hubb?

575
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,041
Get ready for the smackdown.
He's gonna come at you hard.

576
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,289
- Who is it?
- N.Y.P.D.

577
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:50,691
- Dr. Isaacson?
- Yeah.

578
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,994
Detective Ornelas, N.Y.P.D.
This is my partner, Detective Ward.

579
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,434
- We'd like to ask a couple questions.
- Why?

580
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,364
What do you want?
Why are you here?

581
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:02,204
Calm down. We just wanna ask you
a few questions about a patient.

582
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,006
Patient? What patient?
Come on, you know what time it is?

583
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,847
Listen, I'm sorry. I must go.
I really didn't do anything.

584
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,418
- I'm sorry. Good night.
- Doctor, if we could...

585
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:17,318
Douche bag's pinned out of his mind.
He thinks we're here to bust him.

586
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,626
Dr. Isaacson, please.

587
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:25,096
We have reason to believe your life
is in danger, grave danger.

588
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,036
We think one of your patients
is trying to kill you.

589
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:35,300
Kill me?

590
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,879
I'm Agent Salinger with Interpol.
We're assisting in this manhunt.

591
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:42,483
Why would a patient wanna kill me?
I'm an orthopedist.

592
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,985
This man's a psychotic. He's already
butchered seven doctors in Europe.

593
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,022
We got some serious evidence
to suggest you may be next.

594
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,522
Have you ever seen this man?

595
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,660
No, no. I don't think so.

596
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:59,426
Does the name Timothy Sherwood
mean anything to you, doctor?

597
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:02,366
No. How do you know
he's a patient of mine?

598
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:03,630
We have his footprint.

599
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,365
Yeah, the shoe was manufactured
by AGM Biomechanics...

600
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:10,910
...exclusively for the Isaacson Institute,
model K-A-F-O 1-2-1.

601
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,877
K- A-F-O 1-2-1?

602
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,176
We started prescribing
that three years ago.

603
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,417
We've used it on hundreds
of our patients.

604
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,680
Well, then we're gonna need
to review all of your files.

605
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,383
Right now?

606
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:26,619
Doctor, we need to find this man
before he finds you.

607
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:31,893
- What are you trying to do here, Ella?
- I'm doing my job.

608
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:34,696
You have any idea of the shitstorm
you've gotten me into?

609
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,498
- We're just trying to get to the truth.
- I get it.

610
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:42,009
You need to remember there's what
people wanna hear, wanna believe...

611
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:44,646
...there's everything else,
then there's the truth.

612
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:48,147
And since when is that okay?
I can't believe you're saying this to me.

613
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,410
The truth means responsibility, Arnie.

614
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,589
Exactly, which is why
everyone dreads it.

615
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,322
Look...

616
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,999
The IBBC is using one assassin
for all their hits...

617
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,237
...and we've tracked him here
to New York.

618
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:16,539
This guy can bury them.

619
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,745
They want me to put a gun
to your head.

620
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,950
You don't find this guy,
and I mean quick...

621
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,386
...they're gonna make me
pull the trigger.

622
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,597
- Do you want dessert?
- No, thank you.

623
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,759
I'd like one.

624
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:40,695
This is a game that rewards
patience and balance.

625
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:44,396
You must think like a man of action
and act like a man of thought.

626
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,614
Gentlemen.

627
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,585
<i>Sorry to disturb you at home.
I'm afraid this couldn't wait.</i>

628
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:02,585
Yes?

629
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,987
<i>Salinger was in Milan.</i>

630
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,719
<i>Whitman too.</i>

631
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,192
<i>They have the scent.</i>

632
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:12,266
<i>It's only a matter of time
before they find our consultant.</i>

633
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,866
Any recommendations?

634
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,102
<i>I strongly advise
against doing anything...</i>

635
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,679
<i>...that would heighten your exposure
right now.</i>

636
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:28,214
<i>Wilhelm, we've leveraged ourselves
over the edge.</i>

637
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:31,353
<i>If we don't meet the delivery date,
buyers will cancel orders...</i>

638
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:32,885
<i>...our plans will implode...</i>

639
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,455
<i>...and this bank will be left
a bill it cannot pay.</i>

640
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,888
<i>Heightening exposure
is the least of our problems.</i>

641
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,358
<i>I agree.
We're about to engage Calvini's sons.</i>

642
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:42,724
<i>We can't allow anyone
to put our agenda at risk.</i>

643
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,230
<i>We must sever all ties
with the consultant.</i>

644
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,596
<i>Consider the mark, gentlemen.</i>

645
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:52,741
<i>Doing this could be
a very messy affair.</i>

646
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,172
<i>Well, then make it one.</i>

647
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,972
<i>I don't know why you pay me
to advise on these matters.</i>

648
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:02,049
<i>It is clear that you don't want my
counsel, only my corroboration.</i>

649
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:05,847
<i>Really, Wilhelm. We've had
just about all we can take of you.</i>

650
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:11,015
<i>Yes. I've had about all I can take
of myself.</i>

651
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,259
<i>How would you like us to proceed?</i>

652
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:22,766
Cassian, what does one do when
there's no way out of a situation?

653
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,037
If there's no way out...

654
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,609
...the best thing is
to find a way further in.

655
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,296
- Fucking disgusting, you know that?
- What are you, my mother?

656
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,403
No, but I could be your old man
for all you know, asshole.

657
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:08,074
Hey, doc.

658
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:11,885
Gabriel Hansen?

659
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,183
I don't know.
My associate handled this.

660
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,823
Well, the address
is a post-office box...

661
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,222
...and he paid cash
for all of his medical bills.

662
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:28,296
There are no diagnostic photos.
Why?

663
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,069
- I don't know.
- Is there a number?

664
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:38,043
Yeah, 212-157-6421.

665
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,909
It's a dead line.

666
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:53,324
I'll put a call in to Hubby,
have her run it down.

667
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:56,327
See if we can't get a crack warrant
for the P.O. Box in Jersey.

668
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:04,429
What do all these GT's
next to the appointment entries mean?

669
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:07,702
We have a kickback account
with Go Taxi...

670
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,975
...and they indicate when we
use their service for a patient.

671
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,478
<i>Hey. Hubb says you caught a lead.</i>

672
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,619
Yeah, we've got an address.
We're en route.

673
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,412
<i>- What is it?
- Well, it could be him.</i>

674
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:20,850
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

675
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:23,890
<i>Well, they gotta bring him in now.
This is our last shot.</i>

676
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,651
What do you mean, "our last shot"?

677
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,729
<i>Arnie and I had it out last night,
and our clock's run out.</i>

678
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:32,996
<i>If we don't get this guy right now,
it's over.</i>

679
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,068
Well, it better be him, then.

680
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,350
I'm here. Yeah.

681
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:55,680
I know that.

682
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,689
This is definitely the right address?

683
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:01,887
Checked the log myself. This is where
they dropped him off every time.

684
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,123
Well, he could be anywhere.

685
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,733
- What do you think he was doing?
- Beats the shit out of me.

686
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,998
It's a big, empty lot.

687
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,075
Well, I'm starving. I'm gonna
get something. You want anything?

688
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:16,267
Yeah, a coffee, black.

689
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,845
I'm going back down to
headquarters after this.

690
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,879
Okay, all right.

691
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:29,491
Right, bye.

692
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,751
How long do you think
this has been like this?

693
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,792
I don't know, but we need to find out.

694
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,827
The doctor's records say
the last time...

695
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,899
...somebody got dropped off here
was five weeks ago.

696
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,369
I mean, there's not even
a temporary office or anything.

697
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,030
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

698
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:04,554
Son of a bitch.

699
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,056
What's the matter?

700
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,929
I just made our perp.
Eleven o'clock, blue overcoat.

701
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:19,166
- You sure that's him?
- A hundred percent.

702
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,673
- Where did he come from?
- Shit if I know.

703
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:24,608
I'm at the counter and
I see him rolling past the window.

704
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,179
- Wanna go for the collar?
- No.

705
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:29,010
We tail him, find out where he sleeps,
then take him down.

706
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:32,153
A, B, C. Keep the box tight.

707
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:54,966
<i>- Five-oh-two-six. Designator?
- Samuel Koppler.</i>

708
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,000
<i>Message:</i>

709
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,575
<i>Your uncle
wishes to see you immediately.</i>

710
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,176
<i>Response?</i>

711
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:08,112
The Guggenheim, fifth floor
of the rotunda, 40 minutes.

712
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:55,287
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hello.

713
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,728
N.Y.P.D. I need to
speak to your security chief.

714
01:08:57,934 --> 01:08:59,333
Okay, one moment.

715
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,994
Rick?

716
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,971
How you doing? Detective Ornelas.
I need to be able to clear security.

717
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,608
- Okay.
- Thanks.

718
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,476
We're clear.

719
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:48,314
Directly behind me.

720
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,956
There you go. Thank you.

721
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:51,005
Who's the old scag
sitting next to him?

722
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:54,410
I don't know, but I saw him at the
bank's headquarters in Luxembourg.

723
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:57,713
You don't look well today.

724
01:10:58,154 --> 01:11:00,622
We all begin better than we end.

725
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,756
What would you prefer your ending
to be like?

726
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:08,896
Oh, more purposeful,
and certainly more climactic.

727
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:10,990
A finale.

728
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,226
A finale.

729
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:16,963
Circumstances can always
be arranged.

730
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:19,838
As much as the thought
appeals to me...

731
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:23,705
...I'm afraid your consideration
is needed elsewhere.

732
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,105
- What is this?
- Salinger.

733
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:30,516
The method and manner
is entirely up to you.

734
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,918
Your principle would simply like him
to vanish without a trace.

735
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:41,493
- Any other provisions?
- Yes.

736
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:42,994
No mistakes.

737
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:48,132
I'll follow.

738
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:56,641
- Where's Iggy going?
- Following a new lead.

739
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:26,806
Shit.

740
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,374
We gotta go.

741
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:33,106
N.Y.P.D. Lock your hands
behind your head.

742
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:38,279
Do it now.

743
01:12:38,888 --> 01:12:40,617
They'll never let you bring me in.

744
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:42,882
Do it, or I'll take you down.

745
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,357
- Cuffs.
- On the belt.

746
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,238
There's a guy right up there.

747
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,062
- Where'd he...?
- Up there! Up there!

748
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:40,737
Get down!

749
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:49,421
- God! Oh, my God!
- It's okay.

750
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:53,183
Down there.

751
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:04,869
Shit.

752
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,116
Drop the gun.

753
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:31,160
- If I drop the gun, we'll both die.
- I said, drop the gun!

754
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:35,326
They're here for me but they'll kill
you too. Now help me get this off.

755
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,066
I can't breathe.

756
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,759
Stairs.

757
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,710
- Fuck.
- You okay?

758
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,315
The ramp is the only way out.

759
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,212
Hey.

760
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:42,448
Don't you fucking dare.

761
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:37,706
<i>I'm calling from the dark side.</i>

762
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:41,576
<i>- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- I'm calling from the...</i>

763
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,718
Get back.

764
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,804
I told you.

765
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,212
What? You told me what?

766
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,651
They'd never let you bring me in.

767
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:18,802
Fuck, fuck.

768
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,188
<i>Move away from the building.</i>

769
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:35,261
<i>Can everybody please
move away from the building?</i>

770
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,817
They know you're coming.
We gotta hurry.

771
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:59,351
- Where'd they find him?
- Sitting on a bench near the reservoir.

772
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:03,116
- Has he said anything yet?
- Nothing. He's pretty shaken up.

773
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:07,125
- Who else knows he's here?
- Everyone. Nothing I could do.

774
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,729
Heavies from the Bureau
and Justice are on their way.

775
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:11,626
<i>...with an unidentified third man.</i>

776
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,563
- How long do I have?
- Five, 10 minutes, max.

777
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:17,295
<i>...wanted for questioning
in an ongoing investigation.</i>

778
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:22,908
<i>Now, a Guggenheim employee tells me
that while they were in the museum...</i>

779
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,309
This isn't over.

780
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,028
Are you sure about this?

781
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:27,931
Just read it.

782
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,382
- They recognize you?
- Don't think so.

783
01:22:49,865 --> 01:22:51,833
Back it up!

784
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,468
<i>- ... screens came crashing down.
- How you doing?</i>

785
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:39,010
<i>- There was glass everywhere.
- As compared to what?</i>

786
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:41,045
<i>And just on the ground.</i>

787
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:43,979
<i>When you heard all of this
commotion, did you think...?</i>

788
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,153
Anything you need, Ellie,
just let me know.

789
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,379
<i>- Thanks.
- I just heard gunshots.</i>

790
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,717
<i>And people were hit
and screaming...</i>

791
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:53,156
<i>...and people just started running
out the door...</i>

792
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,090
<i>...and I didn't know
what was going on.</i>

793
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:56,286
You okay?

794
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,589
Yeah.

795
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:02,561
You flip this guy.

796
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,973
You make sure my partner
wasn't killed for nothing.

797
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:09,905
<i>I know that... I think random people
were going down and...</i>

798
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:14,639
<i>I mean, there was police running up
as other people were going down.</i>

799
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:28,686
You ready for this?

800
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:07,858
Good evening, Colonel Wexler.

801
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:12,299
I'm Agent Louis Salinger.

802
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,269
I know who you are.

803
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:19,238
Of course you do.

804
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:23,615
I was at the Guggenheim
this afternoon.

805
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:27,446
<i>The assassin you met with...</i>

806
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,217
<i>...I know you were his handler.</i>

807
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:34,589
I know you arranged for him
to be killed at the behest of the bank...

808
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,991
...because I was obviously
getting too close.

809
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:42,998
But if a hit team at the Guggenheim
is what happens...

810
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:46,002
...because I was
getting too close to him...

811
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:52,273
...what do you think the bank'll do
when it realizes how close I am to you?

812
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,042
Death comes for us all,
Agent Salinger.

813
01:25:57,786 --> 01:25:59,845
But based on everything
I've read about you...

814
01:26:00,055 --> 01:26:01,750
...you seem like the kind of man...

815
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:04,858
...who aspired to die
for something more than this.

816
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:11,155
Well, this is the difference
between truth and fiction.

817
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,764
Fiction has to make sense.

818
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:19,439
I'm confused, colonel.

819
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,805
Why would a tried
and true communist...

820
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:28,280
...a hardliner that spent 30 years
in the Stasi...

821
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,644
...fighting against the evils
of capitalism...

822
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:34,516
Why would this man waste his
final days working for an institution...

823
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:37,886
...that was the very embodiment
of everything he once despised?

824
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:43,796
You dedicated your life
to the communist ideal.

825
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:49,601
You sacrificed everything
for the good of the party.

826
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,470
For what?

827
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,839
You lost your wife to betrayal...

828
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,972
...your daughter to suicide...

829
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:06,582
...and when the Wall fell,
your whole life fell apart with it.

830
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,152
You know nothing about me.

831
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,591
I was lost long before the Wall fell.

832
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:18,527
I was once destined to become
a man much like yourself.

833
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:20,764
True-hearted...

834
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:23,070
...determined...

835
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,239
...full of purpose.

836
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,141
But...

837
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:31,340
...character is easier kept
than recovered.

838
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:36,448
We cannot control
the things life does to us.

839
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:41,054
They are done before you know it,
and once they are done...

840
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:44,618
...they make you do other things...

841
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:48,423
...until at last,
everything comes between you...

842
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:51,955
...and the man you wanted to be.

843
01:27:53,902 --> 01:27:55,369
No.

844
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,468
We all have choices in life.
You made yours.

845
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:09,679
Sometimes a man
can meet his destiny...

846
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:11,715
...on the road he took to avoid it.

847
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,686
Skarssen and that bank need to
answer for what they've done.

848
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:19,860
They have to be brought to justice.

849
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:21,995
You can help me do that.

850
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,127
Justice...

851
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,900
...is not possible.

852
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:29,036
Why not?

853
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:31,995
Because, Agent Salinger...

854
01:28:32,207 --> 01:28:36,143
...your idea of justice is an illusion.

855
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:39,436
<i>Understand the very system
that you serve and protect...</i>

856
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:43,174
<i>...will never allow anything to happen
to Skarssen or the bank.</i>

857
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:45,343
On the contrary.

858
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:49,814
The system guarantees
the IBBC's safety...

859
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:53,489
...because everyone is involved.

860
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:56,229
What do you mean, "everyone"?

861
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:00,500
Hezbollah.

862
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,969
CIA.

863
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,166
The Columbian drug cartels.

864
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,734
Russian organized crime.

865
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:11,378
Governments of Iran, Germany,
China, your government.

866
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:14,673
Every multinational corporation,
every one.

867
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:19,416
They all need banks like the IBBC...

868
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:24,490
...so that they can operate
within the black and gray latitudes.

869
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:26,918
And this is why
your investigative efforts...

870
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:30,689
...have either been ignored
or undermined...

871
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:34,027
...and why you and I
will be quietly disposed of...

872
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:40,064
...before any case against the bank
ever reaches a court of law.

873
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,239
<i>So, what are we all
supposed to do?</i>

874
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,850
We just supposed to give up...

875
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,919
...and accept that
this is the way of the world?

876
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,159
I'm not gonna do that.

877
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:07,762
I still believe... I know...

878
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:11,370
...that there has to be a way
to bring down this bank...

879
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:14,372
...and you are gonna help me.

880
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:23,677
You understand...

881
01:30:25,053 --> 01:30:28,784
...if you really want to
stop the IBBC...

882
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:34,689
...you won't be able to do it within the
boundaries of your system of justice.

883
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:37,696
You will have to go outside.

884
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:40,024
Once you do...

885
01:30:41,703 --> 01:30:45,195
...there will always be
collateral damage.

886
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,673
<i>Yes.</i>

887
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:57,150
<i>Should you sacrifice your own ideals
for the greater good?</i>

888
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:02,119
That's a difficult choice,
one I understand all too well...

889
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:05,287
...but as you so eloquently put it...

890
01:31:05,727 --> 01:31:09,060
...sometimes a man
can meet his destiny...

891
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:12,665
...on the road he took to avoid it.

892
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:25,671
What?

893
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,108
What are you doing?

894
01:31:27,749 --> 01:31:29,649
I think it's time for you to leave.

895
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:35,017
- Leave? What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

896
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:40,390
No way, Lou.

897
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:43,462
No fucking way.
You've already got him turned.

898
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:47,066
Now go back in there
and get him to come in on his own.

899
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:50,628
We can use everything.
We'll blow this whole thing wide open.

900
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:53,136
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

901
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,332
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

902
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:59,104
- I can protect him, Lou.
- No, you can't. They'll get to him.

903
01:31:59,314 --> 01:32:00,872
If they can't, they'll get to you.

904
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:03,482
If they can't get to you,
they'll get to your family.

905
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,358
I can't just walk away from this.

906
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:22,465
You're walking away
so I don't have to.

907
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:32,845
How can you trust him?

908
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:36,442
That relic in there
is looking for redemption.

909
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:38,676
I'm the only one
who can give it to him.

910
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:42,587
Then who gives it to you
when this is all over?

911
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:46,351
You need to cut me loose.

912
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:51,693
Tell them I escaped from custody,
whatever you have to.

913
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,890
Just use my history.
They'll believe you.

914
01:32:54,102 --> 01:32:56,366
- I don't know.
- Ella, listen to me.

915
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,604
Sometimes the hardest thing...

916
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:02,799
...is to know which bridge to cross
and which to burn.

917
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:09,410
I'm the one you burn.

918
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,069
We've been waiting here
for an hour.

919
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,079
I'm sorry, Martin, but none of us
have been able to reach them.

920
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:20,144
Unfortunately, Mario and Enzo Calvini
are not known for their punctuality.

921
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,185
They do realize this is the closing?

922
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:46,310
Mr. White...

923
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,972
...I've been instructed to escort you
and your associates from the building.

924
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:52,243
Please gather your materials
and come with me.

925
01:34:52,453 --> 01:34:55,980
- Instructed by whom?
- Please, if you could just comply.

926
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:20,840
Our father
never trusted these people.

927
01:35:22,483 --> 01:35:25,611
Thank you for telling us the truth.

928
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,054
Had you not come forward...

929
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:33,659
...we would have made
a terrible mistake today.

930
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:36,523
I'm just glad I could be of service.

931
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:46,533
I don't know, Jonas. I was told nothing.
I was simply thrown out.

932
01:35:47,008 --> 01:35:48,771
<i>They know.</i>

933
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:59,549
Look, I can't discuss this right now.
I'll call you when I'm in the air.

934
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:27,637
<i>Welcome to World News.
I'm Tristana Moore.</i>

935
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:31,249
<i>We're live today in the
Democratic Republic of Niberia.</i>

936
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:34,478
<i>As we go on air, we're getting reports
that thousands of troops...</i>

937
01:36:34,689 --> 01:36:38,318
<i>...loyal to General Charles Motomba's
Revolutionary Freedom Front...</i>

938
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:41,086
<i>...are moving towards
the capital of Denue.</i>

939
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:44,230
<i>According to eyewitnesses,
several explosions have been heard...</i>

940
01:36:44,432 --> 01:36:48,425
<i>...and there've been heavy outbreaks
of gunfire in many parts of the city.</i>

941
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,298
<i>The people of Niberia
have suffered greatly.</i>

942
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:54,941
<i>It is time to begin a new chapter
in our country's history.</i>

943
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:58,009
<i>We will not stop
until national liberation...</i>

944
01:36:58,212 --> 01:37:00,680
<i>...and the restoration of nationhood...</i>

945
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:06,510
News about Martin?

946
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:09,979
He didn't show up at his hotel
or at the airport.

947
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:14,753
The Italian police have been unable
to locate his car or driver.

948
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:18,625
I think Enzo and Mario Calvini
are sending us a message.

949
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:21,199
How could they possibly
have found out?

950
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:27,497
This is precisely
what we pay you to know.

951
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:29,198
We're out of time and options.

952
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:33,512
- We must make the deal with Sunay.
- How can we trust this man?

953
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:36,842
The Israeli government
is his biggest customer.

954
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:38,143
Why would he agree...

955
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:41,913
...to help us provide missiles
to the Iranians and the Syrians...

956
01:37:42,123 --> 01:37:44,853
...that have a first-strike capability
against the Israelis?

957
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:47,527
I know Sunay.
I believe he has every intention...

958
01:37:47,728 --> 01:37:49,559
...of selling you
the guidance systems...

959
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:52,158
...because he's already provided
the Israelis...

960
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:55,199
...with the countermeasures
to defeat them.

961
01:37:57,104 --> 01:37:59,902
Would the Turk really play
such a dangerous game?

962
01:38:01,409 --> 01:38:03,036
We are.

963
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:06,442
The only way we can make this work...

964
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:07,636
...is to guarantee...

965
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:10,578
...that Sunay keeps this information
in complete confidence.

966
01:38:10,785 --> 01:38:14,721
If our buyers find out the missiles are
worthless, they'll pull all their orders...

967
01:38:14,922 --> 01:38:17,254
...and this bank will be left insolvent.

968
01:38:17,758 --> 01:38:19,692
Have him here
by tomorrow afternoon.

969
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:23,125
Tomorrow he's going to
a funeral service for his cousin.

970
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:25,195
He'll be unavailable till Monday.

971
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:28,927
Unless of course,
you'd be willing to attend.

972
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,201
Make the call.

973
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:36,973
Get me Ahmet Sunay.

974
01:38:43,784 --> 01:38:45,752
It's tomorrow.

975
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:29,521
It's right there.
Do you want to be escorted?

976
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,163
We'll be fine, thank you.

977
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:38,571
The Sunay funeral, please.

978
01:39:38,773 --> 01:39:41,071
It will be over soon.
You may wait here.

979
01:39:41,275 --> 01:39:45,268
- Is there a bathroom I could use?
- Just over there.

980
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:48,414
- I won't be a moment.
- Right.

981
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:57,083
- The signal?
- Good.

982
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:58,656
<i>The Sunay funeral, please.</i>

983
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:02,820
- Where'd you put the spike?
- Inside the lapel of his jacket.

984
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:05,089
The lawyer?

985
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,858
White?

986
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:09,126
He's gone.

987
01:40:10,871 --> 01:40:14,739
I told you, there will always
be collateral damage...

988
01:40:14,942 --> 01:40:17,206
...when you take matters
into your own hands.

989
01:40:19,647 --> 01:40:20,671
Your plan is working.

990
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:23,845
It has left Skarssen
with only one option.

991
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:27,748
Record the conversation
and you'll gain your end.

992
01:40:29,924 --> 01:40:33,451
Sure they'll talk about Sunay's deal
with Israel and the countermeasures?

993
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:34,992
It is the key issue.

994
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:37,130
Once you let the Iranians
and Syrians...

995
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:41,893
...hear that the missiles are completely
useless against the Israelis...

996
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:48,239
...they will cancel their orders
and the IBBC will collapse.

997
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:59,010
- Wilhelm.
- Ahmet.

998
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,817
It's been a long time.

999
01:41:01,188 --> 01:41:02,177
<i>Yes.</i>

1000
01:41:02,389 --> 01:41:04,254
<i>My sympathies for the loss
of your cousin.</i>

1001
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:05,686
Thank you.

1002
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:08,487
Jonas Skarssen, Ahmet Sunay.

1003
01:41:08,696 --> 01:41:12,860
If you'd simply come to me in the
beginning, it would have been better.

1004
01:41:15,703 --> 01:41:17,500
<i>Midday prayers will begin soon.</i>

1005
01:41:17,705 --> 01:41:20,230
Should take a short time
to settle on the broad strokes.

1006
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:22,306
<i>The rest can be sorted out
at your leisure.</i>

1007
01:41:22,509 --> 01:41:23,498
<i>We have 10 minutes.</i>

1008
01:41:35,623 --> 01:41:38,956
Wilhelm, would you mind
if I spoke to Mr. Sunay alone?

1009
01:41:44,198 --> 01:41:47,827
I believe I understand
the particulars of your situation.

1010
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:50,868
<i>Perhaps we should discuss this
in a more private place.</i>

1011
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:52,732
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

1012
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,768
<i>Allow me to show you something
very special.</i>

1013
01:41:55,976 --> 01:41:59,742
<i>Something that very few outsiders
know exists.</i>

1014
01:42:01,248 --> 01:42:05,947
<i>It's my understanding that the product
you purchased are the XW-41 s.</i>

1015
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,444
After you.

1016
01:42:07,655 --> 01:42:09,987
<i>Yes. Forty-two hundred units.</i>

1017
01:42:12,259 --> 01:42:15,092
What kind of guidance
are they currently equipped...?

1018
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:23,326
<i>They all need to be upgraded
with VOLCON systems.</i>

1019
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:25,799
<i>Launch platforms?</i>

1020
01:42:26,006 --> 01:42:28,566
<i>Ground-based vehicles
and fixed-wing aircraft.</i>

1021
01:42:39,019 --> 01:42:41,579
So you understand
I have a terminal deadline.

1022
01:42:41,789 --> 01:42:43,586
First of February, yes.

1023
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:45,691
<i>- Can you meet it?
- To be sure.</i>

1024
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:49,488
<i>But you must arrange for the
end-user certificates, transport...</i>

1025
01:42:49,697 --> 01:42:51,221
<i>We'll arrange for it all.</i>

1026
01:42:51,432 --> 01:42:52,865
<i>Where would the work be done?</i>

1027
01:42:53,067 --> 01:42:55,934
<i>Cyprus. I've a facility there.</i>

1028
01:42:57,371 --> 01:43:00,932
<i>We would start retrofitting the worms
within a day of their arrival.</i>

1029
01:43:01,141 --> 01:43:04,201
<i>So if you deliver them to me
within the next two weeks...</i>

1030
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:06,345
<i>...we'll meet your deadline.</i>

1031
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:22,191
I'm concerned that we limit any and all
knowledge of your involvement.

1032
01:43:22,896 --> 01:43:26,297
<i>If we structure my involvement
through a thick veil of shells...</i>

1033
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:29,469
<i>...I don't foresee any complications.</i>

1034
01:43:30,904 --> 01:43:33,634
- Sorry?
- You. Come here now.

1035
01:43:33,841 --> 01:43:36,867
<i>Usually we would involve
our import partners from Russia.</i>

1036
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:38,744
What? I'm just a tourist.

1037
01:43:38,946 --> 01:43:41,540
- Now, you must leave.
- Could you get that light out of...?

1038
01:43:41,749 --> 01:43:44,377
Get your fucking...

1039
01:43:46,553 --> 01:43:50,045
So, shall we discuss numbers?

1040
01:43:50,491 --> 01:43:52,186
There is a more salient deal point...

1041
01:43:52,393 --> 01:43:55,191
...that needs to be resolved
before we can do that.

1042
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:57,193
<i>And what point is that?</i>

1043
01:43:58,198 --> 01:44:00,428
<i>The point of fidelity.</i>

1044
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:09,633
I know you provided
the Israeli government...

1045
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:12,778
...with the countermeasures
to this guidance system.

1046
01:44:20,888 --> 01:44:22,947
Last year alone...

1047
01:44:23,157 --> 01:44:26,718
...I did more than 300 million
in business with the Israelis.

1048
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:32,729
I would never put that at risk.

1049
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:37,131
How can I trust you not to divulge
this information to anyone else?

1050
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:40,630
It's mutual interest, not trust...

1051
01:44:41,075 --> 01:44:43,703
...that will be the bond
of our relationship.

1052
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:50,314
Your compensation will be held
in an escrow account.

1053
01:44:51,552 --> 01:44:53,747
<i>...released until our clients pay
in full.</i>

1054
01:44:54,455 --> 01:44:55,786
And those are the terms.

1055
01:44:58,559 --> 01:45:00,186
<i>The payout structure...</i>

1056
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:04,894
<i>The transfers will be begun
by tomorrow morning.</i>

1057
01:45:05,099 --> 01:45:08,591
<i>Ehames will contact you with
the number for the escrow account.</i>

1058
01:45:13,907 --> 01:45:16,899
So ends the bloody business
of the day.

1059
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:32,122
We're closed. I need you and Ehames
here tomorrow...

1060
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,886
...to work out all the details
with Sunay's people.

1061
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:38,025
Yes. We're on our way home.

1062
01:45:45,873 --> 01:45:46,862
Wilhelm?

1063
01:45:49,877 --> 01:45:51,276
Wake up.

1064
01:48:52,326 --> 01:48:53,315
Who are you?

1065
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:57,325
I'm Louis Salinger.

1066
01:49:07,307 --> 01:49:10,003
You don't have the authority
to arrest me.

1067
01:49:12,279 --> 01:49:14,975
Who said anything
about arresting you?

1068
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:23,050
- What do you want?
- I want some fucking justice.

1069
01:49:23,256 --> 01:49:26,953
Wait, wait. Wait.
Executing me won't change anything.

1070
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,651
There will be 100 other bankers
to take my place.

1071
01:49:29,863 --> 01:49:32,855
Everything will continue.

1072
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:39,005
The only thing you'll succeed in doing
is to satisfy your own blood lust.

1073
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:45,377
And you know it.

1074
01:50:40,033 --> 01:50:42,661
With compliments of Enzo
and Mario Calvini.

1075
01:50:57,818 --> 01:50:59,285
Thank you.
