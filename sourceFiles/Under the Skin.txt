27
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,332
I'm looking for the M8.

28
00:13:57,901 --> 00:14:00,169
Eh...

29
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:03,873
Aye, you've gotta go straight
along that way and...

30
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,976
This is gonna be pure hard to explain.

31
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:09,445
- Do you know where the Asda is?
- No.

32
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:12,615
Yeah, I don't even know what
way you're pointin'. What?

33
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:15,218
- See, if you just drive
straight along up there... - Yes?

34
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,920
And see the traffic lights up there?

35
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:19,488
Take a right.

36
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,290
Then you'll go past Ibrox Stadium, right?

37
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,159
And go straight through a roundabout.

38
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:27,897
Then take a left.
So it's right, then just...

39
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,498
And it's there.
The motorway is there.

40
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,100
It's back of Asda.
You'll see it.

41
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:33,236
- Back of Asda, see?
- Okay.

42
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,438
- Am I keeping you from something?
- No.

43
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,541
- Where are you going?
- Along here.

44
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,978
- For what? For work?
- No, I need to go meet somebody.

45
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,579
- Oh, you're going to meet someone.
- Aye.

46
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:44,881
All right.
Thank you. Sure.

47
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,214
I'm looking for a post office.

48
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,249
Post office?
Yes.

49
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,617
Where are you from?

50
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,052
Where I am from?
Yeah.

51
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,588
Albania.
Oh, are you?

52
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,156
You have family here?
Yes.

53
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:28,624
Oh, you do.

54
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:31,627
That's the reason I'm saying
you have to go another way...

55
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,930
for another...

56
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,932
It's after the shopping ce...

57
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,123
Hi.
Lost?

58
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,125
Yeah, lost.
What are you looking for?

59
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,528
I'm looking for the M8.
Up to the roundabout...

60
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,496
Are you walking?
Yep.

61
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,565
- Where are you walking to?
- Home.

62
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,568
Oh, you're going home. To your family?
No, no, just myself.

63
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,704
Just yourself?
Aye. It's great.

64
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:18,307
Yeah? How?
I can do whatever I like.

65
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,743
So where are you coming from?
Govan. Right there.

66
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,478
Sorry?
Govan.

67
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,614
Govan? Do you work there?
No, no.

68
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:28,117
Don't work there.
I work for myself.

69
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:31,487
Do you want a lift?
Eh... Aye, why not?

70
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:41,130
You'll have to tell me how to get there.

71
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,566
Just follow this road straight up.
Okay.

72
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,402
Sure.

73
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,671
So what do you do?
Electrician.

74
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,006
Oh, you're an electrician.

75
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:54,110
It's cold, right?

76
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:56,612
Ah, it's a wee bit nippy, aye.
Yeah.

77
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,082
So what is it youse all doing?

78
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,184
I'm...
I'm just, uh, driving...

79
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:06,589
just, uh... some furniture
for my family and...

80
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,191
Oh, right?
Yeah.

81
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:10,693
So you live alone?

82
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,461
Yes.
And you love it?

83
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:15,698
Aye. It's great.
What do you love about living alone?

84
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,601
- Nobody to nag you.
- Do I go straight through?

85
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,537
Yeah, just straight through.
Straight through the whole way.

86
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:58,340
It should be just cart around that
street and stay in the right hand lane.

87
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:00,609
What's that?
That's a tattoo of my name.

88
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:02,278
Of your name?
Yeah.

89
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,512
What's your name?
Andy.

90
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:05,147
Andy. Hi.
Pleased to meet you.

91
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:07,783
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you very much.

92
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,119
Andy!

93
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,320
- Want me?
- You coming?

94
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,762
The spot back here, you get... you put
your hand out. Anybody can stop.

95
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:22,565
There's lonely old guys.
Know what I mean?

96
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:26,168
It was... Hey, might as well check
her out, driving away in a big van.

97
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,205
- Sure you can drive this, huh?
Huh? -

98
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:35,811
- No girlfriend? Really?
- Nah, I don't have a girlfriend at all.

99
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:38,247
You're very charming.

100
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:43,786
That's better.

101
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,389
Yeah? Sorted?

102
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:50,626
You have a handsome face.
Aye?

103
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:53,429
Yeah.
Thanks a lot. Cheers.

104
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,865
- Do you think I'm pretty?
- I think you're gorgeous.

105
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,833
- Do you?
- Aye, definitely.

106
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:00,202
Good.

107
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,874
And a friendly smile as well.

108
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,176
- Do I?
- Aye, right deep.

109
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,311
- What about your smile?
- Aye.

110
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:10,813
You've a nice smile yourself.

111
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:13,215
- Cheers.
- Good.

112
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:14,650
Good.

113
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:56,545
No, no, no, lads! No!

114
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:55,371
Mommy!
Whoo!

115
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:56,465
I thought...

116
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,100
you had your eye on my towel.

117
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:00,502
No. I wanted
to speak to you.

118
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:02,604
Do you know if there's any good
spots to surf around here?

119
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,674
I'm not a surfer.

120
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:07,609
Just living in a little tent over there.

121
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:10,512
Just hanging around.
Yeah?

122
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:13,549
Reading, swimming. You're not from here?
Where are you from?

123
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:18,187
I'm from Czech Republic.
Why are you in Scotland?

124
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,991
I just... wanted to
get away from it all.

125
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:25,227
Yeah?
Why here?

126
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:27,229
Because it's...

127
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:28,597
It's nowhere.

128
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:03,278
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.

129
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,613
Can I talk to you before
you run away, darling?

130
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:08,183
I wanted to speak to you earlier,
right, but you disappeared.

131
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:11,086
I thought you went to the
ladies' or somethin'.

132
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:14,556
Anyway, right, fuck all that shite.
Right?

133
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,359
I really want to buy you a drink, man.
You look absolutely stunning.

134
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:19,160
And I...

135
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:22,364
You know what? I'm all alone.
You're all alone.

136
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,566
What do you say?
What's one drink?

137
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:26,334
What's one drink?

138
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:29,104
I saw you on the road.
What, you saw <i>me on the road?</i>

139
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:31,740
Earlier, yeah.
Are you having a laugh with me?

140
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:34,242
You saw me? You wanna come
get a drink and a dance?

141
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:37,045
Are you alone here?
Yeah, I'm all alone. Right?

142
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:07,775
The man from the car, he
buy the rose for you.

143
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,401
A man's body has
been found washed up on a beach...

144
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:07,535
near Arbroath.

145
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:10,104
His wife and child are reported missing.

146
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:12,540
The police say the body
has been identified...

147
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:15,576
as 36-year-old Kenneth
McClelland from Edinburgh.

148
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:17,779
The body was found by a tourist...

149
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:20,882
and is believed to have been
in the water for some time.

150
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:25,686
Mr. McClelland was married and worked as a
chemistry lecturer at Edinburgh University.

151
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:29,457
The alarm was raised when he failed
to turn up for work this morning.

152
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:32,960
His car was found at
the nearby Deer Park Golf Club.

153
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:36,531
His wife, 32-year-old Alison
McClelland, and 18-month-old son...

154
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:38,733
are believed to have been with him.

155
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:41,869
A police and coast guard search
operation involving a helicopter...

156
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:44,038
has been halted due to fog.

157
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,873
The next bulletin is on the hour.

158
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,645
Well, plenty to talk
about, as ever, with Kay.

159
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:53,481
You can call now...
10-500-92-95-00.

160
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:55,483
You can text as well...
80295.

161
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:57,652
- It's 8:17.
- Good morning, Gary.

162
00:40:57,654 --> 00:41:00,521
Well, as we've heard, for a whole host of reasons...

163
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:02,857
2014 is a very important year for Scotland.

164
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:05,159
Of course, the referendum.
We're expecting that date today.

165
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:08,229
But the Commonwealth Games
and Ryder Cup...

166
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,598
You seem very excited about that.
I am.

167
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,501
He's jumping out of his seat at the
prospect of the year he's gonna have...

168
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,708
Fuckin' hell, you're gorgeous.

169
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:58,045
- You think so?
- It's your eyes.

170
00:41:59,248 --> 00:42:01,649
Somethin' about your eyes.

171
00:42:02,684 --> 00:42:05,186
Your eyes, your lips.

172
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:07,255
That black hair.
Yeah?

173
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,193
You just look...

174
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:15,129
amazing.

175
00:45:25,787 --> 00:45:27,421
Hey, you okay?

176
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:38,766
Want a hand up?
Want a hand?

177
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:26,193
Get out, eh? Get out!

178
00:51:07,595 --> 00:51:09,063
Excuse me.

179
00:51:10,432 --> 00:51:12,066
Excuse me.

180
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:15,069
Uh, I'm a bit lost, really.

181
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,137
Am I headed towards Taynuilt?

182
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:19,339
Yeah.

183
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:22,276
I am? Is it far?

184
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:24,445
It's about 10 minutes away.

185
00:51:24,447 --> 00:51:26,613
Ten minutes? Are you...
Are you headed there?

186
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,349
I'm going to the supermarket.

187
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:31,251
Is it on the way?

188
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:36,356
Yeah.

189
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:38,425
I could drop you off if you'd like.

190
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:46,200
Yeah?

191
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,664
Here. Let me
turn this up for you.

192
00:52:26,374 --> 00:52:28,242
That's better.

193
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,192
You're very quiet.

194
00:52:51,232 --> 00:52:53,467
So why do you shop at night then?

195
00:52:57,672 --> 00:52:59,406
People wind me up.

196
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:02,809
How?

197
00:53:05,213 --> 00:53:06,914
They're ignorant.

198
00:53:10,618 --> 00:53:12,886
What about your friends?

199
00:53:16,257 --> 00:53:18,292
So you don't have any friends?

200
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:24,665
No.

201
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:27,401
How about a girlfriend?

202
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:35,342
How old are you?

203
00:53:36,911 --> 00:53:38,478
I'm 26.

204
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:43,250
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

205
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,888
Never had one.

206
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:49,623
So don't you get lonely then?

207
00:53:56,998 --> 00:53:58,732
You've very nice hands.

208
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:05,772
You've beautiful hands.

209
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:30,297
Do you want to look at me?

210
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:32,566
This isn't Tesco's, is it?
No.

211
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,308
I noticed you looking at me before.

212
00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:48,348
And?

213
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,818
I liked it.

214
00:54:56,524 --> 00:54:58,759
You're uncomfortable.

215
00:54:58,761 --> 00:55:01,461
No. Just want
to go to Tesco's.

216
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:10,337
So you never think about it then?

217
00:55:12,907 --> 00:55:14,541
Think about what?

218
00:55:15,843 --> 00:55:17,978
Being with a girl.

219
00:55:24,352 --> 00:55:26,019
When was the last time you touched someone?

220
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,801
Let me see your hands.

221
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:49,376
Cold.

222
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,348
I have to get back soon.

223
00:56:05,593 --> 00:56:07,461
How was that?

224
00:56:08,463 --> 00:56:09,663
Cold.

225
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:15,535
Do you want to do it again?

226
00:56:15,537 --> 00:56:17,537
Yeah.

227
00:56:25,446 --> 00:56:27,681
Do you want to touch my neck?

228
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:29,416
Here.

229
00:56:37,759 --> 00:56:39,960
How was that?

230
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:43,497
Yeah.

231
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:47,000
Your hands are very soft.

232
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:57,544
I have a place about 30 minutes away.

233
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,081
Will you come with me there?

234
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:01,875
Cold.

235
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:04,077
I won't let that stop us.

236
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:25,532
Come to me.

237
00:58:40,915 --> 00:58:42,749
Dreaming?

238
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:44,150
Yes.

239
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:45,886
Dreaming?

240
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:47,621
Yes, we are.

241
01:09:46,947 --> 01:09:49,815
The bus will be along in a minute.

242
01:10:45,772 --> 01:10:48,191
Do you not think you should be
wearing a jacket, little lass?

243
01:10:48,192 --> 01:10:50,610
The weather's terrible up here.

244
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:54,480
You'll catch your death of cold if you've
not got a jacket or a hat or something on.

245
01:10:57,818 --> 01:11:00,386
You've not got the right clothes on at all.

246
01:11:07,894 --> 01:11:09,695
You all right there?

247
01:11:11,965 --> 01:11:13,599
Eh?

248
01:11:14,668 --> 01:11:16,402
You okay?

249
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,276
Can I do something for you?

250
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:25,978
Chase yourself, dafty.

251
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,981
Leave the lassie alone.
She doesn't want anything to do with you.

252
01:11:37,691 --> 01:11:39,692
Do you need any help?

253
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,037
Yes.

254
01:11:58,612 --> 01:12:00,379
Right.

255
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:55,528
Let me just take your coat.

256
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,156
<i>Spoon, Jar.
Jar, spoon.</i>

257
01:14:26,726 --> 01:14:29,128

that's working, don't you?</i>

258
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:30,696

259
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:32,565
Spoon, Jar.
Jar, spoon.

260
01:14:32,567 --> 01:14:34,500
Spoon, Jar. Spoon, Jar.
Jar, spoon.

261
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:42,208
Stop!

262
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,047
Stop!

263
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,649

You all right?

282
01:20:42,602 --> 01:20:45,137
If you're frightened, let's go.

283
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:53,011
Come on.

284
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,281
It's all right.

285
01:20:57,517 --> 01:20:59,251
That's it.

286
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:38,924
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:21:51,271 --> 01:21:53,205

It's okay.

289
01:22:01,514 --> 01:22:03,415
All right.

290
01:22:06,686 --> 01:22:08,587
Okay.

291
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:12,257
You did it.

292
01:26:25,378 --> 01:26:26,578
You all right?

293
01:28:33,572 --> 01:28:36,741
You just off for a ramble
in the woods then? Eh?

294
01:28:36,743 --> 01:28:39,778
Huh? You just off for a ramble
in the woods? Yeah, yeah?

295
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:43,014
Oh, it's, uh... Watch how you step here.
It's a bit, uh...

296
01:28:43,016 --> 01:28:46,451
It's a bit slippery round here,
but... this time of year.

297
01:28:46,453 --> 01:28:50,622
It's all right in summer. Well, it's still
wet in summer, but not as bad as it is now.

298
01:28:50,624 --> 01:28:52,924
But there's plenty of trails around here.

299
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:54,859
Have you been here before?

300
01:28:54,861 --> 01:28:56,594
No? First time? Yeah?

301
01:28:56,596 --> 01:28:58,963
Oh, you won't get lost.
They're all clearly marked.

302
01:28:58,965 --> 01:29:02,434
But, uh, there's about
2,000 acres of forest here,

303
01:29:02,436 --> 01:29:06,371
so you shouldn't... you should have,
uh, plenty of places to go in there.

304
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:08,106
You on your own?
Yeah.

305
01:29:08,108 --> 01:29:12,877
Yeah, on your own? Oh, well, it's a
nice place if you want some solitude,

306
01:29:12,879 --> 01:29:16,715
you know, to "gather your
thoughts" and all that, yeah?

307
01:29:16,717 --> 01:29:19,417
So, uh, enjoy yourself anyway, okay?
Thank you.
