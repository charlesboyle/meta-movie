1
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,370
<i>When you're an animal,
life's a balancing act.</i>

2
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,965
<i>Each day is a quest to
find food to survive.</i>

3
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,125
<i>It's a tough nut to crack.</i>

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,359
<i>Wait, you think I'm one
of these dopey pigeons?</i>

5
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,799
<i>No, no, no, no, this is me.
The handsome one.</i>

6
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,599
<i>I got no problem with
my feathered friends.</i>

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
<i>In fact, I get a real
kick outta them.</i>

8
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,049
<i>They're really soft on the feet.</i>

9
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,119
<i>And they're always building
these little picnic baskets</i>

10
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,731
<i>that offer the occasional treat.</i>

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,720
<i>Apparently, not today.</i>

12
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,127
<i>Thanks for nothing.</i>

13
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,011
<i>At the end of the day, I'm
just like all you fine people.</i>

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,280
<i>I'm no hero.</i>

15
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,651
<i>I'm just a squirrel
trying to get a nut.</i>

16
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,044
One bag of nuts, please.

17
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,924
<i>And that's my buddy named,
well, Buddy.</i>

18
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,079
<i>He don't talk much.</i>

19
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,079
<i>Yeah, they say the world's
there for the taking.</i>

20
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,566
<i>So, that's just
what we're gonna do.</i>

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,131
Come along. Please keep
that food coming, everyone.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,444
That's it. All finds are valuable.

23
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,079
Mole, what is our food level now?

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,123
Pickings are slim this year.

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,929
I'm sure we could rephrase.

26
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,039
We're at starvation levels!

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,969
We're all gonna die!

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,799
Now, now, now,
have optimism, brethren.

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,445
Stiff upper lip, everyone.

30
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,039
Ah! Here we are, food.

31
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,809
I'm afraid this is the
wrong kind of nut. Hmm...

32
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,639
Shiny.

33
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,366
What's that? A nut cart?

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,559
A nut cart?

35
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,683
A nut cart? My eyes!

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,849
This could be our
salvation for winter.

37
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,319
Andie!

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,199
I'm on my way.
You won't regret this.

39
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,846
Uh-uh-uh.
Grayson is going with you.

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,639
With all due respect, sir, I can
do this on my own. I don't...

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,887
Grayson!

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,359
<i>Ole!</i>

43
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,679
Chicks dig the tail.

44
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,799
Help Andie retrieve as many
nuts from that cart as possible.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,999
For the park!

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,199
For the park!

47
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,479
Oh! What she said.

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,130
And above all, keep a wary
watchful eye out for you-know-who.

49
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,250
No! Not him!

50
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,329
Yes, him.

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,405
Ho, ho, ho, come to daddy.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,446
Hey, mack, you know where
the Oakton Bank is?

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,361
Oh, thanks.

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,159
Where'd you learn to drive?

55
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,361
Moron!

56
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,606
Hey, mister!

57
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,881
I want some nuts.

58
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,765
Scram, kid, we're closed.

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,408
The sign says you're open!

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,647
Burn rubber.

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,919
Did you hear me? I want nuts!

62
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,929
- You want nuts?
- Nuts!

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,162
We got to get those nuts before the
rest of the park gets in on this.

64
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,639
Let's go over the plan.

65
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,799
That's us, there's the cart,

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,243
we rob the cart and then stuff
ourselves silly all winter.

67
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,851
What are you looking at?

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,761
Great. We got company.

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,366
Okay, we got to move.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,126
Get in the pail.

71
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,731
Officer, that man,
he assaulted me with nuts.

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,799
- Oh, no.
- It was horrible.

73
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,599
Now, listen,
Officer, that is not...

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,848
I need to see your vendor permits.

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,841
There it is.

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,485
Enough food to feed the park
for the entire winter.

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,479
That dog will make
it difficult, though.

78
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,279
Grayson? Grayson?

79
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,482
- Quiet.
- What are you doing?

80
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,328
I'm smelling for any sign of
that rascal, Surly Squirrel.

81
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,243
Picking up rather
strange scents, though.

82
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,002
Cashews, man musk, dog hair.

83
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,201
I knew it. You stay here.

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,963
Honestly, woman, I am still
the park hero around here!

85
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,728
Which reminds me, why haven't
you asked me out on a date?

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,961
Oh.

87
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,326
I smell a rat.

88
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,359
What are you doing here, Surly?

89
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,999
Do you like cashews?
You want some cashews?

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,199
Who needs a permit
when you got nuts?

91
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,479
Great. So, you're
after this nut cart, too, huh?

92
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,519
Of course I am. The park needs it.

93
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,039
Well, too late, sister. Amscray.

94
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,999
Buddy and I got here first,
and I ain't sharing.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,119
Oh, yes, you are.

96
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,324
Fall's half over and the park's
having the worst shortage in years.

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,921
That nut cart can feed everyone.

98
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,283
Hey, we'll work together.
We can work out a deal.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,879
Uh, pass me that
metal thingy, will you?

100
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,399
I just... I don't get it.

101
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,199
You have all the drive and ability

102
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,039
to help the park,
but you never do.

103
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,449
You know, this is a chance to
prove Raccoon is wrong about you.

104
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,479
I don't care what Raccoon thinks.

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,359
Well, then do it for the park. Stop
thinking about yourself all the time.

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,359
Look, I'm independent

107
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,039
and that means
looking out for number one.

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,686
I suggest you do the same
if you want to survive.

109
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,361
Got that?

110
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,008
I feel sorry for you, Surly.

111
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,719
A-ha!

112
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,288
Found him, Andie!
In a tree, no less.

113
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,479
Very crafty, Surly.

114
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,039
I shall now arrest you
before you interfere

115
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,639
with the park's nut cart caper.

116
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,683
It's okay, Grayson. I got him.

117
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,042
No, Grayson, she doesn't.
You better help her.

118
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,719
Well, you! I'm gonna...

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,319
Hey, Sugar Ray,
take the gloves off.

120
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,799
I'm just gonna rip your tail off.

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,809
Now, how about that date?

122
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,679
Listen, I'd love to keep chatting,
but I got a date with destiny.

123
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,370
Destiny, do I know her?

124
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,087
<i>Buena suerte</i>, chumps!

125
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,449
That was thrilling!

126
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,359
That was painful.

127
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,410
This is going to end up bad.

128
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,319
Excuse me, Officer.

129
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,759
I happen to have
seen the whole thing.

130
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,759
This little girl might be
exaggerating a little bit...

131
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,961
I am not!

132
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,359
Did you see that?
You're my witness.

133
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,919
Did you see that, Officer?

134
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,805
Yeah. Yeah, she
assaulted me, Officer!

135
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,130
I'm just an innocent citizen.
Aren't I right?

136
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,719
Aww, great.

137
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,686
Bon appétit.

138
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,922
Hey, your cart, it's getting away.

139
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,799
Holy Toledo!

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,919
Amscray.

141
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,041
Uh-oh.

142
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,841
Nuts!

143
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,520
What a woman!

144
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,450
That just cost you 10%.

145
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,844
<i>Ole!</i> Did I save the day?

146
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,679
Grayson, try to get as much
food for the stock as you can.

147
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,799
Hey, what's that smell?

148
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,439
That's my cologne, made from
tree sap and falcon tears.

149
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,761
- Get back.
- Hey, watch the tail.

150
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,730
Flammable here, come on.

151
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,491
These nuts are ours!

152
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,081
Huh?

153
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,159
These nuts are mine!

154
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,967
Okay, Surly, let's negotiate.
We can share it with the park.

155
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,564
Yeah, that sounds fair. How
about 100 me, zero for you?

156
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,251
Wow!

157
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,411
They definitely don't
have a permit for that.

158
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,481
No!

159
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,285
We have to stop this cart.

160
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,281
Photo op!

161
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,649
Surly, come help me, man!

162
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,441
What? Curse you, Surly!

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,802
Surly, you coward!

164
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,726
Heck of a day.

165
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,601
Grayson, the oak tree.

166
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,646
The tally is in.

167
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,162
The food collected
in the trunk of our oak tree

168
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,559
will not be enough
to carry us through winter.

169
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,559
I knew it! We're gonna die!

170
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,519
- Settle down, settle down now, please.
- Raccoon!

171
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,399
Raccoon is giving a speech.

172
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,279
Though this outlook
appears disheartening...

173
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,839
Excuse me,
Andie and Grayson are on...

174
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,119
with determination and honor...

175
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,560
You gotta listen to me.

176
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,799
this park will persevere!

177
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,879
Take heart, park brethren,
there is hope!

178
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,719
- Raccoon!
- Quiet.

179
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,119
I'd like to take this
moment to point out...

180
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,845
Quiet. Quiet.

181
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,199
Grayson's never
let us down before.

182
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,719
I believe he is on his way right
at this very moment carrying...

183
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,763
Flaming cart of nuts!

184
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,846
What?

185
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,289
Our food! it will be destroyed!

186
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,931
Why didn't you say anything?

187
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,682
Abandon tree! Abandon tree!

188
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Not my perfectly
symmetrical face! No!

189
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,366
Phew!

190
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,210
My goodness!

191
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,288
Grayson? Grayson?

192
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,406
Where are you?

193
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,485
What happened here?

194
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,759
Who is responsible for this?

195
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,719
Let go of me, you clowns!

196
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,119
You're making a big mistake here.

197
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,399
I got an alibi! I got witnesses.

198
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,088
Found him hiding in one of our
holes, just like a snake.

199
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,451
I was recovering buried nuts,
that's what I was doing.

200
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,799
You guys smell, like, burnt
nuts or something? That me?

201
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,525
What's going... Ahh!

202
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,321
Look at that!

203
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,039
You guys are
messed for winter, man!

204
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,039
I mean, wow!
Just look at that bonfire!

205
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,639
You didn't see
that coming, did you?

206
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,731
Never fear!
This sweet bod is undamaged!

207
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,599
Raccoon, let me organize the trial.
Just give the order.

208
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,239
Another trial? He's never learned.

209
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,279
He needs something more severe!

210
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,847
He is a clear and present danger!

211
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,919
You...

212
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,399
No, no, we do things
by the rule of law.

213
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,170
Let justice take care of him.

214
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,640
They want justice, Andie,
and justice they will receive.

215
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,287
All those in favor of
banishment, raise your paws!

216
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,170
- Banishment?
- Banishment?

217
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,647
Bandages? Yes, please.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,439
Why are you hesitating?

219
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,849
He's refused to join us,
ridiculed our hard work,

220
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,839
stolen, cheated, lied,

221
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,045
and now destroyed our
only food for winter.

222
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,891
What say all?

223
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,279
And stick 'em up!

224
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,801
Why is the ground
moving towards my face?

225
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,329
We don't convict without a trial.
This isn't how we do things.

226
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,041
Uh...

227
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,002
I have run out of options
for that squirrel, Andie.

228
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,322
Do what you will,
do what is right.

229
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,999
Oh!

230
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,285
Buddy has not voted, and it has
to be unanimous, that's the rule.

231
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,762
You won't vote against me,
will you, old buddy?

232
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,201
Buddy?

233
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,726
You were saying?

234
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,639
By the authority granted by
Raccoon and the park community...

235
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,039
Oh! This is too high...

236
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,564
Surly Squirrel is
hereby banished to the city,

237
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,202
never to return to our
beloved Liberty Park.

238
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,044
Ugh! Can I please get down now?

239
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,726
You should have
had a trial, Surly.

240
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,445
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,288
This is my punishment, Buddy.

242
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,479
Huh.

243
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,364
This ain't so bad.

244
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,081
Ahh!

245
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,801
Oh! Filthy rat!

246
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,842
- Hey! Whoa! Is that a rat?
- Oh, my!

247
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,882
Shoes. Shoes.

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,359
Gotta tail.

249
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,681
Hey!

250
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,879
No, no, no, Buddy, Buddy, Buddy,
speak to me, pal, come on.

251
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,639
Come on, snap out of it,
come on, speak to me, pal,

252
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,280
come on, come on,
come on, snap out of it.

253
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,559
Boy, it feels good to have a...

254
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,081
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your hands off me.

255
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,887
Beat it back to that park.

256
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,519
It's dangerous out here.

257
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,722
Besides,
you'll just get in my way.

258
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,565
I don't need anybody.

259
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,566
You guys looking for
that squirrel? Me, too.

260
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,890
Oops.

261
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,039
Hey, fellas,
come on, come on, come on.

262
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,971
I'm cool with rats.
My best friend's a rat.

263
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,607
There he is!

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,488
Go on, be free. Be free.
Come on, come on, come on.

265
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,528
Buddy, Buddy, come on! Here we go.

266
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,362
We did it. We're away.

267
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,526
Ha!

268
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,801
Whoa!

269
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,405
Let's go tell the boss.

270
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,648
I can't do this anymore.

271
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,124
No food, no home. Rat gangs.

272
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,199
I'm gonna die out here, Buddy.

273
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,479
I don't know, I mean, maybe
they could take me back.

274
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,479
I'd do public service. I'll
read to that blind woodchuck.

275
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,651
I'll even listen to Raccoon. I'll do
anything. I'll do whatever it takes to...

276
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,406
Okay. We get in.
We fill our bellies.

277
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,163
But we do it my way.

278
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,448
Forget it, Buddy. That's not gonna work.
Let me handle this.

279
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,526
We got 100.

280
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,119
20%. Twenty of 100,
that's what 20% is.

281
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,079
- You didn't go to school?
- Hey, hey!

282
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,119
Hey, hey!

283
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,606
Look who's here! It's the boss!

284
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,447
Fresh out of the slammer, huh?
How you doing, jailbird?

285
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,719
Hey, what's it been?
Eight years? Seven years?

286
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,126
Here. Let me get your jacket.

287
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,922
No, no, no. I shall get that.

288
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,719
It's fine. I got it.

289
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,921
No, I got it.

290
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,691
I said it's all right.

291
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,799
Just good to see you.

292
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,049
Hey, Precious! Come here.
Say hi to the boss.

293
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,199
Say, boss, you look even better
than you did when you went in.

294
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,482
Hey, boss, you got a new suit?

295
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,319
What is that?
Is that linen? Is that silk?

296
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,199
'Cause you look good.
Tell me it ain't Italian.

297
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,526
What a sharp dude.

298
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,480
Yeah. Hey...

299
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,689
I want youse to meet our
new associate, Knuckles.

300
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,327
He'll be the weapons
and the safe expert.

301
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,690
Knuckles, say hello
to Fingers and Lucky.

302
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,559
Hiya, mack. Welcome aboard.

303
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,205
What's buzzin', cousin?

304
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,599
All right.

305
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,770
So, which of you
geniuses found this place?

306
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,039
I did.

307
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,119
Ah, here we go.

308
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,201
I did. And look at all this nutty
stuff, boss. We even got a nut cart.

309
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,561
- Uh-huh.
- Sorta.

310
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,359
It'll do.

311
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,042
We bought it for a song. And the
place is the perfect cover.

312
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,282
And the view is swell. All
right, let's get to it. Plans.

313
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,839
Just like we talked about.
Fat city.

314
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,041
Here's the bank.

315
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,164
Vault's right here.
Reinforced steel.

316
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,766
Solid as a rock.

317
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,284
That's why we got these babies.

318
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,039
We go in with a bang,
and go out with the loot!

319
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,287
Here.

320
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,319
Kill the lights! Kill 'em!

321
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,204
Ah, just probably rats.

322
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,604
Did you say rats?

323
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,082
What's his problem?

324
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,920
Shut her up, Fingers!

325
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,011
I got this.

326
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,839
Wow. You can hear my dog whistle?

327
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,079
Can you hear this?

328
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,250
Like, if I talk, like, high?
Like this?

329
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,759
You kiddin' me? Really?

330
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,159
I'm not asking you
if you can hear, I'm ask...

331
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,719
Knock it off!

332
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,083
I got enough on my plate without
you two horsin' around, you dig?

333
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,639
Uh... Uh...

334
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,684
Hey, boss, let's show you
fellas the basement, huh?

335
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,079
We barely have enough food
for the next three days,

336
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,679
let alone for the winter.

337
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,719
Make that food last.
It's all we can spare.

338
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,119
Come on, Grayson. Five more.

339
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,210
Let's go! Drop the purse, honey!
It's time to dance!

340
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,091
Okay! Yeah! Rope-a-dope!

341
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,879
All right!
Let's try cheek elasticity.

342
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,879
Yeah! Show 'em
what you got, Grayson!

343
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,048
Come on, Grayson.
Stretch those cheeks.

344
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,719
Do you really think Grayson
should be coming with me?

345
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,919
I don't think he's recovered
from that hit on the head.

346
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,959
Raccoon thinks it would be good for
morale during these hard times.

347
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,447
After all,
Grayson is the park hero.

348
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,841
What a champ!

349
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,039
Good luck, my dear.
Find food for us.

350
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,846
For the park.
Our hopes go with you.

351
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,879
<i>Ole!</i>

352
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,239
We know you'll find food.

353
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,487
Take me with you!

354
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,399
And you should have great weather!

355
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,079
80% chance of sunshine!

356
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,079
0% chance of winter!

357
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,441
Take me with you!

358
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,725
Be careful! The city is full of
germs and bright blinding lights.

359
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,326
Oh, the sun's coming up.

360
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,999
I must take refuge in the safety
of darkness. Out of my way!

361
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,201
Bye!

362
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,766
Look at us! Off on a heroic quest!

363
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,839
I couldn't think of a better way
to celebrate our anniversary.

364
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,639
Hey! We are not dating.

365
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,079
This is an important mission
to find food. Right?

366
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,039
You're right. We're
past those silly labels.

367
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,239
Ours is a love...

368
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,965
Well, Well, Well.

369
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,121
Isn't this a tender little scene?

370
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,681
I'll handle this.

371
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,082
Hello, urban rodent thing!

372
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,639
Is that mange or bubonic
plague you're wearing?

373
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,686
Anyway, my lady and I were hoping
you could point out the...

374
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,799
Hey! Put the...

375
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,121
Hey! Give her back that backpack!

376
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,164
Backpack! Give it pack!

377
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,011
Pack! Back!

378
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,441
Hey!

379
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,641
Grayson!

380
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,201
<i>Ole!</i>

381
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,481
A-ha!

382
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,971
Go on without me!

383
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,761
Save the park!

384
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,125
Buddy, I ate too much cheese.

385
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,319
I think I'm gonna
have a cheese baby.

386
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,806
Going down.

387
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,651
Son of a gun.

388
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,006
Lana...

389
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,846
Gee, Lana, you look swell.

390
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,239
Lana, crazy dame.

391
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,125
Hey, ain't you got
a nickel to call first?

392
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,846
No need. Your ma told me
where to find you, King.

393
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,599
Look at that! It's Lana!

394
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,850
And who are you,
you slobbery little monster?

395
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,286
She's a vicious guard dog.

396
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,522
She's not very good at her job.

397
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,719
She's not the only one.

398
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,319
What's that supposed to mean?

399
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,239
- Nothin'.
- What do you mean, nothing?

400
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,399
I said nothin'.

401
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,604
I wouldn't have believed it, but
you really have gone legit.

402
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,520
Talk about second chances,
it's boss.

403
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,919
Yeah, well, you keep it
under your hat, though,

404
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,559
'cause, I mean, we ain't open yet,

405
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,439
and we wanna have a surprise
grand opening. Right, boys?

406
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,091
Oh! Not again!

407
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,449
Hey! My Whistle!

408
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,527
I wanna be reimbursed for that!

409
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,570
- Ahh! Oh! Rat!
- Boss!

410
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,405
- It's a rat!
- Hang on!

411
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,039
Get it off of me!

412
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,641
Get this rat off of me!
It's down my pants!

413
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,568
Get it out of here!
Get it off of me! Please!

414
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,284
Next chance we get, we go back in
there and stash away those nuts.

415
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,479
Can't go back to the park, though.

416
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,923
Ah, forget it. Let's go get
that shiny thing. Here we go!

417
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,250
No. And that's not...

418
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,879
The thingamabooby is mine!

419
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,647
Surly!

420
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,159
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

421
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,319
- I'm looking for food.
- I'm looking for food.

422
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,519
- No! I'm looking for food!
- No! I'm looking for food!

423
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,839
Hey, did you find food?

424
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,879
No. No food.
Can I have that back, please?

425
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,519
Why? What is this thing?

426
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,567
It's just my musical instrument
for playing the blues.

427
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,039
<i>I got no friends, no food</i>

428
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,639
<i>This whistle has nothing
to do with food</i>

429
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,890
<i>Oh, I've got the no food blues</i>

430
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,251
For heaven's sakes!
You found food, didn't you?

431
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,399
And this thing has
something to do with it.

432
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,681
That's crazy!

433
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,279
Spill the beans, or I...

434
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,481
Whoa!

435
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,080
Let's not get too nutty around here.
Pardon the expression.

436
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,759
Surly, I'm having a heck of a day!

437
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,079
The park lost all its food,
Grayson lost his mind,

438
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,559
now I've lost Grayson.

439
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,079
I've been out hungry and alone
and getting real irritable!

440
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,799
So, either you start talking,
or come winter,

441
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,721
I'll be wearing a new
squirrel-skin coat. <i>Capisce?</i>

442
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,041
The door.

443
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,559
What? What door?

444
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,046
Nothing.

445
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,399
Just that my door is always open

446
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,719
to you, Andie. But we gotta go.

447
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,679
Come back here! Hey!

448
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,281
And hold on to that thing, okay?

449
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,764
Ooh! Ow! Tail!
Head! Tail! Head! Tail!

450
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,326
Yes! Yes! Yes!

451
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,959
Buddy, we found it!

452
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,891
The lost city of Nutlantis!

453
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,759
<i>I've been working on a bank heist
All the live long day</i>

454
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,879
Stop with the singing, will you?

455
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,766
Can you believe this?
I can't believe this!

456
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,403
Can you hear what
I'm saying to you?

457
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,399
And what's with that guy cracking
his knuckles all the time?

458
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,809
You know that's gonna lead to a
serious arthritic condition.

459
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,399
Thanks, chum. Sorry about that.
Went a little nuts.

460
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,001
I didn't say
anything stupid, did I?

461
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,399
Hey, how much is 20%?

462
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,559
You kidding me?

463
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,919
Is it a lot or is it a little?

464
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,199
You're not serious, are you?

465
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,439
Twenty of 100 is 20%.

466
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,610
Ah, burying nuts for winter, huh?

467
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,079
All right, listen up.

468
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,279
We're gonna dig our own hole, a
tunnel from here to the alley,

469
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,319
loot the whole place, get
fat for winter. Got it?

470
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,639
20%. Twenty of 100, that's what
20% is. You didn't go to school?

471
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,921
What's wrong with her?

472
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,919
Probably complaining about the
substandard working conditions here.

473
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,279
All right, brainiac, let's move.

474
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,244
You got an attitude.

475
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,319
Here we go!

476
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,201
Whoa!

477
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,279
All right, Surly, you're gonna
tell me what's going on in there.

478
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,079
Yes! Yes! Just give me that thing!

479
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,960
There's food in there
for the park, isn't there?

480
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,799
And you're gonna share it, right?

481
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,919
- Never!
- Fine!

482
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,202
All right! Share! I'll share!

483
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,119
- Fifty-fifty.
- Fifty-fifty?

484
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,279
I've never gone 50-50 in my life.

485
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,919
Fifty-fifty! Fifty-fifty!

486
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,451
Deal!

487
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,959
Ha-ha!

488
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,003
- I got four words for ya.
- Okay!

489
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,359
Thing-a-ma-booby.

490
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,959
- Ugh!
- How do you like that, huh?

491
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,799
- Okay, you win, you win!
Get that thing out of my face!
- Huh? Oh.

492
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,999
You got me.

493
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,279
So, you can talk.

494
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,799
Okay, I'll stop talking, then.
Just don't blow that whistle.

495
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,119
I'm not gonna feel sorry for you.

496
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,999
- Of course, yes, I understand.
- Stay.

497
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,319
All right, it's safe to come down.

498
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,761
I'm gonna level with you, 'cause
you seem like a reasonable guy.

499
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,319
If I don't get rid of you,

500
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,079
they are gonna send me back
to the pound, all right?

501
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,999
And I can't go back to that pound.

502
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,759
Oh, yeah, sure.
I believe you.

503
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,319
No, I'm a victim of circumstance.

504
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,519
Not my problem, dog. You guys okay?
Don't worry about her.

505
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,679
This is incredible!

506
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,884
There's enough food here
to feed the park for years!

507
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,359
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What're you doing?

508
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,959
Look, can we be friends?

509
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,679
- Oh, great.
- Come on!

510
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,599
I can do all sorts of stuff.
You wanna see? You know what?

511
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,199
I can fetch things. Huh?
I can sit.

512
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,846
Look at this thing! This is crazy!

513
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,039
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

514
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,359
Has a mind of its own.

515
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,439
Oh, Oh, Oh!

516
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,879
I can play dead! Watch.

517
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,199
Now I'm alive.

518
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,359
I mean, this is unbelievable.
It's like one to the next.

519
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,085
Dead, then alive. Right?

520
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,959
I'm getting some of this food
back to the park.

521
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,359
- What?
- We had a deal.

522
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,679
Well, I can attack her,
if you want.

523
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,719
I said, shut it.

524
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,959
Look, the deal is, you take
your share, I get mine,

525
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,159
we split ways.

526
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,567
There's no way I can get
these to the park safely.

527
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,561
We need a foolproof plan.

528
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,599
Good luck with that. Buddy
and I are digging a tunnel.

529
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,679
That's just... That's crazy.

530
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,281
No. It's brilliant!

531
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,799
Oh, Raccoon and the animals will
flip when they hear about this!

532
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,239
We'll be back, first thing tomorrow,
to get started on a tunnel.

533
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,479
That's not part of the deal.

534
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,719
Should I attack her now?

535
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,559
What? No! You stay!

536
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,364
I never said that
I'd work with the park.

537
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,199
Well, you're welcome to come
back with me, if you want.

538
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,679
Who knows, you might just
end up being a hero.

539
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,884
I'll be back with the team.
Well done, Surly!

540
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,491
Put a tail on her.
You know what I mean.

541
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,163
Hey, boss, I'm gonna
lick your face.

542
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,248
Come on, don't be weird.

543
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,959
I propose we assemble a team and
take the nuts for the park!

544
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,159
Yeah!

545
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,124
See? See, everybody?
What did I tell ya?

546
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,679
<i>The sunshiny days are here again.</i>

547
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,879
Okay. Okay, wait. Wait! But
we have to work with Surly.

548
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,970
That's right! We are working with...
Are you nuts?

549
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,841
I negotiated a deal with him.
We split everything, 50-50.

550
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,119
Negotiate?

551
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,199
With Surly? Are you kidding me?

552
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,079
He's the reason we don't
have any nuts to begin with!

553
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,799
No! No!

554
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,159
Hey, listen. For as long as
this old mill has stood,

555
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,079
we have always worked together
and kept our promises.

556
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,329
We are not a pack of wild animals!

557
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,681
These two are animals.

558
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,479
Winter is coming.

559
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,439
If we don't work with Surly,
we won't survive.

560
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,399
Did Grayson see this nut supply?

561
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,439
No. Um... We got separated.

562
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,971
Let's all wait until
Grayson gets back...

563
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,039
We don't know
if Grayson's ever coming back.

564
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,759
Grayson's not coming back? What?

565
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,959
- No!
- Terrible.

566
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,039
Wait. Who's gonna
be handsome, then?

567
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,839
I have come to a decision.

568
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,279
The Bruisers, Mole and Andie will
dig a tunnel to get the nuts out.

569
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,720
Mole will lead.

570
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,161
A-ha!

571
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,839
I will?

572
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,479
And while I don't trust Surly,
we will work with him. For now.

573
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,399
When all the nuts are secure,
we will take what is ours.

574
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,206
We do not honor deals with Surly.

575
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,039
For the park!

576
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,571
For the park! Yeah!

577
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,610
Why aren't we doing this at night?

578
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,719
All right, let's get to work!
Stand back!

579
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,970
Guys, the nut store is over there.

580
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,125
Allow me.

581
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,961
Ha!

582
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,399
So, what do you think? Green wire?

583
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,759
Hmm. Read my mind.

584
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,519
Wait. We don't know what that...

585
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,281
Andie, I am in charge.
Proceed, my dear.

586
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,319
No! Sis, wake up! Wake up, sis!

587
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,639
Jamie! Wake up, sis! Come on...

588
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,359
Disperse!

589
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,531
I have been trained in mouth-to-mouth
resuscitative measures.

590
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,326
She's fine.

591
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,367
Grayson?

592
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,839
I've been casing
this place for days.

593
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,039
Every hole, vent, trap and
window is mapped in my head.

594
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,919
You wanna break into this
joint, survive the winter,

595
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,885
you talk to me.

596
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,799
We cut the alarm wire
from the tunnel.

597
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,119
When you two hit the vault,

598
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,159
we got three minutes to dynamite
it and get that dough out.

599
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,079
We dig here, from the
alley into the basement.

600
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,879
Why don't we just
use the door thing?

601
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,439
Too unpredictable. They lock it

602
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,039
from the inside.
Now, listen closely.

603
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,159
We fill the vault
with bags of nuts.

604
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,239
We seal it,
we head for state lines.

605
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,719
It'll be days before the bank
realizes they got peanuts on deposit.

606
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,919
Agreed?

607
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,039
Agreed. But I do not dig.

608
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,719
'Cause you're blind as a bat.

609
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,321
What? Who said that?
Where are you?

610
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,799
What kinda haul
are we talking, pops?

611
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,399
We're talking almonds,
pistachios, walnuts, Brazils...

612
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,759
Enough cashews
to buy yourselves a racetrack.

613
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,724
And did I mention
the peanut brittle?

614
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,851
That a candy or a nut?

615
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,201
Both.

616
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,999
Now, listen up.
This is my last heist.

617
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,330
I ain't going back to that
rat-filled slammer, you dig?

618
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,001
That's all we've been doing!

619
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,399
Fire in the hole!

620
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,599
I'm gonna kill you!

621
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,039
What's going on down...

622
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,919
It's the same thing every time.

623
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,363
We keep running into this
hard brick-colored substance.

624
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,051
Do you mean brick?

625
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,639
We can't speculate on
what is or isn't brick,

626
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,039
but suffice to say,

627
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,239
this material has a high number
of brick-like properties.

628
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,399
Okay, cut it out! Who is that?

629
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,239
I guess there's no other choice.

630
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,519
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

631
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,239
We're not falling for it again!

632
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,125
No, no, no, I'm serious. There's
a loose brick over here.

633
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,559
Yeah. Yeah.
Definitely a loose brick.

634
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Hey, hey, Johnny. Johnny! Hey,
I got a loose brick over here.

635
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,199
Come here, come on,
help me with this.

636
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,759
Got it. Come on!
Together, let's do this!

637
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,679
Yeah! Come on, let's move it.

638
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,848
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Hey.

639
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,679
Was this open the whole time?

640
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,039
I don't know. I just got here.

641
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,439
Come on, how about that face lick?

642
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,165
Lick yourself.

643
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,119
Hey, what are those guys doin'?

644
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,448
Digging for bones. Move it.

645
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,599
- Come on, Johnny!
- Heave!

646
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,439
Okay, we can do this.
I think it's moving.

647
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,079
Come on, heave. Heave.

648
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,319
Yeah, yeah. That's it.

649
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,159
That's it. You're doing great.
Keep up the, uh...

650
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,039
What do you call that? The teamwork.
Yeah, good for you.

651
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,239
She's moving.

652
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,566
Make it last! Heave! Kick it!

653
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,839
Heave! Heave!

654
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,371
Here you go, guys! Here you...

655
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,886
Where's Surly?

656
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,159
Hey, guys. Look what I found.
Isn't it great?

657
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,799
- Come on. Come on.
- No!

658
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,959
Come get it!

659
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,119
No! Let go!

660
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,279
I cannot stop!

661
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,359
- No, let go of the stick.
- It's impossible!

662
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,959
Let go of the stick!

663
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,159
I do not know how to
let go of the stick.

664
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,799
Let go of this!

665
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,604
All right, fine!

666
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,920
Hey, Surly.

667
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,524
What'd you have for breakfast?

668
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,251
You brought nuts!

669
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,439
Hey, all right! Way to go, Surly!

670
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,479
Way to go, Surly!

671
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,839
I'm dead!

672
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,879
They'd have sent me back
to that dog pound, Surly,

673
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,999
I know it, I just know it!

674
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,559
What am I gonna do? What am
I gonna do? You gotta help me!

675
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,839
I'll do whatever you say.
Whatever you say.

676
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,488
Hey, what happened here?

677
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,039
What happened?
I want some answers!

678
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,686
Say, fellas. Look!

679
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,479
That squirrel was trying
to blow up the nut store,

680
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,519
and Precious stopped him!

681
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,879
Can you believe it?
Good pup! Good pup!

682
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,679
What's wrong with you?

683
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,599
Get that wall cemented up.

684
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,679
From now on,
I want that coal chute

685
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,848
shut at all times, you hear me?

686
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,329
Give the mutt a treat.

687
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,528
Now cement that wall up!

688
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,199
That dog is one smart dog.
She's smarter than you.

689
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,319
She's smarter than you!

690
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,479
She's smarter than me?

691
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,559
No one's smarter than me.

692
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,808
No one's smarter than you.

693
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,119
That's right!

694
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,759
Right! I'm glad we're
in agreement, for once.

695
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,246
Of course.

696
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,366
Surly?

697
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,839
Hey, what's going on?

698
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,804
This trashcan has a hole in it.

699
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,446
We use it as cover to dig a new
hole into the human hole. No brick.

700
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,919
Now that's groundhog thinking,
right there.

701
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,319
Okay, well, how long will it take?

702
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,239
Day or two. Depending on any
pipes or rocks we come across.

703
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,439
It'll be three days.

704
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,639
It'll be two days!

705
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,039
- Three!
- You wanna take this to the ground?

706
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,759
Ridiculous! It'll never work!

707
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,439
You'll need Raccoon's approval.

708
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,639
You kiddin' me?

709
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,491
Raccoon's gonna love this idea!

710
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,039
Yeah. Raccoon. Guy's not even here

711
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,402
and he's still ruining my life.

712
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,319
I gotta tell ya,
the nerve of those bums!

713
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,159
The nerve of those bums!

714
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,919
"Raccoon would approve of this!"

715
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,479
Oh, really? Raccoon! That guy,
he's a bigger thief than I am!

716
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,639
But those blockheads can't see it.
They're blind as Mole.

717
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,679
I'm the brains of this outfit. I'm
the guy with the... The brains.

718
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,839
Did I already say that?

719
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,119
Raccoon's nothing
but a lying old sack of fur!

720
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,526
What?

721
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,726
Hey, Surly, over here.

722
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,490
What...

723
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,839
What are you doing here?

724
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,999
Aren't you supposed to be working
on that tunnel? Raccoon's orders.

725
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,839
There's something
you need to know.

726
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,639
I haven't been completely honest.

727
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,251
Yeah. Right.

728
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,891
Raccoon's planning
to double-cross you.

729
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,359
We were all in on it. I'm
sorry, but just seeing how...

730
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,643
Raccoon's always had it
out for me. And besides,

731
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,844
who says I'm helping?

732
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,403
But you are helping us,
aren't you?

733
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,806
I'm helping myself.

734
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,365
Right. My mistake.

735
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,243
Just remember, Surly,
that park needs those nuts.

736
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,724
Do what you will.

737
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,079
I didn't authorize
any handouts, did I?

738
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,329
You know Andie. it was her idea.

739
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,563
Are you looking for these?

740
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,159
I know Andie. She lacks
obedience. Can't follow orders.

741
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,964
But she follows Surly.

742
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,559
You know, he even tamed
that guard dog?

743
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,250
He could actually pull this off.

744
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,889
The day Surly saves
this park is the day

745
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,367
nuts will rain from the skies!

746
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,161
Hmm.

747
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,131
There could be an accident.

748
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,279
Have you considered sabotage?

749
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,279
What? Hey, what's gotten into you?

750
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,519
It's only Surly,
a two-bit trash can thief.

751
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,199
It's not about thievery.

752
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,439
It's about that food
getting to those animals.

753
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,564
Have you forgotten my motto?

754
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,559
"Animals are controlled by the
amount of food they have."

755
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,959
- "It is our duty...
- "It's our duty...

756
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,679
- "...to keep it from them."
- "...to keep it from them."

757
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,841
Good. Now, where were we?
Ah, yes. Sabotage.

758
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,527
Yeah, sabotage.

759
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,683
Um... What is that, French?

760
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,001
What are you up to, Mole?

761
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,679
Grayson?

762
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,769
Surly? Ha!

763
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,959
- Hey. Hey.
- Surly! Surly!

764
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,719
- Hands off. What's wrong with you?
- Thank goodness!

765
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,759
Everything's wrong with me!

766
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,119
I've been out there
with the people,

767
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,561
and the cars, and the cats, and...

768
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,207
Rat! It's a rat!

769
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,199
Hold me! No, I'll hold you!

770
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,679
Whack job! What're you doing?
You're drowning me in...

771
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,006
Drown.

772
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,039
Buddy, watch him.

773
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,208
And keep him away
from sharp objects.

774
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,319
Okay, how about this one?

775
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,489
Mole, what are you doing?

776
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,288
Wait, wait. Is that water?

777
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,449
- Let's get out of here!
- Whoa!

778
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,239
I'm gettin' me a pettin' zoo.

779
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,519
What are you gettin'?

780
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,239
- A new partner.
- That's it!

781
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,279
Hey, can it! You hear somethin'?

782
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,399
No.

783
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,291
Dog! Dog! Open up!

784
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,279
Dog, dog, open up! Dog, get out here!
This bird's gonna kill me!

785
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,999
- Yeah? Lana...
- Come on, come on, come on!

786
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,119
Do it now! Do it now! Hurry up!

787
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,319
Honey, not now, no.

788
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,999
I can't talk right now
'cause we're...

789
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,804
<i>Come on! All the guys are asking!</i>

790
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,839
Potty break? Now?
No, no, no. Not you, honey.

791
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,039
No, no. Look, sweetie...

792
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,959
What was that? Ma, is that you?

793
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,959
Get to the alley
and stop the water!

794
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,759
Stop the water. Got it.

795
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,119
Hey, you're not the boss of me!

796
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,687
Apparently, you are. I love you.

797
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,003
First stop water, then lick face.

798
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,604
Surly, what are you doing?

799
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,089
Shoot that rodent! Shoot it!

800
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,764
Quick! Where's the shut-off valve?

801
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,048
I smell a rat, boss!

802
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,523
Rats did this? Find the rat.

803
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,239
I'm confused as to
what kind of rats

804
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,279
we're talking about here, boss.

805
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,529
It's him! There he is, the rat!

806
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,159
Are they okay? Huh?

807
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,044
They're gonna be fine.

808
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,999
Hey, don't tell the other dogs
we're friends, all right?

809
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,361
It wouldn't look good.

810
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,559
Ooh! That guy needs glasses!

811
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,764
- Dog!
- Got it! Hey!

812
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,323
Surly! You left me!

813
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,679
Wait, man, don't leave me alone!

814
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,879
There is a crazed rat up there!

815
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,491
- Hey, wait! Hey!
- Grayson?

816
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,086
Is that you?

817
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,644
Shut the front door!
What are you two doing here?

818
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,599
Face lick!

819
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,131
That's not his face.

820
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,559
So, you're the mole,
double entendre intended!

821
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,599
Nah, I'm a chicken.

822
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,088
I saw you sabotage our tunnel.
Was it Raccoon? Talk!

823
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,919
Hey, you want me to hurt him?

824
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,121
Keep a lookout.

825
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,691
Yeah, boss.

826
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,002
Do your worst. Go on!

827
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,559
I am a sealed vault,
resistant to questioning.

828
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,399
A tough nut to crack. A
concrete pillar. A jar with a...

829
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,439
My retinas! Raccoon's
trying to stop the heist!

830
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,719
I'm not buying it.

831
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,479
Less food means more control!

832
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,810
If the heist succeeds, Raccoon
will lose control of the park!

833
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,285
But so what? You don't care
about the park, do you?

834
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,848
I don't. But when I tell
the team, I'll get double.

835
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,439
You think they'll
believe a criminal like you?

836
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,971
After what I did for them?

837
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,759
Oh, they'll listen.

838
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,883
Yeah, don't kid yourself.

839
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,999
Oh, man! There was
water all over the place!

840
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,879
Johnny was choking, I was choking,

841
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,959
and then the next thing you know,

842
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,239
there's Grayson! He saved my butt!

843
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,159
He saved my butt!

844
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,119
- It was my butt.
- Oh, yeah?

845
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,879
Stop talking about butts.
Talk about me.

846
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,959
I'll kick both your butts!
Come here! Come here!

847
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,403
Grayson, I'm so glad you're...

848
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,999
Great to have you back, Grayson!

849
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,522
It's been a disaster.
We had to work with Surly.

850
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,526
Surly?

851
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,010
Surly!

852
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,639
They think I shaved their butts.

853
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,799
Surly!

854
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,959
Careful! They come hither!

855
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,003
What happened? You were up here.

856
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,479
You ready for this piece of news?

857
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,967
It was Mole.

858
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,999
Saw him try to drown the twins.
He confessed to everything.

859
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,201
Mole?

860
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,324
It was all Raccoon's idea.

861
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:12,047
So, you're blaming Raccoon because
he kicked you out of the park.

862
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,799
No, I'm not.

863
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,679
Raccoon has never
harmed us before.

864
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,120
But he sure has!

865
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,442
Hey, listen. I just wanna get
my cut and split, all right?

866
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,599
- Grayson...
- Yes!

867
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,999
You were there.

868
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,770
I was! Wait... Where?

869
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,439
You think it was me, don't you?

870
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,679
No! No one said that.

871
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,041
Just explain yourself.

872
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,808
Buddy, did you see anything?

873
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,404
Wait, you're asking him?

874
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,406
He can't help you.
You're wasting your time!

875
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,405
He's useless! Can't speak!

876
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,725
Only knows how to take orders!
Kinda like you, Andie.

877
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,799
Is that how you treat the
only animal who defends you?

878
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,319
- No. No.
- You lousy...

879
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,479
Just let him go.
That tunnel is open now.

880
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,599
We get our share out before morning.
Let him take his.

881
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,799
We can't trust him!

882
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,288
We let him go. Honor the deal.

883
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,079
Bye, Surly! Come back soon!

884
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,170
I mean, stay away!
I dislike you strongly!

885
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,439
Hey, Surl, are we gonna get
the team together? Huh?

886
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,679
Do another heist?

887
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,041
No. Now's a bad time.

888
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,964
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I get it. Okay, not now.

889
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,799
So how about now, huh?

890
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,599
I said no.
Job's done. Team's done.

891
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,643
You need a lookout? Huh? Huh?

892
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,679
Now, get back to your humans.
I'm on my own now.

893
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,325
We're playing that game again!
All right.

894
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,169
No. No! Get out of here! Scat!

895
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,164
Hey, look what you made me do.

896
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,924
Whoa! Whoa!

897
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,919
No! Surly! Watch out, it's a...

898
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,924
What are we gonna
do with him, boss?

899
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,479
Shut it and grab me
that blowtorch.

900
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,766
Lana...

901
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,399
Yeah, right. Good seeing you.

902
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,759
Nice seeing you, Lana.

903
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,008
We gotta go do, uh, tunnel stuff.

904
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,759
So now you know.

905
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,719
When were you gonna tell me, King?

906
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,847
I already told you before.
You can't change who you are.

907
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,922
Boss, come here!

908
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,928
Well, go on. Rob your
bank, already!

909
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,599
This really is my last job.

910
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,167
Boss! Come on!

911
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,239
Hey, hey!

912
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,762
This is it. A goldmine
right over our heads!

913
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,850
Let's blow this thing.

914
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,004
What about Lana?

915
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,931
But I don't have the whistle.

916
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,931
I know.

917
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,489
Hold him down!
Hold him down! That's it.

918
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,851
Well, what do we have here?

919
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,801
A hero or a thief?

920
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,401
You think you can starve the
park to stay in control?

921
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,119
Mole told me everything.

922
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,199
What? What's he talking about?
I didn't say anything!

923
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,639
He's loopy! Yeah. Cuckoo,
you know, nuts. Whoo-hoo!

924
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,199
Is this another
one of your swindles?

925
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,719
Some half-baked
revenge against me?

926
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,085
It's something else, isn't it?
You're trying to impress.

927
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,409
Grayson, perhaps. Andie?

928
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,528
Oh, I see.

929
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,959
No matter. My accomplices will
take care of them soon enough.

930
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,039
They don't follow me.
They hate me. They hate me!

931
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,159
Maybe, but I can't
leave any evidence, Surly.

932
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,479
Every good thief knows that.

933
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,319
Hey, this is getting a little
crazy, don't you think? I mean...

934
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,559
Maybe we'll finish you off next!

935
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,161
And where's that shiny thing
he's supposed to have?

936
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,564
All right, this is it. Ten, nine...

937
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,167
You'll get the rest once you
dispose of Andie and Grayson.

938
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,319
I'll finish off Mr. Hero myself.

939
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,603
The park'll get rid of you.
They'll vote in new leaders.

940
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,880
How many leaders do you think
this park can have?

941
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,731
Three, two...

942
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,087
One!

943
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,047
He'll warn the others!
What are you waiting for?

944
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,767
After him!

945
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,079
Bingo, boys.

946
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,719
Hey, hey!

947
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,410
Hey, look at all this moolah!

948
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,361
Load the dough into the trucks.
And let's get out of here.

949
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,969
You two, stick the nuts in
the vault and seal it up.

950
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,759
What are you gonna
do with your money, huh?

951
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,959
Pettin' zoo!

952
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,159
I'm gonna buy me three pettin'
zoos, and give you two of 'em!

953
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,559
And ponies!
Don't forget the ponies!

954
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,039
Pretty little ponies!

955
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,481
They're so soft and cuddly.
One more!

956
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,999
What the... I told you to load
those nuts into the vault.

957
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,679
Yeah, so why did you take
the cart out of the tunnel?

958
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,759
What kind of game
are you playing here?

959
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,359
What kind of game are you playing?

960
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,279
Relax, we probably
just bumped the cart.

961
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,041
Or maybe it was rats!

962
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,970
Holy Toledo!

963
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,721
Watch out.

964
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,959
I'll handle these rats.

965
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,479
- Squirrels!
- Watch out!

966
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,920
- Hang on, Fingers!
- Hey!

967
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,759
- Get going.
- Okay.

968
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,839
What about you?

969
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,799
What, are you deaf?
I said, get going!

970
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,606
It was going so smooth!

971
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,090
Grayson, you moron!

972
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,079
Surly, I need a disguise!
Something flamboyant!

973
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,959
What? Get your head
out of your tail!

974
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,159
Lead the team into the tunnel
and escape through our hole.

975
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,439
I'll distract the big guy.

976
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,319
I'll need some skates, a
mustache and maybe a cape.

977
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,919
You don't need a cape.
I can't help the park alone.

978
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,279
I'm not a hero, but you are.

979
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,679
Last summer,
during that heat wave,

980
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,239
who discovered that broken sprinkler
so everyone could have water?

981
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,319
I did?

982
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,879
That's right! They believe in heroes.
So snap out of it and be one.

983
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,491
It's hero time.

984
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,929
It's hero time! Why am I shouting?

985
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,567
Rats!

986
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,599
Rats! Run! Run for your lives!
Children and Grayson first! Run!

987
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,079
It's Grayson!

988
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,559
- He's come to save us!
- Run! Get out of my way! Run!

989
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,205
Now is our chance. Let's go!

990
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,239
Move it, everybody! Move! Move!

991
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,208
Mole? What are you doing here?

992
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,565
Andie, thank goodness you're here.

993
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,401
Raccoon?

994
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,919
Surly is planning to
double-cross us all.

995
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,610
He confessed everything.

996
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,239
What? He said it's you and Mole

997
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,719
who tried to drown The Bruisers.

998
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,839
But he's working for Surly.

999
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,371
What?

1000
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,129
Would you stop doing that?

1001
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,569
Jimmy, Johnny, get to the park
and bring more animals to help.

1002
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,759
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1003
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,119
- Out of the way. Out of the way.
- Me first.

1004
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,759
Rest of us will unload the
nuts from that van there.

1005
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,079
For the park!

1006
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,361
Come on, guys!

1007
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,799
I know what I'm going to
spend some of my money on.

1008
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,279
Whoa! Look at that, Buddy!

1009
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,439
Celebrate later. This van
could move at any time.

1010
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,239
Start unloading.

1011
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,569
Raccoon, I'm sorry I doubted you.

1012
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,162
Raccoon! Open this door!
Raccoon! Open the door!

1013
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,759
Raccoon! Open this door right now!

1014
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,325
Open it! Open the door!

1015
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,119
Let him go. It won't
change the plan.

1016
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,084
<i>Ole! Ole! Ole!</i>

1017
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,439
Amazing!

1018
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,608
But that will.

1019
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,801
Whee!

1020
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,763
I am enjoying myself!

1021
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,847
Bank to the left! Higher!

1022
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,489
<i>Ole! Ole! Ole!</i>

1023
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,159
We gotta get everybody out
of this van. Find a way in.

1024
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,805
Follow me! This...

1025
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,406
Oh, boy!

1026
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,079
- Hey, we did it, Fingers.
- Yeah!

1027
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,239
Easy street!

1028
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,805
I gotta take a look.

1029
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,525
Ooh, yeah!

1030
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,201
What?

1031
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,290
Nothing but nuts.

1032
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,679
- We've been had!
- What?

1033
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,479
No money! Those dirty rats!

1034
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,919
Hey, hey, Squirrel!

1035
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,485
That's right, a squirrel!

1036
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,880
It's that squirrel! And a bird?

1037
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,643
Looks like they're on to us.

1038
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,925
Time to end this little charade.

1039
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,199
Turn around!

1040
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,839
I can't see!

1041
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,201
Go after 'em!

1042
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,127
We can do this.

1043
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,399
Whoa!

1044
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,199
Come on, try again.

1045
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,845
We need Grayson.

1046
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,690
Grayson, are you there?

1047
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,088
Not to worry, I'm perfectly safe.

1048
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,961
Help!

1049
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,601
Oh!

1050
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,159
Thank you! Thank you!

1051
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,839
Mole, quit clowning around
and help us open this door.

1052
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,279
Give me a boost, Grayson.

1053
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,891
<i>Ole!</i>

1054
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,161
Grayson! He's here to save us!

1055
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,879
Oh.

1056
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,799
- Let me explain!
- Let's get him, guys!

1057
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,279
Hey, wait a second.

1058
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,599
Forget him. The door's open.
We can push the nuts out.

1059
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,679
A-ha!

1060
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,325
- What...
- Raccoon!

1061
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,159
You can't...

1062
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,361
Let go, you idiot!

1063
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,799
Help me throw him off
before he kills us all!

1064
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,607
Kill us? This squirrel is a hero!

1065
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,799
Well, co-hero, actually.

1066
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:46,479
Raccoon is the double-crosser!
You have to believe me!

1067
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,799
Hang on, Mole!

1068
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,239
What does it look like I'm doing?

1069
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,599
Why did you lock us in here?

1070
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,879
You're wasting time!

1071
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,919
This is our one opportunity to
rid the park of this villain.

1072
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,565
For the park!

1073
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,359
You still haven't
answered the question.

1074
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,439
This is treason. Andie!

1075
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,679
Answer the question, Raccoon.
Was Surly telling the truth?

1076
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,291
Answer!

1077
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,879
I call for a vote!

1078
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,039
Agreed!

1079
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,323
All those in favor of
banishment, raise your paws!

1080
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,481
Raccoon!

1081
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,599
Shiny!

1082
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,131
Hey!

1083
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,241
State lines are
just past this dam.

1084
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,568
Then we are home free.

1085
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,841
You're the thief.

1086
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,450
Not Surly.

1087
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,285
He was right about you.

1088
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,491
Hey, hey! No, no, no,
there's dynamite back there.

1089
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,041
Huh?

1090
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,281
Hmm.

1091
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,559
<i>All right, boys,</i>

1092
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,649
<i>we've got you
completely surrounded.</i>

1093
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,159
<i>Come out with your hands up!</i>

1094
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,599
Out! Now!

1095
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,279
I saw this coming.

1096
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,811
No, you didn't.

1097
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,439
Mole, where is everybody?

1098
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,599
Still inside. But Andie's in
the other van with Raccoon.

1099
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,279
You can't stop him alone.

1100
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,639
Surly, what's happened to you?

1101
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,842
All I wanted was a pettin' zoo.

1102
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,730
You'll never get away with this.

1103
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,282
I want my mommy.

1104
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,602
They've got hostages. Stand down.

1105
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,525
Whoa!

1106
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,931
Holy Toledo!

1107
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,039
Whoa! I bet it was that squirrel!

1108
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,890
Enough with the squirrels!

1109
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,799
Andie. Andie.

1110
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,731
Surly?

1111
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,001
Oh!

1112
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,841
Whoa!

1113
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,039
Andie? Andie?

1114
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,810
We can still save the cash.

1115
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,087
Hey, where you going?
What are you doing?

1116
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,808
There's more money.

1117
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,531
Ha-ha.

1118
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,999
What are you
trying to prove, Surly?

1119
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,959
Raccoon, it's not stable.

1120
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,119
Why are you doing this? Tell me.

1121
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,721
Buddy! Atta boy, pal!

1122
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,164
The shiny! Give it to me!

1123
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,164
Not so fast, thief!

1124
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,606
No!

1125
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,799
Look, Surly and Raccoon!

1126
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,890
They'll go over the falls.
Everyone, come on.

1127
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,639
I got you.

1128
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,159
- Don't let go.
- Hold on!

1129
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,999
- You can do it.
- Raccoon, climb up!

1130
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,639
Let go! No, don't let go!

1131
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,839
We can save both of you! Hurry!

1132
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,879
Never! You backstabbing vermin!

1133
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,401
Surly goes down with me!

1134
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,530
Buddy, that was some score.

1135
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,519
We almost pulled it off,
didn't we?

1136
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,768
Surly, don't you dare let go.

1137
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,599
I'm sorry, Andie!

1138
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,165
- What?
- No!

1139
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,919
Surly, no!

1140
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,410
Is it?

1141
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,085
Look!

1142
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,559
- It's Grayson!
- Grayson!

1143
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,519
Thank you. Thank you.
No autographs, please.

1144
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,929
You can admire the tail,
but no touching.

1145
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,199
- Grayson! Yeah!
- Thank you!

1146
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,243
The wheel! Jump!

1147
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,919
Thank you! Thank you. You're welcome.
You're welcome.

1148
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,119
Grayson!

1149
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,401
What's going on here?

1150
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,559
Ha! Never fear!

1151
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,125
Grayson!

1152
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,599
You two guys are here, too?

1153
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,290
Hi!

1154
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,239
Ha-ha! Come on, guys!

1155
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,851
Let's go!

1156
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,521
Rats! It's a rat!

1157
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,409
It's a rat...

1158
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,519
Take me away, Officers. Take me away.
Just save me from the rats.

1159
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,200
Percy "King" Dimpleweed,

1160
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,004
you and I are officially through.

1161
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,210
Come on, let's go.

1162
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,844
Hey, Precious,
where you going, girl?

1163
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,006
Precious?

1164
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,530
Psst! Buddy.

1165
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,925
Come with me.

1166
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,729
Best... Friend.

1167
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,121
What are you looking at?

1168
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,919
Wait, Buddy. Did you just speak?

1169
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,199
Okay, okay, okay,
enough, enough, enough.

1170
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,239
I get it, you like me, I get it.

1171
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,329
Precious! Precious!

1172
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,439
Okay, Surly, so, see
you at the nut store.

1173
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,439
Wait, what? That place?

1174
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,919
Yeah, Lana's the new owner.
Hey, no more whistles, huh?

1175
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,639
Just face licks.

1176
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,285
Oh, hi, Andie.

1177
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,161
Surly!

1178
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,679
When you went over those falls,

1179
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,008
I thought I'd never see you again.

1180
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,479
Oh! We got to go. Come on.

1181
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,999
Okay, calm down.
Where are we going?

1182
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,959
You risked your life to save this park.
Everyone has to know.

1183
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,321
No.

1184
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,487
The team saved the park.

1185
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,599
Okay, stop touching the tail.

1186
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,723
Stop touching. Stop.
Stop touching the tail!

1187
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,004
So then what are you going to do?

1188
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,519
I'm gonna keep
finding food for this park.

1189
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,530
But from now on,
we do it together.

1190
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,371
Deal?

1191
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,523
This park will always
honor your deals, Surly.

1192
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,199
<i>Yeah, they say life's
there for the taking,</i>

1193
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,526
<i>but the truth is,</i>

1194
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,883
<i>life's really there
for the sharing.</i>

1195
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,039
<i>Huh.</i>

1196
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,999
<i>Once you realize that,</i>

1197
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,399
<i>you might discover there's a
little hero in all of us.</i>

1198
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,888
<i>After all, we're all a little nuts.</i>

1199
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,600
Any more big ideas?

1200
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,451
Please stay.
