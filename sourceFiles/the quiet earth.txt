1
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,061
Hello?

2
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,057
Hello?

3
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:10,861
Come on! I know someone's in there!

4
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:25,734
Hello?

5
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:29,198
Hello?

6
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,260
Hello? Is anybody out there?
Is anybody receiving me?

7
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:44,341
Complete.

8
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:10,189
Warning: Radiation danger.
The lab will be sealed immediately.

9
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,354
Warning: The lab is now sealed.

10
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:24,915
There's nobody in administration!

11
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,119
You did it this time, Perrin. International Cooperation, eh?

12
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:43,922
Well, you got everybody, including yourself.

13
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:49,124
Ultraviolet level now exceeding 100 milliwatts.
Don protective clothing.

14
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:51,646
Even me.

15
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:33,640
...from Tanko, Texas.

16
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:35,871
Analysis of these programs by our own computer

17
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:38,927
indicates that the programs being supplied are incomplete.

18
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:42,833
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that the LinCo HQ

19
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:45,185
are deliberately withholding
information.

20
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:46,475
I am unable to continue

21
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,786
blindly working on a project
of such phenomenal destructive potential.

22
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:53,868
Accordingly, there is only
one course of action open to me.

23
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:00,960
Zac Hobson, July 5th.

24
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,921
One: There has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight

25
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:05,938
with devastating results.

26
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:12,274
Two: it seems I'm the only
person left on Earth.

27
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:18,876
Three: Perrin has been incinerated at the grid control.
Four: ...

28
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,888
I've been sealed in the lab

29
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,519
so I've setup a gas device in the washroom hoping to

30
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:32,601
Warning: Alternate fire extinguishers not operating.

31
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:09,896
Name, address, phone number.

32
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:17,178
Hello. My name is Zac Hobson.

33
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,389
If there's anybody out
there at all, could you

34
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,540
please contact me at home.
2 Thurston Avenue, Grey Lynn.

35
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:26,902
Or ring me on 396-121.

36
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:32,424
Hello. My name is Zac Hobson.

37
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,475
If there's anybody out
there at all, could you

38
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:38,765
please contact me at home.
2 Thurston Avenue, Grey Lynn.

39
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:41,767
Or ring me on 396-121.

40
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:14,439
Attention, attention. Would all those alive
please step forward and show themselves.

41
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:21,520
...will be regarded as a direct
contravention of regulation 366025,

42
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:23,553
section 11 paragraph B.

43
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:36,768
Please somebody come.

44
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,784
Time I moved up in the world.

45
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:51,334
12th of July. I have now been broadcasting this
message for 5 days without reply.

46
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:53,726
Please ignore my previous address

47
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:59,937
as I am now a resident at 5 Rosehill Gardens, Churtin Heights.

48
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,208
Pop in for a visit, or phone 665-058.

49
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:08,311
I'd be delighted to hear from you.

50
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:11,012
Hello. This is Zac Hobson again.

51
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:17,793
12th of July. I have now been broadcasting this
message for 5 days without reply.

52
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:19,535
Please ignore my previous address

53
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:25,826
as I am now a resident at 5 Rosehill Gardens, Churtin Heights.

54
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,449
Pop in for a visit, or phone 66-

55
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:25,032
Very flamboyant.
Pity nothing went down.

56
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:30,995
Thought I'd give you a bit of a chance.

57
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:38,776
Big mistake. Polish this game off in one break.

58
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,960
Terrified.

59
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,143
Can't win against that kind of luck.

60
00:23:56,174 --> 00:23:57,254
Skill.

61
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:58,897
...should be shut down immediately.
- Well I don't think that's the right thing to do.

62
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,518
I honestly and sincerely believe that.

63
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,879
It is your country's duty, as part of the
free world, to pursue all avenues of

64
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:09,241
technological research that contribute to our position.

65
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:12,842
thus maintaining the balance of power
that exists in the world today.

66
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:16,468
Now I cannot overemphasize this
point, because you can rest assured

67
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,635
that - even as I speak - this
is what the other side is d-

68
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:25,758
What are you gonna do?
Destroy us all?

69
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,799
I'm taking over.

70
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,904
Look, I haven't got time to talk
to you. I'm a very busy man.

71
00:26:44,027 --> 00:26:45,466
Besides, you've had your chance.

72
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:13,608
I have dedicated all my scientific
knowledge and skill to projects

73
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:16,926
which I knew could be
put to evil purposes.

74
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:22,579
For the common good!

75
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:36,473
How easy to believe
in the common good,

76
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:39,505
when that belief is rewarded

77
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:44,306
with status, wealth

78
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:46,348
and power!

79
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:56,511
How hard to believe
in the common good.

80
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:03,493
When every fiber of my being tells me

81
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:07,935
that the awesome forces
that I have helped to create

82
00:28:08,196 --> 00:28:11,796
have been put into the hands of madmen!

83
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:18,039
I've been gay by the volume
of my own corruption!

84
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:21,881
Is it not fitting, then, that I be president?

85
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:24,756
Of this...

86
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:29,234
...quiet Earth?

87
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:36,385
I've been condemned to live.

88
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:51,512
Where is he?

89
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,999
Alright, where are you?

90
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,950
Where are you?

91
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:41,343
Where is he?

92
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:47,159
If you don't come out, I'll shoot the kid!

93
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,903
And now I am God.

94
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:52,599
Hello.
- G'day.

95
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:56,086
How are you?
- Pretty good. Whaddya know?

96
00:35:05,963 --> 00:35:09,988
UV's up a bit. Keep an eye on that.

97
00:35:34,895 --> 00:35:36,375
It's not real.

98
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,464
God, it's good to see someone.

99
00:35:55,435 --> 00:35:56,675
So, I went into my sister's room...

100
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:01,101
...and she was gone.

101
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:05,067
I mean gone.

102
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:09,103
Just...

103
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,781
...disappeared.

104
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:20,069
I hung around for about two weeks after that.
I don't remember much.

105
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:21,190
It was pretty bad.

106
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,921
Guess you were a little crazy.

107
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:26,406
I didn't decide I was president of the world.

108
00:36:27,741 --> 00:36:30,141
It was really strange walking through
the hospital in the dark.

109
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:34,901
No sound. Empty beds.

110
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,701
I was quite shocked when I saw the baby.
- Baby?

111
00:36:41,421 --> 00:36:43,061
Yeah, not just that it was a baby

112
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:47,339
I didn't look too closely. There were maggots.

113
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,371
That means there must be flies.

114
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:52,501
No. The effect happened three weeks ago.

115
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,041
The baby hadn't been dead that long.

116
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,052
Something's changed.

117
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,540
I can't quite measure it,
but I can feel it.

118
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,279
It's as though we've been shifted sideways.

119
00:37:13,752 --> 00:37:15,292
North Pole's still up north,

120
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:19,047
but the water keeps going down
the plug hole the wrong way.

121
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:23,113
I get the feeling...

122
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:26,323
We're either dead...

123
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:29,292
...or in a different universe.

124
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:54,897
Are you in a different universe?
Are you a woman?

125
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,300
...or a child?

126
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,669
I've got this theory...

127
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,794
I believe people's faces are soft, like plasticine.

128
00:38:20,903 --> 00:38:23,823
They're not rigid, like bone,
as doctors would have us believe.

129
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,836
And the shape of the face is
determined consciously by the brain.

130
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:31,573
So, if your brain has got a low capacity,

131
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:34,442
you would be both ugly and stupid.

132
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,001
But if you've got a reasonably good brain,

133
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:38,036
then it's up to you to decide
how to use its energy.

134
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:40,612
You could be reasonably attractive
and reasonably intelligent...

135
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:44,721
...or you could be
smart, but ugly.

136
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:49,458
Or beautiful, but stupid.

137
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:56,236
I thought one didn't get a hangover with champagne.

138
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:58,887
So did I.

139
00:39:00,395 --> 00:39:04,355
Now, if you got really lucky, you
could have an exceptional brain...

140
00:39:04,406 --> 00:39:07,135
...and you could be both extremely beautiful

141
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:09,174
and highly intelligent.

142
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,840
Like me.

143
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:14,569
Did you make all that up yourself
- Yeah.

144
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:18,343
You're beautiful.

145
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:20,949
Hey...

146
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:22,982
Are you calling me stupid?

147
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:24,259
No, no.

148
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:27,206
Wouldn't do that.

149
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:05,416
No maggots.

150
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:09,165
She was calling for help.

151
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,934
She was definitely alive after The Effect.

152
00:40:37,621 --> 00:40:39,141
Pull over.

153
00:40:46,516 --> 00:40:47,836
What's wrong?

154
00:40:49,605 --> 00:40:51,525
Does it look to you like the sun's pulsating?

155
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:56,101
No.

156
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,800
No. Doesn't to me, either.

157
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:19,861
Mr. and Mrs. Smith?

158
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:39,000
This one's yours.
- Thanks very much.

159
00:41:39,941 --> 00:41:43,300
If we find anyone alive,
what do you think we'll be like?

160
00:41:44,981 --> 00:41:47,221
We might find all manner of horrors.

161
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,959
Politicians.

162
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:54,620
Transvestites.

163
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:59,600
I think we should look in places where

164
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:02,430
people are either trapped
or too afraid to leave.

165
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,261
Mental hospitals, prisons.

166
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:06,590
That sort of thing.

167
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,520
Then let's hope we don't find anyone.

168
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,710
We have to look.

169
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,700
There you are.

170
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:39,101
Run out of words?

171
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,557
Where are we sleeping?
- I'm sleeping over there.

172
00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:49,649
Thought you might say that.

173
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,820
This one'll do. Keys are in it.

174
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,380
I still don't like it.

175
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,700
Don't be beautiful.

176
00:43:13,181 --> 00:43:16,221
It's simple: I'll cover that side
of the river, you cover this.

177
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,540
Call me every half hour.
- Yeah.

178
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,169
Zac, can you hear me?

179
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:48,141
Joanne, come in please.

180
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:52,767
Zac, I'm at the hospital.
Where are you?

181
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:55,245
I'm driving past the university.
Everything okay?

182
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:57,301
Yes. I'm just going in.

183
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:59,941
Okay. Call you in half an hour.

184
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:16,862
You there, Zac?

185
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:20,942
Hello. You okay?

186
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:24,860
I felt really strange a few
seconds ago. Where are you?

187
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,100
I'm at Mental Street and Hillcrest.
There's nothing here.

188
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,420
Is there anything at the university?

189
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:37,167
Not a thing.

190
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:39,964
Call you later.
But, keep in touch, though.

191
00:45:40,216 --> 00:45:42,736
Okay. Over and out.

192
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:01,450
Are you trying to tell me that you

193
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,811
and your white-coated cronies up the road there

194
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:06,261
really had something to do with this?

195
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:07,540
Don't know.

196
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:10,541
I was an American idea.

197
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,500
They were experimenting
with energy transmissions

198
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,200
through a grid surrounding the Earth.

199
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:18,660
Aircraft, drawing directly from that grid,

200
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,670
so they wouldn't have to refuel.

201
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,430
That sort of thing.

202
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:26,340
Of course. An exclusive all-male club

203
00:46:26,345 --> 00:46:28,270
playing God with the universe.

204
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:35,991
We were just one small unit in a whole
network of stations around the world.

205
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:39,780
Acting simultaneously. Besides...

206
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:44,461
We might not have been responsible.

207
00:46:45,021 --> 00:46:46,701
God may have just blinked.

208
00:46:46,982 --> 00:46:49,542
God blinked and the
whole world disappeared?

209
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:55,994
A world of noisy, brawling,

210
00:46:56,032 --> 00:46:58,232
wonderful human beings.

211
00:47:06,362 --> 00:47:08,330
God, I miss them.

212
00:47:19,061 --> 00:47:20,701
It's alright.

213
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:32,196
Hello?

214
00:47:32,228 --> 00:47:33,877
Dr. Hobson, this is reception.

215
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,110
I suppose you realize you must
vacate your room by 10 o'clock.

216
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:40,602
And, are you aware there is an extra
charge for your guest last night?

217
00:47:40,636 --> 00:47:42,556
Didn't realize I had to pay for it.

218
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:48,500
You don't get anything for nothing, you know?
- Come back to bed.

219
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:55,221
Thank you.
- Anything else, sir?

220
00:47:56,704 --> 00:47:59,424
More crumpet?
- Sorry, love, crumpet's off.

221
00:48:17,941 --> 00:48:20,701
See you 1 o'clock in the plaza.
- Okay, then we head south.

222
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,069
We go back.
- We'll discuss that at lunch.

223
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:15,450
There are a number of constants

224
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,070
which have never been known to
change in the history of science.

225
00:49:19,149 --> 00:49:21,629
One of these is the unit
charge of an electron.

226
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:25,425
In an experiment I have just conducted

227
00:49:25,455 --> 00:49:28,270
I have established that
this charge has changed

228
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:32,110
and, in fact, is oscillating
between two new values.

229
00:49:33,381 --> 00:49:34,669
I cannot to measure these values,

230
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:38,887
as it seems the amplitude of
the oscillation is increasing.

231
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:47,421
I can only conclude that
the fabric of the universe

232
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,910
has not only altered,
but is highly unstable.

233
00:49:56,298 --> 00:49:58,150
God knows where that leaves us.

234
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,695
Hello, mon cher.

235
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:06,809
Joanne, is that you?
- You mean there is someone else?

236
00:50:07,362 --> 00:50:10,922
Hey, you know you're the only girl
in the world for me, sweetheart.

237
00:50:11,197 --> 00:50:12,437
Okay.

238
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:17,072
Au revoir, cheri.
- I'm on me way.

239
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:05,200
Freeze, mister!

240
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,905
You alone?

241
00:52:17,941 --> 00:52:19,101
You seen anyone else?

242
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:23,496
Up against the truck.

243
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,594
Turn around.

244
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,700
Zac, are you there?

245
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:57,861
Zac?

246
00:53:03,118 --> 00:53:04,878
What's holding you up?

247
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:23,615
You tell lies.
- No, well, what would you have done?

248
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,410
How many of you?
- Just her and me.

249
00:53:27,924 --> 00:53:29,644
Two of yous?

250
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:35,717
Switch it off and cruise.

251
00:53:55,725 --> 00:53:57,045
Look...
- Come on!

252
00:54:04,593 --> 00:54:06,673
She's not there.
- You'll find her.

253
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:30,487
Zac, where've you been?

254
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,917
Why didn't you answer me?
- This bloody radio.

255
00:54:36,269 --> 00:54:39,149
I thought I was gonna be alone again.

256
00:55:25,161 --> 00:55:26,801
Good.

257
00:55:40,499 --> 00:55:42,099
Hide the bottle. It's a cop.

258
00:55:43,735 --> 00:55:45,815
Straight face, please.

259
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:23,206
Fish. Fish in that stream.
- Baby ones.

260
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,520
Yeah, that makes sense. The fish
eggs settle on the river bed.

261
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:28,922
The male fish swims along
dropping sperm on them.

262
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:32,472
So, if the sperm was released before
The Effect, and penetrated after...

263
00:56:33,186 --> 00:56:35,426
...there's be fish.

264
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:41,861
For awhile there, I thought I was dead.
- He thought he was God.

265
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:50,064
Why did you think you were dead?
- Cause I was.

266
00:56:51,946 --> 00:56:56,626
I was in the bush down south with a mate.
Well, sort of mate.

267
00:57:10,513 --> 00:57:14,073
As I began to go unconscious,
I could see it all happening.

268
00:57:15,555 --> 00:57:17,955
I was watching from high up.

269
00:57:18,716 --> 00:57:21,116
I could see him, and I could see myself.

270
00:57:22,077 --> 00:57:24,797
It was really peaceful.

271
00:57:24,827 --> 00:57:26,827
Like a weight'd been lifted off.

272
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:37,401
There was another thing.
Like a light a long way off.

273
00:57:38,643 --> 00:57:41,763
I was traveling towards it
Yearning to reach it.

274
00:57:42,044 --> 00:57:44,804
Suddenly, I felt the whole weight
of life crash back on me.

275
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,366
I was so disappointed.

276
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:53,047
You felt that, if you could reach that light,
you'd never want to come back again.

277
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:05,533
Happened to me.

278
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:10,900
The same.
- The moment of death.

279
00:58:10,895 --> 00:58:14,735
The effect happened at the exact moment
of death and that's why we survived.

280
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:19,600
Is that what you think?
- I reckon.

281
00:58:19,698 --> 00:58:23,938
For awhile there I didn't know what I was.
And when I found I was alone in this world...

282
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,140
I thought I was a ghost.

283
00:58:29,262 --> 00:58:30,782
It was really sad.

284
00:58:32,663 --> 00:58:37,223
I reckoned if I was here and alive,
I'd better head north to look for survivors.

285
00:58:38,145 --> 00:58:41,705
And if I was a spirit, I thought
I'd better head for Cape Reinga.

286
00:58:42,907 --> 00:58:44,787
Either way, I was heading
in the right direction.

287
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,228
So there's just the three of us.

288
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:55,190
Well, you're alive and so am I.

289
00:58:55,472 --> 00:58:57,152
How about you?

290
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:07,795
I suppose so.

291
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:25,882
What do you think of him?
- He plays the odd bum note.

292
00:59:25,912 --> 00:59:27,800
Oh, come on.

293
00:59:27,884 --> 00:59:30,484
Nah, I think he's great.

294
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:35,685
See you made the beds.
- Mmhm. One...two.

295
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:40,368
It's ironic.

296
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:45,168
Of all of us, I thought I'd be the
one most equipped to handle

297
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,050
Whatever it is that's happened.

298
00:59:48,571 --> 00:59:50,771
I used to enjoy being a loner.

299
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:55,053
And then you came along.

300
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:05,776
I'm thinking about the three of us now.
Not just you and not just me.

301
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,272
Hey Api, play us another
song which we can sing.

302
01:00:16,302 --> 01:00:17,702
Okay.

303
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:22,582
Let auld acquaintance be forgot,

304
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:27,676
and never brought to mind

305
01:00:27,706 --> 01:00:32,346
Let auld acquaintance be forgot,

306
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:37,600
for the sake of auld lang syne

307
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:53,193
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet,

308
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:59,235
for the sake of auld lang syne

309
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,360
If the oscillations in the sun continue
to increase at the present rate

310
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,599
the sun must collapse in a few
days, taking everything with it.

311
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:06,020
Computer analysis is needed immediately
for a more accurate prediction.

312
01:03:09,106 --> 01:03:13,286
You know, the interesting thing about
friendships is, is that they're not logical.

313
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:14,450
You know how some people
will come up to you

314
01:03:14,445 --> 01:03:16,445
and they'll ask you why
do you like so and so,

315
01:03:16,368 --> 01:03:18,368
and you'll give them all these
interesting reasons why you do,

316
01:03:18,489 --> 01:03:21,489
but you've actually made them up
after you've decided you like them.

317
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,650
I reckon you decide you like somebody

318
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:26,020
in the two seconds you meet them.
You stick to it regardless.

319
01:03:26,212 --> 01:03:30,292
So, if you like them, you're gonna find
good things in all the bad things they do.

320
01:03:30,453 --> 01:03:33,293
And if you don't, you're gonna find bad
things in all the good things they do.

321
01:03:34,315 --> 01:03:37,795
The other thing is, you tend
to like people who like you.

322
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:40,256
And what did you decide about me?

323
01:03:41,578 --> 01:03:43,138
Guess you like me.

324
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,400
Why was your mate trying
to kill you?

325
01:03:49,821 --> 01:03:54,341
Cause I killed his wife.
- Killed his wife? Why?

326
01:03:54,773 --> 01:03:56,093
It was necessary.

327
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:00,825
Necessary.

328
01:04:00,863 --> 01:04:03,343
And who decides when
it'll be necessary?

329
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:07,718
And when'll be the next time
that you decide it's necessary?

330
01:04:10,668 --> 01:04:13,908
Who the hell do you
think you are? God?

331
01:04:20,173 --> 01:04:21,733
You're not God.

332
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:46,560
Joanne, look, something
really strange is happening.

333
01:04:46,565 --> 01:04:48,565
I don't quite understand
it, but we're gonna...

334
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,500
What's the matter?
- Leave me alone, please.

335
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,420
What's happened?

336
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:03,380
Look, I got something
really important to tell ya.

337
01:05:03,385 --> 01:05:05,430
We went through all
that shit last night.

338
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:08,822
I'm not talking about last night,
I'm talking about the sun!

339
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:14,176
You wanna talk about the sun?
Go and talk to that God out there.

340
01:05:14,968 --> 01:05:16,400
Listen to me!

341
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:21,562
Take your hands off me.
- What are you doing?

342
01:05:27,907 --> 01:05:29,267
Api...

343
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,500
How soon can you get your gear
together? We've gotta head up north.

344
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:36,505
But you just got here?

345
01:05:35,536 --> 01:05:38,616
Yeah, I know. But please,
mate, how quickly?

346
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:41,196
My place not good enough for you?
- No, no. It's not that.

347
01:05:41,326 --> 01:05:45,486
Look, I'll explain it along the way, okay?
- Are you in charge here?

348
01:05:47,297 --> 01:05:50,901
Okay. Yeah, if that's the way
you want it, yes I am. Yes.

349
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:53,151
She came back crying.
What did you do to her?

350
01:05:53,188 --> 01:05:55,708
What will you do?
- I'm in charge, remember?

351
01:05:56,103 --> 01:05:59,263
Joanne, get your ass into gear.
We're leaving straight away.

352
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,856
Listen, honky, haven't you noticed?
Things have changed around here.

353
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:07,670
The white boss went with the rest of
them. There's just you and me now.

354
01:06:08,224 --> 01:06:10,500
Look, it's complicated enough
for people like me

355
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:12,400
without trying to explain
to people like you.

356
01:06:12,957 --> 01:06:15,397
People like what?
- Will you listen to that!

357
01:06:21,284 --> 01:06:23,844
Okay. If that's the way you want it.

358
01:06:36,321 --> 01:06:37,350
You coming?

359
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:39,998
I wouldn't ride with you if
you were the last man on Earth.

360
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:42,513
I'm working on it.

361
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:12,670
It would seem that Domingo's
Operation Flashlight is still intact.

362
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:15,703
Self-energizing from the
entire balanced grid.

363
01:07:16,218 --> 01:07:18,778
And this is somehow
affecting the Sun.

364
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:55,638
You!

365
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:01,700
If you don't stop, I'll shoot.
And I don't care which one.

366
01:08:02,107 --> 01:08:04,100
I'm not going to live with two
of you at each other's throats

367
01:08:04,105 --> 01:08:06,105
trying to prove which one is God.

368
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:09,610
If you don't believe me, try it.

369
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,520
You don't trust -

370
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,620
For Christ's sake!

371
01:08:13,249 --> 01:08:16,660
Look, that bloody thing's been
worrying me for over a year now.

372
01:08:17,183 --> 01:08:19,250
I knew there was something
wrong with that project.

373
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,200
And I said nothing.

374
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:23,477
Can you be more guilty than that?

375
01:08:24,221 --> 01:08:25,641
You condemned yourself to death.

376
01:08:26,748 --> 01:08:30,428
On the morning of The Effect,
you were trying to kill yourself.

377
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:38,094
What you gonna do about it?
- Don't know.

378
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,820
You trying to tell me you
jokers caused all this

379
01:08:41,825 --> 01:08:43,100
and you can't even fix it?

380
01:08:43,682 --> 01:08:47,162
Well, we never did know the full story.
The Americans withheld information.

381
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,380
Are you monkeying
with the universe

382
01:08:50,385 --> 01:08:52,385
without even knowing
what you're doing?

383
01:08:54,785 --> 01:08:57,510
Nobody realized what
was happening.

384
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,260
We trusted them.
They were on our side.

385
01:09:01,334 --> 01:09:02,740
You can't be that dumb.

386
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:05,200
They might as well tell the
Russians as tell you jokers.

387
01:09:05,215 --> 01:09:09,139
Besides: They don't tell you,
you don't tell us...

388
01:09:08,723 --> 01:09:10,563
You're all the same to me.

389
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,419
Well, I've told you now.

390
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:16,233
You tell lies.

391
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,450
Try it again.

392
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:32,300
Same result.
- Those two lines that meet.

393
01:09:32,305 --> 01:09:33,305
What do they mean?

394
01:09:34,523 --> 01:09:38,167
It's a time scale. That's the
point of maximum instability.

395
01:09:38,197 --> 01:09:39,997
About 6 o'clock tomorrow morning.

396
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,680
What happens then?

397
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:46,470
Well, I think it's The Effect.
It's gonna happen again.

398
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,300
Zac?

399
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:56,741
Joanne?

400
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:58,821
Api?

401
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:00,400
Hey!

402
01:10:03,021 --> 01:10:04,100
Yeah?

403
01:10:04,741 --> 01:10:06,100
Zac?

404
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:08,100
Api?

405
01:10:09,301 --> 01:10:11,301
Where are you?

406
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:16,461
Api!

407
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:20,861
Zac?

408
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:24,600
Api.

409
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,400
Joanne? Where are you?

410
01:10:30,395 --> 01:10:32,595
Joanne!
- I 'm here.

411
01:10:47,649 --> 01:10:49,049
You okay?

412
01:10:58,072 --> 01:11:00,792
Your calculations are wrong.
It's too soon.

413
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:04,467
No. That was just a tremor.

414
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,741
Next time that happens,
it'll be the real thing.

415
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:10,097
Your calculations are
a waste of time.

416
01:11:10,373 --> 01:11:11,940
You reckon the grid is ballast?

417
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:15,950
Okay. We take the sand out,
the grid collapses.

418
01:11:21,995 --> 01:11:23,515
Didn't work.

419
01:11:32,578 --> 01:11:35,098
Neat, eh?
- He's an artist.

420
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,900
Are you sure there's enough?

421
01:11:45,678 --> 01:11:47,438
How much you reckon we need?

422
01:11:47,795 --> 01:11:49,275
A ton?

423
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:51,800
We take a truckload.

424
01:11:52,148 --> 01:11:57,068
So, Perrin throws the switch, The Effect
happens, and everyone disappears.

425
01:11:57,979 --> 01:12:03,219
But our little effect is happening
again tomorrow morning.

426
01:12:04,049 --> 01:12:07,214
Now there's no Perrin, no switch.

427
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:10,524
So maybe The Effect and the
grid are totally unrelated.

428
01:12:11,438 --> 01:12:13,764
You mean like that boy with the stick?
- Ay?

429
01:12:13,794 --> 01:12:15,154
The boy with the stick.

430
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:17,872
Remember that massive power
blackout in the States?

431
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,587
The whole east coast was
out for about 6 hours.

432
01:12:21,023 --> 01:12:23,140
They reckon this boy
was on his way home.

433
01:12:23,345 --> 01:12:25,100
He was pissed off
about something.

434
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,735
And he whacked this power
pole with all of his might.

435
01:12:28,132 --> 01:12:30,772
And, at that instant,
his whole world went black.

436
01:12:31,566 --> 01:12:34,446
And he thought he had done it.
What do you reckon?

437
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,000
Well, I reckon The Effect was a
cosmic event, like the creation.

438
01:12:39,518 --> 01:12:41,598
And nobody has ever
explained that properly.

439
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:46,020
On the other hand, perhaps
nobody disappeared. Only me.

440
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,060
I am The Effect.

441
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:51,950
And us?
- You're not real. You're in my mind.

442
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:54,031
You're God.

443
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:57,439
I actually do think it's the grid.
Besides, it's our best bet.

444
01:12:57,469 --> 01:12:59,509
So I'll get the other truck.

445
01:13:00,907 --> 01:13:02,460
We're not real.

446
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,100
You were born under the
shadow of Pirongia.

447
01:13:05,705 --> 01:13:07,634
Down that way...

448
01:13:07,664 --> 01:13:10,904
Patupaiarehe. The red-haired
people of the night.

449
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,580
Maybe you're not real.

450
01:13:18,858 --> 01:13:20,778
Real enough.

451
01:13:49,702 --> 01:13:53,510
Oh well. I suppose, if this works,
we all live happily ever after.

452
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,280
Don't we?
- Hopefully.

453
01:13:57,159 --> 01:13:59,599
All three of us?
- We have to.

454
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:03,317
It's easier for me because
I like both of you.

455
01:14:05,115 --> 01:14:06,875
But you do prefer him...

456
01:14:12,751 --> 01:14:14,951
I get a really strange
notion sometimes.

457
01:14:16,629 --> 01:14:18,600
Sometimes I feel
as if you and Api

458
01:14:18,605 --> 01:14:20,605
have known each other
a long, long time.

459
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:26,554
As though I'm the victim
of some huge conspiracy.

460
01:14:26,584 --> 01:14:29,104
And you and Api have been
sent to be my guardians.

461
01:14:31,821 --> 01:14:34,150
I feel as though you
pass secret messages

462
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,020
when I'm not looking.

463
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,740
Perhaps we do.

464
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:39,770
There's some pretty
odd things about Api.

465
01:14:41,816 --> 01:14:44,816
Are you worried about why his
mate was trying to kill him?

466
01:14:44,974 --> 01:14:46,494
Yeah.

467
01:14:46,614 --> 01:14:48,134
He killed his mate's wife.

468
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:53,150
She was in love with him
and he rejected her.

469
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,600
So she committed suicide.

470
01:14:56,728 --> 01:15:00,728
And he felt he was responsible.
So did his mate.

471
01:15:03,605 --> 01:15:05,565
That's really sad.

472
01:15:08,682 --> 01:15:11,811
The things I've learned
about people...

473
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,521
...in the last few weeks.

474
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:17,159
You needn't worry about me.

475
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:20,318
Whatever happens,
I can handle it.

476
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:26,234
Look out!

477
01:15:30,751 --> 01:15:33,751
Api! I knew there was something
I forgot to tell him.

478
01:15:47,303 --> 01:15:49,423
What do you reckon?
- Blow it up?

479
01:15:50,221 --> 01:15:51,861
I'll push it out of the way.

480
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,540
Hey, Api?

481
01:15:57,188 --> 01:15:59,188
Be careful.
- No sweat.

482
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:44,066
He's going an awfully
long way back.

483
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:49,759
Surely he's not...
- No.

484
01:16:58,729 --> 01:16:59,809
He is!

485
01:17:07,893 --> 01:17:10,493
Anybody coming?
- See ya.

486
01:17:46,152 --> 01:17:47,952
Api. You read me?

487
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,687
Api. Come it, Api.

488
01:18:18,536 --> 01:18:22,200
Here comes the boss.
- Answer your bloody radio, Api!

489
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:25,847
Give him a bit of a squeeze, eh?
- What the hell are you doing?

490
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,827
We can't go any closer.
- Why?

491
01:18:59,857 --> 01:19:01,860
The lab's so hot with ionization,

492
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:03,890
it'd be like walking
into a microwave oven.

493
01:19:03,692 --> 01:19:05,452
Are we safe enough here?

494
01:19:05,968 --> 01:19:06,928
It's about a mile away.

495
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:12,405
Looks like we didn't bring enough.
- Shall we take a look?

496
01:19:28,737 --> 01:19:32,217
The lights are still on.
- Yeah.
Are supplied by the network.

497
01:19:36,966 --> 01:19:39,846
We'll know whether the grid's
collapsed. The lights will go out.

498
01:19:40,082 --> 01:19:42,282
If we ever get the
truck in there at all.

499
01:19:43,337 --> 01:19:45,297
Who's gonna take it in?

500
01:19:46,153 --> 01:19:48,193
I got something back in the
city that could do this job.

501
01:19:48,311 --> 01:19:51,911
It's a radio control unit. I've
used it on a lawn mower.

502
01:19:53,024 --> 01:19:54,784
Will it work on a truck that size?

503
01:19:55,521 --> 01:19:57,681
We can adapt it.
- Have we got time?

504
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:00,959
Think so.

505
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:05,530
If I leave now, I'll be
back in two hours.

506
01:20:18,566 --> 01:20:20,566
Like me to come with you?

507
01:20:21,378 --> 01:20:24,098
Best you stay.
- Okay.

508
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,020
What do you think will happen?

509
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,620
He will try with
the radio device.

510
01:21:55,861 --> 01:21:58,100
Probably won't work
on a truck that size.

511
01:22:01,559 --> 01:22:02,879
So I'll drive it in.

512
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:08,601
Why you?
- Cause I'm the driver.

513
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:12,839
Anyway, it is easier for me.

514
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,360
My old kuia's looking after me.

515
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,200
What's that?
- It's the truck!

516
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,240
How long's it been?

517
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:32,567
About 20 minutes.
- He can't have gone at all.

518
01:22:45,821 --> 01:22:47,181
He tells lies!

519
01:23:47,421 --> 01:23:49,500
It's started.
- Zac?
