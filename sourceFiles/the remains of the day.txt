1
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,980
<i>Dear Mr. Stevens:</i>

2
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,270
<i>You will be surprised to hear
from me after all this time.</i>

3
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,360
<i>You've been in my thoughts since
I heard Lord Darlington had died.</i>

4
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,090
<i>We read that his heirs
put Darlington Hall up for sale...</i>

5
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,700
<i>...as they no longer wished
to maintain it.</i>

6
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,490
<i>As no one would buy
such a large house...</i>

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,600
<i>...the new earl decided to demolish
it and sell the stone for 5000 pounds.</i>

8
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,890
<i>We also saw some rubbish in the
Daily Mail which made my blood boil:</i>

9
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,890
<i>"Traitor's nest to be pulled down. "</i>

10
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,310
One hundred and eighty guineas?

11
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,670
One hundred and eighty?
Have we done?

12
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
a great highlight of the sale:

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Lot 414...

14
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,230
<i>...the fine Elizabethan portrait,
A Portly Gentleman.</i>

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,780
I'll start the bidding
at 2000 guineas.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,940
2000 guineas, thank you.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,150
2200.

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,580
2400.

19
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,180
2600.

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,750
2800.

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,540
3000. 3200.

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
3400. 3600.

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
3800.

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,130
4000 guineas.
Four and a half thousand.

25
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,400
5000.

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,140
And a half.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,670
6000.

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,030
And a half.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
7000.

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,600
And a half.

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,330
8000.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,670
And a half.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,750
9000.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,150
And a half.

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,050
10,000 guineas is bid.

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
And a half.

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,550
11,000.

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,790
And a half.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,080
Against you, sir,
at eleven and a half thousand guineas.

40
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,720
All done at
eleven and a half thousand guineas.

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,490
<i>I was very relieved to read
how an American millionaire...</i>

42
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,720
<i>...named Lewis saved
Darlington Hall...</i>

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
<i>...so you wouldn't be turned out
of your home after all.</i>

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,110
<i>Is it the same Congressman Lewis...</i>

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,040
<i>...who attended His Lordship's
conference in 1936?</i>

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,530
<i>Mr. Stevens, I so often think
of the good old days...</i>

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,290
<i>...when I was the housekeeper.</i>

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,480
<i>It was hard work...</i>

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,970
<i>...and I have known butlers easier
to please than our Mr. Stevens...</i>

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,120
<i>...but those years with you were
among the happiest of my life.</i>

51
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,940
<i>You must have a completely
different staff now.</i>

52
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,340
<i>Not many of the old faces
around anymore.</i>

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,080
<i>There's not much need
for the small army of footmen...</i>

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,850
<i>...that Lord Darlington employed.</i>

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>My own news is not very cheerful.</i>

56
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,270
<i>In the 7 years since I last wrote,
I have again left my husband...</i>

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,860
<i>...and, sad to say,
my marriage seems to be over.</i>

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,880
<i>I'm staying at a friend's
boarding house in Clevedon.</i>

59
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,620
<i>I don't know what my future is.</i>

60
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,370
<i>Since Catherine, my daughter, got
married, my life has been empty.</i>

61
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,440
<i>The years stretch before me and
if only I knew how to fill them.</i>

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,530
<i>But I would like to be useful again.</i>

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,840
- Burned again?
- Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,130
The rule in the kitchen
has always been...

65
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,000
...cook cooks the cooked breakfast
while her assistant toasts the toast.

66
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,730
Why don't we get her a pop-up toaster?

67
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,830
We need not a new gadget
but a revised staff plan, sir.

68
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,320
A staff plan, huh?
I didn't know we had one.

69
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,290
A faulty one, unfortunately.

70
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,620
Sir, quite recently...

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,660
...you were kind enough to suggest
that I go on a little holiday trip...

72
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,880
...around the country.

73
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,770
Absolutely. Certainly, take a break.
See the world.

74
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,030
Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,260
When did you last see the world?

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,480
The world always used to come
to this house, if I may say so.

77
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,180
You may say so.

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,930
Take off when I'm in London next week.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,720
I tell you what, you take the car.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,530
- Take the Daimler.
- Good Lord, sir, I couldn't.

81
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,140
You and that Daimler belong together.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
You were made for each other.

83
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,380
That's most kind of you,
I must say, sir. Most kind.

84
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,640
I'd meant to travel the West, where I
understand we have splendid scenery.

85
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,260
And I might incidentally be able
to solve our problems while I'm there.

86
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,200
A former housekeeper, at present
living in Clevedon, has indicated...

87
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,090
...that she might be prepared
to return to service.

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,120
What's this, your girlfriend?

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,730
Or a former attachment?

90
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,770
Oh, no, sir.

91
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,320
No, but a very able housekeeper.

92
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,630
A most able housekeeper.

93
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,510
I was just kidding, Stevens.

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,630
Sorry.

95
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,490
You know what I like best
about your papers?

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,420
These obituaries.

97
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,680
Every son of a gun gets
this stately funeral oration.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,910
- It's not an art we have in the States.
- Indeed, sir.

99
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,930
Thank you, Stevens.

100
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,550
Mr. Lewis.

101
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,420
<i>Dear Mrs. Benn...</i>

102
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,940
<i>...I propose to reach Clevedon
on October 3rd around 4 p. m.</i>

103
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,160
<i>I'd be grateful for a line from you...</i>

104
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,460
<i>...to reach me at the post office
at Collingbourne, near Hungerford...</i>

105
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,710
<i>...where I'm planning to stop.</i>

106
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,710
<i>Mrs. Benn, I always said you
possess an amazing memory.</i>

107
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,870
<i>Our new employer is indeed
Congressman Lewis...</i>

108
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,030
<i>...though he's now retired
from political life in the U.S.</i>

109
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,050
<i>He's taken up residence at Darlington
Hall, soon to be joined by his family.</i>

110
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,920
<i>But I regret to say we are woefully
understaffed for a house this size.</i>

111
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,270
<i>Mrs. Benn, will you permit me
once again to sing your praises?</i>

112
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,090
<i>Let me state that when you left
to get married...</i>

113
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,150
<i>...no housekeeper ever reached
your high standard in any department.</i>

114
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,080
<i>I well remember your arrival
at Darlington Hall.</i>

115
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,070
<i>You came somewhat unexpectedly,
one might even say impulsively...</i>

116
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,460
<i>...while we were dead in the middle
of the Charlgrove meet.</i>

117
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,660
<i>That day is marked in my
memory in another way as well.</i>

118
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,760
<i>It was the last time His Lordship...</i>

119
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,060
<i>...was happy to welcome
his neighbours, as in the old days.</i>

120
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,030
<i>Of course, it had been years since
any of them had coaxed him to hunt.</i>

121
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,720
<i>It was never a sport His Lordship
enjoyed or approved of.</i>

122
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,530
- Good morning, Ayres.
- My lord, nice to see you.

123
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,020
Excuse me, sir.

124
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,400
<i>I fear I may have been a little
unwelcoming, even a little short.</i>

125
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,520
<i>You presented the best references
I've ever seen.</i>

126
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,930
<i>Which proved to be well-deserved.</i>

127
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,830
<i>Though, I confess, I did have my
doubts, on account of your youth.</i>

128
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,530
No gentleman callers allowed,
of course.

129
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,290
Forgive my mentioning it, but we've
had those problems before.

130
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,240
Inside the house too.

131
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,150
The previous housekeeper ran off
with the under-butler.

132
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,080
If two staff members decide to get
married, one can say nothing.

133
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,500
What I find a major irritation...

134
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,460
...are those persons who go from
post to post looking for romance.

135
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,240
Housekeepers are particularly
guilty here.

136
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,920
- No offense intended, of course.
- None taken.

137
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,340
I know how a house is at sixes and
sevens once the staff start marrying.

138
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,020
Yes, indeed.

139
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,010
- Might I have a word, sir?
- Of course.

140
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,080
My lord, it's regarding
the under-butler...

141
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,460
...and the housekeeper
who ran off last month.

142
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,860
Bad business.
How are you managing?

143
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,490
I've found two
first-rate replacements.

144
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,400
Miss Kenton, a young woman
with excellent references.

145
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,310
Very pleasing demeanour.
Appears to be very able.

146
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,730
And a man with
considerable experience.

147
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,610
- Older and happy to be under-butler.
- Name?

148
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,790
Stevens, sir.

149
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,750
- Stevens?
- Yes, sir.

150
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,410
- That's your name.
- He's my father, sir.

151
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,340
Really?

152
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,480
Couldn't do better.
I'd like to see him sometime.

153
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,860
He's outside the door.

154
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,800
Good. Bring him in.

155
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,410
Thank you, my lord.

156
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,230
Father.

157
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,910
Mr. Stevens, how do you do?

158
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,560
- My lord.
- Very good man here, your son.

159
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,540
He serves the house well.
I don't know what we'd do without him.

160
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,010
- Proud of him?
- Very, my lord.

161
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,730
Quite right too.

162
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,770
Glad to have you with us.

163
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,140
Thank you, my lord.

164
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,350
What are we at dinner tonight?
14? 16?

165
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,690
Twelve, sir.

166
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,710
Right.

167
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,220
Thank you, my lord.

168
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,800
- This pitcher seems out of place here.
- Dining room. Well spotted.

169
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,850
- Hello, William, how are you?
- Good day, Miss Kenton.

170
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,710
I thought these might
brighten your parlour.

171
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,170
Beg your pardon?

172
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,410
They might cheer things up for you.

173
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,350
That's very kind of you.

174
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,680
If you like, I could bring in
some more for you.

175
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,250
Thank you...

176
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,240
...but I regard this room
as my private place of work...

177
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,300
...and I prefer to keep distractions
to a minimum.

178
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,270
Would you call flowers
a distraction, then?

179
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,760
I appreciate your kindness.
I prefer to keep things as they are.

180
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,330
But since you are here, there is a
small matter I wanted to mention.

181
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,040
I happened to be walking past
the kitchen yesterday morning...

182
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,880
...and I heard you call
to someone named William.

183
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,250
May I ask who you were
addressing by that name?

184
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,230
I should think I was
addressing your father.

185
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,330
There are no other Williams
in this house.

186
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,460
True.

187
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,990
May I ask you in future to address
my father as Mr. Stevens?

188
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,500
If speaking of him
to a third party, you may call him...

189
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,200
...Mr. Stevens Sr.
to distinguish him from myself.

190
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,030
So I would be most grateful to you,
Miss Kenton.

191
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,680
I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

192
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,630
I am the housekeeper in this house,
and your father is the under-butler.

193
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,120
I am accustomed to addressing under-
servants by their Christian names.

194
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,460
If you would stop to think for a moment,
you'd realize...

195
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,540
...how inappropriate it is for one such
as yourself to address as William...

196
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,080
...someone such as my father.

197
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,200
It must have been very galling for
your father to be called William...

198
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,500
...by one such as myself.

199
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,920
My father is a person from whom...

200
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,180
...if you'd observe him more,
you may learn things.

201
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,990
I'm grateful for your advice,
but do tell me...

202
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,250
...what things might I learn from him?

203
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,540
I might point out that you're...

204
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,350
...often unsure of what goes where
and which item is which.

205
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm sure Mr. Stevens Sr.
is very good at his job...

206
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,250
...but I can assure you
that I'm very good at mine.

207
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,610
- Of course.
- Thank you.

208
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,700
If you will please excuse me.

209
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,140
Oh, well.

210
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,090
My compliments to cook.

211
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,380
What a lovely piece of crackling.

212
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm sure you said something witty.
Share it with the rest of us.

213
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,410
I said the sprouts is done the way
I like them. Crisp-like, not mushy.

214
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,810
Sprouts "are" done, not " is" done.

215
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
Isn't that right, George?

216
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,660
Yes, Mr. Stevens.

217
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,420
Forgive the correction,
as I would have done...

218
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,270
...at your age for the sake
of my education.

219
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,690
I'm sure even you have ambitions
to rise in your profession.

220
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,660
Oh, yes. I want to be
a butler, to be called Mister...

221
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,700
...sit in my own pantry by my own fire,
smoking my cigar.

222
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,240
I wonder if you realize what it takes
to be a great butler?

223
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,840
Takes dignity, that's what it takes.

224
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,020
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
Dignity, that's right. Dignity.

225
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,560
<i>The definition from our quarterly
The Gentlemen's Gentleman:</i>

226
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,200
A great butler must be possessed
of dignity-

227
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,500
In keeping with his position.

228
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,490
There was this English butler
in India.

229
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,750
One day, he goes in the dining room
and what's under the table?

230
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,060
A tiger.

231
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,480
Not turning a hair,
he goes to the drawing room.

232
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,560
" Excuse me, my lord," and whispering,
so as not to upset the ladies:

233
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,560
" I'm sorry. There appears to
be a tiger in the dining room.

234
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,060
Perhaps His Lordship will permit
use of the twelve-bores?"

235
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,990
They go on drinking their tea.
And then, there's three gunshots.

236
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,800
They don't think nothing of it.
In India, they're used to anything.

237
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,680
When the butler is back
to refresh the teapots...

238
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,370
...he says, cool as a cucumber:

239
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,730
" Dinner will be served
at the usual time, my lord.

240
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,130
And I am pleased to say there will
be no discernible traces left...

241
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,640
...of the recent occurrence
by that time. "

242
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,230
I'll repeat it. "There will be
no discernible traces left...

243
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,110
...of the recent occurrence
by that time. "

244
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,000
- Wonderful, Mr. Stevens.
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

245
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,750
Wonderful story. That's the ideal
that we should all aim for. Dignity.

246
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,930
For you, Mr. Stevens.

247
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,500
Thank you.

248
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,150
It's for Mr. Stevens Sr.,
Mr. Stevens.

249
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,580
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

250
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,650
Put Mr. Stevens Sr.'s plate
with cook to keep it warm.

251
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,080
Yes, Miss Kenton.

252
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,740
Thank you.

253
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,700
Not at all, Mr. Stevens.

254
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,080
If you're searching for your dustpan,
it is out on the landing.

255
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,370
My dustpan?

256
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,870
You've left it on the landing.

257
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,940
- I haven't used a dustpan.
- Really? It must be somebody else.

258
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,360
- I don't follow you.
- My mistake, no doubt. One of many.

259
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,040
Morning, sir.

260
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,280
I've invited Giscard Dupont D'Ivry
as the French delegate.

261
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,110
He'll never come!

262
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,790
I just had word of his acceptance.

263
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,770
Dupont is fanatically anti-German.
His speech in Geneva in '33...

264
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,710
...made me ashamed to be
an ally of the French.

265
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,580
It's not the English way.

266
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,810
No, it is not.

267
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,200
This is the purpose of our conference,
to discuss these matters informally...

268
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,380
...far from the to-do
of an international conference...

269
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,770
...in the friendly and relaxed...

270
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,870
...atmosphere of one's home.

271
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,780
We may bring round the French
to our point of view.

272
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,940
And that of the Germans.

273
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,310
I'm sorry to interrupt, but how can we
associate with the Germans?

274
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,460
With the Nazi Party! They have torn
up and trampled every treaty...

275
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,990
...and are a growing threat to Europe,
not to mention a brutal dictatorship.

276
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,170
My dear boy, when I was in Berlin,
I saw at last a happy German people...

277
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,800
...with jobs, bread, pride in their
country and love of their leader.

278
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,970
And what about the Jews?

279
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,850
Did His Lordship wish to exchange
the Chinaman in the cabinet room...

280
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,900
...with the one outside the door?

281
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,790
- Chinaman?
- Yes.

282
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,080
The Chinaman from the cabinet room is
outside this door. See for yourself.

283
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,350
I'm busy at the moment.

284
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,360
Just pop your head outside this door
and see for yourself.

285
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,410
- I'll look into the matter later.
- You think it's a fantasy?

286
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,420
A fantasy on my part
due to my inexperience?

287
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,030
I'm busy in this room, Miss Kenton.

288
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,520
I shall wait.

289
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,680
Outside.

290
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:37,780
Look!

291
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,690
- Is that not the wrong Chinaman?
- I am very busy.

292
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,190
Have you nothing better to do
than stand around?

293
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,490
Look at it and tell me the truth.

294
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,680
Keep your voice down.
What would the other servants think...

295
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,120
...of us shouting about a Chinaman?

296
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,100
And I would ask you...

297
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,820
...to turn around
and look at the Chinaman.

298
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,030
It is a small mistake.

299
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,430
Your father is entrusted with more
than he can cope with.

300
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,990
Let me pass.

301
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,890
Your father left the dustpan
on the floor.

302
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,890
He left polish on the cutlery
and confused the Chinaman.

303
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,510
Recognize this before he commits
a major error!

304
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,220
- You can't talk to me like this.
- I'm afraid I must.

305
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,790
I'm giving you serious advice.

306
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,130
Your father should be relieved of a
number of his duties for his own good.

307
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,510
Whatever he once was, he no longer
has the same ability or strength.

308
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,710
I thank you for your advice.

309
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,880
Perhaps now I can go about
my business.

310
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,620
I never meant to keep you
from your business.

311
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,430
Thank you.

312
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,650
It's vital that we've agreed a common
policy before the arrival of...

313
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,020
- ... your Frenchman. What's his name?
- Giscard Dupont D'Ivry.

314
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,590
We also expect the
American delegate...

315
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,650
...Congressman Lewis,
to arrive on the same day.

316
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,710
Who is he, this American?

317
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,740
He's an unknown quantity. A young
congressman from Pennsylvania.

318
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,300
Sits on some sort of powerful
Foreign Affairs Committee.

319
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,910
Heir to one of those
American fortunes.

320
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,130
- Meatpacking?
- Trolley cars?

321
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,980
Or dry goods?

322
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,090
What are dry goods?

323
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,860
Something that Americans make
a lot of money in.

324
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,310
No, I think Mr. Lewis' fortune
comes from cosmetics, actually.

325
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,120
It's old Mr. Stevens!

326
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,710
Get a cushion, quickly.
A blanket!

327
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,310
The silver!
The silver!

328
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,560
Oh, my lord. Sorry.

329
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,590
You'll be all right.

330
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,170
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry.
What happened?

331
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,170
- He tripped with the tray.
- I saw it from the window.

332
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,410
This has never happened before.

333
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,340
- May I telephone the doctor?
- Yes, do.

334
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,850
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

335
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,530
Your father feeling better?

336
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,500
He's made a full recovery.

337
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,140
Good.

338
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,130
We don't wish to see anything
of that sort ever happen again, do we?

339
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,480
- I mean, your father collapsing.
- Indeed not, my lord.

340
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,880
And it could happen anywhere.

341
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,990
At any time.

342
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,930
The first of the foreign delegates
will be here in less than a fortnight.

343
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,170
- We are well prepared, my lord.
- I'm sure you are.

344
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,170
What happens within this house
could have...

345
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,480
...considerable repercussions
on the course that Europe takes.

346
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,900
It means a great deal.

347
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,120
And it means a great deal
to me personally.

348
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,630
I had a German friend,
Karl-Heinz Bremann.

349
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,580
We fought on opposite sides
in the war.

350
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,450
We always said when it was over,
we'd sit down and have a drink...

351
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,070
...like gentlemen.

352
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,290
The Versailles Treaty
made a liar of me.

353
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,620
Yes, a liar, Stevens.

354
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,950
Because the terms we imposed were
so harsh that Germany was finished.

355
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,730
One doesn't do that
to a defeated foe.

356
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,070
Once your man's on the canvas,
it ought to be over.

357
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,530
My friend Bremann
was ruined by inflation.

358
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,930
Couldn't get a job
in postwar Germany.

359
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,150
Killed himself.

360
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,900
Shot himself in a railway carriage.

361
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,030
Since then, I've felt it my duty
to help Germany and to give her...

362
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,740
...a fair chance.

363
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,880
So this conference is crucial...

364
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,460
...and we can't run the risk
of any accidents.

365
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,830
There's no question
of your father leaving.

366
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,910
You're simply being asked
to reconsider his duties.

367
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,850
Of course, my lord.
I understand fully.

368
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,200
Good.

369
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,760
I'll leave you to think about it,
then, Stevens.

370
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,080
Thank you, sir.

371
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,900
I'm short-handed in the dining room.
I can use you in the servery.

372
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,540
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens, sir.
- Smarten up. Look sharp.

373
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,490
Good morning.

374
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,000
Good morning.

375
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,040
I might've known you'd be up
and ready for the day.

376
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,390
I've been up for two hours.

377
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,610
- That's not much sleep.
- It's all the sleep I need.

378
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,070
I've come to talk to you.

379
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,320
Talk, then.
I haven't got all morning.

380
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,820
- I'll come straight to the point.
- Do, and be done with it.

381
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,460
Some of us have work
to be getting on with.

382
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,210
There's to be a very important
conference in this house next week.

383
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,900
People of great stature will be
His Lordship's guests.

384
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,660
We must all put our best foot forward.

385
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,880
Because of Father's recent accident...

386
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,720
...it has been suggested that you
no longer wait at table.

387
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,190
I've waited at table every day...

388
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,020
...for the last 54 years.

389
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,650
It has also been decided that you
should no longer carry heavy trays.

390
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,630
Now, here's a revised list
of your duties.

391
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,410
Look, I fell...

392
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,610
...because of those paving stones.

393
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
They're crooked.

394
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,420
Why don't you get them put right
before someone else falls?

395
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,050
You will read the revised list
of your duties.

396
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,660
Get those stones put right.

397
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,290
You don't want those "gentlemen of
stature" breaking their necks.

398
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,600
No, indeed, I don't.

399
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,550
What is it?

400
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,920
You have what we can call
a roving commission.

401
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,580
In other words, you can exercise
your own judgment...

402
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,910
...within certain limits, of course.

403
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,650
Now, here are the mops, and...
Here.

404
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,490
- Are these me mops?
- Right. Your brushes.

405
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,220
And me brushes?

406
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,780
- And me mops.
- That's right.

407
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,510
What do you want me to do with them?

408
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,220
I think you know what to do with them,
Father. Look for dust and dirt.

409
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,540
If I find any dust or dirt...

410
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,100
...I go over them with this mop.

411
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,590
That's right.

412
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,490
Now, I suggest you start off...

413
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,900
...with the brasses on the doors.

414
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,800
There's that door there.
Then the door that's open.

415
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,110
And then there's this door here...

416
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,420
Here's your polish.
And duster.

417
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,080
History could well be made under
this roof over the next few days.

418
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,240
Each and every one of you...

419
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,360
...can be proud of the role
you will play on this occasion.

420
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,520
<i>Imagine yourself
the head of a battalion...</i>

421
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,600
<i>...even if it is only filling
the hot-water bottles.</i>

422
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,330
<i>Each one has his own
particular duty...</i>

423
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,400
<i>...or her particular duty,
as the cap fits.</i>

424
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,710
<i>Polished brass, brilliant silver,
mahogany shining like a mirror.</i>

425
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,590
<i>That is the welcome we will show
these foreign visitors...</i>

426
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,940
<i>...to let them know
they are in England...</i>

427
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,730
<i>...where order and tradition
still prevail.</i>

428
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,540
Thank you, Brian.

429
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,900
Mr. Lewis, the American,
has arrived.

430
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,950
He was expected tomorrow.
What have you done with him?

431
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,940
Mr. Lewis has been shown upstairs.

432
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,450
My godson, Cardinal, will shortly
become engaged to be married.

433
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,280
Indeed, sir.
I offer my congratulations.

434
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,980
Thank you, Stevens.

435
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,560
I feel very responsible for the boy.

436
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,940
He is my godson, and his father
was my closest friend, as you know.

437
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,500
And now that he's gone, well...

438
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,520
...I feel in place of a father to him.

439
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,680
I've appointed him as my secretary
at the conference.

440
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,140
He's been jolly thorough
in helping me to prepare.

441
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,400
I realize this is a somewhat
irregular thing to ask you to do.

442
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,140
I'd be glad to be of any assistance.

443
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,120
I'm sorry to bring this up...

444
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,920
...but I just can't see how on earth
to make it go away.

445
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,210
You are familiar with
the facts of life?

446
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,810
- My lord?
- The facts of life.

447
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,690
Birds, bees.
You are familiar, aren't you?

448
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,440
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.

449
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,090
Let me put my cards on the table.

450
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,690
I'm so busy with this conference.
Of course, you are too...

451
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,770
...but someone has to tell him.

452
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,410
In a way, it would be easier for you.

453
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,700
Less awkward.

454
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,720
I'd find the task rather daunting,
I'm afraid.

455
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,330
I might not get to it
before Reginald's wedding day.

456
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,050
Of course, this goes far beyond
the call of duty.

457
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,980
I shall do my best.

458
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,190
I'd be grateful if you'd try.
It'd be a lot off my mind.

459
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,900
There's no need to make a song and
dance of it. Just convey the facts.

460
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,370
God! Stevens!

461
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,450
Sorry. Most sorry, sir...

462
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,850
...but I do have something to convey
to you rather urgently.

463
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,690
If I may, I'll come to the point.

464
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:51,590
Perhaps you noticed this morning the
ducks and the geese by the pond?

465
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,940
Ducks and geese?
I don't think so.

466
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,210
Well, perhaps the birds
and the flowers, then...

467
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,740
...or the shrubs, the bees...

468
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,180
I've not seen any bees.

469
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,270
- It's not the best time to see them.
- What, the bees?

470
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,760
What I'm saying is that,
with the arrival of spring...

471
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,830
...we shall see a most remarkable
and profound change...

472
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,460
...in the surroundings.

473
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,660
I'm sure that's right. I'm sure the
grounds are not at their best now.

474
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,910
I wasn't paying attention
to the glories of nature...

475
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,300
...because it's worrying...

476
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,350
Dupont D'Ivry has arrived in a foul
mood, the last thing anyone wants.

477
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,660
- M. Dupont D'Ivry has arrived?
- Half an hour ago, in a foul mood.

478
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:41,210
In that case, excuse me.
I'd better go and attend to him.

479
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,970
Right you are.
Kind of you to talk to me.

480
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,340
Not at all. I've one or two words
more to convey on the topic of...

481
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,890
...as you put it most admirably...

482
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,370
...the glories of nature.

483
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,930
But it must wait for another occasion.

484
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,070
I'll look forward to it.
But I'm more of a fish man.

485
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,110
- Fish?
- I know all about fish.

486
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,730
Freshwater and salt.

487
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,050
All living creatures would be
relevant to our discussion.

488
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,230
<i>Excuse me. I had no idea that
Monsieur Dupont D'Ivry had arrived.</i>

489
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,630
Thank you.

490
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,400
May I be of assistance, sir?

491
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,370
Oh, the butler.

492
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:31,550
I have sore feet, so I need a basin
with warm water and salts, please.

493
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,670
I'll arrange that with
the housekeeper, sir.

494
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,660
Warm water and salts
as soon as possible.

495
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,700
How do you do? But I speak English.

496
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,050
Good. That's lucky for me.
I'm Jack Lewis, the U.S. delegate.

497
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,380
Could we speak privately soon?

498
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,750
Yes, of course.

499
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:56,550
But I have blisters due to some
sightseeing they made me do in London.

500
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,050
I had already seen
the Tower of London.

501
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,690
I've discovered that things
are not moving...

502
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,090
...in a direction that I think
you would approve of.

503
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,900
German rearmament
is a fact to be accepted.

504
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,370
It's in our own interest to have a free
and equal Germany.

505
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,320
Not a prostrate nation...

506
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,040
...upon whom an unfair peace treaty
was imposed 16 years ago.

507
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,110
Those who've been in Germany...

508
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:18,980
...can only thrill, as I have,
to the signs of rebirth.

509
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,450
- to assist Germany in her virile
struggle for economic recovery...

510
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:28,050
...including support for her fair
demand for equality of armaments...

511
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,340
...and universal military service
for German youth.

512
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,250
If we, in postwar Europe...

513
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:40,040
I need more water.
I need another basin to bathe my feet.

514
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,310
Follow me, sir.

515
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,780
Excuse me.

516
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,270
- We have to talk.
- This way, sir.

517
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,420
My friend, I am in agony.
Too tight shoes. I blame myself.

518
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,210
Vanity.

519
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,550
We must do some fast maneuvering
to restrain the Germans.

520
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,780
Please come this way, gentlemen.

521
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,070
Butler, please, could you help me
with my feet- shoe?

522
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,340
- Yes, of course.
- Take it off.

523
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:38,230
What they said about equality of arms
for Germany, military service-

524
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,470
- Sorry, sir.
- I'll manage.

525
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,510
What?

526
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,280
Your father's been taken ill, sir.

527
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,690
- Where?
- Outside the Chinese bedroom, sir.

528
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:58,250
Germany wants peace as much as we do.
She needs peace.

529
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,620
Here, let me help you with that.

530
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,340
Thank you.

531
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,410
Thank you, Charles.

532
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,130
Take a basin of hot water and salts...

533
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,680
...to Mr. D'Ivry in the
billiards room. Is that understood?

534
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,100
- Yes, Mr. Stevens.
- Good. Do it.

535
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,130
Father?

536
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,060
I have more time than you to look
after him. I've called the doctor.

537
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,730
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

538
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,690
Your father's not so good, I'm afraid.

539
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,100
If he deteriorates, call me, will you?

540
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,910
How old is he? 70, 72?

541
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,900
-75, sir.
- I see.

542
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,260
- If he deteriorates, let me know.
- I will, sir. Thank you, doctor.

543
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,280
More haste, less speed.

544
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,200
There's something missing.

545
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,990
What is it?

546
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,790
- The spoon from the cruet set, sir.
- Good.

547
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,130
Well observed.

548
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,960
Now, never touch the lip of the glass.

549
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,110
Good.

550
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,880
Glass first, and then...

551
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,000
Is everything in hand downstairs?

552
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,530
We're preparing the last dinner
of the conference.

553
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,290
You can imagine the kitchen.

554
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,680
- But is everything in hand?
- Yes, I think we're up to scratch.

555
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,390
Are you feeling any better?

556
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,600
There's something I have to tell you.

557
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,960
I have so much to do.
Why don't we talk in the morning?

558
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,260
Jim...

559
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,240
...I fell out of love
with your mother.

560
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,950
I loved her once.

561
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,270
The love went out of me
when I found her carrying on.

562
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,190
A good son.

563
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,070
Proud of you.

564
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,080
I hope I've been a good father.

565
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,930
I tried me best.

566
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,360
You better get down there...

567
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:40,240
...or heaven only knows
what they'll be up to.

568
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,320
Go on.

569
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,080
Go on!

570
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,370
We'll talk in the morning.

571
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,580
On the last day of our conference...

572
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,460
...permit me to say
how impressed I have been...

573
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:26,570
...with the spirit of goodwill
that has prevailed.

574
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,400
Goodwill for Germany.

575
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,690
And with tears in my eyes...

576
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,740
...I see that everyone here
has recognized...

577
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,310
...our right to be, once again,
a strong nation.

578
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,950
With my hand on my heart,
I declare...

579
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,250
...that Germany needs peace...

580
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,030
...and desires only peace.

581
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,350
Peace with England...

582
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,800
...and peace with France.

583
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,110
Thank you very much.

584
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,450
I, too, have been impressed...

585
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,270
...yes, deeply impressed...

586
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,750
...by the genuine desire for peace
manifested at this conference.

587
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,200
Unlike our American colleague...

588
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,410
...we in Europe know
the horrors of war.

589
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,730
And whether we are French
or English or Italian or German...

590
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,010
...our one desire is to never
have to experience them again.

591
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,770
Indeed.

592
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,700
Impressed, or I may say touched...

593
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,460
...by the words of goodwill
and friendship I have heard...

594
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,120
...I promise you that I shall do
my utmost...

595
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,600
...to change my country's policy...

596
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,270
...towards that nation
which was once our foe...

597
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,910
...but is now,
I may venture to say...

598
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,130
...our friend.

599
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,750
Ladies and gentlemen...

600
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,780
...the United States doesn't want war
any more than you do.

601
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,680
On the other hand, neither do we
want peace at any price...

602
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,510
...because some prices,
you may find...

603
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,310
...are too outrageously high to pay.

604
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,950
But let's not get into that now.
We may have to soon enough.

605
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,820
For the moment, let us raise
our glasses to Lord Darlington...

606
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,900
...in gratitude for his
magnificent hospitality.

607
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,560
Lord Darlington is a classic
English gentleman of the old school.

608
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,940
Decent and honorable and well-meaning.

609
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,010
So are all of you. All decent,
honorable and well-meaning gentlemen.

610
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,710
It's a pleasure and a privilege
to visit with you here.

611
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:09,290
But...

612
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,930
...now, excuse me, I must say this...

613
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,900
...you are, all of you, amateurs.

614
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,080
And international affairs should
never be run by gentlemen amateurs.

615
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,670
Do you have any idea of what sort
of a place the world is becoming?

616
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,740
The days when you could act
out of noble instincts are over.

617
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:33,240
<i>Europe has become the arena of
Realpolitik, the politics of reality.</i>

618
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,600
If you like, real politics.

619
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:41,320
What you need is not gentlemen
politicians, but real ones.

620
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,210
You need professionals,
or you're headed for disaster.

621
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,310
So I propose a toast, gentlemen...

622
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,270
...to the professionals.

623
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,230
Well, I've no wish to enter
into a quarrel...

624
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,300
...on our last evening together.

625
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:08,600
But let me say this.
What you describe as amateurism...

626
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:12,650
...is what I think most of us here
still prefer to call honour.

627
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:17,090
Miss Kenton would like to see you
concerning your father.

628
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:21,860
I suggest that your professionalism
means greed and power...

629
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:26,180
...rather than to see justice
and goodness prevail in the world.

630
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:30,850
I've never concealed from myself
that what we were asking of Germany...

631
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:35,430
...is a complete break from the
tradition of this country. Thank you.

632
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:49,440
Mr. Stevens, I'm very sorry.

633
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,920
Your father passed away
four minutes ago.

634
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,950
Oh, I see.

635
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,580
I'm so very sorry.

636
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,420
I wish there was something
I could say.

637
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,610
Will you come up and see him?

638
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,730
Well, I'm very busy at the moment.
In a little while, perhaps.

639
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,060
In that case, will you permit me
to close his eyes?

640
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,090
I would be most grateful.
Thank you.

641
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:28,220
My father would wish me to carry on.
I can't let him down.

642
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,370
No. Of course.

643
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,040
I'd really like to continue
our little chat sometime.

644
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,920
About nature.

645
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,930
You're right. I should come back
when everything's burgeoning.

646
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,670
Yes, sir. Indeed.

647
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,640
As I said before, my main interest
has always been in fish.

648
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:01,650
When I was small,
I kept tropical fish in a tank.

649
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,110
I harboured quite a passion for them.

650
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,260
I'll have another drop of that,
if you don't mind.

651
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,630
You all right?

652
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,830
I'm perfectly all right.

653
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,620
Not feeling unwell?

654
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,190
No, sir. A little tired, perhaps.

655
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,470
Wonderful!

656
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:41,830
What a beautiful example of German
culture you've brought to this house.

657
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,880
Very nice.

658
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,400
I hope there's no hard feelings.

659
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,220
Oh, my dear good chap.

660
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:53,440
I like a good, clean fight.
Giving as good as one gets, what?

661
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:57,070
I have the greatest respect
for the English. I love it here.

662
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,620
My family brought us here as kids,
so I feel at home.

663
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:02,110
Anyway, thank you.

664
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:03,680
Excuse me.

665
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,630
You all right?

666
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,070
Yes, perfect, my lord.

667
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,660
You coming down
with a cold or something?

668
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,310
It's been a long day.

669
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:19,400
It's been a hard day for both of us.

670
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,100
Well done.

671
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,460
My condolences.

672
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:53,600
It was a stroke. A severe stroke.
He wouldn't have suffered much pain.

673
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,730
Thank you for telling me.

674
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:22,570
There's a distinguished foreign
gentleman in the billiard room...

675
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,110
...in need of attention.

676
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,320
Urgent?

677
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,870
His feet.

678
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:28,390
Feet?

679
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:34,160
- I'll take you to him.
- If it's urgent.

680
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,610
It is urgent.
The gentleman is in pain.

681
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,910
My condolences.

682
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,620
Thank you. That is most kind of you.

683
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,790
Good afternoon.

684
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,180
My name is Stevens.
I'm hoping there's a letter for me.

685
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,800
- I'll just check for you, sir.
- James Stevens.

686
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,990
- I'd like two apples, please.
- There you are, Mr. Stevens.

687
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,090
- You are touring in these parts?
- I'm on my way to Clevedon.

688
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:38,510
- How much is that?
- That'll be threepence, please.

689
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,760
And you'd be coming from...?

690
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,660
- Oxfordshire.
- Whereabouts?

691
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,770
- Sorry?
- Whereabouts in Oxfordshire?

692
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,920
Darlington.

693
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,700
That rings a bell. Wasn't there
a Lord Darlington? Some sort...

694
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,810
...of Nazi, got us in the war?

695
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,410
I'm the butler there,
and my employer...

696
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,790
...is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.

697
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,110
I didn't know the former owner.

698
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,550
Your change.

699
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,570
<i>I should be glad to meet you at the
Sea View Hotel, opposite the pier.</i>

700
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,950
<i>We'll have such a lot to talk about,
and I'll have many questions.</i>

701
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,160
<i>Except for you, I've lost touch with
all our friends at Darlington Hall.</i>

702
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,520
<i>But that's no wonder.</i>

703
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,170
<i>It was long ago and a lot
has happened in between.</i>

704
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,600
<i>Who could keep track of all the people
His Lordship once employed?</i>

705
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,270
My lord, you rang?

706
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,820
- Have the young German ladies arrived?
- They're outside.

707
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,920
I'd like to say hello to them,
practise my German.

708
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,190
- They do speak excellent English.
- Good. Well, ask them to come in.

709
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,140
This is Elsa and this is Irma.

710
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,600
I'm asking about their journey.

711
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,090
It was long, my lord.

712
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,050
I asked if they like the weather.

713
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,040
We are grateful to you, my lord,
for letting us come here.

714
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,830
Our parents are very grateful.

715
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,910
Not at all.
Miss Kenton will look after you.

716
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,890
- Won't you?
- Indeed, my lord.

717
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,300
Welcome to Darlington Hall.

718
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,890
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

719
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,730
Will there be anything else?

720
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,520
Sir Geoffrey.

721
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,380
Good to see you.

722
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,380
How do you do?

723
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,270
Well, come in.

724
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,080
- Mr. Benn.
- Mr. Stevens.

725
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,960
Gentlemen, if you'd like to wait
here for a while.

726
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,150
- Aren't you still at Stanton Lacey?
- I'm with Sir Geoffrey now.

727
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,850
- You haven't changed one bit.
- I'll let you get on.

728
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,610
- Perhaps we'll meet later.
- I hope so.

729
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,240
But, gentlemen, you speak of Jews
and Gypsies, Negroes and so forth.

730
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,480
But one has to regard the racial
laws of the Fascists...

731
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,100
...as a sanitary measure,
much overdue, in my opinion.

732
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,390
Imagine trying to enforce
such a rule in this country-

733
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,710
You cannot run a country
without a penal system.

734
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,330
Here we call them prisons. There,
they call them concentration camps.

735
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,010
Is there any meat
of any kind in this soup?

736
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,270
I think it's mushroom stock, sir.

737
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,200
Mushroom ends and skins,
onion and celery. No meat at all.

738
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,240
Cold water, and then cook adds sherry.

739
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,280
I hear you have a Labour fellow
from your constituency.

740
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,400
Over there, they've got rid of
all that trade union rubbish.

741
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,200
Believe me, no workers strike
in Germany.

742
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,550
And everyone's kept in line.

743
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,640
No wonder this country
is going down the drain.

744
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,230
It is internally diseased.

745
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,500
I think there may be butter
in the croutons. Do you know?

746
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,860
I'm afraid there may be.

747
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,660
You've made a cozy little nest here.

748
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,480
Seems to me you must be
a well-contented man.

749
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,270
In my philosophy, Mr. Benn...

750
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,010
...a man cannot call himself
well-contented...

751
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,260
...until he has done all he can...

752
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,660
...to be of service to his employer.

753
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,020
This assumes that one's employer...

754
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:28,180
...is a superior person
not only in rank or wealth...

755
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:30,050
...but in moral stature.

756
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,760
And in your opinion, what's going on
up there has "moral stature"?

757
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,910
I wish I could be sure.

758
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,700
But I'm not.

759
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,790
I've heard some very fishy things.
Very fishy.

760
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,150
I hear nothing.

761
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,230
Listen.

762
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,470
That's so touching, isn't it?

763
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:57,870
To listen to the gentlemen
would distract me from my work.

764
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,330
It's fresh soda.

765
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,050
Would you be joining us?

766
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:17,950
Thank you, but it's very late
and I have an early start.

767
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:19,490
Good night.

768
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:22,660
- Good night, Mr. Stevens.
- Good night, Miss Kenton.

769
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,650
Good-looking woman.

770
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,910
It was never the same
after she left Stanton Lacey.

771
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,800
I handed in my own notice
six months later.

772
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,830
I'd be lost without her.

773
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:48,900
A first-rate housekeeper
is essential in a house like this...

774
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:52,750
...where great affairs are decided
between these walls.

775
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,350
- Good morning.
- My lord.

776
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,740
<i>"We do the Jews no injustice when we
say that the revelation of Christ...</i>

777
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:24,560
<i>...is something incomprehensible
and hateful to them.</i>

778
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,250
<i>Though He apparently sprang
from their midst...</i>

779
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:30,890
<i>...He embodies the negation of their
whole nature.</i>

780
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:34,600
<i>The Jews are far more sensitive
about this than we are.</i>

781
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:39,550
<i>This demonstration of the cleft that
separates us Europeans from the Jew...</i>

782
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:42,830
<i>...is not given in order
to let religious prejudice...</i>

783
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:45,600
<i>...with its dangerous bias,
settle the matter...</i>

784
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:49,360
<i>...but because the perception of
two fundamentally different natures...</i>

785
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,700
<i>...reveals a real gulf. "</i>

786
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:13,410
We have some refugee girls
on the staff now, I believe.

787
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:14,890
We do.

788
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:17,400
Two housemaids, Elsa and Irma.

789
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:20,410
You'll have to let them go,
I'm afraid.

790
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,050
Let them go, my lord?

791
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,380
It's regrettable,
but we have no choice.

792
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,260
You must see the whole thing
in context.

793
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:35,540
I have the well-being
of my guests to consider.

794
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,490
May I say...

795
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,550
...they work extremely well.

796
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:47,510
They're intelligent, polite
and very clean.

797
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:51,470
I'm sorry, but I've looked
into this matter very carefully.

798
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:54,080
There are larger issues at stake.

799
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,460
I'm sorry, but there it is.

800
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,630
They're Jews.

801
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,900
Yes, my lord.

802
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:12,250
I'm amazed you can stand
there as if...

803
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:16,150
...you were discussing orders
for the larder. I can't believe it!

804
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:19,300
Elsa and Irma are to be dismissed
because they're Jewish?

805
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:23,960
His Lordship has decided. There's
nothing for you and I to discuss.

806
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:27,380
Without work, they could be
sent back to Germany.

807
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,930
It is out of our hands.

808
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:32,750
I tell you, if you dismiss my girls
tomorrow, it will be wrong!

809
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,360
A sin, as any sin ever was one!

810
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:48,070
There are many things you and I
don't understand in this world.

811
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:52,340
His Lordship understands fully and has
studied the larger issues at stake...

812
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,540
...concerning, say...

813
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:57,190
...the nature of Jewry.

814
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,790
I warn you...

815
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,040
...if those girls go...

816
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,110
...I shall leave this house.

817
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:15,140
Please.

818
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:37,480
These references,
I have to tell you...

819
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:39,240
...are quite reserved.

820
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,920
Why did you leave
your last employment?

821
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,610
- They didn't want me anymore.
- Why not?

822
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:47,440
I don't know.

823
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,820
They just didn't want me anymore.

824
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,600
They say she works well.

825
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,360
Would you please wait outside?

826
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,650
- She's unsuitable.
- Not at all. I want her.

827
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:07,590
- She'll be under my supervision.
- She's not suitable.

828
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,050
She'll do well. I'll see to it.

829
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:15,620
Well, then, it is entirely
your responsibility.

830
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:20,000
Weren't you leaving
because of the German girls?

831
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,060
I'm not leaving.

832
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:27,390
I've nowhere to go. I have no family.

833
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,070
I'm a coward.

834
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:32,190
Yes. I am a coward.

835
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:35,520
I'm frightened of leaving,
and that's the truth.

836
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:41,130
All I see out in the world
is loneliness, and it frightens me.

837
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:45,540
That's all my high principles
are worth.

838
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,790
I'm ashamed of myself.

839
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:01,120
You mean a great deal to this house.

840
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:10,340
You're extremely important
to this house.

841
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,450
Am I?

842
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,640
Now, look here...

843
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:28,120
...if you're really sure about
this young woman, call her back in.

844
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:46,430
Miss Hull, we would like you
to start next week.

845
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:50,390
You're responsible to Miss Kenton.
She'll explain the house rules.

846
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:54,080
Number one: no gentlemen callers,
or other such.

847
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,070
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

848
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,570
- Welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

849
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,000
Well done.
I'll show you to your room.

850
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,190
I'd forgotten how much petrol
the Daimler uses.

851
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,710
It's an impractical motor to be
going about the country, Mister...

852
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,590
Smith. Harry Smith. It's a privilege
to have you here in Moscombe.

853
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:08,440
- It's a privilege to be here.
- Your health, sir.

854
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:12,730
Dr. Carlisle usually drops in
around now. He'd enjoy meeting you.

855
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,210
He's a gentleman like yourself.

856
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,680
I don't know what you call
a gentleman.

857
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,940
It's a name every man
in this country has a right to.

858
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,790
There's Harry Smith now, giving
you an earful of his philosophy.

859
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,360
We English...

860
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:30,070
...have the advantage and privilege
of expressing our opinions...

861
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:34,180
...and voting for Parliament.
That's what we fought Hitler for.

862
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,150
Have you had much to do
with politics yourself?

863
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:42,410
Not directly as such, no,
particularly in these days.

864
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,980
Perhaps more so in the early 1930s
and just before the war.

865
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,290
My concern was more
international affairs.

866
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:53,120
Or foreign policy, so to speak.

867
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:58,860
Not that I ever held high office,
mind you.

868
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,820
No, any influence I exerted
was in an unofficial capacity.

869
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,670
Excuse me, sir.

870
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,940
Have you ever met Mr. Churchill?

871
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:13,440
He came to the house occasionally.
Again, in the early 1930s.

872
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,360
He was a bloody warmonger!

873
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:19,780
Honestly, Harry! We wouldn't have won
the war without him.

874
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:23,430
Not content to fight Germans,
he sent troops in against the miners.

875
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,230
- What about the war?
- Yes, all right.

876
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,220
He did well in the war,
but he should've stepped down.

877
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,490
- And Mr. Eden?
- He made a right bugger of Suez!

878
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,390
Yes, I met Mr. Eden.
Yes, occasionally.

879
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,650
How do you do? Richard Carlisle.

880
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,770
Rotten luck about your car,
but nice to have you.

881
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:44,890
- Everyone has been most kind.
- He says he knows foreign affairs.

882
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,030
Is that so, indeed?

883
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,060
In an unofficial capacity.

884
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,530
- He knows Mr. Churchill.
- And Mr. Eden.

885
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,370
Really?

886
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:59,720
Yes, well, it was my good fortune
to have consorted...

887
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,900
...with many men of influence
from Europe and from America.

888
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,840
Mr. Taylor...

889
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:14,120
...I really feel I ought to retire now
because I'm feeling rather tired.

890
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,410
No wonder, sir.
Running out of petrol...

891
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,580
...then having to hear Smith's
political opinions.

892
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:21,680
Just step this way, sir.

893
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,580
I'm going to Stanbury in the
morning. I'll give you a lift...

894
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,590
...and we could pick up
a can of petrol on the way.

895
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:33,610
- I'd hate to inconvenience you.
- Not at all. Would 7:30 suit you?

896
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:37,780
You'll enjoy talking to Dr. Carlisle.
Watch this step.

897
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,450
Excuse Harry Smith.

898
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,810
He will go on about his politics.
I don't mean he's not right.

899
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:47,130
Democracy is why we fought Hitler, and
we lost a few lads in this village...

900
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,960
...including our son here.

901
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,320
Dunkirk.

902
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,350
I'll get you a blanket.

903
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,310
I've left a razor and soap
on the basin.

904
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:35,200
Listen to the opinions
of your man in the street.

905
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:38,030
They're perfectly entitled
to give an opinion...

906
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,790
...on politics or whatever questions-

907
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,010
They've got no qualifications!

908
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,050
Of course they have!

909
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,860
Mr. Spencer would like
a word with you.

910
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:53,310
My good man,
I have a question for you.

911
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,280
Do you suppose the debt situation
regarding America...

912
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,800
...factors significantly in the
present low levels of trade?

913
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:03,830
Or is this a red herring...

914
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:08,310
...and the abandonment of the gold
standard is the cause of the problem?

915
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:14,310
I'm sorry, sir, but I am unable
to be of assistance in this matter.

916
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,040
Oh, dear.
What a pity.

917
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:18,290
Perhaps you'd help us
on another matter.

918
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,740
Do you think...

919
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:25,930
...Europe's currency problem would be
alleviated by an arms agreement...

920
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:28,570
...between the French
and the Bolsheviks?

921
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:34,780
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm unable
to be of assistance in this matter.

922
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,910
Very well, that'll be all.

923
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:42,700
One moment, Darlington, I have another
question to put to our good man here.

924
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,550
My good fellow...

925
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,590
...do you share our opinion...

926
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:51,750
...that M. Daladier's recent speech
on North Africa...

927
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,430
...was simply a ruse...

928
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:58,020
...to scupper the nationalist fringe
of his own domestic party?

929
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:02,570
I'm sorry, sir. I am unable
to help in any of these matters.

930
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:07,110
You see, our good man here is " unable
to assist us in these matters. "

931
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,180
Yet we still go along
with the notion...

932
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:13,750
...that this nation's decisions
be left to our good man here...

933
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,820
...and a few millions like him.

934
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:20,630
You may as well ask the Mothers'
Union to organize a war campaign.

935
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,190
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

936
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,290
You certainly proved your point.

937
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:33,920
- Q.E.D., I think.
- No, not at all!

938
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,750
Oh, yes, he has!

939
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:44,530
What did you make of the citizens
of Moscombe? Not a bad bunch.

940
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:45,690
No, sir.

941
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:48,920
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor
were extremely kind.

942
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:54,940
I say, I hope you don't
think me very rude...

943
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:58,060
...but you aren't a manservant
of some sort, are you?

944
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:02,340
Yes, sir. I am, indeed.

945
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:07,440
In fact, I'm the butler
of Darlington Hall, near Oxford.

946
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,500
It wasn't my intention
to deceive anyone.

947
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:13,220
Don't explain.
I can see how it happened.

948
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,600
Darlington.

949
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,440
Wasn't there a
Lord Darlington involved...

950
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:21,570
...in that appeasement business
that got us into the war?

951
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:24,790
Sorry, I never knew
that Lord Darlington.

952
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:28,340
My employer's an American
gentleman, Mr. Lewis.

953
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:35,210
Lord Darlington was among those who
tried to make a deal with Hitler.

954
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:38,220
Then there was a case after the war...

955
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,480
...where he sued a newspaper
for libel.

956
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:43,650
<i>The Express, was it?
News Chronicle?</i>

957
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:46,500
- I couldn't say, sir.
- Anyway, he lost.

958
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:50,810
He was lucky, really, not to have
been tried for treason.

959
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:53,480
There it is, just ahead.

960
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:10,700
Sir, I must confess...

961
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:13,380
...that I failed to tell
you the truth.

962
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:19,420
I did know Lord Darlington, and I can
declare that he was a truly good man.

963
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:21,610
A gentleman through and through...

964
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:25,190
...to whom I'm proud to have given
my best years of service.

965
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:32,190
That should get you
to the next petrol station.

966
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:36,610
Thank you very much, sir.
I'm most grateful.

967
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,660
But did you...

968
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,110
...share his opinions?

969
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,480
Who?

970
01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:42,890
Lord Darlington.

971
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,220
I was his butler.
I was there to serve him...

972
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,790
...not to agree or disagree.

973
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:51,590
You trusted him.

974
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:54,050
Yes, I did. Completely.

975
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:59,610
But at the end of his life, he himself
admitted that he'd been... mistaken.

976
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:04,160
That he'd been too gullible,
and he'd let himself be taken in.

977
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:05,800
I see.

978
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:10,860
Thank you, sir.
You've been most kind.

979
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:24,920
Just keep going straight up here,
and turn left at the first crossroads.

980
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:28,410
I say, I don't want to be a bore,
but I'm intrigued.

981
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:30,680
Where do you stand on all that?

982
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:34,380
If a mistake was to be made, wouldn't
you rather have made your own?

983
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,280
Forgive me for being so inquisitive.

984
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:38,910
Not at all, sir.

985
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:42,000
In a very small way,
I did make my own mistake.

986
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:44,820
But I might have a chance
to set mine right.

987
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:48,590
In fact, I'm on my way
to try and do so now.

988
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,220
Try the ignition.

989
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:58,840
Thank you, sir.
I'm most grateful for your help.

990
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:03,260
Good luck.
It's been interesting talking to you.

991
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:36,890
Good morning.

992
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,660
Lord Halifax was impressed
with the silver.

993
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:43,570
I told him it was all your doing.
Sent his compliments. Well done.

994
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:50,820
I've been meaning to ask you...

995
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:54,230
That business last year
about the Jewish maids...

996
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:57,260
...I suppose there's no way
of tracing them?

997
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:01,410
That would be difficult. I tried
to get them a position in Surrey.

998
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:05,370
There was room only for one,
and they didn't want to be separated.

999
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:10,340
Well, try anyway. One would like
to do something for them.

1000
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:12,870
It was wrong, what occurred.

1001
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:16,320
I'm sorry about it. Very sorry.

1002
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:20,520
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1003
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:25,970
He asked about the Jewish girls.

1004
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:29,050
- Elsa and Irma?
- He wondered where they were.

1005
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:31,440
He said it was wrong
to dismiss them.

1006
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:35,180
I remember you were
as distressed as I was about it.

1007
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:36,940
As you were?

1008
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:41,560
You thought it was right and proper
that they should be sent packing.

1009
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,830
Now, really, that is most unfair.

1010
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:47,310
Of course I was upset.
Very much so.

1011
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,440
I don't like that happening here.

1012
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:54,480
I wish you'd told me. It would've
helped me to know you felt as I did.

1013
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,920
Why do you always have to hide
what you feel?

1014
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:06,800
Have you finished the lavender bags?
Good.

1015
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:08,440
All right.

1016
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,240
I take my hat off to you.

1017
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:27,160
That girl's come along very well.
You were right and I was wrong.

1018
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:32,150
- Look at that smile on your face.
- What smile?

1019
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:35,910
That tells a story in itself.

1020
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,740
Wouldn't you say so?

1021
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:40,640
What story's that?

1022
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,030
She's a pretty girl, don't you think?

1023
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,400
Is she?

1024
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:48,530
You don't like pretty girls
on the staff. I've noticed.

1025
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:53,480
Might it be that our Mr. Stevens
fears distraction?

1026
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:58,730
Can it be that Mr. Stevens is flesh
and blood and cannot trust himself?

1027
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:01,550
You know what I'm doing?

1028
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:04,980
I'm placing my thoughts elsewhere
while you chatter away.

1029
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:07,430
Why is that guilty smile
still on your face?

1030
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:11,560
Not guilty, simply amused
by the nonsense you sometimes talk.

1031
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:15,110
It is a guilty smile.
You can't bear to look at her.

1032
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,850
You didn't want her.
She was too pretty.

1033
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:19,700
You must be right.

1034
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,420
You always are.

1035
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,200
Charlie!

1036
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:49,420
Lizzie, aren't you supposed to be
turning down the beds?

1037
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,140
Well, you better get on with it, then.

1038
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,040
Have you told her yet?
You better get on with it, then.

1039
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,660
What can I say to her?
She'd never understand.

1040
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,100
- Why not?
- She's old. She must be at least 30.

1041
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,980
Perhaps she doesn't feel old.

1042
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,660
Who do you think those flowers
are for she's been picking?

1043
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,380
Come here. Give us a kiss.

1044
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,080
Flowers.

1045
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,630
Flowers.

1046
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,700
You're reading.

1047
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,680
It's very dim. Can you see?

1048
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,230
Yes, thank you.

1049
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,220
What are you reading?

1050
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,800
A book.

1051
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,380
Yes, but what sort of book?

1052
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,320
It's a book, Miss Kenton.
A book.

1053
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,940
What's the book?

1054
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,480
Are you shy about your book?

1055
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,380
What is it?

1056
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,580
Is it racy?

1057
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,950
Racy?

1058
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,540
Are you reading a racy book?

1059
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,890
Do you think racy books are to be
found in His Lordship's shelves?

1060
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,660
How would I know?

1061
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,150
What is it?

1062
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,650
Let me see it.
Let me see your book.

1063
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,290
Please leave me alone.

1064
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,660
Why won't you show me your book?

1065
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,340
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

1066
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,060
Is that so?

1067
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,770
I'm invading your private time,
am I?

1068
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,890
What's in that book?

1069
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,040
Come on, let me see.

1070
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,160
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?

1071
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,970
Would I be shocked?

1072
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,790
Would it ruin my character?

1073
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,250
Let me see it.

1074
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,340
Oh, dear.

1075
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,170
It's not scandalous at all.

1076
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,270
It's just a sentimental
old love story.

1077
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,360
I read these books...

1078
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,210
...any books...

1079
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,520
...to develop my command and knowledge
of the English language.

1080
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,250
I read to further my education,
Miss Kenton.

1081
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,970
I really must ask you, please...

1082
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,450
...not to disturb the few moments
I have to myself.

1083
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:29,550
Come in.

1084
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,300
What is it?

1085
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,330
I'm wanting to give you
my notice, please.

1086
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:44,840
Why?

1087
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,550
Charlie and me, we're getting married.

1088
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,300
Have you thought about this carefully?

1089
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,630
Yes, Miss Kenton, I have.

1090
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:01,530
You've been getting on well here and
could have a fine career before you.

1091
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,610
Charlie and me's getting married.

1092
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:05,920
Charlie and I.

1093
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,610
I wish I knew what to say to you.

1094
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,460
I've seen this happen so many times.

1095
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,520
A young girl rushing into marriage
only to be disappointed in the end.

1096
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,950
What about money?

1097
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,140
We don't have any.

1098
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,550
But who cares?

1099
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,320
You'll find it's not easy
to live poor.

1100
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,280
We have each other.

1101
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,230
That's all anyone can ever need.

1102
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,420
Very well.

1103
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,620
If you're so sure.

1104
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,660
Thank you.

1105
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,980
Good luck.

1106
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,460
We did all we could for them.

1107
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,460
I told him...

1108
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,420
...I had my eye on him
as a possible under-butler...

1109
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,670
...in a year or so.

1110
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,650
But, no, Mr. Charlie knows best.

1111
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,460
She's sure to be let down.

1112
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,490
No use crying over spilt milk.

1113
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,010
Besides, we have far more
important matters to discuss.

1114
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,800
- Next week's meeting. Now-
- Must we discuss it tonight?

1115
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,190
Sorry?

1116
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,390
I'm tired.

1117
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,350
I've had a busy day.
Don't you realize that?

1118
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,120
I'm very tired.

1119
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,580
I'm very, very tired.

1120
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,480
Don't you understand?

1121
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,840
I owe you an apology.
I thought...

1122
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,110
...these quiet evening talks
were useful to our work.

1123
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,930
But now I see that they're
a burden to you.

1124
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,610
I was only saying I was tired tonight.

1125
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,220
No, no. You're right.

1126
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:20,290
Our meetings are a burden
after a long day.

1127
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,590
Perhaps we'd better discontinue them.

1128
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,210
They're useful.
It was only tonight.

1129
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,040
I thank you for the cocoa.

1130
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:31,410
In the future, we shall communicate
only during the day.

1131
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:33,930
If necessary, by written message.

1132
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:36,630
I wish you a very good night.

1133
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:43,360
I shall be taking my day off tomorrow.

1134
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:46,750
I'll be back in the house by 9:30.

1135
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,820
Certainly.

1136
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,580
Certainly.

1137
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:52,170
Good night.

1138
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:29,000
I'm glad to be out of it,
I can tell you.

1139
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:32,680
There was something about Sir Geoffrey
and his Black Shirts...

1140
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:34,770
...gave me the creeps.

1141
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:37,660
Mr. Stevens says we should
run the house...

1142
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:40,400
...and leave the rest
where it belongs.

1143
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:44,070
You don't agree, Mr. Benn.

1144
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:47,930
Nor do I, really.

1145
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:52,590
If I don't like something,
I want to say "stuff it"...

1146
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:55,450
...if you'll pardon the expression,
Miss Kenton.

1147
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:59,900
But then I suppose I'm not
a real professional, like Mr. Stevens.

1148
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:04,620
It's Mr. Stevens' whole life.

1149
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:07,480
Well, it's not mine.

1150
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:09,630
And to tell you the truth...

1151
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:12,210
...I don't want to go back in service.

1152
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:16,520
- What would you do instead, Mr. Benn?
- Tom's the name.

1153
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,220
Tom.

1154
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:23,670
What employment would you take up?

1155
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:26,650
I'd really like to be on my own.

1156
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:31,170
Start a little shop somewhere,
newspapers and tobacco.

1157
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:35,470
Or a boarding house in the
west country, where I come from.

1158
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:38,440
Clevedon's a good place for
a boarding house.

1159
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:40,590
Would I get you another shandy?

1160
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,010
Well, it's almost 9:30...

1161
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:45,690
Go on!

1162
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:47,520
It's your day off, isn't it?

1163
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:50,320
You're not in the army,
due back in the barracks.

1164
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:52,240
- All right, then.
- Good.

1165
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:56,170
Half a shandy, please.

1166
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:13,460
What about yourself, then, Sarah?

1167
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:15,620
That's a serious sort of a name.

1168
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:18,060
They called me Sally
when my mum was alive.

1169
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:19,990
Sally. That's nice.

1170
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:27,380
Is it your intention
to remain in service?

1171
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:30,120
It's a good profession,
when you have a position.

1172
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:33,950
- Mr. Stevens says we're fortunate-
- We're not talking about him.

1173
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:36,300
We're talking about you.

1174
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:38,440
Supposing...

1175
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:43,300
...someone asked if you'd like to come
in on a boarding house by the sea?

1176
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,090
What would you say?

1177
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:48,050
Well, I don't know.

1178
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:51,790
It's a theoretical question,
so I haven't given it any thought...

1179
01:33:52,190 --> 01:33:54,020
- ... Mr. Benn.
- Tom.

1180
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:57,890
Supposing it wasn't theoretical...

1181
01:33:58,990 --> 01:33:59,860
...Sally?

1182
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:04,980
It's been years since I've been
called that. It feels funny.

1183
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:06,530
Nice, though?

1184
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:34,490
It's very late.

1185
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:19,270
Will there be anything else?

1186
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:20,540
What?

1187
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:28,210
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, my lord.

1188
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:44,290
Mr. Cardinal, good evening.

1189
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:46,080
- How are you?
- Very well.

1190
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:49,180
- Delighted. And your wife?
- Very well too, sir.

1191
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:52,230
- How are you?
- Very well, sir.

1192
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:55,880
I've gone and got myself in a bit
of a mess with arrangements.

1193
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:57,950
Would His Lordship put me up?

1194
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:00,020
I'll tell him you're here.

1195
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:02,420
I hope there's nothing special tonight.

1196
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:05,120
His Lordship expects
some gentlemen after dinner.

1197
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:09,180
I'll keep my head down, then.
I've got to write my column anyway.

1198
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,690
- You're in time for dinner, if you like.
- I hoped I would be.

1199
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:14,870
How is my godfather? Fit?

1200
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:17,060
Very well. Some refreshment?

1201
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:19,650
Thank you.
Some whisky would be lovely.

1202
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:23,540
- Who's he expecting tonight?
- I am unable to help you there.

1203
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:24,860
What, no idea?

1204
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:26,860
No idea at all, sir.

1205
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:32,060
- I'll keep my head down all the same.
- I think it's a good idea, sir.

1206
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:35,890
Come in.

1207
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:43,170
Mr. Cardinal has just arrived,
out of the blue.

1208
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:45,380
He'll expect his usual room.

1209
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:49,300
- I'll see to it before I leave.
- You're going out?

1210
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:50,570
I am indeed.

1211
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:51,710
It's Thursday.

1212
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:54,280
Of course. I'd forgotten. Sorry.

1213
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:56,080
Is something the matter?

1214
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:01,730
Some visitors are arriving,
but it doesn't involve you.

1215
01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:04,980
We agreed that Thursday
is my day off...

1216
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:07,530
...but if you need me urgently-

1217
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:10,080
No, it's perfectly all right.
Thank you.

1218
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:15,990
I have something to tell you.

1219
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:19,340
My friend...

1220
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:23,280
...the man I'm meeting, Mr. Benn.

1221
01:37:23,950 --> 01:37:25,850
Mr. Benn. Of course. Yes.

1222
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,480
He has asked me to marry him.

1223
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:38,110
I am thinking about it.

1224
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:40,050
I see.

1225
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:44,040
He's moving to the west country
next month.

1226
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:53,410
I'm still thinking about it.

1227
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:57,510
I thought you should be informed
of the situation.

1228
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,520
Yes, thank you.

1229
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:04,880
That's most kind of you.

1230
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:13,650
I trust you'll have
a most pleasant evening.

1231
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,300
Is there something special tonight?

1232
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:32,360
Are your visitors special?

1233
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,820
Can't tell you, my boy.
Strictly confidential.

1234
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:40,070
- So I can't sit in on it?
- On what?

1235
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:43,840
- Whatever it is that's taking place.
- Absolutely not.

1236
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:48,040
Can't have someone like you sticking
your nose in. A journalist.

1237
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:50,480
What do you call it, a " newshound"?

1238
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:52,790
No, it wouldn't do at all.

1239
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:56,720
Once you've had your food,
you'd better make yourself scarce.

1240
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:00,280
It sounds pretty special to me.

1241
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,210
Good evening, prime minister.

1242
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,530
- Sorry, we've been delayed.
- I understand.

1243
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:35,040
Lord Halifax.

1244
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,700
- Very nice to see you.
- This is Mr. Fraser.

1245
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:52,020
Good evening, Your Excellency.

1246
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:01,270
Please wait here, Your Excellency.
I'll inform His Lordship.

1247
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:53,660
We don't intend to involve
the whole British Empire in a war...

1248
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:57,460
...simply because of a quarrel
in a faraway country...

1249
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:01,160
...between people of whom
we know nothing.

1250
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:04,110
To my mind, the whole
of Czechoslovakia...

1251
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:06,870
...isn't worth a single
one of our own young men.

1252
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:09,590
We have a small, noisy
and corrupt war group here...

1253
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:14,580
...who don't realize that you Germans
are marching into your own back yard.

1254
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:20,370
<i>The Führer is a man of peace
to the depth of his soul...</i>

1255
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:24,260
...but he won't allow
a small second-rate country...

1256
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:28,220
...to thumb its nose
at the 1000-year German Reich.

1257
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:43,970
I'll get it.

1258
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:46,760
Come on, wake up!

1259
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:48,570
Stay awake!

1260
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:59,360
Could you confirm that this lady
is on the staff here?

1261
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:02,500
Yes, of course.
She's the housekeeper.

1262
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:03,960
Thank you, sir.

1263
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:05,980
- May I?
- Of course.

1264
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:07,560
Sorry to have alarmed you.

1265
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,810
Just security, miss.

1266
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,960
I trust you've had a pleasant evening.

1267
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:22,710
Well, did you have a pleasant evening?

1268
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:24,510
- Yes, thank you.
- Good.

1269
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:27,500
Would you like to know
what took place?

1270
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:30,690
I have to return upstairs.

1271
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:33,970
There are important events
taking place tonight.

1272
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:37,480
When are there not?

1273
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:43,270
I accepted his proposal.

1274
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:46,940
I accepted Mr. Benn's proposal
of marriage.

1275
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:48,970
My congratulations.

1276
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:51,090
I am prepared to serve out my notice.

1277
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:54,630
But if you'd release me earlier,
I'd be grateful.

1278
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:58,500
Mr. Benn is planning to leave
for the west country in two weeks.

1279
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,510
I'll do my best.

1280
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:02,940
Now, please excuse me.

1281
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:13,990
After all the years I have been here,
you have nothing else to say?

1282
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,850
You have my warmest congratulations.

1283
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:24,590
You've been a very important figure...

1284
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:26,430
...for Mr. Benn and me.

1285
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:29,100
Oh, in what way?

1286
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:32,460
I tell him all sorts
of things about you.

1287
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:36,000
I tell him stories about you.
About your habits.

1288
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,820
About your mannerisms.

1289
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:42,050
He finds it very funny,
especially when I show him how...

1290
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:45,290
...you pinch your nose
when you put pepper on your food.

1291
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:48,020
That always has us in stitches.

1292
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:55,020
Does it, indeed?

1293
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,120
Well, please...

1294
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,450
...excuse me, Miss Kenton.

1295
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:05,570
Good night.

1296
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:29,370
Thanks.

1297
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,600
We've been friends a long time,
haven't we?

1298
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:39,810
I always look forward to a chat
when I come here.

1299
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,470
Would you care to join me in a drink?

1300
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,920
That's most kind of you,
but no, thank you.

1301
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:46,480
You all right?

1302
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:47,960
I'm perfectly all right.

1303
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:50,160
Not feeling unwell, are you?

1304
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:52,800
A little tired, perhaps.

1305
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:55,660
I bet you're tired.
What is it, about 1:00?

1306
01:44:56,010 --> 01:44:57,080
Come on.

1307
01:44:57,650 --> 01:44:58,950
I want you to sit down.

1308
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:00,670
Well, sir, I really-

1309
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:09,820
I didn't come here by accident.

1310
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:11,240
You know that.

1311
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,980
I had a tip-off, you see...

1312
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:17,320
...about what's going on now
in the library.

1313
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:21,910
I wish you'd sit down.
I'm your friend...

1314
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:25,730
...and you're holding that tray
as if you're about to wander off!

1315
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:27,970
Now, come on.
Sit down, damn it!

1316
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:32,120
That's better.

1317
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:37,940
Now, look, I don't suppose the prime
minister is in the library, is he?

1318
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:39,910
Prime minister, sir?

1319
01:45:41,130 --> 01:45:43,270
In the library-
You don't have to confirm it-

1320
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:47,560
- are our prime minister, our foreign
secretary and the German ambassador.

1321
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:51,640
- Any idea what they're talking about?
- I'm afraid not.

1322
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,470
Tell me, Stevens,
don't you care at all?

1323
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:56,800
Aren't you in the least bit curious?

1324
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:59,890
It's not my place to be curious
about such matters.

1325
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:01,700
Not your place.

1326
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:04,510
And supposing I told you
that His Lordship...

1327
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:06,960
...is trying to persuade
the prime minister...

1328
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:10,500
...to enter into a pact with that
bunch of criminals in Berlin?

1329
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:14,610
I'm certain His Lordship is acting
from the highest and noblest motives.

1330
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:18,230
Don't you see? That's exactly
what makes it so abominable!

1331
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:22,400
Twisting these high and noble
motives to their own foul ends!

1332
01:46:22,770 --> 01:46:26,020
You do, please, realize
that His Lordship's been the most...

1333
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:29,630
...valuable pawn that the Nazis
have in this country...

1334
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:32,620
...precisely because he is good
and honourable?

1335
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:36,050
If I weren't so drunk,
I could make you understand!

1336
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:38,080
Sir...

1337
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:40,230
...I do understand.

1338
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:44,090
His Lordship is working
to ensure peace in our time.

1339
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:47,240
Peace in our time
on their beastly terms!

1340
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:50,070
Remember that American here
at the conference?

1341
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:53,160
Called Lord Darlington an amateur,
out of his depth?

1342
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:54,630
Well, he was right.

1343
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:56,270
He was dead right.

1344
01:46:57,010 --> 01:47:00,410
I hardly have to tell you
how I feel towards His Lordship.

1345
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:04,030
I care about him deeply,
and I know you do too.

1346
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:05,400
Yes, I do indeed.

1347
01:47:05,690 --> 01:47:08,990
Then aren't you desperate
to see him make this mistake?

1348
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:14,240
He's being tricked! Don't you see?
Or are you as deluded as he is?

1349
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:17,960
Oh, dear. Now I've probably
offended you.

1350
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:20,110
No. Not at all, sir.

1351
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,430
Not at all.

1352
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:29,110
You must excuse me.

1353
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:33,420
There are other gentlemen
calling for me, sir.

1354
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:06,250
You mustn't take anything
I said to heart.

1355
01:48:07,850 --> 01:48:10,410
I was very foolish a little while ago.

1356
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:16,830
I haven't taken anything
you said to heart.

1357
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:21,260
In fact, I can hardly recall
anything you did say.

1358
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:23,530
I was just being very foolish.

1359
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:28,850
I simply haven't time to stand here
with you, engaging in idle talk.

1360
01:48:30,850 --> 01:48:33,490
I suggest you go to bed now.
You must be very tired.

1361
01:48:33,850 --> 01:48:35,110
Good night.

1362
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:17,430
Oh, damn it!

1363
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:18,720
Blast!

1364
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:31,070
I'd been wanting to tell you...

1365
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:35,800
It's the small alcove outside
the breakfast room.

1366
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:38,720
It's the new girl, of course...

1367
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:43,100
...but I find it has not
been dusted in some time.

1368
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:48,900
I'll see to it.

1369
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:50,630
Thank you.

1370
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:53,970
I knew you would have wanted
to be informed.

1371
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:39,120
Hello, Sally.

1372
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:40,390
Hi, Tom.

1373
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:42,710
You all right, then?

1374
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:44,300
How are you?

1375
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:45,630
I'm good.

1376
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,870
Could we talk for a moment, please?
Just for a moment.

1377
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:54,380
We'll have to be quick
because I'm going out.

1378
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,100
It won't take long.

1379
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,850
All right, then.
We'll have to go into the lounge.

1380
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,150
Afternoon.

1381
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,750
Nice little place, isn't it?

1382
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:18,050
The sort of quiet little
boarding house I had in mind for us.

1383
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:23,260
Like other things, it didn't work out.

1384
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:25,520
What did you want to say?

1385
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:31,120
I saw Catherine yesterday.
She had some interesting news.

1386
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:34,230
She's expecting.

1387
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,390
Oh, my goodness!

1388
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,260
She wants us both over
for tea on Sunday.

1389
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,280
I could come and get you.

1390
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:50,710
We could go together on the bus.

1391
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,600
Yes, well, we'll see about that.

1392
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,710
House is that empty without you.

1393
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:02,460
I can't tell you.

1394
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,690
You cut yourself shaving.

1395
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:09,540
Oh, yeah. I know.

1396
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,190
Can't seem to do anything right
these days.

1397
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,880
<i>I so often think
of the good old days...</i>

1398
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:26,530
<i>...when I was housekeeper
at Darlington Hall.</i>

1399
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:29,830
<i>Those years with you
were the happiest of my life.</i>

1400
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,650
Would you like more tea?

1401
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,020
Yes, please. Thank you.

1402
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:36,590
Miss Kenton.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Benn.

1403
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,480
- Sorry, I was delayed.
- That's all right.

1404
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,680
Please sit down.

1405
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:46,090
- I've ordered some fresh tea.
- Lovely.

1406
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,200
Would you like some cake?

1407
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:51,050
- Sure?
- All right. It's a special occasion.

1408
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,120
Good.

1409
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:53,870
Waitress?

1410
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,600
- Could we have some cake?
- Yes, of course.

1411
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,200
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, indeed.

1412
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,090
You haven't changed at all.

1413
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:07,570
A little, perhaps.

1414
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,370
We've all changed, I think.

1415
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:11,400
I'd have known you anywhere.

1416
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,710
How long's it been?
Twenty years?

1417
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,410
Yes, just over, I think.

1418
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,920
The tea should be along.

1419
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,590
We read about the suit for libel.

1420
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,450
It's a shame...

1421
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:52,640
...calling His Lordship a traitor.
Those papers will print anything.

1422
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,950
They should have lost the case.

1423
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:58,310
When His Lordship went to court...

1424
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:01,510
...he sincerely expected
he would get justice.

1425
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:06,030
Instead, the newspaper increased
its circulation, and His Lordship's...

1426
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,500
...good name was destroyed forever.

1427
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,850
Afterwards, in his last years, well...

1428
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:15,700
...quite honestly, Mrs. Benn...

1429
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:17,710
...his heart was broken.

1430
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:22,960
I'd take him tea in the library,
and he'd be sitting there...

1431
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:26,540
...and he wouldn't even see me,
so deep was he in his own thoughts.

1432
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:33,190
And he'd be talking to himself,
as though he was arguing with someone.

1433
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:35,590
There was no one, of course.

1434
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:38,040
No one came to see him anymore.

1435
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:42,840
What about his godson,
young Mr. Cardinal?

1436
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:45,460
Mr. Cardinal was killed in the war.
Waitress.

1437
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,400
May I have my bill, please?

1438
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,100
I'm very sorry.

1439
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:03,650
I know you remember Darlington Hall
in its best days...

1440
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:07,990
...and that's how His Lordship
deserves to be remembered.

1441
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:11,500
But perhaps the good days are back,
now that Mr. Lewis is here...

1442
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:13,790
...and Mrs. Lewis is arriving shortly.

1443
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:16,760
Very fortunate to have you
running the house.

1444
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:21,370
We still have problems, Miss Kenton.
I'm sorry. Mrs. Benn.

1445
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,810
- We still have staff problems.
- You mentioned it in your letter.

1446
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:31,310
Frankly, I've been thinking
of going back in service.

1447
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,900
Good-

1448
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,470
But now the situation
has changed for me.

1449
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,250
If I take up any work,
it will have to be...

1450
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:41,690
...here in the west country...

1451
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:46,020
...because Catherine, our daughter,
is expecting a baby.

1452
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:49,950
So I would like to be near her.

1453
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,270
Of course.

1454
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:55,070
And to be near our grandchild
as he grows up.

1455
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:59,650
- Naturally.
- Or her, if it's a little girl.

1456
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,050
When I left Darlington Hall,
all those years ago...

1457
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:13,380
...I never realized I was really,
truly leaving.

1458
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,890
I believe I thought of it
as simply another ruse...

1459
01:58:18,230 --> 01:58:19,530
...to annoy you.

1460
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:24,930
It was a shock to come out here
and find myself actually married.

1461
01:58:25,310 --> 01:58:27,220
For a long time, I was...

1462
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:29,050
...very unhappy.

1463
01:58:30,430 --> 01:58:33,610
But then Catherine was born,
the years went by and one day...

1464
01:58:33,950 --> 01:58:36,090
...I realized I loved my husband.

1465
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:39,530
You see, there is no one...

1466
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:44,190
...no one in the world who needs me
as much as he does.

1467
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:48,030
But still there are times...

1468
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:53,260
...when I think I made a terrible
mistake with my life.

1469
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:58,840
I'm sure we all have these thoughts...

1470
01:58:59,150 --> 01:59:00,450
...from time to time.

1471
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:38,740
People always cheer when they turn
the lights on in the evening.

1472
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:40,210
I wonder why.

1473
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:43,060
They do say...

1474
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:47,510
...that for many people, the evening's
the best part of the day.

1475
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:50,370
The part they most look forward to.

1476
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,560
Is that so?

1477
01:59:54,110 --> 01:59:57,100
What do you most look forward to?

1478
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:03,840
Getting back to Darlington Hall,
principally...

1479
02:00:04,190 --> 02:00:06,530
...and straightening out
our staff problems.

1480
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:09,290
You were always able to do that.

1481
02:00:10,230 --> 02:00:13,220
And you had quite a few
to straighten out, as I remember.

1482
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:19,590
Always was work, work
and more work...

1483
02:00:20,190 --> 02:00:22,910
...and will continue to be so,
I have no doubt.

1484
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:39,280
Mr. Stevens, don't you wait!
That bus is always late.

1485
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:41,310
Come in out of the wet.

1486
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:50,860
You must take good care of yourself.

1487
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:55,390
- You too, promise me that.
- Oh, yes, I promise.

1488
02:00:55,830 --> 02:01:00,240
Do all you can to make these years
happy for yourself and your husband.

1489
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:03,060
We may never meet again, Mrs. Benn.

1490
02:01:03,390 --> 02:01:06,690
That is why I am being personal,
if you will forgive me.

1491
02:01:08,430 --> 02:01:10,260
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

1492
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:13,120
Oh, here it comes.
It's on time for once.

1493
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:37,070
Thank you. And thank you
so very much for coming.

1494
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:39,110
It was so very kind of you.

1495
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:40,770
It was so nice to see you.

1496
02:01:41,190 --> 02:01:44,030
It was a pleasure to see you again.
Goodbye.

1497
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:45,780
Take care.

1498
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:34,250
You scared me.
Where'd you come from?

1499
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:36,850
You like the suit?

1500
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:38,210
Very good, sir.

1501
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:46,910
Good.

1502
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:52,680
Watch the chandelier there.

1503
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:07,000
You're really getting things
going here. This is wonderful!

1504
02:03:08,830 --> 02:03:12,620
I've had to ask another three girls
from the village to come up.

1505
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:16,250
And I can promise you that
the house will be ready...

1506
02:03:16,630 --> 02:03:18,840
...and in shape by the time
Mrs. Lewis arrives.

1507
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:20,870
That sounds good.

1508
02:03:22,150 --> 02:03:24,940
I'm expecting a possible
new housekeeper this afternoon.

1509
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:26,830
A Mrs. Ruth Muspratt.

1510
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:31,740
Excellent references. She was matron
at a boys' school in Sussex.

1511
02:03:32,230 --> 02:03:33,370
A matron?

1512
02:03:35,390 --> 02:03:37,650
Sounds like she'll keep us
from misbehaving.

1513
02:03:37,950 --> 02:03:40,740
- I certainly hope so, sir.
- Good.

1514
02:03:41,110 --> 02:03:42,910
Good, Stevens. Very good.

1515
02:03:43,230 --> 02:03:46,400
This is where we had that banquet
back in '35. Remember?

1516
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:50,300
We all stood up and delivered
ourselves of our principles.

1517
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:54,110
God knows what I said.
Sure got worked up about it, though.

1518
02:03:54,750 --> 02:03:56,580
What did I say, anyway?

1519
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:00,760
I'm sorry, sir,
I was too busy serving...

1520
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:03,020
...to listen to the speeches.

1521
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:10,550
We got a visitor here.

1522
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:13,120
Be very careful.

1523
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:15,410
Come here.
That's a boy. Come on.

1524
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:18,720
Okay. Easy does it.

1525
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:22,620
Come on!

1526
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:27,430
You don't want to startle it.

1527
02:04:28,030 --> 02:04:29,130
It'll come down.

1528
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:35,380
I think if we
leave the window open...

1529
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:42,270
Good.

1530
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:43,940
Very still.

1531
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:46,180
Go on. Out!
Come on. Out!

1532
02:04:47,710 --> 02:04:48,930
Well done.

1533
02:04:52,750 --> 02:04:54,010
Well done, sir.
