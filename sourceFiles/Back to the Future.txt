I never noticed

any blind spot before
when I would drive it.

McFly? It's there.

that wreck out there?

178
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,805
that your insurance
is going to pay
for the damage?

179
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,182
My insurance?
It's your car.

180
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,475
Your insurance
should pay for it.

181
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,102
I wanna know who's
going to pay for this?

182
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,062

all over it when the

Well, I haven't
finished those up yet,

they weren't due till...

want that to happen.

865
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,881
I'm sure that in 1985,

866
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,133
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore,

867
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,969
but in 1955,
it's a little hard
to come by.

868
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,389
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid
you're stuck here.

869
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Whoa, whoa.

870
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:52,145
Doc, stuck here?
I can't be stuck here.
I got a life in 1985.

871
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,313
I got a girl.

872
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:54,439
Is she pretty?

873
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:58,943
Doc, she's beautiful.
She's crazy about me.

874
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:03,323
Look at this. Look
what she wrote here, Doc.
I mean, that says it all.

875
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,160
Doc, you're my only hope.

876
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:11,164
Marty, I'm sorry,
but the only power source
capable of generating

877
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,667
1.21 gigawatts
of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

878
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,003
What did you say?

879
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,254
A bolt of lightning.

880
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,339
Unfortunately,
you never know

881
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,550
when or where it's
ever going to strike.

882
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,428
We do now.

883
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:34,103
This is it!
This is the answer.

884
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:37,273
It says here that
a bolt of lightning

885
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,358
is going to
strike the clock tower

886
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,694
at precisely 10:04 p.m.
Next Saturday night!

887
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,701
If we could somehow
harness this lightning,

888
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,122
channel it into
the flux capacitor,

889
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,209
it just might work.

890
00:54:56,502 --> 00:55:00,755
Next Saturday night,
we're sending you
back to the future!

891

Saturday's good. Saturday's good.

a week in 1955.

00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,303

You can show me around.

out of the question.

You must not
leave this house.

896

or talk to anybody.

with anybody else today,
besides me?

902
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,702

bumped into my parents.

cleaned this place up.

first meeting.

913

If they don't meet,
they won't fall in love,

914

and they won't have kids.

sorry for him

Hi.
Hi.

1220
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,721
Marty, this may
seem a little forward,

1221
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:54,309
but I was
kind of wondering
if you'd ask me

1222
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:58,230
to the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance
on Saturday.

1223
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,111
Wow, you mean...
You mean nobody's
asked you?

1224
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:07,864
No. Not yet.

1226
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,995
George McFly?

1227
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,543
He's kind of cute
and all, but not...

1228
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:24,548
Well, I think
a man should be strong,

for himself

Yeah.

don't understand.

1234
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:46,319
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

1235
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:49,156
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

1236
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,908
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

1237
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,910
She just doesn't
know it yet.

1238
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:54,995
That's why
we got to show her

1239
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,039
that you, George McFly,
are a fighter.

1240
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,041
You're somebody
who's gonna stand up
for yourself,

1241

somebody who's
gonna protect her.

1242
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,879
Yeah, but I've never
picked a fight
in my entire life.

to be picking a fight,

8:55, where are
you going to be?

1248
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:16,141
I'm going to be
at the dance.

1249

am I going to be?

in the car with her.

So, right around 9:00,

she's going to get
very angry with me.

Why is she going to
get angry with you?

1254
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,319

Wrecked?

1722
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,685
When did this happen?
Why wasn't I told?

1723
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:46,769
Quiet down.

1724
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:48,354
I'm sure the car is fine.

1725
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:50,690
DAVID: Why am I always
the last one to know
about these things?

1726
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:53,860
See? There's Biff
out there waxing
it right now.

1727
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:55,695
Now, Biff, I want
to make sure that

1728
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:58,615
we get two coats
of wax this time,
not just one.

1729
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:00,283
I'm just finishing up
the second coat now.

1730
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:02,952
Now, Biff,
don't con me.

1731
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:06,497
I'm sorry, Mr. McFly.

1732
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:09,667
I meant
I was just starting
on the second coat.

1733
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:14,589
Biff. What a character.
Always trying to get
away with something.

1734
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:18,051
I've had to stay
on top of Biff ever
since high school.

1735

Although,
if it wasn't for him...

1736
01:49:20,304 --> 01:49:21,888
We never would
have fallen in love.

1737
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,431
That's right.

1738
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,684
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly,
this just arrived.

1739
01:49:26,769 --> 01:49:29,562
Oh, hi, Marty.
I think it's your
new book.

1740
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:35,985
Honey!
Your first novel.

GEORGE: Like I've
always told you,

1742
01:49:37,196 --> 01:49:40,114
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

1743
01:49:40,199 --> 01:49:42,700
Oh, Marty,
here's your keys.

1744
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:44,577
You're all waxed up,
ready for tonight.

1745
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:46,329
Keys?

1746
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,305
How about a ride,
mister?

1747
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,515
Jennifer.

1748
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:10,603
Oh, are you a sight
for sore eyes!
Let me look at you.

1749
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:14,232
Marty, you're acting
like you haven't
seen me in a week.

1750
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:15,733
I haven't.

1751
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:19,570
You okay?
Is everything all right?

1752
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:23,992
MARTY: Oh, yeah.

1753
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:27,996
Everything is great.

Marty!
You've got to come
back with me!

1757
01:50:47,266 --> 01:50:48,474
Where?

1758
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:49,726
Back to the future.

1759
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,482
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?

1760
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,568
I need fuel.

1761
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:04,449
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

1762
01:51:04,533 --> 01:51:06,576
No, no. Doc,
I just got here, okay?

1763
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,661
Jennifer's here.
We're gonna take
the new truck for a spin.

1764
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:11,998
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

1765
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,666
Wait a minute, Doc.
What are you
talking about?

1766
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:15,793
What happens to us
in the future?

1767
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,628
Do we become assholes
or something?

no, Marty.

turn out fine.

It's your kids, Marty.

got to be done
about your kids.
