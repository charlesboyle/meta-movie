1
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,302
I learnin this letter
that Don Pedro

2
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,371
of Arragon comes
this day to Messina.

3
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,439
He is very near by this,
not three leagues off.

4
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,775
Have any gentlemen
been lost in this action?

5
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,812
But few of any sort,
and none of name.

6
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,748
A victory
is twice itself

7
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,584
when the achiever
brings home full numbers.

8
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,819
I find here that Don Pedro
hath bestowed much honor

9
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,422
upon a young
Florentine called Claudio.

10
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,457
Much deserved on his part

11
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,726
and equally remembered by Don Pedro,

12
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,595
he hath borne himself beyond
the promise of his age,

13
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,198
doing, in the figure of a lamb, the feats
of a lion.

14
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,299
Rarh!

15
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,572
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto
returned from the wars or no?

16
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,574
 I know none of that name, lady.

17
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,675
My cousin means
Signior Benedick of Padua.

18
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,376
O, he's returned

19
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,946
and as pleasant
as ever he was.

20
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,782
I pray you, how many hath he killed
and eaten in these wars?

21
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,650
But how many hath he killed?

22
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,553
For indeed I promised
to eat all of his killing.

23
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,456
Faith, niece, you tax
Signior Benedick too much,

24
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,292
but he'll be meet
with you, I doubt it not.

25
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,596
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

26
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,432
You had musty victual,
and he hath holp to eat it.

27
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,000
He is a very
valiant trencherman,

28
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,668
he hath
an excellent stomach.

29
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,637
And a good soldier too, lady.

30
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,973
And a good soldier
to a lady.

31
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,409
But what is he to a lord?

32
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,745
A lord to a lord,
a man to a man,

33
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,513
stuffed with all
honorable virtue.

34
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,282
It is so, indeed,

35
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,951
he is no less
than a stuffed man.

36
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,621
You must not, sir,
mistake my niece.

37
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,991
There is a kind of merry war betwixt
Signior Benedick and her.

38
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:22,728
They never meet but there's a skirmish
of wit between them.

39
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,465
Who is his companion now?
He hath every month a new sworn brother.

40
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,399
Is't possible?

41
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,901
Very easily possible.

42
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,437
He wears his faith
but as the fashion of his hat,

43
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,939
it ever changes
with the next block.

44
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,877
I see, lady, the gentleman
is not in your books.

45
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,446
No, and he were,
I would burn my study.

46
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,018
But, I pray you,
who is his companion?

47
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,786
Is there no young
squarer now that will

48
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,422
make a voyage
with him to the devil?

49
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,892
He is most in the company
of the right noble Claudio.

50
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,929
O, lord, he will hang upon him
like a disease.

51
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,798
He is sooner caught
than the pestilence,

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,701
and the taker
runs presently mad.

53
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,037
O, God help
the noble Claudio!

54
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,838
If he have caught
the Benedick,

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,740
it will cost him a thousand pound
ere he be cured.

56
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,054
Good Signior Leonato,

57
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,523
You are come to welcome
your trouble.

58
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,691
The fashion of the world
is to avoid cost,

59
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,527
and you encounter it.

60
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,731
Never came trouble to my house
 in the likeness of your grace.

61
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:10,102
For trouble being gone,
comfort should remain.

62
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,905
But when you depart from me sorrow abides
and happiness takes his leave.

63
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,742
 Hmm, you embrace
your charge too willingly.

64
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,784
I think
this is your daughter.

65
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,586
Her mother hath
many times told me so.

66
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,488
Were you in doubt,
sir, that you asked her?

67
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,857
Signior Benedick, no,
for then were you a child.

68
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,526
Truly, truly,
the lady fathers herself.

69
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,928
Be happy, lady, for you are
like an honorable father.

70
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,131
If Signior Leonato
be her father,

71
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,166
She would not have his head on
her shoulders for all Messina

72
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,602
as like him as she is.

73
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,737
I wonder that you would still be talking,
Signior Benedick.

74
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,406
Nobody marks you.

75
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,808
What, my dear Lady Disdain!
Are you yet living?

76
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,177
Is it possible
disdain should die

77
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:56,081
while she hath such meet food to feed
it as Signior Benedick?

78
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,151
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain,
if you come in her presence.

79
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,920
Then is courtesy a turncoat.

80
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:07,526
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies,
only you excepted,

81
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,896
and I would I could find it in my heart
that I had not a hard heart,

82
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,064
for, truly, I love none.

83
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,567
Dear happiness to women,
else would they

84
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,170
have been troubled
with a pernicious suitor.

85
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,740
I thank God and my cold blood,
I am of your humor for that.

86
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:25,777
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me.

87
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,913
God keep your ladyship still
in that mind

88
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,149
so some gentleman or other shall 'scape
a predestinate scratched face.

89
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,717
Scratching could
not make it worse,

90
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,486
an 'twere such
a face as yours were.

91
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,822
Well, you are
a rare parrot-teacher.

92
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,824
Um, a bird of my tongue is better than
a beast of yours.

93
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,592
I would my horse
had the speed of your tongue,

94
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,061
and so good a continuer.

95
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,964
But keep in your way,
God's name, I have done.

96
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,802
You always end
with a jade's trick.

97
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,104
I know you of old.

98
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,177
Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato
hath invited you all.

99
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,580
I tell him we shall stay here
at the least the month,

100
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,915
and he heartily prays some occasion
may detain us longer.

101
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,553
 Lady.

102
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,257
Let me bid you
welcome, my lord.

103
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,559
Being reconciled
with the prince your brother,

104
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,961
I owe you all duty.

105
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,734
I am not of many words,
but I thank you.

106
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,172
Please it your grace
lead on?

107
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,641
Your hand, Leonato.
We will go together.

108
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,018
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter
of Signior Leonato?

109
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,187
I noted her not,
but I looked on her.

110
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,189
Is she not a modest young lady?

111
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,124
Do you question me,
as an honest man should do,

112
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,260
for my simple true judgment,

113
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,595
or would you have me speak
after my custom,

114
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,831
as being a professed
tyrant to their sex?

115
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,901
No, I pray thee
speak in sober judgment.

116
00:08:55,903 --> 00:09:00,272
Why, i' faith, methinks she is too low
for a high praise,

117
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,942
too brown for a fair praise,
too little for a great praise.

118
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,677
Only this commendation
I can afford her,

119
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,145
that were she
other than she is,

120
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,080
she were unhandsome,

121
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,250
and being no other than as she is,
I do not like her.

122
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:16,588
Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me
truly how thou likest her.

123
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,758
Would you buy her,
that you inquire after her?

124
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,326
Can the world
buy such a jewel?

125
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,094
Yea, and a case
to put it into.

126
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,100
But speak you
this with a sad brow?

127
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,037
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady
that ever I looked on.

128
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,776
I can see yet without spectacles
and I see no such matter.

129
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,715
There's her cousin, an she were not
possessed with a fury,

130
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,283
exceeds her
as much in beauty

131
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,719
as the first of May
doth the last of December.

132
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,858
But I hope you have no intent
to turn husband, have you?

133
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,260
I would scarce trust myself,

134
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,228
though I had
sworn the contrary,

135
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,863
if Hero would be my wife.

136
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,268
Is it come to this?

137
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,837
Shall I never see a bachelor
of three-score again?

138
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:12,010
Go ty i' faith, an thou wilt needs
thrust thy neck into a yoke,

139
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,946
wear the print of it and sigh
away Sundays.

140
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,917
What secret hath held you here,
that you followed not Leonato?

141
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,186
I would your grace
would constrain me to tell.

142
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,988
I charge
thee on thy allegiance.

143
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,023
O, on my allegiance?
Mark you this.

144
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,692
On my allegiance
he is in love.

145
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,696
With who? Now that
is your grace's part.

146
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,098
Mark you
how short his answer is.

147
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,171
With Hero,
Leonato's short daughter.

148
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,774
Amen, if you love her, for the lady is
very well worthy.

149
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,409
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.

150
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,144
By my troth,
I speak my thought.

151
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,413
And, in faith,
my lord, I spoke mine.

152
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,383
And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord,
I spoke mine.

153
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,951
That I love her I feel.

154
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,953
And that she is worthy,
I know.

155
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,788
That I neither feel
how she should be loved

156
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,356
nor know
how she should be worthy

157
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,692
is the opinion that fire cannot
melt out of me.

158
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,228
I will die in it at the stake.

159
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,664
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic
in the despite of beauty.

160
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,199
That a woman conceived me,
I give her thanks,

161
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,302
that she brought me up, I likewise give her
most humble thanks.

162
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,805
But that I will have a recheat
winded in my forehead,

163
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,307
or hang my bugle
from an invisible baldrick,

164
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,410
all women shall pardon me.

165
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,946
Because I will not do them the wrong
to mistrust any,

166
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,816
I will do myself
the right to trust none.

167
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,886
And the fine is, for the which
I may go the finer,

168
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,126
I shall see thee, ere I die,
look pale with love.

169
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,262
With anger,
with sickness,

170
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,165
or with hunger,
my lord, not with love.

171
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,035
Well, as time shall try.

172
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,705
"In time the savage
bull doth bear the yoke."

173
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,740
The savage bull may,

174
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,209
but if ever the sensible
Benedick bear it,

175
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,978
pluck off the bull's horns
and plant them in my forehead

176
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,847
and let me
be vilely painted,

177
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,082
and in such great letters
as they write,

178
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,917
"Here is good horse to hire,"

179
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,152
let them
signify under my sign,

180
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,222
"Here may you see Benedick
the married man."

181
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,459
Nay, if Cupid have not spent
all his quiver in Venice,

182
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,794
thou wilt quake
for this shortly.

183
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,062
I look for
an earthquake too, then.

184
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,269
Hath Leonato any son,
my lord?

185
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,741
No child but Hero,
she's his only heir.

186
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,178
Dost thou affect her,
Claudio?

187
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,517
O, my lord, when you went onward
on this ended action,

188
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,452
I look'd upon her
with a soldier's eye,

189
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,087
that liked,

190
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,856
but had a rougher
task in hand

191
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,457
than to drive liking
to the name of love.

192
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,532
and that war-thoughts
have left their places vacant,

193
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:51,302
in their rooms come thronging soft
and delicate desires,

194
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:56,007
all prompting
me how fair young Hero is,

195
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,543
saying, "I liked her
ere I went to wars."

196
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,881
Thou wilt be
like a lover presently

197
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:06,317
and tire the hearer
with a book of words.

198
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,355
If thou dost love
fair Hero, cherish it,

199
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:14,125
and I will break with her and with her father,
and thou shalt have her.

200
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,798
I know we shall have
reveling to-night. Hmm.

201
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,567
I will assume
thy part in some disguise

202
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:26,237
and tell fair
Hero I am Claudio,

203
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,040
and in her bosom
I'll unclasp my heart

204
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,343
and take her hearing
prisoner with the force

205
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,012
and strong encounter
of my amorous tale.

206
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,850
Then after to her
father will I break,

207
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,119
and the conclusion
is she shall be thine.

208
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,531
 What the good-year,
my lord.

209
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:57,001
Why are you thus
out of measure sad?

210
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,170
There is no measure
in the occasion that breeds,

211
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,907
therefore the sadness
is without limit.

212
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,410
You should hear reason.

213
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:09,447
And when I have heard it,
what blessing brings it?

214
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,884
If not a present remedy,
at least a patient sufferance.

215
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,919
I cannot hide what I am.

216
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,627
 I must be sad when I have cause
and smile at no man's jests,

217
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,930
eat when I have stomach
and wait for no man's leisure,

218
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,566
sleep when I am drowsy
and tend on no man's business,

219
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:32,237
laugh when I am merry
and claw no man in his humor.

220
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,873
Yea, but you must not make
the full show of

221
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,608
this till you may do it
without controlment.

222
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,345
You have of late stood out
against your brother,

223
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,146
and he hath ta'en you newly
into his grace,

224
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,115
where it is impossible
you should take true root

225
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,084
but by the fair weather
that you make yourself.

226
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,489
I had rather be a canker
in a hedge

227
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,025
than a rose in his grace,

228
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,129
and it better fits
my blood to be disdained

229
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,131
of all than
to fashion a carriage

230
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,667
to rob love from any.

231
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:11,943
In this, though I cannot be said
to be a flattering honest man,

232
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,479
it must not be denied but I am
a plain-dealing villain.

233
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,952
I am trusted with a muzzle
and enfranchised with a clog.

234
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,289
If I had my mouth,

235
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,129
 I would bite.

236
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,331
Can you make no use
of your discontent?

237
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,936
I make all use of it,
for I use it only.

238
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,014
What news, Borachio?

239
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,052
 I came yonder
from a great supper.

240
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,653
The prince your brother,

241
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,589
is royally entertained
by Leonato,

242
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,125
and I can give you intelligence
of an intended marriage.

243
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,332
 Will it serve for any model
to build mischief on?

244
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:10,034
What is he for a fool that betroths himself
to unquietness?

245
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,138
Marry, it is your
brother's right hand.

246
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,206
Who?

247
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,742
The most exquisite Claudio?

248
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,378
Even he.

249
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,713
A proper squire.

250
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,317
And who, and who?
Which way looks he?

251
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:37,328
Marry, on Hero, the daughter
and heir of Leonato.

252
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,597
A very forward
March-chick.

253
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,169
I heard it agreed upon that the prince should
woo Hero for himself,

254
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:49,173
and having obtained her,
give her to Count Claudio.

255
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,276
Come, come,
let us thither.

256
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,415
This may prove food
to my displeasure.

257
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:01,019
That young start-up hath
all the glory of my overthrow.

258
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,489
If I can cross him in any way,
I bless myself every way.

259
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,661
You are both sure,
and will assist me?

260
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,537
To the death, my lord.

261
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,113
Was not Count John
here at supper?

262
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,481
I saw him not.

263
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,483
 How tartly
that gentleman looks.

264
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:36,421
I never can see him but I am heart-burned
for an hour after.

265
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,323
He is of a very
melancholy disposition.

266
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,126
He were an excellent man that were made
just in the midway

267
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,262
between him and Benedick.

268
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,665
The one is too like an image
and says nothing,

269
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:51,636
the other too like my lady's eldest son,
evermore tattling.

270
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,338
 My troth, niece, thou wilt never
get thee a husband,

271
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,474
if thou be so
shrewd of thy tongue.

272
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,410
O, for the which blessing I am on my knees
every morning and evening.

273
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:07,652
Lord, I could not endure a husband
with a beard on his face.

274
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,187
I had rather
lie in the woolen.

275
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,624
You may light upon a husband
that hath no beard.

276
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,326
What would I do with him?

277
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,627
Dress him in my apparel

278
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,430
and make him
my waiting gentlewoman?

279
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,732
He that hath a beard
is more than a youth,

280
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,669
and he that hath no beard
is less than a man,

281
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,638
and he that is more than
a youth is not for me,

282
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,441
and he that is less than a man,
I am not for him.

283
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,480
I trust you will be ruled
by your father.

284
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:39,283
Yes. Faith, it is my cousin's duty
to make curtsy and say,

285
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,353
"Father, as it please you."

286
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,423
And yet for all that, cousin,
let him be a handsome fellow,

287
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,126
or else make another curtsy

288
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,530
and say,
"Father, as it please me."

289
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:56,634
Well, niece, I hope to see you one day
fitted with a husband.

290
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,437
Not till God make men of some other
metal than earth.

291
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,759
Lady, will you walk
about with your friend?

292
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,811
Well, I would
you did like me.

293
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:50,281
So would not I, for your own sake,
for I have many ill-qualities.

294
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,416
Hmm. Which is one?

295
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,853
I say my prayers aloud.

296
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,823
I love you the better,
the hearers may cry, "Amen."

297
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,030
God, match me
with a good dancer.

298
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,881
 Will you not
tell me who told you so?

299
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,849
No, you shall pardon me.

300
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,651
Nor will you
tell me who you are?

301
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,053
Not now.

302
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,954
That I was disdainful,

303
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,623
and that I had
my good wit

304
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,993
out of
the Hundred Merry Tales..

305
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,997
Well, this was
Signior Benedick that said so.

306
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,865
What's he?

307
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,834
 I'm sure you know
him well enough.

308
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,437
Not I, believe me.

309
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,771
Did he never make you laugh?

310
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,041
I pray you, what is he?

311
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:27,945
Why, he is
the prince's jester.

312
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:31,048
A very dull fool,

313
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,652
only his gift is in devising
impossible slanders.

314
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:37,121
None but libertines
delight in him,

315
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,924
and his commendation
is not in his wit,

316
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,959
but in his villainy,

317
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,029
for he both pleases
men and angers them,

318
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,131
and then they laugh
at him and beat him.

319
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,835
I'm sure he's in the fleet.

320
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,604
I would he had boarded me.

321
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,507
When I know the gentleman,
I'll tell him what you say.

322
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,976
Do, do.

323
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:03,114
He'll but break a comparison or two on me,
which, peradventure not marked

324
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:06,684
and not laughed at,
sends him into melancholy,

325
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,953
and then there's
a partridge wing saved,

326
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,722
for the fool will eat no supper
that night.

327
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,925
We must
follow the leaders.

328
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,061
In every good thing.

329
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,131
Nay, if they lead to any ill,
I will leave them at the next turning.

330
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,523
Are not you
Signior Benedick?

331
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,860
You know me well,
I am he.

332
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,763
Signior, you are very near
my brother in his love.

333
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,500
He is enamored on Hero.

334
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,502
I pray you,
dissuade him from her.

335
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,539
She is no equal
for his birth.

336
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,143
You may do the part
of an honest man in it.

337
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,647
How know you he loves her?

338
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,818
I heard him
swear his affection.

339
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,588
So did I too, and he swore
he would marry her to-night.

340
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,161
Come, let us
to the banquet.

341
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,960
'Tis certain so,
the prince woos for himself.

342
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,237
Friendship is constant
in all other things

343
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:10,140
save in the offices
and affairs of love,

344
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:14,078
for beauty is a witch against whose charms
faith melteth into blood.

345
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:17,982
Count Claudio?

346
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,650
Yea, the same.

347
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,253
Come, go with me.
The prince hath got your Hero.

348
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,124
I wish him joy of her.

349
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,261
Did you think the prince
would have used you thus?

350
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,296
I pray you, leave me.

351
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:35,065
Ho! Now you strike
like the blind man.

352
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,801
'Twas the boy that stole your meat,
and you will beat the post.

353
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,770
If it will not be,
I'll leave you.

354
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,143
Alas, poor hurt fowl.

355
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,747
Now will he creep into sedges.

356
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,657
But that
my Lady Beatrice

357
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,092
should know me,
and not know me.

358
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,261
The prince's fool?

359
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,867
It may be I go under that title
because I am merry.

360
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:13,070
Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong,
I am not so reputed.

361
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,243
It is the base, though bitter,
disposition of Beatrice

362
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,646
that puts the world into her person
and so gives me out.

363
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:25,716
Well, I will be revenged
as I may.

364
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,180
Now, signior, where's the count?
Did you see him?

365
00:26:56,182 --> 00:27:00,951
Troth, my lord, I found him as melancholy
as a lodge in a warren.

366
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,887
I told him,
and I think I told him true,

367
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:08,025
that your grace had got the good will
of this young lady here.

368
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:10,728
The Lady Beatrice
hath a quarrel to you.

369
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,129
The gentleman
that danced with her

370
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,198
told her she is much
wronged by you.

371
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,401
O, she misused me past the endurance
of a block!

372
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,739
She told me, not thinking
I had been myself,

373
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,040
that I was
the prince's jester.

374
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,912
That I was duller
than a great thaw,

375
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,783
huddling jest upon jest with
such impossible conveyance

376
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,052
that I stood like
a man at a mark,

377
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,820
with a whole
army shooting at me.

378
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,091
She speaks poniards,
and every word stabs.

379
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:47,197
If her breath were as terrible
as her terminations,

380
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,700
there would
be no living near her.

381
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,268
She would infect
to the north star.

382
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,139
I would not marry her,

383
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,740
though she were
endowed with all that

384
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,442
Adam had left him
before he transgressed.

385
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,946
Come, talk not of her.

386
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,889
I would to God some scholar
would conjure her.

387
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:15,025
For certainly, while she is here,
all disquiet, horror,

388
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,927
and perturbation follows her.

389
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:21,465
Look, here she comes.

390
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,268
Will your grace command me any service
to the world's end?

391
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,403
I will go on the slightest
errand now

392
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:29,239
to the Antipodes that you can
devise to send me on.

393
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,175
I will fetch
you a tooth-picker

394
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,077
from the furthest inch
of Asia,

395
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,113
bring you a hair off
the great Cham's beard,

396
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,282
do you any
embassage to the Pigmies

397
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:39,883
rather than hold three words' conference
with this harpy.

398
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,921
You have no employment for me?

399
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,225
None, but to desire
your good company.

400
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,462
O God, sir,
here is a dish I love not.

401
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,230
I cannot endure
my Lady Tongue.

402
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,069
Come, lady, come.

403
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,475
You have lost the heart
of Signior Benedick.

404
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:07,311
Indeed, my lord,

405
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,780
he lent it me awhile,
and I gave him use for it,

406
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,517
a double heart
for his single one.

407
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,323
Marry, once before he won it of me
with false dice,

408
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:23,026
therefore your grace may well say
I have lost it.

409
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,130
But you have put him down, lady,
you have put him down.

410
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,832
So I would not he should do me,
my lord,

411
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,367
lest I should prove
the mother of fools.

412
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,973
I have brought Count Claudio,
whom you sent me to seek.

413
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,111
Why, how now, Claudio!
Wherefore are you sad?

414
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,080
Not sad, my lord.
How then? Sick?

415
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,215
Neither, my lord.

416
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:48,519
The count is neither sad,
nor sick, nor merry, nor well,

417
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:51,388
but civil count,
civil as an orange,

418
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,491
and something
of that jealous complexion.

419
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,861
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true,
though, I'll be sworn,

420
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,496
if he be so,
his conceit is false.

421
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,967
 Here, Claudio,

422
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,138
I have wooed in thy name.
Fair Hero is won.

423
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,440
I have broke with her father,
and his good will obtained.

424
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:13,544
Name the day of marriage,
and God give thee joy!

425
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:25,122
Count, take of me my daughter
and with her my fortune.

426
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,925
His grace hath made the match
that all grace say "Amen" to it.

427
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,002
Speak, Count,
'tis your cue.

428
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,443
Silence is the perfectest
herald of joy.

429
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,846
I were but little happy,
if I could say how much.

430
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,952
Lady, as you are mine,
I am yours.

431
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,021
I give myself for you and dote
upon the exchange.

432
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,559
Speak, cousin, or, if you cannot,
stop his mouth with a kiss

433
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,995
and let him
not speak neither.

434
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,136
 In faith, lady,
you have a merry heart.

435
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,005
Yea, my lord.
I thank it, poor fool,

436
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,207
it keeps me on
the windy side of care.

437
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:22,279
My cousin tells him in his ear
he is in her heart.

438
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,382
And so she doth, cousin.

439
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,352
Oh, good Lord,
for alliance!

440
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:32,923
Thus goes every one into the world but I,
and I am sunburnt.

441
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,126
I will sit in a corner and cry,
"Heigh-ho for a husband!"

442
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,395
Lady Beatrice,
I will get you one.

443
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,265
I'd rather have one
of your father's getting.

444
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,900
Hath your grace
ne'er a brother like you?

445
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,534
Your father got
excellent husbands,

446
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,970
if a maid could come by them.

447
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,139
Will you have me, lady?

448
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,343
No, my lord,

449
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:56,313
unless I might have
another for working-days.

450
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:59,549
Your grace is too
costly to wear every day.

451
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,019
But, I beseech
your grace, pardon me.

452
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,688
I was born to speak
all mirth and no matter.

453
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,959
Your silence most offends me,
to be merry best becomes you,

454
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:12,029
for, out of question,
you were born in a merry hour.

455
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:15,065
No, sure, my lord,
my mother cried,

456
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,001
but then a star danced,
and under that was I born.

457
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,538
Cousins,
God give you joy!

458
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:34,051
By my troth,
a pleasant-spirited lady.

459
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:37,187
There's little of the melancholy element
in her, my lord.

460
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:40,557
She is never sad but when she sleeps,
and not ever sad then,

461
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,092
for I have heard
my daughter say,

462
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,994
she hath often
dreamed of unhappiness

463
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:46,029
and waked
herself with laughing.

464
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,531
She cannot endure
to hear tell of a husband.

465
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,166
O, by no means.

466
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,500
She mocks all her
wooers out of suit.

467
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,537
She were an excellent
wife for Benedick.

468
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,508
O Lord, my lord, if they were but
a week married,

469
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,376
they would talk
themselves mad.

470
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,182
County Claudiy,
when mean you to go to church?

471
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,284
To-morrow, my lord.

472
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,419
Time goes on crutches
till love have all his rites.

473
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,122
Not till Monday, dear son,

474
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:13,490
which is hence
a just seven-night,

475
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,392
and a time too brief, too,

476
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:18,161
to have all things
answer my mind.

477
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,631
 I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall
not go dully by us.

478
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:25,335
I will in the interim undertake
one of Hercules' labors,

479
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,705
which is, to bring Signior Benedick
and the Lady Beatrice

480
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:32,342
into a mountain of affection,
the one with the other.

481
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,479
I would fain have it a match,
and I doubt not but to fashion it,

482
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,016
if you three will
minister assistance.

483
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:42,352
My lord, I am for you,
though it cost me 10 nights' watchings.

484
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,121
And I, my lord.

485
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,589
And you too, gentle Hero?

486
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,557
I will do any
modest office, my lord,

487
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,260
to help my cousin
to a good husband.

488
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,764
Benedick is not the unhopefullest
husband that I know.

489
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:57,367
Thus far can I praise him,
he is of a noble strain,

490
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:02,105
of approved valor
and confirmed honesty.

491
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,609
I will teach you
how to humor your cousin,

492
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,044
that she shall fall
in love with Benedick,

493
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,779
and I,

494
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,815
with your two helps,
will so practice on Benedick that,

495
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:15,318
in despite of his quick wit
and his queasy stomach,

496
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,654
he shall fall in love
with Beatrice.

497
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:22,292
If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer.

498
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:26,463
His glory shall be ours,
for we are the only love-gods.

499
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,772
It is so.

500
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,108
The Count Claudio shall marry
the daughter of Leonato.

501
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,212
Yea, my lord,
but I can cross it.

502
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:48,452
Any bar, any cross, any impediment
will be medicinable to me.

503
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:53,457
I am sick
in displeasure to him,

504
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:54,825
and whatsoever comes athwart
his affection

505
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:57,327
ranges evenly with mine.

506
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,833
How canst thou
thwart this marriage?

507
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,378
I think I told your lordship
a year since,

508
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,714
how much I am in
favor of Margaret,

509
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,516
the waiting
gentlewoman to Hero.

510
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,119
I remember.

511
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,689
I can, at any unseasonable
instant of the night,

512
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,424
appoint her to look out
at her lady's chamber window.

513
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:33,196
What life is in that, to be the death
of this marriage?

514
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,632
The poison of that
lies in you to temper.

515
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,907
Go you to the prince
your brother,

516
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,543
spare not to tell him that he hath
wronged his honor

517
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,279
in marrying
the renowned Claudio,

518
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,148
whose estimation
do you mightily hold up,

519
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,919
to a contaminated stale

520
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,722
such a one as Hero.

521
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,726
What proof shall
I make of that?

522
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,664
Proof enough
to misuse the prince,

523
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,435
to vex Claudio, to undo Hero
and kill Leonato.

524
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,608
Look you
for any other issue?

525
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,904
I do much wonder that one man,

526
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,940
seeing how much
another man is a fool

527
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,576
when he dedicates
his behaviors to love,

528
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:55,845
will, after he hath laughed
at such shallow follies in others,

529
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:59,249
become the argument
of his own scorn by falling in love.

530
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,219
And such a man is Claudio.

531
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,987
I have known
when there was no music

532
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,456
with him
but the drum and the fife,

533
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,593
now he had rather hear the tabor
and the pipe.

534
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,294
I have known when
he would have walked

535
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,530
10 mile a-foot
to see a good armor,

536
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,398
and now will he lie
10 nights awake,

537
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,801
carving the fashion
of a new doublet.

538
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:19,803
He was wont to speak plain
and to the purpose,

539
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:22,272
like an honest
man and a soldier.

540
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:26,409
Now is he turned orthography,
his words a very fantastical banquet,

541
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,511
just so many strange dishes.

542
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,749
May I be so converted
and see with these eyes?

543
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,952
I cannot tell, I think not.

544
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:40,457
I will not be sworn, but love may
transform me to an oyster.

545
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,526
But I'll take my oath on it,
till he have made an oyster of me,

546
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:45,462
he shall never
make me such a fool.

547
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:50,300
One woman is fair,
yet I am well.

548
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,602
Another is wise,
yet I am well.

549
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,439
Another virtuous,
yet I am well.

550
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,009
But till all graces
be in one woman,

551
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:01,011
one woman shall
not come in my grace.

552
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:07,317
Rich she shall be,
that's certain.

553
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,019
Wise, or I'll none.

554
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,921
Virtuous, or I'll never
cheapen her.

555
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:15,859
Fair, or I'll never look on her.
Mild, or come not near me.

556
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,895
Noble,
or not I for an angel.

557
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,998
Of good discourse,
an excellent musician,

558
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,669
and her hair
shall be of what color
it please God.

559
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,443
The prince
and Monsieur Love.

560
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,646
I will hide me
in the arbor.

561
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,550
Come,
shall we hear this music?

562
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,918
Yea, my good lord.

563
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,033
Come hither, Leonato.

564
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,536
What was it you
told me of to-day,

565
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:02,339
that your niece Beatrice was in love
with Signior Benedick?

566
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:03,873
I did never think that lady would
have loved any man.

567
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,543
No, nor I neither,

568
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:10,347
but most wonderful that she should so dote
on Signior Benedick,

569
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,783
whom she hath in all outward behaviors
seemed ever to abhor.

570
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:17,821
 Is't possible?
Sits the wind in that corner?

571
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,957
By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell
what to think of it

572
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,961
but that she loves him
with an enraged affection.

573
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,529
It is past
the infinite of thought.

574
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,697
 You amaze me.

575
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,934
I would have
thought her spirit was

576
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:34,471
invincible against all
assaults of affection.

577
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:37,040
I would have
sworn it had, my lord,

578
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,042
especially against Benedick.

579
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,111
Hath she made her affection known
to Benedick?

580
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:44,914
No, and swears she never will,
that is her torment.

581
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,752
'Tis true, indeed,
so your daughter says, "Shall I"

582
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,821
she says,
"that so oft encountered him

583
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:55,759
with scorn, write to him
that I love him?"

584
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,561
 O, she railed at herself, that she
should be so immodest

585
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,498
to write to one that
she knew would flout her.

586
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,000
"I measure him,"
says she, "by my own spirit,

587
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,136
"for I should flout him,
if he writ to me.

588
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,171
"Yea,
though I love him, I should."

589
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,408
Then down upon
her knees she falls,

590
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,010
weeps, sobs,
beats her heart,

591
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,780
tears her hair,
prays, curses,

592
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:19,883
"O, sweet, Benedick!
God give me patience!"

593
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,655
I would she had bestowed
this dotage on me.

594
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,925
I would have daffed all other respects
and made her half myself.

595
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,928
I pray you, tell Benedick of it,
and hear what he will say.

596
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,464
Were it good, think you?

597
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,600
 Hero thinks
surely she will die,

598
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,172
for she says she will
die if he love her not,

599
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:44,140
and she will die,
ere she make her love known,

600
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,209
and she will
die if he woo her,

601
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:50,079
rather than she will bate one breath
of her accustomed crossness.

602
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,815
She doth well.

603
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,650
If she should make
tender of her love

604
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,852
'tis very
possible he'll scorn it,

605
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:59,622
for the man, as you know all,
hath a contemptible spirit.

606
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,724
He is a very proper man.

607
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,861
He hath indeed
a good outward happiness.

608
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:08,665
Before God!
And, in my mind, very wise.

609
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,501
He doth indeed show some sparks
that are like wit.

610
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,738
Well, I'm sorry
for your niece.

611
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,675
I love Benedick well,
and I could wish

612
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,910
he would modestly
examine himself,

613
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,847
to see how much he is
unworthy so good a lady.

614
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,650
My lord,
will you walk?

615
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,952
Dinner is ready.

616
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,062
This can be no trick.
The conference was sadly borne.

617
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,164
They have the truth
of this from Hero.

618
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,701
Love me?

619
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,176
Why, it must be requited.

620
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,212
I hear how I am censured.

621
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,815
They say I will
bear myself proudly,

622
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,283
if I perceive
the love come from her.

623
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,188
They say too that she
will rather die

624
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,956
than give
any sign of affection.

625
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,693
I did never think to marry.

626
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,073
I must not seem proud.

627
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,577
Happy are they that hear their detractions
and can put them to mending.

628
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,980
They say the lady is fair,

629
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,850
'tis a truth,
I can bear them witness.

630
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:37,253
And virtuous,
'tis so, I cannot reprove it.

631
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:41,691
And wise,
but for loving me.

632
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:44,093
By my troth,
it is no addition to her wit,

633
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,195
nor no great
argument of her folly,

634
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,032
for I will be horribly
in love with her!

635
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,574
I may chance
have some odd quirks

636
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,910
and remnants
of wit broken on me,

637
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,646
because I have railed
so long against marriage.

638
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,085
But doth not
the appetite alter?

639
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,154
A man loves
the meat in his youth

640
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,290
that he cannot
endure in his age.

641
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,327
Shall quips and sentences and these paper
bullets of the brain

642
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:19,796
awe a man from the career
of his humor?

643
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:22,665
No, the world
must be peopled.

644
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,937
When I said
I would die a bachelor,

645
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,640
I did not think I should live
till I were married.

646
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,110
Here comes Beatrice.

647
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,848
By this day.
She's a fair lady.

648
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,855
I do spy some
marks of love in her.

649
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,295
Against my will I am sent to bid
you come in to dinner.

650
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:55,698
Fair Beatrice,
I thank you for your pains.

651
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,036
I took no more
pains for those thanks

652
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:02,405
than you take
pains to thank me.

653
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,774
If it had been painful,
I would not have come.

654
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,426
You take pleasure
then in the message?

655
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,998
Yea, signior,

656
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,869
just so much as you may take upon
a knife's point.

657
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,110
You have no stomach, signior.
Fare you well.

658
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,889
"Against my will I am sent to bid you
come in to dinner."

659
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,792
There's a double
meaning in that.

660
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:57,460
"I took no more
pains for those thanks

661
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,195
"than you took
pains to thank me."

662
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,730
That's as much as
to say, any pains

663
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:04,000
that I take for you
is as good as thanks.

664
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,769
If I do not take pity
of her, I am a villain.

665
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,243
If I do not love her,
I am a fool.

666
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,047
I will go get her picture.

667
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,723
No, truly, Ursula,
she is too disdainful.

668
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,125
I know her spirits
are as coy and wild

669
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,193
as haggerds of the rock.

670
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,431
But are you sure Benedick
loves Beatrice so entirely?

671
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,741
So says the prince
and my new-trothed lord.

672
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,876
And did they bid you
tell her of it, madam?

673
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:50,012
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,
but I persuaded them,

674
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:51,380
if they loved Benedick,

675
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:54,417
to wish him
restle with affection,

676
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,918
and never to let
Beatrice know of it.

677
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,054
Why did you so?

678
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:01,491
Doth not the gentleman deserve
as full a fortunate a bed

679
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:03,860
as ever Beatrice
shall couch upon?

680
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,962
 O, god of love!
I know he doth deserve

681
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:08,164
as much as may be
yielded to a man.

682
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,833
But nature never
framed a woman's heart

683
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:12,301
of prouder stuff
than that of Beatrice.

684
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:17,006
Disdain and scorn
ride sparkling in her eyes,

685
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,841
misprising what
they look on,

686
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:21,277
and her wit
values itself so highly

687
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,148
that to her all
matter else seems weak.

688
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:29,051
She cannot love, nor take no shape
nor project of affection,

689
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,319
she is so self-endeared.

690
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,390
Sure, I think so.

691
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,360
And therefore certainly it were not good
she knew his love,

692
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:39,829
lest she make sport at it.

693
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:43,232
No, rather
I will go to Benedick

694
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:46,903
and counsel him to fight against
his passion.

695
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:51,307
Truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
to stain my cousin with.

696
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,044
One doth not know how much an ill word may
empoison liking.

697
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:58,281
O, do not do your cousin
such a wrong.

698
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:01,417
She cannot be so much
without true judgment.

699
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,086
Having so swift
and excellent a wit,

700
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,856
as she is prized to have,

701
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:10,493
as to refuse so rare a gentleman
as Signior Benedick.

702
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,295
He is the only man of Italy.
Mmm.

703
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,164
Always excepted
my dear Claudio.

704
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,275
Come, go in. I'll show
thee some attires,

705
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,411
and have thy counsel which is the best
to furnish me to-morrow.

706
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,285
What fire is in my ears?

707
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,157
Can this be true?

708
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:47,263
Stand I condemn'd
for pride and scorn so much?

709
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,434
Contempt, farowell.

710
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,172
And maiden pride, adieu.

711
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,574
No glory lives
behind the back of such.

712
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,949
And, Benedick,

713
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,220
love on.

714
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,893
I will requite thee,

715
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,331
taming my wild heart
to thy loving hand.

716
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,601
If thou dost love,

717
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:28,104
my kindness shall incite thee

718
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:31,908
to bind our loves
up in a holy band.

719
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,509
For others say
thou dost deserve,

720
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:40,449
and I believe it
better than reportingly.

721
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,092
 I do but stay till your marriage
be consummate,

722
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,194
and then go I toward Arragon.

723
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:53,696
 I'll bring you thither, my lord,
if you'll vouchsafe me.

724
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:56,132
Nay, that would be
as great a soil

725
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:58,100
in the new gloss
of your marriage

726
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,603
as to show a child his new coat and forbid him
to wear it.

727
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,471
I will only be bold with Benedick
for his company,

728
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,006
for, from the crown
of his head

729
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,242
to the sole of his foot,
he is all mirth.

730
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:09,078
He hath twice or thrice
cut Cupid's bow-string

731
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,280
and the little hangman
dare not shoot at him.

732
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:17,553
Gallants,

733
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:24,627
I am not as I have been.

734
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:27,063
So say I,
methinks you are sadder.

735
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,231
I hope he be
in love.

736
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,604
Hang him truant!

737
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,239
There's no true
drop of blood in him,

738
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,375
to be truly
touched with love.

739
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:41,577
If he be sad,
he wants money.

740
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:47,717
I have the toothache.

741
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,654
What?
Sigh for the toothache?

742
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:55,358
Well, every one can master a grief
but he that has it.

743
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,362
If he be not in love
with some woman,

744
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:01,731
there is no
believing old signs.

745
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:04,100
Hath any man
seen him at the barber's?

746
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:07,136
No, but the barber's man
hath been seen with him,

747
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:08,471
and the old
ornament of his cheek

748
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:10,473
hath already
stuffed tennis-balls.

749
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:13,009
Nay, a'rubs himself
with civet.

750
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:15,411
Can you not smell
him out by that?

751
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,413
And when was he wont
to wash his face?

752
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,715
Indeed, that tells
a heavy tale for him.

753
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:22,651
Conclude,
conclude he is in love.

754
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,556
Old signior,
walk aside with me.

755
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:30,059
I have studied eight or nine wise words
that I would speak to you,

756
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:32,661
which these hobby-horses
must not hear.

757
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,472
For my life, to break with
him about Beatrice.

758
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,508
'Tis even so.

759
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,110
Hero and Margaret have
by this played their parts with Beatrice,

760
00:50:48,112 --> 00:50:49,678
and then the two
bears will not

761
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,780
bite one another
when they meet.

762
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,717
My lord and brother,
God save you.

763
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,287
Good den, brother.

764
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,657
If your leisure served,
I would speak with you.

765
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,259
 In private?

766
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:06,128
If it please you.

767
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,331
Yet Count Claudio may hear,
for what I would speak of concerns him.

768
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,542
What's the matter?

769
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:21,544
Means your lordship
to be married to-morrow?

770
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,112
You know he does.

771
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:25,414
I know not that
when he knows what I know.

772
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:34,757
If there be any impediment,
I pray you, discover it.

773
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,162
You may think
I love you not.

774
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:42,631
Let that appear hereafter,

775
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,534
and aim better at me by that
I now will manifest.

776
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,537
Why, what's the matter?

777
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,340
The lady is disloyal.

778
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,778
Who, Hero?

779
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,682
Even she,

780
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:04,653
Leonato's Hero, your Hero,
every man's Hero...

781
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,289
Disloyal?

782
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,559
The word is too good
to paint out her wickedness.

783
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,528
Think you of a worse title,
and I will fit her to it.

784
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,669
Wonder not till
further warrant.

785
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:28,344
Go but with me to-night, you shall see her
chamber-window entered,

786
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,347
even the night
before her wedding-day.

787
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:34,850
If you love her then

788
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:37,786
to-morrow wed her.

789
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,825
But it would better fit your honor
to change your mind.

790
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,429
May this be so?

791
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,433
I will not think it.

792
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:53,669
If you will follow me,
I will show you enough,

793
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,541
and when you have seen more
and heard more,

794
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,777
proceed accordingly.

795
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,402
Are you good men and true?

796
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,204
Yea, or else it were pity

797
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,539
but they should suffer salvation,
body and soul.

798
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,843
Give them their charge,
neighbor Dogberry.

799
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:38,814
First, who think you the most desertless
man to be constable?

800
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,319
Hugh Otecake,
sir, or George Seacole,

801
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,788
for they can write and read.

802
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,890
Come hither,
neighbor Seacole.

803
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:50,326
You are thought
here to be the most

804
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:52,928
senseless and fit man for the constable
of the watch,

805
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,397
therefore bear
you the lantern.

806
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,565
This is your charge.

807
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:02,638
You shall comprehend
all vagrom men.

808
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,708
You are to bid any man stand,
in the prince's name.

809
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,443
How if he will not stand?

810
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,881
Why, then, take no note of him,
but let him go,

811
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:14,617
and presently call
the rest of the watch together

812
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:15,918
and thank God
you are rid of a knave.

813
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,386
If he will not
stand when he is bidden,

814
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:19,455
he is none
of the prince's subjects.

815
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:23,025
True, and they are to meddle with none
but the prince's subjects.

816
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:25,628
Well, you are to call
at all the ale-houses,

817
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,496
and bid those that are drunk
get them to bed.

818
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:29,632
How if they will not?

819
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:31,734
Why, then, let them alone
till they are sober.

820
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,702
If they make you not
then the better answer,

821
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:35,437
you may say they are not
the men you took them for.

822
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,574
Well, sir...
If you meet a thief,

823
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:39,942
you may suspect him,
by virtue of your office,

824
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,477
to be no true man,

825
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:43,946
and, for such kind of men,

826
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,482
the less you meddle
or make with them,

827
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:47,850
why the more
is for your honesty.

828
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:49,551
If we know him
to be a thief,

829
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,287
shall we not lay
hands on him?

830
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:57,359
You may,

831
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,329
but I think
they that touch pitch

832
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:02,431
will be defiled.
The most peaceable way

833
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:05,367
for you,
if you do take a thief,

834
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,336
is to let him show himself

835
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,438
what he is and steal
out of your company.

836
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,475
You have been always called
a merciful man, partner.

837
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,011
Truly, I would not
hang a dog by my will,

838
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:18,547
much more a man
who hath any honesty in him.

839
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,049
If you hear a child
cry in the night,

840
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:23,752
you must call to the nurse
and bid her to still it.

841
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,555
How if the nurse be asleep
and will not hear us?

842
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:29,958
Why, then, depart in peace,
and let the child wake her with crying.

843
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,995
This is the end
of the charge.

844
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,698
If you meet the prince in the night,
you may stay him.

845
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,702
Nay, by'r our lady,
that I think he cannot.

846
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:43,339
Marry, not without
the prince be willing.

847
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:46,775
For, indeed, the watch
ought to offend no man,

848
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:50,379
and it is an offense
to stay a man against his will.

849
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:51,547
By'r lady,
I think it be so.

850
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:57,486
Well, masters, good night.

851
00:55:57,488 --> 00:56:00,422
An there be any matter
of weight chances, call up me.

852
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:01,490
Adieu.

853
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,762
Be vigitant,
I beseech you.

854
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,402
Well, masters,
we hear our charge.

855
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,471
Let us go sit
upon the church-bench

856
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:18,073
till 2:00,
and then all to bed.

857
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:33,922
 What Conrade!

858
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,023
Peace!

859
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,728
Stir not.

860
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,397
Conrade, I say!

861
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:42,998
Here, man,
I am at thy elbow.

862
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,502
Mass, and my elbow itched,

863
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:50,038
I thought there
would a scab follow.

864
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,041
I will owe thee an answer for that.
Now forward with thy tale.

865
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,615
Stand thee close, then,

866
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:03,018
and I will, like a true drunkard,
utter all to thee.

867
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:05,487
Some treason, masters.

868
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:07,890
Yet stand close.

869
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,195
 Therefore know I have earned
of Don John a thousand ducats.

870
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:15,798
Is it possible that any villainy
should be so dear?

871
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:22,504
 I have to-night wooed Margaret,
the Lady Hero's gentlewoman,

872
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:24,072
by the name of Hero.

873
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,723
She leans me out at her mistress'
chamber-window,

874
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,061
bids me a thousand
times good night.

875
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,499
I tell this tale vilely.

876
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,802
I should first tell thee how
the prince and Claudio,

877
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,871
planted and placed
by my master Don John,

878
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:57,873
saw afar off in the orchard

879
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,844
this amiable encounter.

880
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:03,779
And thought
they Margaret was Hero?

881
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,016
 Two of them did,
the prince and Claudio,

882
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:10,185
but the devil my master
knew she was Margaret,

883
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:11,954
and partly by his oaths

884
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:12,988
and partly by
the dark night,

885
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,757
but chiefly by my villainy,

886
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:18,126
away went Claudio enraged,

887
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,830
 swore he would
meet her next morning

888
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,198
and there, before
the whole congregation,

889
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,968
shame her with what
he saw o'er night,

890
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:29,204
send her home again
without a husband.

891
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,940
We charge you,
in the prince's name, stand!

892
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:33,876
Call up the right
master constable.

893
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:36,512
We have here recovered the most
dangerous piece of lechery

894
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:37,179
that ever was known
in the commonwealth.

895
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,147
Masters. Masters...

896
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,883
Never speak.

897
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:43,719
We charge you let us obey you
to go with us.

898
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,098
Troth, I think your other
gown were better.

899
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,137
No, pray thee,
good Meg, I'll wear this.

900
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,243
By my troth, 's not so good,
and I warrant your cousin will say so.

901
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,211
My cousin's a fool.
Thou art another.

902
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,648
I'll wear none but this.

903
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,121
Good morrow, coz.

904
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,890
Good morrow, sweet Hero.

905
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,796
Why how now? Do you speak
in the sick tune?

906
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:03,799
Mmm. I am all out
of other tune, methinks.

907
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:09,071
It is almost 5:00,
'tis time you were ready.

908
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,075
By my troth,
I am exceedingly ill.

909
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:15,944
Heigh-ho.

910
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,113
For a hawk, a horse,
or a husband?

911
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,385
These gloves
the count sent me,

912
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,855
they're an excellent perfume.

913
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:29,825
I am stuffed, cousin,
I cannot smell.

914
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,328
A maid, and stuffed!

915
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,263
There's goodly
catching of cold.

916
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:36,865
By my troth,
I am sick.

917
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:43,372
Get you some of this Carduus Benedictus,
and lay it to your heart.

918
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,009
It's the only
thing for a qualm.

919
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,711
Benedictus!

920
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:55,017
Why... Why Benedictus?

921
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:56,685
You have some moral
in this Benedictus.

922
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,990
Moral? No, by my troth,
I have no moral meaning.

923
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,725
I meant,
plain holy-thistle.

924
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:09,998
There thou prickest her
with a thistle.

925
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,701
 Madam, withdraw.

926
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,003
The prince, the count.

927
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,339
Signior Benedick,
Don John,

928
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,740
and all the gallants
of the town

929
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:19,741
have come to fetch you
to church.

930
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,695
What would you with me,
honest neighbor?

931
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:40,996
Marry, sir, I would have some
confidence with you

932
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:43,165
that decerns you nearly.

933
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:46,435
Brief, I pray you, for you see, it is
a busy time with me.

934
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:47,769
Marry, this it is, sir.

935
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:49,071
Yes, in truth it is, sir.

936
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,442
What is it, my good friends?

937
01:01:53,444 --> 01:01:56,044
Verges, sir, speaks
a little off the matter.

938
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,280
His wits are not so blunt as, God help,
I would desire they were,

939
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:02,117
but, in faith, honest as the skin
between his brows.

940
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:05,053
Yes, I thank God I am as honest
as any man living...

941
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,787
Comparisons are odorous.

942
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,724
Neighbors, you are tedious.

943
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,827
It pleases your worship
to say so, sir,

944
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,795
but we are the poor
duke's officers.

945
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,766
I would fain know
what you have to say.

946
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:19,868
Marry, sir,
our watch to-night,

947
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,170
excepting
your worship's presence,

948
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:26,007
ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves
as any in Messina.

949
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:29,344
 A good old man, sir, he will be talking.
God help us.

950
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:30,912
Well said, neighbor Verges.

951
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,481
An two men ride of a horse,
one must ride behind.

952
01:02:32,483 --> 01:02:33,515
 I must leave you.

953
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:35,784
A word, sir.

954
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:39,421
Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended
two auspicious persons,

955
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,156
and we would have them this morning examined
before your worship.

956
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,427
Take their examination yourself
and bring it me.

957
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,362
I am now in great haste,
as it may appear unto you.

958
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,133
It shall be suffigance.

959
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,503
Drink some wine
ere you go.

960
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,310
Go, good partner, go.

961
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,312
We are now
to examination these men.

962
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,907
You come hither,
my lord, to marry this lady.

963
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,044
No.

964
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,916
To be married to her, Friar.
You come to marry her.

965
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:22,390
Lady, you come hither
to be married to this count.

966
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,327
I do.

967
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,898
If either of you know
any inward impediment

968
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,934
why you should
not be conjoined,

969
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:35,070
I urge you to utter
it upon your souls.

970
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:37,939
Know you any, Hero?

971
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:40,442
None, my lord.

972
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:42,077
Know you any, Count?

973
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,279
I dare make
his answer, none.

974
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:46,081
O, what men dare do!

975
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,451
What men may do.

976
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:54,522
What men daily do,
not knowing what they do.

977
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,894
How now!
Interjections?

978
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:01,062
Why, some may be
of laughing, as...

979
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:17,045
Stand thee by, Friar.

980
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,255
Father, by your leave,

981
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,961
will you with free
and unconstrained soul

982
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:34,629
give me this maid,
your daughter?

983
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,167
As freely, son,
as God did give her me.

984
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,006
And what have I
to give you back,

985
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:49,978
whose worth may counterpoise
this rich and precious gift?

986
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,948
Nothing, unless you
render her again.

987
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,519
Sweet prince, you learn me
noble thankfulness.

988
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:02,090
There, Leonato,
take her back again.

989
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:05,126
Give not this rotten
orange to your friend,

990
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,429
she is but the sign
and semblance of her honor.

991
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,502
Behold how like a maid
she blushes here!

992
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:17,672
Would you not swear, all you that see her,
that she were a maid

993
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:19,274
by these exterior shows?

994
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:21,109
But she is none.

995
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:23,011
She knows the heat
of a luxurious bed.

996
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,082
Her blush is guiltiness,
not modesty.

997
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:29,184
What do you mean, my lord?

998
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:33,455
Not to be married, not to knit my soul
to an approved wanton.

999
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:39,160
Dear my lord,
if you, in your own proof,

1000
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,162
have vanquish'd the resistance
of her youth,

1001
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,464
and made defeat
of her virginity...

1002
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:44,332
I know what you would say.

1003
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,134
If I have known her,
you will say

1004
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:47,535
she did embrace
me as a husband,

1005
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,237
and so extenuate
the 'forehand sin.

1006
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:51,606
No, Leonato,

1007
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:54,209
I never tempted her
with word too large,

1008
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:57,312
but, as a brother
to his sister,

1009
01:06:57,314 --> 01:07:00,782
show'd her bashful sincerity
and comely love.

1010
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:02,550
And seem'd I ever
otherwise to you?

1011
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:05,086
Out on thee! Seeming!

1012
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:07,088
I will write against it.

1013
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,491
You seem to me
as Dian in her orb,

1014
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:12,527
as chaste as is the bud
ere it be blown.

1015
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:16,431
But you are more intemperate
in your blood than Venus,

1016
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:20,502
or those pamper'd animals that rage
in savage sensuality.

1017
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:23,705
Is my lord well,
that he doth speak so wide?

1018
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,340
 Sweet prince,
why speak not you?

1019
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:27,275
What should I speak?

1020
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:28,810
I stand dishonor'd,
that have gone about to

1021
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:30,512
link my dear friend
to a common stale.

1022
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:39,554
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
out at your window

1023
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,322
betwixt 12:00 and 1:00?

1024
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:43,358
Now, if you are a maid,
answer to this.

1025
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,560
I talk'd with no man
at that hour, my lord.

1026
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,429
Why, then are you no maiden?

1027
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:51,466
Leonato,
I'm sorry you must hear.

1028
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:56,304
Upon mine honor, myself,
my brother and this grieved count

1029
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:59,607
did see her, hear her,
at that hour last night

1030
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:02,710
talk with a ruffian
at her chamber-window

1031
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:06,081
who hath indeed,
most like a liberal villain,

1032
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,850
confess'd the vile encounters they have had
a thousand times in secret.

1033
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:11,820
Fie. Fie! They are not
to be named, my lord,

1034
01:08:11,822 --> 01:08:15,223
not to be spoke of.

1035
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:19,160
There is not enough chastity in language
but offense to utter them.

1036
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:25,567
Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy
much misgovernment.

1037
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,169
O Hero.

1038
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:32,207
What a Hero hadst thou been,

1039
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:35,477
if half thy outward graces

1040
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:38,847
had been placed about thy thoughts
and counsels of thy heart!

1041
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,786
But fare thee well,
most foul,

1042
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:47,856
most fair.

1043
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,464
Hath no man's dagger
here a point for me?

1044
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,140
Why, how now, cousin?
Wherefore sink you down?

1045
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,478
Come, let us go.

1046
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,348
These things, come thus to light,
smother her spirits up.

1047
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,623
How doth the lady?

1048
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,925
Dead, I think.
Help, uncle!

1049
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,495
O Hero! Why, Hero?

1050
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:28,363
Signior Benedick.

1051
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:36,838
O Fate! Take not away
thy heavy hand.

1052
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,377
Death were the fairest cover for her shame
that may be wish'd for.

1053
01:09:42,379 --> 01:09:43,845
How now, cousin Hero?

1054
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,380
Have comfort, lady.

1055
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,686
Dost thou look up?

1056
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:54,322
Yea, wherefore
should she not?

1057
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:55,456
Wherefore!

1058
01:09:57,426 --> 01:10:00,795
Why, doth not every earthly thing
cry shame upon her?

1059
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:03,264
Could she here deny the story that
is printed in her blood?

1060
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,802
Do not live, Hero.
Do not ope thine eyes.

1061
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:10,805
Grieved I,
I had but one?

1062
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,474
Chid I for that
at frugal nature's frame?

1063
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:15,910
O, one too much by thee!

1064
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:17,912
Why ever wast thou one?

1065
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:19,647
Why ever wast thou
lovely in my eyes?

1066
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:21,416
Sir.

1067
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:23,484
Sir, be patient.
For my own part,

1068
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:25,920
I am attired in wonder
and know not what to say.

1069
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:29,324
O, on my soul,
my cousin is belied!

1070
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:30,825
Lady, were you her
bedfellow last night?

1071
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:33,828
No, truly not,

1072
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:37,665
although, until last night I have this twelvemonth
been her bedfellow.

1073
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,434
Confirm'd. Confirm'd.

1074
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,736
Would the two princes lie,
and Claudio lie,

1075
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:43,605
who loved her so,
that, speaking of

1076
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:45,440
her foulness,
wash'd it with tears?

1077
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:47,342
Hence from her!
Let her die!

1078
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:50,912
Lady. What man is he
you are accused of?

1079
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:53,248
They know that do accuse me,
I know none.

1080
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,817
If I know more
of any man alive

1081
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:57,518
than that which maiden
modesty doth warrant,

1082
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,587
then let all
my sins lack mercy.

1083
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:07,695
My father, prove you
that any man with me conversed

1084
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:10,298
at hours unmeet or if I
yesternight maintain'd

1085
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,033
the change of words
with any creature,

1086
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:16,304
refuse me, hate me,
torture me to death!

1087
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:23,478
There is some strange misprision
in the princes.

1088
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,014
Two of them have
the very bent of honor.

1089
01:11:26,016 --> 01:11:28,283
If their wisdoms
be misled in this,

1090
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,451
the practice of it
lives in John the bastard,

1091
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,421
whose spirits toil
in frame of villainies.

1092
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:34,722
I know not.

1093
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:41,496
But if they speak but truth,
these hands shall tear thee.

1094
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,767
If they wrong her honor,

1095
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:49,070
the proudest of them
shall well hear of it.

1096
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:51,973
Pause awhile, and let my counsel
sway you in this case.

1097
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,778
Your daughter here
the princes left for dead.

1098
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:59,447
Let her be kept
awhile secretly inside,

1099
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:01,582
and publish it
that she is dead indeed.

1100
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,454
What shall
become of this?

1101
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:09,390
When Claudio shall hear
that she has died upon his words,

1102
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:11,993
the idea of her life
shall sweetly creep

1103
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:14,495
into the study
of his imagination.

1104
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,964
And every organ
of her lovely life

1105
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:19,667
shall come apparell'd
in more precious habit,

1106
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,570
more moving-gentle
and full of life,

1107
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:24,472
into the eye
and prospect of his soul,

1108
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:25,373
than when she lived indeed.

1109
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,643
Then shall he mourn.

1110
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,080
If ever love had
interest in his liver,

1111
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,083
and wish he had
not so accused her,

1112
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:37,919
no, though he thought
his accusation to be true.

1113
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:44,559
Sir, Signior Leonato,
let the friar advise you.

1114
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,095
Being that I flow in grief

1115
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,599
the smallest
twine may lead me.

1116
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,802
Come, lady.
Die to live.

1117
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:59,140
This wedding-day
is but perhaps prolong'd.

1118
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:26,100
 Lady Beatrice, have you wept
all this while?

1119
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,138
and I will weep
a while longer.

1120
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,677
I will not desire that.

1121
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,983
You have no reason,
I do it freely.

1122
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:44,085
Surely I do believe
your fair cousin is wronged.

1123
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:48,456
The man might deserve
of me who would right her.

1124
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,627
Is there any way to
show such friendship?

1125
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:53,928
A very even way,

1126
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,131
but no such friend.

1127
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,904
May a man do it?

1128
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:05,740
It is a man's office,
but not yours.

1129
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,177
I do love nothing
in the world so well as you.

1130
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,752
Is not that strange?

1131
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:24,125
As strange as
the thing I know not.

1132
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:29,030
It were as possible
for me to say

1133
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:30,998
I loved nothing
so much as you.

1134
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,634
But believe me not,
and yet I lie not.

1135
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,705
I confess nothing,
nor I deny nothing.

1136
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,976
I am sorry for my cousin.

1137
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,545
By my sword,
Beatrice, thou lovest me.

1138
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:46,781
Do not swear, and eat it.

1139
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:49,717
I will swear by
it that you love me

1140
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:52,687
and I will make him eat it
that says I love not you.

1141
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,756
Will you not eat your word?

1142
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:58,226
With no sauce
that can be devised to it.

1143
01:14:58,228 --> 01:15:00,261
I protest I love thee.

1144
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,231
Why, then,
God forgive me.

1145
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:07,001
What offense,
sweet Beatrice?

1146
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,636
You have stayed
me in a happy hour.

1147
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:11,772
I was about
to protest that
I love you.

1148
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,510
And do it with all thy heart.

1149
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:20,248
I love you with so much of my heart
that none is left to protest.

1150
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:39,133
Come, bid me do
any thing for thee.

1151
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,805
Kill Claudio.

1152
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,547
Not for the wide world.

1153
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,851
You kill me to deny it.

1154
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,719
Farewell.
Tarry.

1155
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,555
Sweet Beatrice.

1156
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,690
I am gone, though I am here.
There is no love in you.

1157
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:03,925
Nay, I pray you, let me go.
Beatrice...

1158
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,860
In faith, I will go.

1159
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:08,963
We'll be friends first.

1160
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:12,833
You dare easier be friends with me
than fight with my enemy.

1161
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:14,769
Is Claudio thine enemy?

1162
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:18,306
Is he not approved
in the height a villain,

1163
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:21,809
that hath slandered, scorned,
dishonored my kinswoman?

1164
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:25,680
O that I were a man!

1165
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:30,151
What, bear her in hand
until they come to take hands,

1166
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:32,787
and then
with public accusation,

1167
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:36,123
uncovered slander,
unmitigated rancor...

1168
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:39,160
O God, that I were a man!

1169
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:41,262
I would eat his heart
in the market-place.

1170
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,597
Hear me, Beatrice...

1171
01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:44,732
Talk with a man at a window.

1172
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:47,134
O a proper saying.

1173
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:48,102
Nay, but, Beatrice...

1174
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,170
Sweet Hero.

1175
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:54,809
She is wronged, she is slandered,
she is undone.

1176
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,678
Beatrice.

1177
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,015
Princes and counties.

1178
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:05,319
A goodly count. O that I were
a man for his sake!

1179
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:09,957
Or that I had any friend who would be
a man for my sake!

1180
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:14,328
But manhood is melted into curtsies,
valor into compliment,

1181
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,798
and men are only turned into tongues,
and trim ones too.

1182
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,234
For he is now
as valiant as Hercules

1183
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:22,103
who only tells
a lie and swears it!

1184
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:32,246
I cannot be a man
with wishing,

1185
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:38,152
therefore I will die
a woman with grieving.

1186
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,172
By this hand,
I love thee.

1187
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:05,312
Use it for my love some other way
than swearing by it.

1188
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:13,888
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio
hath wronged Hero?

1189
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,390
As sure as I have
thought or a soul.

1190
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,729
Enough, I am engaged.

1191
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:24,198
I will challenge him.

1192
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,475
I will kiss your hand.

1193
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:48,456
By this hand, Claudio shall render me
a dear account.

1194
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,868
As you hear of me,

1195
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,271
so think of me.

1196
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,476
Go, comfort your cousin.

1197
01:19:08,478 --> 01:19:10,244
I must say she is dead.

1198
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,948
And so, farewell.

1199
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,270
What is your name, friend?

1200
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:38,873
Borachio.

1201
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:41,342
Pray, write down, Borachio.

1202
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:43,477
Yours, sirrah?

1203
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,178
My name is Conrade.

1204
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,049
Masters,
do you serve God?

1205
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,953
Yea, sir, we hope.

1206
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,955
Write down, that they
hope they serve God.

1207
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:59,360
And write God first,

1208
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:00,327
for God defend but God should go
before such villains.

1209
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,831
Masters,
it is proved already

1210
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:06,534
that you are little better
than false knaves,

1211
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:08,235
and will go near
to be thought so shortly.

1212
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:10,871
How answer you
for yourselves?

1213
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:12,540
Marry, sir,
we say we are none.

1214
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,379
A marvelous witty fellow,
I assure you, but I will go about with her.

1215
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:20,548
A word in your ear, sir.

1216
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:25,853
I say to you,
you are false knaves.

1217
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:28,189
Sir, I say to you
we are none.

1218
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:31,358
Well, stand aside.

1219
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:35,563
'Fore God,
they are both in a tale.

1220
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,936
Have you writ down,
that they are none?

1221
01:20:41,938 --> 01:20:44,238
Master constable,
you go not the way to examine.

1222
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,240
You must call forth the watch that
are their accusers.

1223
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:47,908
Yea, marry,
that is the eftest way.

1224
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:51,011
Let the watch come forth.

1225
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:54,048
Masters, I charge you
in the prince's name

1226
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:57,952
accuse these men.

1227
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:01,488
This man said,
sir, that Don John,

1228
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:03,457
the prince's brother,
was a villain.

1229
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:11,131
Write down,
"Prince John a villain."

1230
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:13,901
Why, that's flat perjury,
to call a prince's brother villain.

1231
01:21:13,903 --> 01:21:15,169
Master constable...

1232
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:15,970
Pray thee,
fellow, peace.

1233
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,573
I do not like thy look,
I promise thee.

1234
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:21,876
What heard you him say else?

1235
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:25,145
Marry, that he had received
a thousand ducats of Don John

1236
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:27,281
for accusing
the Lady Hero wrongfully.

1237
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:30,084
Flat burglary
as ever was committed.

1238
01:21:30,086 --> 01:21:31,886
Yea, by mass,
that it is!

1239
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,360
What else, fellows?

1240
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:41,996
And that Count Claudio did mean,
upon his words,

1241
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:44,231
to disgrace Hero
before the whole assembly

1242
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,399
and not marry her.

1243
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,167
O villain.

1244
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:52,172
Thou wilt be condemned
into everlasting redemption for this.

1245
01:21:52,174 --> 01:21:53,040
What else?

1246
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:58,412
This is all.

1247
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,984
And this is more, masters,
than you can deny.

1248
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:07,187
Prince John is this morning
secretly stolen away,

1249
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:10,190
Hero was in this manner accused,
in this very manner refused,

1250
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:12,326
and upon this
grief suddenly died.

1251
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:18,265
Master constable, let these men be bound,
and brought to Leonato.

1252
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:21,068
I will go before and show him
their examination.

1253
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:22,403
Come, let them
be opinioned.

1254
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:23,170
Let them be
in the hands...

1255
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:24,605
Off, coxcomb!

1256
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:26,340
God's my life,
where's the sexton?

1257
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:28,642
Let her write down
the prince's officer coxcomb.

1258
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:30,177
Come, bind them.

1259
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,579
Thou naughty varlet!

1260
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,348
Away! You are an ass!

1261
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,418
You are an ass.

1262
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:46,593
Dost thou not
suspect my place?

1263
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:50,431
Dost thou not
suspect my years?

1264
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,310
O that she were here
to write me down an ass.

1265
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:08,148
But, masters,
remember that I am an ass,

1266
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,417
though it be not
written down,

1267
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:12,319
yet forget not
that I am an ass.

1268
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:17,458
Thou villain,
thou art full of piety,

1269
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:21,395
as shall be proved
upon thee by good witness.

1270
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:24,365
I am a wise fellow,
and, which is more, an officer,

1271
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:26,400
and, which is more,
a householder,

1272
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:29,670
and, which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh
as any is in Messina,

1273
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,541
and one that
knows the law, go to.

1274
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:37,411
And a rich
fellow enough, go to.

1275
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:40,047
And a fellow
that hath had losses,

1276
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:43,217
and one that hath two gowns and every thing
handsome about him!

1277
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:50,324
O that I had been
writ down an ass!

1278
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:07,608
Now, signior,
what news?

1279
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,046
Good day, my lord.

1280
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:14,448
We've been up and
down to seek thee,

1281
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:17,117
for we are
high-proof melancholy

1282
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:18,652
and would fain
have it beaten away.

1283
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,056
Wilt thou use
thy wit?

1284
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:23,123
It is in my scabbard,
shall I draw it?

1285
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:27,461
Dost thou wear thy
wit by thy side?

1286
01:24:27,463 --> 01:24:30,664
Never any did so, though very many have been
beside their wit.

1287
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,301
I will bid thee draw,

1288
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:35,803
as we do the minstrels,
draw, to pleasure us.

1289
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,841
As I'm an honest man,
he looks pale.

1290
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:42,810
Art thou sick,
or angry?

1291
01:24:42,812 --> 01:24:44,078
What, courage, man!

1292
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:49,583
What though care killed
a cat thou hast mettle in thee to kill care.

1293
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:52,086
But when shall we set
the savage bull's horns

1294
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:54,188
on the sensible
Benedick's head?

1295
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:57,758
Yea, and text underneath,
"Here dwells Benedick the married man"?

1296
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,761
Shall I speak
a word in your ear?

1297
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:01,762
God bless me
from a challenge.

1298
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:07,267
You are a villain.
I jest not.

1299
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,270
I will make it
good how you dare,

1300
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:14,141
with what you dare,
and when you dare.

1301
01:25:14,143 --> 01:25:16,443
Do me right, or I will
protest your cowardice.

1302
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:22,516
Well, I will meet you,
so I may have good cheer.

1303
01:25:22,518 --> 01:25:25,419
My lord, for your
many courtesies, I thank you.

1304
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:27,788
I must discontinue
your company.

1305
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:31,458
Your brother the bastard
is fled from Messina.

1306
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,328
You have among
you killed a sweet and innocent lady.

1307
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:40,200
For my Lord Lackbeard,
there, he and I shall meet.

1308
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,837
And, till then,
peace be with you.

1309
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,443
Did he not say,
my brother was fled?

1310
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:03,790
Officers, what offense
have these men done?

1311
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:06,260
Marry, sir, they have
committed false report.

1312
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:07,928
Moreover, they have
spoken untruths.

1313
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:09,796
Secondarily,
they are slanders.

1314
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:13,300
Sixth and lastly,
they have belied a lady.

1315
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:15,402
Thirdly, they have
verified unjust things,

1316
01:26:15,404 --> 01:26:17,738
and, to conclude,
they are lying knaves.

1317
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,473
This learned constable
is too cunning to be understood.

1318
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:21,208
What's your offense?

1319
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:24,411
Sweet Prince, let me go
no farther to mine answer.

1320
01:26:24,413 --> 01:26:26,747
Do you hear me,
and let this count kill me.

1321
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,951
I have deceived
even your very eyes.

1322
01:26:30,953 --> 01:26:32,586
What your wisdoms
could not discover,

1323
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:34,755
these shallow fools
have brought to light.

1324
01:26:34,757 --> 01:26:36,590
Who overheard me confessing
how your brother incensed me

1325
01:26:36,592 --> 01:26:38,458
to slander the Lady Hero,

1326
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,729
how you saw me
court Margaret in Hero's garments,

1327
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:45,265
how you disgraced her.

1328
01:26:45,267 --> 01:26:47,401
My villainy they
have upon record,

1329
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:49,236
which I had rather seal
with my death than repeat over to my shame.

1330
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,675
Runs not this speech like iron through
your blood?

1331
01:26:54,677 --> 01:26:57,678
I have drunk poison
whiles he utter'd it.

1332
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,681
Come, bring away
the plaintiffs,

1333
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:03,684
and, masters, do not forget
to specify,

1334
01:27:03,686 --> 01:27:06,286
when time and place shall serve,
that I am an ass.

1335
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,595
Which is the villain?

1336
01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:16,964
Let me see his eyes, that, when I note
another man like him,

1337
01:27:16,966 --> 01:27:19,533
I may avoid him.
Which of these is he?

1338
01:27:19,535 --> 01:27:21,835
If you would know
your wronger, look on me.

1339
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,808
Art thou the slave
that with thy breath

1340
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:28,942
hast kill'd mine
innocent child?

1341
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:31,745
Yea, even I alone.

1342
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:35,882
No, not so, villain.

1343
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,920
Here stann*k pair
of honorable men,

1344
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:42,889
a third is fled,
that had a hand in it.

1345
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:46,526
I thank you, Princes,
for my daughter's death.

1346
01:27:46,528 --> 01:27:49,429
Record it with thy
high and worthy deeds.

1347
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,732
'Twas bravely done,
if you bethink you of it.

1348
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,704
I know not how to pray your patience,
yet I must speak.

1349
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:03,510
Choose your
revenge yourself,

1350
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:07,314
impose on me what penance your invention
can lay upon my sin,

1351
01:28:07,316 --> 01:28:09,016
yet sinn'd I not
but in mistaking.

1352
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,019
By my soul, nor I.

1353
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:16,690
And to satisfy
this good old man,

1354
01:28:16,692 --> 01:28:20,927
I would bend under any heavy weight
that he'll enjoin me to.

1355
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:22,996
I cannot bid you
bid my daughter live.

1356
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,767
That were impossible.

1357
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,738
But, I pray you both,

1358
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:34,708
possess the people in Messina here
how innocent she died,

1359
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:40,047
and if your love can labor
ought in sad invention,

1360
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:42,049
hang her an epitaph
upon her tomb

1361
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:44,918
and sing it to her bones.

1362
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:47,587
Sing it to-night.

1363
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:53,393
To-morrow morning
come you to my house,

1364
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:01,034
for since you could not be my son-in-law,
be yet my nephew.

1365
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,705
My brother hath a daughter,

1366
01:29:04,707 --> 01:29:07,007
almost the copy of
my child that's dead,

1367
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:10,744
and she alone is
heir to both of us.

1368
01:29:10,746 --> 01:29:13,380
Give her the right
you should have given her cousin,

1369
01:29:14,816 --> 01:29:16,750
and so dies my revenge.

1370
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:22,689
I do embrace your offer

1371
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:25,025
and dispose for henceforth
of poor Claudio.

1372
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:32,766
This naughty man shall face to face
be brought to Margaret,

1373
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:34,768
who I believe was
pack'd in all this wrong,

1374
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,802
hired to it by
your brother.

1375
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:37,637
No.

1376
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:40,073
By my soul, she was not,

1377
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:42,442
nor knew not what she did
when she spoke to me.

1378
01:29:42,444 --> 01:29:44,945
But always hath been just and virtuous in
any thing I do know by her.

1379
01:29:44,947 --> 01:29:45,846
Moreover, sir.

1380
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:50,417
Although it be not
under white and black,

1381
01:29:50,419 --> 01:29:53,887
this plaintiff here, the offender,
did call me ass.

1382
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:57,157
I beseech you, let it be
remembered in her punishment.

1383
01:29:57,159 --> 01:30:00,127
I thank thee for thy
care and honest pains.

1384
01:30:00,129 --> 01:30:03,397
God keep your worship.
I humbly give you leave to depart,

1385
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:04,765
and should a merry
meeting be wished,

1386
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:07,801
God prohibit it.

1387
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:11,872
Come, neighbor.

1388
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:21,548
Until to-morrow morning,
lords, farewell.

1389
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:22,849
We will not fail.

1390
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,155
Bring you these
fellows on.

1391
01:32:09,558 --> 01:32:11,691
Pray thee, Mistress Margaret,
deserve well at my hands

1392
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:13,059
by helping me to the speech
of Beatrice.

1393
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:25,305
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise
of my beauty?

1394
01:32:25,307 --> 01:32:30,110
In so high a style, Margaret, that no man
living shall come over it,

1395
01:32:30,112 --> 01:32:32,145
for, in most comely
truth, thou deservest it.

1396
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:38,251
To have no man
come over me.

1397
01:32:38,253 --> 01:32:40,987
Why, shall I always
keep below stairs?

1398
01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:43,223
Thy wit is as quick
as the greyhound's mouth,

1399
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:45,191
it catches.

1400
01:32:45,193 --> 01:32:48,562
And yours as blunt
as the fencer's foils,

1401
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:51,197
which hit, but hurt not.

1402
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:54,000
A most manly wit, Margaret,
it will not hurt a woman.

1403
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:59,306
So, I pray thee, call Beatrice.
I give thee bucklers.

1404
01:33:02,009 --> 01:33:05,111
Give us the swords,
we have bucklers of our own.

1405
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:21,628
The god of love sits above

1406
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:24,831
Knows me, and knows me

1407
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:27,801
How pitiful I deserve... 

1408
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:32,272
I mean in singing.

1409
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:38,211
But in loving, Leander
the good swimmer,

1410
01:33:38,213 --> 01:33:40,847
Troilus the first
employer of panders,

1411
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:42,983
why, they were never
so truly turned over

1412
01:33:42,985 --> 01:33:44,751
and over as my
poor self in love.

1413
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:50,323
Marry, I cannot show
it in rhyme, I have tried.

1414
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:55,695
I can find out no rhyme
to "lady" but "baby,"

1415
01:33:57,098 --> 01:34:00,934
an innocent rhyme.
For "scorn," "horn,"

1416
01:34:00,936 --> 01:34:04,137
a hard rhyme.
For "school," "fool,"

1417
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:07,207
a babbling rhyme.
Very ominous endings.

1418
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:12,779
No, I was not born
under a rhyming planet.

1419
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:16,249
Nor I cannot woo
in festival terms.

1420
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:25,859
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come
when I called thee?

1421
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:28,728
Yea, signior, and depart
when you bid me.

1422
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:30,997
O, stay but till then!

1423
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,899
"Then" is spoken,
fare you well now.

1424
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:35,368
And yet, ere I go.

1425
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:41,041
Let me go with that I came,

1426
01:34:41,043 --> 01:34:44,144
which is, knowing what hath passed
between you and Claudio.

1427
01:34:44,146 --> 01:34:46,913
Only foul words, and thereupon I
will kiss thee.

1428
01:34:46,915 --> 01:34:49,916
Foul words is but foul wind,
and foul wind is but foul breath,

1429
01:34:49,918 --> 01:34:54,254
and foul breath is noisome,
therefore I will depart unkissed.

1430
01:34:54,256 --> 01:34:56,790
Thou hast frighted
the word out of his right sense,

1431
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:59,292
so forcible is thy wit.

1432
01:34:59,294 --> 01:35:03,797
But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio
undergoes my challenge

1433
01:35:03,799 --> 01:35:05,398
and either I will
shortly hear from him,

1434
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,467
or I will subscribe
him a coward.

1435
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:15,375
And, I pray thee, now,

1436
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:18,044
tell me for which
of my bad parts

1437
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:19,446
didst thou first
fall in love with me?

1438
01:35:20,748 --> 01:35:23,149
For them all together,

1439
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:26,286
which maintained so
politic a state of evil

1440
01:35:26,288 --> 01:35:31,257
that they would not admit any good part
to intermingle with them.

1441
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:35,095
But for which of my good parts did you first
suffer love for me?

1442
01:35:35,097 --> 01:35:36,863
Suffer love!
A good epithet!

1443
01:35:36,865 --> 01:35:39,499
I do suffer love, indeed,

1444
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:42,335
for I love thee
against my will.

1445
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:45,238
In spite of
your heart, I think.

1446
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,341
If you will spite it for my sake,
I will spite it for yours,

1447
01:35:48,343 --> 01:35:51,344
for I could never love
that which my friend hates.

1448
01:35:51,346 --> 01:35:53,813
Thou and I are too
wise to woo peaceably.

1449
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:58,284
I pray thee, now tell me,
how doth your cousin?

1450
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:01,521
Very ill.

1451
01:36:01,523 --> 01:36:02,956
And how do you?

1452
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,425
Very ill, too.

1453
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:14,134
Serve God,
love me, and mend.

1454
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:18,538
Madam, you must
come to your uncle!

1455
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,807
It is proved my Lady Hero
hath been falsely accused,

1456
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,310
the prince and Claudio
mightily abused,

1457
01:36:24,312 --> 01:36:27,280
and Don John is the author of all,
who's fled and gone.

1458
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,849
Will you come presently?

1459
01:36:29,851 --> 01:36:31,551
Will you come
hear this news, signior?

1460
01:36:31,553 --> 01:36:33,553
I will live in thy heart,

1461
01:36:33,555 --> 01:36:36,156
die in thy lap, and be buried
in thy eyes,

1462
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:38,091
and, moreover,
I will go with thee.

1463
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,231
Did I not tell you
she was innocent?

1464
01:36:45,233 --> 01:36:46,933
So are the prince
and Claudio,

1465
01:36:46,935 --> 01:36:50,470
who accused her upon the error
that you heard debated.

1466
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:54,908
But Margaret was in some fault for this,
although against her will,

1467
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:57,010
as it appears in the true course
of all the question.

1468
01:36:57,012 --> 01:36:59,145
Well.

1469
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:01,214
I am glad that all
things sort so well.

1470
01:37:01,216 --> 01:37:03,817
Friar, I must entreat
your pains, I think.

1471
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:05,051
To do what, signior?

1472
01:37:05,053 --> 01:37:08,221
To bind me, or undo me,
one of them.

1473
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:13,593
Signior Leonato,
truth it is, good sir,

1474
01:37:13,595 --> 01:37:16,396
your niece regards me
with an eye of favor.

1475
01:37:16,398 --> 01:37:20,133
That eye my daughter
lent her 'tis most true.

1476
01:37:20,135 --> 01:37:22,502
And I do with an eye
of love requite her.

1477
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:25,004
The sight whereof
I think you had from me,

1478
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,306
from Claudio, and the prince.

1479
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,410
But what's your will?

1480
01:37:30,412 --> 01:37:32,912
Your answer, sir,
is enigmatical.

1481
01:37:32,914 --> 01:37:36,583
For my will, my will is your good will
may stand with ours

1482
01:37:36,585 --> 01:37:40,954
in this day to be conjoin'd in the state
of honorable marriage.

1483
01:37:43,123 --> 01:37:45,592
In which, dear Friar,
I shall entreat your pains.

1484
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:10,483
Good morrow to
this fair assembly.

1485
01:38:10,485 --> 01:38:12,518
Good morrow, Prince.
Good morrow, Claudio.

1486
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,455
We here attend you.

1487
01:38:15,457 --> 01:38:17,490
Are you yet determined to-day to marry with my
brother's daughter?

1488
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:21,561
I'll hold my mind,
were she an Ethiope.

1489
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,065
Come forth.

1490
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:29,335
Here's the friar. Ready.

1491
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:34,173
Which is the lady
I must seize upon?

1492
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:35,074
This same is she,

1493
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:38,244
and I do give you her.

1494
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:42,081
Why, then she's mine.

1495
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:45,618
Sweet, let me
see your face.

1496
01:38:48,355 --> 01:38:51,991
No, that you
shall not,

1497
01:38:51,993 --> 01:38:54,661
till you take her hand before this friar
and swear to marry her.

1498
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:02,001
Give me your hand.

1499
01:39:08,642 --> 01:39:10,443
Before this holy friar,

1500
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,415
I am your husband,
if you like of me.

1501
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:19,185
And when I lived,
I was your other wife.

1502
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:30,663
And when you loved,
you were my other husband.

1503
01:39:32,232 --> 01:39:33,466
Another Hero!

1504
01:39:34,568 --> 01:39:35,468
Nothing certainer.

1505
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:40,974
One Hero died defiled,
but I do live,

1506
01:39:40,976 --> 01:39:42,542
and surely as I live,

1507
01:39:44,244 --> 01:39:45,478
I am a maid.

1508
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:50,717
The former Hero?
Hero that is dead?

1509
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:55,054
 She died, my lord, but whiles
her slander lived.

1510
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:01,361
 All this amazement can I qualify.

1511
01:40:01,363 --> 01:40:03,663
When after that
the holy rites are ended,

1512
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:06,332
I'll tell you largely
of fair Hero's death.

1513
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,334
Meantime let wonder
seem familiar,

1514
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:11,270
and to the chapel
let us presently.

1515
01:40:11,272 --> 01:40:12,271
Soft and fair, friar.

1516
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:14,640
Which is Beatrice?

1517
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:21,014
I answer to
that name.

1518
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:24,484
What is your will?

1519
01:40:37,097 --> 01:40:38,464
Do not you love me?

1520
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:41,467
Why, no,

1521
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:46,239
no more than reason.

1522
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:49,575
Why, then your uncle
and the prince and Claudio

1523
01:40:49,577 --> 01:40:51,344
have been deceived.
They swore you did.

1524
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:53,046
Do not you love me?

1525
01:40:53,048 --> 01:40:55,782
Troth, no, no more
than reason.

1526
01:40:55,784 --> 01:40:59,519
Why, then my cousin Margaret
and Ursula are much deceived,

1527
01:40:59,521 --> 01:41:01,387
for they did swear
you did.

1528
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:03,589
They swore you were
almost sick for me.

1529
01:41:03,591 --> 01:41:06,459
Well, they swore
that you were well-nigh dead for me.

1530
01:41:06,461 --> 01:41:08,061
'Tis no such matter.

1531
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:11,197
Then you do not love me?

1532
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:14,267
No,

1533
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:19,772
truly, but in
friendly recompense.

1534
01:41:24,278 --> 01:41:26,412
I am sure you
love the gentleman.

1535
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:31,584
And I'll be sworn upon
it that he loves her,

1536
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:34,654
for here's a paper
written in his hand,

1537
01:41:34,656 --> 01:41:37,356
a halting sonnet of
his own pure brain,

1538
01:41:37,358 --> 01:41:39,092
fashion'd to Beatrice.

1539
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:46,766
And here's another writ
in my cousin's hand,

1540
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:50,303
stolen from her pocket, containing her
affection unto Benedick.

1541
01:42:02,382 --> 01:42:04,851
A miracle.

1542
01:42:04,853 --> 01:42:06,719
Here's our own hands
against our hearts.

1543
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:09,722
Come, I'll have thee,

1544
01:42:11,492 --> 01:42:14,560
but, by this light,
I take thee for pity.

1545
01:42:14,562 --> 01:42:18,297
O, I would not deny you,

1546
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:22,768
but, by this good day,
I yield upon great persuasion

1547
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:27,140
and partly to save your life, for I was told you
were in a consumption.

1548
01:42:27,142 --> 01:42:29,375
Peace. I will stop
your mouth.

1549
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:45,892
How dost thou,
Benedick the married man?

1550
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:51,330
I'll tell thee
what, Prince,

1551
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:54,567
a college of wit-crackers
cannot flout me out of my humor.

1552
01:42:54,569 --> 01:42:56,636
Thinkest thou I care for a satire
or an epigram?

1553
01:42:56,638 --> 01:42:59,939
No, since I do
purpose to marry,

1554
01:42:59,941 --> 01:43:01,574
I will think nothing
to any purpose

1555
01:43:01,576 --> 01:43:03,476
that the world
can say against it,

1556
01:43:03,478 --> 01:43:05,645
and therefore
never flout at me

1557
01:43:05,647 --> 01:43:06,779
for what I have
said against it,

1558
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:09,482
for man is a giddy thing,

1559
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:12,285
and this is my conclusion.

1560
01:43:13,387 --> 01:43:15,421
My lord.

1561
01:43:15,423 --> 01:43:17,590
Your brother John
is ta'en in flight,

1562
01:43:17,592 --> 01:43:19,659
and brought with armed
men back to Messina.

1563
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:23,396
Think not on him
till to-morrow.

1564
01:43:23,398 --> 01:43:25,865
I'll devise thee
brave punishments for him.

1565
01:43:26,934 --> 01:43:30,570
Let's dance ere
we are married,

1566
01:43:30,572 --> 01:43:33,806
that it may lighten our
hearts and our wives' heels.

1567
01:43:33,808 --> 01:43:35,508
We'll have
dancing afterward.

1568
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:38,578
First, upon my word.
Therefore, play, music.

1569
01:43:45,452 --> 01:43:46,619
Prince, thou art sad.

1570
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:52,325
Get thee a wife,
get thee a wife.
