1
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,259
There was no one like Hal.

2
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,061
He met me at a party
and swept me off my feet.

3
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,764
"Blue Moon" was playing.

4
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,474
You know "Blue Moon?"
Sure.

5
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,026
I still remember that.
Oh.

6
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,694
<i>♪ Blue moon ♪♪</i>

7
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,153
And one more year
and I would have graduated.

8
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,202
But I quit BU to marry him. I mean,
what was I learning at school anyway?

9
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,451
I mean, can you picture me
as an anthropologist?

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,992
Is that a joke?

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,545
The sex was always great. Well,
he was nine years older than me.

12
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,748
He'd already made
and lost a fortune.

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,005
But then he made it back,
and more. I mean, much more.

14
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,506
God, he was dynamic.

15
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,430
Taught me everything I know
about real lovemaking,

16
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,850
not that I care to get too graphic.

17
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,270
Believe me when I tell you.
They tried six medications on me.

18
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,097
Cocktails, they call them.

19
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,899
The only cocktail that helped
was a Stoli martini.

20
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,351
I never trusted doctors.

21
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,187
Doctors put both my parents
in early graves.

22
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,238
I have never
been to San Francisco.

23
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,443
And Hal and I traveled everywhere.
I hear it's beautiful.

24
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,495
I'll be staying with my sister,
Ginger. She's divorced.

25
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,916
Biologically, she's not my sister.
She's adopted. <i>We're</i> both adopted.

26
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,869
I couldn't stand her ex-husband.
He used to hit her.

27
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,046
That's mine. The Vuitton.

28
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,125
My plan is to start a new life out here.
Hm.

29
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,961
Put everything behind me
and start fresh.

30
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,390
Go West. Was it Horace Greeley
who said that? "Go West."

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,890
Oh, there's my family.
It was really nice talking to you.

32
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,688
Oh, I'll call you,
maybe for lunch.

33
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,232
I don't have your number.

34
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:07,275
Who's that woman you were talking to?
I was sitting next to her on the plane.

35
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,901
She was talking to herself.

36
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,780
I thought she said something to me.
I said, "What?"

37
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,987
But she couldn't stop
babbling about her life.

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,673
Where--? Where am I exactly?

39
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,101
You said 305 South Van Ness.

40
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,311
- Can you wait, help me with my bags?
- Sure.

41
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,069
I don't know where she is.

42
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,491
She expected me.

43
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,657
The plane was on time.

44
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,624
Yes, I'm-- I'm--
You all right?

45
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,803
I'm fine. I just sometimes get
where I can't take a deep breath

46
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:17,884
and when I can, it makes me panic
and it makes it even worse.

47
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,764
Okay.

48
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,014
Could I have some privacy?
Sure, sure.

49
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,974
Hello, Ginger?

50
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,652
Yes, I'm here.
I'm right in front of the place.

51
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,980
It is 305?

52
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,985
Uh-huh.

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,864
Ugh. Well, how long?

54
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,155
What? Where is it?

55
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,866
No, no, I see it.
Okay. Oh, okay.

56
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,544
Just-- Would you please hurry?
My sister left the keys in the bar.

57
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,713
- Can you wait?
- Sure.

58
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,980
Is that it?

59
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,277
Thank you.

60
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,204
Oh, thank you.

61
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,408
Have a great day, all right?
Bye-bye.

62
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,423
So, what do you think?
I love it.

63
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,547
The fireplaces work. I don't
like when they're for show.

64
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,550
It's so light and airy
and the ceilings are so high.

65
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,598
How can anyone breathe
with a low ceiling? The view.

66
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,393
You wanted Fifth Avenue.
Central Park. Superb.

67
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,311
Oh, this space is perfect.

68
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,230
We hardly have to do a thing.

69
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,774
You shouldn't spoil me so.
Well, why not?

70
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,569
Who else am I gonna spoil?
Did I tell you my news?

71
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,897
What?
Danny is gonna be living with us.

72
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,153
Oh, honey.
Oh, that's great news.

73
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,530
I worked it out with his mom,
her lawyers.

74
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,455
Oh, he'll be so much happier
when he's with us full-time.

75
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,122
Happy birthday, Danny.

76
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,543
Kids at school say we're really rich
and that you give money to charity.

77
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,591
Sure I do. You gotta remember
as you go through life

78
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,511
to share what you earn
with the less fortunate.

79
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,431
Not everyone is as lucky
as we are.

80
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,757
Domingo?
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,719
Another bottle of the Margaux.
Sure.

82
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,183
Excuse me.

83
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,765
It would look perfect.
Wouldn't wash me out?

84
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,691
No, not at all.
Not the way he--

85
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,566
Oh, isn't he sweet?

86
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,067
This song was playing
when Hal and I first met.

87
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,445
- I fell in love with the name Jasmine.
- Oh, so romantic.

88
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,867
I changed it.
Yeah, Jeanette had no panache.

89
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,172
This song was playing
when we first met.

90
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,422
You know it? Yeah, we met
at a party at Martha's Vineyard.

91
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,842
"Blue Moon."

92
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,798
Come on, boys.

93
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,099
Okay, let's go, Augie.
I gotta get home. Someone's waiting.

94
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,305
We helped Dad
move the furniture today.

95
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,187
Oh, really? That's
your idea of taking the boys?

96
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,315
Letting them help you
lug somebody's furniture upstairs?

97
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,487
- They loved it. Great exercise.
- Yeah?

98
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,441
They-- We ate franks and beans.
- Yeah.

99
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,494
- Relax.
- Let's go, Johnny, come on.

100
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,493
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.
- What's the rush?

101
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,916
What's the rush, Ginger?
You got a date?

102
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,584
It's none of your business.

103
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,085
It happens to be Jeanette, so...
Jeanette?

104
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,165
Jasmine?
What is she doing in town?

105
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,093
She's living with me
till she gets back on her feet.

106
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,011
She's had a bad time. Yeah.
Uh-huh.

107
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,965
When she had money,
she wanted nothing to do with you.

108
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,175
Now that she's broke,
she's moving in.

109
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,386
She's not just broke.
She's screwed up.

110
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,143
And it's none of your damn
business. She's family.

111
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,849
She stole our money.
Okay.

112
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,187
Understand? We could have been set.
That was our whole chance in life.

113
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,491
For the last time, Augie,
he was the crook, not her, okay?

114
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,819
What the hell did she know
about finance?

115
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,826
Don't stand there and tell me that.
She's married to a guy for years,

116
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,874
up to his ass in phony real estate
and bank fraud.

117
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,702
She knew nothing about it?

118
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,505
Believe me, she knew, Ginger.
Okay? She knew.

119
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,710
But when all those diamonds
and minks were flying in,

120
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,046
she just looked the other way.
I don't think so, Augie.

121
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:29,556
You said it. You said to me,
"She's a phony and had to know."

122
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,979
Jasmine, your country
house is so beautiful.

123
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,807
See?
I'm sorry, but we need an answer on this.

124
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,690
I told you, you change the name
of the corporation.

125
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,988
Operate under Global Innovations.
I don't know if we can.

126
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,531
I think we can, actually.

127
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,360
- Pay out of the accounts in Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam.

128
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,368
Whenever I hear them, they're one
step ahead of the Justice Department.

129
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,415
Just hope your house is not bugged.
Ha, ha, ha.

130
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,459
Oh, I never pay attention
to Hal's business affairs.

131
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,662
I have no head
for that sort of thing.

132
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,250
We transfer to the old corporation?
We could. Perfectly legal.

133
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,713
It would be a mistake under that name.
Definitely get in trouble for that.

134
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,139
Just don't file a joint
tax return. Ha, ha, ha.

135
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,014
Don't say that. I sign anything.
I'm very trusting.

136
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,561
Famous last words.

137
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,140
It's called looking
the other way.

138
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,228
Jasmine. Oh, my God.
Oh.

139
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,404
Look at you.
Look at you.

140
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,028
Oh, I am so sorry for the wait.

141
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,451
Sorry, I think I'm in Paris.
It's okay.

142
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,949
No, it's fine.
Augie's day with the boys.

143
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,906
Well, no wonder you're late.

144
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,832
Hello. Matthew, is it?
Yeah.

145
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,627
Boys, say hello.
I told you about her, remember?

146
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,296
Hi, I'm Jasmine.
Shake hands. Okay, go play.

147
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,919
They're big.
I know.

148
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,251
I'm getting it first.
Quiet, you two.

149
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,087
Well, they're loud.
Stop running around.

150
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,048
Christ, this kid's got--
What the hell is it? ADD?

151
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,727
- Yeah. Your place is homey.
- Are you kidding me?

152
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,478
No, I mean, it's got a very--
Well, it's casual charm.

153
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,355
God, knock it off,
Jasmine.

154
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,065
I need to stay here for a while.
No, I do.

155
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,696
I'm out of cash.
Okay.

156
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,619
Couldn't pay my rent in Brooklyn.
Can you believe

157
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,824
I had to move out of my home,
take a place in Brooklyn?

158
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,126
But I'm dead broke. Really,
the government took everything.

159
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,999
And the lawyers.

160
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,830
And I can't be alone, Ginger.

161
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,632
I really get some bad thoughts
when I'm alone.

162
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,337
Well, you know, all I can say is,
you look great.

163
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,799
Oh. Now who's lying?
You do.

164
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,850
You know, I was up all last night.
I was so anxious

165
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,553
Yeah? about moving hem

166
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,482
I wasn't sure how angry you still were.
Oh, well...

167
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,568
Another drink? We're celebrating.
Of course, yeah.

168
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,022
Oh, the flight was bumpy.
Uh-huh.

169
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,360
I didn't eat anything on the plane.
Oh, the food was awful. Here it is.

170
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,412
I mean, you'd think
first class, right?

171
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,493
You flew first class?

172
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,417
I don't know how anyone puts up
with those airlines.

173
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,338
Isn't first class a fortune?
Yes, I was quite shocked.

174
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,463
I thought you were tapped out.
I'm worse than tapped out, baby.

175
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,886
I've run up some serious debts.

176
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,884
So how did you fly first class?

177
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,934
I don't know, Ginger.
I just did.

178
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,888
All I meant was, if you've got
no money, to go first class...

179
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,895
You know me.
I splurge from habit.

180
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,149
Would you stop staring
at my luggage?

181
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,526
Yes, it's Louis Vuitton.

182
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,409
You told me you had to sell everything.
Look, look, look.

183
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,410
These are used, old suitcases.
See, with my initials. Who'd want them?

184
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,959
I sold what jewels and furs
I could hide from Uncle Sam.

185
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,002
God, I hate to tell you about that.

186
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,458
Jewelry is priceless, a great investment
when you buy it at Graff or Van Cleef

187
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,669
until you're desperate for money
and forced to sell,

188
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,096
and then it seems
you can't give it away.

189
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,888
Kids, stop it, come on!

190
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,849
- Were you adopted?
- Yes.

191
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,897
We were both adopted.

192
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,271
Born to different moms and dads, but
raised by the same morn and dad.

193
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,612
Could you stop doing
that gun thing? Sorry.

194
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,861
- Got migraine from the pressurized cabin.
- Matthew.

195
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,194
Did you like
the new mom and dad?

196
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,369
Yes, of course--
Aunt Jasmine did.

197
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,744
I ran away from home as fast
as my feet could carry me.

198
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,951
How come?
Well--

199
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,628
Our mother liked Aunt Jasmine
and not me.

200
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,922
Oh, stop.
How come?

201
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,295
She had better genes.
Don't tell them that.

202
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,133
Well, am I lying?
Dad said you're glad we lived far away.

203
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,964
What?

204
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,722
They're perfect for the dress
that I'm wearing to the Met Gala.

205
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,477
What's the matter?
Your mind is a million miles away.

206
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:49,653
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I-- I just got
a call from my sister, Ginger.

207
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:54,153
Oh, God, she's coming to New York
for a week with her husband, Augie.

208
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,825
He is a piece of work.

209
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,619
I just-- I don't know,
I guess I have to see them.

210
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,198
The one in San Francisco, the builder?
Yeah.

211
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:05,081
Oh, no, he's a contractor. I mean,
he's-- No, he's a handyman.

212
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,414
No, don't get me wrong.
I love Ginger, I do. She's a dear.

213
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,545
But our paths just went
in totally different directions.

214
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,841
Okay, that happens.

215
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,046
It's terrible of me to say,
but she was never too bright.

216
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,724
You know? And she was so wild
and I, of course, was Miss Perfect.

217
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,595
- Hi.
- Oh, you made it.

218
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,851
How lovely to see you.
Hi. Oh, my God.

219
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,648
Welcome.
Hi. Thank you.

220
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,022
Oh, this is my husband, Augie.
Augie.

221
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,399
This is Jeanette.
Jasmine. I changed it.

222
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,197
Jasmine.
I'm finally getting to meet the sister.

223
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,278
I know. Hello. I'm so sorry we
couldn't make it to the wedding.

224
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,988
Just that Hal had some
business in Saint-Tropez.

225
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,198
Couldn't get back in time.
Know what?

226
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,832
You missed a nice little party.
My friend Dennis sang.

227
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,539
He's great. Dennis Rackabuto.
I know. Hey--

228
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,421
Hal! You remember
Ginger.

229
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,001
Oh, my gosh.
How are you?

230
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,711
How are you?
This is Augie.

231
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,592
Augie. How you doing?
Awesome.

232
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,719
Hell of a place you got.
Thank you.

233
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,800
Why don't you come through?
Told you.

234
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,890
- Yvette, coffee?
- This is really...

235
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,266
Yeah, she's got taste.

236
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,439
It's like what
you see in the movies.

237
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,394
We have so much to catch up on. Can't
wait for you to show us New York.

238
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,604
Why don't you take
our car and driver?

239
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,066
Well, I hope you're gonna come.
I mean, how often am I here?

240
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,154
- No, no, I will definitely make some time.
- Oh, good. Heh, heh.

241
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,244
Where are you staying?

242
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,952
Oh, well, we-- We thought about
asking if we could stay with you,

243
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,585
but we don't wanna impose,
so we got a room at the Marriott.

244
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,632
Oh, the Marriott's perfect.
Oh. Yeah.

245
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,836
I'll have my office contact them
and forward us the bill.

246
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,263
Oh, no.
No, no, no, it's not necessary.

247
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,591
Please, you're our guests.
I insist.

248
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,224
Oh, well, then we insist
on taking you two to dinner tonight.

249
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,773
- What? Tonight?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,563
We have dinner plans.

251
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,691
I don't think we can--
Something we can't get out of.

252
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,397
I'm sorry' GINGER: There'll be time.

253
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,905
We stashed the kids with Augie's
sister, we're here for a week.

254
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,952
It's gonna be great.
It is. Okay.

255
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,701
Well, we don't have
a lot of free time,

256
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,829
but we'll definitely take you
to Le Cirque, won't we?

257
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,455
I mean, or Daniel. I mean--

258
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,459
They'd get a kick out of that.
Yeah, absolutely.

259
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,918
I know your birthday is this week.
Let us at least take you out for that.

260
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,465
I love how you're doing your hair.
Oh, thanks. Heh, heh.

261
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,928
You'll have to take me shopping. You
always could pick clothes. Heh, heh.

262
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,307
And Augie's got
some exciting business news

263
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,643
he wants to talk to Hal about.
Oh?

264
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,695
Don't worry, I don't need to
borrow money. We're flush.

265
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,114
Yeah,
What kind of work do you do, Augie?

266
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,659
Well, you know, I do, like,
repairs, furniture moving,

267
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,862
but I got plans to be
my own boss.

268
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,744
We'll talk about it over dinner.
They're going out.

269
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,370
Hey, could we have a tour?

270
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,830
Oh, yeah, of course. Why don't
you start in the kitchen?

271
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,132
Is there a little girls' room?
Just down the hall.

272
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,383
Wow.

273
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,089
Five days.

274
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,013
I'll have to invite them
to my birthday party now.

275
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,013
Where did she come up with him?
I always feel so guilty around Ginger.

276
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,016
We've got to make sure
we make their stay extra nice.

277
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,224
My God, five days.

278
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,444
Look.

279
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,148
It's so beautiful.
Oh.

280
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,358
Oh, but where would I wear
a Fendi bag?

281
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,740
Oh, go ahead. It's my treat.

282
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,072
No.
Yeah.

283
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,406
Really?

284
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,285
Oh, my God. I love it. Look.

285
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,711
Look.

286
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,711
Take the other one off.
No, I like this.

287
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,800
Boy, this is some place
you got here.

288
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,302
- I mean, this is unreal.
- It is.

289
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,259
Reminds me
of when I was a kid.

290
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,889
I used to be a lifeguard.

291
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,721
Start your own construction
company? Great idea.

292
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,399
We came into some money.
Tell him how, Augie.

293
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,897
What? We've been saving this story.

294
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,651
Well, the first 10-, 12,000,
I really worked for.

295
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,482
Put away a little each week.

296
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,692
But he's not
telling you the big news.

297
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,995
Why we're in New York.
You tell them.

298
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,243
Okay, I will.

299
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,949
We always play the lottery,

300
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,785
and we never even get two numbers.
Am I right?

301
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,080
Uh-huh.
But last week, we hit it.

302
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,164
We got 200,000 bucks.

303
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,751
Oh, that's fantastic.

304
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,007
I thought I'd drop dead.
That's great.

305
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,260
I never held that kind of money
in my hands. I mean, ever.

306
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,057
He was shaking
when we won.

307
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,263
Me? You had to see her. I had to tell
her, this is a once-in-a-lifetime.

308
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,097
Congratulations.
Yeah.

309
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,434
He wants to begin a business.
What do you think?

310
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:44,193
Well, if you like, I think Hal could
probably help you do better.

311
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,444
Yeah?

312
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:50,279
You know-- You know, I'm no gambler.
I mean, not with my one chance to--

313
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,582
Hey, come on. We don't know the first
thing about money, but he does.

314
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,161
First thing is how not to give half
your money to the government.

315
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,248
Look, I know there's taxes,
but, I mean, what can I do?

316
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,628
- There are ways.
- You see, Augie? You see?

317
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,508
Suppose I put you in a venture
that was low-risk, but very high-yield.

318
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,262
I'm not talking about 6 or 7 percent.
I'm talking about 20 percent.

319
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,138
Profitable enough?
20 percent?

320
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,141
He's developing a group of hotels
in the Caribbean.

321
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,474
You mean, not starting
my own business.

322
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,980
No, we mean investing with Hal.

323
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,313
Jeez, investing what?
You mean the whole thing?

324
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,944
You need money to make money.
Am I right?

325
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,237
Ginger.

326
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,321
Let them in on one of your--?
The hotel deal or something.

327
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,747
It'd be great for them.
Make a killing.

328
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,871
Pay attention, Augie.
I'm paying attention.

329
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,083
You will make money for them,
won't you?

330
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,085
I make money,
they make money.

331
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,087
God, they're hard work.

332
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,339
Tomorrow I'm taking
the day off.

333
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,547
I've neglected everything,
my yoga, my Pilates.

334
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,507
I've got that luncheon to plan,

335
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,434
the fundraiser
for the Central Park Conservancy.

336
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,808
I've rented them a limo
and a driver,

337
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,856
and I've suggested they go
to the South Street Seaport.

338
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,644
Can you imagine
if they lived here?

339
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,028
Here, for doing your duty.

340
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,825
Happy birthday.
Oh.

341
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,034
I'm giving it to you now so you can
wear it to your party tomorrow night.

342
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,039
Oh, sweetheart, it's beautiful.

343
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,712
Not bad taste for
a philistine businessman, huh?

344

I know, it's so extravagant.
Oh, look at that.

355
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,807
He surprised me in the tub, so to speak.
Ha, ha, ha.

356
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,811
Corsica's a bore. The weather's nice,
but it's nothing like Sardinia.

357
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,360
This year you are coming
to Palm Beach, no excuses.

358
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,152
Hey, Jasmine.
What?

359
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,778
Who's that woman?
Which?

360
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,485
That one.
Oh, Raylene.

361
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,787
She's a friend.
I love Raylene.

362
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,660
We met in a yoga class.

363
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,616
Isn't she pretty?
Yeah.

364
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,576
She runs a modeling agency.

365
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,208
How long have you known her?
Few years. Why?

366
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,716
- And you trust her?
- Trust her?

367
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,386
Of course I trust her.
What kind of question is that?

368
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,260
She just seems so cozy all night
with your husband.

369
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,889
I wouldn't worry. Hal's not
the roving type, nor is Raylene.

370
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,595
She's a very close friend.
I don't know.

371
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,148
If it was my husband,
I'd keep an eye on him.

372
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,273
Goodness,
you are a suspicious one.

373
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,195
I'm just saying.
Just relax.

374
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,397
I am relaxed.

375
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,701
You shouldn't drink
so much, Augie.

376
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,326
Nobody wants to hear those
stupid Polish jokes, you know?

377
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,532
Oh, I had a drink?

378
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,787
Yeah? Yeah.

379
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,918
Let me tell you, you were half in
the bag the entire night, okay?

380
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,249
Tell me about my drinking.

381
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,882
Give me that.
What's eating you?

382
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,746
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

383
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,665
Hey.

384
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,639
What?
Would you tell your friend?

385
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,096
I'm talking.
Tell him what?

386
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,436
Are you listening to me?

387
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,111
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

388
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,688
Would you tell him?
Yeah.

389
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,991
Bet your ass I'd tell him.
But what if it causes trouble?

390
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,613
Or maybe a divorce?

391
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,947
If you don't say anything,
it could've been a passing thing.

392
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,828
He never knows and he lives on
happy with his wife.

393
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,753
You know, I would tell him,
because that's what a friend's for.

394
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,923
You gotta have his back.
That's why I'd tell him.

395
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,922
It's a tough call, Augie.
I don't know.

396
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,921
Ginger.
What?

397
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,598
What are we doing?
Are we playing charades?

398
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,266
I mean, come on.

399
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,935
Did you see something?
Yeah.

400
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,639
On the street, by accident.

401
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:13,852
I saw Hal kissing that brunette
who was at the party.

402
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:18,947
You saw Hal kiss Raylene?
Raylene?

403
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,196
You know her name too?

404
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,243
My God, she gets around.

405
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,789
Oh, we were introduced. Come on,
you got nothing to worry about.

406
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,162
Yeah.
Nobody could ever take your place.

407
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:33,212
Yeah, believe me, I wasn't
thinking she'd look at you. Heh.

408
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,918
Nobody would ever look at me, right?
Right.

409
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:40,003
You looked at me.
Yeah, once. It was a mistake.

410
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,802
All right, listen.
What?

411
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,350
You think Hal's banging her?

412
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,099
When Jasmine don't wanna
know something,

413
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,273
she's got a habit
of looking the other way.

414
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,693
Thank you for my present.
I got so many comments.

415
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,193
I think everyone enjoyed themselves
and that piano player was--

416
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,899
He was fantastic.
I got his card.

417
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:06,157
What were you, uh, talking to
Raylene so intensely about?

418
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:10,242
Oh, uh, her husband is thinking
about getting his own plane.

419
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:15,250
I was just weighing the pros and cons
for her of a Challenger versus a, uh--

420
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,082
Gulf stream?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

421
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,877
She's so pretty.
Yeah.

422
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:24,339
Bill's out of town for a couple
weeks and she'll be all alone.

423
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,722
I thought maybe we could take her out
to dinner or have her over here.

424
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,723
Yeah.
Great.

425
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,555
Sure.

426
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,694
This is silly, Ginger.
Why?

427
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,021
It's Sunday.
So?

428
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,404
It's his day off. He wants
to spend it alone with you.

429
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,406
He's alone with me plenty.

430
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,080
If I'm gonna marry Chili, you're
gonna meet him sooner than later.

431
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,123
I told him we'd show you
the town.

432
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,420
Well, he won't want your sister around.
Will you stop it?

433
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,299
This city is so beautifully European.

434
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,422
Have you ever been abroad?

435
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,128
At all?
No.

436
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,465
We used to sail
from Saint-Tropez to Cannes

437
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,051
and up the coast to Monaco.
Hm.

438
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,555
It reminds me of the Mediterranean.
There's Chili.

439
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,605
- Which one?
- There.

440
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,683
- Who's that with him?
- I don't know.

441
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,852
- Chili.
- Hi.

442
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,903
Hi, hey.
You look beautiful.

443
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,027
Oh, thanks.
Yeah.

444
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,071
You smell good too.
You're late.

445
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,279
Eddie. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Ginger. Hi.

446
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,578
This is Jasmine.

447
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,873
Jasmine, hi. I'm Eddie.
This is Eddie.

448
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,246
Nice to meet you. Eddie.
I'm Jasmine.

449
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,124
Hi.
Ginger told me about you.

450
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,580
Oh, all good, I hope.

451
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,042
I gotta tell you, I was all set
to move in with your sister.

452
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,925
Then she tells me that we gotta
postpone because her sister's in town.

453
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,008
He's joking.
Well, I hope I didn't inconvenience you.

454
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,432
It was an emergency.

455
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,682
No.
Things happen. Right, Eddie?

456
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,684
Could've happened
to anybody.

457
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,482
Told me you never been here,
don't know anybody,

458
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,606
so I brought along this
sad excuse for a blind date.

459
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,609
Best he could do on short notice.
He works with me.

460
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,110
I gotta get a beer.

461
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,613
You want a beer?
Can I buy you a drink?

462
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,991
I have a drink, but thank you.
I'm dropping dead of hunger.

463
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,290
This place has the best clams.

464
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,992
You like clams, Jasmine?

465
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,126
No, no, no.
I'm not hungry.

466
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,623
What the hell are you drinking?
Let me see. What is this?

467
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,002
Is it vodka?
Martini.

468
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,050
This place has the
best clams in the city.

469
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,882
The best are at Manero's.

470
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,965
You're nuts. They don't even compare.
Who cares?

471
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,722
This place is good too. They're fresh.
That's the thing with clams.

472
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,930
You get a bad clam,
you'll wish you were never born.

473
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,482
So, what do you do, Jasmine?
I told you, she just got here.

474
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,525
- She's looking for a job.
- Yeah?

475
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,320
I know a dentist
who's looking for help.

476
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,569
Oh, yeah?
No, I'm actually thinking

477
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,196
- of going back to school. Hm.
- School?

478
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,120
Heh. To study what?

479
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,579
I don't know. I mean,
the biggest mistake I made

480
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:02,004
was leaving college in my last year
and not completing my education.

481
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,501
What would you be?

482
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,298
An anthropologist.

483
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,502
Really?
Like digging up old fossils?

484
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,178
That's an archaeologist.

485
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,381
Ginger told me the
whole story.

486
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,091
That must be terrible, right?

487
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,051
One minute you're on top
of the world, the next--

488
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,304
Guy turns out to be a crook. Heh, heh.
Yeah.

489
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,891
Her husband,
he owned racehorses.

490
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,726
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

491
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,938
Oh, yes, yes,
for a year or two,

492
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,649
Hal became quite obsessed
with thoroughbreds.

493
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,322
So, what are you gonna
study in college?

494
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:33,573
Let me guess.

495
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,372
A nurse. Huh?
Ooh.

496
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,624
Is that how
I impress you?

497
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,873
A nurse?
You got something against nurses?

498
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,422
My sister's a nurse.
Nurses are very hot to go to bed with.

499
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,796
They have extensive knowledge
of how the human body works.

500
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:53,097
- Careful what you accuse my sister of.
- Just saying, I know good nurses.

501
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,345
Chili, why don't
you change the subject?

502
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,393
You think you're being charming,
but you're not.

503
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,972
You always stare into space
like that?

504
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,857
I had a friend who used to do that,

505
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,186
but there was something wrong
with him. He was epileptic.

506
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,773
I'm not epileptic.

507
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,902
If you see the waitress,
I'd like another Stoli martini.

508
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,454
- What are you gonna study?
- Leave her alone.

509
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,908
It's like the third time you asked.
So? She hasn't answered.

510
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,245
I don't know, but I'll be sure
to keep you informed.

511
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:28,833
Oh, okay, sorry. I'll back off.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be curt.

512
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,295
I just don't know what I'm gonna
do with the rest of my life.

513
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,847
What do you wanna do?
Why don't we take her to see the sights?

514
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,894
Then back to my place. She likes vodka.
My buddy's just back from Russia.

515
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,562
Brought me this incredible vodka.
Great idea.

516
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,142
You're gonna love my place.
Yeah, let's go.

517
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,765
- Wait till you try this vodka.
- All right, man.

518
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,718
I wish my apartment
had a garden.

519
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,554
We didn't take her inside Alcatraz.
Thank you.

520
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,767
They got tours in there, Jasmine.
Ginger said your ex-husband did time?

521
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:31,400
He'd still be doing time
if he didn't hang himself in his cell.

522
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,324
Really? Like with a belt?
Well, it had to be a belt. Or a bedsheet.

523
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,992
- Could be a bedsheet.
- No.

524
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,538
He managed to get
a piece of rope.

525
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,908
Plain rope.

526
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,118
You can get anything
if you got juice.

527
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,920
That's some way to go, huh?
Strangle yourself to death?

528
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,590
No, it wasn't strangulation.

529
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,464
When you hang yourself,
your neck breaks.

530
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,547
I wouldn't feel sorry for him.
He hurt a lot of people.

531
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,803
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, including me and Augie and her.

532
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,182
A lot of people are under
the misapprehension you strangle,

533
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,230
but your neck snaps.
Okay, we got it.

534
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,732
He was a bad guy, you know?

535
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,482
He lived like a big shot
on other people's money.

536
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,111
And he played around behind her back.
No.

537
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,489
- Jasmine, go and start your cooldown.
- Oh, good.

538
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,909
Hey, Jas.
Yeah?

539
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:27,038
I know you don't wanna go
to the Yankee game tonight.

540
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:31,713
I'd go to any sporting event with you,
you know, but I just never got baseball.

541
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:36,168
I thought I'd ask Melanie. She's a fan.
Oh, sure. God, she'll be thrilled.

542
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,628
Hey, Mel?
Yeah?

543
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,464
You like baseball, right?
I love baseball. Why?

544
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:45,098
I got two season tickets behind
the Yankee dugout for tonight.

545
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,146
I don't have anybody else
to go with me. Are you free?

546
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,975
Absolutely, if you're sure
there's nobody else.

547
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,355
No.

548
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,688
No, no, you'll do just fine.
All right, thanks.

549
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,071
This is where you live? Nice.
Yeah.

550
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,495
Hey, grab the groceries for me.
Yeah.

551
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,753
I can get this one.
Get them.

552
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,251
You got it? All right.
I got it.

553
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,966
Oh! Oh.

554
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,343
Oh, no.
That's okay, don't worry.

555
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,092
- No more vodka for you.
- I didn't have any vodka.

556
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,549
- I didn't have no vodka.
- I know about you.

557
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,101
Hey, hey, come here,
come here, come here.

558
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,553
Take it upstairs?
Yes?

559
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,887
Yeah.
All right.

560
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,482
Eddie wants your
phone number.

561
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,692
Why?
I think he wants to call you.

562
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,737
I think he wants to ask you out,
you know, for dinner.

563
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:41,533
Look, I'm busy at the moment.
He's a terrific guy. Look at him.

564
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,952
Well, why doesn't he
ask me himself?

565
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,076
Because he's shy, you know?
He thinks he's short.

566
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,081
Look, I'm concentrating
on school, okay?

567
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,128
And getting a job.
That's perfect.

568
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,297
Right, he knows this dentist.

569
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,377
No, I have no interest
in being a receptionist.

570
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,928
What did you have in mind,
running a bank?

571
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,884
Is this what you wanted to talk about?
And how long you're planning

572
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,766
on staying with Ginger.
Oh, right. It's just till I find my feet.

573
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,392
We have a lot of big plans.

574
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,440
Don't worry, I'm not gonna ruin
any of your big plans.

575
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,394
No one wants to get out of here
as fast as I do.

576
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,822
I'm sure this is a big comedown
from what you're used to.

577
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,572
It's fine. it's--
I'm grateful for her help.

578
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,699
So you don't want Eddie
to call you?

579
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,373
No, I'm not ready to go out
at the moment.

580
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,328
Ginger said
you had a nervous breakdown.

581
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,129
She tends to be
quite dramatic.

582
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,960
Said you were in the street,
talking to yourself.

583
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,680
You know, I don't think
that this is any of your business.

584
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:53,060
No, but since I'm marrying her,
we don't have any secrets between us.

585
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,981
Ugh.

586
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,071
- What did Chili want?
- Oh, nothing.

587
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:05,367
His retarded boyfriend wanted a date,
but he was too shy to ask.

588
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:09,288
What do you think of Chili?
He's very anxious to move in with you.

589
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,707
Yeah, I know.
He's got the hots for me.

590
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,409
Can I speak frankly?

591
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,369
You hate him?
Yeah.

592
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,080
I could tell you two
didn't hit it off.

593
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,713
He's another version
of Augie. He's a loser.

594
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:25,296
Hey, didn't I hear Eddie say
he knows a dentist looking for help?

595
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,134
Oh, forget it!
Jesus, it's too menial!

596
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,343
I'd go nuts.

597
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,850
I wanna go back to school.

598
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:40,937
I wanna get my degree and become,
you know, something substantial.

599
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,065
I can't just do some mindless job.

600
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,446
Ugh. I was forced to take a job
selling shoes on Madison Avenue.

601
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:50,495
Oh, so humiliating.

602
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,416
Friends I'd had at dinner parties
at our apartment came in

603
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:58,587
and I waited on them. I mean,
do you have any idea what that's like?

604
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,462
You know, one minute,
you're hosting women

605
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:06,716
and the next, you're measuring
their shoe size and fitting them.

606
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:09,427
Erica Bishop came into the store.

607
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:13,602
She saw me
and was so embarrassed for me,

608
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,022
she slipped out
thinking I didn't see her.

609
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,317
I saw you, Erica!

610
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,278
Are you okay?

611
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,949
Hey, you got great taste.

612
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,700
Maybe you could do something
in fashion.

613
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,326
Or designing. Yeah?

614
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,785
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.

615
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,088
Everyone used to say
I'd make a good interior decorator.

616
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,088
There's courses,
but, you know, they cost money.

617
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:49,297
No, Eve Logan got
her decorator's license online.

618
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,506
On a computer?

619
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,092
I guess you could, but--

620
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,679
Yeah, I'm so computer illiterate.

621
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,773
But I could take a class
in computers.

622
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:04,695
And then when I can handle a computer,
then I can study decorating online.

623
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:09,240
That sounds too complicated.
Why is your reaction always negative?

624
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,068
I'm just saying.

625
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,654
You know, first you gotta
learn computers,

626
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,490
and then go for a decorator's
license online.

627
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,872
You're afraid
I'll stay here too long.

628
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,828
No, you know--

629
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,337
Just all those courses,
they cost money.

630
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,925
You'll work out here. It's mostly phones
and keeping my appointments straight.

631
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,224
There's the follow-up cards,
which I explained,

632
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,143
and the notices for cleanings.

633
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,808
Any questions?

634
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,190
Tell Dr. Flicker
it's an emergency.

635
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,729
Come on. Come on.
Yes?

636
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,863
Oh. What?

637
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,032
Yes, a cancellation.

638
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,860
Oh, you want to cancel.

639
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,537
When?
Please.

640
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,449
Wait, wait, wait.
You said the 24th.

641
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,501
My husband has an abscess.

642
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,210
Can you just put someone on
who speaks better English?

643
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:10,010
The software interface
is what provides you, the user,

644
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,680
the ability to control the hardware,
the computer.

645
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,553
Okay, that's the operating--

646
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,682
The operating system
gives you that ability.

647
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,854
I need an appointment
in two weeks.

648
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,397
Is the 10th good for you?

649
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,575
The 10th. Yes, fine.

650
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,028
Oh, better make it the 12th.

651
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,410
Oh, we're all booked on the 12th.
Okay.

652
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,911
Make it the 14th.

653
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,414
The 14th?
Oh, no.

654
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,712
Is 3 good on the 9th?

655
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,880
Or noon on the 11th?

656
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:52,131
Can you just settle on a time, please?
Just pick a time.

657
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,635
Remember the yoga class.

658
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,847
Deep breath.

659
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,813
Breathe deeply.

660
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,150
All right, deep breath.

661
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,907
If you take a deep breath,
you can smell the honeysuckle.

662
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,108
Beautiful.

663
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,027
Make a great perfume.
It would.

664
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,784
Your polo pony's in great shape.
Thank you.

665
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,332
No, I have never seen a polo match.
Really?

666
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:26,912
My husband's a fanatic. Not to say he's
good at it, but it keeps him busy.

667
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,667
We got a flight to catch.

668
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:31,421
Hal's taking Danny to
Augusta for the Masters.

669
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,173
They're golf degenerates.
I'll be home alone.

670
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,051
We'll be back in three days.
Mm. Did we tell you?

671
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,633
Danny was first in his class at Harvard.
No.

672
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,013
Yes.
Congratulations.

673
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,719
Thanks.
He's a math genius.

674
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,397
He's the genius. Dad did a guest
lecture at the business school

675
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,976
and everyone said
it was the best lecture.

676
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,108
Naturally, I became an
instant celebrity on campus.

677
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,985
Hey, I need your signature
on these, baby.

678
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,569
Oh.

679
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:01,489
Be careful. Don't get hit by a golf ball.
That's how Ray Becker died.

680
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,996
You know, a little blue bruise
on his temple.

681
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,509
What are you always studying
in your spare time?

682
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,307
Well, I'm trying
to learn to use a computer.

683
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,808
I wanna study
interior design online.

684
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,139
Oh, you wanna be a decorator?

685
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,475
Yeah, it's where
my strongest gifts are.

686
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,526
You know, I have a natural flair
for space and color

687
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,526
and an eye for choosing
soft furnishings.

688
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,951
It's very commendable, but I can't
really have you studying on work time

689
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,529
if it interferes
with the business at hand.

690
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,331
Yes. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

691
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,375
Please, see that it doesn't.

692
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,706
Uh...

693
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:55,126
I was gonna ask you a question.
Yes?

694
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,263
Would you have
a drink with me?

695
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,549
A drink?

696
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,969
I'd love it if you could.

697
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,264
Well, it would have to be
a quick one

698
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:13,227
because, you know, I'm
meeting my boyfriend for dinner.

699
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,193
I was just saying

700
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:22,028
you can tell awful lot about people
when you look in their mouths.

701
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:26,411
Are they conscientious?
Are they disciplined? Are they vain?

702
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,413
Or careless? You have
to know what to look for.

703
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,416
Do you have the time?
I have to keep an eye on it.

704
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,667
I've got homework.

705
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:38,878
This computer thing is proving
a little more difficult than I imagined.

706
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:43,682
It's funny, really, because I used to
be a straight-A student in college.

707
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:47,887
You know, but they say every year,
millions of brain cells just die off.

708
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,563
You have good teeth.
Oh.

709
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,146
I'm sure you get
many compliments on them.

710
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,024
Well, thank you.
Yeah.

711
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,532
You know,
you're a very beautiful woman.

712
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,451
Are you serious
with your boyfriend?

713
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,743
Hm.

714
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,790
I don't mean to pry.
Heh. Uh...

715
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,120
God, life is complicated.

716
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,626
Have you ever had
any children?

717
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,925
How do you expect me to
react when my father is unmasked

718
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,220
as a common thief?
You can't just drop out of Harvard.

719
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,594
No, it's too humiliating.
I wanna die when I see what he's done.

720
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,142
How he lied, stole, ruined people.
I know--

721
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,640
He is a sleazy criminal.

722
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,223
But if you drop out, you will
be throwing away your whole future.

723
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,025
You think I could ever
face anybody up at school?

724
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,523
My father, who I bragged
to everyone about?

725
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,698
The financial genius, generous,
the philanthropist?

726
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,151
He's such a phony!
He's a cheap crook.

727
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,828
His charitable contributions
with stolen money.

728
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,282
Well, just think how he feels.
He was arrested in the street.

729
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,084
It's in all the papers.
How can you look at him?

730
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,333
Did you not suspect anything
or did you not care?

731
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,711
What does that mean?
It didn't pay for you to ask questions.

732
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,466
Think I would have allowed him to
set up corporations under my name?

733
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,674
Sign accounts? This is no cake walk.
I could get indicted.

734
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:11,102
He's done nothing but lie over the years.
He is a con man and a hypocrite.

735
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,307
This is how you respond, by squandering
your life to get even with him?

736
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,893
Don't try to find
me, because you won't.

737
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,566
He's a fucking bum. Let's go.

738
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,149
Let's go, let's go!
Get out of the clinch!

739
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,200
- Hey. Hey.
- That's it, pop the jab.

740
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,200
Hey, guys, keep it down.
My sister's trying to study.

741
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,202
When can we stop tiptoeing around?
Shh.

742
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,999
Pop the jab!
She'll hear you.

743
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,499
Well, I don't care. I work hard all week.
I wanna relax.

744
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,292
- Let's go, come on.
- Let's go. Work the body.

745
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,218
- The guy's just standing.
- Look.

746
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,764
<i>And Bruno makes it easy,
because he just pushes himself forward.</i>

747
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:51,594
Her sister, she had millions.
Turned out she married a crook.

748
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,020
Look, where was she
when she was loaded

749
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,723
and you were tending bar,
waiting tables?

750
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,401
- Now family's family?
- Oh!

751
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,733
- Yeah.
- Nice. You can see the money.

752
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,280
- I know.
- He's right.

753
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,404
Is it possible, without
ruining any of your fun,

754
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,576
that you could lower the TV a bit?

755
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,281
Hey, Jasmine, why don't you stop
working for a bit? Have a beer.

756
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,834
Believe me,
I wish I could.

757
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,253
What kind of work
are you doing?

758
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:22,754
I'm trying to, urn,
work a computer,

759
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,210
but it seems I have
no aptitude for it.

760
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,637
Hey, listen, I just--
I want you to know,

761
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:32,217
it's great when a grown-up continues
with their education. Not for nothing.

762
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:38,103
Well, my goal is to study
interior decorating online.

763
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,687
Why don't you just go
to decorator school?

764
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:47,529
Well, I have to use my days
to work and pay my way.

765
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,861
As Hal said, "it's not
the money, it's the money."

766
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,824
Yeah, okay, but, you know, life
ain't all work and no play, right?

767
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,955
Ginger says between work
and school, you're cracking up.

768
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,253
Hey, why don't you shut up?
No, no.

769
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,627
I'll admit, it's been very trying,

770
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,425
but I'm determined
to make something of myself.

771
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,676
You don't like working with the dentist?
No, I do not.

772
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,804
Well, Ginger said you're
not used to working a job.

773
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,557
Well, in that respect,
I was very fortunate.

774
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,513
He was a handsome guy
with money.

775
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,066
He was a smooth talker and pampered her.
What's she gonna say, no?

776
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,272
Uh--

777
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,981
I got it.

778
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,691
Why does it have to be a decorator?
Why can't you pick something else?

779
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,736
What would you
want me to do?

780
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,663
Do you want me to wait tables?
Bag groceries?

781
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,831
Hey, Ginger bags groceries.

782
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:42,082
Well, Ginger and I are
completely different people.

783
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,913
Yeah, she got the good genes.

784
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:47,843
It's not genetic. You can't always
blame everything on your genes.

785
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,670
If you're prepared to work hard
and not settle--

786
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,176
What, you mean Augie?
She means me.

787
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:58,470
Oh. Who do I have to sleep with around here
to get a Stoli martini with twist of lemon?

788
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,391
Oh.

789
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,023
That's what I...

790
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:10,532
What--? What--?
Oh, Christ, I can't remember.

791
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,907
So Chili was telling me that you used to
have a really nice collection of cars.

792
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,613
Oh, yes, my husband did.

793
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:22,453
He used to collect vintage
Bentleys and Mercedes.

794
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,005
Wow, those are expensive cars.
Yes, they are.

795
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,800
You know, having wealth
is nothing to be ashamed of.

796
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:33,756
We were very civic-minded.
Yeah, with other people's money.

797
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,682
This guy lost every penny
of Ginger's money.

798
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,137
I tried to bring my sister
and her husband in on a good thing.

799
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,813
I mean, what do I know
about financial schemes?

800
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,564
You'll be very happy to know
that I lost every cent of my own money.

801
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,441
You know, every home,
every stick of furniture,

802
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,239
every fur, every ring
and every bank account,

803
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,319
and still it wasn't enough
to placate the government.

804
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,370
Her husband was a slick operator.
I was there a week,

805
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:03,247
I knew he was hitting on her girlfriend.
I really need to study.

806
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,920
- I need some peace, okay?
- Okay.

807
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,624
I'm not gonna make it
if you turn this place into a nightclub.

808
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,836
- I can't. I just can't.
- All right, all right, all right.

809
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:16,765
Everybody out. The girl's got homework.
What? Main event's not on yet.

810
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,466
Out.
I'm not leaving now.

811
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,143
You know,
she's right about you, Chili.

812
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,518
You drink, you become a jerk.
What about her? She's drink--

813
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,816
Jerk? Come here.
Heh.

814
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,776
I'm sorry I don't
drive a Bentley.

815
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,821
- Let's go to the bar.
- Bye. Thank you for coming.

816
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,649
Good night.

817
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,276
Jesus, it's a mess.
Oh, I'm sorry.

818
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:42,286
Ginger, I'm really-- I don't--
I don't know what came over me.

819
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,336
But I have told you before, your taste
in men leaves a lot to be desired.

820
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,958
Yeah, I know these are
not your kind of guys.

821
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,837
I mean, God, don't you wanna
meet some decent man?

822
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,840
You know, someone who can
take you out of this--

823
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,513
What? This hole?

824
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,886
Yeah, I know what you
think of it here.

825
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,435
I mean,
you've got two kids.

826
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:05,730
You can do better than Chili
and his drunken loser friends.

827
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,026
If I thought I could do better, I would.
So far no one's beating my door down.

828
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:13,025
You know, he's sexy
and he doesn't steal.

829
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:18,656
Okay, okay. Do you always have to
make those stupid sarcastic digs?

830
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,113
I'm scared, Hal.

831
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,700
Paula said the reason Howard
is leaving Global Innovations

832
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,913
is he's not comfortable with business
practices from a legal standpoint.

833
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,215
Howard Trask is such a pussy.
No, no--

834
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:36,261
What do you think I have lawyers for?
He didn't wanna wind up in jail.

835
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,181
Jail? Jesus.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

836
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,681
If I back out now, I hate to tell you
how much money we'd lose.

837
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,514
It's like a domino effect.
One thing would follow the other.

838
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:51,022
Hey, let me deal with it, okay?

839
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,978
Is there anything you want
that you don't have?

840
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,688
Is there?

841
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,280
No.

842
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,530
So stop worrying
and let me spoil you.

843
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:04,035
No, I agree. I mean, Howard
always was a prissy mama's boy.

844
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,492
Yeah, mama's boy.
That's the perfect phrase.

845
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,797
Okay, how about Tuesday
the 22nd at 9?

846
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,716
I can't make 9.
How about the afternoon?

847
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,420
All right, 2, 3?

848
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:23,223
I can't make the 22nd.
How about the 21 st?

849
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,268
We have nothing open on the 21st.
Good night.

850
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,016
Well, he wants me in a week.

851
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,224
Well, another day or two won't matter.
How about the 24th?

852
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,150
Fine. Oh, wait, no.
Go for 9?

853
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,604
That's my colonoscopy prep day.

854
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,404
That's always very special.

855
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,404
Why don't you think about it
and call me?

856
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,533
Before you go,
can you call Dr. Girsback

857
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,665
and tell him I read the x-rays
and we can talk later?

858
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,963
Sure.
No, no, no.

859
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,040
When you're done,
when you're done.

860
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,252
When you're finished.
Thank you.

861
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,600
Are you feeling more
comfortable in the job?

862
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,431
I hope you're pleased, because I
am determined to make it work.

863
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:14,859
It fits in perfectly with my class.
Are you getting better on the computer?

864
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:20,031
Well, I'm sure I'm the worst student
there, but another girl helps me, so...

865
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,111
I'm glad you're relaxing
more into this job.

866
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,228
I'm trying.

867
00:48:25,254 --> 00:48:28,894
Heh, I must say, I like
having you around.

868
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,451
Thank you.
Since you started working here,

869
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:35,380
have you noticed I've been wearing
more colorful neckties? Heh, heh.

870
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,133
Since you-- I'm just-- Just joking.

871
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,553
Can I--?
Can I make a confession?

872
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:46,592
I don't know that I should be the
one to hear a confession, doctor.

873
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,727
Ha, ha, ha. Well... Ah.

874
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,977
The way you dress,

875
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:57,394
I sometimes find very...

876
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,028
arousing.

877
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:04,450
Really? I don't think I dress
in the slightest provocatively.

878
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:09,372
Does it upset you if I tell you
that I, um, find you attractive?

879
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:14,328
Dr. Flicker, where is all this talk leading?
Well, I'm not the kind of person

880
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:18,836
who likes to beat around the bush.
I find you a very alluring woman.

881
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,543
I'm flattered, but I certainly hope
that's not why you hired me.

882
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,426
A certain elegance in a woman
has always been enticing to me.

883
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,383
I shouldn't be hearing this.
No, don't be upset.

884
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,721
I'm not upset. Can I just grab my coat?
Don't be upset.

885
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:37,149
Really, I think if you get to know me,
you'd come out of your shell more.

886
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,396
I'm not in a shell.

887
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,729
Ever gotten high on nitrous oxide?
No.

888
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,110
It would remove your inhibitions.
I don't have inhibitions.

889
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,407
Stop.
Oh, Dr. Flicker.

890
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,986
Stop being standoffish.
I'm not standoffish.

891
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,743
You should be proud.
You've made a conquest.

892
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,493
Oh, Dr. Flicker.

893
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,201
This is so embarrassing.

894
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,255
I am never coming back here.

895
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:03,210
I don't have to put myself
through this nonsense.

896
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,761
I gotta take a deep breath.

897
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,805
Oh, now look what you've done.
I can't breathe.

898
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,179
Oh, God, I can't breathe.

899
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,058
I don't blame you for being shaken up.

900
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:23,146
I'd have that dentist reported.
If I told my boyfriend that story,

901
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:27,029
he would go to the guy's office
and break every bone in his body.

902
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,327
You can sue him.
That's harassment.

903
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,076
No, I'm never going
into another courtroom.

904
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,531
Ugh. I don't blame you.

905
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:37,334
My boyfriend's a lawyer.
He's got court stories.

906
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,960
Sharon, do you know any men?
Men?

907
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,379
Men that would be
good for me.

908
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,463
I just moved here,
so I don't really know anybody.

909
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:52,892
If you can't fall in love in San Francisco,
you can't fall in love anywhere.

910
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:54,935
Someone substantial.

911
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,856
Well, what are you doing
Sunday afternoon?

912
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,148
Not very much.

913
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,602
Tony and I are going to a party.
Come with.

914
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,531
Oh, no, no. I don't think I'm ready
for a big crowd of strangers.

915
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,448
Oh, come on.

916
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:12,699
It's a big bash someone's having.
There'll be all kinds of people.

917
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,076
Make an effort,
otherwise nothing happens.

918
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,842
Then you blame
everything but yourself.

919
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:20,813
No, I want to. It's not
that I don't want to.

920
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,874
Can I bring my sister?
For moral support? Absolutely.

921
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,708
And Tony and I will be there.

922
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,465
You'll have fun.
It's a huge party.

923
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,637
Maybe you'll get lucky.

924
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,763
But you have to come,
otherwise I'm not going.

925
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:38,096
What the hell would I wear?
Oh, we'll find you something.

926
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:41,524
Oh, God, I haven't shown my face
socially in so long.

927
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:44,694
Sharon said there could be
some eligible men there.

928
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:48,402
I haven't been to a party in years.
You know, Chili hates them.

929
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:53,032
Well, you know what I say to Chili.
It's hard to meet a man you can trust.

930
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,196
Hal.

931
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,831
Hey, Nat.
What are you doing out here?

932
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,662
I was having lunch in Southampton
and I wanted you to meet Amy Moore.

933
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,338
Oh, hi. Hal Francis.
This is my wife. Honey?

934
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,585
Jasmine.
Hello.

935
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:10,010
Amy will be handling your contracts for
Empire Solutions and Global Innovations.

936
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,804
She's brilliant. We couldn't
have done any better.

937
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,849
We should get together
on that Empire Solutions thing.

938
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,098
Free on Tuesday?
I'll make sure I am.

939
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,394
That's great.

940
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,394
Are you having an affair
with Amy?

941
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:27,358
Amy, my lawyer?
Don't give me that. She's very pretty.

942
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,780
Of course not. What
makes you think that?

943
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,699
Someone made a remark.
What remark?

944
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,279
They saw you having lunch with her.
Taking her hand.

945
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,036
Oh, what crap. Who told you that?
I know who.

946
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,958
That vacuous troublemaker Lydia, right?
Were you?

947
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,912
I had a business lunch with Amy
at the Four Seasons.

948
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,248
Lydia was there.
Did you take her hand?

949
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:51,552
You think if I was having an affair,
I'd be crazy enough to have it in public?

950
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,301
Well, I don't know.
Sometimes you drink at lunch.

951
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,757
Maybe you were high.

952
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,218
It's obvious she's got crush on you.
You're building a case.

953
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,305
If you were having an affair,
I would be pretty upset.

954
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,062
Well, I'm not,
so don't get your temper up.

955
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,439
I'm just jealous because I love you.
You should be flattered.

956
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,942
You know, I understand
other women have a--

957
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:15,617
Find you attractive,
but it's their hard luck. I have you.

958
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,367
Yes, you do.
No.

959
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,705
So you're not?

960
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,580
No, I'm not.

961
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,754
Good.

962
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,082
Let's make love.

963
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:43,142
You know, if you were having
an affair, I'd be pretty upset.

964
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:47,187
Pretty darn angry. I don't wanna be
made a fool of, you know?

965
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,645
You hear me, Hal?
Excuse me. Are you talking to me?

966
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,400
Hey, Jasmine.
What?

967
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,277
Hi.
Oh.

968
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,617
How are you? I'm so glad you came.
You must be Tony.

969
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,116
Yes, this is Tony.
A pleasure to meet you.

970
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,948
What do you think? Nice party, right?
Beautiful.

971
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,034
It's kind of a mixed bag.

972
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,619
Did you bring your sister?

973
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,250
Oh, yes, she's dancing.

974
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,876
Hey, my name's Al, incidentally.
Oh. Ginger.

975
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,586
Ginger?
Yeah.

976
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,047
Ginger, you dance great.
Oh.

977
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,724
I never get a chance to, and I love it.
Yeah?

978
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,722
I do, yeah.

979
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,974
You know Sally, the host?

980
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,648
No, my sister brought me.
Yeah?

981
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:32,319
Wherever the hell she is. I don't--
I don't know where she is.

982
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,772
But you're from San Francisco?

983
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,197
Yeah? Yeah.

984
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,366
What about you?
Marin.

985
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,695
Okay. Great.
Yeah.

986
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,454
What do you do, Al?

987
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:47,330
I'm a sound engineer. I put in
people's systems, you know?

988
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,411
I did Mr. Lockman's.
Okay.

989
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,669
He's the husband of the host,
in case you were wondering.

990
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:55,592
I do concerts and private, uh...

991
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,679
Great.
I like slow dancing better, don't you?

992
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,677
Yeah.
It's more romantic, right?

993
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,724
It is, yeah.
Yeah.

994
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,552
It is.

995
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,556
Hey, you're really pretty.
Oh.

996
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:12,192
Yeah, you are. You are.
Really? Really?

997
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,580
I'd rather be someplace else too.

998
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,617
Oh.

999
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,536
Do I look that uncomfortable?
Almost.

1000
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,836
I'm Dwight Westlake.
Jasmine French.

1001
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,589
Jasmine French,
that's a very exotic name.

1002
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:41,923
Well, my parents named me
after my mother's favorite flower.

1003
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,425
Night-blooming jasmine.
Hm.

1004
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,261
Come to life after it gets dark.

1005
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,852
That's the best offer I've had today.

1006
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,558
I didn't say
it was an offer.

1007
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,942
I saw you in the other room before,
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.

1008
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,735
Well, hope I don't shatter
your illusion.

1009
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,409
You have great style.
Do I?

1010
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,954
Chanel belt, Hermés bag
and Vivier shoes.

1011
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,408
Vivier-- Oh, my goodness.
Do you work in the fashion industry?

1012
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,041
No, but my former wife was.
She worked at a fashion magazine.

1013
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,373
Right.
She passed away last year.

1014
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,875
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

1015
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:22,054
I'm so-- And what do you do?
Nothing as glamorous as fashion.

1016
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:25,724
I work in the State Department.
Well, no, that's glamorous.

1017
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,221
In the diplomatic corps.

1018
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:30,020
Don't tell me you're an ambassador.
No, hardly.

1019
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,097
But I wouldn't turn it down.

1020
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,104
We knew the ambassador
to Mexico.

1021
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,810
My husband did.

1022
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,233
Your husband?
You have a husband?

1023
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,866
No, no. Sadly, like your wife,
he passed away.

1024
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:47,788
But, you know, we stayed overnight
in the embassy in Mexico once.

1025
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,786
I work in Europe. Vienna.
Really?

1026
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,788
Oh, I love Vienna.
Oh, yeah?

1027
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,619
We were there once,
Hal and I.

1028
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,297
I remember it as being two weeks
of young wine and chocolate cake.

1029
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:01,468
Lovely. My ambition is to come back
after a few years and enter politics.

1030
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,888
I'd like to run for office in California.
Oh, how exciting.

1031
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,935
Yeah, it might just be an inflated ego,
but I think I'd make a good congressman.

1032
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:14,060
I grew up in San Francisco.
I know California. I like challenges.

1033
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,311
You from out here?

1034
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,561
New York. Park Avenue.

1035
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,817
You know, when my husband
passed away,

1036
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,149
I mean, naturally
I was very upset,

1037
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:28,033
so I decided to come out here
and start a new life for myself.

1038
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,489
What did he do?

1039
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,452
He was a surgeon.

1040
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:40,333
Hm. God, that must be
incredibly stressful.

1041
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:45,638
No, I mean, he had a heart attack.
I'm sure that's what gave it to him.

1042
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:47,715
You have children?

1043
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,437
No, no.
No, there really wasn't time.

1044
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:57,517
And what about you? Hm? What do you do?
I guessed you were in the arts.

1045
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,352
Am I right?
Well, you're close.

1046
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,858
I am an interior designer.

1047
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,031
I really have hit the jackpot.

1048
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,360
Really?
I meet this exotic creature,

1049
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,320
not only is she charming
and elegant and single,

1050
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,702
but I just bought a new house.
Really?

1051
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,034
One I've been looking at.
It's in Marin.

1052
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,836
Overlooking the Bay. My dream house.
Beautiful.

1053
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,381
I meet this woman, and she turns
out to be an interior designer.

1054
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,925
Written in the stars.
You have to look at it.

1055
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,720
I would love to.
Maybe you can help me with it.

1056
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,422
Absolutely.

1057
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,552
I never slept with anyone
the first night before, you know?

1058
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,433
Yeah, that--
But dancing with you

1059
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,356
got me all hot and bothered,
so, you know...

1060
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:39,854
Well, you were so sexy.

1061
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,562
I mean, I knew right away
that you were gonna be good in bed.

1062
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,896
I knew it.
Did you?

1063
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,903
I said to myself, you know...
Heh.

1064
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,111
You know, I thought for sure
we were gonna get caught.

1065
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,241
I didn't care. I mean, I--

1066
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:56,622
I couldn't wait. There's no way I was--
I had to have you right then and there.

1067
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,327
You know...

1068
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,708
You know what clinched it for me?
What?

1069
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,710
Because you were so smooth.

1070
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,793
Really?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1071
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,763
Well, that's-- I just--
But, you know, I--

1072
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,433
I don't want you to think I'm
just easy, because I'm not.

1073
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,637
No, I-- You know what I think?
You're a fun-loving person.

1074
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,097
I am.
That's-- Yeah.

1075
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,807
Yeah.
And that's what I am.

1076
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,483
I can see that.
That's--

1077
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,435
I'm easygoing by nature.
Yeah.

1078
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,362
That's what I--
I bring music to people's lives.

1079
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,657
You're very sweet,
you know?

1080
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:31,781
I never had
a sweet guy before.

1081
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,282
I hope I--
Never.

1082
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,582
I hope I didn't get you in trouble
with your boyfriend.

1083
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:40,127
No. You know, it's not like
we're engaged, so...

1084
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:44,173
You know, I'm free. I'm free.
I'm glad to hear that.

1085
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,009
Oh, God,
I'd better get back.

1086
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:48,711
My lunch hour's
almost over.

1087
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,297
But we-- You know what?
We have time, though.

1088
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,803
For what?
Let's go in the back seat.

1089
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,429
Again?
Yeah, come on.

1090
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,511
Jesus, what are you?
It's just...

1091
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,393
Are you one of those sex addicts?
I am for you. Come on.

1092
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,024
Ha, ha. Are you? I thought so.
One more.

1093
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,977
Nobody's around.
Not many people.

1094
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:09,031
We gotta make this quick.
I got tinted windows. It's perfect.

1095
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,661
What time is it?
Seven thirty.

1096
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:25,464
My turn. It's my turn!
God, he told me he'd call me yesterday.

1097
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:26,836
I wanna play with it!

1098
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,169
Can't you two stop
fighting for a second?

1099
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:33,381
I've got a throbbing headache.
You gave him both here

1100
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,762
and your cell number?
Of course I gave him both numbers.

1101
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,345
Unless he's been delayed
in Washington.

1102
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:43,308
Still, he could have phoned.
Don't think he figured you were lying

1103
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:46,815
and bailed out?
Look, could you stop saying I was lying?

1104
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:51,273
God. Okay, I may have dressed up a few
facts, omitted a few unpleasant details,

1105
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,655
but in the main, I mean,
my feelings, my ideas, my humor--

1106
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,828
I mean, isn't that who I am?
Christ.

1107
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,746
People reinvent themselves, don't they?
Do I have your permission?

1108
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,044
You better take more
of those pills. You're shot.

1109
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:12,220
Oh, Jesus. Would you please--? Matthew,
turn off that pounding. Please, Matthew.

1110
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,675
Can't stand it.

1111
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,221
Hey.
Hey.

1112
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,974
Were you at a party Sunday afternoon?
Who says?

1113
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,182
I got a friend who's a bartender.
He saw you at a party.

1114
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,733
So?
So you were dancing with a guy.

1115
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,358
So what?
I asked her to come with me, okay?

1116
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:33,907
I was nervous about going to a party
where I didn't know anyone.

1117
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,781
Is that so? So the two of you
were in the corner

1118
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:39,113
playing kissy-face.
Give me a break.

1119
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,666
We couldn't go to the ballpark
because you weren't feeling good.

1120
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:46,291
Hey, don't treat me like property.
I had a headache when you called.

1121
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,418
And then I decided to keep
my sister company at a party.

1122
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,749
I don't buy that.

1123
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,085
Since when am I taking
orders from you?

1124
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,216
Can you please
not fight in here?

1125
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,175
I don't think I can take it. For some
reason, my Xanax isn't kicking in.

1126
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,555
Who's this guy
you're fooling around with?

1127
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,014
I told you, I didn't like you
rushing me into anything, okay?

1128
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,816
Is seeing other guys her idea?
No, it's my idea.

1129
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:11,862
I don't think it is. She thinks I'm a
bum, like your first husband, right?

1130
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,939
You told me.
Guys, give me a break.

1131
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,242
By all rights, I should be living here.
What do you mean?

1132
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,490
Didn't you want a guy here
for the kids?

1133
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,618
So they grow up with a father?
I need to clear my head.

1134
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:26,577
We're talking about getting married.
Now she's taking you to parties

1135
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,254
and telling you
I'm not good enough for you.

1136
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,585
If I catch you
Give her some space.

1137
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,463
with somebody else--
Get out!

1138
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,967
You keep out of this, okay?
It's got nothing to do with you.

1139
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:40,761
You beat it, Chili. You've been drinking.
Hey, maybe that's for you.

1140
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:44,812
Ginger, she's not somebody
you can count on. I am.

1141
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,857
Don't pick it up. I don't want him to
think I'm waiting for him to call.

1142
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,900
- What the hell's going on?
- It's Al.

1143
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:53,479
Hey, give me that.
That's the guy, Al.

1144
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:56,074
Hi. Yeah, but you're
calling at a-- Get off!

1145
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:56,841
Give me that.

1146
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,527
You call here again, I'm gonna
bust you in your fat fucking face!

1147
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,740
Hello. No! No!
Give me that. Give me that.

1148
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,629
Look what you did,
you drunken asshole!

1149
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:13,298
You were right,
he's no better than Augie!

1150
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,047
Don't drag her to parties to meet men.
Get out!

1151
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,380
I didn't drag her out to meet men,
but if she has a brain,

1152
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:23,433
she'll dump you in the garbage and
find someone she deserves for once.

1153
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,431
When are you moving out?
Get out!

1154
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,515
I'm sorry I don't come from Park Avenue,
but I don't steal people's money.

1155
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:33,944
I am not some lying jailbird!
Get out or I'll call the <i>cops,</i> okay?

1156
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,522
She doesn't care about you.
She's a phony!

1157
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,732
Get out!
She didn't care about you

1158
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,193
until she fucking needed you!
Get out!

1159
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,253
That's my cell phone.
Okay.

1160
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:03,098
Where is it? Oh, God,
the kids were playing with it.

1161
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,643
Oh, where is my
goddamned cell phone?

1162
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,768
Hello? Dwight?

1163
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:15,148
Yes, can you just hang on a moment?
I'm just in the middle of something.

1164
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:22,158
Hello, how are you?

1165
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,613
No, no, no, it's just some business
I had to attend to.

1166
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:30,955
Oh, no, no.
No, that's fine.

1167
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,922
I know how hectic things can
get in the nation's capital.

1168
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,127
When?

1169
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:46,930
Uh-- Well, I'm actually
meeting a client

1170
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:50,096
for a drink in the Fairmont,

1171
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,897
so why don't you pick
me up in the lounge?

1172
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,692
Great.

1173
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,190
No, no, no, 3 is perfect.

1174
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,318
Okay, bye-bye.

1175
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:14,120
- I'd like to make this wall higher.
- Oh, well, it's lovely.

1176
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,829
I knew you'd like it.

1177
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,836
Oh, and the
garden is so established.

1178
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,042
Oh. It's beautiful.
Yeah, it's all right.

1179
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,970
The porch is so charming.
I can see why you love it.

1180
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:28,346
I have to get someone to take care of it.
The orchids, oh.

1181
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,599
Oh, this...

1182
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,306
This is spectacular.
Right?

1183
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:38,314
I think it's incredibly cheerful.
Oh, look at the flow, and the light.

1184
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,987
I mean, it--
it goes a ways that way as well.

1185
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,656
I have a million ideas immediately.
Oh, yeah?

1186
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,986
Oh, the fireplace. Reminds me of
those places in the Hamptons.

1187
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,787
So delightful.
You've done work in the Hamptons?

1188
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,661
We have friends out there.
Yes.

1189
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:55,244
All right.
Yes, I've done a number of

1190
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,499
beach houses.

1191
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,455
Let me show you the view.

1192
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,295
Well, I can see--

1193
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,093
Oh, my God, it's enormous.
Right?

1194
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,719
I had no I-- You could have
3- or 400 people out here.

1195
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,721
I don't have that
many friends, but sure.

1196
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,394
The view, it's just breathtaking.

1197
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,973
Andrea and I used to
do a lot of entertaining.

1198
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,979
I bet you did,
living in New York.

1199
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,187
Well, now you're
talking about my specialty.

1200
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,988
You know, I gave the best
dinner parties in the city.

1201
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,490
Hm.

1202
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,911
Come here.

1203
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:33,786
Ooh.

1204
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,917
I'm shocked.
Heh, heh, heh.

1205
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,745
Oh, yeah?

1206
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:42,299
What's your reaction, really?

1207
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:43,966
Well, my reaction is

1208
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,636
you can do it again if you like.
Oh, yeah?

1209
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:03,903
<i>♪ My man rocks me

1210
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:13,997

01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:21,501

1214
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,102
I've always wanted
a canopy bed. Look at this.

1215
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,983
Oh. Yeah, that looks interesting.
It is, right?

1216
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,311
Is that mid-19th century?

1217
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:48,149
I have no idea.
Yeah. Well, no, all the pieces are here.

1218
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:52,111
I do-- I love the posts,
but these beds, they're just--

1219
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,070
Well, they're
not very wide.

1220
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:58,329
Oh, yeah? Well, we're not very wide.
Oh, Dwight.

1221
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,916
We could do the top
in a muslin or linen--

1222
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,045
Yeah, yeah, whatever you think.
Well, it's not--

1223
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,752
You know, last night
when we were making love,

1224
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,179
I realized how removed
from the world

1225
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:15,054
I've been since Andrea died.
I know, I know. I...

1226
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,637
I think when something's right,
you just...

1227
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:22,099
You know it immediately.
Oh, yeah?

1228
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:27,066
<i>♪ I looked at the clock
And the clock struck 3 ♪</i>

1229
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:31,825

1231
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,083
- Do you--? Do you hear that?
- Wow.

1232
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,256
Can you hear the bass, though?
Yeah.

1233
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:50,586
Like, the bass and then
the high-end definition.

1234
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,966
I'm definitely
gonna get one. Yup.

1235
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,344
I'm giving you this one.
No, you're not.

1236
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,721
Yeah, I am.
Oh, my God. Heh, heh, heh.

1237
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,723
Come here.
You're so sweet.

1238
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,180
You're sweet.
You're sweet.

1239
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,733
You wanna dance?
Yeah.

1240
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:06,980
Isn't this dancing?

1241
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,654
Yeah, this is slow
dancing, which is really...

1242
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:13,154
What? Ha, ha, ha.
Well, it's the key, I always say

1243
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:14,530
to good lovemaking.

1244
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:16,407
Is that right?
Yeah.

1245
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,950
Where do you
think Mom is tonight?

1246
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,036
Oh, she's got a date tonight.

1247
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,368
Oh, that's cool.
I wonder where she is.

1248
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,750
Well, I don't think she's
at Chuck E. Cheese.

1249
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,507
I'm gonna babysit you.
I'm a good babysitter.

1250
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,084
Yeah.
You know?

1251
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,421
You should babysit. I used to
babysit when I was a teenager.

1252
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,222
It's how you make
extra money.

1253
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:39,426
Mom said you never did any work,
because you were so rich.

1254
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:44,098
Well, I didn't know
what I wanted to become.

1255
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:48,526
And Hal, my husband,
he swept me off my feet.

1256
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:52,656
"Blue Moon" was the song that was
playing. You know the song "Blue Moon."

1257
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,109
Yeah, but I always wanted
to do something with my life.

1258
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:58,870
You know, I had energy.

1259
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:02,283
I didn't just shop and lunch
and go to matinees.

1260
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,788
You know, I ran charities
for poor people

1261
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:08,212
and, you know, raised some money
for museums and schools.

1262
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,508
You know, with wealth
comes responsibilities.

1263
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:16,430
I wasn't just some mindless consumer
like so many of my so-called friends.

1264
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:20,099
Though I won't say
I dislike buying pretty clothes.

1265
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,393
Tip big, boys.

1266
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:27,724
Tip big, because you get good service
and they count on tips.

1267
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,152
You know, someday
when you come into great wealth,

1268
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,354
you must remember
to be generous.

1269
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,783
Mom said you used to be okay,
but you got crazy.

1270
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,985
Yeah, and then you
talked to yourself.

1271
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:44,040
Well, there's only so many traumas
a person can withstand

1272
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,619
until they take to the streets
and start screaming.

1273
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:53,299
That's right, boys, they picked me up
on the street talking to myself

1274
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:56,298
and gave me something
called Edison's Medicine.

1275
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,254
Why Edison?

1276
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:02,468
Because they use electricity
to get you thinking straight.

1277
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,388
See, everything
unraveled so quickly.

1278
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:10,271
You know, I started experiencing
anxiety and claustrophobia

1279
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,477
and this acute fear of death.

1280
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:16,690
You know, I had nightmares
and a nervous breakdown.

1281
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,993
I mean, you must have heard
of Prozac and lithium.

1282
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:23,367
Well, all those drugs
just made me worse.

1283
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:28,331
Of course, you know,
I probably did suspect

1284
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:32,539
that not everything Hal did
was always 100-percent aboveboard.

1285
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,128
Christ, I mean,
you'd have to be an idiot

1286
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:39,463
not to think his phenomenal success
was too good to be true. Heh, heh, heh.

1287
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,132
But a cheat is a cheat.

1288
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:46,678
And when he had other women,
I just flipped out.

1289
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:50,060
You know, and one thing led
to another and...

1290
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,476
But that's all history, boys.

1291
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:56,938
I met someone.
I'm a new person.

1292
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,031
Get everything?
Yes. These in the kitchen?

1293
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:06,706
Sure.
I can't believe how much you paid for it.

1294
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,159
I know it's ridiculous
and it's old.

1295
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,290
God knows if it even works.

1296
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:15,590
We have the terrace for a telescope.
Watch the stars over San Francisco Bay.

1297
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:19,048
Mm. And the moon will
look incredible through it.

1298
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:22,005
Ever seen the moon through that?
Oh, I can imagine.

1299
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:25,763
Hey, can I ask you something?

1300
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,261
Sure.
You ever think

1301
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,767
you could see yourself
married to me?

1302
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,725
Married?

1303
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:38,985
I have it all planned, but obviously
you can say no if it sounds terrible.

1304
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,567
All right? But you come with me
next month to Vienna.

1305
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,699
We live there for a few years
and I can teach you to waltz.

1306
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,907
And you can have all the chocolate
cake and wine you want.

1307
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:55,043
And then we come back and I get
serious about my political dream.

1308
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,840
And then we adopt kids
and we live in the house

1309
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,544
that you're gonna do such
a fantastic job making beautiful.

1310
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:06,971
What do you think? Downside for you
is you have to stand next to me

1311
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:10,223
and smile at photo ops
when I throw my hat in the ring.

1312
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:14,023
So you're saying you love me.
Can't you tell?

1313
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:18,148
I hope I didn't cause you to become ill
over the prospect of being my wife.

1314
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:21,356
You know, sometimes I get
these headaches.

1315
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,942
You always take Xanax
for a headache?

1316
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,735
I'll admit, my heart's
beating a little fast.

1317
01:13:26,761 --> 01:13:28,726
Yeah. Ooh, your
hands are shaking.

1318
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,658
I wanted you to want me
and now you do.

1319
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,788
Thank you so much.

1320
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:40,796
Have a nice day. You got it?
Okay, I'll take that.

1321
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,049
What are you doing here?
You know why I'm here.

1322
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:47,265
I told you not to bother me.
You're sleeping with Al.

1323
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,467
You're not gonna make
a fool out of me.

1324
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,599
Chili, this is not the place
to discuss this, okay?

1325
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,476
Sir, is there a problem?
Sorry.

1326
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,897
No, there's no problem.

1327
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:59,477
Ginger, Ginger, I love you.
Ginger, what's going on?

1328
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:00,982
What happened?
Nothing.

1329
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,657
No, I just need a-- Just need a
break from everything to think.

1330
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:08,987
All right, look, I blame this on Jasmine.
No, she's just looking out for me.

1331
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:12,039
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you,
okay? I don't like her.

1332
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,617
You meant nothing to her
until she needed you.

1333
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,795
I'm working, Chili.
I'm nuts about you, Ging.

1334
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:21,875
I'm nuts about you. We're gonna do
all these things together, big things.

1335
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,552
What great things, huh?
You're a grease monkey.

1336
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:29,303
And I'll be bagging groceries all my life.
She's cuckoo, baby. She talks to herself.

1337
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,680
You told me that yourself.
I need space.

1338
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,137
Just give me some space,
okay?

1339
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,439
I can't sleep.

1340
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:40,272
I'm a nervous wreck.
Oh, for chrissake.

1341
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,820
I can't get you off of my head.

1342
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,320
Stop it. Will you stop crying?
There's people around.

1343
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:48,743
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

1344
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,069
- Oh, my God.
- I don't.

1345
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,655
Stop it. Stop it, please.
I got this, okay?

1346
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:56,117
Would you like to sit in my office?
No. But I appreciate it.

1347
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,794
Look, who's this guy, Al?

1348
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,464
What does he do?
You know what he doesn't do?

1349
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,713
He doesn't make scenes
where I work in public.

1350
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,921
Come on, brother.
Would you like a Kleenex?

1351
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:12,008
I love her so much.
It's okay. There's nothing to see, okay?

1352
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,593
Great.

1353
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,772
Hello.

1354
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,406
Hello.
Hi.

1355
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,029
Hi.

1356
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,406
You seem up.

1357
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:39,164
He's taking me to pick out
an engagement ring tomorrow.

1358
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,875
Wow. How great.
What's that smell?

1359
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,798
Did you break a bottle of perfume?
Oh.

1360
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,801
Al doesn't call it perfume,
he calls it a fragrance.

1361
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:49,754
That's sweet.
But if I may say,

1362
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:53,341
you may have doused yourself
a little over-abundantly with it.

1363
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,678
God, I'm always
nervous it will wear off.

1364
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:59,435
He's taking me
to his favorite jeweler.

1365
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,766
You think Al is a
step up from Chili?

1366
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,727
Anybody
is a step up from Chili.

1367
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,482
He's such a gentleman.

1368
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:09,611
Well, then he's definitely
a step up.

1369
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,568
But in bed,
he's no gentleman.

1370
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:15,656
Wait till he takes a whiff
of my new fragrance.

1371
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,581
It's French.

1372
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,083
Yeah, I'm on my way. Yeah,
I'm on my way over right now.

1373
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,090
You're late.
Oh, God.

1374
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:34,299
I'm still shaking. What-S the matter?

1375
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:39,016
I think Hal is having an affair.

1376
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,978
With Lisette Boudreau?

1377
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,727
Who is she?

1378
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:50,531
That French girl.
The Jordans' au pair.

1379
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,697
What do you know
about this?

1380
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,574
You're the only one who doesn't know.

1381
01:16:56,779 --> 01:17:00,875
I've known about Hal's affairs for years,
but it's not my business.

1382
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:02,789
How did you find out?

1383
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:07,507
The Ritz Hotel in Paris called.

1384
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,925
Hal left his Rolex there.

1385
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,881
But he told me that he was going
on a business trip to Chicago.

1386
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:16,386
If he'd said Paris,
I would've gone along,

1387
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,845
and I didn't know what they were talking
about, so I did some checking and...

1388
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,351
I knew this day would come.

1389
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:26,476
I'm surprised it took so long.

1390
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,691
Who else?

1391
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,070
Victoria Alter.

1392
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,827
Raylene.

1393
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,404
This au pair.

1394
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,373
That trainer he used to take
to baseball games.

1395
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,702
Oh, my God.
You know how many people

1396
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:47,539
have said to me he's doing his lawyer,
the Chinese dragon lady?

1397
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,590
Can we get the waiter? I need a drink.
Yes. Waiter.

1398
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,043
- Yes, ma'am?
- This again.

1399
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,424
- Right away. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

1400
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,444
Hello?

1401
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,076
Yeah, is Al there?

1402
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,124
Al Munsinger, yeah.

1403
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,168
Yeah, uh--

1404
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:29,922
I know he works
in the Audio Department, yeah.

1405
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,249
Yeah, I'll hold.

1406
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,921
Hello?

1407
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:40,307
Al Munsinger, yes.

1408
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:43,762
Al, where the hell are you?

1409
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,847
What?

1410
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,688
What? I don't get it.
Why couldn't you come?

1411
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,112
Who found out what?

1412
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,949
Who's Ellen?

1413
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,117
Oh.

1414
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,459
Yeah, I--

1415
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:14,258
I didn't understand you had a wife.

1416
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:18,137
No.

1417
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,965
No, you never said.

1418
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,357
My mother was
very impressed with you.

1419
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,784
Really?
Yeah. You two had a discussion

1420
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:43,909
about her collection of pewter.
Yes. I love pewter.

1421
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:47,083
Hal used to have his beer
out of a pewter mug.

1422
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:48,659
And your dad?

1423
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:52,872
My dad can be very critical sometimes,
but he was very taken with you.

1424
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,629
Well, don't worry,
I won't pick out too big a stone.

1425
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,257
Yeah, nothing larger
than the Hope diamond.

1426
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,714
Hey, Jasmine.

1427
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,886
What?
You don't remember me?

1428
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:09,647
Of course I remember you.
What a surprise.

1429
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,809
Yeah, surprise, surprise, huh?

1430
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,778
This is Augie.
Dwight.

1431
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,821
Dwight. Hi.
How you doing?

1432
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,695
I was married to
her sister.

1433
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,114
Okay.
Years ago. Years.

1434
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:25,367
Wasn't that many years.
She makes it sound ancient.

1435
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:29,201
Congratulations. Ginger said
you got a new job up in Alaska.

1436
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:33,545
I could've had my own company
if it wasn't for you

1437
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:37,796
and that crook you married.
I don't think it's the time and place.

1438
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,722
Oh, really? You think I wanna lay oil
pipe way the hell up there in Alaska?

1439
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:44,298
I got no money.

1440
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,885
Christ, can't you put this behind you
and move on? I've moved on.

1441
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:52,269
Take it easy. I don't know who you are--
Right, you don't, so stay out of it.

1442
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,100
I saw your son.

1443
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,690
Yeah, that's right, Danny.
Remember him?

1444
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:02,574
Lives across the bridge in Oakland,
works at a music store. Antonio's.

1445
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:06,112
He's doing pretty good.
He's married.

1446
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:09,202
I think he's finally over
Hal's suicide.

1447
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:12,080
Danny's in Oakland?

1448
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:16,084
Let me tell you something,
Jeanette, Jasmine,

1449
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:19,258
whatever it is
you call yourself these days.

1450
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,426
Some people,

1451
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:25,131
they don't put things behind
so easily.

1452
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,890
You have a son?

1453
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:40,154
Yes, I have a son. He's not-- Biologically
he's not my son. He's my step--

1454
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:42,652
Hal's suicide?
I can explain it all later.

1455
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:45,700
Can we just--?
Not until you tell me what's going on.

1456
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,744
Not in the street.
I want to know.

1457
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,619
I know. We'll go somewhere quiet.
Get in the car.

1458
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,793
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
Okay.

1459
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:02,381
Of course we can't get married.
You lied to me up and down the line!

1460
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,212
No, I wanted to tell you.
Are you delusional?

1461
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,344
Didn't you think I'd find out?

1462
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,643
What were you thinking?
I don't know what I was thinking.

1463
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:13,972
Everything happened in the past.
You and I loved each other--

1464
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,852
What?
That it would just vanish?

1465
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,811
Didn't you think I would find out,
if not today, eventually?

1466
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:24,569
Like after we were married? Is that what
you wanted, to wait until it was too late?

1467
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,902
For your future plans where you
needed the appropriate wife?

1468
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,614
I won't say it wouldn't be an issue,
but that you could stand by,

1469
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:35,372
deceive me until I married you--
No, you mean till I trapped you.

1470
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:39,831
Your ethical behavior is equal to your ex.
I wasn't deceiving you. I loved you.

1471
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,793
I found out by chance, by sheer chance.
Okay, if it's over, it's over.

1472
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:47,426
I get it. You're not marrying me.
I brought everything on myself.

1473
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:51,850
I've only got myself to blame.
I did it to myself again, as usual.

1474
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,678
You and your stupid
little French whore.

1475
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:58,687
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Let me out of the car.

1476
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,610
Let me out of the car.
How are you gonna get home?

1477
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,734
I'm not going home. Let me out.
Let me out of the car!

1478
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:29,881
Hey, remember to tell her
when she gets here, okay?

1479
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,931
Believe me,
she won't care.

1480
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:34,885
She is half out the door.
Yeah, well...

1481
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:37,061
I didn't start out not liking her.

1482
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:40,266
I think she had it in for me
from the moment she met me.

1483
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:42,316
Well, I like you.

1484
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:45,442
Now, that's what counts,
not how she feels about you.

1485
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:48,320
You know, I'm sick of her
calling you a loser,

1486
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:51,869
or always pushing me
to find a better man.

1487
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:55,198
You know, in my book,
you're no loser.

1488
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:58,409
You're twice the guy I met at
the party she dragged me to.

1489
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,415
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1490
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,166
Well, I love you.
I know.

1491
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:05,211
I love the boys. I think
they love me too.

1492
01:24:05,237 --> 01:24:05,946
They do.

1493
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:10,504
When I thought I lost you--
You didn't lose me, baby.

1494
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,931
I almost lost you.

1495
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,374
Is this what you
gave up everything for?

1496
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:47,300
To sell secondhand
musical instruments?

1497
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:52,179
I asked Augie not to
tell you where I was.

1498
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:55,849
Why?

1499
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,344
What happened?

1500
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:02,806
Why did you disappear like that
and never contact me?

1501
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:06,519
I couldn't find you when I needed you.

1502
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:11,983
I know the whole story, I found it out,
so don't act so surprised.

1503
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:22,872
Are you having an affair
with Lisette Boudreau?

1504
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,712
Oh, Jasmine,
I can't do this without a drink.

1505
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:28,836
No, don't tap dance.
You never went to Chicago.

1506
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,385
You took the Jordans'
au pair to Paris.

1507
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:33,838
I know what's been
going on.

1508
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:37,807
Can we talk about this, please?
You bet we can talk about it.

1509
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:39,510
Can you do it calmly?

1510
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:43,348
I wanna talk to you about
what's going on, but you're always so--

1511
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,148
How do you expect
me to react?

1512
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:47,852
You've been sleeping
with other women for years.

1513
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:52,110
I mean, Raylene,
your secretary, our trainer.

1514
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,863
Amy.
This is different.

1515
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,944
This is serious.

1516
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:59,322
Lisette and I are in love.

1517
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,165
Wha--? What?

1518
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:03,792
Are you crazy?

1519
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:08,088
I'm sorry, but I need you to hear what
I'm saying. Lisette and I are in love.

1520
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:11,842
What does that mean?
What does that stupidity even mean?

1521
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:15,967
It means that we are making plans
for the future together.

1522
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,469
I'm sorry. I'm having
trouble understanding.

1523
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:22,053
I know this comes as a shock, but
I have to be honest with you.

1524
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:25,639
You wanna be honest.
That's the biggest joke of all.

1525
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,975
I've had casual flirtations
in the past.

1526
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,027
They didn't mean anything
until now. This is different.

1527
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:35,529
Are you out of your mind?
She is a teenager, for chrissake.

1528
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:38,406
She's an au pair.
I mean, are you crazy?

1529
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:43,081
Christ, this is hard for me to tell you!
It's hard for you? What about me?

1530
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,158
This is so humiliating for me.

1531
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,917
I mean, it is bad enough that
everyone knows you've been unfaithful.

1532
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:52,500
But to throw me away for this
stupid-looking little French--

1533
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,552
I will take very good care of you.
I'm sorry.

1534
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:59,177
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1535
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:02,100
I don't know what I'm--
What am I doing here?

1536
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:06,305
Oh, God, this is unacceptable.
This is not gonna happen.

1537
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:09,016
You're not going anywhere.
This is unacceptable.

1538
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:12,979
Jasmine, you're having a tantrum.
Don't you touch me!

1539
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:16,110
Don't you touch me!
You are having a tantrum.

1540
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,817
Stop, stop.

1541
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,744
What am I doing here?
Pull yourself together.

1542
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,288
I can't--
Jasmine.

1543
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:31,122
When you calm down, we can talk
like two civilized adults

1544
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,923
about the arrangements
we have to make.

1545
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:49,561
Until then I'm gonna
check into a hotel.

1546
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:01,861
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?

1547
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:18,169
Hello.
Yes, I want the number of the FBI.

1548
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:20,796
Can you connect me?

1549
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,382
The FBI.

1550
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,014
Mr. Francis?
Yes?

1551
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,846
Hal Francis?
Yes.

1552
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:32,149
I'm sorry, sir, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

1553
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,818
What?
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1554
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,487
Is this some kind of a joke?
No, sir.

1555
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:40,861
It's best if you come with us now.
Under arrest for what?

1556
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:43,660
Sir, come with us now.
We'll settle this downtown.

1557
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,079
Do you have a warrant?
I do.

1558
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:48,619
Gonna handcuff me?
We are.

1559
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:52,169
I wanna talk to my lawyer.
You'll be able to call your lawyer.

1560
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:55,293
But we'll warn you, you have
the right to remain silent.

1561
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,296
Anything you say can be held
against you in court.

1562
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,377
Okay, okay, let's go.
Let's go.

1563
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:04,135
Jesus Christ Almighty.

1564
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:08,928
What am I being arrested for?
We can discuss this downtown, sir.

1565
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:17,065
As disillusioned as I was with
him, I hated you more.

1566
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:23,735
The moment I did what I did,
I regretted it.

1567
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:27,571
I don't wanna discuss it.
It's past. It's over.

1568
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,373
You can't take back
that phone call.

1569
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,453
I need you, Danny.

1570
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,584
I don't wanna see you, Jasmine.
I want the past past.

1571
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:43,762
I've become a different person,
thanks to my wife. I'm off drugs.

1572
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:47,637
Just, please,
don't spoil everything.

1573
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,685
Just get out of my life
so I can move on.

1574
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:55,144
Heh, heh, heh.
Definitely. Heh, heh.

1575
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:57,775
- Hey.
- Hey.

1576
01:29:57,976 --> 01:30:00,980
Hey,
have some champagne.

1577
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:04,445
Chili brought some over
to celebrate.

1578
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,697
We're back together.
Heh, heh, heh.

1579
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:10,952
I'm sorry, I'm not
in a celebratory mood.

1580
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:14,376
I don't think I'd find that news
anything to celebrate about.

1581
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:17,580
Hey, come on, Jasmine,
let's not dig at each other, okay?

1582
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:20,666
I'm moving in, and she tells me
you found a rich husband.

1583
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:23,377
Gonna be a big shot in Washington.
We made up.

1584
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:25,178
She begged for my forgiveness.

1585
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:27,806
And he cried like
a baby and apologized.

1586
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:32,933
I didn't cry.
Bullshit. You cry all the time.

1587
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:35,309
But we're moving in.

1588
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:39,393
It's something we planned for a long
time and maybe if we'd just done it--

1589
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:42,104
Oh, for chrissake.

1590
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:44,781
What's wrong with
your self-esteem?

1591
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:48,986
There's men who'd never think
about ripping the phone out of the wall.

1592
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:52,744
Hey, leave him alone.
You're always picking on him.

1593
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,871
No, you choose losers, okay?

1594
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:57,373
Because that's what you think
you deserve.

1595
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:01,957
That's why you're living like this and
that's why you'll never have a better life.

1596
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,380
I'm-- I'm living--

1597
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:10,341
I'm living like this because
you married the biggest loser of all

1598
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:12,846
and went your own sweet way

1599
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:18,603
while he pissed away my one big
chance to make a better life.

1600
01:31:18,807 --> 01:31:21,310
Come on, let's not ruin
our celebration, okay?

1601
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:25,193
Come on, she's happy, we're happy.
Let's let sleeping dogs lie.

1602
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:28,867
He's right. I'm not gonna be
drawn into defending myself

1603
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:32,913
when all I wanted to do
was bring you in on a good deal.

1604
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:38,043
I'm moving out of
this place today.

1605
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,708
I just gotta get
myself together.

1606
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:45,418
Dwight asked me to move in with
him, as I expected he would.

1607
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:47,798
He wants me to finish
decorating his home.

1608
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:50,552
Then we'll marry and
we'll move in together.

1609
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,679
He's one of these men
who's lost without a woman.

1610
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:56,887
It has to be the right woman,
who's a plus for his career.

1611
01:31:57,095 --> 01:32:01,521
And I have the social skills
required for his future in politics.

1612
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:05,896
For the next few years,
we'll be living in Vienna.

1613
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,574
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna take a shower.

1614
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,617
I'll send for my luggage.

1615
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:19,577
I was pretty angry at some of the things
she said, but I kept it on the inside.

1616
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:25,629
I'm tired of her knocking you.
You know?

1617
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,844
Don't even think about taking
that last slice of pizza.

1618
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:40,647
What? Why?
That's my slice of pizza. Don't take it.

1619
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:43,225
Oh. Is it really?
Last slice belongs to the man.

1620
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:46,733
You're putting too much on the hips.
Is that so?

1621
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:49,940
Yeah, if you wanna keep me around--
This slice is yours?

1622
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:54,654
Don't touch it. Ginger, I swear to God.
Is this yours? Is this yours?

1623
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:57,413
Ah! Ah!
That slice of pizza is mine.

1624
01:32:59,532 --> 01:33:01,250
- That's mine.
- Yeah.

1625
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:03,579
- That's mine. That's mine.
- Ha, ha, ha.

1626
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:06,586
Oh, that's mine.
Those are definitely mine.

1627
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,963
- Is that yours?
Mm-hm.

1628
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,752
- Yeah?
Mm-hm.

1629
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:14,506
Yeah,
that's yours, okay.

1630
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,698
It's fraught with peril.

1631
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,573
They gossip, you know,
they talk.

1632
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:43,542
I saw Danny.

1633
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,121
Yes, did I tell you?

1634
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,591
He's getting married.

1635
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:55,172
A weekend in Palm Beach
means I can wear...

1636
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:00,352
What could I wear? I can wear
the Dior dress I bought in Paris.

1637
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:04,390
Yes, my black dress.

1638
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:07,726
Well, Hal always used to surprise me
with jewelry.

1639
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,779
Extravagant pieces.

1640
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:14,153
I think he used to buy
them at auction.

1641
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:19,287
It's so obvious what you're doing.

1642
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,198
You think I don't know.

1643
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:25,084
French au pair.

1644
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,959
This was playing on the Vineyard.

1645
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,885
"Blue Moon."

1646
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,978
I used to know the words.

1647
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,308
I knew the words.

1648
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,071
