1
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,500
Go inside.

2
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,500
Hurry up.

3
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,500
This way.

4
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
Hurry up.

5
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,400
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?

6
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
- l...
- No, that's mine.

7
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,900
<i>Alllz hup!</i>

8
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,000
How far are the trees, Danny?

9
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,400
Over 200 feet.

10
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,300
Yeah, l'd say 300.

11
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,500
Long ways to dig.

12
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,400
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
l wish Big X were here.

13
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,500
Willie, you think X got away?
He'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

14
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,800
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

15
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,300
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

16
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,500
l am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

17
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
- l'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

18
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

19
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,100
Good morning, Group Captain.

20
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,300
l'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer,

21
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,200
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

22
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,300
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of...
the word is ''policy''?

23
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,600
Yes.

24
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Thank you.

25
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

26
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,700
l am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.

27
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,100
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years

28
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,300
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

29
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,000
energy, manpower and equipment
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers.

30
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,100
At least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

31
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,100
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.

32
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

33
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,600
If they can't, it is their duty
to cause the enemy

34
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,500
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them

35
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,300
and their sworn duty to harass
the enemy to the best of their ability.
Yes, I know.

36
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,100
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

37
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,000
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

38
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,900
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

39
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,700
Archibald ''Archie'' lves:
11 escape attempts.

40
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Even tried to jump
out of the truck coming here.

41
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,100
Dickes, William.

42
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

43
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,200
Flight Lieutenant Willinski: four escapes.
MacDonald: nine.
Hendley, the American: five.

44
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,300
Haynes: four. Sedgwick: seven.
The list is almost endless.

45
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,100
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

46
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,400
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

47
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,900
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

48
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,900
No.

49
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,500
lt is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

50
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,500
This is a new camp.

51
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,200
It has been built
to hold you and your men.

52
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,900
It is organised to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

53
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And in me, you will not be
dealing with a common jailer,

54
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,100
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task
by the Luftwaffe high command.

55
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,000
We have in effect put
all our rotten eggs in one basket,

56
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

57
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,300
Very wise.

58
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
You will not be denied the usual facilities.

59
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,600
Sports, a library, a recreation hall,

60
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
and for gardening we will give you tools.

61
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,300
We trust you to use them for gardening.

62
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Devote your energies to these things.

63
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,100
Give up your hopeless
attempts to escape.

64
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,100
And, with intelligent cooperation,

65
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,200
we may all sit out the war

66
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,200
as comfortably as possible.

67
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,900
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

68
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,400
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- l was only kidding.

69
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,700
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

70
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,500
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

71
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,300
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

72
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,100
- In 1812 they burned your capital.
- That's propaganda.

73
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,900
It's in the history books. l read it.

74
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,300
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.
Yeah. No tools.

75
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,200
Hey, Virgil.

76
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,800
Hey, did you see the cooler?

77
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,100
Boy, is it ever a big one!
- l think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

78
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Those two guys who were with us in
the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.

79
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,800
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- l guess.

80
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,200
What were their names?
It was Jackson and...

81
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,400
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

82
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm gonna see who else l can find.
I'll see you later.

83
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,300
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

84
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

85
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,500
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

86
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,500
Willie, cigarettes.

87
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,500
Danny and l have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

88
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,500
Sure, man. What will it be? An all-out go?

89
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,900
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

90
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,300
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

91
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,500
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? it's mine!
Are you pushing me?

92
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,900
That's mine, you son of a...

93
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,900
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

94
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,400
It's all right, mate. We're just
having a friendly little argument.

95
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,200
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

96
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,000
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.
You, too!

97
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,700
Get away! Get back in your huts!

98
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,200
Go on!

99
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,400
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only
one other American in the whole camp.

100
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,800
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.
Hey, you got something going already?

101
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,100
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

102
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,100
- There's a blind spot through the middle.
- A blind spot?

103
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,900
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

104
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,000
They'd never see me, especially at night.

105
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,800
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

106
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,900
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

107
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,100
- You're not going out there?
- Not while they're looking, I'm not.

108
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,500
l think I'll take a little walk.

109
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,300
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.
Let me have it, mate.

110
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
- What's it mean?
- l love you.

111
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,700
l love you? What bloody good is that?
l don't know.
l wasn't going to use it myself.

112
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,300
Out. Out!

113
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,300
- Your friend, yes?
- Huh?

114
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,700
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

115
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,700
Get out, Sedgwick.

116
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,100
Hold it, hold it!

117
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,800
- Your name?
- lves.

118
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
lves.

119
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,500
lves. Oh, yes. Archibald lves. Scots.

120
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,900
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

121
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,500
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

122
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,900
l will not take action against you now.

123
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,700
This is the first day here and there has
been much stupidity and carelessness...

124
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,900
on both sides.

125
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Hey! Get out!

126
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,100
Don't shoot!

127
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,900
You fool! To cross the wire is death!
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

128
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,700
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

129
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,100
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am l gonna get my baseball?

130
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,100
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.

131
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,800
- Getting my baseball.
- Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!

132
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,800
- OK.
- You stay there!

133
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,000
Out of the way. Out.

134
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,800
What are you doing
over here by the wire?
Like l told Max, l was trying to get my...

135
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,200
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like l told Max...

136
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,500
l was trying to cut my way through
your wire, because l wanna get out.

137
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,400
Do you speak German?

138
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,100
Wire cutters.

139
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,900
l have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war.

140
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,500
And l flatter myself
that we understand one another.

141
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You are the first American officer
l have met. Hilts, isn't it?
Captain Hilts, actually.

142
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,900
- 17 escape attempts.
- 18, sir.

143
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,900
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

144
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,200
l suppose what's called
in the American army a ''hotshot pilot''.

145
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,700
Unfortunately,
you were shot down anyway.

146
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,900
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

147
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,400
- You have other plans?
- l haven't seen Berlin yet.

148
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,300
l plan on doing so before the war's over.

149
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,900
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

150
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,600
About 99 per cent.

151
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

152
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,500
10 days isolation, Hilts.

153
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,200
- Captain Hilts.
- 20 days.

154
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
Right.

155
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,100
Oh, you'll still be here when l get out?

156
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Cooler.

157
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,500
- Name?
- lves.

158
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,400
Flying Officer lves.

159
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,300
Cooler. 20 days.

160
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,900
- Cooler, lves.
- Pleasure.

161
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,700
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

162
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,900
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

163
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,900
No, l was in college.

164
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
- Say, lves.
- Aye?

165
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,900
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

166
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,100
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, l am that.

167
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,100
How tall are you, lves?

168
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,100
Five feet four. Why?

169
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,600
Oh, just wondering.

170
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,500
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

171
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,000
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.
Bicycles?

172
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,800
Motorcycles. Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

173
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,400
- Helped pay my tuition.
- l did a wee bit of racing myself.

174
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,400
- ln Scotland.
- Bikes?

175
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,800
No, horse racing. Jockey.

176
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
Jockey.

177
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,900
Jockey.

178
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,200
Hilts?

179
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,400
Are you there, Hilts?

180
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,400
Yeah, I'm here.
Don't you have them in the States?
Jockeys?

181
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,000
Sure.

182
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,500
They were the days. Saturday nights
in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

183
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
You had to fight off the birds.

184
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,400
You know, birds.

185
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,400
Girls, man. Girls.

186
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,000
Do you not have them in the States?

187
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,500
Hilts?

188
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,500
Are you there, Hilts?

189
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,900
lves.

190
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,400
What?

191
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,000
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we got here in the compound?

192
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,000
How many feet do you think
you could get through in eight hours?

193
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,400
l could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

194
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,100
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

195
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,600
and getting the dirt out -
that's what you've to worry about.

196
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,500
No, it isn't, lves.
You don't have to worry about that.

197
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,300
How are you going to get the dirt out?

198
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,700
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

199
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,700
Aye.

200
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,800
Well, what do you think?

201
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,300
l must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

202
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,100
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

203
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,200
Eric.

204
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,400
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

205
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,600
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

206
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,400
He has arrived.

207
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,900
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

208
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:02,700
l suggest this prisoner be kept
under the strictest
security confinement permanently.

209
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,300
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

210
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,700
We have reason to believe
he is the leader
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

211
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,700
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

212
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,100
and the Gestapo has only
''reason to believe''?

213
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,100
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

214
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,500
Air-force officer prisoners are
the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

215
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,400
not the SS,

216
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,900
or the Gestapo.

217
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,200
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

218
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,000
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

219
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,100
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

220
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,000
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

221
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,500
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

222
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,300
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

223
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,200
Herr Kuhn.

224
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,400
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

225
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,900
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?
Well, it's new.

226
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,600
Here. Let's find you a bed.

227
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,600
Thanks.

228
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,000
Come in.

229
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,700
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

230
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,900
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

231
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,800
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

232
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,300
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

233
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,600
- l saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

234
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,000
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

235
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,100
You met the commandant?

236
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Yes, l did.

237
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,000
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

238
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,600
They wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.
Who else is here? Cavendish?

239
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,500
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

240
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,500
- Blythe?
- Yes.

241
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,500
Almost the whole X organisation.

242
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,400
Almost. They cleaned out all the other
camps and dumped us in this one.

243
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,300
As Von Luger put it:
''All the rotten eggs in one basket.''

244
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,600
There's madness in their method.
What about Tommy Bristol?

245
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,400
No, but there's an American - Hendley.

246
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,600
ls he a scrounger, blackmailer?

247
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,900
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

248
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,500
Last of the tea until
the Red Cross gets through again.
l scrounged this from Sedgwick.

249
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,400
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

250
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,700
Not nearly as rough
as l now intend to give them.

251
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,600
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

252
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,000
Too many lives are at stake.

253
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,900
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

254
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,900
You appointed me Big X,
and it's my duty to harass,

255
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,700
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

256
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,900
- That's true.
- That's what l intend to do.

257
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,200
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

258
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,300
that thousands of troops will be
tied up here looking after us.

259
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,700
How?

260
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,700
By putting more men out of this

261
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,600
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

262
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,400
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

263
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,900
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

264
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,600
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany here. You said so yourself.

265
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,300
Have you thought of what it might cost?

266
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,600
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

267
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,900
knuckle under and crawl.

268
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

269
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,800
l have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

270
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,800
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

271
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,900
the high command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,
not the Gestapo and the SS.

272
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,300
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command of the Luftwaffe,
then the SS and the Gestapo.

273
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,100
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

274
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,100
There's only one way to put it, sir.

275
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,700
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

276
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,700
If they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

277
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,400
l have no argument with you, Roger.

278
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,400
As senior officer, I'm merely
pointing out a pertinent fact.

279
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,300
When are you calling a meeting, X?

280
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,700
Tonight.

281
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,400
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the
immortal words of our new commandant.

282
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,900
''Devote your energies
to things other than escape

283
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,300
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible.''

284
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

285
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,700
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

286
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,500
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

287
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,800
In fact, we're going to
put the goons to sleep.

288
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,000
Meanwhile, we dig.

289
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,400
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

290
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,900
shows us that huts 104 and 5
are closest to the woods.
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

291
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,100
directly east
under the cooler and the wire.

292
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,200
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

293
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,100
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

294
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,700
- l make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.

295
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,600
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

296
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,900
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

297
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,200
<i>All right, Roger,
but did you say the first tunnel?
l did. There'll be three.</i>

298
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,500
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

299
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,400
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and
Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

300
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,100
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

301
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,800
How many men do you
plan to take out, Roger?

302
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
250.

303
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,900
There'll be no half measures this time.
identification papers for everyone.

304
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,100
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

305
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,600
- 250?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

306
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,600
Yes, but...

307
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,700
OK, Roger.

308
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,400
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

309
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

310
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,300
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.
We're going to tunnel.

311
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,500
Splendid.

312
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,200
Willie, you and Danny will be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

313
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,500
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as l said, tailor.

314
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,100
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac,
of course, will take care of intelligence.

315
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,500
Hendley. We haven't met.

316
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,500
- Scrounger?
- Right.

317
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,900
Dennis, maps and surveys.

318
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,300
Colin, you'll take your usual job. Eric,
how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

319
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,300
Usual places. l hadn't anticipated
three tunnels, but we'll manage.

320
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,700
Roger, who's going to handle
security for all this?

321
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,600
You are. l want a system of stooges
covering this compound

322
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,500
from front to back,
checking every goon in and out.

323
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,700
l want a signal system so perfect
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet

324
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,400
of any of the huts in which we're working,
we can shut down without a sign.

325
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,800
Well, l don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

326
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,700
I'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit, and we'll pound out the details.

327
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,300
Nothing else, is there, Mac?
l shouldn't think so, Roger.

328
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Oh, hello.

329
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,800
My name's Blythe.

330
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,200
Hendley.

331
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,900
- For birds.
- l used to do a little hunting myself.
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

332
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,400
Oh, a bird watcher?

333
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,100
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

334
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,400
l suppose you have
bird watchers in the States?
Yes, we have some.

335
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,900
Tea?

336
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,600
l only drank tea once, in the hospital.

337
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,000
Where's your kit?

338
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,200
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

339
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,300
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

340
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,000
Such as.

341
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,700
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

342
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,200
l'll need a camera.

343
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,800
- What kind?
- A good one.

344
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

345
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,800
All right.

346
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,700
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

347
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,400
Oh, Hendley. l need a pick. Big heavy one.

348
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,100
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

349
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,600
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

350
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,500
I must have used these
wretched leaves about 20 times.

351
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,000
It's not that l mind so much.

352
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,700
Tea without milk is so uncivilised.

353
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,300
Yeah.

354
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,200
I'll get our wood.

355
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,500
Close up! Close up!

356
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,100
Close up!

357
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,100
Close up!

358
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,400
Close up!

359
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,800
<i>- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!</i>

360
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Splendid.

361
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,900
Blythe, what are you doing here?

362
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,400
I'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance interpretation.

363
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,200
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
it's my own silly fault.

364
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,000
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.

365
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,800
- No, l mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

366
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,900
I'm the forger.

367
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,700
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

368
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,100
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 1 10.

369
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,700
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

370
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
109? Right.

371
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,300
I'll work in 107. For now, Danny, Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

372
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,500
l want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

373
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,700
We will need timber for the shafts
and the entrance chambers.

374
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,400
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

375
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,000
We can tear up 15 and move the men
around so the goons won't miss them.

376
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
The rest will come
from strips off the wall.

377
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,100
- Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

378
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,700
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

379
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,800
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

380
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,900
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

381
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,300
Get away!

382
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,100
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

383
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,800
Stop this nonsense!

384
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Get away!

385
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,800
Turn the water off!

386
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,100
Somewhere!

387
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,000
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.

388
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,300
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.

389
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,400
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 113's wash room.

390
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,000
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

391
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,700
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

392
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,300
Not when you're organised, Mac.

393
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,700
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

394
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,500
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

395
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,000
Good luck to us, Danny.

396
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,100
Why 17?

397
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,000
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

398
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,400
All right?

399
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,700
It's good.

400
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,100
It's very good.

401
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,700
Get out! Get out!

402
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,700
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

403
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,100
Mopping up.

404
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,800
- And you?
- Shower. l need a wash.

405
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,500
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

406
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,200
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

407
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,700
No. I vote no. Look, we've put
the goons to sleep exactly like you said.

408
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,100
But just one little thing like this
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

409
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,500
- lves, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

410
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,900
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

411
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,400
l understand you two
are contemplating a blitz-out.

412
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,800
Where'd you hear that... sir?

413
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,500
MacDonald. it's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

414
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,300
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.

415
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,700
Why? it's only a two-man job.

416
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,300
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

417
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,200
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

418
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,300
It's just that... well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

419
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,100
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire - a blind spot.

420
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,500
Then we dig down, take the dirt,
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

421
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,300
and then straight out.

422
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,200
lves here is a tunnel man, so he digs
in front, pushes the dirt behind him.

423
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,900
I stash it behind me, then we burrow
through the dirt like a couple of moles.

424
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,800
By dawn we're under the wire, across
the open space, into the woods and gone.

425
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,000
Well...

426
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,100
When do you intend to try this?

427
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,400
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

428
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,100
Hilts, this may not be quite
the right time for this sort of thing.

429
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:55,700
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,
bloody close to being wire-happy.

430
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,700
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

431
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,600
It'll work. l know it will.

432
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,700
Good luck.

433
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,700
Thank you.

434
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,600
- Hilts, um... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

435
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,200
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.
Good night, sir.

436
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,800
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

437
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,000
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

438
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,000
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

439
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,500
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.
If we stop all the breakouts,

440
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,000
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling.

441
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,500
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going
to be in the cooler for an awful long time.

442
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,400
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

443
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,500
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

444
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,100
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

445
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,200
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

446
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,700
It's the first place the ferrets would look.
l saw one measuring yesterday.

447
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,100
Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.

448
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,100
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

449
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,400
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

450
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,700
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

451
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,000
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

452
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,200
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

453
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,100
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

454
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,400
Didn't they teach you
promptness in the RN?

455
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,400
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

456
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:39,500
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.
Well, of course.

457
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,000
Would you mind?

458
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,400
Now...

459
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,400
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

460
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,700
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

461
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:08,000
you wander out into the compound
where you pull these
strings in your pockets.

462
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,100
Out come the pins.

463
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,600
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.

464
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,300
Unless you're a fool,
the ferrets won't see a thing.

465
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,300
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

466
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,500
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

467
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,700
Mac, this is what we'll do.

468
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,200
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

469
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,400
Nice garden you've got, sir.

470
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,900
All right. Let's look sharp.

471
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,300
That looks sharp.

472
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,500
Sir.

473
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

474
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,900
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

475
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,900
I am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.
We'll manage, sir.

476
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I must say I am surprised with
the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

477
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,800
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

478
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,500
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants
to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.

479
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,600
The English are keen on gardening.
Oh, yes, but flowers. ls this not so?

480
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,700
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

481
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,600
Good point.

482
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

483
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,200
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

484
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,100
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

485
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,900
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

486
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,200
Here we are. Now, let's see.

487
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,700
Biscuits, two packets.

488
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,000
Coffee, two tins.

489
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,300
Bovril, one jar.

490
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,900
Cigarettes, six packets.

491
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,200
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

492
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,300
And marmalade, mine.

493
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,700
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

494
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,200
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

495
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,500
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organisation.

496
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,700
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

497
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,900
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.
I'll see what l can do.

498
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,500
And, of course, any other
identity cards, personal papers,

499
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,900
documents you can put your hands on.
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

500
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,900
Good luck.

501
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,500
O come all ye faithful

502
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,700
Joyful and triumphant

503
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,700
O come ye

504
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,300
O come ye to Bethlehem

505
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,700
Come and behold Him

506
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,700
Born the King of Angels

507
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,300
O come let us adore Him

508
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,700
O come let us adore Him

509
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,300
O come let us adore Him

510
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,800
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

511
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,600
Yes, I know, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open,

512
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,300
and this is holding us up very badly.

513
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,900
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

514
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,700
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

515
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,100
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

516
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,800
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

517
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,100
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

518
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,700
Mac.

519
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,700
Excellent.

520
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,900
Have it in by tomorrow night.

521
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,200
Christ the Lord

522
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,500
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

523
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,100
Thanks.

524
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,600
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

525
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,900
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

526
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,100
I'll smoke it later when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

527
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,300
You probably have
a couple of room-mates, huh?

528
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,800
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.

529
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,300
No, no.

530
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,500
Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

531
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,600
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
It was a red sky last night.

532
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,900
I never heard that before.
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

533
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,400
- You were a Boy Scout? So was I.
- Really?

534
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,500
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

535
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,800
I was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting

536
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,500
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

537
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,400
Werner, you think you'll stay
in the army after the war?

538
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,200
No. I'm not a well man.

539
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,100
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

540
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,100
Yes. I could tell you
stories about my teeth
that would make your hair stand on end.

541
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,500
Our dentist here is a butcher.

542
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,400
But don't tell anyone I said so.

543
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,600
It's a soldier's right to complain.

544
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,900
Maybe in your army, but here?

545
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,700
One little criticism,
and... to the Russian front.

546
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,200
Is that so? Terrible.

547
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,900
That's terrible.

548
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,000
Werner.

549
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,800
Why don't we go into my room?

550
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:42,000
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...

551
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,900
I was just gonna make some coffee.

552
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,200
Real coffee.

553
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,900
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

554
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,900
Where is it?

555
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,900
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

556
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,500
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

557
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,400
Yeah. Keep it.

558
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,500
<i>Nein. I must go.</i>

559
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,700
It's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.

560
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,800
With you in the cooler,
will we be friends? I must report this.

561
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,000
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?

562
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,800
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.

563
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,400
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

564
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,400
I'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.

565
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,500
And that, 
I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

566
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,900
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman -
the masked shrike.

567
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,500
<i>Kanius nubicus. The butcherbird.</i>

568
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,900
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

569
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:00,700
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the colouring.

570
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,100
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

571
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:09,400
A black rump, a black crown with a bold
white flash, and a white line over the eye.

572
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,200
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

573
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,500
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

574
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,700
The shrike lives in lightly wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

575
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,200
Well, Hendley, have you
taken to birds too now?

576
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,500
Yeah. Stick around.
You might learn something.
I have better things to do than draw birds.

577
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,500
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

578
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,700
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

579
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,400
<i>An Urlaubsschlin. Permission to
cross a frontier. Here's another one.</i>

580
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,800
Which one's the forgery?

581
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,300
- That one.
- That's right.

582
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,100
They both are.

583
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,500
What's holding us up now is
the new form of this travel permit.

584
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,000
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

585
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,400
And a military identity card.

586
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,700
And a...

587
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,300
<i>- An Auswlis.
- Yeah.</i>

588
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,200
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.

589
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,200
What appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week.

590
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,000
You get 10 out of 10 for this, old boy.

591
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,300
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

592
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,800
It's on loan.

593
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,900
In order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

594
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,500
I suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

595
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,200
I can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds,

596
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,100
and rather nice lounge suits.

597
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,700
Lapels. I can do quite a lot
of things with those.

598
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,300
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

599
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,400
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

600
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,100
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

601
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,600
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

602
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:22,800
And here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

603
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,300
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?

604
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,300
The goons'd have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

605
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:36,500
That's Sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.
This blanket.

606
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,600
Particularly the stripes. Marvellous.

607
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,900
- Coats.
- Yes.

608
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,700
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

609
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,700
Those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

610
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,600
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

611
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,700
Blanket ticking.

612
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,300
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

613
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,900
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

614
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,400
Just take a look at this, Roger.

615
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:09,500
Now, this blanket material, we scrape
this down until it's really smooth,

616
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,700
and then dye it with boot polish.

617
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,700
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

618
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,500
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

619
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,900
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

620
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,600
- What did he say?
- ''Don't ask.''

621
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,400
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

622
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,200
Good morning, Hilts.

623
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,900
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, l am.

624
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,900
- When?
- 17 days. 7th of July.

625
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:08,300
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.
ls lves going with you?

626
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,100
Yeah, if he wants to.

627
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,500
You know that lves is close to cracking?

628
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,400
Yeah.

629
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,900
- Better for him to go out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

630
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,500
Right.

631
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,200
It's possible for one man to get out
through the wire, even get away,

632
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,700
but there are in fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself

633
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,500
in this camp who are trying to escape.

634
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,900
I appreciate that.

635
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,300
Something's coming - I can feel it -

636
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,800
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

637
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,500
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

638
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,200
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

639
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,300
Yes, well, as I was saying, Hilts,

640
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,300
we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

641
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,400
We have all the information we need
for the escape routes out of Germany.

642
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,700
But what we do not have...

643
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,100
Is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

644
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,900
We've tried every goon in the camp.
No go.

645
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,600
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

646
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,500
We want to know where
we hit the main roads.

647
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:33,100
Where the police stations are,
where they've got their roadblocks.

648
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:37,500
And most important of all,
we've got to know how to get from here

649
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,000
to the railway station.

650
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,500
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,

651
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,100
I'm not gonna be
making maps for you guys.

652
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,600
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

653
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,400
- Understandable.
- Completely.

654
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,200
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

655
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,800
Interesting idea.

656
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,000
- How many you taking out?
- 250.

657
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,600
250?

658
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,500
Yeah.

659
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,000
You're crazy. You too.

660
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,600
250 guys just walking down the road,
just like that.

661
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,300
Well, some on the road, some by train,
some cross-country.

662
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,700
They'll have forged papers, clothes,
maps, compasses, rations.

663
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,500
You're gonna alert
every goon in the country.

664
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,600
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

665
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,500
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

666
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,000
Yes, well, thanks, anyway.

667
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,300
- If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.
Any time.

668
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:55,700
Wait a minute. You aren't seriously
suggesting that if I get through the wire

669
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,700
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

670
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,500
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler

671
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:04,000
so you can get the information you need?

672
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:08,600
Yes. One has to ask some very
strange things in the job I have.

673
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,700
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.

674
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,600
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.

675
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,100
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.

676
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

677
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,800
Check.

678
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,400
Herr Hendley, I...

679
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,200
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

680
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,400
- What's the matter, Werner?
- My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

681
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,600
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

682
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,300
He lost his wallet.

683
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,700
Do you realise what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

684
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,400
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

685
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,600
I've looked every place, every place.

686
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,600
I must have lost them while I was in here.

687
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,100
- No.
- Yes.

688
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,800
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

689
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,200
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

690
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,200
Werner.

691
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,300
Not now. It might look a little peculiar

692
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:23,200
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

693
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:28,900
Look, I'll find them. I promise you I'll
find 'em if l have to tear this room apart.

694
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,700
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

695
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,600
- Werner.
- Yes?
There is one small favour.

696
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,200
A camera.

697
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,900
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

698
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,100
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

699
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,200
Focal-plane shutter.

700
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,100
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

701
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,600
Let me know when you got it.

702
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:13,200
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner, but I like him.

703
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,200
Checkmate.

704
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,500
How soon's our air pump
going to be ready?

705
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,800
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

706
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,200
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

707
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,700
- No good?
- Today, three times.

708
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:09,000
Willie, you all right?
Pull!

709
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:41,400
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger. All 335 feet of it.

710
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,400
Four times today.

711
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:48,200
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

712
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,400
It's a lot of timber, Roger. Can you get it?

713
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,000
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

714
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,900
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

715
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,900
OK, Willie.

716
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,400
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

717
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,900
A partridge in a pear tree

718
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,300
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

719
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,800
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

720
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,300
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

721
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:27,400
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

722
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,000
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

723
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,900
Five gold rings

724
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,400
- How's it going with the rafters up there?
- Taking out one in four.

725
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,700
Stay with it.
Five gold rings

726
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:54,400
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

727
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:58,000
On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

728
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,500
Seven swans a-swimming,
six geese a-laying
Five gold rings

729
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:09,800
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

730
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,500
Five gold rings, four calling birds...

731
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,900
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.
Say, Cavendish...

732
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,000
Three French hens, two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear...

733
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,000
<i>Alllz hup!</i>

734
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,100
Never mind.

735
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,100
Here's a present from our friend Werner.
Splendid.

736
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,100
Simply splendid.

737
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,300
This should do very nicely.

738
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,400
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

739
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,800
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

740
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,900
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

741
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,100
- Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?

742
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,300
We make it 50 feet, sir.

743
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,500
- Dark of the moon is the 7th...
- 8th and 9th.

744
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,600
A day earlier in August.

745
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,200
Morning.

746
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,300
There he goes again.

747
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,900
Why is he buying up all
the potatoes in the camp?

748
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,700
I've been working on that,
but l can't find out.

749
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,300
Hilts and Hendley
lock themselves in every night.

750
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,500
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

751
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:59,500
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

752
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,900
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press on into the trees.
Right, Roger.

753
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,300
Wow.

754
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,800
Wow.

755
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,100
Wow.

756
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,100
Wow.

757
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,900
Wow.

758
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,500
Wow.

759
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,500
About face!

760
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,300
Forward march!

761
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,900
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.

762
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,900
It's the 4th of July.

763
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,000
What the devil's this?

764
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,600
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.

765
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:10,400
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.

766
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,000
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.
And to getting home.

767
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,500
Very well. We accept.
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

768
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,000
Gentlemen, follow us.
About face!

769
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,700
Company, halt!

770
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,100
All right, let's line up down here!

771
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,200
All right, grab a cup!

772
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,300
Line it up! Here we go.

773
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,600
That explains what happened
to the potatoes.

774
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,600
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

775
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,400
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

776
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,300
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you
can feel it throughout the whole camp.

777
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,200
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

778
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,500
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

779
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,700
Moonshine.
American moonshine. Moonshine.

780
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,300
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

781
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,600
Keep it moving.

782
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:31,200
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

783
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,500
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...

784
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,200
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!

785
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:44,300
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?
Keep it moving.

786
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,400
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

787
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,800
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

788
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,900
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

789
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,500
Get good and stoned, my friend.

790
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,500
Keep it going. Keep it...

791
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,600
No taxation without representation.

792
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,100
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

793
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:26,200
Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.
Well, let's drink to Tom.

794
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,200
To Tom.

795
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,900
In the three years, seven months
and two weeks that I've been in the bag,

796
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,900
that's the most extraordinary
stuff I've ever tasted.

797
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,400
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.

798
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,600
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.

799
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,600
Call on lves.

800
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,600
Cheers, Hendley!

801
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,500
You know what that is?

802
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,700
I'll tell you what it isn't.

803
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,000
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

804
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,500
How do you like it, sir?

805
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,200
Well, it's...

806
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,200
To the colonies.

807
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,200
Independence.

808
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,800
How are you managing over there without
us? Getting along all right, are you?

809
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,300
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir... sir.

810
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,100
Yes, well, it's...

811
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,200
It's good stuff, Hilts.

812
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,300
Thank you, sir.

813
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,600
Danny! Here's to...

814
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,300
Roger, goons in 105.

815
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

816
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:41,900
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons'll know the hut's important.

817
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,700
Here's to going home.

818
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:04,200
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.
Home!

819
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:20,300
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?

820
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,400
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.

821
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:31,100
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realise that myself.

822
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,100
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

823
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,400
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

824
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,800
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

825
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,800
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.

826
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,100
It's the tunnel.

827
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,100
Success.

828
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,300
lves!

829
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,400
Sir, let me know
the exact information you need.

830
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,900
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

831
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,100
Open up Harry.

832
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,700
We dig. Around the clock.

833
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,900
- Cooler.
- Right.

834
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,400
Well, l didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

835
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,800
He wasn't caught.

836
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,000
Hilts, welcome home.

837
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,000
Danny?

838
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,000
Danny?

839
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,600
Danny?

840
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,900
Are you all right, Danny?

841
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,400
Yes.

842
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,400
All right.

843
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,500
All right. Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

844
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:50,300
For God's sake,
you've left out a whole eagle.
That's impossible.

845
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,300
Yes.

846
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,800
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

847
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,900
I'm sorry, Colin.

848
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,000
It's all right, Smithy.

849
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,700
It's getting late.
You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

850
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,700
All right.

851
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,700
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.

852
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,200
I can't see a bloody thing.

853
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,200
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

854
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:27,400
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

855
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,900
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.

856
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:46,900
One, two, three, four, five.

857
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,600
Roger.

858
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:12,800
No, it's me.

859
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:19,000
How do you like the old escape suit?
Fine, fine.

860
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,200
Colin.

861
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,500
How do you like mine?

862
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,900
It looks splendid.

863
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,500
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

864
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,600
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

865
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,600
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

866
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,400
Please, Willie, let me alone.

867
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,100
I can't go in that tunnel any more.

868
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,600
So I'm going out through the wire.

869
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:21,500
Danny, think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

870
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,400
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

871
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,700
- I go out now.
- No.

872
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,300
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

873
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,800
Don't do that.

874
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,800
Willie...

875
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,500
Since I was a boy,

876
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:51,900
I hate and feared little rooms,

877
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,100
closets, caves.

878
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:58,900
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.
Because I must get out.

879
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I hide the fear, and I dig.

880
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:06,900
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men,

881
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,300
I'm afraid maybe this time
l will lose my head
and ruin the escape for everybody.

882
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,900
So l go now.

883
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,300
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

884
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:29,100
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

885
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,300
All right.

886
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,500
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

887
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,300
Well, how do you think we look?

888
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,600
It's as bad as all that?

889
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:57,000
Colin, l want first of all to say that without
you, we would not have been ready.

890
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:00,900
That's all right. l had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

891
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,300
What's the matter, Roger?

892
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,500
You can't go.

893
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
- What do you mean?
- l can't allow it.
Why?

894
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:16,400
You can't see your hand
in front of your face.
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.

895
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,400
That's ridiculous.

896
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,700
That's ridiculous. Never heard
anything so absurd in my life.

897
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,000
l can see perfectly. l can see perfectly!

898
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:30,100
l can see... that pin down there.

899
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,100
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

900
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,200
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?

901
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,900
Yes, of course.

902
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,700
Put the pin down there, will you?

903
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,200
All right.

904
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,100
All right. Come on.

905
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,600
Come on. Sit down.

906
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,500
Sit down. It was a good try.

907
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:13,800
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

908
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,100
- It's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

909
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,700
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

910
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,900
We all know the score here.
Well, at least, most of us do.

911
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:28,100
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

912
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:32,300
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.

913
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:36,800
But once we get past that wire and have
them looking all over Germany for us,

914
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,200
that mission is accomplished.

915
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,500
Afterwards, we have
some ideas of our own.

916
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,500
You mean getting home?

917
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,700
- Back to your family?
- That's right.

918
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:53,100
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?
I'm sure you have.

919
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,100
I know Colin has.

920
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:59,100
And, Roger, I have too.

921
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,100
We think we can make it all the way.

922
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:06,000
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the escape. That must be my decision.

923
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,900
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.

924
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,900
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

925
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,600
No one has said you can't go.

926
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,400
That's true.

927
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,000
I have thought about the Gestapo.

928
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:31,700
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,
or dare go,

929
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,200
or should be permitted to play God,

930
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,200
I can't answer you.

931
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,200
But I can tell you

932
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,100
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
to himself and the whole plan,

933
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:48,700
and must therefore be
eliminated from the operation.

934
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:03,700
Colin's not a blind man as long
as he's with me, and he's going with me.

935
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,800
It's all right with you, Colin?

936
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,100
Oh, yes. Quite.

937
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:29,000
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape
numbers to be altered accordingly.

938
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,800
Good night, gentlemen.

939
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,200
Actually...

940
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,500
he's quite right.

941
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,500
He's completely right.

942
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:51,300
I really shouldn't go at all.
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

943
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:54,700
I think they call it progressive myopia.

944
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:58,200
I can see things up here. Close to.

945
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,700
I can see to work, but...

946
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,700
you're just a blur.

947
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,700
I know.

948
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:13,100
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.
Colin, do you have any tea?

949
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:17,000
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

950
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,100
Splendid.

951
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,200
Hi, Hilts.

952
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,200
Hey, Mac.

953
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,800
When?

954
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:16,900
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.
Me, too. Let's get at it.

955
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,100
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

956
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:29,200
What time?

957
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,500
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

958
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:39,100
You OK?

959
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,600
Cavendish.

960
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,100
Griff, down there.
Goff, there.

961
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:16,200
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

962
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,100
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

963
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,400
There are the lights.

964
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,900
Right on the tick, Danny.

965
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,900
Look down the tunnel, Danny. It's lovely.

966
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,800
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

967
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,000
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

968
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,700
Yes.

969
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,700
No.

970
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,300
I don't know.

971
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,500
It's time, Roger.

972
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:42,700
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

973
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,000
It's all clear, sir.

974
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,000
All set, Roger.

975
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,700
Roger.

976
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,700
Good luck.

977
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,800
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny.

978
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:49,200
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

979
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,100
Willie...

980
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:00,200
I can't wait. I must get out.

981
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:04,000
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

982
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,300
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!

983
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,700
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

984
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,700
Danny, tell me what this is
and tell me quickly!

985
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,700
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

986
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,000
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.
Let me out. Let me out.

987
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,700
Take him out, Willie. Take him out.

988
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:10,700
Danny? What is it?

989
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,200
Danny, what's going on?

990
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:17,100
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.

991
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:25,400
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.

992
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:29,100
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

993
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:32,100
All right, Colin. Down you go.

994
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:36,800
Sit down. Feel the top rung of
the ladder with your right foot. Got it?

995
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,800
Down you go.

996
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,500
Danny cut out, huh?

997
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,100
Willie took him up top. Hilts, I...

998
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,500
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

999
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,500
Right.

1000
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:39,900
Bartlett.

1001
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,700
All right?

1002
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,400
- Hold on to yourself. You're 20 feet short.
- What do you mean?

1003
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:25,200
20 feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1004
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:29,500
The guard is between us and the lights.
How could that happen?

1005
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:33,000
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

1006
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,600
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1007
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,900
We could postpone it.

1008
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,400
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1009
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,700
One chance. When the guard goes to the
far end, you might be able to move out.

1010
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:07,700
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1011
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:12,300
What about the towers?
They're gonna be watching
the compound, not the woods.

1012
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:19,600
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1013
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:21,800
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1014
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:25,500
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1015
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:29,300
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1016
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:30,800
- What?
- 30 feet of rope!

1017
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1018
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:53,100
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1019
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:57,300
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

1020
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:20,400
He's over there.

1021
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,300
Right. You go first, Eric.

1022
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:31,900
I'm staying here till we get moving.

1023
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:46,300
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.
Right.

1024
01:51:58,600 --> 01:51:59,900
Thank you.

1025
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,900
- Good luck.
- Right.

1026
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:27,600
We're moving.

1027
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:38,000
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1028
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:45,700
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and
came to England because you're a flier.

1029
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:50,000
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1030
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:53,200
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1031
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:56,800
If you don't go through that tunnel,

1032
01:52:56,900 --> 01:53:00,800
everything you've done
will have been for nothing - nothing!

1033
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:30,500
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1034
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:34,400
In here, Colin.

1035
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,800
Sit down.

1036
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:44,000
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

1037
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,200
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1038
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:53,500
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.

1039
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:59,700
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?

1040
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:02,400
l wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1041
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,500
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?

1042
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,900
Hilts is on the other end
of that rope in the woods.

1043
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:18,500
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go, but keep Colin low.

1044
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:22,100
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1045
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:33,000
What's that?

1046
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,400
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!

1047
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,900
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1048
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,500
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1049
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:56,700
Willie.

1050
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,500
Willie!

1051
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:03,600
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1052
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,200
Get 'em out.

1053
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,200
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

1054
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:21,700
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.

1055
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:26,700
Light the lamps down there!

1056
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:32,700
There's been an air raid
and they've cut the lights.
Danny, it's all right. Listen to me!

1057
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,900
Danny, look.

1058
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:43,500
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1059
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,100
What the hell's going on?

1060
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,900
- You go.
- No. Danny.

1061
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,600
Go.

1062
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:07,700
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.

1063
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:12,100
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.
Get him out fast.

1064
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:16,300
Come on.

1065
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:20,500
Come on, Danny, move.

1066
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:37,900
Up you go.

1067
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:45,500
Give me your bag.

1068
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,900
We're on the rope!

1069
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:40,700
You and I had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

1070
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:45,200
It's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

1071
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:48,400
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1072
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,600
Come on, come on.

1073
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,000
Come on.

1074
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,300
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1075
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:15,700
Don't shoot!

1076
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,200
Don't shoot!

1077
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:24,300
Get off! We're coming back!

1078
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:49,500
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1079
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:54,600
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?
We would've heard the shots before.

1080
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:58,100
Pull!

1081
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,100
Wait for me.

1082
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,200
Out.

1083
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:28,400
Out.

1084
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,900
- How many did he say?
- 76.
76.

1085
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,500
- 76.
- 76.

1086
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,300
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!

1087
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:19,900
Half the guys who missed
their trains are piled up here.

1088
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,100
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.

1089
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:25,000
Makes quite a group.

1090
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:28,700
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.

1091
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,300
Tallyho.

1092
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:03,500
Tallyho.

1093
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,700
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.
All right.

1094
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:49,200
- I'll tell you when.
- I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.

1095
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,700
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1096
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,100
That's quite exciting.

1097
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:17,400
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.

1098
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,900
Switzerland.

1099
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:45,700
Hey!

1100
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,200
Bartlett.

1101
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:46,400
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- l... l hadn't quite decided.

1102
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:50,100
What information were you
to collect on the way?
None.

1103
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:53,000
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

1104
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,600
What have you done with your papers?

1105
02:16:56,900 --> 02:17:00,100
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1106
02:17:00,200 --> 02:17:03,400
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1107
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:05,500
All I did was escape from a prison camp.

1108
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:09,300
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

1109
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:13,200
- I wanted to get home.
- I don't think you'll see your wife again.

1110
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:17,900
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1111
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:22,600
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1112
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:26,500
This is my uniform.
I had to re-cut it when I lost weight.

1113
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:33,000
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover some oil smears
I picked up when I was shot down.

1114
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:46,100
And you lost your insignia
over the years?

1115
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:48,000
That's right.

1116
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:55,400
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

1117
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:20,700
Hello, boys.

1118
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:26,300
Hello.

1119
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:31,100
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1120
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:34,600
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1121
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:37,500
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1122
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:59,400
There's a trainer out there I can fly.
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1123
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:09,100
Colin, when I say go,
crank this clockwise.

1124
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:14,400
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.

1125
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,100
Go!

1126
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:18,500
Next stop, Switzerland!

1127
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:39,400
The Alps.

1128
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:40,800
Splendid.

1129
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:56,300
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1130
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,800
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.

1131
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:52,600
Go that way! I'll follow.

1132
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,400
Hendley?

1133
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:23,700
Colin!

1134
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:29,700
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

1135
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:37,900
Colin, I'm sorry l fouled things up.

1136
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,900
That's all right.

1137
02:24:41,900 --> 02:24:43,700
Thank you for...

1138
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:47,500
getting me out.

1139
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:44,300
Cafe Suzette.

1140
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:18,200
Hello?

1141
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:20,700
Hello?

1142
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:57,700
Resistance.

1143
02:28:57,900 --> 02:28:59,700
Resistance?

1144
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:02,100
You are English?

1145
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:04,700
I'm Australian.

1146
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:10,000
- You can speak English. I understand.
- Bloody good. I'm a British officer.

1147
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:13,300
I've just escaped from
a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1148
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:17,200
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?

1149
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:19,200
Can you help me?

1150
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:25,500
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1151
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:10,500
Good luck.
Thank you.

1152
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,600
You are English.

1153
02:32:40,300 --> 02:32:42,200
Herr Bartlett?

1154
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:51,300
Your German is good.

1155
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:54,000
And I hear also your French.

1156
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:58,700
Your arms... up!

1157
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,400
Herr Bartlett.

1158
02:33:35,900 --> 02:33:38,200
And Herr MacDonald.

1159
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:43,000
We are together again.

1160
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:47,500
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1161
02:34:02,700 --> 02:34:06,200
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.

1162
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:09,600
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1163
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:11,600
Yes.

1164
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:14,100
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.

1165
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:18,900
I hope to God I haven't
blotted 70-odd ledgers.
Och, no, no.

1166
02:34:19,100 --> 02:34:22,500
We're all over 21 ,
footloose and fancy-free.

1167
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:25,500
We'd never have got as far
as we did without you, Roger.

1168
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:29,400
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1169
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:32,100
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1170
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:13,800
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1171
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:17,200
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1172
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:43,100
You know, Mac, all this - the organisation,
tunnelling, Tom and Harry -

1173
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:45,500
kept me alive.

1174
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:47,500
And even though we...

1175
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:51,100
I've never been happier.

1176
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,900
You know, Mac...

1177
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:35,600
11 of your men are being returned today.

1178
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:37,100
Oh, who?

1179
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:39,600
I do not have that information.

1180
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:41,600
I...

1181
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:46,600
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that...

1182
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:51,200
50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1183
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:53,700
Shot?

1184
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:58,400
Their... personal effects will be returned.

1185
02:37:01,700 --> 02:37:04,200
How many of them were wounded?

1186
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,900
Here are the names... of the dead.

1187
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:14,100
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1188
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:17,100
None.

1189
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:19,900
They - the higher authority -

1190
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:23,500
only directs me to inform you that...

1191
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:28,100
that 50 men were...

1192
02:37:33,900 --> 02:37:35,000
I see.

1193
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Addison, John.

1194
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:40,900
Alladale, Peter.

1195
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:43,000
Bancroft, Edward.

1196
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:45,200
Bartlett, Roger.

1197
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:47,100
Cavendish, Dennis.

1198
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:49,300
Eldridge, David.

1199
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:51,900
Felton, William.

1200
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:54,700
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1201
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:17,400
I am your guide, senor.

1202
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,500
Spain?

1203
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:42,600
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1204
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:45,100
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.

1205
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:48,300
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.

1206
02:39:48,500 --> 02:39:51,000
What happened to Blythe?

1207
02:39:51,100 --> 02:39:53,300
He didn't make it, sir.

1208
02:39:53,500 --> 02:39:55,600
Roger was right about that.

1209
02:39:56,400 --> 02:39:59,200
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.

1210
02:40:01,400 --> 02:40:05,300
I've just posted the list. They shot... 50.

1211
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:07,900
The Gestapo murdered them.

1212
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,300
50?

1213
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:12,500
MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1214
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:13,900
Yes.

1215
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:17,300
Danny and Willie?
No, they're not on the list.

1216
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:19,600
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1217
02:40:21,800 --> 02:40:23,100
I'm sorry.

1218
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:30,600
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.
Mess up the works.

1219
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:33,800
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1220
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:36,900
Do you think it was worth the price?

1221
02:40:37,400 --> 02:40:40,400
That depends on your
point of view, Hendley.

1222
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:44,700
Yes, sir.

1223
02:41:32,100 --> 02:41:35,900
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1224
02:41:43,300 --> 02:41:49,100
The job just didn't work out, huh?
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...

1225
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:53,100
How many?

1226
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:55,100
50.

1227
02:41:56,200 --> 02:42:01,200
It looks, after all, as if
you will see Berlin before I do.

1228
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:53,500
Sir.

1229
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:01,300
Hey, Hilts!
