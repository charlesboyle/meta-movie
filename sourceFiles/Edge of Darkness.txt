00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:51,214
Come on, Daddy! Let's go play
on the beach!

3
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:53,019
I'm getting my shoes off. Hang on.

4
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:54,752
Come on!

5
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:57,856
Just run right in it.
Go on, run right in.

6
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,995
Yeah, it's cold...

7
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,907
It's gonna be a big castle.

8
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:14,040
Let me know if you strike oil, okay?

9
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,022
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

10
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:01,861
I've been waiting here forever.

11
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,122
Dad. The train was on time,
you're always early.

12
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,767
What, are you starting already?

13
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,961
- Why, you can't take it?
- Come on, let's go home.

14
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,691
You all right, honey?

15
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,875
You know, there's things
you can tell me.

16
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,846
I'm not as bad at communication,
and so on and so forth, as you might think.

17
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:02,984
I've lived in the world.

18
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,028
I'm not pregnant.

19
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,686
No. No, I wasn't saying that.

20
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,156
Yeah, you were.

21
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,106
- You seeing someone?
- Yeah.

22
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:27,340
Someone with a name?

23
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:30,878
Nah, you wouldn't like him.

24
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:34,282
Well, how do you know that?
How do you know I wouldn't like him?

25
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:37,046
I wish you had someone.

26
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:40,254
Well, who says I don't have a honey
stashed away somewhere?

27
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:53,701
You're my girl.

28
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,956
Hey, careful. Careful, it's hot.

29
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:57,493
Yeah, well, I'm not really sure
how to cook it.

30
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:01,437
You finally got a vegetable,
and I don't know if I can eat it.

31
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,634
You all right? You been to the doctor,
yeah?

32
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:06,608
When's the last time you went?

33
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,247
I get a physical every year.

34
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,679
- That's right, they make you.
- Hey, careful.

35
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,780
So how'd you get time off work?

36
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:17,321
- You don't even know what I do.
- Of course I know what you do.

37
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:22,720
Dad, I'm a glorified intern.
I can get off when I want.

38
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:25,058
I wanted to come home.

39
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,390
I'm glad you did.

40
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,737
Maybe you'll tell me
what's bothering you.

41
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:34,004
I'm just tired, you know.

42
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,875
I think I got a bug.

43
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,674
Yeah? Wanna lie down? Go on.

44
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:40,704
Go upstairs, lie down.

45
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:42,609
I got your room all ready for you.

46
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:44,011
I know you do, Dad.

47
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:47,517
Or, ginger ale.
That'll settle your stomach. I'll get some.

48
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:50,282
Always keep some ginger ale on hand.

49
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,435
Honey, hey.

50
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:07,938
Come on, honey. Come on.

51
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,271
- Okay.
- Dad?

52
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:13,504
My God! My God, Dad,
I have to go to a doctor!

53
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:16,577
I gotta tell you something!
I should have told you something!

54
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,047
What?

55
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:25,452
Okay, I gotcha.

56
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:28,756
Craven!

57
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,938
Jesus.

58
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:49,744
You're my girl.

59
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,080
I know.

60
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,134
Holy anoint-

61
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:11,263
Love and mercy.

62
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:12,803
May the grace of-

63
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:15,203
May the- May the-

64
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:53,510
- Hey, there's Bill.
- All right, I'll let him know.

65
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:01,445
About 5' 9", 5' 10".

66
00:09:01,622 --> 00:09:04,887
Thinks white from what he could see
through the eyes of the mask.

67
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,788
Yelled out one word: "Craven."
And then he fired.

68
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,020
Jesus Christ.

69
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:13,362
Hit Emma instead.

70
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,693
Then he ran.

71
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:16,733
Didn't pursue.

72
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:48,161
You want some water, coffee
or something?

73
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,834
Want something stronger?

74
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:57,634
I know somewhere in here there's a bottle
of Crown Royal with dust all over it.

75
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,083
You're gonna put the first foot forward.

76
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:09,015
Tommy, I don't care if it's now.

77
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,715
I'll sit with you, okay?

78
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:17,623
Get out. Get out of here,
he's not a basket case. Get out.

79
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:19,698
Somebody get him some coffee.

80
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,299
I want a glass of ginger ale.

81
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:22,901
Get him a ginger ale.

82
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:31,902
We'll get him, Tommy.

83
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:36,446
You know how we react
to things like this. Officer involved.

84
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,579
"Officer involved."

85
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:41,312
Well, we ought to do that for everybody,
right?

86
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:43,979
Officer invo- Who the fuck
do you think you are?

87
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:48,059
Well, if you wanna get philosophical,
I'll get philosophical with you.

88
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:51,687
Wanna get cleaned up?

89
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,799
No, I'm all right.

90
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:57,568
I want you to come stay
with Carol and me.

91
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:59,069
No.

92
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:00,899
You can't stay here.

93
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:03,403
It's where I live.

94
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,203
If you won't come-

95
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,248
Can't everybody just get out of here?
Just finish what they gotta do and go?

96
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:15,688
- This is someone armed and dangerous.
- What do you think I am?

97
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:19,983
Can everyone get out?
Don't like them gawking.

98
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,823
Can they just go? Finish what
they gotta do and go. Get out. Get out!

99
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:17,572
Emma Craven's phone.

100
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:20,178
Hello?

101
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,897
Are you all right?

102
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:47,405
Dad, are you all right?

103
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:53,510
Yeah, I'm fine.

104
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,142
Who's my little girl?

105
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,651
Em.

106
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:03,752
- Who's my little sweetheart?
- Em.

107
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,356
A fatal shooting last night of the daughter...

108
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:39,355
of a Boston police detective
leads our news.

109
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:44,395
Emma Craven, 24, an MIT graduate, was
killed in front of her home in Roslindale...

110
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:47,658
by a man thought to be
targeting her father.

111
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:54,340
Kathy, from what I understand,
police don't have much to go on right now.

112
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:58,204
Lisa, there is still a lot of unanswered
questions when it comes to this case.

113
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:01,142
24-year-old Emma Craven
was gunned down...

114
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:04,044
outside this Roslindale home
on the porch behind me.

115
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:07,118
Now, sources tell me the suspect
in this case may be someone...

116
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,311
Turn that shit off.

117
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:12,424
Detective Craven came across or had
a run-in with while he was working.

118
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,895
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

119
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:19,925
None of your neighbors saw anything.

120
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,263
And the rain hasn't left much
for forensics.

121
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,662
We're gonna need to go through
your cases, Tommy.

122
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,970
You must have an instinct on this,
something.

123
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,836
Not off the top of my head, no.

124
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:36,005
All right, well, they wanna see you
upstairs first anyway, so...

125
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,274
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

126
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,714
This is off-subject.
This is my daughter's phone.

127
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:43,219
I need a list of her contacts. I gotta
talk to her friends, associates.

128
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,585
Yeah. Janet can do that.
Don't worry about it.

129
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,783
Blocked incomings too.

130
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,298
Tom.

131
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,693
I am so sorry for your loss.

132
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:59,635
Anything you need from me and Mary.
And let us know about the arrangements.

133
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,069
It'll be in the Globe and the Herald.

134
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:04,335
I haven't been downst- You know, to...

135
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:07,071
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

136
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,241
Bill Whitehouse is running things.

137
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:14,751
He has every resource
this department possesses.

138
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:18,618
Hey, this is a cop thing. Officer involved.

139
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:24,124
So will you take a leave of absence?

140
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:26,022
No.

141
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:33,104
Tom, we can't have you
on this investigation. It's a rule.

142
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:36,606
Well, since it's me that's gotta figure
out who would wanna kill me...

143
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:39,939
for reasons only I'd know about,
then I'd rather get paid for it.

144
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:41,478
So the rules don't apply.

145
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,416
He's right, isn't he?

146
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:49,254
I think he is, yeah.

147
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,088
All right.

148
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,987
I gotta make a statement
to the media.

149
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,220
Is there anything you want in there?
You wanna stand with me?

150
00:16:57,397 --> 00:17:00,423
- No, thank you.
- Well, they wanna see you, Tom. The media.

151
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,261
I don't want any part of it.

152
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:13,575
I'm not gonna sit in the murder room.
There's no point to it.

153
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:17,614
There's no physical evidence.
If you had a gun or something-

154
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:20,878
Jesus. I can't think.

155
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:23,718
It'll come to me.

156
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,693
It'll come to me,
but it's not gonna come to me here.

157
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,726
I gotta drive around. I gotta think.

158
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:34,094
Right. You do what you need to do.
You keep me informed. I'll punch in.

159
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,661
- I gotta go. Coroner wants to ID the body.
- Are you up to it?

160
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:40,431
Yeah. I want my case files brought up.

161
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,337
Nothing this year makes any sense to me
at all.

162
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,977
Tommy.

163
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:51,379
I'll have them sent to your house.

164
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:53,451
Sure.

165
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:03,258
Cause of death:
injuries arising from gunshot wounds.

166
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,260
Massive hemorrhage.

167
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:08,429
Heart seizure due to shock.

168
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:17,237
Tom, this is very difficult.

169
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,807
You may think you've done this before,
it's not the same.

170
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,846
Let's get it over with.

171
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:35,559
Is this your daughter...

172
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,593
Emma Charlotte Craven?

173
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:39,859
Yes, it is.

174
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:43,362
Leave her alone.

175
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,633
Let me have some scissors.

176
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:17,265
What was that, Tom?

177
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:20,229
Scissors. I need some scissors.

178
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:15,689
Don't cry, Dad.

179
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:18,286
I'm not.

180
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:29,332
I don't know if I can make it.

181
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,239
You have to.

182
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:39,113
All right. All right.

183
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:49,017
And you're wasting 2 guys
here at my house, Bill.

184
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:52,426
If you want them in the neighborhood,
have them going door to door.

185
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:55,396
Someone's trying to kill you, Tom.
They're staying.

186
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:57,627
I got nothing. Nothing.

187
00:20:57,804 --> 00:20:59,795
I don't have enemies.

188
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:02,964
I never lived life or said what I thought
enough to have enemies.

189
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:04,541
Listen, you know I understand.

190
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:08,647
I'm not starting a personal conversation
with you, Bill, don't get nervous.

191
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,681
And tell the 2 uniforms in the cruiser
to stop pissing in the bushes.

192
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:16,014
They can come in the house.

193
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,873
This is your beach.

194
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,807
C'mon, Daddy! Come on!

195
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,009
Come on, Daddy! Come on!

196
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:23,587
Let's go play on the beach!
Come with me, Daddy!

197
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,088
Come on, Daddy!

198
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,450
Come on, Daddy!

199
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:31,461
Let's go play on the beach!

200
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:37,460
Okay, sweetheart, I'll be right there.
In a little while.

201
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:44,252
Tom.

202
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:47,027
You ready for this?

203
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,664
Ski mask found in a hedge 5 doors
from you.

204
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:53,566
We got hair. Caucasian. It's in for DNA.

205
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,571
- Keep me posted.
- Where you going?

206
00:27:07,473 --> 00:27:09,771
Mr. Burnham. Mr. Burnham, yeah?

207
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:11,068
Yeah.

208
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:14,440
Settle down, all right?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

209
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,385
See? You know my daughter.

210
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:22,578
What are you, her boyfriend
or something?

211
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:26,121
- Yeah.
- All right. Okay.

212
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,419
I'm Emma's father.

213
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:31,290
I'm gonna let you go now.
You're gonna be all right. Okay?

214
00:27:31,464 --> 00:27:33,830
- Yeah.
- Okay, be nice, okay?

215
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,331
Jesus Christ.

216
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:41,673
I'm sorry, but you gotta
get the fuck out of here now.

217
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:46,534
Give me a minute, all right?
I wanna ask you a couple of questions.

218
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:50,476
If you answer the door like everybody else-
What the hell are you so scared of?

219
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:55,349
Is this your handgun?

220
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,951
How did my daughter
get a goddamn handgun?

221
00:27:58,124 --> 00:28:01,821
- Did you give it to her? Is this your-?
- I gave it to her.

222
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:05,759
All right. Why?

223
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,669
I didn't notice a shotgun
in your list of weapons. You own one?

224
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:12,428
- You think-?
- This is your pistol.

225
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:15,233
You licensed it in Vermont,
it's illegal in Massachusetts.

226
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,706
I tell the police you opened the door
with it, automatic year in jail.

227
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:22,746
Not that I don't have you by the balls
for trying to stick me in the doorway.

228
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,145
- You'd be lying.
- I don't care.

229
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,810
I know you. You're her dad.

230
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:31,717
You never came to visit her.
Didn't even bother.

231
00:28:34,627 --> 00:28:36,094
Yeah.

232
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:38,930
You worked with her...

233
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:42,295
and I need to know
what kind of trouble she was in.

234
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:44,265
I can't talk about that.

235
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:47,633
There're security strictures.
Clearance to work where we do.

236
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:51,470
I can understand you won't help me.
But I'm confused you won't help Emma.

237
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:55,410
Look, she's dead, man.
There's no way to help Emma.

238
00:28:58,818 --> 00:29:01,013
There are probably 2 fucking guys
out there...

239
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:03,985
watching and listening to us
right fucking now.

240
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:10,521
Now, I'm sorry,
but you gotta get the fuck out of here now.

241
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,993
Please. Or I'm dead.

242
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:21,200
There's something I need to give you.

243
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:25,440
Yeah? Yeah, sure, go ahead.

244
00:29:51,637 --> 00:29:56,700
Here's the keys to her place.
And her personal things.

245
00:29:57,343 --> 00:29:58,833
Thanks.

246
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:04,806
Look, I'm gonna leave you alone now until
you realize you gotta talk to me. All right?

247
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:06,415
Yeah.

248
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:10,146
I know you're a good guy, or Emma
wouldn't have had nothing to do with you.

249
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:14,850
Here's my card.
It's got my cell on it, okay? Call.

250
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:40,737
You were right. I don't like him.

251
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:51,455
Why did you have a gun, honey?

252
00:33:52,478 --> 00:33:53,809
Jesus.

253
00:33:56,014 --> 00:33:58,608
So, what is it that I can do for you,
Millroy?

254
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,309
What do you do usually, Jedburgh?

255
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:05,716
If someone has a national security
problem...

256
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:08,758
they dial a number in northern
Virginia.

257
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:11,828
And then I decide what happens next.

258
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:13,290
What's your problem?

259
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,396
You're a consultant in security.
I'm merely consulting.

260
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:18,934
So consult.

261
00:34:24,009 --> 00:34:26,204
There's a company called Northmoor.

262
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:29,541
They own a number
of Defense Department contracts.

263
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:34,279
It's not an Agency front, if that's what
you think. It's a real private company.

264
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:36,580
That is unusual.

265
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,553
They have private security.
Autonomous security.

266
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:41,852
Well, I'm autonomous myself.

267
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:43,961
These are the facts:

268
00:34:44,563 --> 00:34:47,031
One of their secure facilities
was penetrated.

269
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,064
3 people died making their escape.

270
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:52,829
A 4th, an employee who may have been
involved, has been killed.

271
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:56,466
- By Northmoor security?
- I didn't say that.

272
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:57,734
No one would.

273
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,578
The fact is we don't know.

274
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:09,552
She was shot dead 5 nights ago.

275
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:12,315
Her father's a Boston detective.

276
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:16,689
The Boston police are working on the
assumption that her father was the target.

277
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:18,853
And what assumption
are we working on?

278
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,426
That he wasn't.

279
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:26,929
- Who killed her?
- That's not the issue at this point.

280
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:30,297
National security is the issue.

281
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,737
I know your function, Jedburgh.

282
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:35,743
This has to be cleaned up.

283
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:38,278
Whatever it takes?

284
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:40,709
Yes.

285
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:45,314
Are you absolutely sure
you want me to look into this?

286
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,957
Because you have to be absolutely sure.

287
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,999
- She was killed. In Boston.
- Yeah.

288
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:01,901
But this isn't part of that.

289
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:06,136
- You think it's a funeral robbery?
- Yeah.

290
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:10,713
Look, I don't want this getting mixed up
in the other business.

291
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:13,180
I don't need the trouble, all right?

292
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,454
- You do me a solid in Boston sometime.
- Thanks.

293
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:44,671
- Hello?
- Hello. My name is Tom Craven.

294
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,918
Your number
was in my daughter's phone records.

295
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:51,146
I'm Emma's father. I'm a policeman.

296
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:54,517
I just wanna know
what you were to Emma.

297
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:59,422
- Find out what happened.
- It says in the papers what happened.

298
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:02,660
Someone tried to kill you
and they got her.

299
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:04,495
Is that what you think happened?

300
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,968
I run a shop. A luggage shop.

301
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,206
I wanna keep running a shop.

302
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:13,902
Look, I'd like to talk to you in person.
I- Will you do that?

303
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:16,838
About Northmoor?

304
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:20,474
Yeah, sure, about anything
you want to talk about.

305
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,283
How do I know you're you?

306
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:28,449
Well, when you meet me you'll know that
I can't be anyone else but Emma's father.

307
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:32,756
Will you help me?

308
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:37,494
Look, I'm out of state.
I'm at my grandmother's.

309
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:39,897
I have your number, I'll call you.

310
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:55,851
I'm here to see John Bennett.

311
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,838
Detective Craven.

312
00:38:17,676 --> 00:38:19,268
Jack Bennett.

313
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:22,546
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

314
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:25,376
Can I say how shocked we all were
to hear of Emma's death.

315
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,415
She was a valued member of our team.

316
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:30,919
I can't say I knew her very well personally,
but she is well thought of.

317
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:34,388
- She is missed.
- Thank you.

318
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,993
In the '60s, this hill was excavated.

319
00:38:37,162 --> 00:38:39,130
It was a site for Nike nuclear missiles...

320
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:43,131
miles of tunnels and launch chambers.
I'm sure Emma told you.

321
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,428
No, she never talked about her work.

322
00:38:45,604 --> 00:38:48,232
So Northmoor bought this
from the federal government?

323
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,500
Well, we lease it.

324
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,667
- For money?
- Coffee?

325
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:57,572
- I'll have a ginger ale.
- Certainly.

326
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:00,247
Get Detective Craven
a ginger ale, would you?

327
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:02,910
- Of course.
- Please.

328
00:39:18,637 --> 00:39:20,502
You have interesting friends.

329
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,407
Yes.

330
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:25,267
This facility, R & D in general...

331
00:39:25,444 --> 00:39:27,776
brings a great deal of money
to Massachusetts...

332
00:39:27,946 --> 00:39:29,641
as reflected in the tax breaks.

333
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:32,006
How can I help you?

334
00:39:32,384 --> 00:39:34,784
I suppose I wanna know what my daughter
did here.

335
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:37,018
In what sense?

336
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:39,184
She didn't tell you about her work?

337
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:42,520
Perhaps because she was following
your security protocols.

338
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:45,362
And what are they,
in your understanding?

339
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:48,397
I don't understand anything.
She never talked about her work.

340
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:50,091
Right.

341
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:53,270
Well, you understand that most
of what we do here is classified.

342
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:54,632
Almost everything we do.

343
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:59,470
What she did, despite her qualifications,
your daughter was a trainee.

344
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:02,340
She was a full employee
and there's a benefit package...

345
00:40:02,514 --> 00:40:04,778
which I suppose you should see
personnel about.

346
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,043
I'm not interested in that just yet.

347
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,687
All our people are very well-insured.

348
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:12,285
I'll bet they are.

349
00:40:14,259 --> 00:40:15,920
Well, what we do here:

350
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:19,988
Northmoor is essentially
a research facility.

351
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:23,760
We have a mandate from government to
develop a safe and clean energy source...

352
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,403
based on fusion technology.
It's very green.

353
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,266
Weapons.

354
00:40:29,174 --> 00:40:30,232
You make them.

355
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:33,736
Well, if we did, it would be classified.

356
00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:35,641
I can tell you, you're a policeman...

357
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:39,477
and have access to this information
anyway, Northmoor's an important part...

358
00:40:39,651 --> 00:40:42,518
of the nation's nuclear stockpile
and maintenance program.

359
00:40:42,888 --> 00:40:45,083
We ensure that the nation's nuclear
stockpile...

360
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:47,589
remains ready
for the president's order.

361
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,556
Not weapons, raw materials.

362
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:51,025
Emma was a part of this?

363
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:54,632
God, no. As an intern, she didn't have
any direct involvement whatsoever.

364
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:57,097
She worked on the research floor.

365
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:03,302
We all very, very much regret
Emma's death.

366
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:07,236
It must be especially painful for you
in the circumstances.

367
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:11,309
You mean
that she was shot instead of me.

368
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:15,976
As a parent, I can only guess
at your pain, I think.

369
00:41:16,154 --> 00:41:18,884
Though I'm sure I cannot imagine
its full dimensions.

370
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:24,661
I've taken up enough of your time.
I'd like to talk to her friends, if any.

371
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:27,889
Yes, of course.
I'll see what I can do. I'll tell personnel.

372
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:31,502
Get you a list, contact numbers, so forth.
Can I ask you a question?

373
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,331
What does it feel like?

374
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:47,609
Thanks.

375
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:56,719
- Craven.
- You ready for this?

376
00:41:56,895 --> 00:41:59,329
- I'm ready for anything.
- We have a DNA match.

377
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:02,660
Really? Give me the skinny.

378
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,663
Clear right!

379
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,968
Got a man down on the couch!
Got a man down on the couch! Give me one!

380
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:13,838
Contact! Move it!

381
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:29,692
You're awfully calm, Tom.

382
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:32,762
Doesn't do me much good
to be any other way.

383
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:36,660
No buzz off this guy, nothing?

384
00:42:36,835 --> 00:42:39,736
This guy was a comer in his profession.
This guy was a hit man.

385
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:49,573
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

386
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:51,909
Tell me what you were looking at.

387
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,745
Says in the evidence log
the hair was 2 and a half inches.

388
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:56,352
So he cut his hair.

389
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:58,250
Not as recently as a week ago.

390
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:01,615
- So, what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

391
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:03,920
Hair can stick to a hat for a long time,
years.

392
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:09,363
Decades. And why would a pro
blow off 2 barrels of his shotgun...

393
00:43:09,534 --> 00:43:12,094
instead of saving one for his target?

394
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:47,162
Creeping up on a bereaved man
at a murder scene is not very bright.

395
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,369
Mr. Craven, we have things to talk about.

396
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:52,934
Like your name
and what you're doing here?

397
00:43:53,111 --> 00:43:55,375
Like who shot your daughter.

398
00:43:58,049 --> 00:43:59,641
You know who shot my daughter?

399
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:02,719
If I was looking for a man
who might have shot your daughter...

400
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:06,448
and I had a limited imagination,
of which I do not...

401
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:10,252
I might have looked at the
poor bastard you found today.

402
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:12,589
The known killer.

403
00:44:13,098 --> 00:44:15,896
The unusually well-known killer.

404
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:18,626
Makes you think.

405
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:23,438
- What are you burning?
- None of your business.

406
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:35,143
Yeah, go ahead.

407
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:42,117
- Cigar?
- I'm not celebrating just now.

408
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:45,353
I know you don't smoke.
I saw your DARPA file.

409
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,862
That's my way of telling you
you got a DARPA file.

410
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:51,730
You gonna tell me what that is?

411
00:44:51,903 --> 00:44:55,270
Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency.

412
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,498
Their slogan is:

413
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:58,932
"Scienta est Potentia".

414
00:44:59,444 --> 00:45:01,639
And I know you know Latin.

415
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,109
Sta sursum.

416
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:06,182
You know what that means, yeah?

417
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:09,013
- Stand the fuck up.
- Please do so.

418
00:45:32,677 --> 00:45:35,373
Well, it seems you're no one
in particular.

419
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:36,639
Just some English guy...

420
00:45:36,815 --> 00:45:40,410
standing on my lawn with a
District of Columbia driver's license.

421
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,746
Thank you.

422
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:48,218
- Is Northmoor part of DARPA?
- Well, that's hard to tell.

423
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:52,058
- Why are you here?
- Your daughter was flagged...

424
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,859
as a possible terrorist threat
to the United States of America.

425
00:45:57,435 --> 00:46:00,666
I said "flagged," I didn't say she was.

426
00:46:04,976 --> 00:46:08,002
Funny, the Boston Police Department
didn't come up with that one.

427
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:09,373
Funny if they had.

428
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,572
What the fuck are you burning out there?

429
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:14,175
Fucking Christ.

430
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:16,377
My English friend, Mr. Davenport here...

431
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:19,216
about 6 feet tall, 220 pounds...

432
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,483
is enjoying his cigar.

433
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,723
Is he putting it out?
I can't sleep because of the smell.

434
00:46:25,897 --> 00:46:28,627
You said my daughter was a terrorist.

435
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,928
I didn't. But someone did.

436
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,102
Who are you, Mr. Jedburgh?

437
00:46:36,274 --> 00:46:37,764
I'm a friend of the court.

438
00:46:37,942 --> 00:46:40,706
And I'm a bit fucking cold out here.

439
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:46,177
Pills, pills, pills.

440
00:46:46,384 --> 00:46:48,284
Not like when we were kids...

441
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:51,820
when it was pills, pills, pills
in a very different context.

442
00:46:56,194 --> 00:46:58,856
You're not much of a partier,
are you, Craven?

443
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,225
I mean, what do you do for fun?

444
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:03,558
What do you mean, recently?

445
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:08,562
What's your interest
in my daughter's death?

446
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,107
Well, I don't like the look of it.
I mean, what do you think?

447
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:29,624
Do you recognize them?

448
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:32,153
Should I?

449
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:36,931
They broke into a U.S. classified
nuclear research facility.

450
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:40,935
Then they drowned in the Connecticut
River when they were making their escape.

451
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:44,233
Now, I know that sounds bollocks,
but it's not.

452
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:46,934
Northmoor isn't federal. I checked.

453
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:50,103
So if you're saying my daughter
was involved with these people...

454
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:52,772
the most you could get her for
is trespassing.

455
00:47:52,951 --> 00:47:57,217
Her apartment was tossed.
Her computer was stolen.

456
00:47:57,488 --> 00:48:00,184
And do the police know
that you know that?

457
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,054
No.

458
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:09,695
You're a smart fucker.

459
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:12,897
What does Northmoor do?

460
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:14,898
What have they done?

461
00:48:15,073 --> 00:48:18,236
The people who drowned
belonged to Nightflower.

462
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:21,708
You know, tree-huggers, militants,
New Age fuckups...

463
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:23,710
Sometimes they blow shit up.

464
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:26,850
Infrequently, and not very well.

465
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:28,178
You can look them up.

466
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:31,413
The organization itself,
but not the dead guys.

467
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:33,557
They're classified.

468
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,486
She wasn't an activist.

469
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:39,562
Not the type.
My daughter was not a joiner.

470
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:42,097
She was more like me.

471
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,697
If she did anything, whatever she did,
she would have done it alone.

472
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:50,168
There's a point when anybody
can become an activist.

473
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:55,209
I mean, you see something happen
that's so wrong you have to act...

474
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,371
even if it means the end of you.

475
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:02,348
Now, let's just say she was involved.

476
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,580
Her companions died,
and she came home.

477
00:49:05,757 --> 00:49:06,951
She didn't say anything.

478
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:12,221
She meant to, she wanted to,
but she didn't make it.

479
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:21,535
I'm gonna advise my department
of one...

480
00:49:21,706 --> 00:49:23,606
which is me...

481
00:49:23,775 --> 00:49:26,300
to allow you to continue
your investigation.

482
00:49:26,477 --> 00:49:30,379
Even though you sometimes
burn the evidence in your own back garden.

483
00:49:30,715 --> 00:49:33,707
And you, an officer of the court.

484
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:36,911
I'm not gonna arrest anyone.

485
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,655
I never do.

486
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:43,557
You gonna try and stop me?

487
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:47,528
It depends.

488
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:58,472
I'll see you around.

489
00:50:00,711 --> 00:50:04,909
You know,
sometimes I feel like Diogenes.

490
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:07,347
You know, the guy who walked around
with a lamp...

491
00:50:07,518 --> 00:50:09,986
looking for an honest man.

492
00:50:10,955 --> 00:50:14,413
- How'd it turn out?
- What, for him?

493
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:16,625
I don't remember.

494
00:50:17,028 --> 00:50:19,394
But you and I did pretty good.

495
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:51,193
I thought you were gonna wait
until I was a nice guy.

496
00:50:53,731 --> 00:50:57,030
As a career move, I seriously need
to be seen telling you to fuck off.

497
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:00,329
You have no idea. You don't understand.
Go home. Go home. Go ho-

498
00:51:04,242 --> 00:51:06,608
There's nothing you can do to me.

499
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:10,178
There are times when you don't have
a choice what kind of guy you are.

500
00:51:10,348 --> 00:51:13,408
And you understand that
because you're doing it right fucking now.

501
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:16,411
May I?

502
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:24,589
You drinking the good stuff
because your job's going so well?

503
00:51:24,762 --> 00:51:25,990
Is this an intervention?

504
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,093
If it is, I'd like to call people...

505
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:31,292
who don't whack me around
because I'm afraid for my life.

506
00:51:39,443 --> 00:51:41,911
I assumed you'd be
some kind of scientist.

507
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:44,613
Didn't think your daughter'd
go for a grease monkey?

508
00:51:47,084 --> 00:51:50,952
Something like that, yeah.
If you wanna beat yourself up.

509
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:54,486
Well, what if I said
she said I reminded her of you?

510
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:56,524
Except drinky.

511
00:51:57,161 --> 00:51:59,288
Something to do
with the absence of bullshit...

512
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:01,522
and no patience
for Broadway musicals.

513
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:05,368
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

514
00:52:05,536 --> 00:52:08,664
Somebody shot my girlfriend.
Have you factored that in?

515
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:10,897
What do you know about Nightflower?

516
00:52:12,476 --> 00:52:14,535
You see any granola or C-4
in my cabinets?

517
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,809
- Politics don't interest me.
- What did interest you?

518
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,585
Emma.

519
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,215
Look, I'm under contract.
I have a 5-year contract.

520
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,051
I'm surveilled.

521
00:52:35,225 --> 00:52:39,127
I'm gonna lose my fucking job
if I talk to you, no matter who's dead.

522
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:42,832
How did my daughter
get people through the security...

523
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:45,900
at a classified nuclear R & D
facility?

524
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:48,268
There's a rumor she had help.

525
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,071
You.

526
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,332
No. I passed a polygraph at work.

527
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,709
What happened?

528
00:52:58,982 --> 00:53:02,850
Come on, level with me here. I'm not a cop
now, it's just you and me. What happened?

529
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,322
You got somewhere else we can talk?

530
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,925
You didn't pass the polygraph, you know.
They just told you you did.

531
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:20,431
Emma was writing to Senator Pine.

532
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:24,267
At some point she went to
this greaseball local, a lawyer...

533
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:27,740
- to see about getting out of her security-
- The name of the lawyer?

534
00:53:28,578 --> 00:53:31,843
- Sampson or Sanderman.
- Sanderman.

535
00:53:32,015 --> 00:53:34,347
Anyway, so nobody could help her.

536
00:53:34,518 --> 00:53:39,114
And whistle-blowers always sound like
psychos, and Pine didn't get back to her.

537
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:41,951
And so all of a sudden
it was these Nightflower assholes.

538
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,151
She got them in
through the cooling tunnels.

539
00:53:45,962 --> 00:53:50,194
I mean, she didn't go in herself.
But she was there.

540
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:54,468
How was Emma exposed to radiation?

541
00:53:55,605 --> 00:53:57,300
She wasn't.

542
00:53:57,507 --> 00:54:00,442
That's what I'm saying,
she didn't go in the tunnels, I mean...

543
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:04,876
They were exposed, but she couldn't have
been exposed, she wasn't in the tunnels.

544
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:09,385
- What happened to the people that went in?
- There's a protocol.

545
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:12,653
It's Bennett, he's insane.

546
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:16,954
In case of a breach,
they release irradiated steam.

547
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:19,822
Now, I can't prove this,
and you can't prove it.

548
00:54:19,996 --> 00:54:22,988
I mean, these are clever,
clever fuckers, right?

549
00:54:24,868 --> 00:54:27,393
You're a cop. You gotta help me.

550
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:30,563
Sure. Yeah, I will help you.
Come with me, tell me the truth.

551
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:35,234
- We'll get you deposed by a lawyer-
- No, no. No, I'm sorry, no.

552
00:54:35,412 --> 00:54:37,846
I like you, you're Emma's dad.

553
00:54:38,615 --> 00:54:40,412
But you have to go.

554
00:54:44,054 --> 00:54:47,114
All right. You can always
change your mind.

555
00:54:48,658 --> 00:54:51,126
In the meantime, here, this is yours.

556
00:54:52,762 --> 00:54:54,491
It's loaded.

557
00:54:57,868 --> 00:54:59,699
That's illegal in Massachusetts.

558
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:03,396
Everything's illegal in Massachusetts.

559
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:34,235
What does it feel like?

560
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:03,530
- Good evening, senator.
- Great to be here.

561
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:05,606
2 days ago, you gave a speech...

562
01:00:05,775 --> 01:00:09,575
in which you criticized your colleague,
Senator Stafford, for his position-

563
01:00:09,746 --> 01:00:11,611
Well, we all have positions, Gordon.

564
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:14,773
I think the American people are asking,
with good reason...

565
01:00:15,552 --> 01:00:18,612
whether the price they have paid
for their security is too high.

566
01:00:18,788 --> 01:00:21,222
With respect,
that's an answer one would expect.

567
01:00:21,391 --> 01:00:22,858
But how does it jibe, senator...

568
01:00:23,026 --> 01:00:26,928
with your support of secret
research facilities in Massachusetts?

569
01:00:27,397 --> 01:00:29,729
I am curious about
what you just asked me.

570
01:00:29,899 --> 01:00:32,197
Now, if you're asking about...

571
01:00:32,368 --> 01:00:34,962
this administration's failed policy
with regards to-

572
01:00:35,138 --> 01:00:37,470
Senator, what can you tell me
about Northmoor?

573
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,733
I'm not familiar
with the business practices-

574
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:42,639
The parent company's one of your
biggest corporate donors.

575
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:44,939
Well, all I can say about
my donors is that...

576
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:47,446
they're completely vetted
and aboveboard.

577
01:00:47,617 --> 01:00:51,075
Senator, there is a serious and
growing petition movement...

578
01:00:51,254 --> 01:00:54,052
to ban military research and
development in Massachusetts.

579
01:00:54,224 --> 01:00:56,556
I understand that. I understand that.

580
01:00:56,726 --> 01:01:01,356
But people have to realize
the importance of R & D of every kind...

581
01:01:01,531 --> 01:01:03,055
to the Massachusetts economy.

582
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:06,225
Now to hark back to your question
about Senator Stafford.

583
01:01:06,402 --> 01:01:10,304
I fully agree with his desire
to expand oversight of R & D...

584
01:01:10,473 --> 01:01:15,069
but let's not throw out the baby
with the bathwater.

585
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:42,929
I never had kids.

586
01:01:43,606 --> 01:01:48,100
Maybe it's better not to have had one
than to see one die.

587
01:01:48,678 --> 01:01:50,111
No.

588
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:55,283
It was worth everything to have her.

589
01:01:58,288 --> 01:02:00,279
Public drinking is illegal
in Massachusetts.

590
01:02:00,456 --> 01:02:03,425
Everything's illegal in Massachusetts.

591
01:02:03,593 --> 01:02:06,255
Payback for the Tea Party.

592
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,891
You ever had wine before?

593
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:11,329
No, not with any pleasure.

594
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:14,695
Besides, with you, I think I'd have to
switch glasses when you weren't looking.

595
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:22,870
My daughter was irradiated.

596
01:02:23,046 --> 01:02:27,005
I don't know how exactly, but I think it
was our friends at Northmoor.

597
01:02:27,183 --> 01:02:29,344
Later, she was gunned down
at my home.

598
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,352
And I want to know
what you think about that.

599
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:35,881
I had a source says
Nightflower people...

600
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:39,324
were intentionally exposed
to radiation while in the tunnels.

601
01:02:39,495 --> 01:02:41,690
But that source is dead now.

602
01:02:42,165 --> 01:02:43,359
He wasn't a bad guy.

603
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:46,163
No.

604
01:02:46,336 --> 01:02:50,705
Now, you know better than anyone,
cases like these are never solved.

605
01:02:50,873 --> 01:02:53,706
They're simply too complicated,
too much hard work.

606
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:57,443
There's a lot going on out there
in this world.

607
01:02:57,947 --> 01:03:00,609
And you just never can connect A to B.

608
01:03:01,884 --> 01:03:03,181
How do you know that?

609
01:03:03,353 --> 01:03:06,345
Because I'm usually the guy
that stops you connecting A to B.

610
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:07,716
It's part of what I do.

611
01:03:16,165 --> 01:03:18,099
If I was an employee at Northmoor...

612
01:03:19,135 --> 01:03:21,865
and I wanted to blow the whistle
on something...

613
01:03:22,038 --> 01:03:24,097
what would I be blowing the whistle
on?

614
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:26,537
Well, let's take a walk
and we can talk about it.

615
01:03:27,777 --> 01:03:30,211
I'm not walking into the dark with you.

616
01:03:30,813 --> 01:03:32,815
You're a wise man.

617
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:36,077
Are you on my side?

618
01:03:36,652 --> 01:03:38,779
Well, that's hard to tell.

619
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:40,979
You know that Fitzgerald thing...

620
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:45,526
about an artist who's a man
who has 2 opposing ideas in his head...

621
01:03:45,695 --> 01:03:48,892
and, you know, he believes in them
both simultaneously?

622
01:03:49,065 --> 01:03:50,293
I heard of it, yeah.

623
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,360
Well, that's sort of the beginning of it.

624
01:03:56,372 --> 01:04:00,399
So, what's that like,
not being anyone in particular?

625
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,940
I don't know what it means
to have lost a child...

626
01:04:07,617 --> 01:04:10,814
but I know what it means
never to have had one.

627
01:04:15,725 --> 01:04:17,158
Yeah.

628
01:04:17,493 --> 01:04:19,484
You got nobody left to bury you.

629
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,554
Yeah.

630
01:04:34,277 --> 01:04:35,437
By the way...

631
01:04:36,112 --> 01:04:37,977
Thanks for not killing me.

632
01:04:53,096 --> 01:04:56,532
Detective Craven, how do you feel
about a suspect being identified?

633
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:02,194
You're here later than everybody else.

634
01:05:02,472 --> 01:05:04,201
Is that because you got a lousy boss?

635
01:05:08,077 --> 01:05:11,877
I'm so sorry for you.
I'm sorry I have to be here.

636
01:05:12,815 --> 01:05:16,751
It's all right, take it easy.
You got a business card or something?

637
01:05:18,287 --> 01:05:19,845
Thanks.

638
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:27,593
Look, go on home, honey. It's too late
to be out here. I'll call you...

639
01:05:46,082 --> 01:05:47,811
I knew this would be the outcome.

640
01:05:47,984 --> 01:05:50,851
Mr. Sanderman?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

641
01:05:51,487 --> 01:05:52,647
- I interrupt?
- No.

642
01:05:52,822 --> 01:05:55,757
I'm Craven. Detective Thomas Craven,
Boston Police Department.

643
01:05:55,925 --> 01:05:59,793
I know who you are.
I'm sorry for your troubles.

644
01:05:59,962 --> 01:06:04,023
Thank you. I understand
my daughter was a client of yours.

645
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,293
Yes. I mean, no.

646
01:06:06,469 --> 01:06:10,064
We had a consultation.
She never formally became my client.

647
01:06:11,874 --> 01:06:15,970
It says in her phone calendar that you and
she had dinner on the 18th of last month.

648
01:06:16,746 --> 01:06:18,941
Yeah, I asked her on a date, yes.

649
01:06:19,115 --> 01:06:20,742
Well, how'd it go?

650
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,210
Fine. Fine.

651
01:06:23,386 --> 01:06:28,346
She was a nice girl. Smart as a-

652
01:06:29,725 --> 01:06:32,660
- Sorry, I have to go.
- I'll come with you.

653
01:06:33,796 --> 01:06:35,320
Can I ask you what this is about?

654
01:06:35,498 --> 01:06:38,695
She came to your office. She wanted
to blow the whistle on something.

655
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:41,996
You know what that's from, when
cops used to blow their whistles?

656
01:06:42,171 --> 01:06:44,765
- I can't talk about that.
- I don't want you to.

657
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:48,206
But then later on that night,
you invited her out to dinner.

658
01:06:48,411 --> 01:06:50,311
Gee, you're really nervous,
Mr. Sanderman.

659
01:06:50,479 --> 01:06:54,381
And you're about 2 seconds away from
telling me how inappropriate all this is.

660
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:58,008
Let me say, I know you couldn't
represent her in a non-disclosure contract.

661
01:06:58,187 --> 01:07:00,553
But you probably suggested
further discussion...

662
01:07:00,723 --> 01:07:03,191
over a nice plate of spaghetti
and meatballs?

663
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,021
You had 2 agendas.
1, you wanted to have sex with her.

664
01:07:06,195 --> 01:07:08,095
Hey, I'm not passing judgment here,
okay?

665
01:07:08,264 --> 01:07:10,129
And 2, and really, Mr. Sanderman...

666
01:07:10,299 --> 01:07:13,427
you wanted to know about
what security breach she represented.

667
01:07:13,603 --> 01:07:16,538
I have to get to a deposition
in Springfield.

668
01:07:32,421 --> 01:07:34,355
You represent Northmoor
in local matters.

669
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:37,356
My daughter came to you,
but you're Northmoor's attorney.

670
01:07:37,526 --> 01:07:40,427
Let me add that you organized
western Mass. for Senator Pine...

671
01:07:40,596 --> 01:07:44,532
who's put your name before 2 different
governors for district court judge.

672
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,635
- You were about to say something?
- I don't have anything to say.

673
01:07:47,803 --> 01:07:50,271
You are out of your depth,
far from your jurisdiction.

674
01:07:50,439 --> 01:07:52,600
I'm going to the Globe, the Herald,
tell them...

675
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:54,766
my daughter came to talk
about Northmoor.

676
01:07:54,944 --> 01:07:57,572
You were Northmoor's attorney,
yet failed to disclose it.

677
01:07:57,747 --> 01:08:01,478
You'll be in the middle of a story saying
how my daughter was the target, not me.

678
01:08:01,651 --> 01:08:04,313
- Is that where you want to be?
- On what evidence?

679
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:06,387
I'll forge a fucking diary, I don't care.

680
01:08:06,555 --> 01:08:08,682
Getting you in trouble's good enough.
Listen...

681
01:08:08,858 --> 01:08:10,450
this is not about police, okay?

682
01:08:10,626 --> 01:08:13,151
This isn't about police, arresting,
all that nice shit.

683
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:16,423
This is about me knowing what I have to
and that you gotta tell me.

684
01:08:16,599 --> 01:08:18,533
Now, I wanna see the senator.

685
01:08:18,701 --> 01:08:21,397
See the senator? Who the fuck
do you think you are?

686
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:24,198
I'm the guy with nothing to lose
and doesn't give a shit.

687
01:08:24,373 --> 01:08:27,604
You tell him that.
And fasten your fucking seat belt.

688
01:08:34,483 --> 01:08:36,781
Look, Daddy. Lots of A-B-C's.

689
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:47,960
Hi.

690
01:08:49,432 --> 01:08:51,525
I wanna go to her apartment.

691
01:08:52,034 --> 01:08:53,092
I wanna see her things.

692
01:08:55,037 --> 01:08:57,028
That's not a good idea right now.

693
01:08:59,141 --> 01:09:00,768
I'm sorry.

694
01:09:01,711 --> 01:09:03,178
I am so scared.

695
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:06,144
Look, I would take you for a cup of coffee,
something to eat.

696
01:09:06,315 --> 01:09:09,546
But we have to just talk now.
I'd like to ask you things about her...

697
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:13,314
personal things maybe I never knew,
but there's no time for that-

698
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:18,453
Look, I can't take this, okay?

699
01:09:19,328 --> 01:09:22,729
Talk to me... Talk to me.

700
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:31,169
I introduced her to them.

701
01:09:31,674 --> 01:09:33,232
Introduced her to who, honey?

702
01:09:34,343 --> 01:09:36,174
Nightflower.

703
01:09:36,912 --> 01:09:38,106
Fuck, you know?

704
01:09:38,581 --> 01:09:43,514
- Corporations this, corporations that.
- Just keep it straight.

705
01:09:45,788 --> 01:09:49,019
They had a little shack on the river.
Nightflower.

706
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:53,494
- I am so afraid.
- Who are you afraid of?

707
01:09:55,898 --> 01:09:58,833
They came to my house.
These guys in black suits.

708
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:01,128
They were asking about Emma.
I lied my ass off.

709
01:10:02,671 --> 01:10:05,538
What were they doing at Northmoor
that Emma wanted to expose?

710
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:09,177
Bennett's the motherfucker.
All right? It's Bennett.

711
01:10:09,345 --> 01:10:11,677
That's all she wanted to say,
he was insane.

712
01:10:11,847 --> 01:10:13,940
She realized he was completely fucking
insane.

713
01:10:14,116 --> 01:10:16,243
Okay, whether he was this, that
or whatever...

714
01:10:16,419 --> 01:10:19,513
What were they doing at Northmoor?
Why did Emma go to Nightflower?

715
01:10:19,688 --> 01:10:22,156
She couldn't go to the papers
because of her contract.

716
01:10:22,324 --> 01:10:25,452
And the senator wouldn't help.
And you are not hearing this from me.

717
01:10:25,628 --> 01:10:29,530
All right? You are not.
I run a luggage store.

718
01:10:29,698 --> 01:10:33,691
- I got a 3-year-old.
- I'm not hearing this from you.

719
01:10:34,236 --> 01:10:37,069
What were they doing at Northmoor
that Emma wanted to expose?

720
01:10:45,181 --> 01:10:47,149
She had this for you.

721
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:48,917
In case.

722
01:10:50,619 --> 01:10:52,416
I never wanted-

723
01:10:53,322 --> 01:10:55,119
I'm just a person.

724
01:10:55,291 --> 01:10:56,952
You know? I'm just a fucking person.

725
01:10:57,126 --> 01:10:59,060
Okay, honey, I know.

726
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:01,492
Go back to your baby, okay?

727
01:11:01,864 --> 01:11:03,627
I never saw you.

728
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,532
All right? Go on.

729
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:16,577
I gotta tell you something else first.

730
01:11:17,146 --> 01:11:18,511
What?

731
01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:24,351
She thought they poisoned her.

732
01:11:35,898 --> 01:11:37,422
You know...

733
01:11:39,468 --> 01:11:41,595
I always liked this town.

734
01:11:43,472 --> 01:11:45,599
When she moved out here...

735
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:49,477
she said it reminded her
of Paris in the '20s, you know...

736
01:11:49,645 --> 01:11:52,808
because we got a very traditional home
in Boston and-

737
01:11:53,315 --> 01:11:56,682
Maybe it wasn't what she wanted
out of life, you know?

738
01:12:01,323 --> 01:12:03,848
What was the name of her contact
at Nightflower?

739
01:12:04,026 --> 01:12:05,323
Tell me that and we're done.

740
01:12:06,896 --> 01:12:08,659
No, I'm done now.

741
01:12:08,831 --> 01:12:11,561
In her phone records,
there was a guy called Robinson.

742
01:12:11,734 --> 01:12:13,497
Is that the guy?

743
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:18,301
Yeah. Now I'm done.

744
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:23,428
We've stabilized her.

745
01:13:23,606 --> 01:13:27,406
She's in a coma,
although we weren't able to save her leg.

746
01:13:30,613 --> 01:13:34,640
- She has a child. Is anybody coming to-?
- Her parents just arrived.

747
01:13:35,551 --> 01:13:38,543
- Thanks.
- Thanks, doc.

748
01:13:45,327 --> 01:13:48,660
Go ahead. I'll keep you posted.

749
01:13:50,499 --> 01:13:51,830
Thanks.

750
01:14:29,505 --> 01:14:30,938
Okay.

751
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:37,401
My name is Emma Charlotte Craven.

752
01:14:38,147 --> 01:14:41,981
I work at Northmoor Massachusetts
as a research assistant.

753
01:14:42,151 --> 01:14:45,587
I know that I am violating
the security conditions of my workplace...

754
01:14:45,754 --> 01:14:48,450
and I know I am committing a crime.

755
01:14:48,624 --> 01:14:53,926
But I'm doing this because I've exhausted
every legal avenue that is available to me...

756
01:14:54,096 --> 01:14:57,623
and no one would listen.
So now I have to do what's right.

757
01:14:58,434 --> 01:15:00,459
Northmoor is breaking the law.

758
01:15:00,636 --> 01:15:02,365
They are making nuclear weapons.

759
01:15:02,538 --> 01:15:04,506
But these are not American nuclear
weapons.

760
01:15:04,673 --> 01:15:07,608
They are weapons
designed to foreign specifications...

761
01:15:07,776 --> 01:15:09,641
and built with foreign materials.

762
01:15:09,812 --> 01:15:13,009
So, obviously, if these bombs
were ever to be used...

763
01:15:13,182 --> 01:15:17,141
they would be traced directly back to
another country and not the United States.

764
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:22,154
I've stolen documents, images,
blueprints...

765
01:15:22,491 --> 01:15:25,016
but we need proof of the weapons
themselves.

766
01:15:25,194 --> 01:15:27,856
So I'm showing a team of people...

767
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:32,399
how to get into the Northmoor facility
to video the evidence.

768
01:15:33,469 --> 01:15:36,461
I'm recording all this
because I'm very scared.

769
01:15:37,206 --> 01:15:39,003
I'm under constant surveillance.

770
01:15:39,174 --> 01:15:42,701
My phone is tapped,
and I'm being followed.

771
01:15:42,878 --> 01:15:48,248
So chances are that if you're watching this,
I'll already be dead.

772
01:15:49,351 --> 01:15:50,579
I-

773
01:15:50,753 --> 01:15:52,687
I love you, Dad.

774
01:16:02,064 --> 01:16:03,622
Fuck.

775
01:17:09,431 --> 01:17:12,889
The next time a contractor asks to run
his own security, what should I say?

776
01:17:13,068 --> 01:17:15,730
I suppose that would be up to you.

777
01:17:16,004 --> 01:17:18,438
This is called a containment situation.
I wonder why.

778
01:17:18,607 --> 01:17:20,973
The problem is
that there are things uncontained...

779
01:17:21,143 --> 01:17:23,407
and some of them will never go back
in the box.

780
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:25,410
You're scared about Craven,
wisely so...

781
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:27,549
but here's the damage control
analysis:

782
01:17:27,716 --> 01:17:30,583
Apart from Craven, 3 sets of parents
have lost their kids.

783
01:17:30,752 --> 01:17:33,949
And now you have an employee
who tries to run over a single mother...

784
01:17:34,122 --> 01:17:37,387
only to be shot in the head by
the same cop you previously bereaved.

785
01:17:37,559 --> 01:17:41,086
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know the thing about the dead?

786
01:17:41,263 --> 01:17:45,723
They have got lovers, friends, relatives,
a billion loose ends, estimated.

787
01:17:45,901 --> 01:17:47,960
Let's start at the beginning
of this debacle.

788
01:17:48,136 --> 01:17:51,264
Nightflower is a pack of paranoid,
anti-corporate, hubristic freaks.

789
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,965
They think you're the devil
if you give them ice cream.

790
01:17:54,142 --> 01:17:59,079
Do you think 3 of their people reading
as drowned is gonna read as an accident?

791
01:17:59,248 --> 01:18:03,150
It was an accident. And the man involved
in the other incident was a Bosnian...

792
01:18:03,318 --> 01:18:08,415
who, as far as paperwork is concerned, is
alive and well in London at this moment.

793
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:12,424
I can do my job.
It seems I can also do yours.

794
01:18:12,594 --> 01:18:14,687
What you're doing is not my job.

795
01:18:15,264 --> 01:18:18,392
- Isn't it?
- Even if the drownings were accidental...

796
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:22,003
the bodies were recovered by
a radiation team and disposed of secretly.

797
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:23,330
By your people, not mine.

798
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:25,530
You said they were
contaminated terrorists.

799
01:18:25,707 --> 01:18:28,198
Not American citizens,
and you had contaminated them.

800
01:18:28,377 --> 01:18:31,608
One of them is the only child
of a mom with multiple sclerosis.

801
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:35,546
When she's on TV saying, "Last thing
I knew they were breaking into Northmoor."

802
01:18:35,717 --> 01:18:39,983
Do you know what I'm saying to you?
Do you understand what you have done?

803
01:18:40,155 --> 01:18:44,057
What's worse: me doing it, if anything
has been done or you covering it up?

804
01:18:44,226 --> 01:18:46,717
I'm just a private individual, a citizen,
a man.

805
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:50,490
You, on the other hand,
are the United States government.

806
01:18:51,266 --> 01:18:56,169
What I am is the guy whose only fuck-up is
letting you have your own security fiefdom.

807
01:18:57,806 --> 01:18:59,933
Whatever they say,
there was never a break-in.

808
01:19:00,108 --> 01:19:03,407
Northmoor's never had a security breach,
never had an accident...

809
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:07,105
and Northmoor
does not make weapons.

810
01:19:07,282 --> 01:19:11,048
Least of all, things supposed in certain
contingencies best known to you...

811
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:14,916
to look like Jihadist dirty bombs.

812
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:18,718
I wouldn't worry about it more.

813
01:19:18,894 --> 01:19:24,332
"Fuck you, it's classified"
still works as I'm far as I'm concerned.

814
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:33,439
Are you even here, Mr. Bennett?
Are we even talking?

815
01:19:33,608 --> 01:19:36,839
I'm at my house in Virginia.
I've got food poisoning. Where are you?

816
01:19:37,712 --> 01:19:39,212
I'm not here.

817
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:43,279
Is Robinson keeping
his part of the bargain?

818
01:19:52,394 --> 01:19:54,589
- Mr. Robinson?
- Yes.

819
01:19:54,763 --> 01:19:57,357
- Mr. Allan C. Robinson, Jr.?
- Yes.

820
01:19:57,532 --> 01:20:00,262
Could you remove your glasses,
please, sir?

821
01:20:10,712 --> 01:20:12,145
My daughter was Emma Craven.

822
01:20:12,314 --> 01:20:16,114
She wasn't killed in your amphibious little
operation against the corporate satan.

823
01:20:16,284 --> 01:20:17,717
No, she was killed later.

824
01:20:17,886 --> 01:20:20,081
On my front porch. Come here.

825
01:20:22,024 --> 01:20:24,788
I wanna know why you,
with your concerns about the planet...

826
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,624
and human race, stayed silent about
the deaths of your people. Why's that?

827
01:20:30,132 --> 01:20:31,497
People with families.

828
01:20:31,967 --> 01:20:32,991
All of them had kids.

829
01:20:33,735 --> 01:20:35,464
And one of them was my daughter.

830
01:20:36,471 --> 01:20:38,996
Nah, I'm not gonna hit you again.

831
01:20:39,174 --> 01:20:40,732
She wouldn't want me to.

832
01:20:40,909 --> 01:20:43,969
Then again, she's not here
because of you, you son of a bitch.

833
01:20:50,185 --> 01:20:53,552
Now, we got a serious situation here,
Mr. Robinson.

834
01:20:54,523 --> 01:20:57,617
They know who you are,
and you're not dead. Not dead, shot, hurt...

835
01:20:57,793 --> 01:20:59,317
poisoned, nothing.

836
01:20:59,494 --> 01:21:01,553
Now, I figure that's because
you cut a deal.

837
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:04,164
But you're gonna cut another deal
with me.

838
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,267
You're gonna tell me everything.

839
01:21:06,435 --> 01:21:08,426
Come on, you son of a bitch.

840
01:21:40,068 --> 01:21:41,797
I need to know about the properties...

841
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,995
of the substance
you gave Emma Craven.

842
01:21:44,172 --> 01:21:46,402
I'd rather not discuss it in those terms.

843
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:50,011
Is it something she could've
encountered in her work?

844
01:21:50,178 --> 01:21:52,078
Any exposure,
if there were an exposure...

845
01:21:52,247 --> 01:21:56,809
would be consistent with a documentable
procedural failure on her part.

846
01:21:56,985 --> 01:22:00,045
Is it something that could've remained
in her effects...

847
01:22:00,222 --> 01:22:03,885
and been transferred to her father
without much collateral contamination?

848
01:22:04,059 --> 01:22:07,586
Do you mean, could it
have poisoned her father as well?

849
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:10,454
Yes.

850
01:22:12,033 --> 01:22:16,265
What, in your opinion, would be the
consequences if Craven opens his mouth?

851
01:22:19,941 --> 01:22:22,739
It's unsurvivable.

852
01:22:26,414 --> 01:22:28,245
So be it, then.

853
01:22:34,389 --> 01:22:36,448
Do you see a soul in there?

854
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:38,616
I beg your pardon?

855
01:22:39,027 --> 01:22:40,619
You can button your shirt.

856
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:44,856
Now, as we discussed yesterday,
there will be some erratic behavior.

857
01:22:45,033 --> 01:22:48,969
I regret to say that this probably means
that you'll have less time-

858
01:22:49,137 --> 01:22:51,162
I know what it means.

859
01:22:54,142 --> 01:22:56,872
I've been having aural hallucinations.

860
01:22:57,045 --> 01:23:00,037
My father's voice calling my name
as I start to sleep.

861
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:05,552
Bastard's been dead for 40 years,
and suddenly he's yelling at me again.

862
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,278
I come awake.

863
01:23:07,455 --> 01:23:08,479
You're not sleeping?

864
01:23:08,657 --> 01:23:12,218
No, I'm not sleeping.
I start to sleep and then I jolt awake.

865
01:23:13,695 --> 01:23:17,563
There's something about the darkness.

866
01:23:17,766 --> 01:23:19,358
I don't like it.

867
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:20,899
I'm not a counselor.

868
01:23:21,069 --> 01:23:23,401
I know you wanna banter with me.
I don't do that.

869
01:23:23,572 --> 01:23:25,164
I can only give you the facts.

870
01:23:25,874 --> 01:23:28,502
Well, we all know what the facts are.

871
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,771
We live a while...

872
01:23:30,946 --> 01:23:33,414
and then we die
sooner than we planned.

873
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:45,284
- Standard procedure with the senator.
- Yeah, I get it.

874
01:23:46,194 --> 01:23:49,186
You know, you didn't really let the side
stand with you.

875
01:23:49,364 --> 01:23:54,301
- You got a lot of brothers out there.
- Yeah, I know. I like a private funeral.

876
01:23:54,469 --> 01:23:56,835
The senator gets in his moods.
Not too good today.

877
01:23:57,005 --> 01:23:59,599
That's too bad,
I was jumping for joy.

878
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:09,314
Are you hungry? We have some
sandwiches, a cup of tea.

879
01:24:10,318 --> 01:24:12,013
No, thank you, sir.

880
01:24:12,187 --> 01:24:15,816
Well, it's always a pleasure
to meet a combat veteran.

881
01:24:15,991 --> 01:24:19,358
You left as a master sergeant
of a heavy weapons platoon.

882
01:24:20,128 --> 01:24:23,825
- Yes, sir.
- How'd you do that at 20?

883
01:24:23,999 --> 01:24:25,990
Everybody else was dead.

884
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,834
Did you have trouble adjusting
when you came home?

885
01:24:31,273 --> 01:24:32,968
- No.
- Really?

886
01:24:33,141 --> 01:24:36,372
No. People talk about trauma
and so forth.

887
01:24:36,544 --> 01:24:39,741
I figure you pretty much come out
of combat the same way you went in.

888
01:24:39,914 --> 01:24:43,748
I know that's not a very kind thing to say,
but that's my observation.

889
01:24:43,918 --> 01:24:47,718
And I know there's a lot of big bucks
in this post-traumatic stress thing...

890
01:24:47,889 --> 01:24:50,915
but combat's pretty much
like anything else:

891
01:24:51,226 --> 01:24:54,423
It can help put perspective on things
when you're scared shitless.

892
01:24:54,596 --> 01:24:57,224
What is the nature of our appointment,
Detective Craven?

893
01:24:57,399 --> 01:24:59,424
I was hoping that you could tell me that.

894
01:24:59,601 --> 01:25:02,468
How am I supposed to tell you
what you want to see me about?

895
01:25:02,637 --> 01:25:07,199
Well, because you're seeing me in less than
48 hours after I talked to your attorney.

896
01:25:09,144 --> 01:25:13,638
Your daughter did come to me
with allegations about Northmoor.

897
01:25:13,815 --> 01:25:15,077
She sent me a letter.

898
01:25:15,617 --> 01:25:17,312
What'd the letter contain?

899
01:25:17,485 --> 01:25:21,546
It touched on national security matters
that are classified.

900
01:25:23,224 --> 01:25:27,217
- What happened to the letter?
- That's also classified.

901
01:25:27,395 --> 01:25:31,559
But protocol would be
to turn it over to the committee...

902
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:35,294
that does oversight on the area
your daughter's letter touched upon.

903
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,438
Prompting an investigation
on my daughter.

904
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:40,631
Opening up a DARPA file on her,
treating her like a terrorist?

905
01:25:40,809 --> 01:25:43,471
I'm not involved in security matters.

906
01:25:43,645 --> 01:25:48,605
I did write to your daughter advising her
that she might be in breach of security.

907
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:51,745
So you didn't help her?

908
01:25:53,188 --> 01:25:54,951
I'm very glad to see you, detective...

909
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:58,581
as both a veteran and as a police officer
of your many years of service.

910
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,751
But I have to tell you
that your daughter...

911
01:26:00,929 --> 01:26:04,023
and we have to say this
despite her terrible accident...

912
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:09,632
was in violation of almost everything
of which she could be in violation.

913
01:26:09,804 --> 01:26:13,001
- What did she allege?
- That's classified.

914
01:26:13,808 --> 01:26:16,743
Detective, a very important part
of the Massachusetts economy...

915
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:18,378
is research and development.

916
01:26:18,546 --> 01:26:22,983
Senator, I think you're in a position,
senator, regarding Northmoor...

917
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:25,984
where you had better decide
whether you're on the cross...

918
01:26:26,154 --> 01:26:27,587
or banging in the nails.

919
01:26:27,756 --> 01:26:29,155
Here.

920
01:26:31,993 --> 01:26:34,427
These deaths
are the result of a conspiracy...

921
01:26:34,596 --> 01:26:37,463
by one of your major
campaign contributors.

922
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,968
You include your daughter?
Her death was an accident.

923
01:26:41,136 --> 01:26:43,934
No, she was poisoned with thallium
by Mr. Bennett.

924
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:50,477
I think I'm scaring you. There's probably
not too much upside to scaring a senator...

925
01:26:50,645 --> 01:26:52,875
except to provide some perspective.

926
01:26:53,047 --> 01:26:55,072
I'm gonna go,
but I'm gonna leave you these.

927
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,309
And I want you to call
everybody involved.

928
01:26:57,485 --> 01:26:59,350
Tell them I know everything I need...

929
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:02,354
to throw a box of tarantulas
into this situation.

930
01:27:02,524 --> 01:27:04,992
Shut up, I'm not interested
in talking any more shit.

931
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,025
You investigate this
at a national level.

932
01:27:07,195 --> 01:27:11,154
You do that, maybe you'll come out
of this all right. I don't know.

933
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:15,501
I don't think you knew that the people you
are in business with killed my daughter.

934
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:19,367
But now that you do know,
what are you gonna do about it?

935
01:27:20,108 --> 01:27:21,973
Good afternoon, senator.

936
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:43,590
Get out of the vehicle.

937
01:28:45,827 --> 01:28:47,727
What the fuck do you think you just did?

938
01:28:47,896 --> 01:28:51,923
You just rear-ended an unmarked cruiser,
I made an observation that you're armed.

939
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:55,069
- Through smoked glass and our coats?
- Yeah, I'm funny that way.

940
01:28:55,236 --> 01:28:57,670
Get out of the car now
or you're gonna make a move...

941
01:28:57,839 --> 01:29:00,899
for something on the inside
of your jackets, you understand me?

942
01:29:01,943 --> 01:29:03,808
Get out of the car.

943
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,180
All right, on your knees.
Hands on your heads.

944
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:17,615
What do you got?

945
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:21,819
These guys are armed.
They were following me, rear-ended my car.

946
01:29:22,163 --> 01:29:25,621
You got some ID there? Thanks.

947
01:29:28,836 --> 01:29:31,896
They're not law enforcement.
Imagine that.

948
01:29:32,273 --> 01:29:33,297
What are you?

949
01:29:33,641 --> 01:29:35,768
Don't think this is gonna
get straightened out?

950
01:29:35,944 --> 01:29:39,209
- Not for a while.
- These fuckers got automatic weapons.

951
01:29:40,481 --> 01:29:42,676
You just made a serious mistake.

952
01:29:46,988 --> 01:29:48,717
Did you shoot my daughter?

953
01:29:51,793 --> 01:29:54,353
I'm the supposed target of the killer.

954
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:58,431
So you're gonna follow me, armed, with
no credentials, into the city of Boston?

955
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,727
You're out of your fucking mind.

956
01:30:01,836 --> 01:30:03,235
Welcome to hell.

957
01:30:05,006 --> 01:30:07,236
A strange new twist
in the Emma Craven case.

958
01:30:07,408 --> 01:30:10,070
As you know, a suspect has been
identified in her murder.

959
01:30:10,244 --> 01:30:13,270
But there are new developments today
involving her father.

960
01:30:13,448 --> 01:30:15,678
2 men have been arrested in Boston.

961
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:19,217
Police say the men were taken
into custody after their car crashed...

962
01:30:19,387 --> 01:30:21,355
in the back of an unmarked police
car...

963
01:30:21,522 --> 01:30:23,888
driven by Boston Police Detective
Thomas Craven.

964
01:30:24,058 --> 01:30:25,252
The father of Emma Craven.

965
01:30:25,426 --> 01:30:29,157
This all happened on Arlington Street.
Robert Down of Dover, Maryland...

966
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:31,321
and Thomas Hannaham
of Washington, D.C...

967
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,861
were also found armed
with automatic weapons.

968
01:30:35,036 --> 01:30:37,766
- Bennett.
- We need to abort right now.

969
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:40,305
We can't risk dealing with Craven yet.

970
01:30:40,475 --> 01:30:42,238
It's too late.

971
01:30:42,477 --> 01:30:43,535
It's already been done.

972
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:47,169
- and would not explain why
they had automatic weapons in their car.

973
01:31:06,834 --> 01:31:07,960
What, you wanna try?

974
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:20,440
Hold your hair back. Your mother will kill
me if I get it all messed up. There you go.

975
01:31:21,249 --> 01:31:23,114
Also on your chin.

976
01:31:23,284 --> 01:31:24,410
Little moustache.

977
01:31:26,821 --> 01:31:29,915
Perfect. Now you need your razor.
Here you go.

978
01:31:30,858 --> 01:31:31,916
Don't cut yourself.

979
01:31:32,293 --> 01:31:35,319
- Comb.
- That'll work.

980
01:31:35,997 --> 01:31:37,897
All right, now watch.

981
01:31:56,217 --> 01:31:57,775
Painless.

982
01:31:57,952 --> 01:31:59,579
Wash it off.

983
01:31:59,754 --> 01:32:01,312
And one more.

984
01:32:47,668 --> 01:32:49,499
Can I come in, Tom?

985
01:32:52,473 --> 01:32:54,668
- You all right?
- Yeah.

986
01:33:14,395 --> 01:33:18,058
Remember that trooper out
at the airport, busted Whitey...

987
01:33:18,699 --> 01:33:20,428
and got demoted and transferred?

988
01:33:23,671 --> 01:33:25,502
He knew what was going on.

989
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,669
But he couldn't prove it,
and nobody wanted to know about it.

990
01:33:30,344 --> 01:33:32,505
And finally he shot himself.
You remember that?

991
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,482
I don't think you'd shoot yourself.

992
01:33:40,721 --> 01:33:42,916
But what's coming is worse than that.

993
01:33:44,892 --> 01:33:46,757
It isn't what it is, Tommy.

994
01:33:47,595 --> 01:33:49,620
It is never what it is.

995
01:33:49,797 --> 01:33:53,062
It is what it can be made to look like.

996
01:33:55,603 --> 01:33:57,867
There's a DA in Hampshire County...

997
01:33:58,039 --> 01:34:01,600
gonna charge you with the death
of your daughter's boyfriend.

998
01:34:01,776 --> 01:34:03,403
He don't have a case.

999
01:34:03,878 --> 01:34:05,778
That doesn't matter.

1000
01:34:07,315 --> 01:34:10,751
It'll be 5 years of people thinking
you did it.

1001
01:34:10,918 --> 01:34:13,318
You'll go broke, you'll lose the house.

1002
01:34:13,487 --> 01:34:15,387
Then they'll go after your pension.

1003
01:34:15,556 --> 01:34:18,218
If you win the case,
then there'll be a civil suit...

1004
01:34:18,392 --> 01:34:21,088
and by that point you won't be able
to afford a lawyer.

1005
01:34:21,262 --> 01:34:23,287
What are they offering you?

1006
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:31,995
I got kids, Tommy.

1007
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:35,399
I don't.

1008
01:34:39,547 --> 01:34:42,072
But even if you did, right?

1009
01:34:44,752 --> 01:34:48,552
- Even if you did?
- Yep, even if I did.

1010
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:42,270
You know, Bill...

1011
01:35:42,977 --> 01:35:45,537
no one expects you to be perfect.

1012
01:35:46,948 --> 01:35:50,247
But there's just a few basic things
you gotta get right.

1013
01:35:52,687 --> 01:35:55,383
Always do the best you can
by your family.

1014
01:35:55,556 --> 01:35:58,354
Go to work every day.
Always speak your mind.

1015
01:35:58,526 --> 01:36:01,290
Never hurt anyone
that doesn't deserve it.

1016
01:36:02,496 --> 01:36:05,329
And never take anything
from the bad guys.

1017
01:36:06,968 --> 01:36:08,492
That's all.

1018
01:36:08,803 --> 01:36:10,327
It's not much to ask.

1019
01:36:22,383 --> 01:36:23,907
Hello, Craven.

1020
01:38:25,106 --> 01:38:26,164
I need your car.

1021
01:39:06,447 --> 01:39:08,244
Not yet.

1022
01:39:30,004 --> 01:39:31,471
Go ahead.

1023
01:39:33,908 --> 01:39:35,102
Hold on.

1024
01:39:38,045 --> 01:39:40,138
Hey, I'll call you back.

1025
01:39:49,657 --> 01:39:52,251
Derek. Derek.

1026
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:03,530
You're all fucked up, Craven.

1027
01:40:03,704 --> 01:40:06,172
You're all done. Sit down.

1028
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,775
Lie down. Be dead.

1029
01:40:12,446 --> 01:40:13,574
You fuck.

1030
01:40:16,283 --> 01:40:18,751
- Say, "Craven."
- Fuck you.

1031
01:40:19,553 --> 01:40:20,786
You fuck.

1032
01:40:21,622 --> 01:40:22,953
"Craven." Say it.

1033
01:40:23,123 --> 01:40:25,023
Fuck. Craven.

1034
01:40:25,192 --> 01:40:26,784
- Louder!
- Craven!

1035
01:40:26,961 --> 01:40:28,588
- Louder!
- Craven!

1036
01:40:48,249 --> 01:40:50,979
I'm sorry you had to see that, honey.

1037
01:41:06,367 --> 01:41:07,459
Bennett.

1038
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:44,770
Thank God.

1039
01:41:57,685 --> 01:41:59,516
Deep down...

1040
01:42:01,055 --> 01:42:03,114
you know you deserve this.

1041
01:42:35,556 --> 01:42:37,786
Got a cop of almost 30 years,
spotless service...

1042
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:41,485
and there's not one person who can
explain his instability without lying.

1043
01:42:41,662 --> 01:42:44,654
Who has executed the director
of the nuclear research facility...

1044
01:42:44,832 --> 01:42:47,130
where his daughter was employed.

1045
01:42:47,901 --> 01:42:51,132
Okay. Ideas.

1046
01:42:57,611 --> 01:43:00,171
Your scenario is this:

1047
01:43:00,347 --> 01:43:04,249
He was accidentally poisoned
by his own daughter.

1048
01:43:07,054 --> 01:43:09,921
- But he blamed Bennett.
- How do we know that?

1049
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:14,356
Testimony of an altercation that happened
at Northmoor while he was there.

1050
01:43:14,595 --> 01:43:16,119
Testimony from the senator.

1051
01:43:16,296 --> 01:43:19,493
I can easily testify that he was unstable,
he came to my house-

1052
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:21,224
That's right.

1053
01:43:21,402 --> 01:43:23,996
He made wild allegations, he was armed.

1054
01:43:24,171 --> 01:43:26,366
You know, you was really lucky to live.

1055
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,201
That's true. That's very true.

1056
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:31,071
Now the real story here, gentlemen, is:

1057
01:43:31,245 --> 01:43:34,942
"United States Senator
Escapes Assassination."

1058
01:43:35,115 --> 01:43:38,482
Right. That's the lead story.
That'll wipe the rest out of the media.

1059
01:43:38,652 --> 01:43:42,520
Anyone who looks at the rest of this
is gonna see that something happened...

1060
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:45,350
but no one's gonna be able
to figure it out.

1061
01:43:45,859 --> 01:43:47,383
That's your objective.

1062
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:51,088
To make it so convoluted
that anyone can have a theory.

1063
01:43:51,698 --> 01:43:54,462
- But no one's got the facts.
- That's quite good, Jedburgh.

1064
01:43:55,235 --> 01:43:59,535
Senator, I've been making things
unintelligible for the past 30 years.

1065
01:43:59,706 --> 01:44:04,109
And by the way,
it's Captain Jedburgh to you.

1066
01:44:04,411 --> 01:44:07,244
Captain? Of what?

1067
01:44:09,917 --> 01:44:11,714
Very little he can tell you about.

1068
01:44:14,922 --> 01:44:17,948
Right. Well, it seems
we have a good starting point.

1069
01:44:18,125 --> 01:44:20,320
What's the prognosis on Craven?

1070
01:44:20,494 --> 01:44:22,928
Well, you know he's terminal.

1071
01:44:23,096 --> 01:44:24,563
We're all terminal, Millroy.

1072
01:44:24,731 --> 01:44:26,665
Even middle management.

1073
01:44:26,834 --> 01:44:28,529
But how fast is he being terminal?

1074
01:44:28,702 --> 01:44:31,694
- He's incapable of speech.
- Thank God for that.

1075
01:44:38,278 --> 01:44:42,578
I understand you had a chance to terminate
Detective Craven and did not do so.

1076
01:44:42,749 --> 01:44:47,516
You come to me, I look at things,
I decide.

1077
01:44:48,055 --> 01:44:50,751
Jedburgh, we've got to get the senator
out to the press.

1078
01:44:54,428 --> 01:44:56,521
I've decided what this country is.

1079
01:44:57,698 --> 01:44:59,029
What?

1080
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:02,967
People who deserve better.

1081
01:45:04,204 --> 01:45:06,570
Yeah, we all appreciate
Captain Jedburgh.

1082
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:10,836
Yet we would have not got to this extremity
had he done what the situation dictated.

1083
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:12,308
Senator.

1084
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:16,074
I don't think you really understand
what side of the situation you're on.

1085
01:45:22,456 --> 01:45:24,924
Well, I think we've had
a successful meeting.

1086
01:45:32,165 --> 01:45:36,625
I am a United States senator.

1087
01:45:38,005 --> 01:45:39,700
By what standard?

1088
01:45:52,986 --> 01:45:55,784
- You got a family?
- Yeah.

1089
01:45:56,623 --> 01:45:59,285
- Kids?
- Yeah.
