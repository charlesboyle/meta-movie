00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,095
Hey, whoa.
Absolutely not. No.

3
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:01,930
Look, if you don't wanna do
it, you don't have to do it.

4
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:03,907
Okay. Good,
I don't wanna do it.

5
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,939
Goddamn!! I'm alive.

6
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,343
Oh, that's amazing!!

7
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,849
I know, right. So..

8
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:22,717
Ready to go again?

9
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,353
Absolutely not.

10
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,730
Don't just say "fine" and
then shoot me in the chest.

11
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,463
'Cause it's not cool.

12
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,696
Like at all.

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,634
Okay. Jeez.

14
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:47,308
<b>I always wondered why no one
tried to be a superhero before me.</b>

15
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,082
<b>It turns out
somebody had. Mindy Macready.</b>

16

<b>After her dad died, his
old partner on the force,</b>

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,621
<b>Marcus, became her guardian.</b>

18
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,628
Is that a Pink Pony bag she's wearing?
Nice backpack.

19
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,754
Thanks.

20
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,559

<b>Marcus dropped
her off every day.</b>

22
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,165
<b>But as soon as he
was gone, so was she.</b>

23
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,432
<b>No one at school found out because
she hacked into the server</b>

24
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,671
<b>and gave herself the award

25

<b>Me? I'd given up

way too dangerous.</b>

32
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,334
<b>Only problem,
I was dying of boredom.</b>

33
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,667
<b>Like most high school seniors,</b>

34
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,969
<b>I had no idea what I

35
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,705
<b>Hell, I didn't know what
channel I wanted to watch.</b>

36
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,609
It's just TV, Dave, not

You guys watch
Spider-Man last night?

40
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,712
Is it weird that Aunt
May gets me kinda hard?

41
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,449
Not if you're
a granny-slammer.

<b>They may wear

<b>and in the two years since
the first ordinary citizens</b>

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,393
<b>donned capes and masks,</b>

46

<b>the movement has

47
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,470
<b>I became a superhero

48
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,887
<b>Yeah, you just
come home from work,</b>

49

<b>you grab your gear

50

<b>Help us make the streets safe.</b>

51
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,543
<b>I inspired all those

52
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,706
<b>and now I was stuck on mine.</b>

53
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:28,252
<b>So that night after dinner, I
decided to get my old costume out.</b>

54
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,881
Sorry. Whoa!!
Can't you knock?

55
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,687
You know, buddy, it's perfectly
normal for you to touch yourself..

56
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,887
Oh, Jesus, Dad.
Get out!!

57
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,096
<b>If I was even thinking
about a Kick-Ass sequel,</b>

58
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,827
<b>I had to get serious.</b>

59
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,394
Hey. Hey,
can we chat?

60
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,930
Please, Mindy?

61
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,401
Get in the cab.
Meters running.

62
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,206
I wanna team up
like Batman and Robin.

63
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,908
Nobody wants to be Robin.

64
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,213
What's wrong with Robin?

65
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,549
Weren't you like
Big Daddy's Robin?

66
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,022
Robin wishes he was me.

67
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,993
What I'm trying to say
is we should be partners,

68
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,858
you and me, like the dynamic duo.

69
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,057
I'm in the NFL, Dave.
You play pee-wee.

70
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,098
So?
Train me.

71
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,697
I wanna walk the walk,

72
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,432
and you're the closest thing
I know to a real superhero.

73
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,636
Aren't you tired
of being on your own?

74
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,912
Don't you wanna know
someone's there for you?

75
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,941
Someone who's got your back?

76
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,890
And you'll do anything I say?

77
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,152
Anything.

78
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,449
Hit me.

79
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,222
You're a 15-year-old girl.

80
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,325
What the hell?

81
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,435
Act like a bitch,
get slapped like a bitch.

82
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,266
Oh, goddamn.

83
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,740
<b>Mindy beat me like morning
wood every day for three weeks.</b>

84
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,808

Left, right, guard up!!

85
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,288
<b>Even with my damaged nerve
endings, it hurt like hell.</b>

86
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,123
<b>But, in a weird way,
I kinda liked it.</b>

87
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,450
<b>It gave me a sense of purpose.</b>

88
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,433
What happened to your face?
Nothing.

89
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,092
<b>Like we were driving

90
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,131
Goddamn!!

91
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,967

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,377
<b>All the other people putting on
masks were just playing superhero.</b>

93

94
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,509
<b>I couldn't tell my girlfriend
Katie, or Marty and Todd.</b>

95
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,143
<b>But I didn't care. We
were having too much fun.</b>

96
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,955

97
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,727
<b>Our own superhero team.</b>

98
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,694
<b>It was gonna be balls.</b>

99
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,498
What the hell, Mom? Did you
delete the news off the DVR?

100
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,837
Yes. Yes,
I did, Christopher.

101
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,004
That was the one
with Kick-Ass.

102
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:12,210
Oh, Christopher, you've gotta stop
obsessing over this superhero.

103
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,751
He is not a superhero,
Mom, he's a murderer.

104
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,048
He blew up Dad with a
bazooka, for fuck's sake!!

105
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,248
Your father died in a fire.

106
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,553
A fire?
What is your problem?

107
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,521
You!! You are my problem!!

108
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,690
I am trying to raise you
to be a normal boy!!

109
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,602
That's why we moved to Long Island
after your father's accident.

110
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,834
A bazooka is not an accident,
you delusional bitch!!

111
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,171
This conversation is over.

112
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,905
Great. Then I'm leaving.

113
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,541
Come on, Javier, be cool.

114
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,344
Sorry, Chris, but your mom
pays me not to be cool.

115
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,960
I hate you!! You home-school
me like I'm a prisoner!!

116
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,858
You threw away
my Red Mist costume.

117
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,728
God!! I am not
the problem!! You are!!

118
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,358
I wish you were dead!!

119
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,369
Mommy?

120
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,809
Don't touch that.

121
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,044
Oh, I'm sorry.
What is it?

122
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,884
It's a last resort. Like if all
else fails and you're about to die.

123
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,889
Are you not scared to die?

124
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,762
Are you scared you're never gonna
grow into your big boy pants?

125
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,835
I'm serious. What if Spider-Man
or Batman got killed one night?

126
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,959
It could happen.

127
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:43,097
If you're scared of dying, one thing
is certain, you are going to die.

128
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,733
My daddy was never
afraid of dying.

129
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,611
Look where that got him.

130
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,975
He knew he might have to make
the ultimate sacrifice one day.

131
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,584
And that's why
he made me promise

132
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,249
I'd never stop
defending this city.

133
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,487
Cross my heart,

134
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,156
hope to die.

135
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,492
Your dad was insane.
You know that, right?

136
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:16,964
You're wrong, Dave. My daddy
was the first real superhero,

137
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,807
not you or Red Mist.
It was my daddy,

138
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,480
and it was an honor
to serve by his side.

139
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,787
Hey, Min, how was school?

140
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,353
Super crazy.

141
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:40,965
Miss Mullins was out today,

142
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,195
so we had Mr. Cooper leaching
us biology, such a grump.

143
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,051
Oh, really? That's weird because
Principal Him off called me yesterday.

144
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,538
You were supposed
to get an award

145
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,165
for perfect attendance,
but you didn't attend.

146
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,910
I followed you this morning. Saw
you get into a cab with some boy,

147
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,038
and I lost you guys
over the bridge.

148
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,981
So now you wanna tell me
where you really were today?

149
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,854
I'm really sorry, Marcus.
I didn't wanna make you mad.

150
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,555
Cut the waterworks, Min.
You're 15, not five.

151
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,660
Okay.

152
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,400
Look, he asked me to cut
class and go lo the mall.

153
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,836
So, yeah, yeah, I did.

154
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,399
This has nothing to do
with you being Hit Girl?

155
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,534
I'm not gonna
find any ninja blades

156
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,909
or throwing stars
under your bed?

157
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,209
No. I just wanted him
to like me. Okay?

158
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,782
Sweetie, skipping school's not
a way to get boys to like you.

159
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,582
I'm so stupid.
Hey, hey.

160
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,602
You're one of the smartest
little girls I know.

161
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:42,151
Let's go get some pizza.

162
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,186
What, you mean
I'm not grounded?

163
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,457
Well, just consider
this a warning.

164
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,032
Hey, you sure you wanna
give all your mom's things away?

165
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,171
What the hell am I supposed
to do with all her stuff?

166
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,106
Damn, she had
a nice pair of guns.

167
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,938
Dude, she's dead!!
Don't talk about her tits.

168
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,046
I was talking about these.

169
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,810
Oh, those.
Those were my dad's.

170
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,819
Why don't you keep them?

171
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,649
Are you sure?

172
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,778
Yeah. I mean,
they belong to you, right?

173
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,757
Come on, Chris.
You're your own man now.

174
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,089
Just be careful, all right?
Yeah.

175
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,729
Whoa!!

176
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,544
Definitely don't
wanna keep those!!

177
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,763
I'll take care of it.

178
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,137
You take the day off.
Later.

179
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:40,974
Hey.

180
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,283
So, are you ready for
your first field test?

181
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,810
What am I supposed
to do with these?

182
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,755
Put them on and, uh,
go fishing.

183
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,532
I'm the whitest pimp ever.

184
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,867
That's the idea.

185
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,942
<b>Take the next right.
Comes out on Flatbush.</b>

186
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,011
You sure I should be doing
this without my gear?

187
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,170
<b>That's the point.</b>

188
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,112
<b>Kick-Ass isn't a costume.
Kick-Ass is who you really are.</b>

189

<b>Dave Lizewski is the mask.</b>

190
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,384
Well, my "mask" is about to
get his teeth kicked in.

191
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:21,118
Hey, queer bait, where are you
going with those bags, man?

192
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,286
<b>Tell him you're on your way to fuck
his mother with a 12-inch strap on.</b>

193
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,022
I'm just taking a walk.

194
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,157
This really isn't what I do. I
usually just call the cops.

195
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,235
Who are you talking to, man?

196
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,328
Uh, I'm just on a call.
It was..

197
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,136
You know, service round
here, it sucks, man.

198
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:41,009
Now give me the bags, faggot, before
I make you suck my fat cock, huh?

199
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,844
Come on.

200
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,709
Okay, okay.

201
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,014
<b>Can you believe I let Mindy
beat the snot out of me for weeks</b>

202
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,243
<b>just so I could get
my ass kicked again?</b>

203
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,080
<b>So much for a team.</b>

204
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,551
You ready to die?
You faggot!!

205
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:30,754
You know, all that homophobic
shit makes you sound super gay.

206
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,417
- Come on, man.
- Come on.

207
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,057
If I ever catch you robbing
again, shit-burger,

208
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,724
I'm gonna go Saudi Arabia on
your ass and cut your hand off.

209
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,294
Promise me you're done
with your life of crime.

210
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,735
I promise.

211
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,675
Pants on fire.

212
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,974
What do you think? I think
you almost got me killed!!

213
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,106
No. What do you
think of my line?

214
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,972
"Pants on fire."
I wrote a whole bunch of 'em.

215
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,083
Run!! I'll tell them
you saved me. Go!!

216

What's up?

219
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,798
<b>I see you answered your phone.</b>

220
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,870
<b>That means
you're not in school.</b>

221
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,310
<b>I was,</b>

222
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,475
but I wasn't feeling so good, and so
the nurse decided to send me home.

223
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,779
Poor thing.
Well, I'm almost home.

224
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,821
I'll make soup
and we can watch Jeopardy!!

225
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,788
All right.
I'll see you soon, okay?

226
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,950
<b>All right.</b>

227
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,876
Shit!!

228
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,340
You got my soup?

229
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,043
Let me take your
temperature first.

230
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,917
Oh, you're really clammy.

231
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,785
I'll feel better
after a nap-nap.

232
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,519
Close your eyes. I'm
gonna get you that soup.

233
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,622
Is that blood?

234
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,929
Damn it, Mindy.
I can't do this anymore.

235
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,930
Your father was
like a brother to me.

236
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,938
He was a great cop and a hero.

237
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,202
But Big Daddy? That was
not your father, okay?

238
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,269
That was someone who robbed
you of your childhood.

239
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,779
And this?

240
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,811
Hit Girl?
That's not who you are.

241
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,881
You are Mindy Macready and you're
just starting high school.

242
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,094
I understand that you don't
know who that person is yet,

243
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,824
but you will,
you've just gotta try.

244
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,092
I don't want to.

245
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,394
You don't know what you want.

246
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,230
You can't. You're not
an adult, not yet.

247
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:03,135
Yeah, well, I've done more in my 15 years
than most adults have in their lifetime.

248
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,171
That note that
your father gave you,

249
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,973
the one that you were supposed to
open if anything ever happened.

250
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,979
What did it say?

251
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,105
That you would take care of me.

252
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,481
And that you were supposed
to listen to me, right?

253
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,678
Well, listen up.

254
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,483
I want you in school. I want you
to stop talking to that boy.

255
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:19,955
And I want you to promise me

256
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,618
that this is never
gonna happen again.

257
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,601
Cross my heart,

258
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,633
hope to die.

259
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,273
Good.

260
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,287
<b>Mindy!!</b>

261
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,353
What the hell?

262
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,533
First you almost get me
killed, then you stand me up.

263
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,533
Dave, I'm sorry.

264
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,227
I mean, I..
You are?

265
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,126
I am.

266
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,232
For everything.

267
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,406
Oh, okay, great.

268
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,640
I mean, "apologetic" isn't a
word I'd use to describe you.

269
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,043
How many times do
I have to say it?

270
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,311
Look, let's get out of here.

271
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,848
You gotta ease up. I think
I might have broken a rib.

272
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,412
Dave, I'm done.

273
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,024
With training?

274
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,490
With everything.

275
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,826
Wait, you mean everything?

276
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,094
You can't.
You're Hit Girl.

277
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,396
We were gonna start a team,
you can't just quit.

278
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,335
This is who you are.

279
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,565
Not anymore, Dave.

280
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,176
I'm sorry, but it's over.
I'm done.

281
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,507
She just broke up with him?

282
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,706
Just leave me alone.

283
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,942
Will you stop apologizing?

284
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,085
I don't know what's worse, that
you're fucking a 9th-grader

285
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,711
or that you just got dumped by one.
Whoa, whoa!!

286
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:58,847
Pedophile freak.

287
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,955
It's not like that

288
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,582
Then what is it like?
Please, tell me.

289
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,685
I can't. It's to do with the
Kick-Ass thing.

290
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,594
I've got a secret for you.
You remember Malik?

291
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,928
Dude who volunteers
at your needle exchange?

292
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,026
His baton is so much
bigger than Kick-Ass'.

293
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,866
No.
Yeah.

294
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,773
And by "baton," I mean penis.

295
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,805
Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

296
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,611
Fifteen gets you 20, pervert.

297
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,213
A freshman, Dave?
You old, salty dog.

298
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,713
What's the problem? Grass on
the field, play ball. Right?

299
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,778
No, Todd.

300
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,981
<b>Chris, your tutor's here.</b>

301
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:34,951
Chris!!

302
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,151
Chris, your..

303
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,487
Holy shit.
What the hell is that?

304
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,123
My destiny.

305
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,335
Chris, just because your mom liked
to get a little freaky now.

306
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,405
I know what my role
is in this, Javier.

307
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,806
My dad was a crime boss,
so it just makes sense.

308
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,312
I'm a super villain.
It's evolution.

309
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,573
Come on, come on.

310
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,775
Just put those things down
before you hurt somebody, Chris.

311
00:18:58,838 --> 00:18:59,908
That's not my name.

312
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,651
Okay, okay.
Uh, Red Mist..

313
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,517
Red Mist was my superhero name.

314
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,284
Henceforth I'll be known as

315
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,355
The Motherfucker.

316
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,456
<b>After Mindy quit,</b>

317
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,659
<b>I decided to stop hitting the heavy
bag and start hitting the streets.</b>

318
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,928
Hey, Kick-Ass,
welcome back!!

319
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,129
Yeah!!
Shoo!!

320
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,928
You're the best, man!!

321
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,475
<b>Only problem,
I was still on my own.</b>

322
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,100
<b>So I went online and found
a physics professor</b>

323
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,169
<b>calling himself
"Dr. Gravity."</b>

324
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,375
<b>Sure, he wasn't Hit Girl,
but I had to start somewhere.</b>

325
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,009
This is the zero G device
that I invented.

326
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,349
Can levitate
any object up to a ton.

327
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,649
For real?

328
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,022
Hell, no, man. This is a
baseball bat wrapped in tinfoil.

329
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,651
But it fooled you.

330
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,695
Hey, could I get a Diet
Mountain Dew, please?

331
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,321
I'm not even
a physics professor.

332
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,957
Just a copywriter
for an ad agency.

333
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,033
But that's why
I love this stuff.

334
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,297
You can be anyone you want!!

335
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,740
You done many
team-ups before?

336
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,309
Kind of. Yeah.
No, not really.

337
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,502
I was getting kinda nervous about
being on my own, you know?

338
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,571
Yeah, me, too. I never
even been in a fight.

339
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,516
Well, hopefully
you won't have to.

340
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,020
I friend ed a guy talking about forming
a team, if you're interested.

341
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,714
I don't know how serious he is,

342
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,253
but his picture
was pretty hard core.

343
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,386
Are you kidding me?
That's why I contacted you.

344
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,997
I didn't wanna freak you out
by bringing it up too soon.

345
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,533
I'll show you his profile
after I hit the men's room.

346
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,897
Your Uncle Ralph's not
gonna be happy about this, Chris.

347
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,063
That's not my name.

348
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,606
I'm not calling
you that, forget it.

349
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,733
Javier, you worked for my dad.

350
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,870
Then you worked for my mom.
Now you work for me.

351
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,677
I'm probably the richest kid
in New York City.

352
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,182
But if you don't like that,

353
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,186
find yourself another
motherfucking job, okay?

354
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,780
Yo, Kick-Ass!!

355
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,356
Man, am I glad to see you.

356
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,017
<b>Is there anything
I can do to help, sir?</b>

357
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,753
Yeah. I was hoping you can help
me get a million hits on YouTube.

358
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:00,864
Come on. Come on.

359
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,056
Run, Kick-Ass, run!!

360
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,825
Jersey Shore motherfucker!!

361
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,564
Hey, what, you not
interested in a fair fight?

362
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,615
That is no fair fight.
Team meeting tomorrow.

363
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,422
I'll e-mail you the address.

364
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,907
Beware Dr. Gravity!!

365
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,010
<b>You had to admire
the Doctor's enthusiasm.</b>

366
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,579
<b>I couldn't wait
to meet his friends.</b>

367
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,784
Hands in the air, Spring Roll.

368
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,121
Empty the register and
don't do anything stupid.

369
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,490
Come on!! Hey, where are
your security cameras?

370
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,756
We don't have them. Too expensive.
Seriously?

371
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,493
What the fuck? How's this gonna go viral?
You want to be filmed?

372
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,158
Shut up and just
get on the ground!!

373
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,704
And you'd better tell people
The Motherfucker was here.

374
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,102
What's wrong with you, boy?

375
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,504
Get on the floor, too, Gandalf,

376
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,634
or I will bust
a cap in your ass.

377
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,040
You're gonna bust your own face

378
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,875
when that gun kicks if you
don't hold it properly.

379
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,949
Just get on the ground!!

380
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,285
God, will you hurry up!!

381
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,347
I told you.

382
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,537
Go!! Go, go, go!!

383
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,140
Start the car!! Go, go!!

384
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,966
It was amazing!!

385
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,370
I feel so alive. I know who I am.
I know why I'm here.

386
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,710
I'm gonna fuck this world up!!

387
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,150
They will know The Motherfuckers name!!

388
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,382
You've gotta find me some bad-ass
MAM types to train me, okay?

389
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,650
Like a Chuck Liddell
or whoever.

390
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,216
Fuck, I don't care
how much it costs.

391
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:07,354
I just wanna be able to kill
Kick-Ass with my bare hands.

392
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,329
I gotta tweet about this.

393
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,081
All right.
Are you ready?

394
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,451
Um, I don't know.
Am I?

395
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,290
Yes, you are.
You look great.

396
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,287
And Barbara's daughter,
Brooke, is really nice.

397
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,697
What am I supposed
to talk to them about?

398
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,635
I'd rather be water-boarded
than listen to Justin Bieber.

399
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,602
You're gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be a disaster.

400
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,269
How do you know that?

401
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,036
Because it's a slumber party,
for fuck's sake.

402
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,105
Dollar. Jar.

403
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,613
You're gonna need a bigger jar.

404
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,789
Pretty cool, huh? This is how
the beer gets delivered.

405
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,993
Dude. You got a secret elevator
to your underground headquarters.

406
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,158
Yeah. The guy I told
you about owns this place.

407
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,997
It's like a real-life bat-cave.

408
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,594
I know, right.
Oh, yeah.

409
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,736
This is the single greatest
thing I've ever seen.

410
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,012
Welcome to Justice Forever.

411
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,493
Hi, Detective Williams.
This must be Mindy.

412
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,923
It is. Hi, Brooke.

413
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:48,260
You girls have fun and I'll pick
you up in the morning, okay?

414
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,628
I'll be the one
with the slit wrists.

415
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,328
No, you're gonna be the one
that gets the awesome manicure.

416
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,802
I am?
Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

417
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,372
Say "hey" to Mindy, ladies.

418
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:58,498
Hey.

419
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,631
I know you.

420
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,379
You're that freshman who took a ride
on Dave Lizewski's disco stick.

421
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,640
I did not ride his..

422
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,702
If you just blew him, you're
totes a virgin, right?

423
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,183
She didn't blow him,
look at her.

424
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,047
Then what? Rim job?
Hand job? Fingerbang?

425
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,485
Sweet-Ryan-Seacrest, you at
least kissed him, right?

426
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:13,982
Totes.

427
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,792
You've never kissed
a boy, have you?

428
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,559
Oh, my God,
that is so adorable.

429
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,685
Maybe she's a dyke.

430
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,026
Maybe I'll jam
my foot up your snatch.

431
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,294
Oh, she's super bitchy,
I likes.

432
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,336
Then what's
the big deal anyway?

433
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,804
What could be so great about gagging
on some douche-bag's tongue?

434
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,635
It's pretty fucking great.

435
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,733
You know how you feel when you
watch that video by Union J?

436
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,369
Holy shit, you don't know?

437
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,641
This will change your life.

438
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,583
<b>Don't ever say you're
lonely Just lay your problems on me</b>

439
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,382
<b>And I'll be waiting
there for you</b>

440
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:49,050
You guys love this shit more than
fanboys love Stan Lee, don't you?

441
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,559
Who's Stan Lee?

442
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,062
<b>I'll carry you I'll carry you</b>

443
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,195
<b>I'll carry you</b>

444
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,094
<b>So you know that I'll carry you</b>

445
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:04,501
<b>I'll carry you</b>

446
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,110
<b>Like you've been
running for hours</b>

447
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,839
<b>And can't catch your breath</b>

448
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,180
<b>The demons are screaming
so loud in your head</b>

449
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,850
<b>You're tired You're broken</b>

450
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,946
<b>You're cut and you're bruised</b>

451
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,444
<b>But nothing's too heavy
Just hold on</b>

452
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,392
<b>I'll carry you</b>

453
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,587
What the fuck was that?

454
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,356
I know, right?
I'm soaked.

455
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,432
That? That is
who you are, Mindy.

456
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,591
You may not dress
like us or talk like us,

457
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,033
but when it comes to boys,
we're all the same.

458
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,105
Twilight. Channing Tatum.
Union J.

459
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,540
It's biology, bitch.
Don't fight it.

460
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,271
I, um..

461
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,107
I gotta go.

462
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,616
But we were gonna go and get high
on bath salts at Logan's house.

463
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,151
Mindy, I wanna
give you a chance

464
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,552
that the rest of the girls
in our class would kill for.

465
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:56,319
Don't you wanna walk out the door
every day in skin-tight clothes

466
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,122
knowing that
everyone warships you?

467
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,461
Don't you wanna sneak out at
night, raise a little hell,

468
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,261
and show the world
what a strong,

469
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,236
independent woman
is capable of?

470
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,501
Don't you wanna belong?

471
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:13,236
<b>So you know that I'll carry you</b>

472
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,470
Can I wear this to Logan's?

473
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,601
Yay!!

474
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,236
It's gonna be so much fun.

475
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,412
So we tried the cops
and tried the newspapers,

476
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,451
and even set up a, you know,
a thing on the Internet

477
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,253
for people to
help us find Tommy.

478
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,493
Um..

479
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:36,430
But we got nothing. We
never saw our son again.

480
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,465
I came up with the name
Remembering Tommy,

481
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,766
and, uh, we've been doing this
three nights a week. So..

482
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,932
Colonel Stars and Stripes
found us online.

483
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:50,447
That's terrible, guys.
I'm real sorry.

484
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:54,109
I became Night Bitch after my sister
was murdered and found in a dumpster.

485
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,377
Holy shit.

486
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,147
Doesn't bring her back,

487
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,209
but at least I'm doing
something positive about it.

488
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,390
Insect Man.
Yeah, um..

489
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,124
I've been bullied my whole
life for being gay,

490
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:08,130
so now I stand up
for the defenseless.

491
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,460
That's why I don't wear a mask.

492
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,042
Too much like being
back in the closet.

493
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,368
Long as your
heart's in the right place,

494
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,132
we don't care what you
put in your mouth.

495
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,333
Fist bump.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

496
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,568
Well, I became Battle Guy

497
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,341
after my parents were mugged and
killed coming home from the opera.

498
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,905
Did I tell you
that sick bastard

499
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,745
maxed out their credit
cards on porno sites?

500
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,217
I hope we get the chance to
say hello to this guy someday

501
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,983
so I can personally levitate
his soul from his body.

502
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,716
Oh, my God. Marty?

503
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,517
Yeah, I knew
I recognized your voice.

504
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,822
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

505
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,522
I don't know no Marty.
New guy.

506
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,260
Hey, asshole, it's me, Dave.

507
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:49,165
Dave? Why are you
dressed like Kick-Ass?

508
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,672
Because I'm Kick-Ass.

509
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:52,901
You two know each other?

510
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,534
Yeah, like since we were five.

511
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,374
What's all this bullshit about
your parents getting killed?

512
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,039
Yes, language.
What?

513
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,846
Battle Guy, care to
update your resume?

514
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,084
Uh..

515
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,247
I'm trying to figure out
how to explain this

516
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:10,122
without sounding like
a complete idiot right now.

517
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,422
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's possible, Batman.

518
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,587
I'm not, either.

519
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,459
Um..

520
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,155
Okay. Well, when I found
you guys online,

521
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,760
you were all swapping these
awesome origin stories.

522
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,898
I mean, Colonel, you're
ex-Mafia, for Christ's sake.

523
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:25,031
Yo. Don't take
the Lord's name in vain.

524
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,733
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,903
I didn't think you'd
let me join the team

526
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,039
unless I had a good story, too.

527
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,978
All right, we'll let you off the
hook this time, Battle Guy.

528
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,985
Wanna see something cool?
Yeah.

529
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,722
I thought this could
be our meeting room.

530
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,217
Whoa, this is so cool.

531
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,627
Now this little renovation
was totally clandestine,

532
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,892
which means nobody knew about it.

533
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:54,231
Now, I know it's not much, but
this is just the beginning.

534
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,067
Together we can make
a real difference.

535
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,232
Whoa!!

536
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,008
If you'd consider it,
Kick-Ass,

537
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,907
we'd be honored
to have you join us.

538
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,173
Hell, yeah!!

539
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,910
That's what I like to hear.

540
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,749
Right, time for initiation.

541
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,188
Turn around and I'll unzip you.

542
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,448
I'm sorry, what?

543
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,495
Just joking. Let's get
down to business.

544
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,324
Gotcha.

545
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,490
There you are.

546
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,591
We saved you a seat in the
cafe, but you never showed.

547
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,262
I usually head over to the
Olive Garden to carb load.

548
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,104
I haven't had white sugar
since my first birthday.

549
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,471
Do we need a thintervention?

550
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,942
Come on, best way to tighten up
a tummy is varsity dance team.

551
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,308
The sign-up sheet
just went up.

552
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,343
It's still blowing
my mind. Kick-Ass.

553
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,443
It's like finding out
your best friend's

554
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,852
always been Will Smith,
you know?

555
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,616
Hi, guys. What are you
talking about?

556
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,023
Nothing.

557
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,887
Nothing?
Yeah, Todd, nothing.

558
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,055
All right.
See you around, guys.

559
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,958
Todd, wait.

560
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,802
Ow, watch it.
Watch me end your life.

561
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,167
Come on. Forget it.

562
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,539
Just one of the dickheads that
follows The Motherfucker on Twitter.

563
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,575
Who?

564
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,866
The Motherfucker.
He's some guy

565
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,402
claiming to be the world's
first supervillain.

566
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,243
He's got 1,000
followers already.

567
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,372
What an asshole.

568
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,642
Get some!!
Uh-huh!! Yeah!!

569
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,585
You got this, Motherfucker!!

570
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,315
You really think
he's got a shot?

571
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,086
I wouldn't take
his money if I didn't.

572
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,853
MA is like chess.

573
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,192
It's all about the moves. And
your boy really knows his stuff.

574
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,263
Time to die, asshole.

575
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,165
You all right?
I'm cool. Ow!!

576
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:39,442
Good job.
Nice jab, buddy.

577
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,011
Come on, stay loose, baby.
Walk it off, walk it off.

578
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,714
- on!!
- Shit!!

579
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,181
Oh, you broke my leg!!

580
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,414
- Come on. Do something.
- Let's take a break.

581
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,884
Yeah, yeah, let's
take a break, guys. Come on.

582
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,181
Street rules, bitch!!

583
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,349
Chuck!! Get this girl off me!!

584
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,590
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

585
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,254
You all right, Chris?
You all right, buddy?

586
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,094
Get off me!!
I was winning.

587
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,690
No, you were crying.

588
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:09,233
You know what? Screw this.
My super power

589
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,071
is that I'm rich as shit.

590
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,871
Hey, you wanna
work for me, huh?

591
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,707
You wanna beat
people up for me?

592
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,639
Sure.
All right!!

593
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,444
Let's get you
a mask and a costume,

594
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:23,816
and we will call you
Black Death.

595
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:27,220
Whoa, whoa, you don't think that's
just a little bit incredibly racist?

596
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,450
I don't give a shit.

597
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:29,958
I want you to put the word out

598
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,721
that I'm willing
to pay top dollar

599
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,023
for every hired hitter in town.

600
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,256
Come on, come on.
Just talk about it first

601
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,389
Money talks.

602
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,727
You wanted me to be my own man.

603
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,268
This is what it looks like.

604
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,737
All right, all right, I'll
make some calls. Yes!!

605
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,604
Anybody else wanna
be a supervillain?

606
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,176
Promise I pay better than
Chuck-little-dick-Liddell.

607
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,836
What did you call me?
No, no, man.

608
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:52,176
He took a hit to the head.
Doesn't know what he's saying.

609
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,741
I've been studying
privately with Coach Podell.

610
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:59,618
And by studying, I mean my mom
paid her off to make me varsity.

611
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:03,419
So, if you're half decent, I'll
make sure she puts you on the team.

612
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,017
At least as an alternate.

613
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,754
You'd do that for me?

614
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,187
Besties stick together.

615
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,426
If Brooke wants a pet,
she should just get a dog.

616
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,765
She's just trying to recreate
Mindy in her own image.

617
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,928
All right, ladies, have a seat.
Let's get started.

618
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,803
Mindy Macready?

619
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:05,250
Chill. As long as you don't
fall on your face, you're in.

620
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:06,912
Go.

621
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,037
Four attackers.

622
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,603
No escape.

623
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,123
Oh, my God. You
could totally make captain.

624
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,061
That was so much
better than Brooke's.

625
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,497
Oh, my God.

626
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,668
Brooke doesn't stand a
chance for captain after that.

627
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,563
<b>A bunch of people
with made-up names</b>

628
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,971

00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,804
<b>searching the web

00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,572
<b>The comic book heroes

632
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,417
Scales, like a red, white and blue.
It's awesome.

633
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,180
What's that?
Brick.

634
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,344
Right.

635
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,080
What do you think?
I think it does the job.

636
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,658
<b>People should get
what they deserve.</b>

637
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,490
<b>Family living in the street
deserves a hot meal.</b>

638
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,100
An inebriated college girl deserves
to make it home safe at night.

639
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,999
And a pervert, pedophile,

640
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,170
deserves a visit
from Eisenhower.

641
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,769
Schwaniz!!

642
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,437
Ouch.

643
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,035
You don't wanna hit
with your closed fist.

644
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,341
You might break your hand,
then you're defenseless.

645
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:15,043
You wanna hit with open palm and pivot.
Open palm and pivot.

646
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,208
Grab the back“.

647
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,112
<b>I never made varsity football</b>

648
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,121
<b>or got cast in the school play.</b>

649
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,455
<b>Hell, I never even

650
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:24,787
Knock out, bitch!!

651
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,527
<b>But if I had, I gotta believe it
would've felt a lot like this.</b>

652
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,859
When the cops can no
longer protect and serve,

653
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,665
be warned, mugger,
heads up, perv.

654
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,206
We got the strength,
we got the nerve

655
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,832
to give those in need
what they deserve!!

656
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,967
Justice Forever!!

657
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,504
<b>We were in the ultimate clique.</b>

658
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,709
<b>It didn't matter that

659
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,720
<b>We knew.
And we felt like rock stars.</b>

660
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,989
Good night, guys.
Nice job. Battle Guy.

661
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,720
Night, Colonel.
Thanks for everything.

662
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:00,189
No, son, thank you.

663
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,025
You showed us that every
man can make a difference.

664
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,328
Without Kick-Ass,
none of us would be here.

665
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,903
That's from the heart.
Don't let it go to your head.

666
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,032
So..

667
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,405
I'm not really that tired.

668
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,079
Mmm.

669
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,284
Mmm-mmm?

670
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,916
Mmm. Okay.

671
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,018
Let's leave the masks on.

672
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,227
Yeah?
Yeah.

673
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,459
Yeah!!

674
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,569
<b>First big mission's tonight</b>

675
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,367
and it's not community service.

676
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,909
We're taking on
some real bad guys.

677
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,772
What, can't your
team handle it?

678
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,573
They're not you, Mindy.

679
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,444
Remembering Tommy
owns a dry fruit business.

680
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,881
Night Bitch teaches ballet.

681
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,452
Night Bitch?

682
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,249
What is she? A superhero
or a soft core porno?

683
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,323
Maybe a little bit of both.

684
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,655
Oh, God, you're plugging her?

685
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,729
I'm gonna vom.

686
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,126
You're like a ninja.

687
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:11,496
Can't you just sneak out
after Marcus goes to sleep?

688
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,292
You don't get it, Dave.

689
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:17,471
I made a promise to Marcus.

690
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,304
So break it. You're a
superhero, remember?

691
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,002
Mindy Macready's
just a disguise.

692
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,177
Yeah, well, I don't know what
kind of superhero Night Whore is,

693
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,012
but if you really think
I'd ever break my word,

694
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,677
you obviously have
no idea who I am.

695
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,570
I know that making dance team doesn't
make you stop being who you are.

696
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,524
I know Hit Girl
couldn't give a shit

697
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,093
about what high school
girls are into.

698
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,752
I know that you wouldn't go on a
date if your life depended on it.

699
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:41,989
Go to hell, Dave.

700
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,997
What? You know I'm right.

701
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,334
Hey!! Roid Rage.

702
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,937
Me?
Yeah.

703
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,533
You wanna take me
on a date sometime?

704
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,632
Uh, yeah.
Sure. Um..

705
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,108
My name's, um, Simon.

706
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,670
Great, um, Simon.

707
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,843
It's a date.

708
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,351
Mindy, I'm sorry.

709
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,511
Is there a problem, Min?

710
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:05,644
Zero.

711
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:08,656
Good. Because
I don't like problems.

712
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,020
<b>Dave, you been
sneaking out at night?</b>

713
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,184
Mrs. Neipert said

714
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,230
she thought she saw you leaving
at 2:00 in the morning.

715
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,799
Miss Neipert's crazy, Dad.

716
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,029
She tried to teach
her dog Spanish.

717
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,466
Are you on drugs?

718
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:24,968
Seriously?

719
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,201
I gotta ask.

720
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,676
You're my best bud and
you're growing up so fast.

721
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,546
Promise me you're not
doing anything foolish?

722
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,176
Yeah, I promise.

723
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,315
Good enough for me, pal.

724
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,517
You're too smart to
do anything stupid.

725
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,817
Justice Forever!!

726
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,694
I'm glad you got that out of your system.

727
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:53,761
Oh, Todd texted me.
Again. What a loser.

728
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,166
Dude, how bad-ass is
Colonel Stars and Stripes?

729
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,572
Yeah, I still can't believe
he's an ex-mob enforcer.

730
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,940
I mean, how do you go from
that to being a superhero?

731
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,273
He's a born-again Christian.

732
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:04,608
Shut up.
Yeah.

733
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,374
Let's hope he
can handle tonight.

734
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,519
I guess we're
about to find out.

735
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,365
Hey. Where's the rest
of the team?

736
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,227
Dr. Gravity has the flu,

737
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,565
and Remembering Tommy got
Book of Mormon tickets, so..

738
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,228
That's okay.

739
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,100
Five of us should do.

740
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,765
How did you say this guy made
his money, sir? Prostitution?

741
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:37,605
Not just girls. Kids. Ships them
in from villages back home.

742
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,704
Boneheads in blue
take a blind eye.

743
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,714
How do you know
he's here tonight?

744
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,980
Because Thursday night
is poker night.

745
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,748
Same five low-lifes
every week.

746
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,449
Man with a habit
ain't hard to find.

747
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,288
So what's the plan?
Are we sneaking in?

748
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,759
I thought we'd knock.
It's more polite.

749
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,091
What?

750
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,754
Stay frosty, team.

751
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,326
I used to eat punks
like this for breakfast.

752
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,731
Jehovah's Witness!!

753
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,181
I'm sorry, I just
zoned out for a second.

754
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,689
Did you say that we're going
up against five gangsters?

755
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,350
And bouncer makes six.

756
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,458
And three-quarters.

757
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,659
What the fuck do you want?

758
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,963
Good evening, young man. We'd
like a word with Jimmy Kim.

759
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,436
If it's not too inconvenient

760
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:43,669
Get the fuck out of here before I
tear your head off, you old fuck.

761
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:45,937
I'm sorry.

762
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,442
I think we're in trouble.

763
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,813
I just don't understand
why people feel the need

764
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,819
to use that kind of language.

765
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,021
Whoa!!

766
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,460
There he goes.

767
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,065
Oh, sweet Jesus.

768
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:09,571
Battle Guy, what did I tell you about
taking the Lord's name in vain?

769
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,798
Sorry, sir.

770
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,307
Eisenhower, at the ready.

771
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,984
Insect Man, I want you
right behind me.

772
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,479
Everybody else spread out,
catch the strays.

773
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,806
Oh.

774
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,977
And try to have fun,
otherwise what's the point?

775
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,978
Nice party.
Anybody wanna dance?

776
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,597
Where are you going?

777
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,569
Very nice.
Behind you!!

778
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,400
Watch the birdie.

779
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,169
Whoo!!

780
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,779
Don't you move.

781
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,911
Night Bitch!!
Behind you!!

782
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,084
Wait.

783
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,029
MARTY; LOOK out!!

784
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,870
Okay, I got his right arm.

785
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,106
You know, you shouldn't talk
with your mouth full.

786
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,708
It's very rude.
Come on.

787
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,549
Who the hell are you?

788
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,418
We're the good guys.

789
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,290
Oh, no, you're
the fucking dead guys.

790
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:42,660
Eisenhower!! Schwantz!!

791
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,767
On!!

792
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,130
Ow!!

793
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,231
Where are the girls?

794
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,675
Come on, man.
I've got a heart problem.

795
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,836
Oh, yeah?

796
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:58,669
No.

797
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,442
Do you want me
to solve that for you?

798
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,451
Whoa, whoa!!

799
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,914
Okay. The girls are
upstairs in the apartments.

800
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,254
My little brother, he's on the
till-He's just a college kid.

801
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,121
Kick-Ass, Night Bitch.
On it.

802
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,254
Ralph D'Amico is
gonna end you for this.

803
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:16,764
Ow!! It hurts!!

804
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,097
Yeah,
there's a dog on your balls.

805
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,969
You want money? There's
50 grand on the table.

806
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:27,940
Please just make him stop!! Please!!

807
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,272
You think you can buy us?
Is that what you think?

808
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,542
We're not here
to steal from you.

809
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:38,679
We're hereto send a message to
all the other bottom-dwellers.

810
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,953
- We're shutting you down.
- Come on.

811
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,789
There is a van waiting outside
from a battered women's shelter.

812
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,193
It'll take you some place safe.

813
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,322
Go. Go.
We really can't leave.

814
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,194
We have no money.

815
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:54,125
Battle Guy, how much
they have on the table?

816
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,169
Oh, it's like 50 grand.

817
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,035
You got plenty now.

818
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,641
Thank you.

819
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:11,979
Good job, guys.

820
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,546
Very tidy.
Very tidy.

821
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,660
I can't believe you pulled
a gun on that guy.

822
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,385
Were you really
gonna shoot him?

823
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,394
Let you in on a little secret.

824
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,661
Empty.
Don't tell the bad guys.

825
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,899
Pardon my language, Colonel, but
you have got some serious balls.

826
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,234
Certainly more than Mr. Kim.

827
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,740
"There's a dog on my balls."

828
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:38,872
God damn it.

829
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,339
Javier!!
What happened?

830
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,942
Some douche just posted a link
to a story about a whorehouse,

831
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,043
says that Kick-Ass'
team took them out.

832
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,851
What the hell?
Where's my crew?

833
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,117
Chris, everybody's just..

834
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,794
Uh, can you ladies
excuse us for a second?

835
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,124
Uh, no, they're my sidekicks.

836
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,596
They can listen to
what we have to say.

837
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:57,722
They're not
your sidekicks, Chris.

838
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,064
They're prostitutes
and witnesses, come on.

839
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,034
All right.
Sorry, no offense.

840
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,867
Everybody's just too afraid of
your Uncle Ralph to take the job.

841
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,965
But he's in prison.

842
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,135
Doesn't matter.
He runs the family now.

843
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,543
And he wants
everybody to lay low.

844
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:12,944
But, fortunately for you,

845
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,540
Big Tony doesn't know how
to lay low, so he's in.

846
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,984
I don't remember a Big Tony.
Is he huge? He's ironic.

847
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:21,617
<b>5 foot 4, but mean as shit.</b>

848
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,724
<b>He's go!! such a hard-on
for killing people.</b>

849
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,325
He's little and he kills.
Right.

850
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,402
Call him "The Tumor,"

851
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,593
<b>Who's next?</b>

852
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,800
<b>All right, we've got, uh, an
ex-Triad member looking for work.</b>

853
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,842
Easy, "Genghis Carnage."
Come on.

854
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,579
You gotta quit with the
racist stereotypes, Chris.

855
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,637
Archetypes.
Keep going.

856
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:48,773
We got, uh,
Katarina Dumbrovski.

857
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:49,977
Wait, wait. A chick?

858
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,108
Yeah.

859
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,620
<b>Seriously, you hired a chick?</b>

860
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:57,453
<b>Yeah. Former KGB. She was locked up in
the Gulag until she ate her eel/mate.</b>

861
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,187
Okay. "Mother Russia."

862
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,664
Mother Russia and Motherfucker
both on the same team?

863
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:04,824
That doesn't work, Chris.

864
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,697
I am not asking for
suggestions, asshole.

865
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,965
Just get them costumes
and get them ready!!

866
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:11,498
Shit.

867
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,438
Javier, thank you.

868
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,477
I couldn't do this without you.

869
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:20,706
You're pretty much like the
only real family I have left.

870
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,708
Not a problem, man.
I got your back.

871
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,550
It's kinda like you're the
Alfred to my evil Bruce Wayne.

872
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,351
Did you just call me
your fucking butler?

873
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,217
Yeah, is that not a compliment?

874
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,618
Shit. My bad.

875
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,161
<b>There wasn't
much action most nights.</b>

876
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,728
<b>I mean, there was always a
little action with Night Bitch.</b>

877
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:49,809
<b>The reality of being a
superhero is lots of patrols.</b>

878
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:53,244
<b>But that didn't stop people
from begging to join up.</b>

879
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,379
<b>With all our new members, it seemed
kinda shitty not to ask Todd.</b>

880
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,758
Stop peeking, man,
you're gonna ruin it.

881
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,886
Check it out.

882
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,356
You can't fight crime in that Your
pants are so tight, you got frog-eye.

883
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,026
What the
hell's "frog-eye"?

884
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,729
Male camel toe.
What?

885
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,650
I'm not really sure about
these names, either.

886
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:20,357
"Whup-Ass," "Kick-Ass-Man."

887
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,705
"Dr. Kick-Ass"?
Yeah.

888
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,837
Yeah, they all
kinda seem derivative.

889
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,244
Let me translate that.

890
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,944
You can't just copy Dave's
name, you knob-gobbler.

891
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,115
Okay. Um..

892
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,048
Uh..

893
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,216
Oh, wait. Oh, I got it.

894
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:37,687
I got it. I got it.

895
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:41,190
"Ass Kicker"

896
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,127
Seriously?

897
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,461
You're such a dick, Marty.

898
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,092
I know this is why you guys
aren't texting me back,

899
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:48,261
I'm not an actual idiot.

900
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,532
Well, you could have
fooled me, Ass-Licker.

901
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:53,899
Yeah. well, screw you guys.
Todd..

902
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,875
No, really.
Fuck you guys.

903
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,207
I'm gonna go find my own team.

904
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,803
Todd. Wait. Come on.

905
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,642
<b>Todd was right,
we were being dicks.</b>

906
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,118
<b>But the truth is,
the only person</b>

907
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:08,088
<b>I really wanted on
the team was Mindy,</b>

908
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,722
<b>but she was too busy
trying not to be a superhero.</b>

909
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,059
Okay, Min, he's here.

910
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,398
Your first big date.
How are you feeling?

911
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,472
Like the first time
Big Daddy sent me into

912
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:28,237
a crack den with nothing
but a penknife.

913
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,106
I've got some butterflies.

914
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,307
You just be yourself
and you let me be nervous.

915
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:39,080
Don't worry about me. I can
kill a man with his own finger.

916
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,181
A word of advice, I wouldn't
open with that.

917
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,656
Thanks for letting me
finally take you out.

918
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:49,924
Well, uh,

919
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:53,268
how else was I gonna get
you to stop calling?

920
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,593
Thanks.
You're welcome.

921
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:10,012
Where are we going?

922
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,279
To a party.

923
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,219
Why is this party in
the middle of nowhere?

924
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,622
Because that's where keg
parties usually are, right?

925
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,673
Guess we're
the first ones here.

926
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,333
This isn't where you
have a party, moron.

927
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,844
This is where you
dump a dead body.

928
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,503
What's your problem?

929
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,741
I'm sorry.

930
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,383
I'll stop being such a bitch.

931
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:44,795
You actually seem
like a nice guy.

932
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,081
So, um..

933
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,587
You wanna hook up?

934
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:51,887
And a total idiot.

935
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:56,891
Simon, get back in the car.

936
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,731
Now!!

937
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,108
Yay, you made it.

938
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,746
Brooke?

939
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:15,250
This is to celebrate you.

940
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,417
Celebrate?

941
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,510
What a total loser you are.

942
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,747
And we ditch losers.

943
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,887
Poor Mindy.
What did you think?

944
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,854
The cool kids saw
something special in you

945
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,400
and invited you
to your first party

946
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,428
where you'd sip your first beer

947
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:37,472
and finally suck face
for the first time?

948
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:41,034
Newsflash, you're not special.

949
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:47,104
Fuck with the queen bee
and you're gonna get stung.

950
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,879
Date ditch.

951
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:52,981
Party at my house!!

952
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:54,147
Pathetic.

953
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,588
Simon, you can drive us.

954
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,199
Dave?

955
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:49,839
Oh, my God!! Mindy? Holy shit.
What are you doing?

956
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:54,276
Just needed to see
my Robin, I guess.

957
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,116
Are you okay?

958
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,518
Hey, hey, hey.

959
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,020
I don't know what to do.

960
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,287
Those girls, they're..

961
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,994
They're evil.

962
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,835
It's just high school.
Who gives a shit?

963
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:19,397
You should be out there in the real
world making it a better place.

964
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:21,704
Dave, I can't.

965
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,540
I know, you promised your dad.

966
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,180
But he's not here anymore.

967
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,816
This is your life.
You've gotta live it.

968
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,086
How am I supposed
to face them tomorrow?

969
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:38,683
I'm so embarrassed.

970
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:39,750
Why?

971
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:44,321
You're smart. You're beautiful.
You're funny.

972
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:50,431
You're the strongest person I've ever met.
You can do anything.

973
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,674
And you're Hit Girl.

974
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,241
Doesn't matter if you're
wearing a mask or makeup,

975
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,778
it's who you really are.

976
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,277
So what should I do?
Cut their tongues out?

977
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,874
No!! Definitely not.

978
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,420
I'm fucking with you.

979
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,750
Just beat them
at their own game.

980
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,951
By being yourself.

981
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,869
<b>Well, if you
really wanna be popular,</b>

982
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:29,033
consider two little words,
"sexy" "tape."

983
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:48,322
Lois, you don't
need these ax wounds.

984
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,921
If I can dress
like them, so can you.

985
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:55,260
It's a gift from some drug
dealer who went missing.

986
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,406
Just because you dress like us,

987
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,473
doesn't mean you
can be like one of us.

988
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,075
It doesn't matter what costume
I wear, yours or mine,

989
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:07,012
I'm a superhero.
That's who I am.

990
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,117
Okay,
Captain Muffin-Muncher,

991
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:10,811
have fun playing
make-believe.

992
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:11,943
This?

993
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:13,647
This is all make-believe,
Brooke.

994
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,247
The reality is
you're an evil bitch

995
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,758
who's just as bad as
the worst criminal scum.

996
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,961
You wanna get real, Mindy?
In the real world, I win.

997
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,158
I go to an awesome college,
I marry a hot guy

998
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,428
and I make adorable

999
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,961
babies for my nanny to take care
of while we vacay in Paris.

1000
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:34,837
My life is gonna rock
and yours is gonna suck.

1001
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,138
And no matter
how slutty you dress,

1002
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,771
no boy is ever gonna wanna kiss
that hole you call a mouth.

1003
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:44,216
So why don't you spare us all the
whining and slit your wrists now?

1004
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,014
'Cause the only thing
that's gonna ruin my day

1005
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,885
is looking at your face
one more second.

1006
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,125
Told her.
Damn.

1007
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,024
What's that?
A ghetto cell phone?

1008
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:57,813
Gonna call for
help with a come-back?

1009
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:58,487
Hmm.

1010
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,732
Actually, my daddy bought this
from a disgruntled DARPA employee.

1011
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,864
You see, it was designed for crowd
control, but deemed too severe.

1012
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:10,001
It emits a pulse that creates
spontaneous nausea and diarrhea.

1013
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:12,644
He called it
"the sick stick."

1014
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,579
Either your daddy
got ripped off,

1015
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,981
or you're back in make-believe
land, sweetheart,

1016
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,646
because we feel fabulous.

1017
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,312
Not for long.

1018
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:32,024
Oh, my God!!

1019
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:36,167
You get away from me.
Please, you win.

1020
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,832
I don't wanna win. I just want to
make the world a better place.

1021
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,517
Dad?

1022
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,251
You home? Dad?

1023
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,512
Is this what you've been up to

1024
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,727
while I'm out working nights
saving for your college?

1025
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:08,132
You've been dressing up
and fighting people?

1026
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:11,069
There is blood on
these stick things.

1027
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,736
What are you doing in my room?

1028
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,708
I was looking for drugs.

1029
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,801
I was worried about you.

1030
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,072
Okay, good.
Now you can stop.

1031
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,978
No. Now I'm even
more worried.

1032
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,107
Jesus, Dave,
drugs would have been better.

1033
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,878
This is deranged.

1034
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,887
Whoa. Some people
do a lot worse.

1035
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,784
Oh, the people you hang outwith?
No.

1036
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,119
The people I hang out
with are superheroes.

1037
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,284
There is no such thing, Dave.

1038
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,226
This is the real world
with real consequences.

1039
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,628
When are you gonna grow up?

1040
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,393
If it means
turning into you, never.

1041
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,796
I don't wear the mask because
I'm ashamed of who I am.

1042
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,893
Not like you.

1043
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:44,901
What's that supposed to mean?

1044
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,306
If you're not at work,
you're here doing crunches.

1045
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:49,274
Why? So you can
look like someone else?

1046
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,574
Maybe get a few more years
of doing nothing?

1047
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,808
Your life has no meaning, Dad.

1048
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:55,577
When you're gone,
who's gonna notice?

1049
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,640
Where the hell are you going?

1050
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,812
Oh, uh, I'm leaving. That's
what you do when you grow up.

1051
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,927
Did he say why
he wanted to see me?

1052
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,695
When your Uncle Ralph
calls, I don't ask questions.

1053
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,133
Just the kid.

1054
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,433
Chris, just be cool
and you'll be fine.

1055
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,811
<b>Hey, how you doing?</b>

1056
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,180
Good, Uncle Ralph.

1057
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,948
Listen, Chrissy, things have been
tough all around since your dad,

1058
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,115
you know.

1059
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:39,115
Well, I been trying to get the
family back on track from in here.

1060
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,989
They record these things.

1061
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,462
I know, it's fine.

1062
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,190
The warden's a pal.
Now listen to me.

1063
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:46,733
It's okay to have a bit of fun,

1064
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,962
but you can't go hiring
a gang of heavy hitters.

1065
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,036
Javier should have told you.

1066
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:52,539
No, it doesn't matter.

1067
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:56,633
Uncle Ralph, I am gonna make
Kick-Ass pay for what he did to us.

1068
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,681
Chrissy, you need
to forget that punk.

1069
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:01,647
It's more important
that you stay out of this.

1070
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,986
You're not like me,
or your dad, you're, uh..

1071
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:07,148
Special.

1072
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,185
You can't tell me
what to do anymore.

1073
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:17,162
I know who I am now.

1074
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,324
Oh, yeah?

1075
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,727
And who's that?

1076
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:22,201
The Motherfucker.

1077
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:30,100
You think you're
the big bad guy, huh?

1078
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:35,044
Let me show you what
real evil looks like.

1079
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:45,954
Hello?

1080
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,554
Javier, what's going on?

1081
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,255
Chris, what's up?

1082
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,873
What are you doing
on Lou's phone, huh?

1083
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,797
<b>Drop yours in the toilet again?</b>

1084
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,096
Everything okay?

1085
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,420
Thank you for that I needed it.

1086
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,295
For what comes next.

1087
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,833
Don't be stupid, Chris.

1088
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:30,132
Just get out of town for a while.
Go to college or something.

1089
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:33,765
Why? You just taught me
everything I needed to know.

1090
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,641
Voila!!

1091
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:48,587
Presto and elegant, damn. Them
boys designed a very tasty logo.

1092
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,793
What's the matter, girl?
You hear something?

1093
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,766
Come on, let's go see.
Come on!!

1094
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,669
Anybody out here?

1095
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,935
I don't see anything.

1096
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,841
Gonna have to stay in there until
you calm down, you lunatic.

1097
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:21,486
I wonder what's bothering you.

1098
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,950
I know. Tonight you die.

1099
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,160
Ladies first.

1100
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:29,993
You will not shoot me.

1101
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:34,829
You are superhero. You help people.
You do not hurt them.

1102
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,704
That's supervillain territory.

1103
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,205
Or as I like to
call my little gang,

1104
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,706
the Toxic Mega-Cums.

1105
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,140
Hi.

1106
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:50,548
Yeah, like your head.

1107
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:02,755
Yay!!

1108
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:04,491
Ooh, it's gotta hurt!!

1109
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:20,504
I did my homework
on you, Colonel.

1110
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,510
You used to be
Sal Bertolini, didn't you?

1111
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:27,521
Did a few jobs for my dad back in the
day, before you got "born again."

1112
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:30,920
I used to hang with
a lot of losers.

1113
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:36,554
Is this how you thought you'd die, Sal?
Dressed like an idiot?

1114
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:40,092
Who are you supposed to be?

1115
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,033
I'm The Motherfucker!!

1116
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,538
And I'm here to end Kick-Ass.
Not just kill him.

1117
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:49,202
I am gonna shit on
everything that he loves.

1118
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,145
Let's trash this place, guys.

1119
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:01,384
"Miranda Swedlow"?

1120
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,992
Who's that, Sal? She one
of the whores on your team?

1121
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:23,638
Night Bitch all
snuggled up to Kick-Ass.

1122
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,179
Looks like our boy's
got a new hot pocket.

1123
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,149
Want me to kill his dog?

1124
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,346
The dog? Jesus Christ,
I'm not that evil.

1125
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,180
Cut the old man's head off.

1126
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,487
You guys hungry?
I'm starving. Come on.

1127
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,687
Pizza, can we get pizza?

1128
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:42,786
We're getting pizza.

1129
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,662
Don't worry, I kill you first.

1130
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,036
Justice For..

1131
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,662
ever.

1132
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,766
<b>A Brooklyn resident was found
decapitated last night.</b>

1133
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,840
<b>According to Twitter,
a man claiming to be</b>

1134
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,880
<b>the world's
first supervillain..</b>

1135
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:02,779
Hold you, no TV.
You're grounded, remember?

1136
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,508
Marcus, I know
I made you a promise,

1137
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:06,985
but I can't keep
being someone I'm not.

1138
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,886
When I see evil,
I have to stop it.

1139
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:12,221
Mindy, what you did to those girls
at school was unacceptable.

1140
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,329
You could have really hurt them.
You're right, I could have,

1141
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,294
but instead I sent them home
with tummy-aches.

1142
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,957
Boo-fucking-hoo.

1143
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:21,161
I don't get ii. This obsession that
you have with revenge is not healthy.

1144
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,134
If you don't let me
and the police do our jobs,

1145
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,073
there is gonna be nothing
that I can do for you.

1146
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,630
You're never gonna
have a normal life

1147
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,175
and you'll probably
end up like your father.

1148
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,972
Marcus, they cut
a guy's head off.

1149
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,979
Who else is going to stop them?

1150
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,139
Kick-Ass? You?

1151
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:37,345
You go to your room
and do your homework.

1152
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,088
Now!!

1153
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,702
Hey, guys, we're signing a
sympathy card for the Colonel's sister.

1154
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:59,705
You wanna go 5 bucks each so we
can send flowers from the team?

1155
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,402
Did you guys see The
Motherfuckers Twitter page?

1156
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,604
Who is this guy? And what's
his problem with us?

1157
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,375
I don't know, but he has got
some elephant-sized balls.

1158
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:11,076
He's been bragging on the web about
what they did to the Colonel.

1159
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,584
Can that be traced?

1160
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,417
I tried.
His IP address is masked.

1161
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:18,226
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna organize a fight.

1162
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:20,555
There are a lot of guys online who
said they're in if we need them.

1163
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:22,722
Are you kidding me?
This isn't West Side Story.

1164
01:05:22,786 --> 01:05:24,697
We didn't join up
to be in a gang.

1165
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,154
We did this so
we could help people.

1166
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,361
Shannon!! right. We need to
leave this to the cops.

1167
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,960
We better start
walking in pairs.

1168
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,973
Motherfuckers tweeted that the
Colonel was just the beginning.

1169
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:35,974
Anybody seen Night Bitch?

1170
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,051
Are you sure
she's on that team?

1171
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:53,288
Stupid gash posted on her superhero
page that shes dating Kick-Ass.

1172
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,453
So, yeah, I'm damn sure.

1173
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:00,765
Hello, Night Bitch!!

1174
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:02,098
Hey.

1175
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,996
Oh, she wants to take
the party upstairs.

1176
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,268
We're gonna have a party.

1177
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:10,241
She closed the door.

1178
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,615
Don't worry, darling,
I'm not gonna kill you.

1179
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,311
I want you to give a message
to your boyfriend.

1180
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,780
Come on, wriggly.

1181
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,085
Let go!!

1182
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,957
You're done banging superheroes, baby.

1183
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,690
It's time to see what
evil dick feels like.

1184
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:39,702
Shit.

1185
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,671
What's wrong?

1186
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,941
What are you doing?

1187
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,142
Come on!!

1188
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:54,452
God, okay, I'm just..
I'm not in the mood.

1189
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:56,683
I guess evil dick feels limp.

1190
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,783
Hurt her. Bad!!

1191
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,356
Cops are coming.

1192
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:06,900
Leave it to Mother Russia. She
makes 10 times what we do.

1193
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,732
Fifty thousand a week.
Plus expenses.

1194
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:13,634
Hey, watch out!!

1195
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:23,982
Wow!!

1196
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,653
Reverse it!! Reverse it!!

1197
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,905
Don't move!! Freeze!!

1198
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,343
Fifty thousand.
She's worth it'

1199
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:05,921
Whoa, whoa!!
Why are they backing up?

1200
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,858
Why is there a lawnmower
on the trunk?

1201
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:12,760
Wow!!

1202
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,403
We need back-up,
eight men down.

1203
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:24,273
I think you mean 10.

1204
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,820
Let's bounce!! Put the word out
I'm building an evil army.

1205
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:40,224
All psychopaths
and ex-cons welcome.

1206
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:43,559
I don't think you're gonna have a
problem when people hear about this.

1207
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:50,166
They just disappeared?

1208
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,971
All they have to do is
take off their masks,

1209
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:54,473
no one's gonna recognize them once
they're back in their street clothes.

1210
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,441
Your attention, please!!

1211
01:08:56,566 --> 01:09:00,912
Feds traced the IP addresses for
all those other costumed freaks.

1212
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:02,483
We got every law
enforcement agency

1213
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,779
in the state working
to hit them at once!!

1214
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,648
Why is Kick-Ass
on this list?

1215
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:07,778
His crew does
community service.

1216
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,016
I don't give a shit. Anyone wearing
a mask is getting detained.

1217
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:13,526
We're putting an end
to this tonight!!

1218
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,587
<b>A lot of people said the cops
were too heavy-handed that night.</b>

1219
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,460
<b>But you gotta put it
into context.</b>

1220
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,334
<b>The police didn't mind
our real life superhero stuff</b>

1221
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:25,838
<b>as long as we were
picking up litter</b>

1222
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,635
<b>or helping old ladies
cross the street.</b>

1223
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:31,868
<b>But suddenly it was serious.</b>

1224
01:09:32,435 --> 01:09:36,281
<b>Suddenly we represented everything
that was wrong with society.</b>

1225
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:38,114
Freeze!!

1226
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:42,151
<b>Dad had warned me that the real
world had real consequences.</b>

1227
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:45,889
<b>As they pulled up, he must have been
feeling pretty damn vindicated.</b>

1228
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:51,162
Oh, shit, Dave.
What have you done?

1229
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,728
Police, open up.

1230
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:02,535
Hey.

1231
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:03,633
Hi.

1232
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,804
Uh, uh, it's me, Kick-Ass.

1233
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:10,978
Wow.

1234
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,882
You're actually pretty cute
under that mask.

1235
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,325
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

1236
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,883
Don't be.

1237
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,659
It's my own fault.

1238
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:25,425
We're gonna find these
assholes and make this right.

1239
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,228
What's the point?

1240
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,066
I mean,
we're really superheroes

1241
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,833
about as much as
we're really dating.

1242
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:36,036
We don't even know
each others names.

1243
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,741
I think it's time to get
back to the real world.

1244
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,608
I thought we were trying
to make it a better place.

1245
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,009
Then why is it worse?

1246
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,880
<b>Maybe Night Bitch was right,</b>

1247
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,349
<b>which means Dad was, too.</b>

1248
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,354
<b>I mean, things had
gotten out of hand.</b>

1249
01:10:57,854 --> 01:11:00,232
<b>Maybe it was time for me to
stop crashing at Marty's</b>

1250
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,200
<b>and start apologizing.</b>

1251
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,072
Dad?

1252
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,545
Whoa, whoa.
That's my dad.

1253
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:17,150
Your dad's Kick-Ass?
What?

1254
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,878
Yeah, he just gave himself up.

1255
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,386
You don't understand. He's
doing this to protect me.

1256
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:24,753
Dad!!

1257
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:26,718
Dad!!

1258
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,437
<b>Mindy?</b>
Dave?

1259
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:47,169
I need your help.
My dad's been arrested.

1260
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,309
They think he's Kick-Ass.
Can you talk to Marcus?

1261
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,248
I'm grounded.
So?

1262
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,183
So that means
I can't get involved.

1263
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,914
<b>Look. Wait a second.
I wish I could help.</b>

1264
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,318
Mindy!!
Are you on the phone?

1265
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,517
Look, I gotta go, okay?

1266
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,287
<b>I'm sorry, Dave.</b>

1267
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,487
Mindy, wait, wait.

1268
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:15,803
<b>Hey, what the hell
were you thinking?</b>

1269
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:17,843
Yeah, I could ask you
the same thing.

1270
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,971
I can't believe
you lied to them.

1271
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:21,674
I wasn't gonna do nothing
while you went to jail.

1272
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:25,014
I chose this. You should let
me deal with the consequences.

1273
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,552
I thought you
wanted me to grow up.

1274
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,851
Yeah? When you get a kid of your
own one day, you'll understand.

1275
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:30,947
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

1276
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,118
No. Hey..
It'll just make things worse.

1277
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:35,193
Look, I spoke to my attorney.

1278
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,127
He said they gotta
let me out by tomorrow.

1279
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,664
No actual crime was committed.

1280
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,795
There are people out there
who wanna kill Kick-Ass.

1281
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:48,139
Well, the cops are out
there looking for them,

1282
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:52,043
so the safest place for Kick-Ass
is right here, locked away.

1283
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:54,512
I don't know how you got
into all this shit, but

1284
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:58,814
you gotta promise me you will never
dress up in that outfit again.

1285
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:00,812
Do you hear me?

1286
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:09,753
I promise.

1287
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,338
This evil lair owns!!

1288
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,499
Do people still
say that, "own"?

1289
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,408
Yeah, of course.

1290
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,606
Your shark.
Somethings wrong.

1291
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,257
Think you used
the wrong kind of water.

1292
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,510
What the hell, Eyal?

1293
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,916
Ifs fine, Chris. They're supposed
to lie at the bottom of the tank.

1294
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:34,784
It's just their way of,
how you say,

1295
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,117
settling into
their environment.

1296
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,021
Don't screw me on this, okay?

1297
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,252
You said we'd be
ready in two days,

1298
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:40,588
we don't even have
a men's room yet.

1299
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:41,923
Don't worry.

1300
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:43,929
What's with the bags of shit?

1301
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,795
It's fertilizer for the bombs.

1302
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:49,267
You're not a supervillain if you don't
have a plan to destroy the city.

1303
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,770
It will not work.
You need a chemical kind.

1304
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:55,206
Do I have to do everything myself?
Just fix it!!

1305
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:59,210
You must relax. Everything
is going as planned.

1306
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:01,782
Mmm, no. No.
Except it's not, okay?

1307
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:04,880
That sad sack
is not Kick-Ass.

1308
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,387
I've seen Kick-Ass,
he's like my age.

1309
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,389
Guy's old enough
to be his father.

1310
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,890
No shit, right.

1311
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,891
I'm sorry, who are you?

1312
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:17,156
I, uh, volunteered for your
evil army, like the others.

1313
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,733
Right. I appreciate that.
Thanks for joining the cause.

1314
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:24,337
This is the VIP area
for the core group.

1315
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,134
I just thought it was
funny you said that.

1316
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,731
Because he is
Kick-Ass, father.

1317
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:29,842
Who?

1318
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,003
Mr. Lizewski.
He's Kick-Ass, dad.

1319
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:35,078
Shut up!!

1320
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,978
Yeah. You're not
gonna tell anyone, are you?

1321
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:39,417
No.

1322
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:41,982
But you, my friend,
have just earned

1323
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:44,615
life-time access
to my VIP area.

1324
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,589
Go take a little seat.

1325
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,889
Hey, get the kid a Frappuccino,

1326
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,590
then put his little
punk ass back to work.

1327
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,364
Okay.

1328
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,603
Come on.

1329
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,676
Can I help you?

1330
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:16,882
The Motherfucker wants us
to take a picture with you.

1331
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,717
It helps that my dad
is a really good lawyer.

1332
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,481
Because I
don't think my beautiful ass

1333
01:15:21,484 --> 01:15:23,623
would last too long in prison.

1334
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,695
Whoa, that's weird. Chris
D'Amico just texted me a picture.

1335
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:30,861
Red Mist? Whatever
happened to that guy?

1336
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:39,045
MARTY; What is it?

1337
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:40,538
Dude, what's wrong?

1338
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,013
What is it?

1339
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:03,598
<b>The next few days
passed in a fog.</b>

1340
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:08,873
<b>It didn't matter that I told
the police about Chris,</b>

1341
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,200
<b>they couldn't find him.</b>

1342
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:14,842
<b>The cops did show up
at Dad's funeral,</b>

1343
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:16,410
<b>not out of respect,</b>

1344
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,714
<b>but because they were scared
something would happen.</b>

1345
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,548
<b>My dad was a decent man.</b>

1346
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,683
<b>All he ever did was try
and give me a good life,</b>

1347
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:28,958
<b>and I told him no one would
notice when he was gone.</b>

1348
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,861
I love you, pal.

1349
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,728
I love you, too, Dad.

1350
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:42,975
You guys came.

1351
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:46,911
We'd love to help you track down
this Chris D'Amico d-bag, but

1352
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:49,314
we just got out on parole.

1353
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:50,816
No, that's fine.

1354
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,409
I'm not looking for revenge.

1355
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:56,989
Last thing I promised my dad was
that I was gonna give this up.

1356
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,586
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

1357
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,422
But you started this.

1358
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:03,820
Now I'm ending it.

1359
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:17,340
Dave, I'm so sorry. Do you
hate me for not helping?

1360
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,468
No, not even a little bit.

1361
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,782
You were right.
You gave it up.

1362
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:27,682
If I had, too, my dad
would still be alive.

1363
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:32,587
The only person
I blame is myself.

1364
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:47,968
Let's do this!!

1365
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:51,834
Get down!!

1366
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:57,783
Mindy!!

1367
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:01,045
Spread out!!

1368
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,223
Keep your head down!!

1369
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,035
Come on!!

1370
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:27,373
Whoa, whoa, whoa!!

1371
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,248
Get him!!

1372
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,910
Get that van over here!!

1373
01:18:35,311 --> 01:18:36,813
Hurry up!!

1374
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,421
Mindy?

1375
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,892
Mindy!!

1376
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,167
Mindy?

1377
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,339
You gotta put this on.

1378
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,743
I'm not gonna do it.

1379
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:11,421
There's nothing left you can
do to hurt me.

1380
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,428
You wanna bet?

1381
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:19,524
Whoa!! Whoa!!

1382
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:23,125
Game on, cocksuckers!!

1383
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,136
There's a girl on the roof!!

1384
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:44,079
She's still up there!!

1385
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,601
I think I got her!!
Go check!!

1386
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:13,913
Get out there!!

1387
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,629
Come on!!
Move your head.

1388
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:01,824
Pull over, pube-face.

1389
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,800
We know Chris D'Amico is The Motherfucker.
Where is he hiding?

1390
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,865
Eat a dick.

1391
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:11,171
You're gonna eat yours
if you don't start talking.

1392
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:13,474
Go ahead and shoot me,
you little bitch.

1393
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,141
There's nothing you can do that
would make me talk.

1394
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:20,810
Look, hold on. I can't do this right now.
It's my dad's funeral.

1395
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,880
Dave, your father loved you.

1396
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:30,426
Just like my daddy loved me. And
I know it hurts, but maybe,

1397
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:34,499
maybe that's the real meaning
of being a superhero.

1398
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:38,364
Is taking that pain and turning
it into something good.

1399
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:40,702
Something right.

1400
01:21:41,864 --> 01:21:43,901
Remember what you told me?

1401
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:47,607
This is your life.
You've gotta live it.

1402
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:53,084
Now help me find some pliers. I'm
gonna make this guy eat his own dick.

1403
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:55,215
Seriously?

1404
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,716
<b>- Hello?
- Marcus?</b>

1405
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,850
Mindy. What's going on?
Are you okay?

1406
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:02,918
<b>I'm fine.</b>

1407
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:05,190
We know where
The Motherfucker's hiding.

1408
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,928
He's recruiting an army of supervillains
and making homemade bombs.

1409
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,902
<b>Marcus, he wants to
burn the city down.</b>

1410
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,062
You promised me.

1411
01:22:11,193 --> 01:22:16,472
Know you see me as this little
girl, but I'm not and I never was.

1412
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,271
<b>You're right.</b>

1413
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:20,574
<b>Daddy did take
my childhood away,</b>

1414
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:22,411
<b>but I'm not so sure
that was a bad thing.</b>

1415
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:24,417
Marcus, he gave me a gift,

1416
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:26,919
a gift that I can't escape
no matter how hard I try.

1417
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:29,752
<b>And I don't need to spend the
next four years of my life</b>

1418
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:31,223
<b>trying to figure out who I am</b>

1419
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,283
because I already know.

1420
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,758
I'm Hit Girl.

1421
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:45,995
I posted the address. Do
you think they'll show?

1422
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,301
Chris has an army.

1423
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:49,967
These real life super dweebs

1424
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,409
have been waiting their whole
lives for a call like this.

1425
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:04,153
Are you okay?

1426
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:06,283
What? Yeah, no..
I'm fine.

1427
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:07,852
Here.

1428
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:09,853
Take this.

1429
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:12,688
"Last resort"
really isn't my style.

1430
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:17,494
Dave, this isn't a comic book. Real
people are going to die tonight.

1431
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:20,133
My daddy was prepared
for anything.

1432
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:22,105
Are you?

1433
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:28,809
Yeah.

1434
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:31,982
I am.

1435
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,795
They should be back by now!!

1436
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,852
It's definitely dead.

1437
01:23:43,952 --> 01:23:47,195
Says on the Internet you're supposed
to keep them in fresh water.

1438
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:50,998
It is just hungry.
We must feed it.

1439
01:23:51,994 --> 01:23:53,974
Why are you looking at me?

1440
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,804
We gotta get this shit started.

1441
01:23:56,298 --> 01:24:00,371
<b>Oh, yeah. Have I got
a show for you bitches!!</b>

1442
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,045
Motherfucker, Motherfucker..

1443
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,821
<b>All right, party people!!</b>

1444
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,820
<b>We are gonna
kill Kick-Ass,</b>

1445
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:18,660
<b>the very first superhero,
together.</b>

1446
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:23,760
<b>We are gonna cut him up into little
pieces, feed that shit to MC Shark</b>

1447
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:27,102
<b>and post it all over YouTube.
For real!!</b>

1448
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:30,108
He's kidding, right?

1449
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:31,438
Motherfucker don't kid.

1450
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:35,174
<b>That's not it. I'm gonna give
each and every one of you</b>

1451
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,841
<b>party favor fertilizer bombs!!</b>

1452
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,510
<b>And we are gonna
get our riot on!!</b>

1453
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,521
<b>That's what it
means to be evil.</b>

1454
01:24:41,677 --> 01:24:44,851
<b>We, my friends,
are the real 1%,</b>

1455
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:48,859
<b>and tonight we are gonna fuck
this city up or my name is not..</b>

1456
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,954
Chris D'Amico!!

1457
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,359
<b>That is not my name!!</b>

1458
01:24:56,725 --> 01:25:00,434
No, you're right. Your
new name's Little Bitch.

1459
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:06,274
<b>Oh, this is perfect.</b>

1460
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:09,875
<b>Are you really that stupid?</b>

1461
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:15,249
<b>There's two of you
and a whole army of us.</b>

1462
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:18,985
<b>Do you really have
such a hard-on to die?</b>

1463
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,723
MINDY; No.

1464
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:24,297
That's why we
brought our friends.

1465
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:58,261
What's the matter, Chris?
Shit hit your shorts?

1466
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:02,863
Yeah, and I'm gonna wipe
my ass with your face.

1467
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:07,770
You're gonna pay for
what you did to my dad.

1468
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:12,101
Your dad? You blew up
my dad with a bazooka.

1469
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,948
Oh!!

1470
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,041
Are you ready to die,
little girl?

1471
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:52,343
I might be if I have to keep looking
at that shit-stain you call a face.

1472
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,151
Chris!!

1473
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:03,050
Hold him down. I wanna see
what his guts look like.

1474
01:28:07,249 --> 01:28:08,887
That's enough from you boys!!

1475
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:14,890
Nicely done, sweetheart.

1476
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:24,637
That all you got?

1477
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:27,509
No, I got my lethal
zero G device.

1478
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:28,637
Bullshit.

1479
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:31,512
No shit.

1480
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:48,667
Are you okay?

1481
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:53,600
Yeah. Thanks.
Ass Kicker.

1482
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:57,368
Nice.

1483
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:06,839
Jesus, you are such a pussy.

1484
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:09,676
What is the point of wearing a mask
if you can't do what you want?

1485
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,252
We want to do good.

1486
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,291
No, people want
to win the lottery.

1487
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:24,587
People want to fuck
Scarlett Johansson.

1488
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:38,772
You think you can kill me
with little needle?

1489
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,454
That's not what it's for.

1490
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,062
It's called adrenaline, bitch.

1491
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:08,666
What was that, some cheap shot?

1492
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,401
That was for the Colonel.

1493
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:14,769
Ahh!!

1494
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,306
That's for Night Bitch.

1495
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:27,583
And that's for my dad.

1496
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:05,863
What the hell are you doing?

1497
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:07,789
Saving your whiny ass!!

1498
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:08,857
No!!

1499
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:12,460
I won't let you have this.
I'd rather die!!

1500
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:16,634
What is wrong with you, dude? This
is not a comic book, it's real life!!

1501
01:32:16,965 --> 01:32:20,310
When you're dead, it's done.
There's no sequel.

1502
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:25,178
You made this real. You started it!!
And I'm gonna finish ii.

1503
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,885
I'll be immortal'
like an evil Jesus.

1504
01:32:39,354 --> 01:32:40,355
Wait!!

1505
01:32:52,934 --> 01:32:55,244
I'm alive.

1506
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,678
Dave, I'm so sorry.

1507
01:33:05,947 --> 01:33:08,223
<b>The feeling was indescribable.</b>

1508
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:10,890
<b>Chris D'Amico, dead.</b>

1509
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:15,364
<b>His wannabe supervillains,
defeated.</b>

1510
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:19,735
<b>But did we make
the world a better place?</b>

1511
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:25,371
<b>Or did we just finish something that
began when I first put on this mask?</b>

1512
01:33:28,203 --> 01:33:30,205
The cops are coming.

1513
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:32,374
They'll take
care of the bad guys.

1514
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,387
We better skedaddle
before they get here.

1515
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:36,978
We did it.

1516
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:38,079
Fuck, yeah.

1517
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:39,887
Hey, language.

1518
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:44,887
You're right, if we're gonna dress like
heroes, we should act like heroes.

1519
01:33:45,887 --> 01:33:48,060
He'd be proud of you, Dave.

1520
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:50,930
He'd be proud of all of us.

1521
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:55,273
You know we can never
do this again, right?

1522
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,641
It's over.

1523
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:04,405
One last time.
Come on.

1524
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:11,654
What do you say,
Hit Girl? Are you in?

1525
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:15,257
Why the hell not?

1526
01:34:17,085 --> 01:34:19,087
Justice Forever!!

1527
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:33,608
Thanks for the ride.

1528
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:36,139
I'll see you at school.

1529
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:40,112
I'm leaving New York, Dave.

1530
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:44,212
I can't go home. I can't put
Marcus in that position.

1531
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:47,449
Why? He won't arrest you.
You just saved the city.

1532
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:50,619
Yeah, well, I also killed
six guys with a cop's gun.

1533
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:53,130
Vigilantes don't
get a free pass.

1534
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:57,395
You can't go.
People need you.

1535
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,367
They've got you now.
Mindy..

1536
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,533
I'm not like you.

1537
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:08,136
You don't have to be a bad-ass
to be a superhero, Dave.

1538
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:12,310
You just have to be brave.

1539
01:35:24,252 --> 01:35:25,356
What was that?

1540
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:30,502
That was my first kiss.

1541
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,830
Be nice or I'll rip your <b>ass
</b> out through your mouth.

1542
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,078
<b>When Mindy left,</b>

1543
01:35:44,772 --> 01:35:48,117
<b>that's when I finally understood
where my life was going.</b>

1544
01:35:49,177 --> 01:35:51,748
<b>Just like it had to
eventually happen,</b>

1545
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:54,918
<b>that real people would
try to be superheroes.</b>

1546
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:58,258
<b>Eventually it had to end, too.</b>

1547
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:18,614
<b>Superheroes can't exist in
the real world for a reason.</b>

1548
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:22,745
<b>It's because the real
world needs real heroes.</b>

1549
01:36:23,478 --> 01:36:26,755
<b>And not some punk in a
wet-suit playing dress-up,</b>

1550
01:36:27,315 --> 01:36:31,764
<b>but a genuine bad-ass
who can really kick ass.</b>

1551
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:19,675
<b>Hello?</b>

1552
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,971
<b>Please. Don't go.</b>

1553
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,340
<b>Don't go.</b>

1554
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:28,482
Is anybody there?

1555
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:32,989
Hello?

1556
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:39,597
Some help, please?

1557
01:42:39,754 --> 01:42:43,361
A shark bit my fucking dick off
and I can't get some water?
