Bad Teacher

1
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:47,062
(Movie Corner)

2
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:58,687
Bad Teacher

3
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:10,086
Alright folks, can we all settle down for a second?

4
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:14,215
Oops!! I know that you... hey you settle down.

5
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,259
C'mon everybody settle down

6
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,389
Sandy... c'mon... now now guys its is not
a time to make silly jokes...

7
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:23,726
its a time for a little bit of talking before
we really get to the important part.

8
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:26,269
Here we go, well its been another great year here at JAMS.

9
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,397
Who can forget Mr. Pinkus's haunted classroom.

10
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:30,482
Thank you Sandy, for that.

11
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:33,651
And I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

12
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:36,195
Or the wild success of

13
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:40,159
the book drive for womens prison
which Mrs. Pathacheks class sponsored.

14
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:46,707
Thank u Beth, but as summer droves upon us, its
time not only to say goodbye to another school year

15
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,627
but sadly also to say goodbye
to one of our faculty members.

16
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,215
Yes, Elizabeth... is Elizabeth Halsey here?
There she is...

17
00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:00,346
Elizabeth can you come on up here?
Yes that’s appropriate applause, I think.

18
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:06,101
Elizabeth, even though you are
only with us for one short year...

19
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:11,439
Please know that we will always
consider you part of the JAMS family.

20
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,360
And we got you a little something.

21
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:17,070
Oh!! Thank you.

22
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,908
Wow... almost $40, thank you.

23
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,785
You're very welcome, speech??

24
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:28,999
Ok well, I'm really terrible at this types of thing
so, I'll make it quick.

25
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,335
Ah, I know I've only been here a year,
but there's so much I will miss.

26
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:35,422
My students, probably most.

27
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:45,349
And I wish that I had gotten to know
all of you better.

28
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:55,109
But, between four classes and planning a wedding
my plate was full

29
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,904
still, I know that our students are
in good hands.

30
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,158
And even though I'll never teach again professionally.

31
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:10,165
I've realised that I don't need a blackboard or
a classroom to set an example.

32
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,770
Adios, bitches!!

33
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:44,283
Baby doll...
I'm home.

34
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,784
In here...

35
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,912
Get yourself hot coz I'm gonna suck
your dick like I'm mad at it.

36
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:54,918
Oh! Look, your moms here.
Hi Mom, what a fun surprise.

37
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:58,422
Suitcases, honey are we going on a trip?

38
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:01,758
Aah... Elizabeth, we need to talk.
Sure.

39
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,386
I'm starting to think that maybe we need to take a break.

40
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:06,305
Forever...

41
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:10,017
-Mom!! Tell her what the
accountant said. -Mom!

42
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:14,438
Steven said that you
spend $16,000 last month.

43
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,440
He thinks you're bad news.
I know women like you.

44
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,404
Damn it Mom! I told you I could handle this.
I just want to ask her something.

45
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:27,659
You truly love my son?
I love him so much it hurts.

46
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:32,539
Alright then, when is his birthday?
Mom...

47
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:36,585
I'm not... you know... that is just
offensive that you would even ask me that.

48
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,254
It's today...

49
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:47,680
I know...
That’s why I got you this okay

50
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,306
honey, happy birthday

51
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:51,391
Austin Market?

52
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:57,518
Okay fine, I'll sign the prenup.

53
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,687
It's over, Elizabeth.

54
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:01,857
Mark, I'm pregnant.

55
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,692
- Bullshit.
- No you're not.

56
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,402
Okay fine, I'm not actually pregnant.

57
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:08,322
You know what, I'm starting to wonder...

58
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:12,200
whether this is always been about the money.
You never loved me.

59
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:13,868
I don't love you?

60
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:16,662
I have been listening to you
whining about opera for the last year.

61
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:22,960
Okay, If the younger generation doesn't get into opera
then guess what? No more opera!

62
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,629
An art form just has died.

63
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,007
If opera goes away, we're fucked.

64
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:30,135
I want my ring back.

65
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:32,888
What am I supposed to do? Huh?
Where am I supposed to go?

66
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,391
3 MONTHS LATER

67
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:12,845
There she is, Elizabeth Halsey.
Wooooo...

68
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:17,516
I am so excited we're gonna be across-the-hall mates.

69
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:21,603
But I'm so sad..it's because
your relationship ended.

70
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:24,480
Who are you again?
Amy Squirrel.

71
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:28,610
Squirrel?
Yeah, you know.

72
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:36,786
Don't worry, you were... kind of a long bolf last year
and so... busy planning the... wedding

73
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:40,664
I found him in bed with somebody else.
Oh my Gosh.

74
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:44,293
He was with another man.
Shut the front door!

75
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:54,674
Look..I know you kinda skated by last year
doing the bare minimum thing

76
00:07:54,841 --> 00:08:01,264
but I just wanna say, now you're back, I just know
you are gonna get your teaching on

77
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,562
I thought the teachers were supposed
to get the apples

78
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:13,109
well, I think the students teach me
at least as much as I teach them.

79
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:18,406
That's just something I say sometimes.
Stupid.

80
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:37,926
Uh sorry..I just wanted to know
if you wanted to grab some lunch

81
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:42,014
I'm kind of in the middle of something, Lynn.
My treat.

82
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,474
You know, Lynn
when I first started teaching

83
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,769
I thought that I was doing it
for all the right reasons.

84
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,856
Shorter hours, summers off,
no account credibility...

85
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:54,443
oh, I love my summers...
fresh corn... mmmm

86
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,864
from now on, my full time job is finding
a guy who's gonna take care of me

87
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,116
God I pray for that.

88
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:04,202
You know I spent my entire summer
hanging out at bars near where the Bulls practice.

89
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:09,499
Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs
But those guys are not looking to settle down

90
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,671
I mean.. they all wear condoms..then, they take
the condoms with them, that’s how paranoid they are

91
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,675
like its so easy to get pregnant from
some dude nutting into a condom

92
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:24,556
yeaa...ugh!! you're gonna find someone great
Right?

93
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:31,438
I've been thinking about it a lot, I'm like an 8,
8 and a half..but if I got a new pair of tits.. right?

94
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,774
You!!..don't wanna do that,
you're already so pretty.

95
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:40,280
You have no idea how difficult it is to
compete against these Barbie doll types

96
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:48,121
yea..that's true, we're not getting any younger
yea..we should finish up.

97
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,958
Wally's got that big orientation in
the auditorium.

98
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,754
Yea, I'm not gonna hear that.
Oh... it's mandatory.

99
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:02,218
I'll probably won't go either.

100
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:08,057
Huh... no I might, I probably
going to sit in the back, maybe leave early

101
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:13,772
maybe stay the end half... play by Yer
or just stay the end.

102
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,986
Okay... oh!! this was fun, huh?

103
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:05,454
Welcome to Air 7th Grade Social Studies
I'll be your captain, Miss Squirrel.

104
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:12,503
Crews announce tour for the world geography through current
events, we may have a way over in civics, so buckle up

105
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:16,549
cause its gonna be a crazy ride.

106
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:23,347
The photographer who was like... so nice
he made me feel like really really comfortable

107
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:26,267
I might get flown to Kansas City
for their Fashion Week

108
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:31,188
Kansas City.
Stalk much?

109
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:35,359
Bhuhhrr!!
Loser...

110
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,632
Hi, I'm Sasha Abernathy,
My mother baked this cookies for you..

111
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:02,094
Just leave them on the desk...

112
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,684
You need something?

113
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:14,815
Anyone seen Stand and Deliver?
Show hands...

114
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:20,488
...you kidding me?
Edward James Olmos?

115
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,741
Lew Diamond Phillips?

116
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:30,080
Well, alright... you... and you
grab the TV and roll it up front

117
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:33,583
we're watching a movie on the first day?
I think its awesome.

118
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,001
You rock!

119
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:41,508
These cookies suck

120
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,901
incoming...

121
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:10,245
Elizabeth
Hey, Russell

122
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:15,582
Russell Gettis, gym teacher
We did busted together last spring.

123
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:20,005
Yea. So, I heard about the whole
engagement thing... that blows.

124
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:25,010
Know I walked in on him trying to fuck his dog?
Peanut butter everywhere

125
00:14:25,218 --> 00:14:28,096
that’s gross...
anyway...

126
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:32,892
hey, uh.. may be too soon, but
you wanna like..grab a bite or something sometime

127
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,853
you still a gym teacher?
I am, yea

128
00:14:35,854 --> 00:14:37,522
then No

129
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:41,151
I don't date coworkers.
I wont tell anyone

130
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:47,032
I also said no...
Okay cool, well its been awesome

131
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:51,494
something's got a
case of a sleepyss.

132
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:54,289
What?
Did you see the col-saw of education?

133
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:58,960
Yea, one kid ...hit the
other kid with some col-saw...

134
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:02,464
You weren’t at the orientation the other day.. okay!

135
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:06,551
Boy, Elizabeth...
You missed a boat load of stuff

136
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:12,515
anyways, at the orientation I suggested
a new system for supervising lunch

137
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:15,060
it's a quadrant system

138
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:19,689
I tell you what... why don't you just
send me memo and if I have any questions, I'll find you.

139
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:24,109
Oh! Ooh! Yeah
Meant to ask...

140
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,865
Did I hear you were showing a movie this
morning on the first day of school?

141
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,034
How do I know what you heard?

142
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:33,952
Listen, I don't wanna tell you
how to run your class but...

143
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:36,998
Maybe it might be fun to try
some icebreakers...

144
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:41,336
Like telephone charades,
or this string game...

145
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:46,549
Are we gonna have a problem,
me and you?

146
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:54,140
No, eli... if I gave you that impression
well... ah!... I'm so sorry

147
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:59,896
because... actually I was really hoping we could be
more than just across the hall mates

148
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:02,899
I don't know what you heard
but I don't need muff pie(vagina)

149
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:09,072
No, of course not
I don't even know what that is... I...

150
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:14,869
Just meant friends.
Tell you what, friend... I've gotta get going, cover me

151
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:19,790
Elizabeth, lunch isn’t for
another seven... minutes...

152
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,751
who’s gonna watch your quadrant?

153
00:16:30,844 --> 00:16:34,055
Hi, there... you look like Losty MC Losterson...

154
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:37,726
I know right?
Can you tell me where room 107 is?

155
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,688
I'll take you there.
Oh. You don't have to do that.

156
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,565
Oh! Stop it, be my pleasure.

157
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:46,276
Scott Delacorte.
Elizabeth Halsey.

158
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:48,486
I am the new sub.
Welcome welcome.

159
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:52,282
Thank you.
- Is that Jaeger-LeCoultre?

160
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:53,408
Good eye

161
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,744
thanks, I love men's watches, its kind of a hobby

162
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:58,913
you know sometimes I get self-conscious about it but...

163
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,334
My grandfather made it, so...
Oh your grandfather designs watches?

164
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,254
The family business, yea my mothers
maiden name is lecoultre

165
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:13,094
shut up! So did you and your wife just moved to town?
I'm not married

166
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:16,765
I actually just got out of a relationship.
Catherine

167
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:21,269
its been a year, she's still
the wallpaper on my phone

168
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:27,025
she has such a big heart.
Looks like enormous.

169
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:35,575
As you can see the weight is evenly
distributed and there is minimal scar...

170
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,411
Dr. Vogel, best hands in Chicago.

171
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,707
May I?
Absolutely, take em' for a spin

172
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:51,132
God! Wow! Yea... these are amazing.
Thank you.

173
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:54,969
And the nipples... oh...
I know

174
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,806
I'll take two

175
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:07,648
the total is $9300 for the surgery,
plus one night stay at our facility.

176
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:08,942
How would you like to pay?

177
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:12,653
That’s absurd... I'm a teacher
not a drug dealer.

178
00:18:12,654 --> 00:18:19,411
We accept all major credit cards.
Yeah well... my credit situation is little... complicated

179
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:23,665
I'm sorry, but if you cant pay,
then I can't schedule the appointment

180
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:50,882
I'm rooming with a guy I met on craigslist
all I'm asking you for is 10,000 dollars

181
00:18:51,383 --> 00:18:56,388
you owe me for breaking off the engagement
you know how humiliating that was?

182
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:04,980
Lover... lover look, I don't wanna fight...
Its only $ 10,000... it would mean the world to me.

183
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:09,860
Lover... are you there?!!

184
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:13,989
Fucking troll.
Did you call my name?

185
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:19,661
No, I said fucking troll.
Oh, I thought you said Kirk.

186
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:25,208
Do you have 10 grand?
Nope.

187
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,839
And also I might be a little short on
rent this month, like a lot short.

188
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:37,763
This might help. Wanna get wasted?
Uh... Yea...

189
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,390
Cool, see ya.

190
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:48,522
We are in a state of emergency, and my word is law
There is only one boss in this place, and that's me.

191
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:50,901
The HNIC.

192
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:57,115
Alright... We'll pick this up again tomorrow.

193
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:01,661
Can I help you?

194
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:16,134
What?
I am the student leader for the trip to Springfield.

195
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:19,470
Shocker!
We're having our car wash this weekend.

196
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,056
If you're around, maybe we could
wash your car.

197
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,684
The Springfield trip is the best part of 7th grade...

198
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,395
last year's car wash raised 6000 dollars

199
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,150
bringing these magazines to school is not the
way you are going to make friends, those 8th Grade boys...

200
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,861
Are just using you

201
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,572
so I go now?
Yes, you go now.

202
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,367
But if I see these again,
I'm gonna call your parents.

203
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,036
Do you understand?

204
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,665
Go to class.

205
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:55,671
Hey hey... Hey!! go to class.

206
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,885
Another exciting day in the Principal's office.

207
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,762
Do you have a second?

208
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:10,059
Uhh yeah. Oh! You know what I wanna talk to you too, did I
hear that right, that you were showing movies all last week?

209
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,438
Hmm... some clips, maybe.

210
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,692
But you know in a lot of ways
I think that movies are the new books.

211
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:31,331
Is this new?
I love it.

212
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,252
You know, I've always said that
dolphins are the humans of the sea

213
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,923
I have a bumper sticker that says that.
No way?

214
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,926
I'm not kidding.
It's on my car.

215
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,305
Come on...

216
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,308
Hold on a sec...

217
00:21:55,606 --> 00:22:00,486
His name is Simon and he lives
in the Cayman Islands...

218
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:05,240
With his brother, Ajack.

219
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,704
What a great story.
What did you wanna talk about?

220
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,748
I was thinking that I wanna get more involved.

221
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:19,838
You know... I don't know... Something like... maybe...
Supervising the 7th grade car wash.

222
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:25,636
Uhh, you know Amy has been running after like... two years.
Yea, but she does so much already.

223
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,514
It might be nice to give her a little rest.

224
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,644
It's so nice to see you becoming a real
member of the JAMS family.

225
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,855
It just feels so good to help.

226
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:58,460
Holy shit!
Alright, let's do this.

227
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,644
Hey, Mr. Delacorte, yes!

228
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,773
Hey, kids.
Hey...

229
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,400
Hey, You better not take it for a joyride.

230
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,194
- Are you sure?
- I'm watching you.

231
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,239
Miss Halsey... I'm impressed.
Thanks, I've been working out.

232
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:13,743
What a turn out.
Oh yeah, the kids are just having a blast.

233
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,328
Well, that's what it's all about.

234
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,457
God, you know we should go get a drink tonight
I feel like getting drunk

235
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,962
I mean not "drunk" drunk, strong buzz
still be able to drive.

236
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:29,258
I'm sorry... I can't get em'... just not ready
but if you're patient...

237
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,928
I think I might be worth your while.

238
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:36,100
- You're worth the wait.
- I think so too

239
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:06,295
Wally, it's Amy Squirrel.
Amy? What are you do...? Get out of here!

240
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,172
This will just take a sec...

241
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:12,969
Umm... I happen to be pedaling past
the 7th Grade car wash this Saturday.

242
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,765
- Kill it! Can we talk about this later?
- Later we'll all die said the gator to the fly.

243
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:22,229
Fuck!! What?
Just go.

244
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:30,362
Now, I don't want to speak out of school
but... from where I was sitting, I think...

245
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:37,077
It seem like Miss Halsey was getting
pretty chummy with the money.

246
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:42,916
Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling
from the 7th grade car wash?

247
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:49,756
Wally... we barely know anything about her.
Hey, you know what they raised almost $7000.

248
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:55,512
So whatever she did, worked. Lee Mathews dad
called, he said the car wash was a raging success.

249
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,849
And Lauren Lisman's dad called and he said
we should have car wash every weekend.

250
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,895
So instead of accusing her,
you might wanna ask her for some pointers.

251
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:08,274
Well if those pointers
include wearing provocative beach wear...

252
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,443
...for money, I think I'll pass.

253
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:15,657
This is ridiculous, this is the one place in this building
where I'm allowed to be alone with my thoughts

254
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:19,994
I only had this once a day...
If I'm lucky.

255
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:24,541
Next time you accuse one of my teachers of stealing,
you better have some evidence.

256
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,670
God damn it! We are done here.

257
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:34,718
Alrighty, have a super awesome day, you two.

258
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,477
Holy fuck! I thought she was never gonna leave.

259
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:26,485
What's going on with you?
Need a tissue? Huh?

260
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:31,240
She is such a phony.
Yeah, major phony.

261
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:34,702
But she also cares a lot too.

262
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:43,835
I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles.
I wanna sit on his face.

263
00:28:43,836 --> 00:28:45,755
Hey, guys.
Heyy.

264
00:28:56,796 --> 00:29:01,175
Lynn, will you go grab me some milk?
What kind of milk do you want?

265
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:04,888
The skim, whole, 2%, chocolate?

266
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,141
Surprise me.
Okay, I'll get you skim, no 2%...

267
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:15,190
So...
Holla, fellow educators...

268
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:20,403
Is everything okay with Gaby?
She will be fine.

269
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:25,617
I told her, Gaby if you're not happy with yourself,
you cant expect others to be happy with you.

270
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:29,454
It starts with you.
I'm sure she appreciated that.

271
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:37,128
And it's exactly what I told Elizabeth when she
told me about this upcoming fake breasts job.

272
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:42,968
Sorry... sorry I thought you were telling everyone.

273
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:44,219
Did you?

274
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,681
Well I'm pro-choice, I believe everyone should choose
whatever makes them happiest..

275
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:50,058
Except abortion, of course.

276
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,143
Of course.
Of course.

277
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:56,898
Looks like algebra is calling.
I hate math. Wish me luck.

278
00:29:57,065 --> 00:30:01,402
Hi, I'm a math terrorist
with close ties to algebra

279
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:05,282
I have weapons of
maths instruction.

280
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:15,834
Here, I'll walk you.
Man..Everyone is so nice around here.

281
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:19,628
Of course, hey watch my quadrant!

282
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:22,048
Here you go... 1%... Surprise!

283
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:27,429
Hi, my name is Elizabeth Halsey.
Any questions?

284
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:30,556
Hi, I'm Sashas mother.

285
00:30:30,557 --> 00:30:34,811
I am a little concerned at the importance you're
placing on movies.

286
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:38,398
I was just wondering whats your plans
were for the state test?

287
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:42,319
Listen, the school hired me because...
i'm amazing at what I do

288
00:30:43,195 --> 00:30:45,070
I used movies as one of my tools

289
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:50,034
but I also use a variety of
other multimedia techniques.

290
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:54,372
Listen, I could take you day by day through
my entire syllabus, but that's not just how I do things.

291
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:59,169
So "if I play it" as the Jews say.

292
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:03,340
Please, help yourself to some
delicious snacks and drinks in the back.

293
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:07,969
Class dismissed.
Excuse me, Miss Halsey.

294
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:10,554
Hi, I'm Morgans dad.

295
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:13,974
Morgan.

296
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:19,313
Great kid, so pre-cautious.
I just wish Morgan's grades were reflected.

297
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:24,528
If I know Morgan, and I think I do.
Ah!... Morgan will get there.

298
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:27,989
Listen, I'm sure you have full paid
along with a rocking hot body.

299
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,827
But if you could just keep an eye on Morgan?
My wife and I would really appreciate it.

300
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:37,457
For supplies and whatever.

301
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:42,921
Supplies??
You're Chase's parents?

302
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:48,677
You know a student like Chase would
benefit so much from some extra attention?

303
00:31:49,094 --> 00:31:51,763
So you think we should hire a tutor?

304
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:55,392
You know I'd be happy to do it myself,
but its just so hard with a class of 20..

305
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:00,313
25 or 30, whatever.
To be a teacher?

306
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:04,109
God, it is so hard on my salary
to have to pay for my own supplies

307
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:07,362
and my fiance, he cheated on me with his sister

308
00:32:07,737 --> 00:32:12,450
as your personal tutor, I guarantee
personally that she will get an A.

309
00:32:12,784 --> 00:32:16,329
Or your money back.

310
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:20,667
Say no more.

311
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:24,671
Make it out to cash.

312
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:19,351
Amy, hi.
Hi, I got you something.

313
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:25,273
What? You don't have to do that.
It's nothing, its my favorite book.

314
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:34,282
Eat, Pray, Love?
This is my favourite book too.

315
00:33:34,908 --> 00:33:40,539
What's your favourite part?
Love.

316
00:33:55,178 --> 00:33:57,972
What do you want?
Is that marijuana?

317
00:33:57,973 --> 00:34:00,851
No, it's medical marijuana.

318
00:34:00,892 --> 00:34:02,811
I have a prescription and everything.

319
00:34:02,812 --> 00:34:06,314
And I'm not gonna tell you why because,
it's between me and my doctor.

320
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:10,151
Oh... ok... well feel better.

321
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:11,527
Thanks.

322
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:14,114
My mom and I made some holiday cookies.

323
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:17,534
Those oatmeal rasin again?
Gingerbread.

324
00:34:20,453 --> 00:34:22,663
Let have it.

325
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:23,957
Watch the bowl.

326
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:29,588
Do you have anything to drink?

327
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:33,799
Listen, word to the wise.

328
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,552
Stop dressing like you're running for congress

329
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:39,472
I don't wanna run for congress.
I wanna be President.

330
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:43,727
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Keep saying shit like that you're gonna get punched.

331
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:48,440
You really wanna be a President
or is that something your parents want?

332
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:53,569
Look you don't have to decide right now.

333
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,365
Then who knows one day you wake up
you decide you want to be a missus.

334
00:34:57,407 --> 00:34:59,491
Salary plus tips.

335
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:01,619
Think about it.

336
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,831
If I think about it,
Will I get extra credit?

337
00:35:05,248 --> 00:35:08,376
Hopeless.

338
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:33,689
This is indeed a winter wonderland.

339
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,196
Wanna get high?
Yeaaah.

340
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,783
Give me a nug...
I'll go smoke it in my car.

341
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:48,955
Wow... No, I meant
Do you wanna get high with me?

342
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,926
Hey, they don't make songs like this anymore, right?

343
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,095
You know that’s not actually true Scott??

344
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:10,977
I'm writing a song right now called
855-8241777.

345
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,145
Extension 777.

346
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:17,608
So you guys having an awesome time?

347
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,986
Yes, Oh my God!
I love to dance, I could dance all night.

348
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:22,946
Hey can we go somewhere and talk?

349
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,074
I'll totally go for a talk right now.

350
00:36:29,245 --> 00:36:34,166
What's up?
Okay... whoo

351
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,086
I do not know how to say this.
I'm a kind of nervous.

352
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,046
Feels it's all happening so quickly.

353
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:42,841
You can tell me anything Scott,
you're one of my best friends

354
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:44,968
I'm crushing on someone

355
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,264
I think you're pretty great too.
Thanks. It's Amy.

356
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,602
No running in the hall!

357
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:55,604
Kids.

358
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:58,023
She's been amazing helping me do with my breakup.

359
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:01,152
Yeah, I don't know her that well
I know all the other teachers really hate her fucking guts

360
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:03,404
But I stay above all that stuff.

361
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,740
Can I be honest with you?
Of course.

362
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:10,869
It's nothing personal, but...

363
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,622
I don't think that you're Amy's type.

364
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:16,334
Really?
Yea.

365
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:20,086
She seem so... I don't know... sympathy-co.

366
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:30,799
Trust me
She's only using you for your money.

367
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,594
What?

368
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:39,724
Well I feel stupid.
No, Scott... Scott.

369
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:43,186
Look at me. I'm gonna get my breasts enlarged
in a couple of months...

370
00:37:43,187 --> 00:37:44,772
And when I recover from my surgery...

371
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:49,401
you and I are gonna go out and we are gonna
find awesome people for each other.

372
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:51,278
That sounds nice.

373
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,655
You're out of your mind.

374
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:57,867
There is no one in the LeBron who'll ever be Jordan.
Nobody will ever be Jordan... okay?

375
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:00,203
Ok, Lebron is a better re-bounder and passer.

376
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:03,248
Will you let me finish?
Can?... Can you let me finish?

377
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:06,501
Call me when Lebron has six championships.
That's the only argument?

378
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:08,921
It's the only argument I need, Shawn!!

379
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:14,802
Let's get baked.

380
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:20,516
Goods... we're gonna go get some baked goods.

381
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:24,937
You got this?

382
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:30,358
Just try it... try it!
Just... please stop pressuring her.

383
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,736
How does she know she doesn't like it
if she has never tried it before?

384
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:38,284
You know, we should probably be getting back.
Just fuckin do it... weed is awesome.

385
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:52,131
Hold it in. - Just blow it out
Hold it in. - Blow it out.

386
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:58,179
Okay... Lynn, I'm gonna take this.

387
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:01,182
I'm gonna go find a hot dog.

388
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:07,146
Well, that's definitely impressive.
Like you can do better?

389
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:10,316
Really? You sure you wanna do this?
Yea, gym teacher.

390
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:17,072
You understand this is what I do?
- Yea I got it - Like for a living.

391
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:32,295
You have no upper body strength.
Yes, I do...

392
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:35,340
Just not in my arms
or my chest.

393
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:38,469
Well I have cat like reflexes
accept for it.

394
00:39:50,147 --> 00:39:54,442
So, all this is mine, by the way
As far as the eye can see.

395
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:56,846
Really love with what
you've done with the place.

396
00:39:56,847 --> 00:40:00,115
Ya if you notice the nets, that's
a brand new nets I had installed.

397
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:02,450
This is original wood.

398
00:40:02,451 --> 00:40:04,619
See those championship banners?

399
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,664
When I first came to the school, they weren’t here.

400
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:11,585
They were over there,
I have moved over there.

401
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:20,427
So.. Russell, what has to go wrong in someone's life for
them to end up being a middle school gym teacher?

402
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:26,016
Well ah.. granted it wasn't the original plan
As a young boy I wanted to be a professor...

403
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:28,686
...of physical education.

404
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:31,564
At Harvard, but...

405
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:34,524
I don't know... I like it here.

406
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:38,111
What wend so wrong in your life
that you ended up educating children?

407
00:40:38,112 --> 00:40:42,658
I don't know.
Maybe I was a bad person in an other life.

408
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:47,620
We should like... go have a drink... sometime... together.

409
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:49,707
Like over winter break.

410
00:40:49,832 --> 00:40:54,085
Naah.. got something going.
Can I say something for the record?

411
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:57,965
Fine.
It's about... your... ttt.

412
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:02,595
The big fake titties
Are you really gonna do that?

413
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:05,221
Why would you do that?
Your tits are fine.

414
00:41:05,222 --> 00:41:08,350
I like your tits...
Ask my roommate.

415
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:17,860
Seriously?

416
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,822
Seriously?

417
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,785
Come on.

418
00:41:26,911 --> 00:41:29,163
Seriously?

419
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:35,211
Hey... Why are they closed?
It's Christmas?

420
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:38,088
Whatever...
Hey you got a lighter?

421
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:43,551
Miss Halsey, its me Garette from school.
It's Garrett. Having a nice Christmas?

422
00:41:43,552 --> 00:41:44,969
Aces...

423
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,639
Ahh!! What are you doing rest of day
you gonna see your family?

424
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,728
Ahh... Yeah I'm gonna go see some people
We're having like a big..pot luck so...

425
00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:58,317
Miss Halsey? Would you like to come
and spend Christmas with us?

426
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,254
That we remembered
Have we ever forget.. What is that?? haaha.

427
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:24,467
Guys, I'm really sorry I have to eat and run
I gotta head over to the shelters so..

428
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:27,804
Awww...
The shelter, Ah, that’s so inspiring.

429
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:30,431
Yeah, I really love helping bums.

430
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:33,434
But you'd have to wait for dessert
we have a real treat.

431
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:38,439
Garrett, why don't you run and get
some of your new poetry... - I don't want to hear it

432
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,403
God... I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be shy, marbles.

433
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:46,115
This is called the The Chase by Garrett Tiara.

434
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:52,829
XOXO, my love for you is XOXO.

435
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,417
About her smile
that I would walk a mile for.

436
00:42:56,709 --> 00:43:01,671
About her personality
that makes me see the best in me.

437
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:09,846
One glance, one dance
because together we can achieve...balance.

438
00:43:09,847 --> 00:43:11,557
Thank you.

439
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:17,437
I loved it
and I usually hate poetry.

440
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:21,524
Oh Philip, hate on Christmas?
Oops... Sorry, Santa.

441
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,402
Sorry, Jesus.

442
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:29,992
Umm... why don't you two give me a hand with dessert?
And we can let these two... discuss.

443
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:32,661
Fuck!

444
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:38,042
So, the poem's about that girl?
Yea, Chase.

445
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:42,462
I could just talk to her and tell her how I feel

446
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,381
I knew she'd understand.

447
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:48,551
Listen, that’s not gonna happen, buddy

448
00:43:48,552 --> 00:43:53,515
I was that hot girl, hotter... even
and I would never have gone out with you.

449
00:43:53,516 --> 00:43:56,392
And I'm not saying that to be mean,
I'm saying that to be helpful.

450
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:58,686
What do you know?
You don't even know our names

451
00:43:58,687 --> 00:44:02,565
I'll tell you what I know... a kid who wears
the same gymnastic sweat shirt 3 days a week...

452
00:44:02,566 --> 00:44:05,443
isn't getting laid until he's 29
that's what I know...

453
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:09,447
Sweat shirt was my dad's.
That’s all he left me... when he left me.

454
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:12,159
There's a reason... he didn't pack it.

455
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:14,494
Just saying.

456
00:44:14,495 --> 00:44:19,499
Welcome to the number one
New Year's Eve Party in the entire world.

457
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,796
This is literally the biggest party...
Aren't you going out with the other nurses?

458
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:26,799
I'm not a nurse.

459
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:28,925
I thought you were a nurse.

460
00:44:28,926 --> 00:44:30,803
I am a teacher.

461
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:08,924
Hey Welcome back.

462
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:13,888

00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:29,944
So, are you guys coming to the palace tonight?
My band's gonna do few songs...

466
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:31,152
You are in Period 5?

467
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:35,074
You're looking at the new rhythm
guitarist and backup vocalist.

Like you guys...
You should go talk to someone, Lynn.

I'm fine... here.

472
00:46:13,656 --> 00:46:18,076
Come on Lynn, you need to loosen up and live a little.

Go talk to them.
What am I gonna talk about?

477
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:33,508
It doesn’t matter.

478
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:38,137
You go... you start with one of em' and you start talking to
the other one...and then you go back to the first one

479
00:46:38,138 --> 00:46:42,600
but still be touching the other one
and then you just choose... Text book.

480
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:45,396
Yea, from the world's weirdest text book.

481
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:49,274
Lemme finish my drink.

482
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:51,192
Now... Go!

It is really fun over here.
Lynn, get your ass over to those cowboys.

484
00:46:56,657 --> 00:47:00,744
Oooo... well... Glad I wore my fun underwear.

485
00:47:06,917 --> 00:47:11,546
So, call me crazy, but this might be the
best Period 5 show of all time.

486
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:14,132
What are you doing here, anyway?

487
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:16,551
I thought it was poetry slam night.

488
00:47:16,552 --> 00:47:20,471
I was gonna get drunk and mock them.
Sounds fun, actually

489
00:47:20,472 --> 00:47:24,310
I'll let you know, next time I go.
Not that fun.

490
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,813
Okay..just so you know...
That shit does not face me at all

491
00:47:28,814 --> 00:47:33,067
I'm like the fuckin Terminator dude.
I'm just gonna keep coming after you.

492
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:35,028
Just so we're clear.

493
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:36,822
Good luck with that.

494
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:40,951
Oh Shit!!
Check it out.

495
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:44,329
I'll be damned.

496
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,497
That shit worked!

497
00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:48,792
Super fast.

498
00:47:55,132 --> 00:48:00,221
Wow, thank you guys for coming out
What a turnout, right? Umm...

499
00:48:00,387 --> 00:48:08,228
I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank the
guys from Period 5 for letting me join the band and.

500
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:11,189
Also I have an original song.

501
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:16,862
It is my first cracket song writing so... be kind.

502
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:21,534
And it goes out to someone very special.

503
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:29,041
There was a girl I met sometime ago.

504
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:36,506
Sympathy-co
She helped me heal, she helped me grow.

505
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:44,056
Sympathy-co
how do you know and you know and again you just know.

506
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:46,433
Sympathy-co.

507
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,360
Sympathy-co Exotico.

508
00:48:57,361 --> 00:49:00,029
Erotico.

509
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:03,742
You're my narcotic, Ohhh...

510
00:49:03,826 --> 00:49:10,666
Ask me how much I feel
I'll say... a lot-a-co...

511
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:16,130
We can never in the world be too much...

512
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:19,300
before I met you...

513
00:49:20,217 --> 00:49:21,719
fuck!

514
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,472
Is it me? I mean there's something wrong with me?
I don't think so.

515
00:49:26,473 --> 00:49:29,851
I mean, sometimes you talk to people and...
Thank you.

516
00:49:29,852 --> 00:49:35,064
Forget him, at least now you can stop
worrying about him and be the best teacher you can be..

517
00:49:35,065 --> 00:49:37,610
Who knows... maybe you'll win the bonus.

518
00:49:40,985 --> 00:49:43,403
What bonus?
For the state test.

519
00:49:43,404 --> 00:49:48,950
Which ever teacher has the highest scoring class
gets a bonus. Amy wins every year.

520
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:52,038
How much?
$ 5700.

521
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:56,792
Son of a bitch... 5700.
Yea... Goddamn it! Lynn.

522
00:49:57,084 --> 00:49:59,086
You never tell me anything.
Yea...

523
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:09,764
Come on.
C'mon c'mon c'mon...

524
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:13,184
Let's go, We had a lot to go over.
Everybody sit down, come on..

525
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:19,023
Where is the TV?
Now everybody open your "To kill a mockingbird" to page 1.

526
00:50:20,775 --> 00:50:22,400
Good, now...

527
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:27,364
Who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole
in the tree is filled with cement?

528
00:50:27,365 --> 00:50:28,950
Because he's a crybaby?

529
00:50:30,243 --> 00:50:31,536
Get out!

530
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,875
We're here to learn.

531
00:50:38,251 --> 00:50:40,837
Anybody else have a problem with that?

532
00:50:41,712 --> 00:50:44,674
Good
Now who has the answer to my question?

533
00:50:46,259 --> 00:50:48,886
Nobody's read this book?

534
00:50:49,136 --> 00:50:53,056
It's on the syllabus.
Well... You never assign it to us.

535
00:50:53,057 --> 00:50:54,933
Well now...
I am.

536
00:50:54,934 --> 00:50:57,352
And we have a quiz tomorrow.
What?!!

537
00:50:57,353 --> 00:50:59,480
On the first 100 pages.

538
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:06,528
You can't do that
I have band and jazz band tonight.

539
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:08,947
We haven't had
homework all year

540
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:10,658
o.

541
00:51:11,117 --> 00:51:14,202
Things are about to change around here.

542
00:51:14,203 --> 00:51:16,955
Recess is over.

543
00:51:16,956 --> 00:51:19,584
Because bird symbolize freedom?

544
00:51:20,168 --> 00:51:22,043
Good.
Good okay...

545
00:51:22,044 --> 00:51:24,922
Is anyone have anything to add
to what that girl just said?

546
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:31,929
So, what are the limitations of having
Scott as the narrator?

547
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,556
You, Chapz.

548
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:37,685
Because he...
EEEH!!

549
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:51,407
Don't flinch... seriously...
You and you... hold his arms down.

550
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,328
Next question.

551
00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:00,958
Because Atticus is always the voice of
reason and justice?

552
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:04,462
Correct... here.

553
00:52:04,504 --> 00:52:06,881
Nothing in the face.

554
00:52:07,423 --> 00:52:10,384
Woooh!!
Wait!!

555
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:14,555
Miss Halsey... really?
Wow!!

556
00:52:15,348 --> 00:52:18,518
I never...
We're in the middle of a lesson.

557
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,311
Twilight, look at me.

558
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:23,772
What do we talk about in class?

559
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:28,443
Your weight should be evenly distributed
You have to throw off the back foot.

560
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:31,530
Don't throw at her
Throw through her.

561
00:52:31,531 --> 00:52:33,740
Hit her!
Hit her!

562
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:34,992
Nail her!

563
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:55,915
This is so funny, cause I love
raisins and he hates raisins.

564
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,125
Ying and Yang.

565
00:52:58,126 --> 00:53:00,962
You guys are so cute.
So cute?

566
00:53:00,963 --> 00:53:02,922
It's like... too cute almost.

567
00:53:02,923 --> 00:53:05,968
Last week when we went for a drive.

568
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:11,640
We had no idea where we were going,
We left the maps at home...

569
00:53:11,682 --> 00:53:17,020
What!! No way...
It was fine. I have a GPS navy system.

570
00:53:17,104 --> 00:53:22,525
Oh, Thank God.
And we discovered this new Ethiopian restaurant.

571
00:53:22,526 --> 00:53:26,280
They finally got their own cuisine
Progress...

572
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:35,622
Your shirt's misbuttoned
Her shirt is misbuttoned.

573
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:40,459
Thank you Amy, for pointing that out.
You're so welcome.

574
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:45,673
Gosh! Its been such a mess this week.
You know, Just working myself to the bone.

575
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:48,676
Yeah, its been quite a change.
Well I think it's great.

576
00:53:48,677 --> 00:53:54,849
I just love people who are so passionate
about what they do... it's so inspirational.

577
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:59,062
Thanks. Yea you know, some teachers
just sail by doing that bare minimum thing...

578
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:02,191
I don't know, it's just not me...

579
00:54:02,232 --> 00:54:05,861
It's good to know there's still some
actual educators out there.

580
00:54:07,696 --> 00:54:10,698
What else, Sasha?
I think I've told you everything.

581
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:14,869
Anyone know where Danny Morebox is?
Any more movies in class?

582
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:20,082
No, we're actually learning. Hey do you know
Animal Farm isn't even really about animals?

583
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:24,253
Animal Farm?
Sasha, that's not even on the syllabus.

584
00:54:24,254 --> 00:54:27,049
Yeah, I know you're forgetting something.

585
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:32,595
One extra credit on your diagram, want or not?
I do I want it.

586
00:54:32,596 --> 00:54:35,516
Okay, okay think.
Let me think.

587
00:54:36,558 --> 00:54:39,685
Well there was... Never mind.
What?

588
00:54:39,686 --> 00:54:42,648
Well it was okay... it was medicinal.

589
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,820
And if she claims it's medicinal,
I would demand to see a prescription.

590
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:51,657
That's what I would do if I were you, Wally.

591
00:54:51,658 --> 00:54:55,826
Do you have any proof other than what one student
thought she saw?

592
00:54:55,827 --> 00:55:01,708
Well this one student is in line to be editor
of The Daily Musket next year.

593
00:55:02,042 --> 00:55:04,378
She's got a lot to loose
going public with this.

594
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:09,298
If the Teacher's Union found out that I was administering
a drug test to a teacher with this little proof...

595
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:11,759
They would make my life a living hell, Amy...

596
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,971
So, you're just gonna let her walk free?

597
00:55:15,138 --> 00:55:17,599
That's it!

598
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:23,896
Amy, Stop that Stop it!

599
00:55:23,897 --> 00:55:25,189
Sorry.

600
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,359
Sorry.
Sit down.

601
00:55:28,944 --> 00:55:35,366
Amy, Do you see this beautiful
little glass dolphin figurine?

602
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:37,035
Mmmm...
Look at it.

603
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:39,495
Yeah.
Look at it.

604
00:55:39,496 --> 00:55:42,875
Looking at it!
Elizabeth gave this to me.

605
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:47,296
She is a thoughtful young woman
and she is teaching for all the right reasons.

606
00:55:47,462 --> 00:55:53,176
Wally!!! Can't you see? She is
manipulating you through the use of dolphins?

607
00:55:53,177 --> 00:55:58,139
No, what I see is that you are getting worked up
And what I would hate to see...

608
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,977
is for you to get overwhelmed...

609
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:05,022
like you did in 2008.

610
00:56:05,814 --> 00:56:09,067
Gotcha! Thanks Wally,
for bringing that up.

611
00:56:10,527 --> 00:56:13,030
For I'm all about that.

612
00:56:15,574 --> 00:56:18,160
Do not do that with your mouth.

613
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:21,246
Regular mouth.

614
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:31,714
"Atticus Finch is a good lawyer because
he is a good person...

615
00:56:31,715 --> 00:56:33,675
who's a lawyer."

616
00:56:35,761 --> 00:56:40,849
Stupid point, misspelled.

617
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:45,144
"Stupider"

618
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:48,565
Is this English?

619
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:58,909
Are you fucking kidding me?

620
00:57:01,912 --> 00:57:05,331
Pathetic. This is why the Japs are overtaking us.

621
00:57:05,332 --> 00:57:07,167
And believe me I don't mean you.

622
00:57:08,669 --> 00:57:11,088
But, we're working really hard.

623
00:57:12,256 --> 00:57:15,383
You're not working hard enough.
I need results.

624
00:57:15,384 --> 00:57:17,177
Class dismissed.

625
00:57:25,644 --> 00:57:28,729
OFFICIAL PRACTICE TEST MANUAL

626
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:30,524
I need that test!

627
00:58:40,323 --> 00:58:44,702
Good afternoon, Illinois standard student test
How may I direct your call?

628
00:58:44,703 --> 00:58:48,664
Hi, my name is Marjarie Goodman and
I'm calling from the Chicago Tribune.

629
00:58:48,665 --> 00:58:54,504
Who could I speak to regarding the allegations
of racial bias on your standardized tests?

630
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:56,256
Please hold..

631
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:08,185
Marjarie?

632
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:10,561
You must be Carl?

633
00:59:10,562 --> 00:59:15,317
Thank you for meeting me on such short notice.
Of course. Sure..

634
00:59:15,525 --> 00:59:19,487
Did you find the boys okay?
Was it a good drive? - Great drive.

635
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:24,825
Listen Carl, I know that you are a very busy man
So, I'm just gonna get right down to it

636
00:59:24,826 --> 00:59:30,039
I've been speaking to various...
ah... black... citizens... who

637
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,418
...alleged that your test are biased
towards white people and orientals.

638
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:39,965
Okay... lemme tell you something right away
A: Orientals tests better...

639
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:45,679
B: Every couple of years we get these cockamamie
charges coming in from various parts of the state.

640
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,141
Lemme dat daa...
Usually here, the things that they call me.

641
00:59:49,142 --> 00:59:54,021
Racist, faggotron, faggy Hitler, dick breath...
Okay...?

642
00:59:54,022 --> 00:59:59,318
But I am not racist.
I voted for Obama, you can quote me on that in your article.

643
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:01,320
You know what I think would help... Carl...?

644
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:03,781
For me to see one of
this year's tests.

645
01:00:03,782 --> 01:00:07,201
Oh! Sure, I can get you one easy
No problem.

646
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:08,869
Great... great!

647
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:13,833
Umm... The day after the schools administers them,
I will shoot one right over to you.

648
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:16,627
I was hoping to see it sooner.
I'm on a bit of a deadline.

649
01:00:16,628 --> 01:00:22,591
No, no... that is absolutely classified
Unless, unless you have one of these bad boys, right here.

650
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:28,013
Wow! You know Carl...
Enough business for one night, don't you think?

651
01:00:28,014 --> 01:00:32,894
Oh... oh tell me bout that...
I think I'm gonna have another drink before I hit the road.

652
01:00:33,478 --> 01:00:38,400
...It's like the freedom and the wind in your hair
obviously the image... you don't wanna...

653
01:00:38,483 --> 01:00:42,070
But then there were others like... just...
Like hopeless or scary... so I... count me out.

654
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:46,032
But you seem like such a wild man Carl...

655
01:00:47,701 --> 01:00:50,745
What turns you on Carl?

656
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:56,418
Eh..Everything.
You wanna know what turns me on?

657
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:58,086
Sex in an office.

658
01:00:58,295 --> 01:01:03,383
Getting fucked really hard against a wooden desk.

659
01:01:04,301 --> 01:01:07,888
Mine's metal.
Even better.

660
01:01:08,346 --> 01:01:11,016
And voila.
So...

661
01:01:14,102 --> 01:01:15,312
This is the desk.

662
01:01:16,938 --> 01:01:18,982
Do you have anything to drink?

663
01:01:19,274 --> 01:01:23,361
Uh Uhh!! Yes I do!

664
01:01:24,487 --> 01:01:26,071
Voila.

665
01:01:26,072 --> 01:01:29,909
White wine in the office? Bad Boy...

666
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:33,330
Do you have any music Carl?
I have the Internet radio.

667
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,791
I love Internet radio.

668
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:40,169
You. Ve... come to... the right place.

669
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,963
Cause I have that.

670
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:45,509
See, I am not a wiz' at this computer here.

671
01:01:45,592 --> 01:01:53,308
Umm... it's relatively new and Grace who is ah...
Work with me on Mondays and Wednesdays and Thursday and...

672
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:59,439
I share her with Greg across the way
Greg across is actually the guy who got me into spinning.

673
01:01:59,856 --> 01:02:01,608
Oh, there we go.

674
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:07,488
Shall we toast?

675
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:10,534
To new friends And new lovers

676
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:30,803
I'm gonna take off my shoes, is that okay?
Whatever man. I'm gonna go hit the ladies room.

677
01:02:30,804 --> 01:02:35,100
Okay... There's a handicapped one... which is way closer

678
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,463
I took off my shoes?

679
01:03:05,922 --> 01:03:08,508
I wanna fuck you baa-side desk

680
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:10,260
I wanna fuck you against the desk

681
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:14,346
Carl..I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out.

682
01:03:14,347 --> 01:03:20,103
Marji... I am going to rock your vagina.

683
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:23,940
Ohh... The wine is good.

684
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:36,786
Hello titties...

685
01:03:37,078 --> 01:03:39,246
ONE MONTH LATER

686
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:43,501
If anyone has any information
regarding the missing Anne wig...

687
01:03:43,502 --> 01:03:46,545
please... let me know ASAP.

688
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:49,757
Come on, guys.
There's a wig missing.

689
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:53,241
Because if that wig isn’t found

690
01:03:53,242 --> 01:03:56,723
you can bet your bottom dollar
the sun will not come out tomorrow.

691
01:03:57,307 --> 01:03:59,266
Back to you, Wally.

692
01:03:59,267 --> 01:04:03,771
Ahh... Okay thank you, Amy.
I'm sure everybody wants to get home so I'm gonna be quick.

693
01:04:03,772 --> 01:04:06,942
Four scores, seven years ago.

694
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:13,864
That's a... Goddamn it! Sandy...

695
01:04:13,865 --> 01:04:16,368
Sandy's so funny.

696
01:04:17,994 --> 01:04:21,997
Huh... I have here
I have here the results of the state exam.

697
01:04:21,998 --> 01:04:26,627
And I'm happy to announce that the...
John Adams Middle School, that's us...

698
01:04:26,628 --> 01:04:30,048
Scored in the top 5%
of the whole state.

699
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:35,761
Nice...
Good job, guys...

700
01:04:35,762 --> 01:04:39,139
And I wanna single out
I wanna single out one of our own.

701
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,892
Who show that with hard work and dedication...

702
01:04:41,893 --> 01:04:45,313
One teacher can make a difference.

703
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,900
And this teacher is now
$ 5700 richer.

704
01:04:49,901 --> 01:04:53,780
With the highest scores in cook-county
That's the whole county

705
01:04:54,197 --> 01:04:58,200
I want everyone to give a big round of applause.

706
01:04:58,201 --> 01:05:00,412
To Elizabeth Halsey.

707
01:05:06,084 --> 01:05:09,337
Well done.
Thank you.

708
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:15,844
Congratulations, Miss. Halsey.

709
01:05:15,927 --> 01:05:17,888
Thanks dude.

710
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,727
Well if it isn't Professor Smarty pants?
Don't mess with me, I'm a lot stronger than I look.

711
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:29,398
Elizabeth, I am so proud of you.

712
01:05:29,399 --> 01:05:35,946
I mean if someone told me at the beginning of the year
that you... 'you'... will get the bonus...

713
01:05:35,947 --> 01:05:42,286
Won't have had to say to whom ever
it was "No way"... "Absolutely not" and...

714
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:45,414
Now, here we are...

715
01:05:45,415 --> 01:05:47,875
We should go out and celebrate.
Your treat?

716
01:05:47,876 --> 01:05:54,966
Yea, unfortunately Elizabeth, Scott and I have to go
over the itinerary for the Springfield trip.

717
01:05:55,008 --> 01:05:58,553
We're the chaperones
we're going together.

718
01:05:58,637 --> 01:06:01,890
We're dating... so...
It'll also be romantic.

719
01:06:01,932 --> 01:06:07,521
Have fun.
Yea, You're not seeing anyone now, right?

720
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:20,359
Almost... done...

721
01:06:20,401 --> 01:06:25,197
Okay... so that's endorsed
And put the rest on these.

722
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,283
Just put it.
Alrighty.

723
01:06:28,034 --> 01:06:30,745
Okay.

724
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:34,123
"Ms. Squirrel says reading is fun"

725
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:55,478
"Learning is Fun-tastic"

726
01:07:03,027 --> 01:07:05,321
Who did this?

727
01:07:05,404 --> 01:07:11,826
Aww... Come on.
Anyone wants extra sticker on their wall star board?

728
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:16,707
What brings you here?
Mr. Apple.

729
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,089
What was that, Mr. Apple?

730
01:07:23,714 --> 01:07:26,634
You want me to take a bite?

731
01:07:26,926 --> 01:07:29,595
Alrighty roo...

732
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:36,601
Elizabeth, I just want to thank you again
for stepping in today, you really saved us here.

733
01:07:36,602 --> 01:07:39,938
No problem.
Is Amy gonna be okay?

734
01:07:39,939 --> 01:07:44,276
Yea, Amy's gonna be fine.
Well, let her know she's in my prayers.

735
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:54,412
Someone's calling my name.

736
01:07:54,995 --> 01:07:58,958
I dare you.
I'm not afraid of your dare, Fabrigo.

737
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,381
That's really dangerous, Russell

738
01:08:05,464 --> 01:08:08,675
I'll call you from the hotel.
Bye, Amy.

739
01:08:08,676 --> 01:08:12,137
Yea, she's sitting right next to me.
No.

740
01:08:12,138 --> 01:08:15,141
Thanks for calling again

741
01:08:16,017 --> 01:08:20,270
Amy says "hi"
Well she sure calls a lot.

742
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:23,566
So, are you excited about your surgery?

743
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:26,192
I've never been more excited
about anything.

744
01:08:26,193 --> 01:08:29,362
It's a pretty inspiring message
to the kids.

745
01:08:29,363 --> 01:08:32,449
We should never stop working on ourselves.

746
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:37,913
Like you, with your little boobs
or me experimenting with ethnic food.

747
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:22,291
Gosh!!
I never loose my keys.

748
01:09:23,501 --> 01:09:26,753
Such a dingaling.

749
01:09:26,754 --> 01:09:30,132
What's wrong with your face?
What is wrong with your face?

750
01:09:30,174 --> 01:09:32,967
Hey... I'm
Just trying to make conversation.

751
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:37,139
We're all done.
Super, thanks a bunchames

752
01:09:46,107 --> 01:09:48,776
I knew it.

753
01:09:59,203 --> 01:10:04,875
Well that is definitely Marjarie, only with kind of weird
hair here In real life she's actually very pretty.

754
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:11,173
She in some kind of trouble? Marjarie?
I think you're the one who might be in some kind of trouble.

755
01:10:11,382 --> 01:10:15,511
Did you or did you not give her
a copy of the state test?

756
01:10:16,429 --> 01:10:20,849
No, no... no
absolutely not, no I...

757
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:24,477
I did give her some quotes for her article.

758
01:10:24,478 --> 01:10:29,358
What article?
Her article for the Tribune. She's a reporter there, right?

759
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:35,572
Test tampering?
At JAMS?

760
01:10:35,573 --> 01:10:39,451
This time I have a witness and
like I said Wally, she stole the Anne wig.

761
01:10:39,452 --> 01:10:42,787
We're dealing with
a criminal mastermind.

762
01:10:42,788 --> 01:10:46,083
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news Wall...

763
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:49,962
You know... how much we all love her.

764
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:53,465
Okay, well... You know
I have to call the superintendor.

765
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:57,385
We're gonna have to cross check
her entire class's scores.

766
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,638
This is a real shit sandwich!

767
01:11:00,348 --> 01:11:02,640
Course, you know what scares me the most, Wall?

768
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:04,727
This is just what we know, right?

769
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:09,106
Who knows what else she's capable of?

770
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:13,527
So awful.

771
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,119
Fruit Roll-Up?

772
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,539
You know, when President Lincoln
abolish slavery...

773
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:29,251
It was not a popular opinion.

774
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:33,422
- Hmmm.
- I just hate slavery so so much.

775
01:11:33,464 --> 01:11:36,174
Slavery's the worst.

776
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:40,012
If I could go back in time
and undo slavery? I would.

777
01:11:41,138 --> 01:11:42,889
I hate it.

778
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,015
I hate it.

779
01:11:44,016 --> 01:11:49,397
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt you guys, but...
I couldn't help it over hear your conversations.

780
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:51,231
Can I tell you guys what I hate?

781
01:11:51,232 --> 01:11:56,529
Sharks.
Well sharks can tear families apart.

782
01:11:57,071 --> 01:12:00,282
But they're also so majestic.
They are beautiful creatures.

783
01:12:00,324 --> 01:12:03,828
But they're also so ferocious.
So ferocious.

784
01:12:04,036 --> 01:12:07,748
One of nature's
cruel joke I guess...

785
01:12:12,044 --> 01:12:14,714
Thank you, Elizabeth, for listening.

786
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:19,385
Scott, I want you to know
You can talk to me about anything.

787
01:12:40,698 --> 01:12:44,118
Your jeans feels so good
against my jeans.

788
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:48,705
Totally.
Hey, your body feels so good.

789
01:12:48,706 --> 01:12:51,334
Oh, I need some water.

790
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:18,069
Oh I'm drying' the shit out of you.
Oh Dry Fuck the fuck outta me, Scott.

791
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:22,031
Just stop talking.

792
01:13:22,656 --> 01:13:27,036
I'm close.
Don't move.

793
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:31,916
Here I go... Almost.

794
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,209
Wait for it.

795
01:13:35,294 --> 01:13:38,880
Really close.. Ready?
Mmmm... Yea.

796
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,174
Just stop talking.

797
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:58,889
Almost there.

798
01:14:06,563 --> 01:14:09,775
That was great.
More like amazing.

799
01:14:10,275 --> 01:14:16,240
Well, I'm gonna get going
I don't want the kids to see me leaving your room - Yea.

800
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,620
You're so symphaty-co.

801
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:26,917
Maybe next time
we can dry hump without our clothes on.

802
01:14:26,959 --> 01:14:30,546
I'm pretty sure I'd like that.

803
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:40,931
Even your forehead is sexy.

804
01:14:42,307 --> 01:14:44,810
Oh, time for bed.

805
01:14:45,477 --> 01:14:49,481
All right then.
See you in the maniano

806
01:14:50,607 --> 01:14:55,487
Elizabeth, don't let the bed bugs bite

807
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:09,752
I was just going over some stuff for tomorrow.

808
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:12,046
Yeah, cool...

809
01:15:12,796 --> 01:15:15,883
I'm serious.
Okay.

810
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,219
Cheers.

811
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:26,226
They forgot to re-stuffed my minibar.
How's yours lookin'?

812
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:30,731
You know, I'm super tired
I'm just getin' in the sack

813
01:15:30,898 --> 01:15:35,486
I'll see you tomorrow then.
Good night.

814
01:15:37,029 --> 01:15:41,283
And 17.

815
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:49,166
Oh, hold on. Shelly... Ooo
Shelly, someone's got a message.

816
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:56,590
Ah! Dry humpin' the shit out of you.
Yeah, Dry Fuck the fuck outta me, Scott.

817
01:15:58,425 --> 01:16:01,928
I wasn't always president.
Oh!! no!

818
01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:06,641
I had many jobs when I
lived here in New Salem.

819
01:16:06,642 --> 01:16:11,270
My fave... My favorite job was,
'Splitting rails'.

820
01:16:11,271 --> 01:16:15,275
Which is why they call me 'rail splitter'.

821
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:19,738
Anybody know... anybody know
any of my other nick names??

822
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:24,826
"Honest Abe".
Yes, obviously. Honest Abe.

823
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:27,162
That was the big one Honest Abe.

824
01:16:27,204 --> 01:16:30,749
They always called me that because
I said what was on my mind.

825
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:33,835
Even if it made me unpopular.

826
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:41,218
Remember, a great man always has the courage
to say what is in his heart.

827
01:16:41,719 --> 01:16:43,595
Yea?

828
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:51,770
I love Chase Rubin Rossy.
Great.

829
01:16:51,895 --> 01:16:55,232
Who would like to see Mary Tod churn butter?
Churn butter?

830
01:16:55,315 --> 01:16:59,318
I love you, Chase.
I wanna yell it from the mountain tops.

831
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:05,409
And even though you pretty much stop talking
to me in fifth grade... I don't care

832
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:08,411
I remember the Chase
that wrote me a card.

833
01:17:08,412 --> 01:17:11,915
When my dad was overweight and
had to go to the hospital because of his heart.

834
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:16,044
And a year later, when he left my
mom and moved in with his trainer...

835
01:17:16,045 --> 01:17:18,172
You wrote me another card.

836
01:17:18,213 --> 01:17:20,423
What happened to us?

837
01:17:20,424 --> 01:17:24,762
Remember, in the second grade when we
had a sleep over and you wet the bed?

838
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:29,308
And you were so embarrassed, and you made me
promise never to tell anyone?

839
01:17:29,767 --> 01:17:33,687
Well, I never have
and I never will.

840
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:37,733
So there it is
My heart honestly.

841
01:17:38,275 --> 01:17:40,486
Don't let me leave.
Oh! Please don't.

842
01:17:40,819 --> 01:17:44,615
Always believe.

843
01:17:45,324 --> 01:17:47,618
Gross...

844
01:17:47,659 --> 01:17:50,954
Buuhhr!
Loser.

845
01:17:51,955 --> 01:17:53,332
Guys, c'mon settle down.

846
01:17:53,374 --> 01:17:57,503
Okay... Let's see how Mary Tod's
doing with that butter.

847
01:17:57,586 --> 01:18:00,755
Okay... That's enough.
We get it, you're crying.

848
01:18:00,756 --> 01:18:02,716
She just laughed at me
and called me 'gross'.

849
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,346
Yeah! Did you hear your speech? Come on lets go back.
No.

850
01:18:07,429 --> 01:18:09,181
No, I'm not going back.
Come on.

851
01:18:09,264 --> 01:18:12,142
Just leave me alone.

852
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:19,775
Get your ass back here.

853
01:18:28,367 --> 01:18:30,452
We done running?

854
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:35,499
Ah? Everything okay in here?
It's okay, I'm his teacher.

855
01:18:35,582 --> 01:18:37,710
Oh Okay Take your time.

856
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:40,295
She's never gonna like me, is she?

857
01:18:40,379 --> 01:18:43,382
Are we still on this?
She's my everything.

858
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:49,546
Here is the deal man...
I cannot keep sugar coating this for you.

859
01:18:49,547 --> 01:18:52,433
This girl is never gonna
be interested in you.

860
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:59,648
Never. You clearly have a... rich
interior life with the poems and the whatever but...

861
01:18:59,732 --> 01:19:04,945
She wants a guy like Ian.. What's his face?
Ian Mentelbaum? The rapper?

862
01:19:05,029 --> 01:19:07,990
He's an idiot.
Yea, he's a fuckin' moron.

863
01:19:08,115 --> 01:19:09,699
But she doesn't care.

864
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,286
She's superficial and
her priorities are all fucked up.

865
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,126
She likes him because he's
hot and popular dude. You...

866
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:23,005
are sensitive.
Yes, thank you.

867
01:19:23,047 --> 01:19:25,549
It's not a compliment.

868
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:28,344
You have some rough road ahead of you.

869
01:19:28,385 --> 01:19:32,222
Seventh grade is not your moment.
Yeah, eighth grade will be better.

870
01:19:32,306 --> 01:19:35,059
Probably not.
I think in college.

871
01:19:35,309 --> 01:19:38,896
That's your window be ready.

872
01:19:42,983 --> 01:19:45,861
...If I go back out there
everyone's gonna laugh at me.

873
01:19:53,952 --> 01:19:56,538
Maybe this will help.
What are you doing?

874
01:19:56,622 --> 01:20:00,292
I'm giving you a gift.
Oh wow..

875
01:20:00,751 --> 01:20:04,254
We are gonna change the new cycle.

876
01:20:05,047 --> 01:20:07,299
Trust me on this.

877
01:20:10,052 --> 01:20:11,761
I thought it would be heavier.

878
01:20:11,762 --> 01:20:16,850
Don't be weird, and take this off
never fucking wear it again, what are u, crazy?

879
01:20:21,105 --> 01:20:24,692
Everything okay with Garrett?
No, it's not

880
01:20:24,775 --> 01:20:29,697
I found him hooking up with an eighth-grader
from another school. She was jerking him off.

881
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:35,369
Yea, I'm gonna give him detention when we get back.
That's probably a good idea.

882
01:20:35,494 --> 01:20:38,288
Garrett Portman, I was a kid from
an old boys school.

883
01:20:38,372 --> 01:20:41,834
Yea, and he was wearing this.
What?

884
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:46,463
Awesome.
It's real...

885
01:20:48,716 --> 01:20:53,470
It's a nice thing you did.
I don't know what you're talking about?

886
01:20:53,554 --> 01:20:58,392
Really? Cause I couldn't help but
notice that you're not wearing a bra.

887
01:20:58,434 --> 01:21:01,562
And those...
Those kids are there playing with it.

888
01:21:02,563 --> 01:21:07,234
Much people don't wear bras.
Definitely. Much teachers.

889
01:21:07,317 --> 01:21:11,030
Well if you must know, I was helping
a student through a tough time

890
01:21:11,155 --> 01:21:13,532
I'm going through such a tough time.

891
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:17,911
Can I have your panties?
I'm not wearing any..

892
01:21:27,463 --> 01:21:30,966
Amy, what are you doing here?
Scott, talk to the hand.

893
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,553
Amy?
I know...

894
01:21:34,636 --> 01:21:37,347
Ev-ery-thing.

895
01:21:37,348 --> 01:21:39,766
Carl Halabi.
The state test.

896
01:21:39,767 --> 01:21:42,643
The blasting disregard for the school syllabus.

897
01:21:42,644 --> 01:21:46,398
And lets not forget..
The sleeping with my boyfriend

898
01:21:47,775 --> 01:21:50,486
Scott, your phone accidentally
called me last night

899
01:21:51,153 --> 01:21:54,823
I can't believe you
let her take advantage of you like that.

900
01:21:55,532 --> 01:22:01,747
You are too trusting.
I am. I didn't know what was happening

901
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:05,292
I hope you haven't spent that bonus check
on anything because you're about to give it back.

902
01:22:05,293 --> 01:22:10,005
And then some...
jail time... Jail time!

903
01:22:10,923 --> 01:22:16,678
Did you ever think that maybe... Save it doll face
you can explain it all tomorrow to the principal.

904
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:17,888
And the superintendent.

905
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:23,977
When you got your meeting with the principal
and the superintendent tomorrow... at the meeting...

906
01:22:34,822 --> 01:22:39,243
I need you to go to this guy's office
and scare the shit out of him.

907
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,412
Tell me my mission again.

908
01:22:41,495 --> 01:22:46,166
Hand him the envelope.
I'm gonna need a couple bucks for gas.

909
01:22:49,628 --> 01:22:52,798
And a couple bucks for snacks.

910
01:23:16,905 --> 01:23:20,367
Oh my God!
Sir?

911
01:23:20,617 --> 01:23:23,495
Oh my God, are you okay?
I got fucked up my knee.

912
01:23:23,912 --> 01:23:26,915
Easy Easy does it, easy...

913
01:23:28,042 --> 01:23:30,836
You need an ambulance?
Ambulance is not necessary.

914
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:34,423
I walking on.
Walking on is number 1 worst thing you should probably do.

915
01:23:36,925 --> 01:23:38,802
Please don't touch my mirror.

916
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:44,016
Please sir? What the ff?? What the fuck, who does that?
I'm a friend of Marjorie's.

917
01:23:45,684 --> 01:23:48,771
Oh! Friend of Marjorie?
Well get then... Fuck you man.

918
01:23:49,438 --> 01:23:53,691
Huh fuck you... fuck... You like that?
Stop kicking it... You stop fucking kicking it.

919
01:23:53,692 --> 01:23:55,578
Fuck your scooter
and fuck Marjorie.

920
01:23:55,579 --> 01:23:58,739
She drugged me and she stole from me...
then she's going down.

921
01:23:58,822 --> 01:24:01,658
Let me think.

922
01:24:05,496 --> 01:24:11,335
Take it.
And open up... open up.

923
01:24:12,628 --> 01:24:18,884
Ya, not bad... for a camera phone Huh??
You can keep those too -Fuck!

924
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,806
And I was never here.
You hear me? -Fuck.

925
01:24:26,642 --> 01:24:28,769
Don't... Stop fucking with my car.

926
01:24:33,816 --> 01:24:36,527
They're ready for you.

927
01:24:37,486 --> 01:24:43,325
Learning is fun-tastic.
- What did you say to me?

928
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:46,620
Desk?

929
01:24:48,372 --> 01:24:53,627
Yea, I forgot that was there.
Such a dick sometimes.

930
01:24:55,212 --> 01:25:01,593
This is very very bad, Elizabeth.
Incredibly very bad, Elizabeth

931
01:25:01,927 --> 01:25:04,221
...and observe it
Amy, you said you wouldn't speak.

932
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:08,851
Bring him in.

933
01:25:14,231 --> 01:25:18,484
Mr. Halabi, thank you for your time.
Most welcome.

934
01:25:18,485 --> 01:25:26,118
I guess I should begin by saying that my
statement from earlier in the week was not true.

935
01:25:27,202 --> 01:25:29,788
What part of it, exactly?

936
01:25:29,872 --> 01:25:33,000
All of it..
Pretty much

937
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:35,502
I've never seen this woman before in my life.

938
01:25:35,627 --> 01:25:41,215
Baloney.
You seem... very certain a couple of days ago?

939
01:25:41,216 --> 01:25:45,846
I did, because... umm...

940
01:25:46,972 --> 01:25:49,058
I'm a casual drug user.

941
01:25:49,141 --> 01:25:53,061
That's my thing, and everybody
knows it. so..

942
01:25:53,062 --> 01:25:58,609
That explains me, making
absolutely no sense.

943
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:02,237
Thank you.

944
01:26:02,321 --> 01:26:05,990
You realise it... if we found out you're lying,
You're gonna lose your job.

945
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:07,201
Plus jail time.

946
01:26:07,326 --> 01:26:14,541
Yes I understand. I just don't want to see
an innocent teacher get hurt.

947
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:20,714
Thank you, sir.
I don't want to see anybody get hurt.

948
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:34,811
What the hell was that?
So, there you go. I guess that explains everything.

949
01:26:34,812 --> 01:26:37,564
Retest!!
Retest! Retest!

950
01:26:37,648 --> 01:26:41,567
Damn it! Squirrel... I am not going
to have a repeat of 2008!

951
01:26:41,568 --> 01:26:44,446
Sit your ass down!

952
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,281
A retest on? C'mon.

953
01:26:47,282 --> 01:26:49,409
Do we really wanna tell our
young people...

954
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:50,869
that if they study, sacrifice...

955
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:53,788
and achieve the highest scores
in the state...

956
01:26:53,789 --> 01:26:57,501
that they're rewarded
with suspicion?

957
01:26:58,544 --> 01:27:00,545
I don't!

958
01:27:00,546 --> 01:27:03,423
I find these kind of accusations troubling.

959
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:07,302
And quite frankly, reckless.

960
01:27:07,636 --> 01:27:09,471
I worked my ass off for this school.

961
01:27:09,472 --> 01:27:14,560
And I know I am not perfect.
But show me the perfect teacher.

962
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:16,269
You can't.

963
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:21,650
There are even teachers in
this very school who use drugs.

964
01:27:21,692 --> 01:27:27,197
They do, they do use drugs.
- They do -They do -They do

965
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:32,952
Wally, do you remember how I told you,
there are teachers here who use and abuse drugs?

966
01:27:32,953 --> 01:27:37,666
God damn it!
And I'm hearing about this now?

967
01:27:41,462 --> 01:27:43,213
Where is it Axle?
Where's it boy?

968
01:27:43,297 --> 01:27:47,259
No, no, no that's my class.
Axle's barking at the wrong tree there.

969
01:27:47,676 --> 01:27:52,514
Ma'am! Please don't touch the dog.
Your dog is mistaken.

970
01:27:52,973 --> 01:27:57,770
We've got desk..
He's not gonna find anything in here.

971
01:28:02,941 --> 01:28:05,986
Clean!
Haa! I told you.

972
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,073
Maybe there's a false bottom.

973
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:25,296
That is not mine.
This... ss thiszzz... This isn’t even my desk, it's hers!

974
01:28:25,297 --> 01:28:29,343
Don't worry Amy...
We'll get you the help you need.

975
01:28:31,512 --> 01:28:32,763
You monster!!

976
01:28:32,805 --> 01:28:39,395
Wow wooo woo wow Amy... Calm down, Amy.
Fucking damn it! What the fuck!?

977
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,649
I stole her desk.
You can check my urine.

978
01:28:43,816 --> 01:28:46,694
Check it Check my urine.

979
01:28:47,778 --> 01:28:51,031
Well its been another great year
here at JAMS.

980
01:28:51,907 --> 01:28:55,618
With summer round the corner, it's time to say
goodbye not only to another school year...

981
01:28:55,619 --> 01:28:58,497
But also to one of our own.

982
01:28:59,248 --> 01:29:05,545
Amy Squirrel, after six short years,
Amy is transferring out of the district.

983
01:29:05,546 --> 01:29:08,215
Speech, speech.
Well...

984
01:29:08,716 --> 01:29:13,429
Aaah! Wally thank you for those kind words,
and thank you all.

985
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:18,307
My decision that I made myself to leave
was super difficult.

986
01:29:18,308 --> 01:29:24,105
But when the superintendent personally ask you to work
at one of the worst school in the state?

987
01:29:24,106 --> 01:29:25,941
Well... you say 'YES'.

988
01:29:26,984 --> 01:29:33,239
Boy, I am looking forward to bringing
my brand of genie energy...

989
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,036
...to those under privilege students
at Malcolm X high school.

990
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:40,998
Thank you.

991
01:29:41,206 --> 01:29:48,881
Hey, Elizabeth..Listen, since Amy's transferring,
maybe the two of us can start over.

992
01:29:53,719 --> 01:29:59,808
Oh, hey there..Scott Delacorte. And you are?
Leaving.

993
01:30:15,908 --> 01:30:20,745
- Elizabeth?
- Here.

994
01:30:20,746 --> 01:30:24,750
- Sign my yearbook.
- Hold my ball sack

995
01:30:26,126 --> 01:30:29,922
I'll write my number down
just in case you need a lift...

996
01:30:29,963 --> 01:30:31,674
...after the surgery.

997
01:30:31,799 --> 01:30:34,968
For second, an extra set of hands to make sure
the implants are settling properly.

998
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:36,178
Thanks.

999
01:30:36,428 --> 01:30:40,348
Hey, aah!..You're not gonna teach
again next year, are you?

1000
01:30:40,349 --> 01:30:42,642
I don't know...
It's the only thing I'm good at

1001
01:30:42,643 --> 01:30:47,981
I'm just saying maybe... to consider doing
something else... like anything else.

1002
01:30:48,023 --> 01:30:51,527
Like any other job... in the entire world.

1003
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:58,200
You know? The two of us...
It's never gonna happen.

1004
01:30:59,076 --> 01:31:01,619
- Clearly?
- How would that even work?

1005
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:06,499
Where do you even live? In some weird
apartment with some creepy roommate?

1006
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:11,005
No, my creepy roommate moved out.
So now its just... just me... and the dogs.

1007
01:31:11,088 --> 01:31:12,965
How many dogs do you have?
Four.

1008
01:31:12,966 --> 01:31:16,217
Four dogs?
Four Dobermans.

1009
01:31:16,218 --> 01:31:18,344
Any family money?
Yea, you bet?

1010
01:31:18,345 --> 01:31:24,018
We're talking like three figures..
Almost 700 bucks.

1011
01:31:24,226 --> 01:31:27,687
So, basically, if I was gonna go out with you,
I would be making the conscious choice...

1012
01:31:27,688 --> 01:31:31,650
...to be dating a Gym Teacher
who lives in a shack with four dogs?

1013
01:31:31,692 --> 01:31:36,697
I prefer to think of it as two people
with amazing bodies...

1014
01:31:36,739 --> 01:31:39,949
sharing those bodies with each other.

1015
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:41,869
Giving each other the gift of these bodies.

1016
01:31:43,996 --> 01:31:49,793
Anyway, actually none of these really matters
Umm... I sort of... started seeing somebody.

1017
01:31:53,213 --> 01:31:57,634
Really that's... Congratulations
I didn't... I didn't realise that so...

1018
01:31:59,803 --> 01:32:04,600
- Those stupid... so...
- I'm just fucking with you.

1019
01:32:05,142 --> 01:32:08,187
Guess I deserve that one..?
Yea, you must certainly did

1020
01:32:08,312 --> 01:32:12,941
I think it's about time you realize,
that the whole world's just...

1021
01:32:20,866 --> 01:32:24,703
See you around Gym teacher.

1022
01:32:33,003 --> 01:32:38,509
Hey...
Let's do that again.

1023
01:32:43,472 --> 01:32:47,142
THREE MONTHS LATER.

1024
01:32:56,443 --> 01:33:00,029
Hey, Elizabeth.
Hey Lynn, how was your summer?

1025
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:03,616
Oh it was great. I went to the zoo
almost every weekend.

1026
01:33:03,617 --> 01:33:05,285
Wow!! Sounds great.

1027
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:08,789
Oh!... You didn't get your...
Your titties...?

1028
01:33:08,872 --> 01:33:11,667
Yea... I thought about it, you know
Cause I don't even need them.

1029
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:16,755
Plus they're really expensive, you know..per tit.
Yea, and you got to get two of them.

1030
01:33:18,549 --> 01:33:21,719
And I met a guy.
Oh! Tell me everything.

1031
01:33:21,844 --> 01:33:25,597
Did you find your Prince Charming?

1032
01:33:25,848 --> 01:33:29,893
Something like that.

1033
01:33:29,977 --> 01:33:33,939
Hey, you wanna grab lunch later?
Oh! Oh sure, yea, my treat.

1034
01:33:34,023 --> 01:33:36,692
Oh! You got it last time.
We'll split it. -Oh! Okay yeah.

1035
01:33:41,196 --> 01:33:45,868
Hey, you in the cape
You're up first. Let's go

1036
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:59,530
