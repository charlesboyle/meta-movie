1
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,600
Well, well,
Boris the Animal has a visitor.

2
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,060
I guess one every 40 years is okay.

3
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,560
It's a cake.

4
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,820
I decide what it is.

5
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,950
Looks like some kind of cake.

6
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,830
She's clean.
Well, not clean, but you know...

7
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,610
Oh, God.

8
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,420
Boris the Animal...

9
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,460
you've got a visitor.

10
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,000
It's just Boris.

11
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,850
Your letters have been
a soul-nourishing...

12
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,760
tonic.

13
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,640
And you are much more...

14
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,360
unconventionally handsome
than your photos.

15
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,120
This ain't a conjugal visit.

16
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,660
So quit your conjugating.

17
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,120
When's the last time
you conjugated anything?

18
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,630
I see you've brought me a treat,
darling.

19
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,920
Would you mind cutting this up
for us? It's a special day.

20
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,760
I'm a romantic like that.

21
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,470
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

22
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,310
Why's that?

23
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,230
It'll ruin your figure.

24
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,520
You complete me.

25
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,420
The big one.

26
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Boris! You promised
to take me with you!

27
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,970
We had a deal!

28
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,350
Obadiah Price.

29
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,140
Yes. I did make you a promise.

30
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,450
Wait. I smell something.

31
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,210
You can't win, Boris.

32
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,170
Let's agree to disagree.

33
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,250
There's too many of us.

34
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,170
Rather hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?

35
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,070
Sorry, darling.
We did love the cake.

36
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,390
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?

37
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,030
Good afternoon.

38
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,910
Please give your attention
to my associate, Agent J.

39
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,700
He's going to demonstrate
an electro-biomechanical...

40
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,500
neural-transmitting,
zero-synapse repositioner.

41
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,880
We call it the neuralyser.

42
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,340
- Keep it simple, slick.
- Thanks a lot.

43
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,630
Thank you, Agent K.

44
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you will look right here.

45
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,850
You know how you're on a plane and
you're asked to turn your phone off?

46
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,220
You're like, "I ain't turning it off.
Has nothing to do with a plane."

47
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,810
Well, this is what we get.
That's what happens.

48
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,190
It gets up there, bounces around
on the satellites and:

49
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,770
Just turn your damn phone off.

50
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,240
Now you're gonna drive off a cliff
tonight because your GPS don't work.

51
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,450
Check the composition
of the fuel units and surface deposits.

52
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,990
I wanna know who was driving.

53
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,580
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,950
- What are you gonna say tonight?
- Don't worry.

55
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,960
No, I'm very worried.
This is important.

56
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,830
- I'm hungry. You hungry?
- K.

57
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,670
Seriously,
I'm not even sure that's meat.

58
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,170
I think I just saw a tooth in that thing.
Or a claw. Or a hoof.

59
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,840
Thanks, Manny.

60
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,510
That does not belong in a pita,
it belongs in a casket.

61
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,890
What would go good with this
would be silence.

62
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,220
See, here's the problem.

63
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,560
You can't smell it...

64
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,810
because your nose already
smells like that, but my nose doesn't.

65
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,020
Silence goes good with a lot of things.
Ever try or is talking how you breathe?

66
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,860
Just say you hate me.
Don't take it out on the car.

67
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,400
Let me enjoy this.

68
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,200
Whoa, enjoyment.

69
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,740
So that's what enjoyment looks like
on that face. I like that emotion.

70
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,120
I keep emotion out of it.

71
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,790
Out of what, K? Life?

72
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,580
You don't wanna run it by me?

73
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,710
- Let me know what you'll say?
- Don't worry.

74
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,300
Oh, no, I'm worried. Very worried.

75
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,880
It's the man's eulogy.
You have to show some feeling.

76
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,590
That thing people do when they
change their facial expression?

77
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,850
I worked with Zed for 40 years.
A hell of an agent.

78
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,930
And I have written
a hell of a speech for him.

79
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,520
People will be moved.

80
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,500
And now a few words from Agent K.

81
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,920
I worked with Zed for over 40 years,
and in all that time...

82
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,710
he never invited me to dinner.

83
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,630
He never asked me to his house
to watch a game.

84
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,890
He never shared a single detail
of his personal life.

85
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,310
Yeah, he was weird.

86
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,730
Thank you.

87
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,940
And now we will hear from
our new chief, Agent O.

88
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,410
Thank you, Agent K.
That was very moving.

89
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,700
- That was your eulogy?
- He was a good man.

90
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,000
Ladies, gentlemen, other life forms.

91
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,170
When I told the Finucian Zyglot
about Zed's passing...

92
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,590
she said something
that I'm going to repeat.

93
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,800
And I'm paraphrasing.

94
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,450
That's just so Zed.

95
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,660
Thank you.

96
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,340
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

97
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,090
Can you promise, if I go first, you'll
do better than that at my funeral?

98
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,300
You know, something like:

99
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,350
"J was a friend."

100
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,520
Now there's a big part of me
that's gone.

101
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,020
Oh, J, all the things
that I should have said...

102
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,440
except I was too old...

103
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,400
and craggy and surly...

104
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,860
and just tight. I was too...

105
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,570
tight.

106
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,660
"I'm gonna just miss
your caramel-brown skin."

107
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,530
I'll wing something.

108
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,620
K, it's O. We have reports
of several humans suffering from...

109
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,540
intestinal worms of alien origin.

110
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,750
Thank you, O.

111
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,090
How did you get to be like you?

112
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,050
Something happened, K.
What happened?

113
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,300
You know how I live
such a happy life?

114
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,350
How you live such a happy life?

115
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,430
I don't ask questions
I don't want to know the answer to.

116
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,180
That's deep.

117
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,740
Jeffrey.

118
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,330
Do I know you?

119
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,000
Your services are legendary.
So says your father, Obadiah.

120
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,830
You were in Lunar-Max.

121
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,590
There is no prison that can hold me.

122
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,130
Cool for you.
What do you need from me, man?

123
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,590
The device.

124
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,350
I'm going back in time to kill a man
before he takes my arm.

125
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,780
K, J!

126
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,530
So happy to see you.
Mr. Wu get you your regular table?

127
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,130
You no hungry?

128
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,380
Show us the tanks, Wu.

129
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,800
Oh, sure, sure. You look.
Very fresh.

130
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,720
Show us the tanks in the back.

131
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,180
So sorry. No speak English.
You come back later, okay?

132
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,640
Save the chop-socky bullshit
for the tourists, Wu.

133
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,390
Hey, what you guys
wanna bust my balls for, huh?

134
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,100
You don't have no balls.

135
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,320
Man, you look like
you come from the planet...

136
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,570
Damn.

137
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,620
And Bob here is a clear violation
of Health Ordinance 32:

138
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,160
Selling unlicenced extraterrestrial...

139
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,750
foodstuffs.

140
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,330
That is an Earth fish.

141
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,000
Very traditional in China.
You arrest me...

142
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,210
that's a hate crime!

143
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,380
It would be...

144
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,130
if you were Chinese.

145
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,720
K, come on. I got larvae to feed.

146
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,050
Who is the Spiky Bulba for?

147
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,140
Nobody.

148
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,310
Who's it for?

149
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,470
I keep them in case!

150
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,020
- In case what?
- I don't know!

151
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,100
Anybody!

152
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,560
All right, you slug.

153
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,650
Wu...

154
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,400
he and I are having issues right now,
but you shouldn't suffer for that.

155
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,280
Thank you, J.

156
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,570
So if you don't like getting
fish-slapped, keep to our agreement.

157
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,370
Earth people get Earth fish.
Real Earth fish.

158
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,950
On behalf of my pathetic self
and worthless children, you stay.

159
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,670
Allow me most honourable benefit
of serving you favourite noodles, K?

160
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,710
Don't nobody want your
nasty-ass noodles.

161
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,590
You're a piece of shit, Wu.

162
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,920
Shrimp and bok choy.

163
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,630
We're gonna be here for a while.

164
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,110
That was just mean.

165
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,690
What you did to Wu back there.

166
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,700
Snatched his skirt off.

167
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,870
That's just disrespectful.

168
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,870
I used to play a game
with my dad:

169
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,750
What'll You Have
For Your Last Meal.

170
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,370
You could do worse than this.

171
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,880
Okay.

172
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,800
I played a game with my dad...

173
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,010
called catch.

174
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,670
Except I'd throw the ball
and it'd just hit the wall...

175
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,180
because he wasn't there.

176
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,220
Don't badmouth your old man.

177
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,020
I'm not badmouthing him.
I just didn't really know him.

178
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,730
It's not right.

179
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,940
Damn right it's not.
A boy needs a father.

180
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,310
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.
Table three...

181
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,230
just drank his fourth cup...

182
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,690
of duck sauce.

183
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,110
K, the crashed ship...

184
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,990
from this morning
was stolen from...

185
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,820
Lunar-Max.

186
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,950
Boris the Animal.

187
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,160
How did you know?

188
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,790
He has a taste for Spiky Bulba.

189
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,500
Give us a minute, chief.

190
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,380
We're in a situation.

191
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,290
Oh, yeah.

192
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,510
I take the Chloropod.

193
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,800
You take the Tarantabee.

194
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,420
And the Hydronian over there.

195
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,680
I'll take the kitchen.

196
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,470
Meet you on the street.

197
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,430
This is a very confusing time...

198
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,890
in my life.

199
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,660
Hey.

200
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,890
Keep your mouth closed,
keep your head down.

201
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,560
Hello, K.

202
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,810
Boris the Animal.

203
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,560
It's just Boris.

204
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,820
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.

205
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,410
Yes, my arm.

206
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,990
We've thought about that moment...

207
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,700
every day for the last 40 years.

208
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,910
Well, that's just not living a full life.

209
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,790
I can promise you
it will be longer than yours.

210
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,670
Lonelier too. Since you're
the last Boglodite standing.

211
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,670
We'll see about that.

212
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,590
But first,
I want the pleasure of killing you.

213
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,890
Yo, K.

214
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
- Where the hell have you been?
- Fishing.

215
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,000
You don't know it, K,
but you're already dead.

216
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,090
You all right?

217
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
May I have everyone's attention,
please?

218
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,730
Thank you.

219
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,980
You know how your kid won
the goldfish in that little baggie...

220
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,740
from the fair and you didn't
want it in your house...

221
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,360
so you told your kid it ran away
when you flushed it down the toilet?

222
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,030
Well, this is what happens.

223
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,410
Okay? See what I'm talking about?
Don't lie to your kids.

224
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,290
Man, I am getting too old for this.

225
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,800
I can only imagine how you feel.

226
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,050
Boris the Animal.

227
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,590
I put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.

228
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,850
Why? Was he innocent?

229
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,930
Should have killed him.

230
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,100
- Well, shit, let's go get him.
- No.

231
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,060
- No.
- Leave it alone.

232
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,440
It's above your pay grade.

233
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,360
We have the same pay grade.

234
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,440
It has nothing to do with you.
Mind your own business.

235
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,570
Okay, first of all, let's get a little bit
of that bass out your voice.

236
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,290
Secondly, as long as Spikey Boy is
running around, this is my business.

237
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,830
You forget about Boris
or my report will reflect...

238
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that your conduct
has been unbecoming.

239
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Well, maybe my report
is gonna reflect some shit too, K.

240
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,170
- You are suspended for two weeks.
- Bullshit.

241
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,300
Four weeks.

242
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,550
How about I quit?

243
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,970
There are things out there
you don't need to know.

244
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,180
That's not the lie you told me
when you recruited me.

245
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,150
What up, pops?

246
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,990
- Lose your partner?
- Yeah.

247
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,820
Next shuttle to Afazumba...

248
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,870
leaving in 22 minutes.

249
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,970
Search...

250
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,130
Boris the Animal.

251
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,550
Boris the Animal,
Boglodite assassin.

252
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,510
Boglodites were a rogue alien race...

253
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
that consumed all planets
in their path.

254
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,730
Boris the Animal
was the only suspect...

255
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,060
in a series of alien murders
on Earth.

256
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,190
Incident report.

257
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,900
Boris the Animal was convicted...

258
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,900
for the following murders
that occurred on July 15,1969.

259
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,660
Murder number one: Coney Island,
10:37 a.m. Roman the Fabulist.

260
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,950
Murder number two: The Factory.

261
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,780
Refine search.

262
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,830
Agent K.

263
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,450
Junior Agent K apprehended
and arrested...

264
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,170
Boris the Animal on July 16,1969,
at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

265
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,750
- Cape Canaveral...
- Agent K...

266
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,380
received highest commendation
for heroic action...

267
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,880
including implementation...

268
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,720
of the Arc Net Defence System...

269
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,390
which protected the Earth
from Boglodite invasion...

270
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,260
and led to the race's extinction.

271
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,430
Details.

272
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,020
Access restricted.

273
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,480
Excuse me? Clearance level
senior agent, class one. J.

274
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,860
Access denied.

275
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,520
What?

276
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,250
So why this sudden interest
in your partner's old exploits?

277
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,340
What happened between Boris and K?

278
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,420
That's easy.

279
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,630
K imprisoned Boris.
He put up the Arc Net.

280
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,340
He protected the Earth
from the Boglodites.

281
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,100
He did his job.

282
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,930
That's not what I'm asking.

283
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,770
Cape Canaveral, what happened?

284
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,730
Something that changed him.

285
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,020
Leave it at that.

286
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,320
So you two go way back, huh?

287
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,570
That's classified.

288
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,330
A word of advice, Agent J.

289
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,120
Don't ask questions
you don't want to know the answer to.

290
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,630
That's funny.
That is exactly what K said.

291
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,550
He's a very wise man.

292
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,050
Take the rest of the night off.

293
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,490
What?

294
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,240
Guess I owe you some answers,
hoss.

295
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,410
What, you're feeling chatty
all of a sudden?

296
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,370
I can't talk right now. I've got secret
cases of my own I'm working on.

297
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,790
I hate to tear you away
from your video game.

298
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,880
All right, I'm hanging up.

299
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,500
You know the most destructive force
in the universe?

300
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,130
Sugar?

301
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,130
Regret.

302
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,390
You don't have to wait. Just talk.

303
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,180
I promised you the secrets
of the universe. Nothing more.

304
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,350
So there's secrets out there
the universe don't know about?

305
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,140
Mommy.

306
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,950
Can I help you?

307
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,660
K?

308
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,830
5K.

309
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,840
I'm sorry, is that chocolate milk?

310
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,880
Can I...? I'm so sorry.
I don't know what...

311
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,890
Mommy, the president is drinking...

312
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,310
my milk.

313
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,430
I'm sorry.

314
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,980
He didn't say please.

315
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,460
- K get in yet?
- Who?

316
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,500
You new?

317
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,340
Very funny, Agent J.

318
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,260
J, everything you told me yesterday,
you were right as rain.

319
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,020
- Thank God for that 10-hour stakeout.
- Who are you?

320
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,890
Exactly.
I feel like a whole new man today.

321
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,860
Like this great weight has been lifted.
I've had anger issues my entire life...

322
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,610
but now I see I was mad at myself.
And my stepmom.

323
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,780
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stop talking.

324
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,240
It's like I closed
this emotional window.

325
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,450
But I threw a brick
through that window.

326
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,490
Thank you for handing me
that brick, J.

327
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,330
Whoever you are, give me five feet
or I'll pluck you in your throat.

328
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,460
I'm gonna go
to the little Men's-in-Black room...

329
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,170
then we'll go find those morons
from Pox Ethera. Lunch is on me.

330
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,050
Who was that?

331
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,130
Double A? Your partner.

332
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,220
I need you to go get me some
chocolate milk, all right?

333
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,060
Just a really big glass.
Have you seen K?

334
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,770
Did he call in sick or anything?

335
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,400
Who's K?

336
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,820
All right, all right,
go ahead, go ahead.

337
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,730
K!

338
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,150
All right.

339
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,820
You got me.

340
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,240
I'll give it to you.
It's funny, very elaborate.

341
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,580
Oh, and all of you,
fantastic performances.

342
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,450
You waited 14 years
to develop a sense of humour...

343
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,330
but this is a good one.

344
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,330
But I need you
to come out here now...

345
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,920
because I'm starting
to get a little pissed off.

346
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,380
Agent J, would you mind
keeping your voice down...

347
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,420
and telling me
who you're looking for?

348
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,720
I'm looking for K.

349
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,550
Who is K?

350
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,010
You too? You too.

351
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,140
I mean, who is he to you?

352
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,430
My partner.

353
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,100
Older gentleman, 110...

354
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,310
maybe 111 years old.

355
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,440
Sort of a surly, Elvis thing happening
with him. He smiles like this.

356
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,740
Seen him around?

357
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,740
I'll take you to K.

358
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,740
Thank you.

359
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,540
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's K.

360
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,800
He's been dead for over 40 years.

361
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,380
Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke
is that it be funny.

362
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,300
It's never been funny.

363
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,980
Computer, Agent K
and Boris the Animal.

364
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,860
Men in Black incident report,
July, 1969.

365
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,190
Location, Cape Canaveral.

366
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,730
Perpetrator Boris the Animal
escaped and fled Earth.

367
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,150
Assumed to have returned to planet
Boglodotia 20 light-years away.

368
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,660
Agent K pronounced dead at scene.
Awarded posthumous commendation...

369
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,740
for action which prevented
greater loss of human life.

370
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,410
That's not what happened.

371
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,540
I looked at this report.
K put Boris away...

372
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,670
- Agent K is dead.
- Well, I just talked to him last night.

373
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,250
- You are imagining.
- I'm not.

374
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,380
- I need a psych team up here.
- Yes, ma'am.

375
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,380
Aqua Velva aftershave.
I didn't imagine that.

376
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,100
Every stakeout,
endless hours of cowboy music.

377
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,310
Every morning with his coffee...

378
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,100
he'd say, "I tell you something, slick.
This coffee tastes like dirt."

379
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,480
And I was supposed to say,
"What do you expect?

380
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,440
- It was ground this morning."
- "This morning."

381
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,320
How do you know that?

382
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,860
Chocolate milk, sir?

383
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,530
Where you been, man?
It was like an hour ago.

384
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,870
Wait.

385
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,910
How long have you been craving
chocolatised dairy products?

386
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,450
Just today.

387
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,250
Are you experiencing headaches?
Dizziness?

388
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,920
Loss of balance?

389
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,590
Agitation? Depression?

390
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,920
Hell, yeah.

391
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,670
Two possibilities.
One is you've been bitten...

392
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,340
by a Hovartian brain tick...

393
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,970
and could die in horrible agony
at any moment.

394
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,390
Damn it. It's not the tick.

395
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,520
"Damn it, it's not the tick"?

396
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,350
It's something worse than the tick?

397
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,020
Your obsession
with chocolate milk indicates...

398
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,780
that you might be involved
in a temporal fracture.

399
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,780
I don't know
what you're talking about.

400
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,370
Chocolate milk relieves
temporal-fracture headaches.

401
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,200
What's a temporal fracture?

402
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,370
A break in the timeline.

403
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,490
Don't know what you mean.

404
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,500
Time travel! Time travel.

405
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,870
There's no such thing
as time travel.

406
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,710
- Well, there is.
- No.

407
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,960
There's not.

408
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,550
Because if there were...

409
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,720
a class-one senior agent
such as myself...

410
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,430
would have been aware of it,
wouldn't he have?

411
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,140
Were it not classified
and way above his pay grade.

412
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,510
You know, I need a raise.

413
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,270
There was one man, scumbag,
Obadiah Price.

414
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,480
He figured it out, we busted him,
we made time travel illegal...

415
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,190
throughout the universe
and he is serving life on Lunar-Max.

416
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,110
No... That's where Boris
was locked up.

417
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,360
If Boris worked out
how to time jump...

418
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,240
he could seriously change
the course of history.

419
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,620
Attention.
Early warning system engaged.

420
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,750
Inbound hostile warships
entering solar system.

421
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,960
Boglodite markings
and language detected.

422
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,590
Boglodite. Boris is a Boglodite,
but they're extinct.

423
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,050
Apparently not.

424
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,180
Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.

425
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,050
Put up the Arc Net.

426
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,930
- The what?
- The Arc Net. The defence system.

427
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,770
K got it for the Boglodites.

428
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,520
There is no K.

429
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,980
He's been dead for over 40 years.

430
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,780
No K. No defence system.

431
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,690
Boris jumped back and killed him.

432
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,780
If you wanna save the world,
stop that from happening.

433
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,620
You have to find Jeffrey Price.
He's Obadiah's son.

434
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,290
Let's hope the little squirt
hasn't skipped town.

435
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,420
- Good luck, J!
- This planet's toast.

436
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,640
How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale...

437
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,480
on batteries.

438
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,270
Okay, we got other stuff,
like headphones, adapters or...

439
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,400
You helped Boris the Animal
time jump.

440
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,650
Okay, I had to. That dude's a freak.

441
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
He killed my partner.

442
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,360
I want to know when
and where you sent him.

443
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,870
What, you think I keep,
like, a logbook?

444
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,460
Target vector, July 16...

445
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,540
...1969.
- All right.

446
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,460
That's a real bummer
about your buddy.

447
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,090
I'm sure he was a great guy.

448
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,300
But in terms of
the space-time continuum...

449
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,090
your friend was a little blip
on the historical radar!

450
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,930
That's a big blip.

451
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,150
- Okay. What's the plan?
- You're gonna send me...

452
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,230
back to July 15th, 1969.

453
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,190
No, that's a stupid plan,
because I sent Boris to July 16th.

454
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,240
I'm not worried about that one.
I'll kill the younger Boris...

455
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,860
before the older one shows.

456
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,490
That way, neither of them
will even exist.

457
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,490
That's why you get to wear
the black suit.

458
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,910
No?

459
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,210
You're gonna leave me hanging?
Okay.

460
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,880
Oh, I just thought of something.
Even back then...

461
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,130
New York was like a big-ish city.

462
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,210
So how are you
gonna really find him?

463
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,840
On July 15th, Boris killed an alien,
Roman the Fabulist, at Coney Island.

464
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,180
You're gonna get there first
and be waiting?

465
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,470
Dude, they should give you
two black suits.

466
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,890
My man, for real?

467
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,930
Oh, right.

468
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,350
Sorry.

469
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,520
This...

470
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,110
is the real deal. Time-jump gear.

471
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,980
Very rare, very old.

472
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,320
But first, we gotta get high.

473
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,860
Hey. No.

474
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,700
No. No, I mean, really high.

475
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,600
Hey, man? A little help here?

476
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,640
Thank you.

477
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,690
Okay.

478
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,860
- You know the rules of time jumps?
- Give me the short version.

479
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,820
Okay. You wanna save your partner,
word of advice:

480
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,530
Stay away from him.

481
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,200
Yeah, got it. Stay away from K.
Just kill Boris.

482
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,200
Now, take these.

483
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,120
It gets pretty windy
on the way down.

484
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,500
The way down?

485
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,000
With eyes tearing up,
it's hard to read the dial.

486
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,580
Plus, it helps you look like a real
time traveller, which is cool.

487
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,840
I am not jumping off of this building!

488
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,880
Time jump.

489
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:16,920
Okay, now...

490
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,880
I gotta set this thing...

491
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,640
to the 15th.

492
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,850
That seems...

493
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,020
right-ish.

494
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,060
Now...

495
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,690
all you gotta do is jump.

496
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,270
Hey, hey, stop. Stop it.

497
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,150
When you're moving fast enough...

498
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,860
that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green time-travel liquid...

499
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,780
and it's gonna glow really bright.

500
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,580
As soon as that happens,
break that blue laser line...

501
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,700
with your thumb
to complete the circuit.

502
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,910
At this height, that should be...

503
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,000
Let's see, mass of Earth
and 30-something feet per minute...

504
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,630
It's 32 feet per second. Per second.

505
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,750
That sounds right-ish.

506
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,260
So that would be, I guess,
about two feet off the ground.

507
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,720
I break the laser line?

508
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,890
No, don't break it!

509
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,010
- No, when I'm fast enough!
- Sounds good!

510
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,100
Do I break the laser line
or do I not break the laser line?

511
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,270
Do not lose that time device...

512
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,400
or you will be stuck in 1969!

513
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,400
It wasn't the best time
for your people.

514
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,610
I'm just saying.
It's, like, a lot cooler now.

515
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,320
How will I know if it works?

516
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,330
You'll either know...

517
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,830
or you won't.

518
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,210
You must really love this guy
to do this.

519
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,420
Oh, wait. How come I remember K,
but nobody else does?

520
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,180
- That means you were there!
- I was where?

521
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,310
If you survive, you gotta come back
and tell me everything.

522
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,140
Where was I?

523
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,810
You gotta go!

524
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,770
Just go, go, go!

525
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,090
Oh, no!

526
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,810
Come on!

527
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,740
- My man, what's today?
- Tuesday.

528
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,410
- The date?
- The 15th.

529
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,160
- Of?
- July.

530
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,460
- Dog, the year.
- 1969.

531
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,250
Thank you.

532
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,880
Look at me like I'm crazy.

533
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,350
Far out.

534
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,980
Jerry rocked Haight-Ashbury
like you wouldn't believe.

535
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,280
Okay, we're here.

536
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,990
- Happy?
- You're such a pill, Fred.

537
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,660
- Get us checked in.
- Yeah, yeah.

538
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,540
Hey. Hey, do me a favour, all right?

539
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,920
- Be careful with the luggage.
- Absolutely, sir.

540
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,250
I paid a lot of money
for that luggage.

541
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,960
- We'll take good care...
- Last time, it got scuffed up.

542
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,590
Here you go, sir.
Just call down when you need it.

543
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,220
There's more in the trunk.

544
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,520
Yeah, it'll be in your room, sir.
Just go in.

545
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,600
Excuse me. Excuse me, who is that?
Who are you?

546
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,900
Let's go!

547
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,960
Far out, man!

548
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,880
If you want to keep that, I wouldn't.

549
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,630
Make love, not war.

550
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,180
I prefer to do both.

551
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,930
How are you, officers?
What can I do you for?

552
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,180
Well, look at this.
Power windows, power seats.

553
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,470
- I'll bet you it cost 6 grand.
- Yeah.

554
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,980
Yes, and it has a roof,
but it's hidden.

555
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,020
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

556
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,480
An individual of your...

557
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,570
particular ethnic persuasion?

558
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,490
Maybe he's a noted athlete.

559
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,080
Yes. Starting forward
for the Detroit Darkies.

560
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,490
- Where'd you get the car?
- And the suit?

561
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,370
I stole them both.
Car from your wife...

562
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,370
suit from your grandmother.

563
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:07,880
Hey.

564
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,880
What do we have here?
Concealed weapon?

565
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,760
Hey, it's his grandmother's suit.

566
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,920
- Hey, what's this?
- Probably drugs.

567
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,390
I have rights
and I demand to see my lawyer...

568
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,470
before you press that small button
on the side firmly.

569
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,310
Press it.

570
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,650
That, gentlemen,
is a standard-issue neuralyser.

571
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,270
You're not gonna remember that.

572
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,190
And just because you see
a black man driving a nice car...

573
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,650
does not mean it's stolen.

574
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:42,200
I stole that one.
But not because I'm black.

575
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,920
I'll be done
with the car in a minute!

576
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,670
Just find it and take it back
to the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.

577
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,480
Where is the Archanan?

578
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,730
You are too late.

579
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,570
He is going to give the humans...

580
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,400
the Arc Net.

581
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,530
Let's agree to disagree.

582
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,640
We'll take it from here.

583
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,440
K?

584
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,110
K! K!

585
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,040
Dad, I'm on Earth.

586
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,840
I need bail.

587
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,390
Will the owner of a blue
warp-speed cruiser...

588
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,980
please report to the front desk.

589
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,480
You need to turn the electricity
down on that damn thing.

590
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,820
Can't taste my f ricking tongue, K.

591
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,110
How do you know my name?

592
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,450
What? Because I called you "K"?

593
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,740
No, I call everybody K.

594
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,660
It's kind of my thing.

595
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,000
What up, K?

596
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,460
All right, I sort of...

597
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,880
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
I just... Some people like it.

598
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,170
Most people.

599
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,970
Now that I know what you look like...

600
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,760
when you're lying, show me...

601
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,300
what you look like
when you're telling the truth?

602
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,680
I won those at Coney island
on the ring toss.

603
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,270
I won a stuffed bear once,
but never one of these.

604
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,310
Must be good, slick.

605
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,190
All right, sir,
I was minding my own business.

606
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,530
I was waiting for my girl,
who, by the way...

607
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,320
is probably worried sick
looking for me right now.

608
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,490
So I just need my things
and I need to get back to her.

609
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,570
What's her name?

610
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,410
Your gal, what's her name?

611
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,210
Schtaron?

612
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,920
I bet Schtaron
likes that suit of yours.

613
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,760
What, it's a crime
to wear a black suit?

614
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,800
All right, listen.
I haven't done anything wrong.

615
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,430
And I need to get out of here.
I cannot be with you.

616
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,770
Terribly sorry. X is frightfully upset
about the whole Coney Island incident.

617
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,440
Thanks for the heads-up.

618
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,820
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt.

619
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,740
- What do you expect? It was...
- Just ground this morning.

620
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,490
O?

621
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,660
No, I call ladies "O."

622
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,870
To me, O is feminine,
K is masculine.

623
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,540
You know, I see a couple,
I'm like, "O-K."

624
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,090
What a mess. Any casualties?

625
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,170
Yes, Roman the Fabulist.

626
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,590
Any human casualties?

627
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,890
No, sir.

628
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,180
Who the hell is this?

629
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,770
Look, I was...

630
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,940
- Stray human caught in the net.
- Code 43 him and throw him back.

631
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,190
You're late for a meeting
with the Viagrans.

632
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,480
They have a revolutionary new pill.

633
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,820
It's really...

634
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:44,690
Okay, slick.

635
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,660
I was waiting for my girl.

636
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,870
Schtaron.

637
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,700
Yes, she's Greek.

638
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:58,210
Okay. Just one last thing.
An eye exam.

639
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,430
That's not an eye exam, K.
That's a big-ass neuralyser!

640
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,760
You have a lot of information for
a fella who doesn't know anything.

641
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,300
I see what you're saying.

642
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,850
You know, K,
we need to hold up a second.

643
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,230
K!

644
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,770
Let's get this bite guard in here.

645
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,690
Hey, back up, back up.

646
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,610
K, listen, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, all right?

647
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,110
So let's just stop for a second
and talk.

648
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,990
Don't put me in here, K!

649
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,320
Too late, hoss.

650
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,490
K, no, listen to me.
I can help you with this case!

651
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:34,790
K!

652
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,330
I'm doing the truth face!
You're missing it!

653
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,330
I'll just use my imagination.

654
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,750
K, the killer...

655
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,630
you're looking for, I'm after
the same guy. A Boglodite.

656
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,840
His name is Boris.

657
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,140
Ship has sailed, amigo.

658
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,050
If we don't get him, there'll be two.

659
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,140
You had my undivided attention.

660
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,430
One will have one arm...

661
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,310
and one's gonna have two. K!

662
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,810
Listen to me!

663
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,940
If you erase me...

664
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,350
you erase the world!

665
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,230
Fifteen seconds...

666
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,610
to neuralysation. Fourteen.

667
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,450
Thirteen. Twelve.

668
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,530
Eleven. Ten. Nine.

669
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,620
When you see Boris tomorrow, K,
kill him. Do not arrest him, kill him!

670
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,830
Four. Three. Two.

671
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,260
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K!

672
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,760
It's whirring and buzzing.

673
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,890
I don't know if I don't know nothing.

674
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,270
I knew Roman.

675
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,320
His wife cooked me dinner once.
While it was not pleasant...

676
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,980
he was my friend.

677
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,150
Last chance, who are you
and what do you know?

678
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,330
I'm an agent...

679
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,120
from the future. We're partners.

680
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,960
In 25 years, you'll recruit me...

681
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,210
and 14 years after that,
the guy you didn't let me kill today...

682
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,380
escapes from prison,
jumps to the past...

683
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,210
and unleashes an invasion of Earth.
We got about 19 hours to kill him...

684
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,050
so, really, we need to go right now.

685
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:20,770
All right.

686
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,230
So that's the story you believe.

687
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,440
That one was the truth.

688
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,700
Wasn't the whole truth,
but it'll do for now.

689
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,990
What are you talking about?
Of course it's the whole truth.

690
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,370
The problem with a lie is once
you start lying you put yourself...

691
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,920
Agent K.

692
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,790
What's he still doing here?

693
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,800
I might have cooked him too long.
Thought I'd walk him out.

694
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,800
I put my pants on.

695
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,010
Okay, future man, where to?

696
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,600
I don't know.

697
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,770
What do you mean?

698
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,810
I don't know.
Go wherever you went last time.

699
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,400
I haven't been here.
I didn't tell you where I went?

700
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,990
No. I mean, we don't really talk.

701
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,330
What kind of partners sit in a car
every day for 14 years and don't talk?

702
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,080
Exactly. And this is the type
of problem it causes.

703
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,290
It's dysfunctional.

704
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,630
All right, sport, you better get useful
real quick or you go back in room 43.

705
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,340
Man...

706
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,640
There was something in the file
about a factory.

707
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,970
Something happened at a factory.

708
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,810
Hey, look, man, you can put
your Jedi Knight on me all you want.

709
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,230
That's all I got.

710
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,650
That spark something?

711
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,530
Roman had this on his person
when he was murdered.

712
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,700
It's a matchbook.

713
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,740
No, it's a clue.

714
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,580
He didn't smoke.

715
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,150
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

716
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:36,900
No.

717
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,360
Hey, man, how old are you?

718
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:43,080
Twenty-nine.

719
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,500
You got some city miles on you.

720
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,290
I'm starting to understand
why we don't talk.

721
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:58,880
- How well do you know this place?
- I know its reputation.

722
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,010
I don't like it. I hate going in blind.
I'm gonna need my gun.

723
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,430
Sure thing, slick.

724
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,020
K! Wait, no, I gotta go in
with you!

725
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,980
You sit tight. I'll be fine.

726
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,310
Wait, no! No!

727
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,270
K!

728
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,150
K, don't go in by yourself!

729
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,700
Hi, fellas.

730
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,370
Need to see the boss.

731
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,870
He's busy.

732
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,080
Well, I'm gonna just
take a look around.

733
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,210
Looks like we have ourselves
a standoff.

734
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,340
Looks that way.

735
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,470
- Still keep the key under the ashtray.
- Lucky guess.

736
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,180
Now, where were we?

737
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,230
I was about to tell you to screw off.

738
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:51,270
Hey, slick, you bowl in the future?

739
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,610
MiB league champ,
three years running.

740
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,440
Well, let's see it.

741
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,650
You did not walk into my...

742
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,610
establishment
and rip my head off!

743
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,280
My man, we don't have a lot of time.
You really need to tell him something.

744
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,120
I'll tell him this!

745
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,280
All right, your head.

746
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:10,460
Wait. Hey, if you do this,
I am gonna hunt you down...

747
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,790
and make sure you...

748
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,460
walk funny for the rest...

749
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,710
of your miserable last days
on Earth!

750
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,800
Tough spare, slick.

751
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,210
You messed with the wrong head!

752
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,550
- His head's a little...
- You gonna tell us...

753
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,220
where Dom is?

754
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,680
I'll kill you both.
I'll kill both of youse!

755
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,270
Your hook's a little off.
Want me to clean her?

756
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,060
- Sure thing.
- No, no, no.

757
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:35,980
Come on, I just cleaned
the bathroom with this thing!

758
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,440
No cleaning! No cleaning!

759
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:41,610
Okay! Okay, all right!
All right, he's in the back.

760
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,360
But he's not gonna talk
to Men in Black scum like you.

761
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,200
Now give me back my head.

762
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,740
K, I call this one
"Low Hanging Fruit."

763
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,200
That ain't a finger hole...

764
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,080
you sick bastard!

765
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,420
I'll pop your head off...

766
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,960
and see how you like it.

767
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,840
I'm gonna kill both of you!

768
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,300
I'm gonna kill the both of youse!

769
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,970
I'll kill you both!

770
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,430
- Well, we're on the right track.
- Just the wrong train.

771
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,140
If he had any secrets...

772
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:13,810
I'm guessing he spilled them.

773
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,350
A smart man figures out
what victims have in common.

774
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,020
A smart man would.

775
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,610
That's a big-ass phone.

776
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,860
- Don't put that up to your head.
- Agent O.

777
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:25,450
How's your day been, Agent K?

778
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:26,740
Fair to middling.

779
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,910
How are things going?

780
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,280
Very good, thank you.

781
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,200
Hey, you saw her like an hour ago.

782
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,580
I need cleanup and containment
at Cosmic Lanes.

783
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,670
Listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.

784
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,540
Now Roman was a Byvoid,
correct me if I'm wrong...

785
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:42,340
...from the same planetary grouping?
- A system in the Triangulum Galaxy...

786
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,760
wiped out by Boglodites.

787
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,130
Wasn't the third planet...?

788
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,050
- Glamouria?
- Glamouria.

789
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,800
Thank you, Miss O.

790
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,390
I know where Boris
is headed to next.

791
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,150
You were close, slick.
It's not a factory, it's the Factory.

792
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,070
Look, if Boris turns out
to be here, I'm gonna kill him...

793
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,780
...I need my gun.
- No deal.

794
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,200
I've been an agent for 14 years.

795
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:14,910
Which means I'm the senior agent
on this case. Now, I hate to pull rank...

796
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,120
but I am instructing
my junior agent...

797
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,210
that's you, to give me my gun
right now. That's an order.

798
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,640
No, no, no, space gun.

799
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,220
You're welcome.

800
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,680
I didn't say thank you.

801
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,270
For such an ungainly species,
they've thrived on Earth.

802
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,020
I was an agent for three years...

803
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,230
before I realised
all models were aliens.

804
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,570
Found out the hard way.

805
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:48,700
Password?

806
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,530
Hey, look, funky '60s dude,
we don't have a lot of time.

807
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,990
Janis Joplin.

808
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,710
Is there anybody here
who's not an alien?

809
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,130
Very nice.

810
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,930
Blink. That's good.

811
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,050
Look in the camera.

812
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,260
Is that Andy Warhol?

813
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,350
Yep.

814
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,610
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol,
could we have a minute?

815
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,990
Now is not a good time.
This is a be-in.

816
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,320
Just a few...

817
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,740
questions.

818
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,070
No questions. No answers.

819
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,870
Just being.

820
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,450
We have an urgent matter
to discuss with you...

821
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,460
regarding one
of your party guests.

822
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,290
Why don't you come back...

823
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,460
next week, after the happening...

824
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,420
has happened.

825
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,430
Sorry, Mr. Warhol. You like
talking slow. We got stuff to do.

826
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,800
I've got a planet to save.

827
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,390
You're distressing. Everything...

828
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,140
about you upsets me.

829
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,020
Damn it, K!
Are you trying to blow my cover?

830
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,900
Agent W, your cover is safe.

831
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,900
Whoa, Andy Warhol is one of us?

832
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:06,900
Safe?

833
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,070
You out of your mind?
I'm so out of ideas...

834
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,450
I'm painting cans
and bananas for chrissakes.

835
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,370
Actually, Mr. Warhol,
I gotta tell you, I love your work.

836
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,870
Oh, thank you.

837
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:16,950
Who's the dumb-ass?

838
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,290
How about a little
professional courtesy here?

839
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,750
- Dumb-ass.
- Say it again.

840
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,080
- Want me to?
- I dare you.

841
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,040
Dumb-ass.

842
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,880
- Agents.
- I have no problem...

843
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,380
pimp-slapping the shiznit
out of Andy Warhol.

844
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:29,710
What?

845
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,550
Why are you looking at me?

846
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,640
Oh, all right. You know what?
Agent K...

847
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,480
you see what information
you can get from Agent W...

848
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:46,860
and I'll go case the perimeter.

849
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,730
- That work for everybody?
- Go do that.

850
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,360
- How about that?
- Oh, cute.

851
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,400
- Okay.
- Very nice.

852
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,990
Someone forget his nap?

853
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,670
Hey, how you doing?

854
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,290
Chilling.

855
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,260
Who's that guy?

856
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,180
Don't tell me he's your new partner.

857
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,930
Actually, he's my old partner.
He travelled back from the future...

858
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,220
Stop, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

859
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,180
Andy, Yoko's here.

860
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,650
Tell her that I'm filming this man
eating a hamburger.

861
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,400
It's transcendent.

862
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,990
All right, now the pickle.

863
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,750
What are you doing on my turf?

864
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,500
Tracking a killer. Boglodite.

865
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,210
We believe he's gonna
hit here next, a Glamourian.

866
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,420
Glamourian?
Right solar system, wrong planet.

867
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,130
He's gotta be after the Archanan.

868
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,550
Archanans are extinct.

869
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,640
Apparently not.
One washed ashore last week.

870
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:01,970
The whole Roswell circuit's
all abuzz about it.

871
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,560
Alien unicorn. Last of its species.

872
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,270
His name's Griffin.

873
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,810
Griffin the Archanan.

874
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,610
How's it going?

875
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,240
Going? How's it going? That depends.
For me, personally, things are good.

876
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,900
Unless we're in the future...

877
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,410
where the muscle boy argues
with his girlfriend.

878
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,450
She storms off and bumps the guy
with the stuffed mushrooms...

879
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,700
who dumps the tray
on the sailors on leave.

880
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,120
A shoving match breaks out.

881
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,130
They crash into the table.
In which case, I gotta move my plate.

882
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,130
Or it's the future where
the pastrami sandwich I'm eating...

883
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,010
causes me gastric distress.

884
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,800
Thankfully, your friend offers
the antacids he carries...

885
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:43,810
in his right pocket, so good.
I'll be good.

886
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,930
Except in the future where
I have to leave in two minutes...

887
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,520
before he has a chance
to offer me the antacids...

888
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:52,690
so on the whole, I'd have to say
not good. I am not good.

889
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,530
But that depends.

890
00:58:58,610 --> 00:58:59,910
K!

891
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,620
How will we find this guy?

892
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,530
What am I, a schmuck?

893
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,700
He's here?

894
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:07,910
"Here" is a relative term.
He's a fifth dimensional being.

895
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,370
They can live in and visualise
an infinite set...

896
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,750
of time-space probabilities
simultaneously.

897
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,840
Sounds like fun. Good work.

898
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,460
Whoa, whoa, K, K, K.

899
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,260
You gotta fake my death, okay?

900
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,510
I can't listen to sitar music any more.

901
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,390
All right, I'll see what I can do.
I'll talk to X.

902
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,680
K, I can't tell
the women from the men.

903
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:29,060
May I see your watch?

904
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,980
Oh, it is 7:18.

905
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,860
No, no, your other watch,
the one your father gave you.

906
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,820
How do you know
about my father's watch?

907
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,740
Oh, dear.

908
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,870
This is the one
where Roman is dead...

909
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,660
and the gentleman at the
bowling alley. So much death.

910
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,290
Such an infinitesimally
small chance for success.

911
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:53,170
K!

912
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,040
Griffin, right?

913
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:55,710
We're here...

914
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,000
Because of Boris.

915
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,380
We think he's coming...

916
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,130
To kill me.
He'll be here in minutes...

917
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,340
unless we're in...

918
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:02,970
the future
where he made the lights...

919
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,140
and is about...

920
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,510
to shoot from the door...

921
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,010
in which case we're all dead.

922
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,560
Good, that was a close one.

923
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,150
K, I need a space gun.

924
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,400
The Boglodites...

925
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,980
consume any planet
in their path.

926
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,440
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians'.

927
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:21,450
I tried to stop them, but if we stop
them here, if we deny them Earth...

928
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:23,740
we can stop them.
They'll starve before...

929
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:24,990
they reach the next planet.

930
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,080
Sixty-three seconds.

931
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,830
How do we do that? Stop them?

932
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,210
What?

933
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,670
Sorry. I have something for you.

934
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,000
A gift. It can protect you.

935
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,220
I had to hide it from Boris,
but if you find me again...

936
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,680
I'll give it to you.

937
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:48,510
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!

938
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,350
What do you mean? What miracle?

939
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,100
Thirty seconds. I have to go.

940
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,230
No, we got you.

941
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,810
Negative possibilities are
multiplying as we speak.

942
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,270
- Okay.
- Twenty seconds.

943
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,110
All right.

944
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,230
We got it, relax.

945
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,570
If your watch is broken
and I have gastric...

946
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,490
Fly! Find your place in the world!

947
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,320
Oh, dear.

948
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,450
Boris is coming through that door...

949
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,330
in 12...

950
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,120
11, 10...

951
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,080
Wait!

952
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,830
Did you have chocolate milk?

953
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:15,750
Yes.

954
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,880
Cindy.

955
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,210
K!

956
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,210
- Griffin!
- Got him.

957
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,560
Damn it!

958
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,410
I'm good, I'm good.

959
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,790
What you got?

960
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,960
Damn it! We had him!

961
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,090
Relax, Cochise. We'll find him.

962
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,550
First of all, my name is J, okay?

963
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,630
It's not "son," it's not "slick"
and it damn sure ain't no "Cochise."

964
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:07,720
I'm not gonna relax because
we're running out of time...

965
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,470
and there's an invasion coming.

966
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,600
You're not really recognising
my voicial intensity.

967
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,230
But there was one guy
who could help.

968
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,440
Hey, Griffin! Griffin! Where's Griffin?

969
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,270
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K?

970
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:25,490
He's gone. If Boris gets to him
before we do, that's no bueno.

971
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,110
We need pie.

972
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,820
- What?
- My granddaddy always said:

973
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,200
"if you got a problem
you can't solve...

974
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:34,540
"...it helps to get out
of your head." Pie.

975
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,080
- Pie?
- Yeah.

976
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,870
Your granddaddy, heavyset man?

977
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,630
- A little bit.
- Yeah, you know what?

978
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,340
We've been doing smart stuff:

979
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,670
We've been following clues,
doing police work.

980
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,970
It might be time
we do something stupid.

981
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:50,090
Something that ain't got
nothing to do with nothing.

982
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,180
Now, I want some pie, K.
I want some pie.

983
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,720
Let's go get dumb-ass pie.

984
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,810
Sounds good.

985
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,800
Have any specials?

986
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:30,840
He'll have what he always has after
he reads the menu for 10 minutes...

987
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,430
and asks about specials.

988
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,260
A slice of apple pie
with a nasty piece of cheddar.

989
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:36,970
I'll have the strawberry-rhubarb.

990
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,890
It's my last meal,
I'm gonna splurge.

991
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,820
World-class serial killer out there
and we're having pie.

992
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,490
What do you do in your spare time,
stretch?

993
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:53,370
See, I sense you're not embracing
the concept here.

994
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,580
Pie don't work unless you let it.

995
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,120
I'm gonna let it.

996
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,660
And you say we don't talk?

997
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:02,210
You go ahead. Ask me any question.
Anything you want.

998
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:06,090
As long as it doesn't have to do
with the case. Just let her rip.

999
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,920
What's up with you and O?

1000
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,090
Me and O?

1001
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,680
Yeah, you and O.

1002
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,180
All right, all right.

1003
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:18,060
All right, this is it.

1004
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:22,690
A while back, I was assigned
to keep tabs on a musician.

1005
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:23,730
Mick Jagger?

1006
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,070
He's in this British band,
the Rolling Stones.

1007
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,320
Rings a bell.

1008
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,780
We believed he was on the planet
to breed with Earth women.

1009
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:34,200
So I was in London
and that's when I met O.

1010
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:38,330
Just smart. Funny. A great smile.

1011
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,580
And we find ourselves in this pub,
which is a bar, all right?

1012
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:46,750
Warm beer and the worst food
you ever ate.

1013
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:50,670
We just played darts
till the sun came up.

1014
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,550
Neither of us wanted to leave.

1015
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,060
What the hell happened
to you, man?

1016
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,940
I don't know. It hasn't happened yet.

1017
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:11,030
Come on, what about you, slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?

1018
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,950
I got you.

1019
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,780
I cannot believe this,
freaking New York Mets.

1020
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,320
Total losers!

1021
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:19,290
It's a rough time
to be a Mets fan.

1022
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,000
Tell me about it.
Never gonna catch the Cubs.

1023
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:25,330
That's funny. The Mets actually
win it all this year.

1024
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,920
Oh, yeah.

1025
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:27,960
No, I'm serious.

1026
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:28,840
I'm sure.

1027
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,550
Look, three months from now,
your buddies down there...

1028
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,880
are gonna be calling them
the Amazing Mets...

1029
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:36,550
and the Miracle Mets.

1030
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:40,060
What?

1031
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:41,890
What you got there, hoss?

1032
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:47,350
The Archanan said, "it's amazing!
It's a miracle! I'll see you at the game."

1033
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,900
I know where he is.

1034
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,690
Told you to trust the pie.

1035
01:05:57,030 --> 01:06:00,530
If Griffin's here for a game,
he's either too early or too late.

1036
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,040
He's here. We just gotta find him
before Boris does.

1037
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,210
It's time to give you
your things back...

1038
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,470
partner.

1039
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,760
You get some pie in you,
you get all mushy.

1040
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:19,090
I'm just tired of carrying your stuff.

1041
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:22,680
Come on now! All right! Let's go...

1042
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:23,720
Mets!

1043
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:26,390
Let's go, Mets! Let's go...

1044
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,770
...Mets! Let's go, Met...
- Griffin?

1045
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,940
You're just in time!

1046
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:37,450
Unless this is the one where Robinson
bad-hops it past third, it's almost over.

1047
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:40,950
Are we missing something?

1048
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,950
The game.

1049
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,820
So this is how you see things?
This is amazing.

1050
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,700
It's a gigantic pain in the ass.
But it has its moments.

1051
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,240
This game doesn't happen
till October.

1052
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:22,740
It's always October...

1053
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:24,580
and November and March.

1054
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,750
So many futures, and all real.
Don't know which will coalesce.

1055
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,710
Until then, they're all happening.

1056
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:32,840
Like this one, it's my favourite moment
in human history.

1057
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,380
All the things that had to converge
for the Mets to win the World Series.

1058
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:39,720
They were in last place every single
season until they won it all.

1059
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,180
You said you had a gift.

1060
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:42,180
That baseball...

1061
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:46,270
thrown for the last out of game five,
manufactured in '62 by Spalding...

1062
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:49,890
of Chicopee, Massachusetts,
was aerodynamically flawed...

1063
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:52,400
due to the horsehide
being improperly tanned...

1064
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,400
because the tanner's wife
left him...

1065
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,070
for a Puerto Rican golf pro...

1066
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,740
The gift?

1067
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,150
Oh, yes, of course. In the box.

1068
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,990
It's the surprise.
To protect the Earth.

1069
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,040
It's a shield.

1070
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:13,420
Shield.

1071
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,500
Archanan. Arc Net.
You put up the Arc Net.

1072
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:19,420
- How?
- When that ball is pitched to...

1073
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:20,420
Davey Johnson...

1074
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:21,800
who became a player...

1075
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:25,430
because his dad couldn't find a
football to give him for his birthday...

1076
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,350
it hits...

1077
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:28,470
his bat two micrometres
too high...

1078
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,980
popping out to Cleon Jones...

1079
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,060
who would've been born Clara,
a statistical...

1080
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,730
typist, if his parents didn't have
an extra glass of wine that night...

1081
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,780
before going to bed.

1082
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:40,940
A miracle...

1083
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:43,610
is what seems impossible
but happens anyway.

1084
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,500
I lost my planet.

1085
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,090
I don't want you to lose yours.

1086
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,760
It'll take a miracle,
but if you pull this off...

1087
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,970
you'll be my new
favourite moment...

1088
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,970
in human history.

1089
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,590
Oh, dear.

1090
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,680
I forgot to see this one coming.

1091
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:15,850
Damn it!

1092
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:27,200
Have these in the future?

1093
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:28,450
No.

1094
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,700
Get on.

1095
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,460
Keep gyro settings at zero gain.

1096
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,210
Balance pitch and yaw
with bursts on the centre stalk...

1097
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,750
between 80 and 100 psi.

1098
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,260
I didn't understand...

1099
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,840
any of that!

1100
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,090
- Gyro at zero gain.
- It is.

1101
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,640
Pitch and yaw with short bursts
on the centre stalk.

1102
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,470
I did!

1103
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,600
Between 80 and 100 psi!

1104
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,680
Got it.

1105
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:57,190
The Arc Net! Give it to me!

1106
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,230
This isn't the one where you get it!

1107
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,480
- All right there, chief?
- Hell, yeah.

1108
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:03,190
It'd be better with four wheels!

1109
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,700
Two is, like, my minimum.

1110
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:14,080
What happens if Boris
gets the Arc Net?

1111
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,500
Boglodite invasion,
total destruction of Earth!

1112
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,400
The box!

1113
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:54,870
Good boy.

1114
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:56,790
We gotta stop this guy!

1115
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,920
I've been trying!

1116
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,460
You haven't been trying?

1117
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,670
Hey, slick.

1118
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,050
In the future,
we ever do the Texas two-step?

1119
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,880
Yes, sir!

1120
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,280
Did you get him?

1121
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,080
Give me a sec.

1122
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,380
Is he dead?

1123
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,210
Negative.

1124
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,300
He got away.

1125
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,590
I got Griffin. Let's get out of here.

1126
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,440
I feel younger already.

1127
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,100
You pathetic waste
of Boglodite flesh.

1128
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,560
I'd kill you right now,
if I didn't value my own life.

1129
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:41,600
- Who are you?
- Look at you.

1130
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:44,810
Every mistake I've ever made,
just waiting to happen.

1131
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,150
What happened to my arm?

1132
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,570
You lose it, shot off by a human.

1133
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,190
No human could defeat me.

1134
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:54,820
You spend the next 40 years in prison,
chained up like an animal.

1135
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,870
No prison can hold me!

1136
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,750
They built one especially for us,
on the moon.

1137
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,870
No human has been to the moon...

1138
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,710
so they cannot have
built it there already.

1139
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,880
Stop arguing! You can avoid
all of that if you just listen to me!

1140
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,670
You were defeated!
You let it get shot off!

1141
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,630
That wasn't me, that was you!

1142
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:20,890
What's your plan?

1143
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,350
Prevent the Arc Net
from being deployed.

1144
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,060
- Kill anyone who tries.
- Good plan.

1145
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,520
Didn't work.

1146
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,650
With my help...

1147
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,780
we'll get the Arc Net,
kill Agent K...

1148
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,240
the invasion will be successful...

1149
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:35,990
and we'll get to keep both...

1150
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,530
of our ar...! Stop...

1151
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,200
staring at it!

1152
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,200
Listen.

1153
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:00,810
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thank you for saving my life.

1154
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,020
It's what we do.

1155
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,350
You still have the Arc Net?

1156
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,730
When you're being hunted
by Boris the Animal...

1157
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,610
you get good at hiding things.

1158
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:38,090
This will save your world.

1159
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,180
Once it's outside the atmosphere,
it gets...

1160
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,640
a whole lot bigger.

1161
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,690
All you have to do is deploy it.

1162
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:52,190
You mean in space?
Well, how do you suppose we do that?

1163
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,030
It's just one small step.

1164
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,580
The moon launch.

1165
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:15,710
Cape Canaveral.

1166
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,930
July 16th, 1969.

1167
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,890
We got six hours to get to Florida.

1168
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,600
Better get a move on, slick.

1169
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:24,850
Wait, hold up.

1170
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,140
Not us.
I'm gonna do this one alone.

1171
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:28,230
He has to be the...

1172
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,270
Griffin.

1173
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,560
What do you mean, alone?

1174
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,190
I'm gonna go to Florida.
You stay here.

1175
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,610
I need you to trust me.

1176
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:38,780
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you're not telling me, slick?

1177
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:40,410
You're not going to Florida.

1178
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,320
That ain't gonna happen, partner.

1179
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:43,870
Look, K...

1180
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,700
please, I will not allow you
to go to Florida.

1181
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:49,540
Stop me.

1182
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,170
You die there!

1183
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,010
Cape Canaveral. Apollo launch.

1184
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:05,760
Boris kills you there.

1185
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,730
That's what I'm here for.

1186
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,850
That's what I came back to stop.

1187
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,020
Oh, dear. We're in this one.

1188
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,320
K...

1189
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:20,200
I saw the file,
I looked at the report.

1190
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,570
I said I told you everything...

1191
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,740
That's for lying to me.

1192
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,030
Look, I'm sorry, man!

1193
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,830
That's for telling me the truth!

1194
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,000
I'm trying to protect you...

1195
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,670
man!

1196
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:41,380
The bitterest truth is better
than the sweetest lies.

1197
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,970
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.

1198
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:49,890
He must deploy the Arc Net
as he did before.

1199
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,560
There's no other way.

1200
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,310
K is the only hope in saving Earth.

1201
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,690
Can I save him?

1202
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:02,360
Is there any future
where I save his life?

1203
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,620
Yes.

1204
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,370
But where there is death...

1205
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,750
there will always be death.

1206
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,440
According to you,
I've done this before.

1207
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,020
So we know it's possible.

1208
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:37,150
If you're half the agent
you say you are...

1209
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,610
you'll make sure
I don't get killed doing it.

1210
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:45,990
So are we partners? You tell me.

1211
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,450
Let's go.

1212
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:04,470
Agent K...

1213
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:06,050
...how are you?
- I'm good.

1214
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:09,390
Okay, group hug on the way
to doing what we're doing.

1215
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:13,770
This morning, man is about to launch
himself on a trip to the moon...

1216
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:16,440
with the expectation
of landing there.

1217
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,060
Look, I gotta ask you.

1218
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:20,610
If we pull this off,
fix things the way they were...

1219
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,570
O and I, are we...?

1220
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,940
A wise man once told me...

1221
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:26,910
don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

1222
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,910
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

1223
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,040
Here they are.

1224
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,040
- What are they?
- Jetpacks.

1225
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,750
Jetpacks?

1226
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,590
No, no, no.
We're not doing jetpacks.

1227
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,090
There's a reason we don't
have these in the future.

1228
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,260
K, we gotta drive.

1229
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,640
Can't drive to Florida from Manhattan
in five hours, chief.

1230
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:56,850
Yeah, we can. The red button,
standard issue in every MiB car.

1231
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,900
Press the red button,
goes into hyperdrive.

1232
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,860
No red buttons yet, slick.

1233
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:04,730
Come on, man.

1234
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:10,660
Do you know...

1235
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,120
how to work this thing?

1236
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,410
It's like with anything.

1237
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:18,500
Just have to strap yourself in,
hope for the best.

1238
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,920
Isn't that right, Miss O?

1239
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,300
Unfortunately, it is.

1240
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:36,770
You ready, slick?

1241
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,190
Let's get it.

1242
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,230
This is gonna be interesting!

1243
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,450
It's just minutes to the...

1244
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,290
historic launch of Apollo 11 ...

1245
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,790
with all going well.

1246
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,350
I'm so glad this isn't
one of the times we explode.

1247
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,310
One of the times?

1248
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,690
Oh, we got company.

1249
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,700
The hell?

1250
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,240
Is that a battery belt?

1251
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:48,670
All right, I got it.

1252
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,430
No, any reality
that gets the shield deployed...

1253
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,390
is one where you tell the truth.

1254
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,140
The truth?

1255
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:00,480
The truth is the only path.

1256
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,350
This is a restricted area!

1257
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,360
Yes, sir, it is.

1258
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:12,490
Good day, gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?

1259
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:16,320
My name is Agent J.
This is Agent K. That's Griff.

1260
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,580
We're from a secret government
organisation...

1261
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,330
that polices and monitors
alien activity on and off planet Earth.

1262
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:24,870
Here's the thing.

1263
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,500
We have this special
little metal thingy...

1264
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:31,460
that Griff gave us that we have
to get on top of that rocket...

1265
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:35,260
to prevent an alien invasion.

1266
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,640
That worked.

1267
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:42,520
- Like a charm.
- Sir, Delta Gate. We have a problem.

1268
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:46,230
Three trespassers. No lDs,
but they've got weapons, sir.

1269
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,610
Some kind I've never seen before.

1270
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,910
What breed of fool
do you have to be...

1271
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,990
to penetrate my site
on the day of the most massive feat...

1272
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,410
attempted by mankind?

1273
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,500
Watched by God, the population
of the planet and my own...

1274
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,790
...firstborn!
- Colonel?

1275
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,840
Colonel, they had these.

1276
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,170
They said they needed
to put something on the rocket...

1277
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,510
for an invasion.

1278
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,720
Thanks.

1279
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,180
I got 10 minutes to launch.

1280
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:24,480
If you pose a threat to that rocket,
you tell me now and do not lie to me.

1281
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,900
I told the truth last time.

1282
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,700
Sir, this man came here from...

1283
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,280
the future to protect me...

1284
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:42,870
so I can attach a shield to the top
of that rocket and save the world.

1285
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,000
I need your help to do that.

1286
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:49,460
Take them to the brig.

1287
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,130
You're slipping, Griff.

1288
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:52,840
Sir, if I may.

1289
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:09,770
Corporal.

1290
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:12,520
You men are no longer needed.

1291
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,150
I'll take the prisoners.

1292
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:16,360
- Sir, are you...?
- Dismissed.

1293
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,200
Follow me.

1294
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:35,760
You did the future thing.
What did you show him?

1295
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,050
Only what he needed to see.

1296
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,760
I have to go now.

1297
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,300
What? No, no, no. Come on.

1298
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,220
You don't need me any more.

1299
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,020
All right, Griff,
don't start flipping on me.

1300
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:51,650
When Boris' arm is taken, the past
will be as it was. K will survive.

1301
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,770
He will not know
you were ever here.

1302
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,570
All right. Arm gone, got it.
Like a reset?

1303
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:02,990
When that happens, go home.
Leave.

1304
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:03,830
You coming?

1305
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:05,990
Yeah, all right!

1306
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,420
Thanks, man.
Hey, will I ever see you again?

1307
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,460
Anything's possible.

1308
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,460
Oh, Griff.

1309
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:28,850
Armstrong and Aldrin
are scheduled...

1310
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,940
to set foot on the moon...

1311
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:35,060
on early Monday morning,
Eastern Daylight Time.

1312
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,190
Where's Griffin?

1313
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,150
Doing his own thing.

1314
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,510
Gentlemen.

1315
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,850
This elevator
will take you to the top.

1316
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,020
To get the Arc Net
outside the atmosphere...

1317
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,190
you need to strap it to the escape
rocket above the capsule!

1318
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,730
You do not want to be...

1319
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:18,150
anywhere near this rocket
when it takes off!

1320
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,690
- Questions?
- No. Thank you for this, colonel.

1321
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,450
Some job you got there.

1322
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,860
Hey, thanks a lot, bro.

1323
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:26,530
What did Griff
show you back there?

1324
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,120
How important you are.

1325
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,040
You and your partner.

1326
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,710
If everything goes right
the way we hope it does...

1327
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,630
I'm gonna end up
getting out of here pretty quick...

1328
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:47,220
so I'm not gonna have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

1329
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:50,930
If things go wrong,
not gonna have a chance to, either.

1330
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:54,520
So I guess win or lose, this is it.

1331
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,940
I see why I recruited you.

1332
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:04,900
You're a good man.

1333
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:10,030
Good man.

1334
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,750
Man, what the hell
happened to you?

1335
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,500
I told you,
it still hasn't happened yet.

1336
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,050
I'll take this one!

1337
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:25,550
Naughty.

1338
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:30,300
Get a pedicure if you get a second.

1339
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:42,360
And liftoff.

1340
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:25,530
Just passed the two-minute mark...

1341
01:27:25,690 --> 01:27:29,160
in the countdown, and all is still go
as we monitor our status board.

1342
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:53,260
Astronauts report it feels good.
Power transfer is complete.

1343
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:56,970
Neil Armstrong just reported back
it's been a smooth countdown.

1344
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:10,610
Hey!

1345
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,490
Boris, can you give me a hand?

1346
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:14,450
Hey.

1347
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:19,910
Hey!

1348
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:22,500
You hear me calling you?

1349
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:24,880
Boris the Animal!

1350
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,050
Hey!

1351
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:28,380
Boris the Animal!

1352
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,640
It's just Boris!

1353
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:37,520
You're gonna lose.

1354
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:39,060
Let's agree to disagree.

1355
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,870
Hey!

1356
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:02,540
Boris the Animal!

1357
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:13,300
Right.

1358
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:14,800
Left.

1359
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:43,790
You're gonna lose.

1360
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,000
Let's agree to disagree.

1361
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,260
Hey!

1362
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:58,760
Boris the Animal!

1363
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:06,400
Right.

1364
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:08,310
Left. Left.

1365
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,150
Right.

1366
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,200
That's not possible.

1367
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:18,410
Let's agree to disagree.

1368
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,790
That's not possible!

1369
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:37,090
K!

1370
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,100
I win! I'm better than me!

1371
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,770
That's my partner.

1372
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:52,070
That's my partner!

1373
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,320
If we call this in...

1374
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:02,160
...they'll scrub the launch.
- I didn't see anything.

1375
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,740
- Where's your partner?
- He went home.

1376
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,410
- How does that work?
- You got me.

1377
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:41,870
Come on!

1378
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,510
Get down!

1379
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,910
Bingo.

1380
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:32,920
Man, that is some next-level stuff.

1381
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:44,260
You ever want to see more...

1382
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:47,770
I know a top-secret organisation
that could use a man like you.

1383
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,350
I wish I could.

1384
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:52,900
Thank you.

1385
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,400
I'll see you around, K.

1386
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:57,820
Look out!

1387
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:04,780
Go ahead.

1388
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:06,780
Arrest me.

1389
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,040
Not this time.

1390
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:23,050
"Where there's death,
there will always be death."

1391
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:35,650
Daddy! Daddy!

1392
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:40,530
Hey.

1393
01:33:41,570 --> 01:33:43,530
Hey, my name's K.
What's your name?

1394
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:45,110
James.

1395
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,830
James? That's a nice name.

1396
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,370
Where's my dad?

1397
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:54,120
What have you got there?
What is that?

1398
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:55,670
My dad gave it to me.

1399
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:58,090
We timed the launch.

1400
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:07,010
Where is my daddy?

1401
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:12,520
He...

1402
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:16,850
He went to go do something
very special.

1403
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,900
And he wanted me...

1404
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:23,400
to stay here and take care
of his best pal.

1405
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:30,450
When is he gonna be back?

1406
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,000
He...

1407
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,260
James...

1408
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,430
if you look right here...

1409
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,810
I will tell you the only thing
you ever need to know.

1410
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,110
Your daddy is a hero.

1411
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,780
My daddy is a hero?

1412
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:12,280
- Want to take a walk with me?
- Yes.

1413
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,130
James?

1414
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,170
You're late.

1415
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,590
Sorry. Lost track of time.

1416
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:12,760
How do you know that song?

1417
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,180
Drink your coffee.
We got work to do.

1418
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:17,850
What do you know
and what do you don't?

1419
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:19,730
How do I know what I don't know?

1420
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:22,810
That's a really good question.
Did we go to Wu's last night?

1421
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:23,730
Yeah.

1422
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:24,940
Boglodites?

1423
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:25,900
Extinct for 40 years.

1424
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,570
Perfect. Did we talk
on the phone last night?

1425
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:29,990
You hung up on me.

1426
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:32,030
Yeah, I did.

1427
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:35,240
But that was because
of all those secrets...

1428
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,700
the universe doesn't know about.

1429
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,210
But...

1430
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,380
I've realised that...

1431
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:49,050
last night was a long...

1432
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,510
long time ago.

1433
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,520
And, really,
I just want to say thank you.

1434
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,100
It's been my privilege.

1435
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:13,360
You know, there's a really
high possibility now...

1436
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:16,120
that I might know some things
you don't know.

1437
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,870
I doubt it.

1438
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,000
I bet I know what went down
with you and O.

1439
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,080
She's a fine lady,
but you know the rules.

1440
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,420
There's no fraternising
amongst agents.

1441
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:27,290
I think y'all might have fraternised
a time or two.

1442
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:33,800
This is my new favourite moment
in human history.

1443
01:37:33,970 --> 01:37:37,220
Unless this is the one
where K forgot to leave a tip.

1444
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:53,700
Almost forgot.

1445
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,960
That was a close one.
