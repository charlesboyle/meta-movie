1
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,000
In the first years
of the 21st century...

2
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,500
...a third World War broke out.

3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,000
Those of us who survived knew

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,500
mankind could never survive...

5
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,100
a fourth...

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,800
that our own volatile natures

7
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,100
could simply no longer
be risked.

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
So we have created
a new arm of the law...

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,200
...the Grammaton Cleric,

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,200
whose sole task it is
to seek out and eradicate

11
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,600
the true source
of man's inhumanity to man.

12
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,000
His ability...

13
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,000
to feel.

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,300
Police!

15
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,300
You know what to do.

16
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,600
Get down!

17
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,300
We have an unknown number

18
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,800
barricaded in the southeast end
of the compound.

19
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,300
Read that.
Tetragrammaton team en route.

20
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Cleric, lights out.
Maybe more than a dozen inside.

21
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,900
When the door's down,
blow the bulbs.

22
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,700
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Go.

24
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,300
Where is he?

25
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,500
Shut up.

26
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Anybody get him?
Did anybody hit him?

27
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,100
Shut up!

28
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,600
Listen.

29
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,200
This is it.

30
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,500
Where?

31
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,000
There.

32
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
It's real.

33
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,300
Burn it.

34
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,900
Why didn't you just leave it

35
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,100
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

36
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,900
They miss things sometimes.

37
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,000
And I thought
I'd take it down myself...

38
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,600
get it done properly.

39
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,300
How long, Preston,
till all this is gone?

40
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,700
Till we've burned
every last bit of it?

41
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Resources are tight.

42
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,200
We'll get it all eventually.

43
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,000
Libria...

44
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,400
I congratulate you.

45
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,400
At last...

46
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,200
peace reigns
in the heart of man.

47
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,100
At last, war is but a word

48
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,400
whose meaning fades
from our understanding.

49
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,700
At last...

50
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,000
we... are... whole.

51
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,300
Librians... there is a disease
in the heart of man.

52
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,900
Its symptom is hate.

53
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,400
Its symptom... is anger.

54
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,500
Its symptom is rage.

55
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,500
Its symptom... is war.

56
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,600
The disease... is human emotion.

57
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,800
But, Libria...
I congratulate you.

58
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,300
For there is a cure
for this disease.

59
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,800
At the cost of the dizzying
highs of human emotion,

60
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,000
we have suppressed
its abysmal lows.

61
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,600
And you as a society
have embraced this cure.

62
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,900
Prozium.

63
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,700
Now we are at peace
with ourselves,

64
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,200
and humankind is one.

65
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,200
War is gone.

66
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,900
Hate, a memory.

67
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,900
We are our own conscience now.

68
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,400
And it is this conscience
that guides us to rate EC-10

69
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,700
for emotional content

70
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,000
all those things that might
tempt us to feel again...

71
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,700
and destroy them.

72
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Librians, you have won.

73
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,700
Against all odds
and your own natures...

74
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,100
you have survived.

75
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,300
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

76
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,900
it reminds why we do
what we do.

77
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,100
It does?

78
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
I beg your pardon.

79
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,300
It <i>does.</i>

80
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,600
The following items
have been rated EC-10...

81
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,100
condemned...

82
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,000
seven works of two-dimensional
illustrated material,

83
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,700
seven discs of musical content,

84
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,800
20 interactive strategy
computer programs.

85
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Seven works
of two-dimensional...

86
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,200
Thank you
for coming, Cleric.

87
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,200
I assume you know who I am.

88
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
Yes, sir. Of course.

89
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
You are Vice-Council Dupont

90
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,500
of the Third Conciliarly
of the Tetragrammaton...

91
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
Father's voice.

92
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,800
Quite frankly, Cleric,

93
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,600
I am told that you are
very nearly a prodigal student,

94
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,500
knowing almost instantly
if someone is feeling.

95
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,400
I have a good record, sir.

96
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Why, do you imagine,
that is, Cleric?

97
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,700
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.

98
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,900
Somehow...

99
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm able, on some level,

100
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,100
to sense
how an offender thinks,

101
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,100
to... put myself
in their position.

102
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,400
If you had ceased
your interval,

103
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,900
if you were
a sense offender...

104
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,100
I suppose
you could say that, sir.

105
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,500
You're a family man, Cleric?

106
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,200
Yes, sir...
a boy and a girl.

107
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
The boy's in
the monastery himself,

108
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,800
on path to becoming a Cleric.

109
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,900
Good.

110
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
And the mother?

111
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,100
My spouse was arrested
and incinerated

112
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,900
for sense offense
four years ago, sir.

113
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
By yourself?

114
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
No, sir... by another.

115
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,500
How did you feel about that?

116
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
I'm sorry.

117
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,800
I don't...
fully understand, sir.

118
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
How did you feel?

119
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,400
I didn't feel anything.

120
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,300
Really?

121
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,700
How is it
that you came to miss it?

122
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,700
I...

123
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,100
I've asked myself
that same question, sir.

124
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,700
I don't know.

125
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,600
A nearly unforgivable lapse,
Cleric.

126
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,000
I trust you'll be
more vigilant in the future.

127
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,400
Yes, sir.

128
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,400
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

129
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,200
it reminds why we do
what we do.

130
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
It does?

131
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

132
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,400
it reminds why we do
what we do.

133
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
It does?

134
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
It <i>does.</i>

135
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,700
Prosecutorial evidence
for A.N.R. 136890.

136
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
I need it.

137
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,400
It was late this afternoon.

138
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,700
May not have showed up
in the records yet.

139
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm very sorry, Cleric.

140
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,900
Nothing has been logged

141
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,400
and nothing is pending
under that entry.

142
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,600
It was an item of evidence
brought in personally

143
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,900
by Grammaton Errol Partridge.

144
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
Check again.

145
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,600
Sir, Cleric Partridge has not
entered anything in for weeks.

146
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,700
You're mistaken.
It was a book of some kind.

147
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Cleric...

148
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,600
...there's nothing.

149
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,800
Thank you.

150
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,100
He's been passing through
the gate into the Nether

151
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,600
every night
for the last two weeks.

152
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,200
We assumed it was
enforcement-related.

153
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,100
You always knew.

154
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,600
"But I, being poor...

155
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,000
have only my dreams."

156
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,400
"I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

157
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,700
"Tread softly...

158
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,100
because you tread
on my dreams."

159
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,300
I assume you dream, Preston.

160
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,400
I'll do what I can
to see they go easy on you.

161
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,400
We both know...
they never go easy.

162
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,600
Then I'm sorry.

163
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
No, you're not.

164
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,900
You don't even know
the meaning.

165
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,600
It's just a... vestigial word

166
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,500
for a feeling
you've never felt.

167
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,300
Don't you see, Preston?

168
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,500
It's gone.

169
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,800
Everything that makes us
what we are... traded away.

170
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,000
There's no war.

171
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,800
No murder.

172
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,100
What is it you think we do?

173
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,000
No.

174
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,300
You've been with me.

175
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,800
You've seen how it can be...
the jealousy, the rage.

176
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
A heavy cost.

177
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,500
I'd pay it gladly.

178
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Don't.

179
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,100
You and your partner
were close?

180
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I hope you're as pleased
to be assigned me

181
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,200
as I am the placement.

182
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,100
I was told this would be
a career-making advancement.

183
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
I'm like you, Cleric...
intuitive.

184
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,500
Sometimes I know
when a person's feeling

185
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
before they know it
themselves.

186
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,900
Cleric...

187
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,700
I can only hope one day
to be as...

188
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,800
uncompromising as you.

189
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,200
Good night.

190
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,000
The later 20th century

191
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,200
saw the fortuitous
and simultaneous rise

192
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,400
of two synergistic political
and psychological sciences.

193
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,500
The first, the revolutionary
precept of the hate crime.

194
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,200
John?

195
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Yes?

196
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,500
I saw Robbie Taylor
crying today.

197
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,300
He didn't know, but I saw.

198
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,700
Do you think
I should report him?

199
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,300
Unquestionably.

200
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,200
...a single inescapable fact...

201
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
that mankind united with
infinitely greater purpose

202
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,000
in pursuit of war...

203
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,000
than he ever did
in pursuit of peace.

204
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,300
"But I, being poor...

205
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,100
have only my dreams."

206
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,500
I have spread my dreams
under your feet."

207
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,400
"Tread softly...

208
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,300
because you tread
on my dreams."

209
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,300
Don't move! Don't move!

210
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Comply! Comply!

211
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,000
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Get down! Get down!

212
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,700
Don't shoot.
This is a lawful entry.

213
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,300
We have a warrant
for your wife's arrest.

214
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,200
She's charged
with sense offense.

215
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
Hey!

216
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,300
Get her!
Get her off him now!

217
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,800
Remember me.

218
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,400
Libria...

219
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,200
Awake.

220
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,500
Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet another day,

221
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,100
another step
in our unified march

222
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,800
into the unwavering purpose...

223
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,500
...move ahead together

224
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,200
into the certainty
of our collective destiny.

225
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,600
What are you doing?

226
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,200
I said, what are you doing?

227
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,700
I accidentally dropped my...

228
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,300
morning interval.

229
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,400
I took it out
before I brushed my teeth.

230
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,000
I never take it out
before I brush my teeth.

231
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,900
Then you'll go by Equilibrium,
log the loss,

232
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,300
and get a replacement.

233
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,300
Yes.

234
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
Of course.

235
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,100
Your new partner called.

236
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,600
He says he'll pick you up
at 10:00 for the A.N.R.

237
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
I hope you don't mind.

238
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
I took the liberty
of telling him

239
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,500
you would be at Equilibrium,
replacing your dose.

240
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,100
No, of course not.

241
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
That was the right thing
to do.

242
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,500
Stop that.

243
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,400
Due to terrorist activity,

244
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,900
this site is
temporarily closed.

245
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,400
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

246
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,900
Due to terrorist activity,

247
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,200
this site is
temporarily closed.

248
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,800
This site is
temporarily closed.

249
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,300
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

250
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,100
More than punctual, Cleric.

251
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,300
Hop in.

252
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,000
How were the lines?

253
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,500
I'm surprised you were able
to get your interval

254
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,300
and get out so quickly.

255
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
No, they're...
they're fine today.

256
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,800
Maybe I'll drop by later,
get my interval adjusted.

257
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,600
You expecting Resistance?

258
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,800
That's something you'll find
about me, Cleric.

259
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,900
I'm a wary person,
cautious by nature.

260
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,600
Always expecting the worst.

261
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,300
You can't do this.
You cannot do this.

262
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,500
Tetragrammaton.
There's nothing we can't do.

263
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,700
How long have you been off
the dose?

264
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Look at you.

265
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,600
Look at you!

266
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,800
Look at you.

267
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,600
The mirror's frame is illegal.
Destroy it.

268
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,300
We have suppression.
We're making entry.

269
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Standard deployment.

270
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,700
Collecting catalog.
Illegal articles.

271
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,500
You're gonna burn it,
aren't you?

272
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,200
Eventually.

273
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,000
However, you couldn't have
accumulated all this

274
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,300
by yourself.

275
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
It'll all be sorted
and examined.

276
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,600
We'll discover
who your confederates are.

277
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,300
Gun!

278
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,700
We need her.

279
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
What's your name?

280
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
O'Brien, Mary.

281
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,500
Well, Mary...

282
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,900
you can either wait

283
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,100
and tell the technicians
at the Palace of Justice...

284
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,900
or you can tell me now.

285
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Who are your friends?

286
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,200
I'm wondering if you have
any idea at all

287
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,300
what that word means...
"friend."

288
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,900
There's nothing
you don't feel?

289
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,100
How about guilt?

290
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,100
Let me ask you something.

291
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,600
Why are you alive?

292
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,400
I'm alive...

293
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,100
I live...

294
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,000
...to safeguard the continuity
of this great society.

295
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,700
To serve Libria.

296
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,200
It's circular.

297
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,900
You exist to continue
your existence.

298
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,400
What's the point?

299
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
What's the point
of <i>your</i> existence?

300
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
To feel.

301
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,200
'Cause you've never done it,
you can never know it.

302
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,000
But it's as vital as breath.

303
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,700
And without it...
without love,

304
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,300
without anger,
without sorrow...

305
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,800
breath is
just a clock ticking.

306
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,800
Then I have no choice
but to remand you

307
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,100
to the Palace of Justice
for processing.

308
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,500
Processing.

309
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,800
You mean execution, don't you?

310
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,900
Processing.

311
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,800
The Gun Katas.

312
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,800
Through analysis of thousands
of recorded gunfights,

313
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,800
the Cleric has determined

314
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,000
that the geometric distribution
of antagonists in any gun battle

315
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,800
is a statistically
predictable element.

316
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,300
The Gun Kata treats
the gun as a total weapon,

317
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,600
each fluid position
representing

318
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,700
a maximum kill zone,
inflicting maximum damage

319
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,600
on the maximum number
of opponents

320
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,400
while keeping
the defender clear

321
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,800
of the statistically
traditional trajectories

322
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,500
of return fire.

323
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,600
By the rote mastery
of this art,

324
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,900
your firing efficiency will rise
by no less than 120%.

325
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,600
The difference of a 63% increase
to lethal proficiency

326
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
makes the master
of the Gun Katas

327
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,000
an adversary not to be
taken lightly.

328
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,100
Without love...

329
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,800
breath is just a clock...
ticking.

330
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Prozium...
the great nepenthe.

331
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,300
Opiate of our masses.

332
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Glue of our great society.

333
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,200
Salve and salvation,

334
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,200
it has delivered us
from pathos, from sorrow,

335
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,300
the deepest chasms
of melancholy and hate.

336
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,900
With it, we anesthetize grief,

337
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,100
annihilate jealousy,
obliterate rage.

338
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,600
That those sister impulses
towards joy, love, and elation

339
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,200
are anesthetized in stride,

340
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,600
we accept as fair sacrifice.

341
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,600
For we embrace Prozium
in its unifying fullness

342
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,900
and all that it has done
to make us great.

343
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
Good morning, Cleric.

344
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Good morning.

345
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,500
...intrinsically, humans,
as creatures of the Earth

346
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:40,800
were drawn inherently always
back to one thing... war.

347
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,200
And thus we seek to correct
not the symptom

348
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,800
but the disease itself.

349
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,300
We have sought to shrug off
individuality,

350
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,000
replacing it with conformity.

351
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,000
Replacing it...

352
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,800
with sameness...

353
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,400
with unity,

354
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,000
allowing each man, woman,
and child

355
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,900
in this great society

356
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,600
to lead identical lives.

357
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,600
The concept of identical
environment construction

358
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,900
allows each of us to head
confidently into each moment

359
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,700
with all the secure knowledge

360
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,600
it has been lived before.

361
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,100
What are you doing?

362
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
I'm rearranging my desk.

363
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,600
You didn't like
the way it was before?

364
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,800
I had no feelings about it.

365
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,100
I'm merely attempting
to optimize.

366
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,000
Sense offenders
holed up in the Nether.

367
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,100
We estimate...
we estimate 50 men, sir.

368
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,800
Intelligence tells us
they're all fully armed.

369
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,500
This is the group that bombed
the Prozium factories.

370
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,100
You clean, we'll sweep.

371
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,700
Yes, sir.

372
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,600
Go! Go! Go! Go!

373
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Go!

374
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,200
Aah!

375
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,700
Take it! Take the landings!

376
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,900
- Aah!
- Aah!

377
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,500
- Cover me. I'm going in.
- Aaaaaaaah!

378
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,900
Nice grab, Cleric.

379
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,600
"Ludwig Van Beethoven."

380
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,400
Cleric...

381
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,900
Why didn't you leave that

382
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,800
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

383
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,400
They miss things sometimes.

384
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,600
I'll take it in myself...

385
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,400
make sure
it gets done properly.

386
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
You know, Preston...

387
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,400
If we keep burning
all this contraband,

388
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,700
eventually there won't be
anything left to burn.

389
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,600
What'll there be
for men like us?

390
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,400
Sir!

391
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,000
We got something out back.

392
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,900
We're gonna need
two more men on this.

393
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,700
These animals were defended
by women and children.

394
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,100
We put them down easily.

395
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,800
This isn't the first time
we've seen this.

396
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,100
Why do they keep
these animals?

397
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,300
What, do they...
do they eat them?

398
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,400
What do you want me
to do, sir?

399
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,800
Exterminate them, of course.

400
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,300
All right. Let's do it.

401
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,200
No.

402
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,400
What's wrong, Cleric?

403
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,200
Nothing.

404
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,700
Hey...

405
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,000
Grab it.

406
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,200
Grab it!

407
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,100
Sir... toss it back in.

408
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,000
I'll finish it off.

409
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,000
Give it to me, sir.

410
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Give it to him, Cleric.
He'll finish it.

411
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,200
Wait!

412
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,800
It seems to me that...

413
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,500
at least some of these animals
ought to be tested for disease.

414
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,600
If there's an epidemic
in the Nether,

415
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,200
it's best we know about it.

416
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,900
I don't quite follow
your logic, Cleric.

417
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,300
They were Resistance.

418
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,600
They could have led us
to the Underground.

419
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,300
But instead of apprehension
and interrogation,

420
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,300
they were slaughtered.

421
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,600
Yes, but, Cleric,
given the circumstances,

422
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,200
the Father has decreed

423
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,700
that there will be no more
"process" for sense offenders.

424
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,200
They are either to be
shot on sight

425
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,700
or incinerated without a trial.

426
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,000
But it's counter to law.

427
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,900
You're a member
of the Council. If...

428
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,800
It is not the will
of the Council,

429
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,600
it is the will of Father...
and he is law.

430
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,800
Sir...

431
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,800
without the logic of process,
is it not just mayhem...

432
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,800
what we have worked so hard
to eradicate?

433
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,000
You must understand, Preston,

434
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,700
that while you... and even I...
may not always agree with it,

435
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,500
it is not the message
that is important,

436
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,800
it is our obedience to it.

437
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,000
Father's will.

438
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,700
Call it faith.

439
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,800
You have it, I assume?

440
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,700
Yes.

441
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,800
I have it.

442
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,400
Good.

443
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,100
Confiscated evidence
X23-T45...

444
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,500
Mary O'Brien.

445
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,800
Cleric John Preston
passing into the Nether...

446
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,000
enforcement-related.

447
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,200
Thank you, sir.

448
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,800
I don't know what else
to do with you.

449
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,900
Go on.

450
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Go on.

451
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,400
Go!

452
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,000
Fine.

453
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
But you're going back
in the trunk.

454
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,500
Okay.

455
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,100
Here.

456
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,400
Step away from the vehicle!

457
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,700
Step away from the vehicle!

458
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,000
This is your last warning!

459
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,900
Step away from the vehicle!

460
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,200
Identification.

461
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,700
I'm a Cleric.

462
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm here on official business.

463
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,800
Identification!

464
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,200
It's in my coat.

465
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,500
Where's the coat?
Where is it?!

466
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,800
I don't have it.

467
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,600
Unidentified individuals are
subject to summary destruction.

468
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,400
You're making
a very big mistake.

469
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,500
I'm a Grammaton Cleric,
first class.

470
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
We're gonna search
your vehicle.

471
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,900
No, you're not.
There's nothing in it.

472
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,500
Search it!

473
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,300
- Clear, sir.
- Keys to the trunk.

474
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,600
I'm trying to tell you.

475
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,700
I have a predawn combustion
to witness.

476
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,200
I'm not...

477
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,300
Captain, this is a waste
of my time.

478
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,700
My name is John Preston.

479
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,100
I'm the highest-ranking Cleric
of the Tetragramm...

480
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,700
Wait.

481
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,400
Stand off.

482
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,600
I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you, sir.

483
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,200
That's okay.
Just doing your job.

484
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
Thank you.

485
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,200
We'll escort you back
to the gate.

486
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,200
Thanks.

487
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,600
Animals.

488
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,500
Nether's full of them.

489
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,500
Sounds like it came
from your trunk.

490
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Impossible.

491
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,500
Just give me my keys.

492
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,700
I'll be on my way.

493
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,600
Captain...

494
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,800
I'm asking you
one last time...

495
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,700
don't do this.

496
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,500
Down on your knees!

497
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,200
- Down on your knees!
- Down on your knees!

498
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,400
Drop down!

499
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,800
On the ground! Comply!

500
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,400
Do it!

501
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,300
No.

502
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,700
Fuck!

503
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,400
What?

504
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,800
Aw, shit! Shoot him!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

505
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,300
Aah!

506
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,200
Always practicing, Cleric.

507
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,900
I guess that's why
you're the best.

508
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,600
Maybe I'm just better.

509
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,500
Something on your mind?

510
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,500
Why do you ask?

511
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,800
The intuitive arts, Cleric.

512
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,000
It's my job to know
what you're thinking.

513
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,100
So, then...
what am I thinking?

514
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,100
About the murders
in the Nether last night...

515
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,200
And if they know who did it.

516
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Am I close?

517
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,400
So, tell me... do they know?

518
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,900
There are theories.

519
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,300
I have one or two of my own,
but at the moment...

520
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,500
They're premature!

521
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,700
I'm glad it happened.

522
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,100
Why?

523
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,200
Because now
Father and the Council

524
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,800
have decreed an acceleration
in the crackdown on offenders.

525
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,100
Whoever did it...

526
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,600
all they accomplished was
a quicker end to the Resistance.

527
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,800
It's gonna be
a massacre, Cleric.

528
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,700
I came to tell you...
there's a raid in the Nether...

529
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,800
Sector 7.

530
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,500
So get ready.

531
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,200
That door behind you...

532
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,600
Go.

533
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,600
Go, damn you!

534
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,700
Get out of here, God damn it!
If you don't, you're dead!

535
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,600
Don't do it.
He'll shoot us in the back.

536
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,700
If I was gonna shoot you,
I'd shoot you in the face.

537
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,100
Now go.

538
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,100
Damn you! Follow me.

539
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,900
Now! Let's go!

540
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,500
There will be no detention.

541
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,300
Repeat...
no detention for any purpose.

542
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,200
All prisoners and apprehendees
are to be put down.

543
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,900
Look out!

544
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,400
Aah!

545
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,900
Aaaah!

546
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,700
Cleric, what's happening?
We heard gunshots.

547
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,300
Go!

548
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,600
What are you doing?
Cleric!

549
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,900
They're Resistance fighters.

550
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,900
Cleric!

551
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,000
He's a sense offender!

552
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,400
Cover all quadrants!

553
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,800
Secure the perimeter!

554
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,500
What is this?

555
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,400
What are you doing?!

556
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,000
Nicely done, Cleric.

557
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,200
You drive them
into the trap...

558
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,400
I close it.

559
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,600
The very definition
of... teamwork.

560
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,200
Don't you think?

561
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,800
Why don't you take the honors
of the execution, Cleric?

562
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,700
These people should be taken
for clinical interrogation.

563
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,900
Cleric...

564
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,300
Father's rulings
are quite clear.

565
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,100
Offenders are to be shot
on sight.

566
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,800
They have valuable information.

567
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,900
Cleric...

568
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,400
They can be put to
much better use.

569
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,500
Cleric.

570
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,600
If your weapon's low,
please, use mine.

571
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,500
No.

572
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,300
I think, in the end...

573
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,500
it'll be better
if <i>you</i> have it.

574
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,700
Captain.

575
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,700
Yes, sir. Firing positions.

576
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,300
Ready...

577
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,100
Aim...

578
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,600
Fire!

579
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,100
Sir?

580
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,100
Yes, Cleric?

581
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,900
You asked me to become
Father's instrument

582
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,700
against the Resistance.

583
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,700
I'm ready.

584
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,700
Today.

585
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,600
I wish to show my faith.

586
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,500
I wish, with your permission,

587
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,500
to locate the Underground
once and for all.

588
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,000
To destroy it.

589
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,400
To destroy it.

590
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,600
Good. Do it.

591
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm so...

592
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,800
so very sorry.

593
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,800
These are the possessions he had
on him at the time of death.

594
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,200
The illegal ones
will be burned with him.

595
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,600
Good.

596
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,500
Errol Partridge.

597
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,800
The name supposed to mean
something to me?

598
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,600
He was a Grammaton Cleric,
first class. You knew him.

599
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,000
News bulletin...
I'm a sense offender.

600
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,200
I don't hang around much
with the Cleric.

601
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,000
I want to know about him.

602
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,500
Well...

603
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,700
I suggest you go ask him.

604
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,800
But I understand
that he's dead...

605
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,500
killed by your friends
at the Tetragrammaton.

606
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,200
Not by my friends.

607
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,000
By <i>me.</i>

608
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,300
Aaah!

609
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,000
You were lovers.

610
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,700
The Underground is our foe,

611
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,400
and greater
than even the threat

612
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,300
of those who have forsaken
their Prozium for emotion

613
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,500
is the threat of those
selfsame individuals united.

614
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,300
They are
the secret organization...

615
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,800
And thus, it is in the writing
of the Father

616
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,600
that we find our greatest...

617
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,400
Good afternoon, sir.

618
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,300
What will it be for you?

619
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,100
The latest copy
of the inserts?

620
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,400
Revised edition
of the manifesto?

621
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,500
Errol Partridge.

622
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,100
What do you know about him?

623
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,500
I beg your pardon?

624
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,400
Everyone out. Now.

625
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,200
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

626
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,900
Errol Partridge...
what do you know about him?

627
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,900
I'm sure this must be
some mis...

628
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,200
- You're an offender.
- I'm not.

629
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,100
No? Then why are you
so scared of me?

630
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,300
Now, you will tell me everything
you know about Errol Partridge,

631
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,300
or I will have a wagon
come to take you

632
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,200
to the Hall of Destruction
for summary combustion.

633
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,400
I-I really don't know...

634
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,500
Speak!

635
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,200
He... he'd come in here
with a fellow named Jurgen.

636
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,500
Why?

637
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,700
That's... that's all I know.
I swear.

638
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,800
Jurgen!

639
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,300
Interesting.

640
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,500
- Ugh-ow!
- Ugh!

641
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,400
We've been watching you,
Preston.

642
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,900
You're Jurgen.

643
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,300
You're feeling.

644
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,700
Do you know why you came?

645
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,000
Welcome to the Underground.

646
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,000
Polygraph.

647
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,100
It detects fluctuations
of human emotion.

648
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,300
We have to be sure.

649
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,900
Mary.

650
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,600
You're carrying
in your left pocket

651
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,600
a red ribbon
sprayed with her scent.

652
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,700
You breathe it in sometimes

653
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,700
when you think
there's no one to see.

654
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,700
But what you feel...

655
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,300
what you feel
could only be satisfied

656
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,000
by falling yourself into her.

657
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:39,900
She's scheduled
for combustion...

658
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,200
tomorrow.

659
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,200
I know.

660
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,900
You know, I was like you.

661
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,900
But the first thing
you learn about emotion

662
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,400
is that it has its price...

663
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,300
a complete paradox.

664
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,300
But without restraint...

665
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,600
without control...

666
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,600
emotion is chaos.

667
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,700
But how is that diff...

668
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,300
The difference being is
that when we want to feel,

669
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,500
we can.

670
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,100
It's just that...

671
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:26,100
some of us...

672
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,400
some of us have to forgo
that luxury

673
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,600
so that the rest can have it.

674
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,700
Some very few of us

675
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,800
have to force ourselves
not to feel.

676
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,700
Like me.

677
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,500
Like you.

678
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,500
What can I do?

679
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,200
You can kill Father.

680
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,500
Cleric John Preston...

681
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,300
You are to come with us
immediately.

682
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,600
Cleric Preston.

683
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:48,900
Sir.

684
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,900
I've heard
the most disturbing rumor.

685
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,300
Rumor, sir?

686
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,300
Yes.

687
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,700
A rumor maintaining
that one of us,

688
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,100
one of the Cleric,

689
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,300
has secretly taken it upon
himself to cease his dose,

690
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,200
that one of our elite number

691
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,500
is actually feeling.

692
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,500
Feeling, sir?

693
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,200
Are you playing with me,
Cleric?!

694
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,800
No, sir.

695
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,600
This person, I'm told,

696
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,400
is actually attempting
to contact the Resistance.

697
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,900
Now tell me,
if you'll be so kind,

698
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,900
how exactly...

699
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:47,100
have you been making use
of your time of late?

700
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,200
Attempting to contact
the Resistance, sir.

701
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,800
Attempting?

702
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,600
How is it that you intend
to expose this traitor

703
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,700
if all you do is attempt?

704
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,800
You're...

705
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,700
absolutely...

706
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,000
100% right, sir.

707
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,500
Of course I am.

708
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,400
The Cleric is the final line
of defense.

709
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,700
If the Resistance
compromises it,

710
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,200
we are doomed.

711
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:41,100
Father is doomed.

712
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,800
I will redouble
my efforts, sir,

713
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,600
to locate the Resistance,

714
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,200
to find this traitor,

715
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,600
and bring them all to
the Council's fair justice.

716
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,000
Do it.

717
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,600
What are you doing?

718
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,600
What are you doing?

719
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,000
I, uh...

720
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,900
I was checking
to make sure you've been...

721
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,700
taking your interval.

722
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,500
And are you satisfied?

723
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,200
Yes, I am.

724
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,900
Good night, Dad.

725
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,700
I don't understand.

726
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,400
My execution's set.

727
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,900
Why are you here?

728
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,600
Aren't you gonna dose?

729
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,400
My God.

730
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,400
What...

731
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,600
What'll you do?

732
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,900
I don't know.

733
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,800
50 sweepers, maybe more.

734
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,300
What about an audience? Can you
arrange to meet with him?

735
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,400
Father's never given a single
audience since the upheaval.

736
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,000
The danger of assassination
is too great.

737
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,300
They trained you your whole life
to fight these kind of odds.

738
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,000
Even if I could...

739
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,900
even if I could
make it through,

740
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:01,100
what guarantee is there
it would accomplish anything,

741
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,700
that anything would be
different?

742
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,600
We have a network that's larger
than you could ever imagine.

743
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,500
Instant word comes
that Father is dead,

744
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,100
that the Council is leaderless.

745
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,300
Bombs that have already
been planted will be set off

746
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,600
at Prozium clinics and factories
around Libria.

747
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,000
If we can succeed
in disrupting the supply

748
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,800
for even one day... one day...

749
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,400
our cause will be won
by human nature itself.

750
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,500
What about war, the everyday
cruelties that are all gone now?

751
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,600
Replaced by the touch
of Grammaton.

752
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,500
Will you do it?

753
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,400
Yes.

754
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,300
Can you?

755
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,800
I don't know.

756
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,600
Don't...

757
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,900
Seeing her one last time

758
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,100
will only make it harder
to do what you have to do.

759
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,300
...designed especially
to deal with it.

760
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,900
The Cleric was implemented

761
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,400
and sent out to search
and destroy

762
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,900
such objects that remained

763
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,900
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

764
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,400
File footage.

765
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,100
The Council...

766
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,700
Viviana Preston.

767
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,800
Sentence and incineration.

768
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,600
Auditory.

769
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,000
Viviana Preston,

770
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,500
for ceasing your interval,
for the crime of feeling,

771
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,700
you stand condemned

772
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,000
to suffer annihilation
in the city furnaces.

773
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,500
You will be taken there
immediately, and you will burn.

774
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,400
The Cleric was implemented

775
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,300
and sent out to search
and destroy

776
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,900
such objects that remained

777
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,100
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

778
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,100
The Council...

779
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,800
The incineration...
has it gone through?!

780
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,600
It's going through now.

781
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,200
Hey!

782
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:05,000
Machine turbines priming.

783
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,700
Machine turbines priming.

784
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,800
Tetragrammaton... I need
to speak to this woman!

785
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,500
You're too late, sir.
The time lock is engaged.

786
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,800
If we force the door now,

787
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,400
the turbines will explode
at street level.

788
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,900
...personnel,
clear the area immediately.

789
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,400
All unauthorized personnel,
clear the area immediately.

790
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,600
Turbines primed.

791
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,300
Fire in 10 seconds...

792
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,200
9 seconds...

793
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,600
8 seconds...

794
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,000
7 seconds...

795
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,300
6 seconds...

796
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,400
5 seconds...

797
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,600
4 seconds...

798
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,300
3 seconds...

799
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,900
2 seconds...

800
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,200
Turbines... fire.

801
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:39,200
Cleric John Preston...

802
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,800
You are under arrest.

803
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,300
This man...

804
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,700
this senior Cleric...

805
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,600
has ceased the dose.

806
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,300
He is feeling!

807
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:02,200
He is the worm that has been
eating at the core

808
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:05,100
of our great society!

809
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,900
And I...

810
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:09,900
I have brought him
for your justice.

811
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,600
Ugh!

812
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:18,500
I told you I'd make my career
with you, Preston.

813
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,000
Vice-Council...

814
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,300
This man is guilty

815
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,200
of consorting
with sense offenders,

816
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,500
of having relations
with a female,

817
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,800
of sense crime itself.

818
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,200
Dispatch a search team
to the Cleric's quarters

819
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,300
to search for unused...

820
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,700
Uh, that won't be
necessary, sir.

821
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,500
If you'll run the trace
record on his side arm,

822
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,800
you will find
that it was he

823
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,700
who was with the sweeper team
when they were murdered.

824
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,700
Cleric...

825
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:53,000
I assume you have something
to say to me.

826
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,600
I know...

827
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,200
it's hard to believe...

828
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,700
...that a Cleric
of the Tetragrammaton

829
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,900
could turn his back
on everything he's been taught,

830
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,400
would become associated
with the Resistance,

831
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:14,700
even becoming a champion
in its Underground.

832
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,800
But it's true.

833
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,200
I promised that I would
bring you that man.

834
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,300
And I have.

835
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,400
- Cleric Brandt...
- Sir?

836
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,400
The trace shows
that it was your gun

837
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,100
in the Nether
with the sweepers.

838
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,700
That's impossible.

839
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,200
This is wrong.

840
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,000
I think, in the end...

841
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:52,000
it'll be better
if you have it.

842
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,800
He switched them.

843
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,600
He switched them.

844
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,400
See, I have his gun now.

845
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,200
Of course you do. You took it
when you arrested me.

846
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,200
What?

847
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,500
Take him
to the Hall of Destruction

848
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,900
for summary judgment
and combustion.

849
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,400
Wait, wait, wait. Wait!
I can explain this.

850
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,600
Uh, sir, I'm not feeling!

851
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:15,000
He is the one who's feeling!

852
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,700
This is a mistake!

853
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,600
Of course...

854
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:23,500
since a complaint
has been lodged,

855
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,500
law and the letter
is that I allow a team

856
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,000
to carry out the search
of your premises.

857
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,200
Do you think that's entirely
necessary, Cleric,

858
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:35,300
or am I being
too... exacting?

859
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,700
As you say, sir,

860
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,700
it's the law and the letter.

861
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,800
And it doesn't disturb you
in the least

862
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,200
that your colleague
is going to his end?

863
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,700
The only thing
that disturbs me, sir,

864
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,500
is that I am Father's instrument
against the Underground,

865
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,700
and yet... I've never had
the honor of meeting him.

866
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,700
Hmm.

867
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,500
Yes, but, Cleric, you know

868
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,600
that Father never grants
an audience to anyone.

869
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,100
Even to the man
who brings him the Resistance?

870
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,200
Sorry, sir.
Just a formality.

871
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,400
The search team will be up
momentarily.

872
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,100
Excellent.
I have nothing to hide.

873
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,400
The search teams are
already inside, sir.

874
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,700
Excellent.

875
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,900
Looking for something?

876
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,400
If I were you...

877
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:22,600
I'd be more careful
in the future.

878
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,000
How long?

879
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,400
Since Mom.

880
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,400
And Lisa?

881
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,800
Of course.

882
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,200
How did you know?

883
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,800
You forget...

884
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,300
it's my job to know
what you're thinking.

885
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,000
Then you know what
I'm gonna do now.

886
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,800
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

887
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,500
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

888
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,500
It's done.

889
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,900
I've located the Resistance.

890
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,300
Come now.

891
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,400
You'll have them all.

892
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:34,900
Do not address Father
unless first addressed by him.

893
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,200
Avoid eye contact.

894
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:39,500
If you should break
his personal security zone,

895
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,100
you will be immediately
put down by snipers.

896
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,800
Is that understood?

897
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:47,000
You'll be required to surrender
your firearm, of course,

898
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,100
and then there's the test.

899
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,500
Test?

900
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,900
Yes.

901
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
You didn't imagine
we would risk exposing Father

902
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,500
to even such a dedicated servant
as yourself

903
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,900
without first having
tested you, did you?

904
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,500
Please.

905
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,800
Cleric...

906
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,900
your weapon, please.

907
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,500
Here.

908
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,500
Sit.

909
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,100
We'll start with
a test question first.

910
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,500
More of a riddle, actually.

911
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,000
What would you say
is the easiest way

912
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,300
to get a weapon away
from a Grammaton Cleric?

913
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,500
You ask him for it.

914
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:11,600
I told you I'd make
my career with you, Cleric.

915
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,400
...to combine the capacity...

916
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,300
Preston...

917
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,800
Brandt's job was simple...

918
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,400
to make you feel
like you'd won,

919
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,600
to make you feel safe.

920
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,300
For years, I tried
to infiltrate an agent

921
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,900
into the Underground...

922
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,400
...until it hit me...

923
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:43,200
in order to pass undetected
into their midst,

924
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:46,000
in order to be trusted by them,

925
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:51,500
my provocateur would
have to think like them

926
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,400
and would have to feel
like them.

927
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,400
But where to find
such a man...

928
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:02,800
a man with the capacity to feel
who didn't yet know it?

929
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,500
But...

930
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,800
we've never met.

931
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,700
No?

932
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,300
Don't look so surprised,
Preston.

933
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,200
Why should Father be more real

934
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:23,700
than any other
political puppet?

935
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,700
The real Father died
years ago.

936
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,700
The Council simply elected me

937
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,700
to pursue
his paternal tradition.

938
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,900
And you, Preston,

939
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,900
the supposed savior
of the Resistance,

940
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,800
are now its destroyer,

941
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:43,600
and, along with them,
you've given me yourself...

942
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,400
calmly...

943
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,300
cooly...

944
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:52,100
entirely without incident.

945
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,800
No.

946
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,400
Oh...

947
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,300
Shit.

948
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,000
Not without incident.

949
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,500
I'm coming.

950
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,300
You really should learn
to knock.

951
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:15,300
How did it feel, Preston?

952
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,100
- Agh!
- Ugh! Ugh! Uhh-ah!

953
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,400
Wah!

954
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,200
Ugh! Agh! Uhh!

955
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,800
Ugh!

956
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,100
Ugh!

957
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,200
- Aggh!
- Aggh!

958
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:58,900
Mind the uniform, Cleric.

959
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,700
I plan to be wearing it
for a long time.

960
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,200
Be careful, Preston.

961
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:48,600
You're treading on my dreams.

962
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,000
Ohh!

963
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,800
Wait!

964
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:27,900
Wait.

965
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,400
Look at me.

966
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,600
Look at me.

967
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,400
I'm life.

968
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:37,900
I live, I-I breathe...

969
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,500
I feel.

970
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:46,300
Now that you know it...

971
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,200
can you really take it?

972
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,300
Is it really worth the price?

973
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,100
I pay it gladly.

in his conquest
of the known world,

Alexander the Great

more than one million

Three centuries later,

Gaius Germanicus, "Caligula,"
murdered his own sister,
