1
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,300
- I'm so...
- I'm so glad you called.

2
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,343
I'm so glad you were free.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,308
God, I love your eyes.

4
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,720
Okay, now what?

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,517
Cup my balls.

6
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,395
- Okay, yes.
- All right. I can do that.

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,850
- Oh! There it is.
- There we go.

8
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,938
That feels good.

9
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,322
You know what to do.

10
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,572
Okay, you know what? Slow it down, slow it down.

11
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,529
Okay. Slow it down.

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,368
There we go. How's that?

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:16,293
That's good, nice and slow. See?
Doesn't that feel good?

14
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,585
Yeah. No, I want to go fast.

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,504
You want to go fast? Fast.

16
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,251
Yeah. No...

17
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,677
Oh, yeah. That feels good.

18
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,095
Oh, Yeah.

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,342
Yeah.

20
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,926
Okay. You know what? I think...

21
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,852
I think maybe we are on different rhythms here.

22
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,735
I was having a nightmare. I was so scared.

23
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,322
Good morning.

24
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,905
You look beautiful.

25
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,327
No, I'm sure I look terrible.

26
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,370
I just woke up. Are you kidding?

27
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,244
I'm sure I'm a mess.

28
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,499
You slept over.

29
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,248
I did.

30
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,921
I thought we had a rule against that.

31
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,122
Oh.

32
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,083
I'm kidding. Oh.

33
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,542
That was funny. I'm kidding.

34
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,503
You're funny in the morning.

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,179
I like hanging out with you. Oh. Yeah.

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,679
I love hanging out with you. I
think we get along really well

37
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,433
and you're so sexy.

38
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,355
I know.

39
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,728
I just have a lot coming up at work

40
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,485
and I don't want to make promises I can't keep.

41
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,365
You know what I mean? I know you do.

42
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,408
Yeah. We're on the same page.

43
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,454
I'm not looking for a relationship right
now, either. Let's just say that.

44
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,373
Whatever you wanna... I can do...

45
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,373
I'd rather just... I like simple... I'm not like other girls.

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,547
I'm not like, "Be my boyfriend!"
Unless you were like, "Yeah!"

47
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,624
Then I'd be like, "Maybe."

48
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,002
Mmm. But let's not.

49
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,133
I don't want that either.

50
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,396
Wow, this is so awkward. I really want you to leave,

51
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,275
but I don't know how to say it
without sounding like a dick.

52
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,049
Come on! Hands behind your heads! Let's go! Sit-ups!

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,595
You're looking like pieces of bacon on a plate.

54
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,593
It's disgusting! I smell the fat!

55
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,258
- He scares me.
- Me, too.

56
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,468
But he's an excellent motivator.

57
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,765
That's true.

58
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,812
What are you looking at?

59
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,057
Oh, Shit, he sees us. Oh, God.

60
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,897
Hey! Hey!

61
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,856
If you want to take this class,

62
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,029
you're going to have to pay for it

63
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,114
like the rest of these bitches!

64
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,285
What, are you dancing? In the park... Dance class?

65
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,242
You are not dancing. You are not dancing in the park!

66
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,247
- Go, go, go, go!
- Freeloaders!

67
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,495
I'm coming over there.

68
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,118
- Is he coming?
- I'm coming after you!

69
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,579
Sorry, Rodney. We're on a budget.

70
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,006
- Oh, come on!
- It's only 12 bucks!

71
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,591
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,256
Come on! You fucking freeloaders.

73
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,677
We are out of our minds. I know.

74
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,758
That's okay. I'm so glad that we got to do this.

75
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,059
I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.

76
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,685
Mmm. I've been in Chicago a lot.

77
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,768
I know. Sleeping at Dougie's house.

78
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,474
Well, it's just closer to work.

79
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,062
How is it going with him anyway?

80
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,019
I don't know. I mean, it's fine,

81
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,021
but I just feel like he's been distant lately.

82
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,857
And I don't know...

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,408
He calls me "dude" a lot.

84
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,610
That doesn't mean anything.

85
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,074
I think everything is fine.

86
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,621
I don't know. Anyway,

87
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,453
what did you do last night?

88
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,367
Umm...

89
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,952
What did you do last night?

90
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,961
You are not telling me something.

91
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,380
I hung out with Ted for a little bit.

92
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,384
I knew it! We had fun.

93
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,548
It was fun. Here's what I don't like about it.

94
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,935
You hate yourself after you see him, every time.

95
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,220
And then we go through this,
and then you feel like shit,

96
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,772
and it's almost like you're doing it

97
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,357
because you feel bad about yourself.

98
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,149
He called me late, and we hung out.

99
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,855
It wasn't a big deal. And you know what? It was fun.

100
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,323
Ew! You had sex with him.

101
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,662
We had an adult sleepover.

102
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,370
Ooh. Did you let him sleep over in your mouth?

103
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,503
Annie! I'm sorry!

104
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,499
You're unbelievable. He kept putting it near my face.

105
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:56,966
They do that, don't they?

106
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,175
Why do they do that? Let us offer.

107
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,502
If we don't offer...

108
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,595
Please. You're supposed to slap it away.

109
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,671
I couldn't.

110
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,554
You don't want to look right at it.

111
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,847
No.

112
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,976
It's too aggressive. It's like...

113
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,432
"Hello."

114
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,561
That's my impression.

115
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,608
Those are the balls?

116
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,276
Yeah. I'm trying to make it round,

117
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,986
but I can't because I have elbows.

118
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,695
He is so hot, though.

119
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,033
Look, I know you say he's cute and all that stuff,

120
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,079
but it makes you feel like shit, you know?

121
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,157
You're a total catch, and any guy

122
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,284
would be psyched to be your man.

123
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,712
You should just make room

124
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,252
for somebody who is nice to you.

125
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,333
You know what? He's honest!

126
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,168
He told me that we are what we are

127
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,045
and we're just having fun. And I like that.

128
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,348
He also told you that you need
dental work. He's an asshole.

129
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,221
I don't need dental work.

130
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,893
You're right.

131
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,186
There is nothing wrong with my teeth.

132
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,188
You are so beautiful.

133
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,478
Will you marry me? Yes.

134
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,651
I love you.

135
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,496
I don't want to go to work today. Mmm-mmm.

136
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,664
Let's see how many times Terry's called me.

137
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,740
Oh! Only 15!

138
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,371
You know what, Terry? I don't want

139
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,248
to pick up your monkey lamps. Sorry!

140
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,416
Monkey lamps?

141
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,375
Ugh. I cannot wait to never work
for a psychopath again.

142
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,967
Oh! Annie!

143
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,013
I'm sorry. I should have gone down Mason.

144
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,675
Well, I'm the genius that opened
a bakery during the recession.

145
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,098
They were good cakes, Annie.

146
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,520
Thank you.

147
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,724
Come on. Look away, look away, look away.

148
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,564
Do you have any ideas of styles?

149
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,818
Oh, I don't know. What do you think, honey?

150
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,111
Whatever you want.

151
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,242
Look at how you guys are making
this decision together.

152
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,453
That's sweet. You guys love each other, huh?

153
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,030
Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,870
Ohh! That's sweet. That will go away.

155
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,666
You cannot trust anybody, ever.

156
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,967
Especially someone you're in a relationship with.

157
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,465
'Cause they're living with you, you don't

158
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,095
know who you're sleeping next to. It is scary.

159
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,800
I mean, look at him. He may not even be Asian.

160
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,972
It is scary.

161
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,848
So did you guys want to look
at these engagement rings?

162
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,184
We're going to browse. Okay, sure.

163
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,609
I'll be here.

164
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,824
Thank you.

165
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,692
What was that about?

166
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,576
Umm, nothing. They had to run.
They had to go somewhere.

167
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,827
And no wonder. You're selling lifelong happiness.

168
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,955
You're not telling everyone about your problems

169
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,536
and how your boyfriend left you,

170
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,207
and maybe marriage will work out.

171
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,835
Show me your "love is eternal" face.

172
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,512
No, that's two years, four years
tops. That is not eternal.

173
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,341
Kahlua, can you come over here for a second, please?

174
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,175
What's up, Don-Don?

175
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,848
You make up the best nicknames.

176
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,722
You don't need a nickname because
Kahlua is so delicious.

177
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,019
Don't sue me for touching you.

178
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,652
Show Annie your "love is eternal" face.

179
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,865
That looks like you have menstrual cramps.

180
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,409
Thank you so much, Kahlua.

181
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,077
Now, why can't you be more like Kahlua?

182
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,207
Look, I'm trying really hard.

183
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,417
You've just got to try harder.

184
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,294
The whole reason you have got this job, Annie,

185
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,343
is because your mom is my sponsor
in AA, and I'm doing her a favor.

186
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,418
I understand.

187
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,047
Oscar, get back to work.

188
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,933
You shouldn't be behind the counter.

189
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,901
Andrew, you are not the father!

190
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,738
That's great. Yeah.

191
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,573
Stop that. Don't do that.

192
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,823
Hey, Brynn.

193
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,282
Oh, hey, roomie.

194
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,084
Guess what happened to me today. Hmm. What?

195
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,290
I got a free tattoo. You did what?

196
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,211
I could not believe it. The guy
said, "Do you want a tattoo?"

197
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,257
Just a random...

198
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,126
Yeah, opened up the side of his van. No.

199
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,632
He said, "it's for free!" And I said, "Sure."

200
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,054
You said yes? Yeah!

201
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,508
Yeah. Look. See here?

202
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,968
What is it?

203
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,095
See that?

204
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,684
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Brynn!

205
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,107
It's a Mexican drinking worm.

206
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,444
It's a Native American symbol meaning "wasted."

207
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,521
Okay, Brynn, just so you know, it's...

208
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,232
Gil, hi. Hello. How are you?

209
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,989
Have you seen your sister's tattoo? It's really infected.

210
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,235
Better get a little bit of ice on it.

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,486
Yeah, a little bit.

212
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,913
Stick some frozen peas on there.

213
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,036
Yeah. It can't hurt. All right.

214
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,459
So, I just wanted a quick word.

215
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,371
You know that tomorrow the rent is due.

216
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,626
I was getting my check, and I wondered

217
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,964
if I could get your check, too?

218
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,293
Yes. I'm getting the money.

219
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,049
It's been a little slow.

220
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,055
You have to keep it in the bag and put the bag on it.

221
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,726
So, the check?

222
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,894
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

223
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,322
Because it's a kind of, like, "needing
it today"-type situation.

224
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,489
It's coming.

225
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,160
- Who is it?
- Me!

226
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,324
Who is it?

227
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,281
Oh, my God. Hurry up, your creepy neighbor asked me

228
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,911
if I wanted to watch the news again.

229
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,537
Sorry. He is so gross.

230
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,086
- Please, come on in.
- Let me take your magazines.

231
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,256
Welcome to the magazine and wine party. Ooh!

232
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,216
Have a seat.

233
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,544
I'm very happy that you are here.

234
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,676
What? Because I want to eat an apple.

235
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,300
Would you like some apple?

236
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,558
What is that? I got engaged.

237
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,226
What? He asked me last night.

238
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,978
What? I know!

239
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,525
That's why he's been acting so weird

240
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,773
'cause he's a terrible liar, and he
thought he was gonna blow it.

241
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,899
He was ignoring me and I thought

242
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,112
he was going to break up with me.

243
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,314
Oh, my gosh.

244
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,651
Oh, my gosh!

245
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,823
I know!

246
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,404
Lil!

247
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,951
I'm shocked, still.

248
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,532
But I'm happy. Can you believe this?

249
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,414
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I just got hot.

250
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,749
You did? Are you okay?

251
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,795
Yes. My pits are sweating.

252
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,463
My stomach hurts. I'm hot. What does that mean?

253
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,713
Oh, my God! What is happening?

254
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,962
I don't know. I'm wearing a ring.

255
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,633
I can't believe it.

256
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,885
Lil, you're getting married.

257
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,264
I'm getting married.

258
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,884
And you'll be my maid of honor.

259
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,471
God, of course I will!

260
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,931
It will be super fun. It's gonna be really fun.

261
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,062
Yeah. You know, we can plan everything together.

262
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,690
My God! Planning your wedding...

263
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,027
Are you sure you're up for it?

264
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,356
I know it's a lot to ask and to put on your plate.

265
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,409
And you're going through a tricky
time, and you're super-busy...

266
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,985
Stop. It's a lot to ask.

267
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,115
Stop. Okay.

268
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,949
It's fine. And I'm more than happy
to do it, and it's not too much.

269
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,289
Oh! Look at that. It's my fiancé calling.

270
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,832
Oh, your fiancé.

271
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,504
Hi, baby, what's up?

272
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,964
it's Annie. I just told her! Yeah, she's so happy.

273
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,340
No, I'm not!

274
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,592
"Yay," she said.

275
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,633
What, baby?

276
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,059
I know, I miss you, too.

277
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,684
Yeah, I'll meet you in an hour.

278
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,850
I love you, too.

279
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,628
Wow.

280
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,884
Wynonna Judd.

281
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,719
That's really good.

282
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,550
Painting those giant bangs was a royal pain in my can.

283
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,681
And those teeth! I should have
painted her mouth shut.

284
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,146
Can you just get dressed? We're gonna
be late for the engagement party.

285
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,347
Oh, I forgot to tell you, honey. What?

286
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,556
Forgot to tell you. What?

287
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,486
I signed up to speak at AA tonight, and I just have to.

288
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,777
Mom! No.

289
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,356
I forgot. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

290
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,908
I keep telling you, you're not supposed
to go to those things.

291
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,075
You're not an alcoholic.

292
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,119
Only because I've never had a drink.

293
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,331
What? They are inspiring.

294
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,996
There is this one story I've just
got to tell you. Sit down.

295
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,453
Okay.

296
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,954
This gentleman

297
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,211
who started blow-jobbing to get crack.
His name is Marvin Johnson...

298
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,087
Mom, anonymous. You keep...
It's no names. Okay, okay.

299
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,422
Forget it. Marvin J. Whatever.

300
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,091
Too late. Well, he became a gay prostitute.

301
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,472
And he realized that he had hit his bottom.

302
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,101
And I have been thinking, honey,

303
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,058
that maybe this is your bottom.

304
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,979
I'm telling you, hitting bottom is a good thing.

305
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,691
Because there's nowhere to go but up.

306
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,195
Right? Yep. That's what you say.

307
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,531
Yeah, a positive message. Yeah.

308
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,659
Yeah. Thanks for the pep talk, Mom.

309
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,831
Honey. Anytime, anytime.

310
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,659
All right. I guess I'm going to Lillian's
party by myself, then.

311
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,044
Don't talk to me about being by yourself.

312
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,456
I go everywhere by myself.

313
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,086
Thanks to that new whore, Barb.

314
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,964
Mom, come on. No, I don't like to say it.

315
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,885
They've been married 12 years.

316
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,801
Okay. But she's still a whore.

317
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,384
I'm sure she greets him in the evening, beaver first.

318
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,143
I don't want to think about that.

319
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,807
I bet she got that car by giving
your dad something sexually.

320
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,813
'Cause there was one thing I would never do,

321
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,315
and I'm sure Barb is a champion at it.

322
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,611
I don't want to know.

323
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,527
It's called a "chicken coop." Of course it is.

324
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,483
You start at the back and you peck your way

325
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,988
to the front like you have a beak.

326
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,321
And then you end up with two eggs in your mouth.

327
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,164
That's gross.

328
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,867
Well, I'm sure your dad likes it.

329
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,248
Of course, he grew up on a farm.

330
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,329
Okay.

331
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,672
You sure you don't want to move in with me?

332
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,214
Mom, thanks, but no way.

333
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,761
No way in hell. Yeah?

334
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,837
No, thanks.

335
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,343
Think about it. Okay.

336
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,548
You don't need your own place.

337
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah, I Kind of do. Okay.

338
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,010
All right, I'm going to go. All right.

339
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,454
Holy shit.

340
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,129
Ohh. Valet. Perfect.

341
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,593
Sorry. Needs a wash.

342
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,807
You have to punch it a few times.

343
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,904
Annie!

344
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,819
Oh, my God!

345
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,830
Oh, my God, Lillian. I know.

346
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,991
This is your engagement party. Isn't that crazy?

347
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,747
It's so beautiful.

348
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,828
I can't believe Dougie's boss is a member here.

349
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,503
I know, and his parents, too. And Dougie, I guess.

350
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,792
Gosh, and me, I guess, too, now.

351
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,803
Come on, let's go say hi to the rest of the bridal party!

352
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,507
You remember my cousin Rita?

353
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,633
Rita. Annie.

354
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,517
I haven't seen you since you graduated high school.

355
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,888
She has three kids now.

356
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,108
- Three boys.
- They're so cute.

357
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,857
They are cute, but when they reach that age,

358
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,312
they are disgusting.

359
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,318
They smell, they are sticky,

360
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,483
they say things that are horrible,

361
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,615
and there is semen all over everything, okay?

362
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,286
Disgusting.

363
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,455
I cracked a blanket in half.

364
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,283
Do you get where I'm going with that? I do.

365
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,583
I cracked it in half.

366
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,918
What?

367
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,630
Annie, this is Becca, my friend from work.

368
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,706
We are in the trenches together.

369
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,961
Hey. it's great to meet you. Hey, how are you?

370
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,296
Nice to meet you.

371
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,543
This is my husband, Kevin.

372
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,844
Hi. "Husband."

373
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,136
I like to say it. We are newlyweds.

374
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,468
Wow. Congratulations.

375
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,723
Thank you so much.

376
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,430
We went on a sweetheart honeymoon. Oh.

377
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,766
Where did you guys go?

378
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,222
Disney World. Disney World.

379
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,682
We finish each ether's sentences. Sorry.

380
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,438
Sorry. Is this your husband?

381
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,191
No, no, no, no, no.

382
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,992
I don't know him. I'm sorry.

383
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,821
Do you want to go for a walk later?

384
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,538
Oh. I can't.

385
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,829
All right. I can't. I'm sorry.

386
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,205
I'm so sorry.

387
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,378
I'm not with anybody. I'm here solo.

388
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,419
Let's start it again. I'm Becca. Rewind.

389
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,503
This is my husband. You don't have a husband.

390
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,587
Sorry.

391
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,515
And this is Dougie's sister, Megan.

392
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,682
- Hey.
- Hi.

393
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,262
My grandma is not supposed to
have wine. I'll be right back.

394
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,270
Hey. Hey. How is it going?

395
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,319
It's going great. It's going great. I'm on the mend.

396
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,237
I just got some pins in my legs.

397
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,450
Believe it or not, pins in my legs,
I can still do this. Right?

398
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,948
I fell off a cruise ship, but I'm back.

399
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,620
Oh, shit. Yeah, "Oh, shit."

400
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,368
Yeah, "Oh, shit."

401
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,877
Took a hard, hard, violent fall. Kind of pin balled down.

402
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,171
Hit a lot of railings, broke a lot of shit.

403
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,295
I'm not going to say I survived,
I'm going to say I thrived.

404
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,380
I met a dolphin down there.

405
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,680
And I swear to God, that dolphin looked not at me,

406
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,971
but into my soul.

407
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,720
Into my goddamn soul, Annie.

408
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,476
And he said, "I'm saving you, Megan."

409
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,140
Not with his mouth, but he said
it, I'm assuming, telepathically

410
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,858
We had a connection that I don't
even know if I can... Jesus.

411
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,487
Hey, shut my mouth. Look at... Unbelievable.

412
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,738
You must be Annie's fella.

413
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,036
I'm Megan. It's a pleasure.

414
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,202
He's not... I'm not... He's not... I'm not with him.

415
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,744
Sorry. All right.

416
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm glad he's single, because I'm
going to climb that like a tree.

417
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,165
Okay. You have to meet Helen.

418
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,921
There she is. Helen.

419
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,055
Come here!

420
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,269
Helen, this is Annie.

421
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,345
Hi! Ohh!

422
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,308
There she is. Maid of honor.

423
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,519
So lovely to meet Lillian's childhood friend.

424
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,401
You are so pretty.

425
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,525
You are so cute! You are so sweet.

426
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,576
Helen is married to Dougie's boss, Mr. Harris. Perry.

427
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,531
Perry. And they are so close now,

428
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,367
they are literally joined at the hip.

429
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,202
Which is good, because so are we.

430
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,505
I know. I'm so glad you guys are finally meeting.

431
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,582
I know. Me, too. I know. it's lovely.

432
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,419
Well, excuse me, I better go
check on the hors d'oeuvres.

433
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,254
But it was great to finally meet you.

434
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,047
It's a great party.

435
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,427
- Enjoy.
- Bye.

436
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,884
- Bye.
- Bye.

437
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,267
She's great, isn't she?

438
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,973
She's awesome.

439
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,693
And I really look forward to having
Doug as part of our family.

440
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,984
So much so that you two should get married right now

441
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,531
and save me a shitload of money.

442
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,282
Dad.

443
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,203
Everybody always laughs at that, but I'm not joking.

444
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,619
I'm not joking.

445
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,329
Anyway, I want to thank all of you for coming.

446
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,381
And here's to Doug and my baby girl, Lillian.

447
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,421
Cheers! Cheers!

448
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,047
- I love you, Dad.
- Enough of me.

449
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,844
Let's get the maid of honor up here.

450
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,010
All right. Annie?

451
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,722
Umm. Hi. I'm Annie Walker.

452
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,182
Yay, Annie!

453
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:32,686
I'm not going to go on with a big
speech, so I'll just say this.

454
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,231
I'm so happy to be a part of this celebration.

455
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,190
And you two deserve each other,

456
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,234
as well as a lifetime of happiness.

457
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,660
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

458
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,453
- Love you guys.
- Cheers.

459
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,993
Thanks, Annie. Cheers.

460
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,119
Thank you, Annie. That was so sweet. Thank you.

461
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,416
Lil, remember that trip we took
to Miami with the boys?

462
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,209
And they were working the entire weekend,

463
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,887
and we just sat and drank wine and ate peanut brittle.

464
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:03,887
And I shared things with you that
I've never shared with anyone.

465
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:09,188
And you made me realize how I can trust people again.

466
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,227
So let me just say,

467
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,568
Lillian, you are my best friend.

468
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,612
And I'm so proud of you.

469
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,159
Sorry. And, Dougly...

470
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,324
I'm sorry, inside joke.

471
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,204
You better not keep my Lil on a leash

472
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,160
because I still need my drunken Saturday nights

473
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,416
at Rockin' Sushi, okay?

474
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:39,552
Everybody raise your glasses
to the couple of the decade,

475
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,504
Doug and Lillian.

476
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,308
Have a great night. Dessert wine is out.

477
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,936
Dessert wine, yummy. Excuse me.

478
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,100
Umm...

479
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,525
I just wanted to say really quick that

480
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,108
you are so special to me, because...

481
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,161
Well, one of the reasons is because I've
known you my whole entire life.

482
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,245
And you've really helped shape who I am.

483
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,661
I just want to thank you for carefully selecting me

484
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,496
as your maid of honor.

485
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,458
I know you had some other choices,

486
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,965
but you are like my sister, and I love you.

487
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,797
Well, that concludes the speeches for the night.

488
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,882
Thank you. One last thing.

489
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,266
It's rare to meet someone as an adult
who you really connect with,

490
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,470
and that's you, Lil.

491
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,182
I went to Thailand recently with my husband, Perry,

492
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,643
and there is a beautiful saying that I learned there.

493
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,570
It means, "You are a part of me,

494
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,155
"a part that I could never live without,

495
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:54,085
"and I hope and I pray that I never have to."

496
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,384
And that's it for tonight. Thank you for coming.

497
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,676
Really quick, Thank you all for coming.

498
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,379
I just wanted to say really quick...

499
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,131
Dessert wine is out. Consuelo?

500
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,591
Really quick. Speaking of Consuelo,

501
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,975
Lillian and I took Spanish together in school.

502
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,895
And so, I would just like to say
to you, and to everyone here...

503
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,790
Thank you.

504
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,752
Thank you. I feel so close to you and can trust you.

505
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,132
You are my angel and soul mate.

506
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:51,388
And I feel I can communicate
with you with simply a look.

507
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,312
Thank you for coming.

508
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,811
Here, I'll take that. I'll take that.

509
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,939
Yep, I got it.

510
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,026
Lillian...

511
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,785
Keep smiling, keep shining

512
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:21,088
Knowing you can always count on me

513
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,293
For sure

514
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,126
That's what friends are for

515
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,713
In good times and bad times

516
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:34,678
I'll be on your side forever more

517
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,478
That's what friends are for

518
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,347
That's what friends are for

519
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,617
Man, engagement parties rule.

520
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,664
It made me feel awesome,

521
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,458
like I can go out and catch another dude to marry.

522
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,290
So, what's up with her, anyway? With Helen?

523
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,626
What? I'm just like...

524
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,461
I don't know. She's in your wedding

525
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,717
and you've only known her eight
months, though, right?

526
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,715
Come on. Get it out, get it all out.

527
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,555
I'm just... Like, the whole gown, and the...thing.

528
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,480
It's just weird, right? You know what?

529
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,900
She's actually really cool, Annie.

530
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,319
She's really... She's a good one. I'm telling you.

531
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,773
Well, I'm sure if you like her, I will like her.

532
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,321
You have to just get to know her.

533
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,198
Yeah. Which I think you really should.

534
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,120
And... Will you just do me a favor?

535
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,697
Would you just hang out with her once,

536
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,324
just the two of you. All right?

537
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,000
As a favor to me.

538
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,247
Okay, I will.

539
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,503
I love you, Annie Lou. I love you, too.

540
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,626
Bye. Bye.

541
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,041
Oh. Hi, I'm Helen.

542
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,923
You live in Milwaukee? I'm sorry.

543
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,547
Have you met Lillian? She's my best friend.

544
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,506
Yeah, I know. We've only known
each other for five minutes.

545
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,841
Oh! Oh!

546
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,807
on! Cute.

547
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,318
No. No. Come on.

548
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,195
See? Okay? I'm not drunk. I told you.

549
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,450
So, you are just a terrible sober driver?

550
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,831
Ha ha. Very funny. Can I stop walking now?

551
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,830
You can stop walking when I tell you to stop walking.

552
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,331
Hey, look. If I was drunk,

553
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,083
would I be able to do this?

554
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,058
Stop it. Stop it. Please, stop.

555
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,893
Please, stop. I believe you. You are not drunk.

556
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,729
But I'm still gonna have to give you a ticket.

557
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,321
What? why?

558
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,491
It's a funny thing about brake lights.
You have to have them.

559
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,615
I knew it. God, those have been out for a year.

560
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,405
I'm so stupid.

561
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,740
Look, please.

562
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,117
Please, I promise I will get them fixed.

563
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:07,914
This week, I promise. Please. Do
you have to give me a ticket?

564
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,422
Yes. License and registration, please.

565
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,058
Thanks.

566
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,181
Look at that, you live on Wynnewood Drive.

567
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,641
Yep. We are neighbors.

568
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,227
I just live over on Ashley. Ahh.

569
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,567
I used to work on Ashley.

570
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,819
You did? Where?

571
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:39,745
I had a bakery on the main part of the street there.

572
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,827
Oh. Cake Baby.

573
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,660
You are Cake Baby! Yeah!

574
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,754
Yeah, you had your sign. It was your face.

575
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,669
Yeah! That was you?

576
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,795
That was me.

577
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,169
You made good cakes.

578
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:57,963
Thanks.

579
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,175
You used to make these little pastry things,

580
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:05,013
and you'd put something in them,
like a cream or a custard...

581
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,430
Cream puffs.

582
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,811
Cream puffs, that's what you call them. Delicious.

583
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,528
I used to get served by this tall, broad guy,

584
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,150
with, like, a wormy face.

585
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,945
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.

586
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,487
Sorry. No, no. It was...

587
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,870
He was my boyfriend, and then he left me

588
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,578
when the business went under. So, anyway...

589
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,207
You're kidding?

590
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,960
What a dick.

591
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,134
I'm glad I never tipped him.

592
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,632
You know what? Let's forget about this.

593
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,427
Let's just forget this one. Really?

594
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,137
Under one condition. What? What?

595
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,346
Get your taillights fixed...

596
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,307
I promise. I promise I will. I promise. Thank you.

597
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,516
...Before you kill someone.

598
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,775
I'm not going to kill anybody.

599
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,353
All right. Here, there's your ID.

600
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,946
And I'm going to give you this.

601
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,615
It's a buddy of mine. He has a body shop in Milwaukee.

602
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,408
He'll fix those right up for you.

603
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,866
Bill Cozbi?

604
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,408
Yeah, with a "Z."

605
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,657
Different guy. Yeah.

606
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,118
And don't mention the whole "Bill Cosby" thing to him.

607
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,624
It drives him nuts. I mean it.

608
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,047
Okay, I get it. Thanks.

609
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,966
You know what? If you mention
my name, that I referred you,

610
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,840
he'll give you a particularly good deal.

611
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,092
My gosh. Thank you.

612
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,390
I really appreciate it. Thanks.

613
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,093
Okay. Well, I appreciated your cakes.

614
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,974
So, we are even.

615
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,181
That's me, there. Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.

616
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,435
That's really nice of you.

617
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,320
Thank you.

618
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,898
We are not all bad.

619
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,232
What?

620
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,737
I was just saying, we are not all bad!

621
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,364
Oh. Yeah.

622
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,162
Actually, the rest of them are, but not me.

623
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm the best of them.

624
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,161
Okay. Thank you.

625
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,080
Anyway.

626
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,577
Thank you.

627
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,647
I didn't know you played tennis.

628
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,653
Yeah, I played a little in high school.

629
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,530
I'm so glad we were able to do this.

630
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,995
I'm really glad we could do this, too.
It's nice we get to hang out.

631
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,287
I know, right? Yeah.

632
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,286
It's too bad Lillian couldn't play with us today.

633
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,537
Poor thing, she is so busy.

634
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,875
Ohh. I know.

635
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,662
But she's not really that into sports.

636
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,292
Even when we were little, she didn't like anything

637
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,749
that was too competitive.

638
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,839
She certainly enjoys playing tennis now.

639
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,670
It's funny how people change, isn't it?

640
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,049
Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Do people really change?

641
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:11,721
I think they do.

642
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,062
Yeah, but, I mean, they still stay
who they are, pretty much.

643
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,731
I think we change all the time.

644
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:22,277
I think we stay the same, but grow, I guess, a little bit.

645
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,814
I think if you are growing, then you are changing.

646
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,241
But, I mean, we are changing from who
we are, which we always stay as.

647
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,863
Not really, I don't think so.

648
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,578
I think so. I don't.

649
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,323
Annie! These are my kids.

650
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,249
Step-kids. Step.

651
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,457
They are so hilarious.

652
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,670
Funny.

653
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,498
Excuse me, my husband's kids.

654
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,999
What are you guys up to?

655
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,251
Going to the snack bar.

656
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,257
Awesome. You need a ride home later?

657
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,971
Fuck off, Helen.

658
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,596
Okay. Put a quarter in the swear-jar.

659
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,390
Good to see you.

660
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,516
They are so cute.

661
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,729
Sweet kids.

662
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,971
Carol!

663
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,803
Get your shit together, Carol!

664
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,737
Yes!

665
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,701
I've seen better tennis playing
in a tampon commercial.

666
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,157
Umm...

667
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,535
I've been thinking, and...

668
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,413
Brynn needs to start paying rent. That's it.

669
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,793
She's been here long enough.

670
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,842
The three of us live here, it's not
fair for me to be paying half.

671
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,469
We split it three ways. What do you say?

672
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,047
Well, she can't work. She's on a tourist visa.

673
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,758
Yeah. So, technically, I'm only allowed to tour.

674
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,184
Well, you know...

675
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,598
I have no way of earning money,

676
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,306
unless I just go and prostitute down on the street.

677
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,141
I don't want you to do that, no.

678
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,983
"Hello, fellas. Here I am."

679
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,481
Yeah, but we... "Put your American sausage

680
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,062
"in my English McMuffin."

681
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,271
No, we did that. All right.

682
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,699
Okay, I don't even know what you're
talking about any more.

683
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,651
There's three people living here. Yeah.

684
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,657
If she doesn't start paying...

685
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,862
I'm not. ...she has to leave.

686
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,743
Is this about the diary again?

687
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,915
What diary?

688
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,876
Your diary proved very interesting to read.

689
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,996
You read my... You read my journal?

690
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,299
At first, I did not know that it was your diary.

691
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,423
I thought it was a very sad, hand-written book.

692
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,385
What? That does not make any...

693
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,174
But, because of the deep personal details

694
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,767
and the bits that mentioned Gil
and Brynn... No, no, no, no.

695
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,557
- Don't read my journal!
- And the crumbs.

696
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,888
Then... Don't go in my room!

697
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,101
Well, hello! I think, before you
make those sort of demands,

698
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,526
you need to, maybe, think about

699
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,986
putting a note on your door saying,

700
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,361
"Do not come into my room, read
my diary and wear my clothes."

701
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,415
Wow, I've never been to this part of town before.

702
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,913
Look, you can get your checks cashed next door.

703
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,465
I know it looks a little scary on the outside,

704
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,884
but the food is really good, authentic Brazilian.

705
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,421
I'm telling you, this is where Brazilians come to eat.

706
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,846
I got to say, Annie's really good at this.

707
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,594
She always drags me to the weirdest places

708
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,430
and the food is always incredible.

709
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,387
And plus, you get a lot for your
money, too. So that's good.

710
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,852
All right. Let's do it. Let's do it.

711
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,899
Whoa! Somebody likes Brazilian food.

712
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,480
To my bridesmaids.

713
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,362
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

714
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,534
Cheers to Lil!

715
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,615
This is such a stone-cold pack
of weirdos, and I'm so proud.

716
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,950
And I just want to toast all of you ladies.

717
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,626
I'm so happy to get to know you guys,

718
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,625
and happy to say that I have four new friends.

719
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,501
Absolutely. Cheers.

720
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,548
So, Annie, do you have a date for the wedding?

721
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,669
Um...

722
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,432
I don't... I don't think I'm bringing anybody, I guess.

723
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,802
Please, can I set you up? Please?

724
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,354
Annie, you can't go to the wedding alone. Please?

725
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,602
If you go alone, people might think you're a prostitute.

726
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,853
Maybe.

727
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,273
I'm sorry.

728
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:39,030
I hope that you're all hungry for churrasco
Brasil. What would you like?

729
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,656
Yeah, I'll have some of that, please.

730
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,827
I'll start with this.

731
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,406
I'd say yes. Hello, chicken.

732
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,287
This is crazy good, ya'll.

733
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,243
Helen, aren't you eating any meat?

734
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,751
It's not good to eat a big meal before a fitting.

735
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,174
I feel a bit bloated, so...

736
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,296
Not me.

737
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,594
No? No. Physically, I don't bloat.

738
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,846
Lucky. That is lucky.

739
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,927
It's a gift.

740
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,765
I can't wait to be married for as
long as you've been married.

741
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,016
And to have kids.

742
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,850
And be a mom. Becca?

743
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,027
Yeah?

744
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,275
The other night, I'm slaving away,

745
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,482
making a beautiful dinner for my family.

746
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,947
My youngest boy comes in and
says he wants to order a pizza.

747
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,866
I said, "No, we're not ordering pizza tonight."

748
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,448
He goes, "Mom, why don't you go and fuck yourself?"

749
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,291
He's nine.

750
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,461
Okay, now that Lillian's in the bathroom,

751
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,914
I just wanted to talk to you guys
about the shower really quick.

752
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:37,422
I was thinking it could be French-themed,

753
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,049
since she's always wanted to go to Paris her whole life.

754
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,049
So I figured we could bring Paris here

755
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,219
and have champagne and little cookies.

756
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,804
They'd say "Lillian and Dougie" on them.

757
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,475
We can dip them in chocolate fondue,

758
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,229
and get cheese from the nice part of the store.

759
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,102
I love that. Good idea, Annie.

760
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,186
We can have French invitations, the whole thing.

761
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,396
Don't you think that'd be nice?

762
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,481
That's adorable! That's really cute.

763
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,238
Good. Great.

764
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,990
I don't know. It's really cute.

765
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,070
But I feel like, personally, the Paris theme's

766
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,239
a bit, "Been there, done that."

767
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,703
I just feel like we can top it.

768
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,159
We should throw some ideas around.

769
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,461
See if anyone else has a theme they had in mind

770
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,083
or something they'd been thinking of.

771
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,415
What about a Pixar-themed shower?

772
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,422
And we all come dressed as
our favorite Pixar character.

773
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:24,886
That, and I'll just snowball on
top of that, also Fight Club.

774
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,596
Female fight club.

775
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,683
We grease up, we pull in.

776
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,437
Lillian doesn't know, so it's, "Surprise!
We're going to fight!"

777
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,192
We beat the shit out of her.

778
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,569
She's not going to forget that.

779
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,688
We just fucking attack.

780
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,945
Can I be honest? No.

781
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,198
I'm at home with three boys all day, every day.

782
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,620
What about the bachelorette party?

783
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,118
That's what's more important.

784
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,703
I've got a new tube top, I want to cut the tags off.

785
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,751
I'd like to take advantage of this opportunity.

786
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,041
Where are we going? I'm going to second her.

787
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,747
We'd better blow this shit out. Yeah.

788
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,504
That poor girl, Lillian, who we're all here for,

789
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,961
is in the bathroom probably bawling
her fucking eyes out.

790
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,129
Because she's realizing, "Holy shit!

791
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,965
"I've got to spend the rest of my life with Doug."

792
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,222
He's my brother. I love him.
But he is a fucking asshole.

793
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,019
I think we can all agree on that, right?

794
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,439
We can... We'll figure it out.

795
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,984
I mean, I can think of stuff, and it will be great.

796
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,312
We just have to make sure it's really, really special.

797
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,903
Belle en Blanc? This is the place. Great job, Annie.

798
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,659
Thanks. Annie.

799
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,121
Belle en Blanc. Reservation name?

800
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,080
I don't have one. We're just here to
shop, just to try on some dresses.

801
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,835
Okay. Well, the next available appointment

802
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,583
for bridesmaids' fittings is in seven weeks.

803
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,509
Absolutely no walk-ins.

804
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,424
Whitney? It's Helen.

805
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,179
Helen Harris? Yeah!

806
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,302
Hi! Hi.

807
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,258
Oh, my God. Hi. Listen, I'll buzz you right in.

808
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,184
Great, thanks. Okay.

809
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,022
Hello. Welcome, come in.

810
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,223
You look wonderful. Great to see you.

811
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,274
Welcome to Belle en Blanc, ladies.

812
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,102
- Welcome to heaven.
- Thank you.

813
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,528
Oh, man!

814
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,528
This is some classy shit here.

815
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,280
Jesus, Megan!

816
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,861
I'm sorry, I want to apologize.

817
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,244
I'm not even confident on which end that came out of.

818
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,370
Whitney, back to you. I'm sorry.

819
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,545
Anyway, take a look around. Get to know the dresses.

820
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,338
If you need anything, I'll be in my office.

821
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,922
Have fun.

822
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:24,842
Oh, my God.

823
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,715
It's a Fritz Bernaise.

824
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:27,962
Ladies, I... Oh, my God!

825
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,469
I just don't think we can do any better. This is...

826
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,471
This is beautiful. That is gorgeous.

827
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,302
It's unique, it's special, it's couture.

828
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,103
This is made in France.

829
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,972
Helen, this is $800.

830
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,899
Are you kidding? It's on sale.

831
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,064
Are you serious? Oh, my gosh.
What a perfect combination.

832
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,565
You guys, it was meant to be.

833
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,066
Oh. that's nice.

834
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,283
There's other dresses we should be looking at.

835
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,076
Nope, not that one.

836
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,705
Lillian, Lillian, look at this one.

837
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,328
Isn't this pretty? Yeah.

838
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,626
It's really pretty and sweet, and...

839
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,877
We don't want to upstage Lillian with a big fancy dress.

840
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,548
Maybe we should just get something kind of simple.

841
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,666
Oh.

842
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,217
Please do not worry about upstaging me.

843
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,299
Because guess who Helen is friends with

844
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,472
and who's designing my wedding dress.

845
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,350
Lady St. Petsois JuJu.

846
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,228
I just sent my measurements to France, y'all.

847
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,272
No, you didn't.

848
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,853
Where were you when I was getting married?

849
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,031
Ladies, let's not decide on this bridesmaids'
dress straight away.

850
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,449
Let's let our bodies decide.

851
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,118
Try some things on and have some fun, okay?

852
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,408
Yeah, let's have some fun, girls.

853
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,452
Ladies, start your "engines."

854
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,700
- Oh, yeah.
- Lil, Lil.

855
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,627
- Amazing.
- This is so cool.

856
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,053
Ladies. Ladies, if I may interject.

857
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,555
I just want to say you all look stunning.

858
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,390
That's a given. Head to toe.

859
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,473
But, sadly, we need to agree on one.

860
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,934
Well, I mean, ladies, you all look beautiful.

861
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,646
But I just think, personally, the Fritz Bernaise is just...

862
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,071
I mean... it's a Bernaise.

863
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,570
This is one of a kind. I just...

864
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,650
I don't think there is a question.

865
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,776
No. No question.

866
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,154
There might be a question.

867
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,080
I might... I might have a question.

868
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,954
I think this dress would look great on everybody.

869
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,126
It's a great color. It's a great length.

870
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,670
It's fun. You can twirl.

871
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,793
You can move in it.

872
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,591
You can spread your legs apart.

873
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,010
And it's a great price.

874
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,838
This is designer as well.

875
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,469
Is anyone else hot?

876
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,842
It is like an oven in here.

877
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,094
Okay, well, maybe this might help you decide.

878
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,930
While you gals were in the changing room,

879
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,393
I happened to rustle up a two-year-old
Lady JuJu dress in storage.

880
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,193
I had Lillian put it on so you could see

881
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,984
what you'll be standing next to.

882
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,530
Lillian, honey.

883
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,279
My God.

884
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,869
Beautiful length.

885
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,405
Breathtaking.

886
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:02,208
Holy shit! You look amazing.

887
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,793
That's a dress. That dress is so pretty

888
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:04,869
it makes my stomach hurt.

889
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,714
Lillian,

890
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,467
- I don't know what to say.
- You look...

891
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,633
Megan, are you okay?

892
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,888
I think...

893
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,179
My dress was probably just tight.

894
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,605
Oh, my God.

895
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,978
You got food poisoning from
that restaurant, didn't you?

896
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,566
No, I had the same thing that she had and I feel fine.

897
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,230
Oh, my... Okay. Oh, no.

898
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,940
Why is this happening? Nothing is happening.

899
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,408
Oh, my God.

900
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,824
I don't really care which dress we get.

901
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,997
It doesn't matter to me. I just need
to get off this white carpet.

902
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,494
Oh, God. Okay. No, not the bathroom.

903
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,326
Everybody go outside. I'm serious!

904
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,332
There is a bathroom across the street.

905
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,757
I think everybody has the flu.

906
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,510
Shit!

907
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,052
I need the toilet! I need the toilet!

908
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,806
I need the toilet!

909
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,387
No!

910
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,182
No. No, Megan. No! No!

911
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,939
Look away! Megan, no!

912
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,151
Look away!

913
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,781
You don't look very well, Annie.

914
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:20,991
I feel fine.

915
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,200
Are you sure? It wasn't that gray kind of lamb?

916
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,035
You ate a lot of that weird chicken.

917
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,998
Was it that?

918
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,373
No. I'm...

919
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,627
I... I feel fine.

920
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,590
I think you'd just feel better if you threw up.

921
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,639
I don't have... I don't have to throw up.

922
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,348
I am so sorry.

923
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,428
Get away from me!

924
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,392
You're not sick?

925
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,472
No. No?

926
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,651
In fact, Helen, I'm hungry.

927
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,899
And I wish I had a snack.

928
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,150
You're hungry?

929
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,615
I'm starving.

930
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,158
What did we eat?

931
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,408
The sink is a goner. What are you doing?

932
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,160
It's coming out of me like lava!

933
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,409
Oh, my God.

934
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,910
Don't you fucking look at me!

935
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,330
Hmm?

936
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,831
Jordan almonds.

937
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,249
These are great.

938
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,343
Thank you.

939
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,062
Better?

940
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,519
I was... I was just hungry.

941
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,892
Yeah.

942
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,563
Annie, everybody is really sick from that restaurant.

943
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,907
But it wasn't the restaurant. No, no, no, no.

944
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,404
Lillian, where are you going? No.

945
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,531
I need a bathroom.

946
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,574
Lil!

947
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,620
No. No.

948
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,788
Lil, where are you going?

949
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,538
Be careful. What are you doing?

950
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,038
It's happening. It's happening.

951
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,926
- It happened.
- What are you doing?

952
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,378
It happened.

953
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,094
No. Don't you dare ruin that dress!

954
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,596
Ohh. You're really doing it, aren't you?

955
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,310
You're really shitting in the street.

956
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,398
We'll just take five of the Fritz Bernaises.

957
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,108
Thank you, Whitney. They really do look better.

958
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,864
Right. Thank you.

959
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,331
You okay?

960
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,332
I crapped my wedding dress. I crapped...

961
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,133
I... I crapped my wedding dress.

962
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,261
Lunch was fun, though, right?

963
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,006
It was a good time, all the girls together.

964
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,012
Is this a sign, Annie?

965
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,433
No. I'm just going to pull over

966
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,307
really quick, though, because...

967
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:51,387
What?

968
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,596
...My tire just feels a little...

969
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,772
Where are you going?

970
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:54,940
My tire just feels a little low.

971
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,938
I just want to check my tire real quick.

972
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,718
Oh. Could I borrow your razor, please?

973
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,178
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

974
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,603
Have a good date. Thank you.

975
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:37,021
Is the guy that you're going out with also over 40?

976
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,064
I'm not over 40. Forget it.

977
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,820
Lift up your arm. Point up.

978
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,366
Ow! Sorry.

979
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,453
Hi. Annie.

980
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,247
Pete? Yeah.

981
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,372
Come on in.

982
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,457
All right. Thank you.

983
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,846
Oh. This is my son, Tyler.

984
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,006
Hi, Tyler. Hi.

985
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,847
These things are always so awkward. Yeah.

986
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,803
I'm not really a setup guy. Me, either.

987
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,433
But Becca spoke so highly of you.

988
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,270
She had a lot of really nice things
to say about you, too.

989
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,441
That's nice to hear.

990
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,228
I'm going to go upstairs, throw on
a couple of finishing touches.

991
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:26,156
The babysitter's not here yet,
so just hang out with Tyler

992
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,490
and I'll be right back down. Okay.

993
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,567
Okay.

994
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,501
So, how old are you?

995
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,386
Do you watch movies?

996
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,811
Are you afraid of dying?

997
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,887
Hmm?

998
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,224
Are you afraid of dying?

999
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:00,975
Um...

1000
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,145
I don't know.

1001
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,987
I mean, I guess everybody is. I don't know. Why?

1002
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,119
Because my mom is going to kill you.

1003
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,833
You're making me uncomfortable.

1004
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,594
Your hair looks burned.

1005
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,801
Okay.

1006
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,644
Are you going to make a baby with my father?

1007
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,602
I don't... I don't know.

1008
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,901
My grandma died where you're sitting.

1009
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,657
She died right here?

1010
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,328
Right where your underpants are.

1011
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,667
You wanna watch me dance?

1012
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,206
Sure.

1013
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,396
I can't do this.

1014
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,903
Listen to me. I miss you so much.

1015
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,155
I'll come over right now.

1016
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,362
Okay, I'm not over you yet, that's why.

1017
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,072
She's not even pretty.

1018
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,450
I'm not doing it. I can't. No.

1019
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,673
What are you doing? Did you eat one of those?

1020
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,846
Did you eat one of those?

1021
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,639
I ate Saturday.

1022
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,096
Okay. Oh, boy. You know what?

1023
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,803
Something's going to happen to
you. I don't know what it is,

1024
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,765
but something's going to happen to your body.

1025
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,153
That was fun. Oh, my gosh.

1026
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:15,572
You know what I was thinking?

1027
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,404
You should come with me to Lillian's wedding, maybe.

1028
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,830
Not like that. Not like anything serious.

1029
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,749
But just like a fun time, you know?

1030
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:27,422
We can get dressed up, and we can
go dancing and have a drink.

1031
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:28,793
It'll be fun, right?

1032
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,175
No. I mean, I don't want to make you have to explain

1033
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:35,050
to all those people what our relationship is.

1034
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,966
That would suck for you. Right?

1035
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,268
Yeah. I guess so.

1036
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,262
I'm just thinking of you. Yeah.

1037
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,939
No, it's okay.

1038
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,314
I have someone else I can ask, anyway. So...

1039
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,358
Really? Yeah.

1040
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,655
Who?

1041
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,024
Umm... This guy, George.

1042
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,281
George Glass.

1043
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,747
Okay.

1044
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,827
Who is this George?

1045
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:11,461
He is a very hot, nice guy

1046
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,044
who likes me a lot, and would
probably love to be my date.

1047
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,128
Really? Mmm-hmm.

1048
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,212
Mmm-hmm.

1049
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,144
Well, let me ask you this.

1050
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,099
Can this George Glass

1051
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,061
do this to you?

1052
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,248
Probably.

1053
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,831
You know what? It's getting really late.

1054
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,380
You should probably go. I'm
going to miss you so much.

1055
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,434
Oh.

1056
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:16,605
Annie Walker.

1057
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:17,773
Hi.

1058
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,108
Hey. Hey.

1059
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,611
What brings you in here so early?

1060
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,788
I've just had a bad night. Boy stuff. Ohh.

1061
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,541
Do you want me to arrest anybody?

1062
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,617
I could do that.

1063
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,743
Actually... No.

1064
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,206
Do you want to talk to a cop about
it? We are just like priests.

1065
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,001
Except we can tell everybody about it after wards.

1066
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,131
Oh. I won't, though.

1067
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:39,844
Doesn't sound very inviting.

1068
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,635
You want a carrot?

1069
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,888
Right now? Yeah.

1070
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,641
I'll share. I've got plenty.

1071
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,764
Sure, I'll have a carrot.

1072
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,981
Yeah?

1073
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,309
Okay.

1074
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,944
Ohh. Yeah, that sounds rough.

1075
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,363
It's going to get better, right?

1076
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,439
I wouldn't have thought so.

1077
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,572
You know, my sister was a maid of
honor at our cousin's wedding,

1078
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:06,246
and she found it so stressful,
her hair started falling out.

1079
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,240
That's terrible. Yeah.

1080
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,451
It grew back, but it was...

1081
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,453
It was pretty gross.

1082
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,338
Planning a wedding should be fun.

1083
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,087
You know what? If I ever had a wedding,

1084
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,881
I'd want everybody to be stress-free.

1085
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,678
I'd like it to be like a carnival.

1086
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:26,225
Like, people win prizes for guessing the bride's weight.

1087
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,643
Dunk tanks.

1088
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,844
Yeah. You know?

1089
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,603
Mmm-hmm. You could have elephants,

1090
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,023
and the bride and groom can walk on a little tightrope.

1091
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,942
Okay, what you are talking about
there, that's a circus wedding.

1092
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,645
It's a totally different... Right.

1093
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,150
You missed it. Yeah.

1094
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,117
Hey, you know, instead of stressing
out about this wedding,

1095
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,785
you know what you should be doing?

1096
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,829
Setting up a new bakery!

1097
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,656
Hmm.

1098
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,285
No, I'm kind of done with that.

1099
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:53,957
What?

1100
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,497
I don't do it any more.

1101
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,173
All right.

1102
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,169
Ew. Oh!

1103
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,762
You got the ugly carrot. What?

1104
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,465
There is one in every bag. You
have to eat it. It's good luck.

1105
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,674
I'm not eating this.

1106
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,891
Yeah! I'll eat it.

1107
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,395
It's the lucky carrot? No, don't eat
it! Don't eat it. Don't eat it!

1108
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:16,563
Well, don't litter! I'll fine you. I'm sorry.

1109
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,606
You know what? Actually, I'm going to pick it up.

1110
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,982
It really bothers me. Sorry.

1111
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:24,238
I'm sorry. It's just that I'm anal
about that kind of thing.

1112
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:32,750
I didn't know that you could be a
cop here if you weren't a citizen.

1113
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:34,751
You can't. No?

1114
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,669
No. No, you can't.

1115
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,668
But they made a special dispensation

1116
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,712
because I'm so tough and strong.

1117
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,259
Oh. Right. And handsome.

1118
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,631
Okay.

1119
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,257
You're pretty... You're pretty tough.

1120
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,344
I am tough. You're tough. You're a tough cop.

1121
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,595
Look. You're saying it, but you're laughing.

1122
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,842
No, you're... You're...

1123
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,143
You didn't let me flex that time.

1124
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,477
That was unfair. I'm really tough.

1125
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,522
So am I. No.

1126
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,850
Yeah. I could be a cop.

1127
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,024
You think you could be a cop? Yeah.

1128
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,104
Okay. Yeah.

1129
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,030
Let's see. You know what?

1130
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:07,201
The sun is nearly up. Let's go and
see if you've got what it takes.

1131
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,153
That's right. Now, plant your feet.

1132
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,279
Okay.

1133
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,410
Good.

1134
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,533
And take aim.

1135
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,463
Now, put your left hand behind your head.

1136
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,340
Yeah. And just drop your left hip.

1137
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,005
I'm kidding. Put your arms out straight. Okay.

1138
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,340
You want to hit the middle of the license plate.

1139
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,892
That's where you get the most accurate reading.

1140
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,061
Okay. Okay, here we go. You ready?

1141
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,183
Okay.

1142
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,684
Fifty-eight. What's the speed limit?

1143
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,983
Fifty-five.

1144
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,733
Okay, they were all right. We'll let them go.

1145
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,440
You were born to do this. Look at you.

1146
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,734
Okay. All right, here we go.

1147
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,321
Sixty-three.

1148
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,164
You are missing some good ones here.

1149
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,539
People are on their way to work. Why ruin their day?

1150
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,703
Okay, watch this. 48.

1151
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,497
Forty-eight. How did you do that?

1152
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:03,753
It wasn't! Yes, it was.

1153
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,254
That's never happened. Are you serious?

1154
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,755
It was 48? Yes, 48!

1155
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,508
Yeah. I'm so impressed.

1156
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:09,759
I'm pretty impressive.

1157
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,806
I'm very impressed by you.

1158
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,675
Whoa!

1159
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:14,926
Whoa!

1160
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,603
Whoa! Damn!

1161
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,559
That was 91. 91?

1162
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,639
Yes. Can we go?

1163
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:20,724
We can go.

1164
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,980
Come on, hot dogger.

1165
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,525
Let's get that fucker.

1166
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:27,860
ANNIE; on, my God!

1167
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,317
Oh, my God!

1168
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,838
...Family lake house. Perfect.

1169
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,679
Hello? I just got your e-mail. Lake house?

1170
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,143
Yeah.

1171
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,563
Yeah, it's Lillian's parents' house.

1172
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,187
We used to go there all the time
in the summers and everything.

1173
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,810
It's one oi.. A bachelorette in a cabin?

1174
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,316
Wait. Can you..4 Hold that thought. Hold on.

1175
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,442
Hello?

1176
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,857
Fucking Helen. Hello?

1177
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,818
Annie, it's Rita.

1178
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,152
Hi.

1179
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,490
Listen, I need a trip that I can fantasize forever

1180
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,540
so that I am able to have sex with my husband.

1181
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,752
That's why I'm thinking Vegas.

1182
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,624
Vegas?

1183
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,704
Hang on. Hey!

1184
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,382
Shut your filth y fucking mouths! I'm sorry.

1185
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,879
I'm surrounded by savages.

1186
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,920
You know what? I should probably
run. My other line is ringing.

1187
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,256
You know, I can get cocaine from my hairdresser.

1188
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,850
Okay, bye. Hello?

1189
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,222
Annie. Yeah?

1190
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,438
I'm so excited. Helen just called.
She said we can go to Vegas.

1191
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,524
You know... Yeah, but we have to...
We have to fly there, and...

1192
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,773
Okay, Annie, I know you are afraid of flying,

1193
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,857
but I want to see Criss Angel, but I'm scared.

1194
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,983
Which I sort of love.

1195
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,693
Can you just hold on for one second?

1196
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,995
Oh, sure, sure, sure. I... Thanks.
Hold on. God damn it.

1197
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,122
Hello? Hey, Annie, it's Megan.

1198
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,198
Hey.

1199
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,660
I just had some thoughts about the bachelorette party.

1200
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,377
Okay, here we go.

1201
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,996
Easy-peasy. Vegas it is.

1202
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,211
Helen called you, didn't she?

1203
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,958
Yeah, she got the jump on you.

1204
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,424
I want balls in my face.

1205
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:14,839
Honestly, I think it's Vegas.

1206
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,886
I love puppets. Balls.

1207
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,307
I guess we are undecided.

1208
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,336
I feel so bad Annie's stuck back in coach.

1209
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,841
I know, I offered to pay for her

1210
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,377
so she could sit in first class,

1211
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,633
but she said no.

1212
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,838
She's too proud.

1213
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,515
It was nice of you to offer.

1214
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,393
No carry-on, huh?

1215
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,972
No. Yeah, I noticed.

1216
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,433
I noticed you didn't put anything
in the overhead bin either.

1217
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,516
And I get it.

1218
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,195
I get it. I want you to know, protect and serve

1219
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:13,822
Air Marshal-style.

1220
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,482
What?

1221
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,567
I don't want to infringe on your privacy, man.

1222
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:20,029
I just... I really appreciate what
you do for this country.

1223
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,447
And I respect the hell out of you.

1224
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,624
That's great.

1225
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,416
I'm not an Air Marshal. I'm going to take a nap.

1226
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,587
Awesome. Cool.

1227
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,082
I'll take the first watch.

1228
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,885
I'm not an Air Marshal. You don't need to take a watch.

1229
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,178
Okay.

1230
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,257
I've got the first watch.

1231
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,804
Please check your seat belts

1232
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,056
and that your seat backs are in an
upright position before takeoff

1233
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,182
Gosh.

1234
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,686
I am really hoping this flight is quick,

1235
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,809
and we get there on the ground safely.

1236
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:51,984
I'm not a good flyer, I'm sorry.

1237
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,231
I had a dream last night that we went down.

1238
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,112
Yep. It was terrible. You were in it.

1239
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,702
What? It sounds like something's happening.

1240
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,622
Annie, what are you doing up here?

1241
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,123
You are supposed to be in your seat.

1242
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,549
I know. I'm freaking out a little bit.

1243
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,468
Ma'am, we're still ascending. You're
gonna need to return to your seat.

1244
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,879
Okay, I was just...

1245
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,966
Annie, I have something.

1246
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,718
Take two, you'll fall asleep, wake
up and we'll be there. Here.

1247
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,767
Ma'am, you're going to have to
return to your seat, please.

1248
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,440
It's fine. Okay. All right.

1249
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,517
- Ma'am!
- All right. All right.

1250
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,981
Oh, my God, I feel terrible, I should
be sitting back there with her.

1251
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,987
I shouldn't be up here in first
class. I feel like such a jerk.

1252
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,989
Lil, this is your weekend, okay?

1253
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,078
You are treating yourself. Just relax.

1254
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,826
She will be fine. She will make friends.

1255
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,033
There is much more sense of community
in coach, I promise you.

1256
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,208
She'll be fine.

1257
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,298
I can't believe you've never been with anybody else.

1258
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,379
Just Kevin.

1259
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,388
I'm sorry. I just...

1260
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,053
Becca, I just can't help but feel bad for you.

1261
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,811
You don't even know what you want.

1262
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,812
I got to know where you keep the gun, man.

1263
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,433
I mean, is it ankle, hip, lower back?

1264
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,268
You don't... Between the cheeks, do you?

1265
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:20,358
No, I don't stick a gun up my butt. That's stupid.

1266
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,566
I didn't say "up."

1267
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,411
I just knew of a guy, that guy
did a lot of undercover work.

1268
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:29,578
And all I know is he had tape marks
all up and down his cheeks.

1269
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,580
That can't be true.

1270
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,954
People don't keep guns up their asses

1271
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,506
because if you needed to use it,
how are you going to get it?

1272
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,086
He cut a hole in his pocket.

1273
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,092
What? In his back pocket.

1274
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,799
You have got to get something out of your ass

1275
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,926
and you cut a hole in the back of your jeans,

1276
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,882
you want to tell me you can't get to something?

1277
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,598
I don't have a gun for you to put
up my ass to make your point.

1278
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,805
I can put my Nano. I will show you.

1279
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,310
I will... If you get me scissors,

1280
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,853
I will cut a hole in my pocket.

1281
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:59,230
And you will never find this again
until I want you to find it.

1282
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,951
Kevin can only have sex in bed,
in the dark, under the covers,

1283
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,369
only after we have showered

1284
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,367
separately.

1285
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,541
And sometimes, by the time we are finished

1286
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,752
cleaning ourselves, he's too tired.

1287
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:19,383
And then I pretend I'm tired, but I'm
not tired. I'm not tired. I'm not tired.

1288
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,545
That's why every girl needs those slutty college years.

1289
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,340
To experiment, get it out of your
system, find out what you like.

1290
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,393
Excuse me, could I have a glass of
alcohol when you get a chance?

1291
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,181
Two double Seven and Sevens.

1292
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,558
Is that...

1293
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,897
You will like it. It's sweet.

1294
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,562
I have to go to the bathroom.

1295
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,698
But I heard about a woman who went
to the bathroom on a plane.

1296
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,905
She got sucked into the toilet.

1297
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,528
Sucked right in.

1298
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:52,782
Are you okay?

1299
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,079
Yes.

1300
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,746
Yeah, I just think that what you gave
me didn't really do anything.

1301
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:01,416
I just have too much adrenalin
or something. But, thanks.

1302
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,841
Why don't you take my scotch?

1303
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,927
It will just give the pill a little kick that it needs.

1304
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,762
Honestly, I do it all the time. Yeah?

1305
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,393
Yeah, and I'm much smaller
than you, so you'll handle it.

1306
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:14,596
Well, thanks.

1307
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,230
Yeah? Okay.

1308
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:30,828
Yummy?

1309
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,117
Yeah, it's good.

1310
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,408
You should just toss it back.
Don't waste any more time.

1311
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,621
Okay.

1312
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:41,627
Ohh. LOOK at that.

1313
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,091
Okay, that'll do it. That'll do it.

1314
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,263
So you don't even have sex any more?

1315
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,766
No, I have sex constantly.

1316
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,393
The sex is constant.

1317
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,225
But he hasn't kissed me in five years.

1318
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,809
What are you doing when you are having sex, then?

1319
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,817
Thinking about other things and wishing it would stop.

1320
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,570
You know, sometimes I just want to watch

1321
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,655
The Daily Show without him entering me.

1322
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:10,072
It's the Wet Republic Ultra Pool. No.

1323
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,407
Are you kidding?

1324
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,745
What is it again?

1325
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,493
There is a bar in the pool and a tiger.

1326
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,287
What?

1327
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,292
- it's crazy.
- It's Vegas at its best.

1328
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:22,001
Wait a minute. Is this that place
that was on The Real World?

1329
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,791
Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. It's...

1330
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,427
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

1331
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:31,510
I'm good. I'm so much more
relaxed. Thank you, Helen.

1332
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:36,179
I just feel like I'm excited, and I feel relaxed.

1333
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,472
And I'm ready

1334
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:42,268
to party

1335
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,687
with the best of them!

1336
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:50,279
And i'm going to go down to the river

1337
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:55,197
Wow! It looks like somebody is really relaxing now.

1338
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,534
What are you guys talking about up here?

1339
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,374
We are going to a restaurant tonight.
I know the owner, so...

1340
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,038
You do?

1341
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,000
Ohh. Helen knows the owner.

1342
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,043
Uhh!

1343
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,384
Big whoop.

1344
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,549
Let's go take a nap. What do you say?

1345
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,718
Miss, you cannot be up here.

1346
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,228
Hello, grandpa.

1347
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,103
I'm sorry. I just want to be here with

1348
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,066
my friends, because I'm with this group.

1349
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:27,069
The sign just went off. Can't she stay
up here for a minute and just talk?

1350
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,229
Absolutely not.

1351
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:30,364
Coach passengers are not allowed
up here in first class.

1352
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,866
It's policy. I'm sorry.

1353
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,067
Ooh!

1354
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:37,535
This is a very strict plane that I'm on.

1355
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,370
Welcome to Germany.

1356
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:44,583
Auf Wiedersehen, asshole.

1357
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:45,747
All right.

1358
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:46,914
Why don't you go lay down?

1359
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,425
I'm going to go take a nap. I'm tired.

1360
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,589
I think it's a good idea.

1361
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:53,926
Catch you on the flip side, motherfuckers.

1362
01:08:55,288 --> 01:08:56,255
I'm sorry.

1363
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,422
I'm leaving.

1364
01:08:57,498 --> 01:08:58,545
Thank you.

1365
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:02,295
This should be open, because it's civil rights.

1366
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:03,758
This is the '90s.

1367
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:06,925
Right. It's not. You're in the wrong decade.

1368
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:08,809
You are. Okay, I am.

1369
01:09:08,968 --> 01:09:10,015
Thank you.

1370
01:09:10,344 --> 01:09:12,813
Holy shit. What did you give her?

1371
01:09:31,365 --> 01:09:32,412
Miss?

1372
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,288
No. it's not me.

1373
01:09:36,454 --> 01:09:38,832
Yes, it is you. Please go back to your seat.

1374
01:09:38,998 --> 01:09:41,046
Yes, I am with him.

1375
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:43,552
I am Mrs. Iglesias.

1376
01:09:43,711 --> 01:09:44,712
No, you are not.

1377
01:09:44,837 --> 01:09:47,636
You were just out here and you
put sunglasses on. Out.

1378
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:49,050
But I don't want to.

1379
01:09:49,175 --> 01:09:51,553
Sir, she can have my seat, okay?

1380
01:09:51,636 --> 01:09:53,809
Everyone should experience first
class at least once in their lives.

1381
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:56,186
And Annie shouldn't miss out just
because she can't afford it.

1382
01:09:56,349 --> 01:09:57,896
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's not allowed.

1383
01:09:58,059 --> 01:10:00,027
- Help me, I'm poor.
- No, listen,

1384
01:10:00,186 --> 01:10:02,905
we're a whole wedding party. I'm
the bride. I'm getting married.

1385
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:05,908
This seat is empty. She's obviously nervous.
We'll calm her down and...

1386
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:07,740
I understand. But Claire is right.

1387
01:10:07,902 --> 01:10:09,245
Everybody, go back to your seats.

1388
01:10:09,403 --> 01:10:10,905
Okay, you especially.

1389
01:10:11,072 --> 01:10:13,040
You have three seconds to get back to your seat.

1390
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:16,335
You can't get anywhere in three seconds.

1391
01:10:16,494 --> 01:10:17,586
Well, you'd better try.

1392
01:10:17,745 --> 01:10:19,122
You are setting me up for a loss already.

1393
01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:20,252
Thank you.

1394
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:23,918
Whatever YOU Say, Stove.

1395
01:10:24,085 --> 01:10:25,428
It's Steve.

1396
01:10:26,754 --> 01:10:28,552
"Stove." What kind of name is that?

1397
01:10:28,714 --> 01:10:30,557
That's not a name. My name is Steve.

1398
01:10:30,716 --> 01:10:31,933
Are you an appliance?

1399
01:10:32,093 --> 01:10:33,936
No, I'm a man, and my name is Steve.

1400
01:10:34,095 --> 01:10:35,438
You are a flight attendant.

1401
01:10:35,596 --> 01:10:38,270
That's absolutely accurate.

1402
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:42,445
You can close that. Thank you.

1403
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:48,614
Hey, not-Air Marshall Jon.

1404
01:10:48,776 --> 01:10:51,404
You want to get back in that restroom and not rest?

1405
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,447
No, I have to get back to my seat.

1406
01:10:53,614 --> 01:10:56,242
Yeah, you gotta get back on my seat.

1407
01:10:58,285 --> 01:10:59,286
You get it?

1408
01:10:59,453 --> 01:11:00,955
Yeah, I definitely got it.

1409
01:11:01,122 --> 01:11:02,624
Oh-Oh. what's That?

1410
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:07,629
I got to get back to my seat. Could
you just move your leg, please?

1411
01:11:07,795 --> 01:11:09,297
I got to go.

1412
01:11:09,588 --> 01:11:11,556
Oh-oh. Oh-oh.

1413
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:13,805
Somebody found a souvenir.

1414
01:11:14,301 --> 01:11:17,976
You feel that steam heat coming?
That's from my undercarriage

1415
01:11:18,305 --> 01:11:20,524
That can go up and higher.

1416
01:11:20,683 --> 01:11:22,105
Okay.

1417
01:11:23,853 --> 01:11:25,651
Jon, get us a blanket.

1418
01:11:25,813 --> 01:11:27,156
No.

1419
01:11:27,314 --> 01:11:29,988
I got to take a whiz and I'll be right back.

1420
01:11:30,985 --> 01:11:32,032
Cool.

1421
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:38,042
I don't want you to be a big fuck-up like me.

1422
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,543
How do you think I feel?

1423
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:42,330
Like me. You can still turn it around.

1424
01:11:42,496 --> 01:11:43,873
No, don't.

1425
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:46,338
Stop it!

1426
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,219
You are more beautiful than Cinderella.

1427
01:11:49,378 --> 01:11:53,679
You smell like pine needles and
you have a face like sunshine.

1428
01:12:07,188 --> 01:12:08,360
What?

1429
01:12:11,484 --> 01:12:12,656
Oh, no.

1430
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:15,238
Ladies and gentlemen,

1431
01:12:15,404 --> 01:12:18,578
as you can see, the captain has turned
on the ”fasten seat belt” sign.

1432
01:12:18,741 --> 01:12:20,835
It appears we've run into a rough patch of weather...

1433
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:22,162
I have an announcement, too.

1434
01:12:22,244 --> 01:12:24,212
There is a Colonial woman on the wing.

1435
01:12:24,288 --> 01:12:25,665
There's a woman on the wing. I saw her.

1436
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,167
There 's something they're not telling us!

1437
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:28,296
Steve. All right.

1438
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:29,501
There's a Colonial woman.

1439
01:12:29,585 --> 01:12:31,303
She was churning butter on that wing. Steve, get her.

1440
01:12:31,378 --> 01:12:32,880
She is out there right now. Shit!

1441
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:35,345
Everyone, remain calm! I'm an Air Marshal.

1442
01:12:36,217 --> 01:12:38,891
Yes! I knew it. I got your back, Jon!

1443
01:12:38,969 --> 01:12:40,391
There is a woman on the wing. I saw her.

1444
01:12:40,554 --> 01:12:41,976
There's something they're not telling us.

1445
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:44,024
Let's get out! Let's open the doors and get out!

1446
01:12:44,183 --> 01:12:46,777
She is dressed in traditional Colonial garb.

1447
01:12:47,228 --> 01:12:49,071
Say goodbye! We are going down!

1448
01:12:49,146 --> 01:12:50,193
Stay calm.

1449
01:12:50,272 --> 01:12:51,569
There is something they are not telling us.

1450
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:53,322
There is a Colonial woman on the wing.

1451
01:12:53,901 --> 01:12:54,948
I will cover the pilot!

1452
01:12:59,573 --> 01:13:01,667
Who is she? What does she want?

1453
01:13:32,898 --> 01:13:35,026
Just let me make it up to you, please.

1454
01:13:35,985 --> 01:13:37,908
I'm telling you,

1455
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:40,744
your shower is going to be amazing.

1456
01:13:40,906 --> 01:13:42,829
I have so many ideas.

1457
01:13:42,992 --> 01:13:44,665
I want to talk to you about the shower.

1458
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:47,205
I feel like

1459
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:51,376
it has been really overwhelming for you.

1460
01:13:52,168 --> 01:13:53,841
It's just starting to make you crazy.

1461
01:13:54,003 --> 01:13:56,506
No, Lil, I'm fine. I mean...

1462
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,467
Lil, I'm fine.

1463
01:13:59,592 --> 01:14:01,185
No, you're not fine.

1464
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,266
You are not fine, Annie,

1465
01:14:03,429 --> 01:14:06,478
and we need things to just

1466
01:14:08,017 --> 01:14:09,644
flow smoothly from now on

1467
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,314
and Helen just knows how to do this kind of stuff.

1468
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,323
She does it all the time.

1469
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:17,405
She is good at it. She likes doing it.

1470
01:14:17,985 --> 01:14:20,488
This way you don't have to

1471
01:14:21,238 --> 01:14:24,993
plan any more lunches or trips.

1472
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:27,002
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.

1473
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:28,504
I get it.

1474
01:14:28,662 --> 01:14:31,006
I think it'll be best here on out

1475
01:14:31,165 --> 01:14:34,009
for the shower and for everything.

1476
01:14:34,501 --> 01:14:36,845
Yeah, whatever you want.

1477
01:14:37,004 --> 01:14:39,678
I mean, it's probably best.

1478
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,888
I think so, right?

1479
01:14:42,051 --> 01:14:43,394
Yeah. I just want you to be happy.

1480
01:14:43,552 --> 01:14:45,680
I think that will make me happy. It will be good.

1481
01:14:45,846 --> 01:14:47,894
Okay. Okay.

1482
01:14:48,849 --> 01:14:50,021
Good.

1483
01:15:14,124 --> 01:15:15,125
Hey.

1484
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:16,543
Hey.

1485
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:19,213
Do you want to hang out?

1486
01:15:27,054 --> 01:15:28,476
- It's not funny!
- Stop laughing.

1487
01:15:28,597 --> 01:15:30,065
it's a little funny.

1488
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:33,023
None of those girls are laughing, believe me.

1489
01:15:33,185 --> 01:15:35,404
It's not funny. Have you ever been kicked off a plane?

1490
01:15:35,562 --> 01:15:36,563
I can't say that I have.

1491
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:37,690
Thank you.

1492
01:15:37,856 --> 01:15:41,577
All of the girls hate me right now.

1493
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:43,908
You are like the maid of dishonor.

1494
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:49,081
I hope Lillian isn't going to be mad at me for too long.

1495
01:15:49,243 --> 01:15:50,961
No, she will be all right.

1496
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,542
I don't know, I just wish things were

1497
01:15:52,663 --> 01:15:54,085
the way that they used to be, you know.

1498
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:56,091
I feel like her life is going off

1499
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,595
and getting perfect, and mine is just like...

1500
01:16:01,422 --> 01:16:02,765
It will turn around, you know.

1501
01:16:02,923 --> 01:16:04,766
I have been hearing that for a long time.

1502
01:16:04,925 --> 01:16:06,472
It's going to turn around. I just know it.

1503
01:16:06,635 --> 01:16:08,262
Anyway.

1504
01:16:09,263 --> 01:16:10,435
You got to bake.

1505
01:16:10,597 --> 01:16:12,315
I don't really do that any more, I told you.

1506
01:16:12,474 --> 01:16:13,646
Why?

1507
01:16:13,767 --> 01:16:14,984
I don't know, it's just...

1508
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:19,774
I don't know, after it just went under, I just, kind of,

1509
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,822
stopped, I guess.

1510
01:16:22,985 --> 01:16:24,987
It doesn't make me happy any more.

1511
01:16:25,154 --> 01:16:26,872
Just because you didn't make any money at it,

1512
01:16:26,947 --> 01:16:27,994
doesn't mean that you failed at it.

1513
01:16:28,824 --> 01:16:30,622
I lost a lot of money.

1514
01:16:30,784 --> 01:16:32,752
All my money.

1515
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:34,455
But you are so good at it.

1516
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:36,123
Oh, well. Let's change the subject.

1517
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,463
No more baking. I'm done.

1518
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:40,798
I don't know how you just can't do it any more.

1519
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:44,261
If I wasn't a cop any more, I would still...

1520
01:16:44,423 --> 01:16:45,424
Arrest people?

1521
01:16:45,591 --> 01:16:47,593
...Go out with a gun and shoot people.

1522
01:16:48,385 --> 01:16:50,888
I probably wouldn't do that. I'm just
trying to make you feel better.

1523
01:16:53,057 --> 01:16:54,730
You are okay, you know.

1524
01:16:55,934 --> 01:16:56,935
You don't know me very well.

1525
01:16:57,102 --> 01:16:59,321
I know you well enough to know
that you're not so bad.

1526
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,153
You got some stuff. Oh, yeah.

1527
01:17:01,315 --> 01:17:03,067
You got bits and pieces going on.

1528
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,197
Thanks.

1529
01:17:04,276 --> 01:17:06,244
I have been thinking about you a little bit.

1530
01:17:06,403 --> 01:17:08,121
About me? Really?

1531
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,748
There is something about you.

1532
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:12,455
Something about you that sticks.

1533
01:17:18,082 --> 01:17:19,925
- I hate buttons.

1534
01:17:21,251 --> 01:17:22,673
Where is the bedroom?

1535
01:17:27,424 --> 01:17:30,143
Sorry. It's a mountain bike. Are you okay?

1536
01:17:30,302 --> 01:17:31,679
Do you like mountain biking? Uh-huh.

1537
01:17:36,308 --> 01:17:37,480
Take this off.

1538
01:17:37,643 --> 01:17:39,020
I'm so glad this is happening.

1539
01:17:39,186 --> 01:17:40,438
So am I.

1540
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:57,042
Hello. Morning.

1541
01:17:57,204 --> 01:17:58,751
Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out.

1542
01:17:58,914 --> 01:18:00,166
No, it's okay.

1543
01:18:00,332 --> 01:18:02,426
I haven't been sitting here that long. Oh.

1544
01:18:06,797 --> 01:18:08,265
Sorry, I guess I fell asleep.

1545
01:18:08,465 --> 01:18:11,435
I didn't mean to sleep over.

1546
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:13,387
Don't be silly.

1547
01:18:14,513 --> 01:18:16,015
I made you a cappuccino.

1548
01:18:16,181 --> 01:18:18,525
Made it? Yeah.

1549
01:18:19,518 --> 01:18:21,395
So, last night was fun.

1550
01:18:22,438 --> 01:18:25,191
It was. It was very fun.

1551
01:18:26,733 --> 01:18:27,734
I had fun.

1552
01:18:27,901 --> 01:18:29,528
It was fun.

1553
01:18:30,863 --> 01:18:33,582
If you care to accompany me to the kitchen,

1554
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,492
the fun may continue.

1555
01:18:35,659 --> 01:18:37,753
A different kind of fun.

1556
01:18:37,911 --> 01:18:41,506
But why don't you just get dressed
and whatever, and...

1557
01:18:41,665 --> 01:18:43,008
I left your clothes over there.

1558
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,468
Okay.

1559
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:45,923
And I'll see you in there.

1560
01:18:46,086 --> 01:18:47,429
Okay.

1561
01:18:51,925 --> 01:18:53,643
There she is.

1562
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:56,309
Your workshop awaits.

1563
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:58,390
I know it's a bit crazy, but I popped out

1564
01:18:58,474 --> 01:19:01,318
and I got a few little baking bits and pieces.

1565
01:19:01,477 --> 01:19:02,603
Butter, milk.

1566
01:19:02,769 --> 01:19:05,318
Because I thought that it would be
fun for us to bake together today.

1567
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:07,324
Obviously, you will be doing the baking.

1568
01:19:07,483 --> 01:19:09,110
I will be doing the eating.

1569
01:19:09,276 --> 01:19:11,449
Because you are the expert.

1570
01:19:11,862 --> 01:19:13,455
Yeah, I don't...

1571
01:19:13,614 --> 01:19:15,491
I don't really wanna...

1572
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:18,206
Sorry. You went to all this trouble, but...

1573
01:19:18,368 --> 01:19:20,837
Come on, I know you haven't done
it in a while, but it'll be great.

1574
01:19:20,996 --> 01:19:24,125
Don't be silly, just get into it. You are so good at it.

1575
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:27,670
All right. I get it.

1576
01:19:27,836 --> 01:19:30,385
It was a bit of a curve ball.

1577
01:19:30,631 --> 01:19:32,508
Yeah, I think I'm going to go.

1578
01:19:32,674 --> 01:19:36,224
I'm sorry. I should just probably go.

1579
01:19:36,762 --> 01:19:37,809
Annie,

1580
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:40,524
I don't know what you are getting so upset about.

1581
01:19:40,682 --> 01:19:42,104
Because you don't know me.

1582
01:19:42,726 --> 01:19:45,400
You don't know anything about me or my life or...

1583
01:19:45,562 --> 01:19:48,406
Well, no, because... I don't know
what you're trying to do here.

1584
01:19:48,565 --> 01:19:50,659
I don't need you to fix me. To fix you?

1585
01:19:50,817 --> 01:19:53,195
I don't need any help. I mean,
who do you think you are?

1586
01:19:53,362 --> 01:19:56,115
Jesus, Annie, we had a really good
time. And now you are being all...

1587
01:19:56,281 --> 01:19:58,830
It's my fault. I shouldn't have come here last night.

1588
01:19:58,992 --> 01:20:01,040
Last night was a mistake.

1589
01:20:01,203 --> 01:20:02,580
Fucking hell. All right.

1590
01:20:18,554 --> 01:20:21,398
Hey, it's Lillian. Leave a message after the beep.

1591
01:20:22,224 --> 01:20:24,818
Hey, Lil, it's me.

1592
01:20:25,185 --> 01:20:26,186
Umm...

1593
01:20:26,853 --> 01:20:31,609
I'm sure you're probably still a little
bit mad at me, but I hope not.

1594
01:20:32,317 --> 01:20:36,493
Anyway, the excitement still continues with me.

1595
01:20:37,906 --> 01:20:41,661
I just slept with a cop that pulled me over

1596
01:20:41,827 --> 01:20:46,958
and I woke up today, and he was
really sweet and nice and cute.

1597
01:20:47,249 --> 01:20:50,503
So, naturally, I ran out as fast as I could.

1598
01:20:50,669 --> 01:20:52,342
What's wrong with me?

1599
01:20:52,879 --> 01:20:53,880
Umm...

1600
01:20:53,964 --> 01:20:57,059
Anyway, I know you are busy and stuff,

1601
01:20:57,175 --> 01:21:00,270
so just call me when you get a chance.

1602
01:21:00,429 --> 01:21:04,605
I'd love to talk this out with you when you can.

1603
01:21:04,766 --> 01:21:06,689
Okay, bye.

1604
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:17,534
Annie! Annie, wake up.

1605
01:21:17,696 --> 01:21:19,448
It's 11:00 a.m.

1606
01:21:21,116 --> 01:21:22,868
Oh, shit.

1607
01:21:23,035 --> 01:21:24,662
You got a package.

1608
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:28,378
I'd bring it to you, but you said,
"Don't touch my things."

1609
01:21:57,944 --> 01:21:59,696
Please join us for a Parisian brunch

1610
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:01,532
at the home of Helen Harris lll

1611
01:22:01,615 --> 01:22:04,789
to celebrate the marriage of Lillian
Donovan and Douglas Price.

1612
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:10,212
Let us shower Lillian with gifts and
love. Répondez s'il vous plait. Yay!

1613
01:22:19,007 --> 01:22:20,850
Excuse me. Oh. Hi.

1614
01:22:20,926 --> 01:22:23,395
I'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend. Oh.

1615
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:26,019
I want to get her a necklace that
says, "Best Friends Forever."

1616
01:22:26,807 --> 01:22:28,309
You sure you want it to say "Forever"?

1617
01:22:29,184 --> 01:22:30,310
Yeah, why?

1618
01:22:30,435 --> 01:22:32,108
Come on. "Forever"?

1619
01:22:32,979 --> 01:22:33,980
Forever.

1620
01:22:34,064 --> 01:22:36,283
I don't think you guys will be best
friends forever. No offense.

1621
01:22:36,358 --> 01:22:37,780
But you know...

1622
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:39,907
The friends you have when you
are younger sometimes...

1623
01:22:40,153 --> 01:22:42,201
Sometimes you grow apart when you get older.

1624
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,827
Maybe she'll find a new best friend.

1625
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:45,708
And maybe she will be more successful than you are

1626
01:22:45,784 --> 01:22:48,003
and prettier and richer and skinnier

1627
01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:50,414
and they end up doing everything together.

1628
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,837
You are weird.

1629
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:54,676
I'm not weird. Okay?

1630
01:22:55,335 --> 01:22:56,336
Yes, you are.

1631
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,421
No, I'm not, and you started it.

1632
01:22:57,587 --> 01:22:59,134
No, you started it.

1633
01:22:59,297 --> 01:23:01,174
Did you forget to take your Xanax this morning?

1634
01:23:01,341 --> 01:23:02,843
God, I feel bad for your parents.

1635
01:23:02,926 --> 01:23:03,973
I feel bad for your face.

1636
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:06,355
Okay, well, call me when your boobs come in.

1637
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:08,103
You call me when yours come in.

1638
01:23:08,223 --> 01:23:10,191
What, do you have four boyfriends? Exactly.

1639
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:13,229
Yeah, okay, have fun having a baby at your prom.

1640
01:23:13,395 --> 01:23:14,942
You look like an old mop.

1641
01:23:15,105 --> 01:23:16,948
You know what? You're not as
popular as you think you are.

1642
01:23:17,023 --> 01:23:18,024
I am very popular.

1643
01:23:18,316 --> 01:23:20,284
I'm sure you are.

1644
01:23:20,736 --> 01:23:21,862
Very popular.

1645
01:23:22,028 --> 01:23:23,701
Well, you're an old, single loser

1646
01:23:23,822 --> 01:23:25,449
who is never going to have any friends.

1647
01:23:26,241 --> 01:23:27,538
You're a little cunt.

1648
01:23:35,584 --> 01:23:36,836
I'm sorry.

1649
01:23:40,589 --> 01:23:42,717
Let me tell my mom, okay.

1650
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,973
I already told her.

1651
01:23:45,552 --> 01:23:46,724
Was she mad?

1652
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,818
Hi, Annie, it's Rhodes again.

1653
01:23:57,981 --> 01:23:59,403
Since you're not returning any of my calls,

1654
01:23:59,566 --> 01:24:00,988
I assume that you're not interested

1655
01:24:01,151 --> 01:24:03,404
in spending any more time with me, which is fine.

1656
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:06,995
So don't worry, I won't be bothering you ever again.

1657
01:24:07,824 --> 01:24:09,542
Get those taillights fixed.

1658
01:24:17,334 --> 01:24:21,589
We'd like to invite you to no longer
live with us any more.

1659
01:24:23,006 --> 01:24:24,758
What? What do you mean? I don't get it.

1660
01:24:25,091 --> 01:24:28,015
The thing is, we decided that it
was actually a bit immature

1661
01:24:28,094 --> 01:24:29,437
for a grown-up brother and sister to

1662
01:24:29,596 --> 01:24:30,939
still be living together with a roommate.

1663
01:24:31,223 --> 01:24:34,022
At our age, it's a bit ridiculous, isn't it? Yeah.

1664
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:36,228
We look a bit silly, don't we? Pathetic.

1665
01:24:36,394 --> 01:24:38,488
So we are actually going to live together alone.

1666
01:24:38,855 --> 01:24:40,107
Without you.

1667
01:24:40,315 --> 01:24:41,783
You're moving out.

1668
01:24:45,487 --> 01:24:46,659
She's not moving.

1669
01:24:46,738 --> 01:24:47,990
She will move.

1670
01:24:48,156 --> 01:24:49,408
Eventually. Eventually.

1671
01:24:49,491 --> 01:24:50,617
She has to.

1672
01:24:50,826 --> 01:24:51,918
She is taking it in.

1673
01:24:51,993 --> 01:24:53,586
You have to leave.

1674
01:24:53,745 --> 01:24:55,122
Oh! That's prickly.

1675
01:25:00,377 --> 01:25:01,970
Hi. Hi.

1676
01:25:03,964 --> 01:25:06,433
Remember when you thought I hit bottom?

1677
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,643
That wasn't bottom.

1678
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:10,642
Come here.

1679
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:14,315
We're gonna have fun. I, for one,
am really glad you're here.

1680
01:25:14,808 --> 01:25:16,105
And guess what?

1681
01:25:16,643 --> 01:25:18,236
Good timing.

1682
01:25:18,728 --> 01:25:20,981
You know what just came in today on the Netflix?

1683
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:23,567
Cast Away. Tom Hanks.

1684
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:25,735
It's like Forrest Gump, but on an island.

1685
01:25:25,902 --> 01:25:27,996
Honey, you are gonna love it.

1686
01:25:56,516 --> 01:25:58,985
My God.

1687
01:25:59,436 --> 01:26:00,904
This is her driveway?

1688
01:26:02,439 --> 01:26:04,487
Who is that man?

1689
01:26:08,653 --> 01:26:10,872
Are you a guest of Helen Harris III?

1690
01:26:11,698 --> 01:26:13,871
Yes. Technically. I guess.

1691
01:26:14,034 --> 01:26:16,036
An attendant will meet you at the stables.

1692
01:26:16,286 --> 01:26:17,458
Where?

1693
01:26:17,579 --> 01:26:18,796
The shower is over the second bridge.

1694
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:21,834
Pink lemonade? Thank you.

1695
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,049
I don't have a cup holder. Can I just give that...

1696
01:26:28,882 --> 01:26:32,056
Pink lemonade. Nice. Nice touch.

1697
01:26:33,553 --> 01:26:35,021
Shit.

1698
01:26:42,812 --> 01:26:45,031
God damn it, that's good.

1699
01:26:45,106 --> 01:26:46,107
Mmm.

1700
01:26:48,026 --> 01:26:49,869
Shit, that is fresh.

1701
01:27:06,419 --> 01:27:08,888
This is the most beautiful shower I have ever been to.

1702
01:27:09,255 --> 01:27:11,758
Yes, and Helen is giving out the cutest party favors.

1703
01:27:11,841 --> 01:27:14,720
I know, I love their pink berets.

1704
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:32,119
Would you like some champagne? Yes.

1705
01:27:32,529 --> 01:27:33,576
It's French.

1706
01:27:34,781 --> 01:27:36,658
Annie. Hey.

1707
01:27:37,075 --> 01:27:38,076
Hi.

1708
01:27:39,244 --> 01:27:41,087
How are you doing? You're here.

1709
01:27:41,621 --> 01:27:44,090
Yeah, I'm here. I was invited. Sorry.

1710
01:27:44,457 --> 01:27:46,880
Of course you were invited. I
just meant you have arrived.

1711
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,634
No, I was just joking. Okay.

1712
01:27:50,547 --> 01:27:52,174
Can you believe this? Isn't it amazing?

1713
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:54,092
Yep.

1714
01:27:54,259 --> 01:27:55,806
Yeah. it's nice.

1715
01:27:55,969 --> 01:27:57,971
Yeah. Pretty.

1716
01:27:58,596 --> 01:28:00,018
Are we okay?

1717
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,642
Yes, I'm sorry I haven't called.

1718
01:28:01,808 --> 01:28:04,231
I just didn't want to bug you, but...

1719
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:06,654
Forgive me. It just got crazy.

1720
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:09,574
There has been lots of organizing,
and... I have so much to tell you.

1721
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:12,152
I have to say hi to my aunt or
she will get mad at my mom.

1722
01:28:12,235 --> 01:28:13,657
No, you gotta go do your party rounds.

1723
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,288
Yeah.

1724
01:28:15,447 --> 01:28:16,619
I'll see you in a minute.

1725
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:17,912
Yeah. Okay.

1726
01:28:18,074 --> 01:28:19,747
Oh! Rita, you got all our towels.

1727
01:28:19,826 --> 01:28:22,170
Yes, I did. Because I love you, Kitten.

1728
01:28:22,412 --> 01:28:24,414
All right, let's see what's next.

1729
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:26,587
Another one, another one, another one.

1730
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:30,095
I know who this is from. I can tell by the wrapping.

1731
01:28:30,253 --> 01:28:31,630
Is that you?

1732
01:28:34,132 --> 01:28:36,476
Annie, you made this.

1733
01:28:37,469 --> 01:28:38,516
Look.

1734
01:28:38,762 --> 01:28:40,480
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my gosh.

1735
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,227
It's us, Annie.

1736
01:28:42,807 --> 01:28:44,809
- Oh, my God.
- Let me see.

1737
01:28:46,269 --> 01:28:47,737
Oh, my God.

1738
01:28:48,688 --> 01:28:53,740
This is all my favorite stuff from all
the stores I love in Milwaukee.

1739
01:28:53,818 --> 01:28:56,867
Annie! This is so unbelievable.

1740
01:28:57,322 --> 01:28:58,369
Wilson Phillips.

1741
01:28:59,741 --> 01:29:01,038
Man, I love Wilson Phillips.

1742
01:29:01,201 --> 01:29:03,249
We listened to Hold On probably 10,000 times

1743
01:29:03,328 --> 01:29:05,080
when I got my driver's license.

1744
01:29:05,288 --> 01:29:08,212
This is such an amazing gift.

1745
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,877
Thank you. You're welcome.

1746
01:29:11,002 --> 01:29:12,629
I feel really bad, Lil,

1747
01:29:12,712 --> 01:29:14,806
I didn't get a chance to actually get you a present

1748
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:16,929
because I have been so busy organizing the shower.

1749
01:29:17,008 --> 01:29:19,557
Helen, please. It's more than enough.

1750
01:29:19,719 --> 01:29:21,972
Here is a card to say congratulations.

1751
01:29:22,055 --> 01:29:25,901
Thank you. Gosh, you have really outdone yourself.

1752
01:29:28,228 --> 01:29:29,605
Oh, my God, Helen.

1753
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:33,191
Honey, what is it?

1754
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:36,278
Helen's taking me to Paris.

1755
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,369
Your face!

1756
01:29:40,573 --> 01:29:42,041
I got you. I fooled you.

1757
01:29:42,117 --> 01:29:43,118
Look at your face.

1758
01:29:44,244 --> 01:29:47,418
It's just a little pre-wedding vacation.
And while we're there,

1759
01:29:47,497 --> 01:29:49,750
we're gonna meet the designer
of her dress and have a fitting.

1760
01:29:49,916 --> 01:29:52,419
You are taking me to Paris?

1761
01:29:52,585 --> 01:29:55,134
Oh, my God! This is the best present ever!

1762
01:29:55,755 --> 01:29:57,257
Thank you so much.

1763
01:29:57,382 --> 01:29:58,383
A Paris!

1764
01:29:58,508 --> 01:29:59,555
Oh, my God.

1765
01:29:59,759 --> 01:30:01,352
Are you fucking kidding me?

1766
01:30:03,096 --> 01:30:04,393
Annie! No, Mom.

1767
01:30:04,472 --> 01:30:05,769
Motherfucking Paris?

1768
01:30:05,932 --> 01:30:06,979
Annie, what are you doing?

1769
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,400
I told you about Paris, Helen. I
told you about this whole idea!

1770
01:30:10,478 --> 01:30:11,821
- Annie, calm down.
- No, Lillian!

1771
01:30:11,938 --> 01:30:14,487
What, you're gonna go to Paris with Helen now?

1772
01:30:14,607 --> 01:30:16,701
What, you guys are gonna ride around on bikes

1773
01:30:16,776 --> 01:30:18,449
with berets and fucking baguettes

1774
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,197
in the basket of the front of your bikes?

1775
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,452
How romantic!

1776
01:30:21,739 --> 01:30:25,084
What woman gives another woman a trip to Paris?

1777
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,128
Am I right? Lesbian.

1778
01:30:27,287 --> 01:30:28,880
We're all thinking it, aren't we? I'm not.

1779
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:31,299
Okay? Yes, we're all thinking it, right? I was.

1780
01:30:31,457 --> 01:30:34,301
Annie... Lillian, this is not the "you" that I know.

1781
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:35,803
The "you" that I know would have

1782
01:30:35,962 --> 01:30:37,305
walked in here and rolled your eyes

1783
01:30:37,422 --> 01:30:38,924
and thought this was completely

1784
01:30:39,048 --> 01:30:40,550
over-the-top, ridiculous and stupid.

1785
01:30:40,633 --> 01:30:44,137
Look at this shower! Look at that fucking cookie!

1786
01:30:44,345 --> 01:30:46,393
Did you really think that this group of women

1787
01:30:46,514 --> 01:30:48,608
was going to finish that cookie?

1788
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:50,318
Really? You know what? That reminds me, actually.

1789
01:30:50,476 --> 01:30:53,980
I never got a chance to try that fucking cookie!

1790
01:30:55,648 --> 01:30:57,491
Stupid fucking cookie!

1791
01:31:01,154 --> 01:31:03,998
Delicious! Stupid cookie. I think I'll...

1792
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,204
Maybe it's better if I dip it in the chocolate.

1793
01:31:15,293 --> 01:31:16,510
is this what you want, Lillian?

1794
01:31:23,426 --> 01:31:24,723
This is so awesome.

1795
01:31:24,802 --> 01:31:31,185
All right, let's have some nice,
hot, unsanitary chocolate!

1796
01:31:38,066 --> 01:31:40,239
Ahh! It's hot! Jesus! God!

1797
01:31:40,318 --> 01:31:42,992
Christ, Annie. Have you lost your fucking mind?

1798
01:31:43,071 --> 01:31:44,948
What are you doing? What am I doing?

1799
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:47,125
You wouldn't know, would you? Where have you been?

1800
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,373
You would have no idea. Let me fill you in, okay?

1801
01:31:49,577 --> 01:31:52,126
Ever since you got engaged, everything
has turned to shit!

1802
01:31:52,205 --> 01:31:54,924
You know what? This is supposed to be about my time!

1803
01:31:55,041 --> 01:31:57,169
You have managed to ruin every event

1804
01:31:57,293 --> 01:31:59,421
in my wedding. Thank you very much.

1805
01:31:59,545 --> 01:32:00,888
Okay, well, thank you very much.

1806
01:32:01,005 --> 01:32:02,382
It's all her fault. It is not mine!

1807
01:32:02,465 --> 01:32:03,682
And you would know that,

1808
01:32:03,758 --> 01:32:06,762
if you got your beautiful haired
head out of your asshole.

1809
01:32:06,844 --> 01:32:11,065
In fact, out of her asshole, which
I'm sure is perfectly bleached.

1810
01:32:11,182 --> 01:32:12,809
You know what? It is!

1811
01:32:12,892 --> 01:32:14,189
And you know how I know?

1812
01:32:14,269 --> 01:32:16,192
Because I went to the fucking salon with her

1813
01:32:16,312 --> 01:32:18,235
and I got my asshole bleached, too!

1814
01:32:18,564 --> 01:32:21,408
And I love my new asshole!

1815
01:32:22,318 --> 01:32:24,946
You know what? Why can't you just be happy for me

1816
01:32:25,029 --> 01:32:28,659
and then go home and talk behind my
back later, like a normal person?

1817
01:32:30,243 --> 01:32:32,792
I am happy for you, Lillian. I am very happy for you.

1818
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:36,465
I wish you well. I won't bother you any more.

1819
01:32:37,417 --> 01:32:40,170
Are you kidding me? Annie!

1820
01:32:40,253 --> 01:32:41,926
Go, go, go, go, go!

1821
01:32:42,422 --> 01:32:44,720
Get back here! Stop.

1822
01:32:46,384 --> 01:32:48,933
No, no! She does not get a party favor.

1823
01:32:49,137 --> 01:32:51,014
She does not get a dog!

1824
01:32:53,599 --> 01:32:55,192
And if you are going to act like this,

1825
01:32:55,268 --> 01:32:57,691
then don't even bother coming to my wedding!

1826
01:33:06,404 --> 01:33:07,496
I'm proud of you, Lil.

1827
01:33:07,613 --> 01:33:08,739
Shut up, Helen!

1828
01:33:10,116 --> 01:33:12,995
Anybody else have anything they want to share today?

1829
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:18,542
I took two dogs already. They're in the back of my van.

1830
01:33:36,976 --> 01:33:38,319
What?

1831
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,414
What? Where are you going?

1832
01:33:51,115 --> 01:33:52,662
Hit and run! Classy!

1833
01:33:52,909 --> 01:33:54,331
Perfect! Okay.

1834
01:33:55,453 --> 01:33:59,003
I'm gonna find you! I'm coming!

1835
01:33:59,165 --> 01:34:03,545
Come on! Come on! Come on.

1836
01:34:07,006 --> 01:34:09,008
No!

1837
01:34:24,315 --> 01:34:26,613
Shit.

1838
01:34:30,196 --> 01:34:32,415
I can't say I'm surprised.

1839
01:34:32,573 --> 01:34:34,746
I did tell you to get your lights fixed.

1840
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:36,411
Yeah, I know.

1841
01:34:36,536 --> 01:34:38,664
And now here we are.

1842
01:34:40,206 --> 01:34:43,631
Look, I have had a horrible day.

1843
01:34:43,793 --> 01:34:46,171
I don't need a lecture from you right now, okay?

1844
01:34:46,337 --> 01:34:47,884
I just... Helen just...

1845
01:34:48,339 --> 01:34:49,340
Oh! Don't...

1846
01:34:49,715 --> 01:34:51,513
This didn't happen because of Helen.

1847
01:34:51,843 --> 01:34:54,562
This happened because you didn't
get your taillights fixed.

1848
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,222
It's pretty simple.

1849
01:34:59,725 --> 01:35:02,023
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is

1850
01:35:02,145 --> 01:35:04,489
to see you, night by night, drive past me

1851
01:35:04,647 --> 01:35:07,366
with your fucking taillights still broken?

1852
01:35:07,525 --> 01:35:09,653
Do you have any idea how crazy that makes me?

1853
01:35:09,819 --> 01:35:12,242
It's a simple solution!

1854
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:13,413
Your problem, Annie,

1855
01:35:13,489 --> 01:35:16,413
is that you just don't understand
that you can hurt people

1856
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:18,749
with these broken lights.

1857
01:35:19,996 --> 01:35:22,090
Don't you see how irresponsible this is?

1858
01:35:22,165 --> 01:35:25,920
Yes, I should have gotten my fucking taillights fixed.

1859
01:35:26,085 --> 01:35:28,008
But I didn't, okay? I didn't.

1860
01:35:28,171 --> 01:35:30,344
Listen, don't worry about it.

1861
01:35:30,506 --> 01:35:33,055
Seriously. Your message was received.

1862
01:35:33,217 --> 01:35:36,016
No, look, please, I don't know what's
going on with me right now.

1863
01:35:36,095 --> 01:35:39,941
Look, it's fine. Don't bother.
Really, what's done is done.

1864
01:35:40,099 --> 01:35:41,601
That's it? Where are you going?

1865
01:35:41,726 --> 01:35:44,354
That's it! That's it. That's how this works.

1866
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:45,526
Come on. I didn't...

1867
01:35:45,605 --> 01:35:49,360
For the record, Annie, you flirted with me.

1868
01:35:49,734 --> 01:35:53,705
You made me feel like you really liked me,

1869
01:35:53,779 --> 01:35:55,122
which was really unfair.

1870
01:35:55,448 --> 01:35:58,952
And then you came home with
me and we did stuff, fun stuff,

1871
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:02,417
and then you just left, just like it was nothing.

1872
01:36:02,955 --> 01:36:06,505
Oh, please. I know how guys do this thing.

1873
01:36:06,584 --> 01:36:08,086
I know how guys act.

1874
01:36:08,252 --> 01:36:10,801
One minute, it means something.
The next minute, it doesn't.

1875
01:36:10,922 --> 01:36:11,969
Right, yeah, you've got it all figured out.

1876
01:36:12,089 --> 01:36:13,136
Yeah.

1877
01:36:13,216 --> 01:36:15,935
How is that working out for you? Pretty good?

1878
01:36:19,222 --> 01:36:20,394
Boom!

1879
01:36:20,473 --> 01:36:22,817
What's up, fuck-buddy? You call
for some roadside assistance?

1880
01:36:27,647 --> 01:36:31,242
Thanks, officer. I can handle it from here on out.

1881
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,327
Come on!

1882
01:36:38,658 --> 01:36:40,285
I didn't have anyone else to call!

1883
01:36:40,368 --> 01:36:41,745
I didn't know that you were gonna show up!

1884
01:36:41,827 --> 01:36:43,249
That's the problem with cops, Annie.

1885
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:44,839
We're just never there when you need us.

1886
01:36:46,958 --> 01:36:48,005
That cop talks weird.

1887
01:36:54,924 --> 01:36:58,303
- Come on, dingus. Tick-tock. I got shit to do.

1888
01:36:59,345 --> 01:37:01,689
Check it out. Look what's steering the car.

1889
01:37:07,937 --> 01:37:09,564
Thanks again for picking me up.

1890
01:37:09,647 --> 01:37:11,149
Not a problem.

1891
01:37:11,691 --> 01:37:13,068
Were you busy?

1892
01:37:13,317 --> 01:37:15,490
Well, it is Friday.

1893
01:37:17,697 --> 01:37:20,416
You know, you look tired.

1894
01:37:20,533 --> 01:37:22,627
If you're tired, you can totally

1895
01:37:22,743 --> 01:37:24,871
lay down in my lap, if you want.

1896
01:37:25,413 --> 01:37:26,460
What?

1897
01:37:26,539 --> 01:37:28,792
Just take a little lap-nap.

1898
01:37:35,047 --> 01:37:36,469
If you want.

1899
01:37:37,258 --> 01:37:38,680
Open for biz.

1900
01:37:38,843 --> 01:37:40,390
Okay, can you just pull over?

1901
01:37:40,553 --> 01:37:42,476
Yeah, actually, that's an even better idea.

1902
01:37:42,555 --> 01:37:45,980
No, no, no, can you please just
stop the car? I want to get out.

1903
01:37:46,058 --> 01:37:47,230
No, it's super gravelly.

1904
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:49,278
Please pull over! Why?

1905
01:37:49,353 --> 01:37:51,731
Because I would rather get murdered out here

1906
01:37:51,814 --> 01:37:53,987
than spend the next half-an-hour with you.

1907
01:37:54,066 --> 01:37:55,693
Can you please just pull over?

1908
01:37:56,068 --> 01:37:58,162
Come on, Annie. It's called humor.

1909
01:37:58,321 --> 01:38:00,164
Learn about it.

1910
01:38:01,032 --> 01:38:02,955
Besides, I would never last a half-hour.

1911
01:38:07,496 --> 01:38:08,622
Good bye, Ted.

1912
01:38:13,169 --> 01:38:15,968
If you're trying to turn me on, it's working.

1913
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:19,717
You used me!

1914
01:38:19,884 --> 01:38:23,184
No big deal. You are no longer my number three!

1915
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:37,322
Wilson!

1916
01:38:40,738 --> 01:38:44,333
Wilson! I'm sorry!

1917
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,083
I'm sorry, Wilson.

1918
01:38:49,038 --> 01:38:51,257
Wilson, I'm sorry!

1919
01:38:51,999 --> 01:38:53,000
I'm sorry!

1920
01:38:53,084 --> 01:38:54,381
Oh, no, Wilson.

1921
01:38:54,543 --> 01:38:55,715
Wilson!

1922
01:38:57,922 --> 01:38:59,595
I'm coming in.

1923
01:38:59,757 --> 01:39:01,759
Let's go, let's go. And we're walking.

1924
01:39:02,176 --> 01:39:04,053
Okay, we're walking. Heel. Heel!

1925
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:06,814
No pee. No! Not on the carpet!

1926
01:39:06,972 --> 01:39:09,100
Okay, we're coming... We're coming in.

1927
01:39:09,183 --> 01:39:11,561
Everybody is in and having fun.

1928
01:39:11,727 --> 01:39:13,980
We're having fun. And heel! We're heeling.

1929
01:39:14,689 --> 01:39:15,690
Heel!

1930
01:39:16,148 --> 01:39:17,570
How many of those did you take?

1931
01:39:17,692 --> 01:39:20,366
I took nine.

1932
01:39:20,528 --> 01:39:25,284
Yeah, I did slightly over-commit
to the whole dog thing.

1933
01:39:25,366 --> 01:39:28,290
It turns out, I'm probably more comfortable with six.

1934
01:39:28,452 --> 01:39:31,547
It's a lot... That's a lot of energy to deal with.

1935
01:39:31,706 --> 01:39:33,299
But you wouldn't know anything about that,

1936
01:39:33,416 --> 01:39:35,009
because you haven't been returning my calls.

1937
01:39:36,669 --> 01:39:38,717
And say what, Megan?

1938
01:39:38,796 --> 01:39:41,766
Say, "Hi, I can't get off the couch.

1939
01:39:41,966 --> 01:39:45,436
"I got fired from my job. I got
kicked out of my apartment.

1940
01:39:45,511 --> 01:39:48,765
"I can't pay any of my bills. My car is a piece of shit.

1941
01:39:48,848 --> 01:39:51,397
"I don't have any friends. The last time

1942
01:39:51,475 --> 01:39:53,819
You know what I find interesting about that, Annie?

1943
01:39:53,894 --> 01:39:56,864
It's interesting to me that you
have absolutely no friends.

1944
01:39:56,939 --> 01:39:58,407
You know why it's interesting?

1945
01:39:58,566 --> 01:39:59,909
Here's a friend standing directly

1946
01:40:00,025 --> 01:40:01,402
in front of you, trying to talk to you.

1947
01:40:01,527 --> 01:40:02,949
And you choose to talk about the fact

1948
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:04,492
that you don't have any friends.

1949
01:40:04,572 --> 01:40:05,949
You know what I mean.

1950
01:40:06,073 --> 01:40:07,450
No, I don't think you want any help.

1951
01:40:07,533 --> 01:40:09,581
I think you want to have a little
pity party. That's not true.

1952
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:11,754
I think Annie wants a little pity party.

1953
01:40:11,871 --> 01:40:13,919
You're an asshole, Annie! Oh,
my God. What are you doing?

1954
01:40:13,998 --> 01:40:16,592
You're an asshole. I'm life. Is life bothering you?

1955
01:40:16,667 --> 01:40:17,714
Yes! What are you doing?

1956
01:40:17,877 --> 01:40:18,924
I'm life, Annie. I'm life, Annie.

1957
01:40:19,128 --> 01:40:21,551
You have got to fight back on life.

1958
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:22,882
Megan!

1959
01:40:23,007 --> 01:40:24,259
You better learn to fight.

1960
01:40:24,508 --> 01:40:25,509
Megan!

1961
01:40:25,593 --> 01:40:27,391
I'm life and I'm going to bite you in the ass!

1962
01:40:29,555 --> 01:40:31,478
Megan... it's not me. I'm your life. Turn over!

1963
01:40:31,557 --> 01:40:32,729
My God!

1964
01:40:32,808 --> 01:40:36,688
I'm trying to get you to fight for your
shitty life, and you won't do it!

1965
01:40:36,771 --> 01:40:37,818
You just won't do it. Stop it.

1966
01:40:38,063 --> 01:40:40,236
You stop slapping yourself. Stop slapping yourself.

1967
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:42,902
I'm your life, Annie. I'm your shitty...

1968
01:40:44,278 --> 01:40:45,279
I'm sorry.

1969
01:40:46,405 --> 01:40:47,406
Nice hit.

1970
01:40:50,201 --> 01:40:51,202
All right.

1971
01:40:51,285 --> 01:40:53,538
I'm glad to see you've got a little bit of spark in you.

1972
01:40:54,371 --> 01:40:56,248
I knew that Annie was in there somewhere.

1973
01:40:56,624 --> 01:40:58,092
I think...

1974
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:01,595
I think you're ready now to hear
a little story about a girl.

1975
01:41:01,754 --> 01:41:03,802
A girl named Megan.

1976
01:41:03,964 --> 01:41:05,466
A girl named Megan that didn't have

1977
01:41:05,591 --> 01:41:07,138
a very good time in high school.

1978
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:10,396
I'm referring to myself when I say "Megan."

1979
01:41:10,554 --> 01:41:12,477
It's me, Megan. Yeah, I got that.

1980
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,142
I know you look at me now and think,

1981
01:41:14,225 --> 01:41:16,193
"Boy, she must have breezed through high school."

1982
01:41:16,268 --> 01:41:17,815
Not the case, Annie.

1983
01:41:17,895 --> 01:41:21,741
No, this was not easy going up
and down the halls. Okay?

1984
01:41:21,816 --> 01:41:23,409
They used to try to blow me up.

1985
01:41:23,526 --> 01:41:25,119
They threw firecrackers at my head.

1986
01:41:25,736 --> 01:41:26,737
Firecrackers.

1987
01:41:27,112 --> 01:41:29,535
I mean literally. I'm not saying that figuratively.

1988
01:41:29,615 --> 01:41:32,334
I got firecrackers thrown at my
head. They called me a freak.

1989
01:41:32,868 --> 01:41:34,120
Do you think I let that break me?

1990
01:41:34,537 --> 01:41:36,835
Do you think I went home to my mommy, crying,

1991
01:41:36,914 --> 01:41:39,667
"I don't have any friends. Megan
doesn't have any friends"?

1992
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:42,128
No, I did not. You know what I did?

1993
01:41:42,211 --> 01:41:44,714
I pulled myself up, I studied really hard.

1994
01:41:44,797 --> 01:41:46,970
I read every book in the library. And now?

1995
01:41:47,049 --> 01:41:48,471
I work for the government. I have

1996
01:41:48,592 --> 01:41:50,014
the highest possible security clearance.

1997
01:41:50,094 --> 01:41:51,641
Don't repeat that! I won't.

1998
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:52,767
I can't protect you.

1999
01:41:53,055 --> 01:41:55,308
I know where all the nukes are and I know the codes.

2000
01:41:57,309 --> 01:41:58,356
I won't say anything.

2001
01:41:58,602 --> 01:42:00,730
You would be amazed.

2002
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:02,323
A lot of shopping malls.

2003
01:42:02,523 --> 01:42:03,740
Don't repeat that!

2004
01:42:03,858 --> 01:42:05,110
I won't.

2005
01:42:05,276 --> 01:42:06,368
I have six houses.

2006
01:42:06,735 --> 01:42:09,784
I bought an 18-wheeler a couple of
months ago just because I could.

2007
01:42:09,864 --> 01:42:11,081
Okay, you lost Lillian.

2008
01:42:11,156 --> 01:42:12,499
You got another best friend

2009
01:42:12,575 --> 01:42:14,248
sitting right in front of you, if you would notice.

2010
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:16,207
Huh?

2011
01:42:16,287 --> 01:42:18,005
Now, you got to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

2012
01:42:18,664 --> 01:42:20,291
Okay, 'cause I do not associate with people

2013
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,043
that blame the world for their problems.

2014
01:42:22,126 --> 01:42:23,878
'Cause you're your problem, Annie.

2015
01:42:24,044 --> 01:42:26,422
And you're also your solution.

2016
01:42:27,965 --> 01:42:29,512
Right? I mean, that's...

2017
01:42:29,592 --> 01:42:31,720
You get that?

2018
01:42:32,887 --> 01:42:34,355
I just miss her, I guess.

2019
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,392
Yeah, I know you do.

2020
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,818
I know you do.

2021
01:42:40,227 --> 01:42:42,195
All right, come on. Bring it in.

2022
01:42:42,271 --> 01:42:43,693
There's the Annie...

2023
01:42:43,772 --> 01:42:45,490
There's the Annie I knew was there, okay?

2024
01:42:45,608 --> 01:42:47,861
All right. Man, you have got to wash your hair.

2025
01:42:47,985 --> 01:42:48,986
I'm sorry.

2026
01:42:49,069 --> 01:42:50,491
You've got to wash that hair.

2027
01:43:16,138 --> 01:43:17,435
What's wrong?

2028
01:43:17,598 --> 01:43:18,941
Nothing.

2029
01:43:23,896 --> 01:43:24,943
I love you.

2030
01:43:38,452 --> 01:43:40,921
Looks great. Thank you.

2031
01:43:41,163 --> 01:43:44,963
Rhodes and I worked out a deal way
back when, so it's on the house.

2032
01:43:45,668 --> 01:43:46,760
Are you serious?

2033
01:43:46,961 --> 01:43:49,259
Yeah. I owe him big time.

2034
01:43:49,505 --> 01:43:51,257
That's really nice.

2035
01:43:58,681 --> 01:43:59,933
Hey, Mom?

2036
01:44:02,101 --> 01:44:03,398
This is my mom, Judy.

2037
01:44:03,477 --> 01:44:05,479
Hey, how are you? Nice to meet you.

2038
01:44:05,562 --> 01:44:07,485
Good to meet you, too.

2039
01:44:08,482 --> 01:44:10,484
Wait a minute, don't I know you from AA?

2040
01:44:10,818 --> 01:44:14,163
Oh, my gosh. You made that artichoke dip, didn't you?

2041
01:44:14,321 --> 01:44:15,823
It's good, huh?

2042
01:44:15,906 --> 01:44:16,953
It's just delicious.

2043
01:45:21,847 --> 01:45:22,848
Come in.

2044
01:45:27,436 --> 01:45:29,530
Are you sure you're not gonna come with me today?

2045
01:45:29,772 --> 01:45:31,274
It's Lillian's big day.

2046
01:45:31,356 --> 01:45:33,154
Mom, she doesn't want me there.

2047
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:38,788
I'll fix you a tuna fish sandwich.

2048
01:45:39,073 --> 01:45:40,370
Mom, it's 8:00 in the morning.

2049
01:45:40,491 --> 01:45:41,913
You can put syrup on it.

2050
01:45:51,877 --> 01:45:53,299
I know.

2051
01:45:54,463 --> 01:45:55,464
Hi.

2052
01:45:55,798 --> 01:45:56,890
What do you want?

2053
01:45:57,049 --> 01:45:59,097
I was wondering if you knew where Lillian was.

2054
01:45:59,468 --> 01:46:01,391
No, why would I... What do you mean?

2055
01:46:01,762 --> 01:46:04,390
I can't find her. We've looked everywhere.

2056
01:46:04,556 --> 01:46:05,648
What?

2057
01:46:05,724 --> 01:46:07,897
She is missing. Can you help?

2058
01:46:08,393 --> 01:46:10,066
Okay, just wait here. I think I know

2059
01:46:10,229 --> 01:46:11,902
someone that might be able to help.

2060
01:46:12,064 --> 01:46:14,237
I'll get my Keys. Can I just use...

2061
01:46:17,402 --> 01:46:21,327
I mean, I just don't know what could
have possibly gone wrong.

2062
01:46:21,406 --> 01:46:22,999
Everything was going smoothly.

2063
01:46:23,075 --> 01:46:25,043
The dress looked fantastic. It had come in from Paris.

2064
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:27,663
Dougie was being great and very helpful.

2065
01:46:27,746 --> 01:46:32,377
I had organized everything to the last final detail.

2066
01:46:32,459 --> 01:46:33,927
I just...

2067
01:46:34,086 --> 01:46:35,759
I don't know what's happened to her.

2068
01:46:35,963 --> 01:46:38,091
I don't know. You should know, right?

2069
01:46:38,173 --> 01:46:41,473
You're her best friend. It's weird that you don't know.

2070
01:46:41,635 --> 01:46:42,887
You guys are so close.

2071
01:46:46,974 --> 01:46:50,478
Annie, I want to apologize to you personally

2072
01:46:50,602 --> 01:46:53,355
for all of the things that have gone down.

2073
01:46:53,438 --> 01:46:55,361
I know that I hurt you,

2074
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,943
and that I created a distance between you and Lillian.

2075
01:46:58,026 --> 01:46:59,869
I want to apologize for that... I don't want to hear...

2076
01:46:59,945 --> 01:47:01,492
...and everything that happened

2077
01:47:01,613 --> 01:47:03,160
at the shower. And with Las Vegas...

2078
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,038
Okay, I don't want to hear any more, honestly.

2079
01:47:05,117 --> 01:47:07,211
I don't even want to talk to you.

2080
01:47:07,828 --> 01:47:10,081
Harry never really wants to talk to me, either.

2081
01:47:10,164 --> 01:47:12,883
He travels a lot. Like, all year.

2082
01:47:12,958 --> 01:47:15,586
I'm basically just by myself.

2083
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:18,718
I don't want to... I don't feel sorry for you.

2084
01:47:19,882 --> 01:47:21,634
I really liked that original dress

2085
01:47:21,758 --> 01:47:23,476
you picked at the bridal store.

2086
01:47:23,552 --> 01:47:26,476
I thought it was beautiful. You have really lovely taste.

2087
01:47:26,555 --> 01:47:30,025
Thanks, but it's a little too late for that.

2088
01:47:30,184 --> 01:47:31,356
And I know...

2089
01:47:31,435 --> 01:47:34,405
I don't think that Brazilian food
really gave us food poisoning.

2090
01:47:34,479 --> 01:47:35,480
NO, it did.

2091
01:47:35,647 --> 01:47:36,614
No, I don't think it did.

2092
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:38,692
It was the food. I shit my pants on the way home.

2093
01:47:38,775 --> 01:47:40,197
I don't think it was your fault.

2094
01:47:40,736 --> 01:47:42,488
That was my fault.

2095
01:47:43,363 --> 01:47:46,037
I think people just ask me to their weddings

2096
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:48,832
because I'm good at organizing parties.

2097
01:47:50,913 --> 01:47:53,666
I don't have any female friends.

2098
01:47:54,708 --> 01:47:56,210
I'm so sorry.

2099
01:47:56,585 --> 01:47:58,713
Why are you smiling, Annie?

2100
01:47:58,879 --> 01:48:00,552
It's just... It's just...

2101
01:48:00,714 --> 01:48:03,183
It's the first time I've ever seen you look ugly.

2102
01:48:03,342 --> 01:48:05,094
And that makes me kind of happy.

2103
01:48:05,844 --> 01:48:09,223
I look ugly? No, I don't. I don't really look ugly.

2104
01:48:09,306 --> 01:48:11,604
A little bit. You're an ugly crier, but that's okay.

2105
01:48:11,683 --> 01:48:13,401
No, I'm not really an ugly crier.

2106
01:48:13,602 --> 01:48:15,070
Maybe just a little bit. No.

2107
01:48:15,229 --> 01:48:16,572
Just a little bit.

2108
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:19,407
It's just my makeup.

2109
01:48:19,566 --> 01:48:21,614
But I still look pretty good.

2110
01:48:25,197 --> 01:48:26,414
Rhodes!

2111
01:48:27,699 --> 01:48:28,700
Rhodes.

2112
01:48:29,409 --> 01:48:30,706
Rhodes.

2113
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:33,338
Come on! Rhodes!

2114
01:48:33,622 --> 01:48:35,124
He's ignoring you. Let me. Yes, he is.

2115
01:48:35,207 --> 01:48:37,209
- Officer!
- Roll down your window!

2116
01:48:37,376 --> 01:48:40,255
Excuse me! Please!

2117
01:48:41,296 --> 01:48:44,015
Rhodes, I know you can hear me,
and I know you're mad at me,

2118
01:48:44,424 --> 01:48:46,802
but I need your help. Please!

2119
01:48:49,638 --> 01:48:51,311
You know this guy?

2120
01:49:00,482 --> 01:49:01,574
What are you doing?

2121
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:03,277
I just want to get his attention.

2122
01:49:04,569 --> 01:49:06,663
Annie! Oh, my God.

2123
01:49:09,408 --> 01:49:11,206
Reckless driving!

2124
01:49:13,495 --> 01:49:17,250
Annie, my hair! What are you doing?

2125
01:49:17,374 --> 01:49:19,593
I'm speeding! You better pull me over!

2126
01:49:22,754 --> 01:49:23,801
Really?

2127
01:49:23,964 --> 01:49:25,807
Here comes the litter-bug!

2128
01:49:30,304 --> 01:49:32,272
Let's see what Marmaduke's doing.

2129
01:49:32,556 --> 01:49:35,025
Just texting. Talking on the phone while I'm driving.

2130
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:37,603
Not even using my hands. Oh, hi!

2131
01:49:39,688 --> 01:49:40,689
Mmm! Yum! Yum!

2132
01:49:40,897 --> 01:49:42,399
Beer!

2133
01:49:42,524 --> 01:49:43,525
Yum! Yum! Yum!

2134
01:49:44,276 --> 01:49:45,323
Idiot.

2135
01:49:47,654 --> 01:49:49,531
Hey, what's up, man?

2136
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:01,878
I don't care. I don't care.

2137
01:50:07,382 --> 01:50:10,010
I'm going to hurl. I feel really sick, Annie!

2138
01:50:11,762 --> 01:50:14,015
Hey, who's driving that car?

2139
01:50:16,767 --> 01:50:17,814
Can we go up now?

2140
01:50:18,769 --> 01:50:20,646
That's not clever.

2141
01:50:20,979 --> 01:50:22,071
Hey!

2142
01:50:22,147 --> 01:50:23,649
I'm topless!

2143
01:50:24,941 --> 01:50:26,443
I'm totally topless.

2144
01:50:35,994 --> 01:50:37,211
Really?

2145
01:50:39,289 --> 01:50:41,166
Wow. Unbelievable.

2146
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,218
What the fuck are you doing?

2147
01:50:43,377 --> 01:50:44,424
I don't know.

2148
01:50:44,503 --> 01:50:46,050
Hey! Are you crazy?

2149
01:50:46,338 --> 01:50:47,510
Are you crazy?

2150
01:50:47,672 --> 01:50:50,596
All of that stuff, that would have been
dangerous for a good driver.

2151
01:50:50,842 --> 01:50:53,846
I'm sorry. I just... I really need your help.

2152
01:50:54,012 --> 01:50:55,138
We can't find Lillian.

2153
01:50:56,515 --> 01:50:57,767
How long has she been gone?

2154
01:50:57,891 --> 01:50:59,143
She's been missing for 12 hours.

2155
01:50:59,309 --> 01:51:00,561
12 hours?

2156
01:51:00,727 --> 01:51:03,276
It's not a missing person until it's at least 24 hours.

2157
01:51:03,355 --> 01:51:05,574
Have you ever seen CSI? 24 hours.

2158
01:51:06,024 --> 01:51:08,243
Let me get on with my job, Annie.

2159
01:51:08,402 --> 01:51:11,155
Nathan, please?

2160
01:51:11,321 --> 01:51:12,368
I really need your help.

2161
01:51:14,449 --> 01:51:15,746
Please, Nathan.

2162
01:51:16,368 --> 01:51:17,369
Who is this one?

2163
01:51:17,828 --> 01:51:18,875
This is Helen. I'm Helen.

2164
01:51:19,037 --> 01:51:20,209
What?

2165
01:51:20,372 --> 01:51:21,544
It's Helen.

2166
01:51:21,873 --> 01:51:25,878
Hello, Helen. I've heard wonderful things.

2167
01:51:29,047 --> 01:51:32,142
Okay, thanks, buddy. Bye-bye.

2168
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:33,893
Okay, we've traced her cell phone

2169
01:51:34,052 --> 01:51:35,645
to the corner of Craner and Rose.

2170
01:51:36,471 --> 01:51:37,814
Do you know where that is?

2171
01:51:37,889 --> 01:51:39,937
Yes. That is her apartment.

2172
01:51:40,725 --> 01:51:41,897
I thought you said you looked there.

2173
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,107
We did. We did. Last night.

2174
01:51:43,228 --> 01:51:44,275
Okay.

2175
01:51:44,563 --> 01:51:47,316
So you're saying she's at her apartment?
That's what you're telling me?

2176
01:51:47,399 --> 01:51:49,072
She must have gone back after you left.

2177
01:51:49,151 --> 01:51:50,448
God, that was crazy of her.

2178
01:51:50,694 --> 01:51:51,911
Thank God! Thank you. Let's go. Let's go.

2179
01:51:52,028 --> 01:51:53,245
Okay.

2180
01:51:56,700 --> 01:51:58,077
We found her!

2181
01:52:01,872 --> 01:52:04,500
I am so sorry. I didn't mean to waste your time.

2182
01:52:04,583 --> 01:52:06,426
That's embarrassing.

2183
01:52:07,586 --> 01:52:09,509
Thank you. No, you are welcome.

2184
01:52:09,588 --> 01:52:11,590
It's this kind of high-octane stuff

2185
01:52:11,756 --> 01:52:13,758
that really made me want to become a cop.

2186
01:52:14,092 --> 01:52:16,186
"Missing girl found at her apartment."

2187
01:52:16,344 --> 01:52:17,766
It's...

2188
01:52:17,929 --> 01:52:19,931
It's adrenalin-pinching.

2189
01:52:22,434 --> 01:52:23,902
It's nice to see you.

2190
01:52:27,939 --> 01:52:30,738
I'm glad that you got your taillights fixed.

2191
01:52:30,901 --> 01:52:32,824
Means I won't have to stop you again.

2192
01:52:37,741 --> 01:52:38,788
Okay.

2193
01:52:40,494 --> 01:52:42,121
Annie, let's go.

2194
01:52:44,122 --> 01:52:46,250
Anyway, go and save your friend from her apartment.

2195
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:48,127
Bye-bye.

2196
01:52:48,293 --> 01:52:49,636
Bye.

2197
01:53:17,656 --> 01:53:20,330
Do you mind actually if I go by myself?

2198
01:53:21,952 --> 01:53:23,829
Sure. Okay.

2199
01:53:25,038 --> 01:53:26,665
Lil?

2200
01:53:27,832 --> 01:53:29,300
Lillian?

2201
01:53:31,086 --> 01:53:32,087
Lil?

2202
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:33,171
Go away.

2203
01:53:42,138 --> 01:53:43,185
What happened?

2204
01:53:46,184 --> 01:53:49,358
This whole wedding is fucked up.

2205
01:53:49,688 --> 01:53:51,986
Helen just took over everything, and

2206
01:53:54,359 --> 01:53:55,952
everything's got out of control.

2207
01:53:56,027 --> 01:53:58,906
And my dad can't afford the wedding.

2208
01:53:59,864 --> 01:54:03,334
This has been really hard to do without you.

2209
01:54:04,411 --> 01:54:07,335
It's been shitty.

2210
01:54:09,541 --> 01:54:11,168
I'm sorry.

2211
01:54:12,168 --> 01:54:14,045
Nope. I'm sorry.

2212
01:54:14,546 --> 01:54:16,344
I'm sorry I kicked you out of my wedding.

2213
01:54:18,133 --> 01:54:19,225
It's my fault.

2214
01:54:19,301 --> 01:54:20,348
No, it's my fault.

2215
01:54:20,427 --> 01:54:23,351
I think I'm the one with the mental problems.

2216
01:54:23,555 --> 01:54:24,772
Yeah, wasn't it my turn to be crazy?

2217
01:54:24,889 --> 01:54:26,141
The bride's supposed to be crazy.

2218
01:54:26,224 --> 01:54:27,225
Yes, technically.

2219
01:54:27,475 --> 01:54:30,228
You kind of stole all the crazy. I out-crazied you.

2220
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,902
Everything's going to be okay.

2221
01:54:34,149 --> 01:54:36,368
Yeah? How do you know that?

2222
01:54:39,362 --> 01:54:41,911
I left the rehearsal dinner last night.

2223
01:54:42,073 --> 01:54:44,201
I told Dougie I had to go get Q-tips.

2224
01:54:44,367 --> 01:54:45,744
And

2225
01:54:46,828 --> 01:54:49,957
all of a sudden, I realized I was driving here.

2226
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,132
I came here.

2227
01:54:53,835 --> 01:54:58,011
I realized this is the last time I'm going to be here

2228
01:54:58,173 --> 01:54:59,891
in this apartment

2229
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:01,302
with that couch,

2230
01:55:01,676 --> 01:55:02,928
and this bed,

2231
01:55:03,094 --> 01:55:05,017
and take a bath in my bathtub.

2232
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:07,023
Because you know how much I love my bathtub.

2233
01:55:07,265 --> 01:55:08,232
It's a good tub.

2234
01:55:08,350 --> 01:55:10,978
I slept in there on my 30th birthday,
remember? Uh-huh.

2235
01:55:12,062 --> 01:55:13,735
Everything's gonna change.

2236
01:55:15,273 --> 01:55:17,241
I mean, I'm not going to get to

2237
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:19,282
live five minutes away from you.

2238
01:55:22,447 --> 01:55:24,074
And it makes me so sad.

2239
01:55:28,578 --> 01:55:29,579
Well, don't be.

2240
01:55:30,205 --> 01:55:33,175
Don't be sad. Because things are going to change,

2241
01:55:33,249 --> 01:55:36,719
but they'll be better.

2242
01:55:38,421 --> 01:55:39,638
You know?

2243
01:55:40,006 --> 01:55:43,601
You're gonna take this huge, great, beautiful step.

2244
01:55:44,594 --> 01:55:46,892
And Dougie loves you more than anything.

2245
01:55:48,056 --> 01:55:49,228
And so do I.

2246
01:55:53,353 --> 01:55:56,027
But what about you? What's gonna happen to you?

2247
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:04,039
I'm gonna be fine.

2248
01:56:06,491 --> 01:56:09,210
So don't worry, okay? I'm gonna be...

2249
01:56:09,369 --> 01:56:10,996
I'm gonna be fine.

2250
01:56:11,329 --> 01:56:12,876
I am fine.

2251
01:56:16,501 --> 01:56:19,926
And besides, you need to blaze the trail for me.

2252
01:56:20,088 --> 01:56:23,012
And then report back and tell me what's coming.

2253
01:56:23,883 --> 01:56:26,056
Whatever you say, boss.

2254
01:56:28,513 --> 01:56:30,436
All right, let's get your dress on,

2255
01:56:30,557 --> 01:56:32,525
okay, and let's go to your wedding.

2256
01:56:34,185 --> 01:56:35,778
Oh, yeah.

2257
01:56:36,646 --> 01:56:38,023
That's the other problem.

2258
01:56:48,450 --> 01:56:52,546
Don't you dare laugh.

2259
01:57:00,462 --> 01:57:01,509
Okay.

2260
01:57:01,588 --> 01:57:03,807
I cannot wear this dress!

2261
01:57:04,048 --> 01:57:05,550
Okay, don't panic.

2262
01:57:06,718 --> 01:57:08,220
This is a nightmare.

2263
01:57:09,053 --> 01:57:10,600
We'll fix it.

2264
01:57:10,889 --> 01:57:12,436
We'll tweak it.

2265
01:57:13,099 --> 01:57:14,646
I will not let you walk down that aisle

2266
01:57:14,726 --> 01:57:16,603
unless you look perfect and beautiful, I promise.

2267
01:57:16,895 --> 01:57:20,069
Do you have a chainsaw and a blowtorch?

2268
01:57:22,859 --> 01:57:25,157
I think this wedding is gonna be a disaster.

2269
01:57:25,236 --> 01:57:26,328
No, don't say that.

2270
01:57:26,696 --> 01:57:28,664
If Helen had anything to do with this wedding,

2271
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:32,335
it is going to be perfect and tasteful and beautiful.

2272
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:33,411
That's true.

2273
01:57:34,496 --> 01:57:37,249
Will you, Douglas, take Lillian to be your wife?

2274
01:57:37,457 --> 01:57:40,427
Will you love her, comfort her, and keep her

2275
01:57:40,585 --> 01:57:43,509
and, forsaking all others, remain true to her

2276
01:57:43,588 --> 01:57:45,590
as long as you both shall live?

2277
01:57:45,673 --> 01:57:46,720
I do.

2278
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:49,599
And will you, Lillian, take Douglas to be your husband?

2279
01:57:49,677 --> 01:57:52,021
Will you love him, comfort him, and keep him

2280
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:53,477
as long as you both shall live?

2281
01:57:54,766 --> 01:57:56,109
I do.

2282
01:57:57,936 --> 01:58:00,109
By the powers vested in me by the state of Illinois,

2283
01:58:00,355 --> 01:58:02,107
I pronounce you husband and wife.

2284
01:58:02,357 --> 01:58:03,449
You may now kiss the bride.

2285
01:58:14,327 --> 01:58:15,874
Ladies and gentlemen,

2286
01:58:15,954 --> 01:58:20,380
here with us tonight is Lillian's favorite
band singing her favorite song.

2287
01:58:20,542 --> 01:58:24,797
Put your hands together for Wilson Phillips!

2288
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:30,051
Hi, everybody!

2289
01:58:32,554 --> 01:58:33,806
How we doing tonight?

2290
01:58:34,347 --> 01:58:36,315
I am not paying for this shit.

2291
01:58:38,393 --> 01:58:39,645
Really?

2292
01:58:41,312 --> 01:58:42,689
It's the last one, I promise.

2293
01:58:42,772 --> 01:58:44,490
The last one. The last one.

2294
01:58:45,149 --> 01:58:48,073
I know this pain

2295
01:58:49,404 --> 01:58:53,500
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains?

2296
01:58:55,326 --> 01:58:58,626
No one can change your life except for you

2297
01:58:59,914 --> 01:59:04,340
Don't ever let anyone step all over you

2298
01:59:04,836 --> 01:59:08,466
Just open your heart and your mind

2299
01:59:10,008 --> 01:59:12,852
ls it really fair to feel

2300
01:59:13,553 --> 01:59:15,430
This way inside

2301
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:19,852
Someday somebody's gonna make you

2302
01:59:20,018 --> 01:59:22,271
want to turn around and say goodbye

2303
01:59:22,353 --> 01:59:24,355
Until then, baby, are you going to let them

2304
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,448
hold you down and make you cry?

2305
01:59:26,524 --> 01:59:27,525
Don't you know

2306
01:59:27,692 --> 01:59:29,365
Don't you know things can change

2307
01:59:29,527 --> 01:59:30,699
Things'll go your way

2308
01:59:31,070 --> 01:59:35,120
if you hold on for one more day

2309
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:40,547
Can you hold on for one more day?

2310
01:59:40,705 --> 01:59:44,050
Things'll go your way

2311
01:59:44,375 --> 01:59:47,094
Hold on for one more day

2312
01:59:56,387 --> 01:59:59,061
You could sustain

2313
02:00:00,391 --> 02:00:04,066
Or are you comfortable with the pain?

2314
02:00:05,563 --> 02:00:10,069
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness

2315
02:00:10,234 --> 02:00:11,201
No, baby

2316
02:00:11,277 --> 02:00:14,577
You got yourself into your own mess

2317
02:00:15,907 --> 02:00:19,787
Letting your worries pass you by

2318
02:00:19,953 --> 02:00:21,205
Baby

2319
02:00:21,371 --> 02:00:26,753
Don't you think it's worth your
time to change your mind?

2320
02:00:26,918 --> 02:00:28,261
No, no

2321
02:00:28,419 --> 02:00:30,592
Someday somebody's gonna make you

2322
02:00:30,755 --> 02:00:31,881
want to turn around and say goodbye

2323
02:00:33,091 --> 02:00:34,513
Until then, baby, are you going to let them

2324
02:00:34,634 --> 02:00:36,102
hold you down and make you cry?

2325
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:38,262
What's so funny?

2326
02:00:39,222 --> 02:00:42,943
I put a loaded gun in Dougie's carry-on.

2327
02:00:43,768 --> 02:00:47,648
The TSA is going to just rip his ass apart.

2328
02:00:51,484 --> 02:00:52,485
Annie?

2329
02:00:54,153 --> 02:00:55,154
Oh. Hey.

2330
02:00:58,616 --> 02:01:00,584
Did you have a nice evening?

2331
02:01:00,743 --> 02:01:02,745
It was beautiful. Yeah.

2332
02:01:02,996 --> 02:01:05,124
What did you think of the wedding?

2333
02:01:06,082 --> 02:01:07,504
It was...

2334
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:08,626
It was great.

2335
02:01:08,793 --> 02:01:09,919
It was great, right? Yeah.

2336
02:01:10,128 --> 02:01:11,300
It was perfect.

2337
02:01:11,963 --> 02:01:13,215
It was great.

2338
02:01:13,339 --> 02:01:14,636
Yeah, it was great.

2339
02:01:18,136 --> 02:01:20,104
It was really nice meeting you.

2340
02:01:21,014 --> 02:01:22,687
Yeah, it was...

2341
02:01:22,849 --> 02:01:25,523
Helen, it was really nice meeting you, too.

2342
02:01:29,605 --> 02:01:31,232
Hey, you know, maybe

2343
02:01:31,315 --> 02:01:34,990
sometime the three of us could
go to Rockin' Sushi together.

2344
02:01:36,779 --> 02:01:39,658
Thank you, Annie.

2345
02:01:39,824 --> 02:01:41,497
I would love that.

2346
02:01:47,874 --> 02:01:49,842
Your ride is here.

2347
02:02:06,225 --> 02:02:08,193
Hey, how did everything go?

2348
02:02:10,396 --> 02:02:11,488
Strangely well.

2349
02:02:11,606 --> 02:02:12,698
Good.

2350
02:02:15,693 --> 02:02:17,320
So, I ate your cake

2351
02:02:18,321 --> 02:02:19,743
that you left.

2352
02:02:19,864 --> 02:02:20,865
You did? Yeah.

2353
02:02:21,074 --> 02:02:22,291
I mean, I had to fight some raccoons off.

2354
02:02:23,326 --> 02:02:25,545
But that's okay. I'm pretty strong and tough,

2355
02:02:25,661 --> 02:02:27,880
so it wasn't much of a contest.

2356
02:02:28,039 --> 02:02:29,131
So that might have been...

2357
02:02:29,207 --> 02:02:30,550
I'm just going to kiss you now rather than just...

2358
02:02:43,554 --> 02:02:44,931
Officer Rhodes, please report to...

2359
02:02:45,014 --> 02:02:46,015
Oh! I'm on duty.

2360
02:02:46,849 --> 02:02:48,476
And I need to put my uniform on.

2361
02:02:48,559 --> 02:02:50,482
If I drive like this, they're gonna
think I just stole a car,

2362
02:02:50,561 --> 02:02:51,733
which wouldn't be great.

2363
02:02:53,022 --> 02:02:55,400
You could ride with me if you want.

2364
02:02:55,566 --> 02:02:57,534
You want to come? Yeah, I do.

2365
02:02:57,735 --> 02:02:58,782
Come on.

2366
02:02:58,861 --> 02:02:59,862
All right.

2367
02:03:00,029 --> 02:03:01,076
Whoa! Whoa! Where are you going?

2368
02:03:01,197 --> 02:03:02,244
I'm getting in the car.

2369
02:03:02,323 --> 02:03:03,996
No, no, no, you got to get in the back. What?

2370
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:06,331
You can't sit in the front, it's against regulations.

2371
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:08,504
Come on. Come on.

2372
02:03:08,663 --> 02:03:10,381
You're going to make me sit in the back seat?

2373
02:03:10,581 --> 02:03:11,833
Yeah, come on.

2374
02:03:11,916 --> 02:03:13,008
Sorry. Habit.

2375
02:03:13,334 --> 02:03:14,586
All right.

2376
02:03:14,710 --> 02:03:15,927
It's a force of habit.

2377
02:03:19,715 --> 02:03:21,092
Can I please get in the front seat?

2378
02:03:21,259 --> 02:03:24,263
Actually, no, I'm afraid there's
a warrant out for your arrest.

2379
02:03:24,428 --> 02:03:26,101
What? why?

2380
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:28,854
Reckless driving, littering, texting,

2381
02:03:29,016 --> 02:03:30,939
consuming alcohol while operating a vehicle.

2382
02:03:31,102 --> 02:03:32,149
You didn't think I was going to

2383
02:03:32,228 --> 02:03:33,821
let you get away with that, did you?

2384
02:03:34,605 --> 02:03:36,858
Could we put the siren on? Please?

2385
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:40,737
Thank you.

2386
02:03:42,697 --> 02:03:44,620
I know that there is pain

2387
02:03:44,699 --> 02:03:47,077
But you hold on for one more day

2388
02:03:47,243 --> 02:03:50,793
And you break free from the chains

2389
02:03:52,123 --> 02:03:54,797
Yeah, I know that there is pain

2390
02:03:54,959 --> 02:03:56,927
But you hold on for one more day

2391
02:03:57,086 --> 02:04:00,135
And you break free, break from the chains

2392
02:04:02,383 --> 02:04:04,636
Someday somebody's gonna make you

2393
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:06,979
want to turn around and say goodbye

2394
02:04:07,138 --> 02:04:09,140
Until then, baby, are you going to let them

2395
02:04:09,265 --> 02:04:11,233
hold you down and make you cry?

2396
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,393
Don't you know

2397
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,812
Don't you know things can change

2398
02:04:13,978 --> 02:04:15,821
Things'll go your way

2399
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:18,324
if you hold on

2400
02:04:19,817 --> 02:04:21,114
Okay. Umm...

2401
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:25,620
This is Tape 119.

2402
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:29,585
Air Marshall Jon and I's first sexual encounter.

2403
02:04:29,952 --> 02:04:31,329
Is there a hungry bear anywhere?

2404
02:04:31,454 --> 02:04:32,831
I'm a hungry bear.

2405
02:04:32,997 --> 02:04:35,125
I just happen to have this bear sandwich.

2406
02:04:35,291 --> 02:04:36,417
Is there a hungry bear?

2407
02:04:36,542 --> 02:04:37,668
I'm a very hungry bear.

2408
02:04:37,835 --> 02:04:39,508
Did you see how my flap opens?

2409
02:04:39,670 --> 02:04:42,594
Yeah, that's a good-looking bear sandwich.

2410
02:04:42,673 --> 02:04:44,346
Yeah, that's a big bear sandwich.

2411
02:04:44,508 --> 02:04:46,681
Do you want a bite of that sandwich? Feed me.

2412
02:04:46,844 --> 02:04:47,891
It's meat and cheeses.

2413
02:04:50,973 --> 02:04:52,020
Uh-Oh.

2414
02:04:52,099 --> 02:04:56,275
I hope you don't have a salad. Oh, yeah.

2415
02:04:57,772 --> 02:04:59,570
Hey, guess what. Guess what, ham.

2416
02:04:59,649 --> 02:05:00,650
Fuck it up.

2417
02:05:00,733 --> 02:05:01,950
I'm gonna fuck you up, ham nipple.

2418
02:05:02,026 --> 02:05:03,278
Ham nipple. Fuck it up.

2419
02:05:04,612 --> 02:05:06,034
A little hard.

2420
02:05:06,239 --> 02:05:07,240
OW!

2421
02:05:07,323 --> 02:05:09,371
A little hard. A little hard.
