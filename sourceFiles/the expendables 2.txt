- When you come back?
- Maybe soon, maybe never.

99
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:11,510
Maybe trying a different lifestyle.

100
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,150
- And I stopped taking me for who?
- You'll find yourself another minority.

101
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:19,070
Yang! Smiles.

102
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,590
Goodbye!

Go!

104
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,670

- Let's go! I miss home.
- They did.

106
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,910
Yes! I love this song!

107
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,230
Christmas, my friend, tell me
I will not have it go to the end.

108
00:15:06,265 --> 00:15:08,350
Sure doing to end.
Look at her!

109
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:11,310
- Who would take her to wife?
- She was wrong.

110
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,510
- I was wrong to halfway.
- What does that mean?

111
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,390
It's the other half of the truth.
I'm lucky.

112
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,470
Lucky? Did I hate to say this,

113
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,510
but the girlfriend of yours inherited
strong gene infidelity.

114
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,670
- You should stick to tell you cuþitu-hearts!
- Too late.

115
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,270
Cheers

116
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,950
I used to think that you have a spade,
but up and black is a color too vivid.

117
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,110
- Hey, baby!

118
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,150

Promise next time
no longer reþii to the so much my boyfriend?

00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:45,390
Would break my heart to do it.

121
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,070
The'd have a heart.

122
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,230
Look who got lost in space.

123
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,470
Do you have a pen?

124
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,830
And you have a
that does not have skulls on it?

125
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:05,430
Even I have nothing.

126
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,750
Relativitãþii theory restricted
Einstein's.

127
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,110
But we improved it.

128
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,470
Can you believe it or not,
Before becoming unstable,

129
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:33,870
Gunner was coordinator of the master
in chemical engineering at MIT.

130
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,190
That means you had brains.
Can you believe?

131
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:38,350
- So what happened?
- He left to be a club bouncer.

132
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:41,430
To be closer
one who danced there.

133
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,390
I can not believe you left.

134
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,870
- You did not you have left?
- Yes!

135
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,950

- Of course. Let's go!

136
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,470
- How say?
- Better get to the point.

137
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,790
I feel...

138
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,190
Not know how I feel.

139
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,590
Life's not you, is not it?

140
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,430
I thought that's

141
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,830
You gave me the chance to be part of your team
and always respect you for that.

142
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,030
And you have my respect.

143
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,670
What are you gonna do?

144
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,790
I want to leave the market.
I'm going to meet my girlfriend.

145
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,510
- Where is it?
- E franþuzoaicã.

146
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,190
When-Did believe it, we met
in Afghanistan. Was an assistant.

147
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,150
- It's sometimes handy.
- Yes. Did they like her.

148
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,790
It's the kind of person
for you do anything.

149
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,110
I accepted this job
because it pays well.

150
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,470
That would allow me to offer all worth it.

151
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:58,070
It's a relationship that makes me feel good.

152
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,470
When you're with someone and you know
Think before you say it.

153
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,470
Have you ever had that kind of relationship?

154
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,510
Yes.

155
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,670
- I do not wanna think a deserter.
- No!

156
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,110
If I be your age now,
and to do the same as you.

157
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,030
Go and more Get your beer.

158
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,350
All right.

159
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,190
Barney Ross!

160
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,630
What do you want from me, Church?

161
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,990
Not really sit well with memory, is not it?

162
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,990
We had a deal.
You gave me your word.

163
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,310
Instead, you get to blow
half the country

164
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,630
and to make shooting range
a CIA agent of mine.

165
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:43,310
Never mind that he was a bastard.

166
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,270
But what hurts me the worst is
that you stole $ 5 million.

167
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,870
And for those escapades

168
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:57,230
I could throw you into the dark
cell at Guantanamo.

169
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,710
Any bit of light!

170
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,590
- But I left open.
- Super!

171
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,950
Because I knew that the day will come
when you Revan and a

172
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,070
- Today is the day.
- Continue to talk.

173
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,790
Chinese airplane collapsed in the mountains,
close to a ravine called Gazac.

174
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:18,990
- Whose was the plane?
- Guess fish.

175
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,710
The aircraft is a safe

Everything you need to know is that we can not leave
crash into the wrong hands.

177
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:32,630

That's high-tech safe.
Password changes every two minutes.

181
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:46,390
If your password uses the wrong direction,
salt in the air.

182
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:49,350
- You'll have to tell you we give...
- Wait! Why are you talking in plural?

183
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:51,230
- Who are you working?
- None of your business.

184
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,310
They call the host company.

185
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,230
A sending an agent to get your professional

186
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:01,590
- Her name is Maggie Chan.
- A woman!

187
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,950
Usually a woman named Maggie's.

188
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:07,270
- Forget it!
- He knows you, and take care of themselves.

189
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:09,110
But one thing is clear.

190
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,310
If anything happens to him,
if it hung,

191
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:14,750
if you are hurting, if they talk ugly,

192
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:17,750
if it does not return to the same state
the left,

193
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,790
you and your gang psihopaþi
You will disappear from the face of the planet.

194
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,630
That can promise to tell you.

195
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,950
I'm not a very good babysitter.

196
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,430
Do not be so sure.

197
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,070
You will be a very good babysitter!

198
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,670
Be there at 19:00.

199
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,950
Hi! I'm Maggie Chan.

200
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,070
- You're Barnie Ross?
- Yes.

201
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:36,350
- Did Mr. Church told me?
- He said that you're aces to us.

202
00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:38,550
To help, not to assist.

203
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,190
Nice bike!

204
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,750
We do not know what we are waiting
where we're going.

205
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,470
It's custom made?

206
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,830
- It would be a mistake to come and you.
- You built it yourself?

207
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,550
Yes, I have built.
Play with me, Maggie?

208
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,350
No. But you play with me?

209
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,510
Church told me what you said.
Are capable of fighting.

210
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,510
I need nannies.

211
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,110
- What time gone?
- 05:00.

212
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,070
I was nice to meet you.

213
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,230
GAZAK Mountains, ALBANIA

214
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,670
- I'm like.
- I hate you.

215
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,630
Be careful.

216
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,070
If anything happens to him,
we are responsible.

217
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,150
You thought to yourself consulþi and I?

218
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,590
Did I say ten times,
I had no choice!

219
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,710
- Or are you in jail?
- He intimidated Church.

220
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,030
- Really?
- Yes.

221
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,510
And she calls you
that you can not trust?

222
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,510
A knife in the sink to get your heart someday!

223
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,510
Hello, my dear!

224
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,270
Sure I think about you.

225
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,310
What else to think about?

226
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,750
Are you without hope.

227
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,710
Have you served in the military, right?
I figured it out.

228
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:17,910
Yes, ma'am. For three years.
Last time I was in Afghanistan.

229
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,030
- And do not you also love the army?
- It's a long story.

230
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,150
He'd like to hear it.

231
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,230
All right.

232
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,910
I was trained to be
and sniper instructor,

233
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:34,310
But I wanted to mix them,
to have part of the action.

234
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,270
Once I stayed block
in a valley infection.

235
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,870
Went out about 30 Taliban
houses on hills.

236
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,830
We încolþiserã good on eight of us.

237
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:48,430
I called for help,
but the captain never wanted to hear.

238
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,870
He did not want to put them natives in danger.
So do we scattered.

239
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,230
Some were dragged through the anþuri, some went
the riverbeds and the rest fled.

240
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,190
But everything in the attack was.

241
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,190
We stayed there for about three hours.

242
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,830
Until, finally, came
a helicopter to get us out of there.

243
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,110
I drove the Taliban...

244
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,230
When he went dust, I saw
that four of my team

245
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:17,470
were dead in ditch,
and two lay on the river bed.

246
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,910
I was angry and disgusted.
All died in vain.

247
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,670
And most miserable thing of all

248
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:39,550
is that when I returned to base,
I learned that my cashier shot

249
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:42,070
stray dog? ?that we adopted.

250
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,990
The commander gave the order to eliminate
all animals in the base.

251
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,630
I had come atâþia dead for a day.

252
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,790
Was time to move on.

253
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,390
I heard that this gang looking people
and here I am.

254
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,190
- Find out location?
- Yes. Apparently it's 15 km N-V.

255
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,550
All right.

256
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,110
"Hi, honey!"

257
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,430
Hello, my dear!

258
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,910
I'm a little busy...

259
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,590
The next move is to get out of here.
The sooner the better.

260
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,510
- Few know 'Bill!
- Yes!

261
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:48,950
This is your lucky day.
We let you drive.

262
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,910
With pleasure, sir!

263
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,990
Impressive!

264
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,430
Wait a second.

265
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,230
- Do you think anyone could do that?
- No. The so you think?

266
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:13,030
- A and flee if they needed.
- Really? Look down.

267
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,670
Look down. See what I see and I?
Short legs.

268
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:21,630
I'll bet you a thousand dollars that he does not catch.
Come on, Flash!

269
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,150
- I'm a little busy.
- Really?

270
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,590
We reached the top of the hill, sir.

271
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,470
Slow down, Billy!
Make us look bad.

272
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:49,110
- Repeats. Finished!
- You heard me.

273
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,470
Receive. Go slowly.

274
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,870
Do you thank.

275
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,030
- The rest of the plane is over the hill.
- Well done, Billy!

276
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,910
Looks like someone had a bad day.

277
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,270
Sure you hand over the right.

278
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,470
Are like crows.

279
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:36,070
Put yourself in a great up there.

280
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:44,670
Fur is in hand.
He was alive when he arrived at Wolves.

281
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,350
Be careful!

282
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,190
That's it?

283
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,670
Yes, I found you need.

284
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,870
Caesar! I need you here!

285
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:26,430
Grab it and pull towards you.
Lee put the hook.

286
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,910
When I count three, shoot him.

287
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,510
Ready?

288
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,190
1, 2, 3!

289
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,350
- We can not keeps the so!
- You!

290
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,630

291
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,990
Faster, Maggie!

292
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,790
Protocol error

293
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:58,630
- Something is wrong!
- What happened?

294
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:00,830
- They triggered the bomb.
- How long do we have?

295
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,110
- 54 seconds.
- If we leave now, we can escape.

296
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,630
- Maggie, forget it!
- I got it.

297
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,990
- Take it!
- What's going on?

298
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,030
A bomb triggered. There apropiaþi you!

299
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,190
I slipped my arm!

300
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,190
Reintroduction CODE

301
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:24,190
If you let go, cut it in two.

302
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,190
- Forget it!
- I got it!

303
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,430
- You have luck that I was here.
- That's what I was thinking and I now.

304
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:40,310
I'm sorry. It was very important
to take the package.

305
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:43,870
You have guts. You have no common sense,
but you have guts.

306
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:47,430
Go! I took the package. Let's go!

307
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,270
You're strong!

308
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,510
Billy! Get out. Leave.

309
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,870
What happened?

310
00:31:54,905 --> 00:31:57,030
That woman is crazy,
but well I'm strong.

311
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,990
- Are not you curious what's in the package?
- No. I just want to get rid of the Church.

312
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,350
Few know 'Billy! Where the hell is it?

313
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,310
Billy!

314
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,710
- Leave the guns down!
- No way!

315
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,230
You have to see!

316
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,390
Not?

317
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,710
Are you sure?

318
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,870
I'm sorry, sir. We expect.

319
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,830
- Leave the guns down!
- Do not listen!

320
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,590
It's a powerful soldier. Let's test it.

321
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,350
Do it!

322
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,750
No!

323
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,910
Do not do anything you ask.

324
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,710
Do not talk!

325
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,350
- You're not allowed to talk.
- I'll kill him!

326
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,030
When I pulled the trigger,
I'll be nothing left of his head.

327
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,550
In three seconds.

328
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,070
Do not dispose of your weapons.
I owe you are nothing.

329
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,350
1...

330
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,070
... 2...

331
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,070
Do not dispose of weapons.
I'll kill them all!

332
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,430
'll Kill him.

333
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,550
And... the three seconds!

334
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,990
Dispose of weapons!

335
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,870
I'm impressed.
Did you use very good brain.

336
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:00,510
Everyone remain calm.
Immediately terminate and go.

337
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,870
Bring me the knife guy.

338
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,550
What is this symbol?

339
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,790
I love symbols.

340
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,430
This is the symbol of the goat.

341
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,510
Satan pet.

342
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,510
That's how it is said.

343
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,750
- You have a package that belongs to me.
- Will Do you belong?

344
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:41,190
- I belong. And as your lives.
- Has been lost. He has the package.

345
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,590
This is the last chance to give to my package.

346
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,990
If not, I force the...

347
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,910
... To cut it.

348
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,710
A heart to remove them.

349
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,230
What are you waiting for, bitch?

350
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,590
Hold on!

351
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,430
Give it to me.

352
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,630
- You want to tell me something?
- Lift it!

353
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:32,150
- Come and gives it to me.
- Get your own it.

354
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:33,910
- What did you say?
- You heard it right.

355
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,310
Pick it up and gives it to me slowly!

356
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,070
If not, have the same fate as him.

357
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,070
Listen to Lee.

358
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,750
It will be good, Billy!

359
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,510
Respect is the most important.

360
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:17,110
Out of respect, we are not only
some people along.

361
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,990
I'm sorry, sir!

362
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,310
It's not your fault.

363
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,190
- Now what?
- We're both fighters.

364
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,390
Respect thing.

365
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,910
Fighters not worth
Banal death.

366
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,950
But...

367
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,150
You must learn...
It means respect.

368
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:56,710
Sit on your stomach before you leave!

369
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,190
Not induce me!

370
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,790
Down!

371
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,070
Lift it!

372
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,270
- Did afraid of me?
- No! I'm not afraid!

373
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,110
To tell you should be!

374
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,750
- I'll die!
- Do not talk, Billy!

375
00:37:56,785 --> 00:38:01,190
- Cut off his pants!
- Letter of pocket.

376
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,270
I found it, kid. I found it.

377
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,150
- I'm so sorry!
- I believe.

378
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,870
What was in the package?

379
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,910
A computer... Plans to me.

380
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,030
Plans to me? What mine?

381
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,230
Russians have stored there almost
five tonnes of plutonium-based weapons.

382
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:08,070
Mine was abandoned after the Cold War.
No one knows it's there.

383
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:11,310
Plans shows the locations of plutonium.

384
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,390
I wanted to take the plans,
do not reach the wrong hands.

385
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:16,910
But not much successful.

386
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,070
This child died
for a Taliban-and to make bombs.

387
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,110
I'm so sorry.

388
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,430
Not just me how much I hurt.

389
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,910
Let's arrange it.

390
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,470
Dear Sofia,

391
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:49,310
I'd like to find something else to do,
than to tell you I miss, but I can not.

392
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,030
Ga and that treats me well.

393
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,150
Protect us from each other.

394
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,390
I want you to know that, wherever and reach
Do you wish you all the best.

395
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,870
If, by some miracle,
I'll be back,

396
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,190
I hope your husband stay.
With much love, Billy.

397
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:17,230
How is it that one of us dies
wants and deserves most to live,

398
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,590
and those who deserve to die
continue to live?

399
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,750
Understanding what of it?

400
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,870
- What is our plan?
- We seek, we find and kill them!

401
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,830
<i> We excuse, control tower here.
Raportaþi immediately. &lt;/ I&gt;

402
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:15,510
Here Bozo the Clown.

403
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,110
<i> This is a secure line.
Receive &lt;/ i&gt;

404
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:20,590
What's this about?

405
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,350
What takes the so much Barney Ross?
Should be a breeze for you.

406
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:28,270
- Where's the package?
- I have.

407
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,910
I warned you what will happen
if you doin me like that.

408
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,950
An honest man died
trying to take the package.

409
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,150
I'm sorry.

410
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:39,550
- Really?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

411
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:43,790
- But that's the risk trade.
- So is and revenge.

412
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,950
Church, you're the kind of person who puts
on others to do the dirty work,

413
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:54,470
because you did not have the guts to do it.
I'm done with you!

414
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,910
Sir, we have a problem.

415
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:27,470
Excavations have slowed.
Too many have died from exhaustion.

416
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,230
A tired.

417
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:41,070
Anyone else tired?

418
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,550
- Bring more people.
- I already got most of the villagers.

419
00:42:47,585 --> 00:42:52,190
Take and rest. Women, children...
-Take them all!

420
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,950
Show me!

421
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,230
Now we know where he is

422
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,550
Okay, I know what to do.

423
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:21,230
Excellent! I plutonium
ready in 3 days.

424
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,990
In 3 days?

425
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:28,670
We humans
I prepared to pay.

426
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:33,470
So... 3 days, so.
Got it?

427
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,950
They go mind!

428
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:38,950
And I realized that 3 kg of plutonium
are strong enough

429
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:42,190
to tilt in their favor
balance of power in the world.

430
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,510
Did Imagine what would happen
5 tonnes. It's very interesting.

431
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,190
- Something happens!
- What?

432
00:43:57,225 --> 00:43:59,110
Transmission has been interrupted!
I am underground.

433
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:00,790
Lands here!

434
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,670
Come on, grãbiþi it!

435
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,230
Lee, what the hell?
You know what you doing?

436
00:44:13,265 --> 00:44:15,790
Let me five minutes!
Do not rush so much.

437
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,110
Still a truck.
Could be theirs.

438
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,390
Let's see what's here.

439
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,110
- With such a thing go?
- The "classics"?

440
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,190
Good...

441
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:49,070
Only expect to use them.

442
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,870
I'll bundles in direct
Until we remove the truth from them.

443
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,750
Maggie, tell them boys
to wait in the truck.

444
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,430
All right.

445
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,470
- I'm here.
- Yes.

446
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,070
You talk English?

447
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,910
- This guy is huge.
- And?

448
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:36,270
And I thought of the A...

449
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,670
- How big are you...
- That's what I told you!

450
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,310
I like the classics...

451
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,950
Let's find out what we want from them
and to our way.

452
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,150
- I did not mind.
- Let's start with the dwarf.

453
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:06,830
Calmaþi sure, guys.

454
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:10,270
I make them to speak
without much "hassle".

455
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:14,830
Are you going
Let's do a pedicure?

456
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,470
I get sick...

457
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,430
I want to switch on your truck
and to go after guns.

458
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:25,310
- Put it on one of idioþii that!
- Do not cry!

459
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,350
I had to tell you have put you too
one to n miller!

460
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:29,630
How's it going?
Okay, let's get out of here.

461
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:39,230
Q and Sangvinii say.
Controls all the East.

462
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:43,910
Robberies, kidnappings, assassinations... In fact,
are a cartel for rent.

463
00:46:43,945 --> 00:46:47,310
- How do you know English?
- It's easy. I learned one.

464
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,790
It's a mix between Bulgarian dialect
and the Ukraine.

465
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:55,150
- Are you impressed?
- A little...

466
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,110
- Christmas?
- What?

467
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,550
Why yelled?

468
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,710
Cause you gave me a job to
all shit.

469
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,950
You shoot when you see that in front.

470
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,630
- Where are you?
- La Cuca Mãcãii? ?after weapons!

471
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,510
Why does it take the so much?

472
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,070
Cause bridge is destroyed,
There are no signs,

473
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,110
and I spun in circles
about 7 hours!

474
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,110
- You cry more?
- Thanks for understanding.

475
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:44,190
- It's weird here.
- It's like home.

476
00:47:44,225 --> 00:47:46,670
Normal...

477
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:52,670
- What the hell is this place?
- I think it's a former Soviet base.

478
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,950
It was used in the 80s,
the Cold War.

479
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,190
Perhaps here have prepared attacks
against Americans.

480
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,990
It's something you do not know?

481
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,270
Great, just the something like
needed. Pizza 50 years old.

482
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,910
Stay here tonight.

483
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:43,470
It tastes horrible.
Yours like?

484
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:50,310
Rigatonnni are nemaipomeniþi.
Think of you before, as I said.

485
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:55,070
If you know that you will die tomorrow,
that would be the last meal?

486
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,070
- A single choice!
- A single choice?

487
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:00,150
- Perhaps you choose cereals.
- And what's wrong with that?

488
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,070
- It's too trivial.
- You have to be original.

489
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:08,190
If you have the original, you invent
you some more special grain.

490
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:10,190
Some ear shaped...

491
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:13,430
Pour milk in them
and not hear anything.

492
00:49:13,465 --> 00:49:17,750
If you want to know,
My hearing is just fine.

493
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,790
- Barney?
- Gogo and or kill you.

494
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,750
- You're very deep, bro...
- The so think?

495
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,910
Maggie?

496
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:33,950
Crispy duck flavor
and plum sauce. Very sexy...

497
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,270
But I love Italian food and.

498
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,410
Good night!

499
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,490
Good night, Maggie.

500
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:20,690
I swear that shot him c
If more than snoring.

501
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:22,970
Gunner!

502
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,090
Did you cry?

503
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,810
I know it's a stupid question...
you have little remaining coffee?

504
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,450
- I made only a cup.
- I thought so.

505
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,650
Listen!

506
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,690
That guy said he Sangvinii
are concentration in the east.

507
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:48,050
There you go.

508
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:51,370
We meet here in 10 minutes.
Prepare yourself!

509
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,090
Houston, we have a problem!

510
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,210
Down!

511
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,210
You must get out of here!

512
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,290
Come!

513
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,450
Not move it!

514
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,050
Now!

515
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,490
Keep ammunition Did!

516
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:48,930
- Where the hell are you?
- Soon enough.

517
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,050
What's that? Pull?

518
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,170
Yes!

519
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,810
- What's going on?
- Sangvinii we found.

520
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:00,290
- I can cope?
- Yes, with a tank.

521
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,370
- Damn!
- What is it?

522
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,570
They have a tank.

523
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,210
Go!

524
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:18,810
Let's go!

525
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,690
I do not have the cartridge's

526
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,810
What the...

527
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:49,490
- Who did this?
- I do not. I ran out of bullets.

528
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,050
What happened?

529
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,650
- Someone pretty far exceeded...
- That's how it seems.

530
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:06,370
Where are the shooters?

531
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:10,530
I do not know, but if they wanted us dead,
I was already dead.

532
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:13,490
Barney...

533
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:30,330
Do not lose your cool!

534
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:41,290
- It's a small world, is not she, Barney?
- Booker?

535
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:44,890
- It was rumored that you were dead.
- Yes, and I heard.

536
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:47,850
- How are you?
- Bini lightly...

537
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,090
Did you do this?

538
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,130
I am on my own,
I thought you knew.

539
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:55,730
- I heard, but I doubt it.
- Now I do.

540
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:58,570
- That's your team?
- Yes.

541
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:02,690
Gunner, Toll Road,
Hail Caesar and Maggie.

542
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,650
Booker, Thiele Did they say
Lone Wolf?

543
00:56:06,685 --> 00:56:10,130
I was told and so,
But I quiet.

544
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:16,170
Not much...

545
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:20,530
I heard that you were bite as
by Cobra Regal.

546
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:24,490
Yes, but after 5 days
agonizing pain...

547
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:27,690
... cobra died.

548
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:36,410
Booker, I'm glad to see you.

549
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,610
How do you get
in this place forgotten by the world?

550
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,330
I was atacaþi of blood
100 km east of where we are now.

551
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:44,370
- I killed a man...
- I'm sorry.

552
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:48,530
Sangvinii are you some true garbage.
I'm sorry I shot.

553
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:51,570
- You know who is their leader?
- Yes, one named Vilain.

554
00:56:51,605 --> 00:56:54,290
He controls everything in this area.

555
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,970
You need more people
if you want to escape with his life.

556
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:00,890
- I'm you can help?
- I'm sorry, I work alone.

557
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:04,170
- I understand. Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome.

558
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:11,090
Barney!

559
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:14,930
Below is a village. There are good people
and I hate blood.

560
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:17,330
- Can you help them.
- Thanks!

561
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,490
Happy hunting!

562
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,610
- What happened?
- Still alive.

563
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,810
E and this a view.
What have I missed?

564
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,650
I'll tell you on the way.
Come and download weapons.

565
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:38,290
- A little late with gifts...
- And I love you.

566
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,450
- Nice to see you.
- Finally, someone with class.

567
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,650
I think that
Booker is speaking village.

568
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:56,290
I would like to live
in a place like this.

569
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,770
Fresh air, no stress,
Do you you can increase the children...

570
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,090
Maggie, I could retire to the
in a place like this.

571
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,010
What bullshit cheap...

572
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:20,130
Ã knew not know at all to shoot.

573
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:23,290
- Dispose of weapons!
- No way!

574
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,530
Safest place
is in front of that fire weapons.

575
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:31,370
- I will shoot about!
- No! A wait!

576
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:35,010
We're here to help.

577
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,970
Even you two rataþilor,
did you find a chick here.

578
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,530
- I do not think...
- Încetaþi!

579
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,050
- Who are you?
- We are Americans.

580
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,050
- Since when?
- I'm Swedish.

581
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:04,050
- I'm from Blackford.
- I am Chinese.

582
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,770
- Retardaþilor!
- Have you finished?

583
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:10,330
What do you want?

584
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,250
I came
to deal with blood.

585
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:20,370
Okay, go!

586
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,410
Come!

587
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:38,410
I thought you came after them.
For them life we? ?...

588
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:44,490
They told us that we have services
that we will pay well...

589
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,010
Some went...
but no one returned.

590
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:49,010
Then they asked and more.

591
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,970
They said that after the three men not
will go with them,

592
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,250
others will return home.

593
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:57,730
My husband has gone with them...

594
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:00,570
Long time
I had not heard.

595
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:05,410
Then... Came Sangvinii
and they took all the men.

596
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:10,330
I was forced to work in the mine.
The same was also in other villages.

597
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:15,370
Took our sons! Have not remained
than the very young.

598
01:00:15,405 --> 01:00:17,970
And after they return them.
I'm sure!

599
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:22,290
I hid
and now expected.

600
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:25,170
Why do not you move,
why did not you going?

601
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:29,850
That's our house!
Give our lives for our home.

602
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,010
Why did you come?

603
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,730
- I pursued.
- Do not Stay ajutaþi to us?

604
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:41,770
Have seen children! Will kill
and when i will finish the job!

605
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,370
We have our business with them.

606
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,490
I'm sorry...
Let's go!

607
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:01,330
- I do not think that will last long.
- I know her and that.

608
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,530
I'll do anything?

609
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:08,490
I have an idea, and how much you're
The proud, I'll you like.

610
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:10,250
- I'm proud?
- Yes?

611
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,170
- What do you mean?
- I mean... 're very proud.

612
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:14,890
- And you're not?
- Come...

613
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:18,130
Your ego is huge...
as a dinosaur.

614
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,450
We have! I found plutonium.

615
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:44,050
Very well!
Did Sing Lamentations, King!

616
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,130
By the power vested in me...

617
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,330
... You can kiss...

618
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:51,690
... knife!

619
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,450
Another one!

620
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:07,850
Rest... in bucãþele!

621
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,170
- This is the last?
- Yes.

622
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:19,810
Very well!

623
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,170
Rooms are empty.

624
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:41,690
Without hesitation!
Instructs you them all!

625
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:55,210
There are about 12 guards...
not too strong arms and cannons.

626
01:04:56,170 --> 01:05:00,970
They and anti-tank devices.
Trucks can not pass by.

627
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:06,610
I know it's a dumb question...
You know why we are dead?

628
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,530
Something I can think of...

629
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:45,250
- The maximum?
- The max!

630
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,570
Target in sight!

631
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,810
- Maybe he likes to travel.
- Fire!

632
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,650
- To nceapã the fun!
- Fire!

633
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:10,370
We launched bombs!

634
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,290
- What's going on?
- Chaos!

635
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:24,090
- I hope you are going!
- Yes!

636
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:26,050
Then, get high!

637
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,130
Come!

638
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,490
We need a new airplane.

639
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,970
We're too late!
Plutonium has disappeared!

640
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:27,690
Come!

641
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:32,330
Not move it!

642
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:36,050
Come on, plecaþi of here!

643
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:00,330
I'll stay here for a while...

644
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:10,330
It does not seem right...

645
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,650
As to die
like some chickens closed coteþ?

646
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,370
About such a thing...

647
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:18,610
Still not finished, child and I.
I have a plan.

648
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:20,570
Everybody calm down.

649
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,050
Fosfaþi rocks.

650
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:27,970
- What is?
- I think it is a bomb.

651
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,410
- You're talking seriously?
- Ask him.

652
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:36,410
- What's up, Gunner?
- I am a bomb! You got something against?

653
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,730
- An intelligent maniac...
- The scared...

654
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,850
Phosphate rocks
have a density of 1. 852.

655
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:46,690
Melt at 44. 2 degrees Celsius.

656
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:48,730
Guys, want less
kid powder that quickly!

657
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:52,730
- Make your it! Man is a chemical engineer, right?
- And scientist in his spare time.

658
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,850
Replace dust pipe.

659
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,450
- I think that's a huge found something...
- Do you?

660
01:08:57,485 --> 01:08:59,290
Probably not.

661
01:08:59,325 --> 01:09:00,890
Need help?
Come on!

662
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:02,970
Ready, go
and throw yourself into the air!

663
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:04,610
A lighter?

664
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,570
I want it back.

665
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,890
Give the back!
I'll make some noise.

666
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:16,010
Back!

667
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:20,010
Ready... Let's see!

668
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:25,890
Turn up if you do not want
to your head explode.

669
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,170
Seek cover the ears.

670
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,650
- I think that phosphate is wet.
- How not...

671
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:44,730
Or you are not the steps.

672
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:47,330
Do not cry, Gunner.

673
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:51,090
It was close to you and you have an idea.

674
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,290
I'm back!

675
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:19,890
How are you Trench?

676
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,610
Thank you!

677
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:01,170
- We're even now, right?
- Yes.

678
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,690
See you, Trech.
Do you thank.

679
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:06,370
Stay quiet,
still not finished.

680
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,170
- What?
- Yes...

681
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,250
How are you, buddy?

682
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,410
Well come up to you, Church.
What are you doing here?

683
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:21,130
- I heard it's a party town.
- Yes, but it's my party.

684
01:11:21,165 --> 01:11:23,490
- He's always been so selfish?
- Always!

685
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,410
Thanks nice...

686
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:32,650
I want to fuck him Vilain
or not?

687
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:35,130
Do not you look small and trengari.

688
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:58,330
Faster!

689
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:35,970
After them!

690
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:02,850
Go to the hangar now!

691
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:05,570
Urcaþi plutonium on the plane!

692
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:16,130
Come after me.

693
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,450
Must stall.

694
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:44,450
Come!

695
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,250
No more cartridges!

696
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:18,330
Keep him here! Come!

697
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:40,930
- It's funny, right?
- Yes...

698
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,090
Here it is!

699
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,490
Do you dust!

700
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:06,970
We run out of cartridges e
I'll be back soon!

701
01:15:07,005 --> 01:15:10,330
You have all returned.
Now I'm back!

702
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:19,970
Who's next, Rambo?

703
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,770
Bye-bye!

704
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,250
Let's get riding!

705
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:54,050
Start your engines! Decolaþi planes!
I want to make money!

706
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:01,810
Trench, come!

707
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:08,170
My shoe
is greater than this machine!

708
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,130
And you shoot that thing!

709
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:45,130
Prepare yourself!
We have a special guest!

710
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:48,650
Faster!

711
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:38,490
Here!

712
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:25,850
"Classics" are the best!

713
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:40,410
- Barney!
- What are you doing here?

714
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:47,530
I'm going alone. Do not come after me,
whatever happens. Got it?

715
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:50,370
- Got it?
- Yes.

716
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:55,530
If he will exit the door that...
for me...

717
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:57,570
Kill him!

718
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:05,970
Did you do what input...

719
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:10,290
That's right better.

720
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:27,530
- No more bullets.
- It's your problem.

721
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,250
Not really...

722
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:39,450
You want to kill me as a man...

723
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:44,090
... or want to kill me...

724
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:49,330
... like a sheep?

725
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:10,610
It's a nice knife and...

726
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:27,650
A and therefore... you choose?

727
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:33,330
Male or sheep?

728
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:38,970
If you want to be a man...
I make you a man.

729
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:54,210
Must swear
c-'re gonna love me strong.

730
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,650
I'll hurt you...

731
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:59,170
A take to get your life!

732
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,650
Put great!

733
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:30,010
It's over so quickly?
Why I gave atâþia money?

734
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,370
- Come on, get up!
- Immediately!

735
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:51,730
- How does it taste?
- You talking to me?

736
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,570
Time for bed!

737
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:29,170
How ironic... just two
and knives and your.

738
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:36,410
'll Die for and he...
What was his name?

739
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,370
How do you say?

740
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:45,010
What's the difference...

741
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:53,690
Come Vilain...
Someone is gonna die! Come on!

742
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:58,770
Come Vilain!

743
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:00,730
Come on!

744
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,410
Get up...

745
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:32,010
Get up!

746
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,890
Now get back...

747
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:42,130
Come back, you're sheep!

748
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:55,530
What are you waiting for?

749
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:06,810
His name was Billy!

750
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,650
- You win?
- I had I think so.

751
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:39,930
Where's the proof?

752
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:44,250
Head 'down!

753
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:50,050
Well done...

754
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:58,010
Very well...
You little extreme, but... fine.

755
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:02,930
Even if I do
to admit, Bam-Bam,

756
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:06,890
Now that we plutonium,
means that we're even.

757
01:25:06,925 --> 01:25:08,730
Very well.

758
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:16,410
When you're ready...

759
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:23,450
I want to tell you...

760
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:37,130
I work,
maybe a little bit immature.

761
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:43,130
You do not have to go...
if you want to stay, I'll stay.

762
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:47,690
In addition, we save lives babysitter.

763
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:50,090
That's right

764
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,770
Did port Perhaps luck.

765
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:55,730
Do you harbor bad luck but I
and can not afford such a thing.

766
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:04,450
If you ever need
help, call me... otherwise you're dead.

767
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:07,290
That's how I'll do.

768
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,410
What are you doing here?

769
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:20,250
Looking for something new. You killed
all "business partners".

770
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:22,290
There were a lone wolf?

771
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:26,090
Sometimes it's better with pack.

772
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:29,650
You're right.
Take care of yourself, Maggie.

773
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:38,330
I almost forgot...

774
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:40,770
As proof of my gratitude,
my dear friend,

775
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:45,530
You'll go home...
on you and on the trengarii yours.

776
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:48,930
- Look!
- What is it?

777
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:54,610
It's like a gift.

778
01:26:55,050 --> 01:27:00,370
- He belongs in a museum.
- Our place is in a museum!

779
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:03,450
- It was fun, right?
- Yes, it was.

780
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:06,730
Be careful!

781
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:21,730
Paris, France

782
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:14,090
For Billy!

783
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:17,850
- For Billy!
- Rest in peace!

784
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:20,650
- I need a massage.
- Do not look at me.

785
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:26,330
What?

786
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:29,850
- As one friend to another...
- What?

787
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:33,450
Just have to learn to lupþi...
