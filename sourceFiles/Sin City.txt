1
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:19,057
[man] Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.

2
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:22,102
Early retirement. Not my idea.

3
00:00:22,103 --> 00:00:25,189
Doctor's orders. Heart condition.

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,066
"Angina, " he calls it.

5
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:31,069
I'm polishing my badge,
getting myself used to the idea

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,614
of saying goodbye to it.
It, and 30-odd years

7
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:36,783
of protecting and serving and tears

8
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:40,370
and blood and terror
and triumph it represents.

9
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:43,916
I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.

10
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:48,795
About the thick, fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.

11
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:52,257
And I'm thinking about
the one loose end I haven't tied up.

12
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:54,468
A young girl who's out there somewhere,

13
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:59,469
helpless in the hands
of a drooling lunatic.

14
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:06,271
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do
this. You're gonna get yourself killed.

15
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:09,775
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

16
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:11,443
Let go of my coat, Bob.

17
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:13,862
You're draggin' me down with you.

18
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:18,367
I'm your partner. They can kill me, too.
I ain't puttin' up with that.

19
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:20,786
I'm gettin' on the horn,
calling for backup.

20
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:24,915
Sure, Bob. We'll just wait.
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat

21
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:29,336
gets his sick thrills with victim
number four. Victim number four!

22
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:34,091
Nancy Callahan, age 11. And she'll
be raped and slashed to ribbons.

23
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:38,262
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

24
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:42,766
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

25
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,477
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

26
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:48,397
Settle down and think straight.

27
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:52,484
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

28
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:56,113
You ain't savin' anyone.

29
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:59,116
You got a great attitude, Bob.

30
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:01,952
Real credit to the force, you are.

31
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:06,953
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

32
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:12,963
Heck, Bob...

33
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:14,673
maybe you are right.

34
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:18,927
I'm glad to hear you're
finally talkin' sense. [grunts]

35
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:21,638
[Hartigan] Hell of a way
to end a partnership.

36
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,474
Hell of a way to start my retirement.

37
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:27,311
Nancy Callahan, age 11.

38
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:32,232
For all I know, she's dead already.

39
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,860
[man] You've been
a very good girl, Nancy.

40
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,321
You've been very quiet.

41
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,489
- [whimpering]
- Don't be scared.

42
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,783
We're gonna be
taking you home soon.

43
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:46,784
But first, we're going
to introduce you to somebody.

44
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:50,751
He's a very nice man.

45
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,504
[Hartigan] Halfway to the warehouse
where Weevil said they took her,

46
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:57,841
and it hits.
Wicked spot of indigestion.

47
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:00,469
- [groaning]
- At least that's what I pray it is.

48
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,971
[man] ...momentary digression.

49
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:06,016
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

50
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:10,187
[man 2] For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

51
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:14,524
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

52
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,902
[Hartigan] Bun' Shlubb
and Douglas Klump:

53
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:21,114
two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.

54
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:24,242
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet,

55
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:26,870
remanded to our custody,
though it may be,

56
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:30,290
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

57
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,502
[Hartigan] Gotta keep this quiet.
Take 'em down fast.

58
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,671
A dent, the merest scratch thereupon,

59
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:38,799
and before-mentioned consequences
which I made mention

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,800
shall surely be athwart us.

61
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:50,394
- [heart beating]
- [groans]

62
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:54,981
[Hartigan] Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.

63
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:59,069
But it won't slow down.

64
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,571
Get over it.

65
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,281
She needs you.

66
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:05,242
We're all done here, Benny.

67
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:08,829
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

68
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,622
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

69
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:13,166
I'm making sure
they get along really well.

70
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:18,167
What kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

71
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:22,259
You must be awfully scared now.

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,013
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

73
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:31,143
All we're gonna do
is have a nice little talk.

74
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:35,355
That's all. Just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

75
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:38,942
Don't you cry now.

76
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:41,278
[Hartigan] Doctor said
it'd be like this.

77
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,116
Just take the pill he gave you.

78
00:04:46,117 --> 00:04:51,117
[grunting]

79
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,708
No need to play it quiet.

80
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,794
Not anymore.

81
00:04:57,795 --> 00:05:01,673
Breathe steady, old man.
Prove you're not completely useless.

82
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:04,885
What the hell?
Go out with a bang.

83
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:06,636
He likes to hear 'em scream.

84
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:09,598
I've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces,

85
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:14,519
all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen
in their last horrible moment of living.

86
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,520
No screams. Either I'm just in time,
or I'm way too late.

87
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:23,823
[grunts]

88
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:34,452
[Hartigan] It's nothing. Barely
a flesh wound. On your feet, old man.

89
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:43,048
[Hartigan] Roark. Give it up.

90
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,008
Let the girl go.

91
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,260
You can't do a goddamn thing to me.

92
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,346
You know who I am.

93
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,681
You know who my father is!

94
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:55,519
You can't touch me,
you piece-of-shit cop.

95
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

96
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:03,777
Sure, I can.

97
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:08,778
[screaming]

98
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,869
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

99
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,870
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

100
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:23,004
- [Hartigan] I take his weapons away.
- [screaming]

101
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:27,801
- Both of them.
- [screaming]

102
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:32,138
[grunting]

103
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,724
[Nancy sobbing]

104
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:37,227
[Hartigan] Hell of a way
to end a partnership.

105
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:41,231
[Bob] For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse.

106
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:44,818
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

107
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,989
- Never better.
- [Roark groaning]

108
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,408
I'm ready to kick your ass.

109
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:54,411
[Hartigan] Keep him talking. Buy time.

110
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:57,163
Just a few more minutes.
Till the backup gets here.

111
00:06:57,164 --> 00:07:01,167
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

112
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:05,088
[Hartigan] Keep his mind off the girl,
skinny little Nancy.

113
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:07,173
Can't kill her
once backup gets here.

114
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:09,593
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

115
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:12,554
Hey. Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

116
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:15,849
- What a tough man you are.
- You stay right where you're at.

117
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,935
You shoot your partner in the back...

118
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:23,231
then you try to scare a girl.
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod,

119
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:25,901
plug you a couple of times,
show you how it's done.

120
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:30,780
We could've worked something out.
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

121
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:35,410
- [Hartigan] So slow, never stop me.
- Sit down!

122
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:40,411
- You'll never be able to stop me.
- [screams]

123
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:45,629
[siren wails in distance]

124
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,630
[Hartigan] I finally sit down,
just like you told me to.

125
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:54,054
The sirens are close now.

126
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:59,055
She'll be safe.

127
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:09,565
Things go dark.
I don't mind much.

128
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:13,490
Getting sleepy. It's OK.

129
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:15,825
She'll be safe.

130
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:18,328
An old man dies,

131
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:20,997
a little girl lives.

132
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:25,998
Fair trade.

133
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:47,190
Just tell me it isn't true, John.

134
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:51,403
What they're saying
about you and that child.

135
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:54,155
It can't be true.

136
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:59,156
If you ever want to see me again...

137
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:04,412
say something now.

138
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:08,753
We're looking at
your basic mountain of DNA evidence.

139
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:11,381
The testimony of your own partner,

140
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:14,801
corroboration by six eyewitnesses,
and that's just so far

141
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:17,303
and there's your own silence.

142
00:09:17,304 --> 00:09:21,224
I'll do what I can, but let us
just say you are good and screwed.

143
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:24,561
Come on, Hartigan,
what's holding you back?

144
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:26,312
What's shuttin' you up?

145
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,565
This whole thing stinks to high heaven.

146
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,192
I'm not the only one
on the force who smells it.

147
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:34,029
Sure, I'll rinse your bedpan
and wipe your butt.

148
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,864
That's my job.

149
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:39,159
But don't expect any friendly
chitchat out of me, mister.

150
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,870
I heard what you done to that girl.

151
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:46,871
I hope they throw away the key.

152
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,886
Evenin', officer.

153
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,889
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?

154
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,058
You read the papers.

155
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,603
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

156
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:09,814
You know who I am and what I can do.

157
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:13,026
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

158
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:15,612
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

159
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:19,532
You blew my son's ear off.

160
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:24,533
You blew his arm off. You even
blew his nuts and his pecker off.

161
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:31,791
He's in a coma right now. They say
he may never come out of it. My boy.

162
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:35,381
He could've been the first Roark
to become the president

163
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:39,636
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

164
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:44,349
Pullin' that trigger
make you feel powerful?

165
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,350
Power don't come
from a badge or a gun.

166
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:52,148
Power comes from lying.

167
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,778
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

168
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,655
Once you got everybody agreeing

169
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:02,826
with what they know in their hearts
ain't true, you've got 'em by the balls.

170
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:07,827
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

171
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:14,587
I could pump you full of bullets right
now, and I wouldn't even be arrested.

172
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:17,966
Everyone would lie for me,
everyone who counts.

173
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:20,969
Otherwise, their lies,
everything that runs Sin City,

174
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,973
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

175
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:28,393
[laughing]

176
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,980
But I want you firm
and fit and healthy.

177
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:35,108
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

178
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:40,109
Fix that heart condition of yours.

179
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:45,197
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

180
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:50,290
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

181
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,042
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

182
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:56,963
disgraced, destroyed...

183
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:59,883
alone.

184
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,926
Your wife?

185
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:04,262
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

186
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,848
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

187
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:09,225
[siren wailing]

188
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:11,102
They won't let me testify.

189
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:15,523
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

190
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:18,067
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

191
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:20,904
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

192
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:23,656
I told them you saved me
from that Roark creep,

193
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:27,911
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

194
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:32,415
I'm still a virgin, still alive,
thanks to you.

195
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,918
They got it all backwards.

196
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,795
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

197
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:42,342
But you'll always remember things right.

198
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:46,095
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

199
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:51,059
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

200
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,186
Don't visit me.

201
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:55,063
Don't write me.

202
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:57,232
Don't even say my name.

203
00:12:57,233 --> 00:13:01,861
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

204
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:03,821
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia."

205
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:08,534
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

206
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:12,956
I'll write you every week...
for forever.

207
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,875
Sure, kid.

208
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,086
Now, run on home.

209
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:23,087
It's not safe for you here.

210
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:29,385
Bye, Nancy.

211
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:34,515
I love you.

212
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:43,069
- [groans]
- John Hartigan.

213
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,698
Mr. Law and Order.

214
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,659
Mr. By the Book.

215
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,828
Mr. High and Mighty.

216
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:54,038
[sighs]

217
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:57,750
I gotta give you credit, being a
straight arrow for so damn many years

218
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,836
without it catching up with you.

219
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:03,339
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

220
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,508
It's catching up with you but good.

221
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:09,721
[grunting]

222
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:12,348
Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look good.

223
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:16,477
Oh! He's hale and hearty, Tammy.

224
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:19,022
See?

225
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:22,442
He's the picture of health. [laughing]

226
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:25,987
That Tammy, there,
she's fine, isn't she?

227
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:28,197
I rented her out of Old Town.

228
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:33,036
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

229
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:34,495
You hear me, Hartigan?

230
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:38,249
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

231
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,044
you might just get some of Tammy.

232
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:44,964
You see that? She flinched.

233
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:47,383
You make her sick.

234
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:50,136
She heard about you
and that little girl.

235
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:53,222
[Hartigan] Nothing but a price
I promised myself I'd pay,

236
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:54,640
and I'm paying it.

237
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:56,601
You don't save a little girl's life,

238
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:59,187
then turn around
and throw her to the dogs.

239
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:01,272
Not in my book, you don't.

240
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:06,273
They want a confession.
They won't get it.

241
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:11,574
There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.

242
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:14,744
She calls herself "Cordelia,"
just like she promised.

243
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:18,581
She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.

244
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:21,876
At first, I figure
she'll send another note or two

245
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:25,254
before her young mind
moves on to better things.

246
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:28,383
But every Thursday,
another one arrives.

247
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:30,259
What a sweet kid.

248
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,931
I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when I reach for it.

249
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:39,435
She's the only friend I've got,
the daughter I never had.

250
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:41,521
My sweet Cordelia.

251
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:45,942
Skinny little Nancy Callahan.

252
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:48,277
Eight years pass.

253
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,615
[keys jingling]

254
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:55,743
Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot,

255
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:57,829
excited as a kid at Christmas,

256
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,499
only to find myself staring
at the damn floor of my damn cell,

257
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,294
looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.

258
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:07,797
Then another Thursday with no letter.

259
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,715
Is she all right?

260
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:12,176
Did something happen to her?

261
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,804
Nothing.

262
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:18,558
Two months now.
Not a word from Nancy.

263
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,978
Did they find her?
Did they get to her?

264
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:25,648
Of course! Stupid old man.

265
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,360
Do your math. Nancy's 19 years old.

266
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:31,946
How long did you expect her
to keep writing?

267
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:35,700
She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.

268
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,870
She's forgotten you, old man.

269
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:40,913
You're alone.

270
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:43,291
You're all alone.

271
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:48,292
[door clanking]

272
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,844
This guy smells awful, like bad food.

273
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:58,306
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer.

274
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:03,307
He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.

275
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:15,031
Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard.

276
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,408
When I come to, I see it.

277
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,745
The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,

278
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:23,372
but there's no letter inside of it.

279
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:27,877
There's something soft,
something that ought to be alive,

280
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,838
a hunk of meat and bone
that ought to be the index finger

281
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:33,633
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.

282
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,843
How the hell did they find her?

283
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,553
She was so careful.

284
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:40,515
She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.

285
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:41,128
[yelling]

286
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:49,190
I've got to get out.
I've got to help her.

287
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:54,191
Nothing else matters.
Not my life and not my pride, either.

288
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:57,073
It's only one final
surrender they want.

289
00:17:57,074 --> 00:18:01,118
You got me, Roark. You beat me.

290
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,119
- [phone ringing]
- [sirens wailing]

291
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:11,796
I'll get it, Claire.
It's gotta be Marv.

292
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:15,049
He never sleeps and he's always
getting himself in deep.

293
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,843
Yeah.

294
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,679
What?

295
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,475
Hartigan, my God, it is you. Yes, yes.

296
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:27,395
No, I'll get right on it,
right this second.

297
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:32,396
I'll be there by ten, I promise.

298
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:36,862
[Hartigan] Lucille, she wouldn't give up
on me back before the trial.

299
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:40,616
She almost slugged me when I
stopped her from hiring a new attorney.

300
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:43,452
When I refused to plead innocent
she did slug me.

301
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:46,872
When she hears what I'm gonna do
she'll probably slug me again.

302
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,124
Hartigan.

303
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:52,461
[scoffs] Damn.

304
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:56,299
[footsteps approaching]

305
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,551
It's like they were waiting for my call.

306
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:01,596
They're ready to deal. They're
practically begging for a deal.

307
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,055
They're scared of something.

308
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:05,224
One of them promised me
you'd be out on parole

309
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:07,476
if you confessed and expressed regret
and all that other dumb crap

310
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,562
that, of course, we won't go for.

311
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:12,607
No, we're getting you out for
time served, no strings attached.

312
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,610
Then, we're gonna turn right around
and sue those sorry sons of bitches

313
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:17,320
for false prosecution.

314
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:19,030
You're gonna be exonerated.

315
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:21,115
You're gonna be a very rich man.

316
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,825
This isn't like you think it is.

317
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,953
Like hell it isn't. Doesn't take a
genius to figure out who framed you.

318
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:28,080
- But even Senator Roark...
- You hung up the phone too soon.

319
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,374
- We'll use the law, the press...
- Going to a lot of trouble for nothing.

320
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,001
He will never know what hit him.

321
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:34,545
I'm gonna confess.

322
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:37,340
Excuse me?

323
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:40,843
John Hartigan, crawling on his belly
in front of a parole board,

324
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:44,263
confessing to raping a little girl
and blubbering for mercy?

325
00:19:44,264 --> 00:19:46,307
No, doesn't work.

326
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:51,308
I'm going in there and I'm telling them
I'm a twisted, wretched child molester.

327
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:57,022
I'm agreeing to anything
they want from me.

328
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,742
All right, you son of a bitch.

329
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:09,743
Let's get this over with.

330
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:16,041
[Hartigan] I say everything they want to
hear, just the way they want to hear it.

331
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:20,841
I tell them I'm a twisted,
wretched child molester.

332
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:25,842
I agree to everything they want from me.

333
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:31,056
I love you, Nancy.

334
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:44,903
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

335
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:49,912
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

336
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:53,874
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

337
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,460
Christ.

338
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:59,380
Eight years.

339
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:04,009
Yeah. Eight years.

340
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,889
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

341
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,602
you made me hate myself.

342
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:16,772
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah.

343
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:21,773
She got remarried four years ago.

344
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:27,616
- She had two kids. I'm sorry, John.
- Nah.

345
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:32,288
Don't be. I'm glad.

346
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,583
Eileen always wanted kids.

347
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:39,503
She'll make a good mother.

348
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:44,504
Like you said, Bob,
water under the bridge.

349
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:58,063
[Hartigan] Bob and I get on
with fond farewells to each other,

350
00:21:58,064 --> 00:22:02,193
then I go looking for the only
human being who means a damn to me:

351
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:03,277
Nancy.

352
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,323
How could they have found out it was
you writing all those letters to me?

353
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:10,159
How did they find out who you are?

354
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,160
And what have they done to you, baby?

355
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,251
Not a sound.

356
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:22,046
No sign of life.

357
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:25,841
Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,

358
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:29,678
like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?

359
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,556
What has he done to Nancy?

360
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:35,351
All she does is read and study
and write.

361
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:40,352
No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.

362
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:45,820
Closest thing to a clue is a pack
of matches from a lousy saloon.

363
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:50,821
It's a long shot, but maybe
she's got some friends there.

364
00:22:57,707 --> 00:23:01,418
A dead end.
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do

365
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:03,754
with a pack of drunks
and losers like this.

366
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:07,842
But if there's anything to be found,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is

367
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:10,886
or who kidnapped and mutilated her,
this is the place.

368
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:15,766
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

369
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:19,478
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

370
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:22,398
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

371
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,984
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

372
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:27,778
She's just warming up.

373
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:32,779
[rock music plays]

374
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:39,373
[Hartigan] Skinny little Nancy Callahan.

375
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:41,333
She grew up.

376
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:44,336
She filled out.

377
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:49,337
Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.

378
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:53,053
And here I was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,

379
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:56,891
maybe a bit too shy for her own good.

380
00:23:56,892 --> 00:24:01,892
How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.

381
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:09,445
How the hell did they find her?

382
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:12,072
Then it hits me.

383
00:24:12,073 --> 00:24:15,159
They were bluffing.

384
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I've /ed them straight to her.

385
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:29,465
She hasn't spotted you yet.

386
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:33,135
Turn around and walk out the door.

387
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:34,762
Lead the creep outside.

388
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:39,763
Get that Beretta away
from him somehow, and kill him.

389
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:44,271
I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.

390
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:47,983
Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.

391
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:50,694
No, Nancy. Don't notice me.

392
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:55,695
Don't recognize me.

393
00:24:56,785 --> 00:25:01,785
[crowd cheering]

394
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:06,001
There's no time to explain.

395
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:09,171
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

396
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:11,590
We need to get out of here
right this second.

397
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:16,591
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

398
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:22,226
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

399
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:26,105
Kept me going.

400
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:29,733
Kept me from killing myself.

401
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:34,734
Hurry up, will you?

402
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:41,328
- Maybe I should drive.
- Not a chance.

403
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:46,329
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

404
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:53,549
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

405
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:58,220
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

406
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:02,057
It's loaded and it works.

407
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:04,727
Yeah, this'll do.

408
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:09,728
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

409
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:17,402
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

410
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:20,409
You've never been
far from my thoughts.

411
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,079
I've lain awake nights,
thinking of you.

412
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,957
What are you talking about? Damn!

413
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:31,958
Keep driving, Nancy. Keep driving
and keep the car on the road!

414
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,550
[Hartigan] She's counting on you.

415
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:41,551
- What are you doing?
- Prove you're still worth a damn.

416
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:51,811
Try to keep it on the road, Nancy!

417
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,026
[Hartigan] He's a decent shot.

418
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,987
He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry.

419
00:26:56,988 --> 00:27:01,988
Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.

420
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:06,163
He doesn't know how to take his time.

421
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:09,458
Aim careful
and look the devil in the eye.

422
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:09,959
Ah!

423
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:20,469
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

424
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,638
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

425
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:27,639
Right. Stop the car, confirm the kill.

426
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,317
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

427
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:39,613
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

428
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:41,865
No! Let me stay close.

429
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:44,493
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

430
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:49,494
Please? Let me stay close.

431
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,340
[Hartigan] The stink. I almost gag.
His blood smells worse than he does.

432
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:06,348
- Jesus.
- And it's all over the place.

433
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:10,727
- But the creep himself, he's gone.
- [sirens wailing]

434
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:13,105
We're out of time.

435
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:17,401
[Hartigan] The sirens.
I used to welcome the sound.

436
00:28:17,402 --> 00:28:21,029
Nothing to do now
but find a place for the night,

437
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,867
get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.

438
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:28,245
The stink... somehow it stays
with us all the way to the motel.

439
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:31,290
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

440
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:35,294
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

441
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:37,713
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

442
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:41,550
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

443
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:45,220
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

444
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:48,932
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

445
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,351
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

446
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:52,728
[gagging]

447
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,522
[Hartigan] You'll feel
better if you sit down.

448
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:58,734
[Hartigan] I've never been
all that good with people.

449
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:02,154
When it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19-year-old,

450
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:06,116
I'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.

451
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:09,161
It's always been you, Hartigan.

452
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:12,247
All these years.

453
00:29:12,248 --> 00:29:14,708
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

454
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:18,253
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

455
00:29:18,254 --> 00:29:21,590
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

456
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:24,092
Eight years.

457
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:27,763
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

458
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:29,765
It wasn't just gratitude.

459
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:32,935
I tried to fall in love with boys.

460
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,395
Even thought I did once or twice.

461
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:40,396
But I was already in love... with you.

462
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:41,444
No.

463
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,252
[panting]

464
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:21,066
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

465
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:23,652
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

466
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:28,653
I love you.

467
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,870
I love you, too.

468
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:37,040
With all my heart.

469
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:40,335
[Hartigan] Cold shower. It helps.

470
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:42,337
No, Nancy.

471
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:45,173
[grunts]

472
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:47,509
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

473
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,388
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

474
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:55,225
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

475
00:30:55,226 --> 00:31:00,226
Sure. I recognize your voice, Junior.

476
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,359
[Hartigan]
Everything's gone straight to hell.

477
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,362
I've been suckered into betraying
the only friend I've got,

478
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:11,033
put her in the hands of a rapist
I thought I'd put down for good.

479
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:15,537
Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.

480
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:17,581
It's all gone to hell.

481
00:31:17,582 --> 00:31:19,499
[Roark] Klump, it's me.

482
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,544
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

483
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:24,546
I want you to set me up for a party.

484
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:27,049
I've already got the girl,
you dumb shit!

485
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,052
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

486
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,763
My tools better be clean and sharp.

487
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:37,392
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

488
00:31:37,393 --> 00:31:42,393
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

489
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:46,735
My dad... I'd love him
if I didn't hate him.

490
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:49,529
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

491
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,783
to grow back that equipment
you blew off between my legs,

492
00:31:52,784 --> 00:31:57,537
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grand kid.

493
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:01,291
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

494
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:05,420
I'm not complaining. Since you've been
gone, I'm having the time of my life.

495
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:09,132
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

496
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:14,133
We wondered who wrote those letters.
She left not a clue.

497
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,680
Clever girl. And so pretty, so pretty.

498
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:24,564
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

499
00:32:24,565 --> 00:32:27,818
Nancy, don't scream.

500
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:30,487
Whatever he does to you,
don't scream.

501
00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:34,908
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

502
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:38,286
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

503
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:40,914
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

504
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:43,959
Dozens of them, maybe a hundred.

505
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,045
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

506
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:49,506
If there weren't
so many people hereabout,

507
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:53,427
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

508
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:58,428
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

509
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:05,143
[Hartigan choking]

510
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:09,109
[Hartigan] This is it.
No way to fight it now.

511
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,236
No hope left.

512
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:12,863
No chance.

513
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:17,864
This is it. This is the end.

514
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:20,495
No.

515
00:33:20,496 --> 00:33:25,496
Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.

516
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:29,504
The window, maybe there's an alarm.
The window.

517
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:32,424
Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!
Stay conscious!

518
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:35,093
Stay conscious.

519
00:33:35,094 --> 00:33:36,344
No alarm.

520
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:39,598
The glass! Cut the rope.

521
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,100
You can do it. You can do it.

522
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:44,060
[Klump] It is inclement upon me

523
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:48,482
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

524
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:52,736
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car

525
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:55,363
to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

526
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:57,574
Protest though you might, Mr. Klump,

527
00:33:57,575 --> 00:34:00,827
you must none-the-less admit
to the sheer phallic majesty

528
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:02,871
of said Ferrari's performance.

529
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:07,542
An engine of cyclopean power throbs
beneath this steel stallion's hood.

530
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:11,171
Irrelevant to said mission
is the following query,

531
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:13,298
which I now put forth to you:

532
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:15,592
Wherein this most streamlined

533
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:19,554
and trunkless of transports,

534
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:22,474
boner-inspiring though it may be,

535
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:27,475
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

536
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:32,567
A worthy concern.

537
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:37,568
Neatly elucidated.

538
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:43,407
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

539
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:50,168
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

540
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,920
In plain English, creep!

541
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:56,921
The answer you seek
is rural, even agrarian.

542
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:59,970
The farm!

543
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:03,014
[Hartigan] That's all I need to hear.
Every cop on the force

544
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:07,185
knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it.

545
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:09,563
Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.

546
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:12,774
Once things get loud,
I'll have use for the cannons.

547
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:15,777
But at first,
I'll have to play it quiet.

548
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:18,613
Quiet and nasty.

549
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:22,117
Nancy's car, six miles from the farm.

550
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:25,453
"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running," she told me.

551
00:35:25,454 --> 00:35:28,873
Good girl. The car stalled out
on that yellow bastard

552
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:31,459
and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again.

553
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,463
You kept your mouth shut.
I'll bet Junior was furious.

554
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:38,133
I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.

555
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:42,137
But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.

556
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:44,472
There's still a chance, Nancy.

557
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:46,391
Don't scream.

558
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:49,144
I ditch the car a mile or so
from the farm

559
00:35:49,145 --> 00:35:51,062
and make my way through the woods.

560
00:35:51,063 --> 00:35:54,316
I'm not halfway there when it hits.

561
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:56,026
[groaning]

562
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:59,696
[Hartigan] My heart. Can't be my heart.

563
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:02,616
I was cured.

564
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:05,619
Bad cough. Blood in it.

565
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,787
Doesn't matter now.

566
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:12,788
I don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway.

567
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,090
Rotten way to kill a man,
but it's quiet.

568
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:19,635
[grunts]

569
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,180
Hate yourself later.

570
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:38,526
[Whipping]

571
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:41,863
[Roark] You're only making this worse,
you stupid cow!

572
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:46,864
- [whip lashing]
- [Roark grunting]

573
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:55,710
Do you think I'm tired? Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

574
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:58,213
You're the one who's gonna crack!

575
00:36:58,214 --> 00:37:03,214
You'll crack!
You'll cry and beg!

576
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:05,178
You'll scream!

577
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:09,974
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

578
00:37:09,975 --> 00:37:14,975
You'll scream!

579
00:37:16,857 --> 00:37:19,567
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

580
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:23,863
That was foreplay.

581
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:26,866
Hartigan was right about you.

582
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:30,995
You can't get it up unless I scream.

583
00:37:30,996 --> 00:37:34,082
You're pathetic!

584
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:38,545
You're pathetic.

585
00:37:38,546 --> 00:37:43,091
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

586
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:48,092
It brings out the worst in me.

587
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,183
[gunshot]

588
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:54,018
[Hartigan] Stupid old man!

589
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:57,647
In too much of a hurry.

590
00:37:57,648 --> 00:38:00,525
Damn! It can't be!

591
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:04,779
[Hartigan] Charging in like Galahad,
just like I told myself I wouldn't!

592
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,156
Stupid old man!

593
00:38:06,157 --> 00:38:11,157
- [man] You tagged him good!
- [man 2] Perforate the fool.

594
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:19,915
Good advice.

595
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:29,554
[Hartigan] Give it up, Junior.

596
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:33,141
- It's over. Let her go.
- You're dreaming, Hartigan!

597
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:38,142
I see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams in front of you!

598
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:41,399
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

599
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,235
You can't even lift that cannon!

600
00:38:44,236 --> 00:38:49,236
Sure, I can.

601
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:53,369
[laughing]

602
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,331
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

603
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:59,918
Nancy, I'm sorry.

604
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:04,919
I'm taking no chances with you.

605
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:10,216
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

606
00:39:11,972 --> 00:39:16,017
Here it comes.

607
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:21,018
- It's gonna hurt.
- You're right about that.

608
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,817
' [gasping] ' [sighs]

609
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:24,318
Sucker.

610
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:32,784
[Hartigan] I take away his weapon.

611
00:39:32,785 --> 00:39:37,785
- Both of them.
- [screaming]

612
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:49,717
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

613
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:53,763
[Hartigan] After a while, all I'm doing
is pounding wet chunks of bone

614
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:57,517
into the floorboards, so I stop.

615
00:39:57,518 --> 00:40:00,061
So long, Junior.

616
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:05,062
Been a pleasure.

617
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:12,907
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

618
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:16,786
- I didn't scream.
- I know it, baby.

619
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:21,787
You grew up strong.

620
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:34,095
[Hartigan] By the time I get her
to the car, Nancy stops shaking.

621
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:38,099
Her skin is warm again.
She's herself again.

622
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,895
Thanks for remembering my coat.

623
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:43,938
And for all the little things.

624
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:48,939
Like saving my life, twice.

625
00:40:49,153 --> 00:40:52,322
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

626
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:57,323
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

627
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:00,163
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

628
00:41:00,164 --> 00:41:02,582
I'm gonna clear my name.

629
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:06,711
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

630
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:11,712
I can't lose you, not again.

631
00:41:12,718 --> 00:41:17,718
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

632
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:33,317
[Hartigan] Nancy Callahan,
the love of my life.

633
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:38,242
Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it.

634
00:41:38,243 --> 00:41:41,913
Get Senator Roark behind bars? Sure.

635
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:45,541
Maybe after I've pulled off that
miracle, I'll go and punch out God.

636
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:49,420
There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.

637
00:41:49,421 --> 00:41:51,673
I killed his only son.

638
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:53,841
The bloodline is cut.

639
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:56,844
Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.

640
00:41:56,845 --> 00:41:59,639
He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.

641
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,101
He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again.

642
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:05,853
There 'll be no end to it.

643
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:07,981
She'll never be safe.

644
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:10,817
Not as long as I'm alive.

645
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:14,028
There's only one way to beat him.

646
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:16,781
An old man dies,

647
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:20,118
a young woman lives.

648
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:25,119
Fair trade.

649
00:42:25,332 --> 00:42:30,332
I love you, Nancy.

650
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:42,728
[sirens wailing in distance]

651
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:52,362
[man] She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.

652
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:59,995
I let her hear my footsteps.

653
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,960
She only goes stiff for a moment.

654
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:07,961
Care for a smoke?

655
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:11,677
Sure. I'll take one.

656
00:48:11,678 --> 00:48:15,514
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

657
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:20,515
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

658
00:48:21,646 --> 00:48:25,441
I've watched you for days.

659
00:48:25,442 --> 00:48:29,278
You're everything a man could ever want.

660
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:31,822
It's not just your face,

661
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:36,823
your figure or your voice.

662
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:42,875
It's your eyes.

663
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:47,876
All the things I see in your eyes.

664
00:48:48,465 --> 00:48:53,465
What is it you see in my eyes?

665
00:48:55,388 --> 00:48:59,850
I see a crazy calm.

666
00:48:59,851 --> 00:49:04,146
You're sick of running.

667
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:07,399
You're ready to face
what you have to face.

668
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,153
But you don't want to face it alone.

669
00:49:11,154 --> 00:49:13,239
No.

670
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,326
I don't want to face it alone.

671
00:49:17,327 --> 00:49:22,327
[thunder rumbles softly]

672
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,252
[man] The wind rises electric.

673
00:49:26,253 --> 00:49:29,922
She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.

674
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:34,923
Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.

675
00:49:35,387 --> 00:49:39,932
I tell her that
everything will be all right.

676
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:44,933
That I'll save her from whatever she's
scared of and take her far, far away.

677
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:51,110
I tell her I love her.

678
00:49:51,111 --> 00:49:54,864
- [muffled gunshot]
- [thunder rumbles]

679
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:59,865
The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.

680
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,120
I hold her close until she's gone.

681
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:10,709
I'll never know
what she was running from.

682
00:50:11,131 --> 00:50:16,131
I'll cash her check in the morning.

683
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:46,665
[woman] Yes.

684
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:48,959
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

685
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,960
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

686
00:50:54,341 --> 00:50:58,010
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

687
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:03,011
It should be right as rain in no time.

688
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:06,393
Uh-huh.

689
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:11,394
[elevator dings]

690
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:15,027
Mm-hmm.

691
00:51:19,532 --> 00:51:22,910
[man] Turn the right corner in Sin City

692
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:27,665
and you can find... anything.

693
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:31,293
Becky.

694
00:51:31,294 --> 00:51:36,173
Care for a smoke?

695
00:51:36,174 --> 00:51:40,678
Love you, too, Mom.

696
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:45,679
[man] Anything.

697
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:10,405
[man] The night is hot as hell.

698
00:56:10,406 --> 00:56:15,077
It's a lousy room
in a lousy pan' of a lousy town.

699
00:56:15,078 --> 00:56:17,538
I'm staring at a goddess.

700
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:20,040
She's telling me she wants me.

701
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:23,961
I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.

702
00:56:23,962 --> 00:56:28,298
I want you.

703
00:56:28,299 --> 00:56:33,299
[man] She smells
like angels ought to smell.

704
00:56:34,973 --> 00:56:39,973
The perfect woman.

705
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:46,271
The goddess.

706
00:56:47,443 --> 00:56:51,488
I need you.

707
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:53,615
[man] Goldie.

708
00:56:53,616 --> 00:56:58,616
She says her name is Goldie.

709
00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:07,713
Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.

710
00:57:07,714 --> 00:57:10,882
And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.

711
00:57:10,883 --> 00:57:14,761
And I realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.

712
00:57:14,762 --> 00:57:18,473
You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers

713
00:57:18,474 --> 00:57:21,184
aren't moving like
if she was breathing.

714
00:57:21,185 --> 00:57:24,229
She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.

715
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:28,567
Lying next to her,
stone drunk, just like she was.

716
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:33,113
Damn it, Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?

717
00:57:33,114 --> 00:57:35,699
Who were you
besides an angel of mercy,

718
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,119
giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?

719
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,872
It sure as hell wasn't my looks.

720
00:57:41,873 --> 00:57:44,875
So why the sleazy saloon?

721
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:47,294
Why the kindness, Goldie?

722
00:57:47,295 --> 00:57:49,379
[sirens wailing]

723
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:54,217
[man] The cops, they're telling me
too much, showing up before anybody

724
00:57:54,218 --> 00:57:57,262
but me and the killer could
know there's been a murder.

725
00:57:57,263 --> 00:58:01,266
Somebody paid good money
for this frame.

726
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:03,727
No reason at all to play it quiet.

727
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:08,728
No reason to play it
any way but my way.

728
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:16,319
Whoever killed you
is gonna pay, Goldie.

729
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:21,578
[officer] Open up, police!

730
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:26,579
I'll be right out.

731
00:58:27,418 --> 00:58:30,629
[gunshot]

732
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,242
[gunfire]

733
00:58:42,392 --> 00:58:47,392
[siren approaching]

734
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,860
[man] I don't know
why you died, Goldie.

735
00:58:58,032 --> 00:59:02,452
I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight,

736
00:59:02,453 --> 00:59:06,373
but you were a friend and more
when I needed one.

737
00:59:06,374 --> 00:59:09,126
And when I find out who did it,

738
00:59:09,127 --> 00:59:12,170
it won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.

739
00:59:12,171 --> 00:59:16,091
It'll be loud and nasty,
my kind of kill.

740
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:19,136
And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I send him to

741
00:59:19,137 --> 00:59:22,806
will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.

742
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:27,807
I love you, Goldie.

743
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:36,023
- [siren blares in distance]
- [helicopter passing]

744
00:59:42,618 --> 00:59:46,079
[rustling]

745
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:46,580
Claire?

746
00:59:57,759 --> 01:00:01,845
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

747
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:06,846
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way I'm giving you any alcohol.

748
01:00:07,018 --> 01:00:11,229
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

749
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,023
No.

750
01:00:13,024 --> 01:00:15,650
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

751
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:17,778
Thanks. You're the best.

752
01:00:17,779 --> 01:00:20,655
[man] Lucille's my parole officer.

753
01:00:20,656 --> 01:00:22,908
She's a dyke, but God knows why.

754
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:26,536
With that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.

755
01:00:26,537 --> 01:00:29,706
The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.

756
01:00:29,707 --> 01:00:33,960
She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.

757
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:37,714
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

758
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:41,218
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them?

759
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:45,680
Not that I know. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

760
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:48,725
How do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

761
01:00:48,726 --> 01:00:53,726
There ain't no squaring it. Not this
time. This isn't some barroom brawl.

762
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:57,818
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

763
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:59,277
Hey, hey. This is big.

764
01:00:59,278 --> 01:01:03,114
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- There ain't no settlin' down!

765
01:01:03,115 --> 01:01:06,451
This is blood for blood,
and by the gallons.

766
01:01:06,452 --> 01:01:11,039
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

767
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,959
They're back.
There's no choices left.

768
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,836
And I'm ready for war.

769
01:01:15,837 --> 01:01:19,840
Prison was hell for you.
It's gonna be life this time.

770
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:24,841
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

771
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:27,180
But I'm out now.

772
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:30,767
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

773
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:35,768
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

774
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:41,194
- [helicopter passing]
- [Marv] Now, for Gladys. Sweet Gladys.

775
01:01:41,195 --> 01:01:43,947
But I'll have to sneak past Mom,

776
01:01:43,948 --> 01:01:48,948
and her ears have gotten a whole
lot better since she went blind.

777
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:54,708
Mom still hasn't changed
a thing in this room.

778
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:58,336
Every week she dusts it all off
so it looks like it was only yesterday

779
01:01:58,337 --> 01:02:00,338
that I moved out.

780
01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:03,091
Every time I come visit,
she has me sleep in here,

781
01:02:03,092 --> 01:02:07,137
and the old smells make me cry
like they do right now.

782
01:02:07,138 --> 01:02:10,473
I knew Gladys would be safe here.

783
01:02:10,474 --> 01:02:13,727
I call her Gladys after
one of the sisters from school.

784
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:16,021
She's almost lived up to the name.

785
01:02:16,022 --> 01:02:19,524
For a while we just get
the feel of each other back.

786
01:02:19,525 --> 01:02:21,526
Good as ever.

787
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:24,863
I tell her about Goldie
and what we have to do.

788
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:29,826
Marvin?
Is that you, baby?

789
01:02:29,827 --> 01:02:32,162
Yes, Mom. I'm sorry I woke you up.

790
01:02:32,163 --> 01:02:36,833
I couldn't sleep for the worry.
There were men here looking for you.

791
01:02:36,834 --> 01:02:39,044
They weren't police.

792
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:43,340
It was about my job.
I got a new job.

793
01:02:43,341 --> 01:02:48,341
- It's night work.
- What did you do to your face?

794
01:02:48,387 --> 01:02:51,598
Oh, I... cut myself shaving.

795
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,310
You're getting confused again,
aren't you?

796
01:02:55,311 --> 01:03:00,311
Mom, I feel better
than I have in years.

797
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:04,027
[helicopter passing]

798
01:03:04,028 --> 01:03:06,529
[Marv] You were scared,
weren't you, Goldie?

799
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:09,240
Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.

800
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:12,077
So you hit the saloons,
the bad places,

801
01:03:12,078 --> 01:03:16,456
looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.

802
01:03:16,457 --> 01:03:19,209
I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you,

803
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:23,421
and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.

804
01:03:23,422 --> 01:03:26,424
Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...

805
01:03:26,425 --> 01:03:29,803
- Leave your hands off Nancy.
- ...and you could find anything.

806
01:03:29,804 --> 01:03:32,639
That coat looks like Baghdad.

807
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,642
So does your face. Take off!

808
01:03:35,643 --> 01:03:40,643
[groaning]

809
01:03:40,982 --> 01:03:44,067
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

810
01:03:44,068 --> 01:03:48,071
[Marv] Kadie's is my kind of joint.

811
01:03:48,072 --> 01:03:50,240
Nancy's just getting
started with her gig,

812
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:52,409
but already the crowd's
breathing hard.

813
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,619
Plenty of nights
I've drooled over Nancy,

814
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:58,248
shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.

815
01:03:58,249 --> 01:04:00,917
But that's not
what I'm lookin' for tonight.

816
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:05,918
I'm looking for something
small and hairy.

817
01:04:08,509 --> 01:04:12,303
Take it easy, Weevil.
I'm here to do you a favor.

818
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:14,681
It's money in your pocket.

819
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:16,182
[grunts]

820
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:20,520
Spread the word. Tell him I've been
hitting the joints drunk off my butt,

821
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:25,521
shooting my mouth off,
crying over some hot babe named Goldie.

822
01:04:38,622 --> 01:04:40,081
What'll it be, Marv?

823
01:04:40,082 --> 01:04:43,043
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

824
01:04:43,044 --> 01:04:48,044
Sure, honey. You take it slow, now.

825
01:05:01,479 --> 01:05:04,647
[man] Most people think Marv is crazy.

826
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:08,151
He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.

827
01:05:08,152 --> 01:05:10,945
He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield,

828
01:05:10,946 --> 01:05:13,823
swinging an ax into somebody's face.

829
01:05:13,824 --> 01:05:18,328
Or in a Roman arena taking
a sword to other gladiators like him.

830
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:23,329
They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.

831
01:05:25,086 --> 01:05:27,962
Show's over, dickwad. Drink up.

832
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:32,963
That's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

833
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:38,640
Your killin' days are over, you
over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

834
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:43,641
[Marv] I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad.

835
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:48,687
[grunting]

836
01:05:51,654 --> 01:05:54,030
- [Marv] Take it off.
- What?

837
01:05:54,031 --> 01:05:56,533
A fine coat,
you're bleeding all over it.

838
01:05:56,534 --> 01:05:59,119
All right, it's all yours. Oh, God!

839
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,914
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

840
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:07,915
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

841
01:06:08,504 --> 01:06:13,504
So tell me, man. Who sent you?

842
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:16,052
I don't hear you giving me any names.

843
01:06:16,053 --> 01:06:19,722
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

844
01:06:19,723 --> 01:06:22,725
- [screams]
- [gunshot]

845
01:06:22,726 --> 01:06:27,726
[Marv] You keep holding out on me,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

846
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:36,318
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

847
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:41,119
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

848
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,580
Thanks again.

849
01:06:43,581 --> 01:06:48,418
[gunshot]

850
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:50,753
[Marv] Then the
damnedest thing happens.

851
01:06:50,754 --> 01:06:55,091
For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.

852
01:06:55,092 --> 01:06:57,510
Just need my medicine, is all.

853
01:06:57,511 --> 01:06:59,846
Bastard.

854
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:04,847
You're gonna pay
for what you did to me.

855
01:07:05,936 --> 01:07:07,520
Feel like talking, Louie?

856
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:10,106
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie?

857
01:07:10,107 --> 01:07:11,941
How many for the kill?

858
01:07:11,942 --> 01:07:16,942
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

859
01:07:17,114 --> 01:07:22,114
He'll never talk.

860
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:26,581
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

861
01:07:26,582 --> 01:07:30,543
[Marv] Connelly talks. They all talk.

862
01:07:30,544 --> 01:07:31,628
[bell tolls]

863
01:07:31,629 --> 01:07:33,755
[man] What have been
your sins, my son?

864
01:07:33,756 --> 01:07:36,507
[Marv] Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

865
01:07:36,508 --> 01:07:39,552
so I'll just fill you in
on the latest batch.

866
01:07:39,553 --> 01:07:42,639
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

867
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,807
You're speaking figuratively.

868
01:07:44,808 --> 01:07:49,479
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

869
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,065
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

870
01:07:52,066 --> 01:07:55,318
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

871
01:07:55,319 --> 01:08:00,319
By way of a "for instance,"
I killed three men tonight.

872
01:08:01,325 --> 01:08:02,784
Tortured 'em first.

873
01:08:02,785 --> 01:08:07,163
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

874
01:08:07,164 --> 01:08:10,124
First two were minnows,
small-time messengers.

875
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:15,046
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

876
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:17,799
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

877
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,678
Just give me a damn name.

878
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,098
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck,

879
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:29,352
feeding me garbage like that.
It can't be that big.

880
01:08:29,353 --> 01:08:31,771
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

881
01:08:31,772 --> 01:08:34,774
It's all there. Find out for yourself.

882
01:08:34,775 --> 01:08:36,276
And while you're at it,

883
01:08:36,277 --> 01:08:41,277
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

884
01:08:42,616 --> 01:08:44,742
[Marv] Worth dying for.

885
01:08:44,743 --> 01:08:46,869
- Worth killing for.
- [gunshot]

886
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:49,289
Worth going to hell for.

887
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:49,790
Amen.

888
01:08:54,712 --> 01:08:57,672
His keys say the padre
drove a Mercedes,

889
01:08:57,673 --> 01:09:01,384
or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.

890
01:09:01,385 --> 01:09:05,471
Modern cars:
they all look like electric shavers.

891
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:10,472
[tires screeching]

892
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:16,357
Goldie. [grunts]

893
01:09:16,358 --> 01:09:21,358
Goldie! [grunts]

894
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:30,747
It couldn't be Goldie.

895
01:09:30,748 --> 01:09:35,001
It's my own fault, and nobody else 's,
that I got confused.

896
01:09:35,002 --> 01:09:38,963
I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.

897
01:09:38,964 --> 01:09:40,965
That wasn't Goldie back there.

898
01:09:40,966 --> 01:09:42,467
Goldie's dead,

899
01:09:42,468 --> 01:09:46,512
and that's the whole reason that
I've been doing what I've been doing.

900
01:09:46,513 --> 01:09:51,513
When you got a condition,
it's bad to forget your medicine.

901
01:09:53,103 --> 01:09:54,604
The cold thing,

902
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:58,524
it creeps into my gut and tells me
one more time it won't let go.

903
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:02,195
This is a bad place, this farm.

904
01:10:02,196 --> 01:10:05,573
- People have died here...
- [soft growling]

905
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:07,241
the wrong way.

906
01:10:07,242 --> 01:10:12,242
- [barking, growling]
- I don't want to fight, pooch.

907
01:10:15,459 --> 01:10:20,129
I got no gripe with you.

908
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,715
Easy, boy.

909
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:24,217
[dog whimpers]

910
01:10:24,218 --> 01:10:28,137
[Marv] No way I was gonna use
my gun on you, buddy.

911
01:10:28,138 --> 01:10:30,932
It's whoever owns you
I'm curious about,

912
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:34,852
because there's blood on your breath,
and I think I know what kind.

913
01:10:34,853 --> 01:10:39,853
So I sniff around to see what's buried.

914
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:46,527
Here we go.

915
01:10:48,283 --> 01:10:53,283
It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.

916
01:10:57,084 --> 01:11:02,084
I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.

917
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:05,633
Except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.

918
01:11:05,634 --> 01:11:09,679
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

919
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,348
You killed Goldie.

920
01:11:12,349 --> 01:11:15,560
It was... [grunts]

921
01:11:15,561 --> 01:11:17,770
[Marv] I blew it, Goldie.

922
01:11:17,771 --> 01:11:20,857
I found your killer,
but he was better than me.

923
01:11:20,858 --> 01:11:23,025
Too quiet, too quick.

924
01:11:23,026 --> 01:11:25,570
A killer born.

925
01:11:25,571 --> 01:11:30,571
Why didn't he finish the job?

926
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:44,881
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

927
01:11:44,882 --> 01:11:49,882
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

928
01:11:50,012 --> 01:11:53,222
The wolf just gets scraps.

929
01:11:53,223 --> 01:11:55,308
Bones.

930
01:11:55,309 --> 01:11:57,727
It's him.

931
01:11:57,728 --> 01:12:02,728
He... eats... people.

932
01:12:03,192 --> 01:12:06,777
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

933
01:12:06,778 --> 01:12:09,113
Just like they were steaks.

934
01:12:09,114 --> 01:12:11,532
Now he's got both of us.

935
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:15,536
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

936
01:12:15,537 --> 01:12:18,456
Just look at the heads on the wall.

937
01:12:18,457 --> 01:12:21,250
The heads on the wall.

938
01:12:21,251 --> 01:12:23,252
The heads on the wall.

939
01:12:23,253 --> 01:12:27,340
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

940
01:12:27,341 --> 01:12:31,427
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

941
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:34,347
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

942
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:39,348
[screaming] He made me watch!

943
01:12:46,777 --> 01:12:49,904
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

944
01:12:49,905 --> 01:12:53,824
[Marv] Dames. Sometimes all they
gotta do is let it out.

945
01:12:53,825 --> 01:12:57,119
And a few buckets later,
there's no way you'd know.

946
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,956
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

947
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:04,710
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

948
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:07,004
Any leads?

949
01:13:07,005 --> 01:13:10,675
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

950
01:13:10,676 --> 01:13:15,676
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking
out that hooker almost before I did.

951
01:13:15,722 --> 01:13:19,433
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

952
01:13:19,434 --> 01:13:21,644
The dead one.

953
01:13:21,645 --> 01:13:23,896
Goldie.

954
01:13:23,897 --> 01:13:26,440
I didn't know she was a hooker.

955
01:13:26,441 --> 01:13:31,441
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

956
01:13:31,572 --> 01:13:36,117
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

957
01:13:36,118 --> 01:13:37,994
Must have shown you quite a time.

958
01:13:37,995 --> 01:13:42,290
Quiet. There's a car coming.

959
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:47,291
- [horn honks]
- [man] Kevin!

960
01:13:47,671 --> 01:13:51,507
[Marv] All I've got is a face...
and a name.

961
01:13:51,508 --> 01:13:55,678
I'll see you later, Kevin.

962
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:56,223
[grunts]

963
01:14:01,935 --> 01:14:06,935
[panting] Let's go,

964
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:23,247
They're done checking the house.

965
01:14:23,248 --> 01:14:25,374
They're coming this way.

966
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:28,461
Bastards. I'll show them.

967
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:33,462
' [grunts]
- [thudding]

968
01:14:33,508 --> 01:14:37,678
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

969
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,473
No, don't shoot! Please.

970
01:14:40,474 --> 01:14:42,808
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

971
01:14:42,809 --> 01:14:45,353
He's unconscious and unarmed,

972
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:50,354
so there's no need to kill him.

973
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:56,906
Captain, the target,
there's no sign of him.

974
01:14:56,907 --> 01:14:59,492
- Here's a sign!
- [screaming]

975
01:14:59,493 --> 01:15:04,493
[grunting]

976
01:15:12,923 --> 01:15:17,923
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

977
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:27,937
[Marv] I keep coming back to that cop
I just killed and what he told me.

978
01:15:27,938 --> 01:15:30,815
I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille,

979
01:15:30,816 --> 01:15:33,442
so I took my time
with that son of a bitch.

980
01:15:33,443 --> 01:15:37,780
It wasn't till I showed him all those
pieces of himself that he said it.

981
01:15:37,781 --> 01:15:42,781
Just a name:
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.

982
01:15:43,537 --> 01:15:46,706
Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.

983
01:15:46,707 --> 01:15:51,293
Along the way, he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.

984
01:15:51,294 --> 01:15:55,214
He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.

985
01:15:55,215 --> 01:15:58,968
He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.

986
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:03,969
And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.

987
01:16:04,474 --> 01:16:09,474
I'm getting used to the idea. More
and more, I'm liking the sound of it.

988
01:16:10,647 --> 01:16:14,358
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.

989
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:16,318
What if I'm wrong?

990
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:20,489
I've got a condition.
I get confused sometimes.

991
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:24,410
And with Lucille dead,
I can't get my medicine.

992
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:26,746
What if I've imagined all of this?

993
01:16:26,747 --> 01:16:31,747
What if I've turned into what they've
always said I was gonna turn into?

994
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:34,587
A maniac.

995
01:16:34,588 --> 01:16:37,006
A psycho killer.

996
01:16:37,007 --> 01:16:40,259
Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.

997
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:45,260
I've gotta know for sure.

998
01:16:45,348 --> 01:16:49,935
The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.

999
01:16:49,936 --> 01:16:52,730
For an hour or so,
I ask around about Goldie.

1000
01:16:52,731 --> 01:16:55,608
I don't get any answers,
but I know I'm bound to.

1001
01:16:55,609 --> 01:16:57,818
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,

1002
01:16:57,819 --> 01:17:00,696
and if she was, she has roots here:

1003
01:17:00,697 --> 01:17:05,697
Friends, maybe even family.

1004
01:17:08,205 --> 01:17:13,205
You can't be Goldie. Goldie's dead.

1005
01:17:21,092 --> 01:17:25,763
[chuckles] Goldie. Yeah, sure, right.

1006
01:17:25,764 --> 01:17:29,892
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

1007
01:17:29,893 --> 01:17:32,561
No wonder I'm seeing things.

1008
01:17:32,562 --> 01:17:33,106
Bastard!

1009
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:39,735
[Marv chuckles]

1010
01:17:39,736 --> 01:17:41,737
He's crazy.

1011
01:17:41,738 --> 01:17:46,408
Hit him again, Wendy. Harder.

1012
01:17:46,409 --> 01:17:48,911
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

1013
01:17:48,912 --> 01:17:51,831
Because that's my name, you ape.

1014
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:56,293
Goldie was my sister. My twin sister.

1015
01:17:56,294 --> 01:18:01,294
I guess she was the nice one.

1016
01:18:04,928 --> 01:18:08,597
Goldie and the other six,
where are they?

1017
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:10,766
What did you do to them?

1018
01:18:10,767 --> 01:18:13,269
You crazy goddamn broad.

1019
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:15,271
Just take a look at this mug.

1020
01:18:15,272 --> 01:18:19,567
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

1021
01:18:19,568 --> 01:18:23,279
None of you would, but Goldie.

1022
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,574
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

1023
01:18:26,575 --> 01:18:31,575
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

1024
01:18:31,872 --> 01:18:36,872
But as soon as they had me for a fall
guy, they showed up, guns blazing.

1025
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,960
But they didn't get me, and I've been
killing my way to the truth ever since.

1026
01:18:42,549 --> 01:18:46,302
So, go ahead, doll.

1027
01:18:46,303 --> 01:18:51,303
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

1028
01:18:57,731 --> 01:18:59,982
Nuts.

1029
01:18:59,983 --> 01:19:04,983
OK, I'm glad we got
all that sorted out.

1030
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,740
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots!

1031
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:11,410
- That's my specialty!
- You sat there and took it,

1032
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:14,663
when you could've taken my gun away
any time you wanted to.

1033
01:19:14,664 --> 01:19:19,126
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

1034
01:19:19,127 --> 01:19:22,588
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

1035
01:19:22,589 --> 01:19:24,590
and I don't hurt girls.

1036
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:27,009
I need a pair of handcuffs.

1037
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:30,179
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

1038
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:34,141
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

1039
01:19:34,142 --> 01:19:37,186
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

1040
01:19:37,187 --> 01:19:40,606
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

1041
01:19:40,607 --> 01:19:43,150
I know that sounds crazy.

1042
01:19:43,151 --> 01:19:46,528
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

1043
01:19:46,529 --> 01:19:50,866
[Marv] Just like that, a Whopper of
a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap.

1044
01:19:50,867 --> 01:19:53,619
I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet,

1045
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:56,997
but she fires up two cigarettes
and hands me one,

1046
01:19:56,998 --> 01:19:58,666
and I taste her lipstick on it.

1047
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:03,379
And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.

1048
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:08,050
I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.

1049
01:20:08,051 --> 01:20:10,260
But she isn't Goldie.

1050
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:12,346
[Marv] Yeah, yeah. This'll do.

1051
01:20:12,347 --> 01:20:17,347
I'm gonna be needing a dozen two-foot
lengths of this rubber tubing...

1052
01:20:18,937 --> 01:20:22,439
and a spool of razor wire...

1053
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,568
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

1054
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:29,655
[man] Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

1055
01:20:29,656 --> 01:20:31,240
[Marv] You bet your ass.

1056
01:20:31,241 --> 01:20:35,577
[Wendy] She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

1057
01:20:35,578 --> 01:20:39,331
Why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

1058
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:44,332
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

1059
01:20:44,504 --> 01:20:49,133
I wasn't never
even able to buy a woman.

1060
01:20:49,134 --> 01:20:52,678
You know, the way I look.

1061
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:56,598
[Marv] I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.

1062
01:20:56,599 --> 01:20:59,643
It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.

1063
01:20:59,644 --> 01:21:03,939
I check the list:
rubber tubing, gas, saw,

1064
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:08,068
gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,

1065
01:21:08,069 --> 01:21:10,404
Gladys and my mitts.

1066
01:21:10,405 --> 01:21:15,405
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

1067
01:21:15,577 --> 01:21:17,077
Keep the engine runnin'.

1068
01:21:17,078 --> 01:21:21,915
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

1069
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:25,794
Kill him for me, Marv.

1070
01:21:25,795 --> 01:21:28,088
Kill him good.

1071
01:21:28,089 --> 01:21:33,089
I won't let you down, Goldie.

1072
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:48,317
[Marv] Heading downstairs
to the kitchen.

1073
01:21:48,318 --> 01:21:53,318
Getting himself a midnight snack,
and I can guess what kind.

1074
01:22:06,586 --> 01:22:09,797
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1075
01:22:09,798 --> 01:22:14,798
[Marv] Damn, he's slick.

1076
01:22:24,187 --> 01:22:28,524
Is that the best you can do, creep?

1077
01:22:28,525 --> 01:22:33,525
That's right.
Get personal, get close. I can take it.

1078
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:38,571
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

1079
01:22:41,704 --> 01:22:46,704
[Marv] I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.

1080
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:50,379
My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.

1081
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:54,299
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

1082
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,927
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

1083
01:22:56,928 --> 01:22:59,721
Oh, but I want to...

1084
01:22:59,722 --> 01:23:04,059
I'm sorry, kid, but I haven't
even started with this creep,

1085
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:08,230
and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.

1086
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:11,441
[Marv] God, I gotta tell you,
I'm good and bushed.

1087
01:23:11,442 --> 01:23:14,570
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

1088
01:23:14,571 --> 01:23:17,573
It's all that sawing and tying.

1089
01:23:17,574 --> 01:23:20,909
It's not as easy as it looks.

1090
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:23,078
Could have been a real mess around here

1091
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:28,079
if I didn't have that tubing
for tourniquets.

1092
01:23:28,084 --> 01:23:32,880
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

1093
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:37,881
to get the scent in the air, to get
that friend of yours to come running.

1094
01:23:41,848 --> 01:23:44,516
Well, what do you know?

1095
01:23:44,517 --> 01:23:47,060
Look who's here.

1096
01:23:47,061 --> 01:23:52,061
- Here he comes.
- [growling]

1097
01:23:55,445 --> 01:23:58,071
That's a good dog.

1098
01:23:58,072 --> 01:24:02,242
[Marv] He doesn't scream,
not even when the mutt's had its fill

1099
01:24:02,243 --> 01:24:04,912
and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.

1100
01:24:04,913 --> 01:24:09,041
Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.

1101
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:13,045
Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.

1102
01:24:13,046 --> 01:24:18,046
He never screams.

1103
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:22,304
I put in a call to Kadie 's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on

1104
01:24:22,305 --> 01:24:25,807
and meet me at her place.
She says, "Yes," like always.

1105
01:24:25,808 --> 01:24:28,435
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

1106
01:24:28,436 --> 01:24:31,480
Sure, Marv. Who's the babe?

1107
01:24:31,481 --> 01:24:34,441
There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.

1108
01:24:34,442 --> 01:24:37,236
Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up

1109
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:39,655
and I straightened him out but good.

1110
01:24:39,656 --> 01:24:43,408
It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.

1111
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:45,244
What do you want me to do with her?

1112
01:24:45,245 --> 01:24:49,957
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

1113
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:53,126
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

1114
01:24:53,127 --> 01:24:57,464
Hell, no. I like it here.

1115
01:24:57,465 --> 01:24:58,840
[belches]

1116
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:02,177
[Marv] I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit

1117
01:25:02,178 --> 01:25:04,096
so as not to get any attention.

1118
01:25:04,097 --> 01:25:08,433
My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.

1119
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:10,394
I owe you, Goldie.

1120
01:25:10,395 --> 01:25:12,854
I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.

1121
01:25:12,855 --> 01:25:15,941
So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose,

1122
01:25:15,942 --> 01:25:20,942
hell, I'll die laughing if I know
I've done this one thing right.

1123
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:27,703
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

1124
01:25:27,704 --> 01:25:32,704
[man on walkie] Keep a lookout.

1125
01:25:46,389 --> 01:25:51,389
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

1126
01:25:51,394 --> 01:25:56,394
The dog ate the rest.

1127
01:26:00,695 --> 01:26:04,990
Oh, my God. You monster.

1128
01:26:04,991 --> 01:26:07,826
You demon.

1129
01:26:07,827 --> 01:26:10,370
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

1130
01:26:10,371 --> 01:26:15,371
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

1131
01:26:16,586 --> 01:26:20,589
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

1132
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:23,633
It's not a real good idea
for you to talk about Goldie

1133
01:26:23,634 --> 01:26:26,386
that way while I'm around.

1134
01:26:26,387 --> 01:26:30,098
When he came to me...

1135
01:26:30,099 --> 01:26:34,269
he was a tormented boy.

1136
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:37,939
Tormented by guilt.

1137
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:41,860
I tried to counsel him.

1138
01:26:41,861 --> 01:26:46,281
But the eating,
it filled him with white light.

1139
01:26:46,282 --> 01:26:51,282
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

1140
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:54,456
What the hell do you know?

1141
01:26:54,457 --> 01:26:57,084
I know it's pretty
damn weird to eat people.

1142
01:26:57,085 --> 01:27:02,085
He didn't just eat their bodies,
he ate their souls.

1143
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:09,300
And I joined in.

1144
01:27:09,972 --> 01:27:13,308
They were all whores.

1145
01:27:13,309 --> 01:27:16,978
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

1146
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:21,979
And then your... Goldie
almost ruined everything.

1147
01:27:22,652 --> 01:27:24,903
She stayed in public places.

1148
01:27:24,904 --> 01:27:27,447
And then with you.

1149
01:27:27,448 --> 01:27:28,782
You were so convenient.

1150
01:27:28,783 --> 01:27:32,160
You'd broke a man's jaw
that very night.

1151
01:27:32,161 --> 01:27:34,788
Who would believe a thug like you?

1152
01:27:34,789 --> 01:27:36,456
Kevin killed her.

1153
01:27:36,457 --> 01:27:40,252
I ordered the police in for you,
but you wouldn't be caught.

1154
01:27:40,253 --> 01:27:41,795
You wouldn't stop.

1155
01:27:41,796 --> 01:27:46,466
And now he's dead and you're here to...

1156
01:27:46,467 --> 01:27:48,260
eliminate me.

1157
01:27:48,261 --> 01:27:53,261
Will that give you satisfaction,
my son?

1158
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:59,350
Killing a helpless old fart?

1159
01:28:00,356 --> 01:28:02,190
The killing, no.

1160
01:28:02,191 --> 01:28:05,735
No satisfaction.

1161
01:28:05,736 --> 01:28:10,736
Everything up until
the killing will be a gas.

1162
01:28:13,035 --> 01:28:17,330
Kevin...

1163
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:22,331
we're going home.

1164
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:27,670
You can scream now if you want to.

1165
01:28:33,181 --> 01:28:38,059
[Marv] It's beautiful, Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.

1166
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:41,146
And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I sent him to

1167
01:28:41,147 --> 01:28:44,900
must seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.

1168
01:28:44,901 --> 01:28:49,901
' [man] Freeze!
- [man 2] Oh, my God!

1169
01:28:53,826 --> 01:28:56,578
- [heart monitor beeping]
- [Marv groans] Jerks.

1170
01:28:56,579 --> 01:29:00,248
They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.

1171
01:29:00,249 --> 01:29:02,250
It's so stupid.

1172
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:06,296
Everybody knows what's coming,
but they go through the motions anyway.

1173
01:29:06,297 --> 01:29:08,423
What a waste of time.

1174
01:29:08,424 --> 01:29:13,094
Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.

1175
01:29:13,095 --> 01:29:17,057
Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.

1176
01:29:17,058 --> 01:29:21,853
After a while, I realize
it's not gonna be so easy as that.

1177
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:23,522
I'm on my feet for ten minutes

1178
01:29:23,523 --> 01:29:26,608
before the cops kick them out
from under me.

1179
01:29:26,609 --> 01:29:28,693
They don't ask me any questions.

1180
01:29:28,694 --> 01:29:33,240
They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.

1181
01:29:33,241 --> 01:29:35,325
And I keep spitting blood all over it

1182
01:29:35,326 --> 01:29:38,912
and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.

1183
01:29:38,913 --> 01:29:42,290
Then along comes this worm
assistant district attorney

1184
01:29:42,291 --> 01:29:46,127
who turns the recorder off and says
if I don't sign their confession,

1185
01:29:46,128 --> 01:29:47,963
they'll kill my mom.

1186
01:29:47,964 --> 01:29:51,591
I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.

1187
01:29:51,592 --> 01:29:54,636
From then on, it's the
circus everybody wants it to be.

1188
01:29:54,637 --> 01:29:59,140
They nail me for the works,
not just the people I did kill,

1189
01:29:59,141 --> 01:30:03,645
but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate,

1190
01:30:03,646 --> 01:30:05,981
and even Goldie.

1191
01:30:05,982 --> 01:30:10,982
The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.

1192
01:30:12,363 --> 01:30:15,448
Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away,

1193
01:30:15,449 --> 01:30:20,203
when I get my first surprise
in 18 months.

1194
01:30:20,204 --> 01:30:22,664
My only visitor.

1195
01:30:22,665 --> 01:30:25,625
I'm ready for anything but that scent.

1196
01:30:25,626 --> 01:30:30,626
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

1197
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:36,595
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

1198
01:30:36,596 --> 01:30:40,015
I... I got confused again.

1199
01:30:40,016 --> 01:30:44,978
Just seeing you like this.

1200
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:49,979
You can call me Goldie.

1201
01:30:56,532 --> 01:30:59,618
[Marv] She smells
like angels ought to smell.

1202
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:02,454
The perfect woman.

1203
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:05,540
The goddess.

1204
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,834
Goldie.

1205
01:31:07,835 --> 01:31:12,835
She says her name is Goldie.

1206
01:31:13,049 --> 01:31:16,676
They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.

1207
01:31:16,677 --> 01:31:21,222
They even throw in a brew. It's the
first I've had since back at Nancy's.

1208
01:31:21,223 --> 01:31:26,019
Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.

1209
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:28,897
And it's about damned time,
if you ask me.

1210
01:31:28,898 --> 01:31:31,691
"Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow..."

1211
01:31:31,692 --> 01:31:34,402
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

1212
01:31:34,403 --> 01:31:38,698
You heard the man. Hit it.

1213
01:31:38,699 --> 01:31:43,699
[sizzling]

1214
01:31:46,248 --> 01:31:51,248
Is that the best you can do,
you pansies?

1215
01:31:54,757 --> 01:31:55,369
[exhales]

1216
01:32:02,556 --> 01:32:07,556
He's gone.

1217
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:05,316
[banging on door]

1218
01:37:05,317 --> 01:37:09,195
Forget it, man. You can bang
on that door all night if you want to.

1219
01:37:09,196 --> 01:37:11,864
There is no way in hell
I'm letting you in.

1220
01:37:11,865 --> 01:37:15,368
[man] I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

1221
01:37:15,369 --> 01:37:19,747
Everything we've shared...
It has to mean something to you.

1222
01:37:19,748 --> 01:37:23,501
It meant plenty. Plenty of lost pay
on account of how nobody wants

1223
01:37:23,502 --> 01:37:27,630
to flirt with a waitress whose face is
all purple and swollen up with bruises.

1224
01:37:27,631 --> 01:37:29,424
I know you're angry, baby.

1225
01:37:29,425 --> 01:37:32,093
I forgive you for that
without you asking me to.

1226
01:37:32,094 --> 01:37:36,347
There's a difference between getting
honked off at a guy who's not so bad,

1227
01:37:36,348 --> 01:37:40,393
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

1228
01:37:40,394 --> 01:37:43,354
who skips out on a wife
he doesn't even tell you about

1229
01:37:43,355 --> 01:37:46,232
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

1230
01:37:46,233 --> 01:37:49,068
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

1231
01:37:49,069 --> 01:37:52,238
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

1232
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,532
That hurt, Shellie.

1233
01:37:54,533 --> 01:37:57,827
It's one thing for you
to play hard to get,

1234
01:37:57,828 --> 01:38:00,246
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

1235
01:38:00,247 --> 01:38:02,832
I am impossible to get.

1236
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:06,002
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help,

1237
01:38:06,003 --> 01:38:09,255
like... a shrink.

1238
01:38:09,256 --> 01:38:12,717
Get help and get lost.

1239
01:38:12,718 --> 01:38:14,093
[Jackie Boy] Open the door.

1240
01:38:14,094 --> 01:38:19,015
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

1241
01:38:19,016 --> 01:38:24,016
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

1242
01:38:24,772 --> 01:38:28,191
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

1243
01:38:28,192 --> 01:38:30,568
No! If he knew
that you were here with me,

1244
01:38:30,569 --> 01:38:35,323
- you don't know how bad this could get!
- This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

1245
01:38:35,324 --> 01:38:37,700
He's got four friends
out there in the hall,

1246
01:38:37,701 --> 01:38:40,411
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

1247
01:38:40,412 --> 01:38:45,412
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

1248
01:38:45,542 --> 01:38:50,542
Somebody! Jackie Boy, it's a
regular African love fest in here!

1249
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:54,759
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

1250
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,012
half the bench of the Basin City Blues
keeping me company.

1251
01:38:58,013 --> 01:39:00,223
You feel like taking them on?

1252
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:03,309
[Jackie Boy] You are teasing me, baby.

1253
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:07,021
Some of my best friends...

1254
01:39:07,022 --> 01:39:09,357
But you're really pushing my buttons.

1255
01:39:09,358 --> 01:39:12,026
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

1256
01:39:12,027 --> 01:39:15,071
I've been too polite to point out
that any time I want to,

1257
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:18,199
I could kick this
damn door to splinters.

1258
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,368
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

1259
01:39:20,369 --> 01:39:23,538
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

1260
01:39:23,539 --> 01:39:28,539
All right. All right, all right!

1261
01:39:29,294 --> 01:39:34,294
Troops, make yourself at home.

1262
01:39:41,431 --> 01:39:44,225
You brought your whole pack with you?

1263
01:39:44,226 --> 01:39:47,436
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

1264
01:39:47,437 --> 01:39:49,105
You're gonna love this, baby.

1265
01:39:49,106 --> 01:39:52,066
Call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

1266
01:39:52,067 --> 01:39:55,570
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

1267
01:39:55,571 --> 01:40:00,571
- and it's gonna be great.
- I ain't calling up nobody.

1268
01:40:04,163 --> 01:40:09,041
That's a man's shirt, and I'm
sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

1269
01:40:09,042 --> 01:40:13,421
You got somebody's
love stink all over you.

1270
01:40:13,422 --> 01:40:16,883
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

1271
01:40:16,884 --> 01:40:20,428
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

1272
01:40:20,429 --> 01:40:24,557
He flew out the window just
as soon as he heard you were coming,

1273
01:40:24,558 --> 01:40:29,145
- 'cause you scared him so bad.
- [Jackie Boy chuckling]

1274
01:40:29,146 --> 01:40:33,232
[Jackie Boy] You think
I have no feelings at all.

1275
01:40:33,233 --> 01:40:35,443
[Shellie] If you're gonna slug me,

1276
01:40:35,444 --> 01:40:38,571
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

1277
01:40:38,572 --> 01:40:42,742
[Jackie Boy] There you go,
lying about me again,

1278
01:40:42,743 --> 01:40:45,578
right in front of my friends.

1279
01:40:45,579 --> 01:40:49,582
I have never hit a woman in my life.

1280
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:52,043
[smack]

1281
01:40:52,044 --> 01:40:54,503
[laughing]

1282
01:40:54,504 --> 01:40:56,714
That's showing her, man.

1283
01:40:56,715 --> 01:41:01,260
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

1284
01:41:01,261 --> 01:41:04,388
- Baby, we're here to have a good time.
- Yeah.

1285
01:41:04,389 --> 01:41:08,267
- I gotta take a leak.
- [men laughing]

1286
01:41:08,268 --> 01:41:10,686
Wish you'd dropped by earlier,
Jackie Boy.

1287
01:41:10,687 --> 01:41:14,482
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

1288
01:41:14,483 --> 01:41:17,068
Could've seen
what a real man looks like.

1289
01:41:17,069 --> 01:41:20,947
There you go, after my nuts again.

1290
01:41:20,948 --> 01:41:23,282
- But I forgive you.
- [scoffs]

1291
01:41:23,283 --> 01:41:25,409
I'm a generous guy.

1292
01:41:25,410 --> 01:41:29,956
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

1293
01:41:29,957 --> 01:41:33,376
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

1294
01:41:33,377 --> 01:41:36,587
My temper you don't
have to worry about.

1295
01:41:36,588 --> 01:41:41,588
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

1296
01:41:41,593 --> 01:41:44,595
I've been told.

1297
01:41:44,596 --> 01:41:47,723
Oh, you don't wanna be hitting the
streets dressed like that.

1298
01:41:47,724 --> 01:41:52,724
It's a jungle out there. You got
a couple phone calls you ought to make.

1299
01:41:56,900 --> 01:42:01,821
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

1300
01:42:01,822 --> 01:42:04,782
Answer me!

1301
01:42:04,783 --> 01:42:06,826
Oh, I don't need this grief.

1302
01:42:06,827 --> 01:42:11,827
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

1303
01:42:12,874 --> 01:42:17,837
You ever so much as talk to Shellie
again, you even think her name,

1304
01:42:17,838 --> 01:42:21,549
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

1305
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:26,095
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

1306
01:42:26,096 --> 01:42:31,096
Yeah? You already made
a big mistake yourself.

1307
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:36,314
You didn't flush.

1308
01:42:36,315 --> 01:42:41,315
[muffled yelling]

1309
01:43:17,397 --> 01:43:22,397
[belching, gagging]

1310
01:43:26,823 --> 01:43:29,116
Troops, get outta here.

1311
01:43:29,117 --> 01:43:34,117
No questions, damn it.
No questions. Now!

1312
01:43:47,594 --> 01:43:51,722
[helicopter hovering, sirens wailing]

1313
01:43:51,723 --> 01:43:53,933
[Shellie] Dwight, what did you do?

1314
01:43:53,934 --> 01:43:56,894
I just gave him a taste
of his own medicine.

1315
01:43:56,895 --> 01:43:59,271
I don't think he'll
be bothering you again.

1316
01:43:59,272 --> 01:44:03,275
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

1317
01:44:03,276 --> 01:44:07,279
Dwight, he was from a while back,

1318
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,741
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

1319
01:44:10,742 --> 01:44:14,578
And it was only
'cause I felt sorry for him.

1320
01:44:14,579 --> 01:44:17,039
And it was only once.

1321
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,999
I've done some dumb things.

1322
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,210
Seeing how
I'm one of those dumb things,

1323
01:44:21,211 --> 01:44:23,963
I can't give you
too hard a time about that.

1324
01:44:23,964 --> 01:44:28,300
But this guy, he's a menace.

1325
01:44:28,301 --> 01:44:33,097
He might kill somebody
if I don't stop him.

1326
01:44:33,098 --> 01:44:35,933
- I'll call you later.
- No, don't go!

1327
01:44:35,934 --> 01:44:38,811
[Dwight] Shellie shouts something
I can't make out

1328
01:44:38,812 --> 01:44:41,480
over the racket
of a passing police 'copter.

1329
01:44:41,481 --> 01:44:43,732
- Stop!
- It sounds like "stop,"

1330
01:44:43,733 --> 01:44:47,486
but I can't be sure.
It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,

1331
01:44:47,487 --> 01:44:49,572
but I can't go home
and forget about it,

1332
01:44:49,573 --> 01:44:52,992
and let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.

1333
01:44:52,993 --> 01:44:57,993
They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight: a woman's blood.

1334
01:44:58,665 --> 01:45:02,168
Damn it, Dwight. Damn it.

1335
01:45:02,169 --> 01:45:05,171
You fool.

1336
01:45:05,172 --> 01:45:07,423
You damned fool.

1337
01:45:07,424 --> 01:45:09,550
[Dwight] I cut my Caddy
across the park

1338
01:45:09,551 --> 01:45:13,012
to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.

1339
01:45:13,013 --> 01:45:17,683
I'm speeding. That's a good way
to get yourself noticed.

1340
01:45:17,684 --> 01:45:21,395
If you're a murderer with a new face
who's one fingerprint check away

1341
01:45:21,396 --> 01:45:24,356
from the fast track
to the gas chamber like I am,

1342
01:45:24,357 --> 01:45:27,485
the last thing you want
is to get noticed.

1343
01:45:27,486 --> 01:45:28,861
[siren wailing]

1344
01:45:28,862 --> 01:45:33,365
I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if I did,

1345
01:45:33,366 --> 01:45:36,535
there's the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.

1346
01:45:36,536 --> 01:45:41,536
Do I try to talk my way out of this, or
do I take this cop down and risk it all?

1347
01:45:42,542 --> 01:45:46,545
Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.

1348
01:45:46,546 --> 01:45:49,215
- Watch it, Jack!
- [horn honking]

1349
01:45:49,216 --> 01:45:54,216
- [tires screeching]
- [siren wailing]

1350
01:45:55,347 --> 01:45:57,223
Cops! They're right on our ass!

1351
01:45:57,224 --> 01:46:00,643
Not for long. Not where we're headed.

1352
01:46:00,644 --> 01:46:03,771
[Dwight] My gut tightens up.

1353
01:46:03,772 --> 01:46:08,772
Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.

1354
01:46:10,695 --> 01:46:12,613
The cop shuts off his siren.

1355
01:46:12,614 --> 01:46:15,950
He knows he's not the law,
not in Old Town.

1356
01:46:15,951 --> 01:46:20,246
The ladies are the law here,
beautiful and merciless.

1357
01:46:20,247 --> 01:46:22,456
If you've got cash
and play by the rules,

1358
01:46:22,457 --> 01:46:26,168
they'll make all your dreams come true.
But if you cross 'em,

1359
01:46:26,169 --> 01:46:28,629
you're a corpse.

1360
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:33,509
- Squad car's long gone.
- I called it. Was I right?

1361
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:38,510
You're always right, Jack. None of us
ever doubted you for a second.

1362
01:46:39,099 --> 01:46:42,101
But I heard things about these girls.

1363
01:46:42,102 --> 01:46:44,645
Things they'd done to guys
who got out of line.

1364
01:46:44,646 --> 01:46:49,646
Who's out of line? Ha!

1365
01:46:53,363 --> 01:46:58,363
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

1366
01:46:58,743 --> 01:47:00,953
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

1367
01:47:00,954 --> 01:47:05,874
Aw, sweetheart, I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

1368
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:09,587
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

1369
01:47:09,588 --> 01:47:13,090
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

1370
01:47:13,091 --> 01:47:15,301
I don't do talk jobs, either.

1371
01:47:15,302 --> 01:47:20,302
Baby doll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

1372
01:47:20,473 --> 01:47:24,226
I've been beat up
every time I turn around.

1373
01:47:24,227 --> 01:47:26,437
But the day I get
turned down by a hooker

1374
01:47:26,438 --> 01:47:29,982
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with,

1375
01:47:29,983 --> 01:47:34,983
well, there's only
so much a man can take.

1376
01:47:35,155 --> 01:47:37,364
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

1377
01:47:37,365 --> 01:47:39,825
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

1378
01:47:39,826 --> 01:47:42,411
The Amigo's a fag joint.

1379
01:47:42,412 --> 01:47:46,457
[Jackie Boy] Are you having
a good time humiliating me like this

1380
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:51,003
for no damn reason at all?

1381
01:47:51,004 --> 01:47:54,548
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckervvoods

1382
01:47:54,549 --> 01:47:57,176
since they showed up
with that cop behind them.

1383
01:47:57,177 --> 01:48:00,346
Everything's under control.

1384
01:48:00,347 --> 01:48:02,473
Enjoy the show.

1385
01:48:02,474 --> 01:48:05,517
[Dwight] There's no use
arguing with her.

1386
01:48:05,518 --> 01:48:08,479
The ladies are their own enforcers.

1387
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:11,565
How's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

1388
01:48:11,566 --> 01:48:14,860
- Not right now, Gail.
- Ooh.

1389
01:48:14,861 --> 01:48:17,029
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

1390
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:20,866
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

1391
01:48:20,867 --> 01:48:23,994
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

1392
01:48:23,995 --> 01:48:26,955
Damn it, Gail. Not right now.

1393
01:48:26,956 --> 01:48:31,043
Those clowns down the way,
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

1394
01:48:31,044 --> 01:48:33,212
One of them thinks he is.

1395
01:48:33,213 --> 01:48:35,339
He's outta control.

1396
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:38,842
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

1397
01:48:38,843 --> 01:48:43,055
Us helpless little girls.

1398
01:48:43,056 --> 01:48:47,226
[Dwight] All kinds of death is about
to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us,

1399
01:48:47,227 --> 01:48:50,854
and still it's hard
to take my eyes off her.

1400
01:48:50,855 --> 01:48:53,524
Us girls are safe
as we can be, Lancelot.

1401
01:48:53,525 --> 01:48:56,193
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

1402
01:48:56,194 --> 01:48:58,737
from seeing what Miho can do.

1403
01:48:58,738 --> 01:49:03,738
And she's been aching
for some practice.

1404
01:49:03,743 --> 01:49:08,539
[Dwight] She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.

1405
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:12,668
- Deadly little Miho.
- [girl] You're running out of alley.

1406
01:49:12,669 --> 01:49:17,256
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

1407
01:49:17,257 --> 01:49:19,758
[Jackie Boy] You're
a sassy little thing.

1408
01:49:19,759 --> 01:49:24,759
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

1409
01:49:24,889 --> 01:49:29,017
[Dwight] The trap is set,
locked and ready to spring.

1410
01:49:29,018 --> 01:49:32,730
So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.

1411
01:49:32,731 --> 01:49:36,442
So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?

1412
01:49:36,443 --> 01:49:39,737
They haven't killed anybody
I know about.

1413
01:49:39,738 --> 01:49:44,491
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

1414
01:49:44,492 --> 01:49:45,993
And they won't.

1415
01:49:45,994 --> 01:49:48,203
[Dwight] Why this rotten feeling?

1416
01:49:48,204 --> 01:49:51,582
Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.

1417
01:49:51,583 --> 01:49:55,878
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

1418
01:49:55,879 --> 01:49:58,964
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

1419
01:49:58,965 --> 01:50:02,259
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

1420
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:06,096
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

1421
01:50:06,097 --> 01:50:08,640
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

1422
01:50:08,641 --> 01:50:11,310
[grunts]

1423
01:50:11,311 --> 01:50:14,104
You wanna see it?

1424
01:50:14,105 --> 01:50:18,317
You wanna see what I got? Huh?

1425
01:50:18,318 --> 01:50:22,780
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

1426
01:50:22,781 --> 01:50:27,201
You seen this one?

1427
01:50:27,202 --> 01:50:28,577
Get in the car.

1428
01:50:28,578 --> 01:50:33,578
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

1429
01:50:44,803 --> 01:50:45,415
[gasping]

1430
01:50:50,809 --> 01:50:54,186
Oh, God, no!

1431
01:50:54,187 --> 01:50:56,563
This is crazy!

1432
01:50:56,564 --> 01:51:01,564
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

1433
01:51:06,991 --> 01:51:08,116
Go ahead.

1434
01:51:08,117 --> 01:51:11,453
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1435
01:51:11,454 --> 01:51:14,039
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

1436
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:19,040
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

1437
01:51:20,672 --> 01:51:24,550
I got you right where I want you.

1438
01:51:24,551 --> 01:51:27,719
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

1439
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:32,720
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

1440
01:51:33,977 --> 01:51:34,477
Yeesh.

1441
01:51:43,403 --> 01:51:46,238
This isn't funny.

1442
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:49,867
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

1443
01:51:49,868 --> 01:51:53,871
Every one of you is gonna burn.

1444
01:51:53,872 --> 01:51:56,164
[Dwight] She's just playing with you.

1445
01:51:56,165 --> 01:52:00,377
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

1446
01:52:00,378 --> 01:52:04,047
Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

1447
01:52:04,048 --> 01:52:09,048
I told you to shut up.

1448
01:52:12,849 --> 01:52:15,225
I can't see.

1449
01:52:15,226 --> 01:52:18,812
What's happening?

1450
01:52:18,813 --> 01:52:21,273
I can't see.

1451
01:52:21,274 --> 01:52:24,109
I can't hear anything.

1452
01:52:24,110 --> 01:52:27,613
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

1453
01:52:27,614 --> 01:52:32,614
Yeah. Make it quick, will you?

1454
01:52:33,161 --> 01:52:38,161
[Dwight] She doesn't
quite chop his head off.

1455
01:52:38,708 --> 01:52:43,708
She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.

1456
01:52:43,713 --> 01:52:45,505
Then it's straight to business:

1457
01:52:45,506 --> 01:52:49,468
Stretching corpses out on the floor
and going through their pockets,

1458
01:52:49,469 --> 01:52:54,181
divvying up cash when they find it. I'm
fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.

1459
01:52:54,182 --> 01:52:56,099
His wallet is packed.

1460
01:52:56,100 --> 01:53:00,145
MasterCard, Discover,
Platinum American Express,

1461
01:53:00,146 --> 01:53:02,481
and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties

1462
01:53:02,482 --> 01:53:06,485
that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.

1463
01:53:06,486 --> 01:53:10,781
Then I find an atom bomb.

1464
01:53:10,782 --> 01:53:13,200
Jackie Boy,

1465
01:53:13,201 --> 01:53:18,201
you son of a bitch.

1466
01:53:19,999 --> 01:53:22,834
There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket,

1467
01:53:22,835 --> 01:53:26,046
I couldn't quite
make out what she said.

1468
01:53:26,047 --> 01:53:28,548
I thought Shellie said "stop."

1469
01:53:28,549 --> 01:53:31,468
She said "cop."

1470
01:53:31,469 --> 01:53:34,346
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.

1471
01:53:34,347 --> 01:53:37,933
Iron Jack, the papers call him.

1472
01:53:37,934 --> 01:53:42,934
A goddamn hero cop.

1473
01:53:42,939 --> 01:53:47,526
It's held for years, the shaky truce.
The cops get a slice of the profits

1474
01:53:47,527 --> 01:53:50,153
and free entertainment
when they throw a party.

1475
01:53:50,154 --> 01:53:52,823
The girls administer
their own brand of justice.

1476
01:53:52,824 --> 01:53:57,824
They get to defend their own tun'.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood

1477
01:53:58,121 --> 01:54:02,582
and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling, they send him packing,

1478
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:05,335
but they send him back alive.

1479
01:54:05,336 --> 01:54:07,546
That's the rules.

1480
01:54:07,547 --> 01:54:09,506
That's the truce.

1481
01:54:09,507 --> 01:54:12,050
The cops stay out.

1482
01:54:12,051 --> 01:54:15,178
That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.

1483
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:18,515
Old Town will be left wide open.

1484
01:54:18,516 --> 01:54:20,475
It'll be war.

1485
01:54:20,476 --> 01:54:24,062
The streets will run red with blood.

1486
01:54:24,063 --> 01:54:26,189
Women's blood.

1487
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:31,190
The cops! The mob! Things are gonna
go back to the way they used to be!

1488
01:54:31,738 --> 01:54:35,657
The hell they will! We got guns.

1489
01:54:35,658 --> 01:54:37,826
We'll fight the cops and the mob

1490
01:54:37,827 --> 01:54:40,579
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

1491
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:43,040
- We'll go to war.
- [Dwight] Don't be stupid.

1492
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:46,418
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

1493
01:54:46,419 --> 01:54:49,629
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

1494
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:51,089
I'll hide the bodies.

1495
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:54,676
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

1496
01:54:54,677 --> 01:54:57,262
The cops know Rafferty came here.

1497
01:54:57,263 --> 01:55:00,098
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

1498
01:55:00,099 --> 01:55:02,392
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

1499
01:55:02,393 --> 01:55:05,312
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check.

1500
01:55:05,313 --> 01:55:07,439
Get that out of my face
or I'll smack ya.

1501
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:11,568
Who do you think you are,
giving orders?

1502
01:55:11,569 --> 01:55:14,362
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

1503
01:55:14,363 --> 01:55:17,157
You got what you wanted out of me!

1504
01:55:17,158 --> 01:55:20,535
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

1505
01:55:20,536 --> 01:55:24,831
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

1506
01:55:24,832 --> 01:55:29,169
[Dwight] Miho moves to my back.

1507
01:55:29,170 --> 01:55:31,797
One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.

1508
01:55:31,798 --> 01:55:35,550
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

1509
01:55:35,551 --> 01:55:38,845
It'll be the bad old days
all over again.

1510
01:55:38,846 --> 01:55:41,598
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

1511
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:45,685
They won't be watching the roads. Not
yet, they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

1512
01:55:45,686 --> 01:55:48,021
If I don't make it,
you can have your war.

1513
01:55:48,022 --> 01:55:53,022
- Get that gun out of my face now!
- Ah!

1514
01:55:53,277 --> 01:55:53,821
Bastard!

1515
01:55:59,784 --> 01:56:03,995
I forgot how quick you are.

1516
01:56:03,996 --> 01:56:05,747
[Dwight] My warrior woman.

1517
01:56:05,748 --> 01:56:08,458
She almost yanks my head clean off,

1518
01:56:08,459 --> 01:56:11,837
shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.

1519
01:56:11,838 --> 01:56:15,382
An explosion that blasts away
the dull, gray years

1520
01:56:15,383 --> 01:56:20,383
between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.

1521
01:56:20,555 --> 01:56:23,431
A hardtop with a decent engine.

1522
01:56:23,432 --> 01:56:27,853
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

1523
01:56:27,854 --> 01:56:31,106
I'll always love you, baby.

1524
01:56:31,107 --> 01:56:36,107
Always... and never.

1525
01:56:42,994 --> 01:56:45,036
[Dwight] Where'd you find that heap?

1526
01:56:45,037 --> 01:56:48,748
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

1527
01:56:48,749 --> 01:56:52,377
Gail? Um, unless there's something else
you want me to do,

1528
01:56:52,378 --> 01:56:54,421
you think maybe I could go home?

1529
01:56:54,422 --> 01:56:58,675
All this blood and stuffs got me
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

1530
01:56:58,676 --> 01:57:00,927
Sure, Becky, go home.

1531
01:57:00,928 --> 01:57:03,805
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

1532
01:57:03,806 --> 01:57:06,766
They'll never fit in that trunk.

1533
01:57:06,767 --> 01:57:10,979
Not like this, they won't. Miho.

1534
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:14,983
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!
You'll catch cold if you don't.

1535
01:57:14,984 --> 01:57:19,984
[sword cutting]

1536
01:57:23,326 --> 01:57:27,037
Yeesh.

1537
01:57:27,038 --> 01:57:29,539
Hey, Becky. Gail said no calls.

1538
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:33,543
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

1539
01:57:33,544 --> 01:57:38,544
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

1540
01:57:38,674 --> 01:57:39,286
Hey, Mom?

1541
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:46,723
[Dwight] Dizzy dames.
What were they thinking,

1542
01:57:46,724 --> 01:57:49,935
sticking me with a beat-up bucket
of bolts like this?

1543
01:57:49,936 --> 01:57:52,771
We were barely able to get
the trunk closed as it was,

1544
01:57:52,772 --> 01:57:54,481
we packed it so tight.

1545
01:57:54,482 --> 01:57:59,444
There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,

1546
01:57:59,445 --> 01:58:04,445
out where anybody
who cares to look will see him.

1547
01:58:04,575 --> 01:58:09,454
Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.

1548
01:58:09,455 --> 01:58:14,455
It'll help.

1549
01:58:35,773 --> 01:58:40,773
It's got you smoking there, bud.

1550
01:58:44,699 --> 01:58:47,993
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

1551
01:58:47,994 --> 01:58:50,203
You're dead.

1552
01:58:50,204 --> 01:58:54,499
I'm just imagining this,
so shut the hell up.

1553
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:59,500
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

1554
01:58:59,505 --> 01:59:04,505
It's got you hearing things.
It's got your nerves shot.

1555
01:59:05,261 --> 01:59:07,679
It's got you smoking.

1556
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:11,766
You know it's true. [wheezing]

1557
01:59:11,767 --> 01:59:16,767
Nobody ever really quits.

1558
01:59:17,064 --> 01:59:21,901
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

1559
01:59:21,902 --> 01:59:26,902
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

1560
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:32,370
Will you look at that?

1561
01:59:32,371 --> 01:59:37,167
Ooh! Those hookers let you down.
[giggles]

1562
01:59:37,168 --> 01:59:42,168
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

1563
01:59:42,381 --> 01:59:46,718
You sucker for the babes, you.

1564
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:49,721
You ain't even
gonna make it to the pits.

1565
01:59:49,722 --> 01:59:52,974
You shut the hell up. I'll make it.

1566
01:59:52,975 --> 01:59:56,394
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

1567
01:59:56,395 --> 01:59:58,229
Watch it!

1568
01:59:58,230 --> 02:00:00,982
[horn honking]

1569
02:00:00,983 --> 02:00:03,068
Ah, this is great.

1570
02:00:03,069 --> 02:00:06,529
Just like being in a buddy movie.

1571
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:11,530
- Shut up!
_ [Jackie Boy laughing]

1572
02:00:11,744 --> 02:00:15,747
[siren wailing]

1573
02:00:15,748 --> 02:00:20,748
Boy, you're screwed,
you're out, you're finished.

1574
02:00:21,128 --> 02:00:23,463
Stick a fork in it.

1575
02:00:23,464 --> 02:00:27,092
You're swirling around
the bottom of the bowl,

1576
02:00:27,093 --> 02:00:30,512
nose-diving down the pipe.

1577
02:00:30,513 --> 02:00:32,639
It's over.

1578
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:35,266
You're flushed.

1579
02:00:35,267 --> 02:00:38,269
[Dwight] I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

1580
02:00:38,270 --> 02:00:42,357
Sure, he's an asshole.

1581
02:00:42,358 --> 02:00:45,068
Sure, he's dead.

1582
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:48,780
Sure, I'm just imagining
that he's talking.

1583
02:00:48,781 --> 02:00:52,909
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

1584
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:56,454
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

1585
02:00:56,455 --> 02:00:58,748
Not in this heap.

1586
02:00:58,749 --> 02:01:02,794
Pull over!

1587
02:01:02,795 --> 02:01:06,381
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

1588
02:01:06,382 --> 02:01:08,925
Tough call.

1589
02:01:08,926 --> 02:01:12,178
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

1590
02:01:12,179 --> 02:01:16,474
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

1591
02:01:16,475 --> 02:01:18,810
My hand moves all on its own,

1592
02:01:18,811 --> 02:01:23,811
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

1593
02:01:25,025 --> 02:01:30,025
- I don't know what to do.
- Better stop. You're making him mad.

1594
02:01:31,407 --> 02:01:36,407
Whatever you say.

1595
02:01:41,292 --> 02:01:46,292
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

1596
02:01:46,505 --> 02:01:51,505
I'm the designated driver.

1597
02:01:55,014 --> 02:02:00,014
Well, you're driving
with a busted tail light.

1598
02:02:03,481 --> 02:02:08,481
I'll let you off with a warning.

1599
02:02:13,365 --> 02:02:14,824
What next?

1600
02:02:14,825 --> 02:02:19,078
[thunder crashes]

1601
02:02:19,079 --> 02:02:23,875
[Dwight] The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.

1602
02:02:23,876 --> 02:02:27,003
I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.

1603
02:02:27,004 --> 02:02:30,381
A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.

1604
02:02:30,382 --> 02:02:33,843
Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,

1605
02:02:33,844 --> 02:02:38,844
I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a...

1606
02:02:49,401 --> 02:02:51,694
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

1607
02:02:51,695 --> 02:02:55,490
Clear the streets. We're in lockdown.

1608
02:02:55,491 --> 02:02:58,243
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

1609
02:02:58,244 --> 02:03:03,244
Not tonight.

1610
02:03:03,999 --> 02:03:07,669
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

1611
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:10,004
Your cause is lost.

1612
02:03:10,005 --> 02:03:11,673
We know everything.

1613
02:03:11,674 --> 02:03:15,969
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1614
02:03:15,970 --> 02:03:20,970
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1615
02:03:21,058 --> 02:03:24,269
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1616
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:28,398
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1617
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:32,777
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1618
02:03:32,778 --> 02:03:37,778
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1619
02:03:37,866 --> 02:03:42,579
by facilitating
the process of transition,

1620
02:03:42,580 --> 02:03:47,580
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1621
02:03:48,210 --> 02:03:50,878
Son of a bitch! I know you.

1622
02:03:50,879 --> 02:03:55,879
I have suffered your kind before,
the dregs of Sin City.

1623
02:03:56,093 --> 02:03:58,177
I serve a new master now,

1624
02:03:58,178 --> 02:04:03,099
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1625
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:08,100
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1626
02:04:08,606 --> 02:04:12,233
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1627
02:04:12,234 --> 02:04:15,069
You don't know him.

1628
02:04:15,070 --> 02:04:18,406
My man will find a way.

1629
02:04:18,407 --> 02:04:22,493
He always finds a way.

1630
02:04:22,494 --> 02:04:25,038
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1631
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:28,625
and going on about
how they got it so bad.

1632
02:04:28,626 --> 02:04:31,002
This is a fine, grand country.

1633
02:04:31,003 --> 02:04:33,338
Guiding light
of the modern world, it is.

1634
02:04:33,339 --> 02:04:36,424
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1635
02:04:36,425 --> 02:04:40,428
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1636
02:04:40,429 --> 02:04:43,431
[woman] Beats blowing up
airports and churches

1637
02:04:43,432 --> 02:04:47,352
without shite to show for it.

1638
02:04:47,353 --> 02:04:50,521
Yeesh.

1639
02:04:50,522 --> 02:04:55,485
- You find something, Murphy?
- Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

1640
02:04:55,486 --> 02:04:57,612
It's all bent up.

1641
02:04:57,613 --> 02:05:00,490
What's this stuck in it?

1642
02:05:00,491 --> 02:05:05,491
Bloody hell. It's the bullet.

1643
02:05:11,794 --> 02:05:16,794
You son of a bitch! Bastard!

1644
02:05:16,882 --> 02:05:19,175
[Dwight] They weren't cops, these four.

1645
02:05:19,176 --> 02:05:21,052
They were mercenaries.

1646
02:05:21,053 --> 02:05:23,471
If they were hired
by who I think they were,

1647
02:05:23,472 --> 02:05:26,557
the bad times
haven't even started yet.

1648
02:05:26,558 --> 02:05:31,558
And everything seemed
to be going so well.

1649
02:05:42,074 --> 02:05:47,074
[man] Remember, we don't have to deliver
every last inch of the man, Brian.

1650
02:05:47,413 --> 02:05:52,413
[Brian] You got a good point there,
Ronnie. Lend me your knife.

1651
02:05:53,085 --> 02:05:56,254
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1652
02:05:56,255 --> 02:06:01,255
I'm at the bone, all right?

1653
02:06:01,468 --> 02:06:06,431
There we go.

1654
02:06:06,432 --> 02:06:11,432
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1655
02:06:11,645 --> 02:06:15,356
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1656
02:06:15,357 --> 02:06:20,357
use your imagination, OK?

1657
02:06:28,162 --> 02:06:30,580
[Dwight] Silence, now.

1658
02:06:30,581 --> 02:06:33,040
No air to breathe.

1659
02:06:33,041 --> 02:06:38,041
Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.

1660
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:42,800
Let it in. Let it fill your lungs.

1661
02:06:42,801 --> 02:06:47,388
They were counting on you
and you blew it.

1662
02:06:47,389 --> 02:06:51,809
Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.

1663
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:55,563
Miho, you're an angel.

1664
02:06:55,564 --> 02:06:57,523
You're a saint.

1665
02:06:57,524 --> 02:06:59,817
You're Mother Teresa.

1666
02:06:59,818 --> 02:07:01,986
You're Elvis.

1667
02:07:01,987 --> 02:07:04,906
You're God.

1668
02:07:04,907 --> 02:07:09,907
If you'd shown up ten minutes earlier,
we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.

1669
02:07:10,329 --> 02:07:14,832
Dwight, they got Gail!

1670
02:07:14,833 --> 02:07:18,085
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1671
02:07:18,086 --> 02:07:21,005
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1672
02:07:21,006 --> 02:07:23,508
We gotta find out who it is
and rescue Gail.

1673
02:07:23,509 --> 02:07:25,635
First, we gotta get
Jackie Boy's head

1674
02:07:25,636 --> 02:07:29,931
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this situation blows wide open.

1675
02:07:29,932 --> 02:07:34,932
Miho, I hope to hell you left
one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1676
02:07:43,237 --> 02:07:46,405
[Dwight] I let him know
I'm not fooling around.

1677
02:07:46,406 --> 02:07:51,160
[groaning]

1678
02:07:51,161 --> 02:07:51,705
We talk.

1679
02:08:02,256 --> 02:08:06,133
Stay smart. Stay cool.

1680
02:08:06,134 --> 02:08:09,679
It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.

1681
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:12,890
Sometimes, that means dying.

1682
02:08:12,891 --> 02:08:16,477
Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.

1683
02:08:16,478 --> 02:08:18,938
There they are. What do we do?

1684
02:08:18,939 --> 02:08:23,939
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1685
02:08:29,575 --> 02:08:31,784
[Dwight] Jackie Boy's head
is close to me

1686
02:08:31,785 --> 02:08:36,785
I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.

1687
02:08:40,919 --> 02:08:44,755
Get the head! Get the head!

1688
02:08:44,756 --> 02:08:49,756
I got it! I got it!

1689
02:08:53,473 --> 02:08:58,473
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1690
02:09:00,314 --> 02:09:03,107
[Dwight] I can't tell
if Miho is alive or dead,

1691
02:09:03,108 --> 02:09:08,108
but I'm on my feet and every ounce
of me wants to get some killing done.

1692
02:09:10,782 --> 02:09:15,161
[man] You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1693
02:09:15,162 --> 02:09:19,999
[shooting]

1694
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,126
[man] Brave lad.

1695
02:09:22,127 --> 02:09:26,297
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1696
02:09:26,298 --> 02:09:30,176
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1697
02:09:30,177 --> 02:09:35,177
You got the drop on me, love.
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1698
02:09:41,897 --> 02:09:44,941
I got to come clean
with you, sweetheart.

1699
02:09:44,942 --> 02:09:49,942
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1700
02:09:50,030 --> 02:09:52,740
You see, I'm not
too fond of shootin'.

1701
02:09:52,741 --> 02:09:55,910
It's my preference to blow things up.

1702
02:09:55,911 --> 02:09:58,162
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1703
02:09:58,163 --> 02:10:02,208
and seen all the parts
flying off people,

1704
02:10:02,209 --> 02:10:06,212
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1705
02:10:06,213 --> 02:10:11,213
Here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1706
02:10:11,843 --> 02:10:15,429
But it's me knife
I'll be doing you with.

1707
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:18,099
You killed me mates.

1708
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:23,100
Someone shoulda told ya: never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

1709
02:10:24,523 --> 02:10:27,525
[Dwight] Deadly little Miho.

1710
02:10:27,526 --> 02:10:30,361
You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.

1711
02:10:30,362 --> 02:10:33,239
- She twists the blade.
- [crunching]

1712
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:37,868
He feels it.

1713
02:10:37,869 --> 02:10:41,706
I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.

1714
02:10:41,707 --> 02:10:46,252
I grab poor Dallas's earphone and make
the most important call of my life.

1715
02:10:46,253 --> 02:10:51,253
First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill.

1716
02:10:51,299 --> 02:10:56,299
The big, fat kill.

1717
02:11:01,059 --> 02:11:05,563
_ [gasping]
- [crunching]

1718
02:11:05,564 --> 02:11:08,524
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1719
02:11:08,525 --> 02:11:10,443
What, are you kidding me, man?

1720
02:11:10,444 --> 02:11:14,238
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night and not get tired of it.

1721
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:15,781
I mean, the man's an artist.

1722
02:11:15,782 --> 02:11:20,782
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1723
02:11:20,954 --> 02:11:22,997
Your skin is perfect.

1724
02:11:22,998 --> 02:11:26,208
Your nerves, responsive.

1725
02:11:26,209 --> 02:11:27,626
Beautiful.

1726
02:11:27,627 --> 02:11:31,797
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1727
02:11:31,798 --> 02:11:34,759
[gasping]

1728
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:38,512
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1729
02:11:38,513 --> 02:11:42,308
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1730
02:11:42,309 --> 02:11:44,643
They got what's left
of that cop we killed.

1731
02:11:44,644 --> 02:11:47,813
Mob's gonna turn it over to the chief,
cops'll mow us down.

1732
02:11:47,814 --> 02:11:49,732
We gotta cut a deal.

1733
02:11:49,733 --> 02:11:53,402
You little bitch! You sold us out!

1734
02:11:53,403 --> 02:11:56,489
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1735
02:11:56,490 --> 02:12:00,785
You gotta out a deal with these people.
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1736
02:12:00,786 --> 02:12:03,662
You'll get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1737
02:12:03,663 --> 02:12:06,248
It wasn't your mom!

1738
02:12:06,249 --> 02:12:09,460
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1739
02:12:09,461 --> 02:12:12,254
It was the money,
you stupid little bitch!

1740
02:12:12,255 --> 02:12:16,175
Sure, there's money. Sure, you
could've moved my mom into Old Town

1741
02:12:16,176 --> 02:12:19,053
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1742
02:12:19,054 --> 02:12:21,263
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1743
02:12:21,264 --> 02:12:26,102
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me: a way out.

1744
02:12:26,103 --> 02:12:28,062
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1745
02:12:28,063 --> 02:12:29,814
Your neck.

1746
02:12:29,815 --> 02:12:34,026
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

1747
02:12:34,027 --> 02:12:38,155
[Becky screams]

1748
02:12:38,156 --> 02:12:43,156
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1749
02:12:43,829 --> 02:12:47,373
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1750
02:12:47,374 --> 02:12:51,377
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1751
02:12:51,378 --> 02:12:54,338
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1752
02:12:54,339 --> 02:12:59,339
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1753
02:12:59,803 --> 02:13:02,346
Hey.

1754
02:13:02,347 --> 02:13:05,015
Hey.

1755
02:13:05,016 --> 02:13:06,600
Nobody. I don't see nobody.

1756
02:13:06,601 --> 02:13:10,437
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1757
02:13:10,438 --> 02:13:13,399
There's something wrapped around it.

1758
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:17,528
- Some kind of note.
- [Manute] Give it to me.

1759
02:13:17,529 --> 02:13:21,866
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1760
02:13:21,867 --> 02:13:26,495
- It's starting to hurt.
- Out back. Everyone. Bring the women.

1761
02:13:26,496 --> 02:13:29,748
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1762
02:13:29,749 --> 02:13:34,295
McCarthy, you fool.

1763
02:13:34,296 --> 02:13:36,213
Hey.

1764
02:13:36,214 --> 02:13:39,717
Guys?

1765
02:13:39,718 --> 02:13:41,468
Oh...

1766
02:13:41,469 --> 02:13:44,305
[thunder crashes]

1767
02:13:44,306 --> 02:13:48,601
[Dwight] Dozens of them,
armed to the teeth.

1768
02:13:48,602 --> 02:13:52,855
I'm outnumbered, outgunned.

1769
02:13:52,856 --> 02:13:57,856
But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.

1770
02:13:58,528 --> 02:14:01,238
They can't surround me.

1771
02:14:01,239 --> 02:14:06,239
Sometimes, you can beat the odds with
the careful choice of where to fight.

1772
02:14:10,457 --> 02:14:13,042
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1773
02:14:13,043 --> 02:14:17,963
- Just give me the woman.
- [muffled talking]

1774
02:14:17,964 --> 02:14:20,049
Shut up.

1775
02:14:20,050 --> 02:14:22,927
Dwight, don't do this.

1776
02:14:22,928 --> 02:14:27,598
- Wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1777
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:32,599
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade. She's all yours.

1778
02:14:41,655 --> 02:14:46,575
Now, if you'll explain to me why we
shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1779
02:14:46,576 --> 02:14:50,663
Dwight, what have you done?

1780
02:14:50,664 --> 02:14:54,041
Exactly what I had to.

1781
02:14:54,042 --> 02:14:59,042
Every step of the way.

1782
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:02,299
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1783
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:07,300
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1784
02:15:16,690 --> 02:15:19,358
[Dwight] Where to fight
counts for a lot.

1785
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:23,946
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you no good.

1786
02:15:23,947 --> 02:15:28,117
But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.

1787
02:15:28,118 --> 02:15:33,118
No! McCarthy, you shit!

1788
02:15:33,498 --> 02:15:37,459
The girls all know the score.

1789
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:39,336
No escape,

1790
02:15:39,337 --> 02:15:43,090
no surrender, no mercy.

1791
02:15:43,091 --> 02:15:47,344
We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em.

1792
02:15:47,345 --> 02:15:49,638
Every last one.

1793
02:15:49,639 --> 02:15:53,934
Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,

1794
02:15:53,935 --> 02:15:57,938
not because it'll make
the world a better place.

1795
02:15:57,939 --> 02:16:00,190
We need a heap of bloody bodies

1796
02:16:00,191 --> 02:16:04,278
so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over
his charts of profits and losses,

1797
02:16:04,279 --> 02:16:09,279
he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.

1798
02:16:18,043 --> 02:16:20,961
They run out back.

1799
02:16:20,962 --> 02:16:25,962
Right on schedule.

1800
02:16:35,226 --> 02:16:39,980
Deadly, little Miho.

1801
02:16:39,981 --> 02:16:42,649
She gets her practice in.

1802
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:45,903
The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing

1803
02:16:45,904 --> 02:16:50,904
with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,

1804
02:16:51,368 --> 02:16:56,368
and so am I.

1805
02:16:58,750 --> 02:17:03,379
The fire, baby.
It'll burn us both.

1806
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:07,758
There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,

1807
02:17:07,759 --> 02:17:12,179
my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.

1808
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:15,140
You'll always be mine.

1809
02:17:15,141 --> 02:17:20,141
Always... and never.
