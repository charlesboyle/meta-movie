1
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:54,766
There are many places we could begin

2
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:57,767
the next chapter of
the legend of Ron Burgundy.

3
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,493
This is one such place.

4
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:07,603
However, we won't begin our tale here.

5
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:11,813
No, our story begins in
a place all newsmen dream of.

6
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:13,488
In New York City.

7
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:34,888
Ron Burgundy!

8
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,772
That lady's got an ass
like the Loch Ness Monster.

9
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,132
Thing is mysterious
and ever sought after.

10
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,485
Ron, aren't you going to
say something to him?

11
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,565
Hey, when you've got
an ass like the North Star,

12
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:48,407
wise men are going to want to follow it.

13
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,087
It was a time
before cell phones and steroids.

14
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:56,452
And for Ron and his now-wife Veronica,
life was good.

15
00:01:56,523 --> 00:02:00,448
The Tooth Fairy's exposed breast
made the child uncomfortable.

16
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:03,732
The bishop wore
buttless chaps to the bat mitzvah.

17
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:05,009
Bat mitzvah.

18
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:11,728
The garden gnome
had a normal-size penis.

19
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:15,768
Corningstone. Corningstone.

20
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:20,089
Oh, no! Oh, no!

21
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:22,126
They're coming in
through the back door!

22
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:23,250
Oh, no!

23
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:25,489
Oh, no!

24
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,166
Grab the children! Save the children!

25
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,689
Five, four...

26
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:32,524
- Have a great broadcast.
- You, too, darling.

27
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:36,050
Good evening.

28
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:39,252
This is the weekend edition of
WBC News at 6:30.

29
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:40,734
I'm Ron Burgundy.

30
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:42,328
And I'm Veronica Corningstone.

31
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:44,008
Our top story tonight.

32
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,608
The U.N. today announced
sanctions against...

33
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:49,688
When the broadcast is over,
send these two up to my office.

34
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:52,046
Time to make a change.

35
00:02:56,003 --> 00:03:00,565
Rumor has it that
after 35 years of manning the helm,

36
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:03,774
Mack Tannen
is thinking about stepping down.

37
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:04,844
That's right.

38
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:11,454
Do you think we could be getting
the <i>Nightly News,</i> Ron?

39
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,688
I think that's exactly
what's about to happen.

40
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,606
Oh, my God.
That's what's happening, isn't it?

41
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:17,685
- I'm hyperventilating.
- Yes, I see that.

42
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:21,134
Look at me.

43
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:23,524
You... Well.

44
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:25,611
I'm laughing like
a ventriloquist's dummy.

45
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,208
You are.

46
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,126
Let's stop that before we get in there.

47
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:30,693
Don't do that in there, darling.

48
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:34,412
Mr. Tannen, you are an inspiration, sir.

49
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:39,486
I've been doing the evening news now
for over 35 years.

50
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,765
- Done a hell of a job.
- Yes, sir.

51
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:43,083
A hell of a job!

52
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:44,773
I've gone through four wives.

53
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:48,609
I have six or seven kids that
I haven't got the time to tell I love them.

54
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:51,124
To be honest, they sound a little needy.

55
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:54,564
And I killed four men in Okinawa.

56
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:56,728
W.W. TWO.

57
00:03:57,923 --> 00:03:59,812
And that was two weeks ago.

58
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:05,493
The point is,
this is a very demanding job.

59
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:06,803
Yes.

60
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:11,764
But I'm close to thinking that
you may have what it takes.

61
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:15,171
Now, let me look at you.

62
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:19,489
Oh, my God.

63
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:22,652
Would it be wrong
to say you smell terrific?

64
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,452
- Ron, please!
- Okay.

65
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:26,527
What are you?

66
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:28,684
Finnish?

67
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:34,084
Oddly enough,
I'm 100% full-blown Mexican.

68
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,531
From the state of Oaxaca.

69
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:38,970
No, you're not, honey.

70
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,367
Hello, sir.

71
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:43,445
My heart is racing.

72
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:50,728
I just have to say,
this is super creepy and unorthodox.

73
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,570
You like-a da merchandise, huh?

74
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:58,884
Sorry.

75
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:02,054
All right.

76
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:09,366
We're about to make
network news history.

77
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,332
- Veronica.
- Yes?

78
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:17,253
You're going to be the first
female full-time network news anchor.

79
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:20,054
- Oh, my goodness!
- I knew it.

80
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:21,568
And you, Mr. Burgundy...

81
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:24,374
I'm going to be
the first lactose intolerant anchor.

82
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,611
- Mr. Burgundy.
- Yes?

83
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:28,248
You're fired.

84
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:29,928
Come again?

85
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:31,443
Fired.

86
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:35,644
You are the worst anchorman

87
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:38,127
I have ever seen.

88
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:41,574
But what did I do wrong?
Name one thing.

89
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:45,609
Korean soldiers
were fired upon in the DMZ!

90
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:47,893
Jeez, I am so sorry.

91
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:50,534
Someone put the story
in all capital letters,

92
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:52,731
and I thought I was supposed to yell it.

93
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:56,326
President Parter... Shit!

94
00:05:56,563 --> 00:06:00,613
I mean, President Carter
will speak at the summit Tuesday.

95
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:02,613
Tony, did I just curse?

96
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,731
Are you kidding me? Shit!

97
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:07,608
I mean... Shit. Shoot!

98
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:11,293
The slain Civil Rights leader
was eulogized...

99
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:15,811
Did you see that? Right on the lens!

100
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:17,649
Folks, I'm sorry.

101
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:20,488
I hold myself to
a high professional standard

102
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:23,214
and you shouldn't hear that language,
okay?

103
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:25,690
I'm having a shitty day. Fuck-stick!

104
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:29,093
Now, I know this is tricky,
given your relationship,

105
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,729
so I'm going to
give you the evening to think about it.

106
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:33,174
I forbid it!

107
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:37,134
You forbid it?
What? Who are you? Julius Caesar?

108
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:39,093
Who the hell is Julius Caesar?

109
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:41,165
You know I don't follow the NBA.

110
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:43,450
Look, I am so sorry
that this happened, Ron,

111
00:06:43,523 --> 00:06:46,003
but you and I,
we're partners, sweetheart.

112
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,008
And when something good
happens to me, it also happens to you.

113
00:06:50,363 --> 00:06:51,489
That's ridiculous!

114
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:53,611
It clearly just happened to you!

115
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:55,572
You... Be quiet.

116
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:57,330
Mom?

117
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,132
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Burgundy.

118
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:00,364
He no go to sleep.

119
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,133
Damn it, Lupita,
what have you been doing up there?

120
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:03,489
Eating nachos?

121
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:06,851
Mommy? Daddy?
Why are you yelling at each other?

122
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,250
Did Mom touch Dad's hair again?

123
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:12,054
Walter, honey,
why don't you just go to bed, all right?

124
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:14,404
Mommy and Daddy
are just having a discussion.

125
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:15,973
No! He needs to hear this.

126
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,565
He's six years old. He's a man.

127
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,567
Walter, listen to me.

128
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:22,327
Life isn't a fairy tale.

129
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:25,612
It's not a bunch of
jumping rope and grabbing ass.

130
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:27,049
It's complicated.

131
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:28,324
What do you want to do with your life?

132
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:29,689
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

133
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:32,249
I want to be an astronaut or a cowboy!

134
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:34,485
You're never going to be
any of those, okay?

135
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:35,644
Ron!

136
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,725
You've got to set the bar a lot lower.

137
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,568
Service industry.
Fry cook. Prison guard.

138
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:43,169
Maybe you're
a lighting guy at a porn shoot.

139
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:48,291
Which basically means you hold up
a flashlight while adults do things.

140
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:49,848
He is a child, Ron!

141
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:52,574
Nah, nah, nah!
He's got hair on his nugs.

142
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:54,247
He's old enough to hear this.

143
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:55,563
Your father is a wise man.

144
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,805
I will lock you in a closet!

145
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:00,574
Veronica, here's the bottom line.

146
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:03,371
It's a very simple decision.

147
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:08,443
It's either me or the job.

148
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:11,328
It doesn't have to be a choice, Ron.

149
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:13,333
Don't do this.

150
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:17,454
Don't throw away everything that
we've worked so hard for.

151
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,409
Me...

152
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:21,809
or the job.

153
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:40,611
Hello, and welcome to
the 3:10 Dolphin Show at Sea World.

154
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,731
Sponsored by British Petroleum.

155
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,569
B.P. Oil, nature's best friend.

156
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:48,692
And now, here's your host,
Ron Burgundy.

157
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:51,410
Good afternoon, everyone.

158
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:54,453
And welcome to
world-famous Sea World,

159
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:57,413
here in San Diago, California.

160
00:08:57,683 --> 00:09:02,291
Here's a fun fact, dolphins aren't fish.
They're mammals.

161
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,805
Here's another fun fact,

162
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:11,006
I haven't felt the loving embrace of
a human being in over three months.

163
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:18,245
I'm so lonely
I paid a hobo to spoon with me.

164
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:23,047
Let's bring out
our world-class trainers here,

165
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,693
Jesse and Paula.

166
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:28,285
Thank you. Thank you, Ron.

167
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:30,527
Sometimes I try to kiss 'em.

168
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,532
Ron Burgundy, everyone.

169
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:35,729
- I want to kiss you.
- No.

170
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,214
- Or I'll kiss your friend.
- No.

171
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:39,172
How about
the two trainers kiss each other?

172
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:40,893
What do you say?

173
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:46,367
So, let's say hello to the stars
of the show, Chippy and Roo-roo!

174
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:47,934
For your information,

175
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:51,405
Chippy was rehabilitated
and Roo-roo is an asshole.

176
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,450
Look, they're swimming
and doing tricks!

177
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:57,332
Folks, what do you expect?
They're dolphins.

178
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,528
What did you say?

179
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:02,492
Look at you, with that permanent smile.

180
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,691
You think you're so smart,
with your secret language.

181
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:06,527
You just fart out of the top of your head.

182
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:10,694
You're a punk, Ron Burgundy!

183
00:10:11,203 --> 00:10:14,332
Children and animals hate you,
Ron Burgundy!

184
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:17,174
I would eat dolphins if it was legal!

185
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,723
Unhand me, you buffoons!

186
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:24,247
All right, first,
you threw up in the shark tank.

187
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,690
Then you fed the seals a chicken gyro?

188
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:28,174
And now this?

189
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,291
You're fired, you washed-up drunk!

190
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:32,247
Guess what, Trevor?

191
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,172
Every morning
I get here a half hour early

192
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:36,894
and I sexually assault a starfish!

193
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:41,333
This is the end of the road.
I'm not turning back.

194
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,846
Well, I know it's not a pretty sight.

195
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:46,413
And you're gonna be the sole witness.

196
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:49,614
If you can't handle it,
you leave the room.

197
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,565
It's too late, Baxter.

198
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:56,370
I'm going the way of the ancient samurai

199
00:10:56,443 --> 00:11:00,289
who, when dishonored, would hang
themselves from a fluorescent light.

200
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:04,493
Goodbye, my sweet hairy prince.

201
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,490
Sweet cream on nipples!

202
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:14,887
Mr. Burgundy? Hello, I...

203
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:17,648
Oh, my God!

204
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:19,566
What the hell happened?

205
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,131
I tried to hang myself?

206
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:25,853
Because my life's a mess?

207
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:28,127
And I saw no other option?

208
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:32,368
I think you're telling the truth, but why
are you saying it like you're lying?

209
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,247
It was a call for help?

210
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:37,566
But it didn't work because I'm too heavy
and the ceiling lamp broke?

211
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:39,933
Something like that?

212
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:42,813
Yeah, I think you're telling the truth.

213
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:44,965
I am. That's what happened.

214
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:49,167
These are first-rate flapjacks.

215
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:54,052
I'm telling you, suicide makes you
hungry, I don't care what anyone says.

216
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:58,805
My name is Freddie Shapp, and I'm
a producer of a new kind of news.

217
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:01,570
We're starting a 24-hour news channel.

218
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,048
First of its kind!

219
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,933
GNN. The Global News Network.

220
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:12,574
That is without a doubt
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

221
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:16,246
You mean news
going 24 hours around the clock?

222
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:18,690
A channel that's never off,
in other words?

223
00:12:18,803 --> 00:12:22,125
Yeah. Yeah. Just 24 hours. It's...

224
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:25,965
No offense,
but you are a stupid asshole.

225
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:29,810
Mr. Burgundy,
I assure you we are 100% for real.

226
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,489
We've got state-of-the-art facilities
in Manhattan.

227
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:36,693
And Kench Allenby, multi-millionaire
and owner of Koala Airlines.

228
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,369
So glad he was acquitted of murder.

229
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:41,366
I'm a big Kench Allenby guy.

230
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:44,487
He's funding the whole network.
He believes in it.

231
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,566
I don't think you understand, Freddie.

232
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:52,492
My hero, Mack Tannen, told me I was
the worst journalist he'd ever seen.

233
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:55,771
I'm not good enough.

234
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:56,890
Here.

235
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,450
This is your first week's salary.

236
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:04,249
By the hymen of Olivia Newton-John!

237
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,248
What do you say, Ron?

238
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,926
I'll take the job.

239
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,725
And I swear I'll be number one again.

240
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:18,254
I'll take back my son,
restore my reputation,

241
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:20,530
and make everything right
with Veronica.

242
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,332
But more importantly,

243
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:26,567
I'm going to do what God
put Ron Burgundy on this Earth to do.

244
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:29,853
Have salon-quality hair
and read the news.

245
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,686
Ron... You've made my day.

246
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:36,084
I've got the best damn
news team in the world.

247
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:39,333
- Your call.
- I just have to find them.

248
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:51,609
San Diago. Looks like
we begin our search right here at home.

249
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:55,733
Last I heard, Champ Kind was fired
for being drunk on the air and saying,

250
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:59,649
"The only Olympic sport Filipinos
are good at is eating cats and dogs."

251
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:05,204
- Who loves chicken? You do!
- We do!

252
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:07,644
Delicious chicken
Swing on through

253
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,885
Meet the crew!

254
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:14,048
I'm local San Diego legend Champ Kind,
and I believe in two things.

255
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:15,090
Good chicken,

256
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:19,293
and that the census is a way for
the U.N. to make your children gay.

257
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:21,411
So come on by and grab a wing.

258
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:24,566
'Cause when you do,
you'll say, "Whammy!"

259
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:26,646
No Catholics or Jews admitted.

260
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:27,969
All right, there you go.

261
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:30,694
One Whammy Special
with Whammy slaw.

262
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:33,933
There's a used Band-Aid
in my coleslaw.

263
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,005
My gosh, let me take care of that.

264
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,485
Get out of here before I smash
your head in, you Commie bastard!

265
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:42,169
If you're from the census,
you take me off your list!

266
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:46,054
You never did have much
of a bedside manner, Champ.

267
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:48,091
Ron? Ron Burgundy?

268
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:50,370
- Get over here!
- How are you, friend?

269
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:52,764
God, I have longed for you.

270
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:54,288
It's good to see you, too.

271
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:55,853
This feels like home.

272
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:57,604
Are you all right?

273
00:14:57,683 --> 00:14:59,731
Yeah, I'm fine. Better now.

274
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:02,574
Okay, let's break the huddle here, huh?

275
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,008
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

276
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,892
You get back here!

277
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,124
Don't be weird!

278
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:10,930
So, anyway,
Harken sat me down, he said,

279
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:14,007
"Champ, you're a dangerous alcoholic,
a racist,

280
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,689
"and I don't think
you know a lick about sports."

281
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:20,449
And I said, "Ed, you dirty Polack,
it's 10:00 in the morning.

282
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:21,809
"Let's go have some drinks

283
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:24,966
"and go to a baseball game where
the Mexicans hit some touchdowns."

284
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:26,090
Then he fires me!

285
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:30,452
Fortunately, on the way out the door,
I fake a work injury.

286
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:32,446
With the settlement, I bought this place.

287
00:15:32,523 --> 00:15:34,730
Well, I'm glad to see
you landed on your feet, Champ.

288
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:37,447
Listen, can I ask you a question?

289
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:39,088
Sure. Anything.

290
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:41,008
Is this chicken?

291
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,926
Hell, no.

292
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,565
It's really impossible to turn a profit
if you serve real chicken.

293
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,811
Yeah. We use mainly bats.

294
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:49,884
- What?
- Yeah.

295
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:52,045
But the good quality kind.

296
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,166
That's the most horrible thing
I've ever heard.

297
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:55,210
Yeah?

298
00:15:55,283 --> 00:15:57,251
You got to do what you got to do, right?

299
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,451
So what you got to do
is serve fried bats?

300
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:02,214
Yep. Do you know what they call bats?

301
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:04,684
- Bats.
- "Chicken of the Cave."

302
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,731
No one calls them Chicken of the Cave.

303
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:08,214
Who's "they," by the way?

304
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:12,688
There's a guy I met named Paco,
sells bikers speed at the pier.

305
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,414
So that guy calls them
Chicken of the Cave.

306
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:16,484
Yeah.

307
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:17,849
That's not "they."

308
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:20,210
Why don't you have a bite
and stop judging it?

309
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,012
I'm not going to bite into a fried bat.

310
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,130
It's delicious.

311
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:24,967
It's all tendon. Look at it.

312
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:29,123
Was that a bat?

313
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,286
Chicken of the Cave.

314
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,093
What brings you here, Ron?

315
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,770
My friend, we've got a job.
In New York City.

316
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:38,447
Whammy! I'm in!

317
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:39,974
You've got yourself a sportscaster.

318
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:41,044
Great.

319
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:42,284
Denny!

320
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,043
Lock up!

321
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:47,013
Any idea where Brian Fantana is?

322
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,573
You haven't heard?

323
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,213
Fantana hit the big time.

324
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,765
Baby.

325
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:57,205
Yeah, that's it, play for me.
Just play around.

326
00:16:57,443 --> 00:17:00,094
Roll around and lift those legs up.

327
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:03,130
You are a hairy little thing, aren't you?

328
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:07,492
Yeah. I like what's happening!

329
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:10,374
That's it. Yeah. Yeah.

330
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,964
You little fuzzball, that's...

331
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:16,604
I got it.

332
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:20,203
It's not getting any better than that.

333
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:22,293
- That's brilliant!
- Yeah, yeah.

334
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:24,684
Hey, Brian,
you have any time for the little people?

335
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,404
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

336
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:36,254
- Hey, Brian.
- Champ! How you doing?

337
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,404
Hey!

338
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,894
- This is a...
- Cool it!

339
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:40,488
I can't believe...

340
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:42,167
It's great to see you!

341
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:44,769
Welcome. Welcome to my doj'.

342
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:46,727
This place is spectacular!

343
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:48,043
- It's amazing.
- A bit chaotic today.

344
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:51,605
We got the Cat Fancy cover coming out.
You know how that can be.

345
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,367
I've been living in a tent
for the last two years.

346
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:54,933
Yeah, this is not that.

347
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:56,493
We got a sauna in the kitchen.

348
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:59,931
A lot of people think that's weird,
but I keep wine in it.

349
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:02,574
I'm not a wine guy,
but I know you got to keep it hot.

350
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:04,566
And check this out.

351
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:06,372
This was fun.

352
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,611
We shot this over two weeks in Prague.

353
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:11,485
You know what they call cats?

354
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,324
- Chicken of the rail yard.
- No.

355
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:16,287
- What?
- Don't indulge him.

356
00:18:16,403 --> 00:18:17,973
- Yeah.
- There's a lot of meat.

357
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:19,488
But I love it.

358
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:22,487
And what's so great about it
is it's so damn true.

359
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:23,610
I hate Mondays!

360
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:25,772
I'm not a Monday guy.

361
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:27,607
Ron hates Mondays.

362
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:29,685
Hell, I'm not crazy about them, either.

363
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:32,004
I also don't like Tuesdays,
Wednesdays or Thursdays.

364
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:35,492
So why are you guys here, anyway?

365
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:39,488
Well, Brian, we're getting
the news team back together again.

366
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:40,530
Really?

367
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:42,850
And, of course,
we want to know if you'll join us.

368
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,368
Jeez, I don't know.

369
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:46,969
I kind of got the world by the tail here.

370
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,647
I don't know if I can.

371
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:49,804
Christ, I get it.

372
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,885
I mean, you're the Quincy Jones
of cat photographers.

373
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,294
Why would you leave all this?

374
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:57,687
Hey, Brian, I don't know if you heard,
but New York has all-nude strip clubs.

375
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:02,491
The question still remains...

376
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,453
Where's Brick Tamland?

377
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:07,367
You guys didn't hear?

378
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:08,888
No, what happened?

379
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:10,050
Brick's...

380
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:13,008
Dead.

381
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:24,174
Brick was lost at sea about a year ago.

382
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:26,769
Thought he saw a bird
and he swam out to pet it.

383
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,284
He never came back.

384
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:31,084
We all loved Brick,

385
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:33,689
even though he never had
a phone number,

386
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:37,085
or address or Social Security number.

387
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:40,804
In six years of working at the station,
he never cashed a paycheck.

388
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:42,009
That sweet Brick.

389
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,414
He was a sensitive man, though.

390
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:48,654
He told me he wanted to donate
his organs to science before he died,

391
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:51,323
so he could see where they ended up.

392
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:55,649
He'll long be remembered
and he'll be sorely missed.

393
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,372
Thank you, Reverend.

394
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:04,884
Come on!

395
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,168
- Brick was a great man.
- Really?

396
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:08,847
And I will miss him so much.

397
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:11,529
And I will not rest until
I find his killer.

398
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:12,968
- What?
- His killer?

399
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:16,126
It is hard for me
to believe that he is gone.

400
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:18,252
He's not gone.

401
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:21,573
I feel that I just saw him yesterday.

402
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:23,611
You were probably
talking to yourself in a mirror.

403
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,846
When I got the news...

404
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:30,166
I didn't even know
how to make sense out of it!

405
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:31,489
None of us understand!

406
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:33,612
Why? Why?

407
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:36,011
Why did you take him from us?

408
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,563
You're clearly standing in front of us,
Brick.

409
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,008
God damn you!

410
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:42,086
- Brick!
- Brick is dead!

411
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:43,972
- No, Brick's alive.
- Brick is dead!

412
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,374
- Look at him!
- He's not dead.

413
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:46,683
He's not dead, Brick.
You're not dead.

414
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:48,208
- You're Brick!
- Brick, it's you!

415
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:49,614
He's dead!

416
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:50,684
No!

417
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:53,004
You are Brick! Touch yourself.

418
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,450
- I am Brick?
- Yes!

419
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:57,725
- I'm alive?
- Yes!

420
00:20:58,363 --> 00:20:59,364
Of course.

421
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:00,854
Of course you are.

422
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:02,163
For heaven's sake.

423
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:04,968
You kind of want to slug him.
You want to slug him.

424
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:11,889
Do you remember
our Easter trip to San Francisco?

425
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:14,967
We got so drunk,
we put Brick in a refrigerator box

426
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:17,808
and threw him off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

427
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:19,849
I broke my back!

428
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:23,207
What about the time
that you dared Champ

429
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,570
to drink that beer stein full of Woolite?

430
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:28,044
He drained it faster than you could say,
"No, don't do it.

431
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:30,125
"That's the equivalent of
drinking poison."

432
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:35,286
Oh, Lord, I was in a six-month coma.

433
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:40,933
And they say from the neurological
damage, there's no way I live past 55!

434
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,885
You got three years left, my friend.

435
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:46,806
You're gonna die!

436
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,254
Hey, hey, remember?

437
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:54,487
I was by myself and I had that dream
about the orange tree.

438
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,453
But instead of oranges,
it had babies on it.

439
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:00,734
It was a baby tree!

440
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:03,649
Brick, how could we remember?
It's your dream.

441
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:07,170
I don't know. It's all the same thing.

442
00:22:09,123 --> 00:22:10,966
It's an interesting dream,

443
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:14,206
but we're telling stories involving
the entire news team from the past.

444
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:21,532
Or how about the time when I was born
and I came out of the vagina?

445
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:28,048
I was screaming,
"Here I come! Here I come, Mom!"

446
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:32,453
First off, Brick, I highly doubt
you remember your own birth.

447
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:35,367
And, once again, we weren't there.

448
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:40,413
Ron, I can't...

449
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,890
I can't stop laughing, Ron!

450
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,887
Put a pencil in his mouth.

451
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,323
It's okay.

452
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:48,163
There you go.

453
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,972
I'm okay now.

454
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:53,331
Man, this just feels right!
The news team is back!

455
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:57,893
Ron, Brian, Brick, me, even Baxter!

456
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:02,090
That old man is so little and hairy!

457
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:04,489
Hey, Ron, who's driving?

458
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:06,565
It's okay, it's on cruise control.

459
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:11,011
Who wants some chimichangas?

460
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,611
Best thing I ever did was install
this deep fryer in the 'bago.

461
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:17,454
Ron, why do you have
this bag of bowling balls

462
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,730
and this terrarium filled with scorpions?

463
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:22,773
- It's a long, crazy story!
- Hey, Ron.

464
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:25,363
Cruise control just regulates speed,
it doesn't steer.

465
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:27,968
Come again?

466
00:24:27,203 --> 00:24:30,013
Well, that is gonna
make one hell of a story.

467
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:40,447
The Big Apple. Ron Burgundy is back.

468
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:42,525
Why do they call it the Big Apple, Ron?

469
00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:45,607
Because New York has
an apple tree on every street.

470
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:51,332
Here we are. Welcome to GNN.

471
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:57,054
I don't know, Ron.
You sure about this place?

472
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,444
Guys, I know it's a bit of a mess,
but trust me,

473
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,453
everything will be ready
for the launch tomorrow.

474
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:06,488
And we've culled the whole country
for the best newsmen.

475
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:08,213
There's Curtis Knightfish from Houston.

476
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:09,569
Curtis Knightfish.

477
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,407
They don't get any better than that.

478
00:25:11,483 --> 00:25:14,566
And there's Diane Yahwea
from Carson City.

479
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,169
Diane Yahwea.
You know what they call her, right?

480
00:25:17,243 --> 00:25:18,927
"All the Way Yahwea."

481
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:20,368
She's my aunt.

482
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:22,571
And the best in the biz.

483
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:25,169
Jack Lime, out of Chicago.

484
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:29,328
Rumor is Allenby
is giving him one mil a year.

485
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:31,605
That's crazy.
Who's worth that kind of money?

486
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:36,566
Oh, my God!
He's absolutely magnificent!

487
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:39,649
I bet his poop smells like sandalwood.

488
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:41,327
Can I help you, guy?

489
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:42,928
What was that?

490
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:44,334
I said, "Can I help you, guy?"

491
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:46,810
What do you mean?

492
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:49,284
Well, you're staring at me, hotshot.

493
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:51,167
Do you want my autograph?

494
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:57,049
No, he was just explaining
who you were and I was looking at you.

495
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,332
And then he said something
and I was still looking at you.

496
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:09,084
Jack Lime is a great man!

497
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:12,683
Is that what I sound like when I talk?

498
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:17,843
Is there a problem?

499
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,891
No, no, no. No problem.

500
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:22,284
Well, you're making a face
like you got a problem.

501
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:24,286
I'm sorry that I'm making that face.

502
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:27,526
I don't mean to make a face
that seems like I have a problem.

503
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:28,934
I don't like that face!

504
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:30,732
You need to change it,
and change it quick.

505
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:32,134
Stop making that face.

506
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:34,012
Is this face better?

507
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,130
I don't like...

508
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:38,446
That new face is driving me crazy!
Change it, now!

509
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:39,809
You're getting him mad.

510
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:41,885
I only have so many faces.

511
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:45,454
I'm just grinding your gears, man.

512
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,332
Welcome to the station!

513
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:50,054
We're going to have
a good time together.

514
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:54,853
Oh, my God. That's vintage Jack Lime.

515
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,084
Come on, guys.

516
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:57,403
Let's go meet the boss.

517
00:26:57,763 --> 00:27:02,485
We'll have separate cameras for you,
and then sports and then weather.

518
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:05,004
Let me ask you this, Freddie,
how's the new head honcho?

519
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,644
Well, Linda Jackson
has a shelf full of Emmys.

520
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:13,213
She's as tough as nails.
And Linda loves to win.

521
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:15,252
Hey, Linda!

522
00:27:15,363 --> 00:27:18,128
I want to introduce you to Ron Burgundy.

523
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:21,487
Linda Jackson. How are you, my friend?

524
00:27:21,563 --> 00:27:22,564
Ron.

525
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:24,967
This is Linda Jackson.

526
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:26,968
Hello, Mr. Burgundy.

527
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:31,449
Black.

528
00:27:32,763 --> 00:27:34,731
- Black.
- Jesus, just stop, Ron.

529
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:39,283
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't know why I can't stop saying...

530
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:41,732
Black. The word "black."

531
00:27:41,803 --> 00:27:43,373
Hello, Mr. Burgundy.

532
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,372
- Black.
- Stop.

533
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:46,604
Black.

534
00:27:46,683 --> 00:27:47,844
Stop saying "black."

535
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:55,373
- Black. If I don't say it, I'll pass out.
- Stop saying it!

536
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:57,531
Donna, can you please
get me a cup of coffee?

537
00:27:57,603 --> 00:27:59,651
- Right away, Ms. Jackson.
- Thank you.

538
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:01,930
- Please be seated. Everyone.
- Sure.

539
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:03,488
Please be seated.

540
00:28:05,923 --> 00:28:09,848
Great. So I know that all of you
are aware that the news community

541
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:12,574
is laughing at what we're trying to do
here at 24-hour news.

542
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:14,247
But that is why they brought me in.

543
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:15,449
She's the best!

544
00:28:15,523 --> 00:28:17,764
You see, gentlemen, I don't lose.

545
00:28:17,883 --> 00:28:19,931
Listen, I feel like
I need to clear the air.

546
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:21,334
Please don't.

547
00:28:21,403 --> 00:28:23,326
I want to say,
on behalf of the entire news team,

548
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:28,250
we are huge supporters
of all African and Americans.

549
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:30,212
Veronica got so tan!

550
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:33,566
I remember the first
African and American I ever saw.

551
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:35,452
It's African-American.

552
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:37,173
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

553
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:39,769
Absolutely 100% positive? It isn't like...

554
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,004
Ron...

555
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,573
Fish and chips?

556
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:46,773
Hey, we're all the same on the inside,
stinky and pink.

557
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:47,883
When I was in high school,

558
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:49,925
me and my buddies
used to sneak in the girls' locker room.

559
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:51,454
We'd peek at the girls in the shower,

560
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:55,130
and I'd look at all of them,
no matter what color they were.

561
00:28:55,203 --> 00:28:56,250
So...

562
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:59,367
Jesus, this is the worst meeting
I've ever been in.

563
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:01,923
A black man follows me everywhere
when it's sunny.

564
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:04,165
Actually,
I think that's your shadow, Brick.

565
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,608
I call him Leon.

566
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:07,885
And if it's a cloudy day,
what happens to Leon?

567
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:08,964
He goes home.

568
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:10,010
It's your shadow.

569
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,130
He's talking about his shadow.

570
00:29:11,203 --> 00:29:13,774
Shut your damn mouths! Sit down!

571
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:17,404
What's he doing?

572
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:20,248
I think you scared him.
You can't shout at Brick.

573
00:29:20,363 --> 00:29:21,933
Is he all right?

574
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:24,763
Can you sing him
a soothing siren song?

575
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:26,129
Just a high melodic...

576
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:30,448
I'm not singing along with you.

577
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,485
Come on, Brick. Brick!

578
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,327
Linda has a balloon.

579
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:40,327
You better get him a balloon.

580
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,529
Is this for real, Freddie?

581
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:43,093
Linda, I'm sorry.

582
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:44,847
No, it's okay! It's okay.

583
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:47,130
So you have a black boss,
and it's freaking you out.

584
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,329
Is it freaking you out?

585
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:50,405
- A little bit, to be honest.
- You freaked out?

586
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:52,406
- Is it freaking you out?
- She's got a knife!

587
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:54,572
I don't give a shit!

588
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:56,771
We're not all here
to hold hands and sing Kumbaya.

589
00:29:57,283 --> 00:29:58,569
Black.

590
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:02,848
So as long as you guys get numbers,
we are gonna get along just fine.

591
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:06,411
Now, if you don't, I am gonna be icy.

592
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:07,848
And unpleasant, you dig?

593
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:10,654
I dig. We all dig.

594
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,004
I like to dig.

595
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:15,889
One time I went digging for treasure
and I found a half a body.

596
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,767
Get out of my office!

597
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:22,007
I'm telling you, you can't give an inch
in those situations,

598
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,972
and I think
we held our ground pretty firmly.

599
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:25,204
Guys.

600
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:28,571
Guys, we got you an apartment
on the Upper East Side

601
00:30:28,683 --> 00:30:30,253
and a whole new wardrobe.

602
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:33,372
That's wonderful!
When do we begin our broadcast?

603
00:30:33,443 --> 00:30:34,888
Well, the big launch is tomorrow

604
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:36,567
- at 12:00 noon.
- Okay.

605
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:40,568
You guys are slotted
for the 2:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. slot.

606
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:44,092
What? That's the graveyard shift!

607
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,093
"I ain't afraid of no ghost."

608
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:48,365
Come on, it's going to be great.

609
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:50,491
Let's get your keys. Come on!

610
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:53,730
Is there booze in the apartment?

611
00:30:53,803 --> 00:30:55,692
Of course there's gonna be booze.
Of course.

612
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:19,254
It won't stop.

613
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:22,846
Sometimes it stops,
but then it starts again.

614
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:27,807
What are you doing, Chani? Answer it!

615
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,044
Hi. Yes, let me transfer you.

616
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,692
Your job is to answer the phones.

617
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:36,604
I'm getting ready for Secret Santa.
When is that again?

618
00:31:36,683 --> 00:31:39,732
It's at Christmastime.
When else would it be?

619
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:45,365
I'm Brick. I was dead last week.

620
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:47,129
I'm Chani.

621
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:50,527
I like the place between
your head and your body.

622
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:52,493
I like your hair.

623
00:31:53,883 --> 00:31:55,612
It looks like wet popcorn.

624
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:57,693
Thank you.

625
00:31:57,763 --> 00:32:00,414
Would you like to see the smile that
I use when I pose for photographs?

626
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:01,684
Yes, please.

627
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:06,485
Do you want to see the face I make
when I see a snake made out of candy?

628
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:07,764
Yes.

629
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:12,044
That's good.

630
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,652
What's your favorite time of day?

631
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:15,884
Now.

632
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:18,807
What's your favorite time of day?

633
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,528
A minute ago.

634
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:02,251
Surprise! Big daddy's back.

635
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,489
Ron.

636
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:06,568
What are you doing here?

637
00:33:06,643 --> 00:33:09,408
I'm over at GNN.
I'm living in the city again.

638
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:12,164
I really wish that
you would have called first.

639
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,894
Look, it doesn't matter
whose fault the break-up was, okay?

640
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:16,408
I was stubborn.

641
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:21,125
You were like a mentally ill whore
having PMS from the 1800s.

642
00:33:21,203 --> 00:33:22,967
What's your point, Ron?

643
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:27,049
The point is I'm back home.

644
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:29,604
And I want to spend the rest of my life...

645
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:31,208
Honey, who is it?

646
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:39,608
Hi, Ron. I'm Gary, Veronica's lover.

647
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:51,087
So, is that a gift for me, Ron?

648
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,325
No, it's not.

649
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:55,644
It's for Walter.

650
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:56,930
Okay.

651
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:59,291
So when were you going to
tell me about Gary?

652
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:01,206
Ron. You walked out on me.

653
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:04,093
What did you expect me to do?

654
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:07,492
Ron. This is awkward, I know.

655
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:10,886
I'm sitting here with your wife.
We make love.

656
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:14,372
I'm this close to shooting
a flare gun at your dick.

657
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:15,569
Ron!

658
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:17,925
So what does this Gary do for a living?

659
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:19,448
Have you done
a background check on him?

660
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:20,934
Gary is actually

661
00:34:21,003 --> 00:34:24,450
one of the most successful
psychologists in all of Manhattan, Ron.

662
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:25,570
Really sweet.

663
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:27,533
Are you reading my mind right now?

664
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:30,607
Ron, do you even know
what a psychologist is?

665
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:33,213
Fuck you.

666
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:35,210
Ron!

667
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:36,808
- It's okay.
- You stop that!

668
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:38,214
He's externalizing. That's okay.

669
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:40,331
- No, it's not okay.
- He's mad.

670
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:44,294
You knew I was going to throw that
punch 'cause you're reading my mind!

671
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,211
Mom! I'm home!

672
00:34:47,283 --> 00:34:48,694
- Hey, little guy.
- Hey, darling.

673
00:34:48,763 --> 00:34:50,572
- Hi, Walter.
- Hey, Dad.

674
00:34:51,443 --> 00:34:52,729
I missed you!

675
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,404
Walter, your father has a gift for you.

676
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:59,005
I have a gift specifically for you, Walter.

677
00:35:00,003 --> 00:35:01,164
There you go.

678
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:02,449
Yes, Gary.

679
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,486
Okay, that's actually for me, Walter.

680
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:11,770
No, it's not. It's for Walter.

681
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:13,248
It's a superhero costume.

682
00:35:13,523 --> 00:35:14,729
What is it?

683
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:17,649
It's "Lace Man."
It's a brand new superhero.

684
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:20,084
I'm going to be Lace Man!

685
00:35:20,163 --> 00:35:21,927
Look, Ron. Joint custody isn't easy.

686
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:26,247
But what we need to do is rally around
this little guy right now, okay?

687
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:27,774
That's never gonna happen.

688
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,254
Excuse me?

689
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:31,644
Because you, Veronica,
are unfit to be a mother!

690
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:35,250
Need I remind you
that you took that child to a cock fight?

691
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:37,172
- The game of champions!
- I'm Lace Man!

692
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:38,728
He had the time of his life!

693
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,726
He came home splattered in blood!

694
00:35:40,803 --> 00:35:43,693
He picked eight winning cocks.
It's never been done!

695
00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:45,492
You have never tried
to connect with Walter.

696
00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:49,404
All right, let's keep it civil
in front of the boy.

697
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:53,010
It's bad enough his mother
likes to go down on rodeo clowns.

698
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,165
- Okay, you know what, out!
- All right. Get your things! Let's go.

699
00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:56,210
Fine. I'm out of here.

700
00:35:56,283 --> 00:35:58,092
- Don't have to tell me twice.
- Get your things.

701
00:35:58,163 --> 00:36:00,643
- We'll see you guys later.
- Yes, you will.

702
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:03,494
Goodbye, Dad! Thanks for the present.

703
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:06,294
Goodbye, Walter, my little man.

704
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:08,885
You promise to do good in school,
okay?

705
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:09,964
Okay.

706
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,249
And stay away from the he-shes...

707
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:12,449
- Ron!
- down in the Bowery.

708
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:14,446
Ron, I don't think that's appropriate.

709
00:36:14,523 --> 00:36:16,252
I'll tell you, those fellas,

710
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:20,049
they got the looks, they got the curves,
they got the chi-chi's,

711
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:22,846
and then at some point
during the evening,

712
00:36:22,923 --> 00:36:25,847
you reach down below the belt
looking to get a little muffellita,

713
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:29,086
and you get a handful of
the battle of the bulge.

714
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:30,774
You hear what I'm saying, Walter?

715
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:32,163
Yes, I do.

716
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:36,004
Ron, it was nice meeting you.
I think it's time for you to go.

717
00:36:36,643 --> 00:36:37,974
Ron!

718
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:40,333
You knew!

719
00:36:40,403 --> 00:36:42,292
You anticipated that
because you're reading my mind!

720
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:43,444
That confirms it!

721
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,368
There's Lime!

722
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:56,293
Look at him. He's a goddamn prince!

723
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:59,767
Man, there's just something about him,
you know?

724
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,652
I'd give anything to be friends with him.

725
00:37:02,123 --> 00:37:04,364
I don't see what the big deal is,
you know.

726
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:05,808
He's not that great.

727
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:09,009
What did you say?

728
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:11,089
What's that?

729
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:12,648
I heard you say something.

730
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:16,564
What did I say? Nothing.

731
00:37:16,723 --> 00:37:18,327
No. I heard you say something.

732
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,734
He said you're not that great!

733
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:20,844
Brick!

734
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:22,892
Is that what you said about me?

735
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:24,528
- He's coming over here.
- I know!

736
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,486
I'm gonna rip this guy in half.

737
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:29,650
No, no, no!
Just give me a little piece of him.

738
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:32,051
Jack, look, it's just...

739
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:35,605
The guys look up to you so much,
and I just was a little jealous.

740
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:37,014
I just said some junk.

741
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:39,203
That's funny.

742
00:37:39,283 --> 00:37:44,528
Aren't you the guy
who lost his job to his wife?

743
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:48,767
Shouldn't you be doing her makeup?

744
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:56,603
- All right, guys, that's enough.
- No, shut up, Freddie!

745
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:59,808
And you can shut your mouth,
okay, Jack "Lame"!

746
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:07,769
Yeah.
Mr. Butt-Vagina's got some fight in him.

747
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:10,892
- You listen to this one, big fella.
- Yeah.

748
00:38:13,003 --> 00:38:16,610
I bet you that we beat
your ratings tonight.

749
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:20,850
I'm sorry. I'm trying to keep it together.

750
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,925
No, no, no. Don't do this. Don't do this.

751
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:25,768
You're on at 2:00 a.m.
Jack has prime time!

752
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:28,727
Maybe... No. Hey, Freddie, no, no. Hey.

753
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:32,134
I'll take that bet. What are the stakes?

754
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:35,447
If we lose, I'll leave New York.

755
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:38,366
And I'll never read the news again.

756
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:41,926
And if by some
snowball's chance in hell

757
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:45,132
Mr. Mustache here
pulls a miracle out of his ass?

758
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:50,927
You change your name to Jack Lame!
Legally.

759
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:54,845
I like this! You're on, Stretch.

760
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:56,613
Everyone heard him?

761
00:38:56,683 --> 00:38:58,484
- Freddie, you heard him?
- Yeah. I heard him.

762
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:01,494
- This is on like Pong.
- Okay. Good.

763
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,884
Why? Why did you make that bet, Ron?

764
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:11,489
We've got the graveyard shift!
We don't have a chance!

765
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:13,487
Hey, guy!

766
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,771
This ain't local news anymore.

767
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:17,333
We shit standing up here.

768
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,610
What?

769
00:39:20,363 --> 00:39:23,606
It's a huge mess, but damn, is it cool!

770
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:25,688
All right, everyone!

771
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,972
Ladies and gentlemen,

772
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:34,087
today wouldn't be possible
without the visionary behind GNN.

773
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:36,924
Mr. Kench Allenby!

774
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:38,812
Yeah, yeah!

775
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,653
Thank you.

776
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:44,685
All right, cheer.

777
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:49,528
I am jabbered,
just jabbered, full of beans, no doubt.

778
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:51,605
Does anyone else speak Australian?

779
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:53,333
I thought they talked like us.

780
00:39:53,443 --> 00:39:56,447
Can I get you to say with me...

781
00:39:58,923 --> 00:40:00,971
We can't quite understand you.

782
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:03,774
How's this? I'm Kench Allenby.

783
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,926
- Yes. That's good.
- There we go! Thank you so much.

784
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,325
I'm Kench Allenby
and you all know my story.

785
00:40:09,403 --> 00:40:10,529
I'm a self-made man.

786
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:15,327
My late, great father, Vadge Allenby,
gave me $300 million,

787
00:40:15,403 --> 00:40:20,648
and I toiled my whole bloody life
to turn that into $305 million.

788
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:22,373
True story. True story.

789
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:26,884
But this is 24-hour news station...

790
00:40:26,963 --> 00:40:28,533
This is history.

791
00:40:28,603 --> 00:40:30,731
This is like Columbus
discovering the New World.

792
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:35,730
And the captain of this fantastic
voyage is the best newsman in America,

793
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:37,368
Mr. Jack Lime!

794
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,924
Go get 'em, Jack! Go get 'em!

795
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:44,054
Thank you.
And good luck to Ron Burgundy, too.

796
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,568
Getting nervous there, <i>compadre?</i>

797
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:50,049
Let's do this.

798
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:52,530
Did you see that?
How he spun on that desk? So great.

799
00:40:52,603 --> 00:40:54,207
All right. Quiet on the floor, please.

800
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:56,763
All right.

801
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:58,607
All right. We're up.
Here we go, here we go.

802
00:40:58,763 --> 00:41:02,370
In five, four, three, two...

803
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:06,887
Good day, and welcome to GNN.

804
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:10,854
Thank you for joining us on what we
believe to be a whole new era of news.

805
00:41:11,163 --> 00:41:12,403
I'm Jack Lime,

806
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:16,852
your guide for this journey of events
we humbly call 24-hour news.

807
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:18,891
Today's top story, Mount St. Helene.

808
00:41:18,963 --> 00:41:22,046
This is just a gimmick.
It's a flash in the pan.

809
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:23,454
We better hope so.

810
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:25,133
Residents are being asked
to evacuate the area...

811
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:26,807
Twenty-four hours of news.

812
00:41:26,923 --> 00:41:29,654
How are they gonna keep
coming up with this stuff?

813
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:33,011
My guess is they'll probably be scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

814
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:35,768
No, I have a feeling
they'll stick with their integrity

815
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,574
and only report
the news that needs to be reported.

816
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:40,170
Let's see here.

817
00:41:40,243 --> 00:41:44,293
"Global temperatures rise half a degree,
alarm climate scientists." Boring.

818
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:47,613
"China could dominate
the world economy in the next decade."

819
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:51,450
Nope.

820
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:52,929
Anyone else?

821
00:41:53,003 --> 00:41:54,573
What if we show a porno
instead of the news?

822
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:55,684
Freddie?

823
00:41:55,923 --> 00:41:57,687
No. Absolutely not.

824
00:41:58,243 --> 00:42:00,849
I know. What if we get
one of those wildlife handlers?

825
00:42:00,923 --> 00:42:04,006
We have him bring in big game cats.

826
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:08,372
You know, wild, dangerous tigers
and lions and leopards and the such.

827
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:12,164
We let them loose inside the studio
with about a dozen chickens.

828
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:16,089
We play rock music.
And we just call it Let Her <i>Rip.</i>

829
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:18,086
I'd watch that. I'd watch that.

830
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,494
Let Her Rip?

831
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:23,170
You're describing the end of civilization.
That's not news!

832
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:24,847
If that's the end of times, I'm...

833
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:28,245
I got a front-row seat
with a big tub of buttered popcorn

834
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:31,406
and a greasy half-live chicken leg.

835
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:33,850
Okay, so obviously this is
a waste of time. I'm done.

836
00:42:33,923 --> 00:42:35,049
Freddie! Come on!

837
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:36,613
We're just brainstorming here.

838
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:39,409
We're trying to figure out how to
make the news less boring,

839
00:42:39,483 --> 00:42:41,645
and you act like
we peed in your milkshake.

840
00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:44,124
The news is supposed to be boring,
Ron!

841
00:42:44,203 --> 00:42:45,773
This is serious stuff.

842
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,450
You're the one that
made this stupid bet!

843
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:53,894
I just don't know why we have to
tell the people what they need to hear.

844
00:42:54,163 --> 00:42:56,609
Why can't we just
tell them what they want to hear?

845
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:59,172
Wait, wait, wait.

846
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:01,963
Say that again.

847
00:43:02,243 --> 00:43:07,534
I said, why do we have to tell the people
what they need to hear?

848
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,165
Why can't we just
tell them what they want to hear?

849
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:12,212
And what do they want to hear, Ron?

850
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:15,487
That we live in the greatest country
God ever created.

851
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:18,523
- Damn straight!
- Made him happy.

852
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,845
And we should do stories on patriots.

853
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:24,292
Cute, funny little animals, huh? Or diets.

854
00:43:24,363 --> 00:43:27,333
Why blondes have more fun.

855
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,327
And serious investigative pieces,

856
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:31,849
about how much ejaculate
is on hotel duvets.

857
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:34,325
And only the best sports highlights.

858
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,885
Home runs, slam dunks,
touchdowns and no soccer.

859
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:39,249
I like the Wind!

860
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:41,531
Brick's right. People love hurricanes.

861
00:43:41,603 --> 00:43:44,971
Tornadoes, earthquakes, floods,
we'll throw Brick right in the middle of it.

862
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:46,044
You'd do that?

863
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:48,408
People'll go nuts. I'd watch that!

864
00:43:48,643 --> 00:43:54,412
No, this goes against every rule
of broadcast journalism I know.

865
00:43:54,723 --> 00:43:59,524
Freddie, as the wise man once said,
"So?"

866
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:01,966
We got 10 hours till we go on.

867
00:44:02,043 --> 00:44:03,374
We'll only need eight!

868
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,247
Lady

869
00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:17,806
I'm your knight in shining armor

870
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,251
And I love you

871
00:44:21,603 --> 00:44:25,653
You have made me what I am

872
00:44:26,603 --> 00:44:29,049
And I am yours

873
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:36,485
My love...

874
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:41,804
- Is that candy?
- I don't know.

875
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,164
It is candy.

876
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:52,724
- I like you.
- I like you.

877
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,332
Tell me something about you.

878
00:44:56,003 --> 00:44:59,132
Well, I'm 19 years old.
My middle name is Courtney.

879
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:02,884
I can always guess how many
jelly beans are in a jelly bean jar,

880
00:45:02,963 --> 00:45:04,328
even if it's not right.

881
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:06,008
What about you?

882
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:08,405
My name is Chani Lastnamé.

883
00:45:08,483 --> 00:45:11,214
I'm a real go-getter
and a person people.

884
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:15,932
I can type 50 words a minute
with only 300 errors.

885
00:45:16,523 --> 00:45:18,571
I'm trained and certified...

886
00:45:18,643 --> 00:45:20,611
To fire a
military-grade missile launcher.

887
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:21,684
Me, too.

888
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:25,967
Chani, I just got
these phone messages from last week.

889
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:27,488
You mailed them to me?

890
00:45:27,563 --> 00:45:29,645
How else was I gonna get them to you?

891
00:45:29,963 --> 00:45:31,647
You hand them to me.

892
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:35,404
You are the dumbest person
I've met in my entire life,

893
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,770
and that's not an exaggeration.

894
00:45:37,883 --> 00:45:39,044
That makes me feel bad.

895
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:41,251
Well, it's the truth, Chani.

896
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:42,893
You!

897
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:46,133
- Leave her alone!
- Excuse me, sir.

898
00:45:47,123 --> 00:45:50,844
Get your filthy hands off of her!

899
00:45:50,923 --> 00:45:52,129
Help. Help!

900
00:45:52,203 --> 00:45:53,284
Excuse me, sir!

901
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:55,570
- Leave me alone, lady!
- Excuse me!

902
00:45:55,643 --> 00:45:58,408
She is a goddess among women!

903
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:02,409
Glen!

904
00:46:03,003 --> 00:46:04,653
MY phone messages!

905
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:06,725
Leave him alone!

906
00:46:06,923 --> 00:46:08,049
Not today!

907
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,573
- She has butterflies in her heart!
- Chani!

908
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,533
I can see you behind that desk,
and you're fired!

909
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:15,729
Why?

910
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:26,253
Are you okay?

911
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:28,772
You saved my life.

912
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,092
She was trying to set me on fire.

913
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:33,883
I didn't ask for these powers.

914
00:46:33,963 --> 00:46:35,408
I was given them.

915
00:46:35,723 --> 00:46:39,694
Last night a bird chased me,

916
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:42,045
and I wished it was you.

917
00:46:43,043 --> 00:46:44,613
Can we go to a date?

918
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:46,447
Yes.

919
00:47:00,723 --> 00:47:04,091
Dear God, please help me pull this off.

920
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:08,533
I swear, if you help me,
I will become a monk.

921
00:47:08,603 --> 00:47:11,652
I will shave my head
and become a monk...

922
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,654
Who are we kidding?
I'm not going to do that.

923
00:47:14,803 --> 00:47:16,043
Did you hear?

924
00:47:16,123 --> 00:47:18,163
Evan said there's
some strange copy in the prompter.

925
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:19,689
It's 2:00 a.m.

926
00:47:19,763 --> 00:47:21,891
It's Freddie Shapp's ass, not mine.
Let's go.

927
00:47:21,963 --> 00:47:25,684
People who change history
are rarely aware of it while doing so.

928
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:31,449
Ron and his news team simply thought
they were making the news more fun.

929
00:47:31,763 --> 00:47:36,849
Little did they know they were changing
the course of broadcast history forever.

930
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:39,972
Hello, America.
It's 2:00 a.m. Eastern time.

931
00:47:40,323 --> 00:47:45,693
I'm Ron Burgundy,
and tonight's top story is America.

932
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,772
She's the greatest country in the world.

933
00:47:47,883 --> 00:47:49,726
Heck, the history of the world!

934
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:50,884
You're damn right!

935
00:47:53,443 --> 00:47:56,014
Too much of the news
is about what's wrong with America.

936
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:57,050
Amen, brother!

937
00:47:57,123 --> 00:48:00,013
Well, tonight, our top story
is what's right with America.

938
00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:02,850
Someone's finally
talking sense on the TV.

939
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,244
For starters, we kick butt.

940
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:07,650
Nazi butt. Russian butt.

941
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:09,248
What the hell is he doing?

942
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:10,813
He's talking about America.

943
00:48:10,883 --> 00:48:12,363
Why, do you have a problem with that?

944
00:48:12,483 --> 00:48:15,134
Tonight I begin part one
of my 11-part series

945
00:48:15,243 --> 00:48:17,974
on the power and mystery
of the human vagina.

946
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:22,453
This series will be a tasteful look
at just what makes a vagina tick,

947
00:48:22,643 --> 00:48:26,329
as well as a look at the 50 greatest
vaginae of the 20th century.

948
00:48:26,563 --> 00:48:27,644
Son of a bitch!

949
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,087
One final question, and I'll let you go.

950
00:48:31,163 --> 00:48:34,133
Who tops the list
of the top 50 greatest vaginae?

951
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,365
Well, I don't want to give anything away.

952
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:38,564
I thought I had you.

953
00:48:38,843 --> 00:48:40,447
I will give you number two.

954
00:48:40,563 --> 00:48:41,769
- Please.
- Madame Curie.

955
00:48:41,843 --> 00:48:43,527
Of course. Of course.

956
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:45,129
Whammy! Whammy!

957
00:48:45,203 --> 00:48:47,046
Whammy! Whammy! Whammy!

958
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:49,012
Whammy!

959
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:55,764
Whammy!

960
00:48:55,843 --> 00:48:57,004
Back to you, Ron.

961
00:48:57,203 --> 00:48:59,968
The wind is really windy.

962
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,484
Brick? Brick, can you hear me?

963
00:49:02,563 --> 00:49:04,213
I can't hear you, Ron!

964
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:08,164
Okay, but you're answering the
question, so I think you can hear me.

965
00:49:08,243 --> 00:49:09,324
No, I can!

966
00:49:09,403 --> 00:49:12,566
Brick, do you think there is any danger
to the average person out there?

967
00:49:12,643 --> 00:49:15,123
I'm afraid for the animals
of New York, Ron.

968
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:20,046
I saw a woman,
and her dog never touched the ground.

969
00:49:20,203 --> 00:49:23,730
You're saying wind gusts
as fast as a supersonic jet?

970
00:49:23,963 --> 00:49:26,330
It looked like
she was walking a dog balloon.

971
00:49:26,683 --> 00:49:27,923
And go... Switch.

972
00:49:28,363 --> 00:49:31,731
And for our eighth
and final animal story of the night,

973
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,488
it looks like residents
of North Yulk, Montana,

974
00:49:34,563 --> 00:49:38,010
have found the cutest little patriot
on God's green earth.

975
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:43,133
Look at that little guy!

976
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:47,008
He was having some fun.

977
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:52,331
Well, for all of us here at GNN,
I'm Ron Burgundy.

978
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:56,772
And don't just have a great night,
have an American night.

979
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:01,334
And we're out!

980
00:50:03,923 --> 00:50:07,086
- I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!
- Yes.

981
00:50:07,443 --> 00:50:09,684
You were electric, Ron! Whammy!

982
00:50:09,763 --> 00:50:11,572
That just felt right! That felt right!

983
00:50:11,643 --> 00:50:12,849
I was outside!

984
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:15,290
You sure were, Brick. Wonderful job.

985
00:50:15,363 --> 00:50:16,853
Amazing. Great job.

986
00:50:16,923 --> 00:50:20,689
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?

987
00:50:21,203 --> 00:50:24,047
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Linda.
We were just trying something new.

988
00:50:24,123 --> 00:50:26,444
You changed the format of
the entire show without consulting me?

989
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,524
That's unacceptable!

990
00:50:27,763 --> 00:50:30,733
Damn straight, sister.
We just done went and brought it!

991
00:50:30,803 --> 00:50:33,409
And here's the truth.
You can't handle it, little mama!

992
00:50:33,483 --> 00:50:36,168
Get out!
You are all terminated immediately.

993
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:38,207
If you were a man, I'd knock you out.

994
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:41,168
Really? Well, go ahead!

995
00:50:41,243 --> 00:50:43,371
Take a swing! Take your best shot!

996
00:50:44,043 --> 00:50:45,249
I have five brothers,

997
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:47,485
and two of them are defensive backs
in the NFL, so come on!

998
00:50:47,563 --> 00:50:49,167
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah.

999
00:50:49,243 --> 00:50:50,768
This thing's not gonna feel good.

1000
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:51,810
Do it, Ron. Just do it.

1001
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,931
Are you scared? What's the problem?

1002
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:56,051
Is he a chicken? Are you a chicken?

1003
00:50:59,563 --> 00:51:00,724
I'm not a chicken at all.

1004
00:51:00,843 --> 00:51:03,164
I'm going to make
that mustache of yours all bloody.

1005
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:06,124
Well...

1006
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:08,332
Seems like you're buying time, Ron.

1007
00:51:08,403 --> 00:51:09,814
I'm not buying time.

1008
00:51:09,923 --> 00:51:13,484
Ron! Just do what men have been doing
for thousands of years,

1009
00:51:13,563 --> 00:51:15,167
and punch the woman.

1010
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:16,529
- Punch her!
- You're stalling.

1011
00:51:16,603 --> 00:51:17,604
Punch the woman!

1012
00:51:17,723 --> 00:51:20,693
Here comes the Toledo Express.
All aboard!

1013
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:25,814
Ron! No!

1014
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,454
I didn't do it!

1015
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:34,448
Mama, your baby's hurt.

1016
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:36,448
Your baby.

1017
00:51:37,963 --> 00:51:40,614
What is that sound you're making?
Good Lord!

1018
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:44,451
You sound like a balloon.

1019
00:51:44,683 --> 00:51:46,128
Pull yourself together, man.

1020
00:51:46,283 --> 00:51:47,523
Security!

1021
00:51:47,603 --> 00:51:49,446
They saw my pee-pee.

1022
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,367
The eighth grade boys saw my pee-pee!

1023
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:54,532
Did you say they saw your pee-pee?

1024
00:51:54,603 --> 00:51:57,083
In the locker room,
they saw my pee-pee.

1025
00:51:57,403 --> 00:51:59,531
You just knocked him
back into fifth grade.

1026
00:51:59,603 --> 00:52:00,809
Get him out of here!

1027
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:04,326
Bugger me with a didgeridoo.

1028
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:05,929
We knew we'd struggle to start,

1029
00:52:06,003 --> 00:52:08,574
but these ratings
are lower than I'd even imagined.

1030
00:52:08,643 --> 00:52:10,532
Thank God for the 2:00 a.m. spike.

1031
00:52:10,603 --> 00:52:12,332
It really saved our whole launch.

1032
00:52:12,603 --> 00:52:14,890
Spike? What are you talking about?

1033
00:52:15,283 --> 00:52:16,330
What spike?

1034
00:52:16,523 --> 00:52:18,571
Burgundy. Who's Ron Burgundy?

1035
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:20,725
No, no, no, this can't be right.

1036
00:52:22,003 --> 00:52:26,691
His team start at a .2,
and then they finish at a 5.6?

1037
00:52:26,763 --> 00:52:29,926
That's unbelievable!
They tripled Jack Lime's numbers!

1038
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:33,206
How is that even possible?
Who are these guys?

1039
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:36,169
They're a local team out of San Diego.

1040
00:52:36,483 --> 00:52:37,644
You little beauty!

1041
00:52:37,843 --> 00:52:39,652
Well, they no longer work for us.

1042
00:52:41,843 --> 00:52:43,049
I fired them.

1043
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:48,654
Well, guys, it goes without saying
I owe you gentlemen an apology.

1044
00:52:48,803 --> 00:52:53,650
I dragged you out here and this thing
was a disaster from the word "go."

1045
00:52:53,723 --> 00:52:56,294
No, Ron, don't you beat yourself up.

1046
00:52:56,403 --> 00:52:58,007
Yeah, it's all right, Ron.

1047
00:52:58,163 --> 00:52:59,369
Gin.

1048
00:53:00,683 --> 00:53:02,651
Brian, any idea what you might do next?

1049
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:04,054
Gonna head back to L.A.

1050
00:53:04,123 --> 00:53:05,773
I got a good group of buddies out there.

1051
00:53:05,843 --> 00:53:08,653
O.J. Simpson.
Phil Spector. Robert Blake.

1052
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:10,452
Sounds like a fun crew.

1053
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:12,207
We go out cruising chicks.

1054
00:53:12,283 --> 00:53:13,967
Call ourselves the "Ladykillers."

1055
00:53:14,043 --> 00:53:16,523
I love that name. You should get it
on the back of matching jackets.

1056
00:53:16,603 --> 00:53:18,128
That's not a bad idea.

1057
00:53:21,563 --> 00:53:23,372
Guys?

1058
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,483
Hey.

1059
00:53:26,723 --> 00:53:28,532
I got some news.

1060
00:53:28,723 --> 00:53:31,454
Freddie, we don't exactly want to hear
the word "news" right now.

1061
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:32,809
Yeah.

1062
00:53:32,883 --> 00:53:36,410
You're right. Forget it.
Forget I was even here.

1063
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:39,773
Forget that GNN wants you back.

1064
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:44,733
For a prime time slot and a raise in pay.

1065
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:48,326
Quit yanking our penises, Freddie!
What's the deal?

1066
00:53:48,403 --> 00:53:50,644
Yeah! Quit yanking our anuses.

1067
00:53:50,723 --> 00:53:52,930
No. I'm not yanking your...

1068
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:57,373
Your ratings went through the roof.

1069
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,174
People love what you did.

1070
00:54:00,843 --> 00:54:02,732
You're a success!

1071
00:54:02,843 --> 00:54:07,565
Get it? You're a great, big, fat success!

1072
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,529
By the bed pan of Gene Rayburn!

1073
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:13,654
It's total crap
and they can't stop watching!

1074
00:54:14,243 --> 00:54:17,133
The news team
had been famous in San Diego,

1075
00:54:17,203 --> 00:54:20,366
but that was small time
compared to New York.

1076
00:54:20,963 --> 00:54:23,125
This fame was a rocket ship.

1077
00:54:23,203 --> 00:54:27,686
A rocket ship that had free drinks
and topless stewardesses.

1078
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:29,731
That'll do it for all of us here at GNN.

1079
00:54:29,803 --> 00:54:33,410
Thank God for the events,
thank me for the news.

1080
00:54:33,483 --> 00:54:34,894
I'm Jack...

1081
00:54:38,043 --> 00:54:39,169
...Lame.

1082
00:54:43,123 --> 00:54:45,171
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1083
00:54:45,243 --> 00:54:46,574
More graphics, all right?

1084
00:54:46,643 --> 00:54:48,247
But there's already a lot.

1085
00:54:48,323 --> 00:54:50,564
Hey, you heard the man. More graphics.

1086
00:54:50,683 --> 00:54:53,254
Let a citizen ask a question here,
for God's sake!

1087
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:56,770
Can Father Ron please shut his mouth
for just half a second?

1088
00:54:59,323 --> 00:55:03,123
This is against everything
that I have worked for my entire life.

1089
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:04,534
Honey, come on.

1090
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:32,929
If you're like me, you need an underwear
that fits your active lifestyle.

1091
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:35,774
At finer specialty
and department stores.

1092
00:55:35,843 --> 00:55:38,608
I'm weatherman Brick Tamland,
and I like butter.

1093
00:55:38,683 --> 00:55:42,813
Butter is nutritious and it tastes great.

1094
00:55:43,283 --> 00:55:44,967
Butter!

1095
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:49,329
There's something new
on the New York social scene.

1096
00:55:49,403 --> 00:55:51,007
It's fun, relatively benign

1097
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:54,451
and costs about as much
as a soda pop at the local drugstore.

1098
00:55:54,523 --> 00:55:55,934
Here's Brian Fantana

1099
00:55:56,003 --> 00:56:00,452
on why everyone who is someone
is lighting up to smoke crack.

1100
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,924
Now, Brian,
I understand we have some crack

1101
00:56:03,003 --> 00:56:04,687
and we're going to smoke it
right here in the studio.

1102
00:56:04,763 --> 00:56:06,049
I don't know if we can get a shot of that.

1103
00:56:06,123 --> 00:56:08,012
What is that? Did you know
they were gonna have that?

1104
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,130
No.

1105
00:56:09,323 --> 00:56:12,452
Now, what you're gonna do is,
you're gonna put your rock in the pipe.

1106
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:14,924
Is that where the phrase "Put it in your
pipe and smoke it" comes from?

1107
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:16,414
I don't care.

1108
00:56:16,483 --> 00:56:18,690
I love it when you do cooking segments.

1109
00:56:23,123 --> 00:56:24,488
You feel that right away.

1110
00:56:24,563 --> 00:56:27,612
That's good. That's good.
That's an immediate state of euphoria.

1111
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:30,653
You'll be surprised.
The effect, it happens very...

1112
00:56:31,803 --> 00:56:33,612
It's just refreshing.

1113
00:56:33,683 --> 00:56:35,765
They're actually enjoying it.

1114
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:37,891
Of course they're enjoying it. It's crack.

1115
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:44,408
Well, now we know, guys,
you can't smoke crack on live television.

1116
00:56:56,003 --> 00:56:57,129
Hay!

1117
00:56:57,203 --> 00:56:59,285
You know what would
make this great day even better?

1118
00:56:59,363 --> 00:57:00,364
What?

1119
00:57:00,563 --> 00:57:02,531
Perms for everyone!

1120
00:57:15,523 --> 00:57:17,366
Please come in and shut the door.

1121
00:57:22,243 --> 00:57:24,132
If this is about sweeps,

1122
00:57:24,203 --> 00:57:27,047
I think Brian Fantana
found an outstanding story.

1123
00:57:27,123 --> 00:57:29,330
It's about airplane parts

1124
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:34,489
that are falling off of airplanes out of
the sky and hitting the ground, people.

1125
00:57:34,563 --> 00:57:36,565
We're calling it "Death From Above."
We might do some...

1126
00:57:36,683 --> 00:57:38,253
You. Come here.

1127
00:57:43,403 --> 00:57:45,167
I've been watching you.

1128
00:57:45,243 --> 00:57:46,608
You have?

1129
00:57:48,123 --> 00:57:50,251
I've been watching you a lot.

1130
00:57:51,563 --> 00:57:53,167
And you just do whatever you want.

1131
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:55,934
Well, I'm a bit of a maverick, I guess.

1132
00:57:56,003 --> 00:57:57,767
You don't follow the format.

1133
00:57:57,843 --> 00:58:02,451
You pretty much walk around
like you're king of the world.

1134
00:58:02,763 --> 00:58:05,448
I'm just a worker bee. That's all I am.

1135
00:58:06,043 --> 00:58:07,932
- You know what?
- What?

1136
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:14,607
I find it hot as shit!

1137
00:58:15,003 --> 00:58:16,812
Are you going to hurt me?

1138
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:18,328
Here's the thing, Mr. Burgundy.

1139
00:58:18,403 --> 00:58:21,134
You're a shooting star
and I want to go for a ride.

1140
00:58:21,643 --> 00:58:23,372
God, I'm so afraid right now.

1141
00:58:23,443 --> 00:58:25,525
Now, I want to hear you meow like a cat.

1142
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,732
Now, I want you to bark like a dog.

1143
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:33,692
Bark. Bark. Bark!

1144
00:58:34,363 --> 00:58:35,967
Like a puppy. Like a puppy.

1145
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:42,888
Yeah. Come on! Do it!

1146
00:58:46,643 --> 00:58:48,213
Don't cry.

1147
00:58:49,723 --> 00:58:53,125
It's sexual and yet frightening.
It's an odd mixture.

1148
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,010
Come in.

1149
00:58:56,003 --> 00:58:57,243
Linda.

1150
00:58:57,323 --> 00:58:59,291
Excuse me, Linda.

1151
00:58:59,683 --> 00:59:01,811
Ron, Jack wants to know

1152
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:05,251
if he can go back to calling himself
Jack Lime instead of Jack Lame.

1153
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:06,848
He's really struggling with it.

1154
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:09,534
No. Can't. It's a bet.

1155
00:59:09,723 --> 00:59:11,248
Jesus!

1156
00:59:11,323 --> 00:59:12,973
If you want to change it, you can.

1157
00:59:13,443 --> 00:59:14,569
Like what?

1158
00:59:14,643 --> 00:59:15,724
Art Areola.

1159
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:18,010
No! No, that's worse!
You know it's worse!

1160
00:59:18,483 --> 00:59:20,804
How about this one?
You can call yourself Dick Fuck.

1161
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:22,965
Spell it P-H-U-C.

1162
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:25,045
You'll be huge
in the Vietnamese community.

1163
00:59:25,203 --> 00:59:26,204
Freddie, I can't.

1164
00:59:26,283 --> 00:59:29,173
Listen to me, Burgundy.
This is far from over, do you hear me?

1165
00:59:30,003 --> 00:59:32,085
I'll see you on the playground.

1166
00:59:35,123 --> 00:59:36,454
Well.

1167
00:59:37,883 --> 00:59:43,811
This meeting has been very productive.

1168
00:59:43,883 --> 00:59:45,772
You can pick me up at 8:00.

1169
00:59:46,123 --> 00:59:50,492
Okay, I'm very confused
by what's going on here.

1170
00:59:51,443 --> 00:59:52,569
Get out!

1171
01:00:02,483 --> 01:00:03,564
Ron.

1172
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:08,854
Ron, you are missing some real
high-quality Garfield laughs over here!

1173
01:00:08,923 --> 01:00:10,732
I think our boss just raped me.

1174
01:00:10,803 --> 01:00:11,929
What?

1175
01:00:12,003 --> 01:00:13,607
I don't know what happened.

1176
01:00:13,683 --> 01:00:15,412
All a bit of a blur.

1177
01:00:15,483 --> 01:00:19,124
There was hands and hair,
and breath, and lips.

1178
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:20,853
There might have been
other people, I don't know.

1179
01:00:20,923 --> 01:00:22,209
Sounds like she wants you.

1180
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:23,330
Hey, man.

1181
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:25,644
Women have been all over me
since we got crazy famous.

1182
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:29,330
Not to brag or anything, but I just gave
Florence Henderson crabs.

1183
01:00:29,523 --> 01:00:32,811
That is in no way a brag, Brian.
That's horrible.

1184
01:00:33,203 --> 01:00:36,286
Hey, it's just doing something beautiful,
that two people do.

1185
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:38,610
Except one of them has
microscopic dust mites

1186
01:00:38,683 --> 01:00:40,970
- all over his penis and testicles.
- I'm just saying,

1187
01:00:41,043 --> 01:00:43,967
the mom of The <i>Brady Bunch</i>
had a fun time with you,

1188
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:47,252
and then woke up the next day
and realized she had crabs.

1189
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:50,088
I gave her
a whole Brady Bunch of crabs.

1190
01:00:50,203 --> 01:00:53,173
Sounds to me like it's her fault
for being a randy gal.

1191
01:00:53,243 --> 01:00:54,574
I have a date!

1192
01:00:54,643 --> 01:00:56,008
Brick has a date?

1193
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,130
Good for Brick!

1194
01:00:57,203 --> 01:00:58,364
What's a date?

1195
01:00:58,443 --> 01:01:00,889
A date is simply
when two people get together,

1196
01:01:00,963 --> 01:01:03,694
do something social, have a few drinks,
yadda-yadda-yadda...

1197
01:01:03,763 --> 01:01:04,924
Take their shirts off...

1198
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:08,327
- It's okay.
- No, it's a fun thing.

1199
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:09,814
It's fun. It's all right.

1200
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:12,773
Look. Don't worry, Brick,
we got your back, okay?

1201
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:16,684
First things first,
we need to get you a little protection.

1202
01:01:20,683 --> 01:01:21,844
There it is.

1203
01:01:22,043 --> 01:01:25,013
Brian Fantana's
glorious cabinet of condoms.

1204
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:28,804
Brian, I know.
How about The Hooded Guest?

1205
01:01:28,883 --> 01:01:30,772
I like the cut of your jib.

1206
01:01:31,723 --> 01:01:33,487
That one is ultra-ribbed.

1207
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:36,646
It's like you're wearing
an armadillo shell on your privates.

1208
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:38,213
It takes two hours to get on.

1209
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:40,889
It's hooded.
She'll never see you coming.

1210
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,044
Wait, wait, wait.

1211
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:43,523
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1212
01:01:43,723 --> 01:01:45,134
Lou Dobin's Good Time Weiner Pouch.

1213
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:46,530
That's a good one.

1214
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:50,289
Dobin. Just a drifter
who loves to watch people have sex.

1215
01:01:50,363 --> 01:01:53,367
They're made of denim,
so they look better after each washing.

1216
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,088
Talk about a great ride.

1217
01:01:55,243 --> 01:01:56,483
I think I have it.

1218
01:01:57,243 --> 01:01:58,290
Po' Boy Condom.

1219
01:01:58,403 --> 01:01:59,848
It's a terrific condom.

1220
01:01:59,923 --> 01:02:03,006
Although it does burn a bit
because it's covered in Cajun spices.

1221
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:05,654
It'll put a blister on your po' boy.

1222
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:08,010
Brian, what's the nickname for your
penis whenever you wear a Po' Boy?

1223
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:09,414
Fat Tuesday.

1224
01:02:09,483 --> 01:02:12,168
Wait a minute. I've got it.

1225
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:14,894
The Rigid Ghost.

1226
01:02:15,003 --> 01:02:17,449
It's the best damn rubber on the market.

1227
01:02:17,523 --> 01:02:21,323
I got four of my seven
illegitimate children using this condom.

1228
01:02:21,443 --> 01:02:24,367
But, Brian, isn't that the whole point
of wearing a condom?

1229
01:02:24,443 --> 01:02:26,286
To not impregnate the woman?

1230
01:02:26,483 --> 01:02:29,327
Well, you know the old expression.
"Nope."

1231
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,009
Thank you, Ron,

1232
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:39,133
and happy St. Patrick's Day
to all of our Native American friends.

1233
01:02:39,203 --> 01:02:40,534
On the big map...

1234
01:02:42,523 --> 01:02:43,570
Where's my map?

1235
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:46,052
There's no map, it's just green.

1236
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:48,411
No, there's a map there.
Look at the monitor.

1237
01:02:48,523 --> 01:02:50,844
Right.

1238
01:02:50,923 --> 01:02:52,413
Ron, where's my legs?

1239
01:02:52,483 --> 01:02:54,247
- Where are my legs?
- Your legs are there.

1240
01:02:54,323 --> 01:02:55,848
I don't have any legs, Ron.

1241
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:58,370
I don't even know how I'm standing up.

1242
01:03:00,363 --> 01:03:01,967
Brick, your legs are fine.

1243
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:04,364
The color of your pants just matches...

1244
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:06,367
Ron, I don't have any legs!

1245
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:07,530
The Chroma-Key behind you.

1246
01:03:07,643 --> 01:03:12,126
Ninety-three?

1247
01:03:12,203 --> 01:03:13,364
Relax.

1248
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:20,447
And after I received my
Masters in Journalism from Columbia,

1249
01:03:20,523 --> 01:03:24,130
I got a job with the London bureau
for ABC News.

1250
01:03:24,203 --> 01:03:25,364
London.

1251
01:03:25,603 --> 01:03:30,245
You're so impressive, and I've
only been out of the United States twice.

1252
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:32,168
A handful of times in Mexico,

1253
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:36,532
and then the second time I left the
country, we went to Salem, Oregon.

1254
01:03:37,003 --> 01:03:38,448
Mr. Burgundy, are you nervous?

1255
01:03:38,643 --> 01:03:39,644
God, yes.

1256
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:42,011
Did I scare you by coming on so strong?

1257
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:43,529
A little bit, sure.

1258
01:03:44,003 --> 01:03:46,165
Look, it's not that
you're not attractive...

1259
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:48,245
It's just I'm a little old-fashioned.

1260
01:03:48,523 --> 01:03:51,288
Well, I am a modern woman.

1261
01:03:51,683 --> 01:03:55,768
And let me tell you, when I
see something that I want, I go for it.

1262
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,773
Can I ask you a question?

1263
01:03:58,923 --> 01:04:01,369
Is that your foot between my legs?

1264
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:02,610
No.

1265
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:04,686
I'm sorry.

1266
01:04:05,563 --> 01:04:07,008
It was my hand.

1267
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:08,124
So...

1268
01:04:08,363 --> 01:04:09,724
We're going to do this, aren't we?

1269
01:04:09,923 --> 01:04:13,405
We most definitely are gonna do this.

1270
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:19,167
I feel a little awkward, because
I'm about to have sex with a black lady!

1271
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:21,132
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1272
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:24,293
That's not the way
I like to handle my business.

1273
01:04:24,683 --> 01:04:28,688
When I get nervous, I sometimes
lose control of the volume of my voice.

1274
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:32,565
Well, I don't mind,
because I am going to have you tonight.

1275
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:36,206
Then let's leave
and go have interracial sex!

1276
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:39,283
Sorry.

1277
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:22,609
This is the nicest soda machine
anyone's ever taken me to.

1278
01:05:23,163 --> 01:05:26,246
The beauty of this soda machine
pales in comparison to your beauty.

1279
01:05:32,843 --> 01:05:34,607
Can I ask you a personal question?

1280
01:05:34,843 --> 01:05:36,607
I'm not sure what that is, but yes.

1281
01:05:36,803 --> 01:05:38,532
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1282
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:42,492
Do faces on the TV screen and
Planet of the Apes action figures count?

1283
01:05:43,203 --> 01:05:44,364
Of course.

1284
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,048
Then, yes.

1285
01:05:46,123 --> 01:05:48,854
I have kissed
Angie Dickinson and Dr. Zaius.

1286
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:52,165
I've only kissed people in my dreams.

1287
01:05:52,403 --> 01:05:57,489
So, I've only kissed a tiny dragon
and a woman with her hair on fire.

1288
01:05:57,843 --> 01:06:02,451
I don't have a lot of experience
with kissing, but I do know one thing...

1289
01:06:02,723 --> 01:06:04,407
Always get your teeth involved.

1290
01:06:05,123 --> 01:06:08,252
I think I'm ready
to maybe try that kiss thing now.

1291
01:06:45,323 --> 01:06:46,893
Hello, Ms. Jackson.

1292
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:48,934
I didn't mean to scare you.

1293
01:06:49,163 --> 01:06:51,734
Mr. Allenby, I wasn't expecting you to...

1294
01:06:52,123 --> 01:06:54,285
Yeah, no, I know. Neither was I.

1295
01:06:55,283 --> 01:06:56,884
But then I heard about this little story

1296
01:06:56,923 --> 01:06:59,847
that Ron Burgundy and Brian Fantana
are running.

1297
01:07:00,163 --> 01:07:02,211
You see,
some of the planes from my airline

1298
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:04,251
have had parts falling off them lately.

1299
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,446
Is it a problem? Yeah.

1300
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,493
Is it being fixed? I don't know, probably.

1301
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:13,245
But if that story runs,
then Koala stock will plummet.

1302
01:07:13,803 --> 01:07:16,613
We can't just pull the story.
That would be unethical.

1303
01:07:16,923 --> 01:07:20,052
We own the news.
We can do whatever we want.

1304
01:07:20,483 --> 01:07:22,247
That's one of the perks.

1305
01:07:22,603 --> 01:07:26,244
It's called "synergy."
One company working with another.

1306
01:07:29,803 --> 01:07:31,248
To synergy.

1307
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:41,969
You seem a little quiet, I must say.

1308
01:07:42,403 --> 01:07:46,124
Just so you know, I'm absolutely fine
with going to this family dinner.

1309
01:07:46,803 --> 01:07:48,487
They're going to love you.

1310
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:51,645
This is delicious!

1311
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:54,604
So...

1312
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:56,887
How long
have you and Linda been dating?

1313
01:07:57,283 --> 01:07:58,330
Mother.

1314
01:07:59,483 --> 01:08:01,690
No, it's all right.
It's a logical question.

1315
01:08:03,283 --> 01:08:07,607
Ours is a new love,
but it burns very brightly.

1316
01:08:08,563 --> 01:08:12,488
And it gets hot and sweaty and stanky.

1317
01:08:12,563 --> 01:08:15,009
There's some stank on that love.

1318
01:08:15,363 --> 01:08:16,524
What are you talking about?

1319
01:08:16,923 --> 01:08:19,574
Let's put it this way,
I be busting nuts like a squirrel.

1320
01:08:19,643 --> 01:08:22,328
Now, we don't have
conversations like that over dinner.

1321
01:08:22,403 --> 01:08:23,404
What are you doing?

1322
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:26,373
I'm addressing
the white elephant in the room.

1323
01:08:26,443 --> 01:08:29,526
I'm breaking down the barriers
of race by assimilation.

1324
01:08:29,603 --> 01:08:32,043
- That's all I'm doing.
- Well, you're coming off like a jerk.

1325
01:08:32,123 --> 01:08:33,693
I think it's going well.

1326
01:08:33,763 --> 01:08:36,892
If you haven't noticed,
we don't converse like that.

1327
01:08:36,963 --> 01:08:38,852
Okay, Okay-

1328
01:08:39,163 --> 01:08:40,892
Look at big papa down here.

1329
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:43,284
He's saying to himself,
"Shit! Look at this honky.

1330
01:08:43,363 --> 01:08:47,607
"Sittin' at my table, eatin' my food.
In my house? Touching my daughter?"

1331
01:08:47,683 --> 01:08:48,650
I have.

1332
01:08:48,723 --> 01:08:50,327
- I have touched your daughter.
- Honey!

1333
01:08:50,403 --> 01:08:52,132
We have done things, Papa.

1334
01:08:52,203 --> 01:08:54,968
You ain't gonna like.
You ain't gonna like it none!

1335
01:08:55,043 --> 01:08:56,613
Oh, my goodness!

1336
01:08:56,683 --> 01:09:00,972
I mean, I'm just a guy
from Terre Haute, Indiana

1337
01:09:01,043 --> 01:09:06,413
with a big ol' dick and a fat wallet
and a spleef the size of a baby arm.

1338
01:09:06,483 --> 01:09:08,485
Just looking for someone
who wants to smoke it.

1339
01:09:08,563 --> 01:09:10,327
Let's get some smoke
going in this place, right?

1340
01:09:10,403 --> 01:09:12,724
This ain't no <i>Super Fly.</i>
What is your problem, man?

1341
01:09:14,843 --> 01:09:18,484
Linda, I don't understand
what you are doing with him.

1342
01:09:18,563 --> 01:09:22,090
You know what I'm comin' at you with,
you big black mother of Linda.

1343
01:09:22,163 --> 01:09:23,813
Mix it up in a pot!

1344
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:26,329
- Makin' it spicy!
- Oh, my Lord.

1345
01:09:26,403 --> 01:09:29,009
- Hey.
- In the back, cooking up chitlins.

1346
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,529
Big ol' titties. Big ol' titties.

1347
01:09:31,603 --> 01:09:33,173
Excuse me?

1348
01:09:33,243 --> 01:09:34,847
- That's my mama, man.
- Hey.

1349
01:09:34,923 --> 01:09:36,891
Wave your hands in the air.

1350
01:09:36,963 --> 01:09:39,170
Wave your hands in the air
like you just don't care.

1351
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:40,733
Please, don't do this.

1352
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:43,248
Now, which one of you
pipe-hittin' bitches

1353
01:09:43,323 --> 01:09:44,603
can pass me the mashed potatoes?

1354
01:09:45,563 --> 01:09:47,565
I don't think
that dinner could've gone any better.

1355
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:48,769
Are you nuts?

1356
01:09:49,123 --> 01:09:51,649
No, I'm not! I had a wonderful evening!

1357
01:09:52,323 --> 01:09:54,132
My dad was kicking you in the head!

1358
01:09:54,363 --> 01:09:57,207
I thought it was like
being jumped into a gang.

1359
01:09:57,283 --> 01:09:58,648
Only with dinner guests!

1360
01:09:58,803 --> 01:10:01,170
You called my family
"pipe-hittin' bitches"!

1361
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:05,687
I hate to pin it on you,
but you did invite me to dinner.

1362
01:10:06,363 --> 01:10:07,489
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1363
01:10:07,723 --> 01:10:09,327
- No, I'm sorry.
- I just...

1364
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:13,244
I'm just under a lot of stress
because Allenby,

1365
01:10:13,323 --> 01:10:16,486
he doesn't want you to do
the story that you're doing for sweeps.

1366
01:10:17,123 --> 01:10:18,090
"Death From Above."

1367
01:10:18,163 --> 01:10:19,803
It's an excellent story.
Wonderful expose.

1368
01:10:19,843 --> 01:10:21,368
Listen, Ron.

1369
01:10:22,523 --> 01:10:24,525
Have you ever heard of synergy?

1370
01:10:30,523 --> 01:10:34,733
So your mom thought we should
get together, spend a little time.

1371
01:10:35,643 --> 01:10:39,284
She doesn't think
I connect with you as a child.

1372
01:10:40,643 --> 01:10:42,884
Can you believe that bullshit?

1373
01:10:44,883 --> 01:10:46,487
This is hard.

1374
01:10:46,563 --> 01:10:49,772
Things you say to a 6-year-old...

1375
01:10:51,603 --> 01:10:53,731
Guess what?
I slept with a black woman.

1376
01:10:53,803 --> 01:10:55,726
- What?
- Nothing.

1377
01:10:55,803 --> 01:10:58,170
Dad, do you like Spider-Man?

1378
01:10:58,243 --> 01:11:01,884
Nope. Don't care for him. Never have.

1379
01:11:01,963 --> 01:11:05,854
Don't like the mask, the costume,
the get-up, the webs.

1380
01:11:05,923 --> 01:11:09,052
He comes off like a real dickhead.
Real poser.

1381
01:11:09,163 --> 01:11:10,608
What's a poser?

1382
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:15,564
A poser is Gary. That's what a poser is.

1383
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:17,532
By the way, how is that shitheel?

1384
01:11:17,603 --> 01:11:18,684
What's a shitheel?

1385
01:11:19,163 --> 01:11:21,643
A shitheel is a real fun term

1386
01:11:21,723 --> 01:11:23,964
that you should call Gary
every time you see him.

1387
01:11:24,043 --> 01:11:27,968
When he wakes you up for breakfast,
say, "Good morning, shitheel."

1388
01:11:28,043 --> 01:11:30,410
He'll probably give you
$5 or some candy.

1389
01:11:30,483 --> 01:11:32,531
- Does that sound good?
- Yeah.

1390
01:11:32,643 --> 01:11:34,805
You're a shitheel, Dad.

1391
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:35,884
Good.

1392
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:39,524
You should just call Gary that.
'Cause it makes him really happy.

1393
01:11:39,603 --> 01:11:42,573
It makes me sort of happy,
but it makes him really happy.

1394
01:11:43,163 --> 01:11:44,892
Dad.

1395
01:11:45,203 --> 01:11:48,525
Sometimes I hear sounds at night
and I get scared.

1396
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:51,413
I think there's a ghost in my closet.

1397
01:11:51,483 --> 01:11:53,167
Now, you listen to me, son.

1398
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:57,248
There is no such thing as ghosts.
Case closed.

1399
01:11:57,603 --> 01:11:59,253
So what's real that's scary?

1400
01:11:59,323 --> 01:12:02,406
You really want to know
the one thing you should be afraid of?

1401
01:12:02,643 --> 01:12:04,293
Yes, I really do.

1402
01:12:04,763 --> 01:12:05,844
Voodoo.

1403
01:12:05,923 --> 01:12:08,051
- Voodoo?
- Yes, voodoo.

1404
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:10,046
That shit will mess you up.

1405
01:12:10,283 --> 01:12:12,968
And it is 100% real.

1406
01:12:13,243 --> 01:12:16,292
Promise me that you'll never go to Haiti.

1407
01:12:16,683 --> 01:12:18,128
I promise, Dad.

1408
01:12:18,283 --> 01:12:20,490
This was good.
I enjoyed spending time with you.

1409
01:12:20,643 --> 01:12:21,644
Me, too, Dad.

1410
01:12:21,843 --> 01:12:24,130
And hey.
Do you want to go to Haiti sometime?

1411
01:12:24,283 --> 01:12:26,172
- No.
- Good. Good.

1412
01:12:26,403 --> 01:12:28,292
What did you tell him?

1413
01:12:28,403 --> 01:12:29,928
I didn't tell him anything.

1414
01:12:30,123 --> 01:12:32,285
He hasn't slept for four days, Ron!

1415
01:12:32,523 --> 01:12:35,447
Everywhere we go,
he asks me if we're going to Haiti!

1416
01:12:35,523 --> 01:12:36,649
What does that even mean?

1417
01:12:36,803 --> 01:12:41,684
I am so sick and tired that you've
sheltered him from the evils of voodoo.

1418
01:12:41,803 --> 01:12:44,647
You need to learn to
connect with him in a healthy way!

1419
01:12:44,723 --> 01:12:46,885
Let me ask you something,
and I'm not trying to be funny here.

1420
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:49,489
Are you sure he's not a midget
with a learning disability?

1421
01:12:49,763 --> 01:12:52,812
He is seven years old, Ron.

1422
01:12:53,003 --> 01:12:54,493
- All right.
- Now listen to me.

1423
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:59,644
He has a science fair tomorrow, at 8:00,
and he wants you to be there.

1424
01:12:59,763 --> 01:13:02,334
I will be there. All right?

1425
01:13:02,523 --> 01:13:03,963
Now, who do you have
for sweeps week?

1426
01:13:04,043 --> 01:13:06,250
I'm not discussing work with you,
Ron, okay?

1427
01:13:06,363 --> 01:13:08,969
Just be there
at the science fair tomorrow.

1428
01:13:09,043 --> 01:13:10,044
Fine!

1429
01:13:11,123 --> 01:13:13,091
Well, they're calling it
the interview of the decade.

1430
01:13:13,203 --> 01:13:15,649
Veronica Corningstone
will sit down with Yasser Arafat.

1431
01:13:16,043 --> 01:13:17,044
Yasser who?

1432
01:13:17,163 --> 01:13:19,689
The head of the PLO and some say
the key to peace in the Middle East.

1433
01:13:19,803 --> 01:13:23,364
Of course, Ms. Corningstone
is the ex-wife of Ron Burgundy,

1434
01:13:23,883 --> 01:13:26,170
so you know that's got to be
a little stinger for Ronny.

1435
01:13:26,483 --> 01:13:28,212
Tony Danza's scrotum!

1436
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:30,724
Well, that'll do it
for all of us here at GNN.

1437
01:13:30,843 --> 01:13:34,086
Thank God for the events,
thank me for the news.

1438
01:13:34,163 --> 01:13:35,688
I'm Dick Phuk.

1439
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:42,923
We're going to get crushed in ratings.
Just crushed.

1440
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:45,244
I really thought
we had a chance this time.

1441
01:13:45,723 --> 01:13:48,010
What about my
"Death From Above" story?

1442
01:13:49,123 --> 01:13:51,808
You better ask Ron about that.

1443
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:54,208
We're pulling that story, Brian.

1444
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:57,167
What? Why?
I worked hard on that story.

1445
01:13:57,243 --> 01:14:00,645
It was my call, all right, Brian?
Just let it go. It's synergy.

1446
01:14:00,723 --> 01:14:01,804
What does that mean?

1447
01:14:01,883 --> 01:14:03,487
Take it easy, Ron.

1448
01:14:03,563 --> 01:14:05,167
We got further
than anybody thought we would.

1449
01:14:05,243 --> 01:14:06,244
We'll get 'em next time.

1450
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:09,406
You take it easy!
I'm not in this to finish second!

1451
01:14:09,523 --> 01:14:11,127
I think Champ is just saying...

1452
01:14:11,203 --> 01:14:14,491
I know what he was trying to say,
Brian, okay?

1453
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:17,328
And it doesn't surprise me
that you guys don't care.

1454
01:14:17,403 --> 01:14:20,054
Let's face it,
I'm the one who gets the ratings.

1455
01:14:20,843 --> 01:14:23,164
I'm starting to wonder
what you clowns actually do.

1456
01:14:23,923 --> 01:14:26,893
Chani likes clowns.
Except for the scary ones.

1457
01:14:27,003 --> 01:14:28,084
Shut up, Brick!

1458
01:14:28,603 --> 01:14:30,605
Just shut up for once!

1459
01:14:31,363 --> 01:14:34,526
Ron yelled at me.

1460
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:35,964
You're damn right I yelled at you!

1461
01:14:39,723 --> 01:14:41,646
You don't yell at Brick.

1462
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,573
Are you still smoking crack?

1463
01:14:43,963 --> 01:14:45,328
No.

1464
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,926
I only smoked crack that one time.

1465
01:14:49,043 --> 01:14:52,286
That's a lie. I've done it six more times.

1466
01:14:52,403 --> 01:14:53,814
You made Brick cry.

1467
01:14:55,443 --> 01:14:57,923
You've gone ratings crazy, Ron.

1468
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:02,487
But seriously,
do you have any more of that crack left?

1469
01:15:02,603 --> 01:15:03,764
You know what, Ron?

1470
01:15:04,363 --> 01:15:06,650
We're a news team,
and that's a bond for life.

1471
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:08,572
But I don't like the man you've become.

1472
01:15:08,643 --> 01:15:10,452
You know, we were happy
when you found us.

1473
01:15:10,523 --> 01:15:11,684
Right?

1474
01:15:11,763 --> 01:15:13,413
I was taking pictures of pussies,

1475
01:15:13,483 --> 01:15:16,373
Champ was serving bats to people,
and Brick was dead.

1476
01:15:16,443 --> 01:15:19,287
We took a gamble.
Took a gamble to follow you here.

1477
01:15:19,403 --> 01:15:21,443
But I'm starting to realize,
this was all about you,

1478
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,247
and beating Veronica
at all costs.

1479
01:15:23,323 --> 01:15:25,246
Had nothing to do with the news,
nothing to do with the team.

1480
01:15:25,323 --> 01:15:26,324
Brian, don't.

1481
01:15:26,403 --> 01:15:27,893
You know,
I might not be the smartest guy,

1482
01:15:28,003 --> 01:15:30,404
but I know a thing or two
about a thing or two.

1483
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:32,690
I know that if you're
pleasuring a woman down south,

1484
01:15:32,763 --> 01:15:34,652
you use your tongue
to spell out the alphabet.

1485
01:15:34,723 --> 01:15:37,932
Around the bubble. Around her bubble.

1486
01:15:38,003 --> 01:15:40,813
- The vulva!
- The Volvo.

1487
01:15:40,883 --> 01:15:44,330
I know that "synergy"
is a completely made-up word.

1488
01:15:44,403 --> 01:15:47,532
I know that washing your hands
is for nerds.

1489
01:15:47,603 --> 01:15:49,571
Especially if you don't mind pinkeye.

1490
01:15:49,643 --> 01:15:55,093
And I know that, no matter what,
you always stand by your friends.

1491
01:15:55,403 --> 01:15:57,804
You'll have to excuse me, Brian.

1492
01:15:58,443 --> 01:16:04,166
I've got a sore back from carrying
your ass around for the last 15 years.

1493
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,448
You know what, Burgundy?

1494
01:16:06,843 --> 01:16:09,847
I think your mouth
is writing checks that your body isn't...

1495
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:12,125
Can't even... Do anything with.

1496
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:21,293
Fine, go! I don't need you!

1497
01:16:21,923 --> 01:16:24,130
I'll do the news by myself!

1498
01:16:28,923 --> 01:16:31,813
Tonight I interview Yasser Arafat...

1499
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:33,923
- This is terrible.
- the secretive head of the PLO.

1500
01:16:34,603 --> 01:16:36,685
- We're on in 20, Ron, 20.
- All right.

1501
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:38,444
You ready?

1502
01:16:39,003 --> 01:16:40,573
What's that?

1503
01:16:40,883 --> 01:16:42,009
That's nothing.

1504
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:45,565
It's just a car chase
on the satellite feed from Milwaukee.

1505
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,133
You know what?

1506
01:16:48,483 --> 01:16:50,929
Give it to me live to start the broadcast.

1507
01:16:51,043 --> 01:16:53,523
No. That's not news, Ron.

1508
01:16:53,723 --> 01:16:55,612
Give it to me live, okay?

1509
01:16:55,683 --> 01:16:57,253
And don't question me again.

1510
01:16:57,323 --> 01:16:58,290
Bill!

1511
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,764
- Now to you, the modern viewer...
- Here we go.

1512
01:17:00,843 --> 01:17:03,369
reporting on a car chase
may seem commonplace...

1513
01:17:03,443 --> 01:17:06,845
- Three, Mo...
- but in 1980, it was unheard of.

1514
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:10,973
Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy,
reporting live from New York.

1515
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,604
We have breaking news
developing in our nation's heartland.

1516
01:17:14,683 --> 01:17:18,324
A high-speed car chase is in progress...

1517
01:17:18,403 --> 01:17:20,974
Keep the "Breaking News" logo.
Keep up the graphics.

1518
01:17:21,043 --> 01:17:22,044
Reaching speeds of 100 miles per hour.

1519
01:17:22,123 --> 01:17:25,969
And for the first time in news history,
we will stay with it live

1520
01:17:26,043 --> 01:17:29,650
until it resolves in either
a huge accident or a massive shootout.

1521
01:17:29,723 --> 01:17:30,724
Richard!

1522
01:17:30,803 --> 01:17:33,807
Hurry. Get in here!
There's a car chase on the news!

1523
01:17:34,963 --> 01:17:37,011
When is Dad gonna be here?

1524
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:38,323
He'll be here.

1525
01:17:38,763 --> 01:17:39,924
Are you a little upset?

1526
01:17:40,003 --> 01:17:45,214
Do you want to do that thing where
we sort of talk about our feelings?

1527
01:17:45,363 --> 01:17:47,365
- Oh, God, no.
- Okay.

1528
01:17:47,523 --> 01:17:51,414
This is the pulse of what's going on
in our country right now.

1529
01:17:51,723 --> 01:17:52,963
Freddie, what's going on?

1530
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,091
Why is there
a local car chase on the TV?

1531
01:17:55,163 --> 01:17:56,733
It's Burgundy. He insisted!

1532
01:17:56,843 --> 01:17:58,684
Can't you see what
the son of a bitch is doing?

1533
01:17:58,723 --> 01:18:00,373
We didn't have a story, so he made one.

1534
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:01,888
You can't do that!

1535
01:18:02,163 --> 01:18:04,052
Tell Ron to speculate
who's driving the car.

1536
01:18:04,123 --> 01:18:07,047
Ron, speculate on who's driving the car.

1537
01:18:07,403 --> 01:18:11,203
We believe the driver may be on drugs.

1538
01:18:11,283 --> 01:18:13,809
He's probably 6'7 ", 6'8".

1539
01:18:13,883 --> 01:18:16,409
But a skinny 6'7 ", 6'8". About 160.

1540
01:18:16,563 --> 01:18:18,804
He may have a hostage or two.

1541
01:18:18,923 --> 01:18:20,971
We don't know. He could have...

1542
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:23,927
The phone lines are lighting up.
It's about the chase!

1543
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:25,414
I've never seen anything like it!

1544
01:18:25,723 --> 01:18:28,886
Mr. Arafat, is there any scenario

1545
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:31,364
by which peace
could be reached with Israel?

1546
01:18:31,443 --> 01:18:33,764
Peace is what burns in my heart.
I am committed to...

1547
01:18:33,883 --> 01:18:34,884
What was... Excuse me.

1548
01:18:35,563 --> 01:18:36,974
What happened to the...

1549
01:18:37,363 --> 01:18:39,083
The network cut to
another developing story.

1550
01:18:39,123 --> 01:18:41,046
Some kind of crazy car chase.

1551
01:18:41,123 --> 01:18:43,125
Who covers a car chase?

1552
01:18:43,363 --> 01:18:47,607
I am sitting here with the most important
interview of my entire career,

1553
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:49,528
and they're cutting to a car chase?

1554
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:51,288
I would like to watch the car chase.

1555
01:18:51,363 --> 01:18:52,603
You need to shut your mouth.

1556
01:18:52,683 --> 01:18:53,969
This is extremely gripping.

1557
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:56,734
He just hit a car! He just hit a car!

1558
01:18:56,803 --> 01:18:58,043
He hit a car! Did you see that?

1559
01:18:58,123 --> 01:18:59,124
He hit a car!

1560
01:19:00,283 --> 01:19:01,728
- He hit the car!
- He hit the car!

1561
01:19:01,843 --> 01:19:03,891
When did the news get awesome?

1562
01:19:04,763 --> 01:19:06,731
And he just loses it!

1563
01:19:06,803 --> 01:19:09,773
That's exactly what we needed.
It was getting a little boring...

1564
01:19:13,243 --> 01:19:15,610
Hey. You did a great job.

1565
01:19:15,723 --> 01:19:17,612
Thanks, Gary.

1566
01:19:17,763 --> 01:19:19,208
I don't think your dad's coming.

1567
01:19:19,283 --> 01:19:21,206
I'm sorry, honey,
but I think we need to go.

1568
01:19:22,803 --> 01:19:24,931
Stop reading my mind!

1569
01:19:25,603 --> 01:19:26,809
All right.

1570
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:32,965
I mean, this is what I worry about.

1571
01:19:34,683 --> 01:19:38,005
- Did you do that with your mind?
- No.

1572
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:39,244
Liar.

1573
01:19:39,403 --> 01:19:43,453
We're just getting word that police
have finally apprehended the suspect.

1574
01:19:43,963 --> 01:19:48,605
It turns out that he is
an elderly gentleman, he's 80 years old,

1575
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:50,686
- and he was simply confused.
- Unbelievable.

1576
01:19:50,843 --> 01:19:52,129
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1577
01:19:52,483 --> 01:19:56,727
Don't just have a great night,
have an American night.

1578
01:19:58,523 --> 01:20:00,287
And we are clear!

1579
01:20:00,603 --> 01:20:01,604
Yes!

1580
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:03,124
Great!

1581
01:20:03,243 --> 01:20:04,404
All right!

1582
01:20:04,683 --> 01:20:06,651
I don't believe it! You did it, Ron!

1583
01:20:06,763 --> 01:20:09,004
Oh, my goodness. Thanks, Freddie.

1584
01:20:10,123 --> 01:20:11,727
I don't deserve this.

1585
01:20:11,883 --> 01:20:13,931
It was a team effort. It really was.

1586
01:20:22,763 --> 01:20:24,413
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1587
01:20:24,843 --> 01:20:29,326
we all know there's one reason
that GNN has gotten to the top.

1588
01:20:29,923 --> 01:20:33,450
And that reason is the greatest
bloody newsman in the world.

1589
01:20:33,523 --> 01:20:35,127
Long may he reign!

1590
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:36,410
Mr. Ron Burgundy!

1591
01:20:37,243 --> 01:20:39,530
Yeah, Ron! Yeah!

1592
01:20:47,683 --> 01:20:49,367
Fire it up, Ronny!

1593
01:21:13,283 --> 01:21:14,489
Let's blaze.

1594
01:21:14,563 --> 01:21:17,248
Yeah. To hell with Ron Burgundy.

1595
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:20,565
We did it, my onyx hellion.

1596
01:21:23,043 --> 01:21:24,044
You're magic!

1597
01:21:26,403 --> 01:21:28,724
Ron, you should see what you're doing!

1598
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,926
In the myth of Icarus,

1599
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:51,253
Icarus, full of the folly
that comes with pride, flew too high

1600
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,768
and the sun melted his wings.

1601
01:21:54,403 --> 01:21:58,328
Burgundy's fame was bigger
than he ever imagined.

1602
01:21:58,923 --> 01:22:01,051
And the fall was dizzying.

1603
01:22:09,363 --> 01:22:10,888
Oh, my God, Ronny!

1604
01:22:11,243 --> 01:22:12,404
Ron!

1605
01:22:12,643 --> 01:22:14,407
- Open the bloody gate.
- Will somebody call an ambulance?

1606
01:22:14,483 --> 01:22:16,770
Do not die in front of us!

1607
01:22:17,763 --> 01:22:20,448
Do not die in front of us!

1608
01:22:22,403 --> 01:22:24,053
Stay classy, Ron Burgundy.

1609
01:22:24,123 --> 01:22:25,966
Somebody call an ambulance!

1610
01:22:37,603 --> 01:22:39,287
Damn it, Milton, what is it?

1611
01:22:39,363 --> 01:22:40,933
Well, Ron...

1612
01:22:42,883 --> 01:22:45,363
It looks as if both optic nerves

1613
01:22:45,483 --> 01:22:48,168
are separated from
their respective corneas.

1614
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:50,805
- What?
- No other way to put this, but...

1615
01:22:51,283 --> 01:22:52,330
You're blind.

1616
01:22:52,403 --> 01:22:54,724
Milton, I'm an anchorman.

1617
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:58,489
I read the news off the teleprompter.
It's what I do!

1618
01:22:58,923 --> 01:23:00,288
HOW will I live?

1619
01:23:00,403 --> 01:23:03,168
I'm no career counselor,
but there are many things you can do.

1620
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:05,531
Be an oracle, or a mystic.

1621
01:23:05,683 --> 01:23:07,287
Clearly, there must be something

1622
01:23:07,363 --> 01:23:10,572
in this new-fangled office
of yours that can help me!

1623
01:23:10,643 --> 01:23:12,452
- Settle down.
- There's got to be something in here!

1624
01:23:12,523 --> 01:23:13,604
Settle down!

1625
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:16,212
Zombies! Zombies!

1626
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:21,328
If you get my hands on me, I'll kill you.

1627
01:23:22,323 --> 01:23:23,973
The world of the blind.

1628
01:23:24,043 --> 01:23:28,093
Ron Burgundy, a man who had
flourished in a visual medium,

1629
01:23:28,163 --> 01:23:31,565
had forever entered
this realm of darkness.

1630
01:23:31,843 --> 01:23:33,447
Always lonely

1631
01:23:35,123 --> 01:23:37,524
Always looking

1632
01:23:39,123 --> 01:23:43,845
To get even with the men
who did him wrong

1633
01:23:46,363 --> 01:23:48,331
That was Billy

1634
01:23:50,203 --> 01:23:51,204
Who is it?

1635
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,972
Ron, it's us!

1636
01:23:56,043 --> 01:23:59,331
I'm sure you gentlemen
are famished from your travels.

1637
01:23:59,403 --> 01:24:03,089
I hope you like Triscuits
and some pimento loaf.

1638
01:24:03,363 --> 01:24:05,445
Still hot off the griddle!

1639
01:24:05,803 --> 01:24:06,964
There we go.

1640
01:24:07,523 --> 01:24:09,764
Well, everyone at the station
really misses you, Ron.

1641
01:24:10,603 --> 01:24:13,174
Jack Lime's been filling in for you
since you've been gone.

1642
01:24:13,683 --> 01:24:15,811
You know, he's really not
such a bad guy after all.

1643
01:24:17,163 --> 01:24:18,972
He goes by Jack Lamé now.

1644
01:24:19,043 --> 01:24:20,932
Well, he shouldn't be doing that.

1645
01:24:21,003 --> 01:24:22,653
He should be going by Jack Lame.

1646
01:24:23,043 --> 01:24:24,124
Brick!

1647
01:24:24,203 --> 01:24:25,250
Brick.

1648
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:27,605
That's checkers and caulk.
Don't eat that.

1649
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:30,492
What about Linda? She hasn't called.

1650
01:24:30,563 --> 01:24:31,849
Linda's pretty busy.

1651
01:24:32,283 --> 01:24:34,570
Ron, I'm going to need your recipe.

1652
01:24:34,723 --> 01:24:36,373
So, Ron, what do you do
with yourself all day?

1653
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:38,252
You're just out here pretty
much away from everything.

1654
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,451
Well, every day begins about the same.

1655
01:24:40,923 --> 01:24:43,005
I wake up screaming in terror

1656
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:45,006
because of the blackness
and I think I'm dead.

1657
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:46,130
Every day?

1658
01:24:46,243 --> 01:24:47,927
Yes! Every day!

1659
01:24:48,043 --> 01:24:51,206
And then I begin what's called
The Great Adventure.

1660
01:24:51,363 --> 01:24:53,047
Making breakfast.

1661
01:24:53,243 --> 01:24:55,849
I've eaten everything
from nails to drink coasters.

1662
01:24:55,963 --> 01:24:58,569
One time I bit hard
into a marble ashtray,

1663
01:24:58,643 --> 01:25:00,532
thinking it was a savory waffle.

1664
01:25:00,803 --> 01:25:05,172
I wanted that waffle so bad!
Completely shattered my teeth.

1665
01:25:05,243 --> 01:25:07,610
Couldn't you tell
the ashtray wasn't hot like a waffle?

1666
01:25:07,683 --> 01:25:10,129
No! I couldn't! Because I'm blind!

1667
01:25:10,363 --> 01:25:14,209
I'm not blind
23 hours a day or 22 hours a day,

1668
01:25:14,283 --> 01:25:17,253
I'm blind the whole goddamn time!

1669
01:25:17,323 --> 01:25:20,532
Do you have any idea what it's like
to drink a half a bottle of ketchup

1670
01:25:20,603 --> 01:25:24,403
thinking it was a bottle of
1946 Chéteauneuf-du-Pape?

1671
01:25:25,963 --> 01:25:27,089
I even decanted it!

1672
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:30,686
If you drank half a bottle
of that, that's like...

1673
01:25:30,963 --> 01:25:32,488
That's like nine or 10 gulps.

1674
01:25:32,563 --> 01:25:34,167
I mean, you couldn't tell
that was ketchup?

1675
01:25:34,243 --> 01:25:35,654
Did I stutter?

1676
01:25:35,723 --> 01:25:38,727
I'm ba-lind!

1677
01:25:38,803 --> 01:25:40,612
You're having a tough time, Ron, I know.

1678
01:25:40,843 --> 01:25:42,572
You know what the biggest indignity is?

1679
01:25:43,283 --> 01:25:44,773
I can't even masturbate!

1680
01:25:44,843 --> 01:25:47,892
- Why?
- Heck, one morning, I spent 20 minutes

1681
01:25:48,003 --> 01:25:52,770
aggressively rubbing my shin,
wondering, "Where's the sensation?

1682
01:25:52,843 --> 01:25:53,990
"Where's the pleasure coming?"

1683
01:25:54,003 --> 01:25:56,370
You rubbed your shin
thinking it was a penis?

1684
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:58,366
- I know you think I'm stupid, don't you?
- No!

1685
01:25:58,603 --> 01:26:00,970
The weirdo who lives
in the weird lighthouse

1686
01:26:01,043 --> 01:26:02,283
in the middle of nowhere.

1687
01:26:02,363 --> 01:26:04,730
Ron, it was your choice to
live in a "weird lighthouse."

1688
01:26:04,803 --> 01:26:06,089
You know why I live here?

1689
01:26:06,363 --> 01:26:10,209
Let me say it real slow and real loud.

1690
01:26:11,003 --> 01:26:12,812
I'm

1691
01:26:12,883 --> 01:26:15,568
blind!

1692
01:26:16,563 --> 01:26:18,088
I guess we should get out of here.

1693
01:26:18,163 --> 01:26:19,608
Maybe you should go. Yes.

1694
01:26:20,003 --> 01:26:21,653
Why don't you guys get out of here!

1695
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:24,649
Despite my complete and utter isolation,

1696
01:26:24,723 --> 01:26:27,852
your gentlemen's visit
has actually made it worse!

1697
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:36,968
Goodbye, Ron.

1698
01:26:39,203 --> 01:26:40,204
What?

1699
01:26:41,163 --> 01:26:42,244
No, don't go!

1700
01:26:42,643 --> 01:26:46,807
Please! Wait! I'm all alone! Come back!

1701
01:26:51,763 --> 01:26:54,289
Wait! Come back!

1702
01:26:55,203 --> 01:26:56,932
Come back!

1703
01:27:00,163 --> 01:27:01,733
I'm alone!

1704
01:27:02,603 --> 01:27:06,403
Why have you
done this to me, God? Why?

1705
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:10,844
Couldn't you have cured a sick
child or created a new animal?

1706
01:27:11,123 --> 01:27:14,923
But, no, you had to
make Ron Burgundy blind!

1707
01:27:16,203 --> 01:27:17,614
Well, I never thought that I would see

1708
01:27:17,683 --> 01:27:21,210
the Ron Burgundy
full of so much self-pity.

1709
01:27:21,283 --> 01:27:24,093
Who is it? What is that noise?

1710
01:27:24,403 --> 01:27:25,404
Take my hand.

1711
01:27:26,123 --> 01:27:27,454
I can't see it!

1712
01:27:27,523 --> 01:27:28,763
Reach for it, Ron!

1713
01:27:29,243 --> 01:27:31,484
You have to learn to do for yourself now.

1714
01:27:32,363 --> 01:27:34,206
All right. This... Okay. Here we go.

1715
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:35,614
Get up. There we go.

1716
01:27:38,283 --> 01:27:39,694
Cher, is that you?

1717
01:27:39,803 --> 01:27:41,567
You can't recognize me by my voice?

1718
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:43,693
Jan-Michael Vincent?

1719
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:45,084
Really?

1720
01:27:45,523 --> 01:27:48,003
Every news station
is copying what you did, Ron.

1721
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:53,328
All the stories are about animals,
or car chases or strip clubs.

1722
01:27:53,603 --> 01:27:55,970
The genie has been let out of the bottle,

1723
01:27:56,483 --> 01:27:58,724
and old Ron Burgundy popped the cork.

1724
01:27:58,843 --> 01:28:01,414
- That's why I quit <i>WBC News.</i>
- What?

1725
01:28:01,523 --> 01:28:03,764
There's no real news
being reported out there.

1726
01:28:03,883 --> 01:28:05,214
It's just all about ratings.

1727
01:28:05,483 --> 01:28:06,848
Veronica.

1728
01:28:07,363 --> 01:28:08,649
Why are you here?

1729
01:28:08,803 --> 01:28:10,487
I'm here for our son, Ron.

1730
01:28:10,843 --> 01:28:12,254
Walter needs you.

1731
01:28:12,323 --> 01:28:16,214
I need you to start taking responsibility
for him and for yourself.

1732
01:28:16,283 --> 01:28:18,172
Do you realize you're talking to a man

1733
01:28:18,243 --> 01:28:22,089
who just this morning tried
to brush his teeth with a live lobster?

1734
01:28:22,283 --> 01:28:23,489
What?

1735
01:28:24,643 --> 01:28:26,532
You would've
known the second that you touched it...

1736
01:28:26,603 --> 01:28:29,573
I'm just saying it's not
going to be a cakewalk.

1737
01:28:29,963 --> 01:28:32,330
Well, then we best get to it.

1738
01:28:32,843 --> 01:28:34,004
Now, drink your tea.

1739
01:28:38,403 --> 01:28:41,964
- Let me get a sponge. I'll get it.
- All right. No, no, just stay there.

1740
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:44,091
I'll have it cleaned up in a jiffy.

1741
01:28:54,723 --> 01:28:55,929
Let's try this again.

1742
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:57,607
- Did you throw it?
- Yes, I threw it.

1743
01:28:57,843 --> 01:28:59,413
Just remember the curves.

1744
01:28:59,763 --> 01:29:00,730
The curves.

1745
01:29:00,803 --> 01:29:02,851
- The green eyes.
- Green eyes.

1746
01:29:03,043 --> 01:29:04,966
You have to use your other senses now!

1747
01:29:05,243 --> 01:29:06,608
I can't do it!

1748
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:10,923
Baxter found something on the beach!

1749
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,094
Ron, be careful!

1750
01:29:13,923 --> 01:29:14,924
It's okay!

1751
01:29:15,323 --> 01:29:18,930
- Walter, what is it?
- It's some kind of fish!

1752
01:29:20,403 --> 01:29:21,848
Oh, my goodness!

1753
01:29:21,963 --> 01:29:25,445
If he stays tangled in this net,
he's not going to survive.

1754
01:29:25,563 --> 01:29:27,406
Walter, sweetheart, it's a shark.

1755
01:29:27,723 --> 01:29:31,967
Son, don't you worry,
we won't let this fellow die.

1756
01:29:32,323 --> 01:29:34,166
We'll do it together, Dad.

1757
01:29:38,803 --> 01:29:41,124
That should keep him in
there until he's strong enough

1758
01:29:41,203 --> 01:29:42,807
to swim out to the deep ocean.

1759
01:29:43,123 --> 01:29:44,249
Can I name him?

1760
01:29:44,323 --> 01:29:46,052
Of course you can, son.

1761
01:29:46,243 --> 01:29:49,213
What about Crackers?

1762
01:29:49,323 --> 01:29:51,564
Give me a goddamned break.

1763
01:29:51,643 --> 01:29:55,250
Seriously, you've got one of the most
vicious predators in the ocean,

1764
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,813
you're gonna name him "Crackers"?

1765
01:29:56,883 --> 01:30:02,128
In the future when you say I can name
something, don't be a dick about it.

1766
01:30:02,203 --> 01:30:04,888
Why don't we do this?
Let's name him Doby.

1767
01:30:05,003 --> 01:30:09,167
You talk all that smack and that's
the best name you come up with?

1768
01:30:09,243 --> 01:30:11,245
Well, we're not gonna get
any better than that.

1769
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:15,726
I mean, you obviously can't
name him anything that sounds good.

1770
01:30:15,803 --> 01:30:20,491
How about we forget about this whole
name thing and you go straight to hell?

1771
01:30:20,603 --> 01:30:22,253
Well, I don't know what to do.

1772
01:30:22,323 --> 01:30:25,805
We might as well
poison the water and let him die.

1773
01:30:25,883 --> 01:30:28,489
Let's just go with Doby.

1774
01:30:28,563 --> 01:30:31,043
Fine, then it's settled. It's Doby.

1775
01:30:31,123 --> 01:30:35,094
We'll call him Doby
even though no one likes it.

1776
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:37,211
All right, I can live with that.

1777
01:30:39,163 --> 01:30:42,645
Don't worry, Baxter.
We won't feed him your dog food.

1778
01:30:47,763 --> 01:30:50,733
Even though Ron Burgundy
had lost his sight,

1779
01:30:50,883 --> 01:30:53,045
he had never seen so clearly.

1780
01:30:53,523 --> 01:30:54,524
You did it!

1781
01:30:54,603 --> 01:30:59,211
And with every inch Doby grew,
so did Ron's heart.

1782
01:31:10,243 --> 01:31:12,564
It's just a bunch of crazy lines, isn't it?

1783
01:31:12,843 --> 01:31:15,574
No. It's beautiful.

1784
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:18,687
It's beautiful.

1785
01:31:33,323 --> 01:31:35,052
What about Gary?

1786
01:31:35,163 --> 01:31:36,847
We split up two weeks ago.

1787
01:31:37,043 --> 01:31:40,013
He was too emotionally stable.
It was so annoying!

1788
01:31:40,323 --> 01:31:43,611
And so, just like
the passing of the seasons,

1789
01:31:43,883 --> 01:31:45,885
it came time for Doby to return

1790
01:31:45,963 --> 01:31:48,284
to the deep waters
he was meant to call home.

1791
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:50,446
I hear his tail splashing!

1792
01:31:50,563 --> 01:31:52,167
He's actually swimming away!

1793
01:31:52,603 --> 01:31:54,765
Is he looking back for us
over his shoulder?

1794
01:31:54,923 --> 01:31:56,652
Sharks don't have shoulders, Ron.

1795
01:31:56,723 --> 01:32:00,648
No, he just swam away,
and he's instantly looking for fish to eat.

1796
01:32:01,163 --> 01:32:02,813
He was my best friend.

1797
01:32:04,483 --> 01:32:05,928
You

1798
01:32:06,283 --> 01:32:08,490
Swam with strength

1799
01:32:10,283 --> 01:32:11,728
You

1800
01:32:12,123 --> 01:32:15,127
Loved with grace

1801
01:32:15,643 --> 01:32:19,568
You touched us all

1802
01:32:20,123 --> 01:32:24,447
With your expressionless face

1803
01:32:27,443 --> 01:32:29,889
Doby, oh, Doby

1804
01:32:29,963 --> 01:32:33,490
May you find many treasures

1805
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:37,973
Both emotional and monetary

1806
01:32:39,643 --> 01:32:42,806
You were wise and loving

1807
01:32:42,883 --> 01:32:46,126
And never contrary

1808
01:32:46,443 --> 01:32:48,172
Doby

1809
01:32:48,483 --> 01:32:50,690
Oh, Doby

1810
01:32:51,323 --> 01:32:53,929
I'll never forget thee

1811
01:32:57,883 --> 01:32:59,612
Doby

1812
01:32:59,883 --> 01:33:02,409
Oh, Doby

1813
01:33:02,563 --> 01:33:05,248
I'll never forget thee

1814
01:33:09,563 --> 01:33:12,089
Promise you'll always
be there for me, Dad?

1815
01:33:12,163 --> 01:33:13,608
I promise.

1816
01:33:13,883 --> 01:33:15,772
If I say I'll be there for you,

1817
01:33:15,843 --> 01:33:18,323
there's nothing on God's earth
that will stop me.

1818
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:19,934
I love you, Dad.

1819
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:22,529
Let's get back up to
the lighthouse, all right?

1820
01:33:22,643 --> 01:33:24,088
- Come on.
- Okay.

1821
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:25,889
Let's go.

1822
01:33:26,843 --> 01:33:30,734
I hope you eat lots of fish
and people, Doby.

1823
01:33:36,683 --> 01:33:37,764
There you are.

1824
01:33:37,883 --> 01:33:41,285
I found the most beautiful
clams down by the estuary.

1825
01:33:41,363 --> 01:33:43,411
I thought we could steam
them up tonight

1826
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:45,724
with a nice butter sauce

1827
01:33:46,043 --> 01:33:47,647
and some wine.

1828
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:50,370
Veronica.

1829
01:33:50,683 --> 01:33:51,923
Yes, Ron?

1830
01:33:52,683 --> 01:33:54,208
Can you explain this?

1831
01:33:57,203 --> 01:34:00,446
Ron, this is Dr. Brangley.
I've left dozens of messages.

1832
01:34:00,523 --> 01:34:02,287
Somehow, they must be getting erased.

1833
01:34:02,363 --> 01:34:06,527
But there is a procedure
that can possibly return your sight.

1834
01:34:06,883 --> 01:34:09,534
Please get back to me
if you're interested.

1835
01:34:09,843 --> 01:34:13,131
Well? Have you been
erasing these messages?

1836
01:34:13,283 --> 01:34:16,014
Yes. Ron, just let me explain.

1837
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:17,164
How could you?

1838
01:34:17,243 --> 01:34:20,087
We've never been this happy,
and I just thought that...

1839
01:34:20,163 --> 01:34:21,892
Thought that if I could see again,

1840
01:34:21,963 --> 01:34:24,204
that somehow I couldn't
love you and Walter anymore?

1841
01:34:24,363 --> 01:34:25,364
Yes!

1842
01:34:25,963 --> 01:34:30,013
Damn you, woman! You lied to me!

1843
01:34:31,003 --> 01:34:32,732
I gave you everything!

1844
01:34:32,883 --> 01:34:36,046
I gave you my heart, my smile,

1845
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:38,323
my seed.

1846
01:34:39,003 --> 01:34:40,243
And you lied to me.

1847
01:34:40,403 --> 01:34:41,768
- Dad!
- Sweetheart.

1848
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:43,333
No! Dad!

1849
01:34:43,563 --> 01:34:45,327
Don't leave, Dad!

1850
01:34:45,883 --> 01:34:47,294
- Dad!
- Walter, just...

1851
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:49,084
Sweetheart, we have to let him go.

1852
01:34:50,003 --> 01:34:51,732
He needs to go free.

1853
01:34:52,723 --> 01:34:54,213
Just like Doby.

1854
01:34:54,723 --> 01:34:57,044
He'll be back. He promised.

1855
01:34:58,603 --> 01:35:01,971
Could you please call me a damn cab?
I'm blind!

1856
01:35:02,043 --> 01:35:03,044
Of course!

1857
01:35:03,923 --> 01:35:06,847
Ron, the operation was a success.

1858
01:35:07,283 --> 01:35:10,287
But we won't know for sure
until we remove the bandages.

1859
01:35:16,643 --> 01:35:17,974
Well?

1860
01:35:18,243 --> 01:35:19,449
Yes.

1861
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,130
I can see.

1862
01:35:25,403 --> 01:35:28,930
Oh, God, oh, God.
It's Ron Burgundy, everyone!

1863
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:30,687
You are my inspiration.

1864
01:35:30,803 --> 01:35:32,567
Well, thank you.

1865
01:35:33,803 --> 01:35:34,850
Welcome back, Ron.

1866
01:35:35,123 --> 01:35:36,693
Thanks. Thanks, Bri-man.

1867
01:35:37,203 --> 01:35:38,534
Good luck in Vietnam.

1868
01:35:39,283 --> 01:35:40,614
Brick.

1869
01:35:40,763 --> 01:35:42,049
Brick and I are having a baby!

1870
01:35:42,123 --> 01:35:43,603
We're gonna name him
Tortilla Jackson.

1871
01:35:43,643 --> 01:35:45,407
- All right.
- I'm 22 months pregnant.

1872
01:35:45,483 --> 01:35:46,609
Well, get over here, you bastard.

1873
01:35:46,683 --> 01:35:47,923
Got you a drink, Ron. Come on.

1874
01:35:49,003 --> 01:35:52,689
Hold on to that drink.
I just want to grab some air.

1875
01:36:04,643 --> 01:36:06,133
How you doing there?

1876
01:36:08,323 --> 01:36:10,769
I'm fine. Just...

1877
01:36:11,883 --> 01:36:13,408
Just a lot of people in there.

1878
01:36:13,683 --> 01:36:17,654
Listen, Ron,
I'm sorry that I never called or visited.

1879
01:36:17,843 --> 01:36:19,652
There's no need to explain.

1880
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:21,404
But, listen, I mean, you're back.

1881
01:36:21,443 --> 01:36:22,444
Hello, Ron.

1882
01:36:23,963 --> 01:36:25,124
What are you doing here?

1883
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:28,412
I had to come tell you
something very important.

1884
01:36:30,403 --> 01:36:31,689
You must be Linda Jackson.

1885
01:36:32,043 --> 01:36:33,454
You must be Veronica.

1886
01:36:33,523 --> 01:36:35,013
Yes, I am. It's a pleasure.

1887
01:36:35,203 --> 01:36:36,887
This is a touching moment for me.

1888
01:36:36,963 --> 01:36:41,366
Please, don't take this the wrong way,
but if you touch Ron again,

1889
01:36:41,483 --> 01:36:43,929
I will shoot you
in the cooch with a B.B. gun.

1890
01:36:44,923 --> 01:36:46,413
You can talk big all you want,

1891
01:36:46,483 --> 01:36:48,884
but guess what,
this kitten's got claws, bitch.

1892
01:36:49,443 --> 01:36:50,524
Don't mess with me, Linda,

1893
01:36:50,843 --> 01:36:53,972
because this "White Thunder" rolls
deep and it rolls nasty.

1894
01:36:54,203 --> 01:36:55,728
I was feeling a little bit down,

1895
01:36:55,803 --> 01:36:57,931
but this is definitely
picking up my mood.

1896
01:36:58,083 --> 01:37:00,211
Well, I guess I'll leave you two alone.

1897
01:37:00,283 --> 01:37:03,287
And it's been an absolute pleasure,
Ms. Corningstone.

1898
01:37:03,483 --> 01:37:04,484
This has been great.

1899
01:37:04,563 --> 01:37:06,372
Do you guys want to kiss real quick?

1900
01:37:06,443 --> 01:37:08,332
Ron. Read the room.

1901
01:37:08,603 --> 01:37:10,048
I'll take that as a no.

1902
01:37:10,763 --> 01:37:12,492
Bye, Linda.

1903
01:37:13,043 --> 01:37:15,125
I know why you haven't
been returning my messages.

1904
01:37:15,243 --> 01:37:19,407
I wasn't calling for me, I was calling
because Walter has a piano recital

1905
01:37:19,523 --> 01:37:22,288
in half an hour
at the Tishman School on 65th Street.

1906
01:37:22,363 --> 01:37:24,889
And he wrote a piece for you, Ron.

1907
01:37:25,843 --> 01:37:26,890
Walter.

1908
01:37:26,963 --> 01:37:29,887
It would mean the absolute
world to him to have you there.

1909
01:37:29,963 --> 01:37:33,251
Ron, I just got a call
from the control room! Big fan.

1910
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:37,485
Actress Sheila Blackledge,
the mom from the hit sitcom

1911
01:37:37,563 --> 01:37:39,611
Four's a Family, Five's a Crowd,

1912
01:37:39,723 --> 01:37:42,203
she just found out
her husband cheated on her

1913
01:37:42,283 --> 01:37:45,127
and she severed his penis
while he slept!

1914
01:37:45,243 --> 01:37:46,290
Oh, my goodness.

1915
01:37:46,403 --> 01:37:50,044
The police arrived.
She fled in her white Bronco,

1916
01:37:50,123 --> 01:37:53,650
and now they're engaged
in a high-speed car chase!

1917
01:37:53,763 --> 01:37:55,891
We've got an exclusive on the live feed,

1918
01:37:55,963 --> 01:37:57,931
but we've got to go, right now!

1919
01:37:58,043 --> 01:38:01,252
Ron, this can be your comeback.

1920
01:38:01,603 --> 01:38:03,844
- Veronica, I...
- No, Ron. No.

1921
01:38:04,763 --> 01:38:06,652
That will get sky-high ratings.

1922
01:38:07,203 --> 01:38:10,207
- Walter will understand.
- Walter will understand.

1923
01:38:10,763 --> 01:38:11,844
Go.

1924
01:38:12,603 --> 01:38:14,128
Come on, Ron. Priorities!

1925
01:38:14,323 --> 01:38:16,166
- Veronica!
- Come on!

1926
01:38:18,283 --> 01:38:20,012
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, yes.

1927
01:38:20,123 --> 01:38:21,403
You're coming in loud and clear.

1928
01:38:21,443 --> 01:38:22,888
You're back and you get this story.

1929
01:38:23,003 --> 01:38:24,846
- This is gonna be huge.
- Right.

1930
01:38:24,963 --> 01:38:26,692
So, is it good to be back home?

1931
01:38:26,763 --> 01:38:28,174
Yeah, I feel good.

1932
01:38:28,243 --> 01:38:30,814
God, look at him.
Like a beacon in the night!

1933
01:38:31,443 --> 01:38:32,808
My golden goose.

1934
01:38:32,883 --> 01:38:33,964
All right, baby.

1935
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:35,653
So I'm just gonna be
giving you the details.

1936
01:38:35,803 --> 01:38:37,168
Five, four,

1937
01:38:37,243 --> 01:38:38,483
three, two...

1938
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:41,130
Good evening, America.

1939
01:38:41,203 --> 01:38:45,367
After some time off,
it's good to be back with you.

1940
01:38:45,483 --> 01:38:47,053
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1941
01:38:47,123 --> 01:38:50,491
We have a story tonight
involving an affair,

1942
01:38:50,563 --> 01:38:55,012
a cut-off penis,
a TV star and a car chase.

1943
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:56,448
And throw it to the feed.

1944
01:38:58,603 --> 01:39:00,014
The only problem is...

1945
01:39:01,563 --> 01:39:03,452
- What's he doing?
- Ron, are you okay?

1946
01:39:04,163 --> 01:39:05,574
- It's not news.
- What?

1947
01:39:05,643 --> 01:39:06,849
Turn off the prompter.

1948
01:39:07,003 --> 01:39:08,004
Ron, this is Kench.

1949
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:09,414
What the hell do you think
you're doing, mate?

1950
01:39:09,483 --> 01:39:13,169
Just read what's in front of you,
or I will ruin you! Don't!

1951
01:39:13,323 --> 01:39:15,405
Don't!
You leave Kench inside your head!

1952
01:39:16,363 --> 01:39:18,889
- God damn it!
- He took out his earpiece.

1953
01:39:19,003 --> 01:39:21,813
You see, folks,
I've read a lot of news in my day,

1954
01:39:23,163 --> 01:39:26,485
but it's... It's taken me until now

1955
01:39:27,523 --> 01:39:29,890
to realize what real news is.

1956
01:39:30,283 --> 01:39:32,684
Real news is supposed
to let people know

1957
01:39:32,883 --> 01:39:37,172
what the powerful are up to, so that
that power doesn't become corrupt.

1958
01:39:37,523 --> 01:39:39,730
But what happens when
the powerful own the news?

1959
01:39:39,803 --> 01:39:42,044
You piece of shit!

1960
01:39:42,163 --> 01:39:44,006
Shit. He's blowing the whole thing up.

1961
01:39:44,283 --> 01:39:47,207
Recently, I've been
on a bit of a personal journey.

1962
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:51,369
I made love to a proud,
intelligent black woman.

1963
01:39:52,923 --> 01:39:54,448
I became blind.

1964
01:39:55,003 --> 01:39:57,370
I bottle-fed and raised a shark.

1965
01:39:57,803 --> 01:40:00,409
And I smoked a fair amount of crack.

1966
01:40:00,843 --> 01:40:05,292
But the most important thing I've learned
is that there was an emptiness left

1967
01:40:05,883 --> 01:40:09,649
after turning my back on three of the
best friends anyone could ever ask for.

1968
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:11,289
Hi, Ron!

1969
01:40:11,403 --> 01:40:13,087
So, if you'll excuse me,

1970
01:40:13,163 --> 01:40:15,404
I'm going to see my child's recital

1971
01:40:15,483 --> 01:40:19,329
and tell the woman I love
that I still love her.

1972
01:40:20,603 --> 01:40:23,413
Good night, America, and never forget,

1973
01:40:24,643 --> 01:40:25,883
you deserve the truth.

1974
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:31,528
Good. He's dead, done.

1975
01:40:31,603 --> 01:40:33,810
Linda, get the skirt in,
the blonde. Anyone!

1976
01:40:33,923 --> 01:40:35,493
He's coming back!

1977
01:40:35,563 --> 01:40:37,292
Also, one other thing.

1978
01:40:37,363 --> 01:40:40,333
Koala Airlines is a really shitty airline.

1979
01:40:40,563 --> 01:40:43,646
You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

1980
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:49,044
Guys, I'm sorry.

1981
01:40:49,483 --> 01:40:52,612
For a while there, I don't know
what became of Ron Burgundy.

1982
01:40:52,923 --> 01:40:55,494
Brick, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1983
01:40:56,363 --> 01:40:57,444
Brian, I...

1984
01:40:57,603 --> 01:40:59,924
No reason why I killed
that story of yours.

1985
01:41:00,003 --> 01:41:01,334
It was excellent reporting.

1986
01:41:01,763 --> 01:41:05,006
And, Champ, I'm sorry
I said no to all those

1987
01:41:05,123 --> 01:41:08,923
offers for late-night
deep-tissue rubdowns.

1988
01:41:10,443 --> 01:41:12,127
Ron, you're a good man.

1989
01:41:12,203 --> 01:41:15,525
But you have fallen victim
to your own ego and your own hubris.

1990
01:41:16,043 --> 01:41:19,525
And before others can forgive you,
you must learn to forgive yourself.

1991
01:41:22,923 --> 01:41:23,970
What was that, Brick?

1992
01:41:24,443 --> 01:41:26,172
I'm wearing two pairs of pants.

1993
01:41:27,763 --> 01:41:28,844
Thank you.

1994
01:41:29,043 --> 01:41:30,807
So that's it?

1995
01:41:30,883 --> 01:41:32,772
You're sorry?

1996
01:41:32,843 --> 01:41:36,165
You know what, Burgundy?
Apologies are like assholes.

1997
01:41:36,243 --> 01:41:37,449
Everyone's got one

1998
01:41:37,523 --> 01:41:40,572
and everyone's got a shoebox
full of Polaroids of them under the bed.

1999
01:41:41,523 --> 01:41:43,252
Ron, we're a team.

2000
01:41:43,323 --> 01:41:44,484
We need you.

2001
01:41:44,723 --> 01:41:46,213
Let him go, Champ.

2002
01:41:51,443 --> 01:41:52,683
Ron!

2003
01:41:53,363 --> 01:41:56,253
Long live Ron Burgundy!

2004
01:42:04,763 --> 01:42:07,528
I'm Brick Tamland for GNN News.

2005
01:42:08,243 --> 01:42:11,929
The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout.

2006
01:42:12,203 --> 01:42:13,932
You little hack!

2007
01:42:14,283 --> 01:42:15,853
Who the hell do you think you are?

2008
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:17,209
After everything I've done for you,

2009
01:42:17,283 --> 01:42:19,729
this is how you repay me?
Well, I will crush you!

2010
01:42:22,563 --> 01:42:24,053
Once again, Mr. Burgundy,

2011
01:42:24,123 --> 01:42:26,808
you are the ballsiest
white man I've ever known.

2012
01:42:26,883 --> 01:42:28,487
What the hell?

2013
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:31,132
One more for old times' sake.

2014
01:42:37,723 --> 01:42:38,724
Thank you.

2015
01:42:38,803 --> 01:42:40,851
Is Dad going to come?

2016
01:42:40,923 --> 01:42:42,812
No, sweetheart, Daddy has to work.

2017
01:42:42,883 --> 01:42:45,045
He's going to come. I know it.

2018
01:42:45,363 --> 01:42:46,569
Taxi!

2019
01:42:47,243 --> 01:42:49,245
Taxi! Taxi!

2020
01:42:49,323 --> 01:42:50,404
Damn it!

2021
01:42:50,723 --> 01:42:53,966
It's so hard for a proud Mexican
to get a taxi in this city!

2022
01:42:54,803 --> 01:42:56,134
I need to see my son!

2023
01:42:56,563 --> 01:43:00,807
And now, to play an original
composition that he wrote for his father,

2024
01:43:00,923 --> 01:43:03,767
here is seven-year-old Walter Burgundy.

2025
01:43:12,443 --> 01:43:14,923
I made a promise!
I made a promise to my son!

2026
01:43:18,603 --> 01:43:19,650
What the hell?

2027
01:43:20,163 --> 01:43:21,767
Well, hello, Ron.

2028
01:43:22,283 --> 01:43:23,444
You out for a jog?

2029
01:43:23,643 --> 01:43:25,008
Jack Lime!

2030
01:43:26,203 --> 01:43:27,443
Where's everyone going?

2031
01:43:27,563 --> 01:43:30,567
Please. I don't have time to talk, okay?
I have to be somewhere.

2032
01:43:30,963 --> 01:43:32,852
Well, that's funny.
'Cause I got nowhere to be

2033
01:43:33,483 --> 01:43:35,690
because you pretty much
destroyed my career.

2034
01:43:36,283 --> 01:43:39,969
Do you realize what it did to me,
by making me call myself Jack Lame?

2035
01:43:41,043 --> 01:43:42,932
It was a living hell!

2036
01:43:45,643 --> 01:43:48,487
I'm telling you, you have to let me go!

2037
01:43:48,763 --> 01:43:50,652
Don't worry. Four against one.

2038
01:43:51,363 --> 01:43:52,774
This will be over fast.

2039
01:43:53,563 --> 01:43:55,247
Maybe not so fast!

2040
01:43:58,723 --> 01:44:00,964
My news team. Thank God!

2041
01:44:02,843 --> 01:44:07,326
Ain't a day that will be or has been
that we don't have Ron Burgundy's back.

2042
01:44:07,523 --> 01:44:09,491
Not a problem.
When I'm done with these mutts,

2043
01:44:09,563 --> 01:44:11,053
I'm gonna wipe my shoes on the curb.

2044
01:44:11,163 --> 01:44:12,892
Oh, yeah, Jack Lime?

2045
01:44:13,243 --> 01:44:14,768
When I'm done with you,

2046
01:44:14,843 --> 01:44:17,653
my mom's going to
pick me up and take me home.

2047
01:44:18,003 --> 01:44:19,164
Wait!

2048
01:44:22,683 --> 01:44:24,492
Here's a headline for you.

2049

"Moronic Yank Wankerman

"Gets a Bloody Good Hiding
From News Reader

2051
01:44:30,763 --> 01:44:32,606
"From a Superior Country."

2052
01:44:33,123 --> 01:44:36,366
For we are the BBC News Service.

2053
01:44:38,763 --> 01:44:40,208
No. Not now.

2054
01:44:40,363 --> 01:44:41,524
Fall back, fall back.

2055
01:44:45,643 --> 01:44:46,804
If y'all are gonna get down,

2056
01:44:46,883 --> 01:44:49,727
then Wesley Jackson and
the MTV News crew want in.

2057
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:51,373
What's MTV?

2058
01:44:52,123 --> 01:44:53,454
I think it's a venereal disease.

2059
01:44:53,883 --> 01:44:55,612
The most requested video of the day?

2060
01:44:55,683 --> 01:44:58,766
A new band called
Burgundy's Sucking Chest Wound.

2061
01:45:05,043 --> 01:45:06,886
It wouldn't be a battle
without Jill Janson.

2062
01:45:06,963 --> 01:45:09,364
And Wendy Van Peele
from <i>Entertainment News.</i>

2063
01:45:09,443 --> 01:45:11,684
Entertainment news is an abomination!

2064
01:45:11,923 --> 01:45:14,529
Who are you wearing today?
Look, it's your own blood!

2065
01:45:14,843 --> 01:45:16,572
Today's celebrity birthdays... None.

2066
01:45:16,683 --> 01:45:17,969
Today's celebrity deaths...

2067
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:20,245
All you dick-licks.

2068
01:45:21,843 --> 01:45:23,572
I like the way they're put together.

2069
01:45:23,643 --> 01:45:25,168
I like fighting girls.

2070
01:45:25,243 --> 01:45:27,007
I like to cunt punt cowboys.

2071
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:28,926
- You eat pussy?
- You're gonna.

2072
01:45:29,083 --> 01:45:30,414
Hey!

2073
01:45:31,163 --> 01:45:34,246
There's not gonna
be any fight without Scott Riles

2074
01:45:34,443 --> 01:45:37,014
and the incredibly polite
Canadian News team.

2075
01:45:38,683 --> 01:45:41,289
What about
the French-speaking Quebec News?

2076
01:45:41,403 --> 01:45:42,973
The real voice of Canada!

2077
01:45:43,043 --> 01:45:44,010
Give it a rest, eh?

2078
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:46,689
Give me a break! They can't have news.

2079
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:48,168
Nothing happens in Canada!

2080
01:45:48,323 --> 01:45:49,848
We're gonna mop the floor with you!

2081
01:45:49,923 --> 01:45:51,129
We're gonna put the boots to you!

2082
01:45:51,203 --> 01:45:52,284
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

2083
01:45:52,363 --> 01:45:55,731
We're gonna gouge your eyes out!
And kick your head in!

2084
01:45:55,803 --> 01:45:57,214
- Sorry!
- Sorry!

2085
01:45:57,283 --> 01:45:58,853
I like your ginger ale!

2086
01:46:02,723 --> 01:46:05,294
Jeff Bullington, ESPN, all sports.

2087
01:46:05,363 --> 01:46:07,604
Tonight's play of the day is me,

2088
01:46:07,683 --> 01:46:09,685
extracting your spine
from your dead body.

2089
01:46:09,883 --> 01:46:11,806
Holy shit, there's a lot of news!

2090
01:46:11,963 --> 01:46:14,204
It's true, the market
is becoming saturated.

2091
01:46:14,363 --> 01:46:18,049
Hey. The History Network
wants in on this. We're news, too.

2092
01:46:18,123 --> 01:46:20,729
Only news told much, much later.

2093
01:46:22,323 --> 01:46:25,691
Wait a minute. Is that the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson with you?

2094
01:46:25,803 --> 01:46:28,693
Yes, it is. And the mighty Minotaur.

2095
01:46:29,763 --> 01:46:31,049
I don't know about this, man.

2096
01:46:31,203 --> 01:46:34,127
The Minotaur isn't even history!
He's mythology!

2097
01:46:35,883 --> 01:46:37,647
Let's not downplay the fact

2098
01:46:37,723 --> 01:46:40,169
that that's the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson!

2099
01:46:40,443 --> 01:46:44,607
May the Lord anoint this
hallowed field of battle.

2100
01:46:44,963 --> 01:46:48,285
You guys got room in this
battle for an old war horse?

2101
01:46:48,403 --> 01:46:50,326
Mack Tannen!
What are you doing here?

2102
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:51,609
You're too old for this.

2103
01:46:51,843 --> 01:46:54,164
Well, you see, there's the thing.

2104
01:46:54,243 --> 01:46:59,852
When there's an early moon,
I almost feel like a stallion again!

2105
01:47:00,403 --> 01:47:01,928
He's on our side, right, Ron?

2106
01:47:10,163 --> 01:47:11,608
He's a were-hyena!

2107
01:47:12,963 --> 01:47:15,125
I'm-a call Michael Jackson.
I got a video idea.

2108
01:47:15,443 --> 01:47:17,411
All right, everyone, listen up!

2109
01:47:21,203 --> 01:47:25,925
By virtue of being on this battlefield,
there is no return.

2110
01:47:27,443 --> 01:47:28,968
People will die.

2111
01:47:29,323 --> 01:47:30,563
I'm so horny right now.

2112
01:47:30,643 --> 01:47:32,407
Some will be disfigured.

2113
01:47:32,603 --> 01:47:36,813
In some cases,
lasting friendships will be made.

2114
01:47:37,763 --> 01:47:42,052
And as usual,
no touching of the hair and face.

2115
01:47:42,323 --> 01:47:44,564
Come on.
What do we look like, rookies?

2116
01:47:44,643 --> 01:47:45,690
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

2117
01:47:45,883 --> 01:47:47,647
When El Trousias,

2118
01:47:47,843 --> 01:47:51,006
maiden of the clouds,
blows the battle horn,

2119
01:47:51,603 --> 01:47:53,651
let the battle begin!

2120
01:47:53,803 --> 01:47:56,170
I am El Trousias!

2121
01:47:58,123 --> 01:48:00,330
Hear my siren song!

2122
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:05,533
El Trousias... The Juicies'.

2123
01:48:11,683 --> 01:48:13,173
That means you can start.

2124
01:48:14,603 --> 01:48:16,526
Brick, what the hell is that?

2125
01:48:17,243 --> 01:48:18,574
It's a gun from the future.

2126
01:48:19,003 --> 01:48:20,812
No fair! He's got a gun from the future!

2127
01:48:21,163 --> 01:48:22,972
Where did you get it from?

2128
01:48:38,163 --> 01:48:42,009
In the name of the King,
the Queen and St. George.

2129
01:48:45,003 --> 01:48:46,129
Huzzah!

2130
01:49:18,763 --> 01:49:20,253
Guess you didn't see that coming.

2131
01:49:20,363 --> 01:49:21,933
Twenty degrees right.

2132
01:49:22,803 --> 01:49:23,884
Fill that gap!

2133
01:49:24,043 --> 01:49:27,252
Fall upon your swords!
Life has no meaning!

2134
01:49:30,723 --> 01:49:34,409
There will be a mint julep
waiting on the other side, son.

2135
01:49:35,963 --> 01:49:37,931
Release your soul to me.

2136
01:49:56,443 --> 01:49:57,774
Sorry!

2137
01:49:58,323 --> 01:50:00,052
- Sorry! Sorry!
- Sorry!

2138
01:50:00,523 --> 01:50:02,366
Sex Panther powers activate.

2139
01:50:25,603 --> 01:50:27,446
It's the ghost of Stonewall Jackson!

2140
01:50:27,643 --> 01:50:30,328
Everyone, it's the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson!

2141
01:50:30,843 --> 01:50:32,413
Why do we have to fight?

2142
01:50:33,163 --> 01:50:34,724
There's so much I could learn from you.

2143
01:50:43,163 --> 01:50:45,564
In the name of Margaret Thatcher...

2144
01:50:45,643 --> 01:50:47,566
- No!
- I sentence you to death!

2145
01:50:47,643 --> 01:50:49,293
Please, no!

2146
01:50:53,043 --> 01:50:54,807
What in the name of Dan Issel?

2147
01:50:57,163 --> 01:50:58,164
Gary!

2148
01:50:58,323 --> 01:50:59,654
Yes, Ron.

2149
01:51:01,003 --> 01:51:03,005
You and I never got along.

2150
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:04,807
But using the power of my mind,

2151
01:51:04,883 --> 01:51:07,534
I was able to see in the future
that you would do good.

2152
01:51:09,443 --> 01:51:10,888
- Now, go.
- I knew it!

2153
01:51:10,963 --> 01:51:12,453
Go to your son's recital.

2154
01:51:12,563 --> 01:51:14,167
I knew you had mind powers!

2155
01:51:14,283 --> 01:51:16,411
And make it the greatest day of your life!

2156
01:51:16,603 --> 01:51:18,765
Almighty, Almighty,
light the fuse on my call.

2157
01:51:18,843 --> 01:51:20,766
Thirty-niner-niner-14, cook these fools.

2158
01:51:20,843 --> 01:51:22,368
I repeat, cook these fools.

2159
01:51:33,603 --> 01:51:35,844
We've got to get out of here.
There's too much news!

2160
01:51:35,923 --> 01:51:37,573
Man, what a rush!

2161
01:51:37,643 --> 01:51:39,054
The monster's my friend!

2162
01:51:39,163 --> 01:51:41,245
Ron, we can still make your kid's recital!

2163
01:51:42,603 --> 01:51:44,367
Hey, Ronny.

2164
01:51:44,603 --> 01:51:47,732
Jack Lime, please,
I just want to get to my son's recital.

2165
01:51:47,803 --> 01:51:49,612
No! That is out of the question!

2166
01:51:49,723 --> 01:51:50,770
We're outnumbered, Ron.

2167
01:51:50,843 --> 01:51:52,493
Foam the runway, I'm coming in hot!

2168
01:52:04,723 --> 01:52:07,966
Old MacDonald had a farm

2169
01:52:08,163 --> 01:52:10,404
And then four guys on bikes showed up.

2170
01:52:10,803 --> 01:52:13,647
Wes Mantooth and the
Channel Nine news team!

2171
01:52:13,923 --> 01:52:15,334
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?

2172
01:52:15,403 --> 01:52:16,734
This is a national news fight.

2173
01:52:17,083 --> 01:52:18,733
You made one mistake today.

2174
01:52:19,523 --> 01:52:21,491
You messed with somebody
from San Diego.

2175
01:52:22,003 --> 01:52:25,086
It's actually pronounced San Diago.

2176
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:27,849
Hell, Ron and I
may not agree on everything,

2177
01:52:28,763 --> 01:52:30,003
but we share the bond of being

2178
01:52:30,083 --> 01:52:32,123
from the greatest city
in the history of this Earth.

2179
01:52:33,683 --> 01:52:34,969
Well, ain't that cute?

2180
01:52:35,683 --> 01:52:37,253
But you're outnumbered three-to-one.

2181
01:52:37,883 --> 01:52:39,123
Why don't you go back to your mama?

2182
01:52:39,243 --> 01:52:41,291
Don't you use my mom's name in vain.

2183
01:52:42,123 --> 01:52:44,524
Dorothy Mantooth was
a hard-working single woman

2184
01:52:44,603 --> 01:52:46,412
who raised seven children on her own,

2185
01:52:46,483 --> 01:52:48,884
and she remained sexually
active till the day she died.

2186
01:52:49,123 --> 01:52:51,444
She brought pole dancing
into the mainstream.

2187
01:52:52,163 --> 01:52:54,848
Now here's the thing.
While I've been talking,

2188
01:52:54,923 --> 01:52:58,450
my news team has emptied
their gas tanks at your feet.

2189
01:53:01,443 --> 01:53:04,128
I drop this smoke and
every one of you goes "poof."

2190
01:53:04,443 --> 01:53:06,525
Well, you forgot one thing, leatherman.

2191
01:53:06,603 --> 01:53:08,287
You drop that smoke, you die, too.

2192
01:53:12,123 --> 01:53:13,966
With the things I've done in my life,

2193
01:53:14,883 --> 01:53:16,885
I know I'm going to burn in hell.

2194
01:53:17,963 --> 01:53:20,648
So I sure as shit
ain't afraid to burn here on Earth.

2195
01:53:20,963 --> 01:53:22,613
Oh, my goodness!

2196
01:53:22,763 --> 01:53:24,891
That's the most
badass thing I have ever heard.

2197
01:53:25,643 --> 01:53:26,849
All right!

2198
01:53:28,163 --> 01:53:29,324
Looks like this fight's over.

2199
01:53:31,363 --> 01:53:32,603
Let's go, boys.

2200
01:53:33,763 --> 01:53:36,653
Yay! We won! Let's celebrate!

2201
01:53:36,763 --> 01:53:37,969
Sparklers!

2202
01:53:38,083 --> 01:53:40,814
- No, no, no, Brick!
- No!

2203
01:54:04,763 --> 01:54:07,084
- Bravo! Bravo.
- Yeah.

2204
01:54:09,363 --> 01:54:10,444
Dad!

2205
01:54:10,603 --> 01:54:12,924
Son, I fought a Minotaur to be here.

2206
01:54:13,563 --> 01:54:14,849
And I'd do it again.

2207
01:54:15,003 --> 01:54:18,610
Dad! Together we can defeat voodoo!

2208
01:54:19,003 --> 01:54:21,688
Ron had finally
learned how to love his son

2209
01:54:21,763 --> 01:54:24,448
and his wife more than his career.

2210
01:54:25,483 --> 01:54:28,168
And as it turned out,
his walking off the news

2211
01:54:28,603 --> 01:54:31,891
was the highest-rated
TV event of the year.

2212
01:54:32,603 --> 01:54:35,129
He and his news team,
along with Veronica,

2213
01:54:35,203 --> 01:54:37,809
could have any job they wanted.

2214
01:54:38,483 --> 01:54:42,283
But before that, they had one
little thing to take care of.

2215
01:54:44,723 --> 01:54:48,728
And now, before I join this
couple in holy matrimony,

2216
01:54:49,203 --> 01:54:53,652
Brick and Chani ask us to join them
as they exchange their vows.

2217
01:54:54,643 --> 01:54:55,724
My dearest Brick.

2218
01:54:56,123 --> 01:54:57,807
Everything I have is yours.

2219
01:54:58,803 --> 01:55:01,204
My four lawnmowers. My sister.

2220
01:55:02,283 --> 01:55:04,012
My 35 ferrets.

2221
01:55:04,083 --> 01:55:06,290
My massive student loan
and real estate debt.

2222
01:55:06,803 --> 01:55:08,009
It's all yours.

2223
01:55:09,923 --> 01:55:11,288
Chani.

2224
01:55:11,363 --> 01:55:14,606
I will never forget
the exact moment I saw you.

2225
01:55:14,683 --> 01:55:18,404
My pee-pee got all uncomfortable
in my pants, and I thought,

2226
01:55:18,483 --> 01:55:22,010
"Here comes the warm milkshake
out of the tip of my belly stick."

2227
01:55:25,523 --> 01:55:27,332
Wait! Look!

2228
01:55:27,723 --> 01:55:29,566
Walter, Walter, honey!

2229
01:55:29,763 --> 01:55:31,652
Look in the water!

2230
01:55:32,123 --> 01:55:34,285
It's Doby!

2231
01:55:34,403 --> 01:55:35,564
Oh, my God!

2232
01:55:35,683 --> 01:55:38,004
It's Doby! Doby!

2233
01:55:38,443 --> 01:55:40,923
Ron, what are you doing?
He's not your friend!

2234
01:55:41,243 --> 01:55:42,449
Doby!

2235
01:55:42,963 --> 01:55:45,204
Ron! That's a shark!

2236
01:55:45,603 --> 01:55:47,412
He will eat you!

2237
01:55:48,363 --> 01:55:50,684
Old friends

2238
01:55:52,763 --> 01:55:54,253
Old friends

2239
01:55:54,323 --> 01:55:55,688
Doby!

2240
01:55:56,643 --> 01:56:00,728
Sat on their park bench like bookends

2241
01:56:01,403 --> 01:56:02,529
Oh, my God!

2242
01:56:02,723 --> 01:56:04,373
The shark actually recognizes him!

2243
01:56:06,683 --> 01:56:08,287
Nope. He's viciously attacking him.

2244
01:56:09,283 --> 01:56:12,207
Doby! Doby, it's me! Ron!

2245
01:56:12,403 --> 01:56:14,690
If a man dies with love in his heart,

2246
01:56:15,003 --> 01:56:16,892
does he truly die?

2247
01:56:17,043 --> 01:56:18,408
Absolutely!

2248
01:56:18,483 --> 01:56:23,045
But on this day, Ron Burgundy's grapple
with this denizen from the deep

2249
01:56:23,163 --> 01:56:26,884
was halted by 28 pounds
of furry providence.

2250
01:56:31,723 --> 01:56:32,929
I bottle-fed you!

2251
01:56:36,003 --> 01:56:37,084
Baxter!

2252
01:56:44,243 --> 01:56:45,404
Baxter!

2253
01:56:46,203 --> 01:56:49,332
Baxter! Yes!

2254
01:56:52,403 --> 01:56:55,646
I know, I know, I love you, too.

2255
01:56:59,043 --> 01:57:00,408
Come on.

2256
02:02:28,763 --> 02:02:30,208
All right, let's do it.

2257
02:02:32,323 --> 02:02:33,609
You guys think...

2258
02:02:33,683 --> 02:02:35,094
I don't know how to use a computer.

2259
02:02:35,643 --> 02:02:38,453
Hey, fellas.
I just saw Jack Lime out there.

2260
02:02:38,523 --> 02:02:40,730
He's a goddamn iceman.

2261
02:02:41,243 --> 02:02:42,927
Scared the crap out of me.
