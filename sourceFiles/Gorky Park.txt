1
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,369
- Who found them?
- He did.

2
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,791
He was on patrol,
he left the path for a pee and...

3
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:24,586
- Uh-oh.
- Three lost souls.

4
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:28,924
Like an execution, Pasha.
How long have they been here?

5
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,717
Arkady.

6
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:40,144
Greetings, comrades.
I bring you hot-water bottles.

7
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:45,899
Good. We were wondering
why you came, Comrade Major Pribluda.

8
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:50,862
This is a matter for militia. There's no
reason to think state security's involved.

9
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:54,365
What interest is this to KGB?

10
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,785
KGB decides what interests KGB.

11
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,457
So, who are they?
What's it look like? Drunks, or what?

12
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:07,795
If you want the case, Major, welcome.
We militia can go back to our beds.

13
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,590
I wonder you ever left them.

14
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:25,520
Comrade Major,
you're disturbing the evidence.

15
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:35,071
Holy Mother.

16
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:38,991
Look at this.

17
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:47,374
Look.

18
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,170
No face. Sliced right off.

19
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:53,422
Good God.

20
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:08,394
This one too. Butchered.

21
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,814
Jesus.

22
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,743
Faceless.

23
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,121
All three of them.

24
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,124
Who are they?

25
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:34,128
- You've disturbed enough evidence.
- Oh, stop complaining.

26
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,214
I've done some of the dirty work for you.

27
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:41,677
Yes, I know. You always do, comrade.

28
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,183
One day, Renko, this could be you.

29
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,522
Let's leave these policemen to it.
The cold has made them inhospitable.

30
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,816
Comrade Major?

31
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:04,824
Are you sure you want
militia to investigate this?

32
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,953
- What do you mean?
- It does seem like a KGB case after all.

33
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:13,958
Bodies carved up in the middle of
Moscow. Who knows where it could lead?

34
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,178
A body this size stays like stone for days.

35
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,972
I'd say they'd been there
three weeks to a month.

36
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,559
I'm about to make an incision
into the chest wall.

37
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,981
- This is disturbing you?
- Well, I'm glad I had no breakfast.

38
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,525
Sorry. I'm used to dealing with the dead.

39
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:47,656
The only emotion I feel about one is
a faint hope it may be a party official.

40
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,369
Be careful, my friend.
You don't want this case.

41
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,581
Please. You don't want this case.

42
00:06:56,165 --> 00:07:00,086
How were they killed,
Comrade Chief Pathologist?

43
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:07,634
The two men were shot in the head
at contact range.

44
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:10,804
All three were shot in the chest.

45
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:13,932
They were all in their twenties.

46
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,809
Go on.

47
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:21,106
Arkady, whoever cut off their faces knew
what he was doing. He was an expert.

48
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:25,485
- And who are the experts, Levin?
- I'm not listening.

49
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,155
They were there as soon as we were,
Pribluda and his gang. Who told them?

50
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:33,909
You've got an informer
in your office, haven't you?

51
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,495
Anything else for me?

52
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,541
The smaller male dyed his hair.
Its natural colour is red.

53
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,669
Possible indication of antisocial activity.

54
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:46,547
Or maybe he was a black marketeer.

55
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:49,341
Or...

56
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:53,094
- Or a foreigner.
- Arkady, please.

57
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:55,847
I don't like to get
mixed up with KGB work.

58
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,393
Don't worry. If one of these really is a
foreigner, it's out of our hands anyway.

59
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:05,314
I've just got to find enough
to make KGB take over the case.

60
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:10,903
And the quicker I can do that,
the safer we'll all feel.

61
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,618
Chest incision!

62
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:41,307
I can't understand it, lamskoy.
Dead bodies in Gorky Park.

63
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:45,811
- What the hell are they doing there?
- Yes, it passes belief, General.

64
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,689
Chief Investigator Renko
reporting, General.

65
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:51,901
- Have you shaved this morning?
- Comrade General, I...

66
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:57,114
- The general wants to know your initial...
- A fellow should keep hair off his face.

67
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:01,494
Your initial reaction to this. What are
the prospects for an early resolution?

68
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:05,498
With the world's finest militia
and the support of the Soviet peoples,

69
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:09,751
I am confident we will apprehend the
criminals involved, Comrade General.

70
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:14,297
Yes, yes, yes. I hope so, young man.
Your father, General Renko,

71
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:19,135
he was always clean and tidy,
even when he was killing Germans.

72
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:23,848
It's nearly four hours since the three
bodies were uncovered. Who are they?

73
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:27,560
The bodies have no marks
of identification, Comrade Prosecutor.

74
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,687
What? No papers? Here in Moscow?

75
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:35,818
The bodies were badly mutilated.
No papers. No fingertips.

76
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,778
No faces.

77
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:41,365
They were clean-shaven,
General. Quite literally.

78
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,660
Well...

79
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:50,124
Your father was just as insolent,
but then he could afford to be.

80
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:53,335
He was very good at his job, Renko.

81
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:14,605
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

82
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:17,525
For God's sake, Yuri,
can't you concentrate?

83
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,652
Your button, man. Your tunic button.

84
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:23,864
It's hanging off. Wardrobe!

85
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:27,701
Irina! Irina, please.

86
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,538
OK, let's set up again from the top.

87
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:37,210
Remember, you're tired, you're
frightened, Napoleon has you on the run.

88
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:40,088
Be careful, Misha.

89
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:45,050
- Show me that barn door again.
- Opening positions, everybody.

90
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:48,471
Quiet, please. Let's get ready to do this.

91
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:52,391
Ready to roll.

92
00:10:56,103 --> 00:11:00,316
What does a chief investigator
want with me?

93
00:11:00,441 --> 00:11:03,944
We found your skates.
Your name was scratched on them.

94
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,490
Oh, those. I lost them months ago.

95
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:12,911
You reported them missing on February 4
but said you lost them on January 31.

96
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:15,663
You didn't know
they were missing for four days?

97
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:20,460
That's how it is. You don't
miss something till you need it.

98
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:24,756
- They were found on a dead girl.
- There is justice after all.

99
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:33,055
Please, don't be shocked. You've no idea
how long it took to save for those skates.

100
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:35,849
Look at my boots. See?

101
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,852
Split.

102
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:43,107
She was murdered.
The girl wearing your skates.

103
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:48,112
The director of that film promised me
new boots if I went to bed with him.

104
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:51,031
Think I should?

105
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:53,784
Winter is almost over.

106
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:58,204
Exactly. And me a Siberian.
I am used to the cold.

107
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,670
Is your heart cold too?

108
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:06,838
What?

109
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:11,092
The girl wearing your skates,
about your age.

110
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:16,639
Two others were found with her,
also murdered. Their faces were cut off.

111
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:20,393
What has this to do with me?
What do you want?

112
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:23,395
Think back. Any idea
who took your skates?

113
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,899
I suspect everyone.

114
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:30,235
So do I.

115
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,370
Well?

116
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,750
Are you going to arrest me
for losing my skates?

117
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,794
- Perhaps not.
- Good.

118
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:51,756
Then please leave me alone.

119
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:06,771
It's cold. We've been skating,

120
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:11,024
but we've left the skating paths
for the clearing. Why?

121
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,693
- To talk.
- To eat. It's why anyone goes skating.

122
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:16,571
To stop, have a meat pie,
pass around the vodka.

123
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:22,660
So I've brought food. There's vodka in
our bellies. We're feeling good, relaxed.

124
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,789
Then...

125
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:29,000
- You shoot from your pocket.
- Shoot your own foot that way.

126
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:33,713
Forensic found traces of leather
in the bullet wounds.

127
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:39,051
A bag. You brought the food
in a leather bag with the gun.

128
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,431
We're friends.

129
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:47,184
Enjoying ourselves.

130
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,604
We leave the paths for a secluded place.

131
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,400
We are all alone.

132
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,779
I am handing out the food from the bag.

133
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:06,661
And I don't suspect a thing
as you lift the bag close to my chest.

134
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:10,957
What about the noise? Wouldn't the
other two call out? Wouldn't they run?

135
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,253
- Well, they don't know what's happening.
- But the noise!

136
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:17,213
Hey!

137
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:19,340
Hey!

138
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:30,016
The noise would make them run. It...

139
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:42,070
What? What did you say?

140
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,374
- You know what you just did?
- We're missing something.

141
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:59,462
- Yes, you went through a red light.
- Concentrate. No fingertips, no face.

142
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:04,592
Why? To make identification difficult. But
the killer shoots the two men in the head.

143
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,553
- Why?
- And he risks making even more noise.

144
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:13,641
Yes, but if he sliced off their faces, what's
the point of shooting them in the mouth?

145
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:16,394
- What do you have in your mouth?
- My tongue.

146
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:19,397
Your teeth.

147
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,691
Your teeth!

148
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,243
Gutta-percha.

149
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:35,788
- He had root-canal work, the redhead.
- Meaning?

150
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:40,959
Dentists in Europe don't use gutta-percha,
only the Americans.

151
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,800
Finally, and overwhelmingly,

152
00:15:47,883 --> 00:15:52,763
the dental technique suggests
that the victim is an American.

153
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:56,475
Arkady.

154
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:58,727
Would you...?

155
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,399
Excited, are we?

156
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:07,485
I think we've got enough
to dump this case.

157
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,446
I've just seen the report from Ballistics.

158
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,909
- What weapon?
- It's a 7.65mm pistol.

159
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:17,870
And that's a KGB gun.

160
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:21,124
Is it that shithead Pribluda?

161
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:25,377
That's like asking if a girl's a virgin when
I see her in bed with a man on top of her.

162
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,796
Well, what man?

163
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,966
Oh!

164
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:40,475
- Am I missing a joke?
- It's about your friend, Major Pribluda.

165
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:43,979
What do you mean, "my friend"?

166
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:46,982
What is it?

167
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:49,608
I've been asked to lamskoy's dacha.

168
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:52,945
He's throwing a weekend party
and he wants to talk to me.

169
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:57,825
- That's a great honour, Comrade Renko.
- Well, well, well.

170
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:00,661
You'll have to tidy yourself up.

171
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,873
What?

172
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,668
Oh, yes.

173
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,161
Well, well. A weekend at the lamskoys'.

174
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:48,999
Now, is it because your father
was a hero of the Soviet army? No.

175
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:52,711
God knows, it can hardly be
because of your charm or elegance.

176
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:57,174
Not all weekend, Anton. Just today,
long enough to get our host into a corner.

177
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:59,551
So... what are you up to?

178
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:02,261
- I'm saving a life.
- Whose?

179
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:06,391
Mine. I'm on a case that reeks of KGB
involvement and I've got to be extra...

180
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:09,352
Wouldn't you two
rather have good Soviet vodka?

181
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:12,355
No, Natasha, wicked French wine will do.

182
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,777
Who is that?

183
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:24,033
That is Jack Osborne.
An American.

184
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:26,701
He comes here
to buy our sable pelts.

185
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:29,871
Well, it is the only place
you can get them.

186
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:36,837
They say the Kremlin uses him to take
messages to and from Washington.

187
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,131
He's a very big wheel.

188
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:42,509
He even had dinner
with Brezhnev before he died.

189
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:48,265
Well, perhaps the conversation
would have been better after he'd died.

190
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:51,100
Anton.

191
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:08,325
The Ancient Greeks
understood the mechanics of power.

192
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:13,873
"Justice" they said. "Justice is
in the interests of the strong. "

193
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:18,918
I've heard the same sentiment expressed
in not-too-dissimilar terms in America.

194
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:23,048
"Those were the gold-maker rules"
someone said.

195
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:28,261
You mean in America only
those with money can be innocent?

196
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:33,725
No. I mean in America, attorneys
do very well for themselves.

197
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:39,397
Well, do you know what you're doing here
when you engage a defence lawyer?

198
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,940
Wasting money.

199
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:00,667
I read your report, Arkady.

200
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:05,838
And I can see that you are anxious
for the KGB to take over the case.

201
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:10,134
But this is not like you, huh?
Why? What's wrong?

202
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:13,971
- May I speak freely?
- To me? Always.

203
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:19,310
It is more than possible
that KGB killed those three people.

204
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,194
I agree.

205
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:31,947
Then it is likely they are
laying a trap for me.

206
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,198
Why?

207
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:36,993
Once I tried to arrest Major Pribluda.
I proved he was an assassin.

208
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:41,623
- Remember the two bodies by the river?
- God, it's cold out here.

209
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:47,170
- You want to freeze my blood even more?
- I proved KGB did it.

210
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:52,758
I moved for the indictment,
and I was arrested and beaten senseless.

211
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:54,719
And who got you out?

212
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:59,181
I was grateful to you. I am grateful to you.
But it's a poisonous farce.

213
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:01,976
Arkady, things are changing.

214
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,062
Believe me, I have more power
than used to be the case.

215
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:07,982
They are more vulnerable.

216
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:11,652
You're easily
the best policeman in Moscow.

217
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:16,657
And I need your help. I need it badly.

218
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:20,076
And you can protect me and my men?

219
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:25,540
Listen, our Soviet constitution
is a noble piece of work.

220
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:30,545
But only if honourable men
and women respect it.

221
00:21:30,628 --> 00:21:33,715
Now, I'm determined to stand on legality.

222
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:39,971
KGB must not, cannot work outside the
law, or they're little better than the CIA.

223
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:44,558
- But how?
- Support me. Don't try to unload the case.

224
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:48,520
We mustn't give them a centimetre.
And I promise you, Arkady...

225
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:52,399
I promise you, I'll be behind you
every step of the way.

226
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,321
Yes, my dear?

227
00:21:57,404 --> 00:22:00,824
You are the only one here
who is going back to Moscow tonight.

228
00:22:00,949 --> 00:22:03,869
- It seems so.
- Will you take me with you?

229
00:22:03,952 --> 00:22:07,622
- At this hour? Is there something wrong?
- Please?

230
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:11,876
You'd better first persuade Mr Osborne
to give you a fur coat, my dear.

231
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:15,046
The investigator's car has no heater.

232
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:35,148
Not the sort of place a girl without a
decent pair of boots normally goes, is it?

233
00:22:35,232 --> 00:22:38,735
Won't your rich American friend
be disappointed?

234
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:42,155
I asked you for a lift, not a conversation.

235
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:45,575
What, still upset
about a pair of lost skates?

236
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:49,621
- If they were lost.
- I reported them missing.

237
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:51,331
- Yes, but why?
- What?

238
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:57,420
You're not the sort who goes to the police
for a thing like that without a reason.

239
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:03,634
Were you afraid they might
turn up on the wrong person?

240
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,803
- Let me out.
- What?

241
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:12,685
- Stop and let me out. I'd rather walk.
- Don't be silly. You'd freeze to death.

242
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:18,940
What are you doing? You're insane!
What are you trying to do? Kill yourself?

243
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,484
Questions, questions.

244
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:27,532
Oh, no. Fine, fine.
Now we can both freeze.

245
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,828
Come on.

246
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,804
KGB have better cars, you know.

247
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:54,933
But they don't always take you
where you want to go, do they?

248
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:15,344
I don't know whether to get deep
in this case or not. Really take it on.

249
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:18,889
- Don't piss into the wind.
- Maybe. Maybe not. Forensic?

250
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:23,685
Forensic picked up traces of gesso,
sawdust and gold on the clothing.

251
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:26,312
- Gold?
- All used in the restoring of icons.

252
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:31,568
Black marketeers. That's why the KGB
disposed of them. Sodding Pribluda.

253
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:34,696
Anything else?
Did Forensic turn up anything else?

254
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:37,907
Yeah, some spots
of chicken and fish blood.

255
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:40,827
That's odd, isn't it?

256
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,455
That doesn't fit.

257
00:25:44,497 --> 00:25:47,583
God, I wish we knew
what they looked like.

258
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:51,253
Hm.

259
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:54,798
No dessert?

260
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:07,311
- And the redhead. I want his head too.
- Why not the other one?

261
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:11,731
We know nothing about him. Besides,
how many do you think I can carry?

262
00:26:11,814 --> 00:26:15,651
So long as you know what to say
if they stop you in the street.

263
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,990
The greatest of killers.

264
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:22,992
I'm sorry?

265
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:25,328
Tamerlane the Great.

266
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:29,457
Nasty man. His skull
showed right-side paralysis,

267
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:32,126
and I had some hair to deal with.

268
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,961
Yes, I see.

269
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:38,256
Do you? Do you?

270
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:39,633
Well...

271
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:42,219
What about the mildew?

272
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:48,392
On the upper lip?

273
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:52,646
- Yes. I'm sorry, what do you mean?
- Where the moustache grew. Mildew.

274
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:54,815
Of course.

275
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:59,902
- I am Professor Andreev.
- Chief Investigator Renko. I tried to ring...

276
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:05,741
I do not do forensic work,
either for militia or KGB.

277
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,579
Renko?

278
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:12,915
- How interesting.
- Why?

279
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:17,378
Your father was General Renko.
You don't look a bit like him.

280
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:23,091
My God. Your zygomaticus has a
completely different elasticity altogether.

281
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:29,055
Promise me I can have your face
when the breath has left your body.

282
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:35,228
Professor Andreev,
these heads have no faces.

283
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:48,198
- Don't try to interest me.
- A murderer erased their identities.

284
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:51,285
You can give it back to them.

285
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:14,474
Professor, too many people
in our society disappear without trace.

286
00:28:14,932 --> 00:28:16,309
Oh?

287
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:18,394
Why is that?

288
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:20,772
They fall into a chasm.

289
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:24,108
What sort of chasm?

290
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:27,236
The one between what is said
and what is done.

291
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:37,746
You may not be long for this world,
my fine, imprudent fellow.

292
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:51,635
Hm.

293
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,764
Right. First thing:
Clean off the rest of the flesh. Hm?

294
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,850
Fetch me the grubworms.

295
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:38,638
# Whoa, where you're concerned,
my heart I sold

296
00:29:38,722 --> 00:29:41,975
# It's so easy to fall in love

297
00:29:42,225 --> 00:29:45,145
# It's so easy to fall in love

298
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,612
- # It seems so easy
- # It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy

299
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:59,450
- # So doggone easy
- # Doggone easy, doggone easy

300
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:02,870
- # It seems so easy
- # It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy

301
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:07,166
# Where you're concerned my heart I sold

302
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:10,419
# It's so easy to fall in love

303
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:14,047
# It's so easy to fall in love

304
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:20,470
Let's go. All right?

305
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:38,278
- # Well shake it up, baby, now
- # Shake it up, baby

306
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:41,281
- # Twist and shout
- # Twist and shout

307
00:30:41,365 --> 00:30:43,825
# Come on, come on,
come on, come on, baby, now

308
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,995
- # Come on, baby
- # Come on and work it on out...

309
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,538
Hey.

310
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:51,124
Who are you?

311
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,420
What are you doing there?

312
00:30:56,672 --> 00:31:00,884
I said, what are you doing there?
This is a...

313
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:03,427
Stop! Militia!

314
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:57,396
Son of a bitch!

315
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:03,402
Stay away.

316
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:09,700
An American.

317
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:06,087
Arkady?

318
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:09,215
Ah.

319
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:13,260
Who did it? What happened?

320
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:15,596
Was it Pribluda? Arkady?

321
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,973
No, no.

322
00:33:18,057 --> 00:33:20,434
I think it was an American.

323
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:22,561
Christ.

324
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:25,231
CIA, you think?

325
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,733
Somebody with fists made of stone.

326
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:33,738
- More painkiller?
- Mmmm.

327
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:42,539
What are we doing in the kitchen?
You should lie down.

328
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:46,167
This is where you keep
your French brandy.

329
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:56,844
The way to do this is to imagine

330
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:59,888
they are your loved one...

331
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:04,018
these little creatures.

332
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:08,230
Oh, yes, we need them.

333
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:12,067
Don't the ones you love eat up your flesh?

334
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:16,343
"A member of the Komsomol brigade,
Valerya Davidova,

335
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,138
demonstrates a pelt
of a Barguzinsky sable

336
00:38:19,221 --> 00:38:25,226
to visiting American... businessman...
Jack Osborne. "

337
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:37,238
And who's this?

338
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:39,282
A redhead?

339
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:54,145
It's rainin' outside,
in case you hadn't noticed.

340
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:56,523
Close the door.

341
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,321
No.

342
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:06,740
Throw it to my feet.

343
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,706
Empty your pockets on the bed.

344
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:20,754
Now take your coat off.

345
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,589
Throw it to the floor.

346
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,016
Trouser pockets.

347
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,353
- You're all alone, aren't you, Boris?
- Be still.

348
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:39,314
- What?
- Don't move.

349
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:43,443
Easy, Boris. Easy, easy.
It's my room. Why should I move?

350
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,570
Sit.

351
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,157
Easy.

352
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,458
Now tie your laces together.

353
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,771
What you gonna do now?
Pile the furniture on me?

354
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,481
If need be.

355
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,317
I should have killed you in the park.

356
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,277
Why?

357
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,282
- Cos that's where you killed my brother.
- Your brother?

358
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,576
So that's why...

359
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:39,079
I didn't kill him.

360
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:44,542
You or your friends. Makes no difference.
But you're the one that will pay for it.

361
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:50,924
A policeman from New York?

362
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,177
That's a gold shield, Boris. I'm a detective.

363
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,721
A detective? Lose your way, did you?

364
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,392
- I found you, didn't I?
- I didn't kill your brother.

365
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:04,687
But how are you gonna find the one
who did it? Or doesn't that matter?

366
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:10,985
I think you'll need a bit of help.

367
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:28,876
Tell me about the girl
in the newspaper cutting.

368
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:32,672
She was a friend of your brother's.
Perhaps she was killed with him.

369
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:35,508
Ask your comrades in the secret police.

370
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:38,928
No. Perhaps KGB did kill them.

371
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:42,015
But I want to find the killer.

372
00:42:42,098 --> 00:42:46,644
But I need help. Why don't we
help each other, Mr Kirwill?

373
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:53,400
Sure. You on the outside and me on the
inside, looking at you through the bars.

374
00:42:55,527 --> 00:42:57,571
A deal.

375
00:42:58,947 --> 00:43:01,658
I won't arrest you.

376
00:43:01,742 --> 00:43:04,661
You help me. How about it?

377
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:09,166
Go fuck yourself.

378
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:31,103
Wait a minute. How about my shield?
I'm gonna need that.

379
00:43:33,189 --> 00:43:35,650
Not here, you won't.

380
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:42,364
VALERYA DAVIDOVA
JAMES KIRWILL

381
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,590
A very good morning to you.

382
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:47,176
No, I've been up all night.

383
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,096
Come, come. No man
can work so many hours.

384
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:53,307
Don't worry, I'm going home to bed.
This is my breakfast.

385
00:44:53,432 --> 00:44:58,895
The poet lays down his pen, the killer
his axe, and even you must learn to relax.

386
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,901
Well, bed. I can relax in bed.

387
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:09,531
I have just the thing to open up
your pores and unclog your weary mind.

388
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:15,078
This is my daily regime. A brisk walk,
a leisurely dip. It's wonderful.

389
00:45:49,444 --> 00:45:55,116
Even we humble servants of the state
need to be refreshed from time to time.

390
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,744
Ah!

391
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,497
Well, well. This is a surprise.

392
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,084
You recall Chief Investigator Renko
from last weekend?

393
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:10,255
Yes. I'm not sure whether he arrested or
abducted the lady who accompanied me.

394
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:11,799
Rescued.

395
00:46:11,882 --> 00:46:14,593
Say, from the machinations of a capitalist.

396
00:46:14,677 --> 00:46:18,180
Do sit down, Jack. Have a drink.
Have something to eat.

397
00:46:18,263 --> 00:46:24,436
Talk to the only one of our homicide team
with a 100% record of success.

398
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:30,984
I'm afraid I have an appointment
with a general so old that he dribbles.

399
00:46:44,998 --> 00:46:49,711
I always wanted to meet an American.

400
00:46:50,211 --> 00:46:52,922
You are so... so different.

401
00:46:53,006 --> 00:46:55,382
Forgive me for staring.

402
00:46:55,507 --> 00:47:00,887
Only once before did I ever meet
an American in the flesh, so to speak.

403
00:47:00,971 --> 00:47:04,057
A young student.
Kirwill, I think he was called.

404
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:06,268
James Kirwill.

405
00:47:06,351 --> 00:47:08,645
Oh?

406
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,897
But he was dead.

407
00:47:11,023 --> 00:47:13,400
That doesn't count, then, does it?

408
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,989
You must have noticed many differences
between a man like yourself, Mr Osborne,

409
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:22,533
and a man like me.

410
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:24,994
Man overboard.

411
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:28,581
What?

412
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:31,584
There's a sliver of food on your upper lip.

413
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,966
I'm just a plodding investigator. No style.

414
00:47:40,009 --> 00:47:42,052
Completely out of my depth.

415
00:47:42,177 --> 00:47:48,892
Three bodies, three people,
shot down and mutilated in Gorky Park.

416
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:52,395
And me, I have food on my lip.

417
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:55,982
Not even caviar at that.

418
00:47:57,275 --> 00:48:01,446
I somehow feel that the executioner,
whoever he may be,

419
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,992
would have preferred somebody...

420
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:11,038
a more, um... nimble opponent.

421
00:48:49,742 --> 00:48:53,663
- Ah. Finished eating, are we?
- Yes, thank you.

422
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,001
I understand you import our
wonderful Soviet sable into America.

423
00:48:59,126 --> 00:49:01,962
You Soviets have
the world monopoly on sable.

424
00:49:02,045 --> 00:49:04,589
I always wanted a sable hat.

425
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:12,431
A man of your status should possess one.
Must we see what we can do?

426
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:15,934
We Russians know how
to wait for things. I'm very patient.

427
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:20,313
I watch and I think and I wait.
It is my only virtue.

428
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:26,610
But why wait? I'm always happy to
accommodate particular Soviet friends.

429
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:29,530
Patience has its own rewards.

430
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:33,701
Do you want the hat or not?

431
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:39,624
Perhaps the chief investigator
has some other reward in mind?

432
00:49:40,374 --> 00:49:42,752
Yes.

433
00:49:46,212 --> 00:49:48,256
Perhaps.

434
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:52,510
- You don't know?
- Not yet.

435
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:57,307
First I have the hunch,
then I begin to assemble reasons.

436
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,684
Then I...

437
00:49:59,768 --> 00:50:02,062
- And then you...?
- I pounce.

438
00:50:02,187 --> 00:50:06,816
That's no way to catch a sable.
They're far too cunning and far too fast.

439
00:50:07,275 --> 00:50:11,904
While you wait and you think,
and you watch...

440
00:50:13,072 --> 00:50:15,366
your prey is gone.

441
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:18,160
Oh, I don't think so.

442
00:50:18,243 --> 00:50:20,537
Good. Good.

443
00:50:21,664 --> 00:50:25,167
Meanwhile I have the hat and you don't.

444
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,404
IRINA

445
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:56,989
OSBORNE

446
00:51:38,654 --> 00:51:41,741
Bang!

447
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:48,538
- Detective Pavlovich, you're drunk!
- Not as drunk as Fet.

448
00:51:48,622 --> 00:51:51,458
Detective Fet!

449
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:57,088
- I told you to follow him, not...
- Ah, ah, ah. Look what I've got.

450
00:51:57,172 --> 00:52:00,342
One of the KGB files.

451
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:04,387
- How in God's name...?
- I stole it. From Fet.

452
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:06,973
Fet! Little bastard.

453
00:52:07,932 --> 00:52:09,975
Pasha!

454
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:15,230
Well, open it. No vomit on it, is there?

455
00:52:15,314 --> 00:52:18,400
You mean you got Fet so drunk that...?

456
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,906
- They'll shoot me, won't they?
- Probably.

457
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:28,869
I'll get shot.

458
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:34,208
Fuck it.

459
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:38,628
Pasha, this is Irina Asanova's file!

460
00:52:38,753 --> 00:52:41,214
Put the light out.

461
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:46,344
"Expelled from Moscow University
for antisocial behaviour

462
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:49,222
and unwise associations,

463
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:52,433
particularly with Siberian renegade...

464
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:56,354
Valerya Davidova. "

465
00:53:01,692 --> 00:53:05,904
"KGB informant: Feodor Golodkin. "

466
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:09,241
"Used-car salesman. "

467
00:53:40,896 --> 00:53:43,441
Where is Valerya?

468
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:48,903
- What are you talking about?
- Where do you think she is?

469
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:51,072
Who?

470
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:54,492
I've seen your file.

471
00:53:54,618 --> 00:53:59,497
You were friends with Valerya Davidova
and an American student, James Kirwill.

472
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:05,003
The same file will tell you I was expelled
from university for writing on a wall.

473
00:54:06,296 --> 00:54:10,050
- Your friends are dead. Murdered.
- You're sick.

474
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:13,385
I'll show you their bodies,
their clothes. Come and see.

475
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:16,555
You're one of a leper organisation.
I won't be infected.

476
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,392
- They were found in Gorky Park.
- Why do you lie? Do...

477
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:24,104
- Where are they, these friends of yours?
- Out!

478
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,361
Out?

479
00:54:30,444 --> 00:54:33,280
Who do you think got them out?

480
00:54:33,364 --> 00:54:37,116
You're trying to trap me.
I'm not going to betray my friends.

481
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,413
Whoever was to get them out led them to
their deaths. You must be in danger too.

482
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:45,124
They're free.

483
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:47,251
Free.

484
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,974
Like a thigh, eh?
Just like strokin' her leg.

485
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:47,393
Nice. Very nice.

486
00:55:50,854 --> 00:55:55,900
You're in love already.
Go on, take your time. Walk around it.

487
00:56:00,196 --> 00:56:03,867
If I wanted to walk,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

488
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:18,547
- Anna said I was to talk to Golodkin.
- Who?

489
00:56:18,672 --> 00:56:23,385
Look, I've got these marks,
West German money. I was trying to...

490
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:26,013
- That's all right. I can deal in that.
- No, no.

491
00:56:26,138 --> 00:56:30,267
Gotta be Golodkin.
"Make sure it's Golodkin" she said.

492
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:41,819
It's all right, friend. Meet Feodor,
Feodor Golodkin. I'm your man.

493
00:56:41,903 --> 00:56:44,989
You never said a truer word.

494
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:50,119
Where the fuck
are you going?!

495
00:56:50,203 --> 00:56:54,123
- This is militia headquarters, dickhead!
- Just shut it.

496
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:57,210
I work for the KGB.
I'm not talking to you.

497
00:56:57,335 --> 00:56:59,379
All right?

498
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:03,131
Now, listen...

499
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,596
Pasha... open the window.

500
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:13,350
My pleasure.

501
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:16,186
This is all some kind
of a misunderstanding.

502
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:21,942
How did a greasy, parasitic pimp like you
come to meet a girl like Irina Asanova?

503
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:24,319
Who?

504
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:27,571
Pasha, handcuff this piece of shit.

505
00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:30,241
- Hey, now look. Hey, come on.
- My pleasure.

506
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:34,912
Hey, now listen. Get off me.
Come on! I'm protected by KGB.

507
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:38,082
- Ow! That hurts!
- Pasha, lift him up.

508
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:40,501
- Get off me!
- Why are you trying to escape?

509
00:57:40,584 --> 00:57:42,878
I'm not! I'm not!

510
00:57:44,463 --> 00:57:45,923
What did he do, Pasha?

511
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:50,303
Ran wildly to the open window,
Comrade Chief Investigator.

512
00:57:50,386 --> 00:57:55,098
- That's right.
- No, I didn't! I didn't! I didn't! I didn't!

513
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:59,644
No! No-o-o-o!

514
00:57:59,728 --> 00:58:03,773
We were counting.
When we reached three, away he went.

515
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:07,068
- You're crazy. You wouldn't.
- One.

516
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:09,070
- Two.
- No!

517
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,490
- Three!
- No! Listen!

518
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:22,166
That's him. He and Valerya and Irina and
this big fellow, Kostia, they were cronies.

519
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,585
Kostia, did you say?

520
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:29,673
- Who was he? What was he?
- He was a big ape from Siberia. Mukta.

521
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,800
He was screwing Valerya.

522
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:34,929
And they all knew Jack Osborne?

523
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,723
Mr Jack Osborne? Yeah.

524
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,976
- He wanted to bed down the girl. Valerya.
- And did he?

525
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,647
I should think so. Girls like
screwing foreigners, don't they?

526
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:49,817
It's almost as good as travel.
Clean sheets, little presents.

527
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:56,282
And Kostia didn't seem to mind.
He was after something else.

528
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,244
You see, Kostia knew that
Mr Jack Osborne wanted something.

529
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,706
- That's...
- What did Osborne want?

530
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,750
A chest. A big church chest.

531
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:09,753
That's not a nun with tits.

532
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:15,884
You know, with religious panels. Big...

533
00:59:16,009 --> 00:59:19,096
- What for?
- I don't know.

534
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:23,183
But he promised me 2,000 American
dollars if I could get him one.

535
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:25,727
- And did you?
- Yes, I did.

536
00:59:25,811 --> 00:59:28,522
But Mr Jack Osborne
looked straight through me.

537
00:59:28,605 --> 00:59:31,274
He got one from those three.
Cheaper, I'll bet.

538
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:35,319
- Kirwill, Valerya and Kostia?
- Yeah. And I can't sell the one I got.

539
00:59:35,444 --> 00:59:41,200
It's too big for anybody to smuggle out.
You can't chop up a chest and hide it in...

540
00:59:41,325 --> 00:59:43,953
Where is this chest?

541
00:59:44,036 --> 00:59:46,706
Where is it?

542
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:48,833
My place.

543
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,711
- Pasha, go with him. I want that chest.
- What, now?

544
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:53,878
Yes, now.

545
01:00:10,937 --> 01:00:13,231
Goodbye, pretty lady.

546
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,039
Well, I work hard. I work very hard.

547
01:00:31,582 --> 01:00:34,168
Holy Peter!

548
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:37,379
Something you want?
Anything you'd like?

549
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:41,050
Where's this chest?

550
01:00:41,926 --> 01:00:47,263
How about, um,
100 good French condoms?

551
01:00:47,388 --> 01:00:49,766
- All colours.
- 100?

552
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:53,353
Mm. It's just about enough
for a weekend, eh?

553
01:00:53,436 --> 01:00:56,773
- The chest.
- It's in the bathroom.

554
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:06,324
There's no room for it in there.

555
01:01:06,406 --> 01:01:10,452
I don't want the damn thing
clutterin' up my nice room, anyway.

556
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:04,921
Comrade Prosecutor, Golodkin
was of some assistance to KGB.

557
01:02:05,005 --> 01:02:07,841
- You know how it is.
- An informer, you mean.

558
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:12,887
- Well, it is our case.
- What do you mean "your case"?

559
01:02:13,805 --> 01:02:17,684
- You festering baboon.
- And we have already determined

560
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:21,854
that Golodkin shot your man and
then turned his own gun upon himself.

561
01:02:21,979 --> 01:02:25,733
- Very swift deduction. Congratulations.
- Your man was unarmed.

562
01:02:25,816 --> 01:02:30,195
It was that file, wasn't it?
It was a trap. A trap!

563
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,866
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Listen!

564
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:38,329
- You killed him! It was you!
- Arkady! Arkady!

565
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,497
Pull yourself together.

566
01:02:52,926 --> 01:02:56,429
There is an American
who is a link to everything.

567
01:02:56,554 --> 01:02:59,307
Oh? Who?

568
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:02,560
An American who knew
all three of them.

569
01:03:02,685 --> 01:03:05,772
An American who had
dealings with Golodkin.

570
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,942
An American who has
very powerful friends.

571
01:03:10,025 --> 01:03:12,694
- KGB friends.
- Who?

572
01:03:12,778 --> 01:03:15,697
An acquaintance of yours, I'm...

573
01:03:16,657 --> 01:03:18,367
Osborne.

574
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,119
Osborne? Jack Osborne?

575
01:03:22,746 --> 01:03:27,125
Why would an American businessman kill
three nobodies in the middle of Moscow?

576
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:29,253
I don't know.

577
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,214
- Unless...
- Unless what?

578
01:03:32,297 --> 01:03:35,549
Unless they were all involved
in something so big

579
01:03:35,633 --> 01:03:40,012
that Osborne had to make sure
his partners would never, ever talk.

580
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:43,307
- Jack Osborne.
- Yes.

581
01:03:46,018 --> 01:03:49,105
Are you sure? Quite sure?

582
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:51,774
In my bones.

583
01:03:52,275 --> 01:03:54,652
Well, then...

584
01:03:54,735 --> 01:03:56,779
go after him.

585
01:03:57,737 --> 01:04:00,657
He's at the Metropole Hotel.

586
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:04,452
Rattle him.

587
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:07,289
Trip him up.

588
01:04:58,254 --> 01:05:01,424
Where is Valerya? You have to tell me.

589
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:03,927
Safe.

590
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:06,804
Please. I must know.

591
01:05:06,888 --> 01:05:09,098
At this precise moment?

592
01:05:09,182 --> 01:05:13,310
Certainly finishing her lunchtime
apéritif in Manhattan.

593
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:18,482
Come to my room.

594
01:05:19,399 --> 01:05:20,943
Please.

595
01:08:10,897 --> 01:08:13,650
Let me go!

596
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:36,505
Go away. I'm KGB.

597
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:18,170
Why'd you come in
through the window, Boris?

598
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:19,963
What?

599
01:09:20,088 --> 01:09:22,841
The door was open.

600
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:33,101
- Who is she?
- Irina Asanova.

601
01:09:33,227 --> 01:09:36,230
She knew your brother and the other two.

602
01:09:36,313 --> 01:09:41,525
We've got to get her temperature down
quicker. Get some ice from my fridge.

603
01:09:41,651 --> 01:09:44,570
- Was she in on the killings?
- She thinks they got out.

604
01:09:44,654 --> 01:09:48,324
She can't believe they're dead.
But she's the key.

605
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:55,665
Jesus Christ! What the hell kind
of a diet are you on, anyway, pal?

606
01:09:55,748 --> 01:09:57,792
Bring the ice.

607
01:10:04,422 --> 01:10:07,259
What the hell is that?

608
01:10:07,342 --> 01:10:11,471
I had it reconstructed from
one of the Gorky Park heads.

609
01:10:11,554 --> 01:10:13,181
Why?

610
01:10:14,099 --> 01:10:17,018
The killer had sliced off their faces.

611
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:20,230
Shit.

612
01:10:20,313 --> 01:10:24,693
She'll be in a bad way when she comes
round, and if she sees that head...

613
01:10:24,818 --> 01:10:27,278
I'll take it.

614
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:35,995
She's going to be all right.
He didn't get enough into her veins.

615
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,123
Renko, give me somethin'.

616
01:10:39,206 --> 01:10:42,126
Give me somethin' to work on.

617
01:10:44,086 --> 01:10:46,130
Come on.

618
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,676
I believe the three were making a chest.

619
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:55,597
A religious chest for
the black market in icons.

620
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,766
- Yeah. And?
- Their clothing.

621
01:10:59,225 --> 01:11:02,145
Beside the traces of gold and gesso...

622
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:09,402
there were spots of chicken
and fish blood. I don't know why.

623
01:11:10,361 --> 01:11:15,074
I've been in Soviet markets. I've never
seen anything fresh enough to bleed.

624
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:18,994
- I'll be seeing you.
- I'm very grateful to you.

625
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:25,751
Well, when you took that shot
at me you aimed away.

626
01:11:26,835 --> 01:11:28,962
Not by much.

627
01:11:29,087 --> 01:11:32,007
By enough. Maybe you're for real.

628
01:11:34,968 --> 01:11:38,222
Maybe you just don't shoot very well.

629
01:11:39,014 --> 01:11:42,183
You'll never know, will you?

630
01:12:29,853 --> 01:12:32,856
Why did you save my life?

631
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:35,901
You're important to my investigation.

632
01:12:36,694 --> 01:12:40,531
- Now what?
- Well, when your clothes are dry, you go.

633
01:12:41,574 --> 01:12:43,117
Where?

634
01:12:43,242 --> 01:12:45,953
It's up to you.

635
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,289
Home.

636
01:12:48,372 --> 01:12:51,292
They'll be waiting for me.

637
01:12:53,835 --> 01:12:57,005
Friends, then. You must have
someone you can stay with.

638
01:12:57,088 --> 01:13:00,008
And get them into trouble as well?

639
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:05,972
- Citizen Asanova...
- Irina.

640
01:13:08,182 --> 01:13:10,852
You've undressed me.

641
01:13:11,895 --> 01:13:14,105
Irina.

642
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:17,734
- This is the worst place for you to be.
- It's very simple.

643
01:13:17,816 --> 01:13:22,112
Either you are with them, and it doesn't
matter where I run, or you are not and...

644
01:13:22,195 --> 01:13:26,116
- You'll be trapped here. They saw me.
- We'd be trapped here.

645
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:28,702
I can't take care of you.

646
01:13:28,785 --> 01:13:31,788
You've got two plates, two cups.

647
01:13:32,539 --> 01:13:35,000
Why did you go to the hotel?

648
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:40,005
- What is Osborne to you?
- A friend.

649
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:43,549
A friend? What sort of friend?

650
01:13:43,633 --> 01:13:46,552
Is he the one you think
got them out? Is that it?

651
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,471
No questions.

652
01:13:51,349 --> 01:13:53,392
Irina.

653
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:56,520
My friend is dead. Your friends are dead.

654
01:13:56,646 --> 01:14:00,399
- Why delude yourself? Why?
- Then why did KGB try to take me?

655
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:03,861
Perhaps to protect the killer.
To protect Osborne.

656
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:06,447
All I know is your friends were killed.

657
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:08,865
- No!
- Irina, please.

658
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:12,744
If I had a gun and I could
get out, I'd shoot you now.

659
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:18,416
Here, take it.

660
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,543
Take it.

661
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:25,131
What are you waiting for?

662
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:36,642
That's not going to get me out, is it?

663
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:00,806
How are they killed?

664
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,434
- Uh, who?
- Sables.

665
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,772
- You don't think I kill them myself?
- Yes, I do.

666
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:10,690
Oh, no, no, no. I do not soil my hands.

667
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:15,070
I mean, do you kill the animal when you
eat his flesh or use his skin for boots?

668
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:17,739
No. Like most of us I turn
my eyes from such things.

669
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:21,117
- Exactly.
- I said like most of us.

670
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:25,705
Yes, I suppose there are those
who enjoy the act of butchery.

671
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:31,211
Especially if they feel
themselves superior beings.

672
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:34,547
- Yes?
- What are we talking about?

673
01:16:34,672 --> 01:16:37,591
- Dead bodies in Gorky Park.
- Ah.

674
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:41,887
- Doesn't it interest you?
- Me?

675
01:16:41,971 --> 01:16:44,974
I have established that
you knew all three of them.

676
01:16:45,099 --> 01:16:46,976
Have you, now?

677
01:16:47,101 --> 01:16:48,561
Well.

678
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:53,649
I met Stalin when I was young.
Did you know that?

679
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:56,652
No.

680
01:16:56,777 --> 01:16:59,320
Well, you do know that Stalin is dead.

681
01:17:00,446 --> 01:17:04,909
Now, does the mere fact that I met him
prove that I killed him?

682
01:17:06,327 --> 01:17:10,540
- The sadist cut off their faces.
- Do you mind?

683
01:17:10,665 --> 01:17:13,585
In the same way he might skin an animal.

684
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:17,213
A sable, perhaps.

685
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:19,966
I don't think we'll be seeing
each other again.

686
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:21,509
Oh?

687
01:17:23,302 --> 01:17:26,889
You once said that patience
was your only virtue.

688
01:17:28,348 --> 01:17:31,101
That you watch and you wait.

689
01:17:31,184 --> 01:17:36,148
I have only four days more in Moscow.
After that I'm leaving for good.

690
01:17:36,273 --> 01:17:39,526
However, I feel that you
deserve some reward.

691
01:17:41,612 --> 01:17:44,323
Expect a knock at your door.

692
01:17:45,282 --> 01:17:48,951
I'm having that sable hat delivered to you.

693
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:07,595
- It was good. Thank you.
- Anybody can cook stew.

694
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:11,848
You could burn it. I do.

695
01:18:14,142 --> 01:18:16,353
Irina?

696
01:18:16,478 --> 01:18:18,521
Help me, please.

697
01:18:26,571 --> 01:18:29,991
How do I know the attack on me
wasn't staged to make me trust you?

698
01:18:30,116 --> 01:18:31,743
Irina.

699
01:18:38,999 --> 01:18:42,753
How do I know that you didn't plan it
to make me betray my friends?

700
01:18:42,878 --> 01:18:45,089
Like Osborne, you mean.

701
01:18:45,839 --> 01:18:47,883
Your friend Osborne.

702
01:18:50,469 --> 01:18:54,682
Let's talk about Osborne.
Tell me about Osborne.

703
01:18:54,807 --> 01:18:57,726
Is that all you can do? Talk?

704
01:18:58,477 --> 01:19:00,186
Talk?

705
01:19:00,311 --> 01:19:02,855
Irina, listen.

706
01:19:05,525 --> 01:19:08,444
You don't have to talk so much.

707
01:19:09,404 --> 01:19:12,323
Irina, I am your friend.

708
01:19:18,288 --> 01:19:20,665
No. My enemy.

709
01:19:26,336 --> 01:19:31,842
Everything I've told you... is either
an extraordinarily elaborate lie...

710
01:19:33,176 --> 01:19:35,721
or the very simple truth.

711
01:19:40,434 --> 01:19:43,061
It's a lie.

712
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:08,085
No! No!

713
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:14,716
They're not dead. They're not dead.

714
01:20:14,841 --> 01:20:17,761
Don't hold back. Let it out. Let it come.

715
01:20:24,893 --> 01:20:26,686
I'm...

716
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:29,397
Arkady, I'm going out of my mind.

717
01:20:29,481 --> 01:20:32,025
I don't know what's going on or who to...

718
01:20:32,984 --> 01:20:35,987
Irina, listen to me. I won't tell you lies.

719
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:40,699
- No, you're tormenting me.
- No. No, Irina.

720
01:20:52,628 --> 01:20:57,967
It doesn't matter how ridiculous a lie is
if it's your only chance of escape.

721
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:59,927
No. Irina, no.

722
01:21:00,052 --> 01:21:05,473
It doesn't matter how obvious the truth is
if the truth is that you'll never escape.

723
01:21:05,598 --> 01:21:07,225
Irina.

724
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:57,456
So this Irina was
a friend of my brother.

725
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:00,459
At the university before he was deported.

726
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:03,795
Why did he come back?

727
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:08,633
Jimmy wanted to be a fuckin' hero.
You gotta turn right, right here.

728
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:13,012
He was determined to smuggle somebody
out of the Soviet Union.

729
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:16,015
Anybody, even if they didn't wanna go.

730
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:19,435
How come you know so much about us?

731
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:22,689
My grandmother. She was one
of you. She was a Russian.

732
01:23:22,814 --> 01:23:25,984
I spoke Russian before I spoke English.

733
01:23:26,109 --> 01:23:29,528
Jimmy was... He was always
obsessed with this country.

734
01:23:29,653 --> 01:23:32,114
It's all he ever talked about.

735
01:23:32,197 --> 01:23:35,701
All right. You gotta turn left
in here and then park.

736
01:23:36,994 --> 01:23:40,163
- Heard of born-again Christians?
- No.

737
01:23:40,289 --> 01:23:45,252
Born-again Christians. They don't smoke,
they don't swear, they don't fuck.

738
01:23:45,377 --> 01:23:50,173
All they do is talk about Jesus
and try to walk on the goddamn water.

739
01:23:51,466 --> 01:23:54,635
That was Jimmy, God love him.

740
01:23:58,723 --> 01:24:02,768
- That's it over there.
- How'd you find this place?

741
01:24:04,562 --> 01:24:07,732
I got a nose for fresh fish
and chicken blood.

742
01:24:09,525 --> 01:24:11,485
What a stench.

743
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:15,198
This is where they made the chest.
That's how they got 'em out.

744
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:19,034
- Live sables.
- Bingo. They fed 'em the fresh meat.

745
01:24:20,076 --> 01:24:22,204
Six live sables.

746
01:24:22,287 --> 01:24:25,040
I'm no expert on sable shit
but, yeah, I think so.

747
01:24:25,123 --> 01:24:27,792
They'd be worth how much
to an American?

748
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:32,380
Freedom. Smash the monopoly. How
high can you count? Worth killing for.

749
01:24:32,464 --> 01:24:35,050
Motive.

750
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:37,552
Evidence.

751
01:24:37,677 --> 01:24:39,721
Circumstantial.

752
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,391
Witness.

753
01:24:44,475 --> 01:24:47,311
In your apartment, Arkady.

754
01:24:47,394 --> 01:24:51,524
She's got to tell me, now.
Osborne is leaving in three days.

755
01:24:55,236 --> 01:24:57,530
Don't kill him.

756
01:24:58,489 --> 01:25:00,533
Not yet.

757
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:13,086
What is it, Arkasha?

758
01:25:13,169 --> 01:25:16,673
I have no sugar for your tea.

759
01:25:16,756 --> 01:25:19,425
I don't need it.

760
01:25:22,428 --> 01:25:25,765
Do you still think I'm lying to you?

761
01:25:25,849 --> 01:25:30,561
- That I am just a militia investigator?
- Arkasha...

762
01:25:30,686 --> 01:25:34,982
Do you imagine I'm trying to trap you,
that this is all just a terrible game?

763
01:25:35,065 --> 01:25:36,942
No.

764
01:25:39,653 --> 01:25:41,947
But...

765
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:44,074
But what?

766
01:25:46,451 --> 01:25:50,038
- If Valerya is safe somewhere...
- Irina, I love you.

767
01:25:50,163 --> 01:25:52,457
I... Arkasha...

768
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:55,209
Help me.

769
01:25:57,086 --> 01:26:00,089
I've learned to trust nothing.

770
01:26:00,172 --> 01:26:02,216
Nobody.

771
01:26:03,301 --> 01:26:04,760
Never.

772
01:26:04,844 --> 01:26:06,470
Irina.

773
01:26:07,513 --> 01:26:10,516
If Valerya is safe somewhere, I...

774
01:26:12,185 --> 01:26:16,105
And if she is dead, she is dead.
How can I help her?

775
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:30,660
- Let's go.
- Arkady.

776
01:26:31,912 --> 01:26:34,372
You talk too easily about dying.

777
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,803
Where are we going, Arkasha?

778
01:26:49,929 --> 01:26:52,056
You'll see.

779
01:27:27,173 --> 01:27:30,343
You know who was here, don't you?

780
01:27:30,426 --> 01:27:32,469
Come on!

781
01:27:32,594 --> 01:27:34,054
No.

782
01:27:35,514 --> 01:27:38,433
Then what else can I do?

783
01:27:51,697 --> 01:27:53,740
Little Jimmy.

784
01:27:57,743 --> 01:28:00,413
Kostia, the big man.

785
01:28:03,165 --> 01:28:06,419
Valerya, you. Let us reconstruct.

786
01:28:06,544 --> 01:28:09,714
- Please. Arkady, don't.
- There's three of you.

787
01:28:09,839 --> 01:28:14,552
You believe a whole new life
is about to begin. Yes. Glide.

788
01:28:14,635 --> 01:28:17,555
Glide. Valerya and Kostia and Jimmy.

789
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:21,683
Let your skates bite and hiss.

790
01:28:21,808 --> 01:28:27,564
Your very movement reminds you of the
freedom that will soon be yours. Glide.

791
01:28:28,356 --> 01:28:31,026
Glide, my little ones.

792
01:28:31,151 --> 01:28:33,195
Ah, Valerya.

793
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:38,283
The little bird. She's wearing her
friend's skates. Her good friend.

794
01:28:38,408 --> 01:28:41,745
But there's someone else watching.

795
01:28:42,662 --> 01:28:47,374
Isn't there? Someone who
beckons them from the ice.

796
01:28:47,499 --> 01:28:51,712
Oh, happy Valerya. Trusting
Valerya. Innocent Valerya.

797
01:28:51,837 --> 01:28:54,924
I'm their saviour from the West.
It's laughter and toasts.

798
01:28:55,007 --> 01:28:57,218
Hear the music?

799
01:28:57,301 --> 01:29:02,348
Ah, we need another bottle.
Why not? I sort through the bag.

800
01:29:02,473 --> 01:29:05,726
I feel the grip of the gun.

801
01:29:08,521 --> 01:29:11,689
I turn to Kostia and I smile.

802
01:29:13,024 --> 01:29:14,317
And...

803
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,283
Jimmy doesn't know what's
happening. How can this be?

804
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:26,746
Osborne had used him to gull the others.
He had been brought back into Russia

805
01:29:26,871 --> 01:29:31,084
as proof that Osborne could get
people in and out. Isn't that so?

806
01:29:32,544 --> 01:29:35,963
Poor Jimmy. Idealistic Jimmy
who only wanted to help.

807
01:29:36,046 --> 01:29:39,716
The Christian who now
must turn the other cheek.

808
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,770
- What about Valerya?
- No, Arkady.

809
01:29:51,854 --> 01:29:54,857
- No.
- My love, why don't you stop me?

810
01:29:54,982 --> 01:29:58,317
Do I have to be the killer?
I have to have a witness.

811
01:29:58,442 --> 01:30:01,946
Someone must tell me.

812
01:30:04,824 --> 01:30:07,743
You must tell me.

813
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:09,996
I can't.

814
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:16,669
She doesn't scream. Doesn't run.

815
01:30:16,752 --> 01:30:18,796
What's the point?

816
01:30:18,921 --> 01:30:22,340
Her life, her hopes... done.

817
01:30:23,633 --> 01:30:28,263
This man has made love to her. He can
bring the gun as close as he wants.

818
01:30:28,346 --> 01:30:32,392
He can almost caress her with it
and she'll welcome the bullet.

819
01:30:39,065 --> 01:30:40,942
No.

820
01:30:41,067 --> 01:30:42,611
Yes.

821
01:30:56,832 --> 01:30:58,876
But what of Valerya's friend?

822
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:04,256
What about you? She won't tell because
she wants Valerya to be in America, free.

823
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:10,803
She won't tell because Osborne has
told her she is to be the next to get out,

824
01:31:10,887 --> 01:31:16,267
and this fantasy is the most
important thing in her life.

825
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:18,937
It's all that keeps her going.

826
01:31:19,062 --> 01:31:20,939
Yes.

827
01:31:27,612 --> 01:31:30,532
So, the question is, where is Valerya?

828
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,744
New York.

829
01:31:35,744 --> 01:31:38,455
She's in New York.

830
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,801
But in Moscow...

831
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:57,850
the great Professor Andreev...

832
01:31:58,767 --> 01:32:01,310
can reconstruct a head.

833
01:32:02,603 --> 01:32:04,647
A face.

834
01:32:05,565 --> 01:32:07,775
From the bones and tissue alone.

835
01:32:07,859 --> 01:32:10,611
No. Hope is all I know.

836
01:32:10,736 --> 01:32:12,780
Here is Valerya.

837
01:32:13,573 --> 01:32:16,325
V- Valerya. Valerya. Valerya!

838
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:24,583
- Valerya who?
- Valerya Davidova.

839
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,085
- The others?
- Kostia Borodin. James Kirwill.

840
01:32:27,169 --> 01:32:30,255
- What were they doing here?
- Making a chest for Osborne.

841
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,507
American furrier, Jack Osborne?

842
01:32:32,632 --> 01:32:34,676
Yes, Jack Osborne.

843
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:39,347
You saw what they brought
Osborne here from Siberia.

844
01:32:39,472 --> 01:32:41,933
Tell me. Say it.

845
01:32:42,017 --> 01:32:43,476
Sables.

846
01:32:43,602 --> 01:32:46,521
Live, dead, pelts, what?

847
01:32:46,605 --> 01:32:49,607
- Live sables.
- How many?

848
01:32:49,732 --> 01:32:52,568
Six sables.

849
01:32:52,651 --> 01:32:55,112
Six live sables.

850
01:32:55,196 --> 01:32:57,239
Good girl.

851
01:32:58,115 --> 01:33:00,159
I hate you.

852
01:33:05,372 --> 01:33:09,210
Irina, lies are not freedom.

853
01:33:09,335 --> 01:33:11,629
I hate you!

854
01:33:47,287 --> 01:33:49,331
Where'd she go?

855
01:33:52,084 --> 01:33:55,504
Think she's taken off with Osborne, huh?

856
01:33:59,174 --> 01:34:02,009
OK. Well, tell me where
we're going, will you?

857
01:34:02,093 --> 01:34:05,680
I need the other head.
Then I'll have enough.

858
01:34:06,347 --> 01:34:08,391
The other head?

859
01:34:29,035 --> 01:34:31,413
- KGB?
- Yes.

860
01:34:31,538 --> 01:34:35,458
But why would they steal the evidence?
It must be something else.

861
01:34:35,542 --> 01:34:38,712
- What else?
- Well...

862
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,549
We'll see, won't we?

863
01:35:42,272 --> 01:35:45,192
What the hell are you doin'?

864
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:49,196
You know where we are.

865
01:35:49,321 --> 01:35:51,990
Now I do.

866
01:36:02,584 --> 01:36:04,627
I'm a fool.

867
01:36:05,461 --> 01:36:08,881
- What does that mean?
- That I've missed everything.

868
01:36:09,465 --> 01:36:12,635
That's lamskoy, the chief
prosecutor of Moscow.

869
01:36:13,636 --> 01:36:17,139
And Jack Osborne. They've
been dealing the whole time.

870
01:36:18,349 --> 01:36:23,396
So now they'll deal with me.
I've no chance now, nowhere to go.

871
01:36:23,479 --> 01:36:25,356
They've beaten me.

872
01:36:27,607 --> 01:36:29,985
Oh, God.

873
01:36:30,068 --> 01:36:32,279
Don't look.

874
01:37:21,326 --> 01:37:25,538
- You'll be even richer.
- You won't be exactly poor.

875
01:37:25,622 --> 01:37:29,542
What can I spend it on here?
I wish I could come to Stockholm.

876
01:37:29,667 --> 01:37:33,254
Diamonds look their best
on a young girl's throat.

877
01:37:33,338 --> 01:37:36,508
You must never
again be seen with me.

878
01:37:36,591 --> 01:37:39,511
But I'll send you a postcard
from Stockholm.

879
01:37:39,636 --> 01:37:41,678
Good luck, then.

880
01:38:07,203 --> 01:38:09,247
- Bastard.
- Don't.

881
01:38:10,373 --> 01:38:14,502
You're making a mistake. We're
on the same side. I promise you.

882
01:38:17,129 --> 01:38:19,841
We wanna talk to him.

883
01:38:27,849 --> 01:38:29,891
You're a fool!

884
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:34,146
We don't need to talk to him.
Osborne's going to Stockholm.

885
01:38:36,148 --> 01:38:38,525
Stockholm!

886
01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:41,319
Come on! Get me out of this place.

887
01:38:41,403 --> 01:38:44,573
Come on! I wanna stay one step
ahead of that bastard.

888
01:38:44,656 --> 01:38:49,119
You on the outside and me on the inside,
looking at you from the morgue!

889
01:39:27,155 --> 01:39:30,658
I want you to promise me,
Anton, on your life...

890
01:39:32,076 --> 01:39:38,166
that you will take all this - papers, tape -
personally to the prosecutor general.

891
01:39:38,249 --> 01:39:41,252
On my life, I promise.

892
01:39:43,462 --> 01:39:47,508
- And give me your gun.
- Oh, Christ.

893
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:05,442
It's a lawyer's special issue.

894
01:40:05,526 --> 01:40:08,444
It probably won't shoot straight.

895
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:20,623
And if Irina ever turns up...
take care of her for me.

896
01:40:20,706 --> 01:40:24,293
Well, sure. I'll give her your beautiful car.

897
01:40:37,681 --> 01:40:41,017
- What are you going to do?
- A brisk walk.

898
01:40:44,354 --> 01:40:46,815
And a little dip.

899
01:41:11,463 --> 01:41:13,174
Arkady.

900
01:41:13,549 --> 01:41:18,762
The firing squad will not be quite
as much fun as Stockholm, will it?

901
01:41:27,395 --> 01:41:29,939
Arkady.

902
01:41:31,816 --> 01:41:34,736
You're out of... you're out of control.

903
01:41:38,072 --> 01:41:40,783
You kept me on the case
to put pressure on Osborne.

904
01:41:40,867 --> 01:41:44,037
He couldn't have been offering... enough.

905
01:41:44,162 --> 01:41:46,538
But you settled.

906
01:41:46,663 --> 01:41:49,208
The price must have been high.

907
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:54,254
You should be looked after.
Certainly you should be looked after.

908
01:41:54,922 --> 01:41:57,549
How much?

909
01:41:59,551 --> 01:42:02,054
$100,000, American?

910
01:42:02,179 --> 01:42:06,308
Come on. You know
the value of live sables.

911
01:42:06,433 --> 01:42:09,769
This'll be worth tens
of millions to Osborne.

912
01:42:10,561 --> 01:42:12,855
Osborne was greedy.

913
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:15,983
That's why I had to
threaten him with, uh...

914
01:42:16,067 --> 01:42:19,403
I was going to say my best man.

915
01:42:21,572 --> 01:42:24,242
150,000, hm? How about that?

916
01:44:04,254 --> 01:44:06,632
- I've ordered stingers.
- Stingers.

917
01:44:06,715 --> 01:44:09,343
- What's that?
- Cognac and crčme de menthe.

918
01:44:09,426 --> 01:44:12,929
Which of the two is meant
to spoil the other?

919
01:44:13,054 --> 01:44:16,390
In Sweden all
excesses are permitted.

920
01:44:19,936 --> 01:44:24,565
Comrade Pribluda, when do I get
the gun, and where do I kill him?

921
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,320
You will ask no questions.
You will make no comments.

922
01:44:29,403 --> 01:44:32,240
You will simply do as you're told.

923
01:44:32,365 --> 01:44:35,283
Consider yourself lucky to be still alive.

924
01:44:35,408 --> 01:44:41,665
Osborne will trade. He'll return the
six sables, but he'll only talk to you.

925
01:44:41,748 --> 01:44:44,835
And I don't like that, Renko.

926
01:44:44,918 --> 01:44:48,255
I'm warning you. Be very, very careful.

927
01:44:48,755 --> 01:44:51,466
Why will he trade?

928
01:44:52,884 --> 01:44:55,011
What will he trade?

929
01:44:57,347 --> 01:45:01,100
Which is the brandy?
Which is the crčme de menthe?

930
01:45:02,351 --> 01:45:05,271
Let's see if you can tell, Renko.

931
01:45:11,652 --> 01:45:13,362
Bruised, are we?

932
01:45:13,445 --> 01:45:18,159
I imagine they wanted to make quite sure
you were telling the truth about lamskoy.

933
01:45:18,284 --> 01:45:21,787
Well, he didn't know
how good you were, did he?

934
01:45:22,746 --> 01:45:24,956
The fool.

935
01:45:25,081 --> 01:45:28,001
And now you're here to kill me.

936
01:45:28,877 --> 01:45:31,337
Right?

937
01:45:31,421 --> 01:45:33,298
Yes.

938
01:46:13,503 --> 01:46:15,046
What do you think?

939
01:46:15,129 --> 01:46:19,175
You know the KGB will always
track you down, wherever you are.

940
01:46:19,258 --> 01:46:20,968
Precisely.

941
01:46:21,052 --> 01:46:23,971
So, what exactly are you proposing?

942
01:46:28,309 --> 01:46:31,896
- Do not be unduly alarmed.
- What are you doing?

943
01:46:32,021 --> 01:46:35,107
You haven't seen
the rest of the house yet.

944
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:47,577
Old houses are so like people,
don't you think?

945
01:46:47,661 --> 01:46:50,122
Full of surprises.

946
01:46:52,582 --> 01:46:54,876
- Open that door.
- What?

947
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,003
Open the door.

948
01:47:13,435 --> 01:47:15,938
I made them bring you.

949
01:47:16,063 --> 01:47:19,066
You see, corruption is part of us.

950
01:47:19,191 --> 01:47:21,485
All of us.

951
01:47:21,569 --> 01:47:24,488
The very heart of us.

952
01:47:27,115 --> 01:47:29,075
Irina?

953
01:47:42,589 --> 01:47:46,509
Why should a woman sleep with a killer
unless she likes being hurt?

954
01:47:46,634 --> 01:47:48,261
- No!
- No?

955
01:47:48,344 --> 01:47:52,264
Then it's money that excites you,
perhaps? It's money?

956
01:47:52,389 --> 01:47:57,644
You've earned it, Irina. You paid with
the lives of your friends. What is this?

957
01:47:57,769 --> 01:48:00,689
Is this another one of his gifts?

958
01:48:01,523 --> 01:48:04,234
You're a whore, Irina.

959
01:48:05,444 --> 01:48:07,488
You're a whore.

960
01:48:09,823 --> 01:48:15,995
When you showed me the head -
Valerya's head - I decided to kill myself.

961
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,164
- Melodrama.
- Yes.

962
01:48:19,874 --> 01:48:23,294
I went to Osborne instead.
I slept with him.

963
01:48:27,715 --> 01:48:33,888
I didn't feel dirty. I felt as though
a layer of my skin had been burnt away.

964
01:48:34,806 --> 01:48:39,184
- I knew what to do.
- Yes. Sell yourself.

965
01:48:40,477 --> 01:48:43,396
What else did I have to sell?

966
01:48:53,323 --> 01:48:56,326
I told him I knew everything.

967
01:48:56,409 --> 01:49:00,288
But I knew he wanted me. I told
you I'd do anything to get out.

968
01:49:00,413 --> 01:49:02,040
Anything.

969
01:49:02,165 --> 01:49:06,627
The second day in Stockholm I went
to the KGB. The Russian embassy.

970
01:49:06,752 --> 01:49:10,881
I told them I could get the sables back
if they would trade you for them,

971
01:49:11,006 --> 01:49:14,343
if they would let you out because...

972
01:49:14,426 --> 01:49:16,470
because I...

973
01:49:20,641 --> 01:49:22,768
Irina?

974
01:49:26,522 --> 01:49:28,982
I had to get you out.

975
01:49:29,107 --> 01:49:31,651
It was the only reason.

976
01:49:33,236 --> 01:49:36,739
Why would Osborne trade
the sables for me?

977
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,457
He's got more than six, Arkasha.

978
01:49:45,582 --> 01:49:49,085
Valerya and the others helped him
use the route once before.

979
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:51,671
He's got another six sables.

980
01:49:51,796 --> 01:49:55,549
And nobody knows it, except him and me.

981
01:49:58,135 --> 01:50:00,345
And now you.

982
01:50:31,292 --> 01:50:37,048
Frankly, I am astounded that your people
would understand a sexual obsession.

983
01:50:38,299 --> 01:50:43,345
But, well, it seems they understand that
I want her enough to trade the sables.

984
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:47,057
Only she won't come without you.

985
01:50:47,182 --> 01:50:49,226
But they sent me here to kill you.

986
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:52,521
But they'd rather have
their little furry friends back.

987
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:55,899
- But my job is to kill you.
- What?

988
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:58,902
Kill a man who keeps his promises?

989
01:51:01,696 --> 01:51:05,825
You see the hat that was not
delivered to you in Moscow.

990
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:08,494
Barguzinsky sable. The finest.

991
01:51:08,577 --> 01:51:12,081
There's no more comparison
between this and ordinary fur

992
01:51:12,206 --> 01:51:15,709
than Irina's skin and that of other women.

993
01:51:16,794 --> 01:51:18,921
Feel it.

994
01:51:19,755 --> 01:51:24,969
You're sick, Osborne. Sick. I don't want
the hat or anything else from you.

995
01:51:25,094 --> 01:51:29,223
Oh, be forgiving. You want
to survive, don't you?

996
01:51:30,431 --> 01:51:34,561
Tomorrow, if you convince them,
the Soviets and I will trade.

997
01:51:34,686 --> 01:51:37,605
You and Irina for the six sables.

998
01:51:38,523 --> 01:51:40,817
Oh, and, uh, $200,000.

999
01:51:42,193 --> 01:51:44,237
Do you agree?

1000
01:51:45,321 --> 01:51:46,865
Yes.

1001
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:01,628
A stinger, please. A stinger.

1002
01:52:05,674 --> 01:52:09,011
- That's a whore's drink.
- I am a whore.

1003
01:52:09,094 --> 01:52:11,305
- How many?
- Three upstairs. KGB.

1004
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:14,933
- Maybe more down here.
- OK. What's the score?

1005
01:52:15,017 --> 01:52:17,853
- I'll give you one, two, three.
- OK. Shoot.

1006
01:52:17,978 --> 01:52:19,604
One.

1007
01:52:19,729 --> 01:52:24,859
Osborne is deceiving KGB into a swap.
Six sables for Irina and me, plus dollars.

1008
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:30,573
- But he's got more out than they know.
- When's the swap?

1009
01:52:30,698 --> 01:52:34,035
- Tomorrow. They've bought it.
- OK. Two.

1010
01:52:34,786 --> 01:52:39,499
Two. I am under orders from Moscow
to kill Osborne and the sables.

1011
01:52:40,583 --> 01:52:43,585
- Three.
- Three. The KGB kills Osborne,

1012
01:52:43,710 --> 01:52:47,214
you, the girl and the sables.
Am I right?

1013
01:52:48,048 --> 01:52:50,967
- Correct.
- Does she know this?

1014
01:52:51,843 --> 01:52:53,470
No.

1015
01:52:56,598 --> 01:53:01,937
- You're in a hell of a jam. Did I tell you?
- Yes, thank you. Eat some of my peanuts.

1016
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:04,689
I'll be there. Good luck.

1017
01:53:04,815 --> 01:53:08,150
- What are you doing?
- This is a whore's drink.

1018
01:53:08,234 --> 01:53:12,863
- Give me that. Let's get out of here.
- We've got an early start.

1019
01:53:23,833 --> 01:53:26,752
Son of a bitch.

1020
01:54:22,972 --> 01:54:25,641
Oh, no.

1021
01:54:29,771 --> 01:54:32,315
- Don't touch him.
- Oh...

1022
01:54:33,357 --> 01:54:35,234
God, no.

1023
01:54:35,318 --> 01:54:38,488
What are you up to, Renko?
What's he doing here?

1024
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:41,824
- What the hell is going on?
- Who is it? Who?

1025
01:54:43,951 --> 01:54:45,994
A friend.

1026
01:54:48,288 --> 01:54:50,332
He killed my dogs.

1027
01:54:52,209 --> 01:54:56,338
I gutted him because he killed my dogs.

1028
01:54:57,422 --> 01:54:59,966
Now, Mr Osborne.

1029
01:55:00,091 --> 01:55:03,595
Let's not concern ourselves
with the intruder.

1030
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:06,556
Are these the six sables?

1031
01:55:06,681 --> 01:55:10,810
The sables are dead.
Throw down your guns.

1032
01:55:11,602 --> 01:55:14,313
Not while you have yours.

1033
01:55:14,855 --> 01:55:18,609
Mr Osborne, everything is correct now.

1034
01:55:19,193 --> 01:55:23,322
You may take Renko here. We take
the sables. No one needs guns.

1035
01:55:24,073 --> 01:55:28,536
The sables are dead.
I do not intend to join them.

1036
01:55:29,787 --> 01:55:32,540
We're not thugs, Mr Osborne.

1037
01:55:32,623 --> 01:55:35,250
If that's what you want,
you may have our weapons.

1038
01:55:35,333 --> 01:55:38,419
- Rurik, Osborne will kill you.
- Stay out of this, you.

1039
01:55:38,503 --> 01:55:42,632
Wake up. He'll kill all
of you, except Pribluda.

1040
01:55:42,757 --> 01:55:45,218
- What?
- Pribluda is Osborne's man.

1041
01:55:45,301 --> 01:55:49,597
- That's why he'll give up his gun.
- Renko, you're a liar.

1042
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:11,076
It's all right. Renko is unarmed.

1043
01:56:11,201 --> 01:56:15,581
- I made sure of that.
- Put the gun down.

1044
01:56:15,706 --> 01:56:19,126
- What?
- Put down the gun.

1045
01:56:24,464 --> 01:56:25,548
Jack...

1046
01:56:26,924 --> 01:56:28,801
listen.

1047
01:56:30,386 --> 01:56:32,930
I've got the money.

1048
01:56:40,646 --> 01:56:42,690
Mr Osborne.

1049
01:56:43,649 --> 01:56:46,568
On your right there are two more KGB.

1050
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:58,330
Keep your head down.

1051
01:58:13,944 --> 01:58:16,321
Holy Peter.

1052
01:59:10,123 --> 01:59:12,958
Arkasha!

1053
01:59:13,084 --> 01:59:15,044
Irina, stay out!

1054
01:59:36,565 --> 01:59:38,608
Step out, Renko.

1055
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:43,071
Or the girl is dead.

1056
01:59:44,364 --> 01:59:46,407
No, Arkasha.

1057
01:59:50,829 --> 01:59:52,539
Renko.

1058
02:00:51,595 --> 02:00:54,306
That's a KGB gun.

1059
02:01:16,994 --> 02:01:19,663
Now we can be free.

1060
02:01:28,089 --> 02:01:29,965
Arkasha?

1061
02:01:33,969 --> 02:01:36,263
Irina.

1062
02:01:37,765 --> 02:01:40,767
I have to go back.

1063
02:01:40,892 --> 02:01:42,519
No.

1064
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:48,066
I have to go back, otherwise
they will hunt you down.

1065
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:50,276
That was...

1066
02:01:51,736 --> 02:01:57,075
That was the deal I made in Moscow.
Kill the sables. Kill Osborne. Go back.

1067
02:01:58,159 --> 02:02:00,870
And you could go free.

1068
02:02:02,414 --> 02:02:04,289
No.

1069
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:07,960
No.

1070
02:02:11,505 --> 02:02:13,715
Irina, look at me.

1071
02:02:13,799 --> 02:02:16,468
No, look at me.

1072
02:02:18,971 --> 02:02:21,348
What do you see?

1073
02:02:23,225 --> 02:02:25,269
A Russian.

1074
02:02:26,311 --> 02:02:29,230
I never could be anything else.

1075
02:02:32,442 --> 02:02:34,986
- Then I'll come back.
- No.

1076
02:02:35,111 --> 02:02:38,030
You were dead there. Dying there.

1077
02:02:41,325 --> 02:02:43,786
I will always...

1078
02:02:44,954 --> 02:02:47,415
love you.

1079
02:02:49,625 --> 02:02:51,502
Arkasha.

1080
02:03:15,108 --> 02:03:17,151
One day, Irina.

1081
02:03:21,113 --> 02:03:23,157
One day.

1082
02:04:14,665 --> 02:04:18,877
Chief Investigator Renko reporting
for duty, Comrade General.

1083
02:05:03,378 --> 02:05:06,214
One day, Arkasha.

1084
02:05:06,339 --> 02:05:08,383
One day.
