00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,854
Uh, sorry. I think maybe I should go.

[man snoring]

21
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,192

[Puss] What can I say?
I was a bad kitty.

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,334
Just a fugitive from the law...
forever running.

37
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,754
Searching for a way to clear my name.

38
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,093
And I would get that chance...

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,846

Here, kitty, kitty! [laughs]

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,737
Raoul. Look what the cat dragged in.

49
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,281
Oh, wait... That is the cat!

Did you lose your ball of yarn?

[Puss] I am not looking for trouble.

60
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,954
I am but a humble gato
in search of his next meal.

61
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,291
Perhaps you gentlemen
can help me find a simple score?

62
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:57,254
The only thing you'll find tonight is
trouble... Puss In Boots.

63
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,631
[footsteps approach]

64
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,893
Well, perhaps if one of us
were to tell the law

65
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,605
that you are in town,
we could split the reward.

66
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,152
[men shriek]

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,029
[tsk-tsking]

68
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,617
You made the cat angry.

69
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,245
You do not want to make the cat angry!

70
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,041
[clears throat] The Church
of St. Michael has just put up

71
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,669
a golden statue
of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

72
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,671
I do not steal from churches.

73
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,757
The boys' orphanage has been
donated silver candlesticks,

74
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,551
they would look
very lovely in your home.

75
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,680
- I do not steal from orphans.
- Uh, what about Jack and Jill?

76
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,850
- Shh! Are you crazy?
- The what?

77
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,609
The murderous outlaws Jack and Jill have
gotten their hands on... magic beans.

78
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,237
Do not joke with me about magic beans!

79
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,908
I searched half my life for them.
They do not exist.

80
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,245
No, cat. We have seen them.

81
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,457
These... are the beans of legend.

82
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,877
Huh? Whoa.

83
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,505
Grows a vine to the Land of Giants,

84
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,425
and the Golden Goose.

85
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,176
The Golden Goose...

86
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,263
A heist like this
could set you up for life.

87
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,265
All nine of them.

88
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,559
Show him the golden eggs.

89
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,102
No!

90
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,063
Please, you have shown enough.

91
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:43,110
Only a cat with a death wish would
steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

92
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,783
The only wish I have
is to repay an old debt.

93
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,952
And this is my chance.

94
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,455
Now...

95
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,625
...where do I find this Jack and Jill?

- [man groans]
- [thuds]

104
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,087
Well, I think one just opened up.

105
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,923
[man whimpers]

106
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,678
We'd like a complimentary
continental breakfast.

107
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,223
And don't even think about
skimpin' on them baby muffins.

108
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,855
[door locks]

109
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,733
[whimpering]
We don't have any baby muffins.

- [sobbing]
- [ballad resumes]

111
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,323
[Jack] You know, Jill...

112
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,200
...I been thinking.

113
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,035
[Jill sighing] Get it out.

114
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,914
I, um... Once we're done
with this magic bean business

115
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,792
and got ourselves all them
beautiful golden eggs...

116
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,003
Mm-hm, go on.

117
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,965
...that we cut down on some
of the hijacking and murdering.

118
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,759
I mean, it's fun and all, but, uh...

119
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,430
...I want a baby.

120
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,141
[barking]

121
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,728
- [fireworks crackle]
- [distant cheering]

122
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,646
[Jill] A baby what, Jack?

123
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,231
[Jack] A baby us, Jill.

124
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,276
We'll raise it wild,
like a squirrel or something.

125
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,030
Holy frijoles!

126
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,032
They do exist.

127
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,242
[Jill groans]
Ever since you fell down that hill

128
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,619
and broke your crown,
you have been talking crazy.

129
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,040
[glass squeaking]

130
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,627
[Jack] It couldn't hurt to have
an extra shooter during ambushes.

131
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,006
[Jill] Maybe I cut too deep...
cut that brain out of your head.

132
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,053
- Hey! What gives?
- [hisses]

133
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,222
[Jack] If it's to be a girl,
she'll have your strong...

134
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,433
No! No! No!

135
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,644
You, you, you!
You stop where you are!

136
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,896
[Jill] I don't know, Jack.

137
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,565
How do I ride and shoot
with a baby slung on my back?

138
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,319
[Jack] They got them backpacks now.
The way I see it, Jill...

139
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,113
Those beans are mine!

140
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,365
[Jack] ...we fall off
this flat earth one time.

141
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,034
What better proof of our love...

142
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,994
- Me?
- [Jack continuing indistinctly]

143
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,705

[makes snapping sound]

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,459
You snap me?!

Uh, no. [chuckles nervously]

152
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,483
No hablo inglés.

153
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,652
- [explosion]
- Whoa, whoa!

154
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,782
You are going to pay for this!

- Huh?!

159
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,468
Oh!

You just cost me a chance
at getting the golden eggs, mi amigo.

180
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,807
Put up your dukes.

If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

362
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,495
- Let's spin him.
- [shrieks]

363
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,330
Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

364
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,958
Not again! No! I'm gonna yolk!

365
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,670
[Puss] Even though he took
my beans, the egg stood up for me,

366
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,964
- and I decided then...
- [grunts]

367
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,341
...that I would always have his back.

368
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,218
[grunts]

369
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,054
[hisses]

370
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,850
Wow!

371
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,185
That was very impressive. Thanks!

372
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,479
- [horn blowing]
- [girl] Hey, egg boy!

373
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,732
[girl clucks]

374
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,735
[Puss] There was something
about this strange little egg

375
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,862
that intrigued me.

376
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,923
[shrieks] Oh... it's you.

377
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,382
I've been collecting for months now.

378
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,885
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

379
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,306
[whispering]
Magic beans... is what they are.

380
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,393
Hello? You gonna tell all the other kids

381
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,146
that I believe in magic now?
Is that what you're gonna do?

382
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,359
No? What's your name?

383
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,820
- [mews]
- You don't say much, do you?

384
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,365
I think I'll call you Sparky.

385
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,659
Whiskers?

386
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,035
Zoltar!

387
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,748
How about Puss?

388
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,627
[Puss] Humpty's mind was full
of imagination and invention.

389
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,420
[Humpty] What is that,
50 feet down there?

390
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:29,050
Here we go. Give me a... [yelling] Puss!

391
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:33,346
- [gasps]
- Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

392
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,057
[laughs, grunts]

393
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,353
[Puss] He spoke of legends
and adventures beyond my wildest dreams.

394
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,606
Oh, when I find those
magic beans, they'll grow a vine

395
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,942
straight up into the clouds,

396
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,405
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

397
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,199
...the Golden Goose.

398
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,576
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

399
00:24:55,744 --> 00:25:00,707
Just one of her golden eggs...
could set me for life.

400
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,292
It's my destiny, Puss.

401
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,923
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

402
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:12,135
[sighs]

403
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,596
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

404
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,434
This is kind of a solo dream here.

405
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,687
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

406
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,480
[purring]

407
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,775
What are you doing?
Oh, man, that's good.

408
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,571
The eye thing that you're doing,
that is really splendid.

409
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,741
OK, let me just think for a second.
All right... OK.

410
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,202
Uh... This is crazy, but...

411
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,539
...I am considering a partnership.

412
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,043
I just need to know one thing.

413
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,378
Can you commit?

414
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,797
Sí... I can commit.

415
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,259
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

416
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,636
[grunting]

417
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,971
OK...

418
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,266
[Humpty] First rule of Bean Club...

419
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,729
...you do not talk about Bean Club.

420
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,731
Second rule of Bean Club...

421
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,943
...is you don't talk
about Bean Club. You ready?

422
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,236
Ready.

423
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,406
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

424
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,951
Never alone, always together...

425
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,578
Humpty and Puss...

426
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,246
[both] Brothers forever.

427
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,751
[Puss] And from that moment on,
we were united on a great adventure

428
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,003
to find the magic beans.

429
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,213
Help me up.

430
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,006
Egg me.

431
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,800
[Puss] Humpty was the brains...

432
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,844
- [screams] Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

433
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,722
- [Humpty] That really hurt!
- [Puss] ...and I was the skill.

434
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,058
[Humpty] I'm cracked!

435
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,728
We got red beans, green beans,

436
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,065
coffee beans, lima beans...
but no magic beans.

437
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,903
- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

438
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,531
[Puss] Finding them
meant everything to us.

439
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,076
[Humpty] Oh, I almost forgot
the most important thing.

440
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,911
That's me and you, Puss.

441
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,914
Me and you.

442
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,583
[Puss] But we never did find them.

443
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,003
And, as years passed,
the quest for magic beans

444
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,466
seemed more and more
like the dreams of a child.

445
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,676
Aw!

446
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,847
[Puss] As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...

447
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,849
...and often found it.

448
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:27,186
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time is jail time.

449
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,564
They're just kids. [chuckles]

450
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,233
They are thieves.

451
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,443
[Imelda clears throat]

452
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,198
You are better than this.

453
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,535
I believe in you with all my heart.

454
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,330
Please do not let me down.

455
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,082
I hate this place.

456
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,793
I cannot wait for us to get out of here.

457
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,589
Throw a rock.
It'll make you feel better.

458
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,300
- [bellows]
- [crowd gasps]

459
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,634
Oh, boy. We should go.

460
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,181
[Puss] On instinct, I reacted.

461
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,348
Ha!

462
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,142
[grunts]

463
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,977
- [bull snorts]
- Aah!

464
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,356
[bellows in slow motion]

465
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,199
He saved the Comandante's mother!

466
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,784
[moos]

467
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,665
You saved my mother.

468
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,668
Señor Puss... he is a hero!

469
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,670
[cheering]

470
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:39,175
Today we see that courage and bravery

471
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,219
come in all sizes!

472
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,806
[Puss] Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.

473
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,601
These are for you, my boy.

474
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,606
Wear them as a symbol
of honor... and justice.

475
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:57,526
I will make you proud, Mama.

476
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:02,698
You already have, my Puss In Boots.

477
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,287
[Puss] How strange it was
to give a cat boots...

478
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,624
...but, whoa... I looked good!

479
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,294
And as the light of my path
grew brighter...

480
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,131
...Humpty's road grew ever darker.

481
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,260
[footsteps approach]

482
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,306
Gracias, Comandante.

483
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,850
Be careful of the company you keep.

484
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,769
[spits]

485
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,064
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

486
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,358
You're not stealing
lollipops anymore, Humpty.

487
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,734
This is getting serious.

488
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,279
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

489
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,656
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

490
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,575
I've been casing the silversmith
and it's perfect.

491
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,203
You and me, in and out, 50 seconds tops.

492
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,998
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

493
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,792
These people have done nothing to us.

494
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,421
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

495
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,008
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

496
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,551
That is not true.

497
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,803
We weren't born here. We're orphans!

498
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,763
All we got is each other,
you understand?

499
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,557
We are better than this.

500
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,476
But we're partners.

501
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,687
We are brothers.

502
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,149
But I am not stealing anymore.

503
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,154
[Puss] But Humpty
would not give up so easily.

504
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,281
- [yowls]
- [Humpty] I'm in trouble, Puss!

505
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,658
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

506
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,952
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

507
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,914
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

508
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,509
[distant whistle blowing]

509
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,970
OK, I've got everything.
We did it. Come on, let's go!

510
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,638
How could you do this to me?!

511
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,266
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

512
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,061
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

513
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,729
- [Puss yowls]
- [groans]

514
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,650
[gasps] You disgrace those boots!

515
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,694
Comandante, please, I can explain!

516
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,945
Arrest them!

517
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,615
- Hiyah!
- [whinnies]

518
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,369
[Humpty] Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

519
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,413
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

520
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,499
[horse whinnies]

521
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,460
[men shouting]

522
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,757
- [gasps]
- Mama...

523
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,759
Pequeño.

524
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,594
Oh! Watch out!

525
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,475
Oh! Oof!

526
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,697
- Oh, no.
- [Humpty] Puss. I can't get up.

527
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,991
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

528
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,576
Freeze!

529
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,079
Puss, save me!

530
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,206
Save yourself.

531
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,583
[guard] We got you.

532
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,185
[Puss] I lost everything
I cared about that day.

533
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,021
My brother.

534
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,690
My honor.

535
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,358
My home.

536
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:30,448
All I thought about was
the disappointment in my mama's eyes.

537
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,368
And I have been running ever since.

538
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,375
The egg betrayed me.

539
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:46,422
- His lies cost me everything.
- [snoring]

540
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,717
- Hey!
- [snorts] I'm awake!

541
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,011
[Humpty] You think
I don't want to fix the past?

542
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,016
I can't get down.

543
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,726
[sighs]

544
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,313
[grunts]

545
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,029
Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

546
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,323
when I don't think about what I lost.

547
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,036
I lost my best friend.

548
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,206
My only friend. And I get it now.

549
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,583
I got greedy and desperate
and I let you down.

550
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,793
I let myself down.

551
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,463
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

552
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,592
Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

553
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,678
[sighs] Please, Puss.

554
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,723
Let me show you
what our friendship meant to me.

555
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,143
[sighs]

556
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,272
- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great.

557
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,444
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

558
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,989
We are not partners
and we are not friends.

559
00:33:55,408 --> 00:34:00,621
OK. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

560
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,666
Yes! [laughs]

561
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,293
I think we got our Bean Club back.

562
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,547
[grunts]

563
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,721
[squealing]

564
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,648
Humpty's plan better work.

565
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,651
Listen, you just need
to worry about your part.

566
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,820
Don't screw it up.

567
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,322
- What?
- Again with the mask?

568
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,284
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

569
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,451
Huh?!

570
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,335
Come on, Puss. Now!

571
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,506
[both grunting]

572
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,217
Our biological clocks
are tickin', darlin'.

573
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,719
You gotta look at the big picture.

574
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,971
- What's your problem?
- Huh?

575
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:03,017
Listen. I put a lot of work
into my body. I look good, and I am not

576
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,602
- just gonna throw that away.
- [gasps]

577
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,648
- [whispers] Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

578
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,150
- [Jill] We're gonna start small.
- Look.

579
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,402
[Jill] Let's just pretend
you have a baby.

580
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,698
Excellent. [chuckles]

581
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,078
[Jill] I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

582
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,914
You don't have to, Jill.
I'll be the stay-at-home dad.

583
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,542
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

584
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,503
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

585
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,589
- [Jack] Little Hamhock's my favorite.
- You've got to hurry up.

586
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,341
- Shh!
- [Jack] He's a cute little bugger.

587
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,551
Why are you not using your claws?

588
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,678
Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

589
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,306
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

590
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,975
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, all right?!

591
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,144
- [snorting]
- [Jill] Was that Hamhock?

592
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,562
- [Kitty gasps]
- [snorting]

593
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,356
Shh. Shh. Shh.

594
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,362
There, there.
Sleepy, sleepy, big, fat piggy.

595
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,405
[squeals happily]

596
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,075
[Jill] Remember when we had to pretend
we had that monkey one time...?

597
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,035
- You babysit.
- [groans]

598
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,788
- Soft paws.
- [Jack] When did we have a monkey?

599
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,581
- [Jill continues indistinctly]
- [sighs]

600
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,751
- Well?
- [Jill] ...what happened last time...

601
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,921
- You sat on it, Jack.
- Hello, beans of legend.

602
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,882
- Let's go.
- [squealing loudly]

603
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,135
[groans]

604
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,389
[metallic clicking]

605
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,519
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Jill.

606
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,230
You messed with our baby.

607
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,773
[growling]

608
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,193
And you took my beans. [cackles]

609
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,362
- Sausage bomb!
- [squealing]

610
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,489
- [yowling]
- [Jack] Whoa!

611
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,037
[Jill] You're gonna pay for this!
Soul-sucking cats!

612
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,206
[muffled shouting]

613
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,457
Signal the egg!

614
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,002
- Yes!
- [whip cracks]

615
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,591
- OK.
- Ready.

616
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,301
- Set.
- Go!

617
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,429
Ow!

618
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,515
[Jill cackling]

619
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,767
[groans]

620
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,023
[squealing]

621
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,942
[grunts]

622
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,361
- [Jill snarling]
- Oh, my God!

623
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,032
- [snarling]
- [gasps]

624
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,953
Whoa!

625
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,040
[groans]

626
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,792
[grunting]

627
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,127
[sighs] Ah!

628
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,004
[Jill chuckles]

629
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,007
All right, cat.
Give me them beans.

630
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,508
[yells, whimpers]

631
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,428
Is it true
a cat always lands on its feet?

632
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,347
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

633
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,641
Well, let's find out.

634
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,018
Hiyah!

635
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,978
- [Jill shrieks]
- Hiyah!

636
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,984
See? I told you I wouldn't let you down!

637
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,196
- [gun blast]
- You think this is over? Ha!

638
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,449
[gasps]

639
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,369
- [whinnies]
- Hey, that was close!

640
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,829
[cackles]

641
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,543
Hiyah!

642
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,881
Now!

643
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,717
[Humpty screams]

644
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,346
We just got to make it
to that bridge! Hang on!

645
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,266
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

646
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:32,768
[squealing]

647
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,648
- [yelling]
- [squealing]

648
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,566
[both] Humpty!

649
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,444
[screaming]

650
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,529
[both gasp]

651
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,658
- We're going to die!
- [whinnies]

652
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,454
[shouts echoing]

653
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,256
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

654
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,345
[cheering, laughter echoing]

655
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,806
[laughter]

656
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,641
Giant's castle...

657
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,810
...here we come.

658
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,815
[Puss sighs] I must hand it to the egg.

659
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,776
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

660
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,113
I mean, flaws.
That was what I meant, not claws.

661
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,282
He's not a cat. [chuckles nervously]

662
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,326
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

663
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,870
Got it.

664
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,914
[muttering] OK, we should be close!

665
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,209
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

666
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,088
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

667
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,549
and you'll never even know I was there.

668
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,718
[gasps]

669
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,345
[groans]

670
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,890
Kitty?

671
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,184
You are not as good as they say.

672
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,188
You're better.

673
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,819
I will respect your privacy.

674
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,951
[Kitty sighs] OK. I'll tell you.

675
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,746
I was just a stray...

676
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,582
...but I had beautiful claws.

677
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,629
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

678
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,131
Gave me milk every morning.

679
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,633
Loved me.

680
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:34,473
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

681
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,975
I don't know why they did it.

682
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,686
But they took my claws.

683
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:45,400
- Cat people are crazy.
- [chuckles]

684
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,319
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

685
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:57,371
[shrieks] Ooh! Whoo!

686
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,331
[muttering]

687
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,047
[panting]

688
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,633
Can you believe this, Puss?

689
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,552
After all these years!

690
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,224
Here. I want you to plant them.

691
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,315
That... is a strange cloud.

692
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,942
[gasps]

693
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,822
[Humpty] Whoa! OK! This is it!
It's happening, hurry!

694
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,034
This way!

695
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,286
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

696
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,706
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

697
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,541
Hole! Right here.

698
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,087
Now place the beans.

699
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,091
[gasps]
Place the beans carefully, please.

700
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,428
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

701
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,557
OK, good. Very good.
Now just stand back.

702
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,275
[wind howling]

703
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,610
[gasps]

704
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,576
[Puss grunting]

705
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,539
[grunts]

706
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,709
[booming]

707
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,381
[whooshing]

708
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,175
Whoa! [shrieks]

709
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,226
What's happening here?

710
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,187
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

711
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,565
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

712
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,776
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

713
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,654
So, come on...
say something nice to it.

714
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,906
OK.

715
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,575
Let me just think for a second.

716
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,410
Hi, little plant.

717
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,578
[yelps]

718
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,916
[stalk creaking]

719
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,503
Whoa!

720
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,967
[screaming]

721
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,844
[grunts, gasps]

722
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,227
[shouts, grunts]

723
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,438
Yow!

724
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,606
Oh!

725
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,818
[grunts, chuckles]

726
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:36,822
[grunts]

727
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,659
- [thunder booms]
- [groans]

728
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,615
[gasps]

729
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,702
[in high-pitched voice] Uh, guys? Whoa!

730
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,704
[both in high-pitched voices] Humpty!

731
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,874
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

732
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,251
You sound weird.

733
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,379
Ah! It's the thin air!

734
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,176
Come on in! It feels great!

735
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,679
[cheering]

736
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,518
- The cloud, it tickles my nose.
- [Humpty] Hoo-hoo!

737
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,189
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew? Ho-ho!

738
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:57,485
[chuckles]

739
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,237
Come on.

740
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,364
[playful shouting]

741
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,621
[growls playfully]

742
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,378
[gasps]

743
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,340
Gotcha!

744
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,383
[yowls playfully]

745
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,302
[laughing]

746
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,471
- Meow.
- [chuckles]

747
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,641
Hey, Puss.
What do you think? Do I shave?

748
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,808
[chuckles]

749
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,602
Let me show you something.

750
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,028
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

751
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,322
I don't know, maybe orphans,

752
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,408
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

753
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,327
dreaming about the future.

754
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,163
That was me and you, Puss.

755
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,832
Me and you.

756
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,961
[Kitty] Boys!

757
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,089
You might want to take a look at this.

758
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,303
[Humpty] The giant's castle.

759
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,014
[gasps, chuckles]

760
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,558
OK, time to suit up.

761
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,768
Humpty!

762
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,104
[Humpty] I'll fit right in
with the golden eggs.

763
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,355
[groans]

764
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,818
Brilliant or what, huh?

765
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,530
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

766
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,199
What? Are you embarrassed?

767
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,617
I'm not.

768
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:32,372
[chuckles] Puss, remember when
everyone was laughing at Bean Club?

769
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,542
[Puss] And who is laughing now?
Ha-ha! We are!

770
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,221
Wow!

771
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,391
[cloud thunks]

772
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,570
[Humpty in normal voice]
That is our target.

773
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,905
[in normal voice] Hey, you don't
sound like an elf anymore.

774
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,782
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

775
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,950
Let's go.

776
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,624
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

777
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,544
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

778
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,963
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

779
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,592
Jack and the Beanstalk, chapter 14,
"Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

780
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,511
- Ahh! Ankle burn.
- [monstrous roar]

781
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,347
- [yelps]
- [Puss grunts]

782
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,350
- Wha... What was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

783
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,935
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

784
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,605
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

785
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:42,317
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

786
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,402
[whispers] Follow me and keep quiet.

787
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,863
[Humpty's suit squeaking]

788
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,329
- [panting]
- [suit squeaking]

789
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,747
Shh! Humpty!

790
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,833
I can't help it.
Everything's rubbing and pinching!

791
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,543
I need powder!

792
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,465
[gasps]

793
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:10,929
- [distant shattering]
- [monstrous roar]

794
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,639
[Humpty shrieks]

795
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,642
[thudding footsteps]

796
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,311
How are we gonna get across?

797
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,480
- [clinking]
- Champagne.

798
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,318
Cheers!

799
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,657
[screaming]

800
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,078
[roaring]

801
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,915
Do not worry. I will protect you.

802
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,751
- [rumbling]
- [gasps]

803
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,086
What are you gonna do?

804
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,088
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

805
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,299
Please. Stop bringing up the guitar.

806
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,560
[groans]

807
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,939
[shrieking]

808
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,651
[whimpering]

809
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,195
Catch me! [yells]

810
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,614
- [roars]
- Hurry!

811
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,367
Hide!

812
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,870
[Humpty] Don't look at it!

813
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:22,375
- [bellowing breaths]
- [Humpty gasping, muttering]

814
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,128
- Shh! Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

815
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,882
[muffled] I said I couldn't breathe and
then you zipped the thing over my mouth!

816
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,469
Shh! Hey. You gotta
get it together. Come on!

817
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,887
OK.

818
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,893
[Humpty grunts]

819
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,896
[sighs]

820
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,358
[gasps]

821
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,530
[Humpty] Look at this.
It's egg paradise.

822
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,784
It's so beautiful,
I feel like I belong here.

823
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,536
[laughs maniacally]

824
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,498
Whoo!

825
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,957
[groans]

826
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,502
Golden eggs. Oh!

827
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,087
Grab as many as you can.

828
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:13,051
[grunting] I thought they were
going to be like chicken size.

829
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:17,430
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

830
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:21,100
- Puss! Ow!
- [grunting]

831
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,478
How are we supposed to get
these out of here?

832
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,021
- I don't know.
- Shh!

833
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,689
- [quacking]
- [gasps]

834
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,484
Oh, my!

835
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,114
- [peeps]
- [Puss] The Golden Goose.

836
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,452
Just look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

837
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,120
[squawks]

838
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,331

841
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,549
Oh... My sweet darling.

842
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,094
- [Humpty giggles]
- I think she likes you.

843

- [monstrous roar]
- [gasping]

844
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,640
[whispering] Let's just take her.

845
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,600
Wait a minute.
This is the goose of legend.

846
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,394
We don't know what happens
if we take her.

847
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,562
[roaring]

848
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,982
I know what happens
if we don't take her, we got nothing.

849
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:13,278
Guys, guys. It's a gold pooper.
We're taking it!

850
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:16,823

Kitty!

867
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,219
What are you doing?

868
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,347

- [Kitty] Whoa!

873
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,083
Come here, you.

874
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:54,962
Got you!

875
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,882
She's mine now!

Hello!

[Humpty screaming]

882
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,159
No! It's not supposed to be this way!

00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,006
Uh... I'm sorry. [chuckles]

888
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,174
Hmm.

889
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,726
[laughing]

890
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,482
Thanks, Ginger.

891
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,904
[peeps softly]

892
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,116
Um, we should maybe cut that down.

893
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,660
[distant squealing]

894
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,371
[Jill] Look at that.

895
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,457
You finally got
that family you wanted, Jack.

896
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,876
- [grunts]
- Did you hear that?

897
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,377
I think he just called me Daddy.

898
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,882
- Oh! He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

899
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:26,679
- [grunts]
- [squealing]

900
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:34,187
- [Jill] Well, what is it?
- [boar squeals]

901
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,272
[rumbling]

902
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,690
Huh?

903
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,986
[boars squeal]

904
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:47,325
- I do believe that's our cue.
- [boar squeals]

905
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,160
[Jack] Hah!

906
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,331
[Puss and Humpty]
To paying back San Ricardo!

907
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,458
To being rich!

908
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,751
¡Olé!

909
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,254
[flamenco music playing]

910
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,511
- [rhythmic clanking]
- [laughing]

911
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,680
Ha! Ha!

912
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,391
[chuckles] You.

913
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,976
Me?

914
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,312
Yeah, yeah, baby! [grunts]

915
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,149
[Humpty] One, two, cha-cha-cha!

916
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,777
Three, four, cha-cha-cha! One, two...

917
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,278
- [peeps]
- What?!

918
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:30,034
There is one word for you,
Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!

919
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,620
I know you have quite
a reputation with the ladies,

920
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,122
Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

921
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,125
I've also been known as the...
Furry Lover!

922
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,585
[grunts]

923
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,547
But that was before I met you.

924
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,965
You don't know me, Puss.

925
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,760
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm all about the score.

926
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,971
Come on. Look me in the eyes

927
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,849
and tell me all you
care about is the gold.

928
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,936
- Puss...
- Kitty...

929
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,396
- [peeps]
- Oh, my God!

930
00:55:58,564 --> 00:55:59,981
[both hissing]

931
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,608
[laughing] New partners!

932
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,278
[hushed] Do not fall
for his animal magnetism.

933
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,529
You stay focused.

934
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:08,781
- Ah!
- What?!

935
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,200
[Kitty giggles]

936
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,829
[rhythmic clanking]

937
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,626
[clears throat] So... I have
been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

938
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,589
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

939
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,257
...together.

940
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,511
Puss, you have to go, now.

941
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,097
You do not have to push me away anymore.

942
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,224
- You can trust me.
- But...

943
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,143
Give it up for the legends
of San Ricardo,

944
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,604
Humpty and Puss! We did it!

945
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,731
[laughing]

946
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:45,318
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty! Stay up with us.

947
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,280
No, I feel a... [coughs]
hairball coming on.

948
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,992
OK, yeah.
Have fun with that!

949
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,202
We should give her some privacy.

950
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,249
I never thought we would get to here.

951
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,878
After all we went through...

952
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,380
...to pull this off, together.

953
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,593
It is good to have my brother back.

954
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,263
Yep. Sure is.

955
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,933
[yawns] Well, we have
a big day tomorrow.

956
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,186
[grunts] Pretty exciting stuff.

957
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,729
We should get some rest.

958
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,609
- Good night, Humpty.
- [quacking, cooing]

959
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,574
- Canasta!
- [thumps]

960
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,376
[cawing]

961
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,309
[groans]

962
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:03,980
[squawks]

963
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,024
[screams] I am still alive!

964
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,026
[cawing]

965
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,195
[gasps]

966
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,448
Jack and Jill.

967
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,742
Kitty?

968
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:18,577
Humpty?

969
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,790
I will find you.

970
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,709
[caws]

971
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,338
- Get out of here!
- [squawks]

972
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,813
- [grunts]
- [whinnies]

973
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,953
[horse nickers]

974
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,126
[sighs]

975
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,173
[grunting]

976
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,635
Huh?

977
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,223
[grunting]

978
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,435
Be gone!

979
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,482
[Humpty] What do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

980
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,485
[Jill laughs]
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

981
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,278
[Jack chuckling] With our own gold.

982
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,405
[Jill] Come on now, all we want
is a little breakfast.

983
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,740
[Humpty] No, no, please!

984
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,575
[Jack] How do you like
your eggs, pumpkin?

985
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,160
Humpty, no!

986
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,829
[Humpty screams]

987
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,373
[cackles]

988
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,085
[sighs] Hello, Puss.

989
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,878
[all] Surprise!

990
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,005
[laughing]

991
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,132
What is going on?

992
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,303
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

993
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,056
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

994
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,682
You were in cahoots?!

995
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,310
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

996
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:13,526
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

997
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,529
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

998
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:21,033
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

999
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,663
This little adventure
was about one thing.

1000
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,957
Revenge.

1001
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:35,131
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there. [echoing]

1002
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:59,029
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

1003
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,116
- Why would you do this?
- You left me on that bridge!

1004
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,368
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

1005
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:07,163
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

1006
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,415
Well, now you're finally
gonna know what it feels like,

1007
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,334
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

1008
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,295
Guards!

1009
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:19,258
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

1010
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,427
Consider this the final
meeting of Bean Club.

1011
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,180
- I should scramble you with onions!
- [shrieks]

1012
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,765
You should never have come back.

1013
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,353
- [growls]
- [Imelda] ¡Pequeño! Wait.

1014
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,647
Do not fight them, please.

1015
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,609
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

1016
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:41,197
No. Puss, no more running.

1017
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:45,492
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

1018
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,289
I'm sorry, Mama.

1019
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,042
I let you down.

1020
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,922
Paws where we can see them!

1021
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,091
Turn around... slow.

1022
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,762
Slower!

1023
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,521
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

1024
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,906
Attention! Attention, everyone!

1025
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,283
If you could just come in
a little closer.

1026
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,993
Ladies and gentlemen,

1027
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,497
I present to you...
the Golden Goose of legend!

1028
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,208
- [peeping]
- [crowd gasping, chattering]

1029
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,630
Kitty. Not you, too?

1030
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,845
[Humpty laughs] Gold for everyone!

1031
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,431
Boo! Boo! Boo! [cackles]

1032
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,226
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

1033
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:56,689
Step right up! Get it hot!

1034
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,191
[crowd] ¡Huevos! ¡Huevos! ¡Huevos!

1035
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,617
One hat.

1036
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,911
One belt.

1037
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,330
And two boots...

1038
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,292
...once a symbol of honor.

1039
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,254
One bottle of catnip?

1040
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:23,424
Uh... it is for my glaucoma.

1041
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,552
- [yowls]
- [door slams]

1042
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,597
This is where you belong, outlaw.

1043
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:35,477
And this is
where you will stay... forever.

1044
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,526
[sighs]

1045
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,453
- [man] Whoo-hoo!
- [shrieks]

1046
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,539
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

1047
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:11,764
Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

1048
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,724
You're talking about Humpty?

1049
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,476
[babbles] Don't say his name!

1050
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:19,229
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

1051
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,441
Happiest day of my life was
when he left.

1052
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,194
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

1053
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,405
Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

1054
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,450
- [snores]
- Hey! What's your name?

1055
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,161
[screams] Andy Beanstalk!

1056
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,246
My friends call me Jack.

1057
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,625
I traded the family cow for them beans.

1058
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,627
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

1059
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,797
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

1060
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:49,051
Always know which cow is yours.

1061
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,512
- [snores]
- Crazy man. Wake up!

1062
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,264
- [gasps]
- What else do you know?

1063
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:58,352
We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

1064
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:03,565
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

1065
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,943
Don't take the goose. Why?

1066
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:08,070
- [snores]
- [groans]

1067
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:13,450
[gasps] The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

1068
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,868
Oh, no.

1069
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,704
And she will be out for blood

1070
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:21,375
when she comes back for her baby.

1071
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,960
[gasps] Guard!

1072
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:26,213
San Ricardo is in terrible danger!
You must listen to me!

1073
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,381
Quiet, you!

1074
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,354
[Puss yowling]

1075
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,609
[yowling continuing]

1076
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,323
[groans] Shut up.

1077
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:58,454
- [yowling]
- [groans angrily]

1078
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:04,668
- Shh!
- [growls]

1079
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,339
- [purring]
- [gasps]

1080
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,093
Open the door.

1081
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,060
Drop the weapon.

1082
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,189
Very good.

1083
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,524
Step aside.

1084
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,860
No. [grunts]

1085
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,653
- Diablo Gato!
- [gasps]

1086
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,656
Nice try. [snickers]

1087
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,117
[muffled scream]

1088
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,578
Huh?

1089
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,545
I hope you can forgive me.

1090
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,173
Apology accepted!

1091
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,551
I don't really have time for you.

1092
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,803
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

1093
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,847
Wait, Puss!

1094
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,016
Don't you see? I'm here because...

1095
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,520
I am here because you made me realize

1096
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,232
that there is something
I care about more than gold.

1097
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,651
Something?

1098
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,987
OK. Someone.

1099
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,698
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

1100
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,325
Handsome?

1101
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,494
He's very handsome.

1102
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,579
- A real beefcake?
- Mm-hm.

1103
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,039
- A stallion?
- Yes.

1104
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,958
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

1105
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,211
[chuckles] But this
does not make us even.

1106
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,464
- Freeze!
- Yes, it does.

1107
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,424
- No, no, no, it doesn't.
- [whimpers]

1108
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,301
[both yowling]

1109
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,011
[screams]

1110
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:39,846
I saved you!

1111
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,182
You owed me one.

1112
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,810
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

1113
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,522
So now you owe me two.

1114
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,026
[guards shouting]

1115
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,821
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

1116
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,614
Ha-ha!

1117
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,869
You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

1118
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,038
Wrong boots.

1119
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,124
Kitty!

1120
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,501
Now we're even! [yowls]

1121
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,970
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

1122
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,848
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

1123
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,975
...one hundred percent.

1124
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,566
[Puss] Never alone, always together...

1125
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:33,984
[Humpty] Humpty and Puss...

1126
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,736
[both] Brothers forever.

1127
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,447
- [sighs]
- [peeping]

1128
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,157
Come on, sweetie.

1129
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,576
Let's, uh, get out of here
before Mama shows up.

1130
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,830
I should make you
into an egg salad sandwich!

1131
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,583
[shrieks] That is disgusting!

1132
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:53,253
- Give me the goose, Humpty.
- No can do, I'm afraid.

1133
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,297
See, the mama's on her way,
and when she gets here,

1134
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:59,343
it's bye-bye San Ricardo and
everything you ever cared about!

1135
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:03,930
[scoffs] Revenge on me is one thing,
but why Imelda? Why the orphanage?

1136
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,724
This is our home.

1137
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,726
You mean your home.

1138
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:12,022
[sighs] I never belonged here.

1139
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,565
We had a plan to get out of here,

1140
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,777
but then you became a hero and
you picked this place over me.

1141
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:17,944
[sighs]

1142
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,031
You left me with nothing.

1143
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,705
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

1144
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,293
But do not take it out on these people.

1145
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,128
You are better than this!

1146
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,674
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, come on!

1147
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,550
I know the real Humpty.

1148
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:44,846
The way you saw the world!
The inventor! The dreamer!

1149
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,516
What happened to that guy?

1150
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:50,769
[distant roaring]

1151
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,521
[wings flapping]

1152
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,148
I... I think it's too late.

1153
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,609
It is never too late
to do the right thing.

1154
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:00,153
Together we can save San Ricardo!

1155
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,454
I can forgive you, Humpty...
if you help me now.

1156
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,707
Really?

1157
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,292
After everything I put you through?

1158
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,254
Prove to me there is still
a good egg in you.

1159
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,049
I'll try.

1160
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,136
[gasping]

1161
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,513
[thudding]

1162
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:28,056

[roaring]

1172
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:15,479
- Goggles, check.
- Get the baby over the bridge.

1173
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,646
I'll get the mother to follow.

1174
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:20,025
OK. Give me a... [yelling] Puss!

1175
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,198
[snorting, roaring]

1176
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,700
Ha-ha!

1177

1181
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,258
Mama Goose!

1182
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,805
- [crowd screaming]
- Wait!

1183
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:54,226
Just follow me and I will
lead you to your baby.

1184
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,900
- [honking]
- No! Not that way!

1185
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,362
Pequeño, help!

1186
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,988
Hang on!

1187
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,115
[grunts]

1188
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,619
Oh.

1189
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,705
Whoa! [laughs]

1190
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,958
That's my boy!

1191
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:19,835
Ha!

1192
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,465
Come with me, Mama Goose.
I know where your baby is.

1193
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,968

01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,273
Humpty, pick up the pace!

1198
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,775
I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

- [peeping]
- [shrieks]

1200
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,492
Sorry, egghead,
we want more than just eggs.

1201
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,452
So how about you give us that goose!

1202
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,205
- Humpty!
- [yowling]

1203
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,373
- Get her off!
- [gun blast]

1204
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,712

Comandante! Uh, I can explain?

1208
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:21,813
Gato, you are going back to jail
if it's the last thing I do!

1209
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,273
Humpty, hurry!

1210
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:26,610
[Humpty] We're almost there.
We're almost there!

I'm sorry, Puss.

1224

I've made a mess out of everything.

- I'm a rotten egg.
- [grunting]

1226

I'm not a person.

1227

I'm not a bird. I'm not even a food.

1228
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,682
I don't know what I am.

1229
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,227
You are what you have always been.

1230
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,187
My brother.

1231
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,525
Brothers forever.

01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:05,375
- You can't save us both.
- Yes, I can! Just hang on!

1236
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:12,007
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

1237
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,760
It's the right thing to do.

1238
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,891
I will not let you go, Humpty.

1239
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:24,102
I know you won't.

1240
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,397
So I won't make you choose.

1241
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,234
- Humpty!
- [roaring]

1242
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,083
[honking]

1243
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,339
I'm very sorry.

1244
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,091
She's OK.

1245
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,350
Humpty?

1246
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,775
[sighs]

1247
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,157
- [honks]
- [peeps]

1248
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:26,664
I always knew that you were good inside.

1249
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:32,587
- [peeping]
- [honking]

1250
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:34,881
[coos]

1251
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,180
Goodbye, Humpty.

1252
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,149
[children shouting playfully]

1253
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,569
- Yeah, I think it's wonderful...
- And I got a goose egg.

1254
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,321
It's him. Puss In Boots.

1255
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,323
He saved us from the giant goose!

1256
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,408
His sword is like lightning!

1257
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,369
They say he has ten lives.

1258
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:08,414
His boots are made
of the finest Corinthian leather.

1259
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,875
He only drinks whole milk.

1260
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,672
Good leche.

1261
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,134
He's no outlaw. He saved us!

1262
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,845
[Puss] Uh, meow?

1263
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:26,057
A gift for you, Mama.

1264
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,730
I have to go.
The soldiers are coming for me.

1265
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:39,779
- I am so proud of you, my son.
- [purring]

1266
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:44,576
Today, you faced the past
with bravery and honor.

1267
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,412
You earned those boots.

1268
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:52,584
And the people know that you are
San Ricardo's greatest hero.

1269
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,461
I did it for you, Mama.

1270
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,382
You will always be in my heart.

1271
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,759
And you in mine.

1272
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,389
¡Gato! Hmm?

1273
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:09,058
- There he is!
- I see him!

1274
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,394
- [cheering]
- [all] Huh?

1275
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,356
[crowd cheering]

1276
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,112
[Puss] Toot-toot!

1277
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,615
[♪ Lady Gaga: "Americano"]

1278
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,331
[chuckles]

1279
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,175
[Puss] Ha! Ha!

1280
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:45,428
[both chuckling]

1281
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,728
I will see you again, Kitty Softpaws!

1282
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,773
[chuckles] Sooner than you think.

1283
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:00,693
Ah! [groans]

1284
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:06,950
[chuckles] She is a bad kitty.

1285
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,703
[blows kiss]

1286
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:16,459
[Puss] This is the story
of a cat who became a hero.

1287
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:21,130
An outlaw dedicated to justice.
And a lover of beautiful women.

1288
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:24,926
A great... great lover.

1289
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,720
Really. [chuckles] It is crazy.

1290
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:30,640
I am Puss In Boots!

1291
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:35,144
And my name would become... legend!

1292
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,188
- [whinnies]
- Ha-ha!

1293
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:44,570
["Americano" continuing]

1294
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:49,742
Ha! [laughs]

1295
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:54,664
[sighs]

1296
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,417
- [meows]
- [chuckles]

1297
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,086
- [swoons]
- Ha!

1298
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,424
Whoo-hoo!

1299
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,510
- Ha!
- [cats meow]

1300
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:09,637
Meow.

1301
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,725
- [laughing]
- [peeps]

1302
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,397
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1303
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,664
[playful growling]
