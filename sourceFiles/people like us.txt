00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,537
You know when
people are lying

860
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,414

over-invent details.

No, l'm sort of
a facilitator.

00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,521
You're a robot sent from
the future to kill me?

873
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,231
Uh, corporate barter.

874
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,651
You know, barter,
the original form of commerce.

All right, me. Um...

905
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,639
l was just going to ask

906
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,641
if you ever go
to the meeting on Colfax.

907
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,310
No, l just...
l came out from New York.

908

910
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,864
l'm really sorry
about your dad.

911
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,328
That's nice of you to say,
but don't be sorry.

912
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,747
He was a dick.

913
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,375
Why a dick?

914
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,669
Well, he bailed
when l was little.

915
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,671
Pretty much qualifies him
for dick status.

916
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,214
How old were you?

917
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,633

You know
what l love to do

921
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,267

l'm sorry. (STAMMERlNG)
l didn't mean to pry.

My dad died, too, recently,
and, you know,

925
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,700
he wasn't exactly
a gem of a human being, either, so...

No.

maybe even the people
in your own family.

to calm those angry

Ready? First,
accept the way you feel.

Try making a fist
with each hand, and then let go.

Can you feel the difference?

960
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:53,554
Second, find
a soothing activity to distract yourself.

961
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,933
Maybe it's playing
with your favorite toy,

962
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,601

Yeah, well,
what you probably don't remember

the plastic bags in his abdomen

1038

every two hours
so his shit wouldn't leak.

1039

Wow, Mom.

1040

me around, Mom.

Six rules.

And listen up,
because l don't know

1643
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:34,531
if l'm gonna be able to
tell you this again, okay?

1644
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,368
These are from my father.

1645
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,288
Number one.
lf you like something

1646
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,624
because you think
other people are gonna like it,

1647
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,626
it's a sure bet
no one will.

1648
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,588
Number two.
Most doors in the world are closed,

1649
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,466
so if you find one
that you want to get into,

1650
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:54,718
you damn well better have
an interesting knock.

1651
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,763
And if you knock
like you drum, you'll be fine.

1652
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:02,559
Number three.
Everything that you think is important

1653
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,397
isn't.

1654
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:10,067
And everything that
you think is unimportant is.

1655
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:14,405
Number four.
Don't shit where you eat.

1656
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,031
l wasn't planning on it.

1657
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:17,658
He meant that
metaphorically, of course.

1658
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,620
Now, bear in mind
my father was not all that successful.

1659
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:24,498
Number five.
Lean into it.

1660
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:25,749
What does that mean?

1661
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,376
lt means that the outcome
doesn't matter.

1662
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,920
What matters is
that you're there for it.

1663
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,382
Whatever "it" is,
good or bad.

1664
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,884
Kind of like right now.

1665
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,638
And finally, number six,
a personal favorite.

1666
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:42,099
Never sleep with someone who
has more problems than you.

1667
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,350

1669

And my very own.
Always assume your mother's listening.

1670
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:52,943
That is definitely a rule.

1671
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,863
Your mom is
always listening.

1672
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,074

1880
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:10,266
and there you were.

1881
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,727
And l needed the money.
You know?

1882
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:15,146
l was selfish.
l was a coward.

1883
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:20,318
(STAMMERlNG) l was scared of this.
l don't know how to do this.

1884
01:43:22,237 --> 01:43:23,905
We're the only two people
on this planet

1885
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:25,948
that know what it was like
to be his kid.

1886
01:43:26,783 --> 01:43:28,117
You and me.
That's it.

1887
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:30,161
That's like...
lt's, uh...

1888
01:43:30,245 --> 01:43:32,955
lt's a miracle or something.
l mean, it is. lt's a miracle.

1889
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:36,209
How am l ever supposed
to trust you?

1890
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:43,466
Because...

1891
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:47,386
Because we're family.

1892
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:54,727
And families make mistakes,
and l am the king of mistakes.

1893
01:43:59,107 --> 01:44:00,900
l'm asking you
to forgive me.

1894
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:04,153
And l know it's a lot.
l just...

1895
01:44:07,991 --> 01:44:09,367
Let me be your brother.

1896
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:12,036
l am your brother.

1897
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:15,414
l want you
to be my sister.

1898
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:21,254
lt's all l want.

1899
01:44:25,008 --> 01:44:27,009
l left the money
on the table, you know.

1900
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,514
l got all the way
to the elevator and l realized

1901
01:44:37,062 --> 01:44:38,521
l couldn't do it to Josh.

1902
01:44:39,898 --> 01:44:41,190
So l took it.

1903
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,403
He deserves more than
what we had.

1904
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:52,785
l think that l waited
my whole life

1905
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:56,038
for him to come back to me.

1906
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:01,877
He sent you.

1907
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:12,013
He wanted
to come back.

1908
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:31,574
You said he used to
take you on picnics?

1909
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:34,910
Yeah.

1910
01:45:36,538 --> 01:45:39,123
Your mom
kept taking you after he left.

1911
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:41,917
Yeah.

1912
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:46,589
Can l show you
something, please?

1913
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:27,189

(ACOUSTlC ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG)

1916
01:49:04,412 --> 01:49:11,001
l'm taking all
my dreams with me

1917
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:20,469
On a mattress
full of memories

1918
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:29,770
l'm taking all
my dreams with me

1919
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:49,456
And if anyone asks you
where l've been

1920
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:57,339
l've been out having fun
with my friends again

1921
01:49:57,382 --> 01:50:02,261
We're dancing real close
but you can always cut in

1922
01:50:02,345 --> 01:50:06,807
We'll be dancing real close
but you can always cut in

1923
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:12,896
'Cause l signed
on the dotted line

1924
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:21,739
And that mess
on your plate is mine

1925
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:32,708
And l ain't asking you
to trust me

1926
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:36,045
Anymore

1927
01:50:36,087 --> 01:50:40,424
l'm trusting you

1928
01:50:40,508 --> 01:50:44,970
And l say it enough

1929
01:50:55,565 --> 01:50:59,943
We never had a chance

1930
01:51:00,028 --> 01:51:05,240
To watch out for one another

1931
01:51:05,283 --> 01:51:10,079
We both need that

1932
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:14,750
It's hard when a friend
turns their back

1933
01:51:14,834 --> 01:51:19,296
But when you turned around

1934
01:51:19,381 --> 01:51:23,676
l knew l'd finally found

1935
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:29,056
Someone whose heart
beats the same

1936
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:31,558
l don't remember too much

1937
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:38,440
But l remember the day that
l signed on the dotted line

1938
01:51:43,446 --> 01:51:49,660
And that name
next to yours is mine

1939
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:59,962
And l ain't asking you
to trust me

1940
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:03,215
This time

1941
01:52:03,299 --> 01:52:07,511
l'm trusting you

1942
01:52:07,595 --> 01:52:12,516
And l say it enough
