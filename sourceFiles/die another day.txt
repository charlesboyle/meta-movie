<i>Lost all that treasure
in an overseas war</i>

1090
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:33,630
<i>It just goes to show you
don't get what you paid for</i>

1091
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:37,125
<i>Battle to the rich
and you worry about the poor</i>

1092
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:41,088
<i>Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors</i>

1093
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,547
<i>What's that funky noise?</i>

1094
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,601
<i>It's the tightening
of the screws</i>

1095
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:51,769
<i>Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt</i>

1096
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:57,355
<i>All I hear is doom and gloom</i>

1097
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:02,199
<i>But when those drums</i>

1098
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:05,154
<i>Go boom, boom, boom</i>

1099
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:09,536
<i>Through the night</i>

1100
01:37:09,615 --> 01:37:13,165
<i>Your face I see</i>

1101
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:19,384
<i>Baby, take a chance Baby,
won't you dance with me</i>

1102
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:22,670
<i>Yeah!</i>

1103
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:27,308
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>

1104
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,101
<i>Ah, yeah</i>

1105
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:53,668
<i>Fracking deep for oil But
there's nothing in the sump</i>

1106
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:57,373
<i>There's kids all picking
at the garbage dump</i>

1107
01:37:57,455 --> 01:38:01,050
<i>I am running out of water
so I better prime the pump</i>

1108
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:05,301
<i>I am trying to stay sober
but I end up drunk</i>

1109
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:10,136
<i>We'll be eating dirt Living
on the side of the road</i>

1110
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,146
<i>There's some food for thought</i>

1111
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:17,977
<i>Kind of makes your head explode</i>

1112
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,445
<i>Feeling kind of hurt</i>

1113
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:23,277
<i>Yeah!</i>

1114
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:26,360
<i>But all I hear</i>

1115
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:29,283
<i>Is doom and gloom</i>

1116
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:34,751
<i>And all is darkness</i>

1117
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:37,170
<i>In my room</i>

1118
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:40,832
<i>Through the night</i>

1119
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:44,135
<i>Your face I see</i>

1120
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:47,714
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>

1121
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:51,517
<i>Won't you dance with me</i>

1122
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,223
<i>Yeah!</i>

1123
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:54,595
<i>Come on!</i>

1124
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:57,849
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>

1125
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:01,778
<i>I'm feeling kind of hurt</i>

1126
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:04,857
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>

1127
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:07,324
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

1128
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,118
<i>Sitting in the dirt</i>

1129
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:13,198
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>
