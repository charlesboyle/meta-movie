1
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:11,901
Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.

2
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:15,200
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.

3
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:18,289
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass
or a permit or something?

4
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:20,418
Press pass this!

5
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,799
You know, the police missed
something here, I can feel it.

6
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:27,348
What do you say, Billy? Won't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...

7
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,280
Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
Yeah, man, speed up.

8
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:00,537
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.

9
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:02,166
Holy shit!

10
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,461
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.

11
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:06,006
You fucking assholes!

12
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,094
We are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!

13
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,682
Yeehaw!

14
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,562
Chad, just cos they're not in your
fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.

15
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:18,029
Actually, it does, Allison. You see,
you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.

16
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,367
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.

17
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:23,414
- Chi, chi, chi!
- I'm in a oar full of morons.

18
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,671
No, if we were morons,
we wouldn't have thought to bring this.

19
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:29,885
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.

20
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:32,516
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.

21
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:33,935
Oh, jeez. Whoa, Jesus.

22
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:46,209
Did you see the way
those guys looked at us?

23
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,672
Hey, guys! Guys!

24
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,011
We forgot the beer!

25
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,764
No!

26
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:34,301
Sure you got everything
you need? Cos once you get up there...

27
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:43,194
Can I help you?

28
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,909
Uh, yeah. Where's your beer at?

29
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,790
Beer's in the back.

30
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,055
You see the way them kids looked?

31
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:05,737
Read that list back to me.
OK, three-quarter-inch nails,

32
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:09,035
hacksaw, baling hooks,

33
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:12,584
brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...

34
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,421
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...

35
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:17,009
- "crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?

36
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:19,347
- lubricated condoms...
- Chad?

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,849
Hand drill...

38
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:29,700
_.feminine napkins,
stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...

39
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,330
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.

40
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:36,798
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.

41
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:47,402
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.

42
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:53,203
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever
seen anything like that in your life?

43
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:57,379
There's nothing so special about them.

44
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:01,762
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.

45
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,390
You know something, Dale?

46
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,895
She's just human. Why don't you
go over there and talk to her?

47
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:09,319
Talk to her? What?
What in the world would I say?

48
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,620
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation home.
That'll probably impress her.

49
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:17,335
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.

50
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:20,799
They grew up with vacation homes,
and guys like me fixing their toilets.

51
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:24,013
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.

52
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,977
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man...

53
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,439
more or less.

54
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,816
You got a damn good heart.

55
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,445
Yup.

56
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:34,993
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.

57
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:37,038
What's the worst that could happen?

58
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:41,089
You know something?

59
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:46,139
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

60
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:48,560
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.

61
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:53,070
All right, now, whatever you say,
just smile and laugh.

62
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:54,656
It shows confidence.

63
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,912
Smile and laugh. OK.

64
00:04:58,872 --> 00:04:59,958
- Do it.
- All right.

65
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:18,660
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?

66
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:27,010
Hey! Hey. Now, look...
we don't want any trouble, all right?

67
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:28,847
- So just...back off.
- Whoa!

68
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,350
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!

69
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,274
Get in the truck.

70
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:39,951
That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...

71
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:52,976
I told you, Tucker.
I'm a zero with the ladies.

72
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,234
They hate my face!

73
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,153
Come on.

74
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:09,050
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the ladyfolk the way you can.

75
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,596
No one can. I mean, I...

76
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:15,770
I always get all stupid, and my hands get
clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.

77
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:19,528
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.

78
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,115
No, I don't.

79
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:22,826
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

80
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:26,166
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.

81
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:27,543
Mm-hm.

82
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:30,967
Cos it sure as hell
ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.

83
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,636
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.

84
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:35,142
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. We got a cop.

85
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:36,728
Oh, I got you.

86
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,985
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.

87
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:41,988
All right, he's pulling over.

88
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:44,201
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.

89
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:46,914
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.

90
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,292
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...

91
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,923
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.

92
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,759
He's out of his car?
He's coming.

93
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,554
- Tucker!
- Get it...

94
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,774
Yeah.

95
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,283
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.

96
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,915
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,000
License, please.

98
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:14,885
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.

99
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:19,017
Temporary.

100
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,688
Where you two headed?

101
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:23,987
We're headed to our vacation home
up by Morris Lake.

102
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:28,035
I sank every penny I had into it.

103
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:31,584
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix
'er up, maybe do a little fishin'.

104
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,548
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.

105
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,471
I figured a little man time
might do him some good.

106
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:44,400
There ain't nothing up there but pain and
suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.

107
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:51,121
I pulled you over cos
you got a broken turn signal.

108
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:52,833
Oh, yes, sir.

109
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,671
See that you, uh...

110
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,262
get that fixed.

111
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,266
That was very helpful.

112
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,035
- Man, that was tense.
- That dude's weird.

113
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:12,329
There he goes.

114
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,500
Bye _

115
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:18,257
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?

116
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,264
He was jealous because
he can't afford a place of his own.

117
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,560
Ah. Well...

118
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:27,066
Here's to the good life, huh?

119
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:31,449
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.

120
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:50,569
I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!

121
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:53,409
I know, I know.
Is that ours?

122
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,413
Wow. And another one right there.

123
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,700
Oh, my God.

124
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:17,914
It's perfect!

125
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,795
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:24,678
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.

127
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:27,934
I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!

128
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,205
- Well, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!

129
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:54,234
Whoever used to live here must have been
an archaeologist or something.

130
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:57,031
Yeah, archae... Yeah.

131
00:09:57,072 --> 00:10:00,246
Look at this.
Must have been a real news junkie, too.

132
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:12,311
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.

133
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:15,609
- All right.
- Score!

134
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:19,617
Tucker, look! They got my favourite
board game here, too.

135
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:23,375
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.

136
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,965
I cannot believe that I am standing
in my own vacation home right now.

137
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,218
You know something?

138
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,642
Dreams really do come true.

139
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:33,936
Look out!

140
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,361
- Whoa!
- Well, I guess we should fix that.

141
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,657
Yeah, that's a good idea.

142
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,206
You can get off me now.

143
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:47,796
If you have a reoccurring dream about sucking
a dick but never do it, are you gay?

144
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,382
- Yes.
- Really?

145
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:50,592
- Guys!
- Are you serious?

146
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:53,099
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?

147
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:55,394
No!
Chuck, no.

148
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:57,273
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.

149
00:10:57,314 --> 00:11:00,362
- You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.

150
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:04,579
Now, do you fuckers
want to hear a real story? Huh?

151
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:12,969
This story happened right here,
right in these very woods.

152
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,437
It was 20 years ago today.

153
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:25,202
The Memorial Day Massacre.

154
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:30,670
How a bunch of college kids...
just like us...

155
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:33,425
they came out here to have a good time...

156
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:41,191
but little did they know that they weren't
the only ones in these here woods.

157
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,071
Pump Up The Jam)

158
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:46,743
Pump it up
While your feet are stompin'.

159
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:48,747
And the jam is pumpin'...

160
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,129
J' Pump it up a little more.

161
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,633
J* Get the party going on the dance Hoof.

162
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:57,138
J' See, cos that's where the...

163
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,560
Get another one! Come on!

164
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:02,399
J' I'm gonna meet my maker.

165
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:05,070
J' I ain't afraid to die.

166
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:09,455
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.

167
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,751
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.

168
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:55,042
Only one person lived to tell this story.

169
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:58,590
The rest of them just disappeared...

170
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,807
and their bodies are buried beneath us.

171
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:08,568
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.

172
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:10,697
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

173
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:13,243
- I do.
- Yeah.

174
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:16,625
- All right.
- I'm not getting naked.

175
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:27,772
Uh... That's OK, Tuck.

176
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:29,609
You take that. That's yours.

177
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:33,282
That's why you're never gonna
get ahead in life.

178
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:36,038
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.

179
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,881
Do not even think about it.

180
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:43,385
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?

181
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,598
- OW!
- Are you serious?

182
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,604
What'd I just say?

183
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:52,319
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.

184
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,989
That was the last thing I said.

185
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,297
Hello?

186
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,804
Is someone there?

187
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,807
Guys?

188
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:13,986
Yargh!

189
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:16,908
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?

190
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,955
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.

191
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:21,459
No, it wasn't.

192
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:24,006
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.

193
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,968
You totally freaked me out.

194
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:29,933
You know, you can drop the act now.

195
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:33,983
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.

196
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:37,364
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.

197
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:40,579
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.

198
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:44,378
I mean, you are better than everyone else.

199
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,676
You and I, Allie...

200
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:51,391
are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?

201
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,523
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...

202
00:14:56,693 --> 00:15:00,367
I'm glad that we have this chance
to get to know each other better.

203
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:05,211
Chad, you're drunk.

204
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,675
That's a good thing.
It lowers my inhibitions.

205
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:11,764
OK, uh...

206
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:14,102
- Come on, stop.
- Why?

207
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:15,854
Why? Why stop?

208
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,570
We're perfect for each other.

209
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:24,330
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.

210
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,417
Come on, Allie. Come on...

211
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:31,761
Oh, it's so cold!
Here we go!

212
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,602
What's that all about?

213
00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:40,445
I don't know,
but I think we should go check it out.

214
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,657
No. No, Tuck, you know what?

215
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,579
My guess would be that they
don't really want to see us right now.

216
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:49,338
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.

217
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,009
What the hell are you doing?

218
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:56,183
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?

219
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:58,772
I'm not gonna go around
one more time with you on this.

220
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:00,651
- OK.
- Hush.

221
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:05,159
Whoo-hoo! I love camping!

222
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:08,707
Look.

223
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:14,093
Oh.

224
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,647
- Tucker!
- Shush!

225
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,911
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?

226
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,581
Me? What did I do?

227
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,879
When you see a college girl prancing
around in front of you half-naked,

228
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:37,346
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.

229
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:40,059
You are hopeless,
do you know that? You're hopeless.

230
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,152
She didn't come up yet.

231
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:47,742
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.

232
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:52,917
Hey! Lady?

233
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,758
Hey, lady!

234
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,681
- Where'd she go, Tuck?
- Whoa, whoa, Dale!

235
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:06,445
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!

236
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,740
Get her legs!

237
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:11,329
Oh! No!

238
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:14,334
- Hey, we got your friend!
- Oh, God!

239
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:17,966
They got Allison! Come on!

240
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,098
Hey!

241
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:25,021
We got your friend! Why the hell
are they running away? Hey!

242
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,904
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her
back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.

243
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:31,535
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

244
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,999
Shit.

245
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,754
Chad! Chad!

246
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:39,968
The hillbillies...

247
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,222
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!

248
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:44,183
They captured Allison!

249
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,372
Allie!

250
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:31,024
Oh, God! No.

251
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:35,324
- No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.

252
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,743
Please don't cut me open!

253
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,297
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...

254
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,386
Doesn't like pancakes.

255
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:48,767
Should have asked her if she liked
pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!

256
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:52,315
Pa... Pancakes?

257
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:56,574
Allison!

258
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:58,786
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?

259
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:02,501
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?

260
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,547
Chuck, tell him what you saw.

261
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:08,013
Well, it was really dark,
but it looked like one of the guys was...

262
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:09,974
like...eating her face off.

263
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:13,022
That is so disgusting.

264
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:15,193
Not to sound too cliché,
but shouldn't we go to the police?

265
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,862
And just leave Allison with them?

266
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:18,867
If they already ate her,
what difference does it make?

267
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,248
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.

268
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:26,380
What if I go? It's my dad's truck.
He told me I was the only one allowed to drive it.

269
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,301
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.

270
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:31,265
OK, awesome.
I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.

271
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:34,730
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?

272
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:45,877
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.

273
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:51,806
What is this place?

274
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:55,312
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.

275
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:58,442
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
go in there and talk to them?

276
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,446
All right. Maybe I will.

277
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,290
I said maybe.

278
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:31,381
There you go. Please don't tell me
that you hate eggs and bacon.

279
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,058
Wha-What am I doing here?

280
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:39,356
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...

281
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:42,027
Well, me and Tucker...

282
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:44,365
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...

283
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:46,118
Well...

284
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:51,963
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?

285
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,885
Because you were about
to go swimming with your friends,

286
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,849
and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks,
and you fell and banged your head

287
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,354
and then you fell into the water,
and then...

288
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:02,858
I dove in and rescued you.

289
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:08,453
- Wait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!

290
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:10,708
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.

291
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,462
We were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... We didn't see...

292
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:16,427
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...

293
00:21:16,468 --> 00:21:17,971
Where are my friends?

294
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:22,105
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?

295
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,442
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.

296
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,656
Some people just aren't
any good in a crisis,

297
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:30,580
and that's why Tucker and I brung you here,

298
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,418
hoping that they would
come get you in the morning.

299
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:38,427
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...

300
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:40,348
it's OK, I...

301
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:42,811
I never really had much fashion sense,
anyway.

302
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:45,232
- Me neither.
- Yeah.

303
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:51,913
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean,
but he's just a big old marshmallow.

304
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:54,083
You can just pet him round the nose.

305
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,253
- He's drooling.
- I know.

306
00:21:57,214 --> 00:22:01,304
Anyway, um...I'm sorry
about all the mess around here.

307
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:04,436
Tucker just bought this place,
and, uh...you know...

308
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:09,028
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much
to a high-class girl like you,

309
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:13,746
but we've always just had sort of
a dream to have our own vacation home.

310
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,459
But, uh...anyway...

311
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,384
you should relax and rest, OK?

312
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,930
Hey, what's...
what's your name?

313
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:24,642
Uh...

314
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:27,565
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...

315
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:31,029
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.

316
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:33,241
But my...
my friends call me Allie.

317
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:37,292
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
Allie...son.

318
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:40,505
And if you need anything else,
you just holler for me.

319
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,509
I'll be right in the little room here.

320
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:46,852
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.

321
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:50,066
Do you guys have
anything to do around here?

322
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,694
Do you like board games?

323
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:55,743
What kind do you have?

324
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,252
We got this one right here.
It's my favourite. Trivi-Up.

325
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,136
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.

326
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:06,973
No way, dude. You lost.

327
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,815
Just shut up and walk, bitch.

328
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:26,094
Goddamn Romeo.

329
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,184
Oh, well.

330
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,802
Oh, Jesus.

331
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:05,587
Aargh! Aargh! Argh!

332
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:07,883
Run! Run for your lives!

333
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:10,262
Yargh!

334
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,500
Here we go. Big roll. Five.

335
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,130
One, two, three, four, five.

336
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,884
OK, shoot.

337
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,682
Who was the fifth President
of the United States?

338
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,560
Oh, that's too easy.
That's James Monroe.

339
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:23,237
God, you are right again.
You are killing me.

340
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:25,491
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...

341
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,497
I got this weird brain
where I'm dumb as a stump,

342
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,213
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.

343
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:36,638
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.

344
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,766
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

345
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:42,567
There's a difference
between education and intellect.

346
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,951
Yeah?

347
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:53,713
So, um, what is it that
you study in college?

348
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,967
I'm getting my Bachelor's
degree in psychology.

349
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:58,388
Oh, a Bach... Oh.

350
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:02,980
So, what kind of work
would you do with that?

351
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:05,067
Oh, I don't know. I, um...

352
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,490
I-I have these stupid dreams.

353
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:10,119
Dreams are not stupid.

354
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:17,800
Well, um...I just think that so many of the
major problems and conflicts in the world

355
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,138
are caused by a lack of communication,
you know?

356
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,265
- Yeah.
- And I just...

357
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:24,688
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.

358
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,234
No, don't! Don't!

359
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:30,325
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.

360
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:34,666
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.

361
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:37,548
Yeah, you could have just
pushed that thing right over.

362
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:39,092
Hey, hey.

363
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,721
Oh, my God, Tucker,
what happened to your face?

364
00:26:41,763 --> 00:26:44,059
I sawed into a bees' nest.

365
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,438
Why?

366
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,195
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.

367
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,242
I might have avoided it
if you were out there helping me!

368
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,458
Yeah.

369
00:26:57,877 --> 00:27:00,174
We came out here to work...

370
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:02,637
not sit around playing stupid board games!

371
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:05,601
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.

372
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:08,189
No, that's not true. It was my fault.

373
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:11,906
How about I come over there
and pull those stingers out of your face?

374
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,825
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?

375
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,206
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.

376
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:20,129
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.

377
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,052
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.

378
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:24,262
Hi.

379
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:26,016
I saw your friend out there.

380
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:32,987
He must be allergic to bees or something,
because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.

381
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:36,870
- I should go out there and find them...
- No, no! That's... No!

382
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:40,585
No, you need to rest,
so we'll go find your friends.

383
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,884
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?

384
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:47,306
We'll go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.

385
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:48,851
Ain't that right, Tucker?

386
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,065
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

387
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:55,197
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.

388
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,539
Dale, just...
just be careful, OK?

389
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,835
My friends can be kind of judgmental.

390
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:04,339
I'm gonna let Tucker
do most of the talking, anyway.

391
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:07,470
He can win over just about anybody,
can't you? Real people person.

392
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:13,524
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.

393
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:24,462
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.

394
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:29,722
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
- I can't believe this is happening.

395
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:34,147
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!

396
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:37,820
We gotta get to the road
and try to catch a ride out of here.

397
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:41,536
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?

398
00:28:41,578 --> 00:28:44,918
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.

399
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,881
Survival of the fittest!

400
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:52,182
What are you doing, man?

401
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:53,559
That's my whole face.

402
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:56,022
You have serious issues, you know that?

403
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:59,821
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

404
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,454
And the answer was, "isosceles triangle".
You know what that is?

405
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,499
Is it a triangle?
Yeah.

406
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,670
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.

407
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,219
A smart little college girl like that,
and I was beating the crap out of her.

408
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:12,973
- Dale.
- Yeah?

409
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:15,811
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.

410
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,480
I know. You keep telling me that.

411
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:21,990
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish her
off real quick then we'll get back to work.

412
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:24,119
They're gonna kill her!

413
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:29,378
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.

414
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:32,301
College kids!

415
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:38,271
- College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.

416
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:41,861
- College kids!
- Hey, college kids!

417
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:45,160
College kids!

418
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:46,746
I don't see 'em.

419
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:49,709
They must have run off.

420
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:55,221
Well, hmm... Maybe we could leave
them a note in case they come back.

421
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:56,515
All right. With what?

422
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,606
- Well, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.

423
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:05,281
- My face is as hot as a haemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.

424
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,452
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.

425
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,421
Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot.

426
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:36,717
You think that girl is hot...

427
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,139
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...

428
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:43,397
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.

429
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,150
Whoa.

430
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,571
- What?
- Huh? What?

431
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:50,243
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.

432
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:52,456
They should be by here any minute.

433
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,467
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm digging a shitter hole.

434
00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:00,638
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...

435
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,393
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...

436
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:06,107
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.

437
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:09,489
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!

438
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:13,122
No, no, it's not work for a pretty...
for a girl like you. That's...

439
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,874
Oh.

440
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,047
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.

441
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,466
That's a good rule.

442
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:22,054
Yeah. So I've done this before,
believe it or not.

443
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:23,141
Yeah.

444
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:31,614
You gonna help,
or just stand there staring at me?

445
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:35,205
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.

446
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:36,749
Yeah, yeah.

447
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:40,549
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.

448
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,616
That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.

449
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:55,327
We don't have much time.

450
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,918
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.

451
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:02,966
All right, you guys go around, get the guy
at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.

452
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,146
I'm gonna just chill right here.

453
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:15,241
OK, one more load and we're done.

454
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:19,667
Hey, come on, get out. Here.

455
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:23,674
Now!

456
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:25,886
Huh?

457
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,852
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!

458
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:32,440
Dale!

459
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:41,208
Oh, God!

460
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:20,784
Are you OK?

461
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:27,296
Allison, say something!

462
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:31,680
- Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!

463
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:33,892
You'll never beli... What happened to you?

464
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,400
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?

465
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:42,952
Some kid, he just hucked himself
right into the wood chipper!

466
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:45,456
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!

467
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:48,964
From his shoes and pants, it looked like
it might have been one of the college kids.

468
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:50,717
What the hell happened to her?

469
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:53,848
She got knocked out and fell
in the shitter hole right next to me.

470
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:55,726
Is that your blood?
What? No.

471
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,108
No, it's college kid blood. One of them
suckers came running out of nowhere,

472
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,529
speared himself through the gut
and died right on top of me!

473
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:03,491
- Holy crap.
- I know!

474
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:04,785
Calm down. Don't cry.

475
00:34:04,827 --> 00:34:05,871
- Calm down!
- OK.

476
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:08,293
Get a hold of yourself!

477
00:34:10,672 --> 00:34:14,095
All right...
I know what this is.

478
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,142
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.

479
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,230
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,

480
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:23,112
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.

481
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:25,785
Holy shit. We have got to hide
all of the sharp objects!

482
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:28,831
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.

483
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:30,836
Yeah. Think about it.

484
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,802
That's why they acted so funny after
we saved her, because they want her dead.

485
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:39,435
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

486
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,776
It's good that you and I don't know -
if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.

487
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:44,696
Yeah, that's a good point.

488
00:34:44,738 --> 00:34:47,284
OK, so what... what do we...

489
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:49,706
We go to the police?

490
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,501
- Call the police?
- Yeah.

491
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:55,341
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.

492
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:57,637
That's a good idea, Dale.

493
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:01,937
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
We've had a doozy of a day.

494
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:05,319
"There we were, minding our own business,
doing some chores around the house,

495
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:07,699
"when kids started killing themselves
all over my property."

496
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:09,493
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!

497
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:12,708
You would have to be a moron
to believe that, Dale.

498
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,967
It doesn't matter what happened. What
matters is what looks like what happened.

499
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:21,141
And what looks like what happened...
is pretty nasty.

500
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:22,978
So what the hell do we do?

501
00:35:24,314 --> 00:35:26,276
We gotta clean this mess up.

502
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:29,574
- Right now.
- OK.

503
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:35,586
You shouldn't be smoking anyway, Chloe.

504
00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:36,671
It's not good for you.

505
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:38,717
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either,

506
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:41,639
but that doesn't
seem to be stopping anybody!

507
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,312
We gotta get out of here. I mean,
what the hell are we still doing here?

508
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:47,150
How are we gonna get outta here?

509
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:49,655
Dickwad over here sent Chuck off
with the truck!

510
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:51,157
Well, then let's walk.

511
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,412
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that

512
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:56,334
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- Will y'all just shut up?

513
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,714
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?

514
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,511
We never should've come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?

515
00:36:01,553 --> 00:36:02,596
Chad!

516
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:09,652
You guys are all a bunch of
fucking pussies, you know that?

517
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:13,617
I mean, a few little tiny murders...

518
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:15,872
and everyone just freaks out.

519
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:19,337
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?

520
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:23,386
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?

521
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:27,436
How many people do you think
get a chance for something like this?

522
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:31,779
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.

523
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,328
To be free from people always
telling you what you can and can't do.

524
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:39,876
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.

525
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:44,260
And if you don't think
you can handle that, well...

526
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:47,517
maybe you deserve to die.

527
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,652
That's fucked up.

528
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:57,536
Shh. Y'all hear that?

529
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:00,291
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!

530
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,921
No, you don't need the fucking cops!

531
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:05,218
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.

532
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:10,269
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?

533
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,398
Fuck.

534
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,998
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.

535
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,544
Probably just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

536
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:25,299
Oh, God! Look out!

537
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,552
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?

538
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:28,847
They're dead!

539
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:30,308
They died!

540
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,144
Slow down, now.

541
00:37:32,227 --> 00:37:34,440
- They killed them!
- OK.

542
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:40,368
Stay calm. Well, why don't you kids climb
in the back seat, and we'll go have a look?

543
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,171
Those stupid fucks.

544
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,606
I don't think
I have the stomach for this, Tuck.

545
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,905
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.

546
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:03,914
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.

547
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:07,712
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from
that side, and you pull him out on three.

548
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:08,923
- OK.
- All right?

549
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:13,057
One. Two. Three!

550
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:14,476
Argh!

551
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,483
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.

552
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,740
Get it off me. Not on the face!

553
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:24,620
Oh! I'm gonna barf.

554
00:38:25,915 --> 00:38:27,877
You're OK, you're OK.

555
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:30,716
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.

556
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:31,969
Get him over to the truck.

557
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,728
Oh, God. Oh, God.

558
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:38,982
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.

559
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:47,457
Oh, shit.

560
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:54,596
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.

561
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:58,353
You kids stay put.

562
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,360
I'll handle this.

563
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,327
Hey.
Hello, Officer.

564
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,372
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.

565
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:14,091
- We have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.

566
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:17,640
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.

567
00:39:17,682 --> 00:39:19,936
- minding our own business...
- Yup.

568
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:22,984
- making improvements to my house...
- The new house.

569
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:25,237
..when, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

570
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:30,081
these kids started killing themselves
all over my property.

571
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:33,628
This one right here, he dove headfirst
right into the wood chipper,

572
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:34,965
the woody right back there.

573
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:40,100
There's another one up over there
who shoved a spear through his gullet.

574
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:41,352
Straight through.

575
00:39:41,394 --> 00:39:44,274
I don't know how much experience
you've had with this,

576
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:47,780
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.

577
00:39:55,921 --> 00:40:00,765
You must think that I'm some
kind of moron to believe a story like that.

578
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:02,435
- No...
- Oh, no.

579
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:05,816
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.

580
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:10,241
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having
trouble understanding something.

581
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,667
- What?
- You say you were just working,

582
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:20,886
when this...kid...ran up and stuffed
his head into that wood chipper?

583
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:22,975
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.

584
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:28,860
And I think maybe they might be trying
to kill the girl that we have inside.

585
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:30,363
- What girl?
- You know what?

586
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:33,829
She can maybe explain
the whole thing if, uh...

587
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,793
if I hadn't have knocked her
unconscious with a shovel.

588
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,297
- That's...
- On accident.

589
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:40,425
On accident.

590
00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:44,766
You've got another one inside,
and you say she's unconscious?

591
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:47,897
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
- That's...

592
00:40:52,322 --> 00:40:54,035
You better show me what you done with her.

593
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,249
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.

594
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,879
Great idea.
Why don't you go and show him?

595
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,425
Wait, where is he going?

596
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:06,183
- No, don't go in there.
- Right this way, Sheriff.

597
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:12,319
What's he doing?

598
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:14,908
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?

599
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:25,094
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.

600
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:29,937
- At least she's not braindead.
- Oh, thank God.

601
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:34,362
I told you boys to stay away from this place,
but you just didn't listen, did you?

602
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:37,785
Now, you're looking at least two counts
of involuntary manslaughter,

603
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:39,915
but you'd be lucky to get that.

604
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:44,172
Officer, do we look like
a couple of psycho killers to you?

605
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,225
Well, it's...
it's hard to say.

606
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:51,980
Looks can be deceiving.

607
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:53,399
Oh, don't!

608
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:58,993
Sheriff! You OK?

609
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,042
Oh, shit!

610
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,756
Come on!
What is going on?

611
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:09,095
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.

612
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:10,682
He's gonna be fine.

613
00:42:16,652 --> 00:42:18,363
Don't worry, I got it.

614
00:42:20,826 --> 00:42:22,915
It's Sher... Sher...

615
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,630
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!

616
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:28,634
Unlock the door!

617
00:42:29,844 --> 00:42:33,560
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!

618
00:42:33,602 --> 00:42:37,442
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.

619
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:40,990
In there playing board games
with that little girl when I'm out working!

620
00:42:48,714 --> 00:42:50,676
Unlock the fucking door!

621
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:54,558
If you hadn't been playing
board games with that little girl inside,

622
00:42:54,642 --> 00:42:57,565
we would have had
a little more time to fix the beam!

623
00:42:57,648 --> 00:42:58,733
Heads up.

624
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:00,946
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!

625
00:43:03,242 --> 00:43:05,538
Oh, you got to take
the safety off on the side there.

626
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,379
Don't do...

627
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,884
Jesus! Oh, God!

628
00:43:13,428 --> 00:43:15,974
You've got to start being more careful!

629
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:24,700
I don't think he understands!

630
00:43:25,744 --> 00:43:27,288
Om.

631
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,293
"You gotta take the safety off"?

632
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:34,886
You're something, Dale. None of this
would have happened if it wasn't for you!

633
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:36,348
- What?
- That's right!

634
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:39,813
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.

635
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:44,572
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- Well, at least she's still alive.

636
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:47,702
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-lujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!

637
00:43:47,744 --> 00:43:51,085
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!

638
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,671
Well, you know what, Tucker?

639
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:56,762
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't have gone fishin'!

640
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:59,559
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!

641
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,104
You don't like...

642
00:44:03,316 --> 00:44:06,781
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...

643
00:44:06,823 --> 00:44:08,994
I like... I like it OK.

644
00:44:09,035 --> 00:44:11,331
You know... I'm sorry.

645
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:15,214
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

646
00:44:16,843 --> 00:44:18,971
Yeah, you kinda did.

647
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:21,435
Cut it out!

648
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:26,236
Tucker...

649
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:28,949
where's Jangers?

650
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:33,959
- Shit.
- Stay here.

651
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:36,130
Aah! Damn.

652
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,093
Nuts...

653
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:43,310
Hey, hillbilly! Your move.

654
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,980
Oh, son of a bitch!

655
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:47,485
- They got my dog.
- Shit!

656
00:44:47,526 --> 00:44:49,739
We gotta do something.

657
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:53,371
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?

658
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,129
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!

659
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:05,185
Oh.

660
00:45:05,227 --> 00:45:07,023
All right.

661
00:45:08,025 --> 00:45:10,196
- Cover me.
- Uh...

662
00:45:10,238 --> 00:45:12,366
I ain't never shot at nobody before.

663
00:45:13,326 --> 00:45:17,334
If it helps,
think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.

664
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:19,088
Whoa!

665
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:23,388
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

666
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,516
Now, you create a distraction.

667
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,898
I'm gonna go out the back door.

668
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,278
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.

669
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,488
Try not to shoot me.

670
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:35,494
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.

671
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:39,335
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.

672
00:45:41,923 --> 00:45:44,470
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?

673
00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:09,309
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?

674
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:13,109
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks!

675
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:19,246
Shit!

676
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:31,185
Jesus, Dale.
Take it easy.

677
00:46:31,227 --> 00:46:32,313
Hey, hillbilly!

678
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:37,072
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!

679
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:41,873
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!

680
00:46:41,914 --> 00:46:43,208
Then bring out the girl!

681
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:50,139
I'm gonna shoot your dog!

682
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:51,725
I'm gonna get really mad!

683
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,311
I'll get really mad!

684
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,530
Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!

685
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,125
Oh!

686
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,506
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?

687
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,087
Oh, God. Please, no.

688
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,064
Are we done yet?

689
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:24,530
I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.

690
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:27,118
All right...trap's set.

691
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,668
Hey...he's awake.

692
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:37,680
What the hell is wrong with you kids?

693
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:40,309
What is the matter with us?

694
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,520
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.

695
00:48:41,562 --> 00:48:43,566
Wait. Stop...

696
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,161
I've never stood so close
to pure evil before.

697
00:48:54,753 --> 00:48:59,054
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...

698
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:00,682
OK! Don't...

699
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:05,483
No, look, I know you kids are having fun,
but I am not a thrill-seeker!

700
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:08,323
It's payback time, hillbilly.

701
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:13,832
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.

702
00:49:13,874 --> 00:49:15,753
I can get my cooler.

703
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:19,385
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.

704
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:23,059
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!

705
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:26,315
- This is for Mike!
- No!

706
00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:32,869
OW! You prick.

707
00:49:40,092 --> 00:49:41,554
- Dale?
- Allison.

708
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,225
How are you feelin'?

709
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:48,650
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.

710
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:51,864
Wha...

711
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,370
What happ...

712
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:56,206
- What happened?
- Oh...

713
00:49:58,127 --> 00:49:59,296
Well, uh...

714
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:03,011
I can't...
I can't really say.

715
00:50:03,052 --> 00:50:04,139
Um...

716
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:07,812
It was so awful.

717
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:12,279
Oh, my God.
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

718
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:15,076
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.

719
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:17,414
It's good to cry sometimes.

720
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:19,501
It's OK, just...

721
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:21,254
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?

722
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:27,225
There you go. It'll feel better.

723
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:32,693
Come on, just take a deep breath.

724
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,791
There we go. Now...

725
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:42,587
Now tell me what happened.

726
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:47,264
Well...it's hard to say.

727
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:48,516
Um...

728
00:50:50,562 --> 00:50:51,814
Your friends...

729
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,654
Do some of your friends take medication?

730
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:59,245
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.

731
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:04,170
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?

732
00:51:04,254 --> 00:51:08,220
They're out there somewhere right now
tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.

733
00:51:08,262 --> 00:51:10,809
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.

734
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,397
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.

735
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:16,695
It's like all your friends just
decided to go nuts all at the same time.

736
00:51:16,737 --> 00:51:21,078
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and...

737
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,712
and then Todd was running at us, and...

738
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:29,803
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

739
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:32,142
At first I thought they
were trying to kill you,

740
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:37,401
and then they started killing themselves
and then they tried to kill us,

741
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:39,656
and now they're going after my dog...

742
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:41,200
..Jangers.

743
00:51:41,283 --> 00:51:43,413
I guess they just like killing.

744
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:46,878
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.

745
00:51:46,962 --> 00:51:48,674
Jesus, they're here!

746
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:51,929
They're not gonna stop till they kill
all of us, I'm telling you. Hide!

747
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:54,560
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.

748
00:51:54,602 --> 00:51:57,107
- Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.

749
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:59,569
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.

750
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:02,741
- What? No, no.
- It's all just a big misunderstanding.

751
00:52:02,784 --> 00:52:04,705
We'll clear it right up, OK?

752
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,794
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.

753
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:13,387
Oh, my God.

754
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:22,155
- Ugh!
- Allison!

755
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:31,631
Oh!

756
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:44,531
Did you see them?

757
00:52:46,618 --> 00:52:48,956
- No.
- No?

758
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,926
That's from Tucker's shirt.

759
00:52:57,055 --> 00:52:59,102
What is that?

760
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:00,562
Oh, my God!

761
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:03,359
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!

762
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:07,450
There's a note right there.

763
00:53:19,557 --> 00:53:23,523
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"

764
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:28,700
Dale, how...
how long was I out for?

765
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,829
A few hours.

766
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:32,583
I don't understand what...

767
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:34,127
I gotta go help Tucker.

768
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,589
God damn it.

769
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:39,262
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.

770
00:53:39,345 --> 00:53:43,479
- Wait. We don't want to escalate things.
- We don't want to escalate things?

771
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,192
No. They must have thought
you were trying to harm me.

772
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,237
Oh, and why would they think that?

773
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:52,621
I... I don't know.

774
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:54,793
I think you do know.

775
00:53:54,834 --> 00:53:59,384
Well, when we first saw you guys
back at that store...

776
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:03,934
we just thought that you looked...

777
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:05,897
a little creepy.

778
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:09,112
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...

779
00:54:09,153 --> 00:54:11,115
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.

780
00:54:11,156 --> 00:54:13,369
You thought I looked
like some kind of freak.

781
00:54:14,204 --> 00:54:16,209
We misjudged you, Dale. I...

782
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,841
I'm really sorry.

783
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,677
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.

784
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,561
I should have known that if
a guy like me talked to a girl like you,

785
00:54:26,645 --> 00:54:28,232
somebody'd end up dead.

786
00:54:29,192 --> 00:54:31,530
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.

787
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:34,076
If you do see your friends...

788
00:54:34,118 --> 00:54:36,956
tell 'em that I never
wanted to hurt anybody.

789
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:40,672
Dale, Dale, stop. Wait. No...

790
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:41,924
Don't go there.

791
00:54:45,556 --> 00:54:47,477
Oh, shit.

792
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,938
Tucker!

793
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:53,655
Tucker, you cut there?

794
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:02,005
Tuck!

795
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:25,384
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.

796
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:31,478
Tucker!

797
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,151
- Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!

798
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:37,031
Tucker?!

799
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:39,034
Yeah.

800
00:55:39,076 --> 00:55:40,705
Tuck! Tucker!

801
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:44,045
- Dale...
- Hey!

802
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:46,508
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.

803
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:49,096
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.

804
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,515
What?

805
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:52,978
Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!

806
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,480
I don't wanna die! Please!

807
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:58,406
Oh, God! Tucker!

808
00:55:58,448 --> 00:55:59,867
Dale...

809
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:05,879
Oh. Oh... Oh...

810
00:56:06,756 --> 00:56:08,091
I never thought I'd say this,

811
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:09,928
but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.

812
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:13,142
That's funny.

813
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:15,063
Whoa...

814
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:18,487
- Oh...
- Dale...

815
00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:22,118
that kid, he's got some serious issues.

816
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:24,498
I know. Let's get you down from there.

817
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,626
Wait!

818
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:28,047
Sorry about that.

819
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:29,800
This vacation sucks.

820
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:33,014
Come on, let's go.

821
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:53,971
Look at this place.

822
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:59,440
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.

823
00:57:01,904 --> 00:57:03,156
Allison!

824
00:57:03,197 --> 00:57:04,742
- Allison!
- Chad?

825
00:57:05,995 --> 00:57:07,623
- Chad?
- Shh!

826
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:08,875
What are you guys doing?

827
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,795
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.

828
00:57:10,837 --> 00:57:14,052
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.

829
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:16,598
Oh.

830
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,816
This place is really freaky.

831
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:24,530
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?

832
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:26,743
They haven't done anything to me.

833
00:57:26,785 --> 00:57:29,039
Chad, this has all been
a huge misunderstanding.

834
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:33,129
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.

835
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:35,593
What? No, no. Chad...

836
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,681
Chad! Stop.

837
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:40,520
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!

838
00:57:42,064 --> 00:57:45,655
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.

839
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:47,574
You guys have to listen to me, OK?

840
00:57:47,617 --> 00:57:52,208
Tucker and Dale did not mean
to hurt anyone. They're really nice.

841
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,254
You have no idea...

842
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:57,636
what this is all about, do you, Allison?

843
00:57:57,678 --> 00:57:59,473
- Huh?
- No.

844
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:03,981
These freaks are evil...

845
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:07,823
and they deserve everything
that's coming to them.

846
00:58:07,865 --> 00:58:10,035
OK, just relax, all right?

847
00:58:10,076 --> 00:58:13,541
I'm just trying to explain
this is all a big misunderstanding.

848
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,547
Tucker and Dale have been nothing
but gentlemen to me this entire time,

849
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:19,846
- while you guys have been terrorizing them.
- But they started this!

850
00:58:19,888 --> 00:58:22,976
By doing what? Saving my life?

851
00:58:24,062 --> 00:58:27,902
Wait a minute. I remember reading
about this in my sociology class.

852
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:29,615
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

853
00:58:29,657 --> 00:58:32,578
When someone who's been kidnapped
falls in love with their kidnapper.

854
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:36,961
You're falling in love with him?

855
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:39,341
No. W-What?

856
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:43,224
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me...

857
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:48,024
you're not falling in love
with that freak, Allison.

858
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,281
How could you love him?

859
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:55,288
Chad, please. You don't understand.

860
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:58,169
Well, are you or are you not
in love with him?

861
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:00,006
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!

862
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:04,557
Hey! Let the girl go.

863
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:06,060
Tcha!

864
00:59:07,396 --> 00:59:11,236
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?

865
00:59:11,319 --> 00:59:15,453
Wait. Everyone just stop for a second
and let's talk this out, OK?

866
00:59:15,494 --> 00:59:17,874
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.

867
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:20,086
You could have fooled me.

868
00:59:20,128 --> 00:59:22,674
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.

869
00:59:22,717 --> 00:59:25,681
Wait! How about I make some tea,

870
00:59:25,723 --> 00:59:28,603
and we all sit and talk this out?

871
00:59:28,644 --> 00:59:33,195
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.

872
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:35,951
I'm gonna go get a beer.

873
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:39,708
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?

874
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,962
In this chair.

875
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,632
Dale, you...

876
00:59:44,592 --> 00:59:46,388
you sit in this one.

877
00:59:53,902 --> 00:59:56,408
OK, good. Now, um...

878
00:59:57,284 --> 00:59:58,829
I'm gonna get the tea.

879
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:05,591
Is that camomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.

880
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:07,261
It's Earl Grey.

881
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:09,433
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.

882
01:00:11,937 --> 01:00:16,529
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story,

883
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:23,083
and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.

884
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,210
OK?

885
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:27,884
OK.

886
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:30,431
Now, it's important
that we communicate our feelings

887
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:34,397
and understand each ether's perspective
before any progress can be made.

888
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:38,446
OK.

889
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:40,367
Chad, why don't you start?

890
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:45,794
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.

891
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:48,591
A long time ago,

892
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:51,890
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.

893
01:00:51,932 --> 01:00:53,643
This is important.

894
01:00:56,606 --> 01:01:00,489
You see, my parents, they were attacked
by hillbillies just like him.

895
01:01:02,828 --> 01:01:05,207
It was 20 years ago.

896
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,043
The Memorial Day Massacre.

897
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:12,512
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.

898
01:01:13,138 --> 01:01:16,145
My mother ran for her life.

899
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:17,647
But they captured hen.

900
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,626
My father was helpless...

901
01:01:28,668 --> 01:01:32,342
and he didn't even know
that she was pregnant with me yet.

902
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:36,642
And they forced him to watch...

903
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:39,940
while they tortured hen.

904
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:46,076
But my mom, she fought back...

905
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,167
..and she escaped.

906
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:52,673
But my father wasn't so lucky.

907
01:01:57,558 --> 01:01:59,896
His body was never found.

908
01:02:07,243 --> 01:02:09,456
By the time I was born...

909
01:02:09,498 --> 01:02:12,294
my mother was already institutionalized.

910
01:02:13,255 --> 01:02:16,594
I grew up hearing that story
from my grandmother.

911
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:25,821
OK. Um...

912
01:02:27,782 --> 01:02:30,162
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.

913
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:47,321
- No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.

914
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:50,994
Now, Chad said if they were
gone longer than 15 minutes,

915
01:02:51,036 --> 01:02:52,831
we come in, guns blazing.

916
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:57,715
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!

917
01:03:07,485 --> 01:03:13,119
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.

918
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:15,583
No!

919
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,919
No way.

920
01:03:16,962 --> 01:03:19,131
They're fucking trapped.

921
01:03:19,173 --> 01:03:21,594
Oh...yeah.

922
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:24,642
Now, come on, we gotta do something.

923
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,193
It's your turn.

924
01:03:30,404 --> 01:03:32,825
OK, well...

925
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:35,454
First of all...

926
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:41,091
I am really sorry
that your family got massacred.

927
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:43,429
That is awful.

928
01:03:43,554 --> 01:03:47,938
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?

929
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:51,945
I mean, I would have been six years old
at the time, so...

930
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:55,285
It may not have been you,
but it was definitely your kind.

931
01:03:55,327 --> 01:03:59,919
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish,
can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.

932
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:03,300
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.

933
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:05,220
I just can't do it!

934
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:09,438
OK. S-So now that you've both
expressed your side of the story,

935
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,859
how do you feel?

936
01:04:11,901 --> 01:04:14,697
I feel better. I feel...

937
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:16,910
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.

938
01:04:17,912 --> 01:04:21,461
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.

939
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,510
It's show time, freaks!

940
01:04:26,178 --> 01:04:28,391
Jason! No!

941
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:31,855
Jesus Christ!

942
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,243
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?

943
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:40,956
Chad, st...

944
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:42,961
Get him, Tucker!

945
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:45,966
Dale!

946
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,683
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!

947
01:04:51,268 --> 01:04:53,188
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa!

948
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,484
Shit! Chad, what the fuck?

949
01:04:55,526 --> 01:04:57,113
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.

950
01:04:57,155 --> 01:04:58,949
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.

951
01:05:00,578 --> 01:05:01,663
Aargh!

952
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:04,794
Aargh!

953
01:05:04,878 --> 01:05:06,130
Stop, drop, and roll!

954
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:09,553
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!

955
01:05:15,732 --> 01:05:18,028
He's crackling like a log!

956
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,364
Oh, that stinks.

957
01:05:22,203 --> 01:05:24,415
- Oh, shit!
- I knew I shoulda moved that.

958
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,969
Allie, run!
Run!

959
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,055
Come on, let's go!

960
01:05:33,265 --> 01:05:35,269
Help me!

961
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:37,358
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!

962
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:49,172
My cabin.

963
01:05:50,132 --> 01:05:51,677
Your cabin.

964
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,265
I'm a terrible therapist.

965
01:05:54,348 --> 01:05:57,437
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.

966
01:05:57,479 --> 01:05:59,860
I thought you did a great job in there.

967
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:02,029
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

968
01:06:03,282 --> 01:06:06,079
I think we were
on the verge of a breakthrough.

969
01:06:07,498 --> 01:06:09,209
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.

970
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:11,423
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.

971
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:17,642
I think we should go
to the pickup truck right now.

972
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:19,480
Wait. Maybe we should help him.

973
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,824
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.

974
01:06:24,866 --> 01:06:26,744
Get to the truck!

975
01:06:26,786 --> 01:06:29,081
Tucker! Tucker!

976
01:06:30,835 --> 01:06:32,547
He's coming!

977
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:37,139
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!

978
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:39,769
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!

979
01:06:39,811 --> 01:06:41,773
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.

980
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:43,945
This is the only thing I got left.

981
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:46,741
Go.

982
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:55,216
Oh!
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!

983
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:56,802
- Dale, look out!
- Huh?

984
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:14,210
Jangers, not now, boy.

985
01:07:14,294 --> 01:07:17,259
Jangers, hey!

986
01:07:19,095 --> 01:07:20,849
Whoa. Jangers!

987
01:07:22,393 --> 01:07:23,562
Allie.

988
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:25,983
Allison!

989
01:07:27,236 --> 01:07:29,157
Jangers... Allison!

990
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:31,368
She's gone.

991
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:34,082
What the hell... Tucker?

992
01:07:36,921 --> 01:07:40,637
Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...

993
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:43,809
He took her.

994
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,730
I tried to stop him.

995
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:49,279
Whoa, take it easy.

996
01:07:49,321 --> 01:07:50,615
I tell you something, Dale.

997
01:07:50,698 --> 01:07:53,245
It's gonna be a long time
before I take a vacation again.

998
01:07:53,328 --> 01:07:57,210
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.

999
01:07:58,629 --> 01:08:00,050
- Look at you.
- Nah.

1000
01:08:00,092 --> 01:08:03,849
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.

1001
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:06,019
People like me and people like her
just don't mix.

1002
01:08:06,061 --> 01:08:08,231
- That's not true.
- It is true!

1003
01:08:08,274 --> 01:08:11,029
I never should have even
came out here with you.

1004
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:13,242
Listen to me.

1005
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:18,209
Do you remember when we was kids...

1006
01:08:19,378 --> 01:08:21,675
and we used to go catch frogs
down at that creek?

1007
01:08:21,717 --> 01:08:23,720
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

1008
01:08:24,973 --> 01:08:29,147
Remember how we used to compete
to see who could catch more?

1009
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,528
Yeah, but I don't think now's
the time to talk about it, Tucker.

1010
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:37,330
And I used to tell you that I let you catch
more than me because I felt sorry for you.

1011
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:40,293
I remember you used
to let me lick 'em all, too.

1012
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:42,464
That always made me feel kinda funny.

1013
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:44,844
Yeah. Well, the thing is...

1014
01:08:46,263 --> 01:08:48,184
I didn't let you catch more.

1015
01:08:49,144 --> 01:08:51,565
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.

1016
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:53,653
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.

1017
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:59,038
What I'm trying to tell you...
is that you're better than you think you are.

1018
01:09:00,165 --> 01:09:02,544
Listen to me. That girl sees it.

1019
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:07,263
I've seen the way that the two of you
look at each other.

1020
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:11,479
You know, I think that she...

1021
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:14,484
really sees you for who you are.

1022
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:18,367
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done...

1023
01:09:19,577 --> 01:09:20,872
you two can...

1024
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:24,086
_.date or something.

1025
01:09:24,128 --> 01:09:28,220
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

1026
01:09:28,262 --> 01:09:30,056
I don't want any more negativity.

1027
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:32,937
- OK.
- Stop it!

1028
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:35,358
- OK.
- You are a good man.

1029
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,654
You're smart...

1030
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:40,201
and you're strong...

1031
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:43,583
and you're not as ugly
as you think you are.

1032
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:47,798
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.

1033
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,555
- Life is short.
- I know.

1034
01:09:52,266 --> 01:09:55,731
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.

1035
01:09:55,814 --> 01:09:58,569
She needs you now more than ever,

1036
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:03,037
especially cos she's always falling down
and hitting her head, knocking herself out.

1037
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:07,002
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'll know.

1038
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:13,516
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.

1039
01:10:13,557 --> 01:10:16,229
I'll be fine. Go.

1040
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,704
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.

1041
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:28,335
Oh, Jesus!

1042
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:30,047
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.

1043
01:10:30,089 --> 01:10:31,717
OK.

1044
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:35,934
That hurt very much!

1045
01:10:36,018 --> 01:10:38,272
I could tell. Just breathe in.

1046
01:10:38,313 --> 01:10:39,774
Out through your mouth.

1047
01:10:39,816 --> 01:10:41,737
Go get her. Go get her.

1048
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,244
- Do me a favour.
- Anything.

1049
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:48,374
Kick the shit out of that little
college dickhead for me, would you?

1050
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:52,006
I'm gonna shove my boot down
his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?

1051
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:53,551
Come on, Jangers, let's go.

1052
01:11:14,549 --> 01:11:16,720
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.

1053
01:11:16,804 --> 01:11:20,436
OK. (Pants) You gotta let me
take it from here, OK, pup?

1054
01:11:20,478 --> 01:11:23,609
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.

1055
01:11:23,651 --> 01:11:25,655
More or less. OK, stay.

1056
01:11:30,665 --> 01:11:32,292
What is the matter with you?

1057
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,755
What is the matter with me?

1058
01:11:34,797 --> 01:11:39,264
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?

1059
01:11:39,305 --> 01:11:40,350
No.

1060
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,313
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.

1061
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:46,653
Now, I'm willing to forgive you...

1062
01:11:46,695 --> 01:11:48,741
but you're gonna have to beg.

1063
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:50,829
Chad...

1064
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,336
Oh!

1065
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:59,094
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.

1066
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:01,808
You see, we're making up, Allie,

1067
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,896
so you have to be
more passionate than that!

1068
01:12:03,937 --> 01:12:05,523
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.

1069
01:12:05,565 --> 01:12:07,151
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.

1070
01:12:07,193 --> 01:12:08,529
Just stop, please!

1071
01:12:08,571 --> 01:12:11,075
No. I'm not gonna stop.

1072
01:12:11,117 --> 01:12:13,163
I've only just begun.

1073
01:12:37,085 --> 01:12:40,675
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.

1074
01:13:02,967 --> 01:13:04,721
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...

1075
01:13:04,762 --> 01:13:06,182
- It's OK.
- Dale?

1076
01:13:06,223 --> 01:13:07,936
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?

1077
01:13:07,978 --> 01:13:11,317
What? Oh, I thought it might look
kind of intimidating. Does it?

1078
01:13:12,152 --> 01:13:14,198
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

1079
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:18,665
Dale, you wanna...
you wanna help me here?

1080
01:13:18,749 --> 01:13:20,460
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.

1081
01:13:21,795 --> 01:13:22,923
Hang on.

1082
01:13:25,427 --> 01:13:28,725
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.

1083
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:32,024
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anyway, so...

1084
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:41,417
How sweet.

1085
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:46,301
The dim-witted hillbilly
is trying to save the girl of his dreams.

1086
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:47,679
What kind of knot is this?

1087
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,475
You think you're gonna win,
but you're wrong.

1088
01:13:51,436 --> 01:13:54,191
It's time to say goodbye to the girl.

1089
01:13:54,275 --> 01:13:56,404
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.

1090
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,126
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!

1091
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:04,795
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.

1092
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:10,055
- OK, OK.
- Dale!

1093
01:14:10,097 --> 01:14:13,060
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree,
rabbit goes around the tree...

1094
01:14:13,102 --> 01:14:15,149
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!

1095
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:26,880
Oh, that is really too bad.

1096
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:31,472
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...

1097
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:37,692
Dale!

1098
01:14:57,188 --> 01:14:59,526
Dale!

1099
01:15:04,911 --> 01:15:06,330
Dale!

1100
01:15:18,312 --> 01:15:20,567
It's time for you to feel my pain.

1101
01:15:21,777 --> 01:15:23,238
Bring it, frat bitch.

1102
01:15:46,325 --> 01:15:50,374
- Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.

1103
01:15:52,712 --> 01:15:55,635
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!

1104
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,932
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

1105
01:16:01,144 --> 01:16:03,066
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

1106
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:05,779
Put a couple boxes on there.

1107
01:16:05,821 --> 01:16:09,411
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.

1108
01:16:09,452 --> 01:16:11,498
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1109
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:15,089
- OK. OK.
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.

1110
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:18,094
Yeah. What we need to find
is some kind of weapon,

1111
01:16:18,136 --> 01:16:21,559
something preferably big and sharp
so I can stab him!

1112
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,021
Nah! Shit...

1113
01:16:23,062 --> 01:16:26,319
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?

1114
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,404
Or not.

1115
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,089
Oh, my God. Dale?

1116
01:16:37,131 --> 01:16:39,302
- What?
- Come here and look at this.

1117
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:43,560
Look.

1118
01:16:43,602 --> 01:16:45,689
- What?
- Something look familiar?

1119
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:49,489
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.

1120
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:52,828
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.

1121
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:56,042
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.

1122
01:16:56,084 --> 01:16:57,879
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

1123
01:16:57,921 --> 01:17:02,639
And it says here, "The single survivor
leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.

1124
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,396
"The survivor is reported
to have been tortured and raped.

1125
01:17:06,437 --> 01:17:09,151
"She's now undergoing
psychiatric evaluation."

1126
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,370
Think about it. He said his mother
was captured and his father...

1127
01:17:14,412 --> 01:17:16,582
His father's body was never found.

1128
01:17:18,335 --> 01:17:20,090
I think we've just found him.

1129
01:17:20,173 --> 01:17:22,301
Holy S-H-I-T.

1130
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:24,389
Jesus Christ!

1131
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:26,017
Chad!

1132
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:30,316
- Time to die, freak!
- Wait!

1133
01:17:30,358 --> 01:17:31,695
Just wait! Wait, wait!

1134
01:17:31,737 --> 01:17:33,449
Wait, Chad! Wait!

1135
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:35,828
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!

1136
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,497
No! Look!

1137
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:39,585
That's your real father.
Right there!

1138
01:17:40,795 --> 01:17:42,507
No. No!

1139
01:17:42,549 --> 01:17:44,595
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.

1140
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,895
It can't be.

1141
01:17:52,025 --> 01:17:54,072
They lied to me!

1142
01:17:55,574 --> 01:17:57,620
How could they?

1143
01:17:57,661 --> 01:17:59,582
Maybe they didn't want you
to know the truth.

1144
01:17:59,665 --> 01:18:01,460
There is no truth!

1145
01:18:02,128 --> 01:18:04,759
Everything is a lie!

1146
01:18:08,557 --> 01:18:10,978
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.

1147
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,316
- What?
- It's the ingredient in camomile tea

1148
01:18:13,358 --> 01:18:17,826
that causes an anaphylactic reaction in
rare cases where people are allergic to it.

1149
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:19,788
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.

1150
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:22,835
But he'll be OK,
as long as we get him his inhaler.

1151
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:31,727
Or not.

1152
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,293
OK, here we go.
And, you ready?

1153
01:18:44,334 --> 01:18:47,591
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.

1154
01:18:47,632 --> 01:18:50,180
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.

1155
01:18:53,686 --> 01:18:57,903
The chaos and confusion
of what transpired here last night

1156
01:18:57,944 --> 01:18:59,656
is still being unravelled.

1157
01:18:59,698 --> 01:19:02,412
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide

1158
01:19:02,454 --> 01:19:05,919
involving a group of
mentally unstable college kids

1159
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:11,095
may in fact be the work of a lone deranged
killer whose body has yet to be found.

1160
01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:14,977
- The killings happened on the ....
- Knock knock. Hey!

1161
01:19:16,523 --> 01:19:19,903
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling...

1162
01:19:20,613 --> 01:19:22,367
high on prescription medication.

1163
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,621
Yeah, looks like it.

1164
01:19:25,331 --> 01:19:27,167
They found my fingers.

1165
01:19:28,127 --> 01:19:29,547
Check it out.

1166
01:19:29,588 --> 01:19:31,634
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...

1167
01:19:32,971 --> 01:19:35,183
I don't remember that one looking that way.

1168
01:19:35,225 --> 01:19:37,437
Does that look funny to you?

1169
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:38,857
No. No, not really.

1170
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,824
That looks natural. It's good.

1171
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,785
By the way, I brought you something.

1172
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:46,914
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.

1173
01:19:46,956 --> 01:19:48,542
OK, open them.

1174
01:19:49,544 --> 01:19:51,214
Oh...

1175
01:19:51,256 --> 01:19:53,468
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.

1176
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:56,600
That...
that's a thing of beauty.

1177
01:19:56,683 --> 01:19:58,312
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...

1178
01:19:58,353 --> 01:19:59,731
Look what else I got you.

1179
01:19:59,814 --> 01:20:02,569
A bendy straw,
your favourite sipping utensil.

1180
01:20:02,652 --> 01:20:04,656
- - There you go.

1181
01:20:04,698 --> 01:20:07,037
Mmm. Mmm!

1182
01:20:07,078 --> 01:20:10,251
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?

1183
01:20:10,293 --> 01:20:13,173
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, I'm gonna have more.

1184
01:20:13,215 --> 01:20:14,550
- Dale?
- Yeah?

1185
01:20:15,302 --> 01:20:16,764
Did you ask her?

1186
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:22,233
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?

1187
01:20:22,274 --> 01:20:25,029
Oh. Well...

1188
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:30,122
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...

1189
01:20:30,164 --> 01:20:31,208
Dale!

1190
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,381
You are hopeless,
you know that? You're hopeless.

1191
01:20:34,422 --> 01:20:38,640
Yeah. You're probably right about that.

1192
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:40,851
Except for...

1193
01:20:40,935 --> 01:20:45,235
she kinda mentioned to me
that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so...

1194
01:20:45,277 --> 01:20:46,320
we're goin' bowling.

1195
01:20:48,784 --> 01:20:51,414
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.

1196
01:20:51,455 --> 01:20:55,255
OW.

1197
01:20:56,256 --> 01:20:58,218
Whoo! Yes.

1198
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,728
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck.

1199
01:21:02,769 --> 01:21:06,192
That girl has got an amazing set...
of bowling fingers.

1200
01:21:06,234 --> 01:21:09,532
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?

1201
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:12,413
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want,

1202
01:21:12,455 --> 01:21:15,293
because it sure as heck fire
ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.

1203
01:21:15,335 --> 01:21:17,882
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.

1204
01:21:17,965 --> 01:21:20,803
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.

1205
01:21:20,887 --> 01:21:23,434
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?

1206
01:21:23,517 --> 01:21:24,728
Yeah.

1207
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:26,690
You got 'er. Go, buddy.

1208
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,403
Hey.

1209
01:21:29,445 --> 01:21:32,159
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.

1210
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:36,668
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think
this is too stupid or whatever,

1211
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:38,797
but I got you a little something.

1212
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,345
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1213
01:21:42,387 --> 01:21:43,682
I know. I wanted to.

1214
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,562
Oh, my gosh.

1215
01:21:46,604 --> 01:21:50,486
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.

1216
01:21:50,528 --> 01:21:52,114
It's a pink helmet.

1217
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:55,830
I think, you know, it might just be better if
you wear that every day from now on, so...

1218
01:21:55,914 --> 01:21:57,875
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1219
01:21:57,917 --> 01:21:59,378
It's perfect.

1220
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:02,801
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...

1221
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:05,975
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

1222
01:22:06,017 --> 01:22:08,604
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.

1223
01:22:08,646 --> 01:22:12,696
I mean, except for all the people dying, when
they were bleeding on us and everything.

1224
01:22:12,738 --> 01:22:15,784
That wasn't so much fun,
but...you know...

1225
01:22:16,787 --> 01:22:18,916
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.

1226
01:22:18,958 --> 01:22:21,671
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this,

1227
01:22:21,713 --> 01:22:26,305
cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get
to spend this kind of time together again,

1228
01:22:26,347 --> 01:22:27,976
and I want to let you know that I...

1229
01:22:29,937 --> 01:22:31,566
I feel the same way.

1230
01:22:33,819 --> 01:22:35,865
- Really?
- Really.

1231
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:39,623
BJ!

1232
01:22:41,293 --> 01:22:43,964
Oh, my God, should we go help her?

1233
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:45,092
Hell, no.

1234
01:22:50,435 --> 01:22:51,479
Whatever.
