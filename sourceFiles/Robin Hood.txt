1
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:27,821
Can somebody tell me 
what's going on?

2
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:29,697
Don't be foolish, Walter.
Get him back to bed.

3
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,407
- Bar the door. 
- I'm still the master of this house.

4
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:32,909
Richard, up.

5
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,080
Who is there?

6
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,748
Wake up, Thomas.

7
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:45,922
Open the gates!

8
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:56,933
Bastards.

9
00:02:57,768 --> 00:02:58,935
Arrow.

10
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,440
The lantern.

11
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,953
I see you, you little bastards.

12
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,788
I see you!

13
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:33,303
Thieving maggots.

14
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:36,180
They've taken all our seed grain.

15
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:39,559
What are we going
to do for planting?

16
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:41,477
Pray.

17
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:47,752
Hello, there!

18
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:01,891
Here you go, lad.

19
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,393
Thank you, Robin.

20
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:04,769
Robin.

21
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,896
The archers been called to ranks.

22
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,856
Bloody typical. I'm starving.

23
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,109
Hide these well.

24
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,362
We'll have them for supper instead.

25
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:32,130
Sire.

26
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:35,049
Your bath, Sire.

27
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:55,653
For the love of Christ, Loxley, 
would you stop them doing that!

28
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,280
They love you, Sire.

29
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:59,949
My head. It's going
like the bells of hell.

30
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:03,995
Is that it?

31
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,458
One more castle to sack,
then we're home to England.

32
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:11,878
Hail King Richard!

33
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:18,342
Release!

34
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,680
Push!

35
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,266
Hey, archer!

36
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:26,893
Stay alive!

37
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:28,186
I'll see you tonight.

38
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,313
Don't forget your money
this time, little man.

39
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,565
It will be my pleasure
to take it off you.

40
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:35,401
Push!

41
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:41,324
Move up!

42
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:48,956
Cover the King! Cover the King!

43
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:54,962
Barricades prepare!

44
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:05,806
Let us put these French to bed!

45
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,313
Raise the barricades!

46
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,494
Jimmy.

47
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,829
Calm and careful. Make it count.

48
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,164
Go!

49
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,021
Help!

50
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:56,566
Cover!

51
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:09,787
Now.

52
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,250
Go!

53
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:24,885
Move back!

54
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:28,055
Blood for France!

55
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:30,891
Go!

56
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:34,228
It'll make a fine pin cushion!

57
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,355
King Philip's arse!

58
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:56,250
Look what they do
for the Lion Heart!

59
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,254
Push!

60
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,672
Push!

61
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,343
That'll burn all night, lads.
Don't let them put it out.

62
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:08,888
These pricks will smash through 
in the morning, take all the credit.

63
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:10,514
Well done, Jimmy boy.

64
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,828
John ...

65
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:34,372
Your Majesty.

66
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:38,042
An English princess shut out 
of her husband's bedchamber ...

67
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:40,252
by a piece of French pastry!

68
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:41,879
Aren't you ashamed?

69
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:43,798
The shame is surely his.

70
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:45,883
Then go in and tell him.

71
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:49,595
Mewling at his keyhole is neither 
one thing nor the other.

72
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,806
John.

73
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,979
Oh, God! What in heaven ...

74
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:01,273
Mademoiselle, you will excuse me.

75
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,401
My son has need of my advice.

76
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:05,277
No, I don't. Ask her.

77
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,073
Mother, please,
have you no decency?

78
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:13,744
I happen to be in a condition that 
no mother should see her son in.

79
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,291
Yes, I know, but it's my mother.

80
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:20,418
That's enough.

81
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:21,919
On second thoughts,

82
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:25,214
I think it better that you 
do hear what I have to say.

83
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:28,134
Though I will not have
you in my presence.

84
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:29,844
Mother.

85
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,806
The purpose of my being in this 
room is to save the realm ...

86
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,977
from the consequences
of this unsuitable amusement.

87
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:40,771
Her uncle is the
bloody King of France.

88
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,899
- My uncle is ...
- Get down.

89
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:46,652
Her uncle wants her back.

90
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,406
Philip wants an excuse to cross ...

91
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,577
the Channel with an army.

92
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:57,246
And you have given 
him that excuse.

93
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:01,167
Take up your lawful wife
and save England.

94
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:04,920
My lawful wife is as barren
as a brick.

95
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:07,965
Is that truly the wife
you want for me?

96
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,550
Hmm?

97
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:12,928
You, who honored your husband
with eight children ...

98
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:15,556
so that even now when death has
taken the rest ...

99
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,603
you have a king and the runt of 
the litter to call you "Mother."

100
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:23,355
Better the bastard
of a servant girl ...

101
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,983
than bed the niece
of England's jealous enemy.

102
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,652
Or bed her and wed her, Mother.

103
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:31,363
I've asked the Pope's men
to arrange an annulment.

104
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:33,199
And do you think the Pope ...

105
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:36,869
will favor England's royal runt 
over the King of France?

106
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:40,080
He might see his way for the 
son of Eleanor of Aquitaine.

107
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,541
And for the future
King of England.

108
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:46,420
Richard the Lion Heart
is 40 years old, if not more.

109
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,215
And no babies.

110
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,510
I am a queen in the making.

111
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:56,514
Yes. Yes.

112
00:11:58,183 --> 00:11:59,433
You see?

113
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:02,937
She is my Eleanor.

114
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,568
Now, you do understand, 
this game is not about luck.

115
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:12,571
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

116
00:12:12,656 --> 00:12:14,365
Who'd like to take
a bit of fresh meat home?

117
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:16,534
Caught this morning.
We have a pheasant.

118
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:19,119
Three choices.
Right, left or middle?

119
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,287
Middle.

120
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,790
"The middle," he says.
The middle.

121
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:26,877
I'm sorry about those onions, 
young man. You lose.

122
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,546
Robin! Over here, 
they're needed for the pot.

123
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,047
Feisty one!

124
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,676
Aye, what else we got,
what else we got?

125
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,386
The fire will do its work.

126
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,055
We break through at first light.

127
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,809
With a fair wind,
we can be home in three days.

128
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:44,311
You return to Nottingham?

129
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:48,190
I have a wife who waits for me.

130
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:52,152
I have a mother that won't die,

131
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:54,905
and a brother who wishes me dead.

132
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,575
First thing I'm going to do
is lock them up.

133
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:00,369
Your people will rejoice 
to see you return home.

134
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:03,038
And that is a condition
I would like to keep them in.

135
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:05,165
To be remembered as I was.

136
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:08,335
My army knows better.

137
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:13,424
Lion Heart is mangy.

138
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,137
Every man in that army
idolizes you, Your Majesty.

139
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:20,014
Don't mollycoddle me.

140
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:24,685
I understand how difficult it 
must be to befriend a king.

141
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:29,315
Come on, Loxley. Let us find 
some ruffians, drink and laugh.

142
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,901
Let us see if we can
find an honest man.

143
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,111
Yes.

144
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,196
Let's do that.

145
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,127
Well, that's the thing, little man.
This is not a game of luck.

146
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:53,589
It's about the science of memory
and a quick hand.

147
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:57,551
I've got a quick eye.
I'll be watching you.

148
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,649
Three choices.

149
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:14,068
Right, left, or middle.

150
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,988
I think I'll take a fourth choice.

151
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:20,949
- A fourth?
- Hmm.

152
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:24,119
I've been watching you for a 
while now, Longstride.

153
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:26,538
There is no pea.

154
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:29,958
This game is a trick!

155
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:34,171
You take out the pea when you're doing 
your slidings and your turnings.

156
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:35,589
I got you.

157
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:42,554
Don't touch it again.

158
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:44,807
I'll do it!

159
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,121
You lose.

160
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:27,725
You're doing better than you think.

161
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,560
Get in there, Robin.

162
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:41,739
Kneel, you ignorant bastards!

163
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,657
Kneel before the King!

164
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:47,870
All of you, move back, now.

165
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:52,040
No, no, Loxley.
These men are soldiers at play.

166
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,334
Sinners after mine own heart.

167
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,671
Which one of you
started the fight?

168
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:01,341
I did, Sire.

169
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,052
I threw the first punch.

170
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,221
Ah, honest man.

171
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:08,515
And who're you fighting?

172
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,603
He was fighting me,
Your Majesty.

173
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:14,855
I thought him to be
a lesser man.

174
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:17,357
He was showing me different.

175
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:21,403
An enemy that shows his respect.

176
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,281
Stand up, the pair of you.

177
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:25,616
Not you.

178
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:33,207
Brave and honest.

179
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:39,338
Are you honest enough to tell a king 
something that he does not want to hear?

180
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:42,216
What is your opinion
on my crusade?

181
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:47,846
Will God be pleased
with my sacrifice?

182
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:58,774
No, he won't.

183
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:02,361
Why do you say that?

184
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,280
The massacre at Acre, Sire.

185
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:07,574
Speak up!

186
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:13,997
When you had us herd 2,500 Muslim 
men, women, and children together,

187
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:18,377
the young woman at my feet, with her 
hands bound, she looked up at me.

188
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:22,422
There wasn't fear in her eyes.
There wasn't anger.

189
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:25,133
There was only pity.

190
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,514
For she knew that
when you gave the order ...

191
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:34,601
and our blades would descend
upon their heads,

192
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:37,813
that, in that moment,
we would be godless.

193
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:39,940
All of us.

194
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:43,569
Godless.

195
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,408
Honest,

196
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,785
brave ...

197
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,371
and naïve.

198
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,750
There is your Englishman.

199
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:01,211
Right there.

200
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:05,966
Well done, Robin. You showed him.

201
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:07,968
The whipping will
be the worst of it.

202
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,386
The branding iron,
that will be the worst.

203
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,679
Unless they hang us.

204
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:13,307
No. No, this will be
the worst of it.

205
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:15,559
And this will be the end of it.

206
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:17,728
As soon as I get out
of here, I'm gone.

207
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:22,024
I don't owe God or any other man 
here one more minute of service.

208
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:25,879
We go all the way back
to the same breast.

209
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:29,383
Wet nurse.

210
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,676
Indeed.

211
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:33,595
We've been close ever since.

212
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:36,890
Good.

213
00:19:39,268 --> 00:19:42,521
Because England,
under your friend John,

214
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:46,608
is a country with
no fighting spirit.

215
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:50,070
I can take London
with an army of cooks.

216
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:53,198
But Richard is on his way home.

217
00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:58,078
And under Richard, England is 
a different animal altogether.

218
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:02,207
Richard will return home through 
the Forest of Broceliande.

219
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,293
We know the exact place.

220
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:11,758
He always travels ahead of his army with 
only a few trusted knights around him.

221
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:14,553
With Richard dead,

222
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:17,264
it will be easy for you to 
turn the country against John.

223
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:20,434
There'll never be a better 
moment to invade.

224
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:27,482
Even dying animals
can be obstinate.

225
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,488
Kill the Lion Heart and you 
will be richly rewarded.

226
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:52,883
Heave!

227
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,886
Heave!

228
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:13,612
Heave!

229
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:16,239
For England!

230
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:22,370
For England!

231
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,757
I need a physician here!

232
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,801
A physician! Quickly!

233
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:37,594
Give us cover!
Give us cover, now!

234
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:42,015
Cover him!

235
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:44,518
Cover the King.

236
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:47,521
Physician!

237
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:50,148
Why, Loxley?
Are you not feeling well?

238
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:52,317
Physician!

239
00:21:58,699 --> 00:21:59,825
Wine.

240
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,307
What's this?

241
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:27,644
- The King is dead!
- Dead?

242
00:22:28,437 --> 00:22:29,563
Dead.

243
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:32,315
All right, then, Jimmy.
Knock the pegs out.

244
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,568
We make our own fate
from now on!

245
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:39,489
I'll come with you.

246
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:42,492
No, you're not.
We don't take strays.

247
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:43,577
The more the merrier.

248
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:45,579
The road will be dangerous.
He might be useful.

249
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:46,663
Where we going?

250
00:22:46,747 --> 00:22:50,375
To the coast and to a boat before 
3,000 desperate soldiers get there ...

251
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,836
and the price for a Channel 
crossing goes up a hundredfold.

252
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,296
What about our wages?

253
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,424
If you thought it was hard 
getting wages while he was alive,

254
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:59,342
try getting paid by a dead king.

255
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:02,679
All right, boys, collect your 
gear as quick as you can.

256
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:10,270
I like the new church.

257
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,691
Lady Marion.

258
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:20,113
I would have been sorry to leave 
without your farewell. Thank you.

259
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:23,575
I'm glad to speed you
on your way, Father Tancred,

260
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:27,037
but it was to seek out
our new shepherd.

261
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:31,583
You have lately been missed at 
Sunday worship and my sermons.

262
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:36,296
I like a quiet church, Father,
when I pray for a miracle.

263
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:47,641
Your new flock is women,
children and old folk.

264
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,893
Our men have gone to war
or returned broken.

265
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:53,063
Their orphans run wild
in the greenwood.

266
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:59,903
Our fields are ready for planting
but we've no seed corn.

267
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:03,073
And the church barn
is full of grain.

268
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:05,784
Surely, you do not
expect the church ...

269
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:08,787
to let its corn be used
to plant your fields?

270
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:11,665
That grain is bound for York.

271
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,501
I am Friar Tuck.

272
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:17,045
Father Tancred is
elevated to York ...

273
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:19,881
where I know he will remind the Bishop 
that the people of Nottingham ...

274
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:23,760
The Bishop does not need reminding 
that the people of Nottingham ...

275
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:27,889
should reap what they sow
and repent of their sins.

276
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:32,185
The miracle I pray for is that the 
Bishop show some Christian charity.

277
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:39,359
As I said, Father, I like a 
quiet church when I pray.

278
00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:59,546
You will have trouble from 
the Loxleys of Peper Harow.

279
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:05,719
You keep bees, Tuck?

280
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:08,013
I keep them and they keep me.

281
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,539
Stop!

282
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,167
Ambush!

283
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,079
You're a knight?

284
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:58,873
Where is King Richard?

285
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:00,792
Oh, God.

286
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,335
Where is the King?

287
00:27:03,504 --> 00:27:05,046
- Dead.
- Dead?

288
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,507
Really?

289
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:12,846
If the King's dead,
where are you going?

290
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:15,515
Deliver the crown.

291
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:20,687
Richard's crown.

292
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,651
How do we assassinate a king
who's already dead?

293
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:38,246
Bring back the crown!
Kill the horse!

294
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,501
You are English.

295
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:46,212
When it suits me.

296
00:27:48,132 --> 00:27:49,174
Who are you?

297
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:52,677
Robert Loxley.

298
00:28:09,486 --> 00:28:11,529
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

299
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:15,408
That's the King's horse.

300
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:22,415
Jimmy! Move!

301
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:33,927
Jimmy!

302
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,650
Robin, they're French.

303
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:49,901
Ambush.

304
00:29:08,462 --> 00:29:09,587
Go.

305
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:48,584
John.

306
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:51,087
No.

307
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:52,588
He's dead.

308
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:53,881
Help.

309
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:03,891
My sword.

310
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:16,195
Its value to me is great.

311
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:19,449
It belonged to my father,

312
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:21,868
Sir Walter Loxley ...

313
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,620
of Nottingham.

314
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:27,915
Do you know it?

315
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,793
Aye, I've heard of Nottingham.

316
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:35,882
Then the fate ...

317
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,092
The fates have smiled on me.

318
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:45,850
You must take the sword
to my father.

319
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:48,978
It will bring me peace.

320
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:55,943
I took it in anger
and without his consent.

321
00:30:57,363 --> 00:31:00,490
You must understand
the bond of love ...

322
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:02,784
between a father
and his son.

323
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:07,246
My father abandoned me to the world 
of men when I was six years old.

324
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:09,957
I know little of the love
between father and son.

325
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,542
I beg you.

326
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:13,878
Longstride,

327
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:15,421
say you will.

328
00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:21,844
I will.

329
00:31:42,574 --> 00:31:44,742
It's a pact sworn
in blood, Robin.

330
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:48,579
It's a scratch, Allan,
and that's all it is.

331
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,059
Robin!

332
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:20,278
Loxley was making for the 
coast to meet the ship.

333
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:25,908
That crown could be
our passage home.

334
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:27,827
We're common archers, Robin.

335
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:30,788
If we arrive at the King's ship with 
his crown, we'll be accused of murder.

336
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:33,040
How do you know ...

337
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:37,336
that the knights you see walking 
about are actually knights at all?

338
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:39,881
There is no difference
between a knight ...

339
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:43,050
and any other man
aside from what he wears.

340
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:46,137
All we need is about us.

341
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:49,974
Armor, helmets, swords,

342
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:55,438
and we make England wealthy men ...

343
00:32:56,982 --> 00:32:59,275
with horses and gold.

344
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:03,404
Fate has smiled upon us at last.

345
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:07,074
And I, for one, shall not turn
my back on her.

346
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:11,787
Take that crown
off your head, Will,

347
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:12,955
and fill it to the brim.

348
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:20,379
We commit the soul of this boy
to your keeping, Lord.

349
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:24,050
We would ask, when he arrives
at the gates of eternity,

350
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:25,718
if you could let him in.

351
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:43,736
Goliath's got the soil turning 
nicely. But for what?

352
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:45,363
Nettles?

353
00:33:45,447 --> 00:33:46,989
Nettle soup and dandelion salad,

354
00:33:47,074 --> 00:33:48,157
that'll keep us alive.

355
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:49,325
Come, Goliath. This way.

356
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:51,035
Until we get a miracle.

357
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:53,079
This way.

358
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,796
Marion, Sheriff.

359
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:13,266
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow,
waiting in vain ...

360
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,810
for Sir Walter to receive me.

361
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,731
Kindly tell him I have better things 
to do than haunt his threshold.

362
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:23,526
That you have, while robbers 
are roaming free in Sherwood.

363
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,861
That's sheriff's business.
Why don't you look to it?

364
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:28,155
Tell the old fool that next time,
I'll break his door down.

365
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:29,865
And if he's too proud to pay ...

366
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,951
No, no, no, no.
He's not too proud.

367
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:33,536
He's too poor.

368
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,997
In the name of King Richard,
you have stripped our wealth ...

369
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:37,456
to pay for foreign adventures.

370
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:40,251
Whilst at home, the Church, in 
the name of the merciful God,

371
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:41,460
has reaped, without mercy,

372
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:44,797
the largest share of what we 
had set aside to feed ourselves.

373
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:48,384
Between a sheriff and a bishop,
I wouldn't care to judge ...

374
00:34:48,468 --> 00:34:50,678
who's the greater curse
on honest English folk.

375
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,056
Marion,

376
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:57,143
why, oh, why do you
make an enemy of me

377
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:59,395
when you have the means
to make me your protector?

378
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:01,147
What means?

379
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,737
If you leave now,

380
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,323
I will lengthen your life
by not telling my husband ...

381
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,950
of your visit when
he returns home.

382
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,953
Your husband? After 10 years?

383
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:21,500
If he's not dead, he's rutting his way 
through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.

384
00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:24,045
So speaks a man of experience.

385
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:25,963
Well, think on it, Marion.

386
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:28,924
Sir Walter is dying
without an heir.

387
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:32,970
Peper Harow will fall to the crown, 
and you will be living in the hedgerow.

388
00:35:33,263 --> 00:35:35,014
You'll be glad to come to me then.

389
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:10,883
Captain, there.

390
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:33,948
Sir, we were told to expect 
12 riders and the King.

391
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,951
Our beloved King is dead.

392
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:42,164
Long live the King.

393
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,791
And you are, sir?

394
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,922
Sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham.
And you?

395
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,508
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

396
00:36:52,592 --> 00:36:55,970
Come aboard, gentlemen, before the 
tide floats her. It's coming in fast.

00:37:07,274 --> 00:37:11,944

So what's the plan in the morning?

406
00:37:48,273 --> 00:37:51,317
The boat stops at Gravesend
on the way to London.

407
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:54,862
We'll leave the honor of returning 
the crown to them, and we'll be gone.

408
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,447
Where?

409
00:37:57,324 --> 00:37:58,491
North.

410
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,077

00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:05,915

415
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:22,199
Make ready, Sir Robert.
We dock in 20 minutes.

416
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:23,867
Gravesend?

417
00:39:23,952 --> 00:39:27,413
No, My Lord. The palace docks,
Tower of London.

418
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:37,840
Will.

419
00:39:39,384 --> 00:39:40,676
John. Allan.

420
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:44,555
- Where are we?
- London.

421
00:39:44,806 --> 00:39:46,181
Holy Christ!

422
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,643
We dock in 10 minutes.

423
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:52,271
When this is done,
be ready to ride.

424
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:54,273
What if ...
What if Loxley is known ...

425
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:56,442
to the King's mother
or brother or any of them?

426
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:58,527
Then we'll be riding
for our lives.

427
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:02,031
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Peter and Paul and Mary!

428
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:03,616
I knew it! I knew it!

429
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:06,702
Good morning, My Lord.

430
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:10,289
Some words of advice
on this tragic occasion.

431
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:13,626
You appreciate everything must
be done correctly,

432
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:16,754
so you will present
the crown to Lady Eleanor.

433
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:18,380
You will go down
on the right knee.

434
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:22,343
Do not look in her eyes when you 
tell her the King is no more.

435
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:26,221
And do not rise until all 
others rise. Do you understand?

436
00:40:26,306 --> 00:40:27,389
Yes.

437
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:40,319
Agnes.

438
00:40:41,488 --> 00:40:43,113
My blue and gold brocade.

439
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:44,323
Yes, My Lady.

440
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:07,971
Part for the Queen.

441
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,431
Part for the Queen.

442
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,582
Cease.

443
00:41:57,355 --> 00:41:58,939
What's this?
What's happening?

444
00:41:59,023 --> 00:42:01,233
King Richard returns
from France, My Lord.

445
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,865
Did Loxley deceive us?

446
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:44,151
Kneel.

447
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:52,409
Long life, my son.

448
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:55,287
Rise now.

449
00:42:58,249 --> 00:43:00,959
A king is dead.

450
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:04,505
Long live the King.

451
00:43:06,132 --> 00:43:08,133
Long live the King!

452
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:12,930
Long live the King!

453
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:14,765
Rise.

454
00:43:19,938 --> 00:43:21,104
You ...

455
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:24,399
I don't know you.

456
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:27,694
Robert Loxley, Sire, of Nottingham.

457
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:30,197
Welcome then.

458
00:43:31,115 --> 00:43:32,950
And how did my brother die?

459
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:36,703
In battle, Your Majesty,
as was his way.

460
00:43:37,997 --> 00:43:39,414
As was his way.

461
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,375
You deserve a reward ...

462
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:42,501
Let's get the horses.

463
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:44,086
for bringing home the news.

464
00:43:46,297 --> 00:43:47,464
Kneel.

465
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:56,348
Did you say you were
from Nottingham?

466
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:58,892
Yes.

467
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:03,689
Your father, Sir Walter,

468
00:44:05,149 --> 00:44:07,025
owes tax to the crown.

469
00:44:10,238 --> 00:44:11,321
My crown.

470
00:44:11,656 --> 00:44:13,991
Tell him it's bloody expensive
running a country ...

471
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:16,159
and everyone's got 
to pay their way.

472
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:17,953
We'll start with this.

473
00:44:20,164 --> 00:44:21,665
Make way for the King!

474
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:23,667
Make way!

475
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:24,918
Your Majesty.

476
00:44:25,003 --> 00:44:26,879
Make way for the King!

477
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:34,094
- Make way!
- Godfrey.

478
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:37,681
Godfrey, my friend.
It's so good to see you.

479
00:44:38,224 --> 00:44:40,183
- How were your travels?
- Good, Sire.

480
00:44:41,352 --> 00:44:42,519
What happened to your face?

481
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:45,480
A hunting accident.
It's nothing.

482
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,609
- Frightening.
- Your Majesty.

483
00:44:48,693 --> 00:44:52,195
Call it a dueling scar. The ladies 
will love you all the more.

484
00:44:53,031 --> 00:44:55,198
I bow to your knowledge
of the ladies, Sire.

485
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,330
You can get up now.

486
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,214
Sir Robert.

487
00:45:15,637 --> 00:45:17,888
You will know of me, perhaps.

488
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:19,514
I'm William Marshal.

489
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:23,226
Your father and I were
young men together.

490
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:25,354
Tell him I'm coming
to visit him soon,

491
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:27,522
on spring's first black night.

492
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:31,401
I may have need of him.

493
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:33,737
I will. I'll tell him.

494
00:45:36,449 --> 00:45:39,910
Whoever he is and whatever he is,
he knows too much.

495
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:44,414
Get rid of him.

496
00:45:57,595 --> 00:45:59,471
Come on, let's follow.

497
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,327
Forfeit what you got.

498
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:07,497
Victuals, coin, clothing ...

499
00:47:07,582 --> 00:47:09,041
or your life.

500
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:13,503
Thomas Cooper.

501
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:15,672
Is that you?

502
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:21,762
Are you sick, Thomas?

503
00:47:22,597 --> 00:47:24,139
We're all sick.

504
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:28,101
- Where are the rest of you?
- Don't ... Don't tell her.

505
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:29,603
Loop will be angry.

506
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:31,521
No, it's your mother
who's going to be angry.

507
00:47:31,606 --> 00:47:35,650
Now, either you come with me,
or I come with you.

508
00:47:35,735 --> 00:47:37,069
You choose.

509
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,822
Well, come on then.
Where are they?

510
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:43,408
Answer me.

511
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,876
Four men, five horses,
one gray.

512
00:48:35,294 --> 00:48:36,670
Have you seen them?

513
00:48:36,754 --> 00:48:37,838

Sing a foot-stomper about 
adventure and daring and courage.

521
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:15,083
No. Sing something about a woman.

522
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:17,752
A large woman.

And so should we be.

527
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:31,391
Where will you go?

528
00:49:34,312 --> 00:49:37,272
I think something is owed
for this good fortune,

529
00:49:37,356 --> 00:49:38,857
and I mean to pay it back.

530
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:40,150
How so?

531
00:49:41,569 --> 00:49:44,779
The inscription on the sword,
it taunts my memory.

532
00:49:45,656 --> 00:49:48,575
Maybe it's just my imagination,
I don't know.

533
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:52,120
But I intend to take that sword
back to its owner ...

534
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:53,955
and fulfill the request
of his dying son.

535
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,207
Are you mad?

536
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,792
You just said
we were in danger, Robin.

537
00:49:57,877 --> 00:50:00,837
Now you choose to step back
in to harm's way?

538
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:03,840
They're bound to go
there and find you.

539
00:50:03,925 --> 00:50:08,011
We can't repay our good luck with 
bad grace. It invites darkness.

540
00:50:13,017 --> 00:50:14,726
- I'm going with you.
- And I, Robin.

541
00:50:15,144 --> 00:50:16,394
- Yes.
- No.

542
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,773
Tonight is our last in company.

543
00:50:19,857 --> 00:50:22,817
Tomorrow,
we go our separate ways.

544
00:50:24,528 --> 00:50:27,364
Pack up your share.
We eat and sleep.

545
00:50:28,074 --> 00:50:30,450
Will, you're on first watch.

546
00:51:32,638 --> 00:51:33,680
Will.

547
00:52:04,086 --> 00:52:05,670
Watch your step!

548
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,672
One of them got away.

549
00:52:09,216 --> 00:52:11,760
Bastards!
They've stolen my fortune.

550
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,513
Richard's army is coming home.

551
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:17,390
It costs money to keep it together.

552
00:52:17,475 --> 00:52:18,767
Marshal, you speak for the money.

553
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:20,018
I do, Sire.

554
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:23,563
But to disband the army could 
cost more than to keep it.

555
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:31,196
King Richard's campaigns were 
costly. And the expected returns...

556
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,531
What is that to me, Marshal?

557
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:36,826
My brother's troubles are over!

558
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:39,704
They're over!

559
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:42,999
Clear the room.

560
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:57,764
So ... Taxation.

561
00:52:57,848 --> 00:52:59,015
Taxation?

562
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,436
Milking a dry udder gets you nothing 
but kicked off the milking stool.

563
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,647
Mother, spare me
your farmyard memories.

564
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:08,399
You have none,
and I don't understand them.

565
00:53:08,484 --> 00:53:10,235
These are difficult times.

566
00:53:10,528 --> 00:53:12,153
We can buy time.

567
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:14,906
I can send envoys to secure loans.

568
00:53:15,032 --> 00:53:17,867
There are money chests from Sicily 
to Normandy if you know where to look.

569
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:20,036
Cap-in-hand to moneylenders?

570
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:21,913
Your master's a king.

571
00:53:22,623 --> 00:53:24,958
The crown is owed money at home.

572
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:29,254
The northern barons plead poverty, but 
that's always been the song of rich men.

573
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:32,173
So, what's to be done?

574
00:53:47,982 --> 00:53:51,025
Give me leave, Sire, to go north 
with a company of mounted men.

575
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:53,903
I'll have the merchants and 
landowners fill your coffers ...

576
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:55,989
or their coffins.

577
00:53:56,073 --> 00:53:58,491
Englishmen killing Englishmen.

578
00:53:58,576 --> 00:54:01,619
No man loyal to the crown
has anything to fear.

579
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:07,208
And loyalty means paying your 
share in the defense of the realm.

580
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:09,919
That's well said.

581
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,505
Hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?

582
00:54:14,008 --> 00:54:15,175
Mother?

583
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:20,346
Richard commanded loyalty not 
by threats but by example.

584
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:23,600
Mother, your sainted
son was an imbecile.

585
00:54:23,976 --> 00:54:29,022
And you supported his every folly 
from here to Jerusalem and back.

586
00:54:29,732 --> 00:54:32,859
Yes, you worshipped him ...

587
00:54:32,943 --> 00:54:36,821
when the warrior lost territories
hard won by his father.

588
00:54:37,031 --> 00:54:39,115
You kissed his picture ...

589
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,452
while England had to pay
four years' revenue ...

590
00:54:42,536 --> 00:54:44,204
to ransom him
when he was captured.

591
00:54:44,288 --> 00:54:46,789
You are just as much
to blame as anyone ...

592
00:54:46,874 --> 00:54:49,250
for the wreckage
which is my inheritance.

593
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:05,975
I broke her skin
more than she did mine.

594
00:55:13,525 --> 00:55:14,901
Chancellor.

595
00:55:21,158 --> 00:55:22,367
Marshal,

596
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:27,789
you served my brother faithfully
and my father before him.

597
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:32,210
I think you've spent enough 
time with my family ...

598
00:55:32,336 --> 00:55:34,879
and, no doubt, would like to 
spend more with your own.

599
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,259
Therefore, and with regret,

600
00:55:39,843 --> 00:55:43,221
I accept your resignation of all 
your offices and matters of state.

601
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:47,892
The ring.

602
00:55:55,943 --> 00:55:57,402
Your Majesty.

603
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:20,216
Choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot 
where you would place your dagger.

604
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:31,644
For I will choose
carefully, as well.

605
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,586
Open the gates!

606
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:33,915
Nottingham.

607
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:36,584
Is this your people, Robin?

608
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:38,002
I don't know. Might be.

609
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:41,839
They don't look much,
these Middle Englanders.

610
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:44,550
Well, they've been keeping your lot 
in place easy enough, haven't they?

611
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:47,470
I hear that you Welsh boys,
you live on leeks.

612
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:49,847
You co-habit with sheep.

613
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:54,102
Bloody Scottish mule.

614
00:57:55,854 --> 00:57:59,315
You wouldn't want to annoy a bee 
hive with your noise, would you?

615
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,317
Your swords would be
no good then, gentlemen.

616
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,693
You're the town beekeeper?

617
00:58:03,904 --> 00:58:06,781
Bless you, no. I'm the friar.
Tuck's the name.

618
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:08,741
Well, Friar Tuck,

619
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:11,327
can you tell me where I might 
find Sir Walter Loxley?

620
00:58:11,537 --> 00:58:13,830
If he's not up at Peper Harow ...

621
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,208
How long will your business take?

622
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:23,339
Stay safe.

623
00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:25,341
God be with you all.

624
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:33,641
That's it?

625
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:35,184
After 10 years?

626
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:39,647
Good Friar,
where can a man get, well,

627
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:41,858
moderately insensible
on a drink around here?

628
00:58:42,192 --> 00:58:45,361
Allan,
he's a man of the cloth.
I'm sorry, Friar.

629
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,030
Have you coin?

630
00:58:48,115 --> 00:58:49,198
I have coin.

631
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:50,950
Two pieces.

632
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:52,869
Each.

633
00:58:54,037 --> 00:58:56,956
Have you tried the honey liquor
we call mead?

634
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:00,460
Come with me.

635
00:59:01,128 --> 00:59:03,379
Gives a man a halo, does mead.

636
00:59:35,078 --> 00:59:36,162
Girl.

637
00:59:36,246 --> 00:59:38,206
Girl?

638
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:45,588
Either you're going blind or 
you're looking for charity.

639
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:48,049
Are you the keeper of this house?

640
00:59:48,133 --> 00:59:50,343
In a manner of speaking, yes.

641
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,553
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.

642
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:56,307
And you are?

643
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:57,642
Robin Longstride.

644
00:59:57,726 --> 00:59:59,685
Plain Robin Longstride?
No Sir?

645
01:00:00,187 --> 01:00:02,271
No, ma'am. No Sir.

646
01:00:05,984 --> 01:00:07,109
Are you here about the tax?

647
01:00:08,278 --> 01:00:12,406
No, I'm here to bring him 
his sword. His son's dead.

648
01:00:14,826 --> 01:00:16,118
This way.

649
01:00:38,016 --> 01:00:39,892
He'll take your horse.

650
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:52,989
Marion!

651
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,949
Marion!

652
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,410
Maggie, where is she?

653
01:00:58,662 --> 01:01:00,246
Ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.

654
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,707
I know, Margaret.
I can hear him.

655
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,251
Tell him we have a guest.

656
01:01:14,595 --> 01:01:18,014
I'm Marion Loxley.
Robert's wife.

657
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,104
My Lady, I owe you an apology.
If I'd have known ...

658
01:01:25,355 --> 01:01:28,649
Bad news is bad news
no matter how it comes.

659
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:34,363
Indeed, I owe you thanks for taking 
the time to deliver it here yourself.

660
01:01:35,198 --> 01:01:37,700
Did you fight alongside
my husband?

661
01:01:39,369 --> 01:01:40,411
Yes.

662
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:43,164
Did he die well?

663
01:01:47,252 --> 01:01:48,586
In an ambush, ma'am.

664
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:52,214
He was the man chosen to bring 
home Richard's crown.

665
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:54,508
Marion, who is here?

666
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:57,595
A traveler, Walter.

667
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:05,645
This news will go
very hard on him.

668
01:02:05,729 --> 01:02:06,812
Bring him in.

669
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:08,147
Yes, yes.

670
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:09,940
Tell him Robert
is in the Holy Land,

671
01:02:10,025 --> 01:02:11,901
sends his love
and will return soon.

672
01:02:12,736 --> 01:02:15,237
Marion, our traveler
will be thirsty.

673
01:02:15,947 --> 01:02:19,492
Travelers are always thirsty.
Is that not so?

674
01:02:19,576 --> 01:02:20,618
Your name, sir?

675
01:02:21,745 --> 01:02:23,913
Longstride. Robin Longstride.

676
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:27,667
Do you mock me?

677
01:02:29,544 --> 01:02:30,586
Sir?

678
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,130
Your son,

679
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:36,717
he asked me to bring you this.

680
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:49,689
And how does Robert defend 
himself if he has no sword?

681
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:51,107
Hmm?

682
01:02:51,274 --> 01:02:54,193
The prodigal son will
not return after all.

683
01:02:56,863 --> 01:03:01,033
So, no tears, no forgiveness
from his father.

684
01:03:05,288 --> 01:03:07,081
No amends to be made.

685
01:03:15,632 --> 01:03:17,425
Did you see him die?

686
01:03:19,761 --> 01:03:21,971
I was with him when he passed.

687
01:03:23,014 --> 01:03:25,975
His final words were for the love 
and bond between a father and son.

688
01:03:27,144 --> 01:03:28,853
Forgive my rudeness.

689
01:03:30,147 --> 01:03:32,815
My grief has been
waiting for this day.

690
01:03:34,025 --> 01:03:37,027
So come, so that I may see you.

691
01:03:52,502 --> 01:03:54,503
Robin Longstride.

692
01:03:55,756 --> 01:03:59,091
A common enough
but noble Saxon name.

693
01:04:01,386 --> 01:04:04,346
So, you will dine with us.

694
01:04:05,766 --> 01:04:08,267
But first, you must bathe, sir.

695
01:04:08,685 --> 01:04:09,810
You stink.

696
01:04:16,693 --> 01:04:18,944
I've laid out some of
my husband's clothes.

697
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:21,947
I hope you don't find
that too discomforting.

698
01:04:23,366 --> 01:04:24,658
My Lady,

699
01:04:27,078 --> 01:04:28,746
I'll need some help
with the chain mail.

700
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:35,127
Winifred.

701
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,223
The coif has a clasp
at the nape of the neck.

702
01:04:56,691 --> 01:05:00,694
If you take off the coif, you'll find 
lacings in the back of the tabard.

703
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:38,774
Thank you.

704
01:05:38,859 --> 01:05:40,609
I'll have it washed.

705
01:05:58,044 --> 01:05:59,712
Marion, more wine.

706
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,636
You've taken a long road
to bring this to me.

707
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:11,098
I cannot decide whether that 
makes you trustworthy ...

708
01:06:11,182 --> 01:06:12,474
Or manipulative.

709
01:06:13,268 --> 01:06:15,728
Marion, I'm merely
trying to gauge ...

710
01:06:15,812 --> 01:06:18,480
the quality of the man
we have as our guest.

711
01:06:18,899 --> 01:06:20,441
Is he handsome?

712
01:06:20,984 --> 01:06:22,318
- Yes.
- Mmm-hmm.

713
01:06:23,862 --> 01:06:27,823
In the way that yeomen sometimes 
are when they are sober.

714
01:06:27,908 --> 01:06:30,826
Entertain us with a tale
of your life, sir.

715
01:06:31,453 --> 01:06:34,163
We don't get many visitors anymore.

716
01:06:34,247 --> 01:06:36,999
Except tax collectors
and other beggars.

717
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:41,045
I don't know where I'm from.
Only know where I've been.

718
01:06:41,129 --> 01:06:44,506
So, Marion,
what color are his eyes?

719
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:47,176
Hmm?

720
01:06:49,596 --> 01:06:51,221
I don't yet know.

721
01:06:52,015 --> 01:06:56,602
I have a proposal
for you, young man.

722
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:01,273
You brought me this sword,
which has great meaning.

723
01:07:01,483 --> 01:07:03,317
If you give me your time,

724
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:05,694
it is yours.

725
01:07:07,364 --> 01:07:10,532
I could stay for a day, or more.

726
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:14,536
I have a question to ask you.

727
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:16,872
And what is your question?

728
01:07:16,957 --> 01:07:19,959
The words on the hilt of 
the sword, what do they mean?

729
01:07:20,919 --> 01:07:25,839
Well, I think I have much to tell 
you about history. About your history.

730
01:07:32,973 --> 01:07:34,306
That's very kind.

731
01:07:34,391 --> 01:07:37,559
Well, you haven't heard the 
other half of my proposal yet.

732
01:07:37,644 --> 01:07:41,647
I want you to stay in Nottingham 
and, for the time being,

733
01:07:41,731 --> 01:07:45,859
become my returned son,
and therefore Marion's spouse.

734
01:07:45,944 --> 01:07:47,194
Oh, that's enough!

735
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:48,821
- You've had too much to drink.
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

736
01:07:48,905 --> 01:07:53,242
We both know that without a husband 
you will lose this land when I die.

737
01:07:53,493 --> 01:07:55,577
Do you dispute that? Hmm?

738
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,580
- No.
- No, so if I say this is my son,

739
01:07:58,665 --> 01:08:04,086
he will be seen as that.
And, so, as your husband. Huh?

740
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:05,921
It is a fair contract.

741
01:08:06,381 --> 01:08:11,135
It is not as if I expect you 
to have children or ...

742
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:15,222
No, the sword for your time,
Longstride.

743
01:08:15,598 --> 01:08:16,598
Are you in agreement? Hmm?

744
01:08:18,685 --> 01:08:19,685
Yes.

745
01:08:19,769 --> 01:08:21,437
Marion, go tell the staff ...

746
01:08:21,813 --> 01:08:26,024
that my son has arrived and 
our home is now whole again.

747
01:08:27,026 --> 01:08:29,778
Tell them to ring the church 
bells in celebration.

748
01:08:30,613 --> 01:08:32,489
And more wine, please.

749
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:44,585
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

750
01:08:49,674 --> 01:08:51,049

751
01:08:51,134 --> 01:08:53,343

754
01:08:59,517 --> 01:09:00,851
Home brew.

755
01:09:02,187 --> 01:09:06,607
If I wasn't the village priest, 
I'd try for the village drunkard.

756
01:09:08,651 --> 01:09:09,860
Oh, great.

757
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:13,363
A man could get
very affectionate here.

758
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:18,911
I haven't seen so many women for 
so few men outside a nunnery.

759
01:09:19,662 --> 01:09:24,124
The secret to success is never 
go for the prettiest one.

760
01:09:24,918 --> 01:09:27,085
Start with the homely
one on the left.

761
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:32,299
Right there.

762
01:09:32,675 --> 01:09:35,761
She's about my size.
I'm going to make her smile.

763
01:09:36,721 --> 01:09:39,139
I'm going to make you smile!

764
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:40,682
Come over here!

765
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,685
So, why do they
call you Little John?

766
01:09:43,895 --> 01:09:45,229
What are you trying to get at?

767
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:47,731
I'm proportionate.

768
01:09:47,857 --> 01:09:50,526
♪ So roll another
barrel to the bar ♪

769
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:54,363

770
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:44,621
Stop it.

771
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:49,418
What did I tell you?

772
01:10:59,262 --> 01:11:01,805
It seems we are 
to share my chamber.

773
01:11:02,765 --> 01:11:05,100
A ruse to convince the servants.

774
01:11:06,477 --> 01:11:09,521
Well, if the aim is deception,

775
01:11:10,106 --> 01:11:15,444
should you not be addressing me 
as "My husband," or, "My dear"?

776
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:18,655
Don't be ridiculous.

777
01:11:22,785 --> 01:11:24,620
Well, are you coming or not?

778
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:30,042
Ask me nicely.

779
01:11:38,009 --> 01:11:41,803
Please, dear husband,
will you share my chamber?

780
01:12:18,591 --> 01:12:19,675
Here.

781
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,430
I sleep with a dagger.

782
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:29,434
If you so much as move to touch 
me, I will sever your manhood.

783
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:30,769
You understand?

784
01:12:31,104 --> 01:12:32,187
Thanks for the warning.

785
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:40,362
Hello, dogs.

786
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:37,270
Godfrey.

787
01:14:47,865 --> 01:14:49,574
Where are your men?

788
01:14:50,576 --> 01:14:51,827
They're dead, My Lord.

789
01:14:52,954 --> 01:14:54,079
And Loxley?

790
01:14:54,372 --> 01:14:55,539
Alive.

791
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,585
Then fate has left him to me.

792
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:16,935
I hear a man's steps.
Good morning, my son.

793
01:15:17,728 --> 01:15:18,854
Morning, Walter.

794
01:15:20,064 --> 01:15:21,064
Father.

795
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:23,150
Father.

796
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:26,236
So what is it that
you know of my history?

797
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,571
Patience.

798
01:15:28,072 --> 01:15:31,533
You must show yourself today.
Wear your sword.

799
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:34,286
Marion.

800
01:15:35,246 --> 01:15:36,371
I'm here, Walter.

801
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:40,250
Reacquaint your husband with 
his village and his people.

802
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,504
I'll see to the horses.

803
01:15:45,006 --> 01:15:46,631
I feel invigorated.

804
01:15:46,716 --> 01:15:49,926
I woke this morning
with a tumescent glow.

805
01:15:50,761 --> 01:15:51,761
Eighty-four.

806
01:15:52,763 --> 01:15:54,139
A miracle.

807
01:15:55,766 --> 01:15:58,685
I've always wondered at the 
private conversations of men.

808
01:16:00,146 --> 01:16:01,438
Husband.

809
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:23,627
This is rich country.

810
01:16:24,253 --> 01:16:26,213
Where's your cattle
and your sheep?

811
01:16:26,297 --> 01:16:30,258
Sold, eaten, stolen, traded.
We've had seven lean years.

812
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:33,136
Our meat now is rabbit ...

813
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:35,889
or wild pig on a lucky day.

814
01:16:35,973 --> 01:16:36,973
And deer?

815
01:16:37,642 --> 01:16:41,519
If you're willing to risk your 
neck to the King's executioner.

816
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:44,564
Every deer in the land
belongs to His Majesty.

817
01:16:44,649 --> 01:16:47,192
These things are God's gifts first 
before the King's possessions.

818
01:16:48,027 --> 01:16:51,821
If it's illegal for a man
to fend for himself ...

819
01:16:51,906 --> 01:16:53,657
how then can he be a man
in his own right?

820
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:55,742
Welcome home, sir.

821
01:16:55,826 --> 01:16:56,868
Sir Robert.

822
01:16:56,953 --> 01:16:58,995
Good morning, Joseph. Emma.

823
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:04,292
Sir Walter is our Lord, and you are 
Robert returned and you should act so.

824
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:09,047
Sir Robert. You remember me?

825
01:17:09,632 --> 01:17:11,841
Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.

826
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:13,760
You don't look a day older, Tom.

827
01:17:15,012 --> 01:17:16,263
Sir Robert.

828
01:17:17,014 --> 01:17:18,723
When will our young lads
come back to us?

829
01:17:19,892 --> 01:17:22,852
Will you find my Jamie,
tell him to come home?

830
01:17:25,606 --> 01:17:29,442
With no work and little food,
the village boys have gone.

831
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:30,860
To be soldiers?

832
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:32,195
Poachers.

833
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:38,702
Look at that, mate.

834
01:17:41,747 --> 01:17:43,456
Still here then?

835
01:17:45,418 --> 01:17:49,337
For the time being, refer to me 
as Sir Robert. I'll explain later.

836
01:17:49,922 --> 01:17:53,550
My men-at-arms.
This is about as courtly as they get.

837
01:17:54,218 --> 01:17:57,387
Allan A'Dayle, Will Scarlet
and Little John.

838
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,722
Lady Marion.

839
01:18:05,604 --> 01:18:08,356
I trust you had
an historic evening.

840
01:18:09,191 --> 01:18:10,191
For sure.

841
01:18:14,905 --> 01:18:17,949
Lady Marion Loxley. My wife.

842
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:20,076
Well played.

843
01:18:20,953 --> 01:18:24,164
A bit rash but well played
nonetheless.

844
01:18:24,373 --> 01:18:25,665
Right you are, Robin.

845
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:27,459
Sir Robert.

846
01:18:27,543 --> 01:18:29,127
- Sir Robert.
- Sir ...

847
01:18:29,754 --> 01:18:31,504
- Sir.
- Sir.

848
01:18:31,589 --> 01:18:33,256
- Sir Bob.
- Sir Robert.

849
01:18:40,598 --> 01:18:41,639
Friar.

850
01:18:43,434 --> 01:18:47,979
Ah, Marion. Good news travels 
from Peper Harow this morning.

851
01:18:48,898 --> 01:18:51,358
Sir Robert,
nice to see you again.

852
01:18:51,442 --> 01:18:55,153
You should've made yourself known when 
we met in the field. Welcome home.

853
01:18:55,863 --> 01:18:58,531
Yes, I should've.
Forgive me, Friar.

854
01:18:59,784 --> 01:19:00,784
What happens here?

855
01:19:01,285 --> 01:19:03,745
We're moving the Church's grain
to York.

856
01:19:03,829 --> 01:19:05,580
Politics out of London,
I hear.

857
01:19:05,664 --> 01:19:08,625
This is our grain.
It belongs in this soil.

858
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:11,711
Lady Marion, I but follow 
the orders of my superiors ...

859
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:14,214
and abide by their
saying and rule.

860
01:19:19,178 --> 01:19:21,679
Does His Holiness know about 
your wealth of honey?

861
01:19:23,641 --> 01:19:27,852
There are wolves in York, 
Sir Robert. Voracious wolves.

862
01:19:29,271 --> 01:19:30,980
The bees are my family.

863
01:19:31,398 --> 01:19:33,566
I'm a procreator by design.

864
01:19:34,276 --> 01:19:37,028
I'm not a churchy friar.
Never was.

865
01:19:37,863 --> 01:19:39,656
My bees give life.

866
01:19:40,324 --> 01:19:42,075
They are my life, Sir Robert.

867
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,077
Should not the Bishop be told ...

868
01:19:44,203 --> 01:19:47,330
so the clergy can spread Nottingham 
honey on Nottingham bread?

869
01:19:50,668 --> 01:19:53,545
What if the grain were
not to reach York?

870
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:58,341
Then the bees need
not be spoken of.

871
01:20:07,476 --> 01:20:10,687
I was an old maid
when Robert courted me.

872
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:15,150
I was a daughter of a respectable 
widow with a thimbleful of noble blood.

873
01:20:15,568 --> 01:20:19,320
We were wed,
and then a week later ...

874
01:20:19,697 --> 01:20:23,449
he left to join ship
for France and the Holy Lands.

875
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:26,578
And that was my married life
to a man ...

876
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:30,290
I hardly knew.

877
01:20:33,335 --> 01:20:35,753
- A good knight.
- Short, but sweet.

878
01:20:36,839 --> 01:20:39,966
I mean, he was a good knight.

879
01:20:40,551 --> 01:20:42,510
A good knight-at-arms, a soldier.

880
01:20:42,595 --> 01:20:44,929
Oh, yes,
my knight-in-arms, even so.

881
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:46,764
And I in his.

882
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:20,089
Stop! You'll break its neck.

883
01:21:33,145 --> 01:21:34,395
Marion.

884
01:21:43,447 --> 01:21:44,614
Easy.

885
01:21:48,327 --> 01:21:49,535
I'm all right.

886
01:21:51,914 --> 01:21:56,125
I can't move me legs.

887
01:21:58,504 --> 01:21:59,754
Thank you.

888
01:22:02,967 --> 01:22:04,300
My Lord?

889
01:22:17,314 --> 01:22:19,148
Oh, is it my turn now?

890
01:22:28,325 --> 01:22:29,492
Thank you.

891
01:22:31,495 --> 01:22:33,997
Nicely done, sir.

892
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:38,918
And to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs, 
beyond my wildest hopes this morning.

893
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:45,091
I don't believe
you know my husband,

894
01:22:45,551 --> 01:22:46,592
Sir Robert.

895
01:22:46,677 --> 01:22:50,263
Allow me to introduce
the Sheriff of Nottingham.

896
01:22:50,347 --> 01:22:52,098
Welcome home, Sir Robert.

897
01:22:52,182 --> 01:22:56,019
You make your mark quickly by rescuing
the King's ram from drowning.

898
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,603
What's this?

899
01:22:57,688 --> 01:23:01,899
What's mine in coin I have the 
right to take in goods or livestock.

900
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:04,902
If it's God's will.

901
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:10,992
Here's a ram's worth of tax
for the Exchequer.

902
01:23:11,076 --> 01:23:13,453
Your insolence to Lady Marion,

903
01:23:13,537 --> 01:23:15,538
I'll consider a debt between us.

904
01:23:41,648 --> 01:23:43,900
Mead and grain alcohol?

905
01:23:43,984 --> 01:23:45,860
I thought as much.

906
01:23:49,365 --> 01:23:51,699
There's something
that we need to do.

907
01:23:51,784 --> 01:23:53,534
At your service.

908
01:24:05,839 --> 01:24:07,131
All right, lads.

909
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:11,552
Should've left while you had the 
chance. Something's afoot. Off we go.

910
01:24:31,323 --> 01:24:34,992
You there! Move aside!
We're on Church business!

911
01:24:35,994 --> 01:24:37,912
None shall pass ...

912
01:24:37,996 --> 01:24:40,540
unless they can answer the riddle.

913
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:42,834
Moon-mad!

914
01:24:42,918 --> 01:24:46,587
And what is the riddle,
you insolent wretch?

915
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:51,926
What has 18 legs and
isn't going anywhere?

916
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:57,265
Your next move will be your last.

917
01:24:58,517 --> 01:24:59,767
Evening, friend.

918
01:25:01,812 --> 01:25:03,938
I demand to know who you are.

919
01:25:04,731 --> 01:25:05,815
We are men of the hood.

920
01:25:08,527 --> 01:25:10,111
Merry now, at your expense.

921
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,864
"The Lord taketh ..."

922
01:25:12,948 --> 01:25:14,323
And we shall giveth back.

923
01:25:14,408 --> 01:25:16,951
My advice is to plant it now,
by moonlight.

924
01:25:17,286 --> 01:25:18,327
Why is that, good friar?

925
01:25:18,412 --> 01:25:21,497
When it sprouts, I can claim 
it as a miracle from God.

926
01:25:21,582 --> 01:25:24,625
The Church in York would
never deny a miracle.

927
01:25:28,797 --> 01:25:30,047
How much further?

928
01:25:30,132 --> 01:25:31,549
About 11 miles.

929
01:26:21,892 --> 01:26:23,768
I thought you had left.

930
01:26:24,978 --> 01:26:26,938
The fields have been planted.

931
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,982
I didn't want to wake you.

932
01:26:30,526 --> 01:26:31,984
How did you find the seed?

933
01:26:32,903 --> 01:26:34,820
If you have to ask,
it's not a gift.

934
01:26:37,366 --> 01:26:38,866
Thank you.

935
01:27:24,496 --> 01:27:25,830
Pikemen, at the ready!

936
01:27:25,914 --> 01:27:27,248
Arms to ready!

937
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:29,333
Prepare!

938
01:27:30,127 --> 01:27:32,628
This King John
is no king of mine!

939
01:27:35,257 --> 01:27:37,008
You! Are you Baldwin?
Open these gates!

940
01:27:37,092 --> 01:27:38,843
In whose name do you
come against us?

941
01:27:38,927 --> 01:27:40,761
In the name of King John.

942
01:27:41,388 --> 01:27:43,931
Pay or burn.

943
01:27:44,016 --> 01:27:47,518
We have paid in money and men 
for King Richard's wars!

944
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:49,645
And we have no more to give!

945
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,689
- Burn it. 
- Archers!

946
01:28:11,877 --> 01:28:13,127
Come on.

947
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:26,932
My Lord, this way!

948
01:28:31,229 --> 01:28:33,230
In the name of John,

949
01:28:33,315 --> 01:28:36,400
by the Grace of God,
King of England,

950
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:41,906
let it be known to all who abide 
here that a tax is warranted!

951
01:28:47,829 --> 01:28:51,332
Those persons refusing 
to abide by the law ...

952
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:54,627
will hereby be subject
to severe punishment.

953
01:28:59,508 --> 01:29:02,510
By order
of His Majesty, King John.

954
01:29:14,022 --> 01:29:15,356
Father Tancred!

955
01:29:32,999 --> 01:29:34,458
Your Majesty.

956
01:29:37,712 --> 01:29:39,255
Your Majesty.

957
01:29:42,217 --> 01:29:44,760
I have lost the confidence
of King John,

958
01:29:45,387 --> 01:29:47,138
but he may still listen to you.

959
01:29:47,222 --> 01:29:49,473
Allow me to know better, William.

960
01:29:49,933 --> 01:29:52,143
You are much wiser than your owl.

961
01:29:52,352 --> 01:29:55,479
I dare say. I've lived longer.

962
01:29:56,815 --> 01:29:58,524
Edward, take him.

963
01:29:58,608 --> 01:29:59,692
Your Majesty.

964
01:30:03,196 --> 01:30:06,532
John is no Richard,
alas, Your Majesty.

965
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:13,330
But I serve the throne,
and the throne will endure.

966
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:19,003
Speak plainly, Marshal.
What's troubling you?

967
01:30:19,754 --> 01:30:21,755
The crown is in peril.

968
01:30:22,924 --> 01:30:26,218
Godfrey has been plotting
with Philip of France.

969
01:30:27,262 --> 01:30:29,263
French troops have already 
landed on our shores,

970
01:30:29,347 --> 01:30:32,099
and they are murdering Englishmen 
in the name of King John.

971
01:30:32,934 --> 01:30:36,937
The northern barons will make 
civil war against the throne.

972
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:40,566
Leaving our coast defenseless
against the invasion ...

973
01:30:41,276 --> 01:30:43,277
which is certainly coming.

974
01:30:45,739 --> 01:30:50,743
So it's left to John's mother to scold 
him like a child and point him to his duty.

975
01:30:56,541 --> 01:31:01,128
My son has an enemy in his court 
closer to him than any friend.

976
01:31:01,213 --> 01:31:04,798
An English traitor.
A paid agent of France.

977
01:31:05,967 --> 01:31:08,969
Why are you telling me
when you must tell the King?

978
01:31:09,054 --> 01:31:10,471
Isabella!

979
01:31:11,556 --> 01:31:13,807
It is you who must do that.

980
01:31:14,351 --> 01:31:16,644
Tell King John that you've had
word from France,

981
01:31:16,728 --> 01:31:18,479
from Philip himself, if you like.

982
01:31:18,563 --> 01:31:22,066
Why not tell him the truth?
That William Marshal ...

983
01:31:22,317 --> 01:31:26,403
Ah, a mother he mistrusts bearing 
the word of a man in dishonor?

984
01:31:26,571 --> 01:31:27,696
No.

985
01:31:28,615 --> 01:31:32,993
If you wish to be queen,
you must save John.

986
01:31:34,496 --> 01:31:35,955
And England.

987
01:31:37,415 --> 01:31:38,624
No!

988
01:31:39,501 --> 01:31:41,293
No! No!

989
01:31:44,214 --> 01:31:47,174
Godfrey! The bloody Judas!

990
01:31:47,926 --> 01:31:50,511
By the bowels of Christ,
it's a lie.

991
01:31:50,595 --> 01:31:52,429
You lie!

992
01:32:11,157 --> 01:32:13,325
I'm sorry, my love.

993
01:32:29,301 --> 01:32:31,302
- Sheriff.
- Up there.

994
01:32:35,223 --> 01:32:38,309
Man won't give his name.
Demands audience with the sheriff.

995
01:32:38,935 --> 01:32:40,102
Demands?

996
01:32:43,231 --> 01:32:44,231
Go away.

997
01:32:44,316 --> 01:32:45,399
My Lord.

998
01:33:07,505 --> 01:33:10,174
Tax collections proceed apace.

999
01:33:11,134 --> 01:33:12,926
Nottingham's turn is coming.

1000
01:33:13,261 --> 01:33:15,220
Good. Good.

1001
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:19,183
Tell Sir Godfrey that the Sheriff 
of Nottingham is his man.

1002
01:33:19,267 --> 01:33:21,977
May he put his stamp
on my authority.

1003
01:33:22,062 --> 01:33:26,857
I see trouble coming from Loxley
of Peper Harow.

1004
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:29,276
A blind old man gives you trouble?

1005
01:33:29,361 --> 01:33:31,528
Aye, and his son will give more.

1006
01:33:31,696 --> 01:33:35,908
The crusader, Robert Loxley,
has returned this past week.

1007
01:34:13,488 --> 01:34:14,697
Marion.

1008
01:35:18,428 --> 01:35:20,512
Go on! Go on.

1009
01:35:25,977 --> 01:35:27,561
Has he spoken yet?

1010
01:35:27,812 --> 01:35:28,937
He was spying, Loop.

1011
01:35:29,397 --> 01:35:30,814
Spying?

1012
01:35:32,317 --> 01:35:34,818
Robert, I'm ashamed of you.

1013
01:35:35,236 --> 01:35:36,570
Hello, Marion.

1014
01:35:36,988 --> 01:35:38,405
I've come to save you.

1015
01:35:39,699 --> 01:35:40,824
Know him?

1016
01:35:41,493 --> 01:35:46,163
Boys, this is Sir Robert Loxley,
my husband.

1017
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:49,708
Sir Robert, the runaways
of Sherwood.

1018
01:35:50,668 --> 01:35:52,002
Untie him.

1019
01:35:52,086 --> 01:35:55,881
No, I don't think spies should 
be let off so easily.

1020
01:35:56,508 --> 01:35:57,841
That was unkind.

1021
01:35:57,926 --> 01:35:59,718
You were a crusader?

1022
01:35:59,844 --> 01:36:00,928
Yes.

1023
01:36:01,012 --> 01:36:03,972
Did you hear that, boys?
You bested a crusader.

1024
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,350
My men are good fighters.

1025
01:36:06,434 --> 01:36:07,601
I don't know about that.

1026
01:36:07,685 --> 01:36:10,103
I think the weight of numbers 
might have been in their favor.

1027
01:36:10,188 --> 01:36:12,940
But they do move silently like 
the creatures of the forest.

1028
01:36:13,024 --> 01:36:15,108
But that's only a skill
if you stay as a man.

1029
01:36:15,193 --> 01:36:17,277
You don't become
the creatures you hunt.

1030
01:36:17,362 --> 01:36:18,445
We're soldiers.

1031
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:19,696
No, you're not.

1032
01:36:19,864 --> 01:36:22,908
Soldiers fight for a cause.
What's yours?

1033
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:28,121
You don't have one.
That makes you poachers.

1034
01:36:29,457 --> 01:36:32,793
Common thieves with a lot to learn.

1035
01:36:32,877 --> 01:36:33,961
Like what?

1036
01:36:34,045 --> 01:36:36,296
I could teach you how to tie knots.

1037
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:39,299
I could teach you which wood 
to get to make your bows stronger.

1038
01:36:39,384 --> 01:36:43,595
I could teach you how to make 
arrows that fly more than 20 feet.

1039
01:36:44,055 --> 01:36:47,391
And I can help Marion to teach 
you how to stay clean ...

1040
01:36:47,517 --> 01:36:49,476
so you won't get sick.

1041
01:36:49,936 --> 01:36:53,313
I don't know who you're fighting,
son, but it's not me.

1042
01:36:53,398 --> 01:36:54,565
I'm not your enemy.

1043
01:36:55,483 --> 01:36:58,569
If you want to chat,
you know where to find me.

1044
01:37:12,834 --> 01:37:13,959
Wife?

1045
01:37:21,593 --> 01:37:22,968
Marshal.

1046
01:37:23,678 --> 01:37:26,013
Stand aside!
Make way for the King!

1047
01:37:26,097 --> 01:37:27,139
Your Majesty.

1048
01:37:29,434 --> 01:37:32,311
What the devil
are you doing here? Hmm?

1049
01:37:32,437 --> 01:37:33,520
Sire?

1050
01:37:33,605 --> 01:37:36,106
Will you keep that animal still?
What's it got, palsy?

1051
01:37:38,985 --> 01:37:40,944
Do you think I haven't noticed
how you've deserted me?

1052
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:43,572
If Your Majesty recalls,
our last conversation ...

1053
01:37:43,656 --> 01:37:45,032
At our last conversation,

1054
01:37:45,116 --> 01:37:48,410
Philip of France wasn't coming 
our way with an invasion fleet.

1055
01:37:49,078 --> 01:37:50,829
Was he, Marshal?

1056
01:37:54,584 --> 01:37:56,418
My friend Godfrey ...

1057
01:37:57,337 --> 01:37:59,880
is not the friend I thought he was.

1058
01:38:00,965 --> 01:38:03,717
He's stirred up the northern 
barons against me.

1059
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,595
They come south with an army.

1060
01:38:08,264 --> 01:38:10,682
Marshal, how dare they?
How dare they?

1061
01:38:10,767 --> 01:38:13,602
Sire, forgotten men
are dangerous men.

1062
01:38:15,772 --> 01:38:18,357
The barons need to be told ...

1063
01:38:18,941 --> 01:38:22,361
that when the French come,
we are all Englishmen.

1064
01:38:23,446 --> 01:38:24,780
Fitzrobert.

1065
01:38:24,864 --> 01:38:26,114
Baldwin.

1066
01:38:26,783 --> 01:38:29,826
We'll make an army of the 
north and march on London.

1067
01:38:30,662 --> 01:38:32,120
The barons need leadership.

1068
01:38:33,122 --> 01:38:37,000
Wiser kings know they must 
let men look them in the eye,

1069
01:38:37,877 --> 01:38:39,795
hear their voice.

1070
01:38:40,463 --> 01:38:43,799
Together, let us ride
north to meet them.

1071
01:38:46,803 --> 01:38:49,513
They march against
their king, Marshal.

1072
01:38:51,766 --> 01:38:53,141
Their king.

1073
01:38:54,727 --> 01:38:58,438
We will meet them with the pikes 
of our militia in their gizzards.

1074
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:01,650
You have lost your touch, Marshal.

1075
01:39:03,903 --> 01:39:06,321
Perhaps we'll look to
the barons without you.

1076
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,627
Saddle up with a spare horse.
I leave immediately.

1077
01:39:20,712 --> 01:39:22,254
I want to know
where to find Godfrey.

1078
01:39:22,338 --> 01:39:23,672
My Lord.

1079
01:39:38,813 --> 01:39:40,230
I found him, My Lord.

1080
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:41,398
Where?

1081
01:39:41,482 --> 01:39:45,736
Nottingham. In plain sight, 
living as Walter Loxley's son.

1082
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:53,702
Then we go to Nottingham.

1083
01:39:54,203 --> 01:39:57,205
Take no prisoners.
Leave no stone un-scorched.

1084
01:40:00,668 --> 01:40:02,210
Take two men, four horses.

1085
01:40:02,545 --> 01:40:06,548
Ride hard for the coast, then on to 
Paris and give a message to the King.

1086
01:40:24,567 --> 01:40:26,860
I'll make the place famous.

1087
01:40:30,364 --> 01:40:31,865
Come, Allan!

1088
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:35,076
I'll get them drinking.
You get them dancing!

1089
01:40:35,161 --> 01:40:36,244
All right.

1090
01:41:07,235 --> 01:41:12,322
Music, laughter, the crackle
of a bonfire and a roasting pig.

1091
01:41:12,657 --> 01:41:16,159
Life has returned.
You have returned it, Robin.

1092
01:43:16,405 --> 01:43:18,365
How did you know it was me?

1093
01:43:18,449 --> 01:43:22,035
Who else would sit
by me uninvited ...

1094
01:43:22,828 --> 01:43:25,455
like a friend from the old days?

1095
01:43:25,998 --> 01:43:27,666
How are you, William?

1096
01:43:28,459 --> 01:43:31,294
I'm well and troubled.

1097
01:43:31,379 --> 01:43:33,880
Ah. And what brings you?

1098
01:43:34,131 --> 01:43:37,008
I'm riding on to
Barnsdale tonight.

1099
01:43:37,176 --> 01:43:41,388
I've heard something of the barons' 
anger against the crown's tax collector ...

1100
01:43:41,472 --> 01:43:43,890
The anger has turned into action.

1101
01:43:44,058 --> 01:43:46,142
They assemble to march
against the King.

1102
01:43:46,477 --> 01:43:48,812
You think you can persuade 
the barons to turn back?

1103
01:43:48,896 --> 01:43:49,980
Turn back, no.

1104
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:55,151
To join King John
against a French invasion.

1105
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,488
- A what?
- Help me, Walter.

1106
01:43:58,823 --> 01:44:00,782
I cannot go with you.

1107
01:44:01,742 --> 01:44:03,451
I cannot speak for this king.

1108
01:44:03,536 --> 01:44:05,120
He is the only king we have.

1109
01:44:05,204 --> 01:44:06,621
But not the only hope.

1110
01:44:07,707 --> 01:44:08,873
Explain.

1111
01:44:10,459 --> 01:44:11,501
Marion.

1112
01:44:11,585 --> 01:44:12,669
I'm here, Walter.

1113
01:44:13,004 --> 01:44:15,255
This is my old friend,
William Marshal.

1114
01:44:15,339 --> 01:44:17,841
Lady Marion Loxley, my son's wife.

1115
01:44:17,925 --> 01:44:20,760
Lady, I was glad to see Sir Robert 
when he disembarked in London.

1116
01:44:20,845 --> 01:44:23,346
I think you know better, Marshal.

1117
01:44:23,431 --> 01:44:28,184
Sir William, I know, would like 
to meet Robin Longstride again.

1118
01:44:39,363 --> 01:44:40,780
We've met before.

1119
01:44:40,865 --> 01:44:43,283
Yes, Sir, I know. In London.

1120
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:47,537
No, when you were a child.

1121
01:44:49,373 --> 01:44:51,041
Hobby-horse age.

1122
01:44:51,792 --> 01:44:55,712
Sir Walter and I returned from 
the Holy Land to fetch you home.

1123
01:44:56,213 --> 01:44:57,464
But you'd gone.

1124
01:44:57,548 --> 01:45:00,717
We had lost
Thomas Longstride's son.

1125
01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:06,806
It was a wound that never healed.

1126
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:16,733
You need to know what I know.

1127
01:45:17,735 --> 01:45:20,695
Your father was a stonemason.

1128
01:45:21,906 --> 01:45:23,907
Is that pleasing to you?

1129
01:45:26,118 --> 01:45:28,244
Yes. It is.

1130
01:45:28,996 --> 01:45:32,081
But he was more than that.
He was a visionary.

1131
01:45:32,917 --> 01:45:34,584
What did he see?

1132
01:45:35,169 --> 01:45:37,629
That kings have a need
of their subjects ...

1133
01:45:37,922 --> 01:45:41,758
no less than their subjects
have need of kings.

1134
01:45:41,842 --> 01:45:43,510
A dangerous idea.

1135
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:47,347
Your father was a philosopher.
He had a way of speaking ...

1136
01:45:47,431 --> 01:45:50,558
that took you by the ears
and by the heart.

1137
01:45:50,976 --> 01:45:53,603
None of these things
can be written down, Robin.

1138
01:45:53,938 --> 01:45:56,689
You must commit them
to your very soul.

1139
01:45:57,441 --> 01:45:59,067
This is the science of memory.

1140
01:45:59,777 --> 01:46:05,156
"Rise and rise again
until lambs become lions."

1141
01:46:07,618 --> 01:46:12,622
Finally, hundreds listened, 
thousands, who took up his call ...

1142
01:46:13,082 --> 01:46:16,167
for the rights of all ranks
from baron to serf.

1143
01:46:19,296 --> 01:46:20,964
"Rise and rise again ...

1144
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:25,468
until lambs become lions."

1145
01:46:30,558 --> 01:46:32,392
What happened to him?

1146
01:46:33,227 --> 01:46:34,769
Close your eyes.

1147
01:46:41,151 --> 01:46:45,363
Foundation is set on the rights 
of liberty for all people!

1148
01:46:49,994 --> 01:46:53,413
Longstride, give up the charter
and their names!

1149
01:46:53,664 --> 01:46:55,164
You were there.

1150
01:46:55,499 --> 01:46:56,749
You saw it.

1151
01:47:00,004 --> 01:47:01,421
I will not.

1152
01:47:25,613 --> 01:47:26,988
Not dead.

1153
01:47:28,449 --> 01:47:33,870
Not now.

1154
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:41,920
Here is my copy
of the main contract.

1155
01:47:42,338 --> 01:47:45,840
This charter of rights
was written by your father.

1156
01:47:45,925 --> 01:47:49,969
And here are ... There are the names 
of all the barons that signed the charter.

1157
01:47:50,054 --> 01:47:53,097
Fitzrobert, Baldwin,
Marshal and myself.

1158
01:47:53,974 --> 01:47:57,268
What he wanted was a charter
for every man ...

1159
01:47:57,353 --> 01:47:58,436
Wait there.

1160
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,896
to have the same rights.

1161
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,481
- Sir Walter?
- Huh?

1162
01:48:01,565 --> 01:48:03,107
A messenger for you.

1163
01:48:03,192 --> 01:48:04,734
Bring him in.

1164
01:48:05,402 --> 01:48:06,694
Step forward, sir.

1165
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:09,489
My Lord.

1166
01:48:09,573 --> 01:48:10,782
I'm listening.

1167
01:48:10,866 --> 01:48:12,951
Peterborough's been burned
by the King's men.

1168
01:48:13,661 --> 01:48:16,496
Fitzrobert gathers an army
to slay King John in London.

1169
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:19,749
Marshal requests your presence 
at counsel in Barnsdale.

1170
01:48:21,752 --> 01:48:23,670
Wait outside, will you?

1171
01:48:25,381 --> 01:48:27,757
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

1172
01:48:28,968 --> 01:48:31,344
The time for pretense is over.

1173
01:48:32,972 --> 01:48:35,682
Now, hold me like a son.

1174
01:48:43,107 --> 01:48:44,148
Go.

1175
01:48:45,734 --> 01:48:48,444
Maggie. Where's my lady?

1176
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:50,113
I could not find her, sir.

1177
01:49:16,306 --> 01:49:20,977
Whether we fight for our lives, 
our family and our honor,

1178
01:49:21,186 --> 01:49:22,979
we must fight till the death.

1179
01:49:23,981 --> 01:49:26,816
You've spent too long
in the palace, William.

1180
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:30,236
Spending time in the palace
gives me perspective.

1181
01:49:31,363 --> 01:49:32,822
As we speak,

1182
01:49:34,116 --> 01:49:36,868
King Philip sails for our coast.

1183
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:42,373
Godfrey and his
marauders are French!

1184
01:49:44,084 --> 01:49:46,961
Every minute that
we waste in disunity ...

1185
01:49:47,046 --> 01:49:50,298
brings closer the destruction
of our country!

1186
01:49:50,758 --> 01:49:52,425
We have been bled ...

1187
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,845
by the King long before Godfrey.

1188
01:49:56,221 --> 01:49:59,015
Go back to London 
and tell the King ...

1189
01:49:59,725 --> 01:50:03,478
that we will meet him
on a field of his choice.

1190
01:50:03,562 --> 01:50:04,604
Make way!

1191
01:50:04,688 --> 01:50:07,315
We will not fight
to save John's crown.

1192
01:50:08,358 --> 01:50:10,610
Rather let him
bend the knee to us.

1193
01:50:11,695 --> 01:50:14,030
I'll give you more, Sir Baldwin.

1194
01:50:15,491 --> 01:50:17,533
My breast for your sword point.

1195
01:50:19,536 --> 01:50:20,870
Use mine.

1196
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:26,459
Go on.

1197
01:50:27,878 --> 01:50:29,045
No?

1198
01:50:29,546 --> 01:50:33,508
Oh. This is what you want, 
isn't it? This is what he wants.

1199
01:50:33,592 --> 01:50:37,553
Fine, I'd rather give it to you 
than have it taken by the French.

1200
01:50:38,555 --> 01:50:40,807
You mistake me, Sire.

1201
01:50:40,974 --> 01:50:44,602
I have no right and no ambition
to wear the crown.

1202
01:50:45,479 --> 01:50:47,980
But let the rightful
wearer beware.

1203
01:50:48,398 --> 01:50:52,485
From now we will be subject only to 
laws that we have a hand in making.

1204
01:50:52,569 --> 01:50:57,323
We are not sheep to be made 
mutton of by your butchers.

1205
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:02,787
Godfrey set himself
to turn you against me.

1206
01:51:02,871 --> 01:51:06,040
Then he did more than was needed
to accomplish that.

1207
01:51:10,587 --> 01:51:12,755
A very important decision.

1208
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:17,009
Don't you think that we've paid 
too much taxes for far too long...

1209
01:52:25,162 --> 01:52:26,704
This is where I was born.

1210
01:52:41,136 --> 01:52:42,970
What does it mean?

1211
01:52:43,055 --> 01:52:44,555
It means never give up.

1212
01:52:46,016 --> 01:52:50,519
We will not be loyal to a crown
that robs and starves us!

1213
01:52:50,687 --> 01:52:54,106
The King must listen
to what we have to say!

1214
01:52:54,191 --> 01:52:58,986
A king does not bargain for the 
loyalty that every subject owes him.

1215
01:52:59,238 --> 01:53:03,783
Without loyalty there is no 
kingdom. There is nothing.

1216
01:53:05,244 --> 01:53:07,286
I'm here to speak
for Sir Walter Loxley.

1217
01:53:09,456 --> 01:53:11,666
- Let the man speak.
- Let him speak!

1218
01:53:12,751 --> 01:53:14,126
- Speak!
- Speak!

1219
01:53:14,795 --> 01:53:16,963
Speak, if you must.

1220
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:21,384
If you're trying to
build for the future,

1221
01:53:22,052 --> 01:53:24,595
you must set your 
foundation strong.

1222
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:30,893
The laws of this land
enslave people to its king,

1223
01:53:32,562 --> 01:53:36,816
a king who demands loyalty
but offers nothing in return.

1224
01:53:38,402 --> 01:53:41,237
I have marched from France ...

1225
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:43,864
to Palestine and back.

1226
01:53:44,825 --> 01:53:46,242
And I know ...

1227
01:53:46,868 --> 01:53:49,996
in tyranny lies only failure.

1228
01:53:51,581 --> 01:53:54,125
You build a country
like you build a cathedral,

1229
01:53:54,209 --> 01:53:55,501
from the ground up.

1230
01:53:56,753 --> 01:53:58,879
Empower every man ...

1231
01:53:59,756 --> 01:54:01,299
and you will gain strength.

1232
01:54:01,925 --> 01:54:03,175
Hmm.

1233
01:54:03,719 --> 01:54:06,804
Well, who could object
to such reasonable words?

1234
01:54:09,266 --> 01:54:12,935
If Your Majesty
were to offer justice,

1235
01:54:14,146 --> 01:54:16,480
justice in the form of
a charter of liberties,

1236
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:20,943
allowing every man to
forage for his hearth,

1237
01:54:21,611 --> 01:54:25,197
to be safe from
conviction without cause ...

1238
01:54:25,282 --> 01:54:27,283
or prison without charge,

1239
01:54:27,951 --> 01:54:32,079
to work, eat and live on the 
sweat of his own brow ...

1240
01:54:33,123 --> 01:54:34,832
and be as merry as he can...

1241
01:54:34,916 --> 01:54:36,584
Sir, Godfrey's men
are on to Nottingham.

1242
01:54:36,835 --> 01:54:39,754
... then that king would be great.

1243
01:54:40,255 --> 01:54:44,091
Not only would he receive
the loyalty of his people ...

1244
01:54:45,385 --> 01:54:46,886
but their love, as well.

1245
01:54:48,472 --> 01:54:51,140
So what would you have? Hmm?

1246
01:54:51,224 --> 01:54:52,975
Castle for every man?

1247
01:54:55,312 --> 01:54:57,480
Every Englishman's
home is his castle.

1248
01:54:58,899 --> 01:55:01,650
What we would ask, Your Majesty,

1249
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:04,570
is liberty.

1250
01:55:04,905 --> 01:55:07,031
Liberty by law!

1251
01:55:08,992 --> 01:55:11,327
Your Majesty, My Lords,

1252
01:55:12,037 --> 01:55:14,705
the French fleet
is in the Channel.

1253
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:19,794
Sire, you have a chance to unify 
your subjects high and low.

1254
01:55:21,505 --> 01:55:23,214
It falls on your nod.

1255
01:55:23,965 --> 01:55:25,925
I only have to nod?

1256
01:55:30,013 --> 01:55:31,597
I can do better than that.

1257
01:55:34,184 --> 01:55:35,851
I give my word ...

1258
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:39,605
that such a charter
will be written.

1259
01:55:39,689 --> 01:55:43,025
On my mother's life,
I swear it.

1260
01:55:48,156 --> 01:55:51,534
Godfrey makes for Nottingham.
I must stay with the King.

1261
01:55:51,618 --> 01:55:53,661
I will send Baldwin
and Fitzrobert with you.

1262
01:55:53,745 --> 01:55:57,540
We will meet again at the White 
Horse when you are finished.

1263
01:55:57,624 --> 01:56:00,668
Robin, your father was a great man.

1264
01:56:01,962 --> 01:56:04,213
And you are your father's son.

1265
01:56:15,183 --> 01:56:16,725
Maggie, who's at the house?

1266
01:56:18,395 --> 01:56:19,603
Long live the King!

1267
01:56:55,807 --> 01:56:56,849
Gentlemen.

1268
01:57:11,698 --> 01:57:13,782
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1269
01:57:18,872 --> 01:57:20,623
I'm French on my mother's side.

1270
01:57:41,978 --> 01:57:44,855
Sir Walter! Sir Walter!

1271
01:57:53,031 --> 01:57:54,323
Loxley!

1272
01:57:54,574 --> 01:57:56,242
Show yourself!

1273
01:57:58,370 --> 01:57:59,662
Loxley!

1274
01:58:02,624 --> 01:58:03,874
Who calls here?

1275
01:58:04,542 --> 01:58:06,502
I call for Robert Loxley.

1276
01:58:06,753 --> 01:58:08,712
My son is not here
to answer you.

1277
01:58:08,838 --> 01:58:10,130
That is the truth.

1278
01:58:10,507 --> 01:58:12,091
Because he's dead
in a French ditch.

1279
01:58:14,511 --> 01:58:15,886
And who are you, sir,
to say so?

1280
01:58:17,722 --> 01:58:19,265
Who am I?

1281
01:58:27,732 --> 01:58:28,899
I'm the one who killed him.

1282
01:58:31,528 --> 01:58:33,028
Fight me if you dare.

1283
01:58:34,155 --> 01:58:35,572
Lord have mercy.

1284
01:59:24,039 --> 01:59:26,081
Leave it on the table.
Leave it! Next!

1285
01:59:27,042 --> 01:59:28,709
Next! Come on!

1286
01:59:30,503 --> 01:59:32,212
- Name?
- Loxley.

1287
01:59:32,630 --> 01:59:34,256
Christian name?

1288
01:59:34,507 --> 01:59:35,924
Marion.

1289
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:38,469
Land?

1290
01:59:38,636 --> 01:59:40,429
5,000 acres.

1291
01:59:41,431 --> 01:59:43,182
Lady Marion Loxley?

1292
01:59:43,892 --> 01:59:45,476
I am.

1293
02:00:14,672 --> 02:00:17,758
Gentlemen, enjoy!

1294
02:00:51,209 --> 02:00:53,127
No one should have 4,000 acres.

1295
02:00:53,211 --> 02:00:55,212
5,000 acres.

1296
02:02:33,603 --> 02:02:35,604
Baldwin! Fitzrobert!

1297
02:02:35,688 --> 02:02:38,190
Take the southern flank
and circle in from the west.

1298
02:02:38,816 --> 02:02:41,401
Will and Allan, get on the 
rooftops and pick your targets.

1299
02:03:02,757 --> 02:03:04,174
Lady Marion.

1300
02:03:25,989 --> 02:03:27,030
Quickly.

1301
02:03:53,057 --> 02:03:54,558
Follow me.

1302
02:04:16,456 --> 02:04:20,751
Somebody, please take the baby!
Save the baby, please!

1303
02:04:30,136 --> 02:04:31,762
John, down!

1304
02:04:38,019 --> 02:04:39,186
It's all right.

1305
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:40,437
Go around.

1306
02:04:40,521 --> 02:04:41,772
Stand back!

1307
02:04:43,608 --> 02:04:44,649
Make way!

1308
02:04:45,777 --> 02:04:49,905
Hurry. It's all right. It's all 
right. Please, hurry! Hurry!

1309
02:05:01,584 --> 02:05:02,709
Sword!

1310
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,564
Get down, you bastard French dogs!

1311
02:06:14,824 --> 02:06:18,076
Where will King Philip
land and when?

1312
02:06:31,924 --> 02:06:33,884
This is my last arrow.

1313
02:06:35,761 --> 02:06:39,431
Dungeness! Dungeness. Two days.

1314
02:06:43,436 --> 02:06:45,979
There we have it. We have two days.

1315
02:08:12,608 --> 02:08:15,193
Once before I said goodbye to
a man going to war.

1316
02:08:16,153 --> 02:08:17,487
He never came back.

1317
02:08:23,869 --> 02:08:25,245
Ask me nicely.

1318
02:09:00,281 --> 02:09:01,573
I love you, Marion.

1319
02:11:26,427 --> 02:11:27,635
Longstride!

1320
02:11:58,918 --> 02:12:00,752
What news of Walter
and Nottingham?

1321
02:12:02,004 --> 02:12:04,589
Sir Walter is dead.
Godfrey's hand.

1322
02:12:04,673 --> 02:12:07,425
Gentlemen, we go to war.

1323
02:12:07,635 --> 02:12:10,345
It is my first time.
I shall lead.

1324
02:12:10,429 --> 02:12:12,472
Forward!

1325
02:13:52,573 --> 02:13:54,198
That's a lot of French.

1326
02:13:56,577 --> 02:13:58,202
What's to be done?

1327
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:00,705
Archers to the cliff top.

1328
02:14:01,707 --> 02:14:04,375
Cavalry to the beach.
We'll await you there.

1329
02:14:04,752 --> 02:14:05,793
With me!

1330
02:14:05,878 --> 02:14:07,045
Archers!

1331
02:14:09,381 --> 02:14:11,174
Excellent plan.

1332
02:14:32,863 --> 02:14:34,072
Cavalry!

1333
02:14:46,293 --> 02:14:47,752
Ready!

1334
02:15:07,356 --> 02:15:08,815
Raise arrows!

1335
02:15:08,899 --> 02:15:10,191
Raise arrows!

1336
02:15:11,151 --> 02:15:12,235
Ready!

1337
02:15:15,948 --> 02:15:17,824
Raise arrows!

1338
02:15:18,242 --> 02:15:20,118
- Release!
- Release!

1339
02:15:32,631 --> 02:15:33,715
Release!

1340
02:16:10,836 --> 02:16:12,086
For the love of God, Marion!

1341
02:16:16,467 --> 02:16:17,800
Loxley,

1342
02:16:18,135 --> 02:16:21,054
circle your troops
and then join the charge.

1343
02:16:26,185 --> 02:16:27,310
With me!

1344
02:16:32,191 --> 02:16:33,316
Release!

1345
02:16:44,536 --> 02:16:45,578
Release!

1346
02:17:33,168 --> 02:17:35,378
Forward!

1347
02:17:53,355 --> 02:17:54,939
Archers, forward!

1348
02:18:22,009 --> 02:18:23,801
Let's go, Marshal.

1349
02:18:23,886 --> 02:18:25,011
We're close enough, Sire.

1350
02:18:26,054 --> 02:18:27,889
This was not close
enough for Richard.

1351
02:18:27,973 --> 02:18:29,807
And look what happened to him.

1352
02:18:30,851 --> 02:18:31,893
Forward!

1353
02:18:32,936 --> 02:18:34,312
Protect the King!

1354
02:19:05,594 --> 02:19:07,386
This is for you, Walter.

1355
02:19:20,484 --> 02:19:23,486
No!

1356
02:19:30,786 --> 02:19:32,036
Marion!

1357
02:21:15,432 --> 02:21:16,891
Marion!

1358
02:21:44,377 --> 02:21:45,961
Surrender!

1359
02:22:08,568 --> 02:22:10,528
Sire! Sire!

1360
02:22:10,862 --> 02:22:12,947
They've surrendered, Sire!

1361
02:22:13,281 --> 02:22:15,449
Yes! To whom?

1362
02:22:19,329 --> 02:22:20,496
To him.

1363
02:22:20,580 --> 02:22:22,456
Longstride!

1364
02:22:24,126 --> 02:22:39,139
Longstride!

1365
02:23:17,012 --> 02:23:19,346
I did not make myself king.

1366
02:23:22,058 --> 02:23:23,267
God did.

1367
02:23:24,352 --> 02:23:26,353
King by divine right.

1368
02:23:27,647 --> 02:23:30,900
Now you come to me
with this document,

1369
02:23:32,444 --> 02:23:36,196
seeking to limit the authority
given to me by God!

1370
02:23:36,281 --> 02:23:38,782
Sire, you gave your word!

1371
02:23:38,867 --> 02:23:40,034
No.

1372
02:23:40,118 --> 02:23:42,119
Sire, you give us our word, Sire!

1373
02:23:42,203 --> 02:23:44,121
Did I command you to speak, sir?

1374
02:23:44,205 --> 02:23:45,205
John ...

1375
02:23:45,290 --> 02:23:46,540
Or you, madam?

1376
02:23:46,625 --> 02:23:48,375
Sire, we looked to you!

1377
02:23:48,793 --> 02:23:51,712
Look to your estates, instead.

1378
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:56,342
Archers!

1379
02:23:57,052 --> 02:24:00,220
You are fortunate that I am in
a merciful mood.

1380
02:24:01,389 --> 02:24:05,768
But as for Robin Longstride,
that mason's son,

1381
02:24:06,937 --> 02:24:11,273
for the crimes of theft and 
incitement to cause unrest,

1382
02:24:11,358 --> 02:24:15,235
who pretended to be a knight of the 
realm, a crime punishable by death,

1383
02:24:15,737 --> 02:24:20,658
I declare him, from this day 
forth, to be an outlaw!

1384
02:24:22,577 --> 02:24:26,205
To be hunted all the days
of his life ...

1385
02:24:26,289 --> 02:24:28,123
We will not stand for this!

1386
02:24:28,208 --> 02:24:30,334
until his corpse, unburied, 
is carrion ...

1387
02:24:30,418 --> 02:24:33,128
for foxes and crows!

1388
02:24:56,194 --> 02:24:57,987
Hear me! Hear me!

1389
02:25:01,116 --> 02:25:02,825
By royal decree,

1390
02:25:03,410 --> 02:25:06,745
Robin Longstride, also known as
Robin of the Hood,

1391
02:25:07,205 --> 02:25:10,290
and all who shelter him
or aid him ...

1392
02:25:10,375 --> 02:25:12,042
are declared outlaws
of the realm,

1393
02:25:13,294 --> 02:25:14,878
Their properties forfeit,

1394
02:25:14,963 --> 02:25:19,133
and their lives shall be taken 
by any Englishman on sight.

1395
02:25:25,098 --> 02:25:27,808
A nail please?
And a hammer.

1396
02:25:28,518 --> 02:25:29,601
A nail!

1397
02:26:20,737 --> 02:26:23,030
Off you go. Come on.

1398
02:26:23,948 --> 02:26:25,115
Hey, boys.

1399
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:27,117
You've been practicing 
tying your knots?

1400
02:26:27,202 --> 02:26:29,036
Have you been shooting
your bow and arrows?

1401
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:30,704
Who hit something? Anyone?

1402
02:26:30,789 --> 02:26:33,624
The greenwood is the 
outlaw's friend.

1403
02:26:33,708 --> 02:26:36,460
Now, the orphan boys
make us welcome.

1404
02:26:37,378 --> 02:26:38,754
No tax, no tithe.

1405
02:26:38,838 --> 02:26:43,258
Nobody rich, nobody poor. Fair 
shares for all at nature's table.

1406
02:26:43,551 --> 02:26:47,721
Many wrongs to be righted
in the country of King John.

1407
02:26:51,059 --> 02:26:53,227
Watch over us, Walter.

1408
02:29:52,699 --> 02:29:54,199
For the Lion Heart!
