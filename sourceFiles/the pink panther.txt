1
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300
As in every stone of this size,
there is a flaw.

2
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,000
- A flaw?
- The slightest flaw, Your Excellency.

3
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,700
If you look deep into the stone,

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,100
you will perceive
the tiniest discoloration.

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,800
It resembles an animal.

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,700
- An animal?
- A leaping panther.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes. A pink panther.

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,600
Come here, Dala.

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,300
A gift for your father
from his grateful people.

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,300
Someday it will be yours.

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,300
The most fabulous diamond
in all the world.

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Come closer.

13
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,900
Okay. Thanks a lot, fellas.
Don't forget to take the wardrobe back.

14
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,900
How do you want them,
matte or glossy?

15
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,900
I want it right away.
I'm in a hurry.

16
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,900
You can't rush a genius.

17
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,200
I'll rush.

18
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Don't forget
about the wardrobe.

19
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,500
What you doing?

20
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,600
Where is everybody?

21
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,900
- Come out of there!
- Who is it?

22
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Come out,
or we'll bust the door in!

23
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,100
Just a minute.

24
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
- Can I help you?
- Where is he?

25
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
- Where's who?
- George Litton.

26
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,900
He owes me 40 grand,
and nobody welshes on Big Joe.

27
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,900
Look, Big Joe,
I'm not a bill collector.

28
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,700
I'm a photographer.
Just took his picture.

29
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,200
- What kind of a picture?
- Graduation picture.

30
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,100
- His what?
- Graduation.

31
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,300
Get him!

32
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,400
They're worth half a million.
We'll settle for 300,000.

33
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,200
I'll do what I can,
but the merchandise is extremely hot.

34
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,900
You stay here.
Come with me.

35
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Come on!

36
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,900
- Pardon, madame.
- Certainly.

37
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,900
She's gone down.
Come on!

38
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
We must find that woman.

39
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
What did you say?

40
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,600
We don't have
much of a description.

41
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,800
About 5'7", black hair,
wearing a light beige coat.

42
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,900
The fools let that fence escape.
He might have talked.

43
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
- We will catch him.
- We must.

44
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,300
We must find that woman.

45
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,100
She is our first positive link
with the Phantom.

46
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,900
- Yes?
- <i>Your wife to see you, Inspector.</i>

47
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,600
Send her in, please.
Henri, that will be all.

48
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,100
- Hello, my darling.
- My angel.

49
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,100
Amber, how are you?

50
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Hello, Duchess.
So glad you could come.

51
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,200
Have fun, children.
How are you?

52
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,100
Hello, darling!

53
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,700
You know Monica?

54
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,500
Of course. You were
simply stunning in your last film.

55
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,700
- What's he say?
- He says hello,

56
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,700
and he would like you
to meet his cousin.

57
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,600
- His third cousin.
- That does make a difference.

58
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,900
- Who is that?
- Princess Dala.

59
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,900
Excuse me.

60
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,300
Yes?

61
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
Miss Angela Dunning.

62
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,700
- Yes?
- Your Highness?

63
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Yes.

64
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,900
Here I am again,
Your Highness.

65
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I was having a cocktail party,
and I saw you driving by...

66
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,500
I just know you'd enjoy it.
Yes, you'd just love it...

67
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,200
Your Highness.

68
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Hello there.

69
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,300
I can't tell you
what an honor this is.

70
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,800
Everyone's just dying to meet you.

71
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Good morning.

72
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,600
- You're a wonderful skier.
- Thank you.

73
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,600
Help!

74
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,900
Somebody's taking my sleigh.
Amber! My dog.

75
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,700
Leave this to me, ma'am.

76
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
- What happened?
- I don't know.

77
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,500
There was a man with a gun,
and he took the sleigh and Amber.

78
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,100
We'll only be here a few days.

79
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,300
It will be a wonderful chance
for a beautiful vacation.

80
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Excuse me.
My leg is caught.

81
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,300
I apologize
for this inconvenience.

82
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,300
Do you know who that was?
That was Sir Charles Litton.

83
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,300
- Really?
- Yes.

84
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I am Inspector Clouseau.
This is Madame Clouseau.

85
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,200
All right. Thank you.

86
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,300
I'm sorry, my darling.

87
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,200
- It's all right, my darling.
- Excuse me.

88
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Do you know that
you're really amazing?

89
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,900
So you've said.

90
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,900
How you can manage
on a police inspector's salary.

91
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,700
How many women could save
enough out of their housekeeping

92
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,500
to buy such a beautiful
mink coat as this?

93
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,300
It's not easy.

94
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
You are a constant
and desirable contradiction.

95
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm simply
a woman in love, my darling.

96
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,800
My darling.

97
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,400
I'm sorry, my darling.
Please excuse me.

98
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,700
It's all right.

99
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,000
Did I hurt you?
Are you all right?

100
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,800
- Yes, I'm fine.
- You sure?

101
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,300
- Yes, I am.
- My darling, I'm so sorry.

102
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,000
I have a little business
to conclude with the manager.

103
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Yes?

104
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,400
After which, I'll return
to you immediately.

105
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,500
Bye, darling.

106
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
It's all right.

107
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,500
- How did it go?
- Perfectly.

108
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Come in.

109
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,400
Princess Dala
is concerned about your injuries.

110
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,000
Please thank the princess.

111
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,500
Tell her there’s nothing
to be concerned about.

112
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,500
It's really not too serious.

113
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,700
In that case, Her Highness
has instructed me

114
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
to invite you for dinner
this evening, 8:00 at her chalet.

115
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,800
I'd be delighted to come.

116
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,700
You know <i>Signor</i> Tucker
from Lloyd's of London.

117
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,100
- Hello.
- Hello, old bean.

118
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,100
Your company
insures the Pink Panther.

119
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,400
Yes, for half a million.

120
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,200
- Pounds?
- Sterling.

121
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,500
The Phantom could not resist
the Pink Panther.

122
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
He will most certainly
make an attempt.

123
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,400
When he does, I shall
be waiting for him. Excuse me.

124
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,900
If I understand your theory,

125
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
the Phantom is
one of Miss Dunning's guests.

126
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,100
That is the theory.
I would like to have from you

127
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,000
the names of those guests,
also the location of their rooms.

128
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,500
Of course!

129
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,200
I assume that the Princess Dala
has the jewel with her.

130
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,700
She'd only tell me
it was in a safe place.

131
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,700
I suppose if it isn't here,
it's at her villa in Rome.

132
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,700
My men are watching that villa.

133
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,700
With such planning,
how can the Phantom succeed?

134
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
With such planning,
he's succeeded for 20 years.

135
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,300
It's a mistake to underestimate him,
as the inspector can tell you.

136
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,300
The shrewdest, most ingenious
criminal in all the world.

137
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,300
- And you have never seen him?
- I've seen him once.

138
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,700
Five years ago,
got a fleeting glimpse...

139
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,200
Excuse me.

140
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,500
Got a fleeting glimpse of him
as he made his getaway.

141
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,700
In a strange way,
I admire that man.

142
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,700
He has... how would you say...
a unique flair for the dramatic.

143
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,100
- He waved good-bye to me.
- Fascinating.

144
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,300
But this time, gentlemen,
I shall be waving good-bye to him...

145
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,300
on his way to prison.

146
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,200
Good evening.

147
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,600
Make yourself comfortable.
Her Highness will join you in a moment.

148
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,500
- May I give you a drink?
- I'd like a brandy, thank you.

149
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
Your Highness.

150
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,300
Good evening, Sir Charles.

151
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,500
Any news from the police
about your dear little dog?

152
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,800
They expect I'll receive
a ransom note.

153
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,800
I am deeply grateful
for what you tried to do.

154
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,100
Ma'am, it was nothing.

155
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Thank you.

156
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,700
- Please sit down.
- Aren't you drinking?

157
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,900
- I don't drink.
- Not ever?

158
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,300
I'm quite content with reality.
I have no need for escape.

159
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,300
I enjoy reality
as much as the next man.

160
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,700
In my case, fortunately,

161
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
reality includes a good,
stiff belt every now and then.

162
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,200
- On the other hand, I don't smoke.
- You're right. It's a nasty habit.

163
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,400
Here's to those nasty little habits
that we hold so dear.

164
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

165
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,500
I beg your pardon?

166
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,300
Let's just say
in this case, it means...

167
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,100
your health and thank you
for inviting me to dinner.

168
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,200
It's not often I have the chance
to dine alone with a beautiful princess.

169
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,400
I hate to disappoint you,
but I'm afraid this isn't the night.

170
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,200
- But I understood that...
- We're having dinner, but not alone.

171
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,200
At last! Hello!

172
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,200
We've been through icicles
up to our you-know-whats!

173
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,600
Your Highness!

174
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,000
I think it's too darling of you
to invite me here tonight.

175
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,800
- You've made Cortina for me.
- Hello, lover.

176
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
Hello, dear boy.

177
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Don't you move a muscle, darling.

178
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,300
Isn't he wonderful, Your Highness?

179
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,000
Such a magnificent sacrifice.

180
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,400
Good evening, sir.

181
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,000
May I have a cigarette,
my darling?

182
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Yes, of course, my darling.

183
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,300
- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

184
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,300
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch on the rocks.

185
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

186
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,000
Thank you very much.

187
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,800
I'm looking for my uncle,
Sir Charles Litton.

188
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,600
- Darling.
- May I get you some water?

189
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,300
- Hold your hands over your head.
- Yes, my darling. Bend forward.

190
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,500
- Darling, I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

191
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,100
Are you all right, my darling?

192
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,900
What?

193
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
- My darling?
- I'll be right back.

194
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
Yes, darling.

195
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Please.

196
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,500
She's got a cough
in her throat, you know.

197
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,600
And what do you think?
She turned out to be a man!

198
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,800
It's true! It's quite true!

199
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,100
Your Highness, you really must
let me give you a party.

200
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,700
I can positively guarantee
it'll be a party to end all parties.

201
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm sure it will.

202
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,800
Perhaps Her Highness
has other plans.

203
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,000
On the contrary. Sounds like fun.
Will you include Sir Charles?

204
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
No. Charles is
having a fling in Capri.

205
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,300
He has his own parties.

206
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,900
Yes, I've read about
some of his parties.

207
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,600
They're wonderful.
We call him the juggler.

208
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,800
I've never really known
a man like him.

209
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,600
He can keep ten girls in the air
at once and make each one happy.

210
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,500
Amazing. Sort of
a contemporary Don Juan.

211
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,800
- That's it.
- But there's a difference.

212
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,600
Sir Charles' predecessor was forced
to climb balconies and fight duels,

213
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,300
and, as I understand it,
keep his women separate.

214
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Charles, on the other hand,
drives a Ferrari,

215
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,300
enters with a key,
and resorts to collective bargaining.

216
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,700
But they both have
something in common.

217
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,600
- What's that, Your Highness?
- Maybe it's best forgotten.

218
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Don't be silly.
Charles doesn't mind.

219
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,000
Everyone takes a potshot
at Charles sooner or later.

220
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,400
Go ahead, ma'am, shoot.

221
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,900
It seems to me
any middle-aged bachelor

222
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,500
who has never desired
the basic rewards of wife and family

223
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,000
and finds it necessary to occupy
the major portion of his life

224
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,000
making one conquest after another

225
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,600
is trying to prove something
he can never possibly prove.

226
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,800
- And what's that?
- That he's a man.

227
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,100
You're joking!

228
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,100
It's somewhat complicated,
but basically sound.

229
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,900
- Well, Charles?
- Not very original.

230
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,900
That theory has become
rather a tired Freudian cliché.

231
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,300
- But true.
- I've never been on the couch.

232
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,800
Not true.
That's part of your problem.

233
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,300
How refreshing to find royalty
possessed of such a perceptive wit.

234
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,200
Charles, you going
to take that lying down?

235
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,500
Yes, as a matter of fact.

236
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,800
My leg is hurting rather badly.
May I be excused?

237
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,300
- I'll be damned.
- I can't believe it.

238
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,400
- The leg?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

239
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,800
That goes to prove
there's a first time for everything.

240
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,300
Got a terrific laugh, anyway.

241
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Simone!

242
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,400
Jacques, I'm still cold.

243
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Perhaps another blanket,
my darling.

244
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,900
All right, darling.

245
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,000
There you are, my darling.

246
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,800
- Yes, darling?
- The light.

247
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,500
- What?
- I'm sorry. It doesn't help.

248
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,500
Perhaps a hot glass of milk.

249
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,300
But I think the room service
has finished, my love.

250
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,700
Yes, of course.
I forgot.

251
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,700
You see?

252
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,000
They're all gone now.

253
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,000
Well, no matter.

254
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,100
You see...

255
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,100
If my little pigeon
wants a glass of milk...

256
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,100
she shall have one...

257
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,700
...even if I have to force them
to open the kitchen.

258
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,600
She shall have milk
wherever she goes, hot or cold.

259
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,000
- Hot.
- I know. That's what I said.

260
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,100
Open the door.

261
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Darling, I need to talk to you.

262
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,700
I've sent Jacques for some milk.
I only have a moment.

263
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,700
- Let's make the most of it.
- No! Stop it.

264
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,200
- It was your idea.
- Yes, but you're the wrong...

265
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,600
The wrong what? Man?
You think I was...

266
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,100
No. I thought you were exactly
who you are, but I'm too impulsive.

267
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,900
This is not the right way.

268
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,600
Another time.

269
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,000
- Here you are, my beloved.
- Thank you.

270
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,100
It's all they had.

271
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,600
Can't get a thing in this hotel.
I had to force them to give me that.

272
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Never mind.

273
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,900
My darling, lovely darling.

274
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,000
What's wrong?

275
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,400
My darling, your feet
are like two icicles.

276
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Have you been out of bed
or something?

277
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,900
No, of course not.

278
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,400
Anyway, you warm them on me.

279
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
This is Princess Dala.
My guests have gone,

280
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,100
and I thought perhaps
you would come back and have a drink.

281
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,100
I would feel better
if we're friends.

282
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,400
I would, too,
and I'd love to come,

283
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,800
but my leg is rather painful.

284
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,300
I'm sorry. Another time.

285
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,600
Why don't you come up here?

286
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,600
My leg is only bad
if I walk too much.

287
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,000
Maybe you could do the walking
and I could do the drinking.

288
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,300
Unless you think it would be indiscreet
to come to a man's room.

289
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,900
I'll be there in five minutes.
Good-bye, Sir Charles.

290
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,900
Good-bye.

291
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,800
I don't know what’s wrong.
I'm just a bundle of nerves.

292
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,400
Don’t worry. We've solved
that problem before.

293
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,100
- You don't mean...
- Of course.

294
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,000
- I don't think you should.
- Don’t worry, my darling.

295
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,600
- I shall do it ever so softly.
- Jacques, are you sure?

296
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,300
My darling, of course.
It's always worked before.

297
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,600
There's no reason
why it should not work now.

298
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,800
You just relax
and leave everything to me.

299
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Jacques?

300
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,300
- Yes, my darling?
- I don't think it's such a good idea.

301
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,900
You mean that it's not helping?

302
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm afraid not.
I think I’ll just take a sleeping pill.

303
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,900
Very well, my darling.
I'll get it for you.

304
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And why don't you take one yourself?
You need the rest, you know?

305
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,700
Yes, I think perhaps I will.

306
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,200
Here, my darling.

307
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
- Thank you, my angel.
- Thank you, my angel.

308
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,400
My poor Jacques.

309
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,800
No matter.

310
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,400
When you've seen one Stradivarius,
you've seen them all.

311
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,800
I hadn't realized it was so late.

312
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,100
Come in, sit down, relax.
Have a nice glass of champagne.

313
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,500
- I told you I don't drink.
- Champagne's not drinking.

314
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,900
That's the minimum of alcohol
and the maximum of companionship.

315
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's still against my principles.

316
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,400
That's too bad.
I thought it might break the ice.

317
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,300
- You took me to task rather properly.
- No, thank you.

318
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,000
I thought your analysis
was very perceptive.

319
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,100
- But not very polite.
- No, it wasn’t.

320
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,600
- What made you do it?
- I resented you.

321
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,900
I find it hard to understand
a man of your reputation.

322
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,900
We both have reputations.

323
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,600
Perhaps mine is a little more
highly publicized than yours,

324
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,600
but you have presented the press
with a rather definite image.

325
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Yes, I know.

326
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,500
- Are you?
- What?

327
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,200
What they call you.
The virgin queen.

328
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,600
I'm not the queen.

329
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,000
That's only half an answer.

330
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,700
The strong-willed ruler of ten million
people sitting in her ivory tower,

331
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,400
untouched, unwed,
and unapproachable.

332
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,200
If you had known my father,
you would understand me.

333
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,400
He was an absolute ruler.

334
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,600
He governed his people
with an iron hand,

335
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,800
but he gave me a white pony
for my fifth birthday.

336
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,000
He was wrong about many things,

337
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,600
but he made his decisions according
to the ways of his predecessors.

338
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,700
I learned the way of the West,
so I've become a little of both...

339
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,300
a paradox...

340
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,700
and it is hard
to reconcile the extremes.

341
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,100
Have a glass of champagne.
Does wonders for extremes.

342
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,400
It's been known to launch
some lasting friendships.

343
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,800
- Don't you trust me?
- No.

344
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,000
- Are you afraid?
- No.

345
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,100
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

346
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,900
I was three years old
when I rode my first elephant.

347
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,900
I was six when I went
on my first "safrari."

348
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,600
"Frasari."

349
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,900
Wild-animal hunt.

350
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,600
And I was ten
when I bagged my first tiger.

351
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,200
But I'll never forget
my lovely little pony.

352
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,000
When did you bag him?

353
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,900
You're making fun again.
You really don't like animals.

354
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,300
Don't trust a man
who doesn't care about animals.

355
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,000
And don't trust an animal
who doesn't care about people.

356
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,800
Why you don't like people?

357
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,600
I like people.

358
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,700
That's supposed to be me
who doesn't...

359
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
like people, right?

360
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,100
If you say so.

361
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,900
I don't say so.
You say so.

362
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,800
- Right?
- I said so.

363
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,300
And another thing you did,
you didn't tell me the truth.

364
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,900
- About what?
- About champagne. About this.

365
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,400
Boy, did you fib.

366
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,700
You said...

367
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
Something about extremes.

368
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,700
It does wonders for them.

369
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,300
It does more than that.
It makes your lips numb.

370
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,300
I can't feel them.
Are they still there?

371
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,400
Let's have a look.

372
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,100
You didn't tell me about that part.

373
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,600
Won't do you any good.
I can't feel it.

374
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,300
Hoisted on your own petard.

375
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,300
Don't try to say that
when you haven't got any lips.

376
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,200
I'm plastered.

377
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,900
- If that's the right expression.
- That's the right expression.

378
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,500
You're a fraud and a liar.

379
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,300
And you think you are going
to take advantage of me.

380
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,900
No. You think I am.

381
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,800
I know you are.
That's the plan, isn't it?

382
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Feed me champagne...

383
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,800
break down the inhibitions...

384
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,100
and tallyho.

385
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,300
No more virgin queen.

386
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,900
We're all out of champagne.

387
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
- I'll get another bottle.
- No!

388
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,600
I prefer to remain conscious

389
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,200
so I may view
the attempted seduction firsthand.

390
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,200
Because you've got
a surprise coming, Charlie.

391
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,700
I got friends in low places.

392
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,200
You make one pass at me,
and I'll sic him on you.

393
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,900
Understand?

394
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,500
If he moves a muscle,
attack without mercy.

395
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,100
You see, Charlie?

396
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,400
You're outnumbered,
two against one.

397
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,300
And I don't care if you can juggle.

398
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

399
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,900
Cat got your tongue?

400
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,300
Got his tongue?
My friend says he hasn't got it.

401
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,000
Then why don't you
say something?

402
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,000
I couldn't think
of anything to say.

403
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,000
Why don't you kiss me again?

404
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,400
All right.

405
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,900
You know what, Charlie?
I could feel that one.

406
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,100
Again.

407
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,900
If I were my father,
I'd have you tortured.

408
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,200
No. If you were your father,

409
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,500
I doubt very much
if I would have kissed you.

410
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,800
Good thinking, Charlie.

411
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,500
Then, now that we’ve
straightened out who I am,

412
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
what are you
going to do about it?

413
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,500
What kind of a friend are you?
You were supposed to attack.

414
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,400
No friends, Charlie.
Now you got me outnumbered.

415
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,900
I thought we were friends.

416
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,500
You are the juggler.
I am the virgin queen.

417
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,500
Somebody's got to win.

418
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,500
Friends don't act like that.

419
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,900
Want to be friends, Charlie,
or want to win?

420
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,900
You really want to know?

421
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,100
What's wrong?

422
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,200
I don't feel...
I think I'm going...

423
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,600
Good-bye, Charlie.

424
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,400
Here...

425
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,300
Darling. Dala.

426
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,400
Ma'am? Your Highness!

427
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,900
Thank you. Up.

428
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,400
There we are.

429
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,000
Hello, Uncle Charles.

430
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,500
George!

431
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,100
Good morning.
Listen, what about this nephew?

432
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,400
- How did you find out?
- I met him in the bar last night.

433
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,800
That's what I was trying
to explain at the window.

434
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,000
What happened to you?

435
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,900
Jacques dragged me
back to the hotel.

436
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,600
- I looked everywhere for you.
- I looked everywhere for you.

437
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,100
I nearly climbed in bed
with your nephew.

438
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,400
- You what?
- Don’t worry. I took care of it.

439
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,100
He had a heavy night.

440
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,100
I almost put the princess
in bed with him.

441
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,600
- Really?
- What you got there?

442
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,500
A note to Uncle Charles.

443
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,000
"Dear Uncle Charles,
don’t worry about a thing.

444
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,600
I've gone to see the princess
to apologize for last night."

445
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,600
Apologize for what?
Nothing happened.

446
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,500
It must have been
rather embarrassing,

447
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,400
expecting to end up
with one man...

448
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,400
She didn't expect
to wind up with anybody.

449
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,700
She had a couple glasses
of champagne and had to rest.

450
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,900
Of course.

451
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,700
Think of him
taking over my room.

452
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,700
- Didn't you know he was coming?
- No. I haven't seen him for years.

453
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,200
But who is he?
What is he?

454
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,900
He is my nephew, really.

455
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,100
He's my late brother's son.

456
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,800
I've been responsible for him
since he was ten years old.

457
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,100
I sent him to all
the best schools in America.

458
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,300
He did very well,
as a matter of fact.

459
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,900
He's just graduated
from college. Look.

460
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,100
Isn't he a bit old for school?

461
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,700
He did two years in the army.

462
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,600
He lost a whole year after that
to some strange tropical disease.

463
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,500
He's certainly attractive.

464
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,400
There's a slight
family resemblance.

465
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,300
Apart from that,
we have nothing in common.

466
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,200
He's dedicated to education,
passed at the top of his class.

467
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,700
Cares nothing about sports.

468
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,600
In his letters, he's never
once mentioned girls.

469
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,100
He may not mention them, but he's got
a pretty good idea what they are.

470
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,700
I nearly didn't
get out of here last night.

471
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,100
You're joking.

472
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,800
It was a relief to get back
to Jacques and his fiddle.

473
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,300
If we don't do something soon,
he's gonna ruin everything.

474
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,600
- If I don't do something.
- It shouldn't be too difficult.

475
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,200
He's just a young man
who's not been out in the world.

476
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,300
That's because he's been
spending his time in the bedroom.

477
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,200
- I'm surprised at you.
- I can handle it.

478
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,200
As a matter of fact,
it might be rather intriguing,

479
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,400
particularly if the family resemblance
goes deeper than you think.

480
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm envious.

481
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,000
It seems that we’re somewhat
in the same spot, my love.

482
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,600
You envy George,
and I envy the princess.

483
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,200
I really don't know
what I'm going to do yet.

484
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,600
I might go back to college
and get my doctorate.

485
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,600
But I'm torn.

486
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,100
I feel there's so many things
to be done in the world,

487
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,900
so many backward countries
where I might be useful.

488
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,600
I've even been considering
the Peace Corps.

489
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,100
You're certainly not
much like your uncle.

490
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,100
I don't know
too much about my uncle,

491
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,700
except what I've read
in newspapers and magazines.

492
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,500
- One mustn't judge by that.
- No?

493
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,700
After all, whatever I am today,
he made it possible.

494
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,700
I guess everyone has
at least one redeeming quality.

495
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,000
Yes.

496
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,500
Good morning, Your Highness.
Hair of the dog.

497
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,300
- May I present Madame Clouseau?
- Good morning.

498
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,300
This is my
Americanized nephew George.

499
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,800
We met at the bar last night.

500
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,200
- How is your cough?
- It's completely gone. Thanks.

501
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,600
Have a glass of this.

502
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,000
It'll put everything
in its right perspective.

503
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,000
My perspective
is excellent this morning.

504
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,400
I see your leg is much better.

505
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,000
It's a vast improvement.
Very much better.

506
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,400
George and I had a wonderful
family reunion last night

507
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,900
after we carried you home.

508
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,800
- He's quite a lad.
- So I've discovered.

509
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,700
He's thinking of joining
the Peace Corps.

510
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,500
Imagine a Litton
in the Peace Corps.

511
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,000
Be careful, or you’ll give
your family a good name.

512
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,000
- Please sit down.
- No, thank you.

513
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,400
I was on my way to ski
when I ran into Sir Charles.

514
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,700
- Do you ski, Mr. Litton?
- Ski?

515
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,500
- No, not very well.
- You should learn, George.

516
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,000
If it wasn’t for this ropy leg,
I'd take you myself.

517
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,700
I'm hardly in your uncle's class,

518
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,500
but I'd be happy to give you
the benefit of my experience.

519
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
I'm sure Madame
is an excellent teacher.

520
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,800
Certainly she could
get you started out right.

521
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,800
If it wouldn’t be
too much trouble, yeah.

522
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,800
Not at all.
It would be a pleasure.

523
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,700
Perhaps you'd like
to come along now.

524
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,400
George, you can't pass up
an invitation like that.

525
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,200
I haven't got the proper clothes,
and I don't have any skis.

526
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,100
The shop will fix you up.
Just charge everything to me.

527
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,500
Thanks. Your Highness,
hope to see you again.

528
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,400
If you're back early.
I'm leaving on the afternoon train.

529
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,200
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

530
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,900
- Thanks, Uncle Charles.
- Have fun.

531
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,600
Mind the instructor.
She knows what she's doing.

532
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,700
I'm sure she does.

533
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,900
- You're not staying?
- No. We're off to the slopes.

534
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,400
I'll get the door.
So long, Uncle Charles.

535
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,900
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

536
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,800
Just in time. Thank you.
You sure you won't join me?

537
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,900
Quite sure.

538
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,000
Do you have to
leave this afternoon?

539
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,400
Yes.

540
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
Isn't this departure
rather sudden?

541
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,900
Not at all.
Why do you think so?

542
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,400
I just thought that
after last night...

543
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,200
My leaving has nothing
to do with last night.

544
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,300
- Hasn't it?
- You don't know me very well.

545
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,800
No, but I thought last night,
I was making some progress.

546
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,400
That was champagne,
nothing more.

547
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,400
Whatever it was,
it was very interesting.

548
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,100
- I really don't remember.
- That's an awful old cliché.

549
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,400
- It's true.
- The majority of women,

550
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,400
they have half a glass too much
and let down the barriers a little,

551
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,500
and they wake up in the morning
riddled with guilt

552
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,300
and think they can reclaim their virtue
by saying, "I don't remember."

553
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,500
Are you saying my virtue
is not intact?

554
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,800
- You know it is.
- Then why should I feel guilty?

555
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,100
You're not concerned
about what happened.

556
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,500
You're worried about
what might have happened.

557
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,500
That makes you vulnerable.
That makes you a woman.

558
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,500
You're an arrogant fool.

559
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,400
Perhaps I am,
but after what I just said,

560
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,400
a real woman
would have slapped my face.

561
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,100
I'm glad that's over.
Friends again?

562
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,800
Friends.

563
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,400
Good. Now the least you can do
is let me take you to the station.

564
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,400
- All right.
- You really have to go?

565
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,500
- Yes, I must go.
- That's too bad.

566
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,400
- Nothing I can say to make you stay?
- Nothing.

567
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,700
- What time do you have to be there?
- 3:00.

568
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,100
3:00 on the dot,
I'll be here, Your Highness.

569
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,000
3:00.

570
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,200
Do we have to start
the lessons right away?

571
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,500
That's what we’re up here for,
is it not?

572
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,100
I was hoping we could talk
about last night.

573
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,700
- We can talk about that later.
- You were more fun in bed.

574
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,800
Would you do me a favor,
Mr. Litton?

575
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,400
Sure, if you call me George.

576
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,400
Forget about last night.
I was impetuous.

577
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,200
I had too much to drink
and I'd just had a fight with my husband.

578
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,700
It might be easier
for you to forget,

579
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,000
but I didn't sleep a wink
after you left.

580
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,300
It was a very frustrating experience.

581
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,100
I'm afraid that's your problem,
but I wouldn't make any plans.

582
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,700
I never make any plans.

583
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,200
I just sort of follow my instincts.

584
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,300
George, it's four miles
down the mountain,

585
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,700
and I'm a very good skier.

586
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,700
You follow your instincts
too closely,

587
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,900
and you're liable
to break your neck.

588
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,400
The first things to learn about
skiing are the fundamentals.

589
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,000
Let's see you turn around.

590
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,900
It's not as easy as it looks.
Let me give you a hand.

591
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,800
Let's try something easier.
It's a lot easier, honest.

592
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,000
You were going
to watch those instincts.

593
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,600
I'm busy. You watch them.

594
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,800
You're abominable.

595
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,600
Yeah, that's me,
the Abominable Snowman.

596
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,300
George, stop it!

597
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,400
Imbecile!

598
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,500
Perhaps we'll meet again.

599
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,100
- Good-bye, Sir Charles.
- Just a minute.

600
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,200
- That's him. There he goes.
- Who?

601
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,800
The man who stole your dog,
in that little car.

602
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,600
- How's it going?
- Fine. I'm going to miss her.

603
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,300
Let that be a lesson.
Never get involved with your victims.

604
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,200
- Shall we get out in the open?
- No. It's a bit hard here.

605
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,900
That's good. That's okay.
Right, start. Give it to me now.

606
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,300
- How close are they?
- Now.

607
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,700
- Sorry. Ready?
- Right.

608
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Come along, little doggy.
Here we are.

609
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,400
Look out!

610
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,900
She's got the dog.
I will see you later.

611
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,100
You have a wonderful smile.

612
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,700
I have a great deal
to smile about.

613
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,600
I have Amber back,
and I'm having a wonderful time.

614
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,700
You missed your train.

615
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,300
There's one at midnight
and one in the morning.

616
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,900
Perhaps I should have
your dog kidnapped again.

617
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,300
Then you'd be bound to stay.

618
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,900
Did you arrange to have her
kidnapped the first time?

619
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Of course.

620
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,700
I am willing
to bet you 10,000 francs

621
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,000
that the Phantom is in Cortina
at this very moment,

622
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,100
even perhaps in this very room.

623
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,900
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr. Tucker?

624
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,300
I agree with the inspector.

625
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,800
Ten of his last fifteen victims have been
guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

626
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,400
What are you all talking about?

627
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,600
- The notorious Phantom.
- I've never heard of him.

628
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,900
What little I've read about him,
he seems to be quite a fellow.

629
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,200
There are few thieves who are
as clever as the Phantom.

630
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,000
Each theft is completely
different and unique,

631
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,200
classic in its conception.

632
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,600
I thought you were working on
the theory that he does repeat himself.

633
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,400
Only as far as Angela Dunning's
parties are concerned.

634
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,800
However, there is
one other duplication,

635
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:00,700
but that is his trademark,
his calling card, so to speak.

636
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,400
He always leaves
a white monogrammed glove.

637
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,100
Sounds terribly theatrical.

638
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,900
If I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

639
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,200
Really? And who would that be?

640
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,000
Who has the most
fabulous diamond in the world?

641
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,000
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

642
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,900
A prize he could never resist.
He would be bound to try for it.

643
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,200
He'd be disappointed.

644
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,500
The Pink Panther
is in my safe at...

645
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,300
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

646
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,000
If I'm not being too nosy,
Your Highness,

647
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,100
I read somewhere
there was some dispute

648
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,800
over the ownership
of the Pink Panther.

649
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,400
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

650
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,800
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

651
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,200
When the present government
seized power,

652
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,100
they claimed the diamond
was the property of the people.

653
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,700
There's even talk
of the International Court

654
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,900
deciding the issue.

655
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,500
Why don't I steal the diamond
and leave that old glove behind?

656
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,400
You and I
could split the insurance.

657
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,200
All right.

658
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,400
I feel like dancing.

659
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,900
- Your Highness?
- I'd love to.

660
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,900
- How about you, Madame?
- Yes, of course.

661
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,900
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles.
- What?

662
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,700
- I say, your leg is better.
- Yes, much better. Thank you.

663
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,800
You know, Mr. Tucker...

664
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,200
- It's my beer, old man.
- My hand. It burnt...

665
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,200
I'm sorry.

666
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,200
Sit down.

667
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,200
Seems to be working out
better than we expected.

668
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,500
The only thing we've found out
is that it's not here.

669
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,700
You shouldn't have any trouble
discovering exactly where it is.

670
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,000
Her Highness seems
to be completely captivated.

671
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,400
I'd say that's
a considerable exaggeration.

672
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,400
You're either showing
a touch of senility,

673
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,100
Or you need glasses, my love.

674
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,100
When I'm showing
my senility, darling,

675
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,500
you'll be occupying your time
with your grandchildren.

676
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,500
One has to have children
before one has grandchildren.

677
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,300
You wouldn't dare.

678
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,400
Jacques would make
a wonderful father.

679
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,200
- He has many redeeming qualities.
- Name one.

680
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,200
He's kind, loyal,
faithful, obedient.

681
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,200
You're either married
to a Boy Scout or a Dachshund.

682
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,500
And he adores me.

683
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,900
That eliminates the Boy Scouts.

684
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,500
- Good night.
- Thank you.

685
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,300
You seem to have
lost something.

686
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,300
- How'd you like to borrow mine?
- Thanks, Uncle Charles, yes.

687
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,700
Madame.

688
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,300
- You've been avoiding me.
- That about describes it.

689
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,900
You know what
I've been thinking?

690
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,300
Yes. That's why
I've been avoiding you.

691
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,900
I don't think you were really
looking for me that night

692
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,300
in my uncle's bedroom.

693
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,400
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No, I mean it.

694
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,500
Not the way
you treated me today.

695
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,500
- You know what I think?
- What?

696
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,600
What do you think, George?

697
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,200
I think maybe I was wrong.

698
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,600
I'm sorry I have to leave,

699
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,300
but I must make
a very important phone call.

700
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,300
- Can't it wait?
- I'm afraid not.

701
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,400
Good night.

702
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,800
That's better.

703
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,800
Just a quick shower, my love,
and I will be right with you.

704
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,600
One moment, please.

705
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,900
Inspector Clouseau.

706
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,900
Inspector Clouseau,
this is the prefect of police.

707
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I have information
regarding the Phantom.

708
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,800
- The Phantom?
- Yes. You must come at once.

709
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,800
I'm in Brunico.

710
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,400
Brunico? But that's in Brunico.
That's 30 miles from here.

711
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,800
It is here that I have
discovered the information.

712
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,000
Come immediately.

713
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,100
I cannot say more.
I am being watched.

714
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,100
Yes. I understand, yes.

715
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,500
I'm sorry, my darling.
Important police business.

716
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,800
I will be back with you
as soon as possible.

717
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,400
I understand, my love.

718
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,100
- My darling.
- Yes?

719
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,100
I am a husband that must be
envied by all other husbands.

720
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,000
I'm sure no one
ever had a husband like you.

721
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,000
My darling.

722
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,800
My darling, don't move.
Don't panic.

723
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,000
All that has happened
is that my hat has caught

724
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,500
in one of your naughty
little hairpins.

725
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,700
<i>Voilà.</i>

726
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:25,900
You know, at times like this
I wish I was but a simple peasant.

727
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,100
It's times like this that make me
realize how lucky I really am.

728
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,600
He's gone to Brunico.
Another call about the Phantom.

729
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,900
There's something going on.

730
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I don't quite know what it is,
but there's something wrong.

731
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,800
Do you want to call it off?

732
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,500
I don't know.
I'm considering it.

733
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,200
Have you considered
something else?

734
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,400
What's that?

735
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,900
The possibility that
you're growing a conscience.

736
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,700
- A conscience? About what?
- The princess.

737
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,700
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm just being a woman.

738
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,200
This time you've chosen
a fascinating victim.

739
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,200
I suspect you've broken
the first rule

740
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,400
and allowed yourself
to become involved.

741
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,700
You're being a woman, all right.

742
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,100
That's obvious. Competition
always makes a woman obvious.

743
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,200
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

744
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,500
Wait a minute.

745
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
- What is it?
- Flowers.

746
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,600
- George!
- Trick or treat.

747
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,900
- Wait a minute.
- I found these growing in the hall.

748
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,000
You get right out of here.

749
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,500
What kind of hospitality is that?

750
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,500
But my husband
could be back any minute.

751
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,800
He must be about
halfway to Brunico by now.

752
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,100
"You must come to Brunico
immediately, Inspector.

753
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,800
"I have information
regarding the Phantom.

754
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:31,300
While you're in Brunico,
waiting for the prefect of police..."

755
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,800
Thank you very much.

756
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,200
"I shall be investigating your wife."

757
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,300
One never knows, huh?

758
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,900
Perhaps the Phantom
is hiding under the bed.

759
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,600
That's more like it.

760
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,300
- You should be ashamed.
- I'm planning on it.

761
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,500
Suppose Jacques
doesn't go to Brunico?

762
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,600
Suppose he finds out
the prefect never called?

763
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,000
You must get out of here.

764
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,700
You are the damnedest woman.
Are you a sexual yo-yo?

765
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,800
You jump in my bed,
you push me off a mountain,

766
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,700
then you practically seduce me
on the dance floor.

767
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,100
You're terribly attractive,
and I'm naturally...

768
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,100
- But not here.
- Where?

769
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,900
I don't know, but not tonight.

770
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,400
You know what your trouble is?
You can't make up your mind.

771
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,400
- I am married.
- Where's your husband?

772
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,400
Out in 12 feet of snow,
chasing the Phantom.

773
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,100
- That was your idea.
- Sure it was.

774
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,900
If he was any kind of a man,
he wouldn't have gone.

775
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,900
- Darling.
- "Darling"?

776
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,900
It's locked.

777
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,200
There you are.
Halfway to Brunico, huh?

778
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,400
Angel?

779
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,200
- What do I do?
- Answer the door.

780
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,300
- Simone?
- Yes, dear?

781
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,200
- But I thought you were on...
- That phone call was a ruse.

782
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,200
Are you hurt, my darling?

783
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,600
I don't recall that being there.

784
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,600
No, it was sent a while ago.
I thought it was from you.

785
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,400
No, it certainly was not from me.

786
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,600
Some very strange things
going on here.

787
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,700
I passed the prefect on the road.

788
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,100
- He never made that call.
- No?

789
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,700
There was no card with these?

790
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,400
Why should anybody want me
to go to Brunico?

791
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,100
My darling.

792
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,800
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to kiss your foot.

793
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,000
- Let me kiss your face.
- It's all right.

794
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,200
Darling, I'm sorry.
Come here.

795
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,600
That's nice and comfy.
You belong in bed there.

796
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,900
- My darling.
- Listen, dear.

797
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,200
Why don’t we go down to the bar
and have a nightcap?

798
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,900
Darling, listen,
why don't I have a nice bath?

799
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And afterwards,
we have our lovely, warm bed.

800
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,700
Don’t worry about this mess.
We can have it cleaned up later.

801
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,700
We don’t want
any more interruptions.

802
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,600
Would you mind if I bathed first?

803
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,100
Did you not bathe earlier?

804
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,400
Yes, but it would warm me up,
help me to relax.

805
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,500
I'll tell you what we’ll do.

806
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,600
Like we did in the old days,
when you're in there,

807
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,600
I will come in
and scrub your back for you.

808
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,200
You're so romantic,
but I'll only be a moment.

809
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,400
- Darling?
- Yes?

810
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,400
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello, my darling.

811
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:55,000
- Why did you draw the curtains?
- Just to keep me warm.

812
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,400
Warm? Warm is one thing.
It must be hell in there.

813
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,700
No, it's wonderful.

814
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,800
Why don't you let me
wash your back for you?

815
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,400
It's already done, my darling.

816
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,300
As I told you before,
I just want to relax.

817
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,500
We must have no secrets
from one another, my darling.

818
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,800
I know, my darling.

819
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,300
I will brush my teeth
and keep you company.

820
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,400
That's sweet of you, my darling.

821
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,400
I thought you would like to know
Princess Dala just checked out.

822
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,900
Thank you very much.

823
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,500
Darling, you got rid of all
those naughty little bubbles?

824
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,000
- I beg your pardon?
- You got rid of the little bubbles?

825
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,100
Yes, I did.

826
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,100
Hey, come...

827
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,500
Come out quick.

828
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,100
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

829
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,200
One minute.

830
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,000
- Inspector's violin, ma'am.
- Thank you.

831
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:23,200
- Madame, the flowers.
- It's nothing. It doesn't matter.

832
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,600
If they found out downstairs,
I'd lose my job.

833
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,000
- Do it in the morning.
- I'll ring for the maid.

834
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,400
- Darling?
- Yes, dear?

835
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,000
How would you like to
wash my back?

836
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,000
I'd love to, but you see...

837
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,100
I have to... I mean...
I'm cold.

838
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,400
Get the broom.

839
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,800
Come on. Hurry up. Go.

840
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,300
Shan't be a moment, my darling.
I’ll just put on my pajamas.

841
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,700
Darling, look. I think I've got
something in my right eye.

842
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,000
- Let me put you in the...
- My left one. No, this one.

843
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,900
- If you'd come in the light...
- It hurts!

844
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,600
- Stand still. I can't see it.
- It hurts. I cannot open it.

845
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,200
Stand in the light a moment.

846
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,200
- Where?
- Here.

847
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,600
There's absolutely nothing
in your eye.

848
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,000
Nothing? Are you sure?

849
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,200
Only your eye.
That is all that is there.

850
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,200
- What are you doing?
- It broke off.

851
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,000
Put it back. We have no time.
He's coming back.

852
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,900
Get under the bed.
Come on. Quick.

853
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,100
Come on.

854
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,600
Why aren't you in bed,
my darling?

855
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:13,500
I was... I mean...

856
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,800
I mean, I'm just going to.

857
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I'm cold.

858
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:25,200
- My Stradivarius.
- The porter just brought it in.

859
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:29,000
I sent it to the village
to be repaired.

860
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,000
I hope they know how
to fix plastic.

861
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,100
I hope so, too.

862
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,100
So far, so good.

863
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,600
We shall see.

864
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,400
Better than ever.

865
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,600
Dear, I doubt if we shall
need it tonight, my love.

866
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,900
I'm sure we won't, darling.

867
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,600
What is it?

868
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,500
It's very strange.

869
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,900
Why don't you come to bed?

870
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,700
You know,
I don't understand this.

871
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,700
You see...

872
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,500
These footprints...

873
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,600
They were made by shoes...

874
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:48,900
...and they were not
made by feet.

875
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,500
I’ll just get up
and turn off the lights.

876
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,700
At last. At last.

877
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,400
Darling, my little...

878
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,200
Darling, what's the matter,
my darling?

879
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:17,200
It's very strange, my love,
but suddenly I'm freezing cold.

880
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:20,800
- You're freezing cold?
- The window is open.

881
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,000
The window's open.

882
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,100
Sometimes it's healthy
to have fresh air.

883
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,000
Healthy is one thing,
but it's hell in here, my love.

884
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,300
Ten below zero outside,
my darling.

885
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,100
That's better.

886
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,800
- There, my darling.
- Yes.

887
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,300
At last!

888
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,200
- Yes?
- I just arrived in town.

889
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,800
No trouble with the police yet.

890
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,400
The princess is expecting
important visitors here tomorrow.

891
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,200
- She say anything about leaving?
- Who is this?

892
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,500
- Yes?
- Princess Dala, please.

893
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,000
Her Highness checked out
a short while ago.

894
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,800
Uncle Charles.

895
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,400
What did you say?

896
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,400
I said he could come
as one of the Borgias.

897
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,400
Then he wouldn't have
to explain his cousin.

898
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,600
What's a Borgia?

899
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,500
Good evening.

900
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,700
I mean...

901
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,200
I enjoy champagne in bed
as much as the next man,

902
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,300
but from now on, perhaps
a more practical approach?

903
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,800
I'm sorry, my darling.
I wanted to surprise you.

904
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,800
- It's been a night of surprises.
- You can say that again.

905
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,300
It's been...

906
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,500
Anyway...

907
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,500
- My love?
- Yes?

908
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,000
Shall I say you're not here?

909
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,600
No, it's all right, darling.
I'll answer it.

910
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,700
- Yes!
- Tucker here, Inspector.

911
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,000
The man who kidnapped
the dog was driving a rented car.

912
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,700
He's been identified
as a man named Artoff.

913
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,900
London informs us
that a man of his description

914
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,700
is at present employed
by Sir Charles Litton.

915
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,100
I see. Come up immediately.

916
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,400
Sir Charles!

917
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,500
He's the Phantom!
I've really got him this time.

918
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,400
Sir Charles?
Open that door.

919
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,600
I know you’re in there.

920
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,600
Open up. This is the police.

921
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,500
- Stand back while I fire.
- No, don't do that, old man.

922
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,800
- Jacques knows.
- And somebody else.

923
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:49,000
George has got
my do-it-yourself Phantom kit.

924
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,700
I've got to get out of here.

925
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,400
- His clothes are still here.
- Perhaps he's already escaped.

926
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,000
Most unlikely. He doesn't realize
that I am onto him.

927
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,700
Listen, old man.

928
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,500
We've no proof that Artoff was
the man driving the Innocente.

929
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,600
Sir Charles is our man.
My every instinct tells me so.

930
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,800
Careful, you fool.
You realize this gun is loaded?

931
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:12,200
What I must do now is get dressed
and search the rest of the hotel.

932
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,100
- Did you find him?
- No, but he can't be far.

933
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,200
I must dress quickly and get...

934
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,200
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

935
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,600
My coat!

936
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,400
My Sûreté-Scotland-Yard-type
Macintosh! It's gone!

937
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,600
Good evening, Inspector.

938
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,500
- What is it, Saloud?
- Inspector Clouseau.

939
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,300
Your Highness,
please excuse this interruption.

940
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,400
I have news
of great importance.

941
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,800
This is Mr. Tucker
of Lloyd's of London.

942
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:29,900
And we have met before.

943
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,300
I've met her, too, you know.

944
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,700
Yes, I know, but we are
meeting her again now.

945
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,700
What is this news?

946
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,100
I have discovered
the identity of the Phantom.

947
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,200
- You don't say.
- I do say.

948
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,200
- Of course, we're not positive.
- I am positive.

949
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,300
He is, I believe, at this
very moment here in Rome.

950
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,300
- Really?
- Yes.

951
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,800
Have you seen or heard
from Sir Charles Litton?

952
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,400
Not since I left Cortina. Why?

953
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,200
Sir Charles and the Phantom
are one and the same.

954
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,300
- You're not serious.
- I am serious.

955
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,400
I can understand
how difficult it is

956
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,600
for Your Highness
to accept the facts.

957
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,900
Sir Charles is a very persuasive
and attractive man.

958
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,700
He is also Sir Charles Litton,

959
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,100
a man of considerable influence
and reputation.

960
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,100
She's got quite a point there.

961
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,300
He is a fraud,
and I shall prove it.

962
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,800
Meanwhile,
I would like your permission

963
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,900
to surround the house
with armed guards.

964
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,700
- I take it the gem is in the villa.
- It is.

965
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,500
As you know, I'm having
a rather large party this evening.

966
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,300
Your guests will be caused
no embarrassment whatsoever.

967
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,000
They will not be aware my men
are present in their disguises.

968
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,100
In that case,
you have my permission.

969
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,200
Thank you.

970
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,400
Your Highness, mark my words,

971
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,300
if Sir Charles is foolish enough

972
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,900
to attempt to steal
your diamond tonight,

973
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,600
you will be witness to the capture
of the notorious Phantom.

974
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,100
Gentlemen.

975
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,100
The plans will
have to be changed.

976
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,300
No.

977
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:28,500
We have to make sure
Sir Charles doesn't steal the jewel.

978
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,200
- Hello.
- Hello, Tucker.

979
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,800
- Like a drink?
- No, thank you.

980
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,800
I never drink while on duty.
You should know that. Never.

981
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,300
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

982
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,100
- Warm.
- Yes, it must be hell in there.

983
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,000
Bet it's not so good in there.

984
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,700
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

985
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,200
My men are everywhere,
mingling here, mingling there.

986
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,100
Watching all the time, watching.

987
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,300
How dare you drink
whilst you're on duty?

988
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,500
Who is inside there?

989
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,500
- Sergeant Walter!
- Sergeant Quinn.

990
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,200
Any more behavior like this,
and I'll have your stripes.

991
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,500
Now get out of here
and start mingling again.

992
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:07,000
Quite funny that,
zebra and the stripes.

993
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:11,800
- Yes, very good, very good.
- Not bad, not bad.

994
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,300
I think I'll mingle.

995
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,300
Right.

996
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:35,200
Didn't I tell you I'd make this
the biggest social success of the year?

997
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,800
Certainly you did.

998
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:40,500
The only thing that worries me is,
what do we do for your next one?

999
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,800
- How can I possibly top this?
- You'll think of something.

1000
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,600
- Excuse me.
- Of course, love. Have a ball!

1001
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,000
Hello, you!

1002
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,100
May I see
your invitation, please?

1003
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:56,900
All right.

1004
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,600
Wasn't there another gorilla
in a Rolls-Royce?

1005
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,900
Yes, probably a rich uncle.

1006
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,200
You see, gentlemen?
Perfectly safe.

1007
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,900
One cannot be too careful.

1008
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,600
This party...
All your guests wearing masks.

1009
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:21,100
It was possible the Phantom
had already done his work.

1010
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,400
Without an invitation,

1011
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,000
how could Sir Charles
get past your guards?

1012
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,900
Where the Phantom
is concerned, Your Highness...

1013
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:30,800
What's wrong?

1014
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,200
What are you doing?

1015
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,900
The question is,
what are you doing?

1016
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
- I protest!
- Remove your head at once!

1017
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,500
Tucker, remove his head.

1018
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:58,400
- It's our ambassador.
- Ambassador?

1019
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,500
My apologies,
Lord Cravenwood.

1020
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,900
The inspector was only acting
with the best of motives.

1021
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,100
Your Highness.

1022
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,600
Lord Cravenwood,
what would your wife think?

1023
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,300
- What's he got that I haven't got?
- George!

1024
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,500
- In the flesh.
- What are you doing here?

1025
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,900
- Tarzan let me use the car.
- I've got to talk to you.

1026
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,600
You've got to get out of here.

1027
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,400
Darling...

1028
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,400
Lord Cravenwood, I'm terribly
sorry about what happened.

1029
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,700
I was discussing important things
with Her Highness.

1030
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,800
When I discovered you
outside the library door,

1031
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,400
I thought...

1032
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,500
- The ambassador.
- Yes, I know.

1033
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,100
Darling, you haven't danced
with me all evening, my angel.

1034
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,300
- I'm sorry, my darling.
- That's all for now.

1035
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,100
Pardon me! I'm lost.

1036
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,900
I must have gotten off
the main road.

1037
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,800
I'm on my way to Frascati.

1038
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:10,700
Go down the road a half mile.
You'll see a sign.

1039
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,800
Turn right. It'll take you
right to the highway.

1040
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,200
Excuse me, but I've got to
talk to Lord Cravenwood.

1041
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,600
It's extremely important.

1042
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,900
That's okay.
He's making me itch, anyway.

1043
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Fine.

1044
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:45,000
Listen to me. I know what
you're up to, and it won't work.

1045
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,600
- You'll ruin everything.
- Excuse me, Your Excellency.

1046
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:50,500
May I cut in?
Thank you so much, sir.

1047
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,100
Are you having a good time?

1048
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,100
- Yes, extremely good time.
- Good.

1049
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,900
Fine party, Angela darling.

1050
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:01,100
Wait till you see
the fireworks at midnight.

1051
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,000
Hello, old boy.
May I have this dance?

1052
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:40,100
I never learned to dance.
I simply got natural rhythm.

1053
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,800
You're quite right.

1054
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,500
By Jove, that looked...
It is! It's Sir Charles!

1055
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,500
Tucker!

1056
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,300
- Inspector!
- Tucker!

1057
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,300
Inspector!

1058
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,500
Take your filthy hands
off my asp.

1059
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,500
- Charles?
- Where's the safe?

1060
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,300
In the library.
George is robbing it.

1061
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,000
- Which way?
- Come on.

1062
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,900
- But it's not midnight yet.
- They turned the lights out.

1063
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,900
Her Highness must have
changed her mind.

1064
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
All right.

1065
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,100
Be careful.
I can't see a thing.

1066
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,800
Tucker? Where are you?

1067
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,400
Watch where you're going!

1068
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,600
It's hell in here.

1069
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:02,700
A candle!

1070
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,900
- Hey, got a match?
- Yes, sir.

1071
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Quick, quick.

1072
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,900
What kind of a candle is this?

1073
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,600
In there.
George is in the gorilla suit.

1074
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:41,200
- Gorilla?
- Good luck.

1075
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:46,700
Rule, Britannia

1076
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,900
Britannia, rule the waves

1077
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:53,000
Britons never, never, never
shall be slaves

1078
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:55,300
Rule, Britannia

1079
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,000
Britannia, rule the waves...
I say!

1080
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,600
Inspector! Inspector!

1081
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,600
Inspector, Sir Charles is here.

1082
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,200
- George?
- Uncle Charles?

1083
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,200
- Have you got it?
- No. Haven't you?

1084
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,400
No. The safe's empty.

1085
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,100
What's that?

1086
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,800
Someone's been
highly dishonest.

1087
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,300
Follow me, men.

1088
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,900
You idiots!
They're getting away from us!

1089
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,200
Help me to my feet, someone.
Mr. Tucker!

1090
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,200
After them! Come on, Tucker!

1091
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,600
Come back! It's me!

1092
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,300
Come on now!
Faster! Faster!

1093
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:09,100
What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive this thing faster?

1094
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:23,500
Tucker, you're wrong.
Come on! Quick!

1095
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,700
I tell you, this is the road
they've gone up.

1096
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:30,500
Don't argue with me!
I know where they've gone.

1097
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,400
George, any idea
how we get out of here?

1098
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,200
I don't know.
I've been all over.

1099
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,000
I've been up this street,
that one.

1100
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:51,600
- How we gonna get out of here?
- Why don't you try the high road?

1101
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,700
I'll take the high road.
You take the low road.

1102
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,800
- So long, Uncle Charles.
- Ciao, George.

1103
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,700
Who taught you
to drive this thing?

1104
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:46,000
- I see them! That's them!
- No, it isn't!

1105
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:22,200
Then when I was
thrown out of college,

1106
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:23,500
I made up my mind.

1107
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:27,400
I decided to live a little.

1108
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,100
I knew if I continued
my academic endeavors,

1109
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,700
I could depend upon
that check of yours every month.

1110
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,300
You know what I did?

1111
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,500
I took a plush
Hollywood apartment,

1112
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:42,400
surrounded myself with all of
the advantages of a wealthy bachelor.

1113
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,800
Then I sent you glowing reports
of a brilliant academic career.

1114
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,100
I suppose a certain
amount of dishonesty

1115
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,500
is bound to beget
a certain amount of dishonesty.

1116
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,300
But, Inspector...

1117
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,300
Come on, please.
I have not much time.

1118
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,400
Better be right this time.

1119
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:30,300
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Inspector.

1120
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:31,900
Everything all sharp and shiny?

1121
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:36,000
The trial is all set
for tomorrow morning.

1122
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:38,800
- Shouldn't take too long.
- That sounds encouraging.

1123
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:43,400
Yes, it's encouraging for me,
but bad for you.

1124
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,000
Have some coffee, Inspector.

1125
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:46,700
You could save yourself
a lot of trouble

1126
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:48,700
if you would tell me
where the jewel is.

1127
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,800
Tuck into some of that porridge.
Guaranteed good for sleuthing.

1128
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:54,700
- You refuse to cooperate?
- We've offered porridge and coffee.

1129
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:55,900
It's all that's left.

1130
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,700
I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves

1131
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:03,600
because you're going to be here
for the next 20 years...

1132
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:17,100
Madame Clouseau.

1133
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:24,100
- Your Highness.
- Madame.

1134
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,300
Won't you sit down?

1135
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,900
I'll be brief and to the point.

1136
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,100
My husband feels
he has enough evidence

1137
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,100
to prove that Sir Charles
is the Phantom

1138
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,200
and to convict George
as his accomplice.

1139
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:40,000
As I see it,
they only have one chance.

1140
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,900
What is that?

1141
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,300
If Your Highness were
to testify on their behalf,

1142
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:49,400
somehow convince the jury
they didn't take the diamond.

1143
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:52,500
- You surprise me, Madame.
- I expect to.

1144
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:56,800
I'm taking the chance you will keep
what I tell you in the strictest confidence.

1145
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:01,300
- I think I can guess.
- It's not too difficult.

1146
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,600
Being the wife
of Inspector Clouseau,

1147
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:06,600
you could have been
very helpful to Charles.

1148
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,200
I have been.

1149
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:12,700
Was stealing my dog
all part of the plan?

1150
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,400
That was the plan.

1151
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:19,300
But I think you should know
that Charles wanted to call it off.

1152
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,800
You've had it all the time.

1153
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,400
You stole the jewel yourself

1154
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,600
before the International Court
made its decision.

1155
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:54,000
I'd sacrifice it to save Charles,
but it's not so simple.

1156
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:56,800
Couldn't you say you found it
on the grounds or something?

1157
01:47:56,900 --> 01:48:00,200
They'd just claim he dropped it
making his escape.

1158
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:03,900
No, to save Charles, we must prove
that someone else stole it.

1159
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
But we’d never
be able to do that.

1160
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:08,500
I have an idea.

1161
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,400
The trial is in its third day.

1162
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,500
Seldom in the history
of Italian jurisprudence

1163
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,200
has a trial created
such intense excitement.

1164
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,400
Thousands of people...

1165
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,600
and it is interesting to note,
most of them women...

1166
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:25,000
have gathered daily
hoping to catch a glimpse

1167
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:26,300
of Sir Charles Litton,

1168
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,200
the man accused of being
the notorious Phantom.

1169
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:32,200
The court adjourned yesterday
as the defense requested time

1170
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:34,700
to investigate certain
new, important evidence.

1171
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,700
And it is rumored that when
the court convenes today,

1172
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,800
the defense will call
a surprise witness.

1173
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,900
The defense has only
one witness, Mr. President.

1174
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,200
Would you call Inspector
Jacques Clouseau to the stand?

1175
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:49,600
Me, a defense witness?

1176
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:52,100
Inspector Clouseau?

1177
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,500
Nothing to worry about.
You'll make fools out of them.

1178
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:09,000
Inspector Clouseau,
you have testified under oath

1179
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:12,900
to certain pertinent facts
concerning this case.

1180
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,900
Your testimony
and your testimony alone

1181
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,800
has been the major factor
in casting suspicion on the defendant.

1182
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,300
Aside from the Phantom himself,

1183
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:23,600
you are the foremost authority
on the Phantom.

1184
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:28,300
I have made
the Phantom my life's work.

1185
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:31,400
You've testified the Phantom
has been a frequent guest

1186
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:34,000
at the numerous parties
given by Miss Angela Dunning.

1187
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:35,600
That is correct, yes.

1188
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:40,200
You've testified it was either during
or sometime soon afterwards

1189
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:43,300
that certain of Miss Dunning's guests
were robbed of their jewels.

1190
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,600
Yes.

1191
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,200
- How many times did this happen?
- Sixteen.

1192
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:52,500
- Sixteen parties, sixteen thefts?
- Yes.

1193
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,000
- Sir Charles attended all sixteen?
- All of them.

1194
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,700
And how many of those parties
did you attend, Inspector?

1195
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,100
All of them.

1196
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,100
Very interesting.

1197
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:08,200
You attended the first party
when the jewels were stolen?

1198
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:09,900
Yes.

1199
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,500
The jewels were stolen
during or after the party?

1200
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,400
After.

1201
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,800
You knew they were
going to be stolen?

1202
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:19,100
- Well, yes.
- How did you know?

1203
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,800
That is the modus operandi
of the Phantom.

1204
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,900
He always works that way.

1205
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,100
I see.

1206
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:31,800
Were the same people
always present at each party?

1207
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:34,000
No, the guest lists varied.

1208
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,400
Outside of Sir Charles,

1209
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:39,100
was anybody else always present
at each of these parties?

1210
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:42,700
No.

1211
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:47,800
Only Sir Charles was present at
each party when there was a robbery?

1212
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:50,000
- Yes.
- I see.

1213
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:54,200
- And what about you?
- Me?

1214
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:57,500
- Yes, you.
- What about me?

1215
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,300
- You were there.
- Yes.

1216
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:03,300
Then Sir Charles was not
the only one present at each party.

1217
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,800
What are you suggesting?

1218
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,300
I'm not suggesting
anything... yet.

1219
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,200
Inspector Clouseau?

1220
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:17,000
How much money do you make?

1221
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:21,900
- What has this got to do with it?
- Your salary...

1222
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,200
How much does
a police inspector get paid?

1223
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:29,300
Enough to buy a wife
a $10,000 mink coat?

1224
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,100
No, of course not.

1225
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,600
You're aware your wife spent $7,000
at Yves St. Laurent only last month?

1226
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,200
What?

1227
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:41,100
- Two months before that, $4,000.
- That's impossible.

1228
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:45,700
Your wife spent at least $30,000
on clothes during the past year.

1229
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,600
Sir, my wife is very frugal.

1230
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:50,400
She saves out of
the housekeeping money.

1231
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:58,500
$30,000 out of
the housekeeping money.

1232
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,600
We have been
married for ten years.

1233
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,200
About the time that
these robberies began

1234
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:07,900
and the notorious Phantom
came into existence, correct?

1235
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,400
Yes! No, not correct!

1236
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:13,500
Of course, not correct.
Of course...

1237
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:17,200
All right, wait. You see...

1238
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:22,300
- It's not Sir Charles!
- He must be the Phantom!

1239
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,700
It must be the inspector.

1240
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,500
He's the Phantom!

1241
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:29,600
Now...

1242
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,300
No, I'm not the Phantom!
No, please! Please!

1243
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:11,300
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank the princess.

1244
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:14,700
- Look at that.
- No, no! I'm not the Phantom!

1245
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,600
No, no, no!
I'm not the Phantom!

1246
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,500
We can't just let him
rot in prison.

1247
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,500
It takes years
for people to rot.

1248
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,700
Besides, when the Phantom
strikes again,

1249
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,700
the inspector will be
as free as a bird.

1250
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,200
Want to come to South America,
George? Family rates?

1251
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,600
- I wouldn't miss it, Uncle Charles.
- That's good.

1252
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:34,300
When I retire, you might
take over the business.

1253
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:49,300
Go back! Go home!

1254
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,300
Crazy woman.

1255
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,600
She's the one who tried
to tear off all his clothes.

1256
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:57,700
- My wife.
- Wife?

1257
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:00,300
You can thank my mother
for the flowers.

1258
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:04,000
You're a national hero.
I envy you.

1259
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:05,400
I'm going to prison.

1260
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:08,600
A few years,
but after you get out...

1261
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,300
Tell me, Inspector...

1262
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,800
Signor Phantom...

1263
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,900
All those robberies...

1264
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,200
How did you ever manage it?

1265
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:27,800
You know...

1266
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,100
It wasn't easy.
