00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,101
Hey, it's cold
out there, man!

175
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,111
I stomped my feet
for five minutes.

176
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,305
Yeah, yeah.

177
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,790
Two cappuccinos.
Make it fast.

178
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,647
Scotch straight up,
please.

179
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,976
Excuse me, Officers.

180
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,812
This may sound like
a wild-goose chase,

181
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,442
but I think
I just saw--

182
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,646
Saw what?

183
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,453
Elvis. Elvis Presley.

184
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,788
Fuckin' tourists.
Ought to be a law.

185
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,160
Excuse me. There's
a large number of you

186
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,699
from the justice department
here this evening.

187
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,666
Is there any particular
reason for that?

188
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,668
Just routine.

189
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,669
Just routine?

190
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,670
Yes.

191
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,671
Any comment, sir?

192
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,763
Not now.

193
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,775
Thank you, sir.
Thanks.

194
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,449
Hey, that's
Colonel Stuart over there.

195
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,678
Got a little problem
with personnel.

196
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,687
Last-minute replacement.

197
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,848
How's the security
around this place?

198
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,892
Like we figured--
a joke.

199
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,291
Colonel Stuart, could we have
a few words, please?

200
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,694
You can have two--
''fuck'' and ''you.''

201
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,232
No pictures,
you pinko bitch.

202
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,565
Old news.

203
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,849
Oh!

204
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,009
Damn it!

205
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,014
Excuse me.

206
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,175
Hey, man.

207
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,177
What is it?

208
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,182
You got a key
for this door?

209
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,683
Yeah. Why?

210
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,583
Because I want you to
open it up, that's why.

211
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,124
Is there a cop on duty
around here?

212
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,454
The airport police.

213
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,858
Go get them.

214
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,085
Ha ha ha!

215
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,156
Hand me the wrench.

216
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,157
Going to work
overtime.

217
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,056
Good idea.

218
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,562
O.K., hold that end.

219
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,655
Watch it, man.

220
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,168
All right.
Perfect. Perfect.

221
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,170
Good to go.

222
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,830
Hey!

223
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,440
It's a restricted area.

224
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,306
What's the matter?

225
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,844
Couldn't wait
for the skycap?

226
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,844
We work here.

227
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,915
Let's see some I.D.

228
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,108
Ha ha.

229
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,208
Sure. No problem.

230
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,524
Oh,jeez. Fuck!

231
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,316
Hiyah!

232
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,966
What is this--
a tag team?

233
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,030
Aah!

234
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,260
Aah!

235
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,701
- Aah!
- Aah!

236
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,078
You say he came in here
and flashed a badge?

237
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,171
Yeah. He said to bring
you guys back here.

238
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,315
Uh! Ah!

239
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,126
Aah! Aah!

240
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,597
Aah! Aah!

241
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,566
Oh!

242
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,141
Christ.

245
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,088
Fucker!

246
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,126
Freeze!

247
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,601
Nice guess, asshole.
I'm a cop.

248
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,364
That was
the bad guy.

249
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,462
Where's your I.D.?

250
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,271
On its way
to Cleveland?

251
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,119
No, you did not
explain anything.

252
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,619
All you did was
shove me back here

253
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,121
into this
cattle car.

254
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,622
Sir, you were told
when you boarded

255
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,124
that we were
overbooked.

256
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,784
Fine. Done.
I accept that.

257
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,123
But why can't I get
the first-class meal?

Do you know who I am?

00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,064
Yes. We've all
seen your program.

260
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,634
Your episode
'' Flying Junkyards''

261
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,204
was a very objective look
at air traffic safety.

262
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,670
It wasn't nearly
as edifying

263
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,333
as '' Bimbos OfThe Sky,''
was it, Connie?

264
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,239
You think
you're funny.

265
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,834
You think you're funny.

266
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,709
Fine.

267
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,145
I've got
your number.

268
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,682
And I've got yours.

269
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,911
So park it, sir.

270
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,112
Fine.

271

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,490
Mr. Thornberg,

273
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,331
you cannot
monopolize my time.

274
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,200
You cannot put me
near that woman.

275
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,738
Excuse me?

276
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,604
He means he's filed
a restraining order

277
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,610
against me.

278
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,875
I'm not allowed
within 50 feet of him.

279
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,916
50 yards.

280
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,110
So by keeping me
in this section,

281
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,619
you are violating
a court order.

282
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,122
I can sue you
and this airline.

283
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,124
That woman assaulted me,

284
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,694
and she humiliated me
in public.

285
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,700
What did you do?

286
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,299
Knocked out
two of his teeth.

287
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,400
Would you like
some champagne?

288
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,581
Sorry, Officer McClane.
I had to check.

289
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,084
Here's your piece

290
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,451
Thanks.

00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,285

292
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,052

there was a shooting.

Hey, come on.
Just a word, O.K.?

296
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,865
What the fuck
are you people--

297
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,366
What are you
doing here, man?

298
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,868
This is a crime scene.

299
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,835
You got to seal
this area off.

00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,998
That's
up to the captain.

301
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,336
Maybe you better take me

302
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,603
up to the captain,
then, huh?

303
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,215
Where's Cochrane?

304
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,290
He didn't make it.

305
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,199
You're late.

00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,203

307
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,933
Some cop...
killed Cochrane.

00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,305
I barely got away,
sir.

309
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,378

your mission?

Yes, sir, but...

Well, then
the damage is minimal.

could be severe.

won't be empty.

that L.A. badge

333
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,439

kidding.

take pictures,
dust for prints.

going to do this?

people go through?

Oh,just
shut the area down.

354
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,306
It's that simple, huh?
Just shut the area down?

355
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,642
Yeah, and I got everybody

356
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,477
from the Shriners'
Convention

357
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,983
to goddamn Boy Scouts
traipsing through here!

358
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,077
I got lost kids,
lost dogs--

359
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,247
Not now! Later!

360
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,483
I got international
diplomats.

361
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,492
I got a fuckin' reindeer
flying in here

362
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,425
from the fuckin'
petting zoo!

363
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,929
ButJohn McClane,
he's got a little problem.

364
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,398
Hell, let's shut down
the whole fuckin' airport!

365
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,093
What do you think
they're going to say upstairs

366
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,431
when I tell them that?

367
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,970
Pick up the phone
and find out.

368
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,937
I don't need
fuckin' Forensics

369
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,440
to tell me
all this was

370
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,009
was some punk
stealing luggage!

371
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,170
Luggage? That punk
pulled a Glock 7 on me.

372
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,508
You know what that is?

373
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,445
It's a porcelain gun
made in Germany.

374
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,483
It doesn't show up
on your airport X-ray machines

375
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,450
and costs more than
you make in a month.

376
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,748
You'd be surprised
what I make in a month.

377
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,756
If it's more than $1 .98,
I'd be very surprised.

378
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,450
Hey, McClane,
don't start believing

379
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,958
your own press, huh?

380
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,824
Yeah, yeah,
I know all about you

381
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,487
and that Nakatomi thing
in L.A.,

382
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,964
but just because the TV
thinks you're hot shit,

383
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,091
that don't make it so.

384
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,261
Look, you are
in my little pond now,

385
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,636
and I am the big fish
that runs it.

386
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,505
So you capped
some lowlife.

387
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,600
Fine.

388
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,976
I'll send your
fuckin' captain in L.A.

389
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,480
a fuckin' commendation!

390
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,607
In the meantime,
get the hell out of my office

391
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,482
before I have you
thrown out of my goddamn airport!

392
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,431
Hey, Carmine, let me
ask you something.

393
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,059
What sets off the metal
detectors first--

394
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,798
the lead in your ass or
the shit in your brains?

395
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,498
Fat fuck.

396
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,985
Any I.D. on this guy?

397
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,020
That's somebody else's
problem.

398
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,721
Your car's ready.
Sign right here.

399
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,727
I need to borrow
this and this.

400
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,956
I'll bring it
right back.

401
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,965
Hey! Yo!
Hold up!

402
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,534
Yo!

403
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,471
Hold up, boys.
Hold up. Hold up.

404
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,473
We got to check
something.

405
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,475
What are you doing?

406
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,477
Pretty gruesome
fuckin'job.

407
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,479
All the confusion
in there,

408
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,879
forgot to get
this clown's prints.

409
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,913
Ew! Christ.

410
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,419
Hey, you're supposed
to do that at the morgue.

411
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,080
Not anymore.

412
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,987
Got a new S.O.P.
for DOAs from the FAA.

413
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,428
Ha ha! I don't think
this one's going to make it, boys.

414
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,998
Thanks a lot.

415
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,867
[Speaking Spanish]

416
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,534
Ahh.

417
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,975
[Ring]

418
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,037
Powell here.

419
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,375
Take that Twinkie
out of your mouth

420
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,642
and grab a pencil,
will ya?

421
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,412
Ha ha! Hey,John,
how are you doing?

422
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,112
Holly stood me up
a day,

423
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,984
and I'm here alone
in D.C.

424
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,614
with my in-laws.

425
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,625
Eh, the old in-laws, huh?

426
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,491
They do love their
policemen son-in-laws.

427
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,961
Listen, Al,

428
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,294
what is the fax machine
telephone number

429
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,958
there at the station?

430
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,433
Uh...

431
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,938
5 5 5-3 21 2.

432
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,634
3 21 2. Hold on a second,
all right?

433
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,143
I want to send you
something.

434
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,177
Excuse me.

435
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,646
[Al] You and faxes?
This is a first.

436
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,148
Yeah, well,
Holly told me

437
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,309
I should wake up
and smell the nineties.

438
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,511
This way?

439
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,747
No. That way.

440
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,153
Wait.
It's upside down.

441
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,656
It doesn't matter.

442
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,226
O.K. Here it comes.

443
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,763
I'm sending you
something right now.

444
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,162
Hold on a second,
cowboy.

445
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,937
[Beep]

446
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:23,946
Fingerprints?

447
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,381
We've got an unidentified
stiff here.

448
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,610
I've circled
the whirls in pen

449
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,277
in case the transmission's
a little fuzzy.

450
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,945
Listen, run it
through state and federal,

451
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,546
and if you can,
run it through Interpol.

452
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,989
Will do.
Well, what's this about?

453
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,526
Oh,just a feeling
I have.

454
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,789
Ouch. When you get
those feelings,

455
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,024
insurance companies
start to go bankrupt.

456
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,930
Listen, the, uh,
fax number is...

457
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,502
Is on the top edge
of the transmission...

458
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,367
Is on the top edge

459
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,702
of the transmission
you just got.

460
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,834
Oh, an airport, huh?

461
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,004
Listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

462
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,308
Ha ha. Yeah.

463
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,383
And I'm fresh
out of chlorine.

464
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,889
Just as this storm
starts breaking,

465
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,928
the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.

466
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,088
Look at this new front
moving in.

467
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,496
Makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.

468
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,929
Well, I can sand down
all the runways

469
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,834
and keep the plows going
between landings,

470
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,839
but you got to
downshift them up there,

471
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,272
give me time to work.

472
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,502
You got it.

473
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,135
All right, everyone.

474
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,113
Let's call all our birds
and slow them down

475
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,946
before we get a parking lot
over our heads.

476
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,952
The line starts
at the Mississippi,

477
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,113
and they better start
taking numbers.

478
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,056
Can I get you another?

479
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,297
No, thank you.

480
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,100
I only have to
look at his face

481
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,571
for another 1 5
or 20 minutes.

482
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:01,078
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is the captain speaking.</i>

483
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,340
I've just been informed
by Dulles Traffic Control

484
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,848
that there's a weather front
moving in ahead of us.

485
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,545
We may be up here
a little while longer.

486
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,916
Thank you.

487
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,489
On second
thought...

488
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,828
[Ring]

489
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:20,829
Al?

490
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,832
Hey, I'm right here,
partner.

491
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,767
Your stiff's dossier is
coming through right now.

492
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,038
What can you
tell me about him?

493
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,334
He's dead.

494
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,535
You needed a computer
to figure that one out?

495
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,441
No, no. You don't
follow me.

496
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,605
According to
the Department of Defense,

497
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,740
he's been dead
for two years.

498
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,112
What?

499
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,085
That's right. Sergeant
Oswald Cochrane.

500
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,780
American adviser
in Honduras.

501
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,484
Killed in a helicopter
accident 5-1 1 -88.

502
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,117
Officer.

503
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,628
Read between the lines,
and I'd say it looks

504
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,631
like a lot of black-bag
stuff to me.

505
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,132
Yeah, I see it.

506
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,792
All right, Al.
Thanks a lot.

507
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,800
Hey, anytime.

508
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,029
O.K.

509
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,734
Say, I close
in about an hour.

510
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,140
Maybe we can go
get a drink?

511
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,179
Just the fax, ma'am.

512
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,771
Just the fax.

513
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,584
Hey, wait a second.
Wait. I see somebody.

514
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,952
I'll call you back.

515
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,722
The Ghost
of Christmas Past.

516
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,266
Nakatomi? L.A.? You're
John McClane, right?

517
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,767
Who are you?

518
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,134
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

519
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,638
Excuse me.

520
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,833
Give me a break.
I saw the stiff.

521
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,376
Word is that was
your handiwork.

522
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,878
No. I only do
needlepoint.

523
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,110
Great. National
just shut down.

524
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,882
Totally iced.

525
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,117
They're going to
be sending us their planes.

526
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,283
Happy, happy holiday.

527
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,621
The worst part,
Mr. Trudeau,

528
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,786
was the press.

529
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,454
Oh, they were
here anyways,

530
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,531
crawling all over
the Esperanza story,

531
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,463
so they got it right
on the fucking news.

532
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,966
You know,
bloodstains and all.

533
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,127
Personally, I'd like
to lock every damn reporter

534
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,137
out of the airport,
but then they'd just pull

535
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,139
that freedom-of-speech
crap on us.

536
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,106
Then the ACLU would be
all over us.

537
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,472
Murder on television.

538
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,240
Hell of a start
for Christmas weekend.

539
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,942
What is it? A gang thing
like last time?

540
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,849
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

541
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,220
Who the hell
is this?

542
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,221
Uh-uh,
McClane.

543
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,757
I'm a police officer.

544
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,326
In an unauthorized area.

545
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,054
L.A., Mr. Trudeau,
don't mean shit.

546
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,824
That's what I said
about my last
cholesterol test.

547
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,629
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

548
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,499
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo
has explained to you

549
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,768
the minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.

550
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,503
Maybe he can explain this.

551
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,191
All systems
tapped, Colonel.

552
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,696
Fire it up.

553
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,647
'' H'' minus five minutes.

554
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,216
Stand by.

555
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,213
All right. We've got
a body in the morgue

556
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,754
that seems
to have died twice.

557
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,084
Assuming it's not
a computer error,

558
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,351
what do we assume?

559
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,653
That somebody's about
to seriously fuck

560
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,784
with this airport.

561
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,590
What is that
supposed to mean?

562
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,596
I mean, I know we're dummies
up here, McClane,

563
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,791
so give us a taste
of your genius.

564
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,300
This a hijacking?
A robbery? What?

565
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,926
Look, I'm not sure.

566
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,938
Oh, he's not sure.
Well, I'm stunned.

567
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,439
I got to lie down.

568
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,509
The only people that go
to this much trouble

569
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,635
are professionals--
not luggage thieves and not punks.

570
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,179
Professional at what?

571
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,509
What the fuck do you
think this is, huh,

572
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,707
the safety patrol here?

573
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,807
This is the resume
of a professional mercenary.

574
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,682
You got the world's
biggest drug dealer on his way here.

575
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,687
You need a slide rule
to figure this out,

576
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,484
or maybe another
body in a zipper bag

577
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,785
before you start
asking questions?

578
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,224
You're the one that gave us
that fucking body.

579
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,226
Remember that.

580
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,762
Yeah, I remember that.

581
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:22,367
Lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in. Now.

582
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,033
What? You're not
buying into this?

583
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,077
I want them to report
anything out of the ordinary,

584
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,873
no matter how trivial.
You got that?

585
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,038
Yeah, I got it.

586
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,206
Oh, my God!

587
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,544
What?

588
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,049
The runways.

589
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,983
What the hell?

590
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,315
They're shutting down.

591
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,548
Jesus Christ.

592
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,661
Go to emergency
lighting now.

593
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,131
Emergency. We are
in a code yellow.

594
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,031
Backup systems
won't come up.

595
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,228
Shunt to another
terminal.

596
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,828
Bobby, what
do you got?

597
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,907
Nothing.
The whole network is down.

598
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,771
Maybe we should call
the power company, huh?

599
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,673
We're on the same goddamn grid.
We're hot.

600
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,678
<i>Dulles, what's going on?</i>
<i>I'm on approach.</i>

601
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,111
Maintain position. Repeat.

602
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,183
<i>What's going on down there?</i>

603
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,444
Roger. We're on it.

604
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,780
We're unable right now.
Please delay.

605
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:12,287
Fuji 604. Execute published
missed-approach procedure

606
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,550
and hold.

607
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,126
TWA 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

608
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,923
Climb to and maintain
one zero thousand.

609
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,090
I've checked all systems.
It ain't happening.

610
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,638
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

611
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,147
What's it
look like?

612
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,648
Approach control--
it's gone.

613
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,845
Jesus. Instrument
landing system is down.

614
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,389
Confirmed.
I LS is dead.

615
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,925
Every goddamn
system's dead.

616
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,495
And Inmac monitors
are down.

617
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,600
Attention all controllers.
Attention.

618
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,137
We have a code-red alert.

619
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,797
Every aircraft
approaching our sector

620
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,898
who are not already
in our landing pattern

621
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,136
gets diverted
to their alternate airport now.

622
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:11,113
Everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern

623
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,615
holds at the outer markers.

624
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,619
Stack 'em, pack 'em,
and rack 'em.

625
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,745
Move.

626
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,255
Get someone on it!

627
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,689
[Beeping]

628
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,452
All right. Not a word
of this leaves this room.

629
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,032
There must be 1 5,000 people
in this airport,

630
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,693
and we don't need panic
on our hands.

631
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,828
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

632
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,838
After that,
those planes low on fuel

633
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,805
aren't going to
be circling.

634
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,605
They're going to be dropping
on the White House lawn.

635
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,747
McClane, this
what you expected?

636
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,148
No.

637
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,244
This is just
the beginning.

638
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,358
[Beeping]

639
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,791
FAA hot line.

640
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,521
How could they
know already?

641
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,926
They can't.

642
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,892
Maybe it's the boys
that pulled all your plugs.

643
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,333
Put it on speaker.

644
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:10,339
<i>Attention, Dulles Tower.</i>
<i>Attention.</i>

645
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,466
<i>They say that blind men</i>
<i>become very attentive</i>

646
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,771
<i>by way of compensation.</i>

647
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,505
<i>Now that you're both</i>
<i>blind and deaf,</i>

648
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,604
<i>I think I've got</i>
<i>your attention.</i>

649
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,616
<i>I'm aware your recorders</i>
<i>are active,</i>

650
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,117
<i>so I'll be quick.</i>

651
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,552
<i>You can play me back later</i>
<i>to your heart's content.</i>

652
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,146
How did you get on this line?
Who is this?

653
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,624
<i>Who I am is unimportant.</i>

654
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,126
<i>What I want...</i>

655
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,958
Well, if you don't want
those planes

656
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,793
to start splashing
into the Potomac

657
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,457
as they run out
of fuel,

658
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,262
what I want is
very important.

659
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,462
<i>Aplane will be landing</i>
<i>at this airport</i>

660
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,902
<i>in 58 minutes.</i>

661
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,237
<i>It is FM-1,</i>
<i>Foreign Military One.</i>

662
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,140
<i>Now, I'm sure you gentlemen</i>
<i>are well aware</i>

663
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,177
<i>of the unique nature...</i>

664
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,211
Esperanza?

665
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,473
<i>of this flight,</i>

666
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:51,809
<i>the importance</i>
<i>of its cargo.</i>

667
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,817
This plane will not
be met by anyone.

668
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,320
It will land on a runway
of my designation,

669
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,721
where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.

670
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,260
That will conclude my interest
in this aircraft

671
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,125
and your responsibility
for it.

672
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,599
At the same time, I want
a 7 47 cargo conversion

673
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:14,398
fully fueled
and placed at my disposal.

674
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,339
<i>You have two more minutes</i>
<i>to advise your inbound aircraft</i>

675
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,875
<i>to hold at their</i>
<i>outer radio marker.</i>

676
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,775
<i>After that,you will be</i>
<i>able to receive only.</i>

677
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,711
<i>Any attempt to restore</i>
<i>your systems</i>

678
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,545
<i>will be met</i>
<i>by severe penalties.</i>

679
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,676
He's bluffing.

680
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,385
Damn it,
you can't do this.

681
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,457
I am doing this.

682
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,288
O.K., you guys,
listen up.

683
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,129
I need you to punch up
a code 1 5.

684
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,135
I got an idea,
and I need your help.

685
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,431
If Esperanza gets
on that plane

686
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,335
and makes it to a country
with no extradition treaties,

687
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,634
we're fucked.

688
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,800
They're talking to us
on our own system.

689
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,002
They got to be close.

690
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,738
I'll have my men tear
this airport apart.

691
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,746
Just in the nick
of time, huh?

692
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,043
Hey, McClane, I got
a first-class unit here,

693
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,243
S.W.A.T. team and all.

694
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,842
We don't need
any Monday-morning quarterbacks.

695
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,252
My wife's on one
of the goddamn planes

696
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,254
these guys
are fucking with.

697
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,585
That puts me
on the playing field.

698
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,751
If you'd have moved your fat ass
when I told you to,

699
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,623
we wouldn't be hip deep
in shit right now.

700
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,629
That's it. Security.
You're out of here.

701
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,756
Mr. Trudeau, do I
have to remind you

702
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,026
about FAA regulations

703
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,294
regarding
unauthorized personnel

704
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,494
in the control tower?

705
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,629
All we have to do is find
a way to transmit.

706
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,434
Yeah, right. Somebody want
to run down to Radio Shack

707
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,439
and get a transmitter?

708
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,509
We already have one.

709
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,339
The new terminal wing
they're building--

710
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,673
20 airlines
when it's done,

711
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,337
all with their own
reservation computers,

712
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,416
all tied in to a nice
big antenna arrangement.

713
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,416
You'd better see
Mr. McClane out.

714
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,281
You got no business
being up here.

715
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,287
I'm telling you guys.
Everything we need

716
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,856
is over
by the Annex Skywalk

717
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,515
just sitting there,
waiting to go on line.

718
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,524
The Annex Skywalk?

719
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:43,685
Goddamn it, Trudeau.

720
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:44,852
You're dealing
with pros here.

721
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,452
You can't fuck
with these people.

722
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,464
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

723
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,794
Mr. Trudeau, there
are a lot of rumors

724
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,867
flying around here
today.

725
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,196
No way. No way, lady.

726
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,327
Hell, no. No.

727
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,598
This is off limits,
Coleman.

728
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,196
Get them
out of here.

729
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,868
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!

730
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,877
Get your fucking hands
off me.

731
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,879
For shit's sake.
Just get them both out of here.

732
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,216
Lobby Security,
come in.

733
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,216
Tomalson here.

734
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,911
This is
Captain Lorenzo here

735
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,818
with two unauthorized personnel
in the fucking tower.

736
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,186
Now, would you get your thumb
out of your ass,

737
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,486
get them
out of the elevator,

738
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,493
or you're going to find
a goddamn pink slip

739
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,324
in your Christmas
stocking.

740
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,727
1 0-4. Let's go.

741
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,425
Goddamn!

742
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,092
Anything who
can think of?

743
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,100
Can't fuck
with what guy?

744
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,500
Shit. Hang on
over there.

745
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,629
Just hang on.

746
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,174
Big drug dealer on
his way to prison,

747
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,504
gunfight at airport,

748
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,511
every controller
in the coffee shop

749
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,171
getting beeped
and hauling ass,

750
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,680
and you rocking
the boat.

751
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,011
Connection?
Come on, McClane.

752
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,175
Just a few words.

753
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,912
O.K.,just a few words.
Fuck off.

754
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,514
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

755
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,855
Stuart. The guy that got
canned by Congress.

756
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,052
That's who he was.

757
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,790
Huh? Who he who?
What? Hey!

758
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,924
Shh! It's O.K.
I've done this before.

759
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,209
Hi.

760
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,042
Where's the other one?

761
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,172
Claustrophobic,
I guess.

762
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,812
It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so close

763
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,081
it doesn't matter.

764
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,986
I can rig our frequency
in 30 minutes,

765
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,820
wire in a crossover,
and we're hot.

766
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,723
Even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.

767
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,695
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

768
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,163
I want my S.W.A.T. team
to go with him as cover.

769
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,826
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.

770
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,174
Oh, man. I can't
fucking believe this.

771
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,176
Another basement.
Another elevator.

772
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:45,738
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

773

The Skywalk
Annex.

814
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,533
No, Goddamn it.
The Annex Skywalk.

815
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,045

I heard

816
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,079
before they
kicked me out.

817
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,376
Well, let me
see here, now.

818
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,281
Well, this must be it
right there.

819
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,911
See? That's
the raised platform,

820
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,115
and there's
the new terminal.

821
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,623
There's your Skywalk.

822
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,920
Goddamn bottleneck.

823
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,588
Nice place
for an ambush.

00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:47,891

00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,659
you can get me
out to that spot?

This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.
We'll watch your back.

Yeah? Who watches yours?

00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,190

normal Christmas...

834
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:29,371
Eggnog, a fucking
Christmas tree,

835
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,373
a little turkey...

836
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:34,376
But, no, I got
to crawl around

837
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,969

motherfucking tin can.

some more equipment.

of your guys back for it.

844
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,395
Right, sir.
You got it.

845
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,499
What the hell's
going on?

846
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,595
Hey! Put that
back on!

847
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:07,505
Hey, asshole,
what do I look like to you?

848
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,841

Shit!

851
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:20,355
Damn it.
I hate it when I'm right.

852
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,461
Look out!
Get down!

853
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,700
Aah!

854
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,955
Aah!

855
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,457
Stay down!

856
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,009
Fuck!

857
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,316
Come on.

858
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,039
Fucking son

859
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,085
Aah!

860
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,026
Shit.

861
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,066
Ah. Oh.

862
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,444
I'm going to kick
your fucking ass.

863
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,145
Jeez.

864
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,771
You all right?

865
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,474
Yeah. Yeah.
But the antenna array--

866
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,744
I got to get to it
and set it up.

867
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,850
Get down!

868
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,371
Goddamn.

869
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,245
Bait.

870
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,352
Jerk us off,

871
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:47,014
make Lorenzo sacrifice
his best men.

872
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,429
Make you waste
your time...

873
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,331
time we don't have.

874
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,816
I think you're closer
than 50 yards.

875
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,479
So's that airplane.
Practically.

876
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,920
Yeah. There's quite
a few of them out there.

877
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,924
It looks like
a regular traffic jam.

878
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,051
There's nothing
regular about it.

879
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,494
See? You're intrigued.

880
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,155
That's my gift,
Mrs. McClane.

881
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,426
I notice things--

882
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,331
things other people
wouldn't see.

883
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,269
That's how I make
people curious.

884
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,203
Don't you mean
nauseous?

885
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,832
Look. The people have
a right to know

886
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,342
everything about everybody.

887
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,777
You got
in the way of that.

888
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,713
Listen, buster, you
endangered my children,

889
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,341
and you didn't do it

890
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,352
for anything as noble
as the people.

891
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,354
The only time you even
see the people

892
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,219
is when you look down

893
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,918
to see what it is
you're stepping on.

894
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:00,851
Me? Yeah, I'll live,

895
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:03,353
but Lorenzo's
S.W.A.T. team is dead,

896
00:50:03,455 --> 00:50:05,855
and the antenna array
is gone.

897
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:06,856
[Beeping]

898
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:09,860
Didn't you see it?

899
00:50:09,962 --> 00:50:12,931
It's hard looking
for a new miracle.

900
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:15,364
Just hold
for a minute.

901
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:16,695
I'll be
right back.

902
00:50:16,802 --> 00:50:17,700
Just hold
for a second.

903
00:50:17,803 --> 00:50:18,701
Something's
going on here.

904
00:50:18,804 --> 00:50:21,864
Yeah.Just hold on
for a minute.

905
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:25,876
I say again, Annex Team,
give us a sit rep.

906
00:50:25,978 --> 00:50:28,947
Annex Team, come in.
Do you copy?

907
00:50:30,516 --> 00:50:32,279
It's got some kind
of scrambler on it.

908
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:34,352
Can you do anything
with it?

909
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:36,585
No.
This scramble mode

910
00:50:36,688 --> 00:50:38,588
must activate
on this code panel.

911
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,817
Even if we scan
their frequency,

912
00:50:40,926 --> 00:50:41,984
we can't listen in.

913
00:50:42,094 --> 00:50:43,925
These guys are pros.

914
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:45,053
So are you.
Break the code.

915
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:46,188
I want to hear

916
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:47,560
what these bastards are
saying to each other.

917
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:48,963
This is a 1 0-digit
control panel.

918
00:50:49,068 --> 00:50:50,057
Six-digit read-out.

919
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:52,660
Hell, there could be
a million combinations.

920
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:54,671
Next time you kill one
of these guys,

921
00:50:54,773 --> 00:50:56,707
get him to enter
the code first.

922
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:57,935
Yeah.

923
00:50:59,078 --> 00:51:00,909
Sir, we just
monitored a call

924
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:02,605
from their
chief engineer.

925
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:05,274
Our people took out
their S.W.A.T. team completely.

926
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:07,352
You were right.
They went for the antenna array.

927
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:08,511
We're right
on schedule.

928
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,589
Losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.

929
00:51:16,962 --> 00:51:18,827
Attention, Dulles Tower.

930
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:20,626
<i>Attention,</i>

933

Try me face to face,
and we'll see.

934
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:29,604
You were warned not to try
to restore your systems.

<i>You've wasted lives</i>

<i>on a futile</i>
<i>and obvious target.</i>

937
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:36,342
Now you're going
to pay the penalty.

938
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:38,643
I've got five dead officers
down here, Colonel Stuart.

939
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,479
Isn't that penalty enough?

940
00:51:40,586 --> 00:51:41,951
McClane,
you keep out of this.

941
00:51:42,054 --> 00:51:43,282

nothing but a pain--

946
00:51:58,804 --> 00:52:00,032
Hey, Colonel,
blow me.

947
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:01,367
How much drug money

948
00:52:01,473 --> 00:52:04,169
is Esperanza paying you
to turn traitor?

949
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:05,834
Cardinal Richelieu
said it best.

950
00:52:05,944 --> 00:52:08,139
Treason is merely
a matter of dates.

Communist aggression.

956
00:52:19,558 --> 00:52:21,355

with killing policemen?

<i>What's lesson two--</i>
<i>the neutron bomb?</i>

958
00:52:25,464 --> 00:52:27,989
No. I think we can find

00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:07,389
We got no sign
of survivors down here.

1055
00:59:07,499 --> 00:59:08,989
It's a goddamn nightmare.

1056
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:13,230
Hey, Nelson!
Come here.

1057
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:24,442
Barnes!

1058
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,015
We've got to
warn those planes

1059
00:59:27,118 --> 00:59:28,949
there's a lunatic
down here.

1060
00:59:29,054 --> 00:59:31,079
Get up to the cabin.
Get me on the air.

1061
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:32,087
How?

1062
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,521
You figure it out!

1063
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:35,058
Here's the manifest.

1064
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,472
McClane, I know
how you must feel.

1065
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:06,081
I wanted to help
those people.

1066
01:00:07,492 --> 01:00:10,723
I was pretty
goddamn useless.

1067
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:15,898
We called
the government for help.

1068
01:00:16,001 --> 01:00:19,835
They're going to send in
a special Army unit,

1069
01:00:19,938 --> 01:00:21,929
a counterterrorist team.

1070
01:00:28,947 --> 01:00:31,848
Your wife's plane?

1071
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,247
Well, they're
still broadcasting

1072
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:35,717
even though
we can't answer them.

1073
01:00:37,722 --> 01:00:40,782
They're going to run out of fuel
in 90 minutes.

1074
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:53,869
Listen, Dick.

1075
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:55,701
That is your name?

1076
01:00:55,807 --> 01:00:56,899
Dick.

1077
01:00:57,008 --> 01:00:58,873
If you're going to continue
to get this close,

1078
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:00,877
do you think
you might consider

1079
01:01:00,979 --> 01:01:02,344
switching
after-shaves?

1080
01:01:03,481 --> 01:01:05,676
Anything else?

1081
01:01:05,784 --> 01:01:08,844
Stronger mouthwash
might be nice.

1082
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:10,045
<i>And here's Sam Coleman</i>

1083
01:01:10,155 --> 01:01:11,884
<i>reporting live</i>
<i>from the site of the accident.</i>

1084
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,048
Well, Colonel,

1085
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:14,887
they've done everything
we've anticipated...

1086
01:01:14,993 --> 01:01:16,392
so far.

1087
01:01:16,494 --> 01:01:18,621
<i>But still there has been</i>
<i>no official word.</i>

1088
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:20,823
<i>Meanwhile, despite the fact</i>

1089
01:01:20,932 --> 01:01:23,833
<i>only one runway has been</i>
<i>closed due to the tragedy,</i>

1090
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:26,733
<i>several dozen airliners are</i>
<i>visible from where I stand,</i>

1091
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:28,237
<i>endlessly</i>
<i>circling the field.</i>

1092
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:30,830
<i>Other reports say that</i>
<i>there was trouble in the tower</i>

1093
01:01:30,942 --> 01:01:32,341
<i>before the crash</i>

1094
01:01:32,444 --> 01:01:34,207
<i>and that that may have even</i>
<i>contributed to it.</i>

1095
01:01:34,312 --> 01:01:35,404
<i>One thing is certain.</i>

1096
01:01:35,513 --> 01:01:36,878
<i>With weather conditions</i>
<i>worsening,</i>

1097
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:38,881
<i>the problem here</i>
<i>and in the sky above us</i>

1098
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:40,382
<i>will continue to grow.</i>

1099
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:43,784
<i>I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles</i>
<i>International Airport.</i>

1100
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:51,796
Victor. Victor.

1101
01:01:51,896 --> 01:01:52,794
Victor.

1102
01:01:52,897 --> 01:01:53,955
Yeah, what's up?

1103
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:55,396
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot,

1104
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,899
or did you put them
in your carry-on?

1105
01:01:57,001 --> 01:01:58,059
Are you crazy?

1106
01:01:58,169 --> 01:01:59,568
I wouldn't let those assholes
check them in.

1107
01:01:59,671 --> 01:02:00,899
I love you.

1108
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:02,996
Give me one
of the receivers.

1109
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:10,412
Can you tune in
to the cockpit frequency?

1110
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:11,914
Yeah. Why?

1111
01:02:12,016 --> 01:02:14,746
I want to hear
what's going on.

1112
01:02:15,854 --> 01:02:18,880
Should be right here
on our band.

1113
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,321
Nothing.

1114
01:02:20,425 --> 01:02:21,323
You just told me
it would work.

1115
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:22,324
Is it working
or not working?

1116
01:02:22,427 --> 01:02:23,325
It is working,
but it's--

1117
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:24,417
All I'm getting

1118
01:02:24,529 --> 01:02:26,929
is some kind
of airport beacon.

1119
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:27,929
It's weird.

1120
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:30,865
It's like the tower
isn't there.

1121
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:34,027
Stay on it.

1122
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:37,468
Let me know when there is
something there.

1123
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:38,872
O.K.

1124
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:18,912
Major Grant.
We're Blue Light.

1125
01:03:19,017 --> 01:03:19,915
Rollins, Department
ofJustice.

1126
01:03:20,018 --> 01:03:21,918
Trudeau, Chief
of Air Operations.

1127
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,284
Lorenzo,
Terminal Police.

1128
01:03:24,389 --> 01:03:26,289
You want something,
you got it.

1129
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:27,358
This is it?

1130
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:29,392
One fucking platoon?

1131
01:03:29,494 --> 01:03:31,860
One Crisis-1 Platoon.
Who are you?

1132
01:03:31,963 --> 01:03:33,055
John McClane.

1133
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:35,962
McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.

1134
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:36,965
Yeah.

1135
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:39,468
Now show some
good sense.

1136
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:41,163
Let the pros
handle this.

1137
01:03:41,272 --> 01:03:42,933
Yeah, well,
it looks like

1138
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:44,440
the pros are on
the wrong team tonight.

1139
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:45,770
Isn't Colonel Stuart
one of your men?

1140
01:03:45,877 --> 01:03:47,435
No, not anymore,
he's not.

1141
01:03:47,545 --> 01:03:48,443
Now we're here

1142
01:03:48,546 --> 01:03:49,638
to take Colonel
Stuart down.

1143
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:51,977
And we will
take him down.

1144
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,448
You see,
I served with him.

1145
01:03:53,551 --> 01:03:55,246
I taught him
everything he knows.

1146
01:03:55,353 --> 01:03:56,945
Well, maybe
he's learned

1147
01:03:57,055 --> 01:03:59,080
a few more things
since then.

1148
01:04:00,558 --> 01:04:01,582
Let's hustle!

1149
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:03,388
The command post
will be set up

1150
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:04,893
in the airport
police station.

1151
01:04:04,996 --> 01:04:06,896
I want to be
tied in to the tower

1152
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:07,896
in 1 5 minutes.

1153
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:09,990
All right,
let's do it!

1154
01:04:11,102 --> 01:04:12,660
Hey, Trudeau.

1155
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:17,005
Did things just get
better or worse?

1156
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:23,346
Lights--
big, portable lights.

1157
01:04:23,448 --> 01:04:25,507
We set up the field,
and then we--

1158
01:04:25,617 --> 01:04:26,675
We wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out.

1159
01:04:26,784 --> 01:04:28,843
And where do we get
those big, portable lights--

1160
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:29,851
Borrow them
from Batman?

1161
01:04:29,954 --> 01:04:31,854
What about
the airphone idea?

1162
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:32,854
There's 1 8 planes
up there.

1163
01:04:32,957 --> 01:04:34,754
Only five of them
have those phones.

1164
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:35,757
We got through
to three of them.

1165
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,225
We're still trying
on the others.

1166
01:04:37,328 --> 01:04:39,057
That leaves 1 3 accidents
waiting to happen.

1167
01:04:39,163 --> 01:04:40,061
Are they still
bucking head winds?

1168
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:41,062
I just checked
the weather.

1169
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:42,223
Head winds are
slamming everybody

1170
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,231
over the outer marker.

1171
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:44,392
The planes
with enough fuel

1172
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:46,402
have already been
shunted to Atlanta,

1173
01:04:46,504 --> 01:04:47,903
Memphis, and Nashville.

1174
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:49,735
Outer marker.

1175
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:51,741
Damn!

1176
01:04:51,843 --> 01:04:53,401
The outer marker!

1177
01:04:53,511 --> 01:04:54,910
It's a beacon, right?

1178
01:04:55,013 --> 01:04:56,913
It sends out this
''beep beep beep''

1179
01:04:57,015 --> 01:04:58,573
so they know they're
over it, right?

1180
01:04:58,683 --> 01:04:59,911
So?

1181
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:01,007
So who says
that radio signal

1182
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,051
has to just beep?

1183
01:05:02,153 --> 01:05:03,415
Right.
We switch the frequency

1184
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:04,886
from the tower
over to the one in the beacon.

1185
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:06,752
We pump up the wattage.

1186
01:05:06,858 --> 01:05:07,825
And we can talk
to our planes,

1187
01:05:07,926 --> 01:05:08,824
and those bastards
who did this

1188
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:09,916
will never know!

1189
01:05:13,464 --> 01:05:14,863
Traced the signal.

1190
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:16,433
Found it in
the luggage area.

1191
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:17,432
They've been tapped in

1192
01:05:17,535 --> 01:05:19,196
to your tower chatter
all night.

1193
01:05:19,304 --> 01:05:21,295
Punks stealing luggage,
huh, Carmine?

1194
01:05:24,976 --> 01:05:26,375
How you doing,
Telford?

1195
01:05:26,477 --> 01:05:27,375
No good.

1196
01:05:27,478 --> 01:05:28,376
I called Lang.

1197
01:05:28,479 --> 01:05:29,878
They're rigging
a portable decoder.

1198
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:31,141
It'll be here
in two hours.

1199
01:05:31,249 --> 01:05:32,876
My wife doesn't
have two hours.

1200
01:05:32,984 --> 01:05:35,384
I was only transferred
to Grant's team yesterday.

1201
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:37,386
The regular guy
got appendicitis.

1202
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:40,321
Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

1203
01:05:40,425 --> 01:05:41,722
Attention!

1204
01:05:41,826 --> 01:05:44,386
Except maybe
Colonel Stuart.

1205
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:46,394
I want to hear about

1206
01:05:46,497 --> 01:05:48,658
the plane
those bastards asked for.

1207
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:49,960
Then I'll fill you in
on my orders.

1208
01:05:50,068 --> 01:05:51,899
Pilots' briefing room.
Now.

1209
01:05:52,003 --> 01:05:52,901
Keep working.

1210
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:54,972
Albertson.
With me.

1211
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:01,736
No civilians.

1212
01:06:12,523 --> 01:06:14,286
What the fuck?

1213
01:06:14,392 --> 01:06:16,417
What is it?

1214
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,358
The outer marker beeper.

1215
01:06:18,463 --> 01:06:21,626
It isn't beeping.
It's talking.

1216
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:23,860
<i>Attention all aircraft</i>
<i>in Dulles landing pattern.</i>

1217
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:26,027
<i>This is Chief Engineer</i>
<i>Leslie Barnes.</i>

1218
01:06:26,137 --> 01:06:28,867
<i>I have been authorized</i>
<i>to brief you in full.</i>

1219
01:06:28,973 --> 01:06:33,376
<i>At this time, this is the only</i>
<i>channel available to us.</i>

1220
01:06:33,478 --> 01:06:35,878
<i>Here is the situation.</i>

1221
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:38,210
<i>Approximately two hours ago...</i>

1222
01:06:40,985 --> 01:06:42,885
Wait until you
get a load of this.

1223
01:06:42,987 --> 01:06:45,387
<i>Do not accept any instructions</i>
<i>claiming to be from our tower</i>

1224
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,084
<i>unless you hear your own</i>
<i>flight recoder access code.</i>

1225
01:06:48,192 --> 01:06:49,250
<i>The terrorists</i>
<i>have got all...</i>

1226
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,258
Holy shit!

1227
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:51,259
<i>our systems and now...</i>

1228

01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:04,575
He's going to hell!

1402
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:05,800
McClane!

1403
01:17:05,909 --> 01:17:09,606
I assume
it's you, McClane.

1404
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:12,113
You're quite
a little soldier.

1405
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:16,209
You can consider this
a military funeral!

1406
01:17:31,902 --> 01:17:34,132
Aah!

1407
01:17:39,309 --> 01:17:41,641
How many grenades
we got?

1408
01:17:41,745 --> 01:17:43,906
Three each!

1409
01:17:44,014 --> 01:17:45,072
Use them!

1410
01:17:55,192 --> 01:17:56,523
Oh, my--

1411
01:18:11,442 --> 01:18:12,932
Go!

1412
01:18:25,656 --> 01:18:29,558
Aah!

1413
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,218
Oh, shit!

1414
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:42,070
You lucky fuck.

1415
01:18:42,172 --> 01:18:43,799
[Siren]

1416
01:18:45,442 --> 01:18:46,602
Fire trucks, sir.

1417
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:49,679
Fall back
to the church. Now!

1418
01:19:11,201 --> 01:19:13,726
Where's the fucking door?

1419
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:18,807
[Beep]

1420
01:19:27,651 --> 01:19:30,051
They're getting a little
nervous back there.

1421
01:19:30,154 --> 01:19:31,553
In fact, so am I.

1422
01:19:31,655 --> 01:19:33,054
We're right over
Washington.

1423
01:19:33,157 --> 01:19:34,351
See if you
can get any TV.

1424
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:35,425
That will
settle them down.

1425
01:19:35,526 --> 01:19:38,393
Works for me.
I'll--

1426
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,395
[Beeping]

1427
01:20:01,585 --> 01:20:02,984
Writing
your acceptance speech

1428
01:20:03,086 --> 01:20:04,986
for the Video Sleaze
Awards?

1429
01:20:05,088 --> 01:20:06,578
Try Pulitzer.

1430
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:08,021
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1431
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:10,616
<i>while waiting to land,</i>
<i>our cabin attendants</i>

1432
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:11,921
<i>are turning on</i>
<i>local Washington broadcasting.</i>

1433
01:20:12,029 --> 01:20:13,963
<i>The sound is on channel three.</i>

1434
01:20:20,637 --> 01:20:21,535
O.K.

1435
01:20:21,638 --> 01:20:23,265
O.K., O.K.

1436
01:20:31,648 --> 01:20:34,048
Please, sir, we may
land at any moment.

1437
01:20:34,151 --> 01:20:35,550
If you'll
take your seat--

1438
01:20:35,652 --> 01:20:37,051
I'm going to be sick.

1439
01:20:37,154 --> 01:20:38,451
Excuse me.
I'm going to be sick.

1440
01:20:38,555 --> 01:20:40,648
Sir, the seat belt
light is on.

1441
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:45,960
Moron.

1442
01:20:46,063 --> 01:20:46,961
WZDC.

1443
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:47,996
Yes, this is
Richard Thornberg.

1444
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:49,224
Put me through to Ruben
in the newsroom.

1445
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,561
Uh, he's
about to go live.

1446
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:52,066
I know he's
about to go on.

1447
01:20:52,169 --> 01:20:53,568
That's why I need him.

1448
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:55,069
You'll have to hold on--

1449
01:20:55,172 --> 01:20:56,571
Put me through, Celia,

1450
01:20:56,673 --> 01:20:58,300
or start typing
your resume.

1451
01:20:58,408 --> 01:20:58,508
Esperanza's down--

1452
01:20:58,508 --> 01:21:00,976
Esperanza's down--

1453
01:21:01,078 --> 01:21:03,069
But he's hurt.

1454
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:05,080
He took a round
in his shoulder.

1455
01:21:05,182 --> 01:21:07,082
Plus I got
one more of their guys.

1456
01:21:07,184 --> 01:21:08,879
That's six
they lost altogether.

1457
01:21:08,986 --> 01:21:10,578
Maybe if we knew how many
they had to start with,

1458
01:21:10,687 --> 01:21:11,915
we could get excited,

1459
01:21:12,022 --> 01:21:13,148
but if they got 50 guys,

1460
01:21:13,257 --> 01:21:15,725
it's a little early
to break out the champagne!

1461
01:21:15,826 --> 01:21:17,259
Now, we appreciate
your effort, McClane,

1462
01:21:17,361 --> 01:21:19,761
but we don't need
a loose cannon on this deck!

1463
01:21:19,863 --> 01:21:21,023
What if they decide
to crash another plane

1464
01:21:21,131 --> 01:21:23,031
in retaliation
for your little stunt?

1465
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:25,033
They can't do that
anymore, right, Barnes?

1466
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:27,035
Besides, if I
grabbed Esperanza,

1467
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,399
this would
all be over by now.

1468
01:21:28,505 --> 01:21:30,029
Well, maybe they're just
a little bit more creative

1469
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,129
than you think!

1470
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:33,505
Well, at least
I'm thinking, goddamn it!

1471
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:35,043
Listen, you wise-ass,

1472
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:36,203
we're here to jerk off
that cocksucker

1473
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:37,337
until he tries
to take off.

1474
01:21:37,447 --> 01:21:38,345
Period!

1475
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:40,040
Now, you're the wrong guy

1476
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,549
in the wrong place
at the wrong time!

1477
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:45,451
The story of my life.

1478
01:21:46,623 --> 01:21:47,590
Major,

1479
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:49,090
Pentagon situation room,
sir!

1480
01:21:49,192 --> 01:21:50,090
Pentagon.

1481
01:21:50,193 --> 01:21:52,093
I'll take it
in here.

1482
01:21:52,195 --> 01:21:53,253
Thank you, Telford.

1483
01:21:53,363 --> 01:21:56,093
You men
come with me.

1484
01:21:57,668 --> 01:21:58,566
McClane.

1485
01:21:58,669 --> 01:21:59,567
Yeah, Barnes.

1486
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,069
You said those guys

1487
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,536
showed up out there
right away?

1488
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:03,731
Yeah.

1489
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,603
That means they're
on the field or close,

1490
01:22:05,709 --> 01:22:08,109
and I think
I know where.

1491
01:22:08,211 --> 01:22:10,145
Come here. Let me
show you something.

1492
01:22:11,715 --> 01:22:13,114
These are the old plans

1493
01:22:13,216 --> 01:22:15,116
when the longer
runways went in.

1494
01:22:15,218 --> 01:22:16,583
That's 1 2 years ago.

1495
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:19,121
Looks like they've done
some modifications on site--

1496
01:22:19,222 --> 01:22:21,122
moved Tra Con phones, I LS,

1497
01:22:21,224 --> 01:22:22,623
all the underground stuff

1498
01:22:22,726 --> 01:22:24,626
so they could
handle drainage.

1499
01:22:24,728 --> 01:22:26,127
If I'm right,

1500
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:28,629
all of it would run
right along the airport property

1501
01:22:28,732 --> 01:22:31,826
and go right past
this neighborhood.

1502
01:22:34,638 --> 01:22:36,629
We should have been
on the ground two hours ago!

1503
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:39,641
I understand,
but if you just relax...

1504
01:22:39,743 --> 01:22:41,643
It's hopeless.

1505
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:43,645
Somebody ought to get
their ass kicked for this mess,

1506
01:22:43,747 --> 01:22:45,942
that's for sure.

1507
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:47,277
Well, unfortunately,

1508
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:49,648
there really isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

1509
01:22:49,753 --> 01:22:52,654
Oh, yeah? What about
that porker Willard Scott?

1510
01:22:52,756 --> 01:22:54,656
I should have
taken the bus.

1511
01:22:54,758 --> 01:22:57,659
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

1512
01:22:57,761 --> 01:22:58,853
Excuse me.

1513
01:22:58,962 --> 01:23:00,827
Yes?

1514
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:02,330
I was just wondering.

1515
01:23:02,432 --> 01:23:03,831
This flight originally

1516
01:23:03,934 --> 01:23:07,165
was supposed to be
5 1 /2 hours, right?

1517
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,168
Mm-hmm.

1518
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:09,431
Do we have
enough fuel

1519
01:23:09,539 --> 01:23:10,665
to keep circling
like this?

1520
01:23:10,774 --> 01:23:12,002
Oh, of course.

1521
01:23:12,109 --> 01:23:15,135
They anticipate
little problems like this.

1522
01:23:32,062 --> 01:23:33,893
Barnes, we looked
at 1 2 fucking houses,

1523
01:23:33,997 --> 01:23:35,328
and we're nowhere.

1524
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:38,230
This is
our last possibility.

1525
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:40,394
Over here there's
an old church.

1526
01:23:40,504 --> 01:23:42,131
Let's go.

1527
01:23:46,243 --> 01:23:47,733
Wait.

1528
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:57,242
There's the church
over there.

1529
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:06,888
Could be a sentry.

1530
01:24:06,997 --> 01:24:08,624
And he could just be
out for a walk.

1531
01:24:08,732 --> 01:24:11,200
Then why is he going over
his own footsteps?

1532
01:24:13,804 --> 01:24:14,828
Come on.

1533
01:24:17,074 --> 01:24:18,200
All right.

1534
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:21,038
Just stay here and get ready
to call the marines.

1535
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:22,771
I thought
they were the army.

1536
01:24:22,879 --> 01:24:25,439
Who gives a fuck?
Just be ready.

1537
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:42,396
[Beeping]

1538
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:43,796
Oh, shit.

1539
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,993
Not now.

1540
01:24:47,737 --> 01:24:49,796
Aah!

1541
01:25:00,217 --> 01:25:01,650
Lorenzo, it's Barnes.

1542
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:03,651
Barnes, where the hell
did you go?

1543
01:25:03,753 --> 01:25:04,651
Where's McClane?

1544
01:25:04,754 --> 01:25:05,686
He's with me.

1545
01:25:05,789 --> 01:25:06,881
We're at the Hidey Lake
Community Church

1546
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:07,922
on the west side
of the airport.

1547
01:25:08,024 --> 01:25:09,651
You're where?
Goddamn it!

1548
01:25:09,759 --> 01:25:11,158
You crazy idiot,
why didn't--

1549
01:25:11,261 --> 01:25:12,660
This must be their
base of operations.

1550
01:25:12,762 --> 01:25:14,161
Shut up and get
your ass over here!

1551
01:25:14,264 --> 01:25:15,162
Move it!

1552
01:25:15,265 --> 01:25:16,664
Code red! Sit rep.

1553
01:25:16,766 --> 01:25:19,098
We got positive I.D.
on Stuart's location.

1554
01:25:19,202 --> 01:25:20,100
Let's move.

1555
01:25:20,203 --> 01:25:22,068
Yo!

1556
01:25:31,214 --> 01:25:33,444
Our escape plane
will be ready

1557
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:36,110
within 30 minutes,
General.

1558
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:38,983
If there are
no more surprises.

1559
01:25:54,137 --> 01:25:56,605
Gentlemen, we have
a situation here.

1560
01:26:44,154 --> 01:26:46,714
Aah!

1561
01:26:56,299 --> 01:26:57,288
Oh!

1562
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:14,740
[Whistle]

1563
01:27:14,851 --> 01:27:16,045
Over here.

1564
01:27:28,198 --> 01:27:30,928
Jeez, McClane, you all right?
You want a medic?

1565
01:27:31,034 --> 01:27:32,865
What the hell you think
you're doing out there,

1566
01:27:32,969 --> 01:27:34,436
playing John Wayne?

1567
01:27:34,537 --> 01:27:36,664
How would you like
to spend the night in a cell?

1568
01:27:36,773 --> 01:27:38,968
Lorenzo, shut the fuck up
and do something useful.

1569
01:27:39,075 --> 01:27:40,269
Go seal off the street.

1570
01:27:40,377 --> 01:27:42,436
Hey, you can't
talk to me like that.

1571
01:27:42,545 --> 01:27:43,842
Oh, no, Carmine?

1572
01:27:43,947 --> 01:27:45,778
Sergeant, get this bureaucrat

1573
01:27:45,882 --> 01:27:47,645
out of Mr. McClane's
face now.

1574
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:49,616
With pleasure, sir.

1575
01:27:51,388 --> 01:27:53,447
Major...

1576
01:27:53,556 --> 01:27:54,784
the men are
in position, sir.

1577
01:27:54,891 --> 01:27:56,791
Close up the back.
Then we go in.

Roger that, sir.

1580
01:27:59,896 --> 01:28:01,761
Guess I was
wrong about you.

1581
01:28:01,865 --> 01:28:04,333
You're not such
an asshole after all.

1582
01:28:04,434 --> 01:28:05,833
No, you were right.

1583
01:28:05,935 --> 01:28:07,903

of asshole.

1588
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:24,450
Another problem,
Colonel?

1589
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:26,545
No problem, General.

1590
01:28:26,656 --> 01:28:29,648
Gentlemen,
you know what to do.

1591
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:41,301
Down!

1592
01:28:41,404 --> 01:28:42,735

They're pulling out
out the back!

1600
01:29:48,004 --> 01:29:49,596
Move it!

1601
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,641
Albertson, take your men
around the back.

1602
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:11,327
Aah!

1603
01:30:15,832 --> 01:30:18,426
Aah!

1604
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:30,773
This equipment,
it could land our planes.

1605
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,576
There were trip wires outside.
They could have booby-trapped--

1606
01:30:33,683 --> 01:30:34,581
They did.

1607
01:30:34,684 --> 01:30:35,651
Got one here, too.

1608
01:30:35,752 --> 01:30:37,310
Looks like C-4.
The motherfucker is armed.

1609
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:40,719
Clear the area!
Everybody, now!

1610
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,259

all the equipment.

1611

1618
01:32:34,404 --> 01:32:37,703
So much
for the element of chance.

1619

It is.
It's in hangar 1 1 .

1627
01:33:24,887 --> 01:33:27,082
It's the most
remote building we've got.

1628

Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

1632
01:33:36,866 --> 01:33:39,596
Colonel, you're quite capable of
confirming it yourself.

1633
01:33:39,702 --> 01:33:41,602
Now, please, don't ask us

1634
01:33:41,704 --> 01:33:43,797
to gift-wrap potential

1635
01:33:43,906 --> 01:33:45,305
Major Grant,
isn't it?

1636
01:33:45,408 --> 01:33:47,035
If you remember me,
Colonel,

1637
01:33:47,143 --> 01:33:50,670
then you remember I know
the drill as well as you do.

1638

Check out
your own fucking plane.

1639
01:33:52,915 --> 01:33:55,315
We move out
in five minutes.

1640
01:33:55,418 --> 01:33:56,817
Flak jackets
for everybody.

1641
01:33:56,919 --> 01:33:59,319
Body armor for
the assault team.

1642

Night scopes
for the snipers.

1643
01:34:00,923 --> 01:34:02,823
We will take them
in the hangar,

01:34:02,925 --> 01:34:04,825
and I will
pull that detonator

1645
01:34:04,927 --> 01:34:07,828
out of Stuart's
dead fucking hand myself.

1646
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:11,297
Take all your men
back to the airport.

1647
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:12,800
Seal off every exit

1648
01:34:12,902 --> 01:34:14,335
in case they try
to slip past us

1649
01:34:14,437 --> 01:34:16,337
to break out
onto the ground.

1650
01:34:16,439 --> 01:34:17,804
You got it.

1651
01:34:19,842 --> 01:34:21,639
All right,
here we go.

1652
01:34:21,744 --> 01:34:22,938
Dick, this is nuts.

1653
01:34:23,046 --> 01:34:24,274
Every station in town
has people out at the airport,

1654
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,779
and none of them has
heard even a whisper

you're running now!

1656
01:34:27,383 --> 01:34:29,214
Well,
none of them is me.

01:38:37,366 --> 01:38:38,765
have arrived at the airport,

1752
01:38:38,868 --> 01:38:40,768
the likelihood
of a full-scale, deadly battle

1753
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:43,395
is dangerously close.

1754
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:06,787
That stupid, arrogant
son of a bitch.

1755
01:39:06,896 --> 01:39:09,694
It's all over the airport.

1756
01:39:09,799 --> 01:39:11,699
<i>300 people have died...</i>

1757
01:39:11,801 --> 01:39:14,201
When are we
going to land?

1758
01:39:14,303 --> 01:39:16,794
<i>...and unfortunately</i>
<i>they may not be the last.</i>

1759
01:39:16,906 --> 01:39:19,466
<i>The horrifying fact</i>
<i>is that no one is safe,</i>

1760
01:39:19,575 --> 01:39:21,736
<i>either in the planes</i>
<i>above Dulles</i>

1761
01:39:21,844 --> 01:39:24,244
<i>or in the terminal below.</i>

1762
01:39:24,347 --> 01:39:27,748
<i>The threat of a new and higher</i>
<i>body count at the airport</i>

1763
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:29,750
<i>hangs over the heads</i>
<i>of everyone,</i>

1764
01:39:29,852 --> 01:39:31,752
<i>and the holiday season</i>
<i>of peace and love</i>

1765
01:39:31,854 --> 01:39:34,220
<i>has become a nightmare.</i>

1766
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:41,628
All right, listen up!

1767
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:44,757
All units, I want you
to converge on hangar 1 1 ,

1768
01:39:44,867 --> 01:39:46,266
all sides!

1769
01:39:46,369 --> 01:39:48,269
This car, McClane!
Get in!

1770
01:39:48,371 --> 01:39:51,135
When the City Blue
show up with their backup,

1771
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,764
they'll pick up
the pieces!

1772
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:54,706
Now, move out!

1773
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:58,746
McClane, say hi
to my brother Vito.

1774
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,406
Merry Christmas.

1775
01:40:00,516 --> 01:40:02,040
Hi.

1776
01:40:08,557 --> 01:40:09,785
Goddamn it
to hell!

1777
01:40:09,892 --> 01:40:12,520
Move that
piece of shit!

1778
01:40:12,628 --> 01:40:15,654
Will you move
that goddamn piece of shit

1779
01:40:15,765 --> 01:40:16,789
out of here?

1780
01:40:16,899 --> 01:40:18,230
Vito, get the fuck
out of the car

1781
01:40:18,334 --> 01:40:21,235
and get your ass
in gear and help me.

1782
01:40:21,337 --> 01:40:22,634
Will you get--

1783
01:40:22,738 --> 01:40:25,172
Move that car
right now!

1784
01:40:25,274 --> 01:40:26,400
Right there.
Right there. Get that.

1785
01:40:26,509 --> 01:40:28,500
Hey, Coleman!

1786
01:40:28,611 --> 01:40:32,672
Sam! Sam Coleman!

1787
01:40:32,782 --> 01:40:35,012
Hey, Coleman!

1788
01:40:35,117 --> 01:40:36,414
Hi!

1789
01:40:36,519 --> 01:40:38,953
Coleman!

1790
01:40:39,055 --> 01:40:42,752
But at least the truth
is not among the hostages

1791
01:40:42,858 --> 01:40:46,259
because I, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here

1792
01:40:46,362 --> 01:40:50,560
to put his life
and talent

1793
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:53,533
on the line for humanity
and country,

1794
01:40:53,636 --> 01:40:56,605
and if this should be
my final broadcast--

1795
01:40:58,874 --> 01:41:01,843
Amen to that...Dick.

1796
01:41:01,944 --> 01:41:04,777
<i>Dick? We're live, Dick.</i>

1797
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,939
<i>Where are you now?</i>

1798
01:41:07,049 --> 01:41:09,415
<i>Dick?</i>

1799
01:41:09,518 --> 01:41:11,349
Truck lights
approaching, sir.

1800
01:41:11,454 --> 01:41:14,787
<i>They're here,</i>
<i>right on schedule.</i>

1801
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:17,290
The hangar door,
open it.

1802
01:41:17,393 --> 01:41:18,724
Clockwork.

1803
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:42,251
Jeez, you
give me this story,

1804
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:43,240
Jeez, you
give me this story,

1805
01:41:43,352 --> 01:41:45,752
and I'll
have your baby.

1806
01:41:45,855 --> 01:41:48,688
Not the kind of ride
I'm looking for.

1807
01:42:00,369 --> 01:42:03,770
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

1808
01:42:03,873 --> 01:42:05,272
Thank you, Major.

1809
01:42:05,374 --> 01:42:07,274
You're not
so bad yourself.

1810
01:42:07,376 --> 01:42:09,105
Congratulations
on your escape, sir.

1811
01:42:09,211 --> 01:42:10,269
Thank you, Major.

1812
01:42:10,379 --> 01:42:11,539
Maybe you
should save them

1813
01:42:11,647 --> 01:42:12,705
until we
are all safe, hmm?

1814
01:42:12,815 --> 01:42:14,383
Sir.

1815
01:42:14,383 --> 01:42:16,283
My congratulations,
gentlemen.

1816
01:42:16,385 --> 01:42:17,784
You've won a victory
for our way of life,

1817
01:42:17,887 --> 01:42:22,153
my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.

1818
01:42:22,258 --> 01:42:23,885
Now, get on board.

1819
01:42:52,955 --> 01:42:54,855
What's the matter,
cowboy, ride too rough?

1820
01:42:54,957 --> 01:42:56,356
I don't
like to fly.

1821
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:57,857
Then what
are you doing here?

1822
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,655
I don't like
to lose, either.

1823
01:42:59,762 --> 01:43:02,196
O.K. Whoo! Here we go!

1824
01:43:10,139 --> 01:43:12,073
I don't know
about you guys,

1825
01:43:12,174 --> 01:43:14,039
but I've seen
enough fucking snow

1826
01:43:14,143 --> 01:43:15,235
to last me
a lifetime.

1827
01:43:15,344 --> 01:43:17,369
You don't get much of that
in the tropics, Major.

1828
01:43:17,479 --> 01:43:20,175
For you, gentlemen,
we'll import it.

1829
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:24,686
Shit!
They left the hangar!

1830
01:43:27,656 --> 01:43:29,089
Right there.

1831
01:43:29,191 --> 01:43:31,022
Right there.
Get that.

1832
01:43:31,126 --> 01:43:32,024
All right, now what?

1833
01:43:32,127 --> 01:43:33,321
Get in front of them!
Take it down!

1834
01:43:33,429 --> 01:43:35,522
Block their path
so they can't get out of there!

1835
01:43:35,631 --> 01:43:37,121
I'm not playing chicken
with a 200-ton plane!

1836
01:43:37,233 --> 01:43:38,495
I'm crazy, man,
but I ain't that crazy.

1837
01:43:38,601 --> 01:43:39,659
Forget it.

1838
01:43:39,768 --> 01:43:41,326
<i>Dulles,</i>
<i>this is Northeast 1 40.</i>

1839
01:43:41,437 --> 01:43:42,665
<i>Request clearance</i>
<i>on first available runway.</i>

1840
01:43:42,771 --> 01:43:43,863
That's Holly's plane.

1841
01:43:43,973 --> 01:43:46,373
<i>Repeat. Request</i>
<i>emergency clearance.</i>

1842
01:43:46,475 --> 01:43:47,499
<i>I know you're</i>
<i>not going to answer me,</i>

1843
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:48,736
<i>but you damn well</i>
<i>better listen!</i>

1844
01:43:48,844 --> 01:43:50,835
We're down to fumes,
and we have to land,

1845
01:43:50,946 --> 01:43:52,174
and in five minutes
we're coming in

1846
01:43:52,281 --> 01:43:53,680
<i>one way or another.</i>

1847
01:43:53,782 --> 01:43:55,010
That's my wife's
plane!

1848
01:43:55,117 --> 01:43:56,414
Take it
fucking down!

1849
01:43:56,518 --> 01:43:57,951
I'm not getting
in front of that plane!

1850
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:05,449
All right, how about
getting over top of it?

1851
01:44:05,561 --> 01:44:07,085
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is the captain.</i>

1852
01:44:07,196 --> 01:44:08,163
Your attention.

1853
01:44:08,264 --> 01:44:09,356
We have no choice

1854
01:44:09,465 --> 01:44:11,695
but to attempt
an emergency landing.

1855
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,200
<i>Please fasten your seat belts</i>
<i>and assume crash positions</i>

1856
01:44:14,303 --> 01:44:16,703
as instructed
by your cabin attendants.

1857
01:44:16,805 --> 01:44:19,205
Let's have
the emergency check list.

1858
01:44:19,308 --> 01:44:21,742
Attention all air traffic
in Dulles area.

1859
01:44:21,844 --> 01:44:23,243
This is Northeast 1 40.

1860
01:44:23,345 --> 01:44:24,869
We're going to attempt
an emergency landing.

1861
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,106
Be advised.

1862
01:44:28,984 --> 01:44:30,383
I don't want to die.

1863
01:44:30,486 --> 01:44:32,317
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1864
01:44:32,421 --> 01:44:33,820
Just buckle
your seat belt.

1865
01:44:33,922 --> 01:44:35,822
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1866
01:44:35,924 --> 01:44:37,050
Lean forward.

1867
01:44:38,427 --> 01:44:40,554
God!

1868
01:44:40,663 --> 01:44:42,631
Oh!

1869
01:44:45,501 --> 01:44:47,435
Oh, God.

1870
01:44:47,536 --> 01:44:48,833
O God,

1871
01:44:48,937 --> 01:44:52,737
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me.

1872
01:44:58,914 --> 01:45:00,506
Just hang on!

1873
01:45:00,616 --> 01:45:02,481
What are you doing?

1874
01:45:02,584 --> 01:45:03,551
You wanted a story,
didn't you?

1875
01:45:03,652 --> 01:45:04,641
Nice and easy, boys.

1876
01:45:04,753 --> 01:45:05,845
Get me in low!

1877
01:45:05,954 --> 01:45:07,478
You got it!

1878
01:45:09,391 --> 01:45:11,359
Bring me down!

1879
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,859
You'll get
yourself killed!

1880
01:45:12,961 --> 01:45:15,429
Come back inside!

1881
01:45:21,804 --> 01:45:23,863
Bring it in low!
Keep over the wing!

1882
01:45:31,413 --> 01:45:33,847
Lower!

1883
01:45:33,949 --> 01:45:34,847
Aah!

1884
01:45:43,459 --> 01:45:46,053
John, what the fuck
are you doing

1885
01:45:46,161 --> 01:45:49,130
out on the wing
of this plane?

1886
01:45:54,103 --> 01:45:55,365
Damn!

1887
01:46:01,143 --> 01:46:02,735
<i>Mierda.</i>

1888
01:46:02,845 --> 01:46:04,210
There's
something wrong.

1889
01:46:04,313 --> 01:46:07,009
The ailerons.

1890
01:46:07,116 --> 01:46:09,175
We can't
take off.

1891
01:46:12,154 --> 01:46:13,086
<i>Hijo de puta.</i>

1892
01:46:13,188 --> 01:46:14,951
It's McClane again.

1893
01:46:16,692 --> 01:46:17,920
Son of a bitch!

1894
01:46:19,027 --> 01:46:21,860
I'll do him.

1895
01:46:21,964 --> 01:46:23,226
This time
do it right.

1896
01:46:23,332 --> 01:46:25,232
You just get us
in the air, General.

1897
01:46:25,334 --> 01:46:26,892
You're the only man
who can do it.

1898
01:46:27,002 --> 01:46:28,799
Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fueled.

1899
01:46:54,897 --> 01:46:55,795
Ya!

1900
01:47:21,423 --> 01:47:24,119
Too bad, McClane.
I kind of liked you!

1901
01:47:28,197 --> 01:47:29,164
Whoa!

1902
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:34,232
I got enough friends!

1903
01:47:37,005 --> 01:47:38,529
Aah!

1904
01:48:11,139 --> 01:48:12,868
O.K., McClane...

1905
01:48:12,975 --> 01:48:14,465
time for
the main event!

1906
01:48:19,481 --> 01:48:21,210
Aah!

1907
01:48:23,585 --> 01:48:24,483
Aah!

1908
01:48:24,586 --> 01:48:25,610
[Spits]

1909
01:48:50,345 --> 01:48:52,210
Motherfucker!

1910
01:49:00,022 --> 01:49:01,319
Oh!

1911
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:03,985
Ha ha ha!

1912
01:49:04,092 --> 01:49:05,059
How's it going?

1913
01:49:08,931 --> 01:49:10,489
Bon voyage!

1914
01:49:16,939 --> 01:49:19,965
Happy landings, asshole!

1915
01:50:10,392 --> 01:50:12,792
Yippie-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

1916
01:50:25,674 --> 01:50:27,335
Yeah. All right.

1917
01:50:41,823 --> 01:50:43,051
Aah!

1918
01:50:46,695 --> 01:50:49,289
Whoa!

1919
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:57,805
Ha ha ha!

1920
01:50:57,906 --> 01:51:00,773
Oh!

1921
01:51:04,413 --> 01:51:07,314
Holly!

1922
01:51:07,416 --> 01:51:09,816
Here's your fucking
landing light!

1923
01:51:09,918 --> 01:51:11,476
Whoo!

1924
01:51:17,659 --> 01:51:19,320
Oh, God.

1925
01:51:19,428 --> 01:51:21,453
[Praying]

1926
01:51:21,563 --> 01:51:23,030
Look!

1927
01:51:23,131 --> 01:51:24,029
Look!

1928
01:51:24,132 --> 01:51:27,329
O.K., I see it!
I see it!

1929
01:51:51,293 --> 01:51:52,783
They used
the fire to see!

1930
01:51:52,894 --> 01:51:54,225
They used
the fucking fire to see!

1931
01:51:54,329 --> 01:51:55,557
They can all do that.
Tell them.

1932
01:51:55,664 --> 01:51:57,063
They already know.

1933
01:51:57,165 --> 01:51:58,792
<i>We had a visual</i>

Listen.

Whoo!

1938
01:52:22,424 --> 01:52:23,823
If any landing
you can walk away from

1939
01:52:23,925 --> 01:52:25,256
is a good one,
that's great.

1940
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,884
Whew!

1941
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:50,850

Oh! Oh!

Oh, God.
Oh, baby.

1961
01:54:30,018 --> 01:54:32,316
I thought I was never going
to see you again.

1962
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:34,752
That's what
I thought about you.

1963
01:54:34,856 --> 01:54:37,518
I love you so much.

1964
01:54:40,195 --> 01:54:43,096
They told me there were
terrorists at the airport.

1965
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:46,429
Yeah. I heard that, too.

1966
01:54:54,209 --> 01:54:55,836
God, that's beautiful.

1967
01:54:55,944 --> 01:54:57,844
Yeah.

1968
01:54:58,947 --> 01:55:02,747
Yup, it sure is.

Oh, I love you so much.

Oh,John.

1971
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:12,519
Why does this
keep happening to us?

1972
01:55:17,966 --> 01:55:20,628
Let's go home.

1973
01:55:20,735 --> 01:55:22,930
Get in the truck!

1974
01:55:23,038 --> 01:55:24,869
Let's get her
out of here!

1975

Somebody help me,

Oh, honey, help me

What do you say, Marv?

1982
01:55:43,391 --> 01:55:47,157
I'll be damned if I'm going
to clean up this mess!

1983
