<i>History prefers legends to men.</i>

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,200
<i>It prefers nobility to brutality.</i>

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,200
<i>Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.</i>

5
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,040
<i>History remembers the battle</i>

<i>Whatever history remembers of me,</i>

7
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,600

8
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,760
<i>For whatever else I am,</i>

9
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,400
<i>a president...</i>

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,560
<i>I shall always think of myself</i>

11
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,560
<i>I leave in your trusted hands,</i>
<i>my dear friend Henry...</i>

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,240
<i>this record that begins</i>
<i>when I was just a boy.</i>

13
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,400
Get on down there. Hurry it up!

14
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,440
Please, sir, no.
There's been some kind of mistake.

15
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,080
I ain't no slave.

16
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,760
Let them go! Aaron!

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Go back inside!

18
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,480
Let them go!

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,640
Will!

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,320
-Quiet!
-He's my friend!

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
Look away, Abraham.

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,800
It's not our place.

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,440
Look away.

24
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
Abraham!

25
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,160
Thomas, help them!

26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
Leave him alone!

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,120
Are you all right?

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,640
Did you strike my friend here?

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,920
He was beating my son!

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,520
Did you strike him, Lincoln?

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
They're not slaves, and you know it.

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
I suggest you get back to your work

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,880
before you find yourself
led away in chains.

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,080
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,320
Very well, then.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,920
Since you're all
so concerned with freedom...

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,160
you may consider yourself free
from the burden of my employ.

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,480
And the debt you've been working off...

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
I'd like it paid in full with interest.

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Now, please.

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,480
If you get one more penny
from me, Mr. Barts...

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,000
it will come with a fist
wrapped around it.

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
All right, Mr. Lincoln.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
There are other ways to collect a debt.

45
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,920
No!

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
<i>What's happening to her, Father?</i>

47
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,760
Please help her!
Please, I beg of you.

48
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,600
You've got to do something, Father.

49
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Easy, child.

50
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
Look away, Abraham.

51
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,800
I've never seen anything like this.

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,400
Strange.

53
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,240
You promise me.

54
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Let's step outside.

55
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm sorry, I don't know what ails her.

56
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,400
Abraham.

57
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,320
Come and lie next to me.

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
I've been writing, Mama.

59
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,320
"Days are swift as an Indian arrow...

60
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,000
"flying like a shooting star.

61
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,840
"The present day is here...

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,520
"and then slides away in haste...

63
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,040
"that we can never say is ours...

64
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,000
"but only say...

65
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
"is passed."

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,440
Mother?

67
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Mother?

68
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,880
<i>Mama once told me that</i>
<i>I hadn't cried when I was born.</i>

69
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,040
<i>That I'd simply opened my eyes...</i>

70
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,880
<i>looked at her smiling face...</i>
<i>and smiled back.</i>

71
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,480
<i>My light was gone.</i>

72
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,440
-I don't know how he did it--
-Abraham...

73
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,040
you promise me...

74
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,520
You promise me you won't go
and do anything foolish.

75
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,240
<i>Nine years later,</i>
<i>my father joined her in death.</i>

76
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,960
<i>No longer bound by my promise...</i>

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,080
<i>I tried to fortify the nerve</i>
<i>to pursue my vengeance.</i>

78
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,560
Haven't you had enough?

79
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,920
A boy only gets this drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl...

80
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,480
or kill a man.

81
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,080
Adam, let me explain.

82
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,600
Last one, Barts.

83
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,840
I'm not coming up here to clean up
your messes anymore.

84
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,520
Yes, sir. I promise.

85
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,720
Every so often, I think about what
it would be like to be in the South.

86
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,720
So, where's Henry?

87
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,320
Yes, sir.
We've been looking all over, sir.

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
Searching high and low.

89
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,280
Low is more likely.

90
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,000
Just find him, Barts.

91
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,920
Oh, and send a fresh crop south.

92
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,440
We have a lot of mouths to feed.

93
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,800
Yes, sir.

94
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,000
"Yes, sir, no, sir.
High, sir, low, sir."

95
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
For my mother.

96
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,240
That was unlucky.

97
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Might have put me out of my misery.

98
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Where the hell are you running to?

99
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,640
Don't much like chasing chickens.

100
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,040
Little boy, all grown up.

101
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,480
Come to avenge his dear momma.

102
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,960
There are two kinds of men, Mr. Lincoln.

103
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,320
Those that have the guts
to pull the trigger...

104
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,720
and those who do not.

105
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,160
Powder, patch, ball.

106
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
Don't mess it up.

107
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,200
You weren't asleep that night.

108
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,320
Were you?

109
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,120
You dropped the ball, Mr. Lincoln.

110
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,400
Your mama's blood was sickening sweet.

111
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,480
I hope yours tastes better!

112
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,960
Might I suggest that we begin by...

113
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,800
closing the door?

114
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,640
Yeah, I'm sorry.

115
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,760
I didn't see anything!

116
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,240
Should we dive right in?

117
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Or are you finding Gabrielle's
egress too distracting?

118
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,840
I'm sorry, sir, but who are you?

119
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,240
Who I am is Henry Sturges.

120
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,800
And where you are is my home.

121
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,880
And what happened...

122
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,760
I saved your life...

123
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,880
during your rather pathetic attempt
at taking another's.

124
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,520
What were you doing there, and...

125
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,520
how did you know
I would try to kill Barts?

126
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,200
How?

127
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,800
I watched this boy carry out
his first long-awaited mission.

128
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
Drunk, might I add.

129
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,600
And I think, "You have wasted
your time watching this one, Henry.

130
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,560
"He's not a promising recruit.

131
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,800
"He is just a selfish boy
with his heart set on vengeance."

132
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,280
And I realized,
"This boy is a goddamned idiot!"

133
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,880
"I doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire."

134
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,240
A vampire?

135
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,440
Yes. Immortal, blood-sucking demons.

136
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,480
Fortunately for you, Mr. Lincoln...

137
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,600
hunting them is something of a hobby.

138
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,240
But vampires are just myths.

139
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,360
Myths don't beat you senseless

140
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,200
after you've put
a bullet in their brain.

141
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Thank you.

142
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
No, Mr. Lincoln,
vampires are real.

143
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,160
They exist in every city
and every state...

144
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,160
in the Union.

145
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,720
If what you say is true,
you could help me kill him.

146
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
I could pay you to kill him!

147
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
My services are not for sale.

148
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,280
And the word you are looking for
is "destroy."

149
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,360
It is quite a feat to kill that
which is already dead.

150
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,880
But you don't understand.

151
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,240
My mother was murdered.

152
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,240
And if I teach you how
to murder her murderer...

153
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,840
so what?

154
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,160
How will that honor her memory?

155
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,840
How will that benefit the next boy
whose mother is taken?

156
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,160
If vengeance is all you seek...

157
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,880
seek it elsewhere.

158
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,160
Teach me to fight as you do.
Please, I'll do anything you say.

159
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,160
You promise to cast aside
all notions of vengeance...

160
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,360
and commit to the life of a hunter?

161
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,520
You will have no friends...

162
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,000
no family.

163
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,280
<i>I told him what he wanted to hear...</i>

164
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,000
<i>but all I cared about was</i>
<i>killing the monster that took my mother.</i>

165
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,400
I'm in.

166
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,680
Scottish Highland pistol.

167
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,040
And if one barrel isn't enough...

168
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
seven should do you.

169
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,280
The blunderbuss.

170
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,360
And if you lose your ball...

171
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
you can always stuff your pocket watch
down the end of it.

172
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,960
So, Abe...

173
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,800
which one takes your fancy?

174
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,880
Actually, I haven't had
the best of luck with shooting irons.

175
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,680
But...

176
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,640
I was a rail splitter.

177
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,160
I would like you to chop this tree down
with a single swing.

178
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,720
That tree?

179
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,240
It's got to be more than a foot across.
That's impossible.

180
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,720
But it isn't a tree.

181
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,520
It's what you hate most in the world.

182
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,160
So, tell me, Mr. Lincoln...

183
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,840
what do you hate?

184
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,200
I hate Jack Barts.

185
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,640
Then strike him down.

186
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, clearly you don't
hate him that much.

187
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,440
Tell me what you hate.

188
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,400
I hate that my mother was taken away.

189
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Inadequate.

190
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,640
I hate that we were afraid.

191
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,840
And?

192
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,560
That my mother and father,
everyone that we knew...

193
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,800
lived in fear.

194
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,320
Pathetic.

195
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,280
I hate that I was too small.

196
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,280
-Too weak.
-Yes.

197
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
-And that you failed...
-Yes!

198
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,480
-...to protect her.
-Yes!

199
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,480
And that you let her die.

200
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,120
Power, Lincoln...

201
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,880
real power...

202
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,400
comes not from hate,
but from truth.

203
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,640
Before you protect others
from darkness...

204
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,720
you must first be able
to protect yourself.

205
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,080
Your enemies have the power
to render themselves invisible.

206
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,680
You must have the ability
to fight blind.

207
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,880
To see, without seeing.

208
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,160
Again.

209
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
<i>In the weeks that followed...</i>

210
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,120
<i>Henry endeavored to impart a lifetime</i>
<i>of vampire-hunting secrets.</i>

211
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,280
<i>Their ability to adapt to sunlight.</i>

212
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,200
<i>Their power to render</i>
<i>themselves invisible.</i>

213
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,960
<i>But most of all,</i>
<i>he taught me how to destroy them.</i>

214
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,400
When Judas betrayed Jesus...

215
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,320
his reward was 30 pieces of silver.

216
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,240
At that moment, those pieces
became a symbol of betraying God.

217
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
Of evil.

218
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,680
And silver became a curse...

219
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,560
upon the cursed.

220
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,560
You will never see a vampire
with silver on his person.

221
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Nor see them reflected in mirrors.

222
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,080
The one thing God placed
beyond the reach of a vampire.

223
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,080
The one thing he can never possess.

224
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
Barts...

225
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,000
And the only thing that
renders him powerless.

226
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Henry, Jack Barts!

227
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,080
I give you the targets.
That was our deal.

228
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,240
This is not only
about Jack Barts.

229
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,760
Vadoma, a ruthless enforcer.

230
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,040
And her brother.

231
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,080
I've seen him before.

232
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,040
I saw him with Jack Barts.

233
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,520
They call him Adam.

234
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,400
He, from whom all others are made.

235
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Vampires have been in
the New World for centuries.

236
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,720
Slaughtering native tribes
and early settlers.

237
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,800
But when the Europeans
arrived with their slaves...

238
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,760
the dead saw a sinister opportunity.

239
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,640
They built an empire in the South.

240
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,840
But, in recent years,
they pressed north...

241
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,960
leaving death in their wake.

242
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
It falls to us, Abraham...

243
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,800
the hunters,
to keep the balance.

244
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,440
To ensure that this remains
a nation of men...

245
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,480
and not monsters.

246
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,640
What we do,
we do not for one man...

247
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,360
but for the good of all mankind.

248
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,560
<i>Henry sent me off into</i>
<i>the world with a reminder.</i>

249
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,120
<i>No attachments.</i>
<i>No distractions.</i>

250
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,440
<i>No friends or family.</i>

251
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,680
<i>Besides, who could I trust?</i>

252
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,040
<i>Anyone in this well-mannered city</i>
<i>might very well be one of them.</i>

253
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,720
Son of a bitch!

254
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,680
I ever see you here again,
I will have your balls as a coin purse!

255
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,840
Good afternoon, sir.
Joshua Speed at your service.

256
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,520
Abraham... Lincoln.

257
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,880
I need a bit of help.

258
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,200
All right.

259
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,080
Well, a friend in need,
is a friend of Speed.

260
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,520
What can I get for you?

261
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,360
I don't suppose you know
of any rooms for rent, Mr. Speed?

262
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,680
What sort of room are
you looking for, Mr. Lincoln?

263
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Well, a cheap one...

264
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,280
as I have spent all of my money
on law books

265
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
and have none to spare at the moment.

266
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,920
Now, as you say you have none,
am I to take your meaning as "cheap"...

267
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,080
or "free of charge"?

268
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,400
Well, on credit.

269
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,680
I don't think you'll find
such a room in Springfield.

270
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,480
People here are strangely
accustomed to being compensated.

271
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,880
Good day.

272
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,480
There is one room, Mr. Lincoln.

273
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,360
I was recently forced to part ways
with a thieving prick of an associate...

274
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,880
and am, therefore,
in need of a replacement.

275
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,360
There's a room upstairs.

276
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,880
It isn't much, but I suppose
it could be had on credit...

277
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,200
if the tenant were willing
to work here in return.

278
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,960
<i>Dear Henry...</i>

279
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,240
<i>life in Springfield is</i>
<i>less than desirous.</i>

280
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
<i>Fear not.</i>

281
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,080
<i>My pittance of a salary doesn't allow me</i>
<i>to deviate from your rules...</i>

282
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,280
<i>No friends, no family.</i>

283
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,280
<i>And certainly, no woman would find me,</i>
<i>and my existence, enticing.</i>

284
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,920
Excuse me.

285
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,600
Excuse me,
I'll be needing these.

286
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,120
Just one second, ma'am.

287
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,520
Well, you needn't call me ma'am,
as if I'm some haggard spinster...

288
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,080
I'm sorry, ma'am.

289
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,520
Madam... I mean, miss.

290
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
I'm Abraham... Lincoln.

291
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,720
Mary Todd.

292
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,280
Darling.

293
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,160
There you are.

294
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,360
You mustn't flit from
store to store so quickly.

295
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,320
Well, perhaps if you didn't stop to jaw
with every gentleman in Springfield...

296
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
I could say the same for you.

297
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,120
Stephen Douglas.
How do you do?

298
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Abraham... Lincoln.

299
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,920
Are you a voting man, Mr. Lincoln?

300
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,320
I...

301
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,760
How do you feel about
keeping slavery out of Illinois?

302
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,120
I'm running for the legislature.

303
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,120
I'm sure he'd love to hear
your campaign speech...

304
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,000
but Mr. Lincoln was just about
to attend to my list.

305
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
We were talking, dear.

306
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,760
Slavery, it's a complicated issue.

307
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,640
I couldn't disagree with you more,
Mr. Douglas.

308
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,840
Mr. Douglas, Miss Todd.

309
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,760
You have met my new associate, Abraham.

310
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,200
A letter came for you.

311
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,920
<i>Dear Abe.</i>

312
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,880
<i>Your prescription awaits you</i>
<i>at the local pharmacy.</i>

313
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,520
<i>Ask for Aaron Stibel, Junior.</i>

314
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,360
Mr. Lincoln?

315
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,720
I'm so sorry.

316
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,200
Good day of work, Abraham.

317
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,560
Thank you.

318
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,200
<i>But don't forget...</i>

319
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,200
<i>always have a contingency plan.</i>

320
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Aaron Stibel Junior?

321
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Yes?

322
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,440
That's it. Oh, that's tight.

323
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,760
Don't worry.
It will only hurt for a second or two.

324
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,520
Did you eat today?

325
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,640
<i>I had killed a monster.</i>

326
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,640
<i>And I would kill again.</i>

327
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,920
<i>But no amount of death</i>
<i>could make me forget.</i>

328
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,240
Merciful Christ, Lincoln,
what happened to your face?

329
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,600
Don't worry, I'll still be able to work.

330
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Work?

331
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,240
To hell with work.

332
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,560
We got invited to a ball.

333
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,600
It could be your chance to save
Mary Todd from a life of boredom.

334
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,440
<i>This suit makes me look ridiculous.</i>

335
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,640
Nonsense.

336
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,680
But that hat makes you look ridiculous.
Come on.

337
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,680
Come on, come on.
Look, there she is.

338
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,240
Mr. Douglas, Joshua Speed.

339
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,240
Pleasure to see you.
Mary, you look lovely.

340
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
He's still missing.

341
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Who's that?

342
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,760
Aaron Stibel.

343
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,920
Junior or Senior?

344
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,760
Junior.

345
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,320
-Who is that man?
-I don't know.

346
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,560
Mr. Douglas, you know Senator Nolan,
of course.

347
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,760
Yes, Stephen. Good to see you.

348
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,920
Have you heard this news?

349
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,280
Yes, we're looking into it.

350
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
Rest assured,
this kind of lawlessness...

351
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,040
won't stand
in the noble state of Illinois.

352
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,640
It's called a dance.

353
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,560
If we were meant to sit alone,
they would've called it something else.

354
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,000
Yes, I suppose they would have.

355
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,160
Come, Mr. Lincoln.

356
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,720
You'll ruin the upholstery
if you sit there any longer.

357
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,520
I'm sure you're a very nice man,
Mr. Lincoln...

358
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,720
but you're a...

359
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,560
A shopkeeper, in a borrowed suit.

360
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,920
No, it's not a matter of means.
Really, no.

361
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,080
I came to Springfield
looking for someone different.

362
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,280
Someone whose life
was a bit more adventurous, and well...

363
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,280
My apologies, I'm never this--

364
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Honest?

365
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,520
Rude.

366
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,360
Miss Todd, may I speak candidly?

367
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,840
I, too, came here to better myself.

368
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,000
That's why I've taken an interest
in the law...

369
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,840
and why, if I may be so bold,
I have taken an interest in you.

370
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,080
And as for the adventure
that you seek...

371
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,200
I suspect that few men
could ever hope to provide that for you.

372
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,280
Least of all your fiancГ©,
Stephen Douglas.

373
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,360
Mr. Lincoln, you are full of surprises.

374
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,320
Miss Todd, you have no idea.

375
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,400
<i>Dear Abraham.</i>

376
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,200
<i>I've made a deposit at the local bank.</i>

377
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,040
<i>Be careful, it can quickly disappear.</i>

378
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,280
<i>Henry, there are more</i>
<i>than I ever thought possible.</i>

379
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,720
<i>Pharmacists, innkeepers, pastors.</i>

380
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,240
<i>It's more than a man can bear.</i>

381
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,320
Well, I see I'm
such interesting company.

382
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
I'm sorry.

383
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,440
I've been working nights.

384
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,920
Really? Is that true?

385
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,800
Do you really want
to know the truth, Mary?

386
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,400
Each and every night...

387
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,200
I go out...

388
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
hunting vampires.

389
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,280
Well, how do you hunt these vampires?

390
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,800
With an axe.

391
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,120
A special silver axe, of course.

392
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,400
Of course.

393
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,720
And how many would
you reckon you've killed?

394
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,880
Five. No... six.

395
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,400
I have killed six vampires.

396
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
My goodness!

397
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,560
Abe!

398
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,320
Here I thought you were an honest man.
Really!

399
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,320
Well, I had a wonderful day, Abe.

400
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
As did I, Mary.

401
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,360
Miss Todd, you are a woman
of ravishing resourcefulness.

402
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,800
Mr. Lincoln, you have no idea.

403
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,160
<i>You will have no friends, no family.</i>

404
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,320
I... should be going. It's late.

405
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,880
<i>How could I bring her into this world?</i>

406
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,880
<i>A world of demons, of danger.</i>

407
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,520
Good night, then, Lincoln.

408
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,680
Good night, Mary.

409
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,040
Happy hunting.

410
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,440
<i>If I truly cared for her...</i>

411
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,360
<i>the kindest thing I could do...</i>

412
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,080
<i>was walk away.</i>

413
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,280
This hunter
is another of Henry's disciples?

414
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,800
They say he's a madman.

415
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,800
I can't wait to meet him.

416
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,000
A stock boy, reading a law book.

417
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,280
What?
You studying to be a lawyer?

418
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,760
As a matter of fact, I am.

419
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,000
All right, what about a little test?

420
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,960
What's the law for free slaves
in the North?

421
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,560
According to the
Fugitive Slave Act of 1793...

422
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,520
enforcing Article four, section two,
of the United States Constitution...

423
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,680
"All runaway slaves must
be returned to their owners."

424
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,360
However,
personal liberty laws state that...

425
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,040
"Anyone who is born free...

426
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,960
"cannot be taken under this act."

427
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,840
I heard a good woman once say...

428
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,960
"Until all men are free...

429
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,680
"we're all slaves."

430
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,960
Will?

431
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,600
Will Johnson!

432
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,960
How did you...?

433
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,600
I was back home...

434
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,160
and heard you moved here.

435
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,080
Studying to be a lawyer.

436
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,960
That's good.
I'm in need of a good lawyer.

437
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,840
What, are you in some kind of trouble?

438
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,440
I was freeing slaves down South
on the railroad...

439
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,680
hoping to find my brother down there.

440
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,680
Some bounty hunters got after me.

441
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,880
Said I was a runaway.

442
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,960
I need a writ, Abe...

443
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,520
saying I was born free.

444
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,640
You know, Will...

445
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,120
Come on.

446
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,680
Hey.

447
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,920
Speed, this is Will Johnson.

448
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,960
Will Johnson,
my oldest friend in the world.

449
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,640
The store isn't
going to run itself, Abe.

450
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,720
I'll have him back
as soon as possible, Mr. Speed.

451
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,040
I promise.

452
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,720
You're getting tall, Abe.

453
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,960
Look like you still
don't eat much, either.

454
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,880
You still afraid of the dark, too?

455
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,760
Not so much anymore.

456
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,800
That's him, Abe.

457
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,240
That's the guy that's been chasing me.

458
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,720
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen...

459
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,440
I'm sure we can work this out.

460
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,000
Now I suggest you walk away, son.

461
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,240
No, sir, I suggest you do.

462
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,880
I've sent word to Senator Nolan.

463
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,800
He'll have you out soon.

464
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,320
You're far too kind, Miss Todd.

465
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,520
And he's far too ugly
to have a woman like you.

466
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,440
I think common-looking people
are the best in the world.

467
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,240
That's why the Lord
makes so many of them.

468
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,600
I just thank God he was there.

469
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,360
But I won't always be there.

470
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
Mary...

471
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,440
what if something was going on,
something terrible...

472
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,680
and you knew that there was no way
on earth that one man could stop it?

473
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,320
What would you do?

474
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,040
Well...

475
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,240
I wouldn't back away from what's right
just because it's hard.

476
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,800
My father used to say,
"Plant your feet and stand firm.

477
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,240
"The only question is
where to put your feet."

478
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,280
We may fail in this fight.

479
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,360
We may only shatter
the tranquil veil of oppression...

480
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,960
but we must not be deterred!

481
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,120
For ours is a just and noble cause.

482
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,800
The cause of freedom.

483
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,960
The very cause upon which
our founding fathers built...

484
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,160
this great nation!

485
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,840
A voice like that is too strong
to be stuck keeping shop.

486
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,120
I'm actually studying to be a lawyer.

487
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,920
Well, Mr. Lincoln, maybe it's time
you thought about politics.

488
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,520
I can connect you with the right people.

489
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,480
Thank you, Senator Nolan.

490
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,920
-A pleasure young man.
-The same.

491
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You're on your way, Mr. Lincoln.

492
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,760
I sent you to Springfield
to hunt vampires...

493
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,160
not to chase votes.

494
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,360
Lesson one,
always have a contingency plan.

495
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,880
If vampire hunting doesn't pan out...

496
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,400
I need a career to fall back on.

497
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,920
I'm being serious.

498
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,840
So am I, Henry.

499
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,160
I have done everything
you've asked of me.

500
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Every letter, every name...

501
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,240
but never the letter I wait for,
and never the name I want most.

502
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,040
When do I get to kill Jack Barts?

503
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,480
Barts knows about Mary.

504
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,720
It's time.

505
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,960
Abraham...

506
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,480
Be careful.

507
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,920
Abraham-fucking-Linc--

508
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,080
Missed again!

509
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,680
I hope you're better with an axe
than you were with a gun.

510
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,000
Come on, Lincoln!

511
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,000
Catch me before I get to Mary.

512
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,720
Catch me if you can, boy!

513
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,520
There's thousands of us here.

514
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,320
He won't stop until
this whole country is ours.

515
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,360
And they be coming for you now.

516
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,080
Ask your friend, Henry.

517
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,640
You shut your mouth, you stupid whore.

518
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,480
Give me what I need,
or I'll knock your teeth out.

519
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,440
You lying son of a bitch.

520
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,680
God damn it!

521
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,200
No, Abe, stop!

522
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,920
You weren't ready to know.

523
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,720
What, that you are a vampire?

524
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,840
You are not the only one...

525
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,520
who has lost everything to vampires.

526
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,720
Just because the carriage stops...

527
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,840
doesn't mean we have to.

528
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,600
Get in the carriage.

529
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,080
Take this.

530
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,480
Run. Just run.

531
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,840
Henry!

532
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,000
Her soul was pure.

533
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,440
But yours, Henry...

534
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,960
It's one of God's little tricks.

535
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,240
Vampires cannot kill their own kind.

536
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,440
Only the living can kill the dead.

537
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,640
Welcome to the family.

538
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,440
<i>You can't save the world,</i>
<i>and the ones you love, Lincoln.</i>

539
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,800
You need to make a choice.

540
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,440
I'm sorry...

541
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,360
but goodbye.

542
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,440
Abe!

543
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,840
Mary!

544
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,360
What on earth are you doing?

545
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,440
Come on in.

546
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,120
-What are you hiding?
-Nothing.

547
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,160
Abe?

548
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,680
It's nothing.

549
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,080
Abe, I know when you're lying.

550
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,480
What are you hiding from me?

551
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,800
All right.

552
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,000
I didn't want to tell you this way.
This is not the way that I planned it.

553
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,640
But if you really must know...

554
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,320
Mary Todd...

555
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,440
will you make me the happiest of men?

556
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,360
And do you, Abraham...

557
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,280
promise to love her,
comfort her...

558
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,560
be honorable and honest
with her in all things...

559
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,520
in sickness and health...

560
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,800
till death do you part?

561
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,840
I do.

562
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,440
Then by the power vested
in me by almighty God...

563
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,080
in the great state of Illinois...

564
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,440
I now pronounce you...

565
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,440
man and wife.

566
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,000
You may kiss the bride.

567
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,160
Your mother would be so proud.

568
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,240
Thank you, Will.

569
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,640
I'm happy you could be here.

570
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,360
You're the only family I have.

571
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,920
Except for this one.

572
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,040
Congratulations.

573
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,240
May I introduce Mr. Henry Sturges.

574
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,120
My wife, Mary.

575
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,840
And my dear friend, Will Johnson.

576
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,400
Heavens, Mr. Sturges,
you're as chilly as the winter wind.

577
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,800
Henry, please.

578
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,840
I'm afraid that's a hazard
of carrying one's own bottle.

579
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,560
Well, you know what they say,
"Cold hands, warm heart."

580
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,040
Yes, but I highly doubt that.

581
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,840
Mr. Sturges is a business associate.

582
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,760
Yes, I thought we
could talk a little business.

583
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Of course.

584
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,280
If you'll excuse me.

585
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,720
What the hell are you doing here?

586
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,520
Be cautious, Abraham.

587
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,480
One forgets how easily we can lose
the most precious things.

588
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,680
They don't even know who I am.

589
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,760
Go upriver.

590
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,360
Invite this Mr. Lincoln
to join us at the plantation.

591
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,320
We're going to throw a ball
in his honor.

592
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,880
What makes you think he'll accept?

593
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,840
I think we can find a way to tempt him.

594
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,160
It's a good book. It's good.

595
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,440
Get him!

596
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,680
Abe.

597
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,840
We've got a problem.

598
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,160
They took Will.

599
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,160
What are you going to do?

600
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,320
I'm going to accept his invitation.

601
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,040
<i>Speed deserved to know the truth</i>
<i>of what we were about to face.</i>

602
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,840
<i>I told him everything.</i>

603
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,880
<i>Not knowing if he would believe me</i>
<i>or think me mad.</i>

604
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,160
<i>Not knowing if he would have the courage</i>
<i>to face the monsters...</i>

605
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
<i>that I had come to know.</i>

606
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,600
You and me, Abraham,
together we can accomplish anything.

607
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,880
There are no slaves.
Where are they?

608
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,200
I was just wondering that.

609
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,360
Something isn't right about this, Abe.

610
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,400
Yeah.

611
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,600
I don't know how to dance.

612
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,440
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

613
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,080
Wait here.

614
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,760
Ladies and gentlemen...

615
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,720
dinner is served.

616
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,720
Bravo, Mr. Lincoln.

617
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,080
Bravo.
You're even better than I'd heard.

618
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,480
A shame to sacrifice
so many of my best men...

619
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,400
but I needed to know
if you're up to the task.

620
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,080
What do you want with me?

621
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,080
To see you liberated.

622
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,240
To see you rise up
and destroy your oppressor.

623
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,760
That's interesting advice,
coming from a slave owner.

624
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,280
Men have enslaved each other...

625
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,560
since they invented gods
to forgive them for doing it.

626
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,160
I've seen Jews build Egypt's glory.

627
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,480
<i>Seen Christians...</i>

628
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,040
<i>thrown to lions with my own eyes.</i>

629
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,680
<i>And I've seen Africans</i>
<i>sell their own kind to Europeans.</i>

630
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:46,760
<i>May I share one of the revelations</i>
<i>of my 5,000 years?</i>

631
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,520
We're all slaves to something.

632
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,880
I, to eternity.

633
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,240
You, to your convictions.
Others, to the color of their skin.

634
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,200
All I ever wanted...

635
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,080
was to see my kind
granted their rightful place.

636
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,280
But there are those of us,
those like your friend Henry...

637
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,000
who enjoy living in the dark.

638
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,280
And as you're doubtless aware...

639
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,520
I cannot personally destroy him,
nor he I.

640
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,920
You, Mr. Lincoln...

641
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,800
you could eliminate those
last pockets of resistance...

642
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,680
beginning with Henry Sturges himself.

643
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,440
All I ask...

644
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,720
is for you to break your chains.

645
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,560
Kill your master.

646
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,480
Be free.

647
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,880
And if I refuse?

648
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,720
Then you go on your merry way.

649
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,920
After I make you one of us, and...

650
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,440
spoon-feed you your friend.

651
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,440
Now, a simple "yes" or "no"
will suffice.

652
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,240
Kill Henry...

653
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,680
save your friend.

654
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,560
Feel free to take your time to decide.
Five...

655
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
four...

656
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,040
three...

657
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,680
two...

658
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,720
one.

659
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,840
Come on!

660
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,760
This way.

661
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,520
Miss Tubman, Miss Tubman.
We've been waiting for you.

662
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,920
Come quickly.

663
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,680
People getting killed every day.

664
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,600
Slaves disappearing.

665
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,120
Some people talk
about monsters and demons.

666
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,720
Good morning.
Good morning.

667
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,280
How can I assist you
on this beautiful day?

668
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,800
We're looking for three men.

669
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,280
You know, I did see someone
run down that way.

670
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,640
You're welcome to come in if you like.

671
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,480
Our service is about to begin.

672
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,000
Right, let's keep going.

673
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I take it y'all came from up North?

674
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,520
Yes, ma'am.

675
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,320
Well, I suggest you get back there
as fast as you can.

676
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,680
There's a war coming.

677
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,680
A war for the soul of the country.

678
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,680
Going to be all colors of blood spilled.

679
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,000
<i>Our nation was built</i>
<i>on the backs of slaves.</i>

680
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,280
<i>Their labor, their blood.</i>

681
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,200
<i>More blood than</i>
<i>you could possibly imagine.</i>

682
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,080
I have seen this
horror of the South firsthand.

683
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,200
I say the need for peace
outweighs the needs of the Blacks.

684
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,920
I say that if the people
of this great nation want slavery...

685
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,640
then let them have it.

686
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,480
The demon of slavery
is tearing our country apart.

687
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,760
We must stand up.
We must stand strong and fight.

688
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,680
Fight for the very soul of our nation.

689
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,440
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves!

690
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,720
You cannot take on slavery, Abraham.

691
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,560
You cannot take on the whole South!

692
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,200
-Why, because of Adam?
-No.

693
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,680
Are you afraid of him?

694
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,680
Because it is the only thing that has
kept them sated for all these years...

695
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,920
and you take that away,
then no one is safe.

696
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,280
So you get to choose
who lives and who dies.

697
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,400
A great man once said...

698
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,240
"What we do,
we do not for ourselves...

699
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,720
"not for one man,
but for the good of all mankind!"

700
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,880
Not all mankind, Abraham.

701
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,320
Abe?

702
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,640
May I have my husband back?

703
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,600
He's all yours, Mrs. Lincoln.

704
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,680
<i>Henry only saw the struggle his way.</i>

705
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,840
<i>But I began at last to see it another.</i>

706
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,520
<i>To see and to feel</i>
<i>the even greater issues at stake.</i>

707
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,240
<i>So, he and I would go our separate ways.</i>

708
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,600
<i>As the Bible says...</i>

709
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,200
<i>the time had come for me</i>
<i>to put aside childish things.</i>

710
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,760
<i>I would fight not with an ax...</i>

711
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,000
<i>but with words and ideals.</i>

712
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,880
<i>For a time...</i>

713
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,320
<i>they proved a stronger weapon.</i>

714
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,480
Lincoln! Lincoln! Lincoln!

715
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,840
I appear before you to take,
in your presence...

716
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,200
the oath prescribed by
the Constitution of the United States...

717
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,320
to be taken by the president...

718
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,960
before he enters on
the execution of this office.

719
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,960
The question of slavery is better settled
with a pen than with a sword.

720
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,200
Fire!

721
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,160
<i>Through twists of fate...</i>

722
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,520
<i>I found myself at 50 years of age...</i>

723
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:32,160
<i>the father of a nation that</i>
<i>was tearing itself apart...</i>

724
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,600
<i>while trying to be</i>
<i>the father to a boy...</i>

725
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,000
<i>not much older than I was</i>
<i>when I lost my mother.</i>

726
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,040
3,000 more dead.

727
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,680
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

728
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,120
I'm not hungry, thank you.

729
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,520
You have got to eat, Abe.
You're only human.

730
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,120
Come along, Willie.

731
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,400
Willie.

732
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,160
Willie.

733
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,400
If you do this,
there is no turning back, Abe.

734
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,080
I know.

735
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,920
I'm trying to protect the freedom
of a nation.

736
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,080
If this war is truly a stand
against evil...

737
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,640
then let it stand for something.

738
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,040
If it is a war for the freedom of man...

739
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,240
why not give all men
a reason to fight it?

740
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,560
"All persons held as slaves...

741
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,600
"within any state
or designated part of a state...

742
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,920
"the people whereof
shall be in rebellion

743
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,560
"against the United States
shall be then..."

744
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,360
"...and henceforward shall be free."

745
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,800
Good morning.

746
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,200
Precious little one...

747
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,360
what's your name?

748
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,440
Willie.

749
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,680
And your father? What's his?

750
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,640
Abraham.

751
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,640
What a beautiful silver sword.

752
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,040
How is our little soldier faring?

753
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,640
I've never seen anything like it.

754
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,880
I'm sorry.

755
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,600
I don't know what ails your boy.

756
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,480
Abe.

757
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,200
Mary's calling for you.

758
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,120
I'm so sorry, Abraham.

759
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,040
Why didn't they take me?

760
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,400
Because they know...

761
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,200
it is a fate much worse than death.

762
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,280
Mary...

763
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,080
is inconsolable.

764
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,640
She says she doesn't want
to go on without him.

765
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,280
There is a way, Abraham.

766
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,040
You know that I can restore the dead.

767
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,600
Do it.

768
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,320
Do it.

769
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,720
Mary...

770
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,200
Do it!

771
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,440
Your journal...

772
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,040
the one you always
kept in your coat pocket...

773
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,160
I know I shouldn't have, Abe, but
I needed to know what you were hiding.

774
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,840
If what you say is true...

775
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,680
I beg you...

776
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,160
give us our little boy back.

777
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:45,040
Mary, he wouldn't be our little boy.

778
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,000
He would be something else,
something terrible.

779
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,840
Trust me, you don't want that.

780
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
You're asking me to trust you?

781
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,680
After you lied to me
for all these years.

782
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,360
I did it to protect you,
to protect our family.

783
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,600
And how did that work out?

784
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,680
You did this, Abe!

785
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,040
You did this!
You brought this on him!

786
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,800
You brought this on our boy!

787
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,400
Let me go to them.

788
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,480
Make a truce with Adam.

789
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,320
We must stop this war.
Willie's death is just the beginning.

790
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,200
Don't you dare say his name.

791
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,200
I warned you.

792
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,840
You didn't heed me.

793
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,360
How many more boys will have to die
before you listen to me?

794
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,680
<i>These boys are dying in vain.</i>

795
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,600
We should pull the troops back.

796
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,200
Abraham,
this war has cost us countless lives...

797
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,200
not to mention millions of dollars.

798
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,920
I thought we were going
to make this country great...

799
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,760
not tear it apart.

800
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,560
This is the only way
we can save the country now, Speed.

801
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,280
Send in troops.

802
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,240
Union troops are flooding
onto the field.

803
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,080
We are now outnumbered...

804
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,320
and ill-equipped compared to the North.

805
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,720
We will support you...

806
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,400
but you will need to support us.

807
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,120
No, thank you.

808
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,440
Rest assured, Mr. Davis...

809
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,120
you'll have as many of my kind
as you need.

810
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,640
Fire!

811
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,480
Fire!

812
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,000
Ready!

813
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,480
Aim!

814
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,440
Here they come!

815
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,560
Fire!

816
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,920
Why did they drop their rifles?

817
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,840
Fire!

818
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,880
It's the first day of Gettysburg.

819
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,040
It's been a disaster.

820
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,680
I don't think the army
can survive another.

821
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,560
If the rebels break through,
they'll be here... in days.

822
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,240
The generals think
we should evacuate Washington.

823
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,400
Run the war from New York or...

824
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,880
Boston, if need be.

825
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,920
You have to win this war.

826
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,440
If you don't, then all of it...

827
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,080
Then our son's death
will have been for nothing.

828
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,040
How can I win a war...

829
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,400
when I can't even protect my own family?

830
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,000
Our men have no way of defending
themselves against this enemy.

831
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,840
When our bullets are useless,
our bayonets are powerless as this fork!

832
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,160
This...

833
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,120
Will!

834
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,320
Speed!

835
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,120
This. This is what we need.

836
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,720
A fork.

837
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,280
Silver.

838
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,480
Okay, okay.

839
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,720
How much do we need?

840
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,880
All of it.

841
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,680
And why tell me this, Mr. Speed?

842
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,320
Why betray your friend?

843
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:06,080
He is my friend,
but I love this country even more.

844
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,720
And he, more than anyone, is responsible
for tearing this nation apart.

845
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,160
You've done the right thing.

846
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,160
I know.

847
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,840
<i>32, 33, 34, 35...</i>

848
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,280
That is a lot of silver, Abe.

849
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,600
Now, how are we going to
get all this there?

850
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,880
I'm sorry, Mary.

851
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,480
I'm sorry I've kept you in the dark
all these years.

852
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,040
I need you, Mary.

853
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,920
I've waited a long time
to hear you say those words.

854
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,000
I want you to leave Washington, Mary.

855
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,480
Miss Tubman,
please have some tea.

856
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,200
I very much appreciate you coming
to speak with me today.

857
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,760
Oh, yes.

858
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,080
Things have not been easy,
what with my...

859
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,800
The death of my son and the war.

860
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,840
I need to get out of Washington.

861
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,720
And I need a lot of help.

862
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,920
This war ends tonight.

863
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,760
And with it...

864
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,760
our millennia of darkness.

865
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,200
We have to do this on our own.

866
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,120
No one can know what's on that train.

867
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,920
If we don't get those weapons
to those boys at Gettysburg...

868
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:21,200
the war is over.

869
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,360
It's time we had a nation of our own.

870
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,600
Come...

871
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,480
we have a train to catch.

872
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,760
It's 80 miles from here to Gettysburg.

873
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,600
Eighty miles will decide whether
this nation belongs to the living...

874
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,800
or the dead.

875
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,640
Is everything all right, Speed?

876
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,800
I just can't believe
you're still writing in that book.

877
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,120
It's all in here, Speed.

878
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,640
The good with the bad.

879
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,040
What's this?

880
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,400
They're fleeing the nest.

881
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,320
Leaving Washington free for us.

882
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,160
Look at me.

883
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,480
I said look at me.

884
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,040
Leave her.

885
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,360
Don't want to miss this train.

886
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,600
Let's go.

887
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,160
Henry, what the hell are you doing here?

888
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,560
I just wanted to see
how far your foolishness would take you.

889
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,840
I don't have time to argue!

890
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,040
I didn't come here to argue with you.

891
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,920
I came here to tell you that
your dear friend Speed back there...

892
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,280
is a traitor.

893
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,520
He betrayed you, Abe.
Speed is leading you--

894
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,440
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

895
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,680
That's all according to plan.

896
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,000
You must get off this train.

897
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,040
No, you must get off this train.

898
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,160
This is not your war, Henry.

899
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,040
They're here, Abe.

900
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,240
A whole heap of them.

901
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,120
We can't let them stop this train.

902
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,640
You go through there
and you're dead.

903
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,080
Get out now,
it's your last chance.

904
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,640
Did you load that thing?

905
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,200
We've got to keep them
away from the locomotive.

906
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,720
Why don't you let him go, Lincoln?

907
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,000
Emancipate yourselves.

908
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,680
I will never follow you.

909
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,080
You don't have to follow me, Abe.

910
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,080
I have the train.

911
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,720
I have the silver.

912
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,160
Soon I'll have the whole country.

913
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:29,360
I'm going to destroy
the myth of Abraham Lincoln...

914
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,160
so that history will forever know you
not as a man...

915
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,600
but as a monster!

916
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,760
Lincoln set us up.

917
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,000
We've been tricked, Adam.

918
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,480
There is no silver on this train.

919
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,400
Abe!

920
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,800
Abe!

921
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,000
Abe!

922
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,480
Hello, Speed.

923
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,400
Where is the silver?

924
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,440
Silver?

925
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,160
Should be here.

926
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,880
Why did you lie to me?

927
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,440
To get you all in one place...

928
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,800
to finish you.

929
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,240
Speed?

930
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,640
No!

931
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,400
Mr. President!

932
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,160
There is nowhere left to run, Lincoln.

933
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,360
Where is it?

934
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,000
Where is the silver?

935
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,800
Right here!

936
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,640
Thank you, Henry.

937
01:31:55,640 --> 01:32:00,760
I suppose some vampires can be trusted.

938
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,800
As can some men, Abraham.

939
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,480
If the train was a decoy...

940
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,880
where is the silver?

941
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,960
This isn't the only railroad.

942
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,120
A wise man once taught me...

943
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,520
always have a contingency plan.

944
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,200
Get me more!

945
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,600
Bayonets.
Bayonets for Springfield muskets.

946
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,240
Springfield muskets!

947
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,680
Five-pounders and grenades are in
the second wagon in the back.

948
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,080
Go now, go now.

949
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,080
Fire!

950
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,600
<i>Four score and seven years ago...</i>

951
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,880
<i>our fathers brought forth</i>
<i>on this continent...</i>

952
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:55,800
<i>a new nation conceived in liberty...</i>

953
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,280
<i>and dedicated to the proposition...</i>

954
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:02,520
<i>that all men are created equal.</i>

955
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:06,320
<i>Now we are engaged</i>
<i>in a great civil war...</i>

956
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,880
<i>testing whether that nation</i>
<i>or any nation...</i>

957
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:12,560
<i>so conceived and so dedicated...</i>

958
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,920
<i>can long endure.</i>

959
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,120
<i>It is for us, the living, rather...</i>

960
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,120
<i>to be dedicated here...</i>

961
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,920
to the unfinished work
which they who fought here...

962
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,720
have thus far so nobly advanced.

963
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,400
It is rather for us
to be here dedicated...

964
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,800
to the great task remaining before us...

965
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,080
that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause...

966
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:47,080
for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion...

967
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,600
that we here highly resolve
that these dead...

968
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:53,680
shall not have died in vain...

969
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,720
and that this nation, under God...

970
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,600
shall have a new birth of freedom...

971
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,920
and that government...

972
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:06,200
of the people, by the people,
for the people...

973
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:10,040
shall not perish from the earth.

974
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,840
<i>Our enemies have made their exodus.</i>

975
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,000
<i>Some back to Europe...</i>

976
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,280
<i>some to South America and the Orient.</i>

977
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:37,120
<i>They've seen that America shall</i>
<i>forever be a nation of living men...</i>

978
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,120
<i>a nation of free men.</i>

979
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,200
We make rather a good team,
you and I.

980
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:49,200
One can't help but think of all the good
we could do if we had more time.

981
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,440
Limitless time.

982
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,520
Lincoln!

983
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,360
Yes, well, time waits for no man.

984
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:59,560
We're going to be late for the theatre.

985
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,760
Hold onto this for me, Henry.

986
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,800
Mary, darling...

987
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,400
have you seen my hat?

988
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:19,880
It's on your desk in the office.

989
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,000
Have you seen my hat?

990
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,920
Abraham, let me make you immortal.

991
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,720
Let us fight through the ages,
side by side.

992
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,160
Vampires are not
the only things that live forever.

993
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,080
<i>History prefers legends to men.</i>

994
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:56,960
<i>It prefers nobility to brutality.</i>

995
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,280
<i>Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.</i>

996
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,440
<i>History remembers the battle...</i>

997
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,440
<i>and forgets the blood.</i>

998
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,960
<i>However history remembers me,</i>
<i>if it does at all...</i>

999
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:15,440
<i>it shall only remember</i>
<i>a fraction of the truth.</i>

1000
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:41,680
One more.

1001
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:49,360
A guy only gets that drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl or kill a man.

1002
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,640
So, which is it?

1003
01:37:52,640 --> 02:37:52,640
