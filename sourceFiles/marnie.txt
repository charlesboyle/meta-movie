1
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,967
Robbed! Cleaned out!

2
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:37,138
Nine thousand nine hundred
and sixty-seven dollars.

3
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,766
Precisely as I told you
over the telephone.

4
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,642
And that girl did it. Marion Holland!

5
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:45,054
That's the girl. Marion Holland!

6
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:49,561
- Can you describe her, Mr Strutt?
- Certainly I can.

7
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,520
Five feet five.
A hundred and ten pounds.

8
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,033
Size eight dress.

9
00:02:56,952 --> 00:03:01,448
Blue eyes. Black, wavy hair.

10
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,416
Even features. Good teeth.

11
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,661
- (Chuckling)
- What's so damn funny?

12
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:10,460
There's been a grand larceny
committed on these premises!

13
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:14,083
Yes, sir. You were saying,
ah, black hair,

14
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,713
wavy, even features, good teeth.

15
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,594
- She was in your employ 4 months?
- Mmm.

16
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:23,718
What were her references, sir?

17
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:27,894
Well, as a matter of fact -

18
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,736
Yes, uh,
she had references, I'm sure.

19
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:33,442
Oh, Mr Strutt, don't you remember?

20
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,022
She didn't have any references at all.

21
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:40,358
Well, she worked the
copying and adding machines.

22
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:43,112
No confidential duties.

23
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:48,462
(Strutt) Mr Rutland.
I didn't know you were in town.

24
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,584
Just had a robbery. Almost $10,000.

25
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:54,961
So I gathered. By a pretty girl
with no references.

26
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:58,837
You remember her. I pointed her out to
you last time you were here.

27
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:03,226
You said something about how I was
improving the looks of the place.

28
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:07,263
Oh, that one!
The brunette with the legs.

29
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,189
Excuse me. Mr Rutland's a client.

30
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:14,446
I don't think you've got time
to discuss business today, Mr Strutt,

31
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:16,654
what with your crime wave
on your hands.

32
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:20,490
Oh, no, no. Always time for
Rutland business. You know that.

33
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:22,987
How are things in Philadelphia?

34
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:27,661
The little witch! I'll have her
put away for 20 years!

35
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:30,209
I knew she was too good to be true.

36
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,674
Always so eager to work
overtime, never made a mistake.

37
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:37,382
Always pulling her skirt
down over her knees

38
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:41,138
as though they were
a national treasure.

39
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:43,597
She seemed so nice, so efficient.

40
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:47,019
- So -
- Resourceful?

Hello, Mrs Maitland.

48
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,229
Oh, so nice to have you back,
Miss Edgar.

49
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:40,608
- We put you in your same room.
- Thank you, Mrs Maitland.

50
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,901
Can someone drive me over
to Garrod's right away?

51
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:48,155
- Of course. Anytime you're ready.
- Soon as I change.

52
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:06,808
How do, Miss Edgar?
Good to have you back.

53
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:08,436
Hello, Mr Garrod.

54
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,181
Ah, there's my darling!

55
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,891
(Garrod) That big spoiled baby
of yours knew something was up.

56
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,025
Tried to bite me twice
already this morning.

57
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:19,777
Forio, if you want
to bite somebody, bite me.

58
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,701
Thanks.

# Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

# Call for the lady

63

Measles said the nurse.

64
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:14,372
# Nothing said the lady
with the alligator purse. #

65
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,048
Thank you.

(Girls) One, two, three,

67
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:24,968
Oh, it's you. Where's my mother?

68
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,553
She's makin' a pecan pie... for me!

69
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,637
That figures.

70
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:40,273
(Woman) Who is it, Jessie?

71
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,614
- Hello, Mama.
- Well, I just swan. Marnie!

72
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,824
If you're not the very limit.

73
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:49,992
I can't take in the way you jump
all over the place like you do.

74
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,415
(Mama) Boston, Massachusetts.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.

75
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:58,289
I brought you
some chrysanthemums.

76
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:04,338
Those gladiolas are brand fresh.
Miss Cotton brought 'em last night.

77
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:07,759
I never could stand gladiolas.
I ' ll get rid of these.

78
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:11,303
For land's sake - Marnie,
now watch the dripping.

79
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,600
Here, Jessica, why don't you
take these home to your mother?

80
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:16,814
She don't get home from work till 6::00.

81
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:20,069
I'm supposed to stay here till 6::00.

82
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,527
Take them to the kitchen then.
Just get rid of them.

83
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,153
Take 'em to the kitchen
before they drip all over.

84
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:30,831
We could stand gladiolas!

85
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:36,163
I send you plenty of money.
You don't have to be a baby-sitter.

86
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:40,004
Whoever said I did have to?
It's my pleasure.

87
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,636
That smart little ol' Jessie.

88
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:46,640
Marnie, if you could just hear
some of the things that she says.

89
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:48,965
Oh, but I do.

90
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:51,219
Seems I get a report
in exhaustive detail

91
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:54,847
on all the bright sayings
of ol' Jessie Cotton.

92
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,981
What's more, every time I come home,
she's roosting here.

93
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:04,397
I see that you've lighted up
your hair, Marnie.

94
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,655
- A little. Why? Don't you like it?
- No.

95
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:14,040
Too-blonde hair always looks like a
woman's tryin' to attract the man.

96
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,998
Men and a good name
don't go together.

97
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:21,915
I brought you something, Mama.

98
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:26,807
Now what have you thrown
good money away on?

99
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:29,388
Oh, Marnie.

100
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,809
You shouldn't spend all your money
on me like you do.

101
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,435
But that's what
money's for: to spend.

102
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,180
Like the Bible says,
"Money answereth all things."

103
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:44,190
We don't talk smart about the Bible
in this house, missy!

104
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:53,245
Well, I just swan! How do I wear it?

105
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,916
Like this. Real high up under the chin.

106
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:59,461
(Marnie) Oh, it's smart,
it's very, very smart.

107
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:03,415
Goin' around buyin' fur pieces
like they was nothin'.

108
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,966
Mr Pemberton gave me another raise.

109
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:11,180
I told Miss Cotton my daughter is
private secretary to a millionaire.

110
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:15,135
He's as generous with her
as if she was his very own daughter.

111
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:18,434
Miss Bernice, don't you want
to get my hair brushed up

112
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:21,776
- before my mommy gets home?
- I sure do, honey.

113
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:24,188
You run up and get the brush.

114
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,114
Oh, that kid and her hair.

115
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:33,123
Puts me in mind of yours
when you was little. The colour.

116
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:37,080
This side of the street
don't get the afternoon sun.

117
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:39,626
My hip and my leg
ache me somethin' awful.

118
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:46,135
(Footsteps)

119
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:50,850
I got the hairbrush!

120
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,395
Uh, Marnie, mind my leg.

121
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,038
(Mama) I never had time
to take care of Marnie's hair

122
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:19,251
when she was a little kid like you.

123
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:22,672
- How come?
- Oh, child!

124
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:26,341
Well, after I had my bad accident,

125
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:30,012
first I was sick so long,
and then I had to work.

126
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:33,353
(Jessie) Didn't you all have
a daddy either?

127
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,517
No, we didn't. We surely did not!

128
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,766
There.

129
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:42,268
As pretty as brushin' can make you.

130
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:47,068
Oh, sugarpop, it's five after 6:00.
You better scat on home.

131
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:51,488
And you be sure to take
your mama those glads.

132
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,869
How ' bout my pie?
How ' bout my pecan pie?

133
00:13:57,043 --> 00:14:00,079
I ' ll get it done tonight
and bring it over to you.

134
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,497
Now, Jessie, you mind
you go straight home.

135
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:07,052
OK. Bye, Miss Bernice.
See you later, Miss Bernice.

136
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:11,761
(Door Opens, Closes)

137
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,925
Do you really like the scarf, Mama?

138
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:17,428
It's real mink.

139
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,144
Oh, there. You look
just like an old man's darling.

140
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,518
No man ever give me
anything so good.

141
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,613
We don't need men, Mama.

142
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,530
We can do very well for ourselves.
You and me.

143
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:33,703
A decent woman
don't have need for any man.

144
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,956
Look at you, Marnie.

145
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,747
I told Miss Cotton,
look at my girl Marnie.

146
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:44,707
She's too smart to go gettin' herself
mixed up with men... none of 'em!

147
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,302
Well, let's go on back to the kitchen.

148
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,474
I've got to see to that pie.

149
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,283
Uh, Marnie, I've been
thinking seriously

150
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,456
about asking Miss Cotton and Jessie
to move in here with me.

151
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,547
Miss Cotton is a real nice woman.

152
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:27,044
She's decent. A hard-working woman
with a little girl to raise.

153
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,012
Come on, Mama, why don't
you just say what you mean?

154
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,387
What you want is for Jessie
to come live with you.

155
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:40,017
Marnie, you oughtn't let yourself act
jealous of a little ol' kid like that.

156
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:43,476
She don't bother me none.

157
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,108
And we could always use
the extra money.

158
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,189
The Cottons are mighty decent people.

159
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,201
Why don't you love me, Mama?

160
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,915
I've always wondered why you don't.

161
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:05,754
You never give me one part
of the love you give Jessie.

162
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:11,800
Mama -

163
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:14,223
Why do you always
move away from me?

164
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,764
Why? What's wrong with me?

165
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:20,636
Nothing! Nothing's wrong with you.

166
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,274
No. You don't think that.

167
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:24,731
You've always thought there
was something wrong with me.

168
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,772
- Haven't you? Always!
- I never.

169
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,148
My God! When I think
of the things I've done

170
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,818
to try to make you love me.

171
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:36,621
The things I've done!

172
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,292
Hm. What are you
thinking now, Mama?

173
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:45,298
About the things I've done?

174
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:49,415
What do you think they are?
Things that aren't decent, is that it?

175
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:51,302
Well, you think
I'm Mr Pemberton's girl.

176
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:53,050
Is that why you don't
want me to touch you?

177
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:56,094
Is that how you think I get
the money to set you up?

178
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:07,650
I'm... I'm sorry, Mama.

179
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,906
I don't know what got
into me talking like that.

180
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:13,447
I know you've never really
thought anything bad about me.

181
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,371
No, I never.

182
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:19,405
Well, I'm sorry. I really am.

183
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,877
- I'll pick up the pecans.
- No, you go upstairs and lay down.

184
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:28,258
You're all wore out. I'll ask Jessie
to come over and pick up the nuts.

185
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:30,834
Alright.

186
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:37,262
After all... it is Jessie's pie, isn't it?

187
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:49,104
(Clunking)

188
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,908
No, I don't want to. Mama, no!

189
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:05,078
Marnie, wake up. Marnie?

190
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:07,711
Don't make me move, Mama.
It's too cold.

191
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:10,089
Wake up, Marnie.
You're still dreaming.

192
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:15,260
- Get washed up. Supper's ready.
- Oh.

193
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,184
I was having that old dream again.

194
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:23,351
- First the tapping and then -
- I said supper's ready.

195
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:28,482
It's always when
you come to the door.

196
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:30,611
That's when the cold starts.

197
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,165
- Miss Clabon.
- Good morning.

198
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,880
Is Mr Ward in his office?

199
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,754
Yes. He's interviewing for
the new office assistant.

200
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:14,842
Rutland and Company is
an old established publishing -

201
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:19,225
- Oh, Mr Rutland.
- This is Miss Blakely, Mr Rutland.

202
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:23,306
Well done. You'll hear from us,
Miss Blakely, I'm sure.

203
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,888
Thank you for your time, Mr Ward.
Good day, Mr Rutland.

204
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:28,438
Good day, Miss Blakely.

205
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,857
Well, I guess that does it. She seems
to have the exact qualifications -

206
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:37,660
Come in for a moment, please.

207
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,752
Now, sit down, Mrs... Taylor.

208
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:54,002
Thank you.

209
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:57,257
(Ward) I have here your
Pittsburgh references.

210
00:20:57,432 --> 00:21:01,096
Reference, that is. Kendall's, yes.

211
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:03,096
This the only reference
you have to show us?

212
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,435
Well, Mr Ward, I have good training,
but I've had very little actual experience.

213
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,483
Kendall ' s was my first real job.

214
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:13,401
After I finished school, I was married.
My husband was a CPA.

215
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,530
He helped me keep up
with my training.

216
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,867
I learned a great deal more from him:
accounting, cost-price,

217
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:21,991
- even something about computers.
- (Ward) I see.

218
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:25,949
When my husband died
very suddenly last November,

219
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:29,377
he left me a little money,
but I felt I needed work.

220
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,789
Good, hard, demanding work.

221
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,501
I got the job at Kendall's,
but it was -

222
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,221
Well, it wasn't a
very exacting position,

223
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:41,304
and there didn't seem much chance
for anything else at Kendall's.

224
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:44,394
I don't mean pay. Salary isn't the most
important thing with me,

225
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:47,315
but more interesting work, Mr Ward.

226
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:50,982
Something that
will keep me busy, occupied.

227
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:54,863
I don't care how much work
I'm given or what hours I work.

228
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:58,318
(Ward) Uh, Mrs Taylor,
why did you leave Pittsburgh?

229
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:00,783
After my husband died, I just -

230
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:03,825
(Ward) Mrs Taylor, this is a post
of some confidence.

231
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,867
(Marnie) Oh, please, let me have
a chance to prove myself, Mr Ward.

232
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,299
Uh... very well, Mrs Taylor.

233
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:21,341
I suppose you might as well
report to work on Monday.

234
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:27,976
Miss Clabon in the
outer office will brief you.

235
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:32,859
I'll be out in just a moment.

236
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:36,529
Taking her on without references?
You' re always such a stickler -

237
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,483
Let's just say I'm an interested
spectator in the passing parade.

238
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:42,619
I don't get it.

239
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:45,161
You're not supposed to get it.

240
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:50,579
Hi, Miss Clabon.

241
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:53,045
Hello, Mr Sam.
How's the curmudgeon business?

242
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:55,542
Oh, Miss Mainwaring!

243
00:22:56,428 --> 00:23:00,212
Is Mark in? I want a free lunch,
and somebody to cash a check.

244
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,763
I thought I'd stick Mark
for the lunch and you for the cash.

245
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:04,974
Go right on in.

246
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:08,139
(Ward) You have your
Social Security card, Mrs Taylor?

247
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:12,395
- Of course. Right here in my purse.
- Who's the dish?

248
00:23:14,238 --> 00:23:17,821
Miss Clabon will show you around.
She's been with us for seven years.

249
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:21,989
I believe she finds the work
exacting enough. Good day, Mrs Taylor.

250
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:24,701
Miss Clabon, will you call personnel
and have them send the forms up?

251
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:27,329
Certainly, Mr Ward.

252
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:35,630
(Miss Clabon) Hello.
This is Mr Ward's office.

253
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:39,669
Would you send up a W-4
and the rest of the employment forms?

254
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:42,006
Yes, before lunch. I'll wait.

255
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:44,390
Thank you.

256
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:48,510
Maud, what about Saturday?

257
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,394
No, I only thought as you said
your mother wasn't coming with us,

258
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:53,940
I just wanted to make sure
about our reservations.

259
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:57,948
Well, why don't you call me back?

260
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,075
Alright. Anytime.

261
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:10,075
Thanks, Mr Sam, I ' ll try not
to do anything sensible with it.

262
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:14,879
- Bye, Miss Clabon.
- Bye.

263
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,501
That's Lil Mainwaring,
Mr Rutland's sister-in-law.

264
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,638
- Her sister was Mr Rutland's wife.
- Was?

265
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:24,512
She died about a year and a half ago.
Some kind of heart thing.

266
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,302
Imagine. Only 29.

267
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,018
Well, anyway,
she kind of brought Lil up.

268
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:32,896
Lil lived with them
and old Mr Rutland down at Wykwyn.

269
00:24:33,777 --> 00:24:37,858
I get the feeling little ol' Lil
plans to stay on... permanently.

270
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:43,046
Anyway, like I was saying,
old Mr Rutland - that's Mark's father -

271
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:45,715
they say he's never
even been inside this place.

272
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:49,059
The company was headed into
the ground when Mark took over.

273
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:53,939
They say the first week
he was here he retired... ha, retired,

274
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,693
three board members, the acting
president, the president's secretary.

275
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:01,861
Coffee time, ladies.

276
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,698
- Do you mind bringing me a cup?
- Just coffee? Donut, Danish?

277
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:13,874
- Lady, have I got for you a Danish!
- No, just coffee.

278
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:17,083
- Oh, I'm out of red ink.
- Oh, here, use mine.

279
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,343
- I'll get it.
- No, no, I will.

280
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:24,807
Thanks.

281
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,328
Mrs Taylor, are you hurt?

282
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:50,990
(Mark) Mrs Taylor!

283
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:53,377
I think she's hurt. Find out!

284
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:57,294
Mary, are you alright?

285
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,925
What?

286
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:02,799
Of course, I'm alright. I just
spilled a little ink on my blouse.

287
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:06,008
The way you rushed out of the office -
Mr Rutland's standing out there.

288
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,472
- He said he thought you were hurt.
- Well, I'm not.

289
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:12,309
All that happened was I spilled
a little ink on my blouse.

290
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:15,316
Good heavens! What a lot
of excitement over nothing.

291
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:44,464
(Phone Ringing)

292
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:50,680
Why in the world does he keep locking
and unlocking that drawer?

293
00:27:50,854 --> 00:27:53,013
He never can remember
the safe combination.

294
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,565
It's locked in that drawer.

295
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,105
Mr Rutland and I have keys too,
for emergencies.

296
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,479
It's only five numbers,
for Pete's sake.

297
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:07,283
Mrs Taylor? I've just had a call from
Mr Rutland, Mrs Taylor.

298
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:11,659
He remembered your saying
you'd be willing to work overtime.

299
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:14,701
He wondered if you'd be prepared
to work on Saturday?

300
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:18,876
- Saturday? Of course. What time?
- Two-thirty.

301
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,671
I ' ll advise Mr Rutland
that you are available.

302
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:53,287
(Thunderclaps)

303
00:29:13,313 --> 00:29:16,315
- (Knocking)
- (Mark) Come in, Mrs Taylor.

304
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:20,487
Good afternoon, Mr Rutland.

305
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:29,241
Are you interested in
pre-Columbian art, Mrs Taylor?

306
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:32,873
Those were collected
by my wife. She's dead.

307
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,702
The only things of hers I've kept.

308
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:39,961
And that's Sophie. She's a jaguarundi.

309
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:43,964
South American. I, uh... trained her.

310
00:29:44,136 --> 00:29:46,176
Oh? What did you train her to do?

311
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,259
To trust me.

312
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:50,183
Is that all?

313
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,932
That's a great deal...
for a jaguarundi.

314
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:55,772
Shall we get to work?

315
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:58,480
You can use the typewriter over there.

316
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:01,024
I want an original
and one copy of this.

317
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:03,105
If you can't decipher
any of this, speak up.

318
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:06,199
I typed it myself and
I'm a very creative typist.

319
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:16,617
"Arboreal Predators
of the Brazilian Rain Forest."

320
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:19,665
Before I was drafted
into Rutland's, Mrs Taylor,

321
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,583
I had notions of being a zoologist.

322
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,209
- I still try to keep up with my field.
- Zoos?

323
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:27,972
Instinctual behaviour.

324
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,722
Oh. Does zoology include people,
Mr Rutland?

325
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:35,265
Well, in a way. It includes all
the animal ancestors

326
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:37,230
from whom man derived his instincts.

327
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:39,727
Ladies' instincts too?

328
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:43,234
That paper deals with
the instincts of predators.

329
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,813
What you might call the criminal class
of the animal world.

330
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:50,444
Lady animals figure
very largely as predators.

331
00:31:00,464 --> 00:31:02,090
(Thunderclaps)

332
00:31:08,223 --> 00:31:09,966
Put on the overhead light if you like.

333
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:12,632
The switch is by the door.

334
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:16,976
(Thunderclaps)

335
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,568
Why don't you sit down, Mrs Taylor?

336
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:33,991
If the storm worries you that much,
I'll get you something to drink.

337
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:37,957
Mrs Taylor?

338
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:52,473
The building is grounded, Mrs Taylor.

339
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:58,438
You' re quite safe here...

340
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:00,853
from the lightning.

341
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,108
The colours! Stop the colours!

342
00:32:08,284 --> 00:32:10,775
What colours?

343
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:51,865
It's over. All over. You're alright.

344
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,582
OK now? Would you like something
to drink? Some brandy?

345
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,210
- No, thank you. I'm awfully sorry.
- Oh, don't be silly.

346
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,295
- Why do colours bother you?
- Colours?

347
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:08,041
You seem to be terrified
of some colours.

348
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,883
No, no. What I'm terrified
of is thunder and lightning.

349
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:17,187
I wouldn't have pegged you as a woman
terrified of anything.

350
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,450
Well, we've all got to go sometime.

351
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:37,916
Look, this place is wrecked
and you're in no state to work.

352
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:40,326
Suppose I drive you home.
You can do this job some other time.

353
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:43,540
- Thank you. I -
- Go get your things.

354
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,219
It's cold and damp here.

355
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:52,721
I must get the maintenance people in.

356
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:14,280
- I'm really sorry about the cabinet.
- Why should you be?

357
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:17,076
You said it was all
you had left of your wife.

358
00:34:17,249 --> 00:34:20,500
I said it was all I had left
that had belonged to my wife.

359
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,709
Oh.

360
00:34:24,172 --> 00:34:26,628
(Car Radio) "Native Winkler is second.
Hopeless is third."

361
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:29,635
Oh, no please. I'd like to hear.

362
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:31,962
- You like racing?
- I like horses.

363
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,381
I go to the races when I can.

364
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,770
- Was your husband a track fan?
- Yes.

365
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:42,058
- And you go alone now?
- Yes.

366
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:45,942
Atlantic City track's open
till the end of the month.

367
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:49,362
We could drive out there next Saturday.

368
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:51,193
Alright.

369
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:54,452
- Are you fond of horses?
- No, not at all.

370
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,366
(PA Announcer) "Fast Return
moving up on the outside. "

371
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:04,874
(Announcer Continues)

372
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:24,390
Well, that's another one.

373
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:27,153
Oh, I like it here like this.

374
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,733
You' re the expert.
What do you like in the next race?

375
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:34,482
Lemon Pudding. He's finished third
his last three times out.

376
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:37,828
- Got a good jockey up today.
- Lemon Pudding it is.

377
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:42,790
The morning line says he's four to one.
I'll get on him.

378
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:49,051
(Man) Pardon me.

379
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:51,543
But you're Peggy Nicholson, aren't you?

380
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:53,596
Remember me?

381
00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:56,557
I'm sorry. What did you say?

382
00:35:56,726 --> 00:36:00,890
- Aren't you Peggy Nicholson?
- No, I'm not.

383
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:04,978
Yeah? I was pretty sure you were.
When I first saw you down here -

384
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:08,437
I'm sorry, you've made a mistake.
I am not Miss Nichols.

385
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,820
- Nicholson.
- Nicholson.

386
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:14,575
Frank Abernathy introduced us
a couple of years ago in Detroit.

387
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,330
Frank Abernathy.
You remember Frank.

388
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,990
No, I do not know anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

389
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:25,917
I have never known anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

390
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,580
- Now, will you please go?
- Aw, come on now, honey.

391
00:36:28,758 --> 00:36:31,000
You're trying to pull my leg,
aren't you?

392
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:33,550
(Mark) Now, why should any young lady
want to pull your leg?

393
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:37,556
Oh, sorry. I thought
I recognised this lady.

394
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,350
- Did he recognise you?
- No.

395
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,387
- You did not recognise her.
- I said I thought I recognised her.

396
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:46,401
- I said I'm sorry.
- Good for you. You've apologised.

397
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:49,060
You may go now.

398
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:56,908
- You came back so quickly.
- Yes. Who's your fan?

399
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,404
I just seem to have one of those faces.

400
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:01,909
Well, what do you like
in the next race?

401
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:04,836
Can we go to the paddock?
I'd like to see Telepathy.

402
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:09,048
Been watching him ever since I saw him
work out once as a two-year-old.

403
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:35,992
Oh, I believe that's
our old friend Telepathy.

404
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:38,736
Yeah, number eight. Telepathy.

405
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:49,962
He's a lanky-looking piece of business,
but I bow to your superior knowledge.

406
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,300
- What is it? What ' s the matter?
- Don't bet him.

407
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,222
- Why not?
- He's walleyed.

408
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,260
Can we go now?

409
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:15,063
What a paragon you are.
You don't smoke, drink or gamble.

410
00:38:15,618 --> 00:38:17,693
Just this once... for luck.

411
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,706
- I don't believe in luck.
- What do you believe in?

412
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:23,124
Nothing.

413
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,708
Oh, horses, maybe.
At least they're beautiful,

414
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:29,252
and nothing in this world like people.

415
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:32,416
Oh, yes, people. A thoroughly bad lot.

416
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:34,135
Generally.

417
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:36,462
Did you have a tough childhood,
Mrs Taylor?

418
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,015
Not particularly

419
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:43,436
I think you did. I think you've had
a hard, tough climb.

420
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,930
But you're a smart girl, aren't you?

421
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:48,598
The careful grammar,
the quiet good manners.

422
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:52,228
- Where did you learn them?
- From my betters.

423
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:55,854
What about your tough childhood,
Mr Rutland?

424
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:59,201
The old, sad story.
Promising youth blighted.

425
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:03,203
Dragged down by money,
position, noblesse oblige.

426
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,413
By the time I came along,
the company was hanging on the ropes.

427
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:10,672
We had about 1,000 employees who were
about to go down for the count.

428
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:12,216
What about the Rutlands?

429
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,376
What would've happened to your family?

430
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,878
Nothing ever happens to a family that
traditionally marries

431
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:19,132
at least one heiress
every other generation.

432
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:20,684
(Crowd Cheering)

433
00:39:22,478 --> 00:39:27,768
You shouldn't've chickened. Your
walleyed reject just won by 4 lengths.

434
00:39:30,445 --> 00:39:32,687
I think I've had enough. Can we go?

435
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:34,239
If you like.

436
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:36,316
The track's open
till the end of the month.

437
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:39,409
That gives us two more Saturdays.

438
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:44,455
If your luck holds out, by this time
next month, I'll be a rich man.

439
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:56,838
- Oh, Miss Nicholson.
- You really are pressing your luck.

440
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:06,765
Where are we going this time?

441
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,391
I thought it was time I brought you
home to meet my old man.

442
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:13,653
- You should've told me.
- You're alright.

443
00:40:13,822 --> 00:40:17,570
Dad goes by scent. If you smell
anything like a horse, you're in.

444
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:39,421
Here we are, old bean. The homestead.

445
00:40:53,404 --> 00:40:56,191
- Hello, Dad.
- Who's this?

446
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:58,323
This is Mary Taylor.
Mary, this is my father.

447
00:40:58,493 --> 00:41:00,651
- How do you do, Mr Rutland?
- A girl, is it?

448
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:04,280
It's alright, Dad. She's not really
a girl, she's a horse-fancier.

449
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:07,162
The track's closed. I thought if
I brought her to see your horses,

450
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:10,289
- I'd hold her attention a bit longer.
- Splendid, splendid!

451
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:14,675
Come along, my dear.
I was just about to have a cup of tea.

452
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:23,345
Oh, Mary, this is my
sister-in-law, Lil Mainwaring.

453
00:41:23,518 --> 00:41:25,345
- Mary Taylor.
- How do you do?

454
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:27,847
Hi. I've seen you
at Rutland's, haven't I?

455
00:41:28,023 --> 00:41:32,519
(Rutland) It bewilders me what any
of you can find to do at Rutland's.

456
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:38,898
Oh, dear! I think I rather sprained
my wrist this afternoon.

457
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:44,279
There's sure to be droppage
and spillage. Would you mind awfully?

458
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:49,575
(Rutland) Strong, please.
No milk, two lumps of sugar.

459
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:52,209
The meals in this house
are shocking bad,

460
00:41:52,381 --> 00:41:55,002
but I do insist on good
Horn and Hardart cake at tea.

461
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:58,461
You take yours with lemon,
don't you, Lil?

462
00:41:58,638 --> 00:42:01,094
Yes, lemon for Lil, Mary.

463
00:42:02,683 --> 00:42:04,759
Strong with a dash of rum for me.

464
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:08,435
(Rutland) Spinster's tea.
Mucking up tea with strong drink.

465
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:12,306
- Something sneaky about it, eh?
- What's your opinion, Miss Taylor?

466
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:14,893
Do you think old Mark here
is a sneaky one?

467
00:42:15,863 --> 00:42:18,189
Possibly.

468
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:21,866
How do you take your tea, Miss Taylor?

469
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:24,278
Usually with a cup
of hot water and a tea bag.

470
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:26,863
(Rutland) Lazy habit, my dear.

471
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:29,614
I'll have quite a large slice
of that butter cake, please.

472
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:32,499
- Do you ride, Miss Taylor?
- A little.

473
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:34,998
Best thing in the world
for the inside of a man or woman

474
00:42:35,174 --> 00:42:37,297
is the outside of a horse.

475
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:39,461
I shouldn't think you'd find
old Mark very interesting.

476
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:41,804
- Doesn't hunt. Doesn't even ride!
- Please, Dad!

477
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,180
I was hoping to lead up
gently to all that.

478
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,973
I'd even planned to show her
the horses first.

479
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:49,971
Swill that down or bring it
with you to the stables.

480
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:53,103
Mark's trying to act as if he brought
Miss Taylor out to see the horses.

481
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:56,611
- He really brought her to see me.
- Really? Whatever for?

482
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:59,236
Showing off. I'm quite
a presentable old party, you know.

483
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:02,151
Lil, I'm sure your sturdy young wrist

484
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:05,661
has recovered sufficiently
to pour Dad another cup of tea.

485
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:08,037
- I will have another cup.
- I can't!

486
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,747
"When duty whispers low, thou must."

487
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,454
"Then youth replies, I can."

488
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:18,416
Ratfink! And you misquoted!

489
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,989
Will you come up and spend
next weekend with us?

490
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:52,709
You can bring your tea bag,
have your pick of the horses.

491
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,426
Good night, Mary. I have to run.
See you on Monday.

492
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:02,718
Good night, Susan.

493
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:08,519
(Woman) Good night. See you on Monday.

494
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,783
I haven't got my powder puff.
Have you got one?

495
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,254
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

496
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,002
- Come on.
- Alright, I'm coming.

497
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:40,295
You mean we have to hang around
and wait until he calls?

498
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,305
- Good night, girls.
- Good night. I'll see you.

499
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,132
- Have a good weekend.
- Yeah.

500
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,764
I think that's terrible.

501
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:50,178
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know. Let's get home.

502
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,730
He may have already called you.

503
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,807
If I miss his call,
that's the way it goes.

504
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,225
This is the best one you've had!

505
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,027
(Door Closes)

506
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,786
(Indistinct Chatting)

507
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:28,908
(Clunking Noise)

508
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,750
(Door Opens, Closes)

509
00:48:51,643 --> 00:48:54,051
You' re sure makin' time tonight, Rita.
What's the big rush?

510
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:57,645
I wanna get to bed.
That's the big rush.

511
00:49:31,517 --> 00:49:33,843
Please get down.

512
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:37,353
You'll walk back to the stables.
I'll ride.

513
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:42,017
Are you stayin' at an inn or have you
friends among the local gentry?

514
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:45,231
- You said you didn't trust horses.
- I don't, but they trust me.

515
00:49:45,406 --> 00:49:49,072
Which brings us directly to our
relationship, Miss Edgar!

516
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:03,793
Is Edgar your real name?
And you're blonde.

517
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:07,834
You'll save time and make for better
feeling if you tell me the truth.

518
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:11,797
Is Edgar your real name?
Now, don't crowd me, lady!

519
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:14,430
I'm fighting a powerful impulse
to beat the hell out of you.

520
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:18,189
At last we communicate.

521
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:21,816
Now, for the third and last time,
is Edgar your real name?

522
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:24,523
And don't bother to lie to me.
I'll check you out in every detail.

523
00:50:24,696 --> 00:50:28,398
- Yes. Margaret Edgar.
- Where are you from?

524
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,904
California.

525
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:32,703
- Where in California?
- Los Angeles.

526
00:50:32,872 --> 00:50:34,282
Where's the money?

527
00:50:37,793 --> 00:50:39,952
Here! Some of it.

528
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:42,335
- Where's the rest?
- Don't worry. It's safe.

529
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:46,587
Safe? At some pari-mutuel window?
Or gone on mother's operation?

530
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:49,548
Or perhaps you're putting
your kid brother through school?

531
00:50:49,722 --> 00:50:52,260
I don't have a kid brother
or a mother. I don't have anybody.

532
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:53,808
Not even Mr Taylor?

533
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:56,977
I wouldn't be surprised to hear
the rest of the haul

534
00:50:57,146 --> 00:50:59,518
is with your late husband, Mr Taylor.

535
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:03,107
Somewhere I expect to find him
happily reincarnated,

536
00:51:03,278 --> 00:51:06,362
the pockets of his good blue burial
suit bulging with Rutland money.

537
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:09,402
The rest of the money is in
a registered package addressed to me

538
00:51:09,576 --> 00:51:11,235
in a post office box in New York.

539
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:14,246
You can pick it up there by tomorrow.
Here's the key.

540
00:51:14,413 --> 00:51:17,830
Thank you, Miss Edgar.
Now I'll take the registration receipt.

541
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:24,164
This receipt and the package are
as good as a signed confession.

542
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,591
You understand that? Alright.
Now, where does Mr Taylor come in?

543
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:30,716
There's no such person.
I've never been married.

544
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:33,012
Mrs Taylor was an old
friend of my mother's.

545
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:36,386
And when you applied at Rutland's,
the name just came to your mind.

546
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:40,346
I was trying to get away from my
cousin Jessie. She's no good.

547
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:44,225
If she found out about the insurance
money, she'd try to get some.

548
00:51:44,403 --> 00:51:45,779
Make trouble for me.

549
00:51:45,947 --> 00:51:49,397
- What insurance money?
- Mrs Taylor's.

550
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:52,611
- She died.
- Oh, Mrs Taylor died. Pity.

551
00:51:52,786 --> 00:51:55,408
Now you're working with
this naughty cousin Jessie.

552
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:56,991
Nobody's working with me!

553
00:51:57,166 --> 00:52:00,369
You talk as if this was some
regular thing I do... did.

554
00:52:00,544 --> 00:52:02,169
All planned in cold blood.

555
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:05,007
- And it wasn't?
- No!

556
00:52:05,174 --> 00:52:07,333
You're not from Los Angeles,
Miss Edgar.

557
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:09,836
Insurance is only pronounced
insurance in the South.

558
00:52:10,012 --> 00:52:12,503
And that's where you're from.
Where? Around here?

559
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:15,636
You' re a cold-practised,
method-actress of a liar.

560
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:18,218
- I can't help it.
- It would appear not.

561
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:21,931
I don't mean that.
I mean, I wasn't born in California.

562
00:52:22,108 --> 00:52:24,066
I was born in Richmond, Virginia.

563
00:52:24,235 --> 00:52:26,312
My father deserted us
when I was a baby.

564
00:52:26,487 --> 00:52:29,821
My mother and I lived
in Richmond until I was seven.

565
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:34,320
Then we went to California.
Mother worked in aeroplane factories.

566
00:52:34,496 --> 00:52:36,322
That's the truth. I swear it!

567
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:41,041
My mother died when I was ten.
And Mrs Taylor took care of me.

568
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:43,370
Come on, get moving.

569
00:52:45,215 --> 00:52:46,591
How did you find me?

570
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:49,676
You're here to answer
the questions, ol' girl.

571
00:52:49,845 --> 00:52:52,051
How did you get
the combination to Ward's safe?

572
00:52:52,222 --> 00:52:56,683
- I took Susan's key from her purse.
- I see.

573
00:52:56,852 --> 00:53:00,802
Now, suppose you just begin
at the beginning.

574
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:05,939
It's just like I told you. I was born
in Richmond. We were poor.

575
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:09,278
We were grindingly poor.

576
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,907
- I was so alone after Mother died.
- Well, go on.

577
00:53:17,081 --> 00:53:20,581
You still have my attention.

578
00:53:20,752 --> 00:53:25,746
I just went to school and took care
of Mrs Taylor until she died.

579
00:53:25,923 --> 00:53:30,669
She left me her house
and $5,000 in insurance.

580
00:53:33,682 --> 00:53:38,924
I sold the house. It had a mortgage
so I only got $9,000 cash.

581
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:43,892
But there I was with $14,000! Me!

582
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:46,475
I could do exactly
what I wanted to with it.

583
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,360
There isn't much more. I bought Forio.

584
00:53:50,532 --> 00:53:53,652
- Forio?
- My horse at Garrod's.

585
00:53:53,827 --> 00:53:56,199
I had two wonderful years.

586
00:53:56,371 --> 00:53:59,787
Then last November it was all gone
so I had to get a job.

587
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:02,034
I went to Pittsburgh
and got the job at Kendall's

588
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:04,287
until I could look around
for something better.

589
00:54:04,463 --> 00:54:06,123
Alright, let's try again.

590
00:54:06,298 --> 00:54:11,505
Let's back up and turn that Mt Everest
of manure into a few facts.

591
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:13,257
One: Your dates are all wrong.

592
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,135
Previously you were employed
by the firm of Strutt and Company.

593
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:18,301
I saw you there once.

594
00:54:18,477 --> 00:54:22,557
Mr Strutt is the tax consultant
for Rutland and Company.

595
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:25,104
He pointed you out to me.
You were a brunette then.

596
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:28,810
Then some months later,
he pointed out your absence.

597
00:54:28,988 --> 00:54:31,277
You mean, you knew all
about that when you hired me?

598
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:33,488
No. I wasn't positive.

599
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:37,657
But I thought it might be interesting
to keep you around.

600
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:41,199
And all this time you've been trying
to trip me up, trap me!

601
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:45,001
Um, I'm not sure any more.

602
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:48,504
I think I was just... curious at first.

603
00:54:48,675 --> 00:54:52,803
Then things got out of control and...
I liked you.

604
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:54,465
So I see!

605
00:54:55,682 --> 00:54:57,639
Incidentally, I think
you took a bit of a chance,

606
00:54:57,809 --> 00:55:01,676
knowing that Rutland's
was a client of Strutt's.

607
00:55:01,855 --> 00:55:02,886
I didn't.

608
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:06,481
My job at Strutt's didn't give me
access to all the clients' names!

609
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:11,232
Alright. Let's... get on.

610
00:55:11,406 --> 00:55:13,445
We've established that
you're a thief and a liar.

611
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:15,326
Now, what is the degree?

612
00:55:15,494 --> 00:55:18,531
Are you a compulsive thief?
A pathological liar?

613
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:21,660
- What difference does it make?
- Some!

614
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:25,160
It makes some difference... to me.

615
00:55:30,968 --> 00:55:33,044
Have you ever been in jail?

616
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,130
Certainly not.

617
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:39,600
I know you'll never believe me now,
and it's my own fault.

618
00:55:40,395 --> 00:55:42,932
It's true about Strutt. I did it.

619
00:55:43,105 --> 00:55:47,399
I don't know why.
I just kind of went crazy, I guess, but...

620
00:55:47,568 --> 00:55:50,854
Old Mr Strutt was so -
Oh, I hated him!

621
00:55:51,864 --> 00:55:53,240
Like you hate me?

622
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,785
Oh, no, not you.

623
00:56:05,878 --> 00:56:08,334
Clean up your face.

624
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:14,344
Come on.

625
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:46,581
Good afternoon.

626
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:58,423
- What'll you folks have?
- A frank and a coffee, please.

627
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:00,259
- Same for me.
- (Waitress) Okey-doke.

628
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,428
Let's get on
with that little discussion.

629
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:08,974
The chronic use of an alias is not
consistent with your story

630
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:12,686
of sudden temptation
and unpremeditated impulse.

631
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,315
What if you'd stolen almost $10,000?

632
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:18,034
Wouldn't you change your name?

633
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:22,110
Oh, what's the use? Why should I even
try to make you understand?

634
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:24,746
I'm not only trying to understand you,
I'm trying to believe you!

635
00:57:24,918 --> 00:57:27,243
- Why?
- Because, damn it, I want to!

636
00:57:27,421 --> 00:57:30,338
Can you understand that?

637
00:57:31,007 --> 00:57:32,882
Here you are, folks.

638
00:57:34,177 --> 00:57:36,004
Mark?

639
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:41,719
The reasons for what I did
at Rutland's,

640
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:45,726
they were so mixed up,
what I wanted to say before.

641
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:52,896
I needed to get away, can't you see?
Away from Rutland's.

642
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:56,773
Don't you understand?
Things were - We were -

643
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:59,786
So we were.
Was that any reason to run away?

644
00:57:59,954 --> 00:58:02,444
Yes. I thought it was time
I got out before I got hurt.

645
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:05,328
I mean, why try to kid myself?

646
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:08,039
- Are you called Margaret?
- Marnie.

647
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:15,752
- Oh, God, Mark, if you let me go -
- I can't let you go, Marnie.

648
00:58:15,928 --> 00:58:19,262
Somebody's got to take care of you
and help you. I can't turn you loose.

649
00:58:19,432 --> 00:58:23,679
If I let you go, I'm criminally
and morally responsible.

650
00:58:24,187 --> 00:58:25,562
Then what -

651
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:30,603
Marnie. Yeah, that suits you.

652
00:58:32,236 --> 00:58:34,359
Alright, Marnie,
this is how it's gonna be.

653
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:38,070
I'm driving you back to Philadelphia.

654
00:58:38,243 --> 00:58:41,113
Tonight we'll go to the house.
Tomorrow you'll go to Rutland's.

655
00:58:41,288 --> 00:58:44,787
You'll see that Susan's key finds
its way back into her purse.

656
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,832
How can I go back to Rutland's?

657
00:58:47,002 --> 00:58:50,122
You' re covered. I replaced the money.

658
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:53,503
When I called yesterday
and found you'd pulled out,

659
00:58:53,676 --> 00:58:55,549
I knew instantly what had happened.

660
00:58:56,177 --> 00:58:58,751
So I went to Rutland's
and checked Ward's safe.

661
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:03,474
Figured the loss and replaced it.
Then I set out to find you.

662
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:08,220
Remember at the races
when you were hot about Telepathy?

663
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,275
You'd said you'd watched him
training as a two-year-old.

664
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:15,813
That's all I had to go on,
so I looked him up,

665
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:19,109
and found he'd been bred by
a Colonel Marston of Virginia.

666
00:59:19,535 --> 00:59:24,778
I phoned Marston and asked him
if anyone there had horses for hire.

667
00:59:24,957 --> 00:59:26,534
He gave me the names of three.

668
00:59:27,835 --> 00:59:31,038
Yesterday I drove up to the plains,
checked out the stables. No luck.

669
00:59:31,213 --> 00:59:34,832
But at the last place, the man said
why didn't I try Garrod's

670
00:59:35,009 --> 00:59:37,464
over by Middleburg?

671
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:40,423
(Waitress) You folks be sure
and come back now.

672
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:45,350
Why are you taking me
back to Wykwyn?

673
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:48,312
Because I don't trust you
not to run away.

674
00:59:48,481 --> 00:59:50,723
How can I run away?

675
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,570
You have the receipt,
the post office key,

676
00:59:53,736 --> 00:59:56,572
- my name.
- Margaret Edgar.

677
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,282
You sure that's
all the name you have?

678
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:01,321
You sure you haven't misplaced an old
husband or two in your travels?

679
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:03,570
I told you I've never been married.

680
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,998
- Near misses?
- No!

681
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:09,116
And no lovers, no steadies, no beaus,

682
01:00:09,294 --> 01:00:11,203
no gentlemen callers, nothing!

683
01:00:12,297 --> 01:00:13,839
OK. Eat up.

684
01:00:17,553 --> 01:00:20,803
- Mark, I'd like to go freshen up.
- Uh-uh.

685
01:00:20,973 --> 01:00:23,927
You're fresh enough. Come on.

686
01:00:34,653 --> 01:00:36,277
You know, I can't believe you, Marnie.

687
01:00:36,447 --> 01:00:39,199
There must've been a great
many men interested in you.

688
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:42,949
I didn't say men weren't interested
in me. I wasn't interested in them.

689
01:00:43,496 --> 01:00:45,488
- Never?
- No!

690
01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:49,456
That is... not until -

691
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,372
- Why me?
- Because you were different, Mark.

692
01:00:55,925 --> 01:00:57,669
It won't wash, Marnie.

693
01:00:58,302 --> 01:01:00,295
But it's true! I really liked you.

694
01:01:02,015 --> 01:01:03,390
Yes, I think you did.

695
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:06,264
But don't try to make it sound
like any more than that.

696
01:01:07,312 --> 01:01:09,518
When we get home,

697
01:01:09,689 --> 01:01:12,940
I'll explain that we had a lover's
quarrel. That you ran away.

698
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:15,268
That I went after you
and brought you back.

699
01:01:15,446 --> 01:01:18,197
That'll please Dad. He admires action.

700
01:01:18,824 --> 01:01:22,239
Then I ' ll explain that we' re gonna be
married before the week is out,

701
01:01:22,786 --> 01:01:24,410
therefore you should stay on at Wykwyn.

702
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:26,952
That I can't bear to
have you out of my sight.

703
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:29,366
He also admires wholesome animal lust.

704
01:01:30,835 --> 01:01:33,291
We'll be married just
as soon as the law allows.

705
01:01:33,463 --> 01:01:36,381
We'll catch an outbound boat.
Where do you want to go?

706
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:39,835
- You ever been to the South Seas?
- What are you trying to pull?

707
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:43,302
I'm trying to pull... a proposal.

708
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:45,641
Let's see, how shall I phrase it?

709
01:01:46,393 --> 01:01:49,015
- How ' bout: Will you be mine?
- You're crazy!

710
01:01:49,188 --> 01:01:53,268
- You're out of your mind!
- That's a possibility.

711
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,768
The name. Marnie. Yes, I'll just go on
calling you Marnie.

712
01:01:55,944 --> 01:01:59,693
That's easily explained. Pet name.
But the Taylor.

713
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,784
We'll just have to marry you off
as Mary Taylor. It's perfectly legal.

714
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:07,322
You can sign yourself Minnie Q Mouse
on a marriage licence,

715
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:08,958
you're still legally married.

716
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,952
But you know what I am.

717
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,998
I ' m Minnie Q Thief!
I'm - I'm a thief and a liar!

718
01:02:14,172 --> 01:02:18,917
It seems to be my misfortune to have
fallen in love with a thief and a liar.

719
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:22,127
In love?

720
01:02:23,056 --> 01:02:25,511
Oh, Mark, if you love me,
you'll let me go.

721
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:29,264
Just let me go, Mark, please.

722
01:02:29,771 --> 01:02:31,811
Mark, you don't know me.

723
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:39,189
Listen to me, Mark. I am not like
other people. I know what I am!

724
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:40,775
I doubt that you do, Marnie.

725
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:43,985
We'll just have to deal with
whatever it is that you are.

726
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:47,070
Whatever you are, I love you.

727
01:02:48,582 --> 01:02:51,252
It's horrible, I know.
But I do love you.

728
01:02:52,211 --> 01:02:54,453
You don't love me.

729
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:57,037
I'm just something you've caught!

730
01:02:57,215 --> 01:02:59,671
You think I'm some kind
of animal you've trapped.

731
01:03:00,261 --> 01:03:01,803
That's right, you are.

732
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:05,554
And I've caught something
really wild this time, haven't I?

733
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:08,928
I've tracked you and caught you,
and by God, I'm gonna keep you!

734
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,063
Oh, and, Marnie, when we get home,

735
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:14,231
no cute ideas about absconding
with the Wykwyn silver.

736
01:03:14,733 --> 01:03:16,526
Just get a grip on yourself
for one short week

737
01:03:16,694 --> 01:03:19,101
and after that
you can take legal possession.

738
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,946
Like you?
Like you take legal possession?

739
01:03:24,619 --> 01:03:25,994
Yes, if you want to put it that way.

740
01:03:27,038 --> 01:03:29,743
Somebody's gotta take on the
responsibility for you, Marnie.

741
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:33,708
And it narrows down to a choice of
me or the police, ol' girl.

742
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:52,099
- Indispensable.
- (Rutland Chuckling)

743
01:03:52,272 --> 01:03:55,226
Ah, Cousin Bob, I almost forgot.
Do you have the old necessary?

744
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,645
Have fun, my dear.

745
01:03:56,735 --> 01:03:58,609
Traveller's checks in this.
Letter of credit in this.

746
01:03:58,779 --> 01:04:03,108
Thanks, old man. Will you see about
having my car picked up at the airport?

747
01:04:03,284 --> 01:04:06,403
Bob is our banking cousin.
A very handy fellow.

748
01:04:09,957 --> 01:04:12,116
Take care, Lil.

749
01:04:12,293 --> 01:04:14,167
We'll send you a noble savage.

750
01:04:14,337 --> 01:04:15,961
- Goodbye, Dad.
- Bye, Mark.

751
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:19,047
Thank you, Dr Gillian. Without you
it wouldn't have been legal.

752
01:04:19,216 --> 01:04:21,209
It's been a pleasure.

753
01:04:27,433 --> 01:04:31,513
(Rutland) Let's go finish the champagne
and cake before they spirit it away.

754
01:04:31,813 --> 01:04:35,513
Really splendid cake, you know?
I attended to that myself.

755
01:04:35,691 --> 01:04:37,434
I've made the acquaintance
of one of those

756
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,069
excellent Horn and Hardart executives.

757
01:04:39,237 --> 01:04:42,606
That engagement ring must
have been at least five carats.

758
01:04:43,324 --> 01:04:47,369
Six and a half.
Blue-white. Perfect stone.

759
01:04:47,537 --> 01:04:49,826
His mother left
perfectly good jewellery.

760
01:04:49,998 --> 01:04:51,741
It's just sitting there at the bank.

761
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:55,701
He wanted her to have something
that had never belonged to anyone else.

762
01:04:55,879 --> 01:04:58,204
But six and a half carats!

763
01:04:59,216 --> 01:05:01,504
And cashing in a bond
to pay for a ring.

764
01:05:01,676 --> 01:05:03,965
But he didn't pay for it.
He charged it.

765
01:05:04,179 --> 01:05:05,722
I helped him pick it out.

766
01:05:05,889 --> 01:05:09,590
It cost $42,000... plus tax.

767
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:13,098
Did you say $42,000?

768
01:05:13,272 --> 01:05:16,059
The man's deranged.

769
01:05:16,484 --> 01:05:18,606
You know what he did to me
last Saturday?

770
01:05:18,778 --> 01:05:23,107
He came out to the club
waving a check for $7,000,

771
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:26,733
and insisted that I break up
my golf game, go in and open the bank,

772
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:28,819
and hand over to him $7,000.

773
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:31,197
Then he drew out -

774
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:35,667
Well, let ' s just say, enough to pay for
this trip, plus the letter of credit.

775
01:05:35,836 --> 01:05:38,754
He cashed that very nice bond
against my advice,

776
01:05:38,923 --> 01:05:40,999
made me get him the money.

777
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:43,840
Ten thousand in small bills.
And when I asked him

778
01:05:44,011 --> 01:05:46,847
why he wanted $10,000
in small bills, he said,

779
01:05:47,015 --> 01:05:52,471
"Well, old man, I'm being blackmailed,
and they specified small bills. "

780
01:05:52,646 --> 01:05:55,397
I know that most people
find Mark's humour charming.

781
01:05:55,607 --> 01:06:00,398
I do not. There is nothing charming
about running through -

782
01:06:02,864 --> 01:06:05,355
Including the unpaid bill for a ring,

783
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:09,359
approximately $70,000 in one week.

784
01:06:09,537 --> 01:06:13,370
A $6,000 or $7,000
South Seas honeymoon,

785
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:16,626
conservatively speaking,
and a $42,000 ring.

786
01:06:17,295 --> 01:06:19,787
All that money spent to celebrate what?

787
01:06:19,965 --> 01:06:22,503
This meager, furtive little wedding?

788
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:26,428
He didn't even ask Mother.

789
01:07:16,939 --> 01:07:19,478
"Pay off Strutt."

790
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,567
Strutt.

791
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:01,436
Booze?

792
01:08:01,902 --> 01:08:03,978
Shall I, uh, fix you a drink?

793
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:12,615
(Knocking)

794
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:16,118
Would you like some bourbon
to brush your teeth?

795
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,703
(Marnie) No, thank you.

796
01:08:20,672 --> 01:08:23,838
Contrary to the movies
and the Ladies Home Journal,

797
01:08:24,217 --> 01:08:27,384
the battleground of marriage
is not, I repeat, not,

798
01:08:27,596 --> 01:08:29,672
the... bedroom.

799
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:33,594
The real field of battle is the bath.

800
01:08:33,768 --> 01:08:36,057
It is in the bath and for the bath,

801
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:38,222
that the lines are drawn
and no quarter given.

802
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:42,767
It seems to me, we are getting off
to a dangerously poor start, darling.

803
01:08:42,944 --> 01:08:45,732
You've been in the bathroom
exactly 47 minutes.

804
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:50,606
You can have the bath now.

805
01:08:50,785 --> 01:08:53,074
Thank you.

806
01:08:54,414 --> 01:08:58,033
You're very sexy
with your face clean.

807
01:08:59,753 --> 01:09:01,746
Marnie, come here.

808
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:14,758
Sit down.

809
01:09:27,574 --> 01:09:29,650
I... can't! I can't! I can't!

810
01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:32,369
For God's sake, Marnie!

811
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:38,792
I can't stand it! I'll die!
If you touch me again, I'll die!

812
01:09:42,004 --> 01:09:47,248
I promise I won't touch you. Just
get out of that damn corner, please.

813
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:52,635
Now, suppose you tell me
what this is all about.

814
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:54,218
Is it your own little way of saying

815
01:09:54,392 --> 01:09:56,135
you don't find me particularly
attractive?

816
01:09:56,311 --> 01:09:58,849
I told you not to marry me.
I told you!

817
01:09:59,022 --> 01:10:01,098
Oh, God, why couldn't
you have just let me go?

818
01:10:01,482 --> 01:10:02,763
Marnie.

819
01:10:02,984 --> 01:10:07,064
- Don't! Please, don't!
- Let me fix you a drink.

820
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:09,196
- I don't want a drink.
- A brandy -

821
01:10:09,366 --> 01:10:11,572
I don't want it. Just leave me alone!

822
01:10:11,743 --> 01:10:14,151
Not till I find out what's the matter,
and some way to help.

823
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:18,030
The only way you can help me
is to leave me alone!

824
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:22,705
Can't you understand? Isn't it clear?
I cannot bear to be handled!

825
01:10:23,797 --> 01:10:26,550
- By anybody? Or just me?
- You. Men.

826
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:30,757
Really?

827
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:35,672
You didn't seem to mind
at my office that day, or at the stables.

828
01:10:35,851 --> 01:10:37,974
And all this last week
I've handled you.

829
01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:40,268
I've kissed you many times.

830
01:10:40,981 --> 01:10:44,315
Why didn't you break out into a cold
sweat and back into a corner then?

831
01:10:44,485 --> 01:10:49,526
- I thought I could stand it if I had to.
- I see.

832
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:51,775
Have you always felt like this?

833
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:54,739
- Always, yes!
- Why? What happened to you?

834
01:10:54,995 --> 01:10:58,116
Happened? Nothing.
Nothing happened to me.

835
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:00,616
I just never wanted anybody
to touch me!

836
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,580
You ever tried to talk about it,

837
01:11:03,754 --> 01:11:05,961
to a doctor or somebody
who could help you?

838
01:11:06,132 --> 01:11:08,208
No, why should I?
I didn't want to get married.

839
01:11:08,969 --> 01:11:11,175
It's degrading. It's animal!

840
01:11:11,513 --> 01:11:13,340
Anyway, I was doing alright
the way I was.

841
01:11:13,514 --> 01:11:17,299
I wouldn't say that. If I hadn't caught
you, you'd have gone on stealing.

842
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:21,689
- No. No I wouldn't
- Yes, you would, again and again.

843
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:25,107
Eventually, you would've
got caught by somebody.

844
01:11:25,277 --> 01:11:27,151
You're such a tempting little thing.

845
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:31,152
Some other sexual blackmailer
would've got his hands on you.

846
01:11:31,325 --> 01:11:35,157
The chances of it being someone as
permissive as me are pretty remote.

847
01:11:35,328 --> 01:11:37,820
Sooner or later,
you'd have gone to jail.

848
01:11:38,165 --> 01:11:42,163
Or been cornered in an office by some
old bull of a businessman

849
01:11:42,336 --> 01:11:44,542
who was out to take what he figured
was coming to him.

850
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:46,671
You'd probably have got him and jail.

851
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:50,376
So I wouldn't say you were
doing alright, Marnie.

852
01:11:50,553 --> 01:11:54,503
- I'd say you needed help.
- I don't need your help.

853
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:59,307
I don't think you're capable
of judging what you need.

854
01:11:59,478 --> 01:12:04,022
What you do need, I expect,
is a psychiatrist.

855
01:12:04,609 --> 01:12:05,807
Oh... men!

856
01:12:06,235 --> 01:12:10,613
Say "no thanks to one", and bingo,
you're a candidate for the funny farm.

857
01:12:10,782 --> 01:12:13,190
It would be hilarious
if it weren't pathetic.

858
01:12:15,287 --> 01:12:18,287
Let's try to get some rest, hm?
We'll talk this out tomorrow.

859
01:12:18,456 --> 01:12:21,742
There's nothing to talk out.
I've told you how I feel.

860
01:12:21,918 --> 01:12:25,832
I'll feel the same way tomorrow,
and the day after, and the day after that!

861
01:12:26,548 --> 01:12:30,296
Alright, Marnie. We won't talk about it
until you want to.

862
01:12:30,469 --> 01:12:33,920
But we're gonna be on this damn boat
for many days and nights.

863
01:12:34,723 --> 01:12:37,640
Let's drop this for the present
and try to get through this

864
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:40,431
bloody honeymoon cruise with
as much grace as possible.

865
01:12:40,604 --> 01:12:44,471
Let's try at least to be...
kind to each other.

866
01:12:44,942 --> 01:12:46,650
Oh. Kind!

867
01:12:47,444 --> 01:12:50,362
Alright, if that's too much,
I'll be kind to you,

868
01:12:50,531 --> 01:12:53,781
- and you'll be polite to me -
- You won't -

869
01:12:56,662 --> 01:12:58,738
I won't.

870
01:13:00,457 --> 01:13:02,534
I give you my word.

871
01:13:05,087 --> 01:13:07,376
Now, let's try to get
some rest, hm? How 'bout it?

872
01:13:08,257 --> 01:13:12,800
You in your bed over there, and me,
light years away in mine here.

873
01:13:14,596 --> 01:13:15,972
Thank you.

874
01:13:17,099 --> 01:13:21,643
I think I'd like to stay out here
for a while, but... thank you.

875
01:13:34,826 --> 01:13:37,613
You're gonna bring a little pazazz
down to the old farm, my dear.

876
01:13:37,787 --> 01:13:41,203
I noticed before we left,
Dad was pulling out his silk shirts.

877
01:13:41,374 --> 01:13:43,830
What do you mean,
what will I do with myself?

878
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,209
I had of course assumed
I would become a society hostess.

879
01:13:46,379 --> 01:13:50,460
In Africa, in Kenya, there's quite
a beautiful flower.

880
01:13:50,633 --> 01:13:53,552
It's coral coloured with
little green-tipped blossoms,

881
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:56,425
rather like a hyacinth.

882
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,350
If you reach out to touch it,

883
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,721
you'd discover that the flower
was not a flower at all,

884
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:07,772
but a design made up of hundreds
of tiny insects called Fattid bugs.

885
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,231
They escape the eyes of hungry birds

886
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:13,322
by living and dying
in the shape of a flower.

887
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,831
I'll close the door, if you don't mind.
The light bothers me.

888
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:38,843
Hm, what's that, dear?
The light? Oh, yes, of course.

889
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:42,682
You've been an absolute darling
about my sitting up reading so late.

890
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:45,600
I'm boning up on marine life

891
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:48,230
since entomology doesn't seem
to be your subject,

892
01:14:48,402 --> 01:14:51,605
and I'm eager to find a subject,
Marnie, any subject.

893
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:55,111
Alright. Here's a subject.

894
01:14:55,283 --> 01:15:00,526
How long? How long do we have to stay
on this boat, this trip?

895
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:02,864
How long before we can go back?

896
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:06,042
Why, Mrs Rutland!
Can you be suggesting

897
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,999
that these halcyon
honeymoon days and nights,

898
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,458
just the two of us alone
together... should ever end?

899
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:22,800
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to bed.

900
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,511
I've told you the light
from the sitting room bothers me.

901
01:15:25,731 --> 01:15:28,768
We certainly can't have anything
bothering you, can we?

902
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:29,974
(Door Slams)

903
01:15:30,277 --> 01:15:33,397
If you don't want to go
to bed, please get out.

904
01:15:34,615 --> 01:15:36,572
But I do want to go to bed, Marnie.

905
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:39,238
I very much want to go to bed.

906
01:15:40,204 --> 01:15:42,280
(Screams) No!

907
01:15:43,624 --> 01:15:45,249
(Gasps)

908
01:15:52,008 --> 01:15:54,416
I'm sorry, Marnie.

909
01:17:20,515 --> 01:17:23,053
(Door Closes)

910
01:19:13,297 --> 01:19:15,290
(Coughs)

911
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:23,554
Why the hell
didn't you jump over the side?

912
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,681
The idea was to kill myself,
not feed the damn fish.

913
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,441
Mark!

914
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:42,654
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Was Fiji grisly?

915
01:19:42,828 --> 01:19:46,362
We didn't get to Fiji. We jumped ship
in Honolulu and flew back.

916
01:19:46,539 --> 01:19:50,372
We had to take a cab from the airport.
We're tired and grimy.

917
01:19:50,544 --> 01:19:52,702
Remember when you were six?
You wanted to go to New York.

918
01:19:52,879 --> 01:19:54,837
I warned you then that
travelling was a nasty business.

919
01:19:55,006 --> 01:19:57,248
You poor thing.
You must be exhausted.

920
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,917
I think that we'll go after the
first drink and pop up to bed.

921
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:03,298
The travel lecture will
have to wait for morning.

922
01:20:03,474 --> 01:20:05,716
- Where's the rest of your luggage?
- A t the airport.

923
01:20:05,893 --> 01:20:10,471
I ' ll have breakfast with you in the
morning, dad. See you then, Lil.

924
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:23,991
Come on, Marnie. It's not exactly
a house of correction, you know.

925
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:10,996
Look, Marnie,

926
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:15,296
for the present all we've got is the
facade, and we've got to live it.

927
01:21:16,173 --> 01:21:18,878
Dad has breakfast downstairs
at 8::30 every morning.

928
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:22,336
I always join him. So, naturally,
as you want to be with me as -

929
01:21:30,437 --> 01:21:31,896
This is the drill, dear.

930
01:21:32,064 --> 01:21:36,690
Wife follows husband to front door.
Gives and or gets a kiss.

931
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:39,696
Stands pensively as he drives away.

932
01:21:39,863 --> 01:21:42,900
Oh, a wistful little wave is optional.

933
01:21:55,254 --> 01:21:58,421
Mark, are you... going to the office?

934
01:21:58,591 --> 01:22:01,924
On the first day back after our
honeymoon? How indelicate.

935
01:22:02,095 --> 01:22:06,175
No, I'm going down the road
on a little errand. I'll see you later.

936
01:22:06,349 --> 01:22:10,133
Mark, I, um...
I don't have any money.

937
01:22:10,728 --> 01:22:14,856
I'm sorry, Marnie. I'll have Bob
make out an account for you.

938
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:20,643
It won't be much for a while. You see,
I've had a lot of heavy expenses.

939
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:23,279
And you might as well know
I've paid off Strutt.

940
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:25,277
Anonymously, of course.

941
01:22:25,536 --> 01:22:28,536
- (Marnie) But that's all over!
- So?

942
01:22:28,706 --> 01:22:31,825
(Marnie) So, you've given away $10,000,

943
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:33,792
so you' re a prize fool!

944
01:22:33,961 --> 01:22:36,961
Possibly, but they don't put
you in jail for being a fool.

945
01:22:37,131 --> 01:22:39,503
I'm not the one the cops are after.
Not yet.

946
01:22:39,675 --> 01:22:42,296
And I don't intend to be.
Not if I can prevent it.

947
01:22:42,469 --> 01:22:45,838
Perhaps you, madam, but not me.

948
01:23:18,798 --> 01:23:21,585
(Phone Dialling)

949
01:23:39,069 --> 01:23:41,145
Hello, Mama?

950
01:23:41,446 --> 01:23:44,233
No, I'm alright.
I'm perfectly alright now.

951
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:48,862
I had a bad case of the flu
and just didn't feel up to writing.

952
01:23:49,037 --> 01:23:52,073
I couldn't. I had laryngitis too.

953
01:23:52,249 --> 01:23:55,914
Yes, I am still a little hoarse.

954
01:23:56,837 --> 01:23:58,166
Look, Mama, I can't talk long.

955
01:23:58,338 --> 01:24:03,464
I just called to tell you that I'm
alright and I'll send some money soon.

956
01:24:03,636 --> 01:24:06,423
No, I can't. I don't know when
I'll get to Baltimore.

957
01:24:06,597 --> 01:24:10,429
But not for a few weeks anyway.
But I'll talk to you soon.

958
01:24:10,601 --> 01:24:16,224
If you need anything, write to me
at the post office box in Philadelphia.

959
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:18,890
I've got to go now, Mama.

960
01:24:19,067 --> 01:24:22,069
Goodbye. Goodbye, Mama.

961
01:24:35,377 --> 01:24:38,212
(Horn Honking)

962
01:25:02,946 --> 01:25:07,240
Oh, Forio! Oh, beauty!

963
01:25:39,025 --> 01:25:41,313
Well, she said she could ride a little.

964
01:25:43,195 --> 01:25:45,236
- Mark?
- Hm?

965
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:48,242
Mark, listen. I'm a good fighter
if you need me.

966
01:25:49,618 --> 01:25:51,991
I mean, if you are in
some kind of trouble.

967
01:25:52,163 --> 01:25:55,615
I have absolutely no scruples.
I'd lie to the police or anything.

968
01:25:55,792 --> 01:25:57,701
What on earth are you talking about?

969
01:25:58,544 --> 01:26:01,711
I heard you and Marnie
this morning right out here.

970
01:26:01,881 --> 01:26:04,669
- Heard?
- OK, I eavesdropped.

971
01:26:05,677 --> 01:26:08,512
We should've made you go to college
or come out or something.

972
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:12,808
- I can see that now.
- Don't patronise me, Mark.

973
01:26:12,893 --> 01:26:16,594
That Mary-Marnie, brown-haired blonde
you married so fast and sneaky

974
01:26:16,689 --> 01:26:18,765
and tried to hustle off
to the South Pacific!

975
01:26:18,941 --> 01:26:23,649
I didn't have to overhear stuff about
your not intending to go to jail too,

976
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,694
to know that
you're in some sort of fix.

977
01:26:27,366 --> 01:26:30,367
- Please, Mark, will you let me help?
- Alright, you can help.

978
01:26:30,536 --> 01:26:34,997
You can help by being nice to Marnie.
She needs a friend.

979
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:38,202
I always thought that a girl's
best friend was her mother.

980
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:43,290
Poor old Mark.
Is her mother that ghastly?

981
01:26:43,465 --> 01:26:47,215
When the in-laws are so grim,
you don't invite them to the wedding.

982
01:26:47,387 --> 01:26:51,218
The usual excuse is poor health
or the strain of the trip, you know?

983
01:26:51,391 --> 01:26:53,716
But to claim they're dead,
now, come on!

984
01:26:54,352 --> 01:26:57,935
Alright, Lil, what is it you're up to?
Out with it.

985
01:26:58,106 --> 01:27:02,186
Me? I'm just offering you my services.

986
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,396
Guerrilla fighter, perjurer,
intelligence agent.

987
01:27:05,572 --> 01:27:09,155
- Alright, intelligence agent.
- Baltimore.

988
01:27:09,325 --> 01:27:11,402
There's a mother in Baltimore.

989
01:27:11,577 --> 01:27:13,286
Marnie made
a phone call this morning.

990
01:27:13,455 --> 01:27:16,124
She said she hadn't been able to write
because she'd had the flu.

991
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:20,455
She didn't know when she'd go to
Baltimore, but she'd send money.

992
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:24,792
She said to go on writing to her
at the same post office box.

993
01:27:27,553 --> 01:27:30,719
I listened through the library door.

994
01:27:31,932 --> 01:27:35,764
She's having you on, Lil.
It's some sort of gag.

995
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:38,344
You've been ratty. She's set out
to teach you some manners.

996
01:27:38,897 --> 01:27:41,733
- You're being had, Lil.
- You can say that again!

997
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:45,565
But I don't want to say it again.
I don't want to have to say it again.

998
01:27:45,738 --> 01:27:47,814
Alright, Mark.

999
01:27:48,991 --> 01:27:50,651
You seem to be growing up, Lil.

1000
01:27:51,034 --> 01:27:53,906
I expect what we should do
is find you some young man.

1001
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:57,247
- What's your type?
- I was waiting for you.

1002
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,159
I'm queer for liars.

1003
01:28:00,336 --> 01:28:03,586
Really? Well, what sort
of liar do you fancy?

1004
01:28:03,757 --> 01:28:07,339
We could run an ad. Do you prefer
an indoor liar or an outdoor liar?

1005
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:09,088
Playboy or Field and Stream?

1006
01:28:19,981 --> 01:28:23,765
Anybody home? Hi! Where's Marnie?

1007
01:28:24,152 --> 01:28:27,817
She and Dad are still out riding.
He is taking her over the hunt country.

1008
01:28:27,989 --> 01:28:30,527
Big deal! She's going
to ride with the hunt.

1009
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,942
And Dad's throwing some kind of bash
to introduce her.

1010
01:28:34,121 --> 01:28:38,118
- Has a long-distance call come in?
- No. Not that I know of.

1011
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:41,126
- (Phone Ringing)
- I'll get it.

1012
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,622
(Mark) Hello. Yes.

1013
01:28:45,799 --> 01:28:47,258
Hold on, I want to take it
on another phone.

1014
01:28:48,802 --> 01:28:50,794
I ' ll take it upstairs.
Hang up as soon as I get it.

1015
01:28:54,015 --> 01:28:57,800
Uh, Lil, you will hang up, won't you?

1016
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,959
OK, Lil.

1017
01:29:21,293 --> 01:29:23,963
Hello? Yes I ' ll talk to him now.

1018
01:29:24,506 --> 01:29:27,672
Hello, Mr Boyle. Found anything
interesting down there?

1019
01:29:27,841 --> 01:29:31,127
Hold on. Let me get a pencil.
OK, ready.

1020
01:29:32,764 --> 01:29:36,097
Bernice Edgar.

1021
01:29:36,268 --> 01:29:42,436
116 Van Buren Street, Baltimore.

1022
01:29:42,607 --> 01:29:44,066
Yeah, I got that. Go on.

1023
01:29:47,779 --> 01:29:49,902
Wait a minute!

1024
01:29:50,073 --> 01:29:52,196
You say she killed him?

1025
01:29:52,367 --> 01:29:55,202
Well, when was that?

1026
01:29:55,871 --> 01:29:58,540
That means the little girl must've been
about five, is that right?

1027
01:29:58,707 --> 01:30:01,791
Well, what happened to her?
No, not the woman. The child.

1028
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,833
I want to know what happened
to the little girl, the daughter.

1029
01:30:08,508 --> 01:30:11,130
No, no! Stay on there.
Get me anything else you can.

1030
01:30:11,303 --> 01:30:13,545
Look, have photostats made
of all the court records.

1031
01:30:13,722 --> 01:30:16,759
Send them to me immediately.
Yes, to my office. Registered.

1032
01:30:16,933 --> 01:30:19,555
You're doing an
excellent job, Mr Boyle.

1033
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:22,180
(Lil) Did you have a good ride?

1034
01:30:22,397 --> 01:30:26,348
Yeah. Ah, Mr Boyle,
get the photostats to me. Yes.

1035
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:30,145
And call me the minute
you get anything further on the child.

1036
01:30:30,322 --> 01:30:33,110
Thank you.
I'll expect to hear from you.

1037
01:30:33,284 --> 01:30:35,407
Goodbye.

1038
01:30:46,798 --> 01:30:49,419
(Tapping)

1039
01:30:49,593 --> 01:30:53,590
- (Tapping Continues)
- Mama? Oh, Mama, don't cry.

1040
01:30:54,556 --> 01:30:56,382
Please don't cry, Mama.

1041
01:30:57,892 --> 01:31:01,759
- (Tapping)
- No! No!

1042
01:31:02,522 --> 01:31:04,598
Mama?

1043
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:07,937
Mama, don't cry.

1044
01:31:09,029 --> 01:31:11,318
- (Tapping Continues)
- No!

1045
01:31:12,324 --> 01:31:15,858
Mama? Mama?

1046
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:20,612
- (Knocking At Door)
- Mama?

1047
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,748
- Mama?
- Wake up, Marnie.

1048
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:24,496
- Mama?
- Marnie?

1049
01:31:26,255 --> 01:31:30,466
Mama? Oh, don't hurt my mama.

1050
01:31:31,426 --> 01:31:35,259
- Marnie.
- Please don't hurt my mama!

1051
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:44,645
- Marnie.
- (Gasps) Oh, don't, don't!

1052
01:31:47,026 --> 01:31:49,943
- What's going on?
- She's having a nightmare.

1053
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:54,819
- No, Mama. Mama?
- Marnie, wake up, it's just a nightmare.

1054
01:32:00,123 --> 01:32:03,242
- She's alright.
- I'm cold.

1055
01:32:05,587 --> 01:32:08,706
That's supposed to be your department,
isn't it, ol' boy?

1056
01:32:09,549 --> 01:32:11,755
Good night, all.

1057
01:32:27,818 --> 01:32:31,317
- Let me get you a brandy.
- Uh-uh.

1058
01:32:31,989 --> 01:32:34,693
Where did you get these things?

1059
01:32:36,201 --> 01:32:38,822
I can get more anytime I want them.

1060
01:32:38,995 --> 01:32:42,495
Yeah, of course you can. You can
also find, at your convenience,

1061
01:32:42,666 --> 01:32:45,786
heights, ropes, ovens,
even plastic bags.

1062
01:32:45,961 --> 01:32:48,120
The world's full of alternatives.

1063
01:32:48,797 --> 01:32:51,170
I'd like to go back to sleep now.

1064
01:32:51,342 --> 01:32:55,719
Why? Your sleep seems even less
agreeable than your waking hours.

1065
01:32:56,764 --> 01:32:59,089
That, uh, dream.

1066
01:32:59,267 --> 01:33:02,801
You know, you've had it before.

1067
01:33:02,978 --> 01:33:05,267
Is it about something that
really happened to you?

1068
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:09,519
No, I... I don't know
what it means. Nothing.

1069
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:14,229
Well, it's about your mother.
She wants you to get up.

1070
01:33:14,907 --> 01:33:18,323
Yes, but first there
are the three taps.

1071
01:33:20,122 --> 01:33:24,285
And then she says, "Get up, Marnie.
You have to get up now!"

1072
01:33:24,459 --> 01:33:27,663
But I don't want to. If I -

1073
01:33:27,838 --> 01:33:30,708
If I get up, I'll be cold
and they'll hurt her!

1074
01:33:31,466 --> 01:33:34,136
Who? Who'll hurt her?

1075
01:33:34,303 --> 01:33:37,801
Th-Th- Them!

1076
01:33:37,972 --> 01:33:40,345
I don't know! I don't know!

1077
01:33:40,517 --> 01:33:43,387
But I hear the noises.
I'm cold and I hear the noises!

1078
01:33:43,729 --> 01:33:46,599
What noises? What are they like?

1079
01:33:52,154 --> 01:33:54,230
Who makes them?

1080
01:34:01,414 --> 01:34:03,703
You Freud, me Jane?

1081
01:34:07,586 --> 01:34:11,833
If you won't see an analyst,
why don't you try to help yourself?

1082
01:34:12,716 --> 01:34:16,762
But that's why I'm in this trap,
from trying to help myself.

1083
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:19,053
Just leave me alone, Mark, please.

1084
01:34:19,223 --> 01:34:20,717
If I give you some books,
will you read them?

1085
01:34:22,601 --> 01:34:25,307
Your new homework?
Frigidity In Women?

1086
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,101
The Psychopathic Delinquent
and Criminal?

1087
01:34:28,274 --> 01:34:31,940
- Have you read them?
- I don't need to read that muck

1088
01:34:32,112 --> 01:34:36,359
to know that women are stupid and
feeble and that men are filthy pigs!

1089
01:34:39,452 --> 01:34:43,865
In case you didn't recognise it,
that was a rejection.

1090
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:47,789
I want you to read them.
Start with The Undiscovered Self.

1091
01:34:48,044 --> 01:34:51,745
Oh, for God's sake, Mark,
leave me alone! I'm tired!

1092
01:34:53,801 --> 01:34:56,373
Why can't you just leave me alone?

1093
01:34:57,930 --> 01:35:00,171
Because I think
you're sick, ol' dear.

1094
01:35:01,933 --> 01:35:04,009
I'm sick?

1095
01:35:04,937 --> 01:35:07,688
Well, take a look
at yourself, ol' dear.

1096
01:35:07,856 --> 01:35:11,521
You're so hot to play
Mental Health Week, what about you?

1097
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:17,067
Talk about dream worlds. You've got
a pathological fix on a woman,

1098
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:21,452
who's not only an admitted criminal
but who screams if you come near her!

1099
01:35:24,457 --> 01:35:27,161
So what about your dreams, Daddy dear?

1100
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,787
I never said I was perfect.

1101
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:34,002
That was quite a speech.
It encourages me to believe

1102
01:35:34,175 --> 01:35:36,464
that you have leafed through
one or two books.

1103
01:35:36,635 --> 01:35:38,842
Which one did you find
the most interesting?

1104
01:35:41,474 --> 01:35:44,344
You're really dying
to play doctor, aren't you?

1105
01:35:46,313 --> 01:35:50,476
OK, I'm a big movie fan.
I know the games.

1106
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:53,022
Come on. Let's play.

1107
01:35:53,194 --> 01:35:56,149
Shall I start with dreams
or should we free-associate?

1108
01:35:57,573 --> 01:36:01,737
Oh, Doctor, I'll bet you're
just dying to free-associate.

1109
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:05,872
Alright now, you give me a word
and I ' ll give you an association.

1110
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:10,288
You know, like: needles, pins;
when a man marries, trouble begins.

1111
01:36:10,461 --> 01:36:12,538
You ready?

1112
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:18,214
Well, come on! I thought you wanted
to play doctor, so let's play!

1113
01:36:19,554 --> 01:36:23,848
- Water.
- Bath. Soap. Cleanse.

1114
01:36:24,017 --> 01:36:25,926
Pure. Made pure for me.

1115
01:36:26,103 --> 01:36:29,721
"And his tears
shall wash away thy sins

1116
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:31,690
and make thee over again."

1117
01:36:32,235 --> 01:36:35,069
Baptists. Mother used to take me
to church. Twice on Sundays.

1118
01:36:38,073 --> 01:36:40,826
There. I'm not holding back
at all, am I?

1119
01:36:40,993 --> 01:36:43,401
You're bringing me out
marvellously, Doctor.

1120
01:36:43,579 --> 01:36:47,623
You'll have me up on my poor paralysed
little legs by the next scene. Go on.

1121
01:36:49,126 --> 01:36:52,163
- Air.
- Stare.

1122
01:36:52,338 --> 01:36:54,414
And that's what you do.

1123
01:36:56,134 --> 01:36:59,799
Stare and blare and say you care,
but you're unfair, you want a pair.

1124
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:03,718
- Sex.
- Masculine, Feminine,

1125
01:37:03,892 --> 01:37:05,220
Adam and Eve, Jack and Jill.

1126
01:37:05,393 --> 01:37:08,181
I'll slap your filthy face
if you come near me again, Jack!

1127
01:37:08,354 --> 01:37:12,683
- Death.
- Me. Oh, listen, Mark -

1128
01:37:12,859 --> 01:37:14,104
- Needles.
- Pins.

1129
01:37:14,277 --> 01:37:15,356
- Black
- White

1130
01:37:15,654 --> 01:37:18,191
- Red!
- White. White!

1131
01:37:18,657 --> 01:37:23,118
It's alright, Marnie.
Darling, come here.

1132
01:37:23,287 --> 01:37:26,620
I won't let anything bad
happen to you. You're alright.

1133
01:37:27,457 --> 01:37:30,743
- You're alright.
- Oh, help me!

1134
01:37:31,586 --> 01:37:35,750
Help me. Oh, God,
somebody help me!

1135

(Butler) What name, sir?

1140
01:38:27,561 --> 01:38:30,514
- Strutt.
- (Butler) Mr and Mrs Strutt.

1141
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:34,058
Mr Strutt, Mrs Strutt? How do you do?

1142
01:38:34,234 --> 01:38:35,515
I'm Lil Mainwaring,
Mark's sister-in-law.

1143
01:38:35,693 --> 01:38:38,529
- So good of you to come all this way.
- So nice of you to ask us.

1144
01:38:38,822 --> 01:38:42,867
Wait till tomorrow, Charlie.
Wait till you see her on a horse, eh?

1145
01:38:45,412 --> 01:38:48,579
- I'm not a bit nervous, Mark.
- You have no reason to be.

1146
01:38:48,915 --> 01:38:53,043
You're unquestionably
the best-looking woman here.

1147
01:38:53,211 --> 01:38:56,166
The best-dressed. The most intelligent.
And you're with me.

1148
01:38:58,592 --> 01:39:01,083
- I think everyone's here.
- Well, Lil's scorekeeper.

1149
01:39:01,262 --> 01:39:03,966
She has the list, made the table
arrangements and everything.

1150
01:39:04,139 --> 01:39:06,465
I'm afraid I wasn't much help,
but I'll do better next time.

1151
01:39:06,642 --> 01:39:08,682
You're doing well enough.

1152
01:39:08,853 --> 01:39:13,432
I suppose we should keep... circulating.

1153
01:39:20,282 --> 01:39:22,358
Why?

1154
01:39:22,616 --> 01:39:25,783
- Why?
- I don't know. I swear I don't know.

1155
01:39:26,496 --> 01:39:29,580
He wasn't invited here.
He's never been invited here.

1156
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:32,578
- It's Lil!
- Lil?

1157
01:39:33,003 --> 01:39:35,873
- She doesn't even know Strutt.
- It's Lil!

1158
01:39:36,047 --> 01:39:38,621
Get me out of here please.

1159
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,627
It's too late. Here they come.

1160
01:39:40,802 --> 01:39:43,091
Look, call his bluff. I'll back you up.

1161
01:39:43,972 --> 01:39:47,590
- Oh, hello, Strutt. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1162
01:39:47,767 --> 01:39:50,555
- We haven't met. I am Mark Rutland.
- How do you do?

1163
01:39:50,729 --> 01:39:53,101
- And this is my wife.
- How do you do?

1164
01:39:53,607 --> 01:39:56,277
Well, this is a surprise.
I hadn't heard about your marriage.

1165
01:39:56,443 --> 01:39:59,480
You know, we all think
a great deal of your husband.

1166
01:40:02,074 --> 01:40:06,451
We've been doing business with
the Rutlands... for a long time.

1167
01:40:11,542 --> 01:40:15,670
- I believe we've met before.
- I don't think so.

1168
01:40:18,298 --> 01:40:22,297
Think again... Mrs Rutland.

1169
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:24,261
Are you just recently married?

1170
01:40:25,139 --> 01:40:27,297
Marnie and I have been married
for two months.

1171
01:40:27,475 --> 01:40:29,764
But we've known each other
quite well for four years.

1172
01:40:29,936 --> 01:40:32,605
Four years? Before Estelle...

1173
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:34,189
Yes, didn't you know?

1174
01:40:38,444 --> 01:40:40,733
Darling, Betty seems
rather stranded over there.

1175
01:40:40,906 --> 01:40:43,740
You'll have to excuse us for a few
moments, Mrs Strutt.

1176
01:40:43,908 --> 01:40:45,532
Oh, and Lil, would you see that

1177
01:40:45,701 --> 01:40:48,027
Mr and Mrs Strutt's glasses
are kept brimming?

1178
01:40:48,204 --> 01:40:49,403
That's a good girl.

1179
01:40:49,581 --> 01:40:52,617
- I'm going to be sick.
- You're not going to be sick.

1180
01:40:52,793 --> 01:40:55,200
You said we'd known each other
four years. Lil thought -

1181
01:40:55,378 --> 01:40:58,545
I don't give one infinitesimal damn
what Lil thought or thinks.

1182
01:40:58,715 --> 01:41:00,174
- Dinner is ready, sir.
- Good. Announce it.

1183
01:41:02,469 --> 01:41:04,508
Dinner is served.

1184
01:41:07,182 --> 01:41:10,551
Mr Strutt, my wife's taken a fancy
to you. Will you see her into dinner?

1185
01:41:22,906 --> 01:41:26,358
Five minutes! I'm five minutes behind
you, and in those five minutes

1186
01:41:26,535 --> 01:41:29,108
you've got yourself up like a cat
burglar and packed for a world cruise.

1187
01:41:29,622 --> 01:41:31,448
I've got to get out of here,
and you've got to let me go.

1188
01:41:31,623 --> 01:41:34,031
That man is going to send me to jail.
You know he is!

1189
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:36,167
What are you using
for guts this season?

1190
01:41:36,337 --> 01:41:37,416
Don't you understand?

1191
01:41:37,588 --> 01:41:39,581
He's coming back here tomorrow
and he's coming for my head!

1192
01:41:39,757 --> 01:41:41,833
We just won't give it to him.

1193
01:41:41,926 --> 01:41:44,880
Strutt may be throbbing away
with vengeful fantasies,

1194
01:41:45,054 --> 01:41:48,221
but the fact is he's a businessman,
he's in the business of doing business.

1195
01:41:48,391 --> 01:41:50,549
- So?
- So we try to do business.

1196
01:41:50,727 --> 01:41:52,636
The Rutland account
is one of the biggest he's got.

1197
01:41:52,812 --> 01:41:56,762
If he insists on acting like the swine
he is, then... and he'll lose others too.

1198
01:41:56,941 --> 01:41:59,693
I'll see to it, but first I'll see to
it that he understands I'll see to it.

1199
01:41:59,861 --> 01:42:03,146
You can keep him from prosecuting,
you can't keep him from talking.

1200
01:42:03,323 --> 01:42:06,075
I don't care if he outtalks every
Southern senator on Capitol Hill.

1201
01:42:06,242 --> 01:42:07,440
Well, I do. I care.

1202
01:42:07,619 --> 01:42:10,822
Darling, didn't your mother
ever tell you about sticks and stones?

1203
01:42:10,997 --> 01:42:14,947
Can't you understand there may be
other... things involved,

1204
01:42:15,126 --> 01:42:17,415
other people that I don't
want to hear about me?

1205
01:42:17,587 --> 01:42:18,667
Yes, I can understand,

1206
01:42:18,839 --> 01:42:22,587
but since you're the well-known
orphan child, who's to care?

1207
01:42:22,759 --> 01:42:24,218
The police, damn you.

1208
01:42:24,386 --> 01:42:26,923
What can the police do if we can stop
Strutt from prosecuting?

1209
01:42:27,138 --> 01:42:31,219
They can start investigating
other jobs. Other similar jobs.

1210
01:42:37,024 --> 01:42:39,063
- Well, that's something else again.
- Yes, it is.

1211
01:42:39,568 --> 01:42:41,894
How many? How many other jobs?

1212
01:42:45,032 --> 01:42:47,701
Tell me the truth, damn it! You've
nothing to gain by lying to me now!

1213
01:42:47,868 --> 01:42:49,991
- How many jobs have you pulled?
- Three.

1214
01:42:51,789 --> 01:42:55,656
- Try again.
- Four. Five counting Strutt.

1215
01:42:56,627 --> 01:42:58,502
Over how long a period?

1216
01:42:58,671 --> 01:43:00,747
Five years,
and that's the truth, I swear!

1217
01:43:01,966 --> 01:43:05,881
- Alright. How much? How much?
- Under $50,000.

1218
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:08,513
What towns?

1219
01:43:08,681 --> 01:43:11,848
Buffalo, Detroit, Elizabeth, New Jersey
and New York.

1220
01:43:12,018 --> 01:43:14,426
Well, in New York and Philadelphia,

1221
01:43:14,604 --> 01:43:17,355
I ' ll be poor old Mark Rutland who lost
his head over a pretty girl.

1222
01:43:17,523 --> 01:43:20,145
In the others I'm just
an accessory after the fact

1223
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:21,978
and equally liable under the law.

1224
01:43:22,153 --> 01:43:24,940
Well, then let me go! They can't
blame you because you didn't know!

1225
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:28,151
After you found out, I ran away.
Just let me go!

1226
01:43:28,326 --> 01:43:30,485
If I let you run out now,
nothing could keep the lid on it.

1227
01:43:30,662 --> 01:43:33,996
They've got your real name. They'll
work up a complete dossier on you.

1228
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:35,624
When they finally catch you,
and they will catch you,

1229
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,536
they'll throw the
New York City Library at you.

1230
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:41,083
But, suppose we don't lose our heads?

1231
01:43:41,256 --> 01:43:44,921
All we've got to fight is Strutt's
big mouth. That gives us time.

1232
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:49,136
Sit down. Listen.
We can do one of two things.

1233
01:43:49,306 --> 01:43:52,260
We can hire a lawyer
and a psychiatrist,

1234
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:55,969
and make an immediate voluntary
confession and an offer of restitution.

1235
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:57,392
That'll make the whole thing public.

1236
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:01,517
But the chances are very good
that you'll get a suspended sentence.

1237
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:03,853
Now the alternative.

1238
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:07,031
We can go together and make private
calls on all the places you've robbed.

1239
01:44:07,533 --> 01:44:11,744
You'll express deep sorrow
and repentance,

1240
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:13,455
sincere and vocal contrition.

1241
01:44:13,748 --> 01:44:16,784
And while you sob, I show a check
for the amount stolen.

1242
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:19,748
Press it into their hands

1243
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:22,590
and ask as a special favour
to a distraught husband,

1244
01:44:22,757 --> 01:44:25,165
to withdraw the charge.
But if one of them says,

1245
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:27,419
"Thanks, I'll take the money,
but I won't drop the charge, "

1246
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:28,627
then we've had it.

1247
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:31,885
After that it's an open court case,
and very probable sentence.

1248
01:44:34,978 --> 01:44:37,978
On the other hand, with a bit of luck
we might pull it off.

1249
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:40,140
Think it over.

1250
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:43,725
It's late. You better get some sleep.
You gotta be up for the hunt.

1251
01:44:43,904 --> 01:44:46,360
You don't expect me
to ride in the hunt!

1252
01:44:46,531 --> 01:44:48,073
Certainly I expect you to ride.

1253
01:44:48,241 --> 01:44:50,910
For one thing, I want you out of
the house when Strutt comes here.

1254
01:44:51,369 --> 01:44:53,077
For another, I don't want
to give Lil the satisfaction

1255
01:44:53,246 --> 01:44:54,741
of seeing you chicken.

1256
01:44:55,457 --> 01:44:59,372
And, Marnie,
tonight the door stays open.

1257
01:45:06,552 --> 01:45:08,177
(Dogs Barking)

1258
01:45:49,304 --> 01:45:51,546
(Indistinct Chatter, Laughter)

1259
01:47:28,572 --> 01:47:31,194
(Screams)

1260
01:47:32,534 --> 01:47:34,942
(Whinnies)

1261
01:47:35,871 --> 01:47:37,698
(Screams)

1262
01:47:57,018 --> 01:47:59,176
Forio!

1263
01:48:03,817 --> 01:48:05,893
(Whinnies)

1264
01:48:21,584 --> 01:48:25,583
A gun! Give me a gun!
My horse is screaming!

1265
01:48:25,756 --> 01:48:29,171
- Get me a gun!
- You want to shoot your horse?

1266
01:48:29,342 --> 01:48:31,667
Hey, wait a minute!

1267
01:48:31,845 --> 01:48:36,306
I can't give you a gun, my mister
isn't home. I don't know what he'd -

1268
01:48:36,475 --> 01:48:39,012
You must be crazy!

1269
01:48:39,185 --> 01:48:41,759
Mrs Turpin!

1270
01:48:41,939 --> 01:48:44,690
Miss Mainwaring,
this woman comes tearing in here

1271
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:46,269
demandin' I give her a gun.

1272
01:48:46,444 --> 01:48:49,813
Tell this fool to give me a gun.
Forio's hurt!

1273
01:48:49,988 --> 01:48:53,737
Marnie, wait. I ' ll call a vet.
There's nothing a vet can do.

1274
01:48:53,909 --> 01:48:56,151
We don't have a phone
anyway, Miss Mainwaring.

1275
01:48:56,329 --> 01:48:59,697
If the horse is hurt bad,
I could give her Jack's pistol.

1276
01:48:59,873 --> 01:49:02,162
Hurry. Oh, hurry, please.
He's suffering.

1277
01:49:02,334 --> 01:49:04,243
Go get the gun!

1278
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:06,709
I'll do it, Marnie. You wait here.

1279
01:49:06,881 --> 01:49:09,372
Are you still in the mood for killing?

1280
01:49:11,469 --> 01:49:13,296
Please, Marnie!

1281
01:49:13,471 --> 01:49:16,341
Stay out of my way!

1282
01:49:19,811 --> 01:49:21,850
Marnie, please!

1283
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:23,350
If you don't want me to do it,

1284
01:49:23,523 --> 01:49:26,144
then let me go back
for one of the men.

1285
01:49:26,317 --> 01:49:28,476
(Whinnies)

1286
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:46,795
There.

1287
01:49:46,963 --> 01:49:49,205
There now.

1288
01:49:54,596 --> 01:49:59,508
So you can see, Mr Strutt,
how very disadvantageous,

1289
01:49:59,684 --> 01:50:02,639
any action on your part
would be for everyone.

1290
01:50:03,313 --> 01:50:06,019
For me, certainly.

1291
01:50:06,192 --> 01:50:08,979
For a sick girl... and for you.

1292
01:50:09,903 --> 01:50:12,904
Yes, I'm sure that's the fashionable
attitude, Mr Rutland.

1293
01:50:13,073 --> 01:50:16,276
But just wait until
you've been victimised.

1294
01:50:23,292 --> 01:50:27,586
(Mark) Try to look at the situation
from a business point of view.

1295
01:50:27,755 --> 01:50:29,795
(Strutt) Yes.

1296
01:50:29,966 --> 01:50:35,043
(Mark) We've been business friends
for a number of years now.

1297
01:50:35,221 --> 01:50:37,380
(Continues Indistinct)

1298
01:51:38,661 --> 01:51:42,445
(Mark) I want you to apply
them all for my benefit.

1299
01:51:42,623 --> 01:51:44,616
(Strutt) Hm.

1300
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:51,632
- (Phone Ringing)
- Oh, sorry.

1301
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,757
Hello.

1302
01:51:53,927 --> 01:51:56,169
Yes, Lil, what is it?

1303
01:52:00,141 --> 01:52:02,679
Yes, I understand.
I'm hanging up now.

1304
01:52:02,853 --> 01:52:06,601
You'll have to forgive me, I've had
a bit of trouble at the hunt.

1305
01:52:06,773 --> 01:52:10,817
I'll talk to you again, possibly
tomorrow. I'm sorry to run out.

1306
01:53:41,745 --> 01:53:44,201
(Mark)
I'll take you home, Marnie.

1307
01:53:49,837 --> 01:53:51,996
It's alright, darling.

1308
01:53:57,886 --> 01:54:00,259
You're just exhausted.
Now, don't panic.

1309
01:54:04,351 --> 01:54:07,471
I've spoken to Strutt. I think
I'll be able to talk him around.

1310
01:54:16,238 --> 01:54:19,690
I'll just put this away.

1311
01:54:45,894 --> 01:54:48,468
Go on. You want the money.

1312
01:54:48,647 --> 01:54:51,268
You wanted the money, or you wouldn't
have taken my keys, would you?

1313
01:54:51,441 --> 01:54:53,517
You took the keys,
now take the money!

1314
01:54:53,694 --> 01:54:55,770
I said take it!

1315
01:55:00,325 --> 01:55:03,611
What's mine belongs to you.
It's yours!

1316
01:55:03,788 --> 01:55:05,697
You're not stealing.

1317
01:55:05,873 --> 01:55:08,577
You want the money, take it.
I said take it!

1318
01:55:27,687 --> 01:55:32,645
Marnie, now we're going to
Baltimore to see your mother.

1319
01:55:32,817 --> 01:55:35,391
- No!
- Yes.

1320
01:55:49,543 --> 01:55:51,868
Come on.

1321
01:55:57,342 --> 01:56:00,876
So, I knew you'd run away,
and you'd want money.

1322
01:56:01,054 --> 01:56:04,470
It didn't take me a minute to find out
the office drawer key was gone.

1323
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:10,389
If you tell my mother about me,
I'll kill you.

1324
01:56:11,649 --> 01:56:13,725
If you mean about the robberies,

1325
01:56:13,901 --> 01:56:16,736
I've no intention
of telling her anything.

1326
01:56:16,904 --> 01:56:20,071
It's your mother who's
going to do the talking.

1327
01:56:22,201 --> 01:56:24,526
(Thunderclaps)

1328
01:56:29,249 --> 01:56:31,823
Marnie, come on.

1329
01:56:32,003 --> 01:56:33,995
- No!
- Come on.

1330
01:56:51,773 --> 01:56:55,189
- It's alright, Marnie. You're inside.
- (Mama) What in the wide world -

1331
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,815
I'm sorry to crash in
on you like this, Mrs Edgar.

1332
01:56:57,987 --> 01:57:01,522
I guess you know
how Marnie feels about storms.

1333
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:05,069
Marnie, stop acting like
such a ninny.

1334
01:57:05,244 --> 01:57:08,080
Who are you, mister?
You're not Mr Pendleton.

1335
01:57:08,248 --> 01:57:10,205
No, I'm not.
Who's Mr Pendleton?

1336
01:57:10,375 --> 01:57:12,913
Then what have you got to do
with my Marnie?

1337
01:57:13,086 --> 01:57:15,708
I'm Mark Rutland,
Marnie's husband, Mrs Edgar.

1338
01:57:15,881 --> 01:57:17,708
Marnie hasn't been very well.

1339
01:57:17,883 --> 01:57:20,457
I don't believe she's been well
since your accident.

1340
01:57:20,635 --> 01:57:21,666
My what?

1341
01:57:21,845 --> 01:57:23,719
I think you've always
called it "your accident."

1342
01:57:23,888 --> 01:57:27,008
What do you think
you' re talking about?

1343
01:57:27,184 --> 01:57:30,553
Comin' into my house like this,
talking about my accident!

1344
01:57:31,897 --> 01:57:34,684
You're not married to Marnie.
I don't believe you.

1345
01:57:34,858 --> 01:57:38,144
- Marnie?
- Your daughter needs help, Mrs Edgar.

1346
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:39,981
You've got to tell her the truth.

1347
01:57:40,155 --> 01:57:42,313
She has no memory
of what happened that night.

1348
01:57:42,491 --> 01:57:46,738
And she needs to remember everything!
You must help her.

1349
01:57:46,912 --> 01:57:49,534
Mister, you must be plumb crazy.

1350
01:57:49,707 --> 01:57:53,241
If you won't tell her, I will.
I know everything that happened.

1351
01:57:53,419 --> 01:57:56,255
- I'll tell her the whole story.
- Oh, no you won't,

1352
01:57:56,423 --> 01:58:00,206
because you don't know the whole story,
and nobody does but me!

1353
01:58:00,885 --> 01:58:04,835
Oh. Well, since you're so very
knowledgeable, Mrs Edgar,

1354
01:58:05,015 --> 01:58:06,213
do you also know that your daughter,

1355
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:08,597
your beautiful, young daughter,

1356
01:58:08,768 --> 01:58:10,844
cannot stand to have a man
touch her? Any man?

1357
01:58:10,895 --> 01:58:13,053
She doesn't know why, but you do.

1358
01:58:13,356 --> 01:58:17,141
Don't you think you owe it to her to
help her to understand what happened

1359
01:58:17,318 --> 01:58:19,312
- to make her like this?
- What matters what made her?

1360
01:58:19,487 --> 01:58:23,106
She's lucky to feel like that!
Just plain lucky!

1361
01:58:24,493 --> 01:58:26,984
That's very interesting, Mrs Edgar.

1362
01:58:27,161 --> 01:58:29,237
But I've had
an investigator working here.

1363
01:58:29,330 --> 01:58:31,656
I've read the transcript. Hm?

1364
01:58:31,833 --> 01:58:34,075
The records of your trial for murder.

1365
01:58:34,253 --> 01:58:36,210
In the records
it states quite plainly

1366
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:38,586
that you made your
living from the touch of men.

1367
01:58:38,757 --> 01:58:43,834
It was one of your clients that
you killed that night.

1368
01:58:44,013 --> 01:58:46,847
Oh, God!

1369
01:58:47,015 --> 01:58:49,091
Was there also a storm
that night, Mrs Edgar?

1370
01:58:49,268 --> 01:58:51,307
Is that why Marnie's
terrified of storms?

1371
01:58:51,478 --> 01:58:53,851
Was there thunder
and lightning that night?

1372
01:58:54,023 --> 01:58:56,181
Did the storms terrify
your little girl,

1373
01:58:56,359 --> 01:58:57,936
in addition to everything
else that happened?

1374
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:01,360
Get out of my house.

1375
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:04,069
You get out!

1376
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:07,077
I don't need any filthy man
comin' in my house no more!

1377
01:59:07,245 --> 01:59:08,952
Do you hear me? You get out!

1378
01:59:10,373 --> 01:59:13,409
You get out of my house! (Screaming)

1379
01:59:13,585 --> 01:59:15,743
You get out!

1380
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:19,004
You let my mama go!

1381
01:59:19,174 --> 01:59:23,088
You hear? You let my mama go!

1382
01:59:23,261 --> 01:59:27,092
- You're hurtin' my mama!
- Who am I, Marnie?

1383
01:59:27,265 --> 01:59:32,176
- Why should I want to hurt your mama?
- You' re one of them.

1384
01:59:33,771 --> 01:59:37,021
- One of them in the white suits.
- Shut up, Marnie!

1385
01:59:37,192 --> 01:59:42,187
No! Remember, Marnie.
Tell us how it all was.

1386
01:59:43,198 --> 01:59:45,867
The white suits! Remember?

1387
01:59:48,953 --> 01:59:51,955
(Tapping)

1388
01:59:52,123 --> 01:59:54,496
What does the tapping mean, Marnie?

1389
01:59:54,668 --> 01:59:56,791
Why does it make you cry?

1390
01:59:56,962 --> 02:00:01,256
It means... they want in.

1391
02:00:01,425 --> 02:00:04,960
Them in their white suits.

1392
02:00:05,137 --> 02:00:09,301
Mama comes and gets me out of bed.

1393
02:00:09,475 --> 02:00:12,013
I don't like to get out of bed.

1394
02:00:30,412 --> 02:00:33,948
Come on, Marnie.

1395
02:00:34,125 --> 02:00:37,209
Get up. Alright?

1396
02:00:37,378 --> 02:00:40,463
Good girl.

1397
02:00:40,632 --> 02:00:43,668
That's my baby.

1398
02:00:43,843 --> 02:00:46,335
There.

1399
02:00:49,182 --> 02:00:51,720
There. Mm.

1400
02:00:51,893 --> 02:00:55,641
- You go on back to sleep, sugarpop.
- Bernice.

1401
02:01:01,612 --> 02:01:04,945
- (Thunderclap)
- (Sobbing)

1402
02:01:10,579 --> 02:01:15,241
Now, you ain't afraid of a little bit
of lightning, are you? Huh?

1403
02:01:18,003 --> 02:01:20,292
What happens next, Marnie?

1404
02:01:20,589 --> 02:01:25,832
He - He come out... to me.

1405
02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:32,345
Oh, I don't like him.
He - He smells funny.

1406
02:01:32,518 --> 02:01:35,519
Your old captain's gonna be here
all through the night.

1407
02:01:35,688 --> 02:01:37,063
There's no reason to cry.

1408
02:01:37,231 --> 02:01:39,023
I want my mama!

1409
02:01:39,191 --> 02:01:44,565
I don't want you! Let me go! Mama!

1410
02:01:44,739 --> 02:01:46,945
(Sobbing)

1411
02:01:47,116 --> 02:01:50,532
Get your damn hands off my kid!

1412
02:01:50,703 --> 02:01:53,740
What are you trying to -
What are you -

1413
02:01:58,253 --> 02:02:00,044
Mama?

1414
02:02:00,213 --> 02:02:03,748
Make him go, Mama.

1415
02:02:03,925 --> 02:02:07,460
I don't like him to kiss me.
Make him go, Mama!

1416
02:02:07,637 --> 02:02:09,926
(Marnie Screams)

1417
02:02:10,098 --> 02:02:13,134
Get your hands - Get your hands -

1418
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:16,429
There's nothing the matter
with my hands!

1419
02:02:18,274 --> 02:02:20,811
(Mark) What is it, Marnie?
What's the matter?

1420
02:02:20,984 --> 02:02:22,609
He hit my mama!

1421
02:02:22,777 --> 02:02:26,312
No! No! What's the matter with you?
You crazy or drunk?

1422
02:02:26,490 --> 02:02:30,274
Now, don't go hittin' me.
You're gonna get hit yourself.

1423
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:38,956
- (Screams)
- Oh, my leg!

1424
02:02:39,127 --> 02:02:41,085
- Mama?
- Is your mother hurt?

1425
02:02:41,254 --> 02:02:46,131
- How? How is she hurt?
- He fell on her.

1426
02:02:46,302 --> 02:02:49,219
Oh, she's so hurt! Oh, Mama.

1427
02:02:49,388 --> 02:02:52,638
Marnie! Marnie, help me!

1428
02:02:56,479 --> 02:02:58,056
I got to help my mama!

1429
02:02:58,231 --> 02:03:00,270
(Sobbing)

1430
02:03:04,153 --> 02:03:06,230
Marnie?

1431
02:03:07,824 --> 02:03:10,397
I hit him!

1432
02:03:10,577 --> 02:03:14,705
I hit him with a stick. I - I hurt him!

1433
02:03:22,714 --> 02:03:26,546
There. There now.

1434
02:03:28,261 --> 02:03:32,094
- (Screams, Sobs)
- (Screams)

1435
02:03:42,484 --> 02:03:45,853
You're alright now, darling.
You're alright.

1436
02:03:46,029 --> 02:03:48,865
It's all over.

1437
02:03:49,032 --> 02:03:50,990
You're alright.

1438
02:04:13,266 --> 02:04:16,931
I thought when she lost
her memory of that night,

1439
02:04:17,103 --> 02:04:19,475
it was a sign of God's forgiveness.

1440
02:04:19,647 --> 02:04:23,063
I thought I was being
given another chance

1441
02:04:23,234 --> 02:04:26,235
to change everything,

1442
02:04:26,404 --> 02:04:28,610
to make it all up to her.

1443
02:04:29,323 --> 02:04:31,815
I'm sorry, Mrs Edgar.

1444
02:04:31,993 --> 02:04:34,744
Truly sorry.

1445
02:04:34,913 --> 02:04:38,745
Your mother told the police that she'd
killed the sailor in self-defense.

1446
02:04:38,917 --> 02:04:42,962
They could see how bad hurt I was.
They believed me.

1447
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:47,424
And I never told anyone the truth.

1448
02:04:47,593 --> 02:04:49,466
Never.

1449
02:04:49,636 --> 02:04:52,257
Not even when they tried to take you
away from me, Marnie.

1450
02:04:52,430 --> 02:04:55,385
Not even then.

1451
02:04:56,726 --> 02:05:01,472
You must've loved me, Mama.
You must've loved me!

1452
02:05:04,401 --> 02:05:08,234
You're the only thing in
this world I ever did love.

1453
02:05:13,703 --> 02:05:18,530
It - it was just that
I was so young, Marnie.

1454
02:05:20,251 --> 02:05:23,002
I never had anything of my own.

1455
02:05:28,968 --> 02:05:31,175
You know how I got you, Marnie?

1456
02:05:36,559 --> 02:05:39,097
There was this boy.

1457
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:41,678
Billy.

1458
02:05:41,856 --> 02:05:46,317
And I wanted Billy's
basketball sweater.

1459
02:05:47,445 --> 02:05:50,316
I was 15.

1460
02:05:51,658 --> 02:05:54,612
And Billy said, if I let him,

1461
02:05:54,786 --> 02:05:57,456
I could have the sweater.

1462
02:05:58,748 --> 02:06:00,825
So I let him.

1463
02:06:04,546 --> 02:06:08,674
And then, later on when you got
started, he run away.

1464
02:06:12,095 --> 02:06:15,262
I still got that old sweater.

1465
02:06:17,226 --> 02:06:19,053
And I got you, Marnie.

1466
02:06:22,273 --> 02:06:26,982
And after the accident,
when I was in the hospital,

1467
02:06:27,152 --> 02:06:30,023
they tried to make me
let you be adopted.

1468
02:06:30,198 --> 02:06:32,569
But I wouldn't.

1469
02:06:32,741 --> 02:06:34,616
I wanted you.

1470
02:06:34,785 --> 02:06:37,193
And I promised God right then,

1471
02:06:37,371 --> 02:06:41,950
if he'd let me keep you,
and you not remember,

1472
02:06:42,127 --> 02:06:45,709
I'd bring you up different from me.

1473
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:48,003
Decent.

1474
02:06:48,174 --> 02:06:51,045
Decent?

1475
02:06:51,218 --> 02:06:53,888
Oh, Mama!

1476
02:06:55,723 --> 02:06:58,215
Well, you surely realised
your ambition.

1477
02:06:58,393 --> 02:07:01,809
I certainly am decent.

1478
02:07:03,147 --> 02:07:05,473
Of course I'm a cheat,

1479
02:07:05,650 --> 02:07:08,770
and a liar and a thief,

1480
02:07:09,863 --> 02:07:11,902
but I am decent.

1481
02:07:13,826 --> 02:07:18,867
Marnie, it's time to have a
little compassion for yourself.

1482
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:21,530
When a child,

1483
02:07:21,708 --> 02:07:25,837
a child of any age, Marnie,
can't get love,

1484
02:07:26,005 --> 02:07:29,504
it takes what it can get,
any way it can get it.

1485
02:07:29,675 --> 02:07:32,759
It's not so hard to understand.

1486
02:07:46,442 --> 02:07:50,107
Get up, Marnie, you' re aching my leg.

1487
02:08:07,088 --> 02:08:10,623
There. That's better.

1488
02:08:12,469 --> 02:08:14,711
Mark?

1489
02:08:16,806 --> 02:08:18,965
Wha - What am I going to do?

1490
02:08:19,142 --> 02:08:22,392
What's going to happen?

1491
02:08:22,563 --> 02:08:25,183
What do you want to happen?

1492
02:08:26,483 --> 02:08:30,812
I guess I... I want it all cleared up.

1493
02:08:30,988 --> 02:08:32,647
Will I -

1494
02:08:33,949 --> 02:08:36,867
Will I go to jail?

1495
02:08:37,536 --> 02:08:41,285
No. Not after what
I have to tell them.

1496
02:08:47,839 --> 02:08:49,831
We'll go now.

1497
02:08:57,223 --> 02:09:00,177
Ah, Mrs Edgar, I'll bring Marnie back.

1498
02:09:00,351 --> 02:09:03,268
She's very tired now.

1499
02:09:04,522 --> 02:09:06,598
Goodbye, Mama.

1500
02:09:08,526 --> 02:09:10,602
Goodbye.

1501
02:09:16,492 --> 02:09:18,568
Goodbye, sugarpop.

1502
02:09:32,592 --> 02:09:35,048
Oh, Mark,

1503
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:37,545
I don't want to go to jail.

1504
02:09:37,723 --> 02:09:39,549
I'd rather stay with you.

1505
02:09:39,725 --> 02:09:42,263
Had you, love?

1506
02:09:42,435 --> 02:09:45,271
(Girls) # Send for the doctor
over the hill.

1507
02:09:45,439 --> 02:09:48,226
# Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

1508
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:51,436
# Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.
