Subs by MWA

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,270
Everyone has an angel.

3
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,936
A guardian who watches over us.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,565
We can't know what form they'll take.

5
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,447
One day, old man.

6
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,697
Next day, little girl.

7
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,038
But don't let appearances fool you.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,329
They can be as fierce as any dragon.

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,625
Yet they're not here to fight our battles...

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,837
...but to whisper from our heart...

11
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,377
...reminding that it's us.

12
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:48,800
It's every one of us who holds
the power over the worlds we create.

13
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,370
No!

14
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,496
No.

15
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,233
We can deny our angels exist...

16
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,235
...convince ourselves they can't be real.

17
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,406
But they show up anyway.

18
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,612
At strange places.

19
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,198
And at strange times.

20
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,248
They can speak through any character
we can imagine.

21
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,000
They'll shout through demons
if they have to...

22
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,412
...daring us...

23
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,831
...challenging us to fight.

24
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,311
Female. Age 20.

25
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,430
- You're the father?
- Stepfather.

26
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,266
That's right. We talked on the phone.

27
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,945
Okay, come with me.

28
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,326
We're gonna take her into the theater.

29
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:28,703
Dr. Gorski's gonna want to take a look
at her. She likes to see all the new girls.

30
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:32,707
Don't worry, Dad.
Everything's gonna be fine.

31
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,839
I've got everything under control
around here.

32
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,716
Okay? Come on. Follow me.

33
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,893
So this is what we call the theater.

34
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,783
Liar!

35
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,747
Oh, girls. Yes, go, go.

36
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,583
Hey. Come here.

37
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,588
Girls. Behave.

38
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,125
- Break it up. Break it up.
- Will you stop them?

39
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,214
Lynn.

40
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,093
Amy.

41
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,723
Sit down.

42
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,928
Sit.

43
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,272
Anyway.
So the girls use this place to be social.

44
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,857
Dr. Gorski, she uses it to help them
deal with their issues.

45
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,321
Polish therapy.

46
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,319
It's quite a show, watching them act out
who touched them or beat them.

47
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,954
Dr. Gorski seems to think it helps.
I'm not so sure.

48
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,912
But whether it does or doesn't
won't matter much to you.

49
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,668
Once we take care of
a little bit of business...

50
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,376
- ...there won't be any of that for this one.
- Good.

51
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,088
She'll be in paradise,
if you know what I mean.

52
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,802
And all of your troubles will be over.
Right?

53
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,145
Now, I know we Said 1400
on the phone ....

54
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,307
I'm taking a really big risk here...

55
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,148
...so it's gonna have to be 2 grand even.

56
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,938
What the hell are you talking about?
We had a deal.

57
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:28,156
Listen, Father,
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

58
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,662
Clearly you're a man that can take
care of himself.

59
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,371
I don't know what you did to this girl.
And, frankly, I don't wanna know.

60
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,662
What are you gonna tell the detectives
when they come around?

61
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,956
They're gonna love her side of the story.

62
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,544
- Yeah.
- Okay.

63
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,548
I'm going to start your music.

64
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,845
You are safe.

65
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,722
It's all safe.

66
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,847
Now relax.

67
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,518
And just let go.

68
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,357
Now, here's the other thing:

69
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,395
I don't have a doctor on staff
who does lobotomies.

70
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,983
- What?
- But...

71
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,696
...there happens to be one scheduled
to come in in five days.

72
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,737
So I'll just forge her signature.
I've done it a dozen times.

73
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,405
It's like we talk about.

74
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,828
You control this world.

75
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,669
I told the police
she lost her mind when her mother died.

76
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,001
The truth is a little more complicated.

77
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,382
Let the pain go.

78
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,089
Let the hurt go.

79
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,422
Let the guilt go.

80
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,808
What you're imagining right now...

81
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,561
...that world you control?

82
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,814
That place can be as real as any pain.

83
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,975
I don't want her to remember a thing.

84
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:47,114
Don't worry, she won't even remember
her name when I'm done with her.

85
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,495
Stop.

86
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,169
Get that thing away from me.

87
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,374
Get it away from me.

88
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,418
Where is my mind?

89
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,924
And shut off that damn music.

90
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,544
Undo these straps.

91
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,556
Don't forget my ankles.

92
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,634
Hurry.

93
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,604
Is there a problem, Sweet Pea?

94
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,441
This is a joke, right?

95
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,066
Don't you get the point of this?

96
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,027
It's to turn people on.

97
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,692
I get the sexy little schoolgirl.

98
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,579
I even get the helpless mental patient,
right? That can be hot.

99
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,330
But what is this?

100
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,416
Lobotomized vegetable?

101
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,914
How about something a little more
commercial, for God's sakes?

102
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,380
Sweet Pea,
could you come here, please?

103
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,597
You gotta help me.

104
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,308
I'm the star of the show, remember?

105
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,598
I'll figure something out.

106
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,395
All right, ladies. Wrap it up.

107
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,311
Sweet Pea, I want you
to meet somebody. This...

108
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,569
Oh, don't tell me.

109
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,115
The priest brought you here
from the orphanage.

110
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,241
Heh, heh, heh. Yeah, that's right.

111
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,121
The High Roller is coming for her
in five days.

112
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,783
He's gonna, you know,
just do a little flower picking.

113
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,082
Can you do me a favor, honey?

114
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,499
Can you show this little baby doll around,
give her a tour of the establishment?

115
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,168
Blue, please.

116
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,930
You saw the show, okay?
I don't have the time.

117
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,597
Let my sister take her.

118
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,263
Rocket.

119
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,234
Show her around, will you, sis?

120
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,990
All right, come on. Let's go.

121
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,110
Don't worry, I don't bite very hard.

122
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,245
Goodbye, my dear.

123
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,661
- Jesus!
- Oh ....

124
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,450
You'll get what you deserve
when the High Roller comes!

125
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,335
- Calm down.
- I will not calm down.

126
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,168
- You see what she did? I hope you rot!
- I did. I'm sorry.

127
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,002
This way.

128
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:39,759
You're gonna be okay.
It just takes a little while to get used to.

129
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,300
So how'd you become an orphan?

130
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,936
Oh, I get it. It's complicated, right?

131
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,144
Well, we all have our stories in here.
Mine's...

132
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,398
...complicated.

133
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,812
These are the rooms
where we take the clients.

134
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,778
There's fresh towels
in all the bathrooms and...

135
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,155
Turn that on.

136
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,372
Blue owns the club.

137
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,379
And we, my dear, heh...

138
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,671
...are the main attractions. Ta-da.

139
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,587
The club's a front for his business.

140
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,303
Guns, gambling, medications,
special favors.

141
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,597
He brings in his clients,
and we gotta make them feel, you know...

142
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,355
...special.

143
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,019
I don't think she's a problem.

144
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,147
- She looked nice.
- She looked stuck-up to me.

145
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,108
No. She's scared.

146
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,363
I feel sorry for her.

147
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,741
Amber, you feel sorry for everyone.

148
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,779
Do you remember when you first got here?
Nobody felt sorry for you.

149
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,573
Well, don't get too attached to her, okay?

150
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,491
Blue's saving her for the High Roller.

151
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,620
She's no virgin.

152
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:59,793
Babydoll, that's Amber, Blondie,
and you've met my sister, Sweet Pea.

153
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,212
- Watch yourself.
- Come on, just give her a break.

154
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,551
Yeah, she hasn't done anything
to you guys.

155
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,387
You best friends now?

156
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,768
Will you just let me finish my tour,
please?

157
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,563
Thank you.

158
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,810
Everybody gets a dance, a routine.

159
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,571
We practice, practice, practice,
and the men come and watch us perform.

160
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,734
And if they like what they see ....

161
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:29,240
Well, that's why we dance.

162
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,522
Give me that.

163
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,577
Somebody! Help me!

164
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,673
Let her go, pig.

165
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,429
I didn't mean nothing.

166
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,202
Are you okay?

167
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,284
Yeah. Let's just go.

168
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,250
We don't wanna be late.

169
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,590
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

170
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,924
Two, two, three, four,
arms, six, seven, eight. Stop.

171
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,339
Stop.

172
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,557
Where are you right now?

173
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,186
Are you with us or not?

174
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,097
Sweet Pea, take break.

175
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,016
Yeah.

176
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,866
Babydoll.

177
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,573
Come over here.

178
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,446
Come, come.

179
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,749
Let me look at you.

180
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,919
Hm.

181
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,805
You seem fit enough.

182
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,309
I'm going to play you some music, okay?

183
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,847
I want you to just relax. Feel the music.

184
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,476
Open your heart to it. Let it in.

185
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,019
And when you are ready...

186
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,730
...I want you to dance.

187
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:04,560
If you do not dance,
you have no purpose.

188
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:09,774
And we don't keep things here
that have no purpose.

189
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:15,317
You see, your fight for survival
starts right now.

190
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,033
You don't want to be judged?
You won't be.

191
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,870
You don't think you're strong enough?
You are.

192
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,916
You're afraid. Don't be.

193
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,047
You have all the weapons you need.

194
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,549
Now fight.

195
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,130
Again.

196
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,709
Stand up

197
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:12,958
You've got to manage

198
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,194
Hello?

199
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,192
-Excuse me, could you help me? I'm...
Shoes.

200
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,828
I'm sorry?

201
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,910
Your shoes.

202
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,909
You're tracking snow everywhere.

203
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,999
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I take them off?

204
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,755
That time has passed.

205
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,000
What can I do for you?

206
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,256
Nothing. I just...

207
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,013
Let me ask it another way:

208
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,722
What are you looking for?

209
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,510
A way out, I guess.

210
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,723
You guess?

211
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,313
No, I...

212
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:53,975
I know.

213
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,068
I need to get out of here.

214
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,229
Freedom.

215
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,864
That wasn't so hard, was it?

216
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,660
I'm going to help you to be free.

217
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,035
What do I have to do?

218
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,584
These are your weapons.

219
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,966
When you take them,
you begin your journey.

220
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,045
Your journey to freedom.

221
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,361
You will need five items for this journey.

222
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,818
The first is a map.

223
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,905
Then fire, a knife and a key.

224
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,611
You said five things.

225
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,452
The fifth thing is a mystery.

226
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,084
It is the reason. It is the goal.

227
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:59,131
It will be a deep sacrifice
and a perfect victory.

228
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:06,631
Only you can find it.

229
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,929
And if you do...

230
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,724
...it will set you free.

231
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,684
Oh, and one more thing:

232
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,777
Defend yourself.

233
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,955
What was that?

234
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,917
Seriously, you're gonna have to
teach me how to dance like that.

235
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,456
That was crazy.

236
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,217
That was so amazing. I'm, like, shaking.

237
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,882
I've never seen Madame Gorski
clap like that before.

238
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,301
Well, get over it.

239
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,969
It's nearly lights out.

240
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,353
She's not easily impressed.

241
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,267
She wasn't impressed.
All that gyrating and moaning.

242
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,357
The dance should be
more than just titillation.

243
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,615
Mine's personal. It says who I am.

244
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,026
What the heck does yours say?

245
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,366
It says I'm gonna escape from here.

246
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,615
That I'm gonna be free.

247
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,792
Well, send me a postcard from paradise.

248
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,247
Are you really gonna try to escape?

249
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,625
Yeah. Before the High Roller comes.

250
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,965
- Can I come?
- Me too.

251
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,967
- Yeah, of course.
- You're not going anywhere, Rocket.

252
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,634
I'm gonna do what I wanna do.

253
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,180
No one's ever escaped from here.
You know that.

254
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,316
Yeah. You know, the last three girls
that tried died.

255
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,272
And the same thing'll happen
to the next fool.

256
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,483
Look, why don't you just
listen to my plan?

257
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,774
Don't wanna hear your plan, okay?

258
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,906
None of us do.

259
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,333
What if it's a good plan?

260
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,994
Then she can go through with it.

261
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,959
I'm not letting you get hurt.

262
00:31:55,997 --> 00:32:00,093
- I kept us safe through a lot of shit.
- I know you have.

263
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,804
I'm not gonna get hurt.

264
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,764
I just can't be here anymore.

265
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,054
And if it is a good plan,
we're both going.

266
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,439
No, we're not.

267
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,066
You're on your own.

268
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,372
- Well, I've been on my own before.
- Heh.

269
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,377
Sure you have.

270
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,418
Look where that got us.

271
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:50,553
Baby saved me from the Cook
the other day.

272
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,555
What?

273
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:59,232
I was working in the kitchen
and he comes in behind me.

274
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,240
And he pushes me down
and he gets on top of me...

275
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,571
...and I can't even move.

276
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,164
And there she was, just like that.

277
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,206
She had a knife to his throat.

278
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,959
She saved me.

279
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,738
The High Roller comes for me
in three days.

280
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,828
But I'm getting out of here
before he does.

281
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,915
So if you guys wanna come with me,
this is how I plan to do it.

282
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,585
Well?

283
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,125
Okay.

284
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,680
If we can collect all four of these items,
we can be free.

285
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,306
Okay.

286
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,967
- How do we use them?
- Wait up.

287
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,811
First things first.

288
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,348
How do you plan on
getting these things?

289
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:21,360
Well, whoever has the item we need,
we get them to watch me dance.

290
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,154
While we run around
and pick their pockets?

291
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,486
- Yeah, that's right.
- But we'd be taking all the risk.

292
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,493
We'd be doing the work
while you prance around with an alibi.

293
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,747
No. As long as I'm dancing,
they won't even know you're there.

294
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,295
Okay, so the first thing we need
is a map...

295
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,883
...to figure out where all the exits are,
where the guards are located.

296
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,840
Blue has that in his office.
It's behind his desk.

297
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,346
Right. Good.

298
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,424
Second thing we need
is something to start a fire with...

299
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,969
...as a distraction for when we escape.

300
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,729
Plus, the #re should disable
all the checkpoints.

301
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,690
And the third thing is a knife...

302
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,896
...in case we run into trouble.

303
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,607
The Cook.

304
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,524
- We can do it.
- Okay.

305
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,400
And the last thing's a key.

306
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,578
Blue wears a key around his neck.

307
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,909
What door does it open?

308
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,450
It's for all of them, I think.
It's a master key.

309
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,370
This plan is crazy.

310
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,293
There's armed guards everywhere, okay?

311
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,800
And if Blue finds out, we're dead.

312
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,304
It's not gonna be, "Oh, sorry, Blue,
we won't do it again." We'll be dead.

313
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,387
We're already dead.

314
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,232
- I'm in.
- So am I.

315
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,063
Me too.

316
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,903
All right.

317
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,905
But I'm only doing this because you
guys'd get caught without me, okay?

318
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,618
And if it gets too hairy...

319
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,746
...if I say it's over...

320
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,627
...we stop.

321
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,333
Okay.

322
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,415
Okay.

323
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,465
I'll get the map.

324
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,640
I went for a walk down the railroad track.

325
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,680
Next thing you know, some...

326
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,975
- What do you want?
- She's dancing.

327
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,776
Who is dancing?

328
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,104
Your baby doll.

329
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:22,916
One pill makes you larger

330
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,589
One pill makes you larger

331
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:34,219
And one pill makes you small

332
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,147
Baby.

333
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,355
Baby.

334
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,026
He's coming.
He's gonna start the briefing.

335
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,972
All right, here's the drill:

336
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,560
The Germans are preparing a report
for the kaiser. It's a map.

337
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,391
How do we intercept it?

338
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,107
You're gonna cross no man's land,
enter the enemy trenches...

339
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,113
...and take the map from
the field commander's bunker...

340
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,400
...before the courier
can reach the zeppelin.

341
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,489
Sounds like fun.

342
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,747
Oh, and I've arranged something special
for Amber.

343
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,579
Get you out of there when you're done.

344
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,704
Let's go.

345
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,568
German doctors and engineers...

346
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:07,035
...have worked out how to return
their fallen to the front lines.

347
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:11,667
They're using steam power and clockworks
to keep them moving.

348
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,381
So don't feel bad about killing them.

349
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,092
They're already dead.

350
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,553
Remember, ladies:

351
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,638
If you don't stand for something...

352
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,307
...you'll fall for anything.

353
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,027
Oh, and one last thing:

354
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,523
Try and work together.

355
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,534
Son of a...

356
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,854
Come on, guys. The bunker's this way.

357
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,174
- Cover!
- Rocket!

358
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,881
Sweet Pea! Help!

359
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,263
Uh. Sweet Pea!

360
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,582
Rocket.

361
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,921
Are you okay?

362
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,723
It's right here.

363
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,462
Rocket. That's enough.

364
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,766
Wow.

365
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,980
- Very good.
- Hm.

366
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,857
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

367
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:38,108
Very good.

368
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,485
Okay, this gives me an idea.

369
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,368
What about a private dance
for the Mayor.

370
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,573
What?

371
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,580
Nothing touchy-feely, just something
to get him wound up.

372
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,412
Get him ready to spend some money.

373
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,702
All she has to do
is do what she did just now.

374
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,832
That is out of the question.
She is not ready. It is too raw.

375
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,545
Did you just say she's not ready?

376
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,836
She doesn't have a costume.
There is no set.

377
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,757
Honey, she doesn't need that bullshit.
She's perfect.

378
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:13,060
Perhaps. But that is not for you to decide,
that is for me to decide.

379
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,266
Oh.

380
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:19,559
It's my show, and I say she's not ready.

381
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,897
Clearly, I've offended you,
and I apologize.

382
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,565
Thank you.

383
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,199
Here's the thing:

384
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,611
This show might be yours...

385
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:34,157
...but the girls and you...

386
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,993
...are mine.

387
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,129
Right?

388
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,674
You're mine.

389
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:48,171
And if you need a stronger reminder of that,
you let me know, okay?

390
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:50,969
That won't be necessary.

391
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:55,307
So with or without your blessing,
she's gonna be on that stage tomorrow?

392
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:00,145
- I'll see what I can do.
- Attagirl.

393
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,479
- Mm-hm.
- All right.

394
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:04,191
You look fantastic, by the way.

395
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,489
Big show, girls.

396
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,159
Thank you.

397
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,699
- For what?
- The Cook.

398
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,208
- It was nothing.
- Shut up.

399
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,501
No one takes a risk for anyone in here.

400
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,087
So thank you.

401
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,296
You're welcome.

402
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,962
You got family?

403
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,677
No.

404
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,637
Oh, that's right.

405
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,973
I forgot, you're an orphan.

406
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,354
I ran away from mine.

407
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,851
I thought I was pretty smart
at the time, but ....

408
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,520
Sweet Pea followed.

409
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:50,859
Which is crazy, because she never even
had a real problem with Mom and Dad.

410
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,403
She just cares about you a lot.

411
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,580
Have you just ever wanted
to just take something back?

412
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,041
You know, something you said.

413
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,546
Something you did.

414
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,881
All the time.

415
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,104
Amber?

416
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,813
The Mayor comes tonight.

417
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,946
I've never seen him without
a big stogie in his mouth.

418
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:15,155
Ugh. I hate those cigars.
I can never get that stink out of my hair.

419
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,789
- What?
- It's you.

420
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,459
- You have to get his lighter.
- I'm not doing that.

421
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,585
- I can't_
- Yes, you can.

422
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,291
Come on, be reasonable.

423
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,458
There's got to be another way,
or someone else who can do it.

424
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,253
He's your client.

425
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,180
Yeah, but what if I screw it up?

426
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:38,970
You can do this.

427
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:44,810
Well, he keeps it here, you know.
In his breast pocket.

428
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,647
So then you do the good old
kiss-the-neck...

429
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,356
...rub-his-chest...

430
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,771
...reach in...

431
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,359
...and bam...

432
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,240
...you're gold.

433
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,243
Yeah.

434
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,245
Kiss the neck.

435
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,410
- He'll like that.
- Heh, heh.

436
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,937
Gentlemen. Welcome.

437
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:16,239
We have a new girl for you tonight.
Something extra special.

438
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,241
It is a work-in-progress...

439
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:24,155
...so I apologize in advance
for the raw nature of the performance.

440
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,789
I will say, however...

441
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,460
...that is part of the charm.

442
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,956
It is my pleasure to introduce to you...

443
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,924
...this little baby doll.

444
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,298
Okay. This is how it's gonna go.

445
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,963
Amber will keep the bird on station.

446
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,475
Blondie, you'll operate the 50 cal here
and the 30 down there.

447
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:32,895
The rest of you, drop into the courtyard
and kill the creatures in your way.

448
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:37,357
Now, when you reach the nest,
you'll find the baby.

449
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,271
You'll have to slit its throat.

450
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,276
Down inside its neck are two crystals...

451
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:48,664
_"that, when struck together, produce
the most magnificent fire you'll ever see.

452
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,166
Amber...

453
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:53,915
...put us on approach.

454
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,001
Roger that. Starting my run.

455
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,190
Nice.

456
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,026
Remember:

457
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,900
Don't ever write a check with your mouth
you can't cash with your ass.

458
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,366
Oh, yeah, and one more thing.

459
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,786
Don't wake the mother.

460
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,390
Here we go, ladies.

461
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:58,192
Go! Go! Go!

462
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,566
Whoa!

463
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,193
To the castle!

464
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,990
I got an idea.

465
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,658
Hold on!

466
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,549
Take that, you ugly mother.

467
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,262
Amber, where is she?

468
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,930
Check our 6. I don't see hen

469
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:51,269
Blondie, keep your eyes peeled.

470
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,129
I'll kill yo...

471
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:23,884
She's all yours, Baby.

472
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,485
I can't believe I did it.

473
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,646
Damn, that girl can dance.

474
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,032
See what you can do?

475
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,985
Wow, Amber.

476
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,237
Check it out.

477
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,371
- Halfway home.
- Yeah.

478
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,999
Let me see it.

479
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,370
Oh.

480
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:18,507
You kiss the neck, it works every time.

481
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,177
- Good job.
- How'd we do?

482
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,505
Nice. Here.

483
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,018
- And he didn't even notice.
- No. No idea.

484
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,902
Good work, Amber.

485
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,648
- Thanks, Baby.
- Cheers.

486
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:45,158
- Cheers.
- Cheers?

487
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,194
What are we celebrating?

488
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:48,741
Huh?

489
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,614
Who should I be congratulating?

490
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,500
It was just Babydoll's first time
on stage.

491
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,206
You know how scary that can be.

492
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,003
Yeah.

493
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,582
The bond of the theater.

494
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,544
Hm?

495
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,721
I mean, what else could it be?

496
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:13,429
I mean, it's not like any of you
have anything to hide, is it?

497
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,020
No.

498
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,857
It's not like anyone was in my office...

499
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,978
...messing with my shit.

500
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:25,111
No. It's not like people
are missing things.

501
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:29,244
You know, small little objects
here and there.

502
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:34,203
No. No, that would be outrageous.
That would be crazy.

503
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,582
Right?

504
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:40,168
Because we have such an obvious
explanation for this exuberance.

505
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,833
It's the fraternity of performers.

506
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:47,926
It's the adrenaline from
the curtain rising.

507
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,136
Maybe this is my fault.

508
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:54,724
You Know, maybe I've just become
too familiar with you girls.

509
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:57,056
Maybe I need to make an example
of someone.

510
01:06:57,222 --> 01:07:00,647
Re-establish the parameters
of our relationship. What do you think?

511
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,607
Blondie, girls?

512
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:08,988
And what about you?

513
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:10,952
Huh?

514
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,663
Oh.

515
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,499
You think you're special, don't you?

516
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:20,788
Well, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

517
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:26,134
If I was not about to make a small fortune
on you with the High Roller...

518
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,087
...I would...

519
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,972
It saddens me that I have to
resort to threats with you girls.

520
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,139
I thought we were past that.

521
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,485
I just... I need this bullshit to stop!

522
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,232
Out of mutual respect.

523
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:53,029
Let's get things back to how they were.

524
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,257
Well ....

525
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,174
So much for that little experiment.

526
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,056
What are you saying?

527
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,013
I'm saying it's over.

528
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,553
Right, Baby?

529
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,346
I don't know.

530
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,690
What do you mean, you don't know?

531
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:24,855
Blue's onto us.

532
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,356
We had a deal.

533
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,692
If I say it's over, it's over.

534
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:31,028
We're this close, though.
We can't just stop.

535
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:35,195
Did you not hear Blue?
He knows we're up to something.

536
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,578
He knows what we're doing.

537
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:39,992
If he catches us for real,
it won't be a lecture. You saw him.

538
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,038
Sweet Pea. Rocket is right.
The High Roller comes tomorrow.

539
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:47,582
- If we can just stick with the plan till then...
- No! You're screwed.

540
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,836
We're out.

541
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,218
Rocket...

542
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,885
...we're out.

543
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,221
I'm finishing this.

544
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,098
We are all finishing this.

545
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,439
You know it's the only way
we can get out of here.

546
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,575
You're gonna choose her...

547
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,574
...someone you barely know...

548
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,454
...over me?

549
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,911
After all I've sacrificed for you.

550
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:25,253
I'm sorry.

551
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,292
Blondie?

552
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,086
What are you doing down there?
Are you all right?

553
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:16,470
I'm sorry, it's nothing.

554
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,848
What? What's wrong?
Did someone hurt you?

555
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:22,761
- No, it's not like that. It's really nothing.
- Clearly...

556
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,475
...it is not nothing.

557
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:27,849
Hey.

558
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:32,521
You can tell me. I am good listener.

559
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,444
Madame Gorski...

560
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,237
...please.

561
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,277
I know that look.

562
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:43,414
You think you're all alone,
and that no one can help you.

563
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,747
There is a way to fix anything.

564
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,045
Now...

565
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,040
...tell me what is wrong, child.

566
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:56,836
Okay.

567
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,929
Promise you can keep a secret?

568
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,593
- Yes.
- Yes.

569
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,872
- Where the hell is she?
- I don't know.

570
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,125
We need your music.

571
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:34,131
You know what, forget it.
No, it's too late. Sweet Pea was right.

572
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,386
What are you talking about?
The three of us, we can...

573
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,217
I don't think we can do this.

574
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:44,517
I don't wanna do something stupid
that's gonna put you guys in danger.

575
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,560
I'm sorry.

576
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,894
Hey, we got this far, right?

577
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,897
I mean, that's something
not a lot of people could have done.

578
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:59,156
How bad can the High Roller be,
anyway?

579
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,708
Don't you girls have some work
you should be doing?

580
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,582
- You came to help us.
- No.

581
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,668
I came to keep you
from getting killed.

582
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,290
Thank you.

583
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,004
We don't have a lot of time.

584
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,091
If you're done with the pleasantries,
you got a dance to do.

585
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,928
Amber, radio.

586
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,205
What the hell are you doing?

587
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,553
You're gonna wanna watch this.

588
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,072
Turn off your mind

589
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:29,739
Relax and float downstream

590
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,994
It is not dying

591
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:38,335
It is not dying

592
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,883
Lay down all thought

593
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:44,467
Surrender to the void

594
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:49,017
It is shining

595
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,645
It is shining

596
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:04,277
Ladies, this is what's on
our dance card for tonight.

597
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,411
The bomb, code-named "Kitchen Knife,"
is on a hijacked train.

598
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:11,413
It is protected by a couple dozen
mechanized gunmen.

599
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,206
The idea is simple:

600
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:18,167
Take care of the gunmen,
deactivate the bomb, then steal it.

601
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:22,709
The code numbers for the bomb and the
jetpacks for your escape are in that duffel.

602
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,218
Got it.

603
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,379
Sweet Pea.

604
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,718
I'm glad you changed your mind.

605
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:37,724
Well, there you have it.

606
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,815
You know, for those who fight for it...

607
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:46,404
...life has a flavor the sheltered
will never know.

608
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,911
Oh, yeah. One last thing.

609
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:54,457
The bomb's timer is set to detonate
when it reaches the city.

610
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:58,745
So if I were you, I'd hurry!

611
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,703
Weapons hot, ladies.

612
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:38,617
Hot.

613
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,536
- Hot.
- Hot.

614
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,921
I've got a lock.

615
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:01,690
Good luck.

616
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,994
- We're down.
- Copy that.

617
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,490
Weapon will activate in four minutes,
75 seconds.

618
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,038
Codes!

619
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:11,172
Weapon will activate
in four minutes, 10 seconds.

620
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:17,053
Weapon will activate
in four minutes, five seconds.

621
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:23,430
A deactivation procedure
has been initiated.

622
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,435
Deactivation procedure complete.

623
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,020
Weapon deactivated.

624
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:39,446
Whoa!

625
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:56,922
Hurry, Amber.
We gotta get this thing out of here.

626
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,798
On my way.

627
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,058
Please refer to the operations manual.

628
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,226
For details on ....

629
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,239
Amber, she's good.

630
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,445
I 'm taking her out.

631
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,579
Guys, it's caught on something.

632
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,999
Hold up. We missed one.

633
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,450
Override procedures complete.

634
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,952
Weapon active.

635
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:11,702
Proximity warning.

636
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:17,048
Proximity warning.

637
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,883
Amber, the bomb's active.

638
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:05,213
Weapon will activate in 45 seconds.

639
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,722
Get free.

640
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,060
Whoa!

641
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,062
- Rocket, let's go.
- Warning:

642
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,519
Weapon will activate in 25 seconds.

643
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,185
It's broke. It's not gonna work.

644
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:22,525
I'm on full burn. We'll go together.

645
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,656
It's not gonna carry the both of us.

646
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,568
- We have to try.
- Okay, we'll try.

647
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,736
But you've gotta promise me two things.

648
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,371
Rocket, let's go.

649
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,329
- The first thing is...
- Weapon will activate in 15 seconds.

650
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,834
...don't get mad about this.

651
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:37,666
About what?

652
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,626
This.

653
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:45,382
Rocket!

654
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:03,150
Weapon will activate in 10, nine...

655
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:08,113
_"eight, seven, six...

656
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:11,404
...five, four...

657
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:16,326
...three, two, one.

658
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,158
The second thing is...

659
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,792
...when you get home...

660
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,455
...when you get free...

661
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,507
...you tell Mom I love her.

662
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,597
- I'll tell her.
- Mom.

663
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,383
I promise.

664
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:34,032
Oh, my.

665
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,869
You, what did you do?
You simple, inbred idiot.

666
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,329
Sir, don't know what happened. I just...

667
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,335
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

668
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,838
Get her up. Get her up, CJ!

669
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:48,883
Yes. Yeah, look.

670
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,090
I want you to look at what you did.

671
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:54,427
Look at what you did, you bitch!

672
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:56,516
Amber, sweetheart.

673
01:24:56,675 --> 01:25:00,100
You've got Sweet Pea's slot
in tonight's show. Go get ready.

674
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:04,687
Go get ready.

675
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,444
Go!

676
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,533
Take her to the closet.

677
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:18,785
As for you...

678
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,080
...it's Showtime.

679
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:46,017
The High Roller is here.
I need you to focus for me.

680
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:48,311
Ah. Thank you.

681
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,109
Girls?

682
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:57,244
Can you just gather around for a second?
I wanna say a few words.

683
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:02,203
That's all right.
You can just finish getting her dressed.

684
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,122
Okay. There we go.

685
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,128
Very nice.

686
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,423
All right.

687
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:16,798
I try to give you all...

688
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:19,091
...a good life.

689
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,477
I try. I do.

690
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:27,103
And all I ask for in return is just for...

691
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,272
...respect...

692
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,983
...honesty.

693
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,897
You know... Oh, that's okay, Margaret.

694
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:36,988
A give-and-take relationship.

695
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:40,453
But it's Come to my attention...
It's come to our attention...

696
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:43,991
...that a few bad eggs...

697
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:46,080
...led by one little egg in particular...

698
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:51,374
...have spit in the face
of that generosity...

699
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:55,295
...and are plotting against me.

700
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:57,554
Me.

701
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,049
Your friend.

702
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,634
Your protector.

703
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,729
Your employer.

704
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:10,894
Plotting to take from me
my most precious possessions.

705
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:12,402
Blue, what you doing?

706
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:16,156
- Hm?
- You got the information. You have won.

707
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,326
This little fantasy of freedom
is all they have.

708
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:23,910
No, no, no. No one's buying that,
honey. No one's buying that, Vera.

709
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,084
There is nothing you can do to...

710
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:30,663
- Unh.
- You listen to me, you old whore.

711
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:35,505
It's too late to play the good guy.
It's far too late.

712
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:39,968
You're suddenly not aware
of what it is we do here?

713
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:45,227
I teach them to survive you.

714
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:51,187
- All right.
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean to say anything.

715
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:52,350
I'm sorry.

716
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,190
No, Blondie.

717
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,650
I didn't mean to.

718
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,528
He said everything would be okay.

719
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,573
Blue, this is a mistake.

720
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,157
Please don't do this, okay?

721
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:07,041
That's right.
Our dear Blondie came to us...

722
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,544
...desperately trying to help her sisters
off this most dangerous path.

723
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,545
At first, we didn't even believe her.

724
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:17,801
But after hearing who was involved,
frankly, it started to make sense.

725
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,470
Right here?
Blue.

726
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:26,101
Uh-huh. "Map. Fire."

727
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:32,520
Looks like that chicken was counted
a little before it hatched.

728
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:36,236
Ain't that right, Amber?

729
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,568
You have anything to say? Anything?

730
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:46,572
Blue, we didn't... We were still...

731
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,365
You know what, sweetheart?

732
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,079
It's okay.

733
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,043
It's okay.

734
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:56,748
No!

735
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:58,588
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, calm down.

736
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:02,425
This will all be over soon
and we can get back to business as usual.

737
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:05,181
Blondie, I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

738
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,637
I am so sorry.

739
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,020
The thing is, we hate snitches, so ....

740
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:15,100
No!

741
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:21,610
Okay. Here.

742
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,320
I hate guns.

743
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:26,236
I hope everyone's learned
a valuable lesson here.

744
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:30,283
Especially you, Madame Gorski.
Get her out of here.

745
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:35,295
And the rest of you, you got a show to do.
So go on, go get them, girls.

746
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,376
Make it count.

747
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:55,894
I've been thinking a lot...

748
01:29:57,475 --> 01:30:00,649
...about all that money
you're gonna make me.

749
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:03,820
And you'd think that would
give me pleasure.

750
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,077
I mean, I'm in the business of pleasure.

751
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:10,330
But you know what
it makes me feel like?

752
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:14,459
I'm gonna be honest with you.
It makes me feel like I'm this little boy...

753
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:16,746
...sitting in the corner of the sandbox...

754
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:20,462
...while everybody
gets to play with my toys...

755
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,335
...but me.

756
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,712
So you know what I'm gonna do?

757
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:29,849
I'm gonna take my toys
and I'm gonna go home.

758
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,892
Oh, is that it?!

759
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:37,190
Is that all you got?!

760
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,226
Come here!

761
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:41,315
Come on.

762
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:45,194
Did you lose your fight? Huh?

763
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:47,109
No.

764
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:50,035
I just found it.

765
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:03,212
You'll never have me.

766
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,177
Ever.

767
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:17,564
- Sweet Pea.
- Where's Amber and Blondie?

768
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,816
It's just us now.

769
01:31:20,934 --> 01:31:23,437
We have to go, Sweet Pea. Come on.

770
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:03,146
- That's it.
- Okay.

771
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:30,462
- Now what?
- Wait for it.

772
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:42,649
Come on.

773
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:07,502
Damn it.

774
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,673
This can't be.

775
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,512
We did everything right.

776
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:17,850
A map, fire, a knife, a key,
and one thing more.

777
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:19,852
One thing more.

778
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:26,685
It's me.

779
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,695
What?

780
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:31,652
Oh, it's me. Of course it's me.

781
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:34,659
It's the only way
this ever could have ended.

782
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:36,411
What do you mean?

783
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:41,244
I'm saying you go home.

784
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:44,169
Go home to your family.

785
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,539
You tell your mom what Rocket said.

786
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,587
Make her happy.

787
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,549
Go out and live a normal life...

788
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,221
...love...

789
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:57,340
...be free.

790
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,844
You have to live for all of us now.

791
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,564
- Baby, no. You can't do that.
- Yes, Sweet Pea.

792
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:06,599
You're the strongest.

793
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:09,736
You're the only one of us
that ever had a chance out there.

794
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,397
You going home and living,
that's how we win.

795
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:15,450
It's okay. It's okay. It's better this way.

796
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,162
Now listen.

797
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:21,581
I'm gonna walk out there...

798
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:25,373
...and when they come after me,
you go, okay?

799
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:27,837
There's gotta be another way.

800
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,082
No.

801
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:32,796
This is right.

802
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:37,926
This was never my story.

803
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:40,262
It's yours.

804
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:42,427
Now, don't screw it up, okay?

805
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,478
You stay off the roads
and you find a bus station, all right?

806
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,355
You're gonna be fine.

807
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:20,215
Where you going, sweetheart?

808
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:34,070
I said, where you going?

809
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:00,505
Jesus.

810
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:06,765
Did... ?

811
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:09,981
Did you see the way she looked at me?

812
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:15,270
Just in that last moment. It was like ....

813
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:25,496
Doctor?

814
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:26,869
Is it done?

815
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:30,786
Dr. Gorski, what do you know
about this one?

816
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:33,580
Uh, there was something very peculiar.

817
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:37,046
Yes. Her mother's death plunged her
into a deep depression.

818
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:41,088
And then in a fit,
she accidentally killed her sister.

819
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:42,380
Poor child.

820
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:48,266
It's a shame I couldn't do more for her.
I wasn't given much time, you see.

821
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:50,977
Yes, but you recommended
the procedure.

822
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:52,891
Oh, I'm afraid not.

823
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:55,401
I will admit she has been
quite a handful.

824
01:36:55,560 --> 01:37:00,441
In just one week here,
she stabbed an orderly, started a fire...

825
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:03,234
...and helped another patient to escape.

826
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:08,077
But I don't agree with this solution,
doctor.

827
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:12,085
But why would you sign for a procedure
you don't agree with?

828
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:13,586
Well, I...

829
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:19,425
That is your signature, is it not?

830
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:22,922
I've been doing this
for quite some time, doctor...

831
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:26,762
...and to be honest with you, I've wondered
myself whether or not it's right.

832
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:31,395
And I have seen some tortured souls
in here. Believe me.

833
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:32,771
But this one ....

834
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,775
Something in her eyes.

835
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,353
I've never seen anyone that ....

836
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,272
It's the way she looked at me.

837
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:43,658
It's like she wanted me to do it.

838
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:49,785
I hope it helps her.

839
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,826
Hi.

840
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,005
You remember me?

841
01:38:40,998 --> 01:38:44,468
Listen. Listen, I got a bad feeling, okay?

842
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:45,844
These boys do too.

843
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:48,927
This is not the way
we should be running this place.

844
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,218
We don't run the place. I run it.

845
01:38:51,384 --> 01:38:53,227
In the chair.

846
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:56,856
Look...

847
01:38:58,516 --> 01:38:59,859
...I'm not....

848
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,696
- I'm not hurting these girls anymore.
- I'm not doing this.

849
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:07,109
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.

850
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:09,027
I need her in that chair.

851
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:13,702
Put her in the goddamn chair!

852
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,377
Thank you.

853
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,921
Close the door, please.

854
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:33,851
What? What is it, you're not here? Huh?

855
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:37,981
You're not here, you're in paradise?
No, no, no. No, no, no.

856
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:39,857
No, no, no.

857
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,403
You're still here.

858
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:46,902
You're here with me.

859
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:50,409
In all this shit.

860
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,413
And you don't go away unless I say so.

861
01:39:55,156 --> 01:39:56,578
Okay?

862
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:12,094
That's not right.

863
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:14,516
That's not right.

864
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,265
You come back to me.

865
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:23,188
- Stop right there. Move away from the girl.
- What are you doing?

866
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:26,525
Aah! Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Aah!

867
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,735
What in God's name
have you been doing up here?

868
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:31,526
I wasn't doing anything. Look at her.

869
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,115
She's gone. Look at her face!
She's not here.

870
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:37,327
What do you think I wanna do?
I take care of these girls.

871
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:40,084
I look out for them.
These are my girls. Tell them.

872
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,791
Tell them!

873
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:44,331
Get him out of here.

874
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:48,047
- Now.
- Aah! Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

875
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:50,462
It's not me you want, it's her stepfather.

876
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:54,303
I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you...
I'll tell you about the money.

877
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:56,930
Just keep going down the hall.

878
01:40:58,135 --> 01:40:59,887
You all right, miss?

879
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,568
Miss?

880
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:24,162
The mystery of whose story it will be...

881
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:27,131
...of who draws the curtain.

882
01:41:27,957 --> 01:41:31,461
Who is it that chooses our steps
in the dance?

883
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:34,548
Who drives us mad...

884
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:36,508
...lashes us with whips...

885
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:40,770
...and crowns us with victory
when we survive the impossible?

886
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,181
Who is it...

887
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:46,851
...that does all these things?

888
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:51,697
Bus 22 southbound
to Fort Wayne will now begin loading.

889
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:54,985
Please have your tickets ready
to show the driver.

890
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:11,042
Excuse me, miss?

891
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,139
Miss, can we have a word?

892
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:19,725
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

893
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:22,728
This doesn't concern you.
I have questions for the lady.

894
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:25,731
Well, could you make it snappy?
I need to stay on schedule.

895
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,733
- We understand.
- Do you?

896
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:30,395
That young woman's been on this bus
since Hartford.

897
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:34,782
I don't see what she could possibly know
about anything happening around here.

898
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,112
Is that true, miss?

899
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:40,155
I just let her off to use the restroom.
Mine's not working.

900
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:47,253
- All right.
- Oh, and one more thing.

901
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:51,633
- She's been a joy the entire journey.
- Yes, I said, all right.

902
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:57,589
Sorry about the inconvenience, miss.
You have yourself a nice trip now.

903
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,098
It's no problem.

904
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:12,608
- I don't have a ticket.
- I know. It's okay.

905
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:16,274
Go find a seat in the back.
Try and get some sleep.

906
01:43:16,941 --> 01:43:19,364
We got a long way to go.

907
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:22,120
Thank you.

908
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:34,050
Who honors those we love
with the very life we live?

909
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:37,795
Who sends monsters to kill us...

910
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:41,800
...and at the same time
sings that we'll never die?

911
01:43:42,842 --> 01:43:47,814
Who teaches us what's real
and how to laugh at lies?

912
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:52,819
Who decides why we live
and what we'll die to defend?

913
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,479
Who chains us?

914
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:59,150
And who holds the key
that can set us free?

915
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:02,573
It's you.

916
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:05,828
You have all the weapons you need.

917
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:07,333
Now fight.
