1
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:52,543
Oh God,

2
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:55,713
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things...

3
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:56,838
I cannot change...

4
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,466
- Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?

5
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:01,970
...courage to change
the things that I can...

6
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:02,887
- Come on!

7
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,432
- You have been a good
boy for a long time.

8
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,809
- You know you want to do this.

9
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:08,852
...and wisdom...

10
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,690
...wisdom to know the difference...

11
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,829
Taking, as He did, this sinful world

12
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:26,002
as it is, not as I would have it.

13
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:29,166
Trusting that He will make all things
right, If I surrender to His will,

14
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:31,294
that I may be reasonably
happy in this life

15
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,799
and supremely happy with
Him forever in the next.

16
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:36,176
Amen.

17
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,475
I could go on and on

18
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,222
about what a great guy here Earl is,

19
00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:43,434
how he gives so freely
of his time and his money.

20
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:48,815
Even how he... believes in
how he cuts his toenails.

21
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:55,071
Let's get Earl up here
and speak for himself.

22
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:56,453
Ladies and gentlemen,

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,412
I give you a businessman,
philanthropist, a very dear friend,

24
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,289
and the Portland Chamber of Commerce

25
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,332
Man of the Year,

26
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Mr. Earl Brooks!

27
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,385
Thank you all

28
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:15,279
very much.

29
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:22,186
First thing I'd like
to say is that I--

30
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:26,649
I don't even know how I cut my toenails.

31
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,446
20 years ago,

32
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,740
when I started the
Brook's box factories,

33
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:36,368
I never dreamed
I would--

34
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,340
I never dreamed that I would
one day be standing here...

35
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:55,640
subsbusters. blogspot.
com proudly presents

36
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:01,897
Did you see Sis Wallace's dress?

37
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,817
You could see her nipples,

38
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:05,735
at her age!

39
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,655
Wow, she cannot keep
those things hidden.

40
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,949
The only thing that would have
made this evening more perfect...

41
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,619
is if Jane had been here.

42
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:19,083
Emma, she called to
congratulate me, right?

43
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,835
She has midterms coming up.

44
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:24,840
I think she's dropping out.

45
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:26,841
Let's see.

46
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:31,305
Nothing she does is
wrong with you, is it?

47
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,726
Well,

48
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,519
she missed a good party.

49
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:46,739
It's not like it's not set up.

50
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,036
You already know how
to bypass the alarms,

51
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:54,122
you know I don't pick the locks...

52
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:55,082
- No.

53
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,834
You are the fucking Man of the Year,

54
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:00,629
you deserve a treat.

55
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,382
- No, Marshall, I said no.

56
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,009
But I heard you.

57
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:07,303
But you don't mean 'no'.

58
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:11,977
What's wrong?

59
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:15,312
Nothing.

60
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,379
You are frowning.

61
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:22,487
I'm thinking about what I
didn't say in the speech.

62
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:25,198
Honey,

63
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:28,744
It was so... moving.

64
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,747
You made us all laugh.

65
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:34,417
I don't think anybody felt left out.

66
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:40,966
They have their dance class tonight.

67
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:44,930
You can just drive by

68
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:47,181
and look at them.

69
00:04:47,224 --> 00:04:49,601
There's no harm in just having a look.

70
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:52,019
No means no, Marshall.

71
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,689
- Please...

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,359
Pretty please...

73
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:11,208
I thought the food tonight was very good
but I was not crazy about the dessert.

74
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:16,341
Would you like to stop somewhere
and get something sweet?

75
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:18,634
Ok.

76
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:25,558
You know that I don't want a small dog.

77
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:28,227
Labradors are supposed to be brave.

78
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,690
Golties, always had Golden
Retrievers, they're very happy...

79
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:38,114
An Irish Labrador is in the middle now.

80
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:41,868
It's a little smaller in
build. That still is quite full.

81
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,144
Standard poodles, you
call it a very happy fam.

82
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:49,272
How 'bout a rescue
dog, what do you think?

83
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,529
Don't let me do this, don't
let me do this, please.

84
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:14,530
I don't want to start again.

85
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,117
You promised her, you promised.

86
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:20,203
Please... please.

87
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,456
- Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?

88
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:45,399
I'm going to stay up a while,

89
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:49,653
maybe go to the studio and
play with some glaciers.

90
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:52,573
Okay.

91
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,203
I'm gonna read, and if I'm not
awake, wake me when you come back.

92
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:08,925
On the way,

93
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:12,513
I though you were wonderful
tonight, Mrs Brooks.

94
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,432
Thank you, Mr. Brooks.

95
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,352
Oh, Lordie, road man.
Well I have missed this...

96
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:34,855
'cause we are going
to have so much fun--

97
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:39,444
This is the last time, Marshall,
understand me? It's the very last time!

98
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,703
Don't you dare quit on
me, you piece of shit.

99
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,643
I wanna see what they are doing.

100
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:41,790
Hello.

101
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,585
Fuck!

102
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,211
Be quiet!

103
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:47,506
Sit up!

104
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,632
Oh, Earl.

105
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,852
What the fuck is this?

106
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,275
These fucking pigs like to
do it with the curtains open.

107
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:47,071
You should have known that. This
is a big mistake for you, Earl.

108
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:52,703
Almost like a want to
get caught on, Marshall.

109
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,913
Oh, don't fucking do that.

110
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:02,297
I don't think either of us will enjoy spending the
rest of our lives on death row or a lethal injection.

111
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:06,594
Yes, Sir.

112
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,165
Please forgive me.

113
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,504
Please forgive me.

114
00:13:16,777 --> 00:13:19,279
You're a fucking artist
Earl, I give you that.

115
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,730
Don't even think about it.

116
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:32,607
You know the rules.

117
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,472
Now go upstairs and make
love to your beautiful wife.

118
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:19,952
Do we have the room, please?

119
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:23,707
Thank you.

120
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:29,421
There's a thumbprint, right there.

121
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:31,924
One his, one hers?

122
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,176
That's what it looks like.

123
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,928
This guy has not been
active for over 2 years.

124
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:41,644
He always rearranges the bodies,
but this is way out of character.

125
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,438
Usually it's much more romantic.

126
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:47,900
Arms around each other, kissing...

127
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:50,820
mouths open, tongues touching.

128
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:53,532
Bullets from straight
through the victims,

129
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:54,782
killer recovered the slugs.

130
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,586
Were these open or
closed when you got here?

131
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:05,545
Closed.

132
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,221
Could be the work of a copycat.

133
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,143
It has never been revealed to the public
that the killer retrieves the slugs.

134
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,146
Jesus, I was hoping
this guy was either dead

135
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:23,149
or in jail on some other charge.

136
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:30,657
We checked the whole neighbourhood,
so far nobody saw a thing.

137
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:38,165
Leaving them like this... he must have
been really angry at them for some reason.

138
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:47,425
Where would they keep
their vacuum cleaner?

139
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,520
So I bet you 100 bucks, Hawkins,
there is no bag in this vacuum cleaner.

140
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:58,565
I have no idea what the
hell you are looking for.

141
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:03,278
He vacuumed the house and took the bag.

142
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,116
What if he kills somebody that
didn't have a vacuum cleaner?

143
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:09,951
He wouldn't do that.

144
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,129
Our best hope is if someone
in there saw something.

145
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,964
Detective Tracy Atwood?

146
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:21,882
- Yes?
- Hi. This is for you.

147
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:23,634
You've been served.

148
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,387
You fucking asshole.

149
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,137
I am in the middle of a
fucking murdering investigation.

150
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:28,117
- Listen lady, I'm just a messenger here...
- Hawkins!

151
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:29,057
What's the deal?

152
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:30,224
Get this ass out of here!

153
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:33,646
What is it?

154
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:37,989
Soon to be ex-husband's scumbag
lawyer, trying to show me

155
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:42,072
just how painful she can make my life
if I don't give them what they want.

156
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:43,990
Are there any new members?

157
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,180
Okay.

158
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,956
Hello, my name is Vaughn,

159
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:55,546
I'm an alcoholic, and I haven't
had a drink in 10 months.

160
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,681
Hi, my name is Earl, and...

161
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:08,351
I'm an addict.

162
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:16,609
Anyone else?

163
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:18,556
You are such a fucking hypocrite.

164
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:23,618
If you were honest, you'd step up there and say:
'Hi, I'm Earl, I killed two people last night',

165
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,499
I'd really got off on it but
I need your help to be cured.

166
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,128
I'm different, Marshall. I
won't argue that with you.

167
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:37,466
This it is the only place that has ever
helped me be normal, and I've been straight

168
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,594
up until last night...
for the past 2 years.

169
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:43,516
I am not going to kill again.

170
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:49,564
And I am not going to quit
coming here because it upsets you.

171
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,652
...we need a cleanup
crew for afterwards.

172
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,989
We need some volunteers for the...

173
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,742
Oh, thank you, Earl. I appreciate that.

174
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:13,549
Based on your requirements,
this is our first attempt.

175
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,762
Mr. Brooks, your daughter is
waiting for you in your office.

176
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,977
Well, I hope this is what
you had in mind, if not...

177
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,938
we would love to work with
you further on the design.

178
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,859
Always find a challenge on machines.

179
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,779
Now, if you gentlemen would excuse me, I
need to see how much kin deployment cost me.

180
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,997
I understand.

181
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:39,621
Daughter cost money. Me too.

182
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:44,000
I believe you do understand.

183
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:47,963
Matt Johnson wants to schedule
lunch for Friday, can I talk to--

184
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,631
- Sunday? Did--? - Can
you hold this for a second?

185
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:55,221
Did Jane call and say she was coming?

186
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:58,185
Nobody gave me that message, Mr. Brooks.

187
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:00,477
- She is in there?
- Yeah, she is, and...

188
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:07,151
She has some boxes and suitcases downstairs
and she didn't have any money for the cab.

189
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:09,029
And you paid for that?

190
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:10,698
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

191
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:12,281
Hold my calls.

192
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:13,284
Sure.

193
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:14,577
I told you.

194
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,080
When it's appropriate.

195
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:18,915
You let me know.

196
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,252
And can I have some water?

197
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:25,005
Hello gorgeous.

198
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,782
What are you doing here?

199
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:31,033
I'm sorry Daddy.

200
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:35,017
Please don't be angry with me.

201
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:37,649
All right, I can guess what you've done,

202
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,815
but why don't you tell
me and then I'll decide.

203
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:42,816
I dropped out of school.

204
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,467
Ouch.

205
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:48,468
Oh Jane... Okay.

206
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,742
Have you told your mother?

207
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:52,495
No, I wanted to talk to you first.

208
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:54,705
Well, you gonna have to
tell her, Jane, all right?

209
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:56,290
I'm not going to do that for you.

210
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:58,897
- Why can't
you--? - Sit!

211
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:00,128
And then,

212
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,631
together, the three of us, will decide

213
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,465
where it'll go from here.

214
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:08,387
Okay, but I thought a lot about this.
College is a waste of time for me.

215
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,307
How does...?

216
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,893
How does somebody know that, half
way through their freshmen year?

217
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:18,064
You didn't even go to college,
Daddy, and you are successful.

218
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,526
I want to come work for you.

219
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,783
She is not telling you everything,
she is hiding something.

220
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:27,449
I know.

221
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,790
I am not hiring right now, sweetheart.

222
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,002
Okay, but just listen
to me for one second.

223
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:37,754
All right? Look.

224
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:43,010
What would happen to the business if,
God forbid, something would happen to you?

225
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:44,637
Okay?

226
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:47,558
Mom would probably have
to sell to strangers.

227
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:50,497
Now look, I am willing
to start at the bottom,

228
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,734
you can treat me like
a regular employee.

229
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:57,068
I just want to learn everything there is
to know about running the box business.

230
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:59,444
Then, when the time comes...

231
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,364
It can stay in the family.

232
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:07,787
Well, that's sweet, honey, but...

233
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:11,792
you are not talking about business, you
are talking about emotion. Now get up.

234
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,547
In fact, your mother and I came
this close to selling out last year.

235
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:17,383
What?

236
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,426
That's right, and had we been
offered a little more money,

237
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:22,221
and they still may come back to us,

238
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:23,430
we would sell.

239
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,143
What would you do without the business?

240
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,186
Yes?

241
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:34,901
I'm sorry. The man outside
insisted that I give this to you.

242
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:37,841
He claims that you'll find
what's inside very interesting.

243
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,992
What is he, Sunday? Is he a salesman?

244
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:42,911
I've never seen him before.

245
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:44,412
I'll just give him back to
him and I'll tell him to call--

246
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:46,164
No, Sunday. Sunday, come here...

247
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,500
Thank you.

248
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:55,278
Jane, part of spending
four years at college is...

249
00:21:57,554 --> 00:21:59,762
to give yourself a chance to find out...

250
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:07,856
who you are...

251
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:10,483
and what you want to do.

252
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:14,076
I'll talk to Mom,

253
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:16,115
but I am not going back to school.

254
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:20,787
And where would you live?

255
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:24,125
To save money, I would move back home,

256
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:27,293
but no rules, no curfew. I
want to be treated as an adult.

257
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:28,838
Would you pay for rent?

258
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:34,676
Would you pay for food?

259
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:39,267
No Dad, you are a very wealthy man.
I think you can afford to keep me.

260
00:22:41,353 --> 00:22:43,854
Sunday, would you show the gentleman
who gave you the envelope...

261
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:47,106
into the conference room and tell
him that I would meet him there?

262
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,318
No problem, Mr. Brooks.

263
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:49,276
And, uh...

264
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:53,742
What happened to the BMW, Jane?

265
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:58,329
A friend is going to drive it
up. It will be here next weekend.

266
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:03,252
...and get Jane a cab.

267
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:08,135
Call your mother.

268
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:09,592
Are you going to give me a job?

269
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:14,514
If this were up to me, and I think
your mother will agree with this, I...

270
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,852
I think you should go back to school.

271
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:20,270
You see that, Marshall?

272
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:23,190
That's why I didn't want
to do the dance couple!

273
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:26,402
Stop your fucking whining, Earl.

274
00:23:27,654 --> 00:23:31,867
You enjoyed doing that couple just as as
much I did and look at the bright side:

275
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:34,833
He came to us, he didn't go to the cops.

276
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,749
If he's trying to shake us
down, we kill him, period.

277
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,292
We make it fun, but we'll kill him.

278
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,378
End of story.

279
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,104
What can I do for you, Mister...?

280
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:01,232
Let's say... Smith.

281
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:03,820
Okay, Mr. Smith.

282
00:24:07,282 --> 00:24:10,494
Before you get the wrong impression, Mr.
Brooks. I'm not here to shake you down.

283
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:14,998
Well, then these are the only copies
of these photos and you have no others.

284
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:18,085
No. I have other copies and other photos

285
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:20,131
and if anything happens to me...

286
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:22,089
How did you find me, Mr. Smith?

287
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:25,845
You are the Man of the Year, Mr. Brooks.

288
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:30,015
Your picture is in the paper.

289
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:36,065
And if it had not have been... I don't
know. I don't know what I would have done.

290
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:38,359
Lucky me.

291
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:41,195
What is it that I can help you with?

292
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,989
I've been watching
that couple for months.

293
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,744
Yeah, they liked to make
love with the blinds opened.

294
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:52,626
Sometimes I would... take pictures,

295
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:54,711
visual aids, for later.

296
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:59,841
It's a great way to get
off, I tell you that.

297
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,802
It was fun, I thought,

298
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:03,470
until I saw you've killed them.

299
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:06,183
And I have never

300
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:09,644
ever felt that... rush,

301
00:25:09,894 --> 00:25:10,895
like that, ever!

302
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:17,486
I know you are the thumbprint killer.

303
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:20,281
You have done this before.

304
00:25:22,158 --> 00:25:23,616
What I want...

305
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:30,083
is for you to take me with
you next time you kill someone,

306
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:32,503
and I'd like that to be soon.

307
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:45,016
And you were worried this
was going to be unpleasant?

308
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:46,644
The answer is simple:

309
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:50,940
Just tell Mr. Smith that you
have decided never to kill again

310
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:52,609
and he'll go away.

311
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:55,111
You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

312
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,987
In a word, yes.

313
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,868
Where do you think he
has the other pictures?

314
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,330
He put them in a safety deposit box,

315
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:09,796
but I bet the box is at the bank
where he keeps his checking account,

316
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,546
and the key...

317
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:17,637
It's on his key chain.

318
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:21,725
He really wants us to do this.

319
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:24,812
He is not going to the cops.

320
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,987
We have a deal?

321
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:38,374
From the angle of these pictures...

322
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:43,167
you live on the 3rd floor of the apartment
building across the alley from the couple's house.

323
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,758
Well...

324
00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:47,754
Yes or no, Mr. Smith?

325
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:49,673
Yes.

326
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,760
What time do you get home from work?

327
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:53,677
6.30,

328
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:55,179
7, depending of the traffic.

329
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,815
you can never come here again.

330
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,354
You can never call me.
Do you understand that?

331
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:05,294
- Yes.
- Okay.

332
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:08,611
Tomorrow night.

333
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,739
Not tonight, tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock,

334
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:15,201
leave your apartment
building and walk east.

335
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:17,203
I will pick you up there.

336
00:27:23,211 --> 00:27:24,586
If you are thinking
about doing anything...

337
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:26,967
We're both aware of
the rules, Mr. Smith.

338
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:32,096
But I feel I must warn you:

339
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:35,642
If it turns out that you enjoy killing,

340
00:27:36,894 --> 00:27:38,771
it can become very addictive.

341
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:41,482
It could ruin your life.

342
00:27:43,235 --> 00:27:46,507
- I want to do this.
- Okay.

343
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,912
Have I covered everything?

344
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,330
I can't think of anything else.

345
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:58,917
Then I'll see you
tomorrow night, Mr. Smith.

346
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,021
We've talked to our client and we've come up
with a figure that we feel is more than fair.

347
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:21,777
We can have a check for that
amount in your office by 6 o'clock.

348
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:24,029
We told you at the
beginning what we wanted.

349
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,490
That hasn't changed.

350
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:28,951
We feel our offer is more than generous.

351
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:31,830
I paid for everything
while we were together,

352
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,919
and now I'm being asked
to give this guy a bonus?

353
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:40,924
For spending time with me, time that
I've already paid for in the first place?

354
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:44,885
You know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not going to get a million five.

355
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:48,558
Oh, I don't know that, no, I...

356
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:51,978
Well, in fact, this is the
front page of yesterday's paper.

357
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:55,398
'Hangman escapes'

358
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,694
'After torturing his victims,

359
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,652
'Thorton Meeks

360
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,280
'would hang them in public places,

361
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:04,699
'church steeples, balconies,
freeways overpasses--'

362
00:29:04,738 --> 00:29:05,742
Where this is going?

363
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:09,498
Well, your client captured Mr. Meeks.

364
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,419
Come on Tracy, this is
not a lot of money for you,

365
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:18,173
and we both know how frightened I was after Meeks said
that he was going to escape and come back and kill you.

366
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:19,509
Let me ask again:

367
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:21,554
What is your point?

368
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:25,645
Our point is that Meeks,
or someone like Meeks,

369
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:29,270
may come after my client in
order to hurt your client.

370
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:32,190
That is very imaginative, counsellor,

371
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:34,275
but it's not based in reality at all.

372
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:36,236
Jesse.

373
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,196
Let's just let us handle this, please.

374
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,408
- Tracy?
- Jesse,

375
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:42,868
you know what would make me
feel really safe right now?

376
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,499
If you got hit by a truck...

377
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:49,752
and died.

378
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:53,381
Well, that's it.

379
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:55,341
Mr. Vialo and I are leaving.

380
00:29:56,134 --> 00:29:58,098
You threatened the safety of my client.

381
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,472
We are going to have to
get a restraint order.

382
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:02,056
See you in court.

383
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:06,437
Get hit by a truck and die?

384
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:10,399
Fuck it, I felt good.

385
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:13,737
It's not what's here, it's what's
not here that's interesting.

386
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:17,032
If I had a number, I'd say these
people have been killed by a ghost

387
00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:22,079
The autopsy said there was a tiny piece
of plastic in the female victim's brain.

388
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:26,836
It's a dead end, he bags the gun. He puts a one
gallon plastic freezer bag over his hand to his wrists.

389
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:31,590
Little bit of plastic comes out with the
first slug when the shell's gone in the bag.

390
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:32,883
Were you looking for me?

391
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:36,136
I've received the subpena from
your husband for your work records,

392
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:39,683
where you worked, date and
times for the past two years.

393
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:44,690
He's just trying to blackmail me, until a settlement,
but my lawyers assure me that I'll go never to court.

394
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:46,274
I can't take that chance.

395
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:49,278
almost three quarters of
your cases are current,

396
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:53,156
so, until you're settling your divorce,
I'm gonna have to put you on a desk.

397
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:55,367
That's also blackmail.

398
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:58,664
Do you have any idea what
this guy has done to me?

399
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,707
While we were married, while
I was paying for everything,

400
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:04,795
he was just out fucking every
woman he can get his hands on.

401
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:07,632
He fucked my friends,
he fucked my cousins.

402
00:31:07,672 --> 00:31:08,882
He made me look like an idiot.

403
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:10,259
- And?
- And what?

404
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,220
Get over it!

405
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:17,642
You can't grow old as a woman without
having at least one frowzy man in your life.

406
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:20,895
Well, I made him an offer and I am
not going to give him a dime more.

407
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:22,565
Did you hear that Meeks escaped?

408
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:23,692
Yeah.

409
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:27,069
We got every unit looking for him,
you want me to put a detail on you?

410
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,322
I think I can take care of myself.

411
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:34,453
It's one of your biggest problems,
Tracy. You don't know how to ask for help.

412
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:25,761
What the fuck, what the fuck, what...?

413
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:32,226
Don't worry, if I were here to
kill you, you would already be dead.

414
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:39,694
After you left today, I realized that
our friendship was a little one-sided.

415
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:44,116
So, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind as to bring

416
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:47,452
all the pictures and the
memory card from your camera?

417
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:52,039
That way we can like each
other simply for who we are.

418
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,335
If you don't show up...

419
00:32:55,587 --> 00:33:00,091
I will presume that you have gone
to the police and I will kill you.

420
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:05,806
Even if I'll go to jail because of you, Mr
Smith, someone will find you, wherever you are...

421
00:33:06,516 --> 00:33:07,891
and they will kill you.

422
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:17,903
Mr. Brooks.

423
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:24,787
Mr. Brooks?

424
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:38,883
Mr. Brooks?

425
00:33:58,367 --> 00:33:59,409
Wow!

426
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:47,588
It's nice to have you home.

427
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,014
- Why do I have to
know what's expected?

428
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:02,605
- Why do I have to miss you? And
isn't my happiness worth anything--?

429
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,672
Hello, hello. You have to explain this to
me? It's because you're a mother, that's why!

430
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:15,245
What's wrong, girls?

431
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,380
Ask your daughter what the real
reason is she dropped out of school.

432
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,759
I told you, it's not the real reason.

433
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:30,093
Honey...

434
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:31,511
you wanted to go to college.

435
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:34,308
You had good grades, your father put
in favours to get you into that school.

436
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,643
If this is not the reason...

437
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:37,394
please, Dear God, tell me the reason.

438
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:40,273
Why does your mother think
you dropped out of the school?

439
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:44,736
I'm pregnant.

440
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:47,196
But that's not the reason I dropped out.

441
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:49,824
Being pregnant wouldn't keep me
from going to school if I wanted to.

442
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,124
Who is the father?

443
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:00,045
Some guy a was seeing.

444
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:02,464
Some...some guy, does he know?

445
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:03,882
Of course he knows, Dad.

446
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:06,845
He is married, he got two kids,
he wants nothing to do with me.

447
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,762
Oh, honey.

448
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:10,891
Oh,
honey--

449
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:12,434
I'm not going to go through with it,

450
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:13,607
so there is nothing to be upset about.

451
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:15,311
I mean, I wasn't even
going to tell you guys--

452
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,895
There will be

453
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:17,898
no abortion, Jane.

454
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,194
No, Dad, you're not going
to tell me what to do, ok?

455
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:23,195
It's my body and I'll
do what I want with it.

456
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,330
I'm sorry, you're
right. I said it wrong.

457
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,836
I wasn't trying to tell you
what to do. What I was...

458
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:41,049
What I was trying to say is that...

459
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:43,677
a grandchild would be a wonderful gift

460
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:45,346
for your mother and me.

461
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:52,187
Would you really want to have a
grandchild? Even if I'm not married?

462
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,815
Yes.

463
00:36:57,193 --> 00:36:58,532
A child is what's important.

464
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:03,364
We would... we would love it and
cheerish it completely and we would...

465
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:06,493
We would help you raise it.

466
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:11,917
If it means that much to
you, I will think about it.

467
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:24,432
I'm gonna have to start getting
up little earlier, uh, honey?

468
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,564
Well, we were right.

469
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:35,116
She was hiding something.

470
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:38,406
The pregnancy is not of all of
it, she's hiding something bigger.

471
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:44,872
Something much bigger.

472
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:46,414
You think so?

473
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,083
I know so,

474
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:50,169
and so do you.

475
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:55,450
It's darker tonight than
it was on your night.

476
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:57,871
But still...

477
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:01,707
How did you managed to not
bump into the furniture?

478
00:39:16,642 --> 00:39:17,850
Was the light on...

479
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:19,562
or did you turn it on?

480
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:22,690
Because I know you, and you
wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.

481
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,668
Where have you been?

482
00:39:35,705 --> 00:39:39,042
Did you miss the thrill of killing?

483
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:50,430
What if these are stuck closed,

484
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:53,348
because you yanked them closed?

485
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,896
Which would mean...

486
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,650
they were open...

487
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,776
when you came into the room.

488
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:12,119
Thank you, I appreciate your time.

489
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:17,044
Oops, sorry. I'm sorry.

490
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,169
No, I'm sorry.

491
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:20,214
I was just about to knock.

492
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:22,341
I'm detective Atwood, Portland police.

493
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:23,676
How are you doing this evening?

494
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:24,760
Fine.

495
00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:28,680
You are a photographer, Mr... Bafford?

496
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:30,057
- No.
- No?

497
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:31,643
Thank you.

498
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:35,563
No, actually it's a
hobby I just started.

499
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:38,609
I don't know if you're
aware, but there was a murder.

500
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:40,757
Yes, in the house, across the way.

501
00:40:41,112 --> 00:40:45,283
You didn't happen to see anything
unusual or suspicious that night, did you?

502
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:50,414
No, I wondered that
when it happened, but...

503
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:51,541
No.

504
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,961
I'm sorry, I'm supposed
to be meeting somebody

505
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,212
and I don't want to be late.

506
00:40:57,798 --> 00:40:59,758
Well, here is my card.

507
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,677
If you did hear something
or remember anything...?

508
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,725
I wish I could be
more help, but...Sorry.

509
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:24,286
He looks clean.

510
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:27,705
Looks like he's alone.

511
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:32,002
No, I tell you, he
really wants to do that.

512
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:37,008
Maybe I should plow
over there. Pick him up.

513
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:39,427
No, just honk.

514
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:44,099
Maybe he'll get killed crossing the
street and save us the mess of doing it.

515
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:05,165
Almost...

516
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:19,221
It's coming down hard.

517
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:22,184
They say it will be sunny tomorrow.

518
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,060
I never trust those guys.

519
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,771
They say it's going to
be clear, and it rains.

520
00:42:24,896 --> 00:42:27,982
And they say it's going
to rain and it's... sunny.

521
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,821
I believe this is what you asked for.

522
00:42:34,906 --> 00:42:37,284
The pictures and the memory card,

523
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:38,117
all here?

524
00:42:39,371 --> 00:42:40,330
Both.

525
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,753
You and I both know that not
all the pictures are in here,

526
00:42:47,588 --> 00:42:50,424
and you made a copy of the
memory card, as a security option.

527
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:54,179
But you understand my position?

528
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:57,724
Yes, I do.

529
00:42:58,267 --> 00:43:00,803
But it's my hope that once
you get to know me better

530
00:43:00,857 --> 00:43:03,146
you feel confortable in
giving me everything...

531
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:05,024
that I've asked you for.

532
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:08,359
Sounds correct.

533
00:43:10,947 --> 00:43:12,241
I thought you might
be interested in this.

534
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:16,619
this is the police woman,
who is looking for you

535
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:21,293
Wow, we've never known anyone
that was looking for us before.

536
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:25,256
You're going to have to find out
everything there is to know about this...

537
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:26,589
woman.

538
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:30,470
This is close, Marshall.

539
00:43:31,513 --> 00:43:33,388
This is too damn close.

540
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:37,645
So...

541
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:39,230
what's the plan?

542
00:43:40,147 --> 00:43:43,610
What do we... What are
we doing here tonight?

543
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:47,781
We'll drive around until we
see someone we think we might...

544
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:49,450
enjoy killing.

545
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:53,412
Really?

546
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:56,040
You don't have have somebody in mind?

547
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,917
I don't enjoy this Mr. Smith. I do it...

548
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,837
because I am addicted to it.

549
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:05,300
Before you entered my life I vowed
that I would never kill again,

550
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:08,638
so, this is... your party.

551
00:44:09,055 --> 00:44:13,517
You can choose anyone you want
and we will do it together.

552
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:21,443
Can I pick somebody that I know?

553
00:44:28,244 --> 00:44:29,160
No.

554
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:32,415
You never kill someone you know.

555
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,876
It's the easiest way to get caught.

556
00:44:37,754 --> 00:44:38,880
- Okay?
- Yeah.

557
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:43,468
Buckle up.

558
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:48,182
You look a little bit like that...

559
00:44:48,974 --> 00:44:49,892
E.T. guy.

560
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:52,229
Remember that movie?
When he flies on the bike?

561
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:53,272
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

562
00:44:53,397 --> 00:44:54,689
I liked that movie.

563
00:45:56,552 --> 00:45:58,137
Jesus Christ!

564
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:04,023
Fuck him.

565
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:06,144
It's his fault, he is an asshole.

566
00:46:07,314 --> 00:46:08,148
Fuck you.

567
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,237
Maybe Mr Smith would like to kill

568
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:14,904
the driver of the pickup?

569
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:20,996
What about the driver of the pickup?

570
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:26,085
What if we kill him?

571
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:29,213
Yes!

572
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,176
Yes, I always wanted to fucking kill
somebody who fucked with me in traffic.

573
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:37,347
Well, you want to kill
the driver of the pickup

574
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:38,390
or the owner?

575
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:43,185
They may not be the same.

576
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:47,274
Driver.

577
00:46:48,944 --> 00:46:49,861
Okay.

578
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:53,282
We'll drive around till we
get a good look at him or her.

579
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:55,491
[Any problems] to kill a woman?

580
00:46:58,828 --> 00:47:00,623
No. An asshole is an asshole.

581
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:10,550
I wasn't in town that night.

582
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:12,302
My roommate was, maybe he saw something.

583
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,221
May I speak to him?

584
00:47:13,555 --> 00:47:16,892
He is in on his way to Tokyo right
now, he is also a flight attendant.

585
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,312
Did the victims ever leave
their bedroom curtains open?

586
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:22,482
All the time.

587
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:25,331
I don't know if they thought
we couldn't see them doing it,

588
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,486
if that's why you are asking,
or if they didn't care.

589
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:29,823
well, here is my card.

590
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:30,908
If you could have your roommate call me

591
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,995
and the people at this number know how
to reach me anytime at day or night.

592
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,955
I won't be here, but I
will leave him a note.

593
00:47:35,997 --> 00:47:36,998
Ok great, thank you.

594
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:37,915
Sure.

595
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,231
Would you recognize him if you
saw his driver's licence picture?

596
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:37,566
Yeah.

597
00:48:39,777 --> 00:48:43,322
I'd memorize the licence
number, you write it down.

598
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:45,325
I got it.

599
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:48,516
Wow.

600
00:48:50,412 --> 00:48:52,708
Well, when you get
home, go on the internet,

601
00:48:53,126 --> 00:48:55,920
find out everything
you can about this guy.

602
00:48:56,587 --> 00:48:58,256
We are not going to kill him tonight?

603
00:48:58,293 --> 00:48:59,256
No.

604
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:03,392
We could, but then we
wouldn't be in control.

605
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:08,768
We could leave loose ends, and
we both know the danger of that.

606
00:49:09,936 --> 00:49:10,853
Yeah, we do.

607
00:49:17,612 --> 00:49:19,197
What are
you-- we doing?

608
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:24,701
What are you doing?

609
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:26,496
Look at me.

610
00:49:26,912 --> 00:49:28,582
- Look at me!
- Why?

611
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:32,336
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

612
00:49:32,377 --> 00:49:33,379
Close.

613
00:49:35,382 --> 00:49:37,467
What's the licence plate number?

614
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:42,973
Shit!

615
00:49:43,056 --> 00:49:44,391
P4...

616
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:45,559
no

617
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:46,726
2...

618
00:49:47,062 --> 00:49:48,729
I know it's Oregon.

619
00:49:49,439 --> 00:49:50,481
Because of the tree?

620
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:53,568
Don't feel bad.

621
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:56,530
I've been doing this a
long time. Pen, paper.

622
00:49:56,948 --> 00:49:58,908
Look out the window and write it down.

623
00:50:01,745 --> 00:50:03,329
What was your first time like?

624
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,167
You really don't want to know
that much about me, Mr. Smith.

625
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,439
No, I don't think it was right, go back.

626
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,736
Ok, we are in.

627
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,614
For all the taxes we pay you'd think
they'd make it more difficult...

628
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:36,868
to hack into the police personnel file.

629
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,872
Her father is John Atwood, why...?

630
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,957
Why does that ring a bell?

631
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:46,294
Someone you did business with?

632
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:48,296
Someone we...

633
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:49,715
killed?

634
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:51,382
No, not someone we killed.

635
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:53,887
Let me see here, MBA...
(Master of Business Association)

636
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:57,473
College of William & Mary. She
has been a cop for 12 years,

637
00:50:57,515 --> 00:50:59,810
married Dr. Carlson,

638
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:03,813
divorced Dr. Carlson,
married a Jesse Vialo.

639
00:51:04,649 --> 00:51:07,005
a restaurateur, seperates
from Jesse Vialo,

640
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:10,572
sued for support by
Jesse Vialo, seeing...

641
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,657
seeing a shrink

642
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:14,535
because of Jesse Vialo.

643
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:19,707
She has caught a lot of people.

644
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:24,839
And look here, this is not the first
time she has been looking for us.

645
00:51:26,632 --> 00:51:28,509
Okay, here we are.

646
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:34,433
Jesse Vialo, good looking,
a little younger than she is.

647
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,603
Younger, restaurateur...

648
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:41,070
She married him on a
rebound from the doctor

649
00:51:41,107 --> 00:51:44,567
and I'll bet he married her
for her money and connections.

650
00:51:45,195 --> 00:51:48,448
Just because the old men is
rich doesn't mean she is rich.

651
00:51:49,867 --> 00:51:52,910
Maybe is one of the kind of guys
that'd rather give it to the opera

652
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:54,163
than to his kids.

653
00:51:56,249 --> 00:52:00,545
What does she have to declare?
Any outside incoming holdings?

654
00:52:11,057 --> 00:52:12,058
Oh, you are a...

655
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,766
You are a genius.

656
00:52:16,146 --> 00:52:18,231
The opera didn't get much.

657
00:52:21,694 --> 00:52:26,032
Why would a woman, worth
60 plus million dollars...

658
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,242
and probably more to come...

659
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:31,705
want to be a cop?

660
00:52:32,957 --> 00:52:34,499
I like that about her.

661
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,632
You are a such a fucking snob, Earl.
You like her because she is rich.

662
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:43,093
No, I like her because she has
found something that's hers,

663
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,679
It's not the family business,
and she is good at it.

664
00:52:46,514 --> 00:52:49,767
I'd like Jane to find
something that's hers...

665
00:52:50,477 --> 00:52:52,062
and that she could be good at.

666
00:52:56,108 --> 00:52:59,694
That's exactly why Atwood
scares the shit out of me.

667
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:01,822
She's a cop who doesn't
need the money...

668
00:53:03,116 --> 00:53:05,165
and she is looking for us.

669
00:53:05,202 --> 00:53:07,287
That's one fucking
dangerous human being.

670
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,793
The fact that you are not wrong
just not makes me admire her...

671
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:14,379
any less.

672
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,921
Hey Nancy!

673
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:16,844
Hi Trace,

674
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:18,550
Thank you for meeting me here

675
00:53:18,587 --> 00:53:19,383
- I got you a latte.
- Thanks.

676
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:22,053
Do you mind if we walk and talk
while I hear about your big idea?

677
00:53:22,096 --> 00:53:23,013
Oh, sure.

678
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:24,390
You really want to settle this?

679
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:25,224
If I can.

680
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:28,644
I'd like to use your father.

681
00:53:29,479 --> 00:53:30,104
No.

682
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:32,148
My father does nothing for nothing.

683
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:36,069
Tracy, I understand, but your
father has a lot of political muscle.

684
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:37,695
His pull won't make everything go away,

685
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:39,072
but it would be a tremendous help.

686
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:40,116
Absolutely not.

687
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:41,533
You're right.

688
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:43,119
We could have done
this all on the phone.

689
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,830
If you are willing to play the
game and ride the desk for a year,

690
00:53:45,873 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm sure we can settle it
at 1.25, 1.5 (million $)

691
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:49,382
I'm not sitting on a desk.

692
00:53:49,418 --> 00:53:51,252
Then the only other
option is your father.

693
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:52,213
Or money.

694
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:56,926
1.5 and that's it.

695
00:53:57,824 --> 00:53:58,448
Okay.

696
00:53:58,762 --> 00:53:59,929
I'll call them today.

697
00:54:01,265 --> 00:54:04,018
I just need to get this
done as soon as possible.

698
00:54:05,144 --> 00:54:07,021
That's what Jesse is counting on.

699
00:54:08,355 --> 00:54:09,941
I'll call you when I have something.

700
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:13,904
Oh, Tracy.

701
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:18,908
Your husband says there's a picture of him
holding some trophy that you still have?

702
00:54:20,036 --> 00:54:21,953
What picture? He has everything.

703
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:24,332
He claims it's his favourite picture...

704
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:26,543
and you put it up where
you store your suitcases.

705
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,379
I'll look.

706
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:29,880
I know.

707
00:54:30,379 --> 00:54:33,217
Petty, you are going through a divorce.

708
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:36,429
Thanks for the latte.

709
00:54:59,915 --> 00:55:02,707
I told you I was coming back to get you.

710
00:55:03,836 --> 00:55:05,921
I already found a place
where I'm going to hang you.

711
00:55:08,632 --> 00:55:10,739
First, I'm going watch her...

712
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:13,784
have some fun with you.

713
00:55:15,641 --> 00:55:19,269
Then she is going to watch
me have some fun with you.

714
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:21,897
You know the drill.

715
00:55:34,953 --> 00:55:36,078
Don't fucking move!

716
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:37,206
Shoot me!

717
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:40,376
Come on, shoot me, motherfucker!

718
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:22,611
5 down...

719
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:24,801
'Sleeper's demon.'

720
00:56:24,906 --> 00:56:26,991
Sleeper's demon.

721
00:56:28,243 --> 00:56:29,807
Incubus.

722
00:56:33,896 --> 00:56:35,480
Maybe he went home with someone else.

723
00:56:36,148 --> 00:56:38,066
Can you still see his pickup?

724
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,112
This is not the kind of guy...

725
00:56:42,155 --> 00:56:45,533
who leaves his pickup in
an unguarded lot overnight.

726
00:56:47,223 --> 00:56:48,104
How do you know that?

727
00:56:48,245 --> 00:56:51,331
Somebody didn't do their
homework last night.

728
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:00,759
'Tom Sawyer's villain.'

729
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,185
Let me get it.'Injun Joe'.

730
00:57:09,222 --> 00:57:10,144
Yeah!

731
00:57:20,363 --> 00:57:21,950
Where do we know that guy from?

732
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:31,418
You really should pay more
attention to what you read, Earl.

733
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,462
That's what I have you for, Marshall.

734
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:38,113
His picture was on the frontpage
of the papers a couple of days ago,

735
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,429
because he escaped from jail. He is
the killer they call 'The Hangman'.

736
00:57:44,016 --> 00:57:45,517
You remember that cop...

737
00:57:45,554 --> 00:57:46,810
who you like?

738
00:57:47,645 --> 00:57:48,561
Atwood?

739
00:57:50,982 --> 00:57:55,612
Who is chasing us? She is
the one who put him away.

740
00:57:58,116 --> 00:57:59,117
Wow, wow.

741
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:00,951
What would life be...

742
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:03,118
without surprises?

743
00:58:04,121 --> 00:58:04,893
There he is!

744
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:05,832
There he is!

745
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,962
I'm in hot wild.

746
00:58:11,672 --> 00:58:15,050
This guy, I bet he's got all sorts of
plans for tonight and tomorrow night.

747
00:58:17,054 --> 00:58:18,638
He has no idea he'll already be dead!

748
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:21,807
He will not be able to do any of them.

749
00:58:28,483 --> 00:58:30,443
I don't think I want to kill this guy.

750
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,155
What?

751
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:34,781
Oh, I...

752
00:58:35,323 --> 00:58:37,952
love what you are thinking!

753
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:42,747
You have no idea of what I am thinking.

754
00:58:43,249 --> 00:58:44,084
Yes, I do.

755
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:46,918
And it's wonderfully twisted.

756
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:50,006
Wait a minute, are
you--? You promised!

757
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:51,926
I know I said we would,

758
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,638
but I don't think it
would be that much fun.

759
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:57,264
So that's it? Just 'no'.

760
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,474
Yes.

761
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:02,561
- Uh-oh.
- So...

762
00:59:04,816 --> 00:59:06,191
You got the licence plate?

763
00:59:06,234 --> 00:59:06,901
Yeah.

764
00:59:08,403 --> 00:59:12,699
They found the Van in an underground parking
lot about two miles from where they left you.

765
00:59:12,735 --> 00:59:14,032
It was stolen last night.

766
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:16,287
We are checking security camera tapes.

767
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:18,203
If Meeks and the woman left in a car,

768
00:59:18,242 --> 00:59:19,623
we'll have a licence plate number.

769
00:59:20,332 --> 00:59:22,209
These are the women we have
pictures of who know Meeks.

770
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:24,046
None of the attendents
remember seeing them.

771
00:59:25,504 --> 00:59:29,010
What about that chiropractor Alvin Griffin,
the other one who sold Meeks steroids?

772
00:59:29,046 --> 00:59:31,262
We've had a tap on his phone
ever since Meeks escaped.

773
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:33,431
No contact there so far...

774
00:59:33,515 --> 00:59:34,599
and sure he is not going to talk to us.

775
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,393
How about a warrant to search the house?

776
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,395
You get me in the door
and he'll talk to me.

777
00:59:38,437 --> 00:59:39,438
How is your divorce going?

778
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:44,568
I took your advice and
told my lawyer to settle.

779
00:59:45,695 --> 00:59:47,403
None of these are the woman in the van.

780
00:59:47,823 --> 00:59:49,116
Whoa, I'm trying to stitch you up here.

781
00:59:49,283 --> 00:59:51,118
And your ego can handle that?

782
00:59:52,995 --> 00:59:55,080
No, but it doesn't
likes the other choices.

783
00:59:55,456 --> 00:59:59,543
Because the FBI is wiring hard on me
to take over the thumbprint killer.

784
01:00:01,505 --> 01:00:03,923
Until Meeks is caught,
Hawkins is with you.

785
01:00:06,134 --> 01:00:09,179
Nothing personal, Hawkins, but I
don't think you'd take a bullet for me.

786
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,808
I wouldn't take the bullet,
I might push you out the way

787
01:00:12,893 --> 01:00:15,354
I'll give two days, then I want
a progress report of your divorce.

788
01:00:16,188 --> 01:00:18,023
Look, I have all the pieces
for the thumbprint killer.

789
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:20,275
I'm just not looking
at it the right way.

790
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,237
I'll keep the FBI out
of it for three days.

791
01:00:24,946 --> 01:00:26,658
That is ugly.

792
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:37,711
Mr. Smith wants you to
notice that he's pouting.

793
01:00:39,923 --> 01:00:41,548
Yes, I know.

794
01:01:01,114 --> 01:01:03,741
I know you are upset,
Mr. Smith, and I am sorry.

795
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:06,618
Yeah. I'm upset.

796
01:01:10,624 --> 01:01:13,793
Maybe I was a little brut
back there, but let me explain.

797
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:17,924
Finding someone you think would
be fun to kill is a bit like...

798
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,141
Hell, it's a bit like falling in love,

799
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,263
you meet a lot of candidates, you
like some of them and they're nice.

800
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:26,642
But they are not right.

801
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,895
And that special one comes along...

802
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,024
and your heart... it beats faster.

803
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:36,153
And you know: That's the one.

804
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:40,907
The man in the pickup did
not make my heart beat faster.

805
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:42,910
Ok.

806
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:45,914
The man didn't make your
heart beat faster. Then who?

807
01:01:47,206 --> 01:01:48,750
I don't know but I think...

808
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,088
I think I have someone in mind.

809
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:55,924
Do you want me to do some work on it?

810
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:57,968
No, let's just...

811
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:00,846
Let's just see how it plays out.

812
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:05,603
That's what I'm talking
about, that's my problem.

813
01:02:06,312 --> 01:02:08,688
That...that makes me feel
like I'm being jerked around.

814
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:11,067
It was supposed to be last night,
then it was going to be tonight,

815
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:13,778
and now it's 'Let's
see how it plays out'?

816
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:15,155
I feel like you're...

817
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:17,241
I feel like you are
bagging out of our deal.

818
01:02:19,327 --> 01:02:20,995
- I don't like how that feels.
- I promise you...

819
01:02:21,246 --> 01:02:23,331
I promise you it will happen.

820
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,582
When?

821
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:27,502
When is it going to happen,

822
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:28,920
Mr. Brooks, when?

823
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,925
Tomorrow night. Same time.

824
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,554
When you come out of your
building, I want you to turn right,

825
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:40,183
go to the first street
that you can go West on.

826
01:02:40,729 --> 01:02:43,352
I will pick you up, on that street.

827
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:44,772
Okay.

828
01:02:50,198 --> 01:02:55,200
I want to do this, but if killing
is to drag out, I can change my mind.

829
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,749
Don't you think I want
to do this, Mr. Smith?

830
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:03,250
Maybe you don't think
that you have to anymore!

831
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:18,561
Even if that guy was charming and
funny I still would not like him.

832
01:03:54,557 --> 01:03:55,599
Hi

833
01:03:56,022 --> 01:03:57,023
Hi.

834
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:00,276
What can I do for you?

835
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:03,114
Detective Smolny,
Portland Police Department.

836
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:06,739
This is Detective Carfagno,
she is in Palo Alto, California.

837
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:22,589
Emma.

838
01:04:25,014 --> 01:04:25,675
Emma!

839
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:34,853
Did Jane ever tell you that there
was a murderer at her school?

840
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:36,400
No.

841
01:04:37,065 --> 01:04:37,735
Nothing?

842
01:04:39,192 --> 01:04:42,742
Not that her friend died
or somebody she knew died?

843
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,489
or some... somebody in her dorm died?

844
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:49,000
No, why?

845
01:04:49,661 --> 01:04:52,956
Well, there are two detectives
downstairs, one of them is from Palo Alto.

846
01:04:53,584 --> 01:04:58,170
They want to ask her some questions about a murder
that occurred there shortly before she came home.

847
01:04:58,213 --> 01:04:59,761
Oh, my gosh.

848
01:05:02,558 --> 01:05:04,767
Well, I'm sure if she was close
to somebody who was murdered,

849
01:05:04,803 --> 01:05:05,686
she would have said something.

850
01:05:06,346 --> 01:05:07,018
Yeah.

851
01:05:09,982 --> 01:05:12,438
I called Roger. He suggested
a criminal attorney.

852
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:15,483
They will be here within the hour.

853
01:05:18,696 --> 01:05:19,738
Yeah, I'll get dressed.

854
01:05:23,115 --> 01:05:25,117
- This is too close.
- I know!

855
01:05:36,095 --> 01:05:38,138
Jane, how well did
you know Philip Ramsey?

856
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:42,310
He and I were in a couple of
classes together. That's about it.

857
01:05:42,435 --> 01:05:44,807
- Did you ever drive him to class?
- No.

858
01:05:46,357 --> 01:05:48,484
You've ever been to his apartment?
Do you know where he lives?

859
01:05:49,103 --> 01:05:51,107
Which complex was he in?

860
01:05:51,189 --> 01:05:52,398
What happened to your BMW, Jane?

861
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,236
It was actually stolen...

862
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:02,061
Well, that was interesting.

863
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:05,190
You know, I don't feel so well.

864
01:07:06,025 --> 01:07:08,110
I think you should lie down, okay?

865
01:07:08,993 --> 01:07:10,320
I think she should lie down.

866
01:07:17,252 --> 01:07:19,665
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't
say anything before.

867
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:23,836
It was really horrible, but I
didn't know the guy that well and...

868
01:07:24,552 --> 01:07:28,967
It happened around the same time
I found out I was pregnant, so...

869
01:07:29,555 --> 01:07:30,342
- ...just can I lie down?
- I understand.

870
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:37,642
I am going to go up with her.

871
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,158
Now tell me, what do I do?

872
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:59,293
She did it.

873
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:00,460
Didn't she?

874
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:03,839
Yeah.

875
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:09,603
It'll take the cops a week to ten days
to put their case together and then...

876
01:08:11,648 --> 01:08:13,484
...and then they will
come back and arrest her.

877
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:21,697
What are you going to do?

878
01:08:42,554 --> 01:08:43,093
Oh God!

879
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:45,302
Oh God!

880
01:08:45,343 --> 01:08:48,514
I've been afraid of this
since before she was born.

881
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:52,603
She has...

882
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,068
She has what I have.

883
01:08:55,449 --> 01:08:56,691
Yes, she does.

884
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:00,904
But you're always smarter
about it, she was stupid.

885
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,035
She did it because she got
off on it. Okay, I understand.

886
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:10,206
She did it for fun. Okay, I understand.

887
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:17,671
But why didn't she think it through
a hatchet, and she left it there?

888
01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:24,889
You are pretty graphic all day.

889
01:09:24,931 --> 01:09:27,016
That was the shock of
her making a mistake.

890
01:09:27,172 --> 01:09:28,662
What does she think I think?

891
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:31,437
I wish she'd remember what she told me,

892
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:34,838
that the BMW was being driven
across the country by her friend,

893
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:38,653
and now, right, she tells
the cops that it was stolen.

894
01:09:38,911 --> 01:09:42,451
You've always cleaned her bathroom,
whatever she did, all her life.

895
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:52,168
It's the BMW. As anything
incriminating I hope it was stolen.

896
01:09:53,555 --> 01:09:55,807
I hope she dropped it at the
bottom of a very deep lake.

897
01:09:55,849 --> 01:09:57,894
Do you think she knows all
those troubles that she's in?

898
01:09:57,936 --> 01:10:03,276
I think she thought she had gotten
away with it until the cops showed up.

899
01:10:06,726 --> 01:10:11,586
I should've listened to her,
she was trying to tell me.

900
01:10:11,632 --> 01:10:13,025
It was there.

901
01:10:14,863 --> 01:10:17,030
'I didn't quit school
because I was pregnant.'

902
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:20,794
I should have dug deeper.

903
01:10:21,037 --> 01:10:25,134
And where would you be, but in exactly
the same place that you are in now?

904
01:10:25,839 --> 01:10:27,708
It's not your fault, Earl.

905
01:10:28,626 --> 01:10:32,356
Part of your problem with her
is that you always think it is.

906
01:10:32,391 --> 01:10:37,266
She has what I have, Marshall, so on
a very basic level, it is my fault!

907
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:40,934
What are you going to do?

908
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:00,296
Maybe the best thing for her
would be to let her go to jail.

909
01:11:06,723 --> 01:11:10,595
- What about her child?
- Emma and I will help her raise it.

910
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,108
You might be right Earl, you know?

911
01:11:16,895 --> 01:11:17,808
Just might be.

912
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:24,065
Because if she's not stopped she is going
to kill again and if she really wants...

913
01:11:24,369 --> 01:11:26,776
...to take over that box business

914
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:29,193
the next victim could be...

915
01:11:32,794 --> 01:11:33,537
you.

916
01:11:38,686 --> 01:11:39,457
I...

917
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:43,009
I don't think she would go that far.

918
01:11:57,609 --> 01:11:58,478
Hey.

919
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:00,479
We've received a counter offer.

920
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,565
Are you sitting down?

921
01:12:03,163 --> 01:12:04,361
Yeah, go ahead.

922
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:06,165
5 million dollars.

923
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,036
My God, you got to be kidding me.

924
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:10,993
He can't get that, can he?

925
01:12:11,122 --> 01:12:13,783
No, no, no, my sense of
it is that by asking for 5

926
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:16,875
they are hoping you'll settle
anywhere between 2.5 and 3.

927
01:12:16,912 --> 01:12:17,553
Shit!

928
01:12:17,763 --> 01:12:18,805
Can you stall them?

929
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:23,216
No, they know you want this done quickly so
they're going to expect a quick counter offer.

930
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:27,105
Look, I need two days, just
wait 2 days, tell them...

931
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:31,024
that it's a big number and
that I have to think about it.

932
01:12:31,067 --> 01:12:31,683
OK.

933
01:12:32,023 --> 01:12:34,728
Oh, and that picture that he wanted...

934
01:12:39,453 --> 01:12:41,068
Tell him I couldn't find it.

935
01:12:46,324 --> 01:12:46,963
Yes, Mr. Brooks.

936
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:54,137
Mr. Brooks?

937
01:12:55,793 --> 01:12:57,391
Before you open your mouth...

938
01:12:59,309 --> 01:13:01,675
be very sure this is the right...

939
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:03,522
thing to do.

940
01:13:04,135 --> 01:13:06,392
I will never be sure.

941
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:11,270
You get pissed at me

942
01:13:12,146 --> 01:13:15,822
because I'm always the one
argueing to go ahead and do murder.

943
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:19,613
Not this time, Earl.
This is your decision.

944
01:13:20,489 --> 01:13:24,381
I know what's wrong. I
know in my heart it's wrong.

945
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:27,705
Then don't do it.

946
01:13:29,915 --> 01:13:32,167
Go with Mr. Smith and
let it finish that.

947
01:13:33,044 --> 01:13:36,896
And let the police put Jane in
jail, hopefully that will save her.

948
01:13:37,382 --> 01:13:42,067
And we can happily go on
with our tortured lives.

949
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:44,763
That's exactly what I want to do.

950
01:13:45,849 --> 01:13:49,536
That's exactly what I should do.
The thing is, she is my daughter.

951
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:52,733
And I love her.

952
01:13:54,364 --> 01:13:55,406
Mr. Brooks?

953
01:14:01,965 --> 01:14:03,245
I'm going home.

954
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:07,748
Cancel everything for
the rest of the day.

955
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:09,137
I'll take care of it.

956
01:14:09,182 --> 01:14:13,396
If you 'need me' need me,
Sunday, I'll be in my studio.

957
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:14,841
Call me there.

958
01:14:16,092 --> 01:14:20,392
I probably won't pick up,
so... just leave a message.

959
01:14:22,564 --> 01:14:23,908
I'll try to not bother you.

960
01:14:53,343 --> 01:14:58,933
The thing that bothers me about this, besides
the fact that we are not prepared and...

961
01:15:01,324 --> 01:15:03,452
a multitude of other things, is...

962
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:07,707
What does Mr. Smith do when
he's walking west tonight and...

963
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:12,114
...you don't show up. That
little freak will flip out.

964
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:16,285
I will take care of it,

965
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:18,496
on the way to the airport.

966
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:23,668
What are we doing?

967
01:15:24,092 --> 01:15:27,437
'What are we doing?' 'What are we
doing?' You sound like a whiny-ass kid.

968
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:31,133
- We are playing a hunch.
- We have been following this guy all day.

969
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,097
He is boring, ok?

970
01:15:33,478 --> 01:15:35,535
And everything we run
on him comes out clean.

971
01:15:35,694 --> 01:15:37,914
Well, if it didn't, it
wouldn't be called a hunch.

972
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:41,481
Meeks, he's the guy we
should be looking for, Meeks.

973
01:15:42,647 --> 01:15:45,610
Look where? Please, tell me.

974
01:15:46,904 --> 01:15:50,508
Look, everyone knows who Meeks
is and is looking for him.

975
01:15:50,598 --> 01:15:53,413
The chiropractor was the last
link to his old life that I know.

976
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:59,679
We are going to find him now, somebody will turn
him in, we are going to troop over him at a bus stop.

977
01:16:00,252 --> 01:16:02,130
On the other hand, nobody knows...

978
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:04,382
who the thumbprint
killer is or where he is.

979
01:16:04,547 --> 01:16:06,804
However, I have a fucking hunch.

980
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,553
that this guy, Bafford, does.

981
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,847
I've got 2 days to play that hunch

982
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:14,684
So if you think you are wasting your time
with me, then I'd be happy to do it alone.

983
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:18,406
I had a fight with my wife this morning.

984
01:16:18,982 --> 01:16:19,982
What's your problem?

985
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:23,879
My husband wants 5 million dollars.

986
01:16:34,832 --> 01:16:35,832
Here you are, Sir.

987
01:16:36,501 --> 01:16:37,460
Sir?

988
01:16:40,715 --> 01:16:41,631
Thank you.

989
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:52,037
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things that I cannot change.

990
01:16:53,353 --> 01:16:56,383
Courage to change the things that I
can and wisdom to know the difference.

991
01:16:56,482 --> 01:16:59,195
Living one day at a time,
enjoying one moment at a time.

992
01:17:29,122 --> 01:17:31,207
'not able to meet'

993
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,242
'Do it same time tomorrow'

994
01:17:47,893 --> 01:17:49,978
'Don't be stupid'

995
01:17:51,795 --> 01:17:53,002
Good for you, asshole!

996
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:02,180
Remember me?

997
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,906
Can you step out of the car,
please? I want to talk to you.

998
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:12,901
So, Mr Bafford, what is it
that you have to tell me?

999
01:18:13,293 --> 01:18:14,987
What do you mean? I don't
have anything to tell you.

1000
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:17,996
Really? Because I was driving around...

1001
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:21,116
and I suddenly got this feeling
that you had something to tell me...

1002
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,078
about the murders.

1003
01:18:23,288 --> 01:18:23,873
No.

1004
01:18:25,123 --> 01:18:25,915
Nothing.

1005
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:27,373
Oh, that is disappointing.

1006
01:18:28,589 --> 01:18:32,890
Because, when I left after
we... we talked last time

1007
01:18:33,299 --> 01:18:36,235
I thought I had missed a clue
that was right in front of me...

1008
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,721
that could solve this whole case.

1009
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:40,973
I don't know why you would feel that.

1010
01:18:42,852 --> 01:18:47,942
Can you tell me that you are an amateur
potterer, that you like to make bowls and vases?

1011
01:18:47,983 --> 01:18:48,620
No.

1012
01:18:49,109 --> 01:18:54,573
I told you that my hobby was
photography and not pottery.

1013
01:18:56,702 --> 01:18:58,222
Oh, maybe, maybe that was it.

1014
01:19:00,091 --> 01:19:03,393
Flight attendant upstairs said that the
victims liked to keep their bedroom curtains...

1015
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:05,174
open when they had sex.

1016
01:19:06,565 --> 01:19:10,345
Can I see some of those
photos you took of that couple?

1017
01:19:34,549 --> 01:19:36,807
You are harassing me, Detective Atwood.

1018
01:19:37,503 --> 01:19:42,169
You knew very well that I'm not a
potterer and I don't have any pictures.

1019
01:19:42,631 --> 01:19:43,977
So my feeling is that
your feeling is wrong,

1020
01:19:44,111 --> 01:19:46,050
and you should just move
your car and let me go home.

1021
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:52,449
What's your job here?
What... what do you do?

1022
01:19:53,808 --> 01:19:55,448
I am a mechanical engineer.

1023
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:59,144
You got to be really
smart for that, don't you?

1024
01:20:00,065 --> 01:20:00,792
Yes.

1025
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:03,921
Then be smart, Mr. Bafford.

1026
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:08,157
Because you lied to me,
right there at the end.

1027
01:20:10,493 --> 01:20:11,743
I'll be watching you.

1028
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:15,872
When you want to tell me the truth,
you have to get in touch with me.

1029
01:20:17,087 --> 01:20:18,347
See you later alligator.

1030
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:37,075
Captain Lister got us the
search warrant for Meeks Doctor.

1031
01:20:38,014 --> 01:20:38,667
That's good.

1032
01:20:38,815 --> 01:20:40,900
Goddamnit, this guy knows something.

1033
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:43,738
Almost told me, and
then something happened.

1034
01:20:43,864 --> 01:20:44,591
You think he did it?

1035
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:47,909
I don't think it's quite that simple.

1036
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:50,502
Do you want to call for backup?

1037
01:20:51,414 --> 01:20:52,717
Yeah, we should be ready for anything.

1038
01:20:52,762 --> 01:20:54,545
In fact, get a K-9
(canine) unit and a chopper,

1039
01:20:54,587 --> 01:20:57,976
I don't have the energy to chase
this guy if he decides to run.

1040
01:21:33,382 --> 01:21:34,666
This is the Police.
The house is surrounded!

1041
01:21:38,577 --> 01:21:39,862
Alvin Griffin, fold your
hands on top of your head!

1042
01:21:46,185 --> 01:21:46,772
Clear!

1043
01:21:50,728 --> 01:21:52,203
Meeks was a steroid freak.

1044
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:54,484
This was ususally full. It's empty now.

1045
01:21:55,654 --> 01:21:56,985
You think Meeks has Alvin with him?

1046
01:21:57,739 --> 01:22:00,415
He thinks Alvin turned him in. On me!

1047
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:58,076
Hawkins, meet Alvin Griffin.

1048
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:12,727
How do you feel?

1049
01:24:16,203 --> 01:24:18,027
Dirty.

1050
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:20,287
That's understandable.

1051
01:24:22,373 --> 01:24:25,739
You've never killed for this reason
before, the feeling will pass.

1052
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,990
I don't think so.

1053
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:29,759
It's the whole thing, Marshall.

1054
01:24:31,037 --> 01:24:34,713
If I could find a way
to just end it all,

1055
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:38,058
...disappear, where there's
absolutely no trace of me.

1056
01:24:39,547 --> 01:24:41,152
Because eventually I will
get caught doing this.

1057
01:24:41,205 --> 01:24:42,882
That would be very
embarrassing for me...

1058
01:24:43,551 --> 01:24:44,760
and Emma and Jane.

1059
01:24:46,401 --> 01:24:47,357
So I have been thinking.

1060
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:53,311
Is there a way that Mr. Smith
could kill me and make me disappear?

1061
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,277
Rule no.1: Mr. Smith is
not smart enough to do that.

1062
01:25:00,314 --> 01:25:01,088
I know that.

1063
01:25:01,132 --> 01:25:06,303
No.2: There is no reason, if you are
careful, to believe you will ever get caught.

1064
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:11,708
I know that I will have to plan
it for Mr Smith but I think...

1065
01:25:13,646 --> 01:25:14,836
I think that is what I want to do.

1066
01:25:15,003 --> 01:25:19,131
Well, I'm not particulary
fond of that plan, Earl.

1067
01:25:19,175 --> 01:25:23,857
Remember? If you die, I go with you
and I like being alive. I like...

1068
01:25:25,139 --> 01:25:28,028
eating, I like fucking, I like killing.

1069
01:25:29,394 --> 01:25:32,896
I have to end it, Marshall,
one way or another.

1070
01:25:34,155 --> 01:25:35,776
And I think this is the best way.

1071
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:44,160
Fuck you then!

1072
01:25:47,185 --> 01:25:48,644
Come on.

1073
01:26:12,957 --> 01:26:13,913
- Hi.
- Hi.

1074
01:26:14,568 --> 01:26:15,493
You worked all night?

1075
01:26:15,529 --> 01:26:18,450
(Yes, I had to sort out
packets for 2 women. )

1076
01:26:18,824 --> 01:26:20,039
(A packet of money. )

1077
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:21,909
Will be fine.

1078
01:26:26,211 --> 01:26:33,338
(And I have these Chinese clients
that I am trying to get right. )

1079
01:27:00,288 --> 01:27:02,581
Hey Daddy, I thought
you've been gone already.

1080
01:27:04,543 --> 01:27:08,795
Roger called. There was another
murder last night at your school.

1081
01:27:11,924 --> 01:27:12,529
Yeah

1082
01:27:13,442 --> 01:27:15,763
Gone in the same way as the
one they talked to you about,

1083
01:27:15,806 --> 01:27:19,266
right down to the hatchet
being left at the scene.

1084
01:27:23,023 --> 01:27:25,108
They think they have a serial killer.

1085
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:30,085
Obviously, you were here last
night. So, you are in the clear.

1086
01:27:32,171 --> 01:27:32,823
Well, it's...

1087
01:27:34,169 --> 01:27:35,661
It's good news, isn't it? I mean...

1088
01:27:36,429 --> 01:27:39,644
Even if you are innocent it's
good to know you are not a suspect.

1089
01:27:42,252 --> 01:27:43,044
Yeah...

1090
01:27:43,598 --> 01:27:47,258
How's the... how's the morning sickness?

1091
01:27:48,856 --> 01:27:51,984
Better than yesterday.

1092
01:27:54,558 --> 01:27:55,981
Do you want to have lunch with me today?

1093
01:27:58,285 --> 01:28:01,023
I'd love to but I don't
know how I will feel later.

1094
01:28:02,858 --> 01:28:03,455
Thank you.

1095
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:21,183
Do you love me, Jane?

1096
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,355
Of course I love you, Daddy.

1097
01:28:26,224 --> 01:28:27,223
You are my father.

1098
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:38,479
Have you decided whether
or not to have the baby?

1099
01:28:40,444 --> 01:28:41,277
Not yet.

1100
01:29:25,883 --> 01:29:27,328
It's time to go.

1101
01:29:34,183 --> 01:29:37,311
Dear Emma and Jane, my loves.

1102
01:29:39,008 --> 01:29:44,222
I have a terminal illness and instead
of subjecting you to my deterioration

1103
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:47,826
I have decided to disappear.

1104
01:29:49,652 --> 01:29:52,084
Do not try to find me,
I don't want to be found.

1105
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:55,484
Please believe that the
time I spent with you

1106
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:58,573
brought me the greatest joy of my life.

1107
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:03,578
Love, Dad.

1108
01:30:07,164 --> 01:30:09,084
So you are going to go through with it?

1109
01:30:12,047 --> 01:30:13,854
It's all planned to work out.

1110
01:30:28,584 --> 01:30:32,234
- Ready to rock and roll, Mr. Smith?
- Yeah.

1111
01:30:44,707 --> 01:30:46,096
I smell gun oil,

1112
01:30:47,544 --> 01:30:49,093
different gun oil than yours.

1113
01:30:50,267 --> 01:30:51,309
He brought his gun.

1114
01:30:53,439 --> 01:30:55,886
If he not gets what he
wants, he plans to kill me.

1115
01:30:56,568 --> 01:31:01,268
Oh, now I get it.
You're counting on this.

1116
01:31:02,103 --> 01:31:03,477
It has a certain logic.

1117
01:31:04,356 --> 01:31:10,446
But if you plan was to have him kill you,
why do you have to kill somebody else first?

1118
01:31:12,615 --> 01:31:15,338
I'll need to see that to get
up the courage to kill me.

1119
01:31:17,598 --> 01:31:19,748
Not even you believe that, Earl.

1120
01:31:21,082 --> 01:31:22,206
This makes it more exciting,

1121
01:31:22,292 --> 01:31:23,043
doesn't it?

1122
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,255
I think that he's going to kill you
after you killed somebody else...

1123
01:31:26,337 --> 01:31:28,298
you're getting your rocks on, big time.

1124
01:31:29,592 --> 01:31:30,982
That's why you are doing this.

1125
01:31:31,303 --> 01:31:32,937
Not true. And if it were,

1126
01:31:33,892 --> 01:31:35,891
so what?

1127
01:31:42,844 --> 01:31:43,627
Hello.

1128
01:31:44,149 --> 01:31:45,067
Yeah, put it through.

1129
01:31:45,903 --> 01:31:47,069
I just got your message.

1130
01:31:48,883 --> 01:31:51,283
The weird thing is that
they closed that curtains.

1131
01:31:51,621 --> 01:31:55,922
At first they were open like they always were
and they were make love like they always did.

1132
01:31:56,331 --> 01:31:58,713
Then, when I looked again,
the curtains were closed.

1133
01:31:58,748 --> 01:32:02,439
And there were what looked like camera
flashes coming from behind the curtains.

1134
01:32:02,796 --> 01:32:03,838
Camera flashes?

1135
01:32:03,879 --> 01:32:05,005
That's what it looked like.

1136
01:32:05,884 --> 01:32:07,568
That's why he poses them.

1137
01:32:08,263 --> 01:32:08,969
I'm sorry?

1138
01:32:09,177 --> 01:32:10,522
No, no, no. Nothing.

1139
01:32:11,055 --> 01:32:13,976
Look, the guy you should talk to
is the guy on the floor below us.

1140
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,693
Would that be a Mr. Bafford?

1141
01:32:16,019 --> 01:32:20,820
Yeah, he told me once that he had taken some
great pictures of that couple making love.

1142
01:32:21,211 --> 01:32:22,609
He is the one you should talk to.

1143
01:32:23,362 --> 01:32:24,612
Okay, great. Thank you.

1144
01:32:30,662 --> 01:32:31,467
Yeah?

1145
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,595
Hawkins, meet me at Bafford's
apartment with a search warrant.

1146
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:44,023
Put these on.

1147
01:32:54,019 --> 01:32:56,104
Nice outfit.

1148
01:33:06,409 --> 01:33:09,496
Try a couple of deep
breaths through your nose.

1149
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:15,439
- I have to take a crap so bad.
- What?

1150
01:33:16,135 --> 01:33:17,921
I have to take a crap.

1151
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,695
We won't be long.

1152
01:33:58,847 --> 01:34:00,063
I was with your wife's lawyer.

1153
01:34:01,021 --> 01:34:02,976
They are thinking about the 5 million.

1154
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:20,965
Realistically, how much
do you think we can get?

1155
01:34:21,286 --> 01:34:25,581
Oh, if we go to court,
best case scenario: 2.

1156
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:28,177
I think we should hold fare up for 3.

1157
01:34:29,629 --> 01:34:35,607
Let's not get biggish. 2.5,
2.7 'd still be a great deal.

1158
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,777
There's more if we want it.

1159
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:47,273
We have to do this quickly.

1160
01:34:47,357 --> 01:34:49,399
Remember? Maurice is meeting us here.

1161
01:34:50,924 --> 01:34:51,736
Yes.

1162
01:34:54,574 --> 01:34:55,616
I asked her to join us.

1163
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:57,702
It's not funny.

1164
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,849
Are we alone?

1165
01:35:07,255 --> 01:35:08,978
Yeah.

1166
01:35:21,103 --> 01:35:22,019
Hello.

1167
01:35:29,195 --> 01:35:31,445
Do it. Do it!

1168
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:34,789
Don't do that.

1169
01:35:39,004 --> 01:35:39,830
Mr. Bafford?

1170
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,175
Mr. Bafford?

1171
01:35:44,523 --> 01:35:46,673
Yes! Wooooh! Yes.

1172
01:35:47,759 --> 01:35:49,432
Yes. You are the fucking man.

1173
01:35:50,135 --> 01:35:53,139
Oh, man, did you see
the look on her face?

1174
01:35:53,951 --> 01:35:56,949
The look on her fucking face was great!

1175
01:35:57,732 --> 01:35:59,079
It was great, it was fantastic.

1176
01:35:59,645 --> 01:36:00,313
That was...

1177
01:36:00,774 --> 01:36:04,528
everything that I hoped it would be.

1178
01:36:05,487 --> 01:36:07,780
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1179
01:36:11,033 --> 01:36:13,592
Mr. Bafford, knock knock.

1180
01:36:17,589 --> 01:36:19,674
Anybody home?

1181
01:36:28,322 --> 01:36:30,450
Mr. Bafford?

1182
01:36:33,685 --> 01:36:35,361
Hello?

1183
01:36:57,278 --> 01:36:59,108
Obviously Bafford is gone. Hey!

1184
01:37:01,024 --> 01:37:01,719
Obviously Bafford is gone.

1185
01:37:02,909 --> 01:37:05,179
Goddamnit Hawkins, don't you ever knock?

1186
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:07,387
I wasn't able to get a search warrant.

1187
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:10,143
We might ourselves gotten lucky. This
is the moving company's work order.

1188
01:37:10,227 --> 01:37:12,816
and this looks like the address
where they are taking Bafford's stuff.

1189
01:37:13,522 --> 01:37:14,314
Where were you when you called me?

1190
01:37:15,076 --> 01:37:16,162
I was at home, in bed.

1191
01:37:16,608 --> 01:37:17,526
Can you prove that?

1192
01:37:18,486 --> 01:37:21,614
I was at home, in bed. Why
do I need to prove that?

1193
01:37:23,951 --> 01:37:25,993
Your husband Jesse and his
lawyer were killed tonight.

1194
01:37:30,124 --> 01:37:31,083
Get the fuck out.

1195
01:37:32,979 --> 01:37:34,379
Looks like the thumbprint killer.

1196
01:37:34,934 --> 01:37:38,105
I have an order to bring
you in for questioning.

1197
01:37:39,278 --> 01:37:40,717
Why?

1198
01:37:41,429 --> 01:37:44,279
I did't want Jesse dead. Look,
I hated what he was doing to me,

1199
01:37:44,331 --> 01:37:45,600
but I didn't want him dead.

1200
01:37:45,641 --> 01:37:47,448
Got on record you said
you wanted him dead.

1201
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:51,064
Who better to fake a
thumbprint killing than you?

1202
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,705
You don't actually believe I'd do that.

1203
01:37:54,358 --> 01:37:57,702
If our jobs have taught us anything,
Tracy, it is that people do strange things.

1204
01:37:58,238 --> 01:37:59,618
They just want to ask
you some questions.

1205
01:37:59,658 --> 01:38:02,493
And I'm happyto answer the questions
after we go check out this address.

1206
01:38:02,536 --> 01:38:03,536
- I have to take you in.
- Look.

1207
01:38:03,579 --> 01:38:07,392
This is the answer to the thumbprint
killer and this is where I'm going.

1208
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:10,390
Don't make me cuff you,
because I will if I have to.

1209
01:38:11,476 --> 01:38:12,345
Hey, hey!

1210
01:38:18,136 --> 01:38:19,819
It'd be really nice if
you could go with me.

1211
01:38:20,097 --> 01:38:22,904
But if you do and this goes bad,
they are going to burn your ass.

1212
01:38:23,474 --> 01:38:24,392
So this never happened.

1213
01:38:24,436 --> 01:38:25,600
You're nuts.

1214
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:27,162
Yeah, that's what they say.

1215
01:38:31,693 --> 01:38:32,943
Here comes the gun.

1216
01:38:33,986 --> 01:38:34,697
Yep.

1217
01:38:38,547 --> 01:38:39,415
What are you doing?

1218
01:38:40,806 --> 01:38:42,588
You are smart enough to
figure that out, Mr. Brooks.

1219
01:38:43,372 --> 01:38:45,978
Well, we are going 65
miles an hour, Mr. Smith.

1220
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,061
If you shoot me now, there's
a good chance that we both die.

1221
01:38:49,106 --> 01:38:51,299
Not now. Take this next off ramp.

1222
01:38:53,468 --> 01:38:54,634
You mean this one?

1223
01:38:57,971 --> 01:38:59,973
That wouldn't be very
smart, I mean now, would it?

1224
01:39:05,443 --> 01:39:06,982
Think about this now, nut nuts:

1225
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,091
You pissed yourself back there, you left
your DNA at the scene of a double homicide...

1226
01:39:12,109 --> 01:39:15,177
and there is nothing to
indicate that I was ever there.

1227
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:19,827
The cops do an analysys of
that urine, and they will.

1228
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:22,751
You are the thumbprint killer.

1229
01:39:24,302 --> 01:39:28,924
No, no. I have pictures of
you from the first murder.

1230
01:39:29,257 --> 01:39:31,775
Yes, but what were you
doing at the second murder?

1231
01:39:36,989 --> 01:39:38,350
Let me help you with the fly.

1232
01:39:40,118 --> 01:39:42,291
You say that I've
forced you to come along

1233
01:39:42,334 --> 01:39:43,398
and if I'm not here,

1234
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:46,332
more specifically my body is not here

1235
01:39:46,375 --> 01:39:49,503
to say otherwise, you might have had
a chance to (get out of this mess).

1236
01:39:50,741 --> 01:39:52,719
You are probably asking
yourself: Why would I help you?

1237
01:39:54,675 --> 01:39:57,165
Well, I'm tired, Mr. Smith.

1238
01:39:57,456 --> 01:39:58,586
I am tired of killing,

1239
01:39:58,628 --> 01:40:00,196
but I'm an addict. I can't quit.

1240
01:40:00,353 --> 01:40:02,704
I've tried, but I
cannot do it on my own.

1241
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,505
So I need you to kill me.

1242
01:40:05,234 --> 01:40:08,760
But I need for you to do it smart.
Like in a way that I disappear

1243
01:40:09,512 --> 01:40:12,012
and my family never knows what I was.

1244
01:40:14,684 --> 01:40:15,357
How?

1245
01:40:15,894 --> 01:40:17,227
How do I fucking do that?

1246
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:23,153
There's a cemetery I know about.

1247
01:40:26,405 --> 01:40:29,698
We'll find an open grave, you shoot me.

1248
01:40:30,410 --> 01:40:31,784
I'll fall into the grave.

1249
01:40:33,303 --> 01:40:35,747
You'll shovel in just
enough earth to cover me.

1250
01:40:35,852 --> 01:40:37,937
Tomorrow, a casket is lowered onto me.

1251
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:40,752
And I've disappeared.

1252
01:40:41,213 --> 01:40:42,818
It's a good plan, don't you think?

1253
01:40:46,303 --> 01:40:49,075
Why? Why should I trust you?

1254
01:40:51,393 --> 01:40:53,021
You don't have to trust me, Mr. Smith.

1255
01:40:53,074 --> 01:40:54,478
You are the man holding the gun.

1256
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:57,733
You saw me put mine
in the trunk, remember?

1257
01:41:02,988 --> 01:41:03,675
I know.

1258
01:41:06,076 --> 01:41:07,499
You really want me to kill you?

1259
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:12,333
Yes.

1260
01:41:15,627 --> 01:41:17,669
Okay. Okay.

1261
01:41:19,466 --> 01:41:20,549
But one subtle move...

1262
01:41:23,142 --> 01:41:23,720
and I'll drop you.

1263
01:41:24,402 --> 01:41:27,313
And I'll make sure that your
family knows what you are.

1264
01:41:31,702 --> 01:41:33,023
I understand.

1265
01:41:44,173 --> 01:41:46,868
You come down on the world, Mr. Bafford?

1266
01:41:59,642 --> 01:42:01,944
Take your hand out of
your pocket, real slow.

1267
01:42:06,311 --> 01:42:07,726
You don't want to climb over, do you?

1268
01:42:08,202 --> 01:42:09,690
What do you do with
the key of a cemetery?

1269
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:12,285
I own it.

1270
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:15,631
Why do you own a cemetery?

1271
01:42:16,028 --> 01:42:19,032
I always want to invest in
things people can't do without.

1272
01:42:19,157 --> 01:42:22,285
Water and cemeteries? Pretty save bets.

1273
01:42:27,335 --> 01:42:28,251
Here.

1274
01:42:29,461 --> 01:42:30,883
You'll need this to get out.

1275
01:44:15,342 --> 01:44:17,297
Hey, Atwood!

1276
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,687
I want to show you something.

1277
01:44:44,112 --> 01:44:44,947
Okay.

1278
01:44:47,116 --> 01:44:48,034
Here we are.

1279
01:44:54,416 --> 01:44:55,143
Okay.

1280
01:44:56,013 --> 01:45:00,465
Now if I stand here
and you stand there...

1281
01:45:01,227 --> 01:45:03,182
Not...not too far away.

1282
01:45:04,181 --> 01:45:07,222
And you shoot me, I should...

1283
01:45:08,016 --> 01:45:10,977
I should fall straight
back into this hole.

1284
01:45:14,063 --> 01:45:16,439
You don't think I have
the guts to this, do you?

1285
01:45:17,566 --> 01:45:19,444
No, I'm hoping you do, Mr. Smith,

1286
01:45:20,404 --> 01:45:21,530
I'm hoping you do.

1287
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:26,471
Okay, let's...

1288
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:29,665
...let's get this over with.

1289
01:45:41,942 --> 01:45:43,430
I'll close my eyes.

1290
01:46:09,012 --> 01:46:11,053
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

1291
01:46:14,507 --> 01:46:17,137
I really did want you to kill me.

1292
01:46:18,094 --> 01:46:22,139
But in case, the last
minute I changed my mind,

1293
01:46:22,974 --> 01:46:25,019
I returned to your apartment.

1294
01:46:25,697 --> 01:46:28,869
And I've been for firing pin on your gun

1295
01:46:31,086 --> 01:46:34,996
In fact, I even brought another one
for you to use so you could finish me,

1296
01:46:35,779 --> 01:46:38,700
if I had decided to go through with it.

1297
01:46:40,341 --> 01:46:43,957
Unfortunately for you,
my daughter is pregnant.

1298
01:46:44,685 --> 01:46:47,566
And just before you pulled that trigger

1299
01:46:47,619 --> 01:46:51,768
I realized how much I want
to see the end of that story.

1300
01:46:51,873 --> 01:46:53,541
You fuck can't do this to me.

1301
01:46:53,645 --> 01:46:54,960
If you touch even a hair on my head,

1302
01:46:55,116 --> 01:46:56,695
the cops are going to
find those pictures.

1303
01:46:57,347 --> 01:46:59,389
And they will know that
you killed that couple.

1304
01:47:00,241 --> 01:47:03,477
The contents of your safety
deposit box, Mr. Smith,

1305
01:47:06,733 --> 01:47:08,024
have vanished.

1306
01:47:12,234 --> 01:47:14,102
It hurts, doesn't it?

1307
01:47:15,243 --> 01:47:16,927
No, please!

1308
01:47:41,694 --> 01:47:44,399
Before I was the thumbprint
killer, Mr. Smith,

1309
01:47:46,402 --> 01:47:48,298
I killed a lot of people...

1310
01:47:48,994 --> 01:47:50,993
in a lot of different ways.

1311
01:48:18,942 --> 01:48:20,714
Thank you.

1312
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:26,345
Detective Atwood credited for
tracking killer in 'Hangman' case

1313
01:48:28,744 --> 01:48:30,829
Hangman Killer case
ends in murder-suicide

1314
01:48:34,415 --> 01:48:37,376
It says there that the
thumbprint killer is a monster.

1315
01:48:39,398 --> 01:48:41,631
Annoying you a little bit, you
can't take credit, doesn't it?

1316
01:48:42,675 --> 01:48:44,134
No.

1317
01:48:44,968 --> 01:48:48,013
Anyone who's good what
they do wants credit.

1318
01:48:48,697 --> 01:48:50,738
Since I'm not going to do it anymore,

1319
01:48:51,349 --> 01:48:54,693
I'll let Mr. Smith have the credit.

1320
01:48:56,823 --> 01:48:59,169
Don't kid yourself, Earl.
You are going to kill again.

1321
01:48:59,692 --> 01:49:01,081
No, I am not.

1322
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:06,164
I'm going back to tha AA
meetings and I will control it.

1323
01:49:16,212 --> 01:49:19,173
But there is an answer
I would like to have.

1324
01:49:23,345 --> 01:49:24,387
Atwood?

1325
01:49:24,512 --> 01:49:26,390
Why you are a cop?

1326
01:49:26,427 --> 01:49:27,891
Who is this?

1327
01:49:28,476 --> 01:49:30,634
You are rich, you have a good education,

1328
01:49:31,417 --> 01:49:33,335
you could have gone into
your father's business,

1329
01:49:33,419 --> 01:49:36,885
instead you went outside all of that
and became successful on your own, why?

1330
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:41,073
If you want something from me then
you have to tell me who you are...

1331
01:49:41,110 --> 01:49:42,454
...or I'm going to hang up.

1332
01:49:42,491 --> 01:49:45,369
Did you think that your
husband's killing was random?

1333
01:49:45,836 --> 01:49:48,704
and I certainly didn't
have to give you Meeks.

1334
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:50,459
Mr. Bafford?

1335
01:49:51,268 --> 01:49:52,793
What is the answer?

1336
01:49:53,267 --> 01:49:54,797
You do not sound like you.

1337
01:49:56,351 --> 01:50:00,176
Well, I have a little cold. Are
you going to give me the answer?

1338
01:50:00,888 --> 01:50:02,434
Where are you?

1339
01:50:02,478 --> 01:50:06,433
I'll tell you if you can give me
the true answer to my question.

1340
01:50:18,338 --> 01:50:22,422
My... My father was very
disappointed that I was born a girl.

1341
01:50:22,466 --> 01:50:24,161
And he let me know it.

1342
01:50:25,768 --> 01:50:28,418
I spent my whole life
trying to prove him wrong.

1343
01:50:31,047 --> 01:50:32,297
Thank you.

1344
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:33,720
Wait.

1345
01:50:33,763 --> 01:50:36,109
You... you promised to
tell me where you are?

1346
01:50:36,511 --> 01:50:37,718
Me?

1347
01:50:39,473 --> 01:50:41,599
I am on top of a building.

1348
01:50:47,690 --> 01:50:49,623
That wasn't Bafford.

1349
01:53:21,922 --> 01:53:23,051
Jane!

1350
01:53:24,833 --> 01:53:25,875
Jane!

1351
01:53:27,245 --> 01:53:28,454
Wake up, wake up!

1352
01:53:36,435 --> 01:53:37,799
I woke you up?

1353
01:53:38,564 --> 01:53:39,759
It's okay.

1354
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:41,365
It's okay.

1355
01:53:44,056 --> 01:53:46,265
I'm here. Go back to sleep.

1356
01:53:52,356 --> 01:53:55,734
Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?

1357
01:53:56,421 --> 01:53:59,549
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things that I cannot change.

1358
01:53:59,823 --> 01:54:03,896
Courage to change the things that I
can and wisdom to know the difference.

1359
01:54:03,994 --> 01:54:08,063
Living one day at a time,
enjoying one moment at a time.

1360
01:54:08,729 --> 01:54:10,960
Taking, as He did, this sinful world

1361
01:54:11,127 --> 01:54:12,420
as it is, not as I would have it.

1362
01:54:13,526 --> 01:54:17,321
Trusting that He will make all things
right, If I surrender to His will,

1363
01:54:17,489 --> 01:54:19,929
that I may be reasonably
happy in this life

1364
01:54:19,992 --> 01:54:23,069
and supremely happy with Him
forever in the next. Amen.
