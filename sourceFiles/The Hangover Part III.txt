00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,955
We gotta do it the hard way.

350
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,761
STU: Oh, no!
DOUG: What the fuck? Hey!

351
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,127
MARSHALL: Let's go.
DOUG: Hey! No! No! What the fuck?

352
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,461
Whoa, what are you doing?

353
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,772
Doug is my insurance. He stays with me.

354
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,533
You don't give me Chow,
I blow his brains out.

355
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,971
You go to the cops...

356
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,671
...I blow his brains out.

357
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,439
That's insane! We don't even know
where the fuck he is!

358
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,446
No one does.

359
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,052
But I figure the wolf pack
has the best chance of finding him.

360
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,278
You have three days.

361
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,454
Get to work.

362
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,986
Can you take Stu instead?

363
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,490
Fuck you, Alan.

364
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,088
Shit.

365
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,836
Shit!

366
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,933
PHIL: Alan.
ALAN: Yeah, Phil?

367
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,011
PHIL: I need you to roll over here
and chew off these hand-ties.

368
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,408
ALAN: Okay.

369
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,907
- Oh.
ALAN: - Damn it!

370
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,245
Ow. Oh, fuck!

371
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,748
ALAN: Got a little too much steam.
PHIL: Get off me.

372
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,948
ALAN: All right, let me just shimmy down.

373
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,422
- Would you just hold still? Hold still!
PHIL: - Ow.

374
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,890
STU: Help!

375
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,287
Help!

376
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,428
PHIL: Holy shit.

377
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,136
What are we gonna do, Stu?

378
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,972
STU: - We're gonna go to the police.
- Oh, no, we're fucking not.

379
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,176
Did you hear that guy?

380
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,815
He will kill Doug, period.

381
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,983
Chow is a cancer.

382
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,484
He's been a cancer
since the first day we met him.

383
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,384
We're gonna hand him over to Marshall
and then it's done.

384
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,785
- Hey, Phil.
- Alan, not now.

385
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,052
But I need you, Stu. I can't do this alone.

386
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,060
Do what alone?
We have no idea where he even is.

387
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,357
- Phil.
- What, Alan?

388
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,091
I was gonna say I got this strange e-mail
the other day.

389
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,703
I wasn't sure what it meant,
but now I think it might be from Chow.

390
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,133
"Fatty, it feels good to be out."

391
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,334
"I'm close by. Tell no one.
I'll be in touch."

392
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,706
"Chow."

393
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,076
This says "Chow."
How did you not know this was from Chow?

394
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,652
At the time, I thought it was "Chow"
like "goodbye."

395
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,482
You know, like, <i>"Chow, arrivederci."</i>

396
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,181
- You know, Sbarro, Papa John's.
- I'm writing him back.

397
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,122
Whoa, wait, wait. Just hold on.

398
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,762
Gonna tell him you're happy he's out
and you'd love to see him.

399
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,091
Ooh, I would love to see him.

400
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,596
Do you even know what's going on?

401
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:28,636
Yes, I do. Phil's doing all the work,
I'm his assistant...

402
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:32,536
- ...you're standing there looking like an idiot.
- I'm gonna arrange a meeting...

403
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,610
- ...and we're gonna take him out.
- "Take him out"?

404
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,906
Who says that?
How do we take someone out?

405
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,279
We'll use drugs.

406
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,180
Prescription drugs.

407
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,787
You know, the kind a dentist has access to.

408
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:49,289
Good luck finding a dentist
who will write fake prescriptions.

409
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,723
Oh, I know one. His name is Stuart Price.

410
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,692
Now let's go find a fucking pharmacy.

411
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,058
Whoo! You just got schooled, son.

412
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,797
Are you coming or not?

413
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,403
I don't like this plan.

414
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,131
Okay, then. Ciao.

Go check it out.

419
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,552
Everything okay?

420
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,888
Well, it's just a strange request.

421
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,258
This drug in this amount
and a pack of syringes.

422
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,491
- It's just a little weird.
- Yeah.

423
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,568
It's just kind of an emergency, so...

424
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:37,434
See, that right there, and you're acting
all fidgety, plus you look like shit...

425
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,837
...in our business, these
are all red flags.

426
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,239
I need to call the doctor,
make sure everything's okay.

427
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,473
Aha. You're in luck, because I actually am
the prescribing doctor.

428
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,948
Oh, boy. Another red flag.

429
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,847
It says here you're a dentist.

430
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,153
Yeah. Doctor of Dental Science.

431
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,927
This is fucked up.

432
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,929
Hey, Dad?

433
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,062
I think we got a live one.

434
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,499
How'd we do?

435
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,541
We did good.
I got Demerol, a pack of syringes...

436
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,702
...and almost lost my dental license.

437
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,814
- What about Chow? Anything?
- No.

438
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,678
Oh, look at this.
He e-mailed me like 20 minutes ago.

439
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,050
Alan, we've been sit...

440
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,654
Give me the phone, please.

441
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,846
- What does it say?
- Oh, wow.

442
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,185
He wants to meet Alan tonight at 8.
It says come alone.

443
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,090
- Come alone where?
- A bus stop.

444
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,491
In Tijuana.

445
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,133
Tijuana's the bomb.

446

Oh, fuck.

No, that's perfect.
No, it's like a three-hour drive from here.

Yeah, Stu, try reading a map.

449
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,234
Yeah, Alan, try reading anything ever.

450
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,074
Yeah, Stu, try not having
such big horse teeth.

451
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,479
PHIL: All right, we need a plan.

452
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,087
They're meeting on a bus bench
in a public place...

453
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,316
...so Alan needs to convince Chow
to go someplace more private.

454
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,087
Someplace where we can sneak up on him
and drug him.

455
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,686
Like where?

456
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,388
I don't know, like an alley.

457
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,897

...we take the seats behind him,
we jab him and it's fucking done.

461
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,038
I'll jab him if you want.
I've drugged people before.

462
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,879
Yeah, us.

463
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,539
No offense, but we're not letting you
handle any drugs. You'll kill someone.

464
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,276
Oh, please, I'm an expert.

465
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,250
Remember the marshmallows in Thailand?

466
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,544
Yeah?

467

Wait.

469
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,793
So you're saying I would've died
if I had had four?

470

Nobody eats four marshmallows, Stu.

471

That insane theory is the only reason
I'm still alive?

Yes! And you're welcome, by the way.

for almost killing me.

- Thank you.

There's this guy Marshall.

We're sorry.

You're right. You are so right,

CHOW: My house.

583
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,116
Chow used to be on top of the world.

584
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,884
Had three beautiful homes
in three different countries.

585
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,257
But this one, my Mexican villa...

586
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,692
...this was my favorite.

587
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,295
And everything got fucked.

588
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,233

...sold at auction to highest bidders.

591
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,209
But I know something no one else knows.

592
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,041
This house is where I stashed the gold.

593
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,918
- Marshall's gold?
- Yep.

594
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,152
Hid it inside the basement wall.

595

No one knows it's there.

596
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,018
We're gonna go get it.

597
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,222
Wait. You mean break in?

598
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,126
Look, Marshall wants his gold.

599
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,997
And he's gonna hunt me down
until he gets it.

600
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,036
If we show up without it, he'll kill me.

601
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,174
We're not breaking in anywhere.

602
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,469
Not anywhere, Stu. My house.

603
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,476
It's piece of cake.

604
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,478
I know every square inch of this place.

605
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:18,684
The best part, the guy we're stealing
it from doesn't even know it's there.

606
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,080
So he'll never know it's gone.

Well, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
we're not breaking into this house.

610

This house is too small.

00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,320
I left my phone in the minivan.

874
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,925
Well, if you lost your phone, Phil,
I have that <i>Find My Phone</i> app.

875
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,091
We have bigger problems than that, Alan.

876
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,795
No, wait, wait, wait.
If your phone's in the minivan...

877
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,601
...and Chow has the minivan,
then your phone's with Chow!

878
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,540
You heard him.
We have bigger problems than that, Stu.

879
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,680
Alan, give me your phone. Quick.

880
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,746
- That's brilliant.
- Yes.

881
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,984
- Wait, what's your password?
- "Hey Phil."

882
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,380
- Yeah?
- No, that's it.

883
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,781
- What?
- That's my password.

884
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,115
"Hey Phil."

885
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:37,886
It is it.

886
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,590
Phil gets it.

887
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,424
Nothing worse than losing your phone.

888
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:47,328
You just saw a man get murdered.
Your brother-in-law is kidnapped.

889
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,969
You sure there's nothing worse?

890
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:50,930
You don't get it, Stu.

891
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:54,803
You just don't get it, do you?

892
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,741
I have over 60 apps on that phone.

893
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,676
What if I lost my phone?

894
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,374
Do you have any idea how much time
and man-hours it would take...

895
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,247
...to re-download those apps?

896
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:09,513
You are right.
I had not thought of that. Thank you.

897
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,818
Oh, God, it's not always about you, Stu!

898
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:13,889
It's locating.

899
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,831
- Oh, God, of course.
- What?

900
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,630
Where is he?

901
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,328
He's in fucking Vegas.

902
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,974
- Shotgun.
- Oh.

903
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,479
Oh, no.

904
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,672
Hey, Stu?

905
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,719
I don't enjoy talking to you that way.

906
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:43,289
I don't know why you insist
on making me blow my top.

907
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,127
We've been on a lot of
adventures together...

908
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,661
...but it seems like you haven't
learned anything.

909
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,195
Anything!

910
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,626
You think on it.

911
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,431
I'll be in the limo.

912
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,998
He's okay.

913
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:42,007
Someone needs to burn this place
to the ground.

914
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,944
I told myself I would never come back.

915
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,785
Well, don't worry.

916
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,983
It all ends tonight.

917
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,603
It says 200 yards up on the right.

918
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,199
And there it is.

919
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,740
Amazing.

920
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,784
Looks like he ditched it.

921
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,488
- It's open.
- No shit.

922
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,252
Well, look around.

923
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,658
Let's see if he left anything in here.

924
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,065
- I found the Demerol.
- Good. Keep it, we're gonna need it.

925
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,638
I got my phone. No fucking keys, though.

926
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:41,935
- Alan, anything?
- No, not even the gold.

927
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,441
- Why the fuck would Chow come down here?
- I know, right?

928
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,141
Why here?

929
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,883
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): <i>You can't match
the pure strength and power...</i>

930
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,579

931
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,148
<i>- Cena puts Punk down!</i>
CASSIE: - Oh! Ha, ha.

932
00:56:58,314 --> 00:56:59,725
Nice!

933
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,895
Excuse me.
Have you happened to see the driver...

934
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:07,591
...of that minivan that's out front?
Short Asian guy?

935
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,065
Yeah, they're all short.

936
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,831
Ha, ha. That's so true.

937
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:15,943
Right, but he may have been trying
to pawn some gold.

938
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,142
That would be my business, wouldn't it?

939
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:21,376
ALAN: I like your T-shirt.

940
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,914
I saw that show at the Forum.

941
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,487
He played "Captain Jack."

942
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:32,256
Yeah, I heard that was legendary.

943
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,860
Woman...

944
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,690
...you have no idea.

945
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,388
Try me.

946
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:44,364
Cassie, I'm hungry.
I thought you ordered Chinese.

947
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,373
Mom, I'm with a customer!

948
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,339
- You'll eat when I say it's time to eat!
- But the doctor...

949
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:52,378
If you don't reverse that right now,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

950
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:53,809

951

(ALAN CONTINUES LAUGHING)

952
00:57:58,174 --> 00:57:59,380
She's rude.

953
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:00,885
Thank you.

954
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,251
Yeah, you hear that, Ma? Nobody likes you!

955
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,687
Yeah, keep your mouth shut!

956
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,384
Whoa.

957
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:09,829
You're smart.

958
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:20,572
A Chinese guy came in here earlier.

959
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,403
It was pretty weird.

960
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,408
He pawned a gold brick.

961
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:27,070
The thing's worth 400 grand,
he took 18,000.

962
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:31,447
- Did he say where he was going?
- I'm sorry, was I talking to you?

963
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,949
He said he wanted three things:

964
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:42,119
He wanted some girls,
some guys and some bath salts.

965
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:46,028
I gave him a card for an escort service
and he took off.

966
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:52,730
Pretty high-end,
so good luck getting anything out of them.

967
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,769
Thank you.

968
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,604
(RETCHES)

969
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:50,988
We gotta go. We should go.

970
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,861
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

971
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,187
I'll get it, I'll get it. I'll get it.

972
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:41,738
Anything?

973
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:43,383
No, I'm still on hold.

974
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,385
Oh, look how happy this fucking guy is.

975
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:52,253
Have you ever witnessed a moment
with that much heat?

976
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,486
I mean, white-hot heat, bro!

977
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,458
No, it was pretty intense.

978
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:57,723
Yeah!

979
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,259
STU: Yeah, it's actually an emergency.

980
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,869
He has a thick Asian accent.

981
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,395
I totally get it...

982
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,440
...but this is a highly
unusual circumstance and...

983
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,610
Okay. All right.

984
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:13,605
It's an escort service.

985
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,545
They're not gonna tell us shit.

986
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,447
Maybe an escort would.

987
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,391
- You still have her number?
- Yeah, but...

988
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,225
...it'd be pretty awkward.

989
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,864
It's all we got.

990
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,368
She smiled at me again,
from inside the shop.

991
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:42,205
Ha, ha. This is the best day of my life.

Oh, my God, you guys.

- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.

- You look great.
- So do you! You're pregnant.

998
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,015
I feel so fat.

01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,214
Oh, please.

01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,020
Do you guys mind taking your shoes off?
I'm a germ freak.

- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

Alan.

1003
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,327
Alan, what are you doing?

1004
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,431
ALAN: Sorry.

1005
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,537
- Wow, you have a great house.
JADE: - Thank you.

His name's Jeff. You guys would love him.

- Hey.

01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:36,294
Jade is there a place we could talk
that's a little bit more private?

1016
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,557
Let's go in the kitchen.
You guys want coffee?

1017

hello to the little guy?

1020
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,234
Of course.

Nice stuff.

01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,300
Thanks. Jeff bought it for me.

Jeff. Who's that, your fake dad?

1024
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,809
Your name was Carlos once.

1025
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,503
Did you know that?

1026
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:27,841
No.

1027
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,483
Well, it was.

1028
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:32,118
And, frankly, it suits you better.

1029
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,379
Okay.

1030
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,091
Do you remember me?

1031
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,530
No.

1032
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:51,572
Are you my real dad?

1033
01:03:58,635 --> 01:03:59,841
Yes.

1034
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:03,917
I don't know. You gotta understand, I've
been out of that world a few years now.

1035
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,486
Yeah, of course. We totally get that.

1036
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:09,487
I mean, Jeff knows everything
and he's cool, but...

1037
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,717
We're just asking if you can call around...

1038
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:14,226
...just find out if anybody
might know where he is.

1039
01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:18,123
We could really use your help.

1040
01:04:19,223 --> 01:04:22,067
You used to love it
when I would carry you around.

1041
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:25,139
Sometimes I can still feel your little head
on my chest.

1042
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:31,405
So do you like this new Jeff guy?

1043
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:33,509
Yeah, he's nice.

1044
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,549
My dad was nice too.
We did everything together.

1045
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,680
He was my life partner, heh.

1046
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,923
I really let him down.

I can't remember what it's called,
but it's supposed to be magnificent.

That's what I was going for.

1456

- Maybe we'll just lose it.
- Yeah.

1457
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:35,051
Hey, Alan, I was just talking to Cassie.
She's an amazing woman.

1458
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,787
Oh, thank you for saying that.
She is an amazing woman.

1459

Um, we need to talk. Doug?
