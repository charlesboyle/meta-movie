00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,167
<font color="#ffff80">Where you going? Come here.</font>

3
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:49,842
<font color="#ffff80">Wait, wait, wait.</font>

4
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:53,513
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry. You're right.
We barely know each other.</font>

5
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,015
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe we should
have a drink and talk.</font>

6
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,475
<font color="#ffff80">Actually...</font>

7
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,561
<font color="#ffff80">...my zipper just got
caught on my necklace.</font>

8
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:02,355
<font color="#ffff80">But if you want to talk,
we can. Sure.</font>

9
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,691
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, great.</font>

10
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,859
<font color="#ffff80">Or we can talk after.</font>

11
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,362
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.
Yeah.</font>

12
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,814
<font color="#ffff80">Come on!
No!</font>

13
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,483
<font color="#ffff80">Let me tag along for a drink.
You said I'd like it.</font>

14
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,943
<font color="#ffff80">It's too soon.</font>

15
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,821
<font color="#ffff80">Once you meet my dad
and I meet your friends,</font>

16
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,447
<font color="#ffff80">they become
a part of this...</font>

17
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,991
<font color="#ffff80">...and I just want to stay in
our bubble a little longer.</font>

18
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,493
<font color="#ffff80">It's been eight weeks.</font>

19
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:21,869
<font color="#ffff80">You keeping track?</font>

20
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,332
<font color="#ffff80">Happy Anniversary</font>

21
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,001
<font color="#ffff80">I saw it and...</font>

22
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,670
<font color="#ffff80">...I thought of you.</font>

23
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,131
<font color="#ffff80">Open it.</font>

24
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,933
<font color="#ffff80">Good morning.</font>

25
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,644
<font color="#ffff80">Why do I schedule
breakfast meetings?</font>

26
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:48,479
<font color="#ffff80">For the bacon, I think.</font>

27
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,356
<font color="#ffff80">But you need to
lay off that until</font>

28
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,150
<font color="#ffff80">your cholesterol's down.
Why not turkey?</font>

29
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,694
<font color="#ffff80">Screw turkey.
I like pig.</font>

30
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,363
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I heard
a story on the news...</font>

31
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,825
<font color="#ffff80">...about a guy who ate an
undercooked pork chop and...</font>

32
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,829
<font color="#ffff80">...got a worm that made his
brain swell up super fast.</font>

33
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:05,913
<font color="#ffff80">Uh-huh.</font>

34
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:09,876
<font color="#ffff80">And to relieve the pressure, they had
to cut out a chunk of his skull.</font>

35
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,294
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, wow.</font>

36
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:15,590
<font color="#ffff80">Like a triangle of his skull, they
cut it right out of his head...</font>

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,342
<font color="#ffff80">...and they implanted it
in his groin...</font>

38
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,261
<font color="#ffff80">...so it wouldn't die.</font>

39
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,513
<font color="#ffff80">Otherwise,
his brain would have...</font>

40
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,932
<font color="#ffff80">...his head
would have exploded.</font>

41
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:26,058
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm-hmm.</font>

42
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,685
<font color="#ffff80">The skull was
holding his brain...</font>

43
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:32,356
<font color="#ffff80">...which was swelling, and his
head would have just exploded.</font>

44
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:36,402
<font color="#ffff80">Just think of that
next time you eat pig bacon.</font>

45
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:37,737
<font color="#ffff80">I will.</font>

46
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,365
<font color="#ffff80">Here you go.</font>

47
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:42,950
<font color="#ffff80">Thanks, sweetie.</font>

48
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,121
<font color="#ffff80">Thunder</font>

49
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:48,206
<font color="#ffff80">He needs training.</font>

50
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,458
<font color="#ffff80">I'm taking him to
obedience school today.</font>

51
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,377
<font color="#ffff80">Oh! And we need a check
for the painter, too.</font>

52
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:56,714
<font color="#ffff80">That reminds me, I need
you to sign these, honey.</font>

53
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,424
<font color="#ffff80">What are they?</font>

54
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,051
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, just some stuff
for the accountant.</font>

55
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,639
<font color="#ffff80">I don't even
understand this.</font>

56
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,140
<font color="#ffff80">I can't even read
these anymore.</font>

57
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:09,602
<font color="#ffff80">I already read it for us.
You just have to sign.</font>

58
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,854
<font color="#ffff80">No, I really
don't understand this.</font>

59
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,940
<font color="#ffff80">I feel like I need
to go to brain camp.</font>

60
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,775
<font color="#ffff80">Like, a brain camp.</font>

61
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,736
<font color="#ffff80">Where they give you
exercises for your brain?</font>

62
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,780
<font color="#ffff80">When people have
lazy eyes...</font>

63
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,782
<font color="#ffff80">...they get
their eyes worked out</font>

64
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,617
<font color="#ffff80">so they don't
have to wear glasses.</font>

65
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,701
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm-hmm.</font>

66
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:27,245
<font color="#ffff80">They should have
that for your brain.</font>

67
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,454
<font color="#ffff80">Like a brain camp.</font>

68
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,749
<font color="#ffff80">You could go lay on
a beach and get tan</font>

69
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,417
<font color="#ffff80">and drink gingko
balboa all day.</font>

70
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,461
<font color="#ffff80">You come back and
you're super smart.</font>

71
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,298
<font color="#ffff80">It's gingko biloba.
Balboa was Rocky.</font>

72
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:45,012
<font color="#ffff80">Right. See? See? That's why
I need to go to brain camp.</font>

73
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,646
<font color="#ffff80">Any messages?</font>

74
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:58,150
<font color="#ffff80">I don't think so. I've kind
of been in the zone here.</font>

75
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,944
<font color="#ffff80">You weren't going
to mention these?</font>

76
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,488
<font color="#ffff80">Why? They're the
first things you see.</font>

77
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,492
<font color="#ffff80">Micromacks? I thought Dave Cohen
was handling this merger.</font>

78
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,828
<font color="#ffff80">No. The client said
he was too emotional.</font>

79
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,997
<font color="#ffff80">They wanted a ruthless
law robot, so...</font>

80
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,207
<font color="#ffff80">I got Micromacks.</font>

81
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,293
<font color="#ffff80">Get Dave on the phone. I need
all pertinent materials...</font>

82
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,337
<font color="#ffff80">...and a set of
dates for deposition.</font>

83
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,131
<font color="#ffff80">Why do you work so hard?</font>

84
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,676
<font color="#ffff80">The point of being pretty
is that you don't have to.</font>

85
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,678
<font color="#ffff80">You don't see me worrying
about my job, do you?</font>

86
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,346
<font color="#ffff80">Unfortunately, no.</font>

87
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,558
<font color="#ffff80">That's because I have a Stan, okay?
He works.</font>

88
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,686
<font color="#ffff80">I come here because it's
like a hobby that pays well.</font>

89
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,480
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, by the way,
your dad called...</font>

90
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,151
<font color="#ffff80">...to confirm that you and he were
still on for drinks with "Mark."</font>

91
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,821
<font color="#ffff80">Who's Mark?
The guy I'm seeing.</font>

92
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,365
<font color="#ffff80">Obviously, but which one?
The only one.</font>

93
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,200
<font color="#ffff80">There's one guy?</font>

94
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,703
<font color="#ffff80">And you're calling
him Mark?</font>

95
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,538
<font color="#ffff80">You never
use their names!</font>

96
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,082
<font color="#ffff80">So, Model Man Boy
and Dr. Not So Smart...?</font>

97
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,125
<font color="#ffff80">Gone.</font>

98
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,209
<font color="#ffff80">The Hot Rabbi?</font>

99
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:59,170
<font color="#ffff80">And the Hot Rabbi's Cousin?
Cut them loose.</font>

100
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,588
<font color="#ffff80">You cleared the roster.</font>

101
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:01,881
<font color="#ffff80">I cleared the bench.</font>

102
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,132
<font color="#ffff80">Wow.</font>

103
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,384
<font color="#ffff80">You haven't dated
just one guy in a long time.</font>

104
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,054
<font color="#ffff80">It's not a big deal.
It's very new.</font>

105
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:12,558
<font color="#ffff80">No jinxies. I get it. It's good
that Mark doesn't have a nickname.</font>

106
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,895
<font color="#ffff80">It means he's still viable.
You haven't rejected him.</font>

107
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,521
<font color="#ffff80">He's not a donor kidney.</font>

108
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,398
<font color="#ffff80">Not the organ
I was thinking of.</font>

109
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,069
<font color="#ffff80">Hello?</font>

110
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,904
<font color="#ffff80">Hi. Red or white?</font>

111
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,239
<font color="#ffff80">Red or white what?
<i>Wine.</i></font>

112
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,532
<font color="#ffff80">Did you forget?</font>

113
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,576
<font color="#ffff80">Forget what?
Dinner with Phil.</font>

114
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,912
<font color="#ffff80">You told me
that was next week.</font>

115
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,082
<font color="#ffff80">I said next week
last week so it's this week.</font>

116
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,917
<font color="#ffff80">I got to work tonight.</font>

117
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,379
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Again? This is
the third night this week!</i></font>

118
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,299
<font color="#ffff80">The guys want to do dinner. So
I'll stay in the city tonight.</font>

119
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,761
<font color="#ffff80">Why don't I meet you
after your meeting?</font>

120
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:52,765
<font color="#ffff80"><i>I'll drive in to meet you in
the city after your meeting!</i></font>

121
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,392
<font color="#ffff80">No, you don't
want to do that.</font>

122
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:55,893
<font color="#ffff80">I don't mind!</font>

123
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,436
<font color="#ffff80"><i>We'll have so much fun!</i></font>

124
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,939
<font color="#ffff80"><i>We'll go to that hot chocolate
place in the morning.</i></font>

125
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:02,108
<font color="#ffff80"><i>We'll cuddle
and sleep in.</i></font>

126
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,276
<font color="#ffff80">Screw it.
I'm coming home.</font>

127
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,404
<font color="#ffff80">Really? Aw!
<i>Really.</i></font>

128
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,447
<font color="#ffff80">Family comes first. I'll
see you when I get back.</font>

129
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,949
<font color="#ffff80"><i>I'll make a steak
and salad--</i></font>

130
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,742
<font color="#ffff80">Shit!</font>

131
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,412
<font color="#ffff80">Wow,
look at you!</font>

132
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,416
<font color="#ffff80">How are you?
Not too great.</font>

133
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,709
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, what's wrong?</font>

134
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:20,918
<font color="#ffff80">The housekeeper called.</font>

135
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,796
<font color="#ffff80">A pipe burst in the bathroom--
I have to go handle it.</font>

136
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,590
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, no! You're going
to Connecticut now?</font>

137
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,260
<font color="#ffff80">I got to. There's two feet
of water in my basement.</font>

138
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,429
<font color="#ffff80">I can go with you.
That'd be fun.</font>

139
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,973
<font color="#ffff80">No, you go see your dad.</font>

140
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,100
<font color="#ffff80">I'll see if he can
meet tomorrow night.</font>

141
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,144
<font color="#ffff80">I won't be back
tomorrow night.</font>

142
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,272
<font color="#ffff80">And what about
meeting my dad?</font>

143
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:46,110
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry, baby.
I have to take a rain check.</font>

144
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,445
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, okay.</font>

145
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,321
<font color="#ffff80">Don't be mad.
I'm not being anything.</font>

146
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,656
<font color="#ffff80">What do you
want me to do?</font>

147
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,782
<font color="#ffff80">Go to Connecticut.</font>

148
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,118
<font color="#ffff80">Really?
Yeah, really.</font>

149
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,619
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

150
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:56,954
<font color="#ffff80">Call me when you're
done being pissed.</font>

151
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,789
<font color="#ffff80">That might be a while.</font>

152
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,675
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, hon.</font>

153
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,180
<font color="#ffff80">Here, you want this?
I'm switching to vodka.</font>

154
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:15,556
<font color="#ffff80">Ugh!</font>

155
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,974
<font color="#ffff80">Who orders gin?</font>

156
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,978
<font color="#ffff80">Uh, I couldn't read the menu because
I left my glasses at Nina's.</font>

157
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,855
<font color="#ffff80">Want to know
who Nina is?</font>

158
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,231
<font color="#ffff80">Not really.</font>

159
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,483
<font color="#ffff80">Indian girl.
Beautiful.</font>

160
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,651
<font color="#ffff80">Soft skin.
We met at Trader Joe's.</font>

161
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,737
<font color="#ffff80">She told me about
this naan bread.</font>

162
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,322
<font color="#ffff80">When did you
start eating naan?</font>

163
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,909
<font color="#ffff80">She's 24, a dance major. I eat
anything she tells me to.</font>

164
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,327
<font color="#ffff80">Ew!</font>

165
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:39,997
<font color="#ffff80">Where's your guy?</font>

166
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,415
<font color="#ffff80">I think we just broke up.</font>

167
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,334
<font color="#ffff80">No! How come?</font>

168
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,253
<font color="#ffff80">A pipe burst in his house and
he went back to Connecticut.</font>

169
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:48,839
<font color="#ffff80">And where in the story
does he act like a jerk?</font>

170
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,257
<font color="#ffff80">It's how he handled it.</font>

171
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,717
<font color="#ffff80">You're being paranoid.</font>

172
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,010
<font color="#ffff80">No, something feels off.</font>

173
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,013
<font color="#ffff80">And when I get this feeling,
I'm usually always right.</font>

174
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,100
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, please! Every relationship
I've ever had, something felt off.</font>

175
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,894
<font color="#ffff80">That's probably why you're
wrapping up divorce number five</font>

176
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,188
<font color="#ffff80">with one of my
sorority sisters.</font>

177
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,026
<font color="#ffff80">You really like
this guy, huh?</font>

178
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:12,196
<font color="#ffff80">So forget all this bullshit
and go surprise him.</font>

179
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,948
<font color="#ffff80">It's not bullshit.
It is.</font>

180
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:17,118
<font color="#ffff80">Put on something sexy, get
your ass out to Connecticut...</font>

181
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,453
<font color="#ffff80">...and fix that
young man's plumbing.</font>

182
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,769
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry,
you look good.</font>

183
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,563
<font color="#ffff80">He'll love it.
Who?</font>

184
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,773
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Whoever.</i></font>

185
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,943
<font color="#ffff80">Here you go.
Thanks for the ride.</font>

186
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,529
<font color="#ffff80">Need me to wait?</font>

187
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,947
<font color="#ffff80">Nah, I think I got it.</font>

188
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,100
<font color="#ffff80">Hi.
Hi.</font>

189
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,977
<font color="#ffff80">I'm looking for Mark.</font>

190
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,104
<font color="#ffff80">Oh. What's this about?</font>

191
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,815
<font color="#ffff80">I'm Carly. You must
be his housekeeper.</font>

192
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,109
<font color="#ffff80">No, I'm his wife, Kate.</font>

193
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,325
<font color="#ffff80">Is this some kind of
stripper-gram or something?</font>

194
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,744
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

195
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,622
<font color="#ffff80">No. No. I have
the wrong address.</font>

196
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,832
<font color="#ffff80">I'm looking for
a different Mark.</font>

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,001
<font color="#ffff80">Mark Kink.</font>

198
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:50,628
<font color="#ffff80">Mark King?</font>

199
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,463
<font color="#ffff80">No! No, no.</font>

200
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,840
<font color="#ffff80">He's a short guy? Bald?</font>

201
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,468
<font color="#ffff80">Lives a couple of
streets over on Clark.</font>

202
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:58,844
<font color="#ffff80">There is no Clark Street.</font>

203
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,012
<font color="#ffff80">Anyway"</font>

204
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,639
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh!Ah!Ah!</font>

205
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,973
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God!</font>

206
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,017
<font color="#ffff80">Shit.</font>

207
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,481
<font color="#ffff80">Um. I'll send you
a check for your urn.</font>

208
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,661
<font color="#ffff80">Can't forget this.</font>

209
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,376
<font color="#ffff80">What happened?</font>

210
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,963
<font color="#ffff80">It must be big. You were crazy
about him two days ago.</font>

211
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:19,967
<font color="#ffff80">It can't be the sex-- you were a lot
nicer and your hair was more shiny.</font>

212
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,386
<font color="#ffff80">He has a wife, okay?
He's married.</font>

213
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,471
<font color="#ffff80">You don't think
you can take her?</font>

214
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:27,224
<font color="#ffff80">That's not the point.
I don't do married guys.</font>

215
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,393
<font color="#ffff80">I don't need to wreck
someone's home for a date.</font>

216
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,729
<font color="#ffff80">It's not always a wreck. Stan
and I were married when we met.</font>

217
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,564
<font color="#ffff80">We weren't happy.
Now we are.</font>

218
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,399
<font color="#ffff80">You wrecked two marriages!</font>

219
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,652
<font color="#ffff80">First, one was mine, so that
doesn't count. Second“.</font>

220
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,071
<font color="#ffff80">...Stan's wife was fat,
with no sexual charisma.</font>

221
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,907
<font color="#ffff80">That marriage was doomed,
so it wasn't cheating.</font>

222
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,826
<font color="#ffff80">I don't think
that's how it works.</font>

223
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,079
<font color="#ffff80">But I think a married guy
is a perfect fit for you.</font>

224
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,665
<font color="#ffff80">Mark was able to lead
a whole other life</font>

225
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,584
<font color="#ffff80">without you
even noticing.</font>

226
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,836
<font color="#ffff80">You need a guy with
something to keep him busy.</font>

227
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,838
<font color="#ffff80">Not a wife!</font>

228
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,632
<font color="#ffff80">I don't do this. I'm
too old for this shit.</font>

229
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,762
<font color="#ffff80">I've been dating for decades!
I don't need this anymore!</font>

230
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,973
<font color="#ffff80">Somebody's being negative.
I'll go.</font>

231
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,101
<font color="#ffff80">I'll tell you what my mother
told me-- words to live by.</font>

232
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,147
<font color="#ffff80">Selfish people
live longer</font>

233
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:16,940
<font color="#ffff80">I'm just saying.</font>

234
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,949
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Miss Whitten? There's someone
here to see you--Kate King.</i></font>

235
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,005
<font color="#ffff80">Hi. I'm Kate.
I met you on Friday.</font>

236
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:45,010
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, I remember. Sorry about your urn.
Why are you here?</font>

237
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,347
<font color="#ffff80">Um, I found your number
in my husband's phone.</font>

238
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,807
<font color="#ffff80">So, um...</font>

239
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,226
<font color="#ffff80">Well, actually,
the phone bill,</font>

240
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,520
<font color="#ffff80">because I couldn't crack
the code on his password.</font>

241
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:58,482
<font color="#ffff80">Which is fitting, as obviously I don't
know anything going on in his life.</font>

242
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,193
<font color="#ffff80">But, anyhow, I'm here.</font>

243
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,529
<font color="#ffff80">I thought maybe
we could talk?</font>

244
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,031
<font color="#ffff80">No, we can't.
If you have any questions</font>

245
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,367
<font color="#ffff80">about your husband,
you should ask him.</font>

246
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,662
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, well, I would,
but I'm pretty sure...</font>

247
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:15,374
<font color="#ffff80">...he's lying to me and
sleeping with you.</font>

248
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,877
<font color="#ffff80">So...</font>

249
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,384
<font color="#ffff80">Am I right?</font>

250
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,802
<font color="#ffff80">Oh!</font>

251
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,554
<font color="#ffff80">Am I right?</font>

252
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,681
<font color="#ffff80">You're sleeping
with my husband?</font>

253
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,891
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry.
I had no idea. I swear.</font>

254
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,560
<font color="#ffff80">You're sleeping
with my husband?!</font>

255
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,019
<font color="#ffff80">Could you keep it down?</font>

256
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,312
<font color="#ffff80">Oh!</font>

257
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,565
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, gosh. Okay.</font>

258
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,900
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, oh...</font>

259
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,610
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh!</font>

260
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,863
<font color="#ffff80">I did not
expect this at all.</font>

261
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,783
<font color="#ffff80">I thought I would come here and
you would tell me I was crazy.</font>

262
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:54,121
<font color="#ffff80">I did not think that
I would be right at all.</font>

263
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,290
<font color="#ffff80">I mean,
maybe a little,</font>

264
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,625
<font color="#ffff80">in that too-horrible-
to-be-true kind of way.</font>

265
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,544
<font color="#ffff80">The say-the-awful-
thing-so-that-</font>

266
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,463
<font color="#ffff80">the-awful-thing-
doesn't-happen thing.</font>

267
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,047
<font color="#ffff80">Ooh! Oh!</font>

268
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,632
<font color="#ffff80">Does this--</font>

269
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,136
<font color="#ffff80">Does this open?
The window? Anywhere?</font>

270
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,973
<font color="#ffff80">There's got to be a little
latch or something.</font>

271
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,142
<font color="#ffff80">Does this window open?</font>

272
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,643
<font color="#ffff80">No, and for good reason.</font>

273
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,897
<font color="#ffff80">If you're having a panic attack,
go outside and get some air.</font>

274
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,316
<font color="#ffff80">Let me just lay
down for a minute.</font>

275
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,193
<font color="#ffff80">You sure
the window doesn't open?</font>

276
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,819
<font color="#ffff80">No. You'll be fine.</font>

277
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,490
<font color="#ffff80">This window. Just open it a little.
Crack it. Just crack it.</font>

278
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,492
<font color="#ffff80">If you don't mind...</font>

279
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,329
<font color="#ffff80">We're out of air. It's hot in here.
Just crack the window.</font>

280
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,916
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, I'll tell you anything
you want if you just leave.</font>

281
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,501
<font color="#ffff80">Anything?</font>

282
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,169
<font color="#ffff80">Anything.</font>

283
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,712
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

284
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,172
<font color="#ffff80">Help me up.</font>

285
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,269
<font color="#ffff80">How long have you and my husband
been seeing each other?</font>

286
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,355
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know--
a couple months.</font>

287
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,983
<font color="#ffff80">Did you just start

Okay, there you go.</font>

we could have some dinner?</font>

where I live?</font>

421

<font color="#ffff80">We followed you home.</font>

422
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:35,225
<font color="#ffff80">But I didn't want to show up
empty-handed, so I brought food.</font>

not get how weird this is?</font>

428
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:56,621
<font color="#ffff80">I just thought maybe we could
talk, because I, um...</font>

429
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,289
<font color="#ffff80">Because“.</font>

00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,668
<font color="#ffff80">Because my whole
world just blew up</font>

431
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,294
<font color="#ffff80">and I don't have a job!</font>

432
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,797
<font color="#ffff80">I have no money of my own!</font>

433
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:09,926
<font color="#ffff80">And I honestly do not know
what I'm going to do at all!</font>

434
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,928
<font color="#ffff80">I have no friends
to talk to because</font>

435
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,805
<font color="#ffff80">my friends are
Mark's friends...</font>

436
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,099
<font color="#ffff80">...and they'll blab!
You are literally</font>

437
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,268
<font color="#ffff80">the only person
in the world...</font>

438
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,520
<font color="#ffff80">...who knows what's
happening besides me!</font>

439
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,647
<font color="#ffff80">And if I keep
talking to myself...</font>

440
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:27,485
<font color="#ffff80">...about it, I'm going to go
crazy...for real. Like, really.</font>

441
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,155
<font color="#ffff80">I can't talk to you
until you stop crying.</font>

442
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,324
<font color="#ffff80">I want to.</font>

443
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,496
<font color="#ffff80">Let me just--
I'm sorry.</font>

444
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,498
<font color="#ffff80">I just am sad.</font>

445
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,001
<font color="#ffff80">Then cry on the inside,
like a winner.</font>

446
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,629
<font color="#ffff80">You can't care for yourself
unless you toughen up.</font>

447
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,883
<font color="#ffff80">As far as talking to someone
who won't blab,</font>

448
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,718
<font color="#ffff80">I can give you the names
of three different lawyers.</font>

449
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,136
<font color="#ffff80">Lawyers cost money.</font>

450
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,513
<font color="#ffff80">You have money. You have
half of what Mark has.</font>

451
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,057
<font color="#ffff80">Okay. Thank you.</font>

452
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,725
<font color="#ffff80">You're welcome.
Are we done?</font>

453
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,311
<font color="#ffff80">Done? That wasn't
even a conversation.</font>

454
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,980
<font color="#ffff80">You mostly just yelled
at me the whole time.</font>

455
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,360
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, look.</font>

456
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,655
<font color="#ffff80">If I let you in,
we are not braiding</font>

457
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:14,574
<font color="#ffff80">each other's hair
and drinking Cosmos.</font>

458
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,576
<font color="#ffff80">You have one hour.
Okay.</font>

459
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,912
<font color="#ffff80">And I get first dibs
on what's in the bag.</font>

460
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,497
<font color="#ffff80">Sure thing.</font>

461
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,750
<font color="#ffff80">Have a seat, but please keep
your dog off of my furniture.</font>

462
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,261
<font color="#ffff80">Thunder...</font>

463
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,430
<font color="#ffff80">...get down.</font>

464
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:40,100
<font color="#ffff80">Get down. Get down.</font>

465
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,477
<font color="#ffff80">Down!</font>

466
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,939
<font color="#ffff80">Okay. That's great.</font>

467
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,441
<font color="#ffff80">He's juSt a PUPPY-</font>

468
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,280
<font color="#ffff80">Have a seat.</font>

469
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:58,201
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want to sit someplace
where you and Mark had sex.</font>

470
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,455
<font color="#ffff80">ls the ottoman okay?</font>

471
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,207
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm...</font>

472
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,043
<font color="#ffff80">What about the chair?</font>

473
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,801
<font color="#ffff80">If I'm being honest...</font>

474
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,220
<font color="#ffff80">Are you serious?
It's a window!</font>

475
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,639
<font color="#ffff80">People can see in here!</font>

476
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,642
<font color="#ffff80">You just have to pick a spot
and be okay with it.</font>

477
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,061
<font color="#ffff80">Just have a seat.</font>

478
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,240
<font color="#ffff80">ls Mark calling?</font>

479
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:41,828
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, it is.</font>

480
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,247
<font color="#ffff80">Mark's in Miami.
Why is he calling you?</font>

481
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,166
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't know
he was in Miami.</font>

482
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,792
<font color="#ffff80">Why is he
calling you at all?</font>

483
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,335
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know that, either.</font>

484
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:52,088
<font color="#ffff80">I don't call a boyfriend back
after I find out he has a wife.</font>

485
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,756
<font color="#ffff80">So you haven't
called him, full silent</font>

486
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,300
<font color="#ffff80">treatment and
he's still calling?</font>

487
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,260
<font color="#ffff80">I'm pretty sure that's
why he's still calling.</font>

488
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,138
<font color="#ffff80">What if he's calling to say he loves
you and wants to be with you?</font>

489
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,222
<font color="#ffff80">I don't care.</font>

490
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,600
<font color="#ffff80">Well, what if he's
in love with you?</font>

491
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,852
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, has he ever
said he loves you?</font>

492
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,479
<font color="#ffff80">Has he talked to you
like that, or has he...?</font>

493
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,024
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, do you think
that he still loves me?</font>

494
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,529
<font color="#ffff80">If we're going to do this,
I need a drink.</font>

495
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,366
<font color="#ffff80">I get it.
Get what?</font>

496
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,205
<font color="#ffff80">You have the perfect place, and
you are the perfect girl...</font>

497
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:29,042
<font color="#ffff80">...and you could probably take off
all your clothes right now...</font>

498
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:32,462
<font color="#ffff80">...and have no flab
and not need a wax...</font>

499
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,381
<font color="#ffff80">...or anything and
just be ready to go.</font>

500
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:39,052
<font color="#ffff80">My situation's pretty situated
at all times, it's true.</font>

501
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,387
<font color="#ffff80">And see, lam not situated.</font>

502
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:45,058
<font color="#ffff80">I can't even remember
to shave my legs.</font>

503
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,728
<font color="#ffff80">I need like at least a week
of prep, minimum.</font>

504
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,314
<font color="#ffff80">Doesn't Mark see you
naked all the time?</font>

505
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,900
<font color="#ffff80">No.
He doesn't?</font>

506
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,319
<font color="#ffff80">No. It's...</font>

507
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,571
<font color="#ffff80">Nooooo.</font>

508
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,908
<font color="#ffff80">What's it like? Is it
like a '70s situation?</font>

509
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,743
<font color="#ffff80">It's like...</font>

510
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:07,497
<font color="#ffff80">...now I'm totally serious,
like...not...</font>

511
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,502
<font color="#ffff80">No man likes that.</font>

512
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,588
<font color="#ffff80">It's like a...
just not--</font>

513
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,007
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not saying
you have to be bald</font>

514
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,093
<font color="#ffff80">or anything.
Just like a fig leaf.</font>

515
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:21,886
<font color="#ffff80">That's all they want.</font>

516
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,846
<font color="#ffff80">They just need to have...</font>

517
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:27,517
<font color="#ffff80">...a pretty little
patch of happiness.</font>

518
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,895
<font color="#ffff80">You know,
lam like...</font>

519
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,898
<font color="#ffff80">...Martha Stewart...</font>

520
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,235
<font color="#ffff80">...but with big underpants.</font>

521
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,071
<font color="#ffff80">Let me tell you something
about Martha Stewart.</font>

522
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,699
<font color="#ffff80">She handled prison
like a boss!</font>

523
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,243
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you. Right?</font>

524
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:49,914
<font color="#ffff80">I still think I'm not ready to
compete with women like you.</font>

525
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,333
<font color="#ffff80">Though technically,
I have been competing</font>

526
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,419
<font color="#ffff80">with women like you
and just didn't know it.</font>

527
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,046
<font color="#ffff80">We're not in competition.
We got played</font>

528
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,590
<font color="#ffff80">by the same guy.
I call it a tie.</font>

529
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:02,093
<font color="#ffff80">Tequila or vodka?</font>

530
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,763
<font color="#ffff80"><i>I can't believe
I'm in the mistress's closet.</i></font>

531
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:10,768
<font color="#ffff80">lam not a mistress. A mistress
knows she's dating a married man.</font>

532
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,272
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't know, so I'm not a mistress.
Can you say that, please?</font>

533
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:17,066
<font color="#ffff80">Seriously, can you please
say I'm not a mistress?</font>

534
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,985
<font color="#ffff80">Oh. You're not a mistress.
Thank you.</font>

535
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,653
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry.</font>

536
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:24,324
<font color="#ffff80">Try these on. These
ones are very special.</font>

537
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,327
<font color="#ffff80">I don't think we have the
same size foot.</font>

538
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,830
<font color="#ffff80">This looks like
a box of bungee cords.</font>

539
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,166
<font color="#ffff80">What it does is
hold your tits up.</font>

540
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,001
<font color="#ffff80">That's so awesome.</font>

541
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,711
<font color="#ffff80">This is like
a logic puzzle.</font>

542
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,004
<font color="#ffff80">It would look
so hot on you.</font>

543
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,089
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know why
men find these sexy.</font>

544
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,133
<font color="#ffff80">Mouse hammock.</font>

545
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,887
<font color="#ffff80">Wake up. You're making
out with your dog.</font>

546
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:30,848
<font color="#ffff80">Ugh.</font>

547
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,059
<font color="#ffff80">What is he doing?</font>

548
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,061
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, no.</font>

549
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,146
<font color="#ffff80">No,no,no!</font>

550
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,693
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry.
Ugh!</font>

551
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,071
<font color="#ffff80">Damn it!</font>

552
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,824
<font color="#ffff80">You want me to get it?</font>

553
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,577
<font color="#ffff80">I'm really sorry.
I thought I had him that time.</font>

554
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,995
<font color="#ffff80">Send me the cleaning bill.</font>

555
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,247
<font color="#ffff80">Believe it</font>

556
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,918
<font color="#ffff80">You'll send me
the lawyers' names?</font>

557
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,003
<font color="#ffff80">You still want those?
Yeah.</font>

558
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,923
<font color="#ffff80">Listen, Mark's shady. He
finds out you have a lawyer,</font>

559
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,259
<font color="#ffff80">you become the enemy.
If he thinks...</font>

560
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,929
<font color="#ffff80">...you're clueless, you have an edge.
Get your ducks in a row.</font>

561
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,432
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you for everything.
I really appreciate it.</font>

562
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,016
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. That's fine.</font>

563
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:17,270
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you so much.</font>

564
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:18,771
<font color="#ffff80">No problem.
You're welcome.</font>

565
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:20,940
<font color="#ffff80">Bye.</font>

566
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:32,952
<font color="#ffff80">Holy shit.</font>

567
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,801
<font color="#ffff80">Shit.</font>

568
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:55,892
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you'd have your phone off.</font>

569
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,643
<font color="#ffff80">Then why even call?</font>

570
00:32:57,894 --> 00:32:59,395
<font color="#ffff80">Why did you have
your phone on?</font>

571
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,980
<font color="#ffff80">What do you need, Kate?</font>

572
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,815
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Well, it's not
a big deal, but...</i></font>

573
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:06,986
<font color="#ffff80">...you know how sometimes
you get like a...</font>

574
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,071
<font color="#ffff80"><i>...just a hint of
a zit and you...</i></font>

575
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,157
<font color="#ffff80">...pick at it
a little bit, and...</font>

576
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,493
<font color="#ffff80">...you keep picking at it...</font>

577
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,828
<font color="#ffff80">...until it becomes this...</font>

578
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:20,333
<font color="#ffff80">...soul-sucking, life-ruining
face crater that you...</font>

579
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,418
<font color="#ffff80">...absolutely cannot hide?</font>

580
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,629
<font color="#ffff80">You're calling
because you got a zit?</font>

581
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:27,673
<font color="#ffff80">Not exactly.</font>

582
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,676
<font color="#ffff80">What the hell did you do?</font>

583
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,178
<font color="#ffff80">It was an accident.</font>

584
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,096
<font color="#ffff80">An accident?
I know.</font>

585
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:35,431
<font color="#ffff80">Were you on PCP?</font>

586
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,600
<font color="#ffff80"><i>KATE".
Okay, here's what happened.</i></font>

587
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,686
<font color="#ffff80"><i>I started digging around.
Everything was locked.</i></font>

588
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:43,940
<font color="#ffff80"><i>And I started thinking,
maybe he is shady.</i></font>

589
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,359
<font color="#ffff80"><i>And then I started
thinking that this</i></font>

590
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,694
<font color="#ffff80"><i>whole room is filled
with lies and secrets.</i></font>

591
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,197
<font color="#ffff80">It was like this
red mist came over me.</font>

592
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,032
<font color="#ffff80">So...</font>

593
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,285
<font color="#ffff80">You know how I told you to
get your ducks in a row?</font>

594
00:33:56,953 --> 00:33:58,704
<font color="#ffff80">Well, this isn't
putting your ducks in a row.</font>

595
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,373
<font color="#ffff80">This is putting your ducks
in a wood chipper!</font>

596
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:01,958
<font color="#ffff80">Hold on.</font>

597
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,043
<font color="#ffff80">Shit, he's early.
Who?</font>

598
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,378
<font color="#ffff80">My brother, Phil.</font>

599
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,088
<font color="#ffff80">Don't mention
the whole mistress thing.</font>

600
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,631
<font color="#ffff80">But it's such
an icebreaker.</font>

601
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,386
<font color="#ffff80">Who's this?</font>

602
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,222
<font color="#ffff80">I'm Carmela,
Kate's decorator.</font>

603
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,306
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

604
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,975
<font color="#ffff80">When did you fire Joel?</font>

605
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:21,227
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't.
No, he's, um...</font>

606
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,064
<font color="#ffff80">She's doing all of the stuff,
the feng shui...in the house.</font>

607
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,567
<font color="#ffff80">We met in Hong Kong.
I told you.</font>

608
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,152
<font color="#ffff80">We bonded over dim sum
and spatial reasoning.</font>

609
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:32,405
<font color="#ffff80">Two of my favorite things.</font>

610
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:36,742
<font color="#ffff80">That's so smart and funny!
That's really witty.</font>

611
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,619
<font color="#ffff80">So, this is
my brother.</font>

612
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:39,912
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, you said that.</font>

613
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,164
<font color="#ffff80">He's a contractor.
Oh, a contractor.</font>

614
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:43,749
<font color="#ffff80">He'll look at
the office while you go.</font>

615
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,668
<font color="#ffff80">Unless you want to stay.</font>

616
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,922
<font color="#ffff80">I would love to, but it's
kind of a tricky project...</font>

617
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,216
<font color="#ffff80">...and I don't want
to complicate things.</font>

618
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,427
<font color="#ffff80">But it was really
nice meeting you.</font>

619
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,430
<font color="#ffff80">You, too.
I hope I see you again soon.</font>

620
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,265
<font color="#ffff80">Carmela? Really?</font>

621
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,684
<font color="#ffff80">Did you and Tony
enjoy Hong Kong?</font>

622
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,352
<font color="#ffff80">Or did Big Pussy and Meadow
miss you too much?</font>

623
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:06,272
<font color="#ffff80">You will thank me for using a fake name.
You want Phil...</font>

624
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:09,191
<font color="#ffff80">...mentioning your new
friend Carly to Mark?</font>

625
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,444
<font color="#ffff80">No. So you're welcome.
By the way,</font>

626
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,613
<font color="#ffff80">what is up with
your hot brother?</font>

627
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:17,450
<font color="#ffff80">No! No, you can't have my
husband and my brother!</font>

628
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,786
<font color="#ffff80">No! That's being very greedy.</font>

629
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,955
<font color="#ffff80">I think you're being greedy. Me?</font>

630
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,874
<font color="#ffff80">He's your brother.
What would you do with him?</font>

631
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:28,210
<font color="#ffff80">So is everybody like hot-hot
Phil in your family,</font>

632
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,795
<font color="#ffff80">or are most of them
like you?</font>

633
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,213
<font color="#ffff80">I'm cute-cute Kate.</font>

634
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,466
<font color="#ffff80">What about your father?
Leave Dad out of this!</font>

635
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:34,717
<font color="#ffff80">I bet he's hot.</font>

636
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,303
<font color="#ffff80">You and your vagina
need to just--</font>

637
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:52,777
<font color="#ffff80">Kate?</font>

638
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,621
<font color="#ffff80">Surprise!</font>

639
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,249
<font color="#ffff80">I started redecorating.
What do you think?</font>

640
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,418
<font color="#ffff80">What happened to
just painting it red?</font>

641
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,087
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, red is so cliché.</font>

642
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,423
<font color="#ffff80">I would expect that from other guys
in their offices, but not you.</font>

643
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:19,470
<font color="#ffff80">You deserve something different,
something better than that.</font>

644
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,472
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.
It's good, right?</font>

645
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:24,141
<font color="#ffff80">I think it's great.
You do?</font>

646
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,811
<font color="#ffff80">I love it.
Really?</font>

647
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:30,272
<font color="#ffff80">Because you know how I get carried
away with all the colors--</font>

648
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,320
<font color="#ffff80">I missed you.</font>

649
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:40,491
<font color="#ffff80">How was Miami?</font>

650
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,785
<font color="#ffff80">Miami was amazing.</font>

651
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,496
<font color="#ffff80">The guys loved your
gift card swap idea.</font>

652
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:46,831
<font color="#ffff80">SwipeSwitch?</font>

653
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,290
<font color="#ffff80">And guess what?
What?</font>

654
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:49,500
<font color="#ffff80">Guess.</font>

655
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,335
<font color="#ffff80">What? What?</font>

656
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:55,464
<font color="#ffff80">They're going to put in
half a million as seed money.</font>

657
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:57,341
<font color="#ffff80">Really?!
That's right!</font>

658
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,969
<font color="#ffff80">We did it, we did it!</font>

659
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:02,179
<font color="#ffff80">Oh! Team King!</font>

660
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,683
<font color="#ffff80">I'll tell you all
about it at dinner.</font>

661
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,976
<font color="#ffff80">With me?</font>

662
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,854
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. We're celebrating.
Just let me clean up.</font>

663
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,823
<font color="#ffff80"><i>How's it going?
Not good.</i></font>

664
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,032
<font color="#ffff80"><i>What's wrong?</i></font>

665
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:23,200
<font color="#ffff80">We have a situation.</font>

666
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,286
<font color="#ffff80">If you killed him,
don't tell me.</font>

667
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,204
<font color="#ffff80">I can't defend you
if I know you did it.</font>

668
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,039
<font color="#ffff80"><i>No, I didn't kill him.</i></font>

669
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,042
<font color="#ffff80">It's something
that rhymes with...</font>

670
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:33,878
<font color="#ffff80">...schlintercourse.</font>

671
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,172
<font color="#ffff80">What?!
You had sex with him?</font>

672
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,216
<font color="#ffff80">No! Of course not.
It's barely dark outside.</font>

673
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:42,845
<font color="#ffff80"><i>He's just on a high from
the business trip and...</i></font>

674
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,433
<font color="#ffff80">...he's got that look
in his eyes, that...</font>

675
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,728
<font color="#ffff80">...you know, that--</font>

676
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,023
<font color="#ffff80">I just don't know
if I can hold out.</font>

677
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:55,566
<font color="#ffff80">What is going on?</font>

678
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,694
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know!
There's been wine, and...</font>

679
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,863
<font color="#ffff80">...hand-holding during dinner.</font>

680
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:02,907
<font color="#ffff80">It just felt so good
to be touched, you know?</font>

681
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,243
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, I do, because
he used to touch me, too.</font>

682
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,204
<font color="#ffff80">Ugh! Why do you say that?</font>

683
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,080
<font color="#ffff80"><i>A</i> lot. I don't
want to hear that.</font>

684
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,415
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Then why call me?
For permission?</i></font>

685
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,583
<font color="#ffff80">No!</font>

686
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,877
<font color="#ffff80">If you want to have sex with
your husband,do it</font>

687
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,379
<font color="#ffff80">I'm wondering, what if I
keep my clothes on...</font>

688
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,215
<font color="#ffff80"><i>...while we're having sex?
</i> Really?</font>

689
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:24,386
<font color="#ffff80">What if the top part of me hated
him, while the bottom part of me...</font>

690
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,055
<font color="#ffff80"><i>...did all the dirty work?</i></font>

691
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:27,473
<font color="#ffff80">What if he just
put it in halfway...</font>

692
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,434
<font color="#ffff80">...and then I took a really hot
bath after and really cleaned up?</font>

693
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,061
<font color="#ffff80">You're making a mistake.</font>

694
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:33,270
<font color="#ffff80">I'm trying not to.</font>

695
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:34,897
<font color="#ffff80">Not really.
lam!</font>

696
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,609
<font color="#ffff80">If you're going to cave every
time he pays attention to you...</font>

697
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:40,110
<font color="#ffff80"><i>...leave me out of it.</i></font>

698
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,321
<font color="#ffff80">You can waste your own time,
but I'm done.</font>

699
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,948
<font color="#ffff80">Fine! Be done.</font>

700
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,574
<font color="#ffff80">I am done.
I'm done.</font>

701
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,076
<font color="#ffff80">This is me being done.
Fine.</font>

702
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:48,244
<font color="#ffff80">Good-bye.</font>

703
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,411
<font color="#ffff80">Forget I called.</font>

704
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,830
<font color="#ffff80">Good-bye.</font>

705
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:00,464
<font color="#ffff80">Kate...</font>

706
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,467
<font color="#ffff80">...you hold it together.</font>

707
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,970
<font color="#ffff80">He is awful.</font>

708
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:20,359
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God.</font>

709
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,320
<font color="#ffff80">I've missed you.</font>

710
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,033
<font color="#ffff80">You taste good.</font>

711
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:29,618
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God.</font>

712
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:31,787
<font color="#ffff80">And you smell so good.</font>

713
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,961
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, hold on one second.
Just one second.</font>

714
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,468
<font color="#ffff80">I'll be right back.</font>

715
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,138
<font color="#ffff80">Don't move.</font>

716
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,005
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, baby.</font>

717
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,715
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Hi.
What are you doing?</i></font>

718
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,383
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, I'm still working.</font>

719
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,554
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Well, I'm not working.
And I am so freaking hot.</i></font>

720
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,390
<font color="#ffff80">Um...</font>

721
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:47,404
<font color="#ffff80">I wish.
What are you doing?</font>

722
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:51,533
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, baby, send me a
picture, will you?</font>

723
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,661
<font color="#ffff80">Send me a few pictures.</font>

724
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:55,245
<font color="#ffff80"><i>I'll send tons.</i></font>

725
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:59,541
<font color="#ffff80">We'll have the whole weekend in
the Hamptons to work that out.</font>

726
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,210
<font color="#ffff80"><i>I miss you.</i></font>

727
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:02,753
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, I miss you, too.</font>

728
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,922
<font color="#ffff80"><i>I miss you.</i></font>

729
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,715
<font color="#ffff80">I miss you.</font>

730
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:14,056
<font color="#ffff80"><i>L</i> I got to go.
I got to go, baby</font>

731
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:25,567
<font color="#ffff80">Bill, I told you,
don't call me at night!</font>

732
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,569
<font color="#ffff80">I'll call you tomorrow.</font>

733
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,572
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry, honey.</font>

734
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:33,993
<font color="#ffff80">It's okay. The wine hit me wrong--
I have a splitting headache.</font>

735
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,577
<font color="#ffff80">Really?</font>

736
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:39,248
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe I can make
it go away, huh?</font>

737
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,500
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry, honey,
not tonight.</font>

738
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:06,859
<font color="#ffff80"><i>KATE".
"Sorry for the tough love."</i></font>

739
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,279
<font color="#ffff80">"Do what you need to do. I support you"?
Yeah, right.</font>

740
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:11,613
<font color="#ffff80">Bitch.</font>

741
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:13,532
<font color="#ffff80">You Okay?
Yep.</font>

742
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:15,951
<font color="#ffff80">You sure? You're
talking to your phone.</font>

743
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,536
<font color="#ffff80">I'm fine.</font>

744
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,122
<font color="#ffff80">So, how's Carmela?</font>

745
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:22,124
<font color="#ffff80">Bad!
How come?</font>

746
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:27,212
<font color="#ffff80">Because I said so. Why, do you like her?
Because she is fired!</font>

747
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:29,298
<font color="#ffff80">What's going on with you?</font>

748
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,341
<font color="#ffff80">I'll take a stab
and say it's because</font>

749
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,302
<font color="#ffff80">you realized
feng shui is bullshit.</font>

750
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:36,513
<font color="#ffff80">You shouldn't pay for that.</font>

751
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:39,641
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, you know what?
Feng shui rules.</font>

752
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,144
<font color="#ffff80">There are so many
people in the world</font>

753
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,480
<font color="#ffff80">and in China who
love feng shui.</font>

754
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,149
<font color="#ffff80">Feng shui is not
what you think it is!</font>

755
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:49,651
<font color="#ffff80">And I hate that you
keep saying it's dumb!</font>

756
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:50,986
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't mean it.</font>

757
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,572
<font color="#ffff80">Feng shui is good
'cause it's important...</font>

758
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,449
<font color="#ffff80">...to know where
to place things</font>

759
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,159
<font color="#ffff80">in order to make
yourself feel better.</font>

760
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:01,538
<font color="#ffff80">Katie. Sweetheart?</font>

761
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,333
<font color="#ffff80">Katie?</font>

762
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,834
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing?</font>

763
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:07,419
<font color="#ffff80">See? See?!</font>

764
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,130
<font color="#ffff80">This is what happens
when Carly makes</font>

765
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,674
<font color="#ffff80">me cry on the inside
like a winner!</font>

766
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,344
<font color="#ffff80">Who's Carly?</font>

767
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,137
<font color="#ffff80">She's Mark's girlfriend--</font>

768
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:19,431
<font color="#ffff80">and not "friend friend,"
like "boning friend!"</font>

769
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:20,849
<font color="#ffff80">Mark's cheating on you?!</font>

770
00:43:21,058 --> 00:43:22,392
<font color="#ffff80">Like fifty times at least.</font>

771
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:23,602
<font color="#ffff80">Are you serious?
Or more!</font>

772
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,521
<font color="#ffff80">With who?
Carmela!</font>

773
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,356
<font color="#ffff80">But her real name is Carly.</font>

774
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:29,525
<font color="#ffff80">Is this some Tyler
Durden <i>Fight</i> Club thing?</font>

775
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:31,693
<font color="#ffff80">Are you Carly?
No.</font>

776
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:32,903
<font color="#ffff80">Is anyone Carly?</font>

777
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,863
<font color="#ffff80">Please focus.
I am focused!</font>

778
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:38,700
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want to keep explaining this.
Carmela is Carly!</font>

779
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:40,953
<font color="#ffff80">The feng shui
spatialist chick.</font>

780
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,538
<font color="#ffff80">Yes.
Oh, my God!</font>

781
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,624
<font color="#ffff80">Are you okay?</font>

782
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,376
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

783
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,879
<font color="#ffff80">I never liked that guy.
I never liked him.</font>

784
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,967
<font color="#ffff80">I told you that before you married him.
What a piece of shit!</font>

785
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:58,637
<font color="#ffff80">Did you know she was his mistress
when she was in the house?</font>

786
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,390
<font color="#ffff80">I thought she was
his ex-mistress, but...</font>

787
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,892
<font color="#ffff80">...it turns out they're
still seeing each other.</font>

788
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,561
<font color="#ffff80">That makes sense.</font>

789
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:07,062
<font color="#ffff80">I heard him on
the phone with her...</font>

790
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:10,065
<font color="#ffff80">...then he comes to me,
"Oh, I have to go golfing."</font>

791
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:14,570
<font color="#ffff80">In Connecticut. "With the
Canadian crew." Which is code.</font>

792
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,488
<font color="#ffff80">For what?
Ca.</font>

793
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,824
<font color="#ffff80">Ca?
Ca.</font>

794
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:20,993
<font color="#ffff80">Ca?
Caaarly.</font>

795
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:24,079
<font color="#ffff80">Carly. Carmela. You're
talking about Carmela.</font>

796
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:27,749
<font color="#ffff80">She doesn't even know that I
know they're still together.</font>

797
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,751
<font color="#ffff80">She pretends
to be my friend,</font>

798
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,670
<font color="#ffff80">but she's spying on me,
like a double agent.</font>

799
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,088
<font color="#ffff80">And you let her
because...?</font>

800
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,007
<font color="#ffff80">That's how you run
a double agent.</font>

801
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:38,760
<font color="#ffff80">I don't even know if she's American.
I don't know.</font>

802
00:44:39,011 --> 00:44:41,847
<font color="#ffff80">Katie, if she's full of
shit, call her out on it.</font>

803
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,766
<font color="#ffff80">Deal with her. And then
deal with the real problem.</font>

804
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,102
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, Mark.
Yes! Mark.</font>

805
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:50,939
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. Okay.
Right. Mmm-hmm.</font>

806
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,108
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you going?
I don't know.</font>

807
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,361
<font color="#ffff80">I'm really happy
we're doing this.</font>

808
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:57,863
<font color="#ffff80">Are you?</font>

809
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,950
<font color="#ffff80">How do you feel? I don't know.
How do you feel?</font>

810
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,536
<font color="#ffff80">I fee like I owe you an
apology for the other night.</font>

811
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,455
<font color="#ffff80">Do you?
Yeah.</font>

812
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,041
<font color="#ffff80">Sometimes I can be
more tough than love.</font>

813
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,375
<font color="#ffff80">Can you?</font>

814
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:15,130
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. I just wanted to clear
the air, and say that...</font>

815
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,717
<font color="#ffff80">...whatever happens between you
and Mark is your business.</font>

816
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:20,802
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, is it?</font>

817
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,305
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. Are you okay?</font>

818
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,807
<font color="#ffff80">Are you still sleeping
with my husband?</font>

819
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,643
<font color="#ffff80">What?
You heard me.</font>

820
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,561
<font color="#ffff80">Unbelievable.</font>

821
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,397
<font color="#ffff80">I was crazy to think
we could be friends.</font>

822
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:34,650
<font color="#ffff80">You don't get to walk out.
Don't ice me out.</font>

823
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:37,486
<font color="#ffff80">No. No. You can't--
What? What?</font>

824
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:40,322
<font color="#ffff80">You can't ice me out.
I'm going to ice you out.</font>

825
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,157
<font color="#ffff80">Here's my ice shield.</font>

826
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,742
<font color="#ffff80">Then what,
you pull out my weave?</font>

827
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,244
<font color="#ffff80">Just tell me the truth!</font>

828
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:48,413
<font color="#ffff80">You want to know the truth?
Your husband sucks!</font>

829
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:53,168
<font color="#ffff80">I am not sleeping with him! And the
fact you think I would, really hurts!</font>

830
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:56,546
<font color="#ffff80">Well, shit! I don't know!
All I know is what</font>

831
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:59,049
<font color="#ffff80">I heard,
and he's meeting somebody!</font>

832
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,677
<font color="#ffff80">Well, not me! So he's
cheating on both of us.</font>

833
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,179
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God, that's it!
He's cheating on us!</font>

834
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:06,056
<font color="#ffff80">I was kidding about that.</font>

835
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:09,851
<font color="#ffff80">If he's not seeing you-- I'm so
sorry I said that, that sucks--</font>

836
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,522
<font color="#ffff80">--but if he isn't seeing you,
he's seeing someone else.</font>

837
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,191
<font color="#ffff80">Think about it.
Between the two of us...</font>

838
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,236
<font color="#ffff80">...he has the perfect woman.
What else would he need?</font>

839
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:22,239
<font color="#ffff80">The one thing
we're not giving him--sex.</font>

840
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,546
<font color="#ffff80">Katie?</font>

841
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:38,714
<font color="#ffff80">Time to go, sweetie.</font>

842
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:42,551
<font color="#ffff80">Okay. Are you all packed for
your business meetings?</font>

843
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,095
<font color="#ffff80">I hate working
on the weekends.</font>

844
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:48,432
<font color="#ffff80">I feel bad for you.
Let me walk you out.</font>

845
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:57,733
<font color="#ffff80">Have a great weekend.</font>

846
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,401
<font color="#ffff80">You, too!</font>

847
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:01,069
<font color="#ffff80">Bye!</font>

848
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:03,739
<font color="#ffff80">You look gorgeous today.
Thanks, honey.</font>

849
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:06,408
<font color="#ffff80">Safe flight!</font>

850
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,452
<font color="#ffff80">I'll call you
when I get in.</font>

851
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,412
<font color="#ffff80">Don't forget.</font>

852
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:56,291
<font color="#ffff80">Let's go! He's probably
halfway there already!</font>

853
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,460
<font color="#ffff80">We're going to lose him.</font>

854
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,337
<font color="#ffff80">What's Thunder doing?</font>

855
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:03,465
<font color="#ffff80">No,no,no,no,no!
Are you kidding me? No!</font>

856
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:05,967
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry.</font>

857
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:09,971
<font color="#ffff80">Jesus, that was... I think that
might have been his balls.</font>

858
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:12,140
<font color="#ffff80">It was-- Ugh!</font>

859
00:48:55,225 --> 00:48:58,687
<font color="#ffff80">I don't think we should rush
into anything. What are you doing?</font>

860
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:07,612
<font color="#ffff80">When you're divvying up friends
in the divorce, keep this one.</font>

861
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,454
<font color="#ffff80">You won't see anything
through those hedges.</font>

862
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:19,291
<font color="#ffff80">You're being a very negative detective.
Give me a boost up.</font>

863
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,626
<font color="#ffff80">Look, he won't catch us.</font>

864
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:25,714
<font color="#ffff80">Go higher.</font>

865
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:32,137
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, hell, no!
Now he's crossed the line!</font>

866
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:34,890
<font color="#ffff80">What? What is it?</font>

867
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,475
<font color="#ffff80">It's a Jetta.</font>

868
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:38,059
<font color="#ffff80">It's a Jetta!
So?</font>

869
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,145
<font color="#ffff80">Only young, hot girls
drive Jettas!</font>

870
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:41,480
<font color="#ffff80">I had a Jetta.</font>

871
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,732
<font color="#ffff80">That's what
I'm talking about.</font>

872
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:58,121
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, there.</font>

873
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:01,500
<font color="#ffff80">I was out for a jog
and my hammies locked up.</font>

874
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,669
<font color="#ffff80">When that happens,
I have to stretch.</font>

875
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,004
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not Gumby!</font>

876
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:08,256
<font color="#ffff80">Just pulled over
for a little stretch.</font>

877
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,136
<font color="#ffff80">That feels so much better.</font>

878
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,600
<font color="#ffff80">Yup. That's a lot better.</font>

879
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:25,941
<font color="#ffff80">You got to stretch it out.
Stretch it out.</font>

880
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,369
<font color="#ffff80">That is it!</font>

881
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:38,954
<font color="#ffff80">From now on,
you have to tell me</font>

882
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,372
<font color="#ffff80">what we're doing,
where we're going...</font>

883
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:43,208
<font color="#ffff80">...and what's happening, 'cause
I can't take it anymore!</font>

884
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:44,793
<font color="#ffff80">Let's go!</font>

885
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:47,045
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, God!</font>

886
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,231
<font color="#ffff80">Well, well. Look who's
here-- the wife and the mistress.</font>

887
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:07,816
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not a mistress.</font>

888
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:09,901
<font color="#ffff80">Not technically, anyway.</font>

889
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,987
<font color="#ffff80">She comes in peace,
so be nice.</font>

890
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,155
<font color="#ffff80">All right. Come on in.</font>

891
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,410
<font color="#ffff80">So can I ask, what the
hell are you two up to?</font>

892
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,412
<font color="#ffff80">Don't say it's
a social call, because you</font>

893
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:22,247
<font color="#ffff80">haven't been here
since I bought the place.</font>

894
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:25,750
<font color="#ffff80">We think Mark has another
mistress-- we're going to find her.</font>

895
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:26,835
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm-hmm.</font>

896
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:32,674
<font color="#ffff80">And what do you plan on doing
if you find this girl?</font>

897
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,427
<font color="#ffff80">Don't come at me
with all your...</font>

898
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:37,929
<font color="#ffff80">...weird little man logic.
This is a...</font>

899
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:42,183
<font color="#ffff80">...one-day-at- a-time operation.
Today is light recon day.</font>

900
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:45,020
<font color="#ffff80">A grappling hook?
Really?</font>

901
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:47,939
<font color="#ffff80">Damn.</font>

902
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,205
<font color="#ffff80">Look, I don't know if
you're here out of...</font>

903
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,124
<font color="#ffff80">...morbid curiosity,
or you and Kate</font>

904
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,792
<font color="#ffff80">are the weirdest
friends ever--</font>

905
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,878
<font color="#ffff80">We are.
The weirdest friends ever.</font>

906
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:11,880
<font color="#ffff80">--But she's a good person.</font>

907
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,050
<font color="#ffff80">And though Mark's an asshole,
they had something real.</font>

908
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,093
<font color="#ffff80">And when she's done
running around with you,</font>

909
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,012
<font color="#ffff80">she'll realize
that's gone.</font>

910
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,305
<font color="#ffff80">And it's going to suck.</font>

911
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,057
<font color="#ffff80">So...</font>

912
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:24,726
<font color="#ffff80">...try not to make that
part any worse for her.</font>

913
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,062
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

914
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:31,149
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

915
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:32,901
<font color="#ffff80">They are on the move.</font>

916
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:35,070
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

917
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,905
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing.</font>

918
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:40,909
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

919
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:44,579
<font color="#ffff80">Really?
What's he doing?</font>

920
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:45,914
<font color="#ffff80">Kissing.
Uh-huh.</font>

921
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,417
<font color="#ffff80">Probably tongue.</font>

922
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:50,502
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm-hmm.</font>

923
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:52,754
<font color="#ffff80">Probably enjoying.</font>

924
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:54,047
<font color="#ffff80">Great.</font>

925
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:57,759
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, target is moving!
Target is on the move.</font>

926
00:52:58,093 --> 00:52:59,177
<font color="#ffff80">All right.</font>

927
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,262
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, he's wearing
those cute shorts</font>

928
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,390
<font color="#ffff80">I got him for Christmas.
They look good.</font>

929
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:04,641
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

930
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,393
<font color="#ffff80">I can't believe
you're not interested.</font>

931
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,228
<font color="#ffff80">Just promise
when you meet her...</font>

932
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:11,856
<font color="#ffff80">...you won't lose your shit like you
did with me. Don't say you didn't.</font>

933
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,194
<font color="#ffff80">I did, because I was a mistress-virgin
and you were the first.</font>

934
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:18,863
<font color="#ffff80">Now I'm all worn in
like an old glove.</font>

935
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:20,740
<font color="#ffff80">She's getting UP!</font>

936
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:24,953
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God.</font>

937
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,288
<font color="#ffff80">Holy shit!
What?</font>

938
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:30,083
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, come on!</font>

939
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:31,918
<font color="#ffff80">What is that?</font>

940
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:34,003
<font color="#ffff80">Let me see. Let me see!</font>

941
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:36,506
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, but you're
not going to like it.</font>

942
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:37,590
<font color="#ffff80">Ah!</font>

943
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:48,476
<font color="#ffff80">She makes me look
like I'm wearing a diaper!</font>

944
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,437
<font color="#ffff80">You think she had that made?</font>

945
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:54,774
<font color="#ffff80">No. When you have a body like that,
everything fits you perfectly.</font>

946
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:06,369
<font color="#ffff80">This is just so unoriginal,
Mark! So cliché!</font>

947
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,836
<font color="#ffff80">She's the perfect
ten lemon tart...</font>

948
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,129
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe an eleven.</font>

949
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:18,298
<font color="#ffff80">...double-D, natural double-D.
A triple-D.</font>

950
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,300
<font color="#ffff80">It's like a midlife
crisis mistress!</font>

951
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:23,344
<font color="#ffff80">She's like a cliché of every
wife's waking nightmare!</font>

952
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:26,306
<font color="#ffff80">You have to admit, that's pretty good.
Seriously.</font>

953
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:28,516
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, fine.
She's beautiful.</font>

954
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:31,478
<font color="#ffff80">At some point you say--
I play tennis, right?</font>

955
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:34,856
<font color="#ffff80">But if I play against John
McEnroe, I expect to lose.</font>

956
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,524
<font color="#ffff80">You know what?
Right?</font>

957
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,193
<font color="#ffff80">I am McEnroe!</font>

958
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:40,695
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing?!</font>

959
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:43,698
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you going?! Wait!</font>

960
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,533
<font color="#ffff80">No!!!</font>

961
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:49,037
<font color="#ffff80">Stop!!!</font>

962
00:54:52,874 --> 00:54:55,210
<font color="#ffff80">What happened to being calm?!</font>

963
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:06,387
<font color="#ffff80">Carlyl!</font>

964
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:07,847
<font color="#ffff80">Carly!</font>

965
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:10,725
<font color="#ffff80">Stop!!!</font>

966
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:25,740
<font color="#ffff80">I can't believe
he was cheating on me!</font>

967
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,368
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, boo-hoo!
He cheated on me, too!</font>

968
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:30,870
<font color="#ffff80">You're the wife!
He's supposed to cheat on you!</font>

969
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,163
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God!</font>

970
00:55:32,247 --> 00:55:34,249
<font color="#ffff80">Stop, you crazy housewife!</font>

971
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:38,253
<font color="#ffff80">Stop the grappling!
I'm strong when I'm mad!!</font>

972
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,718
<font color="#ffff80">What's going on?</font>

973
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,601
<font color="#ffff80">Hi.</font>

974
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:58,565
<font color="#ffff80">I just can't believe
he'd lie to me.</font>

975
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,942
<font color="#ffff80">I really thought
we were soulmates.</font>

976
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:04,612
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God, lam so sorry.
I can't believe I said that.</font>

977
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:07,240
<font color="#ffff80">You're his soulmate.
I'm a whore.</font>

978
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:11,411
<font color="#ffff80">You must hate me so much. If it's
any consolation, I hate me more.</font>

979
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,913
<font color="#ffff80">I don't hate you at all.</font>

980
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:16,457
<font color="#ffff80">I got all that out of
my system with that one.</font>

981
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:20,295
<font color="#ffff80">You're so amazing, to be friends
with your husband's mistress.</font>

982
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:23,089
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, it's like
a dream come true.</font>

983
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:26,801
<font color="#ffff80">Ignore her. She's working
through some stuff right now.</font>

984
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:31,139
<font color="#ffff80">She's kind of troubled. But you
smell amazing. What is that?</font>

985
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,932
<font color="#ffff80">I think it's just sweat.</font>

986
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:36,477
<font color="#ffff80">The worst part about this is,
you seem so nice...</font>

987
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,980
<font color="#ffff80">...and he had me believing
you were the devil.</font>

988
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:40,273
<font color="#ffff80">Wait, what?</font>

989
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:43,026
<font color="#ffff80">He said you cheated on him,
then asked for a divorce.</font>

990
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:46,487
<font color="#ffff80">He said that...
I was the cheater?</font>

991
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:49,324
<font color="#ffff80">That's what he said?
That I cheated?</font>

992
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:50,617
<font color="#ffff80">I'm so sorry.</font>

993
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:54,329
<font color="#ffff80">That is so-- Okay.
That's-- What an asshole!</font>

994
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:56,122
<font color="#ffff80">He's a liar, Kate.
Who cares?</font>

995
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:57,999
<font color="#ffff80">Because it's not fair.</font>

996
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,627
<font color="#ffff80">He made me the bad guy.
And he's divorcing me?</font>

997
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:02,670
<font color="#ffff80">You know it's not actually
happening, right?</font>

998
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,381
<font color="#ffff80">He could pick any scenario,
and he picks that?</font>

999
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,883
<font color="#ffff80">And makes me
the villain?</font>

1000
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:09,344
<font color="#ffff80">And then divorces
me for fake-cheating?</font>

1001
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:11,638
<font color="#ffff80">I shouldn't have told you.
I'm sorry.</font>

1002
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:14,182
<font color="#ffff80">It's not your fault
I married a monster.</font>

1003
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:18,019
<font color="#ffff80">You are innocent in all this.
Let's go back to Phil's.</font>

1004
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:19,312
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, let's go.</font>

1005
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,689
<font color="#ffff80">Wait! What do I do?
You can't just leave me.</font>

1006
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,983
<font color="#ffff80">Mark will be back
any minute!</font>

1007
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:25,693
<font color="#ffff80">We'll get your number.
Can we keep her?</font>

1008
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:28,488
<font color="#ffff80">No, we can't keep her!
We have a dog at home!</font>

1009
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:30,865
<font color="#ffff80">You pulled my hair,
which is totally--</font>

1010
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:33,368
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, hey, hey!</font>

1011
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,994
<font color="#ffff80">Watch what
I taught Thunder.</font>

1012
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,496
<font color="#ffff80">Thunder, get me a beer.</font>

1013
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:40,333
<font color="#ffff80">- Unbelievable.
- Wow!</font>

1014
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:41,876
<font color="#ffff80">- That's crazy.
- It's a miracle.</font>

1015
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:43,878
<font color="#ffff80">- That dog is trying to break me.
- He really is.</font>

1016
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:46,714
<font color="#ffff80">Good boy.</font>

1017
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:48,883
<font color="#ffff80">So, how was the stalking?</font>

1018
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:50,927
<font color="#ffff80">Thunder! Traitor.</font>

1019
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:52,679
<font color="#ffff80">How'd it go, weirdo?</font>

1020
00:57:53,346 --> 00:57:57,058
<font color="#ffff80">It was good! We ran on the
beach, met Mark's new mistress--</font>

1021
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:58,351
<font color="#ffff80">Amber.</font>

1022
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:59,560
<font color="#ffff80">Twenty-two, super hot.</font>

1023
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:00,853
<font color="#ffff80">Are you jealous?</font>

1024
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:03,690
<font color="#ffff80">No, I'm not jealous. I just don't
have an insane girl crush.</font>

1025
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:05,525
<font color="#ffff80">I think it's good
she's super hot.</font>

1026
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,235
<font color="#ffff80">It brings up
our group average.</font>

1027
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,362
<font color="#ffff80">This <i>isn't
frickin' Sister Wives.</i></font>

1028
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,030
<font color="#ffff80">You sure you're not angry?</font>

1029
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:13,157
<font color="#ffff80">Letting it out is better
than having to tell the cops</font>

1030
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:14,200
<font color="#ffff80">you didn't mean to
hug her to death.</font>

1031
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:18,204
<font color="#ffff80">You're so funny! You'll
see when you meet her.</font>

1032
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:20,581
<font color="#ffff80">What? When I meet her?</font>

1033
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,918
<font color="#ffff80">Up high.</font>

1034
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:27,380
<font color="#ffff80">You look so pretty!</font>

1035
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:28,881
<font color="#ffff80">You look so pretty.</font>

1036
00:58:28,965 --> 00:58:30,258
<font color="#ffff80">It's really annoying.</font>

1037
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:31,592
<font color="#ffff80">It's just bad.</font>

1038
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:34,929
<font color="#ffff80">What's that up there?</font>

1039
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:37,390
<font color="#ffff80">That's the best
part of the house.</font>

1040
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,600
<font color="#ffff80">You'll like it.
Come on. I'll show you.</font>

1041
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:42,103
<font color="#ffff80">You're such a good girl.</font>

1042
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:43,521
<font color="#ffff80">Mark's an asshole!</font>

1043
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:44,772
<font color="#ffff80">He is.</font>

1044
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:52,947
<font color="#ffff80">Wow.</font>

1045
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:05,960
<font color="#ffff80">I know exactly what
I would do with it.</font>

1046
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:11,632
<font color="#ffff80">I would put a coffee
table right here...</font>

1047
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:14,469
<font color="#ffff80">...so I could have
my morning coffee.</font>

1048
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:18,431
<font color="#ffff80">You can't. There's too much morning sun.
lt would blast you.</font>

1049
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:22,477
<font color="#ffff80">No, this is where I would
want to exist, right here...</font>

1050
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:24,812
<font color="#ffff80">...looking at that.</font>

1051
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:26,314
<font color="#ffff80">You sure?</font>

1052
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:28,316
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.</font>

1053
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,110
<font color="#ffff80">I'll think about it.</font>

1054
00:59:31,444 --> 00:59:32,779
<font color="#ffff80">You better.</font>

1055
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:34,989
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

1056
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:51,672
<font color="#ffff80">Kate might actually
have a point about</font>

1057
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:53,966
<font color="#ffff80">her bringing up
the group average.</font>

1058
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:57,804
<font color="#ffff80">Do you care if I smoke?</font>

1059
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,139
<font color="#ffff80">No! I kind of
want one, too.</font>

1060
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:01,474
<font color="#ffff80">Since when do you smoke?</font>

1061
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,351
<font color="#ffff80">Since whenever
I want to.</font>

1062
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:05,186
<font color="#ffff80">This should be good.</font>

1063
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,063
<font color="#ffff80">If we find any
more mistresses,</font>

1064
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:08,689
<font color="#ffff80">I'll have to
send her to rehab.</font>

1065
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,892
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry,
we didn't hook up.</font>

1066
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,353
<font color="#ffff80">We didn't? Oh, thank God.</font>

1067
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:49,897
<font color="#ffff80">You took off your clothes
to go skinny dipping.</font>

1068
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:51,983
<font color="#ffff80">Really?</font>

1069
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,526
<font color="#ffff80">You girls started
in on the tequila...</font>

1070
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,403
<font color="#ffff80">...and it all went
downhill from there.</font>

1071
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:58,865
<font color="#ffff80">You wouldn't get dressed, so
I buttoned you in backwards.</font>

1072
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:00,366
<font color="#ffff80">Shut up.</font>

1073
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:04,370
<font color="#ffff80">So let me get this straight.
I came into your bed naked...</font>

1074
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:05,580
<font color="#ffff80">...and tried to molest you,</font>

1075
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:09,709
<font color="#ffff80">so you made a straitjacket and a
pillow fort to protect yourself.</font>

1076
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,043
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.</font>

1077
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:13,880
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God,
I've hit rock bottom.</font>

1078
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,256
<font color="#ffff80">Nah. Don't worry about it.</font>

1079
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,884
<font color="#ffff80">We were pretty
out of our heads,</font>

1080
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:19,927
<font color="#ffff80">and I like to think
I'm a good guy, so...</font>

1081
01:01:20,887 --> 01:01:23,764
<font color="#ffff80">So you needed
the pillows to resist me.</font>

1082
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,767
<font color="#ffff80">Let's say I was
hedging my willpower.</font>

1083
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,272
<font color="#ffff80">I'm going to take a shower.</font>

1084
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:42,950
<font color="#ffff80">Good morning!</font>

1085
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:45,453
<font color="#ffff80">What are you guys doing?</font>

1086
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:49,457
<font color="#ffff80">Phil went for a run
and Amber's making frittatas.</font>

1087
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,292
<font color="#ffff80">Have you packed?
I want to get on</font>

1088
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:52,919
<font color="#ffff80">the road before
traffic starts.</font>

1089
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,963
<font color="#ffff80">No, 'cause then I have to
go home and deal with Mark.</font>

1090
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:58,424
<font color="#ffff80">I was thinking,
what sucks...</font>

1091
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:02,637
<font color="#ffff80">...is that he should be the one freaking
out, not me. I didn't do anything.</font>

1092
01:02:02,929 --> 01:02:06,641
<font color="#ffff80">Instead, he's totally fine and I'm
sitting here with the two of you...</font>

1093
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:08,768
<font color="#ffff80">...pretending
not to know you...</font>

1094
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:12,146
<font color="#ffff80">...and on top of it, I have
to get my ducks in a row.</font>

1095
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:13,773
<font color="#ffff80">What do you want to do?</font>

1096
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:17,318
<font color="#ffff80">This may sound wrong, but I
kind of want him to hurt.</font>

1097
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:19,320
<font color="#ffff80">I want to be the one...</font>

1098
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:21,489
<font color="#ffff80">...who makes him
start a new life</font>

1099
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:23,449
<font color="#ffff80">because i took
it away from him.</font>

1100
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:26,994
<font color="#ffff80">I want him to feel
what I feel, but worse.</font>

1101
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:29,330
<font color="#ffff80">So you're talking about
maximum pain, right?</font>

1102
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:31,332
<font color="#ffff80">We should kick
him in the balls!</font>

1103
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,961
<font color="#ffff80">That's like
a really good thought, and</font>

1104
01:02:35,086 --> 01:02:37,171
<font color="#ffff80">I like the way your
brain works, but...</font>

1105
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:40,341
<font color="#ffff80">...we're thinking about something
a little bigger than that.</font>

1106
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:42,510
<font color="#ffff80">It doesn't matter anyway.</font>

1107
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,011
<font color="#ffff80">He's always going
to wind up on top</font>

1108
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:45,554
<font color="#ffff80">because he's
a killer and I'm not.</font>

1109
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:47,807
<font color="#ffff80">That's not true.
You're not alone.</font>

1110
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:49,350
<font color="#ffff80">You have us.
Exactly.</font>

1111
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:51,978
<font color="#ffff80">Put the Lawyer, the Wife
and the Boobs together...</font>

1112
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:53,479
<font color="#ffff80">...you have
a perfect killing machine.</font>

1113
01:02:53,646 --> 01:02:54,647
<font color="#ffff80">Yes! <i>I</i> do?</font>

1114
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:57,149
<font color="#ffff80">I know how assholes
do asshole-y things...</font>

1115
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,861
<font color="#ffff80">...you know how Mark does
everything, and Amber knows...</font>

1116
01:03:02,697 --> 01:03:04,365
<font color="#ffff80">We'll find out
what Amber knows.</font>

1117
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:05,658
<font color="#ffff80">What are you saying?</font>

1118
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:08,202
<font color="#ffff80">I'm saying that if you
want to take him down...</font>

1119
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:11,372
<font color="#ffff80">...then let's take him down.
We have him surrounded.</font>

1120
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:12,540
<font color="#ffff80">Surrounded!</font>

1121
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:14,709
<font color="#ffff80">If we put our
brains together...</font>

1122
01:03:14,834 --> 01:03:16,669
<font color="#ffff80">The three of us...</font>

1123
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:18,421
<font color="#ffff80">...can be just as
shady as he can.</font>

1124
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:19,964
<font color="#ffff80">I am in.</font>

1125
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,716
<font color="#ffff80">Are you in?
I'm in!</font>

1126
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:48,743
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, honey!</font>

1127
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:53,748
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm...</font>

1128
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,543
<font color="#ffff80">it tastes different today.</font>

1129
01:03:57,752 --> 01:03:59,086
<font color="#ffff80">I added kiwi.</font>

1130
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:02,089
<font color="#ffff80">I like it.</font>

1131
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:03,549
<font color="#ffff80">I'll keep adding it!</font>

1132
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,263
<font color="#ffff80">Fuck you! Fuck you!</font>

1133
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:35,623
<font color="#ffff80">I was going crazy without you.
I'm sorry for being a jerk.</font>

1134
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:38,459
<font color="#ffff80">No, no. You know what?
I overreacted.</font>

1135
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:40,628
<font color="#ffff80">I did. I really did.</font>

1136
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:43,422
<font color="#ffff80">It's just that you were
going to meet my dad...</font>

1137
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:45,132
<font color="#ffff80">...and I've been so
worried about him.</font>

1138
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,636
<font color="#ffff80">He's going through so much
with this divorce, and--</font>

1139
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:51,639
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry. Do you mind?
I'll just be a sec.</font>

1140
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:53,307
<font color="#ffff80">No, that's fine.</font>

1141
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:55,768
<font color="#ffff80">Mike.</font>

1142
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:01,148
<font color="#ffff80">No, I was setting the mike.
What do you want?</font>

1143
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:10,783
<font color="#ffff80">I love this tie.</font>

1144
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:28,175
<font color="#ffff80">Hold that thought.</font>

1145
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:37,226
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry.
Um...where were we?</font>

1146
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:38,477
<font color="#ffff80">My dad's divorce.</font>

1147
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:39,895
<font color="#ffff80">Right.</font>

1148
01:05:40,396 --> 01:05:42,064
<font color="#ffff80">You're worried about him.
I am.</font>

1149
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:44,775
<font color="#ffff80">He's going to have to give
this woman half his money.</font>

1150
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,361
<font color="#ffff80">Half of everything he has.</font>

1151
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:51,240
<font color="#ffff80">And she does nothing. Just lays
around the house all day long.</font>

1152
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:53,534
<font color="#ffff80">He has been
working his whole life...</font>

1153
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:57,037
<font color="#ffff80">...and she is going to take half of it!
It's not fair.</font>

1154
01:05:57,246 --> 01:06:00,082
<font color="#ffff80">He can't give away
what he doesn't have.</font>

1155
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,418
<font color="#ffff80">You mean he should
hide his money?</font>

1156
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,420
<font color="#ffff80">Not hide. Lose.</font>

1157
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:06,422
<font color="#ffff80">I don't understand.</font>

1158
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:09,842
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe I should just
tell him in person.</font>

1159
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:12,803
<font color="#ffff80">You would do that?</font>

1160
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:16,056
<font color="#ffff80">Whoa!</font>

1161
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:21,562
<font color="#ffff80">Are you okay?
Actually, no.</font>

1162
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:23,856
<font color="#ffff80">We should go. Now.</font>

1163
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,192
<font color="#ffff80">Really?
Please.</font>

1164
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:39,747
<font color="#ffff80">Are you okay?</font>

1165
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:40,873
<font color="#ffff80">Something's not right.</font>

1166
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,418
<font color="#ffff80">You go.
I'll call you later.</font>

1167
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,420
<font color="#ffff80">I can wait for you.
I don't mind.</font>

1168
01:06:46,712 --> 01:06:48,714
<font color="#ffff80">No, it's fine.
It's good.</font>

1169
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,300
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, shit! Oh!</font>

1170
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:55,095
<font color="#ffff80">Oh! Come on!</font>

1171
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:58,140
<font color="#ffff80">Oh!</font>

1172
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:16,700
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, God!</font>

1173
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:18,118
<font color="#ffff80">Oh! That was painful.</font>

1174
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,122
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God!</font>

1175
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:23,791
<font color="#ffff80">No! No!</font>

1176
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,418
<font color="#ffff80">on, no.</font>

1177
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:32,925
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, buddy?</font>

1178
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:36,011
<font color="#ffff80">Can you help me out?</font>

1179
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:38,305
<font color="#ffff80">I need you to
buy me some pants.</font>

1180
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:40,808
<font color="#ffff80">Things got really
tough in here, huh?</font>

1181
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:43,143
<font color="#ffff80">I'm a 34-inch waist.
The fit doesn't</font>

1182
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:45,104
<font color="#ffff80">have to be perfect.
I like blue.</font>

1183
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:47,147
<font color="#ffff80">Or green!</font>

1184
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:50,609
<font color="#ffff80">You still there?</font>

1185
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:54,613
<font color="#ffff80">Hello?</font>

1186
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,669
<font color="#ffff80">What happened to you?</font>

1187
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:11,338
<font color="#ffff80">I had a fecal incident.</font>

1188
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:13,966
<font color="#ffff80">I needed some pants
and the only person</font>

1189
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:16,343
<font color="#ffff80">who didn't try to
rob me was a hipster.</font>

1190
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:19,805
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry, did you say you
had a fecal incident?</font>

1191
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:21,265
<font color="#ffff80">Like you pooped your pants?</font>

1192
01:08:21,348 --> 01:08:24,852
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, Kate. Exactly like that.
I shit my pants.</font>

1193
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:29,356
<font color="#ffff80">And you know what? It's about to
happen again, so if you don't mind...</font>

1194
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:32,359
<font color="#ffff80">...I'm going to go see if our
toilet can take a punch.</font>

1195
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:58,552
<font color="#ffff80">You found it!
I did.</font>

1196
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:00,554
<font color="#ffff80">Come sit down.</font>

1197
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,057
<font color="#ffff80">Is your shirt see-through?</font>

1198
01:09:03,265 --> 01:09:06,393
<font color="#ffff80">The girl at the shop told me that
sheer is the next big thing.</font>

1199
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:08,270
<font color="#ffff80">Your Indian girl
didn't veto that?</font>

1200
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:11,440
<font color="#ffff80">Ah! I haven't seen her.
We didn't have that twinkle.</font>

1201
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:13,233
<font color="#ffff80">I like sheer shirts.</font>

1202
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,361
<font color="#ffff80">Dad, this is Amber.</font>

1203
01:09:16,362 --> 01:09:17,363
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, Amber.</font>

1204
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:19,948
<font color="#ffff80">Hi. Um...</font>

1205
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,159
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm...</font>

1206
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:26,121
<font color="#ffff80">I'm fine, thank you.</font>

1207
01:09:27,915 --> 01:09:30,918
<font color="#ffff80">I'm really okay. Thank you.
I hate being touched.</font>

1208
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:34,380
<font color="#ffff80">Where are we? Seriously.
What is this, Saigon?</font>

1209
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:37,591
<font color="#ffff80">Don't make fun of 'Nam.
Best years of my life.</font>

1210
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:40,094
<font color="#ffff80">This place is awesome.
My neck was so tight.</font>

1211
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,930
<font color="#ffff80">What's it called? "No
Hands." Isn't it great?</font>

1212
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:44,306
<font color="#ffff80">Watch this.</font>

1213
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:54,650
<font color="#ffff80">You see? No hands.</font>

1214
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:56,985
<font color="#ffff80">I can't put
my finger on it,</font>

1215
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:59,154
<font color="#ffff80">but there's something
very wrong with that.</font>

1216
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:03,575
<font color="#ffff80">So, what's up? What's this big
mystery you want me to solve?</font>

1217
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:05,285
<font color="#ffff80">Hypothetically...</font>

1218
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:07,454
<font color="#ffff80">...if I wanted to
protect my money</font>

1219
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,623
<font color="#ffff80">by "losing" it,
what would I do?</font>

1220
01:10:09,957 --> 01:10:11,291
<font color="#ffff80">Losing it?</font>

1221
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:14,795
<font color="#ffff80">You're not working with
hypothetical Feds, are you?</font>

1222
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:17,089
<font color="#ffff80">No! Do you have a
problem with the Feds?</font>

1223
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:18,215
<font color="#ffff80">Actually,
don't tell me.</font>

1224
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,383
<font color="#ffff80">What's this guy do?</font>

1225
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:20,968
<font color="#ffff80">Develops start-up
companies.</font>

1226
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,262
<font color="#ffff80">Ah, the Chuzzlewit Pinch.</font>

1227
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:24,555
<font color="#ffff80">Oh.</font>

1228
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:26,807
<font color="#ffff80">He ain't losing money,
he's robbing it.</font>

1229
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:27,891
<font color="#ffff80">Hmm...</font>

1230
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:31,270
<font color="#ffff80">Here's what you do-- look
for blind offshore filings.</font>

1231
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:34,273
<font color="#ffff80">Like in Switzerland
or the Bahamas.</font>

1232
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:37,317
<font color="#ffff80">If I was going to "lose"
money, that's where I'd do it.</font>

1233
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,153
<font color="#ffff80">Can I have
another drink?</font>

1234
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:43,323
<font color="#ffff80">You okay, baby?
You need my help on this?</font>

1235
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:46,994
<font color="#ffff80">No. I got this.</font>

1236
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:53,500
<font color="#ffff80">Stop frowning before
you break your face.</font>

1237
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:55,878
<font color="#ffff80">Better?</font>

1238
01:10:55,961 --> 01:10:59,506
<font color="#ffff80">That's your Evil Genius smile. ls
somebody about to get screwed?</font>

1239
01:10:59,798 --> 01:11:03,177
<font color="#ffff80">You screw me, I screw you back.
I'm a lady like that.</font>

1240
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:08,849
<font color="#ffff80">A three-way?
Yeah.</font>

1241
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:10,851
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know.</font>

1242
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:12,144
<font color="#ffff80">Please?</font>

1243
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:15,355
<font color="#ffff80">Come on.
You'll love Dana.</font>

1244
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:16,857
<font color="#ffff80">Dana?</font>

1245
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:22,196
<font color="#ffff80">It'll be so hot. I think it'd
be a game changer for us.</font>

1246
01:11:28,494 --> 01:11:29,995
<font color="#ffff80">All right.
If you really want to.</font>

1247
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:32,039
<font color="#ffff80">Yay! Thank you!</font>

1248
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:33,665
<font color="#ffff80">Dana!</font>

1249
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,169
<font color="#ffff80">Baby, this is Dana.
Hmm?</font>

1250
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,591
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

1251
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:48,222
<font color="#ffff80">I knew you'd love her!</font>

1252
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:50,474
<font color="#ffff80">Ah!</font>

1253
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:08,659
<font color="#ffff80">Oh!</font>

1254
01:12:10,536 --> 01:12:12,204
<font color="#ffff80">What the hell?</font>

1255
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:13,580
<font color="#ffff80">Kate!</font>

1256
01:12:14,206 --> 01:12:16,041
<font color="#ffff80">Yes? Kate! !</font>

1257
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,001
<font color="#ffff80">Look at this.</font>

1258
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:19,253
<font color="#ffff80">It looks like
you put on weight.</font>

1259
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:21,880
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. And have you ever
seen shit like this?</font>

1260
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:25,050
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, yeah!</font>

1261
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,218
<font color="#ffff80">Don't do that.</font>

1262
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:28,095
<font color="#ffff80">Are they sensitive?
Does that hurt?</font>

1263
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,222
<font color="#ffff80">Ah!
Tune in Tokyo.</font>

1264
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:35,102
<font color="#ffff80">lt just looks like
you're a little bloated.</font>

1265
01:12:35,644 --> 01:12:36,728
<font color="#ffff80">I have boobs!</font>

1266
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:38,438
<font color="#ffff80">These nipples look
like they've done</font>

1267
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:40,232
<font color="#ffff80">hard time in Africa
feeding a village.</font>

1268
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,608
<font color="#ffff80">You're overreacting.</font>

1269
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:42,943
<font color="#ffff80">They're straight
out of the Congo!</font>

1270
01:12:43,235 --> 01:12:44,570
<font color="#ffff80">Just tape them up.</font>

1271
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:47,739
<font color="#ffff80">No! I can't go to
work with my tits taped!</font>

1272
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:49,950
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you going?
To do push-ups.</font>

1273
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:52,244
<font color="#ffff80">Did you want
this smoothie?</font>

1274
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,121
<font color="#ffff80">He's back to
sexting like a freak.</font>

1275
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:56,164
<font color="#ffff80">And the pictures!</font>

1276
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,083
<font color="#ffff80">Picking up my phone is like
being flashed on the subway.</font>

1277
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:01,920
<font color="#ffff80">Try living in the same house
with him. All I get is surprise penis.</font>

1278
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:04,506
<font color="#ffff80">It's like his sex
drive is tripled.</font>

1279
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:06,174
<font color="#ffff80">Non-stop.</font>

1280
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:07,467
<font color="#ffff80">I thought you were
giving him hormones.</font>

1281
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:08,802
<font color="#ffff80">I am!</font>

1282
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:11,096
<font color="#ffff80">Enough for
a pre-op transsexual.</font>

1283
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:12,973
<font color="#ffff80">He must be taking Viagra.</font>

1284
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:15,601
<font color="#ffff80">Well, now that sex
is off the table...</font>

1285
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,811
<font color="#ffff80">...we have to
speak to one another,</font>

1286
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,938
<font color="#ffff80">and I think he's
getting suspicious.</font>

1287
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:21,648
<font color="#ffff80">Really?
Yeah.</font>

1288
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:23,942
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe one of us
should sleep with him.</font>

1289
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:25,986
<font color="#ffff80">Are you crazy?</font>

1290
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:27,988
<font color="#ffff80">Just to let some
steam out of the pot.</font>

1291
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,616
<font color="#ffff80">No. Please keep
the lid on the pot.</font>

1292
01:13:30,824 --> 01:13:33,285
<font color="#ffff80">You don't think
I can handle it?</font>

1293
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:35,621
<font color="#ffff80">You know what?
I'll do it.</font>

1294
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,664
<font color="#ffff80">I'll take one
for the team.</font>

1295
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:40,125
<font color="#ffff80">No. You think he's
an evil sociopath.</font>

1296
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:42,336
<font color="#ffff80">He is!
But better me than you.</font>

1297
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:44,129
<font color="#ffff80">I can weather
a little hate sex.</font>

1298
01:13:44,338 --> 01:13:46,340
<font color="#ffff80">I'll do it. I don't
have a lot of feelings.</font>

1299
01:13:46,632 --> 01:13:47,716
<font color="#ffff80">Come on.</font>

1300
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:48,967
<font color="#ffff80">You guys have
no faith in me.</font>

1301
01:13:49,176 --> 01:13:50,844
<font color="#ffff80">I have a friend
who could do it.</font>

1302
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:55,474
<font color="#ffff80">No,no,no. We are not hiring a
hooker to sleep with my husband.</font>

1303
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:57,476
<font color="#ffff80">She's not a hooker.
She's just a slut.</font>

1304
01:13:57,684 --> 01:14:00,354
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, we're done here.
I'm going to do it.</font>

1305
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:02,648
<font color="#ffff80">I'll do it. If you
do it, I do it.</font>

1306
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:03,982
<font color="#ffff80">Me, too.</font>

1307
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:07,819
<font color="#ffff80">Fine. Rock, paper, scissors.
Winner has sex with my husband.</font>

1308
01:14:08,654 --> 01:14:09,821
<font color="#ffff80">Really?</font>

1309
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:11,490
<font color="#ffff80">It's the only way.</font>

1310
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:12,950
<font color="#ffff80">One time, or two out of three?</font>

1311
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:14,326
<font color="#ffff80">One time.</font>

1312
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:22,334
<font color="#ffff80">Well, Amber wins.</font>

1313
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,710
<font color="#ffff80">You okay with that?</font>

1314
01:14:23,877 --> 01:14:27,172
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. I couldn't
be more okay. What?</font>

1315
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:44,398
<font color="#ffff80">You're so full of shit.</font>

1316
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:50,737
<font color="#ffff80">Kate!</font>

1317
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:51,905
<font color="#ffff80">Pst!</font>

1318
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:55,200
<font color="#ffff80">Hey!</font>

1319
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:57,577
<font color="#ffff80">Where have you been?</font>

1320
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:00,747
<font color="#ffff80">Are you okay?
I've been trying you all day!</font>

1321
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,458
<font color="#ffff80">Can you open
the door for me?</font>

1322
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:05,377
<font color="#ffff80">Wow.</font>

1323
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:13,260
<font color="#ffff80">What is going on?</font>

1324
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:15,762
<font color="#ffff80">Wow.</font>

1325
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:17,889
<font color="#ffff80">This is what
it's come to, huh?</font>

1326
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:21,935
<font color="#ffff80">I think I'm having
a nervous breakdown.</font>

1327
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,941
<font color="#ffff80">Is it ever going
to get any easier?</font>

1328
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:32,738
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah. It Will.</font>

1329
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:35,240
<font color="#ffff80">When?</font>

1330
01:15:36,241 --> 01:15:38,910
<font color="#ffff80">Well, it's going to
suck for a little while.</font>

1331
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:41,288
<font color="#ffff80">Then it's going to
suck a little less.</font>

1332
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:45,459
<font color="#ffff80">And then one day that
ring will just be a ring.</font>

1333
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:50,797
<font color="#ffff80">You'll take it off and it'll just
be something you used to wear.</font>

1334
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:53,425
<font color="#ffff80">I hope so.</font>

1335
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,431
<font color="#ffff80">Katie?</font>

1336
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:01,475
<font color="#ffff80">He's supposed to be with Amber!
Shit!</font>

1337
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:02,642
<font color="#ffff80">I'm home!</font>

1338
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:05,645
<font color="#ffff80">No, there's no
room under the bed.</font>

1339
01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:14,362
<font color="#ffff80">No, I can see you.
Go out the window.</font>

1340
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:15,989
<font color="#ffff80">Go out the window.</font>

1341
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:17,074
<font color="#ffff80">Honey?</font>

1342
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:18,492
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not going out the window!</font>

1343
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:23,997
<font color="#ffff80">No! You can't get in there.
I'm ticklish.</font>

1344
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:29,002
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, sweetie!
You're home early!</font>

1345
01:16:30,045 --> 01:16:32,506
<font color="#ffff80">I canceled.
What's all this?</font>

1346
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:36,343
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, you know, sometimes
I like to put on my dress.</font>

1347
01:16:37,511 --> 01:16:38,887
<font color="#ffff80">It's pretty.
You do?</font>

1348
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:43,016
<font color="#ffff80">You know when you just feel like,
"Normal clothes are blah"...</font>

1349
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:45,894
<font color="#ffff80">...and you're just like,
"I wish I had a costume!"</font>

1350
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:47,521
<font color="#ffff80">You know when
you get like that?</font>

1351
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:50,148
<font color="#ffff80">No. Not really.</font>

1352
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:53,527
<font color="#ffff80">Why don't you come to my
investor dinner this weekend?</font>

1353
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:55,862
<font color="#ffff80">We'll get dressed
up and you can see...</font>

1354
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:57,197
<font color="#ffff80">...what I'm doing with
all your great ideas.</font>

1355
01:16:57,364 --> 01:16:58,532
<font color="#ffff80">Okay!</font>

1356
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:01,368
<font color="#ffff80">I'll get us some drinks.
Scotch okay?</font>

1357
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:03,870
<font color="#ffff80">That'd be perfect,
thank you.</font>

1358
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:05,872
<font color="#ffff80">Get out!</font>

1359
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,210
<font color="#ffff80">Be careful.</font>

1360
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,045
<font color="#ffff80">Hold on! Wait, wait!</font>

1361
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:14,297
<font color="#ffff80">Ah!</font>

1362
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,174
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry!</font>

1363
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:20,762
<font color="#ffff80">Ow!</font>

1364
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:29,729
<font color="#ffff80">Big year.
Great job.</font>

1365
01:17:29,938 --> 01:17:32,065
<font color="#ffff80">Kate, you remember
my partner, Nick.</font>

1366
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:34,067
<font color="#ffff80">Yes! Hi.
It's been ages.</font>

1367
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:35,735
<font color="#ffff80">Good to see you again.</font>

1368
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:38,071
<font color="#ffff80">This is Cece.
Kate's the one who</font>

1369
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:40,282
<font color="#ffff80">had the idea for
SwipeSwitch.com.</font>

1370
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:42,909
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, my God! I am
obsessed with that idea.</font>

1371
01:17:43,118 --> 01:17:44,953
<font color="#ffff80">I can't wait for
the site to go up.</font>

1372
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:47,914
<font color="#ffff80">Wow! Thank you.
That really means a lot.</font>

1373
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:50,250
<font color="#ffff80">She's my little idea factory.</font>

1374
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,419
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe you should ask her
about ServiceCircuit.</font>

1375
01:17:52,544 --> 01:17:53,753
<font color="#ffff80">Is that still
circling the drain?</font>

1376
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:58,091
<font color="#ffff80">More like the toilet. But the potential's
there-- we could make it work.</font>

1377
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,467
<font color="#ffff80">How much?</font>

1378
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:01,469
<font color="#ffff80">Two million.</font>

1379
01:18:03,597 --> 01:18:04,764
<font color="#ffff80">We'll talk about it.</font>

1380
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:07,434
<font color="#ffff80">But if two million doesn't
work, we shut it down.</font>

1381
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:08,894
<font color="#ffff80">Thanks. I appreciate it.</font>

1382
01:18:09,102 --> 01:18:12,439
<font color="#ffff80">You made us a ton of money this year.
Nobody bats a thousand.</font>

1383
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:13,607
<font color="#ffff80">True.</font>

1384
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:16,109
<font color="#ffff80">On that happy note,
who needs a drink?</font>

1385
01:18:16,318 --> 01:18:17,485
<font color="#ffff80">I do.</font>

1386
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,030
<font color="#ffff80">You want another?</font>

1387
01:18:20,155 --> 01:18:21,281
<font color="#ffff80">Sure.</font>

1388
01:18:22,616 --> 01:18:24,117
<font color="#ffff80">See you in a bit.</font>

1389
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:28,955
<font color="#ffff80">She's lovely.
She is.</font>

1390
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:30,373
<font color="#ffff80">Is it serious?</font>

1391
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:31,625
<font color="#ffff80">Uh, no.</font>

1392
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:34,711
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I was sorry to hear
about you and Julie.</font>

1393
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:35,921
<font color="#ffff80">Me, too.</font>

1394
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:39,007
<font color="#ffff80">But the lawyers say
it's all very amicable.</font>

1395
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:41,134
<font color="#ffff80">So fake it
until you make it.</font>

1396
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:42,469
<font color="#ffff80">Something like that.</font>

1397
01:18:42,677 --> 01:18:43,678
<font color="#ffff80">Katie!</font>

1398
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:45,305
<font color="#ffff80">Come on.</font>

1399
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:51,770
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, this is beautiful!</font>

1400
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,148
<font color="#ffff80">Wow.
Mmm.</font>

1401
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,279
<font color="#ffff80">Whoa!
Nice.</font>

1402
01:19:04,324 --> 01:19:05,992
<font color="#ffff80">This is pretty.</font>

1403
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:08,954
<font color="#ffff80">Hmm.
Hmm.</font>

1404
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:11,456
<font color="#ffff80">Did you ever think
when we had that shitty</font>

1405
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:13,667
<font color="#ffff80">little apartment
on Charles Street...</font>

1406
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,293
<font color="#ffff80">...we'd end up here?</font>

1407
01:19:15,502 --> 01:19:19,339
<font color="#ffff80">That wasn't a shitty apartment.
That was a great apartment.</font>

1408
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:22,133
<font color="#ffff80">Remember how tiny it was?</font>

1409
01:19:22,342 --> 01:19:24,678
<font color="#ffff80">And we had the bathroom
in the kitchen?</font>

1410
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:27,973
<font color="#ffff80">And every time I flushed the
toilet, the shower got cold?</font>

1411
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:29,766
<font color="#ffff80">I hated it.</font>

1412
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:33,019
<font color="#ffff80">I loved that apartment.</font>

1413
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:37,190
<font color="#ffff80">It just seems like everything
was so simple then. You know?</font>

1414
01:19:37,315 --> 01:19:38,316
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm-hmm.</font>

1415
01:19:38,483 --> 01:19:40,193
<font color="#ffff80">I was happy-</font>

1416
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:41,444
<font color="#ffff80">And I just wanted
you to be happy.</font>

1417
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:42,570
<font color="#ffff80">I am.</font>

1418
01:19:44,572 --> 01:19:45,907
<font color="#ffff80">Are you?</font>

1419
01:19:47,242 --> 01:19:49,202
<font color="#ffff80">You can tell me.
I won't be mad.</font>

1420
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:53,039
<font color="#ffff80">I wouldn't even
be me without you.</font>

1421
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:56,543
<font color="#ffff80">I might not always
get it right, but...</font>

1422
01:19:57,377 --> 01:20:00,547
<font color="#ffff80">...I'm exactly
where I want to be.</font>

1423
01:20:02,549 --> 01:20:04,217
<font color="#ffff80">Do you promise?</font>

1424
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:10,223
<font color="#ffff80">I'm so glad you're here.
We have so much to tell you!</font>

1425
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:12,559
<font color="#ffff80">Major breakthroughs.</font>

1426
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:13,852
<font color="#ffff80">What is all this?</font>

1427
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:15,562
<font color="#ffff80">Amber got Mark's password
off the nanny cam.</font>

1428
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:16,896
<font color="#ffff80">Hacked into his
computer the night</font>

1429
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:18,189
<font color="#ffff80">she was supposed to
have sex with him.</font>

1430
01:20:18,273 --> 01:20:19,566
<font color="#ffff80">You saw him?</font>

1431
01:20:19,691 --> 01:20:20,942
<font color="#ffff80">He came over after work.</font>

1432
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:23,111
<font color="#ffff80">Did you have sex?
No!</font>

1433
01:20:23,403 --> 01:20:26,740
<font color="#ffff80">I know I said I would, but you looked
so sad when I won, I couldn't.</font>

1434
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:29,617
<font color="#ffff80">I chickened out and
said I had Chlamydia!</font>

1435
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:32,746
<font color="#ffff80">That's right, bitch!
Chlamydia!</font>

1436
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:35,123
<font color="#ffff80">He can't have sex till
he finishes his Z-Pak!</font>

1437
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:38,460
<font color="#ffff80">Mark's not just a cheating scumbag.
He's a thief.</font>

1438
01:20:38,752 --> 01:20:41,921
<font color="#ffff80">Look what I found. This is a list
of all the start-up companies...</font>

1439
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:45,800
<font color="#ffff80">...Mark's invested in. Three are
offshore and one's a blind filing.</font>

1440
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:49,429
<font color="#ffff80">No board of directors,
a P.O. box for an address...</font>

1441
01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:52,307
<font color="#ffff80">...and it's been operating at
a total loss in the Bahamas.</font>

1442
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:54,225
<font color="#ffff80">ServiceCircuit.</font>

1443
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:57,437
<font color="#ffff80">That's not right. I heard about
ServiceCircuit last night.</font>

1444
01:20:57,562 --> 01:20:59,272
<font color="#ffff80">They're putting
more money into it.</font>

1445
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:00,857
<font color="#ffff80">That's part of the con.</font>

1446
01:21:00,982 --> 01:21:02,317
<font color="#ffff80">We just need to find
the bank he's using.</font>

1447
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:03,860
<font color="#ffff80">I was with
the board last night.</font>

1448
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:06,863
<font color="#ffff80">They seem really happy.
Mark is making them rich!</font>

1449
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:10,658
<font color="#ffff80">He's stealing, Kate. Making money
for them is the way he does it.</font>

1450
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,452
<font color="#ffff80">Kate, what's going on?</font>

1451
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:16,998
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing. I just think it's more
complicated than we thought.</font>

1452
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:20,543
<font color="#ffff80">You slept with him.</font>

1453
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:23,088
<font color="#ffff80">One night, and you go
back to being a Stepford?</font>

1454
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:24,297
<font color="#ffff80">What am I supposed to do?</font>

1455
01:21:24,506 --> 01:21:27,175
<font color="#ffff80">He must have literally
screwed your brains out!</font>

1456
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:30,970
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe you just have to forgive
people to move forward.</font>

1457
01:21:31,179 --> 01:21:32,847
<font color="#ffff80">But he didn't ask for
forgiveness, did he?</font>

1458
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:35,809
<font color="#ffff80">If you had something to lose, you'd
understand how hard this is.</font>

1459
01:21:36,017 --> 01:21:38,853
<font color="#ffff80">Like what, a cheating
husband of my own? Stop.</font>

1460
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:42,524
<font color="#ffff80">Things shifted this weekend. It
was different. You don't know.</font>

1461
01:21:42,816 --> 01:21:43,983
<font color="#ffff80">Really?</font>

1462
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:49,948
<font color="#ffff80">What are you doing? Seeing
if Mark wants to hang out.</font>

1463
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:51,449
<font color="#ffff80">What's wrong with you?</font>

1464
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:52,659
<font color="#ffff80">Everything!</font>

1465
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:54,160
<font color="#ffff80">Everything is wrong with you.</font>

1466
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:57,664
<font color="#ffff80">And I feel like an idiot
for trusting you over him.</font>

1467
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,499
<font color="#ffff80">I am done!</font>

1468
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:05,004
<font color="#ffff80">Kate, wait.</font>

1469
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:49,549
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing from Amber, either?</font>

1470
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:53,219
<font color="#ffff80">No. And I feel like if Amber
won't talk to me, then...</font>

1471
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,388
<font color="#ffff80">...obviously I
did something wrong.</font>

1472
01:22:56,556 --> 01:22:58,183
<font color="#ffff80">I think you're
being hard on yourself.</font>

1473
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:00,018
<font color="#ffff80">I can't tell.</font>

1474
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:03,563
<font color="#ffff80">I care so much,</font>

1475
01:23:03,688 --> 01:23:06,065
<font color="#ffff80">and then it just
comes out so harsh.</font>

1476
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:09,402
<font color="#ffff80">You know, what the hell do you know?
You get it wrong all the time.</font>

1477
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:14,532
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry.</font>

1478
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:16,576
<font color="#ffff80">I'm usually a fun date.
lam.</font>

1479
01:23:16,868 --> 01:23:18,119
<font color="#ffff80">I'm having fun.</font>

1480
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:20,747
<font color="#ffff80">Not a lot of it, but some.</font>

1481
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:25,376
<font color="#ffff80">You should think
about being nicer to me...</font>

1482
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:28,087
<font color="#ffff80">...'cause I'm not certain
I really like you yet.</font>

1483
01:23:28,922 --> 01:23:29,923
<font color="#ffff80">I think you like me.</font>

1484
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:31,090
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Do I'.</i></font>

1485
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,101
<font color="#ffff80">Hmm.</font>

1486
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,772
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

1487
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:46,856
<font color="#ffff80">Oh!</font>

1488
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,776
<font color="#ffff80">Don't get too close to me.
I'm getting sick.</font>

1489
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:51,402
<font color="#ffff80">What's wrong?</font>

1490
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:54,614
<font color="#ffff80">I went to the doctor.
He gave me a Z-Pak.</font>

1491
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:58,618
<font color="#ffff80">He said something nasty's going
around, and you should take one, too.</font>

1492
01:23:58,743 --> 01:23:59,786
<font color="#ffff80">That's for you.</font>

1493
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:01,788
<font color="#ffff80">A Z-Pak?
But I'm not sick.</font>

1494
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:06,084
<font color="#ffff80">That's why you take it beforehand.
It's prophylactic.</font>

1495
01:24:14,926 --> 01:24:18,304
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, honey? I need you to
sign some papers for me.</font>

1496
01:24:18,805 --> 01:24:22,934
<font color="#ffff80">If you could, do it today. No need to
read it-- it's just the usual stuff.</font>

1497
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:28,147
<font color="#ffff80">It's boring stuff from the accountant.
ServiceCircuit again.</font>

1498
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:32,151
<font color="#ffff80">Plus, I'm traveling to Miami
and the Bahamas.</font>

1499
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:37,448
<font color="#ffff80">Did you just say something
about the Bahamas?</font>

1500
01:24:54,882 --> 01:24:56,217
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry.</font>

1501
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:57,844
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, I feel so awful.</font>

1502
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:02,056
<font color="#ffff80">No, you were right about everything.
And he's still lying to me.</font>

1503
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:03,975
<font color="#ffff80">He's still treating
me like I'm blind.</font>

1504
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,727
<font color="#ffff80">You're not.</font>

1505
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:13,234
<font color="#ffff80">I found this-- wire transfer instructions
for a company in the Bahamas.</font>

1506
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:15,194
<font color="#ffff80">Mark is flying
down this week.</font>

1507
01:25:15,403 --> 01:25:17,447
<font color="#ffff80">You said we just
had to find out where</font>

1508
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:19,574
<font color="#ffff80">he banks, so let's
go to the Bahamas...</font>

1509
01:25:19,866 --> 01:25:21,534
<font color="#ffff80">...and let's get him!</font>

1510
01:25:21,743 --> 01:25:25,913
<font color="#ffff80">Kate, I'm sorry,
but I can't.</font>

1511
01:25:26,414 --> 01:25:28,708
<font color="#ffff80">I can't stay in this
Mark moment forever.</font>

1512
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:33,087
<font color="#ffff80">If I'm investigating him
or I go to the Bahamas...</font>

1513
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,423
<font color="#ffff80">...then I'm still involved,
and...</font>

1514
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:39,427
<font color="#ffff80">.“and i just
can't do that anymore.</font>

1515
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:41,471
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry.</font>

1516
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:45,725
<font color="#ffff80">No, okay.
I get it. Okay.</font>

1517
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:49,228
<font color="#ffff80">Okay. I just, um...</font>

1518
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:50,772
<font color="#ffff80">Hey.
Hmm?</font>

1519
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:53,316
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you.</font>

1520
01:25:54,067 --> 01:25:55,068
<font color="#ffff80">For what?</font>

1521
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:59,155
<font color="#ffff80">For basically forcing
me to be your friend.</font>

1522
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:02,992
<font color="#ffff80">You wanted to be friends, too.
You just didn't know it.</font>

1523
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:04,661
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, well...</font>

1524
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:06,496
<font color="#ffff80">You jumped out
a window for me.</font>

1525
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,289
<font color="#ffff80">You pushed me.</font>

1526
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:09,624
<font color="#ffff80">I shoved you.</font>

1527
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:11,584
<font color="#ffff80">Hard, too.</font>

1528
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:15,171
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.
I'll keep you in the loop?</font>

1529
01:26:16,089 --> 01:26:17,256
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

1530
01:26:17,757 --> 01:26:18,925
<font color="#ffff80">Bye.</font>

1531
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:41,656
<font color="#ffff80">I'll be damned.</font>

1532
01:26:54,502 --> 01:26:56,879
<font color="#ffff80">Kate!
Kate!</font>

1533
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,469
<font color="#ffff80">You guys came!</font>

1534
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:11,144
<font color="#ffff80">You think we could
let a sister down?</font>

1535
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:13,688
<font color="#ffff80">We're getting
the band back together.</font>

1536
01:27:14,355 --> 01:27:15,857
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Those bank transfers...</i></font>

1537
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:19,986
<font color="#ffff80"><i>...were for ServiceCircuit. Guess
whose signature is all over them?</i></font>

1538
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:21,154
<font color="#ffff80"><i>KATE". Mark's.</i></font>

1539
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:22,905
<font color="#ffff80">No! Yours! You're the CEO.</font>

1540
01:27:23,156 --> 01:27:24,782
<font color="#ffff80">He used you to
create the company</font>

1541
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,534
<font color="#ffff80">and put everything
in your name.</font>

1542
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:28,703
<font color="#ffff80">He's neck-deep in
fraud and if anything</font>

1543
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:30,663
<font color="#ffff80">goes down, they'll
come after you first!</font>

1544
01:27:30,747 --> 01:27:32,123
<font color="#ffff80">You're his fall guy!</font>

1545
01:27:32,206 --> 01:27:33,833
<font color="#ffff80">You could go to jail!</font>

1546
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:35,543
<font color="#ffff80">I can't go to jail!
No,no,no.</font>

1547
01:27:35,877 --> 01:27:37,170
<font color="#ffff80">Turn the car around!</font>

1548
01:27:37,295 --> 01:27:38,546
<font color="#ffff80">No one's going to jail.</font>

1549
01:27:38,838 --> 01:27:40,006
<font color="#ffff80">I am not Martha Stewart!</font>

1550
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:43,217
<font color="#ffff80">I will wind up in gen pop.
Turn around.</font>

1551
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:46,888
<font color="#ffff80">I can't join a gang! I don't
know how to make shanks!</font>

1552
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:50,767
<font color="#ffff80">I have soft hands and a small mouth.
I will be the bottom!</font>

1553
01:27:51,017 --> 01:27:52,351
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you going?</font>

1554
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:53,603
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want to
make license plates!</font>

1555
01:27:53,728 --> 01:27:54,771
<font color="#ffff80">You won't go to jail.</font>

1556
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:56,355
<font color="#ffff80">Turn the car around!</font>

1557
01:27:56,606 --> 01:27:59,275
<font color="#ffff80">Go back! Go back!</font>

1558
01:27:59,776 --> 01:28:01,360
<font color="#ffff80">My name's all over everything!</font>

1559
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:05,698
<font color="#ffff80">That's the good news!
Your name's on everything.</font>

1560
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:09,285
<font color="#ffff80">What are you talking about?
Do you know what she means?</font>

1561
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:11,788
<font color="#ffff80">We need to find
Mark and his bank.</font>

1562
01:28:12,038 --> 01:28:13,790
<font color="#ffff80">I know Mark is at
the One and Only.</font>

1563
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:15,750
<font color="#ffff80">Perfect,
we're halfway there!</font>

1564
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:33,059
<font color="#ffff80">You see him?</font>

1565
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:34,393
<font color="#ffff80">Not yet.</font>

1566
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:36,020
<font color="#ffff80">How do you know he's here?</font>

1567
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:37,563
<font color="#ffff80">GPS does not lie.</font>

1568
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:39,065
<font color="#ffff80">I think I see a dolphin!</font>

1569
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:40,942
<font color="#ffff80">I got him! I got him!</font>

1570
01:28:51,744 --> 01:28:54,080
<font color="#ffff80">Right there.
Twelve o'clock.</font>

1571
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:58,084
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, what are we looking for?
What's the clue?</font>

1572
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:00,920
<font color="#ffff80">How about that clue?</font>

1573
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:03,130
<font color="#ffff80">He's taken this
shit international!</font>

1574
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:05,925
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, come on.</font>

1575
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:10,096
<font color="#ffff80">Every time I look through binoculars,
he has another mistress.</font>

1576
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:11,806
<font color="#ffff80">You think he has
more than one here?</font>

1577
01:29:12,098 --> 01:29:15,101
<font color="#ffff80">Who cares? Where else has he
traveled? Please don't tell me Thailand.</font>

1578
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:18,855
<font color="#ffff80">Why can't he stuff it into
a tube sock like a normal guy?</font>

1579
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:20,606
<font color="#ffff80">I have so many
lotions at the house.</font>

1580
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:55,641
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, there it is--
the end of the road.</font>

1581
01:29:57,143 --> 01:29:59,103
<font color="#ffff80">Well, if we don't
leave until tomorrow,</font>

1582
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:02,148
<font color="#ffff80">I say it's our turn to take
this shit international.</font>

1583
01:30:31,177 --> 01:30:32,511
<font color="#ffff80">That was so much fun!</font>

1584
01:30:32,637 --> 01:30:34,013
<font color="#ffff80">So much fun!</font>

1585
01:30:34,347 --> 01:30:36,515
<font color="#ffff80">Can we get three punches,
please?</font>

1586
01:30:36,849 --> 01:30:38,184
<font color="#ffff80">Three punches.</font>

1587
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:42,855
<font color="#ffff80">Come join me.</font>

1588
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:44,857
<font color="#ffff80">Me?
Yeah, you.</font>

1589
01:30:45,066 --> 01:30:46,400
<font color="#ffff80">Come join me.</font>

1590
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:49,528
<font color="#ffff80">What? No.
 Go.</font>

1591
01:30:54,367 --> 01:30:56,369
<font color="#ffff80">Who you sending the selfie to?</font>

1592
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,747
<font color="#ffff80">I just started seeing someone.</font>

1593
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:01,791
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm. Yeah?</font>

1594
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:05,711
<font color="#ffff80">It's completely crazy, and I
don't know where it's going...</font>

1595
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,047
<font color="#ffff80">...but we just
have that twinkle.</font>

1596
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:12,051
<font color="#ffff80">Right.</font>

1597
01:31:14,387 --> 01:31:15,721
<font color="#ffff80">I do know.</font>

1598
01:31:16,097 --> 01:31:17,723
<font color="#ffff80">You know what?</font>

1599
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:21,727
<font color="#ffff80">The best thing to do is just
not think about it too hard.</font>

1600
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:26,232
<font color="#ffff80">As long as it works,
it doesn't really matter why.</font>

1601
01:31:28,359 --> 01:31:29,360
<font color="#ffff80">Hey!</font>

1602
01:31:35,241 --> 01:31:37,284
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, God.</font>

1603
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:37,733
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, can I help you?
I can help you!</font>

1604
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:41,237
<font color="#ffff80">Mark King
to see Miss Whitten.</font>

1605
01:35:41,487 --> 01:35:43,322
<font color="#ffff80">Mark? Hi.</font>

1606
01:35:43,989 --> 01:35:45,991
<font color="#ffff80">Are you the famous Mark?</font>

1607
01:35:46,325 --> 01:35:47,451
<font color="#ffff80">I must be. You are...?</font>

1608
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:48,661
<font color="#ffff80">Lydia.</font>

1609
01:35:49,328 --> 01:35:51,997
<font color="#ffff80">I get it.
Things are coming into focus.</font>

1610
01:35:52,498 --> 01:35:53,666
<font color="#ffff80">Good things, I hope.</font>

1611
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:55,000
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, of course.</font>

1612
01:35:55,251 --> 01:35:58,003
<font color="#ffff80">Miss Whitten asked if you would
wait in the conference room.</font>

1613
01:35:58,504 --> 01:36:00,256
<font color="#ffff80">Ah...
Right this way.</font>

1614
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,231
<font color="#ffff80">Ugh.</font>

1615
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,861
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, Mark.</font>

1616
01:36:25,197 --> 01:36:26,365
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, Mark.</font>

1617
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:28,534
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, boy.</font>

1618
01:36:30,244 --> 01:36:31,870
<font color="#ffff80">This is awkward.</font>

1619
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:34,707
<font color="#ffff80">I want a divorce, Mark.
No.</font>

1620
01:36:36,709 --> 01:36:38,043
<font color="#ffff80">Don't do this.
I love you.</font>

1621
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,211
<font color="#ffff80">It's too late for that.</font>

1622
01:36:39,545 --> 01:36:41,130
<font color="#ffff80">Please don't do this.</font>

1623
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:45,217
<font color="#ffff80">Have I made mistakes?
Yes. Big ones. Huge ones.</font>

1624
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:48,470
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, but when you sleep
with that many people...</font>

1625
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:51,140
<font color="#ffff80">...it's not a mistake, honey.
It's pathological.</font>

1626
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:53,726
<font color="#ffff80">It is.
But we can work it out.</font>

1627
01:36:54,393 --> 01:36:56,145
<font color="#ffff80">I can change.
You can help me.</font>

1628
01:36:56,562 --> 01:36:57,980
<font color="#ffff80">How many were there?</font>

1629
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:01,233
<font color="#ffff80">Affairs?
You're looking at it.</font>

1630
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:08,574
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, one more. A couple, maybe.
Uh...three.</font>

1631
01:37:09,366 --> 01:37:11,327
<font color="#ffff80">Five, maybe...</font>

1632
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:12,786
<font color="#ffff80">What do you want me to say?</font>

1633
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:14,413
<font color="#ffff80">I get more ass
than a toilet seat!</font>

1634
01:37:14,913 --> 01:37:17,249
<font color="#ffff80">I'm insecure.
l have issues.</font>

1635
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:19,710
<font color="#ffff80">It's not like I cared
about any of them.</font>

1636
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:21,628
<font color="#ffff80">They were all flings,
and they knew it.</font>

1637
01:37:21,754 --> 01:37:24,923
<font color="#ffff80">Except for Carly.
We were exclusive.</font>

1638
01:37:25,174 --> 01:37:28,427
<font color="#ffff80">You told me you'd get a divorce
and we'd move to Tuscany.</font>

1639
01:37:28,677 --> 01:37:31,597
<font color="#ffff80">I did say that, but nothing
I ever told you was true.</font>

1640
01:37:31,847 --> 01:37:33,807
<font color="#ffff80">Mark, you're a real
piece of shit.</font>

1641
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:35,059
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.</font>

1642
01:37:35,142 --> 01:37:39,146
<font color="#ffff80">And no matter how many women you
sleep with, or cars you buy...</font>

1643
01:37:39,438 --> 01:37:43,150
<font color="#ffff80">...nothing will be enough to
fill the hole inside you...</font>

1644
01:37:43,442 --> 01:37:45,361
<font color="#ffff80">...where
something real should be.</font>

1645
01:37:45,444 --> 01:37:48,238
<font color="#ffff80">- You are an empty man.
Mmm-hmm.</font>

1646
01:37:48,322 --> 01:37:50,324
<font color="#ffff80">If you weren't as
disgusting as you were...</font>

1647
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:52,951
<font color="#ffff80">...I would have never known
that I needed to change.</font>

1648
01:37:53,035 --> 01:37:54,953
<font color="#ffff80">Mmm-hmm.
I realized that with you.</font>

1649
01:37:55,162 --> 01:37:58,499
<font color="#ffff80">You're so much better now.
Thank you.</font>

1650
01:37:58,832 --> 01:38:01,001
<font color="#ffff80">Anyway,
speaking of changes...</font>

1651
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:04,296
<font color="#ffff80">What is this?</font>

1652
01:38:04,505 --> 01:38:05,839
<font color="#ffff80">Divorce papers.</font>

1653
01:38:06,465 --> 01:38:08,801
<font color="#ffff80">We valued everything
you own, and...</font>

1654
01:38:09,009 --> 01:38:12,137
<font color="#ffff80">...that number at the bottom
is your joint net worth.</font>

1655
01:38:14,014 --> 01:38:15,974
<font color="#ffff80">You girls think
you can shake me down</font>

1656
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,018
<font color="#ffff80">for all my money,
you're crazy.</font>

1657
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:21,522
<font color="#ffff80">Not all. Just half. That's
what equal partners get--50%.</font>

1658
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:24,900
<font color="#ffff80">Though we did have to
significantly reduce your share.</font>

1659
01:38:29,655 --> 01:38:32,991
<font color="#ffff80">What is this?
Why does it say zero?</font>

1660
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,660
<font color="#ffff80">The money you stole
from ServiceCircuit?</font>

1661
01:38:34,785 --> 01:38:36,203
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know
anything about that.</font>

1662
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:38,664
<font color="#ffff80">That's funny, neither did I.
But apparently...</font>

1663
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:42,543
<font color="#ffff80">...I'm the CEO. I'm the CEO of
several companies, actually.</font>

1664
01:38:42,876 --> 01:38:45,003
<font color="#ffff80">But sadly, I had to
empty those accounts.</font>

1665
01:38:45,212 --> 01:38:47,714
<font color="#ffff80">Empty? What are
you talking about? How...?</font>

1666
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:49,675
<font color="#ffff80">We looked.</font>

1667
01:38:49,758 --> 01:38:51,510
<font color="#ffff80">That's what happens
when you piss people off.</font>

1668
01:38:51,844 --> 01:38:56,056
<font color="#ffff80">What? You robbed me.
You three girls robbed me.</font>

1669
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:58,183
<font color="#ffff80">No way! I don't buy it.</font>

1670
01:38:58,392 --> 01:39:01,061
<font color="#ffff80">You don't have it
in you to rip me off.</font>

1671
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:02,896
<font color="#ffff80">You sure about that?
Yes!</font>

1672
01:39:03,188 --> 01:39:07,693
<font color="#ffff80">Didn't you notice our skin?
That nice Bahamian glow?</font>

1673
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:10,571
<font color="#ffff80">Incredible.
He didn't even notice!</font>

1674
01:39:10,863 --> 01:39:12,197
<font color="#ffff80">Honestly, Katie...</font>

1675
01:39:12,406 --> 01:39:14,533
<font color="#ffff80">...I don't know
what's going on with you,</font>

1676
01:39:14,658 --> 01:39:16,743
<font color="#ffff80">but for your sake,
I hope you're lying.</font>

1677
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:19,538
<font color="#ffff80">It's your signature
all over those contracts.</font>

1678
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:22,416
<font color="#ffff80">It's you who's liable.
So don't threaten me, honey.</font>

1679
01:39:22,749 --> 01:39:24,626
<font color="#ffff80">Because if you did
empty those accounts,</font>

1680
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:26,587
<font color="#ffff80">you're the one
going down, not me.</font>

1681
01:39:26,879 --> 01:39:29,923
<font color="#ffff80">We thought you might say that.
Then Carly explained...</font>

1682
01:39:30,215 --> 01:39:32,217
<font color="#ffff80">...a concept
called restitution.</font>

1683
01:39:32,426 --> 01:39:34,928
<font color="#ffff80">Or payback. That's how
we framed it with Nick.</font>

1684
01:39:35,429 --> 01:39:37,097
<font color="#ffff80">You
framed it with Nick, now?</font>

1685
01:39:37,431 --> 01:39:40,434
<font color="#ffff80">You included Nick?
Bullshit! Now I know you're--</font>

1686
01:39:40,767 --> 01:39:44,438
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, Nick!
Hey, man! I... What?</font>

1687
01:39:46,607 --> 01:39:48,609
<font color="#ffff80">I don't know
what they told you.</font>

1688
01:39:48,942 --> 01:39:51,278
<font color="#ffff80">They're having some kind
of group breakdown.</font>

1689
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:53,780
<font color="#ffff80">They didn't tell me anything.
They showed me.</font>

1690
01:39:54,281 --> 01:39:57,951
<font color="#ffff80">It's over. I'm getting my ideas
direct from the factory now.</font>

1691
01:39:58,285 --> 01:40:02,789
<font color="#ffff80">What? From her?! Is this some kind of joke?
You're firing me?</font>

1692
01:40:03,081 --> 01:40:06,793
<font color="#ffff80">Firing you is the least of it. The only
reason you're not going to prison...</font>

1693
01:40:07,085 --> 01:40:09,129
<font color="#ffff80">...is because your wife
repaid all the money.</font>

1694
01:40:09,463 --> 01:40:12,299
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, no, no, no.
You're all lying.</font>

1695
01:40:12,633 --> 01:40:16,970
<font color="#ffff80">It's bullshit. it's bullshit!
Global bullshit! I call bullshit!</font>

1696
01:40:17,262 --> 01:40:18,597
<font color="#ffff80">Bullshit! ! !!</font>

1697
01:40:18,805 --> 01:40:20,641
<font color="#ffff80">My wife's not some
criminal mastermind.</font>

1698
01:40:20,933 --> 01:40:24,770
<font color="#ffff80">She needs freakin' brain camp!
That's my money!!!</font>

1699
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:36,323
<font color="#ffff80">Mark, you're not
a very nice person.</font>

1700
01:40:36,657 --> 01:40:37,991
<font color="#ffff80">Shut up!!</font>

1701
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,664
<font color="#ffff80">Get away. Get away, get away!</font>

1702
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:46,458
<font color="#ffff80">That can't be right.
It's a trick!</font>

1703
01:40:48,293 --> 01:40:49,294
<font color="#ffff80">No!</font>

1704
01:40:51,004 --> 01:40:54,341
<font color="#ffff80">No,no,no,no!</font>

01:40:54,675 --> 01:40:56,301
<font color="#ffff80">That's my money!</font>

1706
01:40:59,137 --> 01:41:00,806
<font color="#ffff80">You won't get
away with this.</font>

1707
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:02,808

1710
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:46,059
<font color="#ffff80">Hey,buddy!
I'm here! Stop!</font>

1711
01:41:46,351 --> 01:41:47,686
<font color="#ffff80">It's already hooked.</font>

1712
01:41:47,894 --> 01:41:49,229
<font color="#ffff80">It's barely in the red!</font>

1713
01:41:49,354 --> 01:41:50,689
<font color="#ffff80">It's already
in the air, guy.</font>

1714
01:41:51,356 --> 01:41:53,025
<font color="#ffff80">That's a $300,000 car,
asshole!</font>

1715
01:41:53,233 --> 01:41:54,693
<font color="#ffff80">You can afford it, then.</font>

1716
01:41:55,902 --> 01:41:57,070
<font color="#ffff80">Welcome to New York.</font>

1717

01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:06,079
<font color="#ffff80">You mother--</font>

1720
01:42:12,044 --> 01:42:15,589
<font color="#ffff80">Huh, could this day
get any worse? Really?!!</font>

1721
01:42:16,465 --> 01:42:17,549
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

1722
01:42:21,887 --> 01:42:23,889
<font color="#ffff80">Next time,
call a plumber.</font>

1723
01:42:29,728 --> 01:42:31,563
<font color="#ffff80">There she is!</font>

1724
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:39,279

1727
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:44,951
<font color="#ffff80">Can I make a toast?</font>

1728
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:48,288
<font color="#ffff80">Here's to having friends...</font>

1729
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:52,250
<font color="#ffff80">...friends that
love every part of you.</font>

1730
01:42:52,459 --> 01:42:53,877
<font color="#ffff80">And though it
brought us together,</font>

1731
01:42:54,002 --> 01:42:55,420
<font color="#ffff80">let's never sleep
with the same guy again.</font>

1732
01:42:55,629 --> 01:42:57,255
<font color="#ffff80">Good idea. Never Even</font>
