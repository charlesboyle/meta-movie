1
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:46,503
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.

2
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,923
Having my friends here is great,
but it's like,

3
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,886
making my self-esteem
go down really bad.

4
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,102
And they look so good,
and they're just like,

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,773
like the hottest girls in the world,
and here I am just like...

6
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,935
...and you're...
- Babe.

7
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,487
I got to get ready.
- No, you don't. Come here.

8
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,238
That's just it.
- What?

9
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,319
Kendra, you are
the most beautiful woman.

10
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,489
And don't let anybody
coming around...

11
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,770
...after you just had a baby,
make you not feel that way, babe.

12
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,411
You want that?

13
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,541
All right, come on. Follow me.

14
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,291
Kendal Strickland wasn't just
the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep,

15
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,579
she was a legend.

16
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:47,672
As a junior, the student council voted
to dedicate the yearbook to her,

17
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,807
even though another
student had recently died.

18
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,427
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.

19
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,924
We need that draft of Waverley 178.

20
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,641
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.

21
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,476
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?

22
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,938
When you send something that soon,
it's for the inner circle.

23
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,316
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the
father who doesn't talk to him anymore.

24
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,898
Frankly,
that's a slap in the face. Right?

25
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,616
You seem a little overly
worked up about this.

26
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,285
I am not worked up in the slightest.

27
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,830
I was just trying to tell you
about something that happened. God!

28
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,951
Well, good for them, right?

29
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,424
Buddy seems like he'd be
a decent parent.

30
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,319
Can you imagine
still living in Mercury?

31
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,963
Trapped with a wife and a kid,
and some crappy job?

32
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,131
It's like...

33
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,470
It's like he's a hostage.

34
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,726
Yup. We're lucky we got out.

35
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,979
Yes.
- We have lives.

36
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,532
Let me let you borrow an outfit
'cause that dress is hideous, honey.

37
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,952
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come
with me now to the TV Guide party

38
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,830
because who wants to go
to a party by themselves?

39
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,076
It's to die for.
- That is fab.

40
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,507
I just think
that Tyler and I are like soul twins.

41
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,972
You know? Right before he texts me,

42
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,511
it's like I can...
- Sense it?

43
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,555
Yes! Like psychically.

44
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,516
It's like we have chemistry,
even over our phones.

45
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,929
Like text chemistry.

46
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,266
Exactly.

47
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,734
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message
from Ryan popped up like magic.

48
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,397
It couldn't be denied.

49
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,858
They had "textual chemistry."

50
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,591
So, all told, I spent a year
in Southeast Asia.

51
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,759
Why?

52
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,687
Long story short, I ended up
a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.

53
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,225
Oh, my God. Yikes.

54
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:38,641
Yeah, it was probably one of the most
rewarding things I've ever done.

55
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,815
Of course.

56
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,109
Sure, totally.

57
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,842
I didn't want to hurt you

58
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,638
Oh, yeah

59
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Dolce, take a pee.

60
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,497
Dolce, pee.

61
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:49,296
She wears denim wherever she goes

62
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:53,675
Says she's gonna get some records
by the Status Quo

63
00:09:53,843 --> 00:10:00,098
Oh, yeah

64
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,153
I didn't want to hurt you

65
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,907
Oh, yeah

66
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,834
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?

67
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,430
No.

68
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,104
Mavis...

69
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,943
...Gary.

70
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,740
Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.

71
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,375
We actually allow small pets
with a cleaning deposit.

72
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,288
Good, because I have a small dog,

73
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,456
in my vehicle.

74
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,213
I'll put that you have a dog.

75
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,181
How many keys do you need?

76
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,301
Two, please.

77
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,430
Expecting company?

78
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,367
Hi. You.

79
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Personal.

80
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:13,249
Mercury, Minnesota.

81
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,418
Slade.

82
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,443
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.

83
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,744
I love Mason more than I love you.

84
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,080
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.

85
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,749
Remember? Mavis Gary?

86
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,842
I'm in town for this
little real estate thing,

87
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,580
and I... I don't know,
I just thought if you have time,

88
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,051
and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?

89
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,678
Something like that.

90
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:12,350
All right, well, listen,
call me and... and let me know.

91
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,352
All right, bye.

92
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,464
Fuck.

93
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,594
Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.

94
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,848
It's been... how long?
- I'm not sure.

95
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,185
Gosh. Wow.

96
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,735
So you're actually back in town, huh?

97
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,779
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.

98
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,152
I am insanely busy as always.

99
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,202
Well, I don't know
how long you're around

100
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:52,141
with your real estate thing,
but I'd love to grab a drink.

101
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,459
OK.

102
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,790
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,

103
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,001
I could meet you at Woody's in...

104
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,505
...I don't know, 15 minutes?

105
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,304
Spontaneous really isn't
a thing these days.

106
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,484
I don't know if you heard,
but I am a new dad.

107
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,475
Everyone knows. Yeah, the whole gang.

108
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,144
I got that announcement.

109
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:25,114
Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.

110
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,740
How about we meet tomorrow

111
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,201
at this place called
Champion O'Malley's?

112
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,740
It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes. Yeah.

113
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,619
How does 8:00, 8:30 sound?

114
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,400
6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.

115
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,583
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.

116
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,357
Maker's Mark.

117
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,641
What?

118
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,379
I'm sorry, but I think
we went to high school together.

119
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,022
At the same time?
- Yeah.

120
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,518
You're Mavis Gary?

121
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,731
Mavis Gary-Crane now.

122
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,447
I'm Matt Freehauf.

123
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,950
My locker was actually next to yours,

124
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,321
all through high school.

125
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,326
Matt... Freehauf.

126
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,042
Yeah.

127
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,455
Yeah, your locker was right there.

128
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,130
Right next to mine.

129
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,174
We didn't run in the same circles.

130
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,094
You were pretty popular,
if I remember correctly.

131
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,174
You won "Best Hair."

132
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,927
Did I?
What did you win?

133
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,519
I didn't.

134
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,146
They usually give out,
like, 15 of those,

135
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,726
and only to the same five people.

136
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,653
Yeah, well, listen, Matt,
it was really nice seeing you...

137
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,400
What are you doing back
in Mercury? You move back?

138
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,568
Of course not. Gross.

139
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,695
No, I live in Minneapolis.

140
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,915
I'm just here taking care
of a little real estate thing.

141
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,085
I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.

142
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,205
Yes, I am an author.

143
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,672
Children's books.

144
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,044
Y.A. That's industry speak
for "Young Adult."

145
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,505
It's a very popular teen series.

146
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,179
It's everywhere. It's huge.

147
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,135
You've probably seen it.
- Vampires?

148
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,397
Hey, take that, liver.

149
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,511
Weren't you that hate crime guy?

150
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,543
Excuse me?

151
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,540
You totally were.

152
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,590
You're the hate crime guy.

153
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,176
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?

154
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,296
Now I know who you are.

155
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,341
Matt, the hate crime guy.

156
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,552
Yes, Mavis. When I was a...

157
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,680
When we were seniors,

158
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,190
a bunch of jocks who thought
I was gay jumped me in the woods...

159
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,399
That's right.

160
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,985
...and hit me on the legs
and dick with a crowbar.

161
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,738
With a crowbar. I totally remember that.

162
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,281
It was national news.

163
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,493
I mean, until people found out
that I wasn't really gay.

164
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,364
Then it wasn't a hate crime anymore.

165
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,868
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.

166
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,668
Didn't you get to miss
a bunch of school?

167
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:11,500
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.

168
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,128
Fuck. How's your dick?

169
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,466
Not good. Not good.

170
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,094
Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.

171
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,450
You know, it's just kind of does a...

172
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,604
Hard Jacks.

173
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,321
Do you know who drinks these?

174
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,198
I don't.

175
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,945
Buddy Slade.

176
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,738
That's an interesting fact.

177
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,574
Come here.

178
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,843
Do you wanna know
why I'm really in town?

179
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,541
Yes.

180
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,632
I can't tell you in here.

181
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,346
OK, you got me out here.

182
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,890
All right.

183
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,810
Here's the deal.

184
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,377
Buddy Slade and I are
meant to be together.

185
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,821
And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade. All right.

186
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,037
I'm pretty sure he's married
with a kid on the way.

187
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,914
No, kid's here. She already had it.

188
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,792
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.

189
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,912
So wait, are you not joking?

190
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,422
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.

191
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,633
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.

192
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,178
They just tend to happen in slow motion.

193
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,891
They get divorced, they reconfigure,
and society is, like, fine with that...

194
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:48,639
...if you take your time,
like an emotional glacier. I'm 37...

195
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,688
Mavis, I would keep
all of this to yourself.

196
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,147
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.

197
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,441
Matt.
- Oh, boy.

198
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,365
Don't you get it?

199
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,570
Love conquers all.

200
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,273
Have you not seen The Graduate?

201
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,659
Or, like, I don't know, anything?

202
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,500
Oh, a taxi.

203
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,663
Yes, we called it.

204
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,831
Mavis, hey!

205
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,834
Buddy Slade has a life.

206
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,459
Buddy Slade has a life. No, he has
a baby, and babies are boring!

207
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,629
Having spent the summer
outside Waverley Prep,

208
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,215
Kendal looked around
at her fellow students, thinking,

209
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:03,047
"Did I really get that much better,
or did everyone simply get worse?

210
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,235
Why was Ryan spending so much time
with this dumpy new girl?"

211
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,186
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?

212
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,302
I'm trying to help you,
but I can't if you...

213
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:33,304
Says she likes my hair
'cause it's down my back

214
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:38,476
Says she likes the group
'cause we pull in the slack

215
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,643
Oh, yeah

216
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,110
Oh, no, not gonna need those.

217
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,119
You're gonna wanna
try the popcorn shrimp.

218
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,407
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.

219
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,035
OK.

220
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,327
Hey.

221
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,447
Hey, you.

222
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,078
Wow.
- Great to see you.

223
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,089
So...

224
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,545
This is quite the mid-week surprise.

225
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,716
Hey, I ordered us
a couple of Hard Jacks.

226
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,641
I haven't had one of those
since college.

227
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,101
I know, me neither.

228
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,640
But I thought, just for old times' sake.

229
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,768
Actually, I haven't
been drinking recently.

230
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,819
Because during Beth's pregnancy,
and now that she's nursing our girl,

231
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,816
I thought I'd show some solidarity.

232
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,574
Right.

233
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,694
So...

234
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,281
You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.

235
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,449
Ad sales now.

236
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,792
My dad's still there,
so we have lunch together most days.

237
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:07,499
Yeah. Pizza or sub sandwiches.

238
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,382
Awesome.

239
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,010
I've just been working
my little butt off in the city.

240
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,845
You know, doing my thing.

241
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,597
Down there in the old Mini Apple?

242
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,345
God, Buddy. Nobody calls it
the Mini Apple anymore.

243
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,597
I didn't know.

244
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,151
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.

245
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,314
Give our waitress a break.

246
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,149
So chivalrous.

247
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,914
Mavis.

248
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,213
What are you doing here?

249
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,006
I work here.

250
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,128
You know, bookkeeping,
dealing with vendors.

251
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,137
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?

252
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,093
Just catching up with a friend.

253
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,553
Oh, catching up with a friend.

254
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,146
There's Buddy Slade,

255
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,894
acquiring a couple
of mind-erasers at the bar.

256
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,902
You're not wasting any time, are you?

257
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,072
Look, it was really great hanging out
with you last night.

258
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,157
It was great.
- OK.

259
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,701
Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.

260
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,905
What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.

261
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,122
Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.

262
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,165
What a wonderful,
permanent commitment to make.

263
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,167
Yeah.
- Yeah.

264
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,235
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?

265
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,840
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.

266
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,633
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?

267
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,302
Yeah.

268
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,506
It's so nice running into him.

269
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,675
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.

270
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,141
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.

271
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,271
You wanna join us for a round?

272
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,099
I would love to. I would.

273
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,650
Sadly, I have work to do,
and it takes me twice as long

274
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,653
as an able-bodied person to complete
even the simplest task.

275
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,773
So...
- Bummer.

276
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,070
I don't wanna step on
your Mercury High reunion. So...

277
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,239
Go, go, Injuns.

278
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:08,245
Actually, they changed the name
to "Indians" back in '99, remember?

279
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,956
The local Fond du Lac tribe...

280
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,417
did a whole thing with...

281
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,925
It sucks, what happened to Matt.

282
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,381
That poor guy suffered so much
just for being gay.

283
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,549
He's not actually gay.

284
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,720
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.

285
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,605
Didn't you call him a theater fag
all the time in high school?

286
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,732
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.

287
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,192
Well, whatever.

288
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,736
Mercury's changed a lot
since then, though.

289
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,866
We're way less of a hick town.

290
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,359
Really?

291
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:43,280
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?

292
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,497
And we're getting
a new Chipotle at the mall.

293
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,962
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.

294
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,253
You know, one of those Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...

295
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,546
Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.

296
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,710
That's genius. KenTacoHut.

297
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,759
You sound like one
of your crazy characters.

298
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,882
Hey, so how's Allen?

299
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,596
Allen is great. Yeah.

300
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,764
Yeah, he's good.

301
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,018
We're not married anymore, but...

302
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,437
Oh, sorry. I didn't...

303
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,982
No, don't be sorry.
It's good. It's fine.

304
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,361
Well, that's Allen's loss.

305
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,198
It sucks to be Allen.

306
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,585
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.

307
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,165
She's got band practice tonight.

308
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,376
Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.

309
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,301
Just something she does
with the other moms.

310
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,053
Wow, cool.

311
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,466
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.

312
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,010
Oh, my God. Embarrassing.

313
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,148
Actually, her band's
playing here tomorrow night.

314
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,985
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow
night to our house for a hang?

315
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,654
We can have dinner, and then
come here and see Beth's show.

316
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,775
I would love that.
- Yeah.

317
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,570
Oh, this is kind of silly,

318
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:09,241
but would you mind signing one
of those Waverley Place books for me?

319
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,458
Sure.

320
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,376
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.

321
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,664
It's for my niece, Kendra.

322
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,672
She wants to be a writer someday.

323
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,711
Right, of course.

324
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,965
But you know, my name isn't
actually on the books.

325
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,182
I mean, it's on the title page
if you check inside.

326
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,887
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.

327
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,474
It's still a pretty big deal,
compared to the rest of us.

328
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,771
It was so great seeing you.

329
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:44,407
I always feel like we can
pick up right where we left off.

330
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,527
Exactly.

331
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:51,116
You know what? You look the same.

332
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,418
I do?

333
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,424
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed,
you just got lucky.

334
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,214
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.

335
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,382
OK.
- Good night.

336
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,265
Hello?

337
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,225
Look, I just want you to know

338
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:56,473
that what you think you saw tonight
is not what it was, OK?

339
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,441
Oh, so you're not trying
to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.

340
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:04,612
It is way more complicated than you
can possibly ever understand, OK?

341
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,574
Buddy Slade and I have
years and years of history,

342
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,529
and it is very rich, and very complex.

343
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:15,033
Wow, yeah, that sounds
way beyond my comprehension.

344
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,667
Don't open a new ranch
till the old one's done.

345
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,039
What?
- That's my sister. Forget it.

346
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,002
Just so you know.
- I got it. Thank you.

347
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,767
Do you want to get loaded, or something?

348
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,109
I'm Mavis.

349
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,820
I know. From high school.

350
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,872
Right.

351
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,417
I made you those Rice Krispies squares
that one time for your birthday.

352
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,586
I got your locker combination
from the vice principal.

353
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,706
I put them in your locker?

354
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,003
Thank you.

355
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,469
So where's Matt?
- In his cave.

356
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,892
Welcome to the distillery.

357
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,819
Are you making moonshine?

358
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,697
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.

359
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,817
You know what? Hang on.

360
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,737
All right. Check this out.

361
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,248
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.

362
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,703
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...

363
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,417
That's a limited... There's not a lot.

364
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,669
"Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.

365
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,713
Mos Eisley... Star Wars thing.

366
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,431
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...

367
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,511
Let's let that age a little longer.

368
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,889
And I got another in here.

369
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,057
OK.

370
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,521
Now, see if you can detect...

371
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,821
...some of the new oak.

372
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,984
Oh, come on.
- OK.

373
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,213
They're kind of hidden in there.

374
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,738
So when you sip...

375
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,622
I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.

376
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,416
Let's do a little...

377
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,669
There you go.

378
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,392
Woody.

379
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,777
Oak.

380
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,609
So how'd the rest
of your little date go?

381
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,944
Good. It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?

382
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,323
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.

383
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,742
OK, he actually said that?

384
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,577
He implied it.

385
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,517
You can tell, he's totally suffering.

386
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,297
He looks completely exhausted.

387
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,050
You know he told me
he feels like a zombie.

388
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,964
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.

389
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,140
That's a pretty strong
statement to make.

390
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,309
I mean, a zombie is
a dead person, not...

391
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,979
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.

392
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,583
I think Buddy and I are
having very similar feelings.

393
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,358
The question is,
who's gonna make the first move?

394
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,780
I'm thinking... it will be you.

395
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,709
Aren't you a little old for G. I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.

396
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,915
No, it's fine. Jesus.

397
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:39,798
You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.

398
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,767
That one... I took Copperhead's face,
and I put it on Mongul's body,

399
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,853
so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead,

400
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,021
and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.

401
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,857
I was tired and drunk.

402
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,109
You ever make, like, girl dolls?

403
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,229
I'm not a weirdo.

404
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,489
I have to go check on something.

405
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,949
Oh, OK.

406
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,154
No, no, no. You need to come with me.

407
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I think this is it.

408
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,296
You think, or you know?

409
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,716
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.

410
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:27,137
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.

411
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,143
You're fuckin' mentally ill.

412
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,524
You see that window up there?
- Yep.

413
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,153
I bet Buddy is awake...

414
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,239
...jerking off or something.

415
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,489
Or perhaps he's caring
for his infant daughter.

416
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,329
The baby, the baby.

417
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,081
The problem that has no name.

418
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,454
Can I help you find something?

419
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,623
Sure, I'm not having
a ton of luck here.

420
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,584
Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.

421
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,086
It's not a formal occasion.

422
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,959
I'm looking for something chic, clean,
but also a bit edgy.

423
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,302
OK. We have some adorable
new dresses that just came in.

424
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:48,051
Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.

425
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,645
I'm going to a rock concert
with an old flame,

426
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,439
and I think there is a chance
we may reconnect.

427
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,105
Let's show him what he's been missing.

428
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,974
No, he's seen me recently. He knows.

429
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,110
But his wife hasn't
seen me in a while, so...

430
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,447
Well, it's the end of my shift,

431
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,789
and my son has to be
picked up from school.

432
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,333
So I'm just gonna send over
another associate.

433
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,335
She's up on all the trends.

434
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,455
Shawna!

435
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,512
Where are the Waverley Prep books?

436
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,580
They got their own
display table right there.

437
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,970
Wow.

438
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,187
They must be really popular.

439
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,940
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus
stock we're trying to clear out.

440
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,942
They were big a couple years ago,

441
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,010
but the computer says,
"Do not shelve," so...

442
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,777
Hey, are you writing in there?

443
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,488
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.

444
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,615
You're Jane MacMurray?

445
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:58,127
No. Jane MacMurray just created
the series. I wrote the book.

446
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,790
Mavis Gary-Crane. See?

447
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,428
Do you know Jane MacMurray?

448
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,013
Yes, I know her really well.

449
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,176
I wrote the book.
- OK.

450
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,358
Do you want a signed copy
for your store?

451
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,313
No, that's fine.

452
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,733
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.

453
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:25,945
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed,
we can't send it back to the publisher.

454
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,116
Why would you be sending it
back to the publisher?

455
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,535
We're probably not gonna sell them.

456
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,655
The series is done.

457
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,422
Come on, I told you
you can't write in the...

458
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,835
Whatever, book man.

459
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,434
Kendal Strickland never
felt threatened.

460
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,313
If anything, she felt a deep sense
of pity for this rebound girl.

461
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,983
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.

462
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,820
That said, she couldn't help
her own popularity.

463
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,157
It wasn't her fault that one year
she was nominated homecoming queen...

464
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,421
...of a neighboring high school.

465
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:16,533
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.

466
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,666
Other girls were so insecure,

467
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,002
stressing about their faces
and their figures, not Kendal.

468
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:26,501
Hers was a gracious, effortless
beauty that glowed from within.

469
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,630
However, being that beautiful
could also be intimidating.

470
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,889
Some guys went for girls
who were more ordinary.

471
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:38,436
How could Kendal make sure her own
perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan...

472
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,556
...the love of her life?

473
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,739
What up?
- Hey.

474
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,457
How are you?

475
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,704
How are you?
- Good, good.

476
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,999
Here's that book for your niece.

477
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,794
Oh, yeah. Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.

478
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,720
There is a character
in that one that's based on you.

479
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,388
What?
- In the book.

480
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,992
I mean, I named him Ashby,
but it's so blatantly you.

481
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,145
When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.

482
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,605
We're not even supposed to do that.

483
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,565
We're supposed to stick
to this character bible...

484
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,685
Hey.

485
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,736
Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.

486
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,856
You, too.

487
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,904
There it is.

488
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,954
Adorable.

489
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,074
Thank you.

490
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,748
You love it. You love it.

491
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,424
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?

492
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,301
Oh, just a water.

493
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,168
Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.

494
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,098
It's fine. I'll just pump
and dump after the show.

495
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,568
Don't worry. I'm not trying
to get my kid hammered.

496
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,682
Wow, look at that.

497
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,853
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium. Always chills her out.

498
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,522
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,983
Yes, yes it does.

500
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,319
Oh, starting to get smiles.

501
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,911
Cute.

502
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,074
She's, like, Buddy's clone.

503
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,787
No. I see you in there.

504
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,790
Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.

505
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,957
Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.

506
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,544
Thank you.
- Here you go.

507
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,459
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.

508
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,514
I saw a nice article
about you in the Sun.

509
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,678
Yes, I'm an author
of a young adult series.

510
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,846
It's disturbingly popular.

511
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,602
I like your decor.

512
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,313
Is it shabby chic?

513
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,114
Pier One?

514
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,234
A little bit Goodwill.

515
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,535
Buddy and I used to go thrifting
all the time.

516
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,448
Remember that? The '90s?

517
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,418
Oh, my God, Beth. We had this huge
silly T-shirt collection.

518
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,170
It was just, like,
the dumbest thing ever.

519
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,290
The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.

520
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,899
I used to sleep in his T-shirts
and boxers.

521
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,215
I think I still have a few.

522
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,852
Hey. I still have one of
my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.

523
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,521
I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?

524
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,351
Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.

525
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,521
What's the chart?

526
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,652
Beth teaches special needs kids.

527
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,162
A lot of my kids
learn emotions cognitively.

528
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,581
It doesn't come naturally to them
the way it does for you and me.

529
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,459
So we need to show them
"this is what happy looks like,"

530
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,128
"this is what anxious looks like,"
and so on.

531
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,248
What about neutral?

532
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,753
I mean, like,
what if you don't feel anything?

533
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,006
That's kind of how they are
a lot of the time.

534
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,634
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.

535
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,648
Oh, my God.

536
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,936
Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.

537
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,363
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.

538
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,989
Shots.

539
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,694
Psychotic prom queen bitch.

540
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,862
Really?

541
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,989
Come on, tequila time.

542
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,241
Salt.

543
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,501
So... are they any good?

544
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,668
Yeah, they're all right.

545
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,673
I knew it.
They're horrible. I knew it.

546
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,009
Well, they have a lot of fun.

547
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,387
Hey, look. Freehauf's over there.

548
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:53,524
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy. Look at his face.

549
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,730
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.

550
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,941
Think he owns any clown suits?

551
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,945
Oh, my God. You're terrible.
- Come on.

552
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,988
Dark.
- No.

553
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,076
Hello, Mercury!

554
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,087
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.

555
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,250
We are Nipple Confusion.

556
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,049
Yeah.

557
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:23,381
Please be kind,
as this is only our second show.

558
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,162
And we all have small children at home.

559
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,177
Our first song is a cover.

560
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,979
This one goes out
from our drummer, Beth,

561
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,809
to her sweetheart, Buddy.

562
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,232
She wears denim wherever she goes

563
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,236
Says she's gonna get some records
by the Status Quo

564
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:51,075
Oh, yeah

565
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:57,456
Still she won't be forced
against her will

566
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:01,127
Says she don't do drugs,
but she does the pill

567
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:06,674
Oh, yeah

568
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,514
I didn't want to hurt you

569
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,434
Oh, yeah

570
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,063
I didn't want to hurt you

571
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,108
Oh, yeah

572
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,164
Says she likes my hair
'cause it's down my back

573
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,876
Says she likes the group
'cause we pull in the slack

574
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:47,590
Oh, yeah

575
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,096
When she's at the gig
she takes her car...

576
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,346
Remember when we used
to make out to this song?

577
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,942
Yeah.

578
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:04,685
Yeah, I think this song was playing
the first time I went down on you.

579
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,071
The first time I went...

580
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,298
I screwed up the fill so bad.

581
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,341
Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.

582
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,302
You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?

583
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,928
That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.

584
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,682
You guys were namazing.
- Wait. Did you just say "namazing"?

585
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,268
I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.

586
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,388
Hardly.

587
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:23,068
It's so interesting to see you
hanging around again, Mavis.

588
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,188
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.

589
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,781
It's so inspiring to see a single mother
with so much confidence on stage.

590
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,408
Really.

591
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,826
Beth, we gotta get home.

592
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,870
We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.

593
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,622
I wanna stay out
just a little while longer.

594
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,749
Yeah, Buddy,
you can't have her back tonight.

595
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,292
Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.

596
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,412
Really?

597
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,797
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.

598
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,917
You sure?

599
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,964
Have fun.

600
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,051
Thanks, Mavis.

601
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,242
Easy.

602
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,377
Tolerance has gone down
since you knew me.

603
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,842
What do you mean, since I knew you?

604
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,417
I still know you. Come here.
- Yeah.

605
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,003
Wait.
- What?

606
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,086
Don't you have that babysitter
till 11:00?

607
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,878
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.

608
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,430
I know, we can't, but...

609
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,725
...time is just so precious.

610
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,187
For real.

611
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,608
It goes so fast.
- I know.

612
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,488
Man, I really love my daughter,
you know?

613
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,656
I know, I know.

614
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,952
I can tell you're a great father.

615
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,541
You're already going above and beyond
in so many ways.

616
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,503
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.

617
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,631
You do too much, even.

618
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,681
You think so?

619
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,801
Yes.

620
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,098
You're a good, good man, Buddy.

621
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,580
Don't ever shortchange yourself.

622
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,614
I thought I saw lights.

623
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,832
Hi, Daniel. Yep, I'm home.

624
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,250
Where's Beth?

625
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,045
She wanted to stay out
and party all night.

626
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,758
Well, we're all out of breast milk,
and she doesn't want her "nuk" anymore.

627
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,878
I got it.

628
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,512
Good night, Buddy.

629
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,632
Good night.

630
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,927
Thank you. Yeah.

631
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,599
Wow.

632
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,401
Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.

633
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,655
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.

634
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,532
Why don't you walk, fat ass?

635
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,493
There's some low-hanging fruit.

636
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,613
You are low-hanging fruit.

637
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,493
Oh, no. No.
- What?

638
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,661
I hate this guy over here.

639
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,501
That's my cousin, Mike.

640
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,879
Mike Moran is your cousin?

641
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,012
Unfortunately.

642
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,348
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple
in Minnesota.

643
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,934
Mavis?
- Mike.

644
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,769
What is up, girly-friend?

645
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,271
Holy shit, coz,
this is such a rad surprise.

646
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,650
Yeah, I'm in town
just for a little real estate thing.

647
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,610
How are you? Yeah.
- I'm great.

648
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,946
Kim and I just had
our six-year anniversary.

649
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,657
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood? Porcelain?

650
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,457
Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.

651
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,453
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.

652
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,997
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.

653
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,127
You mean rock crawling, right?

654
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,001
No, I'm vertical, bro,
believe it or not.

655
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,581
We can do anything a normal can do.

656
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,590
Probably more, because we've had
to reboot for extra positivity.

657
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,385
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.

658
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,215
You should try it, Matt.
- No.

659
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,465
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."

660
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,853
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.

661
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,973
It's like Will & Grace.

662
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,935
It is.
- No, it isn't.

663
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,443
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys,
but we should chat later.

664
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,612
I'll buy you a scotch
or whatever you got there.

665
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,546
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?

666
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,326
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?

667
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,823
Junior. Car wreck.

668
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,867
God, he got so much attention.

669
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:54,373
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.

670
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,127
Please. That dick ruined my sweet 16,
same weekend.

671
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,295
God, you are a piece of work.

672
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,172
You're a piece of shit.

673
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:29,372
You know there's stuff all over
the Internet about how you're a cougar.

674
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,870
How I'm a cougar?
I'm not even 30 years old.

675
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,669
You're a cougar.

676
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,375
I am turning 30 this year
and I am freaked out.

677
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,711
It's pretty old.

678
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,631
Kim Kardashian channels
her own inner cougar.

679
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,614
Fuck.

680
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:07,863
The kiss was electric,
transformative, spiritual, enchanted.

681
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,241
It was like their first kiss
all over again,

682
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,625
except now they knew exactly
what they were doing.

683
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,961
I said, "Listen, Kyle,
you're everything to me.

684
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:20,298
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"

685
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:23,301
And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.

686
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,421
I'm gonna have a...

687
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,353
Hey, you.

688
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,308
Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.

689
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,233
Last night was amazing.

690
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,735
How much longer
are you gonna be in town?

691
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,607
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?

692
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,865
I was just wondering if you're still
in town this weekend,

693
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,159
if you wanna come to the baby's
naming ceremony.

694
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,413
It's this little hippy thing
we're doing out in the yard.

695
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,164
It's not religious or anything...

696
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,897
I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.

697
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,382
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.

698
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,375
Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.

699
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,442
Hey, Mom.

700
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,913
Were you even gonna say hello?

701
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,539
It's been so long,
I almost forgot what you look like.

702
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:38,954
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom. OK?
I was planning on calling.

703
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,380
Why didn't you just come
and stay with us?

704
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,711
Because I needed a quiet place to write.

705
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,722
You have no idea. I have tons
and tons of work to catch up on.

706
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,390
Books still selling well?

707
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,554
It's like I can hardly keep up.

708
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:59,541
Is that the money you used
to invest in local real estate?

709
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:06,392
I heard you were here to work on some
kind of real estate transaction.

710
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:10,669
I was just surprised you didn't
use Aunt Lena as your broker.

711
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,739
She's a little hurt.

712
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,918
Honey?

713
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,038
Look what I found.
- What?

714
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,167
Welcome home.
- Thanks.

715
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,300
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?

716
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,420
Oh, I don't know about that.

717
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,720
Who's this?

718
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,305
This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.

719
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,425
Dolce.
- Hello.

720
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,300
I hope you're eating
enough in the city.

721
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,552
You gotta start taking care
of yourself, sweetie.

722
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,218
You know, a Lean Cuisine
is not a meal.

723
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,279
Yeah, I think I might
be an alcoholic.

724
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,469
Very funny.

725
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,650
You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.

726
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,486
It's just that
your hair is so beautiful.

727
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,697
You know what, Mom? Can you please
take down that photo of me and Allen?

728
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,449
Which picture, sweetie?

729
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,571
The wedding photo. We are divorced.

730
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,705
We just thought it was a nice memory.

731
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,035
Of my failed marriage?

732
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,584
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.

733
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,628
Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.

734
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,422
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.

735
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:33,176
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.

736
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,637
Have you seen any old friends
on this visit?

737
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,757
Actually...

738
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,141
...I've been seeing
quite a bit of Buddy.

739
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,261
Oh, the old beau, huh?

740
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,772
I remember you kids
were so cute in high school.

741
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,442
It's funny how those initial instincts
can be so right, you know?

742
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,694
I mean, you make all these mistakes
along the way,

743
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,698
but the world will make sure you end up
with the person you're meant to be with.

744
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,451
It's good to keep
those people in your life.

745
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,983
The people who really know you best.

746
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,870
And that new baby
of his is just darling.

747
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:11,458
Have you seen it? Up close?

748
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,626
I suppose.

749
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,545
Is everything OK?

750
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,093
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.

751
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:28,350
It's just that Buddy used to say that...

752
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,896
...we would make
the cutest little babies, ever.

753
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:39,403
Hey, did you guys
ever sell my Cabriolet?

754
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,334
Yeah! Sweet ride.

755
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,175
What is that, a drop-top?

756
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,011
I just saw my mother and father.

757
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,841
Oh, heavy. How are they?

758
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:04,428
Horrible. God, I've been through a lot.

759
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,764
Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?

760
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,564
Come on. Let's hit the woods
in the back of the school.

761
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,691
And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...

762
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,479
Come on!
- Fine.

763
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,859
Could you walk any slower?

764
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,237
Our school is so ugly.

765
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,866
It looks like a factory.

766
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:30,455
It actually used to be a rubber
fabrication plant back in the '20s.

767
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,330
You know everything.

768
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:40,297
These woods were like Hump City
back in the day.

769
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,848
I remember being back here
with a few different guys.

770
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,246
I never knew you were such a slut.

771
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,513
I was normal.

772
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:56,313
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?

773
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,024
How's the master plan unfolding?

774
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,095
Well, actually, he called me today

775
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:07,491
and asked me if I wanted to participate
in his baby's naming ceremony.

776
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,375
I don't know.

777
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,705
There's still so much
that's unspoken, but...

778
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,422
...he's involving me
in his child's life.

779
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,585
Buddy is a married man.

780
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,343
By all accounts, happily.

781
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,465
Yeah, happily married men
go to bars alone

782
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,932
with their ex-girlfriends
all the time.

783
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,102
They call them privately, and they
make out with them on porches.

784
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,021
He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.

785
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,019
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.

786
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,528
He gave me his sweatshirt.

787
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:42,108
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.

788
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,987
And FYI, you look completely
insane wearing it.

789
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,955
Look, I don't know
what Buddy's doing with you,

790
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:53,245
or what you think he's doing with you,
but you need to move on.

791
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,956
You're one to talk.

792
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:58,589
All you care about is some scuffle
that happened 20 years ago.

793
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:01,467
You lean on that crutch,
and you lean on excuses,

794
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,928
and you and I both know
you use this whole thing

795
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:07,532
as an excuse to do absolutely
nothing with your life.

796
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,637
"Scuffle."

797
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,815
You don't know shit
about what happened to me.

798
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:19,437
OK? Those jocks you used
to blow during lunch...

799
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,358
...they shattered my legs,

800
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,236
bashed in my brains,

801
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,202
mangled my cock,

802
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:33,076
so that I have to piss and cum sideways
for the rest of my life.

803
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,662
Then they left me for dead.

804
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,656
You know, things aren't
too great down south.

805
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:47,048
I can barely get off by myself,
let alone with another person.

806
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,978
You know, what's done is done.

807
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,945
You can't keep dwelling
on the past, Matt.

808
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,989
Are you fucking kidding?

809
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,908
Talk about dwelling in the past.

810
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:10,947
Here you are back in Mercury,
like a loser,

811
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,456
trying to score
with a happily married man.

812
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,501
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.

813
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:20,290
You're hardly the authority
on happiness, Sylvia.

814
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,258
You know what, Matt?

815
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,302
It really is a shame
that you're like this,

816
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,262
because if you had
a good personality,

817
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,473
none of this other stuff
would bother people.

818
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,934
Why don't you use my crutch
again as a metaphor?

819
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,805
That was brilliant. That was masterful.

820
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:40,185
Or no, save it for your
little teenage stories,

821
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:44,239
because God knows you don't
know shit about being an adult!

822
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,497
It wasn't the first time
Kendal Strickland was let down.

823
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:59,168
For all the good they did, beauty and
popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.

824
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,421
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?

825
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:07,218
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march
of being special a little too well.

826
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,595
She was used to blazing her own trail.

827
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:13,677
It was obvious that Ryan
still loved her, crystal clear.

828
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:16,477
And perhaps that was unfair
to his new girlfriend,

829
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:20,398
but Kendal Strickland was going
to think about herself for a change.

830
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,686
Who was taking care of Kendal?

831
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,152
And on the subject of fair...

832
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,738
Was it fair that people misjudged
Kendal's intelligence

833
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,782
just because she was so beautiful?

834
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:33,995
Was it fair everyone thought her life
was so easy, when it was anything but?

835
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,872
No. Life wasn't fair,

836
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,542
and it was up to Kendal to step in
and make things right.

837
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:43,623
Sometimes in order to heal,
a few people have to get hurt.

838
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,479
Hi, Jan.

839
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,599
Oh, hi.

840
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,647
Wow, really been a long time.

841
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,947
I know. I've been a really busy girl.

842
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,782
Yeah, I've heard that.

843
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,362
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.

844
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:41,888
Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.

845
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:45,036
Hi!
- Hey, how are you?

846
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,204
Wow. How are you doing?

847
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,714
I'm good.

848
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,465
Good.
- I brought presents.

849
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,050
Oh, thank you.

850
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:56,548
Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.

851
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,139
Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?

852
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,099
Can you help Beth
with that endive thing?

853
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,601
Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?

854
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,520
Yeah.

855
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,441
Are you having fun? Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.

856
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,609
I think we should talk privately.

857
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,814
Sure, yeah.

858
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,982
Here, follow me.

859
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,244
OK.

860
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:33,042
OK, so what's going on?

861
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,761
There are so many things
I know we both wanna say.

862
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,966
OK, well, we don't
have to say them all now.

863
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:43,551
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.

864
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:47,035
You're so thoughtful,
even during all this.

865
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,392
Well, hey, she pushed it out.

866
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:54,612
I just want you to know that I'm feeling
everything that you're feeling.

867
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:58,783
Buddy, these last few days have been
some of the best in my life.

868
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,903
They have?

869
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,906
You don't have to pretend.

870
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,743
I know what's in here...

871
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,914
...and I know what's in here.

872
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:17,879
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.

873
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,220
You're my whole galaxy.

874
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,467
Mavis!
What are you doing?

875
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,601
OK.

876
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,857
You don't have to be afraid. It's OK.

877
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:41,033
You can come to the city with me,
like we always planned.

878
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:43,410
What the hell are you talking about?

879
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,705
We can work this out. You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.

880
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:50,912
Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know. We can beat this together.

881
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,752
You're better than this.

882
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,883
I have to go.

883
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,470
I think you should leave.

884
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,236
Hey, look who's up.

885
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,321
Hey, let me take her.

886
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,442
Let me... Come here.

887
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:25,446
There you are.

888
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,456
Can you do me a favor?

889
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,041
We need everybody outside.

890
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:34,706
I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.

891
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,166
Those are delicious.

892
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,390
Hey, listen up, everyone!

893
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,441
I think Buddy has
a little surprise for Beth,

894
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,195
so if you could all just come outside
and gather around the garage.

895
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,316
Come on, let's go.

896
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:18,255
Mavis?

897
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,798
What?
- Are you OK?

898
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:23,268
I'll be fine if I can
get a real drink around here.

899
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,846
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.

900
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,056
You know what?

901
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,176
Oh, my God.

902
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:35,224
I'll get some...
- Fuck you.

903
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:37,392
Fuck you!

904
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,187
You fucking bitch.

905
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,027
Oh, my God.

906
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,279
You should see your face.

907
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,907
It's a joke.

908
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:54,750
Are you just gonna stand there
like a big lump?

909
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,870
I love your sweater.

910
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,296
I'll get you a rag.

911
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,757
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got
so many of those lying around here.

912
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,087
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.

913
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:05,719
You know, the funny thing is,

914
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:08,222
I could have had this party
a long time ago.

915
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,968
This exact same party. Yeah.

916
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:13,060
Buddy and I were
together for four years,

917
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,687
and we were inseparable. Jan knows.

918
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,438
Right, Jan? Tell them!

919
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,315
You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.

920
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:20,645
It is silk. It's fucked.

921
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:21,902
Mavis, sweetheart.

922
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:24,702
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.

923
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,409
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.

924
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,529
And we were gonna keep it!

925
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,831
We were gonna have a little baby,

926
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,833
and a little naming party,

927
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:39,414
and a Funquarium, and all of that.

928
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,666
And then 12 weeks into it...

929
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,962
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.

930
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,715
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.

931
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:55,478
Maybe if things were just
a little bit more hospitable

932
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:58,141
down south in my broken body,

933
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:00,607
Buddy and I would be here
right now with a teenager,

934
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:02,568
and probably even more kids,

935
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,820
because we always
found each other. Always!

936
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,940
Right, Jan? Tell them!

937
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:10,735
What the fuck?

938
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,293
It's a new drum set for Beth.

939
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:29,053
What's wrong?

940
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,555
Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

941
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:33,557
My God! What is wrong with you?

942
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,184
Are you like one of those little kids

943
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,436
who need a fucking chart
to learn feelings?

944
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,064
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?

945
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,732
That's enough, Mavis. You're drunk.

946
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:43,275
Oh, I've been drunk
since I've been back, Mom,

947
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:46,070
and nobody gave two shits until
this one got all bent out of shape.

948
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:50,009
Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?

949
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:55,281
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.

950
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:00,834
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.

951
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:03,539
We all do, Mavis.

952
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:06,673
It's obvious you're having
some mental sickness,

953
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:07,883
some depression.

954
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:10,052
You're very lonely and confused.

955
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,728
So Beth made me invite you here,
even though I knew it was a mistake.

956
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,968
I knew it.

957
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,557
You're lying.

958
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,477
He's not.

959
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:39,617
Well. What about now?

960
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:43,161
You hate me now?

961
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,916
'Cause it should be easy,
'cause I fucking hate you.

962
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:56,425
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?

963
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,308
Mavis, honey.

964
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:03,683
You know, I came back for you.
For you!

965
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,483
And I hate this town!

966
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,981
It's a hick, lake town
that smells of fish shit!

967
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:12,148
But I came back.

968
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,530
I just wanted you to know that.

969
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:34,129
I screwed up.

970
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:38,988
I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?

971
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,268
You're scaring me.

972
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,276
I'm crazy.

973
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,406
And no one loves me.

974
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,409
You don't love me.

975
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:07,002
Guys like me...

976
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:09,400
...are born loving women like you.

977
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:15,421
I went to Buddy's house.

978
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:18,423
What happened?

979
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,767
I ruined my dress.

980
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,703
I'll get you...

981
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,949
I'll get you a shirt.

982
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,453
No, I want yours.

983
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,041
You want the shirt I'm wearing?

984
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,242
Hide me.

985
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:51,058
It's OK.

986
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,908
Why Buddy?

987
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:56,624
He's a good man. He's kind.

988
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,213
Are other men unkind?

989
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:08,636
He knew me when I was at my best.

990
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,331
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.

991
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,065
Not then.

992
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,735
You know, I saw you every day.

993
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:31,992
You had this little mirror
in your locker,

994
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,578
shaped like a heart...

995
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,786
...and you looked in that mirror
more than you ever looked at me,

996
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:43,504
and I was at my best.

997
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:55,491
Good morning.

998
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:58,369
Hi.

999
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,706
Coffee?

1000
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,958
Sure.

1001
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:16,812
Do you still write those books?

1002
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,814
No.

1003
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,413
The series is over. It got cancelled.

1004
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:26,236
I'm actually writing
the last one right now.

1005
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,317
What happens?

1006
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,820
I don't know.

1007
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,371
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?

1008
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:42,950
She married Buddy Slade from school.

1009
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,209
Yeah. I know that Beth.

1010
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,298
What do you think of her?

1011
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:57,596
I... I...

1012
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,764
I don't really like her.

1013
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:04,209
I mean, I think that
you're way prettier than she is.

1014
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,316
What happened to your dress?

1015
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,867
I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?

1016
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:20,458
Shit.

1017
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,579
What's wrong? What did I say?

1018
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,585
I have a lot of problems.

1019
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:32,506
Can't you get a new dress?

1020
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,488
It's really difficult
for me to be happy...

1021
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:43,726
...and then for other people,

1022
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:45,893
it just seems so simple.

1023
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,653
I know.

1024
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:55,154
They just grow up,
and they're so... fulfilled.

1025
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,829
I don't feel fulfilled.

1026
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:00,034
Well...
- And frankly,

1027
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:04,355
if you don't feel fulfilled
with all the stuff that you have...

1028
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:14,797
I need to change, Sandra.

1029
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,970
No, you don't.
- What?

1030
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:23,730
You're the only person
in Mercury who could write a book,

1031
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,268
or wear a dress like that.

1032
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:29,277
I'm sure there's plenty
of other people who could...

1033
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,732
Everyone here is fat and dumb.

1034
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,900
Don't say that.

1035
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,362
I mean, you think so?

1036
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,080
Everyone wishes that
they could be like you.

1037
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,120
You know, living in the big city,

1038
01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:48,373
all famous and beautiful
and all that.

1039
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:50,757
I'm not really famous.

1040
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,629
Well, you know, special or whatever.

1041
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,262
I mean, some days, when I have
a slow shift at work,

1042
01:24:56,382 --> 01:24:58,382
I'll sit and think about you,

1043
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,860
living in your cool apartment,
going out and stuff.

1044
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,145
It seems really nice.

1045
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,851
Yeah. But...

1046
01:25:09,854 --> 01:25:12,981
Most people here seem
so happy with so little.

1047
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:17,820
It's like they don't even seem to care
what happens to them.

1048
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:22,289
That's because it doesn't
matter what happens to them.

1049
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,701
They're nothing.

1050
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,788
Might as well die.

1051
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,295
Fuck Mercury.

1052
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,557
Thank you.

1053
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:54,730
I needed that.

1054
01:25:57,777 --> 01:25:59,777
You're right.

1055
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:02,905
This place blows.

1056
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:08,897
I need to get back to Minneapolis.

1057
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:12,915
Take me with you.

1058
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,543
Excuse me?

1059
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,969
Take me with you.

1060
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:20,299
You know, to the Mini Apple.

1061
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:25,137
You're good here, Sandra.

1062
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,014
Oh.

1063
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,696
Dolce.

1064
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,741
I'm so sorry.

1065
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,744
My baby. Come here.

1066
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:54,583
Graduation turned out to be
a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.

1067
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:57,509
While honored to be
the valedictorian of her class,

1068
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,761
there was an unmistakable
air of sadness

1069
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,424
over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.

1070
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,935
Who could have imagined when Ryan
and his girlfriend set sail that day,

1071
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:10,137
it would be the last time
anyone ever saw them?

1072
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,274
Good boy.

1073
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,110
Poor Ryan...

1074
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,230
Lost at sea.

1075
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:22,985
They don't need those back.

1076
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:27,061
You can put them in a scrapbook,
or whatever.

1077
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:33,873
Just so you know, those doughnuts
are for Honors Members only.

1078
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:06,035
Kendal felt the weight of her high
school years lifting off of her

1079
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:08,573
as she emptied out her locker.

1080
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:12,244
Sure, she'd think about Waverley
from time to time.

1081
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:15,497
Cheer squad, the debate team,

1082
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:18,814
sneaking into the woods
for a drink after class.

1083
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,441
But her best years
were still ahead of her.

1084
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:28,130
Kendal Strickland was
ready for the world.

1085
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:31,081
It was time to look to the future.

1086
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:33,639
A new chapter.

1087
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:36,774
As she boarded the train for Cambridge,

1088
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:40,981
she took one last look
at her small town and blew it a kiss...

1089
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:46,528
...thinking, "Life, here I come."
