1
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:37,096
Cease fire! Cease fire! Heads up!

2
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:39,516
Man down! Cease fire!

3
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,898
Stupid motherfucker!

4
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:07,687
<i>Sí.</i>

5
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,589
What's up, Sylvia?

6
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,513
Cute little outfit.

7
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:48,097
You look nice.

8
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:49,098
Mike's in the bedroom.

9
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:50,183
Yeah?

10
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:57,190
Man, I said you look nice.

11
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,943
I have a court appearance, Jim.

12
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:02,111
Well, you just give 'em hell.

13
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:05,614
Hey.

14
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:10,537
Spiffy duds, huh?

15
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:13,873
You look like a gift-Wrapped turd.

16
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:15,708
Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

17
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,544
I have two filings
and a deposition today.

18
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:19,212
Play nice, kids.

19
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:22,215
What up, dog?

20
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:24,300
Nothing. Just got back. Cool. Cool.

21
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,802
How was Mexico, dog?

22
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:28,221
Oh, it was a dream, man.

23
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,307
Loving my woman. Right.

24
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,059
That's it. I'm out of here.

25
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,895
Those are copies of your resumé.

26
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:36,980
Pass them out like candy.

27
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,398
'Cause I can always print up more.

28
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:40,233
And just call me if
anything happens, okay?

29
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:43,069
And no drinking.

30
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:45,572
Come on, baby, be cool.

31
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:46,823
Honey, I'm serious.

32
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:48,992
No drinking. Okay?

33
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:51,327
I love you. I love you, too.

34
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:55,498
Good luck.

35
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,751
Your suit's fine, okay?

36
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:06,426
Dude, she called me
a gift-Wrapped turd.

37
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,012
Don't be fucking with her, dude.

38
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:10,847
She's pissed.

39
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:12,348
Why is she on the warpath? Dog...

40
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,435
I didn't look for work yesterday, dude.

41
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:18,271
Sold some of her CDs,
bought a couple of 40s

42
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:20,106
And a pack of GPCs.

43
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,274
Caught a buzz and watched

44
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,276
My Chicago Vs. Lakers tapes.

45
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:25,528
That's on you, homie.

46
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,780
We didn't even hang yesterday.

47
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,282
I was out of the country.

48
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:31,284
So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

49
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:32,535
Huh? Huh? Hmm?

50
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:34,537
Come on, dude, let's
get the fuck out of here

51
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:35,788
And find my ass some employment.

52
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,207
It's cool you driving me around?

53
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,791
Yeah, dude, it's cool. It's no trouble.

54
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:43,630
<i>Here, asshole.</i>

55
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,964
Breakfast.

56
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:46,800
Oh... ho, ho...

57
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Dog.

58
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:50,637
<i>No pisto for me, dude.</i>

59
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:52,806
Today's a no-Pounding
day. You heard the woman.

60
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:54,641
Good. More for me.

61
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,145
Fuck it.

62
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,981
<i>Salud. Salud.</i>

63
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,153
Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

64
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:08,988
I can't pay my rent.

65
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:11,991
Landlady's about to
pull a gauge on my ass.

66
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:14,494
What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

67
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:17,413
The tax-Free shit?

68
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:20,250
Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

69
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,001
I guess we drank up the rest.

70
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:23,670
Dumb ass.

71
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:26,840
Cops better start paying you, dude.

72
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,341
You spend enough fucking time with them.

73
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:30,760
They better start kicking
me down some paychecks, man.

74
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,929
They got me hopping
through hoops, you know?

75
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:35,265
"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

76
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:37,100
Another test, another two weeks.

77
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,601
Fuck.

78
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:39,686
Shit gets real,

79
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,020
You be hating life.

80
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,022
Party time will be over.

81
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:45,775
Dude, you don't know how much

82
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,861
I'm looking forward to this shit.

83
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:50,196
You know, I'll be super recruit.

84
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:52,073
I was jumping out of choppers

85
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,366
In the mountains, taking down

86
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:56,369
Hard motherfuckers, you know?

87
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:59,122
I'll be laughing my way
through LAPD's reindeer games.

88
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:01,875
Shit, they're gonna love me.

89
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,210
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

90
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,296
Ah, fuck you.

91
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:08,715
I'm going to love my old lady.

92
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:10,550
I'm gonna marry homegirl.

93
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:13,219
Import her ass.

94
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:14,721
Oh, come on, man.

95
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:16,222
Dude, what happened to all the honeys

96
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:18,016
We were gonna pimp with your badge, dog?

97
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,058
You're fucking up the plan.

98
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:21,478
I've been thinking, you know?

99
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:23,730
Love's about sacrifice.

100
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,774
Only true measure of it.

101
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:28,318
What would you do for Sylvia?

102
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,988
Get a job.

103
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,907
Mm... Nine to fucking five.

104
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:35,742
Yeah.

105
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:37,243
That's love.

106
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,173
Hey.

107
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:58,181
Good morning.

108
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:02,602
So when do you officially

109
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:04,354
Hand your ass over to the Man?

110
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:08,274
"Mr. Jim Davis, we regret to inform...

111
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:12,695
I had two beers, right?

112
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,113
Yeah.

113
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:15,448
Going fucking blind or something.

114
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:17,450
Okay, this letter says, quoting...

115
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,789
"No longer eligible as a
police officer candidate."

116
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:25,333
What the fuck does that mean?

117
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,377
Come on, dude.

118
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:30,046
"No longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

119
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:31,297
They pulled the plug, dude.

120
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:34,377
No, no...

121
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:36,928
Why?

122
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:40,306
Oh, man, I'll bet you...

123
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:42,392
I'll bet you it's because I'm white.

124
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:44,561
I bet it's because you're a dick.

125
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:46,312
No, no, no, Mike, you don't understand.

126
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:48,148
I am fucked.

127
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:50,150
I got to get married.

128
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,154
Okay? INS won't let
me bring Marta across

129
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:55,572
Unless I got employment.

130
00:11:55,572 --> 00:11:56,656
I promised her.

131
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:58,491
This fucks up my plan.

132
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:00,827
This is fucking bullshit, okay?

133
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:03,329
This... these fucking assholes...

134
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,666
These fucking assholes!

135
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,334
What the fuck is their problem, man?!

136
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:13,423
This is fucking typical
cop hate game bullshit!

137
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:15,341
Yo, yo, fucking chill, Magilla Gorilla.

138
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:16,759
I mean you're trippin', dude.

139
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,844
Hey, what the fuck

140
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,095
Are you looking at, asshole?!

141
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,848
Fucking dick.

142
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:22,849
Yo, yo,

143
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:24,934
Jim, Jim...

144
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:27,353
I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

145
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:29,856
You fucking want some?

146
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:33,109
Jim, Jim, dude.

147
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,360
Kick back, dude.

148
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,030
The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

149
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,364
Man, fuck. You're going to catch

150
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:39,532
A case doing that shit, man.

151
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:40,783
What the fuck were you doing?

152
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,619
Fuck the LAPD, man.

153
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:44,621
What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

154
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,539
Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

155
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,541
L.A. City's the shit.

156
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,210
Hey, Sheriff's Department.

157
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,879
It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

158
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,133
Yeah, Sheriff's Department, yeah.

159
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:00,386
They make you work the
jails the first two years

160
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:01,471
Or something.

161
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:02,889
I could be cracking heads

162
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,724
Up at the Honor Ranch.

163
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:08,061
I'll give 'em a call, start testing.

164
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,230
Yeah.

165
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,648
That's right.

166
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:15,167
Yo, it's just a minor setback, right?

167
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,986
Quit tripping, dude.

168
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:19,155
Shit.

169
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:22,325
Hey, you know what I want to do?

170
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:23,910
What?

171
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,913
I want to get fucked up.

172
00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:28,581
Me, too, man.

173
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:31,417
I got to find a job and
placate my baby, you know.

174
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,253
Sylvia's going to kick your ass?

175
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:34,921
Come on, big man, she'll be cool.

176
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:35,881
Come on.

177
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:48,768
Bye, Nicole. Bye.

178
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:56,276
Let me get a couple of
singles, too, please.

179
00:13:56,276 --> 00:13:58,278
Sorry, you buy whole pack.

180
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,196
Be cool, dude.

181
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:01,447
If I buy a whole pack

182
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:03,116
I'm gonna want to smoke it.

183
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:05,451
I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

184
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,203
City give me $1,500 ticket.

185
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:08,204
No more.

186
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:32,645
Asshole.

187
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:55,585
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

188
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,003
Oh, shit.

189
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:58,755
That fucking gangster, man.

190
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:01,591
Homeboy just ran a
six second four-Forty.

191
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:04,344
Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

192
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:06,262
You think we'll be
able to go back there?

193
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:08,097
I hate that shit.

194
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:11,017
Fuckin' chino lookin' at us
like we were gonna bust him?

195
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:13,019
Come on, dude. We're wearin' suits, man.

196
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,354
We totally look like cops.

197
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:16,022
He said he got fined for that shit.

198
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:17,273
He was just being cautious.

199
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:21,611
<i>Well, we got pisto, we got frajos.</i>

200
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:23,696
Only one thing missin'.

201
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:28,201
Oh, yeah, I mean besides bitches, man.

202
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:30,537
<i>Yesca? Mm-Hmm.</i>

203
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:32,205
Bingo.

204
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:34,541
I need to feel some reefer madness.

205
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,377
You sure you want to
score some bud, dude?

206
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,546
You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

207
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:43,133
I said I want to get fucked up, man.

208
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,884
Fuck this purity bullshit.

209
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:49,305
Yeah... fuck purity.

210
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:53,893
Aw, man, look at this zero-Head, dog.

211
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,061
Stupid-Ass cholo.

212
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:56,396
Look at that.

213
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,732
That dude's slangin', dog.

214
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:03,153
Want to get a dime?

215
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:06,322
No, I want it all.

216
00:16:12,495 --> 00:16:14,414
Go for the stash, man.

217
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:23,756
Whoa, go, go, go.

218
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:25,425
Hey, hey, yo, yo.

219
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:27,594
That's my shit!

220
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:29,345
Fuck.

221
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:32,765
Outstanding.

222
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,352
That shit was slick.

223
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:38,438
That motherfucker just got schooled.

224
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:40,523
Bitch-Ass cholo.

225
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:42,108
Check this shit out, huh? Yeah.

226
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:44,444
Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

227
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:47,280
Mm. It's not laced either.

228
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,281
Smell that shit.

229
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,449
Smell that motherfucking shit.

230
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:51,534
We just burned my car.

231
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:53,286
We go back there, we're gonna get shot.

232
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,287
Yeah, no shit.

233
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:55,288
Man, bust that light.

234
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:57,123
Roll that shit up.

235
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:59,125
Yeah, yeah, Cool.

236
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,877
Yo, let's drop off some resumés first.

237
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:02,128
Then we'll smoke out, dude.

238
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,296
Some resumés.

239
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:04,464
Yeah.

240
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:06,633
Ah, man, fresh air.

241
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,801
Look.

242
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:09,719
Oh! They're dropped off, man.

243
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:10,970
You fucking asshole, man.

244
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,305
I got to get a fucking job, man.

245
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:13,640
What's your problem, man?

246
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,974
What the fuck are you doing, dickhead.

247
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:16,142
Yo, Mike, first
day looking--

248
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:18,812
Nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

249
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:22,482
Come on, don't sweat it, man.

250
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:25,652
Hey, I can't fuck around tomorrow.

251
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:26,903
I got to get a job for sure.

252
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:28,154
This is your job, man.

253
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:29,572
So act like a fucking professional,

254
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:31,741
Spark up the goods, 'cause
we got a lot of work to do.

255
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:44,087
It's harsh. It's good, though.

256
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,765
You okay?

257
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:57,767
How are those lungs, baby?

258
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,519
There it is.

259
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,188
That magic feeling.

260
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,128
Damn, look at that bitch.

261
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:26,880
Oh, damn.

262
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:33,136
Fuck, yeah.

263
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,721
She's fucking good.

264
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:37,390
I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

265
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,560
You just saw your woman.

266
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,061
Only hit her once, man.

267
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:45,482
We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

268
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:50,236
Family's got that ass under guard, huh?

269
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:51,404
Lock and key.

270
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:54,240
Fuck, I want to get laid.

271
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,410
Pay a visit to my harem, huh?

272
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,578
Online, pornmeister.

273
00:18:58,578 --> 00:19:00,205
Uh-Uh, let's go to Letty's pad, man.

274
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,081
How much you want to bet I hit it.

275
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:03,917
She won't, dog. How
much you want to bet?

276
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,293
She won't give you shit, dog.

277
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:06,920
You big time fucked her over.

278
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,714
Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

279
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:12,967
I got that mind control, man.

280
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:16,596
How much you want to
bet I get back up in it?

281
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:18,097
20 bucks?

282
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:19,432
You ain't got 20 bucks.

283
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:21,434
So, neither do you, man.

284
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:23,269
Come on, shake on that shit.

285
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,688
Come on.

286
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:28,024
What the fuck, let's go.

287
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:30,693
I got it.

288
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:33,321
What's up, Patty?

289
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:36,282
<i>Y tu hermana? She ain't here.</i>

290
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:37,867
<i>Y sabes que?</i>

291
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,953
You're not welcome in this house.

292
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:43,122
Sure, Patty.

293
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:45,291
I'd love to come in.

294
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,044
Thank you.

295
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:50,296
Are they here?

296
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,596
<i>You're looking fine, as fuck, chulas.</i>

297
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:00,807
Don't... don't touch me, please.

298
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,476
Hey, hey.

299
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:07,147
You got to get out of here.

300
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:09,149
Letty...

301
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,318
I just wanted to see you again.

302
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:18,324
<i>Hey, Patty, you want to
grab me a pisto or something?</i>

303
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,368
I ain't grabbing you shit.

304
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:21,744
Oh, you still got a mouth, huh?

305
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,830
Maybe one day you'll
learn how to keep it shut.

306
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,083
Laters. I'm going to my room.

307
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,378
You know you have to
run his ass out of here.

308
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:35,008
Baby.

309
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:40,346
Let's sit down.

310
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:50,440
No, no, no.

311
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,520
So, um...

312
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:56,446
You a cop yet?

313
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:58,031
I'm working on it.

314
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,281
<i>Y tu?</i>

315
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,369
<i>Que andas haciendo?</i>

316
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,788
Well, you know, I'm
going to L.A. Trade Tech.

317
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:08,458
It's good you're doing positive shit.

318
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:22,806
What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

319
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:26,559
It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

320
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,728
Oh, come on, come here.

321
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:29,978
Yeah.

322
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:35,788
Don't.

323
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:40,573
Jim, I got a boyfriend.

324
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:41,573
Who?

325
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,170
Flaco.

326
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:45,745
You're back with that

327
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:48,081
Piece of shit after what he did, Letty?

328
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,584
You're not fucking him, are you?

329
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:53,920
Please tell me no.

330
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,756
Yes. So... just go.

331
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:58,591
'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

332
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:01,176
See?

333
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:03,429
Okay?

334
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:05,265
I don't believe this shit, Letty.

335
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,100
You're too good for that.

336
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,441
You gotta go.

337
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:17,277
Go. Please!

338
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:18,444
Let me talk to them.

339
00:22:18,444 --> 00:22:20,446
No, Jim, don't be stupid. Please.

340
00:22:20,446 --> 00:22:24,784
<i>Okay? Largate. Just go.</i>

341
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:31,875
I guess it's later days.

342
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:44,304
<i>Largate. Just go!</i>

343
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:46,848
<i>Flaco, the pinchi guero's here!</i>

344
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:49,142
<i>Apuarte, Jim! Hurry up!</i>

345
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:51,227
Fuck him up! I got him!

346
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:13,166
Fucking white boy!

347
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:18,004
What's up, faggot?!

348
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:20,840
We're going to fuck you up!

349
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:26,679
Yo! Pop the trunk

350
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:27,931
So I can handle this shit!

351
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:29,682
<i>Fuck you, puto!</i>

352
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:31,351
I'll bust you!

353
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:33,353
Leave him alone!

354
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:37,357
Pop the fucking trunk!

355
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Jim!

356
00:23:57,877 --> 00:23:59,879
Oh, you fucked up!

357
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:02,048
Get your fucking knees
down on the curb now!

358
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,716
Get the fuck over there, man!

359
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:05,718
Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

360
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:06,886
What's your problem, Flaco?

361
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:09,889
Motherfucker!

362
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:11,891
Fucking knees on the curb, man!

363
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:15,311
That's right!

364
00:24:15,311 --> 00:24:19,399
Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

365
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,985
You deaf fuck!

366
00:24:25,655 --> 00:24:26,823
Yo, Mike.

367
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,158
Yeah?

368
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:29,576
Do up their ride.

369
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:32,495
Freeze, bitch!

370
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:35,498
I'm going to take that
big ass of yours home,

371
00:24:35,498 --> 00:24:37,750
Hit it for a minute, you know?

372
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,085
Fuck off!

373
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:40,086
Now you got it.

374
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:45,091
Yo, relax, homie.

375
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:50,430
You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

376
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,598
Fuck!

377
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:56,269
<i>Hey, haina.</i>

378
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:57,437
Whoo!

379
00:24:57,437 --> 00:24:59,022
Fuck off! Oh, yeah?

380
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,940
What you got down here?

381
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,525
Oh...

382
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:04,110
Liking that.

383
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:11,201
Damn! Those are badass kicks, dog.

384
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:14,120
Lucky you got little bitch feet,

385
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,539
Else I'd be stomping around
in them motherfuckers.

386
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:18,458
<i>Fuck you, puto. Huh?</i>

387
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,126
Yeah. Fuck you. Yes?

388
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:24,964
You fucking stay still!

389
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:27,300
Bitches! If you didn't
have that fucking gun,

390
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,886
<i>Ese, it wouldn't be about shit, homie.</i>

391
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:31,805
Not fucking shit!

392
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:34,307
Hey, later, Patty!

393
00:25:34,307 --> 00:25:36,142
I hope you're not pregnant, but you know

394
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,310
You wanted me to blow in you.

395
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,478
Fuck you!

396
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:40,146
Bye, Letty!

397
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:49,239
<i>Salud.</i>

398
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,573
<i>Salud.</i>

399
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,913
Divvy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

400
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,676
I know I got more than that.

401
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:13,763
Yeah. Here we go.

402
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:15,098
Shit.

403
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:17,350
That's my pussy she's giving away there.

404
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:21,104
Homeboy uses extra large.

405
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:22,856
Man, that's it? Next time,

406
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:24,524
Jack someone with a job.

407
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:28,194
Well, fuck you. What
did you get, their lunch?

408
00:26:28,194 --> 00:26:29,946
Check it out.

409
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:33,032
Holy shit. You're kidding me.

410
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:42,375
Whoo! It's a fucking Ruger
P-94. Nine millimeter.

411
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:45,295
14, plus one in the chamber.

412
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:47,046
It's a good fucking gun. Durable.

413
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:48,882
It's brand-New.

414
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:52,969
It's a BB gun.

415
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:54,387
Yeah. Cool.

416
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:56,055
Here you go, dog.

417
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:57,390
<i>About time you got a cohete.</i>

418
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,892
No. I don't want it.

419
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:01,227
Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

420
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:03,229
That's a good reason. Sell it.

421
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:05,315
How much you think we
can get for the gun?

422
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:08,067
Two bills, maybe three. Costs six new.

423
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,236
We'll sell it and split the greenery.

424
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:11,237
You sure?

425
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:12,906
It's cool, dude.

426
00:27:12,906 --> 00:27:14,491
50-50.

427
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,161
Good BB gun though.

428
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,747
Shoot some birds and shit.

429
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,582
Hey, put that shit away.

430
00:27:22,582 --> 00:27:24,083
Looks real as hell.

431
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:26,419
Not a bad day's work.

432
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:40,934
Get down to business though.

433
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:43,436
I know you didn't get any.

434
00:27:43,436 --> 00:27:44,938
So pay up, motherfucker.

435
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:50,944
Dick.

436
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:57,784
Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

437
00:27:57,784 --> 00:28:02,622
This is Bob Luell at
the Palm Glen Group.

438
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:04,707
We have reviewed your resumé,

439
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:07,460
And would like to make an appointment

440
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,878
For later in the week.

441
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:10,046
Please call me at your

442
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:11,881
Earliest convenience.

443
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:12,882
Thank you.

444
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:15,218
Huh? That's good.

445
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:16,803
One more? This is fun.

446
00:28:16,803 --> 00:28:18,972
Sounded a little gay, but it was good.

447
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,142
No, no, no. No. That's
it, dude. That's it.

448
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:24,310
I get too many callbacks,

449
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,562
Sylvia's going to get suspicious.

450
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:27,230
Oh, Sylvia's going to
be kissing your ass.

451
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,648
Not if she recognizes your voice.

452
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:30,650
Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

453
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,318
No, no, no, no, no. I'm cool.

454
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:33,820
Come on. I'm cool.

455
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,322
I want to get home before
the little woman and sober up.

456
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:38,324
Come on, bro. One brew.

457
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:40,660
All right, but hey,

458
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,579
I got to look for a
job tomorrow for sure.

459
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,830
Okay? I can't be getting fucked up

460
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,914
Behind Sylvia's back when I'm supposed

461
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:45,999
To be looking for work, man.

462
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,750
Not cool. Tomorrow, for sure.

463
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,836
I got to find a job, too.

464
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:56,593
Hello.

465
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:01,431
Yes, sir.

466
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,518
Yes, sir. That is correct.

467
00:29:05,518 --> 00:29:07,020
Six years.

468
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,272
Honorably discharged.

469
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:11,024
Yes, sir.

470
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:12,859
I would love to.

471
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,945
Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

472
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:19,032
Tomorrow

473
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:21,951
Is not a problem.

474
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:24,287
Thank you, sir. You
have a good day, too.

475
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:27,040
Good-Bye, sir.

476
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,292
That was the man, huh? You're all "Sir,

477
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,710
Sir, sir."

478
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,881
Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

479
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:41,221
That was the man! That
was the Federal man!

480
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:43,807
The Federal man!

481
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:45,058
Department of Homeland Security

482
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:46,976
Wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

483
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:48,056
Oh, shit!

484
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:51,231
Fucking A, my brother!

485
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:52,565
That shit is righteous, motherfucker!

486
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:53,817
It's on, homie!

487
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:55,485
Wow, man. Tomorrow.

488
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:57,237
So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

489
00:29:57,237 --> 00:29:58,822
I got to take a piss test.

490
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:00,240
If I'm cool, I'm in the house.

491
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:06,746
Yeah! Oh!

492
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:10,250
Shit, dude, do they piss test for weed?

493
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,919
Oh, shit!

494
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:17,173
You fucked up, man.

495
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:19,092
Oh, fuck.

496
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:22,512
I fucked up.

497
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:25,098
Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

498
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:27,517
Fuck! Oh...

499
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:30,603
You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

500
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:33,106
And they will burn me

501
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:35,692
With every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

502
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:36,943
Shit!

503
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:38,278
Wait, wait, wait, wait, dude.

504
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:41,698
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

505
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:43,616
Hey, there's a way out of
every fucking situation.

506
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:46,119
Right? Relax, dude. Yeah, yeah.

507
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,621
Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

508
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:49,789
It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

509
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:50,874
I'll pass that shit.

510
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:52,292
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

511
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:54,711
Of course you will, dude!

512
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:57,630
Later, loco.

513
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,965
Don't fucking trip, dude.

514
00:30:58,965 --> 00:30:59,883
All right.

515
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:01,885
Shit.

516
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:09,142
Eat.

517
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:12,228
Come in, dumb ass!

518
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,151
What's up, dog?

519
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:19,152
What up, dog...

520
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:21,988
Hey, Jim. Want some coffee?

521
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:23,072
Sure.

522
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:24,908
Want some eggs? There's extra.

523
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:27,160
Yes, ma'am. Please.

524
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,163
I, uh, heard about the LAPD.

525
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:32,081
Sorry about that.

526
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:34,000
I thought they guaranteed you a job.

527
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,585
Yea. Me, too.

528
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:39,255
Well, maybe it wasn't meant to be.

529
00:31:39,255 --> 00:31:42,008
You know, you being a cop.

530
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:45,678
Tell her what's up, dude.

531
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:47,013
Well, I applied

532
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:50,099
To all the Federal law
enforcement agencies.

533
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,434
You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

534
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:52,936
ICE, Homeland Security, all of them.

535
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:55,688
And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

536
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:58,274
They want me to come in
today and start testing.

537
00:31:58,274 --> 00:32:00,777
Wow. That's great. How sure is this?

538
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:02,529
Well, I got a urinalysis today.

539
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,781
If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

540
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:06,783
And then I could be
out of here next month.

541
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:08,701
You haven't been smoking out, have you?

542
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:12,455
Nah. Chilled on that shit a while back.

543
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:14,707
Good. Well, thanks for
driving Mike around yesterday.

544
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:16,626
Yeah, sure. Yeah, bro.

545
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:18,628
Three callbacks.

546
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:21,297
Damn! Good!

547
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:24,050
We dropped off enough resumés. Whoo!

548
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,552
Got more.

549
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:26,553
Yeah! Yeah!

550
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:28,138
Well, you have to keep trying

551
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:29,722
Until something happens.

552
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:31,224
<i>Finding a job is a job, right?</i>

553
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:32,559
Lunch money.

554
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,810
Thank you.

555
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,145
And good luck today.

556
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:37,063
Thank you.

557
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:38,565
Love you. I love you, too.

558
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:40,400
Good luck.

559
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,819
And, Jim, good luck on your pee test.

560
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:44,070
I hope you studied.

561
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:49,492
I'm going to cram for it.

562
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:51,911
Man, that's freaky.

563
00:32:51,911 --> 00:32:53,997
She was in a good mood.

564
00:32:53,997 --> 00:32:55,498
Breakfast and beer money?

565
00:32:55,498 --> 00:32:56,499
Yeah, dude.

566
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,918
She heard the messages last night.

567
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:00,086
She got me a sixer.

568
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:01,754
I slammed two last night.

569
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:05,091
Now we know beer is
just a phone call away.

570
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:06,342
Yeah.

571
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:09,095
Yeah. We talked shit
out last night, though.

572
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:12,348
You know? Hey, all she
wants is for me to get a job.

573
00:33:12,348 --> 00:33:15,268
I shouldn't be playing her like that.

574
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:18,688
<i>Dude, you had a good job,</i>

575
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:21,357
With that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

576
00:33:21,357 --> 00:33:22,942
<i>Had, dude. Had.</i>

577
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:25,195
All right? All that shit's in India now.

578
00:33:25,195 --> 00:33:26,863
Want a cold one? No, later.

579
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:28,114
You got any vinegar?

580
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:30,617
Vinegar? What for?

581
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:37,624
Ah...

582
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,626
Oh...

583
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:40,710
Damn, dude!

584
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,878
Ah...!

585
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:45,631
Man! That is fucking sick, man.

586
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:46,633
What'd you do that for?

587
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,134
Shuts down the old kidneys. Ooh.

588
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:50,136
Come on, let's roll.

589
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,646
Grab me that bag, dude.

590
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:08,822
Little trick I learned in the service.

591
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:14,160
Aw, that's sick, dude.

592
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,830
You're gonna stick a
turkey baster in your dick?

593
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:19,499
Quit looking, faggot.

594
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:22,335
You wish.

595
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:30,760
Oh, man.

596
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,095
Fuckin'...

597
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:33,680
Shit, dude.

598
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,764
Oh, fuckin' shit...

599
00:34:34,764 --> 00:34:36,432
Aw...

600
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:39,519
Aw, motherfucker!

601
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:44,524
Whew!

602
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:46,025
Ah...

603
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,448
That was...

604
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:55,118
Unpleasant.

605
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:00,593
Man...

606
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,962
Man, I want to get this shit over with.

607
00:35:05,962 --> 00:35:08,298
You know, my teeth are floating.

608
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,968
Oh...

609
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:14,554
You get those in the military, dog?

610
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:16,806
I was a Ranger.

611
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:18,975
Your mom still suck a mean dick, hmm?

612
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:20,727
Gotcha! Shouldn't ignore people.

613
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,312
Why don't you go fuck yourself!

614
00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:23,480
Hey!

615
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,898
Let's play nice,

616
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:26,483
Boys.

617
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:29,569
I have everyone's "Consent
to Urinalysis" form signed

618
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:30,653
And dated, am I right?

619
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:31,654
Yes, sir.

620
00:35:31,654 --> 00:35:33,656
Good. I'm Agent Richards.

621
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:35,325
Jackets off.

622
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:37,494
I will now administer the easiest test

623
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:39,496
Homeland Security will ever give you,

624
00:35:39,496 --> 00:35:40,914
The whizz quiz.

625
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:43,333
Roll up both sleeves past the elbow.

626
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:49,589
Remove all gloves,
rings, watches, bracelets,

627
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:53,927
Jewelry, Band-Aids and bandages.

628
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:57,514
I want to see nothing but
bare hands and forearms.

629
00:35:57,514 --> 00:36:00,099
Wiggle your fingers.

630
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,852
Let me see both sides.

631
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:04,687
Beautifully done.

632
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:06,815
Again, gentlemen, no talking.

633
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:08,107
Detweiler, is it?

634
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:10,026
You're with me.

635
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:24,791
Fucker.

636
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,965
Next!

637
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,053
Name?

638
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:39,222
Davis, Jim.

639
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:40,890
Ah, the Ranger.

640
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,308
Yes, sir.

641
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:45,311
You serve? 101st.

642
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:47,814
High speed. All right.

643
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:49,732
Think you can fill that, son?

644
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:52,443
I could fill a goddamn trash can, sir.

645
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,488
You're full of piss and
vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

646
00:36:55,488 --> 00:36:57,657
Yes, sir.

647
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:04,913
Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

648
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:05,665
I don't want my head blown off

649
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:07,041
Just when I'm getting it straight.

650
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:11,554
Pop! What's it like...

651
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:13,255
....To just straight-Up
whack a motherfucker?

652
00:37:13,255 --> 00:37:15,884
What's it like? I mean,
what the fuck, you know?

653
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:18,428
It's like nothing. What's
it supposed to be like?

654
00:37:18,428 --> 00:37:19,804
You tell me.

655
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,140
You were busting heads for the military.

656
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,684
I can't talk about this shit, Mike.

657
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:31,274
But I will tell you one
thing-You point and shoot,

658
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:34,110
Pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

659
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,695
You move the fuck on.

660
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:39,699
<i>You do not stop and think about it.</i>

661
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:41,951
It's not a big deal. So if it's nothing,

662
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:43,369
Then what you getting all mad for?

663
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,579
I'm not getting mad.

664
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,039
I just hate stupid questions, Mike.

665
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,208
You think you killed a lot of Commies?

666
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:50,293
They weren't Commies, dumb
ass. Then what were they?

667
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:52,712
You know what they were--
They were fuckin' Hajjis,

668
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:55,256
Terrorists, the bad guys.

669
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:58,301
Did you like it? Oh, shit.

670
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:00,303
Did you dig it?

671
00:38:00,303 --> 00:38:02,722
You bust a nut?

672
00:38:04,224 --> 00:38:06,559
Not fuckin' now, man. Seriously.

673
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:10,230
You're killing my buzz, dude.

674
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,732
Aw, kick back, stress case.

675
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:15,068
Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

676
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:16,236
Hell, yeah.

677
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:17,654
Let's sell this fuckin' piece.

678
00:38:17,654 --> 00:38:20,281
Got to get some scratch,
you know what I'm saying?

679
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:21,074
Pop! Pop! Pop!

680
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,922
Yo, Darrel!

681
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:38,591
Yo, yo, yo, Darrel!
Wake the fuck up, Darrel!

682
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,427
Darrel!

683
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:43,721
Come on, come on, come
on, wake up and fuckin'

684
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,348
Shine!

685
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,398
Y'all need to knock
this shit off right now.

686
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,860
Hey, what's up, bro?

687
00:38:58,695 --> 00:39:00,155
Come on in, motherfuckers.

688
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:01,614
Yeah.

689
00:39:01,614 --> 00:39:03,449
Get your little ass up in here.

690
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:04,576
Shit!

691
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,787
Oh, man...

692
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:10,123
Y'all scared the fuck out of me, man.

693
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,710
You motherfuckers got ties on.

694
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,628
I saw that city-Lookin'
car pull up--

695
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:17,797
I thought y'all was
some rollers or shit.

696
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:21,259
I just got out of County.

697
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:24,637
$9,600. No shit. When?

698
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:26,473
Yesterday.

699
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:28,141
Damn. What'd they put on you?

700
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:29,100
Some bullshit.

701
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,311
I saw some wrong-Ass shit

702
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:32,562
Up in there, dude.

703
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:34,731
I ain't ever going back
to that motherfucker.

704
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:36,316
It scared you straight, huh?

705
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:38,985
Mm-Hmm. Hey, you
get booty-Played?

706
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,322
<i>Hell, no.</i>

707
00:39:42,322 --> 00:39:44,407
You over there tickling
your brown eye, dog?

708
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:46,910
They-They put some jelly
on there, serve some syrup?

709
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,912
You toss the salad?
Hey, you know, nigga,

710
00:39:48,912 --> 00:39:52,749
I kept my ass to the
wall and my mouth shut.

711
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,000
Shoot.

712
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,211
I almost lost my job over that shit.

713
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:57,837
Fuckin' around in there.

714
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:03,259
Oh, God...

715
00:40:03,259 --> 00:40:05,094
You a cop? Nope.

716
00:40:05,094 --> 00:40:06,888
Rejected his ass.

717
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:08,014
Fuck you.

718
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:09,599
I'm getting in the Feds' car.

719
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,559
Damn...!

720
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:15,104
That's what I'm talking about!

721
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,023
Ah, you hear that?

722
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:19,609
<i>This motherfucker gonna be a Fed.</i>

723
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:21,486
Yeah.

724
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,696
You been wanting that shit, too.

725
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:25,657
It's my dream, dude.

726
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,492
So, you gonna do that shit right,

727
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:30,537
Or, you know, you gonna do
a little shit on the side?

728
00:40:30,537 --> 00:40:32,705
I'm gonna get my own thing going.

729
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:35,291
You know, I'll be flipping

Money, drugs, bitches,

Medic saved his ass and he lived.

I got to face my woman.

910
00:49:17,647 --> 00:49:19,983
How in the fuck am I supposed
to play this shit off, huh?

911
00:49:19,983 --> 00:49:22,068
Man, you'll do it, player.

912
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:32,328
Hey, baby girl, you cooking?

913
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:33,746
Yeah. Where have you been?

914
00:49:33,746 --> 00:49:35,248
Oh, Jim's pad.

915
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:36,583
You been drinking?

916
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,251
Oh, you know, I had a few brews.

917
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:39,669
A few? Yeah.

918
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:40,920
You look wasted.

919
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,341
Don't trip, girl.

920
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:46,593
I've been working all day.

921
00:49:46,593 --> 00:49:50,930
I've been looking for work all day.

922
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,933
I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

923
00:49:53,933 --> 00:49:55,768
You know what?

924
00:49:55,768 --> 00:49:58,104
When I'm working, you can lounge.

925
00:49:58,104 --> 00:50:00,023
I'll fix this place up,

926
00:50:00,023 --> 00:50:01,441
Get you nice clothes and stuff...

927
00:50:01,441 --> 00:50:02,692
Mike, Mike, Mike.

928
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:05,278
It doesn't have anything
to do with money.

929
00:50:05,278 --> 00:50:06,696
Come here.

930
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:10,116
Sit down. I want to talk to you.

931
00:50:10,116 --> 00:50:11,701
Hey, it's not about stuff.

932
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:14,704
It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

933
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:16,206
Right.

934
00:50:16,206 --> 00:50:18,374
Hey, I know that you
supported me through college

935
00:50:18,374 --> 00:50:19,876
And I'm gonna always

936
00:50:19,876 --> 00:50:21,044
Owe you for that. Right.

937
00:50:21,044 --> 00:50:22,295
Now everything's flipped

938
00:50:22,295 --> 00:50:23,963
And I feel like I'm
doing everything alone.

939
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:28,051
You know, sometimes I
feel like you're my kid.

940
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:30,053
I mean, you sneak around like one.

941
00:50:30,053 --> 00:50:31,304
Oh-Ho!

942
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:34,390
Look... Wow, dude.

943
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,726
I'm sorry.

944
00:50:36,726 --> 00:50:37,727
Be cool, baby girl,

945
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:39,229
I'm on a mission to
get my shit together.

946
00:50:39,229 --> 00:50:41,815
I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

947
00:50:41,815 --> 00:50:44,150
And this black guy, he
was the office manager

948
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,401
And he's fuckin' hella cool,

949
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:47,237
You know? We're talkin'
and all that shit.

950
00:50:47,237 --> 00:50:49,489
You know? We're just
kickin' it and all that.

951
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:51,991
Did you, did you check the messages?

952
00:50:53,827 --> 00:50:56,329
Four messages.

953
00:50:56,329 --> 00:50:57,997
Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

954
00:50:57,997 --> 00:51:00,667
From Sunhouse Properties
to schedule an interview.

955
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:03,253
Honey, this is great!

956
00:51:03,253 --> 00:51:06,172
Mm, mm... Oh! Oh...

957
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:08,174
You better call him first
thing in the morning.

958
00:51:08,174 --> 00:51:09,759
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

959
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:13,179
Oh, damn, dog, that shit was good, dude.

960
00:51:13,179 --> 00:51:15,682
Damn, they should give you a
fuckin' Oscar for that shit.

961
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:28,361
You just stood there

962
00:51:28,361 --> 00:51:32,365
And you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

963
00:51:32,365 --> 00:51:36,202
You should be the lawyer.

964
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:38,788
How could you just do that?

965
00:51:38,788 --> 00:51:42,542
How could you look me in the
eye and lie to me like that?

966
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:43,626
I'm sorry.

967
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:46,212
I'd rather you hit me.

968
00:51:47,714 --> 00:51:49,549
I'm your clown.

969
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:51,134
I'm your fucking clown.

970
00:51:51,134 --> 00:51:54,721
And you and Jim are laughing at me?

971
00:51:54,721 --> 00:51:56,723
No, it's not...

972
00:51:56,723 --> 00:52:01,060
No, no, no, you are so
utterly, irrevocably busted!

973
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:07,150
Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

974
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,152
Go cook up more lies.

975
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:11,154
You know, I bet you're
doing lines again.

976
00:52:11,154 --> 00:52:13,823
Dude, how could you say that shit?

977
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:15,074
I'm not fuckin' doing lines again.

978
00:52:15,074 --> 00:52:16,659
Yeah, right, right.

979
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:18,328
I'm not fuckin' doing lines again!

980
00:52:18,328 --> 00:52:20,914
Right now your word is less than shit.

981
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:22,999
Maybe you should go.

982
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:26,920
Just fuckin' go.

983
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,090
Just fuckin'... just go, right?

984
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,675
Fuck it. I'll fuckin' go!

985
00:52:32,675 --> 00:52:33,843
Please, go. Go!

986
00:52:33,843 --> 00:52:35,762
Fuck it then! I'll fuckin' go!

987
00:52:35,762 --> 00:52:37,430
Then go, Mike!

988
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,598
I'm serious! I'll fuckin' go

989
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:39,849
Except I won't fuckin' come back!

990
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:41,100
You want me to fuckin' go?!

991
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,101
Fuckin' go, Mike!

992
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:43,436
I'll fuckin' go then!

993
00:52:43,436 --> 00:52:44,437
I'll fuckin' go!

994
00:52:44,437 --> 00:52:47,440
Get the fuck outta here!

995
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,000
Hello?

996
00:52:56,866 --> 00:52:57,946
Speaking.

997
00:53:00,537 --> 00:53:04,791
Of course, sir. Absolutely.

998
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,877
Thank you very much, Agent Richards.

999
00:53:07,877 --> 00:53:09,963
Thank you, sir.

1000
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,136
Who was that?

1001
00:53:16,136 --> 00:53:17,554
That was the feds, my friend.

1002
00:53:17,554 --> 00:53:21,224
I've been informed that
I passed my urinalysis

1003
00:53:21,224 --> 00:53:23,726
And they would like me
to go in this morning

1004
00:53:23,726 --> 00:53:26,980
To start formal testing.

1005
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,481
Fuck yeah, dude.

1006
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:29,649
I'll be there all day,

1007
00:53:29,649 --> 00:53:32,735
So take my ride, get your ass a job.

1008
00:53:32,735 --> 00:53:33,820
Let's go.

1009
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,155
Oh, shit!

1010
00:53:35,155 --> 00:53:38,825
Come on. Get your parasitic ass in gear.

1011
00:53:42,912 --> 00:53:46,833
I had some twisted-Ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

1012
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,835
I slept like a baby.

1013
00:53:48,835 --> 00:53:52,338
I heard screaming.

1014
00:53:52,338 --> 00:53:53,923
What kind of tests?

1015
00:53:53,923 --> 00:53:56,759
Psychological tests.

1016
00:53:56,759 --> 00:54:00,013
Geez, you're a freakin' psycho, dude.

1017
00:54:00,013 --> 00:54:01,514
Don't answer that shit honestly.

1018
00:54:01,514 --> 00:54:04,017
Hell no.

1019
00:54:04,017 --> 00:54:07,353
They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

1020
00:54:07,353 --> 00:54:11,524
It's like 600 questions,
cross-Referenced

1021
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:13,610
To detect deception.

1022
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,111
They ask the same shit

1023
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:17,113
Six different ways. It's lame.

1024
00:54:17,113 --> 00:54:19,032
You'll ace it.

1025
00:54:19,032 --> 00:54:22,619
Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

1026
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:26,206
All I needed was a shot.

1027
00:54:26,206 --> 00:54:28,041
Gotta play the system.

1028
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:31,377
Like a piano.

1029
00:54:40,303 --> 00:54:41,888
You done with that crap, son?

1030
00:54:41,888 --> 00:54:43,223
Yes, sir.

1031
00:54:43,223 --> 00:54:45,892
Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

1032
00:54:45,892 --> 00:54:47,977
Bring that with you.

1033
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:50,980
I see dumb people.

1034
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,402
We reviewed your LAPD package.

1035
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:58,988
Since they ran your
background, physical and psych,

1036
00:54:58,988 --> 00:55:01,074
We're going with their paper.

1037
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:02,659
Navy sucks. Army swallows.

1038
00:55:02,659 --> 00:55:04,577
Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

1039
00:55:04,577 --> 00:55:06,079
From their people.

1040
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,665
They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

1041
00:55:08,665 --> 00:55:10,250
Move it, dirt bag.

1042
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:13,253
Why'd they drop me?

1043
00:55:13,253 --> 00:55:15,755
Someone here make a call?

1044
00:55:15,755 --> 00:55:17,173
Nope.

1045
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:18,508
They dropped you on psych, Jim.

1046
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:22,011
You blew their profiles.

1047
00:55:22,011 --> 00:55:24,764
We're all a little goofy here.

1048
00:55:24,764 --> 00:55:27,433
You'd rather be with us, wouldn't you?

1049
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:29,102
Absolutely, sir.

1050
00:55:29,102 --> 00:55:31,437
Good answer.

1051
00:55:31,437 --> 00:55:32,939
Have a seat.

1052
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:36,192
Said you were bilingual on your app.

1053
00:55:36,192 --> 00:55:37,861
They want to test your Spanish.

1054
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:40,280
We can get that going if you got time.

1055
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,115
Yes. Sure.

1056
00:55:42,115 --> 00:55:43,700
Who's "they"?

1057
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,285
Your fans upstairs.

1058
00:55:45,285 --> 00:55:47,203
Fans upstairs? Who?

1059
00:55:47,203 --> 00:55:49,789
This is some shit above my pay grade,

1060
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:53,376
But some very important
people have an eye on you, Jim.

1061
00:55:57,714 --> 00:55:59,299
Westside Realty Management.

1062
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:01,050
How may I direct your call?

1063
00:56:02,135 --> 00:56:03,303
Please hold.

1064
00:56:03,303 --> 00:56:06,639
Okay, Mike...

1065
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:08,141
Alonzo?

1066
00:56:08,141 --> 00:56:09,559
Oh, shit. Joe?!

1067
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:10,977
Damn...! What's up, dog?

1068
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:13,062
Mikey, look at you. What
are you doing here, dude?

1069
00:56:13,062 --> 00:56:15,064
Mikey, man, check you out.

1070
00:56:15,064 --> 00:56:16,316
What the fuck you doing here?

1071
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:17,734
Fucking grew up. I work here.

1072
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:19,319
Get out of here. Yeah.

1073
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:21,070
Dude, you got to come on up.

1074
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,322
Yeah, I'll show you the office.

1075
00:56:22,322 --> 00:56:23,823
Fuck, you're gonna trip, man,

1076
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:25,241
I can see the ocean and everything.

1077
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:27,660
Check you out, fucking
ocean view and all that.

1078
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,662
You're wearing a suit now.

1079
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:31,247
Got your hair cut. Hey, watch out, baby.

1080
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:32,415
Yeah. Tag no more, huh?

1081
00:56:32,415 --> 00:56:33,833
No, man.

1082
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:35,335
Dude, what's up with
your brother, Pedro?

1083
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:37,420
Oh, man, he's in Iraq.
He's in a forward unit.

1084
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,339
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah.

1085
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:41,591
Fuckin' Mexicans.

1086
00:56:43,593 --> 00:56:44,511
Bye, sweetie.

1087
00:56:48,097 --> 00:56:50,266
Thank you, sir. I need
me some of this, man.

1088
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:51,684
I've been taking piss all day.

1089
00:56:51,684 --> 00:56:52,685
Dude!

1090
00:56:52,685 --> 00:56:53,520
What?

1091
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,521
You're not going to

1092
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:55,688
Fucking believe this. What?

1093
00:56:55,688 --> 00:56:57,857
I had an interview today. Yeah?

1094
00:56:57,857 --> 00:56:59,359
Remember Crazy Joe? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1095
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,277
Dude stomped that guy's
face in at Taco Land

1096
00:57:01,277 --> 00:57:03,279
For grabbing his chick's ass.

1097
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,864
Homeboy got his shit together, man.

1098
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:05,949
Went to UCLA.

1099
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:08,201
Works at this office up in Century City.

1100
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:09,619
I got the hookup, dog.

1101
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:11,788
12 an hour. Hoo-Hoo!

1102
00:57:11,788 --> 00:57:13,456
That's a lot of lettuce. That's right.

1103
00:57:13,456 --> 00:57:15,125
And in three months, I get benefits.

1104
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:16,209
Damn! Benefits?

1105
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:17,961
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Shit!

1106
00:57:17,961 --> 00:57:19,129
Yeah!

1107
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:20,797
It's not for sure yet, though, dude.

1108
00:57:20,797 --> 00:57:22,465
I still got to meet the owner, right.

1109
00:57:22,465 --> 00:57:24,217
But he says I'm straight.

1110
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:25,552
It's all good, you know.

1111
00:57:25,552 --> 00:57:27,554
You're in. Dude...

1112
00:57:27,554 --> 00:57:29,055
I'm in. Oh, shit.

1113
00:57:29,055 --> 00:57:30,557
Yeah... What happened?

1114
00:57:30,557 --> 00:57:32,142
They want my ass, man.
Going back tomorrow

1115
00:57:32,142 --> 00:57:33,560
For a polygraph test.

1116
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,812
If I pass that, they'll
send me to Georgia next week.

1117
00:57:35,812 --> 00:57:37,897
Oh...! Damn! It's like that?!

1118
00:57:37,897 --> 00:57:39,232
What's up, lawman?

1119
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:40,567
Whoo-Hoo!

1120
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:42,235
How you gonna pass a lie detector test,

1121
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:43,903
You lying motherfucker? Aw, easy, man.

1122
00:57:43,903 --> 00:57:46,739
After every question,
you just fucking squeeze

1123
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,408
Like you're taking a
dump, you know, man.

1124
00:57:48,408 --> 00:57:50,493
It throws the machine off. Ooh! Oh, dog.

1125
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:52,245
You're gonna shit your
pants like that, bro.

1126
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:53,413
Fuck, I think I just did.

1127
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:55,081
All right, Jim,

1128
00:57:55,081 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm going to ask you
some control questions

1129
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,252
Before we get to the good stuff.

1130
00:57:59,252 --> 00:58:01,754
They can be answered just "yes" or "no."

1131
00:58:01,754 --> 00:58:05,008
Just relax and respond naturally.

1132
00:58:06,092 --> 00:58:07,177
Are you ready?

1133
00:58:07,177 --> 00:58:08,178
Yes, sir.

1134
00:58:08,178 --> 00:58:10,597
You can just answer "yes" or "no."

1135
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:16,019
"Is your name Jim Luther Davis?"

1136
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:17,770
Yes.

1137
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:20,356
"Do you live in Los Angeles?"

1138
00:58:20,356 --> 00:58:21,356
Yes.

1139
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:25,862
"Are you 26 years old?"

1140
00:58:25,862 --> 00:58:26,946
Yes.

1141
00:58:28,448 --> 00:58:30,116
"Are you married?"

1142
00:58:30,116 --> 00:58:30,866
No.

1143
00:58:35,789 --> 00:58:37,207
"Are you wearing shoes?"

1144
00:58:37,207 --> 00:58:38,207
Yes.

1145
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,797
"Have you ever smoked marijuana?"

1146
00:58:43,797 --> 00:58:44,797
Yes.

1147
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:51,137
"Aside from the occasion you
mentioned in your application?"

1148
00:58:51,137 --> 00:58:51,887
No.

1149
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:58,978
Jim, knock it off.

1150
00:59:00,897 --> 00:59:02,148
What, sir?

1151
00:59:02,148 --> 00:59:04,234
Son, I've been doing
polygraph examinations

1152
00:59:04,234 --> 00:59:07,487
Since you were swimming
in your daddy's balls.

1153
00:59:07,487 --> 00:59:09,989
So I know all the tricks.

1154
00:59:09,989 --> 00:59:11,658
You've either got a tack in your shoe

1155
00:59:11,658 --> 00:59:13,660
Or you're clinching your butt.

1156
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,496
I've got spikes all over this thing.

1157
00:59:16,496 --> 00:59:19,666
If you do it again,

1158
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:22,001
I'm going to void this test

1159
00:59:22,001 --> 00:59:24,087
And report that you were uncooperative.

1160
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:25,421
Do you understand?

1161
00:59:25,421 --> 00:59:27,257
Yes, sir.

1162
00:59:30,176 --> 00:59:32,011
Walk with me.

1163
00:59:34,097 --> 00:59:35,431
We've got a problem, Jim.

1164
00:59:35,431 --> 00:59:36,850
With what?

1165
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:38,434
With your candor.

1166
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:41,604
Come in.

1167
00:59:41,604 --> 00:59:42,689
He's here, sir.

1168
00:59:42,689 --> 00:59:44,440
Bring him in.

1169
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:48,611
Jim, this is Mr. Hollenbeck,
our regional director.

1170
00:59:48,611 --> 00:59:49,612
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1171
00:59:49,612 --> 00:59:51,197
Have a seat.

1172
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:52,782
Mr. Gillespie.

1173
00:59:52,782 --> 00:59:55,201
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1174
00:59:57,537 --> 00:59:59,873
Jim, uh...

1175
00:59:59,873 --> 01:00:01,124
You're an exemplary candidate

1176
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:03,543
With valuable operational experience.

1177
01:00:03,543 --> 01:00:07,213
You've cleared the psych
and physical hurdles.

1178
01:00:07,213 --> 01:00:09,966
Your credit's good, you've
kept your nose clean,

1179
01:00:09,966 --> 01:00:11,468
You've got the Spanish.

1180
01:00:11,468 --> 01:00:12,802
You clearance is still valid.

1181
01:00:12,802 --> 01:00:14,220
Everybody we talked to for background

1182
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:17,140
Had only great things to say about you.

1183
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,225
And then you scored a
negative-Five on the polygraph.

1184
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:23,563
That's indicative of deception.

1185
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:25,148
We were wondering why

1186
01:00:25,148 --> 01:00:27,984
Until we got the results of urinalysis.

1187
01:00:27,984 --> 01:00:31,738
We detected THC metabolites
in the urine, Jim.

1188
01:00:33,573 --> 01:00:36,576
Levels were just below
the positive threshold,

1189
01:00:36,576 --> 01:00:39,245
But there was a presence.

1190
01:00:39,245 --> 01:00:41,331
Do you have a drug problem, Mr. Davis?

1191
01:00:41,331 --> 01:00:42,916
I don't have a drug problem, sir.

1192
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:47,253
I made a very stupid mistake.

1193
01:00:47,253 --> 01:00:48,671
Would you care to tell
us the circumstances

1194
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:49,839
Of your stupid mistake?

1195
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:51,841
I was at a party...

1196
01:00:51,841 --> 01:00:55,011
And someone offered me a joint.

1197
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:58,765
I was pretty angry
about not getting into

1198
01:00:58,765 --> 01:01:02,769
The LAPD, so I was
feeling rebellious and, uh

1199
01:01:05,772 --> 01:01:08,441
I inhaled.

1200
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:11,111
Someone considering a
career in law enforcement

1201
01:01:11,111 --> 01:01:12,695
Would be well advised to exercise

1202
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:14,364
A little more discipline.

1203
01:01:14,364 --> 01:01:16,282
Yes, sir.

1204
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,620
I'm on the fence, Doug.

1205
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,205
It's your call.

1206
01:01:22,205 --> 01:01:24,541
Mr. Davis, I'm in charge
of several programs.

1207
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:26,543
Yes, sir?

1208
01:01:26,543 --> 01:01:29,462
Had a nice chat with your
old commanding officer.

1209
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:39,722
Good.

1210
01:01:39,722 --> 01:01:41,057
Recognize these guys?

1211
01:01:44,644 --> 01:01:46,729
Huh? Yeah,

1212
01:01:46,729 --> 01:01:47,730
They're your buddies.

1213
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,315
Your old Hajji buddies.

1214
01:01:49,315 --> 01:01:51,401
You should work in a deli
how you sliced these guys up.

1215
01:01:51,401 --> 01:01:52,485
Jesus Christ.

1216
01:01:52,485 --> 01:01:53,987
Oh, I'm sorry.

1217
01:01:53,987 --> 01:01:56,489
Did I ruin your lunch?

1218
01:01:56,489 --> 01:01:58,324
You went through those sons of bitches

1219
01:01:58,324 --> 01:02:00,410
Like butter.

1220
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,995
I took my objective

1221
01:02:01,995 --> 01:02:03,580
And did what was necessary

1222
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,583
To obtain information
vital to national security

1223
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:08,751
That saved American lives.

1224
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:10,670
Whacked them all, huh, Jim?

1225
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,922
My C.O. Told me not to
leave anything breathing.

1226
01:02:12,922 --> 01:02:14,841
I do what I'm told. Relax, son.

1227
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:18,678
You were getting paid to fuck people up.

1228
01:02:18,678 --> 01:02:20,346
You know we're beefing up
our anti-Narcotics programs

1229
01:02:20,346 --> 01:02:22,849
In Latin America.

1230
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:24,017
Yes, sir.

1231
01:02:24,017 --> 01:02:26,853
I had heard some
things on the grapevine.

1232
01:02:26,853 --> 01:02:28,521
I want you on my team.

1233
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:30,356
I need someone who can get things done

1234
01:02:30,356 --> 01:02:32,192
On my task force in Colombia.

1235
01:02:32,192 --> 01:02:32,912
Sir...

1236
01:02:34,611 --> 01:02:37,280
I listed Los Angeles and
San Diego on my dream sheet.

1237
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,115
No slots in southern California?

1238
01:02:39,115 --> 01:02:40,784
No, Jim.

1239
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:41,785
I got Colombia.

1240
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:43,703
That's what I have for you.

1241
01:02:43,703 --> 01:02:45,705
If it's not what you want,

1242
01:02:45,705 --> 01:02:46,706
Thank you for your time.

1243
01:02:46,706 --> 01:02:49,125
You can hit the door.

1244
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,797
What exactly would I be doing?

1245
01:02:53,797 --> 01:02:56,382
Running and gunning in the jungle?

1246
01:02:56,382 --> 01:02:58,551
Mr. Davis, this is the deal.

1247
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:00,553
You'll be riding shotgun with the locals

1248
01:03:00,553 --> 01:03:02,806
As interpreter-Advisor
on sharp end operations.

1249
01:03:02,806 --> 01:03:04,307
You'll be in some very hot areas.

1250
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:06,142
How hot?

1251
01:03:06,142 --> 01:03:07,644
We talking trigger time?

1252
01:03:07,644 --> 01:03:08,978
Sure, if you want.

1253
01:03:08,978 --> 01:03:11,898
Well, who exactly
would I be working for?

1254
01:03:11,898 --> 01:03:14,067
The U.S. Government, Jim.

1255
01:03:14,067 --> 01:03:16,903
I want you in Glynco, Georgia next week.

1256
01:03:16,903 --> 01:03:19,072
You make it through in one piece,

1257
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:22,659
You'll be working Colombia's
finest by the summer.

1258
01:03:22,659 --> 01:03:24,577
It's just that...

1259
01:03:24,577 --> 01:03:27,163
I'm supposed to get married, sir.

1260
01:03:27,163 --> 01:03:29,249
Maybe now is not the
time to start a family.

1261
01:03:29,249 --> 01:03:30,917
We've been together a long time.

1262
01:03:30,917 --> 01:03:33,336
I'm serious about marrying her.

1263
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:38,258
Foreign bride could jeopardize
your security clearance.

1264
01:03:38,258 --> 01:03:43,096
Jim, don't shack up with some Mexican.

1265
01:03:43,096 --> 01:03:46,516
Colombian broads are
smoking hot and knee deep.

1266
01:03:46,516 --> 01:03:48,768
You get a per diem and a driver.

1267
01:03:48,768 --> 01:03:50,937
You'll live like a
fucking king down there.

1268
01:03:50,937 --> 01:03:52,021
Yes, sir, I understand.

1269
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:53,106
You take some time,

1270
01:03:53,106 --> 01:03:54,524
Think about what you want to do.

1271
01:03:54,524 --> 01:03:55,608
This is a serious commitment.

1272
01:03:59,779 --> 01:04:03,199
I want the opportunity, sir.

1273
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:05,201
I want on board.

1274
01:04:10,123 --> 01:04:11,624
Welcome aboard.

1275
01:04:11,624 --> 01:04:13,126
I'm taking a big chance on you.

1276
01:04:13,126 --> 01:04:14,210
Thank you, sir.

1277
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:15,879
This is the career I've dreamed of.

1278
01:04:15,879 --> 01:04:17,297
These are your orders,

1279
01:04:17,297 --> 01:04:18,798
Orientation material and travel money.

1280
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:22,802
Report to FLETC before the
end of working hours Wednesday.

1281
01:04:22,802 --> 01:04:24,971
Thank you, sir.

1282
01:04:24,971 --> 01:04:26,139
Go.

1283
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:46,326
Sorry, dog.

1284
01:04:52,165 --> 01:04:54,250
I got the job.

1285
01:04:55,418 --> 01:04:57,253
Oh, shit.

1286
01:04:57,253 --> 01:04:58,503
Yeah?

1287
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:02,008
Me, too.

1288
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,596
When do you start? Monday.

1289
01:05:06,596 --> 01:05:08,014
When do you start?

1290
01:05:08,014 --> 01:05:09,265
Wednesday.

1291
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:12,685
Big Jim, back on the man's payroll.

1292
01:05:12,685 --> 01:05:15,522
Got the W-2

1293
01:05:15,522 --> 01:05:18,775
And the employee handbook
as proof of employment.

1294
01:05:18,775 --> 01:05:21,861
I will be back in the
arms of my woman tonight.

1295
01:05:21,861 --> 01:05:23,111
Good.

1296
01:05:25,115 --> 01:05:27,534
Hey, we got to celebrate this shit.

1297
01:05:28,535 --> 01:05:30,120
<i>Salud.</i>

1298
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:34,958
Oh, shit.

1299
01:05:38,962 --> 01:05:40,713
Fuzz.

1300
01:05:40,713 --> 01:05:42,632
They're on my ass, dog.

1301
01:05:42,632 --> 01:05:45,468
<i>And my license is suspended.</i>

1302
01:05:45,468 --> 01:05:47,303
Yeah, maybe he's after someone else.

1303
01:05:49,389 --> 01:05:51,558
Shit. Fucking shit, man.

1304
01:05:51,558 --> 01:05:53,810
He's pointing right at me.

1305
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,895
And we got the open beers.

1306
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:58,815
Fuck the beers, the guns.

1307
01:05:58,815 --> 01:06:00,733
Shoot the fucker.

1308
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:02,569
Car's in my name. We're fucked.

1309
01:06:05,572 --> 01:06:09,325
Shit. Right when shit was
starting to go good, dude,

1310
01:06:09,325 --> 01:06:10,410
I'm going to jail.

1311
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:11,744
Damn it, I'm going to jail.

1312
01:06:13,997 --> 01:06:15,582
I can dump these guys.

1313
01:06:16,749 --> 01:06:18,835
Rip the video from their trunk.

1314
01:06:24,507 --> 01:06:25,675
Let's see them hands.

1315
01:06:25,675 --> 01:06:26,759
Let's see your hands

1316
01:06:26,759 --> 01:06:28,678
On the fucking dash!

1317
01:06:28,678 --> 01:06:31,681
Grab the sky or I'll blow
your fucking heads off.

1318
01:06:31,681 --> 01:06:33,933
Blink and die, scumbags.

1319
01:06:38,021 --> 01:06:38,771
Oh.

1320
01:06:39,773 --> 01:06:41,608
Look who it is, dude.

1321
01:06:41,608 --> 01:06:43,193
It's all right, I know these guys.

1322
01:06:43,193 --> 01:06:45,278
You fucking asshole.

1323
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:47,280
You're such a prick. You
scared the fuck out of me.

1324
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,617
What's up, homie?

1325
01:06:50,617 --> 01:06:53,286
What's up, fool? What's up, man.

1326
01:06:53,286 --> 01:06:55,872
I almost shot you, jerk.

1327
01:06:55,872 --> 01:06:57,373
That shit wasn't fucking funny, Leo.

1328
01:06:57,373 --> 01:06:58,458
Yeah, it was hilarious.

1329
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:01,211
You guys getting fucked up?

1330
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:04,547
Of course, dog, it's Friday.

1331
01:07:04,547 --> 01:07:06,883
Well, Boot, you in the Academy yet?

1332
01:07:06,883 --> 01:07:08,885
Fuck no.

1333
01:07:08,885 --> 01:07:10,220
Fuck the LAPD.

1334
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,806
It's local small-Time bullshit.

1335
01:07:12,806 --> 01:07:13,890
I'm going with the feds.

1336
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:15,058
How'd you get that hook-Up, dog?

1337
01:07:15,058 --> 01:07:17,227
You know, me, got my connects, you know.

1338
01:07:17,227 --> 01:07:18,311
Going to FLETC on Wednesday.

1339
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:20,063
Hey, see you can get me in there.

1340
01:07:20,063 --> 01:07:21,731
Yeah, I'll look into that.

1341
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:23,566
How's Sylvia?

1342
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:25,735
None of your concern, ass wipe.

1343
01:07:25,735 --> 01:07:28,154
Say hi to her for me, no?

1344
01:07:28,154 --> 01:07:29,489
No.

1345
01:07:29,489 --> 01:07:33,159
<i>This vato's all
protective of his female.</i>

1346
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:35,328
Check this out.

1347
01:07:36,913 --> 01:07:37,914
Nice, huh?

1348
01:07:37,914 --> 01:07:40,500
It's a nine? Uh-Huh.

1349
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,335
Sorry, dog, I got a lot of nines.

1350
01:07:42,335 --> 01:07:43,920
Come on, dude, it's a bad-Ass Ruger.

1351
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,256
Talk to Toussaint. He'll buy that shit.

1352
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:48,258
Toussaint, he's... he's in Florida.

1353
01:07:48,258 --> 01:07:50,760
He's back. He called me today.

1354
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,181
Page me tonight, bro.

1355
01:07:55,181 --> 01:07:59,185
<i>We'll hit the clubs and
tear up some fine hinas.</i>

1356
01:07:59,185 --> 01:08:01,855
Later. Sure, dog.

1357
01:08:01,855 --> 01:08:03,356
I'm on the City's time.

1358
01:08:03,356 --> 01:08:06,109
You guys be cool.

1359
01:08:06,109 --> 01:08:08,111
Okay?

1360
01:08:12,532 --> 01:08:14,200
That fuck-- He
put a scare in me.

1361
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,535
Yeah, me, too.

1362
01:08:15,535 --> 01:08:16,703
He's a dick.

1363
01:08:16,703 --> 01:08:18,455
Want to party with him?

1364
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:25,545
See if this motherfucker's home, dude.

1365
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:37,140
Toussaint? Toussaint?!

1366
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,308
Yo, Toussaint?

1367
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:39,642
Yeah, come on, man.

1368
01:08:39,642 --> 01:08:43,563
Can't go far in that little
fucking place of yours. Fuck in.

1369
01:08:43,563 --> 01:08:45,648
Goddamm it, I'm coming.

1370
01:08:45,648 --> 01:08:47,567
Chill out.

1371
01:08:49,068 --> 01:08:50,487
Washing that dirty ass.

1372
01:08:54,574 --> 01:08:56,576
Damn it.

1373
01:08:56,576 --> 01:08:59,245
Group love. Group... Come on.

1374
01:08:59,245 --> 01:09:00,413
Group love, boys.

1375
01:09:00,413 --> 01:09:04,250
Welcome back, hometown.

1376
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:07,754
Hey, I missed you crazy fuckers, man.

1377
01:09:07,754 --> 01:09:09,255
Leo told us you were back.

1378
01:09:09,255 --> 01:09:11,508
Thanks for calling asshole.

1379
01:09:15,929 --> 01:09:17,129
You a cop?

1380
01:09:19,432 --> 01:09:20,767
Uh-Uh. Going federal.

1381
01:09:22,602 --> 01:09:24,938
Man, craziest head I know

1382
01:09:24,938 --> 01:09:26,106
Is going

1383
01:09:26,106 --> 01:09:27,107
To be a fed.

1384
01:09:27,107 --> 01:09:30,443
Yes, sir! Sir.

1385
01:09:30,443 --> 01:09:32,112
Still sponging off your woman?

1386
01:09:32,112 --> 01:09:34,614
Fuck you, dog. I got a job.

1387
01:09:34,614 --> 01:09:35,615
This motherfucker.

1388
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,118
Look, dude.

1389
01:09:39,619 --> 01:09:41,621
This is bad.

1390
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:44,207
It's yours for three big ones, dog.

1391
01:09:44,207 --> 01:09:48,211
Fuck yeah, I want it.

1392
01:09:48,211 --> 01:09:51,881
What's up? What's up?

1393
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:53,633
Huh?

1394
01:09:53,633 --> 01:09:56,052
What the fuck you say now, huh?

1395
01:09:56,052 --> 01:09:57,637
Hey. Huh?

1396
01:09:57,637 --> 01:10:00,306
Bam, bam, bam.

1397
01:10:00,306 --> 01:10:03,309
Motherfucker, I'm strapped.

1398
01:10:03,309 --> 01:10:05,728
What the fuck is up now, huh?

1399
01:10:05,728 --> 01:10:07,564
Whoo-Ooh!

1400
01:10:07,564 --> 01:10:08,731
Whoa, whoa.

1401
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:10,316
Your kneecap and shit.

1402
01:10:10,316 --> 01:10:14,737
Step up and get blasted.

1403
01:10:14,737 --> 01:10:18,741
Shit, man, what the fuck is up now?

1404
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:20,660
Hey, kick back, gunslinger.

1405
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,661
It's loaded.

1406
01:10:21,661 --> 01:10:22,996
That shit goes through walls.

1407
01:10:22,996 --> 01:10:24,164
You pop the neighbor's little kids.

1408
01:10:25,498 --> 01:10:26,666
Uh-Oh.

1409
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:28,001
Ooh.

1410
01:10:28,918 --> 01:10:31,838
Fuck, dude.

1411
01:10:31,838 --> 01:10:34,924
Whoa, I'm straight, bro.

1412
01:10:34,924 --> 01:10:39,179
Yo, guys, we got to
party tonight, you know?

1413
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:41,014
Go clubbin' or something.

1414
01:10:41,014 --> 01:10:42,348
I got a better idea.

1415
01:10:42,348 --> 01:10:43,349
What?

1416
01:10:43,349 --> 01:10:44,350
Here, sir.

1417
01:10:46,352 --> 01:10:48,354
Let's go to Mexico.

1418
01:10:48,354 --> 01:10:50,023
Mexico?!

1419
01:10:50,023 --> 01:10:52,108
Yeah. I'm in.

1420
01:10:56,029 --> 01:10:57,864
Only fags like that...

1421
01:10:57,864 --> 01:10:59,866
Because you're a little faggot.

1422
01:10:59,866 --> 01:11:01,367
I don't get it, too much fucking hills.

1423
01:11:01,367 --> 01:11:02,452
Right, right.

1424
01:11:02,452 --> 01:11:05,872
Dude, yo, dude, stay
back boy, stay back.

1425
01:11:05,872 --> 01:11:08,208
Motherfucker's got to ask permission.

1426
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:11,127
Fuck you, all right?

1427
01:11:11,127 --> 01:11:12,962
Let me tell you something.

1428
01:11:12,962 --> 01:11:14,964
I am a grown motherfucking
man, all right?

1429
01:11:14,964 --> 01:11:16,716
I'm going to tell her the good news,

1430
01:11:16,716 --> 01:11:19,052
Make up, grab my shit and we are out.

1431
01:11:19,052 --> 01:11:21,554
Lines, lines, and more lines.

1432
01:11:21,554 --> 01:11:23,890
For many passengers
traveling through LAX,

1433
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:26,059
The waiting has become unbearable.

1434
01:11:26,059 --> 01:11:27,560
It's hit or miss, you
can't predict it...

1435
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,563
Excuse me, you're not made out of glass.

1436
01:11:30,563 --> 01:11:31,564
I'm made out of me.

1437
01:11:31,564 --> 01:11:34,234
You're drunk.

1438
01:11:34,234 --> 01:11:35,735
I'm celebrating, baby.

1439
01:11:35,735 --> 01:11:37,153
What, another wasted day?

1440
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,657
Here.

1441
01:11:40,657 --> 01:11:43,076
...security since 9-11,
but that's true everywhere.

1442
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:46,246
...and still a recent
study shows the wait at LAX

1443
01:11:46,246 --> 01:11:47,831
Is the third longest in the world...

1444
01:11:51,584 --> 01:11:53,002
This is a good company.

1445
01:11:53,002 --> 01:11:55,213
They make all the new condos downtown.

1446
01:11:55,213 --> 01:11:56,214
How much?

1447
01:11:56,214 --> 01:11:57,298
$12 an hour.

1448
01:11:57,298 --> 01:11:58,299
Plus their MIS guy

1449
01:11:58,299 --> 01:11:59,509
Is leaving in three months.

1450
01:11:59,509 --> 01:12:01,344
I'm going to update my certifications

1451
01:12:01,344 --> 01:12:02,595
And take his job over.

1452
01:12:02,595 --> 01:12:03,763
Then I'll make bank.

1453
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:09,018
Such an asshole.

1454
01:12:09,018 --> 01:12:11,020
What? Why? This shit is real.

1455
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,022
This is a great job,
the pay is outstanding

1456
01:12:13,022 --> 01:12:15,942
And it's a great opportunity
for me to do what I want to do.

1457
01:12:15,942 --> 01:12:17,694
I know.

1458
01:12:17,694 --> 01:12:20,864
It's so... it's so Mike, you know.

1459
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:23,116
You can't just go out
and get a shitty job.

1460
01:12:23,116 --> 01:12:24,617
You gotta... you gotta get a...

1461
01:12:24,617 --> 01:12:25,618
A dream job?

1462
01:12:25,618 --> 01:12:26,953
Yeah, a dream job.

1463
01:12:26,953 --> 01:12:29,956
Well, why shouldn't your
dream guy have a dream job?

1464
01:12:29,956 --> 01:12:31,958
...the ambitious plans of many opponents

1465
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:34,961
On the County Board of Supervisors...

1466
01:12:42,469 --> 01:12:44,804
Come here, I have a job for you.

1467
01:12:56,316 --> 01:12:58,401
What the fuck is taking so long?

1468
01:12:58,401 --> 01:12:59,986
I knew this shit would happen.

1469
01:12:59,986 --> 01:13:01,321
She hates my ass.

1470
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:03,656
She's not going to let him go.

1471
01:13:03,656 --> 01:13:05,492
Go knock.

1472
01:13:07,118 --> 01:13:09,704
Dude, go knock.

1473
01:13:09,704 --> 01:13:14,167
Bro, drag his fucking ass out of there.

1474
01:13:21,341 --> 01:13:22,842
Yo, Miguel.

1475
01:13:25,345 --> 01:13:26,345
Hey.

1476
01:13:27,847 --> 01:13:30,767
Mike, hurry up.

1477
01:13:32,519 --> 01:13:33,853
Hey.

1478
01:13:33,853 --> 01:13:35,688
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

1479
01:13:35,688 --> 01:13:37,107
Come on, dude.

1480
01:13:37,107 --> 01:13:39,192
Dog, I'm tearin' it up, man.

1481
01:13:39,192 --> 01:13:41,569
I'm hittin' it, bro.
It's been a few days.

1482
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:44,280
You guys just go ahead,
man. I'm gonna chill.

1483
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,698
What?

1484
01:13:45,698 --> 01:13:48,201
I'm just gonna kick
it here with the woman.

1485
01:13:48,201 --> 01:13:50,870
You said you'd go, man.

1486
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,497
Your woman's in your head.

1487
01:13:52,497 --> 01:13:53,540
That's wrong.

1488
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,874
She's got your nuts, bro.

1489
01:13:54,874 --> 01:13:56,793
Dog, dog...

1490
01:13:56,793 --> 01:13:59,796
Sylvia's all happy 'cause I
got a job, all right, dude?

1491
01:13:59,796 --> 01:14:01,714
She wants us to fuckin' chill together.

1492
01:14:01,714 --> 01:14:05,301
Man, that girl put the zap on your head.

1493
01:14:05,301 --> 01:14:06,970
This is our last chance to hang.

1494
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:10,306
You're like my brother. Yeah.

1495
01:14:10,306 --> 01:14:11,975
You're all I got. You're
gonna dog me like that?

1496
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:13,351
I ain't no fucking do...

1497
01:14:13,351 --> 01:14:15,562
How are you, baby?

1498
01:14:15,562 --> 01:14:17,730
Hey, Sylvia, he's going to Mexico.

1499
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:21,109
No, he isn't, Jim. Yes, he is.

1500
01:14:21,109 --> 01:14:25,155
I'm joining the feds. I'm
gone, I'm out of here next week.

1501
01:14:25,155 --> 01:14:26,739
The least you can do

1502
01:14:26,739 --> 01:14:28,158
Is let my best friend

1503
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:29,492
See me off.

1504
01:14:29,492 --> 01:14:30,660
Baby, it's not safe.

1505
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,120
All you're going to do is drink.

1506
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,164
Aw, fuck, man.

1507
01:14:34,164 --> 01:14:35,915
Mike, come on.

1508
01:14:35,915 --> 01:14:37,792
Come on, fuck, man!

1509
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:39,586
Come on, you promised.

1510
01:14:39,586 --> 01:14:41,171
You promised, man.

1511
01:14:41,171 --> 01:14:46,342
Yo... I promised, Sylvia, okay?

1512
01:14:46,342 --> 01:14:48,261
Mike, you're not going to Mexico.

1513
01:14:48,261 --> 01:14:50,013
What?

1514
01:14:50,013 --> 01:14:51,598
You're not going.

1515
01:14:51,598 --> 01:14:54,767
I'm not your fucking puppet, Sylvia.

1516
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:57,145
All right, you know
what, do what you want.

1517
01:14:57,145 --> 01:14:59,439
But I'm not going to be
here when you get back.

1518
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:00,690
That's fucked up.

1519
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,692
Why you got to lay that bullshit on him?

1520
01:15:02,692 --> 01:15:04,611
Because I don't want
him going with you, Jim.

1521
01:15:04,611 --> 01:15:06,696
You're fucking nuts.

1522
01:15:06,696 --> 01:15:08,948
You're crazy and you're dangerous,

1523
01:15:08,948 --> 01:15:10,950
And my biggest nightmare
is you with a fucking badge.

1524
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:12,452
You're the last person
who should have one.

1525
01:15:12,452 --> 01:15:13,453
Yeah? Yeah.

1526
01:15:13,453 --> 01:15:14,621
That's not bullshit, it's the truth.

1527
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:15,914
Fuck this!

1528
01:15:15,914 --> 01:15:17,040
Whoa, wait.

1529
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,541
Whatever, man.

1530
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:21,127
Fuckin' thanks, homie!

1531
01:15:21,127 --> 01:15:22,212
Yeah, laters.

1532
01:15:22,212 --> 01:15:23,212
Bye.

1533
01:15:24,714 --> 01:15:26,049
Yo, yo.

1534
01:15:26,049 --> 01:15:27,383
I'm going.

1535
01:15:28,802 --> 01:15:29,803
I gotta go.

1536
01:15:29,803 --> 01:15:31,471
Get the fuck out of here, go!

1537
01:15:32,806 --> 01:15:33,556
Go!

1538
01:15:33,556 --> 01:15:35,308
Fuck this shit, man.

1539
01:15:35,308 --> 01:15:36,643
Good night, Sylvia.

1540
01:15:36,643 --> 01:15:37,811
Kiss my ass, Jim.

1541
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:39,854
Oh, any time, sellout.

1542
01:15:39,854 --> 01:15:42,524
Oh, you going to be
happy once he's dead? Huh?

1543
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:52,826
Hey, Toussaint.

1544
01:15:52,826 --> 01:15:54,494
I heard the battle, man.

1545
01:15:54,494 --> 01:15:56,830
Yo, your lady didn't
want you going, huh?

1546
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:58,331
No, but I'm going.

1547
01:15:58,331 --> 01:15:59,833
Hell, yeah. Shit.

1548
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,417
I'm a motherfucking man. That's right.

1549
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:03,503
Shit. I walk the Earth at will.

1550
01:16:03,503 --> 01:16:05,463
Damn right. I do
whatever the fuck I want.

1551
01:16:05,463 --> 01:16:06,506
You know, we're men, right?

1552
01:16:06,506 --> 01:16:07,757
We're men, right? That's right.

1553
01:16:07,757 --> 01:16:09,092
That's what we do, right?

1554
01:16:09,092 --> 01:16:10,760
Amen. And
don't worry--

1555
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,012
Home girl will be right there
waiting when you get back.

1556
01:16:13,012 --> 01:16:14,180
You're right. You're right.

1557
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:15,390
She wouldn't play that shit like that.

1558
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:16,850
Shit, I got a fucking job for real.

1559
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:17,767
You did.

1560
01:16:17,767 --> 01:16:19,269
Plus you're my homie,
dog. You're my homie.

1561
01:16:19,269 --> 01:16:20,937
You're going to go fucking do your thing

1562
01:16:20,937 --> 01:16:22,772
And this is it. No, shit, dude.

1563
01:16:22,772 --> 01:16:23,857
Yo, we're all dogs.

1564
01:16:23,857 --> 01:16:25,191
I got you guys back, man.

1565
01:16:25,191 --> 01:16:26,276
No doubt, no doubt.

1566
01:16:26,276 --> 01:16:28,027
It's just going to be fucking cool, yo.

1567
01:16:28,027 --> 01:16:29,779
I got a job, you got a job.

1568
01:16:29,779 --> 01:16:31,281
Shit, I got some bud.

1569
01:16:31,281 --> 01:16:32,699
We got some smokes. We got some

1570
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:34,451
Motherfucking money.
We are on a mission.

1571
01:16:34,451 --> 01:16:37,454
Let's get our heads together
so we can achieve our objective

1572
01:16:37,454 --> 01:16:38,621
In a timely manner.

1573
01:16:38,621 --> 01:16:41,207
Let's get deployed, people.

1574
01:17:06,441 --> 01:17:08,526
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1575
01:17:08,526 --> 01:17:09,652
Rise and fucking shine.

1576
01:17:09,652 --> 01:17:12,197
Come on, ladies. Chow time.

1577
01:17:12,197 --> 01:17:13,406
Chow's getting cold.

1578
01:17:13,406 --> 01:17:16,493
Oh, what the fuck, Jim? Chill, dude.

1579
01:17:32,008 --> 01:17:33,593
Dude, where are we?

1580
01:17:33,593 --> 01:17:36,638
Family, man.

1581
01:17:36,638 --> 01:17:38,223
Damn! It's a shizzack...

1582
01:17:38,223 --> 01:17:39,265
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1583
01:17:39,265 --> 01:17:41,768
It's a home, all right?

1584
01:17:41,768 --> 01:17:43,978
Respect, bro.

1585
01:17:43,978 --> 01:17:45,855
Straighten up, fellas.

1586
01:17:49,275 --> 01:17:51,194
My old lady, Marta.

1587
01:17:51,194 --> 01:17:52,195
<i>Hola.</i>

1588
01:17:52,195 --> 01:17:53,363
<i>Mike. Hola, mucho gusto.</i>

1589
01:17:53,363 --> 01:17:54,906
<i>Hola, Mike. Toussaint.</i>

1590
01:17:54,906 --> 01:17:56,366
<i>Hola. Hola. Hola.</i>

1591
01:17:56,366 --> 01:17:58,034
<i>Hola. Marisa.</i>

1592
01:17:58,034 --> 01:17:59,119
<i>Buenos dias. Mi mama.</i>

1593
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:00,120
<i>Mucho gusto. Marta's mom.</i>

1594
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,122
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

1595
01:18:02,122 --> 01:18:03,456
Vicki. Vicki.

1596
01:18:03,456 --> 01:18:05,375
<i>La prima, esa es mi prima.</i>

1597
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:06,543
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

1598
01:18:06,543 --> 01:18:07,794
<i>Mucho gusto. Mike. Vicki.</i>

1599
01:18:07,794 --> 01:18:09,504
Toussaint.

1600
01:18:09,504 --> 01:18:10,713
Vicki.

1601
01:18:10,713 --> 01:18:12,215
Okay.

1602
01:18:12,215 --> 01:18:13,800
Hey, grab yourselves a rock.

1603
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,552
<i>Sí, por favor, sientense.</i>

1604
01:18:17,887 --> 01:18:18,888
Vicki?

1605
01:18:18,888 --> 01:18:20,557
<i>¿Café, quieren café?</i>

1606
01:18:20,557 --> 01:18:22,559
<i>Sí, café, por favor. Vicki, andale.</i>

1607
01:18:22,559 --> 01:18:24,811
<i>Tranquila, baby.</i>

1608
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,982
¡Mama!

1609
01:18:28,982 --> 01:18:31,151
Yeah, w-What's she saying, dude?

1610
01:18:31,151 --> 01:18:33,236
Oh, they... they think you're cool.

1611
01:18:33,236 --> 01:18:34,404
Oh, sweet.

1612
01:18:36,739 --> 01:18:38,575
<i>Aquí tienes. Gracias.</i>

1613
01:18:38,575 --> 01:18:40,910
<i>Caliente. Thank you.</i>

1614
01:18:44,747 --> 01:18:45,957
Dude...

1615
01:18:45,957 --> 01:18:47,417
Marta's fine as fuck, bro.

1616
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:48,626
Hey, hey, hey...

1617
01:18:48,626 --> 01:18:50,712
I'm just saying, dude.
You need to marry her, bro.

1618
01:18:50,712 --> 01:18:53,089
If you don't, you're a fool.

1619
01:18:53,089 --> 01:18:55,258
<i>¿Que dice?</i>

1620
01:18:55,258 --> 01:18:56,508
Oh...

1621
01:18:58,261 --> 01:19:00,346
Oh, that shit's good, man.

1622
01:19:00,346 --> 01:19:02,932
No shit, you know they got that
good fucking weed from here.

1623
01:19:02,932 --> 01:19:05,852
That's what I want.
Some of that good shit.

1624
01:19:05,852 --> 01:19:08,271
You know where some fields
are or something, Jim?

1625
01:19:08,271 --> 01:19:10,857
Yeah, that's not... I want to
see, like, where they grow it.

1626
01:19:10,857 --> 01:19:12,025
You know, and then maybe

1627
01:19:12,025 --> 01:19:14,152
They'll let us go out
and, like, pick some.

1628
01:19:14,152 --> 01:19:16,279
You know, pick some of
that really good weed.

1629
01:19:26,956 --> 01:19:28,124
Shit.

1630
01:19:33,546 --> 01:19:34,547
Toussaint?

1631
01:19:39,385 --> 01:19:41,387
This is nice.

1632
01:19:41,387 --> 01:19:43,723
This is beautiful, man.

1633
01:19:43,723 --> 01:19:44,891
Dog, you see this?

1634
01:19:44,891 --> 01:19:46,141
Here.

1635
01:19:48,603 --> 01:19:49,604
Mmm...

1636
01:19:49,604 --> 01:19:50,814
Beautiful...

1637
01:19:50,814 --> 01:19:52,065
Man!

1638
01:19:52,065 --> 01:19:53,566
Mmm!

1639
01:19:53,566 --> 01:19:55,652
<i>When the hell'd you
get all the pistos, dog?</i>

1640
01:19:55,652 --> 01:19:56,945
<i>Mexico, man.</i>

1641
01:19:56,945 --> 01:19:57,987
It's magic.

1642
01:20:02,242 --> 01:20:03,326
He bleed?

1643
01:20:03,326 --> 01:20:04,327
Like a stuffed pig.

1644
01:20:05,495 --> 01:20:07,330
How'd Letty know you were
tearing up her sister?

1645
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:09,916
That fuckin' bitch Patti, right?

1646
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:11,584
Ah... I took her to dinner.

1647
01:20:11,584 --> 01:20:13,920
Took her for a cruise
up to Malibu, you know?

1648
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,673
Got up all in it. Back of my ride...

1649
01:20:16,673 --> 01:20:18,341
Pounded that fish, man.

1650
01:20:18,341 --> 01:20:19,759
Good fuckin' fish.

1651
01:20:19,759 --> 01:20:20,885
I figured the crazy broad

1652
01:20:20,885 --> 01:20:22,262
Pulled out some hairs and pubes

1653
01:20:22,262 --> 01:20:24,013
And stashed it in the seat, you know?

1654
01:20:24,013 --> 01:20:26,641
Oh, dude, you got to
watch that shit, man.

1655
01:20:26,641 --> 01:20:28,935
Chicks get treacherous.

1656
01:20:28,935 --> 01:20:31,604
Yeah, no shit. Sibling rivalry, Jim.

1657
01:20:31,604 --> 01:20:33,022
Next day,

1658
01:20:33,022 --> 01:20:35,483
I'm driving around with
Letty all kick back and shit,

1659
01:20:35,483 --> 01:20:38,862
And she radars in on
this rat's nest, man.

1660
01:20:38,862 --> 01:20:41,698
Pulls out these long-Ass hairs,
she's like "What are these?"

1661
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:42,699
"Whose are these?"

1662
01:20:44,284 --> 01:20:47,287
She sees all the pubes mixed
in, man... fuckin' busted.

1663
01:20:47,287 --> 01:20:49,289
Busted! Busted!

1664
01:20:49,289 --> 01:20:50,623
Oh!

1665
01:20:50,623 --> 01:20:52,959
Dude, how'd she know
they were her sister's?

1666
01:20:52,959 --> 01:20:54,461
Oh, come on, dude.

1667
01:20:54,461 --> 01:20:56,045
Mexican chick voodoo, right, Mike?

1668
01:20:56,045 --> 01:20:57,630
You know, live and learn.

1669
01:20:57,630 --> 01:21:00,133
Yep, next time you'll
be all up in your ride

1670
01:21:00,133 --> 01:21:01,968
With the Super Vac, dude. Treachery!

1671
01:21:01,968 --> 01:21:04,053
Yep, treachery.

1672
01:21:10,059 --> 01:21:12,145
Um...

1673
01:21:12,145 --> 01:21:13,897
Shouldn't we be

1674
01:21:13,897 --> 01:21:15,106
Helping them?

1675
01:21:15,106 --> 01:21:16,649
You know how to hand wash?

1676
01:21:16,649 --> 01:21:18,234
No. Then don't sweat it.

1677
01:21:18,234 --> 01:21:19,319
Yeah, we're men.

1678
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:20,904
They know we don't do that shit.

1679
01:21:20,904 --> 01:21:21,905
That's right.

1680
01:21:21,905 --> 01:21:23,323
We're men.

1681
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:26,493
Oh, yeah!

1682
01:21:29,704 --> 01:21:30,914
This is paradise, huh?

1683
01:21:30,914 --> 01:21:32,332
Mm-Hmm.

1684
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:35,752
Yo, Mike?

1685
01:21:35,752 --> 01:21:37,253
Yeah?

1686
01:21:37,253 --> 01:21:38,546
They're sending me to Colombia.

1687
01:21:44,177 --> 01:21:46,930
Colombia.

1688
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:48,598
Who, the man?

1689
01:21:48,598 --> 01:21:49,598
Yep.

1690
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,769
They're tearing shit up down
there, they need my help.

1691
01:21:52,769 --> 01:21:54,687
Doing what?

1692
01:21:54,687 --> 01:21:56,606
Busting up drug labs and drug lords

1693
01:21:56,606 --> 01:21:58,274
And all that shit. You got it.

1694
01:21:58,274 --> 01:22:00,777
Gonna be an advisor, you
know-- Shoot him, him and him.

1695
01:22:00,777 --> 01:22:02,946
Then it's back to the
barracks for bitches and beer.

1696
01:22:02,946 --> 01:22:04,864
I'm set.

1697
01:22:04,864 --> 01:22:07,033
Why do you want to do that shit, dude?

1698
01:22:07,033 --> 01:22:08,618
I mean...

1699
01:22:08,618 --> 01:22:11,996
What about Marta, you know?

1700
01:22:11,996 --> 01:22:13,039
I mean...

1701
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:15,041
Ain't gonna happen.

1702
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:17,544
They told me not to get married.

1703
01:22:17,544 --> 01:22:19,462
That's messed.

1704
01:22:19,462 --> 01:22:20,547
They really told you that?

1705
01:22:20,547 --> 01:22:22,340
Not straight up, but I heard 'em.

1706
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:25,218
Yo, if the feds won't let you
hook up with your old lady,

1707
01:22:25,218 --> 01:22:26,886
You need to tell them to fuck off.

1708
01:22:26,886 --> 01:22:28,388
Yeah, I mean,

1709
01:22:28,388 --> 01:22:31,057
You love her, she loves you, right?

1710
01:22:31,057 --> 01:22:33,726
Dude, you need to move
down here, marry Marta,

1711
01:22:33,726 --> 01:22:35,228
You know, get a good-Ass job

1712
01:22:35,228 --> 01:22:37,897
Working with fucking
tourists or something.

1713
01:22:37,897 --> 01:22:39,315
Fuck that.

1714
01:22:39,315 --> 01:22:41,609
Taking bucket baths in cold-Ass water?

1715
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:43,486
You know, wading around
in ankle-Deep mud?

1716
01:22:43,486 --> 01:22:44,487
Outhouses, man!

1717
01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:46,489
Fuckin' outhouses!

1718
01:22:46,489 --> 01:22:48,575
You told Marta yet?

1719
01:22:52,495 --> 01:22:54,122
You love this place.

1720
01:22:54,122 --> 01:22:57,417
It's in your eyes, man.

1721
01:22:57,417 --> 01:22:59,919
Dude, this is what it's all about.

1722
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:04,174
You got a woman that loves
you and a place to stay.

1723
01:23:04,174 --> 01:23:05,842
You'd be happy here, and you know it.

1724
01:23:05,842 --> 01:23:10,180
Yeah, well, shacking up with Marta,

1725
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:15,351
Squeezing out some puppies,
has its appeal, but...

1726
01:23:15,351 --> 01:23:18,688
This is my career.

1727
01:23:18,688 --> 01:23:20,732
I got one shot.

1728
01:23:20,732 --> 01:23:22,317
You're making a mistake.

1729
01:23:22,317 --> 01:23:27,113
You should stay right
here with your lady.

1730
01:23:27,113 --> 01:23:28,573
What the fuck you gonna do

1731
01:23:28,573 --> 01:23:30,450
In Colombia?

1732
01:23:32,702 --> 01:23:34,621
Whack people,

1733
01:23:34,621 --> 01:23:35,872
Program shit.

1734
01:23:35,872 --> 01:23:38,541
You ain't down, fuck you.

1735
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:40,460
Bring in my gunships

1736
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:43,546
And smoke your little
jungle hideaway. You know?

1737
01:23:43,546 --> 01:23:45,256
I mean, I'm a solider
of the apocalypse, man.

1738
01:23:45,256 --> 01:23:46,466
I'll be in a chopper,

1739
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:50,220
Door-Gunning villagers
and shit. Fuck 'em.

1740
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:53,097
Kill the chickens and dogs, too, man.

1741
01:23:54,474 --> 01:23:56,976
I don't give a fuck.

1742
01:24:08,905 --> 01:24:09,989
Shh, shh...

1743
01:24:30,635 --> 01:24:31,761
Yeah.

1744
01:26:02,102 --> 01:26:03,186
Doce años.

1745
01:26:03,186 --> 01:26:04,854
Doce años. Doce años...

1746
01:26:04,854 --> 01:26:07,065
Doce... we've been together that long.

1747
01:26:07,065 --> 01:26:08,358
<i>Es muy bonita.</i>

1748
01:26:08,358 --> 01:26:09,734
Man, you're bring sand
to the beach, dumb ass.

1749
01:26:09,734 --> 01:26:12,028
Cover that shit up. Jim, dude!

1750
01:26:12,028 --> 01:26:13,196
Huh?

1751
01:26:13,196 --> 01:26:15,698
How you say, um, "You're
beautiful" in Spanish?

1752
01:26:15,698 --> 01:26:17,283
<i>Huh? "Bonita." Bonita.</i>

1753
01:26:19,702 --> 01:26:21,955
Come on, you don't know
that shit, Toussaint?

1754
01:26:21,955 --> 01:26:23,748
<i>Tu... bonita.</i>

1755
01:26:23,748 --> 01:26:24,874
<i>Gracias.</i>

1756
01:26:24,874 --> 01:26:26,417
Hey, baby, see my new one?

1757
01:26:26,417 --> 01:26:27,794
Right, did I get it? Huh?

1758
01:26:27,794 --> 01:26:29,045
Think I got it?

1759
01:26:29,045 --> 01:26:32,215
Yeah, she got the point.

1760
01:26:35,385 --> 01:26:38,805
Yo, Mike, that chick digs you.

1761
01:26:38,805 --> 01:26:40,640
What chick?

1762
01:26:42,225 --> 01:26:44,227
Oh, she's good, dog.

1763
01:26:44,227 --> 01:26:46,479
Yeah, name's Lila.

1764
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:48,565
She's a freak. She'll fuck you, dude.

1765
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:51,818
She's a freak, huh?

1766
01:26:51,818 --> 01:26:53,486
How you know? You fuck her?

1767
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:55,572
No, out of respect for Marta.

1768
01:26:55,572 --> 01:26:58,741
Not that I don't want... Hey, baby.

1769
01:26:58,741 --> 01:27:02,287
Ask her to dance.

1770
01:27:02,287 --> 01:27:04,456
I'm not cheating on Sylvia, dude.

1771
01:27:06,249 --> 01:27:09,502
There's a big gap between
dancing and fucking, man.

1772
01:27:09,502 --> 01:27:11,421
Go explore it.

1773
01:27:12,589 --> 01:27:14,257
No shit.

1774
01:30:03,259 --> 01:30:04,009
No.

1775
01:30:16,356 --> 01:30:17,941
You're fucking nuts.

1776
01:31:24,757 --> 01:31:26,926
You fucked up, woman.

1777
01:31:28,595 --> 01:31:30,597
I'll do it.

1778
01:31:35,769 --> 01:31:37,270
It's easy.

1779
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:55,370
Jim!

1780
01:32:22,482 --> 01:32:24,484
What's up, man, huh?

1781
01:32:24,484 --> 01:32:25,985
Where's Toussaint?

1782
01:32:25,985 --> 01:32:27,487
He's dancing.

1783
01:32:27,487 --> 01:32:28,488
Yeah? Yeah.

1784
01:32:28,488 --> 01:32:29,489
You gonna get back

1785
01:32:29,489 --> 01:32:30,657
To the party? Yeah.

1786
01:32:30,657 --> 01:32:32,909
Let's get back to the party, man.

1787
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:36,246
Yeah. Hey, uh, go,

1788
01:32:36,246 --> 01:32:37,914
Go tell Toussaint that

1789
01:32:37,914 --> 01:32:39,499
We're gonna get the
fuck out of here, man.

1790
01:32:39,499 --> 01:32:41,167
Just go into the party,
tell him we're gonna go.

1791
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:42,168
We're leaving, huh?

1792
01:32:42,168 --> 01:32:43,670
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna leave.

1793
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:45,338
Let's go, yeah?

1794
01:32:45,338 --> 01:32:46,506
Yeah, let's go.

1795
01:32:46,506 --> 01:32:47,924
Go ahead, go get Toussaint, man.

1796
01:32:47,924 --> 01:32:49,008
Go get him.

1797
01:32:56,766 --> 01:32:58,601
Hey, we're going.

1798
01:32:58,601 --> 01:32:59,602
Come on.

1799
01:32:59,602 --> 01:33:00,603
Fuck you, dude.

1800
01:33:00,603 --> 01:33:02,605
I'm having a great time, bro.

1801
01:33:02,605 --> 01:33:04,691
Then walk back to L.A., motherfucker.

1802
01:33:04,691 --> 01:33:06,192
You're in the car or not.

1803
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,198
He's fucking crazy, man. What the fuck!

1804
01:33:12,198 --> 01:33:15,201
All right, let's go, man.

1805
01:33:16,953 --> 01:33:19,456
Hey, yo, what the fuck
is your problem, psycho?!

1806
01:33:19,456 --> 01:33:21,207
Hey, hey, homeboy's
losing it, all right?

1807
01:33:21,207 --> 01:33:24,210
Shut the fuck up and just
get in the car, all right?

1808
01:33:24,210 --> 01:33:25,295
Fucking bullshit!

1809
01:33:27,797 --> 01:33:29,132
Fucked up!

1810
01:33:58,161 --> 01:34:01,581
Dude, dude... dude, slow down.

1811
01:34:05,001 --> 01:34:06,503
Fuck, man.

1812
01:34:06,503 --> 01:34:10,173
Whoo, yeah, man.

1813
01:34:10,173 --> 01:34:11,841
Slow down, you crazy motherfucker!

1814
01:34:11,841 --> 01:34:14,594
I want a cop to pull me over.

1815
01:34:16,179 --> 01:34:18,431
Treachery.

1816
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:20,350
Fucking treachery.

1817
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:22,685
Jim, slow down!

1818
01:34:22,685 --> 01:34:23,853
Shut up!

1819
01:34:25,021 --> 01:34:26,439
Fuck, dude.

1820
01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:29,442
Only female I trust.

1821
01:34:31,528 --> 01:34:33,363
Fuck you, God!

1822
01:34:33,363 --> 01:34:36,950
You ain't got the fucking
balls to take my ass.

1823
01:34:38,535 --> 01:34:42,038
Jim, don't say that shit, dude.

1824
01:34:57,137 --> 01:34:58,304
Jim!

1825
01:35:01,307 --> 01:35:04,894
Dude, you are getting
out of control, okay?

1826
01:35:04,894 --> 01:35:07,480
You need psychiatric help, man.

1827
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:10,817
You're seriously fucked up, dude.

1828
01:35:10,817 --> 01:35:16,322
All right, you need to sue
the military or something.

1829
01:35:16,322 --> 01:35:18,074
You used to be mellow.

1830
01:35:21,411 --> 01:35:22,662
Later, homie.

1831
01:35:22,662 --> 01:35:24,497
'Night, dog.

1832
01:35:24,497 --> 01:35:25,337
Laters.

1833
01:35:26,749 --> 01:35:28,751
Dude, I ain't hanging around you anymore

1834
01:35:28,751 --> 01:35:30,086
Until you get some fucking help.

1835
01:35:30,086 --> 01:35:32,839
You can 12-Step off, bitch.

1836
01:35:32,839 --> 01:35:35,175
You're dismissed.

1837
01:35:47,937 --> 01:35:49,689
He's right, dude.

1838
01:35:49,689 --> 01:35:50,774
Yeah.

1839
01:35:53,693 --> 01:35:56,196
Georgia will get me squared away.

1840
01:35:56,196 --> 01:35:57,156
Hope so.

1841
01:35:59,115 --> 01:36:02,619
What was that shit with Marta, dude?

1842
01:36:02,619 --> 01:36:07,373
I don't know why that happened.

1843
01:36:09,542 --> 01:36:11,628
But I'm cool. I'm cool now.

1844
01:36:11,628 --> 01:36:13,546
Okay?

1845
01:36:15,465 --> 01:36:16,466
Yeah.

1846
01:36:16,466 --> 01:36:18,134
I'm cool.

1847
01:36:29,229 --> 01:36:31,564
Look, dude, she told
me she was pregnant.

1848
01:36:31,564 --> 01:36:33,316
I had a panic attack.

1849
01:36:33,316 --> 01:36:34,484
I pulled my gun.

1850
01:36:34,484 --> 01:36:35,735
Come on, dog,

1851
01:36:35,735 --> 01:36:37,487
I thought you loved her, dude.

1852
01:36:37,487 --> 01:36:38,737
I do.

1853
01:36:40,073 --> 01:36:42,158
God, fuck.

1854
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:44,911
Come on, man, let's
go drop off that bud.

1855
01:36:48,331 --> 01:36:49,582
What bud?

1856
01:36:49,582 --> 01:36:52,502
There's 20 kilos in the trunk.

1857
01:36:52,502 --> 01:36:53,837
Say that again?

1858
01:36:53,837 --> 01:36:56,005
There's 20 kilos in the trunk, man.

1859
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:58,925
Of weed? Yeah.

1860
01:36:58,925 --> 01:37:00,260
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1861
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:01,761
I picked it up at the party.

1862
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:04,097
I'm dropping it at Casper's.

1863
01:37:04,097 --> 01:37:05,765
Casper's?

1864
01:37:05,765 --> 01:37:07,600
I get three Gs.

1865
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,687
We get three Gs.

1866
01:37:10,687 --> 01:37:12,272
You drove it across the border?

1867
01:37:12,272 --> 01:37:14,441
Yeah.

1868
01:37:14,441 --> 01:37:15,775
What if they would've caught us?

1869
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:17,610
Couldn't happen, man.

1870
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:21,197
My shit is on fire right now, man.

1871
01:37:21,197 --> 01:37:23,867
My shit is wired right now, man.

1872
01:37:23,867 --> 01:37:26,035
You risked my ass without telling me?

1873
01:37:26,035 --> 01:37:28,872
That's not cool, man.
For three fucking Gs?

1874
01:37:28,872 --> 01:37:31,624
That's... that's a good
rate for transporting that.

1875
01:37:31,624 --> 01:37:33,626
Shit, if I'd told you,

1876
01:37:33,626 --> 01:37:34,794
You would have gotten

1877
01:37:34,794 --> 01:37:37,464
All fucking hinkey at the
border, man, gotten us nabbed.

1878
01:37:37,464 --> 01:37:39,466
I wouldn't have been in
the fucking car, dude!

1879
01:37:39,466 --> 01:37:41,885
I would've been on
motherfucking Greyhound.

1880
01:37:41,885 --> 01:37:43,887
That's a serious breach
of the homie code, man,

1881
01:37:43,887 --> 01:37:45,555
Not fuckin' telling me.

1882
01:37:45,555 --> 01:37:48,224
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry, you know.

1883
01:37:48,224 --> 01:37:50,560
I should've had... I
should've got you guys,

1884
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,145
You know, walk across the border.

1885
01:37:52,145 --> 01:37:53,646
I could've met you somewhere.

1886
01:37:53,646 --> 01:37:55,815
But, you know, I got bills, I got shit.

1887
01:37:55,815 --> 01:37:57,150
I gotta put my shit in storage.

1888
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:59,486
I gotta get gas out to Georgia.

1889
01:37:59,486 --> 01:38:01,488
Oh, fuck your money woes, dog!

1890
01:38:01,488 --> 01:38:03,573
I am not catching a
fuckin' case for you.

1891
01:38:03,573 --> 01:38:05,575
Let me out of the fucking car right now.

1892
01:38:05,575 --> 01:38:07,160
Fuck, man. Come on, man,
let's drop this shit off.

1893
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:08,161
Let's get paid!

1894
01:38:08,161 --> 01:38:09,662
Let me out right here.

1895
01:38:09,662 --> 01:38:11,164
Mi-Mi-Mi-Mike!
Listen, listen!

1896
01:38:11,164 --> 01:38:12,499
Let me out right here, right now!

1897
01:38:12,499 --> 01:38:14,501
You will feel so much better
with a fistful of twenties.

1898
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:16,169
Huh?

1899
01:38:17,253 --> 01:38:19,756
Dude, we're drunk,

1900
01:38:19,756 --> 01:38:22,425
And we got a trunk full of
fuckin' weed, dude, I am not...

1901
01:38:22,425 --> 01:38:25,011
Okay, fuckin', Mike,
don't bitch out on me!

1902
01:38:25,011 --> 01:38:28,181
Don't fucking bitch out on me!

1903
01:38:28,181 --> 01:38:29,682
I am still on probation, dick head.

1904
01:38:29,682 --> 01:38:31,267
Let me out now!

1905
01:38:31,267 --> 01:38:32,519
Let me out right here
right fuckin' now, dude!

1906
01:38:32,519 --> 01:38:34,270
Let me get paid, will you?

1907
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:35,772
Will you fuckin' let me get paid?!

1908
01:38:35,772 --> 01:38:36,856
Oh, yo, get paid, man.

1909
01:38:36,856 --> 01:38:38,942
Fuckin' go for it, all right?

1910
01:38:38,942 --> 01:38:41,444
Just let me get the fuck out.
I don't give a fuck, dude.

1911
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:47,784
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1912
01:38:49,035 --> 01:38:51,287
What the fuck are you doing, Jim?

1913
01:38:51,287 --> 01:38:52,872
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1914
01:38:52,872 --> 01:38:54,040
Fuck you!

1915
01:39:01,047 --> 01:39:03,883
Fuck, I'm sorry, dude,

1916
01:39:03,883 --> 01:39:04,968
I'm sorry, dude.

1917
01:39:04,968 --> 01:39:07,053
Okay? I'm sorry.

1918
01:39:07,053 --> 01:39:09,389
Why the fuck did you
put a gun to my head?

1919
01:39:09,389 --> 01:39:10,389
Huh?

1920
01:39:12,225 --> 01:39:13,560
You gonna shoot me?

1921
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,312
No, man. I'm sorry. I was trippin'.

1922
01:39:16,312 --> 01:39:17,752
I'd never...

1923
01:39:20,567 --> 01:39:23,736
I'd never put a fuckin'
gun to your head, dude

1924
01:39:23,736 --> 01:39:24,904
I know.

1925
01:39:24,904 --> 01:39:27,407
I know you wouldn't, man. I'm sorry.

1926
01:39:27,407 --> 01:39:29,909
First your lady, now me,
man. What the fuck is up?

1927
01:39:29,909 --> 01:39:31,911
I'm not thinking.

1928
01:39:31,911 --> 01:39:33,413
I got too much shit going on.

1929
01:39:37,167 --> 01:39:40,587
Oh, fuck, I'm just
faded, man, that's all.

1930
01:39:40,587 --> 01:39:42,589
I'm just fuckin' fade right now, okay?

1931
01:39:42,589 --> 01:39:44,174
I'll cruise you by your pad.

1932
01:39:44,174 --> 01:39:45,341
I'll drop you off, man.

1933
01:39:45,341 --> 01:39:46,509
I'm sorry.

1934
01:39:46,509 --> 01:39:47,677
I'm sorry.

1935
01:39:47,677 --> 01:39:50,263
Yeah. You're a fuck-Up.

1936
01:39:52,599 --> 01:39:56,269
I'm going with you so you
don't fuck this shit up, too.

1937
01:39:56,269 --> 01:40:00,857
We'll go to Casper's... get the money.

1938
01:40:00,857 --> 01:40:01,858
Yeah.

1939
01:40:01,858 --> 01:40:03,359
Then you can drop me off home,

1940
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:06,196
You can go to Georgia fed
out and be the fuckin' man.

1941
01:40:06,196 --> 01:40:09,699
Yeah, I'm gonna be the fucking man.

1942
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:11,284
I can drop you off, you know.

1943
01:40:11,284 --> 01:40:13,036
Take you up the hill.

1944
01:40:13,036 --> 01:40:14,454
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1945
01:40:14,454 --> 01:40:15,204
No.

1946
01:40:17,457 --> 01:40:20,960
Keep on going.

1947
01:40:28,301 --> 01:40:29,302
Looks sketchy.

1948
01:40:29,302 --> 01:40:31,387
I don't know.

1949
01:40:35,558 --> 01:40:37,727
Ho, what, you gonna shoot their pigeons?

1950
01:40:37,727 --> 01:40:38,895
Yeah.

1951
01:40:38,895 --> 01:40:40,230
Just hurry up.

1952
01:40:53,076 --> 01:40:54,494
Yo, Casper!

1953
01:40:59,082 --> 01:41:00,583
<i>Buenos noches, señor.</i>

<i>¿Tiene losé cosatles?</i>

1955
01:41:03,586 --> 01:41:04,838
Go pop the trunk, dude.

1956
01:41:14,264 --> 01:41:15,932
<i>Con permiso.</i>

1957
01:41:37,537 --> 01:41:39,122
What's up, Casper?

1958
01:41:39,122 --> 01:41:40,206
What up, Jim?

1959
01:41:40,206 --> 01:41:43,376
What's crackin', man.

1960
01:41:43,376 --> 01:41:44,878
Is that you, Mike?

1961
01:41:44,878 --> 01:41:45,795

Yo, Casper. What up, dog?

1965
01:41:49,549 --> 01:41:51,134
Hope so.

1966
01:41:51,134 --> 01:41:52,552
Gonna find out tonight.

1967
01:41:53,803 --> 01:41:54,971
So whass up with your brother, dog?

1968
01:41:54,971 --> 01:41:56,139

<i>Got blasted by the
hulas awhile back, ese.</i>

1970
01:41:57,724 --> 01:41:59,142
Damn.

1971
01:41:59,142 --> 01:42:01,144
Sorry to hear that, dog.

1972
01:42:01,144 --> 01:42:02,562
You play, you pay.

1973
01:42:02,562 --> 01:42:03,897
He knew what time it was.

1974
01:42:03,897 --> 01:42:05,648
Right.

1975
01:42:05,648 --> 01:42:07,317
Hey, we gotta bounce.

1976
01:42:07,317 --> 01:42:08,651
You got the money?

1977
01:42:08,651 --> 01:42:10,987
Yeah, just let me check the shit, okay?

1978
01:42:13,156 --> 01:42:15,325
Yo, bring the feria, homey!

1979
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,244
How's your old lady?

1980
01:42:18,244 --> 01:42:21,080
Eh... bitch finally graduated, yo.

1981
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,415
Oh, fuck it!

1982
01:42:22,415 --> 01:42:24,334
Yeah, now she can support my ass, eh?

1983
01:42:24,334 --> 01:42:25,585
I got all the feria right here, dog.

1984
01:42:25,585 --> 01:42:27,420
It's all rolled up and shit.

1985
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:28,338
You know what I mean?

1986
01:42:28,338 --> 01:42:29,923
Ready to go, dog. Check this out, homes.

1987
01:42:29,923 --> 01:42:30,924
Ah, hell, nah!

1988
01:42:30,924 --> 01:42:32,258
Yo, hold up, dog. Don't trip.

1989
01:42:32,258 --> 01:42:34,094
<i>I know these fools.
They're with me, ese.</i>

1990
01:42:34,094 --> 01:42:35,178
These are the fools that jacked me, man!

1991
01:42:35,178 --> 01:42:37,514
Fuck these motherfuckers!
I'm shooting both of 'em!

1992
01:42:37,514 --> 01:42:39,849
At least give the homeboy
a pass right here, dog.

1993
01:42:39,849 --> 01:42:41,017
Yeah, yeah, let him bounce.

1994
01:42:41,017 --> 01:42:42,102
I don't give a fuck.

1995
01:42:42,102 --> 01:42:43,603
I want this white boy in a box, though.

1996
01:42:43,603 --> 01:42:44,687
Hey, you in the ride.

1997
01:42:44,687 --> 01:42:46,356
<i>I ever see you again, ese, you best be</i>

1998
01:42:46,356 --> 01:42:48,775
Getting your last supper,
'cause you're a dead man.

1999
01:42:48,775 --> 01:42:50,110
Hey, just get the fuck outta here, Mike.

2000
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:51,611
Take off, homey.

2001
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:53,696
I'll be cool.

2002
01:43:01,371 --> 01:43:03,039
What the fuck?

2003
01:43:04,124 --> 01:43:05,542
<i>Don't trip, ese. I'm cool.</i>

2004
01:43:08,211 --> 01:43:09,379
Chill, dog! Chill, dog!

2005
01:43:09,379 --> 01:43:10,964
I got three kids...

2006
01:43:10,964 --> 01:43:13,133
Oh, no, please, sir! Please!

2007
01:43:13,133 --> 01:43:14,384
No, no, no, no, no! Jim, no!

2008
01:43:14,384 --> 01:43:16,469
Please, please.

2009
01:43:35,989 --> 01:43:38,323
Why the fuck did you do that?
Why the fuck......

2010
01:43:41,077 --> 01:43:42,078
Pull the door!

2011
01:44:25,288 --> 01:44:26,706
Oh, my God, Jim!

2012
01:44:26,706 --> 01:44:27,707
I'm hit bad.

2013
01:44:27,707 --> 01:44:29,209
What have we done?

2014
01:44:29,209 --> 01:44:31,461
I can't move my arm...
and I can't feel my legs!

2015
01:44:32,796 --> 01:44:34,964
I can't move shit.

2016
01:44:34,964 --> 01:44:37,217
I'm fucked up. I'm fucked up.

2017
01:44:37,217 --> 01:44:38,551
I'm fucked up.

2018
01:44:49,562 --> 01:44:50,730
Okay...

2019
01:44:50,730 --> 01:44:52,315
Don't trip...

2020
01:44:52,315 --> 01:44:53,900
Don't trip, dog.

2021
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,069
County Hospital's right there.

2022
01:44:56,069 --> 01:44:57,487
No! No! No! County Hospital...

2023
01:44:57,487 --> 01:44:58,988
Don't you dare take me there!

2024
01:44:58,988 --> 01:45:00,824
Don't you dare!

2025
01:45:00,824 --> 01:45:02,575
I'm not going out like that.

2026
01:45:02,575 --> 01:45:03,743
No, we're going. No, no...

2027
01:45:03,743 --> 01:45:05,578
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, we're going.

2028
01:45:05,578 --> 01:45:07,330
No medical treatment.
No medical treatment.

2029
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:09,082
But, but...

2030
01:45:09,082 --> 01:45:10,583
Mike, Mike...

2031
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:13,336
You gotta kill me. You gotta kill me.

2032
01:45:13,336 --> 01:45:15,338
You gotta kill me.

2033
01:45:15,338 --> 01:45:16,418
Why? Why?

2034
01:45:18,925 --> 01:45:21,928
I fucked up.

2035
01:45:21,928 --> 01:45:23,179
Everything's shitty.

2036
01:45:23,179 --> 01:45:25,181
No, no...

2037
01:45:25,181 --> 01:45:26,850
Mercy kill me.

2038
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:29,686
Ah... ah, please, mercy kill me.

2039
01:45:29,686 --> 01:45:32,856
Ah, oh, no, dude.

2040
01:45:32,856 --> 01:45:35,275
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

2041
01:45:35,275 --> 01:45:36,776
No, everything's gonna be fine.

2042
01:45:36,776 --> 01:45:38,278
Jim, shh-Shh, shh-Shh,
shh-Shh, shh-Shh.

2043
01:45:38,278 --> 01:45:39,362
Everything's gonna be fine.

2044
01:45:39,362 --> 01:45:40,697
Everything's gonna be fine.

2045
01:45:40,697 --> 01:45:42,949
Take a look at me, you dumb fuck!

2046
01:45:42,949 --> 01:45:45,452
Everything's gonna be fine?!

2047
01:45:45,452 --> 01:45:47,287
Come on...

2048
01:45:47,287 --> 01:45:50,290
You take my piece...

2049
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:52,292
And you put it to my fuckin' head...

2050
01:45:52,292 --> 01:45:55,462
And you pull the trigger.

2051
01:45:55,462 --> 01:45:57,213
You fuckin' step up...

2052
01:45:57,213 --> 01:45:57,713
No

2053
01:45:59,048 --> 01:45:59,883
And you do it.

2054
01:45:59,883 --> 01:46:01,050
No.

2055
01:46:01,050 --> 01:46:02,969
'Cause I can't.

2056
01:46:08,641 --> 01:46:10,727
Don't be a fuckin' pussy.

2057
01:46:10,727 --> 01:46:12,061
Oh, my God...

2058
01:46:12,061 --> 01:46:13,563
Don't think about it.

2059
01:46:13,563 --> 01:46:15,315
Huh?

2060
01:46:15,315 --> 01:46:16,316
Do it.

2061
01:46:16,316 --> 01:46:17,156
Please.

2062
01:46:18,651 --> 01:46:19,652
Just kill you and bail?

2063
01:46:19,652 --> 01:46:20,902
Yeah.

2064
01:46:22,071 --> 01:46:23,656
Just take off.

2065
01:46:23,656 --> 01:46:26,159
And don't look back...

2066
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:27,744
Or you'll...

2067
01:46:27,744 --> 01:46:31,414
Or you'll turn into a pillar of salt.

2068
01:46:31,414 --> 01:46:33,750
Hey... Hey...

2069
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:36,753
You wanted to know what it
was like to kill someone.

2070
01:46:36,753 --> 01:46:40,507
What's up, huh?

2071
01:46:40,507 --> 01:46:41,758
No one's gonna know.

2072
01:46:41,758 --> 01:46:42,758
Hmm?

2073
01:46:44,427 --> 01:46:46,179
Just you...

2074
01:46:46,179 --> 01:46:48,264
And just me.

2075
01:46:48,264 --> 01:46:49,933
And God.

2076
01:46:49,933 --> 01:46:51,601
No fuckin' way.

2077
01:46:51,601 --> 01:46:53,019
Huh? No fuckin' way.

2078
01:46:53,019 --> 01:46:55,021
You're crazy; I'm not shootin' you, dog.

2079
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:56,272
It's mercy, dog.

2080
01:46:56,272 --> 01:46:58,441
It's mercy.

2081
01:46:58,441 --> 01:47:01,111
I deserve that.

2082
01:47:01,111 --> 01:47:02,779
I'd do it for you.

2083
01:47:04,364 --> 01:47:05,949
I'd do it for you.

2084
01:47:06,533 --> 01:47:07,783
Yeah.

2085
01:47:09,869 --> 01:47:11,788
Take it.

2086
01:47:11,788 --> 01:47:13,456
Yeah, yeah.

2087
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:21,214
Yeah, yeah... yeah...

2088
01:47:27,137 --> 01:47:29,722
D-Don't, don't think about it.

2089
01:47:29,722 --> 01:47:30,974
Don't think about it.

2090
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,311
Yeah, yeah...

2091
01:47:35,311 --> 01:47:36,563
Ah, yeah.

2092
01:47:36,563 --> 01:47:37,813
Yeah.

2093
01:47:39,315 --> 01:47:41,901
Ah... ah...

2094
01:47:41,901 --> 01:47:45,488
You did this to
yourself, you stupid fuck!

2095
01:47:45,488 --> 01:47:46,739
You're always doing stupid shit!

2096
01:47:46,739 --> 01:47:48,575
I gotta fuckin' fix it! Okay, okay.

2097
01:47:48,575 --> 01:47:49,826
Is that what you fuckin' want?!

2098
01:47:49,826 --> 01:47:50,994
Yes. Huh?

2099
01:47:50,994 --> 01:47:52,495
You want me to fuckin' fix your head,

2100
01:47:52,495 --> 01:47:54,080
Once and for all?! Come on, it's easy.

2101
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:55,415
It's easy. No! Bullshit!

2102
01:47:55,415 --> 01:47:57,000
Bullshit! Not for me!

2103
01:48:00,587 --> 01:48:02,922
I love you, fuckin' shit bag.

2104
01:48:02,922 --> 01:48:05,508
I love you, too.

2105
01:48:08,094 --> 01:48:09,679
I'm gonna miss you, brother.

2106
01:48:12,182 --> 01:48:13,349
I'm sorry.

2107
01:48:15,435 --> 01:48:17,520
I'm sorry.

2108
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,355
Everything's gonna be okay. Yeah.

2109
01:48:19,355 --> 01:48:20,605
Yeah.

2110
01:48:22,442 --> 01:48:23,943
I know.
