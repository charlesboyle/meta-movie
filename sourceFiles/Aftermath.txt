1
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,899
We have reports
coming in from Israel that the Prime...

2
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,339
Netanyahu has been assassinated.

3
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,859
These are preliminary...

4
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,339
Increasing hostilities reported

5
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,979
along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border...

6
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,619
are advancing upon

7
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,299
greatly outnumbered American troops

8
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,471
in western Afghanistan.

9
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,379
Casualties are mounting in a scene

10
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,899
that was not supposed to happen.

11
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,899
Reports of a
possible military coup in Pakistan...

12
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,859
Al Jazeera has
broadcast the alleged decapitation

13
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,781
of the Prime Minister...

14
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,659
cannot
and will not confirm reports

15
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,899
that Prime Minister Zardari
has been executed.

16
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,819
Beijing has
confirmed a mobilization of force

17
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,549
to protect its western border.

18
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,179
We have
received an unsubstantiated,

19
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,539
and I repeat, an unsubstantiated
broadcast from Al Jazeera TV.

20
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,179
Call for jihad

21
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,308
for that, uh, this transgression
against all of Allah.

22
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,459
At 11:53 a.m.,

23
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,619
American forces air-burst
a tactical nuclear device

24
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,463
over advancing terrorist troops in the...

25
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,019
can confirm a nuclear explosion

26
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,019
in the city of New Delhi, India,
leaving what authorities...

27
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,659
a 10-megaton explosion
in a densely populated...

28
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,979
undoubtedly causing almost
instantaneous death...

29
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,099
Pentagon has
confirmed that three nuclear warheads

30
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,939
have been detonated
above Islamabad and...

31
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,539
world leaders call for restraint

32
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,739
as nuclear explosions
riddle the Asian continent.

33
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,459
Reports of
detonations in Japan and Taiwan...

34
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,059
Tel Aviv is gone.

35
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,419
Iranian missiles today...

36
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,539
Israel has confirmed
they have launched nuclear warheads

37
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,459
against Saudi Arabia and Iran.

38
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,579
In a statement,
the government said...

39
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,419
that India,
in their confusion or haste...

40
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,819
"Israel reserves the
right to defend herself from those

41
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,699
- "who seek to harm..."
- ...after the destruction of New Delhi,

42
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,099
have lost all
communication with the West Coast...

43
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,939
can confirm that
the CNN broadcast from Atlanta

44
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,059
has gone down. We now go to...

45
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,259
This is the Emergency Alert System.

46
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,939
Authorities are coordinating with
federal agencies and will provide

47
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,979
the most updated medical information
and evacuation instructions

48
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,346
at the top of the hour. Citizens
are advised...

49
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,819
- Get out of the car! Get out!
- Satchel, come on, we have to go.

50
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,299
We have to move. Come on.

51
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,902
Get down!

52
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,751
Go! Go, go, go!

53
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,511
Satchel? Are you okay?

54
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,459
Are you okay? Oh, my God.

55
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,219
- Come here.
- Oh, my God.

56
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,659
I can't see.

57
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,019
- What? Satchel?
- I can't see!

58
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,699
Oh, Satchel... Is he okay?

59
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,699
Keep your eyes closed, all right?

60
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,219
Don't look at anything. It's
just gonna hurt your eyes.

61
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,107
- Okay.
- Satchel?

62
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,391
Come here.

63
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,939
- It's okay. I've got you.
- We need to get off the road and find shelter.

64
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,539
We can't do that on foot.

65
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,699
I need to call our
family, let them know we're okay.

66
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,419
Cell phones won't work.

67
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,979
- Nothing electronic will.
- Why did this happen?

68
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,019
That's not important now.

69
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,059
We only have an hour or so before
the radiation starts coming in.

70
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,059
Food, water, supplies, a diesel
vehicle are the priority.

71
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,659
Well, what about the Interstate?
We could, uh, find someone to help us.

72
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,099
No. We need to stay
away from populated areas

73
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,339
until we know what's going on.

74
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,305
Oh, fine.

75
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,219
- Come here.
- Here, hold this, okay? Just stay right here.

76
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,379
All right.

77
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,982
Hold this, right there.

78
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,780
All right. Oh, shit!

79
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,110
No keys.

80
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,861
- Hey, see if you can find me a screwdriver.
- Okay. All right.

81
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,907
Perfect.

82
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,739
Hopefully this works,
Jennifer and Satchel.

83
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,259
Let's see if this
thing has some gas.

84
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,380
- Hop on in.
- Great.

85
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,181
Here. Follow me, okay?

86
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,305
I... I still can't see.

87
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,582
Is, uh... Is this normal?

88
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,270
Yeah, you'll be all right.

89
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,259
Come on, come on.

90
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,859
- Where you going?
- Okay, okay.

91
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,299
All right, I need you to find bottled
water, tuna, peanut butter, um,

92
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,099
beef jerky. Anything high
in protein, all right?

93
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,419
No junk food, no empty calories.

94
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,619
No, stay in the car.
Stay in the car.

95
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,779
Find any kind of batteries you can.
Um, baby wipes. We need baby wipes.

96
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,303
- Okay... Okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay? Let's go.

97
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,910
- Where are you headed?
- Waco. My car won't start.

98
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,345
How many did you see go off?

99
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,221
There were two to the east,

100
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,939
by the Dyess air base in Abilene.

101
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,939
One to the north. Uh, I don't
know, maybe Oklahoma City...

102
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,068
And a whole bunch of huge ones to
the south. Probably Dallas, Fort Worth.

103
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,509
They really got us this
time, didn't they?

104
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,190
Look, we need to get somewhere
safe. You can hop in the back.

105
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,026
Okay.

106
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,942
Hello?

107
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,861
Hello?

108
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,779
- Please go away. Go away.
- No, no, no. We just need to find a basement.

109
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,819
Oh, my God!

110
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,659
- Oh, God! Oh, my God! Holy shit!
- Go, go, go!

111
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,299
Are you okay? Are you shot?

112
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,551
Just go! Come on.
We got to get out of here!

113
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,306
- Hey!
- I know what you're looking for.

114
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,419
What about this place?

115
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,341
We're running out
of time. It'll have to do.

116
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,503
- Where are we?
- It's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be all right.

117
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,340
Hello?

118
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,381
Hey.

119
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,621
Hey.

120
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,259
- Don't shoot.
- Get the fuck out of here.

121
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,669
I'm a fucking doctor. Okay?

122
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,219
Come on, Mr. Franklins.
He said he was a doctor.

123
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,986
Now, I've been shot once today
and I'm not gonna be shot again!

124
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,619
Now, we have our own food
and we have a lot of water.

125
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,747
We just need a place
to stay. And I'm a doctor.

126
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,587
- I can help you.
- Brad, just let him in!

127
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,591
He said he had food.

128
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,983
We got our own water.

129
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,344
We got a water pump!

130
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,139
If you have a water
pump, it's well water.

131
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,583
It will be irradiated soon.
It's not gonna be safe.

132
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,019
Look,

133
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,539
I got a sick kid and his sister in the
truck. You have a cellar, right?

134
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,619
Yeah, uh-huh.
That's where we've been staying

135
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,419
since the nukes went off.

136
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,259
- Get them down there and stay.
- Okay.

137
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,703
My name's Jonathan.

138
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,660
Okay.

139
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,947
Is your cellar over there?
Look, Elizabeth, come here.

140
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,939
All right, we need to cover this with
dirt. Pull the truck around back.

141
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,339
Anything else around
there, all right?

142
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,699
Just get the shovels
out and cover them.

143
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,825
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

144
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,339
Look, all the food and water
I have is in the truck.

145
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,341
It needs to be in the cellar, now.

146
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,066
- What's your name? Angie.
- Angie.

147
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,819
I need you to go upstairs,
like, go in the bathrooms,

148
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,579
get all the towels, all the clothes. Get
them down into the cellar, all right?

149
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,830
Okay. I'll get everything.

150
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,379
- Hey.
- Yeah.

151
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,339
We need more shovels, all right?

152
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,546
Okay, yeah, I have
one in the cellar.

153
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,739
Whose house is this?

154
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,025
It's my grandma and
grandpa's house.

155
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,979
- Where are they?
- Oh, uh, my grandpa has leukemia,

156
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,979
so he's at Dallas at the hospital.

157
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,659
Grandma's with him, but...

158
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,899
- They're probably dead by now.
- I'm sorry.

159
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,779
I'm just kidding. They're
dead! That's for sure.

160
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,064
Could you stop being
an asshole and dig?

161
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,947
Bitch.

162
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,786
Charming.

163
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,541
Who's the moron?

164
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,299
He's our neighbor.

165
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,139
They don't have a cellar, because a lot
of people around here don't have cellars.

166
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,584
But we have a cellar, so...

167
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,544
Great.

168
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,299
- Angie, right?
- I got all the towels.

169
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,425
I don't think there's
any more up here.

170
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,139
How far along are you?

171
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,499
About seven months.

172
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,263
A little more than that.
Like eleven days or so.

173
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,661
Hey, hold on.

174
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,344
Let me see that.

175
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,066
That's fine.

176
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,019
All right, give the, uh...

177
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,271
Give the medicine to the blonde
woman I came with. The calm one.

178
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,339
- Hey, do you think he's gonna be okay...
- Yeah, he's fine.

179
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,305
Is that everything?

180
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,141
Truck's empty. What?

181
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,549
Relax.

182
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,823
Thank God I'm in Texas.

183
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,539
This is my granduncle, Wendell.

184
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,619
He lives with us now

185
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,219
because we couldn't afford a
home for him after the VA cuts.

186
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,899
Pleased to meet you, sir.

187
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,619
Listen, Doc, uh, he's a diabetic.

188
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,179
We have insulin, but we might...

189
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,827
- Don't worry about it.
- Here.

190
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,419
We got all the food and water down.

191
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,939
You have some more
kerosene lamps upstairs.

192
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,019
We need them down here.

193
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,339
Those are Grandma's. She's
really into that antique stuff.

194
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,139
But we gotta make sure that
we don't break any of it

195
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,579
- 'cause if she comes back, then, um...
- Doc...

196
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,830
Doc.

197
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,579
I got a question. You, uh,
took my pistol, remember?

198
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,499
Yeah, don't worry
about it. I still got it.

199
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,340
Yeah, so do I get a gun?

200
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,306
Tell you what, you go a week without shooting
at me again and I'll think about it.

201
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,431
Well! That's real nice.

202
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,979
Sure good to be able to
see everybody's faces.

203
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,259
Yeah, but there's only, uh, three car
batteries, so we have to conserve.

204
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,908
How long do we have
to stay down here?

205
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,228
We are never gettin'
out of here, honey.

206
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,466
At least a month.

207
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,906
Depends how widespread all this is.

208
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,307
The, uh, blast radiation isn't good,
but the fallout is a bigger problem.

209
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,019
When a nuclear bomb goes off,
it sucks up dirt and debris into the air

210
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,179
that falls back down like snow.

211
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,059
It's really radioactive,
and it's a particulate.

212
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,549
You... You breathe it in.

213
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,779
Oh, my God, dude!

214
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,145
Watch out, guys! We can't even
fucking breathe in here now!

215
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,339
I was watching Fox News and

216
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,910
it sounded like it was
pretty widespread.

217
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,379
Well, I knew about that
magnopulse thing, so I...

218
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,191
I put my mp3 player in the safe so that
we at least have some music to listen to.

219
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,339
I know these things went off all
over Asia and North America.

220
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,264
A lot in Europe, too, but I don't know
how widespread the radiation is.

221
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,939
I saw at least five of them go off.

222
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,699
But there's no way of knowing how
many megatons the bombs were...

223
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,499
Uh, the wind direction
at the time of blast...

224
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,459
I have a shortwave right
here that I'm working on.

225
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,219
But...

226
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,903
It might be broken, though.

227
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,861
Grandpa's a pretty big military collector.

228
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,379
I don't know what all's in there.

229
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,109
He never really lets me mess
with any of that stuff.

230
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,579
Start nailing up the
cellar doors shut.

231
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,309
And if you have any tape,
seal up the cracks.

232
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,379
God damn it, man!

233
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,419
You haven't gotten this shit all
off the fucking shelf? Man, Jesus!

234
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,739
- Gotta take boxes off it!
- Sorry.

235
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,503
Fucking Poindexter, man!
Get this fucking thing off!

236
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,626
Fuck!

237
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,384
- What are you doing, man? Get a hammer!
- I'm sorry. Here.

238
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,585
Hey. Here.

239
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,579
What is that?

240
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,150
It's a Geiger counter.
It measures radiation.

241
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,939
- Well, the door's boarded tight.
- Shh!

242
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,221
The fallout.

243
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,819
Are you fucking crazy?

244
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,099
You're gonna make my wife
piss in a goddamn bucket?

245
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,019
Come on, Mr. Franklins. You
know we can't go upstairs.

246
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,899
Hey, Professor Oppenheimer,
this is the best we can do.

247
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,059
I don't know if you've noticed,
but we don't have a toilet.

248
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,301
Kerosene is less dense than water,
urine, or shit, so it'll stay on top.

249
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,948
All right, you can go in.

250
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,709
- And thank you.
- You're welcome.

251
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,222
Maybe you should
try fixing the, uh, shortwave radio.

252
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,265
Okay.

253
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,059
Is he gonna be okay?

254
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,339
His retinas were too badly burned in
the blast. He was looking directly at it.

255
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,510
Do you think we should tell him?
I mean, he's been asking me.

256
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,422
I'm gonna go check on Angie.

257
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,585
Here, baby.

258
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,389
I'm tired. Oh, shit.

259
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,339
Oh, great.

260
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,351
Hey.

261
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,419
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

262
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,422
- Do you mind if I listen for a heartbeat?
- Yeah, sure.

263
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,021
Okay.

264
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,059
You mind taking a deep breath for me?

265
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,105
There we go.

266
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,542
She's cool, right?

267
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,620
Right?

268
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,179
You look a little
young to be a M.D.

269
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,059
What are you doing around here?

270
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,459
I was finishing my residency
at New York University.

271
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,221
Wow!

272
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,379
New York!

273
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,699
What?

274
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,065
I'm not doing anything?
I'm just curious.

275
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,459
What are you doing around these parts?
You... I saw your backpack.

276
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,299
You on a walkabout or something?

277
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,504
Yeah, something like that.

278
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,740
Jesus.

279
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,184
All right, stay...
Stay warm, honey.

280
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,186
Thank you.

281
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,899
We need to drink a bottle of
water and try to get some sleep.

282
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,859
- And cover up as much as possible.
- That's...

283
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,539
Brad, please.

284
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,667
Can we just go to sleep?
I don't feel very well.

285
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,027
Hey, Jonathan. Should I be
worried about those two?

286
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,819
I don't know.

287
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,550
Sometimes, she'll come over
here to talk to Grandma...

288
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,982
And she's always, like, crying.

289
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,986
Oh...

290
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:05,659
Oh, um, I got the, um, shortwave
working. Well, kind of.

291
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,106
You can use my earphones,
but you can only just listen.

292
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,660
The microphone's not connected yet.

293
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,823
Uh, I'm gonna go tuck in Grand Unc.

294
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,544
- Night.
- Good night.

295
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,980
- Here you go, Grand Unc.
- Hmm...

296
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,910
Thank you, Jon.

297
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,579
Are you gonna be okay, Grand Unc?

298
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,229
I sure hope my brother's
okay out there.

299
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,667
Ah, he'll be all right.
He's a war hero.

300
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,259
You should've seen him.
Grandpa, Jonathan.

301
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,831
He was the reason I
volunteered for Korea.

302
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,748
That was a different war.

303
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,219
- I'm gonna be sleeping behind you, okay?
- Hmm... Hmm...

304
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,346
So if you need anything...

305
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,791
Brad's gonna be a problem.

306
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,339
"We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men...

307
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,419
You gotta listen to this.

308
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,699
"Leaning together
Headpiece filled with...

309
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,499
Jonathan said we can just hear.

310
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,059
"...over broken glass
In our dry cellar.

311
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,579
"Shape without form, shade without...

312
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,099
"...the world ends

313
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:06,699
"This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends

314
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,179
"Not with a bang, but a whimper."

315
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,139
This is Shenandoah, Oklahoma.

316
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,902
Is there anybody out there?

317
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,179
This is Shenandoah, Oklahoma.
Is there anybody even out there?

318
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,184
- Satchel?
- Hmm?

319
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,221
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm. Where are we?

320
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,545
What?

321
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,499
- Drink some more, okay?
- Okay.

322
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,387
It's right here. It's a bottle.

323
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,179
What time is it? Does anybody know?

324
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,989
Uh, yeah, it's 11:23 a.m.

325
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,899
Shit. That's what I have, too.

326
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,339
What do you mean, "shit"?

327
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,147
It's almost completely
dark outside.

328
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,179
What?

329
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,619
It's, like, noon.

330
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,541
Yeah. Look for yourself.

331
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,379
That doesn't make any sense.

332
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,425
It's the end of the world.

333
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,939
What did you say?

334
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,111
I said, "It's the
end of the world."

335
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,230
You know what?

336
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,420
You shut the fuck
up with that shit!

337
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,939
My fucking pregnant wife is right here.

338
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,339
Stop with all this fucking "left
for us" bullshit, all right?

339
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,300
You leave that to your own
psycho head, all right?

340
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,386
- Don't talk to my sister like that!
- Hey, enough.

341
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,779
All right? We're not gonna
get anywhere like that.

342
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,429
It's not gonna help
this day be any better.

343
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,990
Hey, Doc.

344
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,019
How you doing, Wendell?
You doing all right?

345
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,621
Ah, I'm all right.

346
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,699
- Just a little tired from all of the excitement.
- Let me check something out.

347
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,064
I can't complain.

348
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,783
You're doing all right.

349
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,026
Ah...

350
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,659
What have you got there?

351
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,739
Um, when this all started, I was
talking to my best friend Barry

352
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,579
in Minnesota over IM.

353
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,819
And he's the one who told me
about the magnetic pulse thing.

354
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,419
He said I might be able
to save some of my stuff

355
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,751
if I put it in a metal
safe or something.

356
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,779
I don't know, man.
Maybe if it was lead.

357
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,860
This radio still works.

358
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:11,429
And, um, I put some of my
grandpa's .38 lead rounds in here.

359
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,143
Here's the best part.

360
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,030
Still works.

361
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,221
Well, that should help
you pass the time.

362
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,259
Really, uh...

363
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,988
It just doesn't make any
sense, though. I mean...

364
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,865
It's just dark,
you know? This is...

365
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,339
This is Texas, man! It's, like...

366
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,706
It's, like, 55 degrees
in this shit.

367
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,059
You know what I think?

368
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,939
The government, man...
They've gotta have, like...

369
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,099
- There is no government.
- ...something up their sleeve.

370
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,146
There is no government
anymore, Brad!

371
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,139
So many of those
things have gone off

372
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,899
that we can't even fucking
see the sun anymore!

373
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,027
Look, there's always a
government, all right?

374
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,819
Somebody did this to us!

375
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,339
I wanna find out if we did
anything back to them!

376
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,659
Who the fuck cares?

377
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,339
Hunter and I were on the
shortwave last night,

378
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,819
and everybody is going through the
exact same thing we are, okay?

379
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,379
Fucking bitch! I wanna know
what the President did!

380
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,979
I wanna know. I wanna know
what we're doing... Fuck! Ouch!

381
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,459
- Get off of me!
- Hey, listen...

382
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,939
Listen. Listen, all right?

383
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,259
We're not gonna get anywhere
by yelling at each other. Listen.

384
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,539
Will provide the
most updated medical information...

385
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,819
What? You didn't tell
us we had a radio.

386
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,259
At the top of the hour.

387
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,548
Citizens are advised to remain
underground until that time.

388
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,019
This is the Emergency Alert System.

389
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,139
Local authorities are coordinating
with federal agencies

390
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,981
and will provide the
most updated...

391
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,779
- You gonna be all right, Grand Unc?
- Yeah, I'm doing great.

392
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,099
Hey, remember those Astros games
against the Mets I took you to last year?

393
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,987
- Yeah.
- New York bastards!

394
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,630
- It was a good trip.
- That was really fun.

395
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,060
Hey.

396
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,819
He's okay?

397
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,344
You're okay.

398
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,946
Astros, huh? I was always
a Royals fan, myself.

399
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,346
Don't hold it against me.

400
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,859
Hey, Wendell, you know the best
part about backing a losing team?

401
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,579
What's that?

402
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,259
Nowhere to go but up.

403
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,670
You're pretty right, there, Doc.

404
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,819
Oh, Hunter,
the shortwave works now.

405
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,789
I mean, uh... I mean, the microphone's
connected, and the speaker works, too.

406
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,471
Shenandoah, this is Cameron.
Are you there? Over.

407
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,710
Hunter?

408
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,585
Trying to find those
fellows from Shenandoah.

409
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,948
Hunter, come on.

410
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,151
Come on.

411
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,907
Okay?

412
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,939
Shenandoah, this is Cameron,
Texas. Are you there? Over.

413
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,466
This is Shenandoah, Oklahoma.
Is there anybody out there?

414
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,063
Shenandoah, this is Cameron.
We are here. Over.

415
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,459
What did I tell ya?

416
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,259
What... What? Whoa! Okay.

417
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,539
- Okay, hold on. Hold on.
- We're not alone.

418
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,259
Hell, man! We didn't think
we'd ever raise nobody!

419
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,579
This is Shane Baxter of Baxter
Motors, Shenandoah, Oklahoma.

420
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,899
How the hell are
you, man? How you doing?

421
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,982
Doing a lot better now, Shane. Over.

422
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,419
Well, that's... That's great, man!

423
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,579
I got 11 people down here in this
basement trying to get along.

424
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,499
Shenandoah, come in. Over.

425
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,539
Shit, I'm losing him.

426
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,939
Shenandoah, come in.

427
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,862
Can you hear me, Shenandoah? Over.

428
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,699
This is the Emergency Alert System.

429
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,739
Local authorities are coordinating

430
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,219
with federal agencies
and will provide

431
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,259
the most updated medical information
and evacuation instructions

432
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,259
at the top of the hour.
Citizens are advised to remain...

433
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,059
Do y'all think that's
even worth listening to anymore?

434
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,179
I mean, because they've...

435
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,899
They've been promising an update
for an hour for, like, the past day.

436
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,219
Local authorities
are coordinating...

437
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,099
I just figure...

438
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,459
They're just trying to figure out

439
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,899
how to get people into
evacuation centers, you know?

440
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,939
Hey, Jonathan.

441
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,579
Just another minute
with this battery.

442
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,582
We're already on our second one.
After this, we only have one left.

443
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,299
- This is the Emergency...
- It's brighter outside today.

444
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,539
- Local authorities are coordinating...
- That's good.

445
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,419
- ...with federal agencies and will provide...
- Right?

446
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,741
Yeah, that's, uh...
That's great.

447
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,019
Why don't we just all get in our bathing
suits and go play in the sprinklers.

448
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,939
Brad. Stop.

449
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,541
Sorry.

450
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,299
Hey, Jonathan, turn off the radio.

451
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,222
Local authorities
are coordinating with federal agencies...

452
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,063
- Give me my gun.
- Shh!

453
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,061
Hey!

454
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,271
It's okay. It's okay.

455
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,019
No! Hey! We have a gun!

456
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,339
Hey, motherfucker!

457
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,591
Hey, this is my grandparents'
house, you motherfucker!

458
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,059
Shit! I'm sorry...

459
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,779
I'm sorry, Jonathan!
I didn't mean to be a...

460
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,259
I'm fucking hit!

461
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,819
He said your fucking name!
How does he know you?

462
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,659
- I don't know.
- Get up there! Get up there! Come on!

463
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,339
Hey, hey... Hello...

464
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,819
Rob?

465
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,619
- Rob! Rob!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

466
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,139
- It's Rob!
- What's going on up there?

467
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,859
- Hunter.
- Brad, get up here with a hammer.

468
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,699
- What?
- Brad, hammer! Now!

469
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,619
- I didn't know it was you.
- Brad, hammer!

470
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,019
Please, open the door!

471
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,379
We're coming, Rob! Open the door.

472
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,426
- Let us in here.
- Are you fucking crazy?

473
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,661
Coming, Rob!

474
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,539
Elizabeth, grab me a blanket
and a pillow and set it up here.

475
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,259
Jennifer, get me a pillow ready.

476
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,179
Move. Move! Move!

477
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,699
- God damn it!
- Come on, Rob.

478
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,899
- You should see...
- Give me.

479
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,539
I got you. I got you.

480
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,139
- Lay him down.
- Fuck!

481
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,299
I'm so sorry we shot you.
I'm so sorry, Rob. I didn't know...

482
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,219
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who the fuck are you, huh?

483
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,259
I'm so sorry, Rob!

484
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,579
- Huh?
- Okay, just let me deal with him!

485
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,739
Jonathan, get out
of here. Let me deal with him.

486
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,059
I didn't know it
was you. I'm so sorry.

487
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,379
Everybody stop apologizing!

488
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,579
Rob, you're in shock.

489
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,899
I need you to just look at me
right here, okay? Let me see this.

490
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,179
- Who is this guy?
- Let me see this.

491
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,704
- Elizabeth, can you hold this? Thank you.
- Who is he?

492
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,459
- I asked you a fucking question! Huh?
- Get off of him!

493
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,619
I need to look at your wrist.

494
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,419
He's my friend. He works at the
comic book shop on Redford.

495
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,779
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up!

496
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,419
Rob...

497
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,339
Hey, Rob, Listen to me, all right?
The bullet went through your wrist.

498
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,299
That's good. That means I'm not
gonna have to remove a bullet.

499
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,619
I'm just gonna have to dress
your wound and clean it.

500
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,699
They're shooting people...

501
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,459
They're shooting people.
They're shooting people!

502
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,619
- Hey... Hey!
- They're shooting people!

503
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,871
Hold him down! Hold him down!

504
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,545
Fuck!

505
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,386
Thanks.

506
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,824
Here, Rob. Drink this slowly, okay?

507
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,059
I don't want it.

508
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,859
Have they... Uh, the town,
have they set up any, um,

509
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,419
evacuation centers or
anything like that?

510
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,219
They tried.

511
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,339
They used the old, uh,

512
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,779
fallout shelter under the library,

513
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,819
but it didn't fit everybody.

514
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,699
There was a lot of fighting.

515
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,379
What about the Guard?

516
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,139
The National Guard?

517
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,459
They're all overseas.

518
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,425
Isn't good out there.

519
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,699
Started with a lot of looting.

520
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,379
Then the bubbas took over

521
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,664
'cause they had the guns.

522
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,384
Second night, there
was a string of rapes.

523
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,339
And they're not letting the
old people have any food.

524
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,103
A lot of people are in
bad shape, all burnt up.

525
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,619
A lot of people
getting really drunk.

526
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:08,299
Others are going crazy looking for
alcohol and drugs because they ran out.

527
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,141
When did the bruises
first appear, Rob?

528
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,150
They shot all the migrants.

529
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,019
That's when I ran.

530
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,619
They just lined them
up and shot 'em.

531
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,379
Everybody's going crazy and...

532
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,948
That's why I came here.

533
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,379
I was so worried about you, Rob.

534
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,899
You know, with Grandpa
and Grandma and Barry...

535
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,229
all dead.

536
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,784
Please, you gotta let me stay.

537
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,579
I'm...

538
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,099
All the real sick people, they're...
They're straggling around the town,

539
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,499
looking for food and water, but...

540
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,259
I got my own bottle of water and peanut
butter in my backpack upstairs, okay?

541
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,059
I won't even use your
food, I promise.

542
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,991
Please?

543
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,019
I don't wanna go back out there.

544
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:06,467
This is Jonathan's home, and if he
says you can stay, you can stay.

545
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,028
- Okay?
- Thank you.

546
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,339
"There are wars and rumors of wars,

547
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,659
"but be not troubled for
these things must pass."

548
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,581
Oh...

549
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,539
It's okay, it's okay.

550
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,347
Shut up!

551
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,899
It's just the radiation setting in.

552
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,947
I'm gonna give you two amoxicillins.
It should help you fight it off.

553
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,859
- Hey, Brad.
- What?

554
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:07,059
- Is she okay?
- She's... She's fine.

555
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,583
She's just got a little
morning sickness.

556
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,541
- Angie, have you been able to eat anything?
- Not much.

557
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,819
Man, she's fine. It's just harder
for her. She's gotta eat for two.

558
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,707
Right, sweetheart?

559
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,989
Hey, honey!

560
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,499
She's okay.

561
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,379
What the fuck! Hey... Hey,
sweetheart. Sweetheart, come on.

562
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,108
Come on. You're okay! Just breathe!

563
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,099
Angie, breathe. Come on!
You're hurting the baby! Stop!

564
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,747
Stop.

565
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,859
All right? Please!

566
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,699
It's okay! Just breathe!

567
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,459
Breathe! You're hurting the
fucking baby! Just breathe, okay?

568
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,631
- Stop! Stop it!
- Please!

569
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,902
- Oh, my God!
- What?

570
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,629
- What? What are you guys looking at?
- Ange...

571
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,821
What?

572
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,624
Stop. What's wrong with my face?

573
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,379
Ange...

574
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,459
Stop, Brad! You're freaking me out!

575
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,419
- What is wrong with my face? What?
- It's okay, it's okay.

576
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,899
It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry.

577
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,019
- Ange, God, I'm so sorry.
- What happened?

578
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,827
Jennifer?

579
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,308
Jennifer, calm down.

580
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:52,387
Jennifer, breathe. Just breathe.

581
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,469
Give me your hand.
Stay calm. Jennifer?

582
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,709
Jennifer! Get out of the way!

583
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,700
Oh, my God!

584
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,504
I'm keeping the gun.

585
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,504
Am I gonna die because she bit me?

586
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,061
She was scared, okay?

587
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,699
She was scared of blast burn
and radiation poisoning,

588
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,745
and she was dying and...

589
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,539
She's a refugee of this war.
She's not a movie zombie, okay?

590
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,299
- Could have fooled me.
- Let me see this.

591
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,259
What are we gonna do about her?

592
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,149
Well, Brad and I are gonna take
her upstairs to the top floor.

593
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,019
But I'm gonna wait for the
radiation to die down a little bit

594
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,349
before we do that.

595
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,019
"The soldier
now blew upon a green whistle,

596
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:44,859
"and at once, a young girl, dressed in a
pretty green silk gown, entered the room.

597
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,099
"She had lovely green
hair and green eyes,

598
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,699
"and she bowed low before
Dorothy as she said,

599
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,299
"'Follow me and I will
show you your room."'

600
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:59,219
"So Dorothy said goodbye to all
her friends except for Toto,

601
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,659
"taking the dog in her arms,
followed the green girl

602
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,699
"through seven passages and
up three flights of stairs

603
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,539
"until they came to a room
at the front of the palace.

604
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,899
"It was the sweetest
little room in the world,

605
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,739
"with a soft, comfortable bed...

606
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,059
"that had all sheets
of green silk..."

607
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,661
Shenandoah?

608
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,219
This is Cameron, Texas.

609
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,584
Shenandoah, come in.

610
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,339
This is Cameron, Texas.
Shenandoah, come in.

611
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,420
Hey! The story's not over yet.

612
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,899
"...that shot a spray of green
perfume into the air...

613
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,865
Doc?

614
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,870
I'm here, Shane.

615
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,259
- "...to fall back into a beautifully carved..."
- There's something upstairs.

616
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,099
- People moving around.
- Come again?

617
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,819
They can hear us.

618
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,499
A man in an army
uniform came yesterday.

619
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,459
He said it was for the
sake of the nation.

620
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,699
He took my sweet daughter.

621
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,099
I don't really think
he was from the army.

622
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,099
They're outside now.

623
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,619
They're outside, Cameron.

624
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:20,459
Christ, they're outside!
Crazy son of a bitch! Cameron!

625
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,381
Shane?

626
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,299
Shane, are you there?

627
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,179
Get down!

628
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,419
Cameron, no!

629
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:37,059
Close the door! Get the door!

630
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:42,268
Get down, now! No! No!
God! No, Cameron, no!

631
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,461
It won't be much longer now.

632
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,585
Hey, Grand...

633
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,300
Just...

634
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,831
Just go.

635
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,945
Just go.

636
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,779
You keep trying to be the
savior, Doc, and all that guilt,

637
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,382
it's gonna eat up your soul.

638
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,339
You kept the man as
comfortable as you could.

639
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,899
You better accept what's
gonna happen to us all.

640
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,579
You keep swinging from
the rafters like that,

641
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:43,901
you're liable to dirty up your
spirit for when you meet your Maker.

642
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,588
I'll keep that in mind.

643
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:01,259
Jonathan is insisting
that we bury Wendell.

644
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,110
Absolutely not.

645
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,379
The radiation is falling a little
bit, but it's still off the charts.

646
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,150
That's what I'm talking about, Doc.

647
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,630
That boy just wants to
do right by his kin.

648
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,859
He's gonna join him soon enough.

649
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,428
It'd be best if you
just let him do it.

650
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,699
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

651
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,059
I'm gonna take a little nap.

652
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,869
Then I'm gonna help that
boy bury his granduncle.

653
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,779
Hurry, guys, we gotta be quick.

654
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,269
Let's go. Hurry.

655
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,939
We should've just
left him up in the fucking attic!

656
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,587
Brad!

657
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,466
Quiet! They can hear us.

658
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,466
You know what?

659
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,299
Remember in the back?
There's, like, a water pump...

660
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,779
No, no, the water's the
most contaminated thing around.

661
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,419
It wouldn't be safe.

662
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,341
Hey, Jonathan. I'm sorry.

663
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,659
If you wanna say something...

664
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,259
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, boy... Oh, boy, we gotta go!

665
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,659
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, shit! Oh, God! You guys...

666
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,180
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

667
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,499
Watch out!

668
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,619
Hey!

669
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,699
Jonathan!

670
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,979
Go! Everyone,
back in the house, now!

671
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,786
Shit!

672
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,339
Jonathan!

673
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,019
- Fuck! I'm shot!
- Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

674
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,299
- Get in the house now!
- Everybody, get inside!

675
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,631
- Go! Go!
- Get inside now!

676
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,223
- Move!
- Jonathan! Jonathan!

677
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,979
- Jonathan!
- What...

678
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,779
- Come on! We gotta go!
- We gotta finish burying him!

679
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,139
Jesus Christ! Just run! Run!

680
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,902
Close the door!

681
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,462
Oh, damn! Rob!

682
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,786
What happened?

683
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,910
Go, go, go!

684
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,419
Elizabeth, get me a clean rag.

685
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,704
I don't think the
door's gonna hold.

686
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,859
Let's just go up there
and fucking kill 'em all!

687
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,819
No, they're just paper tigers.

688
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,899
Radiation sickness fucks up your strength

689
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,179
- as much as it does your...
- Angie!

690
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,861
Shit!

691
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,911
Oh, shit!

692
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,699
Hey! Hey! Hey, what's the
matter? What's wrong?

693
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,459
- What's wrong with her?
- She miscarried.

694
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:03,739
What? No! Hey. Hey! Come on!

695
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:08,259
Snap out of it!
Please! God! Fucking help me!

696
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,704
- We gotta get her to a table.
- Get her to the fucking table!

697
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,699
- I got it. I got it!
- Grab her head.

698
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,579
Jonathan, bring me a pillow.

699
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,468
You're okay. She's okay, right?

700
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,859
Honey. Honey. Look...

701
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,579
- Everything's gonna be fine, right?
- I need to get in here.

702
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,619
I need some towels or something.

703
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,459
She's losing way too much blood.
I need to do a transfusion.

704
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,819
- Help her, man!
- I don't have a way of doing a trans...

705
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,979
There's nothing I can do.
She needs a transfusion, Brad.

706
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,779
There's nothing I can do!

707
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,299
What are you saying there's
nothing you can do? Come on, man.

708
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,459
Fucking help her, man. Please!

709
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,699
Brad, no, you're not listening.
There's nothing I can do!

710
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,899
- No, no, no!
- She needs a transfusion!

711
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,459
- No... No. No!
- Jennifer!

712
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,299
There is something you can do!

713
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,819
- I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.
- Brad!

714
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,139
- All right. Stop.
- No, no stop! You fucking operate on my wife!

715
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,539
Get me... Get me...
Do you have a sewing kit?

716
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,819
- Yeah, my grandma's.
- Get me a sewing kit. I need a pot.

717
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:04,979
All right, I got this.

718
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,379
- If you don't save her, I'll kill you!
- Get alcohol.

719
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,219
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
- Okay.

720
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,419
- Brad, you don't wanna do this, Brad.
- Yeah, I wanna do this!

721
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,909
I... I need my bag.

722
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,979
- Come on!
- All right, I got this.

723
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,859
Angie's gonna be fine!

724
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:24,306
- Brad! Brad, come here! Brad!
- Brad, get in here!

725
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,659
Brad!

726
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,707
Brad... There's
no future for our child.

727
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,467
Look around. I don't want
him to see this world.

728
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,939
Just make us proud, okay?

729
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,065
- Please don't do this to me.
- Okay?

730
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,146
Move!

731
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,065
Angie... Angie, Angie, Angie.

732
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,186
- Fuck!
- It's okay.

733
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:19,419
50% probability at
two Sv with occasional vomiting

734
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:25,539
beginning three to six hours after
irradiation, and lasting for up to one day,

735
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:30,339
after which light symptoms like
general illness and fatigue appear.

736
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:34,659
50% probability at two Sv.

737
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:38,459
The immune system is depressed,
with convalescence unlikely...

738
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,459
and increased risk of infection.

739
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,499
Temporary male sterility is common.

740
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,339
Spontaneous abortion or stillbirth
will appear in pregnant women.

741
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,779
I'm sorry.

742
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,699
- Don't be sorry. Look at me.
- 10 to 50 Sv,

743
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:56,579
1,000 to 5,000 rem.
Acute radiation poisoning...

744
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,419
Jonathan, can
you turn this shit off?

745
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:03,259
After irradiation exposure. After
that, there is a seven-day anastasis.

746
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,991
Hey...

747
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,028
You read the last Green Lantern?

748
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,705
Yeah.

749
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,860
It was good, but...

750
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:44,222
Hal Jordan, he's no Alan Scott.

751
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,783
"In brightest day,
in blackest night,

752
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,899
"No evil shall pass my sight

753
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,019
"Those who worship evil's might,

754
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,980
- "Beware my power... Green Lantern's light!"
- "...Green Lantern's light."

755
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,019
- You can't touch that space.
- I know, okay, I know.

756
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,299
I'm going to get your flag.

757
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,586
I'm saying you can't cheat.

758
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,819
Yeah, I taught you how
to play this game.

759
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,819
You got your pieces
half in other squares.

760
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:31,866
As long as they don't fall
in the volcano, I'm okay.

761
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,499
You know, um...

762
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,580
What did you do before all of this?

763
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,303
Well, actually, uh...

764
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,065
I'm a nurse.

765
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:57,419
- I'm a doctor.
- I know.

766
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:02,150
- I guessed. I guessed you were a nurse.
- Really?

767
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,301
Think about it.

768
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:09,419
That didn't scare you?
The growl didn't scare you?

769
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,099
Turn it around.

770
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,828
I got it.

771
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:17,219
I got you five games in a row.

772
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:19,106
He's got moves.

773
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,899
Yeah.

774
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,739
- Play again?
- No. No, I won't play again. You got me.

775
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,628
Come on.
Let's go. Best out of nine.

776
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,339
Set it up.

777
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,459
This is the Emergency Alert System.

778
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,499
Local authorities are coordinating
with federal agencies

779
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,299
and will provide the most
updated medical information

780
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,419
and evacuation instructions...

781
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,299
at the top of the hour.

782
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:51,224
Citizens are advised to remain
underground until that time.

783
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,579
This is the Emergency Alert System.

784
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:58,699
Local authorities are coordinating
with federal agencies

785
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:04,379
and will provide the most updated medical
information and evacuation instructions

786
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,099
at the top of the hour.

787
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:10,259
Citizens are advised to remain
underground until that time.

788
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,699
Hello, this is Interim
Press Secretary Collins.

789
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,779
The following is a message that the
President of the United States has written

790
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:20,299
and requested I deliver to
all citizens of America.

791
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,779
"Good morning, my fellow Americans.

792
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,459
"The past week has been one
of challenge and tragedy.

793
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,819
"But like all great moments
in our nation's history,

794
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,819
"we have risen to the challenge.

795
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,659
"My friends, I promise you
that I will lead us home.

796
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,099
"Now, I assure you that
casualties have been high,

797
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,539
"and our prayers are with those
who grieve, but rest assured...

798
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,739
I cannot believe this bullshit.

799
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,059
"...our enemy casualties
have been higher,

800
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,739
"and we will defeat those
who despise our freedom.

801
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,979
- What about evacuation? My God!
- "There will be further losses

802
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,819
"but in the end, we will prevail.

803
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,819
"And I ask all Americans to remain
strong and vigilant, for God is with us."

804
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,219
He isn't saying anything.

805
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,499
He doesn't even have
the courage to say it himself.

806
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,059
He's just having some flunky

807
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,419
read this bullshit statement.

808
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,539
"Our military is
still partially functional,

809
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:08,419
"and will triumph over those
who would destroy us.

810
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:12,779
"I am honored to be your President,
and I thank you for your prayers.

811
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,699
"Thank you all, and
God bless America."

This is the Emergency Alert System.

Local authorities are coordinating
with federal agencies...

814
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:31,181
He thinks he's a national hero,
and we're all dying here.

815
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,301
Presidential legacy!

816
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:43,101
How did I let her get this far?

817
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:53,867
I don't know what's wrong with me.

818
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,909
I'm so stupid.

819
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:04,267
I'm so stupid. Dumb.

820
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,422
Let me see your hands, Brad.

821
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,860
- I'm sorry.
- Let me see your feet, Brad.

822
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,699
I'm sorry.

823
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,739
"She threw
her arms around the Lion's neck

824
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:38,739
"and kissed him, patting
his big head tenderly.

825
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,779
"Then she kissed the Tin Woodman

826
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:44,699
"who was weeping in a way
most dangerous to his joints.

827
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:49,899
"But she hugged the soft, stuffed
body of the Scarecrow in her arms

828
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:55,339
"and instead of kissing his painted
face, she found she was crying herself

829
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:59,706
"at this sorrowful parting from
all of her loving comrades."

830
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,905
I'm okay.

831
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,859
"Glinda the Good
stepped down from her ruby throne

832
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,059
"to give the little
girl a goodbye kiss.

01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:19,259
"And Dorothy thanked her for
all the kindness she had shown

834
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:22,819
"to her friends and herself.

835
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,779
"Dorothy now took up Toto
solemnly in her arms,

"and having said one last goodbye,

together three times, saying,

01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,262
"'Take me home to Aunt Em."'

840
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,227
What's wrong with him, Hunter?

841
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,468
He has pneumonia.

842
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:48,741
Satchel... Satchel?

843
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,259
Jennifer...

844
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,431
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
- Jennifer, come here.

845
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,305
Oh, my God!

846
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:13,899
Jennifer... Jennifer, we've
gotta cover him up. Come here.

847
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,699
Jennifer, come here.

848
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,029
- I'm sorry!
- Guys.

849
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,979
I'm so sorry.

850
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,742
Jonathan, come here.

851
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,704
I'm sorry. Elizabeth.

852
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,948
He didn't even complain.

853
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:48,062
- He kept saying he was okay.
- Hunter, it's all around us.

854
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,259
It's killing us.

855
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:53,625
Yeah, but if we'd had
more antibiotics...

856
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,339
I used most of them on my shoulder.

857
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:01,099
- On Rob's blast burns...
- Hunter, this isn't your fault, okay?

858
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,510
We would all be dead
if you weren't here.

859
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:08,309
Look what happened to
those guys in Shenandoah.

860
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:12,019
Hey, man, are you all right?

861
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,621
Yeah.

862
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,219
I don't know. You're
looking pretty fucked up.

863
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:21,139
How are we gonna get
his body out of here?

864
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:25,339
I mean, there's just more and
more of those people out there.

865
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,669
No, we... We can't
take him outside.

866
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:31,099
We'll just have to bury him
up in the attic with Angie.

867
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,979
No.

868
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,706
I'll take him up.

869
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,739
Sorry, Rob. You don't have the strength
to carry him. I'm not gonna let you.

870
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,899
No, Doc, I...

871
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,219
Let me do this.

872
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,266
Okay, I owe you. I owe all of you.

873
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:50,309
If someone's gonna risk
themselves, it should be me.

874
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,019
Now, you always...

875
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:55,099
You've always kept us sensible.
This is the sensible thing.

876
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,943
I mean, look at me. I'm not
gonna last much longer.

877
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,270
It should be me.

878
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,419
How's your ear feeling?

879
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,181
I don't know.

880
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,586
Can you, like, hear out
of it or anything?

881
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,979
I can't really feel them.

882
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:21,151
God, it's bleeding, dude.

883
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,861
Rob.

884
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,425
All right.

885
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,819
If there's anybody out there,

886
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:58,059
put the body down and get
back to the basement.

887
01:13:58,060 --> 01:13:59,821
Okay.

888
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:02,862
Here. Take this.

889
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,259
No.

890
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,939
You need it down there more.

891
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,224
I'll be all right.

892
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,419
- Hey, Rob.
- What?

893
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,385
Good luck.

894
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,586
You, too.

895
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:44,903
Rob's been out there
a long time, you guys.

896
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:49,986
He hasn't come back. So...

897
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:55,549
What do you think? Think
those guys got to him?

898
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,625
Jonathan, I know
you and Rob were close.

899
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,266
I'm sorry.

900
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,744
You think they're in the house?

901
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,464
Jesus Christ!

902
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,379
Why do we still listen
to this shit? What...

903
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:27,659
What is this guy even
broadcasting about?

904
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,939
Why can't he just talk to us?

905
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:33,499
Maybe he's just always
accepted what's happened.

906
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,699
Let's face it.
We never had a chance.

907
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,622
- This all was over before we even got here.
- Great.

908
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:44,422
So what are we even doing?

909
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:49,987
Why are we even still here?
Why don't we just give up?

910
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,541
I ain't killing myself.
Are you psychotic?

911
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,827
'Cause that's what we do.

912
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:03,110
We try to survive.
So that we can go home.

913
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,102
Like Dorothy and Toto.

914
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:10,945
Yeah, like Dorothy and Toto.

915
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,502
Can't sleep either, huh?

916
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,541
I hear them, too.

917
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,230
And they'll, uh...

918
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:16,229
They'll definitely be
coming down here soon.

919
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,419
Yep.

920
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:23,069
God! Why do you think
they've waited so long?

921
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:28,187
So how's your shoulder?

922
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:32,105
The arm should probably come off.

923
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:36,188
Yeah, well...

924
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:42,461
You're doing a lot better than
the rest of us right now.

925
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:46,659
So, you ready for this?

926
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,140
Yep.

927
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:56,423
We should probably let them
sleep as long as they can.

928
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,670
They're coming.

929
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,339
Brad.

930
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,939
I'm gonna go get everyone.

931
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:30,339
Elizabeth, wake up. Wake up. Get the
guns out. Give them to everybody.

932
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,941
Oh, shit!

933
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,943
- Jonathan, come on.
- Oh... Okay.

934
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,461
Oh, shit!

935
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,308
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!

936
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,981
God!

937
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,779
Are you all right?

938
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:07,826
What? Fuck you!

939
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:12,901
We are cornered down
here. We gotta go.

940
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:18,949
- Okay.
- Let's go. Go.

941
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,739
Hey! No, no, no, no, no!

942
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,388
- What?
- It's my friend.

943
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,190
I know him.

944
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:39,906
Do it.

945
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:44,025
I'm sorry.

946
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:05,709
Get out of my grandparents' house!

947
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:02,749
Think we're about to die?

948
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,989
We're not dead yet.

949
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,259
Argh!

950
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,710
Get up!

951
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,865
Let's go!

952
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,906
Shit!

953
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,710
Hey!

954
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,299
- Put her down.
- Oh, shit!

955
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,419
What happened?

956
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,546
- Get the door! Get the door!
- Aw, fuck!

957
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:48,547
Aw, shit!

958
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,979
- Her lung is collapsing.
- I can't hold it, man!

959
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,619
- Her chest cavity is filling up with air.
- Please, man! Hunter!

960
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:57,019
Shit! Fuck! God, please! Fuck!

961
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:59,619
Please...

962
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:02,666
Just let me go.

963
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,664
I'm sorry.

964
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:09,744
- Fuck!
- Let me go.

965
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,065
Let me...

966
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:20,139
- ...go.
- Elizabeth... Elizabeth.

967
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:24,265
Elizabeth...

968
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,059
Argh!

969
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:40,867
Son of a bitch!

970
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,068
Fuck! You motherfucker!

971
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:39,659
Stupid fuck!

972
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,141
Jonathan...

973
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,786
We won.
