1
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,399
It's a simple fact that
not everyone is destined

2
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,199
to claim their page
in the history books.

3
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,447
But a lot of people are willing
to pay for a piece of it.

4
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,719
Popo, you are about to break the
NFL single-season sack record,

5
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,644
and when you do, you deserve
to cash in, plain and simple.

6
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,559
That's where Seven Figures
Management comes in.

7
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,839
We make sure that when you
reach a career milestone like that,

8
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,519
that you are rewarded
for that achievement,

9
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,444
in short, that you
get paid very well.

10
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,011
Now, my question to you, Popo, is...

11
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,888
Will you let me help you do that?

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,919
- That was perfect.
- Yeah?

13
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,839
Yes, that was amazing.

14
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,851
He's here, JB.

15
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,964
- What? He's early.
- He's still here.

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,719
Okay, time to go. Let's do this.

17
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,299
Knock him dead, partner.

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,319
That's where Seven Figures
Management comes in.

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,439
We make sure that when you reach
a milestone like that in your career,

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,486
that you are rewarded
for that achievement.

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,767
So my question to you
is very simple, Popo.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,725
Will you let me help you do that?

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,601
Yeah, I will.

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,839
Well, that is...
That is good news, Popo.

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,279
Why are we wasting time in here?

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,719
Let me go get your
paperwork started,

27
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,119
and then I'll introduce
you to your new team.

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,839
Cool.

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,119
Oh. Just one more thing, JB.

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,239
Name it.

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,579
I'm gonna need a
million-dollar signing bonus.

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,608
- What?
- You know, like, a million in cash.

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,687
Up front.

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,770
Oh... Okay, Popo...

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,559
I can't do that. I mean,
that just doesn't happen.

36
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,050
- I mean, no one can do that.
- Procorp can.

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,725
Paul Carter, please.

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,923
Paul, hey. JB Bernstein.

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,770
I'm great. Thank you.

40
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,281
Um...

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,999
No, the reason I'm calling is

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,807
'cause I wanted to
let you know that I

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,967
can't get you that check this week.

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,410
No. No, no, no. We still
want the office space.

45
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,719
Uh, just a couple more months.

46
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,239
I didn't even know

47
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,319
he was talking to Procorp.

48
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,879
Well, they got to him.

49
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,599
Yeah, you know, what they're doing
is completely unethical, okay?

50
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,039
We've been grooming the guy for six
months. I mean, six months. Come on.

51
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,563
And then, poof, he's gone.
They bought him?

52
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,561
Speak of the devil.

53
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,401
I hate them so much.

54
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,719
We just need another play.

55
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,119
We don't have another play, okay?

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,159
They just bought our play.

57
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,759
And we can't compete
with them. They're too big.

58
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,039
You want to go back? Huh?

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,079
You wanna work at the Death Star?

60
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,359
No, I don't wanna work at the
Death Star. I hated the Death Star.

61
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,319
I wanna work for us, I wanna
work for you, but, look,

62
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
come on, this is not really working.

63
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,399
Yet. It's not working yet.

64
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,319
Come on. May I remind you, please,
that we had some very good clients.

65
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,559
Emmitt Smith, Barry
Sanders, Curtis Martin.

66
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,399
Okay. May I remind you
that they are all retired.

67
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,679
My point is simply that we did
it before, we can do it again.

68
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,159
That's how this works. We just
have to hold it together.

69
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,239
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome</i>

70
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,002
<i>the Los Angeles Clippers!</i>

71
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,883
I feel sick. Can we go?

72
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,439
How about that baseball
owner you know?

73
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,599
- What was his name?
- William Chang.

74
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,439
Big money guy out of San Francisco

75
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,679
looking for investment
opportunities in Asia.

76
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,759
Except we don't have
anything in Asia.

77
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,599
Maybe we should find something.
Think about Yao Ming.

78
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,439
That dude's worth a hundred
million in Chinese endorsements.

79
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,679
We just need to find our Yao.

80
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,959
Okay. When it comes to China, we are
late to the party. China's tapped.

81
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,439
- Fine, Taiwan.
- Tapped.

82
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,690
- South Korea.
- Tapped.

83
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,879
North Korea.

84
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,159
Great. I'll set up a meeting.

85
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,399
All right. Well, then, this.
What if we go young?

86
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,439
- Mmm-hmm.
- Find some kid, develop the talent.

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,679
Get in on the ground floor.

88
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,567
Mmm. Hey, the Red Sox
just signed an 8-year-old.

89
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,239
All right. Maybe we hang
out at maternity wards.

90
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,241
Yeah, last time I did that,
I came home with twins.

91
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,359
Right. Bad idea.

92
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,089
Hey, listen, you are gonna love
it when it happens to you.

93
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,922
You just need to jump on in.

94
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,039
Ah, look at that. Cricket.

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,439
- Oh, come on.
- Come on. It relaxes me, all right?

96
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,559
I used to watch this with
my dad. It's a great game.

97
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,119
- It's not a great game.
- It is a great game.

98
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,399
It looks like an insane
asylum was opened up

99
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,359
and all the inmates were
allowed to create a sport.

100
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,679
That is just not true. Okay?
A billion people play this game.

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,839
I don't care. It's because
anybody can play it.

102
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,879
There's no discernible rules.

103
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,919
You hit the ball anywhere you
want and it's apparently fair.

104
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,959
And then you run back and forth
and tag each other with bats.

105
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,399
This is nonsense. Toddlers
can play this game.

106
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,479
Okay, are you even listening
to yourself right now?

107
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,219
Do you realize how stupid you sound?

108
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,610
It is a brilliant game.

109
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,047
And I am in trouble.

110
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,199
You're not driving.

111
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,039
Oh, my wife loves it

112
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,405
when I have to take a cab home
'cause I'm so intoxicated.

113
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,322
- Hey.
- Hey.

114
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,010
- Good night, guys.
- Night.

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,999
- Who's that?
- What? She's my tenant.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,679
She lives in the bungalow out back.

117
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,879
Wow. Backyard hottie.

118
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,719
No. She's not my type.

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,759
Oh, really?

120
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,119
Why? Because she's not a model?

121
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,519
Yeah, 'cause she's not a model.

122
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,639
What is wrong with
you, okay? She's cute.

123
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,319
Have you seen her? She's cute.
And what does she do?

124
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,839
I don't know.
She's studying to be a doctor.

125
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,719
Oh, she's studying to be
a doctor. Oh, my God. Ew!

126
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,319
Yeah, stay away from that.

127
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,003
Because she's not a model and
she's smart. That's terrible.

128
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,439
<i>- Mañana</i>, bro.
- All right. Get home safe.

129
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,008
We're gonna figure this out.

130
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,843
I don't know how much
longer I can do this, JB.

131
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,959
Look, we said we were gonna
give it two years on our own,

132
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,599
and it's been three now

133
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,999
and we still can't seem
to sign a new client.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,199
Yeah, I know. I'm aware of that.

135
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,759
But, look, we just
need one big client...

136
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,603
Yeah, that was Popo.
Popo was our guy.

137
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,209
I don't want to quit
on you. I don't.

138
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,803
I just don't know what else to do.

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,965
We're gonna crack this thing, Aash.

140
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,281
All right.

141
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,019
We're gonna crack it, Aash.

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,329
<i>I dreamed a dream in time gone by</i>

143
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,999
<i>When hope was high
and life worth living...</i>

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,919
<i>Youse didn't expect that,
did you? Did you? No.</i>

145
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,411
<i>I dreamed that love
would never die...</i>

146
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,799
<i>in front to have in the back...</i>

147
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,999
<i>downtown Los Angeles...</i>

148
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,359
<i>oxygen to every load to
boost your detergent...</i>

149
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,679
<i>Certainly a big
series for Matt Prior.</i>

150
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,319
<i>Disappointing against
the Indians in the test.</i>

151
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,799
<i>- Seventy runs.
- Chance to make amends today.</i>

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,959
<i>One of the things about...</i>

153
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,479
<i>die</i>

154
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,210
<i>I dreamed that God
would be forgiving</i>

155
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,765
<i>Then I was young and unafraid...</i>

156
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,759
<i>...of the wicket,
a wide half-volley.</i>

157
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,239
- Cook knows it.
- Oh, my.

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,239
<i>So different from this
hell I'm living...</i>

159
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,439
<i>It's been a successful</i>

160
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,963
<i>performance from Alastair Cook...</i>

161
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,570
Hey. How fast do they
pitch in cricket?

162
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,410
Fine, bowl. How fast do
they bowl in cricket?

163
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,450
You know what? Get me a
meeting with Chang this week.

164
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,968
I think I cracked this.

165
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,679
They don't play baseball in India.

166
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,759
That's right. They don't.
They play cricket.

167
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,605
But we think that we can convert a
cricket bowler into a baseball pitcher.

168
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,599
Look, India is the last
great untapped market.

169
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,599
We find new fans there
for American baseball,

170
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,999
the financial opportunities
are endless.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,119
Mr. Chang, if we can deliver
to Major League Baseball

172
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,839
its first Indian ballplayer,

173
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,039
that's a billion new fans.

174
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,719
What do a billion new fans need?

175
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,721
A billion hats. A billion T-shirts.

176
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,039
And you wanna set this up
like it's a talent contest?

177
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,279
Exactly.

178
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,726
That will ensure maximum
exposure of talent to press.

179
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,639
See, once we go over there
and find these guys,

180
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,399
we bring them back here,
we train them in LA,

181
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,207
and then we get them signed
with a professional franchise.

182
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,121
- What's your timeline?
- Two years.

183
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,091
Can you do it in one?

184
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,921
Sure.

185
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,959
Really? A year? Because
I thought we said two.

186
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,039
I had to hook him.

187
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,839
Okay, we can't find and train
two nobodies in a year.

188
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,039
It can't be done.

189
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,559
Well, without this deal, we're done.

190
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,839
So I just saved our business, Aash.
You should be thanking me.

191
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,319
Oh, I would thank you if
the deal wasn't insane.

192
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,319
- Well, apparently Chang didn't think so.
- Chang is rich.

193
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,839
You know what rich people can do?

194
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,839
They can be insane. We can't, okay?

195
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,239
We can't find somebody who
has never picked up a baseball

196
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,079
and teach them how to pitch.

197
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,359
You're right, we can't.
But I know someone who can.

198
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,119
Cross it over.

199
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,519
Bend it deep.

200
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,804
Pre-set your fanny.

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,409
Lift and plant hard.

202
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,119
Thank you.

203
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,839
That's our guy. Tom House.

204
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,999
Glove out front.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,039
PhD in psychology.

206
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,959
Thirty years in the big leagues
as a player and a coach.

207
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,319
Don't move your head.

208
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,559
Half of baseball thinks
he's absolutely crazy,

209
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,039
but you can't argue
with his results.

210
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,239
Ball on wall. Glove on wall.
Knee on wall.

211
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,679
If anybody can do it, he can.

212
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,599
It can't be done.

213
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,330
Cricket and baseball are two
completely different throwing motions.

214
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,279
The biomechanics,
the timing, the sequencing,

215
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,159
it's just not the same at all.

216
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,079
I mean, even if you found
me a couple of kids,

217
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,639
there's no way they'd be
ready for a pro tryout,

218
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,239
not in a year.

219
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,679
So you're saying it's impossible?

220
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,599
I'm not saying it's impossible.

221
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,364
I'm just saying it's...
It's highly improbable.

222
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,399
Why don't you consider it a
highly improbable challenge?

223
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,719
Think about it. If it
doesn't work, who cares?

224
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,359
No harm, no foul.

225
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,239
But if it does work

226
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,159
and you take two kids
from the middle of India

227
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,039
who've never picked up
a baseball in their lives

228
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,042
and turn them into Major League
prospects in one year...

229
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,079
Well, I can't think of a better plug

230
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,569
for your methods than that, can you?

231
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,039
You certainly don't need any
help with your pitching, do you?

232
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,079
<i>JB, I've been through
the entire list.</i>

233
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,999
I cannot find a single
Major League scout

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,439
that's willing to travel around
India for three months.

235
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,519
I can't be there without
a scout of some kind.

236
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,599
<i>Yeah, no kidding.</i>

237
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,279
I need someone that's gonna be there
in a month for the start of qualifiers.

238
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,399
<i>- I know that.</i>
- Hold on. Hold on.

239
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,479
Hi. Are you leaving?

240
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,119
- Yeah, I have to go.
- Don't go.

241
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,239
I have to. Don't forget about me.

242
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,319
<i>I will not forget
about you. I'll miss you.</i>

243
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,199
Okay. Bring me something.

244
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,041
- I will bring you something.
- You better.

245
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,839
<i>You know, I really wish
I hadn't heard that.</i>

246
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,959
Bye.

247
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,279
Yeah, well, if you saw her,
you would understand.

248
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,519
- Send me a picture of her?
- No, I'm not sending you...

249
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,799
Are we 14?

250
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,890
I have to call you back.

251
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,959
- Hey.
- Hey.

252
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,759
My washing machine's broken again.
This time I think it's dead.

253
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,559
- Why?
- Yeah, well, it's smoking.

254
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,399
Literally, from the back. And it's
making this really loud noise.

255
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,519
It's similar to ker-chug,
ker-chug, ker-chug.

256
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,519
Okay, okay, okay.

257
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,519
I'm leaving for India today.

258
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,679
Oh, that's cool.

259
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,479
So I don't really have
time to deal with this.

260
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,479
And I also really don't
have the money right now.

261
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,479
So could you do me a favor

262
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,731
and could you, while I'm
gone, just use mine?

263
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,602
Could you throw in free detergent
and the use of your barbecue?

264
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,839
- Okay, deal.
- All right, deal. Thanks, man.

265
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,442
- You're welcome.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

266
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,680
I think I'm ready.

267
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,359
Oh! Okay. Hi, Theresa.
Vivek never showed up.

268
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,879
Been waiting there for
three hours. I'm in a cab now.

269
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,119
Well, if you hear from him,
have him call me on this mobile.

270
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,399
You have it? Okay.

271
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,479
Bye.

272
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,479
What is with all the honking?

273
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,623
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

274
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,719
Sorry.

275
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,559
Sir. That's the place, sir.

276
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,559
- Here.
- 183?

277
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,162
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Upstairs, upstairs.

278
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,410
All right. All right.

279
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,047
Thank you.

280
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,759
Hi, there. Excuse me. Sorry.

281
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,886
Whoops. Yep, there we go.
That's my fault.

282
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,327
Can you tell me which one 3B is?

283
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,519
Hello. I'm JB Bernstein.

284
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,079
JBB, sir. Hello. I'm Vivek.

285
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,887
Weren't you supposed to pick
me up at the airport today?

286
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,399
Yes, but that is tomorrow.

287
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,279
No, Vivek, today.

288
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,769
That's why I'm standing here.

289
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,564
I was certain that it
was tomorrow, JB sir.

290
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,199
I tried calling you all day.

291
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,159
The telephone lines are not up yet

292
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,919
and I've been busy on my
cell phone, you know,

293
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,479
trying to resolve the issue.

294
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,519
But, anyway, you are here now.

295
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,799
We are very excited about
<i>Million Dollar Arm</i>, JBB, sir.

296
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,959
Thank you. And it's just JB.

297
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,239
- Okay.
- One "B."

298
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,439
- JB.
- No "sir."

299
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,520
- So this is our office?
- Yes, JB.

300
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,559
Is there always this much traffic?

301
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,879
There's always traffic
in Mumbai, JB.

302
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,159
What's with the honking?

303
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,839
Indians love honking, JB.

304
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,039
I don't know why.
It doesn't help.

305
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,999
Anyway, you settle down,
and then whenever you are ready,

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,639
we can have a status report meeting.

307
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,208
Great. I'm ready. Let's do it.

308
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,359
- Right away?
- Yes.

309
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,166
Oh, okay.

310
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,279
First of all, I am
happy to inform you

311
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,199
that all our plans are running
smoothly and on time.

312
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,239
Great. Can I see the flyers?

313
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,679
Flyers are not here yet.

314
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,699
They are at the printers.
We are trying to get them.

315
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,079
Okay. How about the T-shirts?

316
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,199
They are at the warehouse.

317
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,928
We are trying to get them, too.

318
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,359
Okay, but the equipment
that we sent over,

319
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,879
the batting cages, balls,
bats, that's all here?

320
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,644
I'm happy to confirm that
they all are here in India.

321
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,039
But you don't have them here?

322
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,919
No. They are at the customs.

323
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,679
I think we should
be working on that.

324
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,439
Okay, Vivek, I need things
to run on time and smoothly,

325
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,719
but actually run on
time and smoothly,

326
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,359
not Indian on time and smoothly.

327
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,999
You know, here in India,
we do things

328
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,001
a little differently than in the US.

329
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,085
Okay, so,

330
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,527
what do we have to
do to get our stuff?

331
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,724
Uh, we have to pay money.

332
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,759
Pay money. Like a bribe?

333
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,839
No, no, no. Not a... Not a bribe.

334
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,839
I mean, why use such words?

335
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,759
We call it "bypassing the system."

336
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,599
The systems in India are very
slow, so we bypass them.

337
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,759
- By paying money.
- That's the Indian way.

338
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,204
Indians love honking and
bypassing the system.

339
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,441
Okay.

340
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,819
Let's do it.

341
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,439
He says come after three weeks.

342
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,399
What do you want? You want more?

343
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,159
How much do you want?

344
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,719
Get lost!

345
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,199
Vivek, explain to me why
we can't bypass that guy.

346
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,439
We can, but not in there, JB.

347
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,079
- All right, well, where?
- Ah. Well, I don't know yet.

348
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,359
You know what, Vivek,

349
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,319
I'm starting to lose patience
with this whole plan of yours.

350
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,499
Don't lose patience, JB.
You are going to need it in India.

351
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,404
Ah, here he is.

352
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,799
He says he'll do it here!

353
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,639
Here? In the middle of the street?

354
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,971
That's where he wants to
bypass the system. Really?

355
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,126
Thank you.

356
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,599
Hey. What's up?

357
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,399
- I found our scout.
- Really? Who?

358
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,959
Ray Poitevint. He's one of the best.

359
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,999
He's retired, but House says
he can be there in two weeks.

360
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,159
- Oh, that's great. Great news.
- You're welcome.

361
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,319
All right, listen,
I'll call you tomorrow.

362
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,559
<i>All right, I'll see you later.</i>

363
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,439
- Bye.
- Excuse me, sir.

364
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,679
- Are you JB Bernstein?
- Yes, I am.

365
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,799
Hello, sir. I am Amit Rohan.

366
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,439
I love baseball.

367
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,079
I would like very much to work with
you on <i>The Million Dollar Arm</i>.

368
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,079
Great. Tryouts in Mumbai are
at the end of the month.

369
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,966
Come on by.

370
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,439
Lobby, sir.

371
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,039
JB sir, I don't play baseball.

372
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,159
Look at me. Too small to compete.

373
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,239
But I teach baseball in New Mumbai.

374
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,399
- You do?
- Yes, sir.

375
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,319
At my college I have seven students.

376
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,199
Ask me any question about
the game of baseball,

377
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,279
I will tell you. Ask me.

378
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,599
Okay.

379
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,879
How many innings does
a starting pitcher

380
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,845
have to pitch to get the win?

381
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,639
Can you ask me a different question?

382
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,759
No. Goodbye.

383
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,964
Sir. Sir, I'll work for free, sir.

384
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,241
Really?

385
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,003
Yes, sir. I'll work for free.

386
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,882
- When can you start?
- Now, sir.

387
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,559
Now is good. Let's go.

388
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,799
- Really, sir?
- Yes.

389
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,559
- Come.
- After you, please.

390
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,359
Thank you. Thank you, JB sir. Thank
you for this life-changing opportunity.

391
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,399
Don't sweat it. Vivek, this is Amit.

392
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,759
He's gonna be working with us today.

393
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,839
Hello. Amit.

394
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,039
All right, boys, let's go.
We got a big day.

395
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,919
- We gotta spread the word.
- Don't worry, JB.

396
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,205
Indians are very good
at spreading the word.

397
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,399
<i>An American company</i>

398
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,519
<i>is hoping to find a cricketer
to throw a very fast ball.</i>

399
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,079
The prize is worth one hundred...

400
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,559
thousand US dollars...

401
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,401
with the chance to win $1 million.

402
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,719
<i>But do you think in
a country like India,</i>

403
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,199
where we're obsessed with cricket,

404
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,167
do you really think American
baseball will catch on?

405
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,479
You're sure we don't need a written
contract for the TV studio?

406
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,839
It won't be necessary, JB.

407
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,359
That just seems crazy
to me, even for here.

408
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,281
The TV studios will
be there, trust me.

409
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,559
You see, Vivek, in the US,

410
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,239
we would get lawyers
and write up contracts,

411
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,679
and then everything
would run smoothly.

412
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,799
But do lawyers and contracts

413
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,919
make things run smoothly in the US?

414
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,159
No, they generally just confuse
the hell out of everything.

415
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,899
But it might make me feel better.

416
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,547
I understand.

417
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,719
JB sir, the Major League Baseball
scout Mr. Ray has arrived.

418
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,959
He is in the taxi.

419
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,039
I went to the airport to pick
him up. It's really exciting.

420
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,608
Fantastic. Bring him up.

421
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,644
We cannot do this.

422
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,761
Ray.

423
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,521
Ray!

424
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,571
Is he breathing?

425
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,639
Yes. Should I take him
to the hospital, sir?

426
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,844
No, no. Hold on a minute.

427
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,959
Hey.

428
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,925
Am I on fire?

429
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,839
No. Sorry about that.

430
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,169
That better be filtered water.

431
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,399
- Who are you?
- I'm JB Bernstein.

432
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,844
- Oh, the agent.
- Yes, the agent.

433
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,159
- Am I in India?
- Yes, yes, India. India, sir.

434
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,039
- They have hotels in India?
- Yes, they do.

435
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,359
Take me to a hotel and
don't wake me up again

436
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,566
until somebody's throwing
a baseball, you got that?

437
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,039
All right, well, I just wanna
say it's nice to meet you,

438
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,199
and get ready,
'cause we're on the road

439
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,599
first thing in the morning, okay?

440
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,486
I can't wait.

441
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,447
- Just take him to the hotel.
- Okay, sir.

442
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,279
All right, today we're in Nashik.

443
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,759
- Nas-hik.
- Nas-hik.

444
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,719
Tomorrow Jaipur, New Delhi,
up to Chandigarh,

445
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,079
then we are in Lucknow, Kolkata,

446
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,999
Bangalore, Goa, then back
to Mumbai for the final.

447
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,199
- How's that sound, Ray?
- Sounds wonderful.

448
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,639
- Are those places?
- They are indeed.

449
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,059
You like being on the road?

450
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,121
Words cannot express.

451
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,127
- They all here for us?
- Yes, JB.

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,568
This is awesome.

453
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,359
Things are running
very smoothly, JB.

454
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,599
I guess they are.

455
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,646
- This is great.
- We'll see.

456
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,327
Vivek, we've been here half a day.
No one can throw over 45.

457
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,359
JB sir, another 60
men just signed up.

458
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,519
Great.

459
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,839
Ray, how are you gonna
know if anyone can throw

460
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,079
if you keep your eyes shut all day?

461
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,759
- I can hear it.
- Really?

462
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,159
Yeah.

463
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,650
That was about a 43.

464
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,999
<i>In an impressive turnout</i>

465
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,179
<i>in the city of Nashik today,</i>

466
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,999

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,839

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,759
Oh, God, what did I eat?

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,999
<i>And yet, despite the
massive turnout,</i>

475
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,059
<i>it seems to be harder than it looks.</i>

476
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,279
<i>- Hey. Hello?</i>
- Hi, Brenda.

477
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,087
<i>Look, we're skyping. How's India?</i>

478
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,039
It's fine. I'm in the middle
of something. What's up?

479
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,039
<i>I'm sorry. So I don't mean to
be the bearer of bad tidings,</i>

480
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,919
<i>but your washing machine
has broken now, too.</i>

481
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,759
- Seriously?
<i>- I am just gonna pay for it,</i>

482
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,399
<i>- and I'll deduct it out of my rent.</i>
- Fine. Do that.

483
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,439
<i>So how's the contest going?
Are you excited?</i>

484
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,079
I will be if we can find a kid
who can pitch in the 80s.

485
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,959
<i>In... Okay.</i>

486
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,619
<i>Um, how's the food?
Is it crazy good?</i>

487
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,199
I should get back to work, Brenda.

488
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,659
<i>Okay. Good luck with the...</i>

489
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,761
<i>- Okay. Bye.</i>
- Bye.

490
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,366
So many people there.

491
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,519
JB sir, he is saying
he is young in spirit.

492
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,039
He wants to try.

493
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,642
Huh?

494
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,850
What is that, son?

495
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,199
Million Dollar Arm.

496
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,919
You don't play cricket.

497
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,839
It's a contest.

498
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,364
One million US dollars.

499
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,686
This is for kids.

500
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,959
You have work to do.

501
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,642
Real work.

502
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,599
<i>Calling all cricket players!</i>

503
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,399
<i>Come and be a contestant in the
"Million Dollar Arm" contest.</i>

504
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,999
Coach?

505
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,319
What is it, Rinku?

506
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,119
We're all track and field,
not cricket players.

507
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:04,683
Just because they are calling for cricket
players doesn't mean you can't try out.

508
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,639
I want to sign up, Coach.

509
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,359
So then sign up.

510
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,962
I'm not your secretary, Rinku.

511
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,919
If I won a million dollars,
I bet you would be.

512
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,199
You make a funny joke.

513
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,599
Everyone! 10 laps!

514
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,719
Get up!

515
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,527
Courtesy of Mr. Singh.

516
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,799
This is a total disaster.

517
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,999
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.

518
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,319
Not one of these kids can
throw over 65 miles an hour.

519
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,479
I swear to God, some of 'em
can't even hit the cage.

520
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,119
How's our money holding out?

521
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,159
Well, it's not, but you know what,

522
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,679
don't worry about that.
You find our boys

523
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,999
and I will figure out a way
to make the budget work.

524
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,199
What does Ray think?

525
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,759
<i>Well, when he wakes up,
I'll ask him. By the way,</i>

526
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,479
do you think you could
have gotten someone

527
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,079
a little more of this century?

528
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,119
<i>Hey, the price was right, all right?</i>

529
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,679
So stop your complaining.

530
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,319
Where are you? What city
are you in, anyway?

531
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,839
- I'm in Agra.
- Agra? Wait.

532
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,359
That's where the
Taj Mahal is, right?

533
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,319
Yeah, no, I'm standing
right in front of it.

534
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,679
<i>- How is it?</i>
- It is white.

535
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,679
Except for the part that's red.

536
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,119
There's a little dog
in the foreground.

537
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,839
Come on, man. Seriously,
how is the Taj Mahal?

538
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,159
I've always wanted to see it.

539
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,839
Oh, well, tell you what. Why don't
I put your friend Ray on the phone

540
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,602
and he can give you
his first impressions?

541
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,769
<i>Ray, buddy, how are you?</i>

542
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,124
<i>Hello? Ray?</i>

543
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,979
<i>Sell your friend for cash!</i>

544
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,279
- Hi, Brenda.
<i>- Hey. Hey, JB.</i>

545
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,879
<i>I have some very good news for you.</i>

546
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,919
<i>The repairman came and he fixed
both of our washing machines.</i>

547
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,519
<i>Two for the price of one. Done.</i>

548
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,559
Really? How'd you swing that?

549
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,759
<i>- I slept with him.</i>
- Seriously?

550
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,599
<i>No. But he was very
attractive, I'll give him that.</i>

551
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,283
<i>- How is the contest going?</i>
- Not great.

552
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,359
No one over here can
throw a baseball.

553
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,039
<i>Don't worry about it.
You're gonna find your guy,</i>

554
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,839
<i>and then you're gonna be
back here before you know it</i>

555
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,599
<i>regaling a whole new crop of models</i>

556
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,519
<i>to tell your fabulous stories to.</i>

557
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,559
Thanks for the pep talk.

558
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,079
<i>All right, I'm gonna jump in the
shower 'cause I got a date tonight.</i>

559
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,045
Really? With who?

560
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,759
<i>- Uh, I'm not gonna tell you.</i>
- Come on.

561
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,840
<i>Fine, the Maytag man. Bye, India.</i>

562
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,119
This place looks like
it has potential.

563
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,799
This is Lucknow. It has
a very fine reputation.

564
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,079
Reputation? Good.
Anything related to sports?

565
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,999
Yes, boys from all over India
come here for training.

566
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,999
Well, then there should
be a few qualifiers.

567
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,439
What do you think, Ray?
You feeling it?

568
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,159
I'm feeling something.

569
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,879
I think it's the dinner
I had last night.

570
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,482
Been there. Brutal.

571
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,319
All right, all right, we got
a couple of contenders here.

572
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,400
One, two-ish.

573
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,319
They were all crap.

574
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,079
Thanks, Ray. That's really helpful.

575
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,159
You want me to lie?

576
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,259
I do. I kind of want
you to lie, a little bit.

577
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,806
That sounded good.

578
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,359
Did he just throw 83?

579
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,725
Sure sounded like it.
Let's see if he can do it again.

580
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,771
- Wow!
- Whoa.

581
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,719
Okay. You know what we call that?

582
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,199
- Manslaughter.
- No, we call that juice.

583
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,962
What? You want juice? I'll get it.

584
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,559
No, we just found one kid,

585
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,319
threw four pitches in the mid-80s.

586
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,799
Yeah, he's a little
wild, but I'll take it.

587
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,319
- First time I've seen Ray's smile.
- Bernstein.

588
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,119
- What?
- Check this out.

589
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,122
All right, hold on.
I'll call you back. What?

590
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,199
How long's he been like that?

591
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,879
About a minute.

592
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,599
Is he gonna throw?

593
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,770
I have no idea.

594
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,079
Is that right? 82 with that motion?
Is that even possible?

595
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,239
A lefty with juice.
You don't see that every day.

596
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,239
A lefty with juice is good, sir?

597
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,799
Lefty with juice is great, Amit.

598
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,165
A lefty with juice is
money in the bank.

599
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,759
<i>Lucknow was huge for us.</i>

600
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,399
<i>We found four guys there,
and then we got on a roll.</i>

601
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,839
<i>By the time we got to Goa,
we had somehow found 16 more.</i>

602
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,719
<i>I mean, half these kids
never traveled before,</i>

603
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,599
<i>so they were thrilled
to come to Mumbai</i>

604
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,999
<i>and train for the finals.</i>

605
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,839
<i>We put them up in a small college</i>

606
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,919
<i>where Amit teaches.
Amit hooked it up.</i>

607
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,119
<i>He's been key, 'cause none of
these guys really speak English.</i>

608
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,639
<i>In fact, I asked him
to come to the US</i>

609
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,239
<i>and be the translator
for the winners.</i>

610
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,039
<i>Ray has graciously offered to stay</i>

611
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,759
<i>and train the boys for the final.</i>

612
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,399
<i>He actually seems to
be enjoying himself.</i>

613
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,119
<i>And Amit has become Ray's protege,</i>

614
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,439
<i>studying all his methods,
good and bad.</i>

615
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,769
<i>Hmm. Sounds great.</i>

616
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,439
I don't know if it's great,

617
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,799
but at least it's coming together.

618
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,439
What? JB, you're in Mumbai.

619
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,159
You're doing exactly what
you want. That takes guts.

620
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,319
<i>Personally, I just can't wait
to hear how it all turns out.</i>

621
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,119
That'll cost you a bottle of wine.

622
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,529
<i>- Bottle of Scotch.</i>
- Better.

623
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,319
Deal. So can I see your office?

624
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,639
<i>Well, I'm on the roof now</i>

625
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,639
<i>because the air
conditioner is broken.</i>

626
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,959
<i>Shocker.</i>

627
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,085
But here's my view.

628
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,761
Wow.

629
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,999
<i>- Right?</i>
- That is really cool.

630
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,999
Yeah, you kind of have to have
the smells to get the full effect.

631
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,839
- Does it smell so bad?
- Yeah, sometimes.

632
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,759
And then sometimes
it smells amazing.

633
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,879
It's a study in extremes,

634
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,779
just like everything
else in this place.

635
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,909
Mmm!

636
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,319
Can I see the Taj Mahal?

637
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,399
It's about 700 miles away.

638
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,765
- Oh, damn.
- Hey, Brenda.

639
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,319
<i>Right now? Is he...
All right. There's a...</i>

640
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,199
<i>I have to go. I have to go
to see a patient right now.</i>

641
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,928
- Bye-bye, Brenda.
<i>- Bye-bye, Mumbai.</i>

642
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,486
One, two, three.

643
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,839
You used to go to the
academy, didn't you?

644
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,519
Yeah.

645
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,239
Why did you leave?

646
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,599
My father hurt his back.

647
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,439
I had to help drive his truck.

648
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,719
Do you miss it?

649
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,679
You ask a lot of questions!
I'm trying to practice.

650
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,011
Ok, ok. Sorry.

651
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,167
Yeah, I miss it.

652
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,599
Did you play cricket?

653
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,201
No.

654
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,199
I hate cricket.

655
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,559
I played field hockey.

656
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,999
I throw the javelin.

657
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,559
I hate cricket, too.

658
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,686
And I suck at it.

659
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,486
I'm Rinku.

660
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,681
I'm Dinesh.

661
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,724
If you win, what are you
going to do with the money?

662
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,359
I'm gonna buy my father a new truck.

663
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,839
I understand.

664
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,559
You should get him a driver, too.

665
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,606
Maybe I will.

666
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,124
Hello, people!

667
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,924
<i>Let's play</i> Million Dollar Arm!

668
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,449
<i>Okay, please welcome
our 20 finalists.</i>

669
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,359
This is exciting! I can't
believe we got this far.

670
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,599
We?

671
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,319
Hey, somebody had to hold
down the fort, all right?

672
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,239
I'm here now though.
Look, at this! This is amazing!

673
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,759
What's this got to do
with throwing a baseball?

674
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,279
It's like some kind of circus.

675
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,279
<i>Let's give them all
a round of applause!</i>

676
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,859
<i>They've all worked
very hard to get here.</i>

677
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,319
<i>All right, the time has now come</i>

678
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,799
<i>to separate the men from the boys.</i>

679
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,919
<i>Before we start the game,</i>

680
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,679
<i>I just want to quickly run
through all the rules.</i>

681
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,639
<i>Each player gets 10 throws.</i>

682
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,479
<i>They will be judged on speed,
with bonus points for strikes.</i>

683
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,959
<i>Both the first and the
second place winners</i>

684
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,799
<i>will travel to the United States.</i>

685
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,299
<i>So let's make a rumble!</i>

686
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,359
Can we get sued for that?

687
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,803
It's entirely possible.

688
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,124
<i>Seventy-eight! Not bad for
the first pitch of the day.</i>

689
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,320
Oh!

690
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,246
<i>- Seventy-nine!</i>
- Nice.

691
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,119
<i>Eighty-one! Not bad.</i>

692
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,644
<i>That puts Hement Sharma
in second place.</i>

693
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,440
<i>Oh, seventy-five. Not quite fast
enough for a professional pitcher.</i>

694
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,919
<i>Eighty-two! That will take Avinash
Mehta to the number-one position.</i>

695
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,719
<i>The contest is really heating up,</i>

696
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,527
<i>with just two
contestants left to go.</i>

697
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,640
<i>Next up, Dinesh Kumar Patel!</i>

698
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,639
<i>Eighty-four!
Our fastest pitch of the day.</i>

699
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,599
<i>And a perfect strike,
which gives him bonus points.</i>

700
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,361
He's gonna be good.

701
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,921
Whoo!

702
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,079
<i>Eighty-six! But no strike.</i>

703
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,011
<i>Eighty-five!</i>

704
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,159
<i>Eighty-seven. Still no strike.</i>

705
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,479
Wow! This kid is throwing hard!

706
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,923
No, he's throwing wild.
It could cost him.

707
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,159
<i>Oh, eighty-five!</i>

708
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,679
<i>That just put Dinesh
Kumar Patel in first place</i>

709
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,605
<i>with just one more contestant
and $100,000 on the line!</i>

710
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,330
<i>And finally our last
contestant, Rinku Singh.</i>

711
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,730
- This is the lefty.
- We call him The Flamingo.

712
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,059
Is he gonna throw the ball
or is he gonna stand there?

713
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,210
<i>Eighty-three, and a perfect
strike. That's a strong start.</i>

714
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,961
<i>- Eighty-five! But no strike.</i>
- All right.

715
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,364
<i>A strike, at 82.</i>

716
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,199
<i>Another strike! Eighty-four!</i>

717
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,919
Well, it's gonna be close, but I still
have the spark plug ahead on points.

718
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,079
- Dinesh Patel?
- Yeah.

719
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,719
So, wait, what has the lefty
gotta do to win this thing?

720
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,079
Ninety-six wild,
or a perfect strike over 84.

721
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,205
He's got no shot at 96.

722
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,287
Perfect strike's gonna
be hard under pressure.

723
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,759
Bingo.

724
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,119
<i>A perfect strike!</i>

725
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,439
Yes!

726
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,599
<i>And the winner,</i>

727
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,330
<i>based on his speed and
accuracy, is Rinku Singh!</i>

728
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,559
<i>He's won $100,000 US,
a trip to America,</i>

729
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,779
<i>and a tryout with a Major
League Baseball team!</i>

730
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,239
<i>And in second place, winning $10,000</i>

731
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,519
<i>and also a chance to train in
the United States of America,</i>

732
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,539
<i>is our wonderful Dinesh Kumar Patel!</i>

733
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,039
<i>Congratulations! Well done!</i>

734
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,599
We did it, partner.
We really did it!

735
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,519
We did. Thank you, Ray.

736
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,359
Okay, I'm gonna say my goodbyes

737
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,679
and work my way over to an airplane.

738
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,479
- What, are you leaving?
- Yes.

739
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,163
My job is over and my
Barcalounger calls.

740
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,969
He's a strange man.

741
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,051
Yes, he is.

742
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,879
We're already getting tons
of good press about this.

743
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,244
Even Chang is happy.

744
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,663
Wow. These guys really
live in the sticks, huh?

745
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,726
Yes.

746
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,119
You are giving them a
great opportunity, JB.

747
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,839
Well, it's a great opportunity
for all of us, Vivek.

748
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,039
The potential of this
thing is off the chart.

749
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,839
This is the stuff
dreams are made of.

750
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,279
Yes, but, JB, these boys
from these villages,

751
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,479
they don't have these dreams.

752
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,321
They don't even leave
their villages.

753
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,010
So it's life-changing for them.

754
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,323
And for you, it's a
great responsibility.

755
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,449
I wish you well.

756
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,966
Thanks, Vivek.

757
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,799
- I mean, right?
- Yeah, this is intense.

758
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,479
I mean... Oh, look.
A cow is going in the house.

759
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,719
Pretty sure that's a bull

760
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,919
and I'm pretty sure they go
wherever they want. Hi! Whoa!

761
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,099
What?

762
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,842
<i>- No hablo</i> Hindi.
<i>- No hablo?</i>

763
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,650
Dad, do you like it?

764
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,599
Do they know you don't play cricket?

765
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:26,127
They know. It doesn't matter,
the contest is over.

766
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,519
It's nice...

767
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,441
but I don't need a new truck.

768
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,730
Dad...

769
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,570
I have to go to America.

770
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,886
I know you will make me proud.

771
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,499
The mother and uncle.

772
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,089
This is the kitchen and
pantry sort of a thing.

773
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,484
This is his room.

774
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,086
- Hi.
- Hi, everybody.

775
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,889
Thank you. Thank you. Wow.

776
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,131
There it is.

777
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,079
- That's a sharp look.
- What do you think?

778
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,603
Can't be the first time.
I got a huge head.

779
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,639
She doesn't seem very
happy about this.

780
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,519
No. What's up with that?

781
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,539
She just hit pay dirt.

782
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,079
She wants you to take
good care of him, JB.

783
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,639
She says he hasn't been away
from his village, you know.

784
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,719
She's really worried about him.

785
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,919
Yes, yes, of course, of course.

786
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,570
He's gonna have a great
time in LA. Lots of fun.

787
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,759
Ready, bud? Let's go. All right.

788
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,691
Thanks, everybody.

789
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,479
I'm sorry about this traffic.

790
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,159
There's nothing I
could do about that.

791
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,239
This is nothing.
We're actually moving.

792
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,159
And there's no honking. No honking.

793
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,479
Hey. I'm gonna have these
two over to the house

794
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,319
to watch some cricket.
It'll be nice to watch it

795
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,059
with somebody who
appreciates it for once.

796
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,124
He wants to watch cricket with you.

797
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,759
Actually, they don't like cricket.

798
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,119
What do you mean
they don't like cricket?

799
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,159
- I mean, they don't like cricket.
- They play cricket.

800
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,206
No. He plays javelin.
He plays field hockey.

801
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,839
- Wait. What?
- Yes.

802
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,279
You didn't know this?

803
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,245
No. I thought they
all played cricket.

804
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,319
- "They all played cricket?"
- What, now I'm a racist?

805
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,839
- It sounded a little bit racist.
- It's not racist.

806
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,519
There's 1.8 billion
people in this country

807
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,159
and they all love cricket.

808
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,199
Most of them love cricket.
Aash, this was your idea.

809
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,159
Well, it looks like
somebody dropped the ball.

810
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,279
You like cricket, right?

811
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,199
No, I love baseball.

812
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,999
Oh, unbelievable.

813
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,159
- No, believe me.
- Yeah, I believe you.

814
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,559
You're all gonna watch cricket.

815
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,879
- Come on, guys.
- You'll love this place.

816
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,606
Bye.

817
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,083
No, no, no. This side, this side.

818
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,485
Hold that, please.

819
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,319
- Thanks.
- Sure. Floor?

820
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,579
Five.

821
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,050
Okay. All right.
Guys, let 'em close.

822
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,839
Okay, so I'll pick
you guys up at 8:30

823
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,579
for your first day of
practice tomorrow.

824
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,099
If there's any trouble,
Amit's room is right next door.

825
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,599
I'm not sure what that means,
but we're gonna get some sleep,

826
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,379
and then I'll see you
guys in the morning.

827
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,059
- Great.
- All right.

828
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,719
Big TV.

829
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,482
- Let's go! Hey!
- Yes, sir.

830
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,324
Bye. Good night.

831
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,599
All right, Amit,
I'm gonna give you this

832
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,999
because I want you to
record their progress.

833
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,959
- For me? Wow!
- Yes, for you to use.

834
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,039
And then you're gonna
give it back to me.

835
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,119
Oh.

836
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,479
I want you to tape their
workouts, their training,

837
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,319
their daily lives, stuff like that.

838
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,799
I'm gonna use it as
a marketing tool.

839
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,119
Got it?

840
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,799
Yes, got it. Record everything.

841
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,399
If there are any
problems, you call me.

842
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,128
Yes, yes. I will call
you with problem.

843
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,919
So I'll see you tomorrow morning.

844
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,285
Okay. Goodbye, JB sir.
Goodbye, Aash sir.

845
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,879
They're gonna be fine
by themselves, right?

846
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,239
Yeah, course. What do you mean?

847
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,279
I mean, you know,
it's their first time here.

848
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,451
- You saw where they came from.
- They're fine.

849
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,919
Good night.

850
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,679
- Really?
- Oh, boy.

851
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,361
Yeah.

852
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,327
Hey.

853
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,199
Hey. Welcome home.

854
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,439
Thank you. It is good to be back.

855
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,759
- Yeah.
- I got you something.

856
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,010
- Really?
- Yes. It's...

857
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,719
I brought you the Taj Mahal.

858
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,719
I worked a deal with
the Indian government.

859
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,199
This is amazing. I love it.

860
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,479
I have been needing
a mini Taj for so long.

861
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,839
It's beautiful. Thank you.

862
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,239
So you gotta tell me
how it all finished.

863
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,764
Uh... Well, I thought we were gonna
do that over a bottle of Scotch.

864
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,399
You're right. We did have
a deal. We had that deal.

865
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,319
- Hey.
- Oh. Um...

866
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,359
- You must be JB.
- I am. Hi.

867
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,919
JB, Mark. Mark, JB.

868
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,799
Hey, man, great to meet you.
And welcome home.

869
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,079
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

870
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,959
- Careful. You're sweaty.
- Sorry, babe.

871
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,719
I actually spent three
months in an ashram in Goa.

872
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,439
I forgot that you did that. Yeah.

873
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,079
- Is that a mini Taj?
- Yeah, look at that.

874
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,599
Hilarious. Nice.

875
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,439
Yeah. I think it's so pretty.

876
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,199
Well, I gotta take a
shower before my shift.

877
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,479
- I just wanted to say hi.
- Yes, you do.

878
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,639
Cool. Nice to meet you.

879
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,446
- You as well. See you, babe.
- See you.

880
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,199
Love the Taj.

881
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,399
Mark's an intern at the hospital.

882
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,923
That's how we first met, so...

883
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,679
- Seems like a great guy.
- Yeah, he is a good guy.

884
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,442
- Seems very fit.
- Yeah, he's a runner.

885
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,279
Well, I gotta unpack and
plug back in and kind of...

886
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,559
Yeah, but I wanna hear about your
trip, so whenever you have...

887
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,571
- We'll do that.
- Okay, good.

888
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,251
All right. Thank you
so much for my...

889
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,206
Hello, old friend.

890
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,999
Hello.

891
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,999
Apparently, they pushed
the stop button by mistake

892
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,519
and when the elevator got stuck,

893
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,599
they panicked and pushed
the elevator alarm.

894
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,479
- And then the fire alarm.
- Yes. Okay.

895
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,839
We're not going to press
charges, Mr. Bernstein,

896
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,879
providing that you make other
arrangements for these young men.

897
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,159
When would that have to happen?

898
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,046
Immediately.

899
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,840
No filming here.

900
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,601
Sorry.

901
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,879
What are we gonna do?

902
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,739
I told you, they can't
stay on their own.

903
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,759
Fine. Then I'm dropping
them off with you.

904
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,879
<i>No. Are you crazy?
Come on, I have kids.</i>

905
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,519
I have no room, all right? You have
lots of room. Please go to sleep.

906
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,239
Yeah, and I also have a
very nice single person's life

907
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,319
that I'm really looking
forward to getting back to.

908
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,479
All right. Well, you know what?

909
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,799
Look on the bright side.

910
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,399
We're out of money,
so you keeping them

911
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,679
will help us keep our doors open.

912
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,681
- Good night.
- No. Don't hang up.

913
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,846
Go to sleep!

914
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,489
All right, let's go.

915
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,084
D...

916
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,084
Don't touch anything.

917
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,779
- Okay, boys, here we are. Come on in.
- Wow.

918
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,799
This is his house?

919
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,879
All right, we're gonna
keep you guys here

920
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,319
until we figure something out.

921
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,239
This is the living room, TV.

922
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,519
This is the TV.
A thousand-something channels.

923
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,819
Maybe there's some Indian ones.

924
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,179
This is where we eat.

925
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,559
Food. Kitchen.

926
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,879
Plenty of stuff in the fridge.

927
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,130
Please help yourself.

928
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,099
Now... Hey, guys.

929
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,599
Oh. Oh.

930
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,099
I just have one rule. Try to
keep everything nice and neat.

931
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,299
Try not to break anything,
okay? Nice and neat.

932
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,759
Great. Good night.

933
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,488
But, JB sir, um...

934
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,259
Where is your family?

935
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,319
- No family, Amit. Just me.
- Huh?

936
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,001
Just me.

937
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,043
Is she his servant?

938
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,079
She must be.

939
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,719
Well, I overslept.

940
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,448
I think I'm still pretty jet-lagged.

941
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,079
Well, call House and tell him
we're running a few minutes late.

942
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,806
Yeah.

943
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,199
Guys, what are you doing?
Why didn't you wake me up?

944
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,167
Good morning, JB sir. We were
waiting for you for breakfast.

945
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,604
Okay. Okay. Uh...

946
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,086
Breakfast.

947
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,519
What's with all the
candles, by the way?

948
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,885
That's our shrine, JB sir,
so that we can pray.

949
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,639
- Oh, right.
- And where do you pray, JB sir?

950
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,679
I don't pray. I work. And I'm late.

951
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,039
So five minutes. We gotta hustle.

952
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,199
Right, JB sir. Five minutes. Ready.

953
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,804
PowerBar. Big body. Eat, eat, eat.

954
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,319
JB sir, what is the
meaning of "hustle"?

955
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,839
It means hurry up,
you know, go fast.

956
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,383
Oh, okay, okay.

957
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,729
Hustle?

958
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,759
All right, boys, let's go.
Double time.

959
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,019
Here we are.
Day one of training at USC.

960
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,199
- Hey, hey. Look at the boys.
- Sorry, sorry.

961
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,639
We're gonna be a little
late, but that's okay.

962
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,159
You guys are gonna come here
from 9:00 to 1:00 every day

963
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,539
and work with Coach House
and the USC team, got it?

964
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,399
JB likes to hustle.

965
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,685
All right. Here we go.

966
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,126
Not bad, huh?

967
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,809
It's absolutely beautiful, JB sir.

968
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,619
Soak it in.

969
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,959
And now let's go.
We're late. Let's go!

970
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,244
You must be the boys from India.

971
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,879
Welcome to America.

972
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,119
I'm Tom House. I'll be your coach.

973
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,779
This is my assistant, Doug.

974
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,719
Still working on their English.

975
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,079
Tell them, I thought today
we'd just run a few drills

976
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,039
and have some fun. What do you say?

977
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,802
The boys are gonna blow
you away, Tom, I promise.

978
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,719
What is this?

979
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,039
I think it's used to keep
our bowling hand warm.

980
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,379
Tell the boys the glove
is for catching the ball!

981
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,879
Okay, now, you're just gonna
toss it back and forth.

982
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,450
Just nice and easy. Nice and easy.

983
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,999
- Where have you been?
- Sorry, man.

984
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,399
The twins, they've been
puking all morning.

985
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,879
- How's it going here?
- Uh...

986
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,324
He's asking, is it necessary
to wear the gloves?

987
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,684
That's a first.

988
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,199
All right, tell him half-speed.
We're just warming up.

989
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,087
It's not about throwing hard,
it's about throwing right.

990
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,839
- Oh, oh, oh.
- It's all right. It's all right.

991
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,019
Tell him to relax.
Tell him to smile.

992
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,921
Wow.

993
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,051
- We might have to tweak that a little bit.
- Hmm.

994
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,799
It was like they couldn't even
tie their shoes out there.

995
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,039
Thank God, Chang didn't see that.

996
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,159
All right, okay, look.
What do you think, Tom?

997
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,999
They did everything
I asked 'em to do.

998
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,079
They didn't complain.
They never quit.

999
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,479
They're good athletes.

1000
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,004
And more importantly,
their arms work.

1001
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,483
Do you think you can have
them ready in six months?

1002
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,768
Based on what I just saw,

1003
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,561
probably not.

1004
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,639
<i>Spencer asked me to
move in with him.</i>

1005
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,519
No way.

1006
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,779
No way, Spencer.

1007
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:36,086
Spencer is a funny name.

1008
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,685
Hey, guys.

1009
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,879
Are you guys gonna take
these or just stare at me?

1010
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,079
Guys, come on. Guys, it's pizza.

1011
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,439
All right, come on.

1012
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,239
Are you from Mars or what?
That's a pizza. You eat it.

1013
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,126
Sorry, brother.

1014
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,041
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

1015
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,048
I've fallen in love with pizza.

1016
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,839
We're screwed.

1017
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:24,679
JB is going to pack our
bags and send us home.

1018
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,647
Dinesh, don't worry so.

1019
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,484
We can't master it in one day.

1020
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,488
Don't you miss home?

1021
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,400
I do miss it.

1022
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,526
But now we are in America.
We can do anything here.

1023
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,119
You can even change your name to...

1024
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,721
Spencer.

1025
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,359
I don't want to change my name.

1026
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,799
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Where are you going?

1027
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:01,928
I'm going to the bathroom.
Don't worry, I'm not leaving you.

1028
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,285
Oh!

1029
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,925
- JB!
- Oh, crap.

1030
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,410
- Okay, boys, knock 'em dead.
- Okay, JB sir.

1031
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,119
- Bye, JB sir.
- That's good.

1032
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,239
Keep working on the English.
I'll see you later.

1033
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,683
He's not staying to watch us today?

1034
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,969
I guess not.

1035
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,679
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I did. You didn't listen to me.

1036
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,039
You were too busy
bribing half of India.

1037
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,119
- I didn't have a choice.
- Then guess what?

1038
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,879
We're out of money, JB.

1039
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,719
And not to mention that Chang
has been calling me all morning.

1040
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,519
He wants a status update.
What am I supposed to do? Come clean?

1041
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,639
No, no. Don't come clean.

1042
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,879
- Never come clean.
- Seven Figures Management.

1043
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,481
That's probably Chang right now.

1044
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,319
Sure, um, hold on just one second.

1045
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,001
JB, it's Popo.

1046
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,365
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1047
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,410
Hey. What's up?

1048
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,086
Really?

1049
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,639
Stay right there.
I'm leaving right now.

1050
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,179
Okay. Bye.

1051
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,519
Pope's not happy with Procorp,

1052
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,039
so he wants to talk to me about it.

1053
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,959
So I'm gonna go talk to him,
and then I'll call you guys later.

1054
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,199
Yes! Yes! If you can
get Popo, we're back!

1055
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,239
- Yeah.
- Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1056
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,921
Ow. Sorry.

1057
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,568
Okay, tell me, single to left.

1058
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,239
No, no, no, no. English.

1059
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,365
Single to left. Come on.

1060
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,239
Back third base.

1061
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,919
- Back up third base. Good.
- Back up third base.

1062
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,039
- I'm hungry.
- JB sir is coming soon.

1063
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,499
Let's concentrate on work.
Tell me, single to left.

1064
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,479
I'm tired, I'm hungry
and JB is late.

1065
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,366
No, no, no, English.

1066
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,479
- I'm hungry.
- Hold on. Hold on.

1067
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,959
Hey, guys. Come on. Let's go.
I'm sorry I'm late. I had a meeting.

1068
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,641
Let's go. Let's go.

1069
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,439
So, we'll work with Popo
for couple of months

1070
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,919
till he finds out
we're the real deal.

1071
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,599
And then we get the contract.
Yeah, hold on.

1072
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,799
Guys, hustle up! Let's go!
We'll get pizza. Come on.

1073
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,959
Let's go.

1074
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,839
Pizza again? He's killing me.

1075
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,442
I don't care. I like pizza.

1076
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,605
Morning, Rinku. Morning, Dinesh.

1077
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,726
Oh!

1078
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,199
So today's my day off,

1079
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,609
so that means I absolutely
have to clean my house.

1080
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,199
Boring. Uh...

1081
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,849
So what about you guys?
How's the baseball going?

1082
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,119
- Is that music?
- Yeah. This is my iPod.

1083
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,119
For when I run. What kind
of music do you guys like?

1084
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,499
I... I like...

1085
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,079
- Keith... Keith Urban.
- Keith...

1086
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,879
- What?
- Keith Urban.

1087
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,779
Keith Urban? Wow. I did not
expect you to say that.

1088
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,799
I... I like Eminem.
Eminem is good, you know?

1089
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,319
Eminem? That's literally what
I'm listening to now. Here.

1090
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,524
- I can see?
- Yeah, yeah.

1091
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,019
Ready?

1092
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:11,079
So, come on, how's the baseball
going? It looks awesome.

1093
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,279
- It's not good.
- Really?

1094
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,850
Baseball is very hard.

1095
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,759
JB sir don't like the way we play.

1096
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,559
Why do you say that? Why?

1097
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,687
He don't... He don't come to watch.

1098
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,079
You see, that's just
'cause he's a busy guy.

1099
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,239
I don't think it's 'cause
he doesn't want to.

1100
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,279
Hey, guys,

1101
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,079
come on, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

1102
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,365
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hi. Have a good day.

1103
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,251
Keith Urban. Hmm.

1104
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,199
One of the kids, Manny,
called Rinku a name.

1105
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,479
Dinesh didn't like it. So, he shoved
him. And they tussled a bit.

1106
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,239
- What did he call him?
- That's not the point.

1107
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,003
The point is, these boys aren't
gelling. They're struggling.

1108
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,999
And if you were here
more, you'd see that.

1109
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,359
Tom, I'd love to be here more.

1110
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,999
Work has been crazy.
You know what I do.

1111
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,206
Look, a big part of
this training is up here.

1112
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,719
These kids, they need to
be in the right head space.

1113
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,810
They need to feel supported.

1114
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,921
They need to be having fun.
You understand that?

1115
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,279
Yes, of course I do, Tom.

1116
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,167
Yes, it makes sense. Thank you.

1117
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,639
Yes, Rinku, the new
phone is working.

1118
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,119
Are you listening to Mr. Bernstein?

1119
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:31,959
Yes, JB is a very nice man,
and he is taking good care of us.

1120
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,561
Hey.

1121
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,039
Okay, as soon as Rinku gets
off the phone, we're going out.

1122
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,799
- We're gonna have some fun.
- Okay, JB sir.

1123
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:45,088
Everyone is thinking of you.
We are all so excited.

1124
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,005
I think of you a lot.

1125
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,280
I miss you.

1126
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,284
I have to go to work.

1127
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:07,163
- Is this a hotel?
- No. This is your future.

1128
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,206
And hopefully mine,
if things go well tonight.

1129
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,685
Not bad, huh?

1130
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,326
- JB! My man.
- There he is.

1131
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,119
- How you feeling?
- Good.

1132
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,639
Boys, this is Popo Vanuatu,

1133
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,759
one of the greatest
linebackers in the NFL.

1134
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,399
- What's up, dude?
- Food and drink is that way.

1135
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,159
But I'm gonna steal my man
JB here and talk business.

1136
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,239
Okay, yeah, cool. Guys,
just hang tight. I'll be right back.

1137
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,604
Have fun. Have fun.

1138
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,239
Hey, Popo. What are the
Procorp boys doing here?

1139
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,049
It's a party, JB. They came.
Don't sweat that.

1140
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,769
This is my special place, man.

1141
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,162
Only for my nearest and dearest.

1142
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,379
I'm honored, bro.

1143
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,479
We have practice tomorrow.
Should we leave now?

1144
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,759
I think I ate too much.

1145
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,839
I told you not to!

1146
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,119
You're eating cow, lamb, pig
and who knows what else.

1147
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:34,039
I'm bored. I eat when I'm bored.

1148
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,359
Hello, brother!

1149
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,919
This is a crazy party, man!
Let's enjoy it, man!

1150
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,363
Let's do some noise! Like this!

1151
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,479
And then my grandpapa
would just look at me,

1152
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,339
and he had these crazy
bushy eyebrows.

1153
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,339
But it was real, you know?

1154
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,899
Yeah. Yes, I do.

1155
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,085
And then he looked
at me and he said,

1156
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,531
"Go be, Popo." Just like that.

1157
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,368
"Go be."

1158
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,731
Wow. That is, that is deep.

1159
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,719
I'm so sorry. I have to
take this. It's the boys.

1160
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,890
Hey. What's up, Amit?

1161
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,001
What?

1162
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,639
Why did you drink the punch
if you don't drink alcohol?

1163
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,447
I didn't know it was
alcohol, JB sir.

1164
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,890
I'm... I'm sorry.

1165
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,479
JB sir, can you slow
it down, please?

1166
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,679
- I'm not feeling very good.
- That's too bad.

1167
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,239
I was in the middle of
something very important.

1168
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,199
And for the record, I don't
care that you drank alcohol.

1169
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,719
I just care that you then decided to
go swimming in someones fountain.

1170
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,279
- I don't feel too good, JB sir.
- Did you drink, too?

1171
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,159
- I ate too much.
- Well, I'm not slowing down.

1172
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,559
I've gotta get back to that party.

1173
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,146
JB sir,

1174
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,879
I think I'm going to...

1175
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,239
No, no, don't you dare!

1176
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,001
Do not... No!

1177
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,199
That's better.

1178
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,529
Could we have some water?

1179
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,485
Thanks. Sorry.

1180
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,039
- There we go. Congrats.
- Thank you.

1181
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,005
What's going on here?

1182
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,241
JB.

1183
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,451
This is just business.

1184
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,521
Go to bed.

1185
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,846
- I am sorry, JB sir.
- What?

1186
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,486
- Sorry.
- You're sorry?

1187
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,959
You're sorry that I just lost
my biggest client in years

1188
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,839
because you guys decided
to wander off and trespass

1189
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,399
on someone's private property,
swim in their fountain

1190
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,179
and, oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
puke on me, twice!

1191
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,651
Shush! You can translate it later.

1192
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,519
How about instead of being sorry,

1193
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,759
you guys do what you
were brought here to do,

1194
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,850
which is learn the game?

1195
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,479
Which, according to Mr. House,

1196
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,128
you're not even close to doing that.

1197
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,480
So go to bed.

1198
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,881
And no more TV. Ever.

1199
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,927
Are you okay?

1200
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,127
Yes.

1201
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,046
Had a bad night.

1202
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,206
Yeah, I see that.

1203
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,760
Do you want a beer?

1204
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,239
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

1205
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,839
I was supposed to run a contest,

1206
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,839
not become a primary caregiver.

1207
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,679
My house is a mess,
the pool is filthy,

1208
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,770
my car smells like puke.

1209
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,279
I'm late to everything.
I can't even spell sex.

1210
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,599
You sound like every one
of my married friends.

1211
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,839
But I'm not married.
I don't wanna be married.

1212
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,124
All right, Mr. Sensitive.

1213
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,359
I think you just need
to accept the fact that

1214
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,879
your life's gonna be different
for a couple of months.

1215
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,319
And then it's gonna go
back to your old life.

1216
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,639
Yeah, but there may not be
an old life to go back to

1217
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,399
if this doesn't work out.
That's what you don't understand.

1218
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,480
This thing, these kids...

1219
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,119
This is my last best shot.

1220
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,879
Come on. You got your big house,

1221
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,159
your fancy car.
You're gonna be fine.

1222
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,719
No, I am miles away from fine.

1223
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,199
All this stuff is from my old
life, when I made money,

1224
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,407
before I stupidly decided
to go out on my own.

1225
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,324
I can barely pay my bills.

1226
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,241
- Really?
- Really.

1227
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,926
Sorry.

1228
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,964
Okay, so if they're your last shot,

1229
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,079
then don't you think
you should be paying

1230
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,799
a little more attention to 'em?

1231
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,239
I mean, it's not like it's easy
for these guys, you know.

1232
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,879
They're far from home.
They miss their families.

1233
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,879
- How do you know all this?
- 'Cause they told me.

1234
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,359
You talk to them?

1235
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,086
Yeah, I talk to them.

1236
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,008
They just need to see that you care.

1237
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,049
Yeah, maybe I need to create a...

1238
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,442
Create a better environment
for their success.

1239
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,644
Something like that, yeah.

1240
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,250
You just need to commit to it and
then you'll figure out the rest.

1241
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,563
Speaking of committing, how is Mike?

1242
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,765
- Mark.
- Mark.

1243
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,601
We broke up.

1244
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,919
To committing.

1245
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,726
To committing.

1246
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,565
How we doing?

1247
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,886
Amit, Amit, Amit.

1248
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,207
Five. All right, and again.
Cross it over.

1249
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,641
That's a lot.

1250
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,489
<i>Today I consider myself</i>

1251
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,325
<i>the luckiest man</i>

1252
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,290
<i>on the face of the Earth.</i>

1253
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,971
This is the saddest
movie I've ever seen.

1254
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,130
How are you not crying right now?

1255
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,279
I cried the first 35
times I watched it.

1256
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,041
Right.

1257
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,925
Oh, boy, these guys are...

1258
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,759
They're wiped. They're done.

1259
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,930
They've been working very hard.

1260
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,362
- Where's Amit?
- He's compiling his notes.

1261
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,360
He wants to coach baseball.

1262
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,799
Either that or he's starting
an outsource center.

1263
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,639
I can't determine which. There's a lot
of activity happening in that room.

1264
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,039
- Stop.
- It's a great idea.

1265
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,919
It's the first in-country
outsource center.

1266
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,079
That is hilarious.

1267
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,681
Shh.

1268
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,459
You shh. You shh.

1269
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,571
Do you... Do you wanna get a drink?

1270
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,879
Come on in.

1271
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,166
All right, so this
should impress you.

1272
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,369
- Wow.
- Yeah. No, I know.

1273
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,719
I know. It's a bit messy.

1274
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,439
I just have not a lot
of time to organize

1275
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,519
because I'm either
going to the hospital

1276
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,519
or I'm coming back
from running or yoga.

1277
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:19,248
Hey, The Taj has some
prime real estate.

1278
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,730
Yeah, I love my mini Taj.

1279
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,407
Scotch okay?

1280
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,759
Fine.

1281
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,521
Great.

1282
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,319
Who are these fine ladies?

1283
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,719
Oh, those are my sisters.

1284
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,599
- Yeah, I've got five.
- Five?

1285
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,123
- Yeah.
- Wow. I didn't know that.

1286
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:40,640
Well, before India, we never
really talked, you know.

1287
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,739
Yeah, why is that?

1288
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,599
Well, I don't wanna offend you,

1289
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,328
but I just never was really
interested in talking to you.

1290
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,319
I am offended.

1291
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,719
Don't be.

1292
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:58,928
You're just... You're just
different than you were before.

1293
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,479
I don't feel different.

1294
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,923
Really? 'Cause your Porsche
looks like a minivan.

1295
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,446
Minivans are the new black.

1296
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,039
See? It's good. This whole

1297
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,959
alternative family thing

1298
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,079
looks good on you.

1299
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,959
I mean, it's changed you.

1300
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,641
How has it changed me?

1301
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,159
I don't wanna ruin it.
I'm having too much fun watching.

1302
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,604
Come on, tell me.
Tell me how it's changed me.

1303
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,759
Well, that was more
than just watching.

1304
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,771
Yes, it was.

1305
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,524
Good morning, Mr. JB sir.

1306
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,322
Very good morning, Mr. JB sir.

1307
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,559
Hello.

1308
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,810
Leaving in 20 minutes, guys.

1309
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,519
All right, go ahead.

1310
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,345
Say it.

1311
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,199
Sir, we need to know when you're
going to marry Ms. Brenda.

1312
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,559
- Yes.
- No, guys.

1313
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,079
This is not what you ask in America.

1314
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,727
What do you ask?

1315
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,639
You would say, "How far did
you get with Ms. Brenda?"

1316
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,919
You traveled with her?

1317
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,519
No, no, no, it's not a distance.

1318
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,199
It's, like, physically,
like, "Did you kiss her?"

1319
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,211
- Like...
- Huh?

1320
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,719
But that's private, no, sir?

1321
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,879
Yes, it is private. Thank you.

1322
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,999
I think you should marry Ms. Brenda.

1323
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,479
Even I also think.

1324
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,969
Yes, sir. You are old.

1325
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,759
You should marry her,
start family...

1326
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,439
Number one, I am not old.

1327
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,405
You're a little bit old.

1328
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,599
Hey. Number two,

1329
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,319
just because I've slept
over at her house

1330
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,519
doesn't mean I have to marry her.

1331
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,121
Mmm...

1332
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,379
Did you kiss Ms. Brenda?

1333
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,681
No.

1334
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,799
- She kissed me.
- Oh!

1335
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,019
Oh, JB sir!

1336
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,721
Oh, my God!

1337
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,319
Yeah, well, enjoy the game, Mike,

1338
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,241
and I'll have Aash follow
up with you on that.

1339
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,570
You got it, pal. Bye.

1340
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,039
JB, it's Chang.

1341
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,721
Tell him I'm not here.

1342
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,199
He's pushing for a tryout and
we need to stall, stall, stall.

1343
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,609
That might be tricky.

1344
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,159
Their progress has been...

1345
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,127
- Remarkable.
- Yeah. Yep. Amazing.

1346
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,483
By my calendar, we should hold
the tryout in three weeks, right?

1347
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,279
Uh, well,

1348
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,959
you know, to be honest,

1349
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,530
even given their
remarkable progress,

1350
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,329
they could probably
use a little more time.

1351
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,039
We could all benefit from
more time, Mr. Bernstein,

1352
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,563
but it wasn't our agreement, was it?

1353
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,721
No.

1354
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,926
So are you gonna honor
our agreement or not?

1355
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,727
Absolutely.

1356
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,209
They will be ready in three weeks.

1357
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,119
Excellent.

1358
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,999
Horse crap! We had a deal.
We were gonna do this right.

1359
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,999
We are! This way we
get maximum exposure.

1360
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,239
<i>ESPN, Sports Illustrated</i>,
NBC, ABC, they're all gonna be there.

1361
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,479
I mean right by Rinku and Dinesh.

1362
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,919
They're not ready for
this kind of pressure.

1363
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,439
Tom, every scout in the Major
Leagues will be in Tempe

1364
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,119
- for the November meetings.
- Well, that's my point.

1365
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,079
Taking them to Tempe,
out of their comfort zone?

1366
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,599
Putting them in front
of a media circus?

1367
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,486
They'll be a sideshow.

1368
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,159
I appreciate your input, Tom,

1369
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,519
but this is business.

1370
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,039
I have a deal with my investors

1371
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,039
and I have to live up to
that deal. That's what I do.

1372
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,687
You understand?

1373
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,465
Perfectly.

1374
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:04,279
Oh! Can't use ASU's field.
Too many liabilities.

1375
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,399
Why are we hearing about this
right now, three days out?

1376
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,599
Hey! They told me it would work.

1377
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,079
It's fine. We can
find another place.

1378
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,519
All we need is a mound
and a cage. It's easy.

1379
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,759
- Theresa?
- Yeah?

1380
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,839
Where are we with the scout RSVPs?

1381
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,079
We are up to 24!

1382
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,159
There we go.

1383
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,279
- That's what I'm talking about.
- It's good.

1384
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,719
Twenty-four is good.

1385
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,243
Hey. What's up, Brenda?

1386
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,726
What?

1387
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,039
- Hey.
- Don't keep touching.

1388
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,959
- What the hell happened?
- It's not that bad.

1389
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,519
Yeah, it's fine.
He has two stitches.

1390
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,959
He's gonna live. The doctor said...

1391
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,759
It's on his pitching hand.

1392
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,879
How did this happen?

1393
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,919
Oh, um, well, I was just teaching
them how to make Mexican food

1394
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,119
and he was slicing a bell
pepper and he slipped and...

1395
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,479
- It's fine.
- Okay...

1396
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,919
I need to talk to
you outside, please.

1397
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,079
It's honestly okay.

1398
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,079
I need to talk to you
outside for one minute.

1399
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,959
- He will be fine.
- Amit, turn the camera off.

1400
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,279
- We're in a hospital.
- Sorry.

1401
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,359
- Sorry, JB sir.
- No, don't be sorry. We're fine.

1402
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,291
Let me just... Hang on.

1403
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,039
- Hey. What...
- Hey.

1404
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,359
Look, I appreciate all the
stuff you were trying to do.

1405
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,359
- But those guys are my investment.
- Okay.

1406
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,479
I have a lot riding
on their success.

1407
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,719
Obviously it was an accident.

1408
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:30,759
I understand that. That accident
might cost me a lot of money.

1409
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,159
If he can't pitch in three days.

1410
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,159
Okay, okay. Well, I don't
know how it works,

1411
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,519
but can't you push the tryout, or...

1412
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,599
You want me to push the tryout?

1413
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,919
You want me to call ESPN
and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>

1414
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,879
and half the world's media and
24-some-odd baseball clubs and go,

1415
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,319
"Guys, sorry, we can't
do it in a couple of days,

1416
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,479
"we're gonna need to do
it in a couple of weeks,

1417
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:48,479
"'cause one of my kids wanted
to learn how to make fajitas."

1418
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,570
Is that what you want
me to do? You're insane!

1419
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,359
Okay.

1420
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,679
I don't think I'm
being unreasonable.

1421
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,439
You're being a little unreasonable.

1422
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,879
But you're also being
a class-A jerk.

1423
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,039
I mean, I understand they're
your investments and everything,

1424
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,159
but they're also just
a couple of kids.

1425
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,762
"Kids" being the operative word.

1426
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,719
Well, <i>SI</i> is thinking
of doing a cover story,

1427
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,322
if all goes well.

1428
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,159
No, no. No, ESPN still
wants to do a feature

1429
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,809
for Outside the Lines. Yeah,
I just talked to the guy today.

1430
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,048
Hey. Hey, guys.

1431
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,321
Hey.

1432
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,399
All right, I just wanted to

1433
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,839
wish you guys all the best.

1434
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,999
I know you're gonna get out there
and you're gonna blow them away.

1435
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,001
Truly. All right, let's hug it out.

1436
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,126
This is what we do.
This is how we do it.

1437
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,319
- Thank you, Ms. Brenda.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1438
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,879
- Good luck.
- Thank you, madam.

1439
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,639
Okay, then I wanna hear all
about it when you get back.

1440
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,039
Hey! Come on, guys.
Let's load it up.

1441
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,279
- Bye.
- Good luck.

1442
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,519
We gotta go. Hey, hey, hey.
Can I talk to you for a second?

1443
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,919
Yeah. What's up?

1444
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,679
I just wanted to apologize
for the other day, you know.

1445
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:17,799
Oh!

1446
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,561
I've been under a lot of...

1447
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,439
I've been under a lot of
pressure with all this

1448
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,119
and I did not need to
take it out on you.

1449
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,599
Oh, I'm a big girl, JB.
I can handle you getting mad.

1450
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,043
I just don't like seeing that
side of you, that's all.

1451
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,801
What side is that?

1452
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,759
I don't know. The side
that puts the deal

1453
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:37,727
before everything else, I guess.

1454
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,639
Well, maybe that's just who I am.

1455
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,890
Maybe. I hope not.

1456
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,759
Safe travels.

1457
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,521
Knock 'em dead.

1458
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,642
It should be fine.
It shouldn't affect your cutter.

1459
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,251
Sir, I don't have a cutter.

1460
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,819
See?

1461
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,771
Sir, do you think we're ready?

1462
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,239
Doesn't matter what I
think, or anyone else.

1463
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,808
It only matters what you think.

1464
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,766
You understand?

1465
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,999
Here you go.

1466
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,199
Shouldn't this be ready already?

1467
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,404
It's getting there.
It's getting there, okay?

1468
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,964
Oh, Chang's here.

1469
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,839
Think he's wondering why
we're doing this in a strip mall?

1470
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,039
I don't know. I'll tell you what,

1471
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,879
do not talk to House
about this, okay?

1472
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,845
He is not happy.

1473
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,329
Well, too bad.

1474
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,399
Showtime, buddy.

1475
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,411
Let's do this, partner. Boom.

1476
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,039
- Are you nervous?
- Uh, no.

1477
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,559
Well, you shouldn't be,
because all of India is behind you.

1478
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,479
<i>- We will all be watching live.
- All?</i>

1479
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,799
<i>Yes, this feed will be seen...</i>

1480
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,919
Yes!

1481
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,679
<i>...by nearly half a billion people.</i>

1482
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,919
<i>And we know you'll
make India so proud.</i>

1483
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,268
<i>Thank you. Good luck.</i>

1484
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,559
Okay, thank you, guys,
all for coming out.

1485
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,439
Uh, believe it or not,
10 months ago,

1486
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,359
these two guys had never
even heard of baseball,

1487
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:37,239
much less picked one up
and tried to throw it.

1488
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,359
Uh, so, I'm pretty sure
you're gonna be blown away

1489
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,919
by what you see today.

1490
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:45,599
Uh, anyway, without further ado,
please welcome India's finest.

1491
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,399
First up, Dinesh Kumar Patel.

1492
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,128
- Let's go. Come on, buddy.
- Yeah! Whoo!

1493
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,879
- What's wrong?
- Sir, mound no good, sir.

1494
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,768
- What do you mean?
- Um... Sir, no rubber, sir.

1495
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,399
Don't worry about that,
okay? You got this.

1496
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,939
I want you to just relax and
throw your stuff, all right?

1497
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,319
Relax and throw your stuff.

1498
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,729
Right in there, all right?

1499
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,919
They were all over the place, JB.

1500
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,999
Yeah, but Pete, you gotta
see the potential here.

1501
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,719
Potential? Maybe from a
marketing perspective. Maybe.

1502
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,999
But this is Major League Baseball.

1503
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,319
This isn't some social experiment.

1504
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,684
I'm sorry. They're not
for the Mariners.

1505
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,362
- You're gonna regret this, Pete.
- Sorry.

1506
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,881
Mr. Bernstein.

1507
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,399
Mr. Chang, hey.

1508
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,919
Listen, they're a lot
better than that.

1509
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,679
I don't know what
happened out there.

1510
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:38,611
Congratulations.

1511
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,079
I'm sorry?

1512
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,839
You said one year to a
Major League tryout.

1513
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,959
- You did it.
- Yeah, but...

1514
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:49,360
Look, I'm satisfied. I will
extend our deal to three years.

1515
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,119
With all this attention,

1516
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:52,919
it can only help
<i>The Million Dollar Arm</i>

1517
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,239
be more visible in the future.

1518
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,365
These boys are done,
but there'll be others.

1519
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,401
Good day.

1520
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,319
Well, you got your deal.

1521
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:08,287
Maybe you can take the
boys out and celebrate.

1522
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:32,484
At least we get to see
our families soon, right?

1523
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,239
On the surface, guys,
this sounded like such a promising idea,

1524
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,679
and they even showed

1525
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,959
<i>some flashes of real brilliance.</i>

1526
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,119
<i>But in the end, I gotta
believe, at least right now,</i>

1527
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,679
<i>their chances of getting signed
by a Major League club</i>

1528
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:53,719
<i>fall between slim and none.</i>

1529
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,607
<i>More on how they thought
they did. Here's Steve Levy.</i>

1530
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,159
<i>Rinku, let's start with you.
After the way you pitched today,</i>

1531
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,569
<i>do you feel like it was
good enough to get signed?</i>

1532
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,921
<i>No, sir.</i>

1533
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,079
<i>Dinesh, what about you?</i>

1534
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,728
<i>No, sir. We did not pitch good.</i>

1535
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:12,199
<i>Hang in there, fellas.
Better times ahead.</i>

1536
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,759
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1537
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,719
<i>Look, this is a good idea.</i>

1538
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,199
<i>Someone from India is going
to pitch in the big leagues,</i>

1539
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,839
<i>but, Schill, not these guys
and certainly not right now.</i>

1540
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,799
<i>This felt like
a huge publicity stunt to me.</i>

1541
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,919
<i>I mean, these guys are
not ready for a pro tryout.</i>

1542
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,679
<i>They're throwing the ball
all over the place.</i>

1543
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,279
<i>When you think about it,
who can blame them?</i>

1544
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,723
<i>There's scouts,
there's media everywhere...</i>

1545
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,039
You were right.

1546
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:46,481
God. I did not...

1547
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,879
I did not see you there.

1548
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,211
Uh... Um, what was I right about?

1549
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,921
I'm a jerk.

1550
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:58,324
I've been one for a while now.

1551
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,841
Maybe my whole life.

1552
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:05,291
Um, yeah, I heard
about today. I'm sorry.

1553
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,239
How did you hear? SportsCenter?

1554
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,002
No. Rinku texted me.

1555
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,681
- What did he say?
- "We failed."

1556
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:20,443
I feel like I gave them this dream,

1557
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,679
and then just took
it away from them.

1558
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:26,039
So give it back to them,
you know. Do another tryout.

1559
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,846
That's impossible.

1560
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,279
The only reason I got this tryout

1561
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,530
was because people were curious.

1562
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,519
It was a stunt.

1563
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:37,479
Well, then maybe it is impossible.
Maybe you're right,

1564
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,079
but, then again,
so was going to India

1565
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,279
and pulling two kids
out of the sticks

1566
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,882
and turning them into baseball
players. So, I don't know.

1567
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:47,043
Good night, JB. Gotta go to bed.

1568
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,410
I don't understand.

1569
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,719
I need to have another tryout.

1570
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,402
- You will, next year.
- No, I need to have another tryout

1571
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,481
with Rinku and Dinesh.

1572
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,079
I need to give them a real shot.

1573
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,045
I cannot allow this.

1574
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,079
Your boys failed, yes,
but the contest did not.

1575
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,239
If it doesn't work,
it will ruin our relationship

1576
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,439
with Major League
Baseball and the scouts.

1577
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:39,283
It will jeopardize the
future of our investment.

1578
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:44,806
I'm sorry. I have to
do this, Mr. Chang.

1579
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,519
If you do this, you do
it without my support

1580
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:51,248
and without my future commitment.

1581
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,126
I understand.

1582
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,090
Good day, gentlemen.

1583
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:12,127
And for the record, Mr. Chang,

1584
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,201
my boys didn't fail.

1585
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,201
I did.

1586
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,319
Now you come clean.

1587
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,679
JB Bernstein's office
calling for Mr. Epstein.

1588
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,239
I know we already did this one time.

1589
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,279
Yeah, we're gonna do it again.

1590
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:32,119
Because they choked, all right?

1591
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:36,319
Yes, hey. How are you? No,
I don't wanna talk about Tempe.

1592
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,639
Don't talk to me about Tempe.

1593
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:39,879
Tempe's... Forget about
Tempe, all right?

1594
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,399
That is not... No, we are
gonna do this again.

1595
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,519
You had to see the potential.

1596
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,719
Hi. This is Theresa calling
from JB Bernstein's office

1597
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,599
for Mr. Rodriguez.

1598
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,719
Yep, it's JB Bernstein.

1599
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,399
Why are you giving me hard time?
You wanna be there.

1600
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,439
How about a billion
new fans, with a "B"?

1601
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,963
Great. Well, thank you.

1602
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,011
Okay. Bye-bye.

1603
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,529
Is anyone coming back?

1604
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:04,042
We got one "maybe."

1605
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,239
But 15 noes.

1606
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,446
And I'm tapped. I mean, I don't
know what else to do, JB.

1607
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,730
I do. Come on.

1608
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,399
Keep working the phones.

1609
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,399
We just need one.
The rest'll follow.

1610
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,162
- Where are you going?
- Tempe.

1611
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,599
Did we get any calls?

1612
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,279
No, no, me either.

1613
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,247
Striking out left, right and center.

1614
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,879
All right, well, let me
know if you hear anything.

1615
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:01,642
Yeah, fine. Bye.

1616
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:11,639
- What the hell?
- That's agent for "hello," isn't it?

1617
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,799
Hello, Ray. What are you doing here?

1618
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,359
What am I doing here? I live here.

1619
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,159
Every scout in the
country lives here.

1620
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,999
Don't you know anything
about baseball?

1621
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,647
Apparently I don't.

1622
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,479
You know, you should have listened
to House when I told you to.

1623
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,079
Now everybody's
looking like a moron.

1624
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,199
All right, I'm sorry.
I messed up, Ray.

1625
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,639
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

1626
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,839
What are you doing?

1627
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,239
- Start the car.
- Why? Where are we going?

1628
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,161
Start the car! Head east.

1629
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,159
This is the best
Chinese chicken salad

1630
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:51,039
in the continental United States.

1631
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,210
And the chef isn't even Chinese.

1632
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,279
Here. Taste a little bit of that.

1633
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,879
- I don't want any.
- Well, you gotta try it.

1634
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,599
Ray, come on, I don't want any.

1635
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,319
- Just have a taste.
- I don't wanna taste it.

1636
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:04,119
Look how he blends the lime juice

1637
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,199
with the toasted sesame oil

1638
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,199
and the crunchiness of the chicken.
It's really spectacular.

1639
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,439
Ray, look. I'm running
out of time here.

1640
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:13,239
- What are we doing?
- Take it easy for a minute.

1641
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:14,999
- Walter!
- Hey!

1642
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,039
- How you doing?
- I'm good, Ray. How are you?

1643
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,279
- Don't you eat anywhere else?
- Never. Absolutely not.

1644
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,879
- Say hello to Mr. Bernstein.
- Hi.

1645
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,879
- How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
- Nice to meet you.

1646
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:23,919
So how was Puerto Rico?

1647
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,239
I was there for three weeks.

1648
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,399
I'll tell you about it later.

1649
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,479
Yeah, I'd like to hear about it.
Sit down, sit down for a minute.

1650
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,639
- Join us for a minute.
- Come on, Ray, I should get going.

1651
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:34,219
Just for a minute.
Take it easy. Sit down.

1652
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,525
You don't know this guy?

1653
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,239
No, I don't know this guy.

1654
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,879
- You don't know Walter?
- I don't know Walter.

1655
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,164
You don't know Walter Shapiro?

1656
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,648
The head scout for the Pirates

1657
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:52,685
who was not here
for your exhibition.

1658
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,919
Oh, Walter Shapiro.

1659
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,000
- Yes!
- Oh, hi.

1660
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,045
And now you know him
and he doesn't know you.

1661
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,040
What a stroke of luck.

1662
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,690
Thanks for lunch.

1663
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,006
Thank you, Ray.

1664
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,646
Hello?

1665
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,691
Hey! Hello?

1666
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:28,601
Amit?

1667
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:43,287
What the hell?

1668
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,759
- Welcome to India, JB sir.
- What's this?

1669
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,691
Please have a seat for your date.

1670
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,281
My date?

1671
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,841
Ms. Brenda.

1672
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,041
Wow.

1673
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,519
That is a very, very nice
look on you, Ms. Brenda.

1674
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:45,319
Why, thank you, Mr. JB sir.

1675
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,879
Madam.

1676
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,960
- Please, sir.
- Today we have some delicious

1677
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,079
lamb tikka masala,

1678
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,539
uh, some vegetable curry, here...

1679
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:59,559
rice, and some naan and poppadum.

1680
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,999
Where did all this come from?

1681
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,359
They cooked it.

1682
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,530
Hold on a minute,
you guys know how to cook?

1683
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,039
Yes, JB sir. Little bit.

1684
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,641
But...

1685
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,719
Ms. Brenda did all the cutting.

1686
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,239
- That's true.
- Good.

1687
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:12,499
I made sure of it.

1688
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,119
We are trying to thank
you with this meal.

1689
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:19,639
And we also wanted to say

1690
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,924
that we are very, very sorry, sir,

1691
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,759
because we are letting
you down at the tryouts.

1692
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,359
We can never repay what
you've given us, JB sir.

1693
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:30,079
Repay me? Guys, come on.

1694
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,841
What are you talking about?

1695
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,799
Okay, we all are here together,

1696
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,079
so let's thank God and
let's do a prayer.

1697
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,681
Okay.

1698
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:52,599
- Sorry.
- JB.

1699
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,919
I have to take this. It's Aash.

1700
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,439
- Really? Now?
- I'm sorry.

1701
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,699
- Hey.
- JB sir...

1702
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,886
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm in the middle of a

1703
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,639
prayer right now.

1704
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,719
But, uh, I wanted to let you know

1705
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,641
we got the second tryout from MLB.

1706
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,479
Yeah, it's gonna be
in two weeks at USC.

1707
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:13,845
So get ready. All right,
I'll call you later and fill you in.

1708
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,399
Yeah, bye. Sorry. Where were you?

1709
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,240
We were praying?

1710
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,279
Are you messing with us, dude?

1711
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,519
No, I'm not messing with you.
You got a second tryout.

1712
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,565
All right. So start stretching.

1713
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,279
Whoo! Whoo!

1714
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:29,959
But this time, we're gonna
do it a little different.

1715
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:31,079
Yes. We're gonna pitch good.

1716
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,319
Ideally you will pitch better,

1717
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,048
yes, but this time, guys, I...

1718
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,919
I just want you to have fun.

1719
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,799
- Yes, sir.
- Okay?

1720
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,768
Last time we did this, it was all
business and that was my fault.

1721
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,849
But baseball shouldn't be
just about business, okay?

1722
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,931
You should have fun.

1723
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,361
How are you not writing this down?

1724
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,839
Oh, yes, I need to
write that. Noted, JB sir.

1725
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,159
And listen to me, guys,
no matter what happens,

1726
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:08,321
I want you to know that
you could never, ever

1727
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,879
let me down.

1728
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:12,239
Okay? I have never been more proud

1729
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,524
of anyone in my entire life.

1730
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,531
So I wanna thank you.

1731
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:22,205
I really love you guys.

1732
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:34,327
I'm hungry.

1733
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:39,719
- We should eat.
- We should. Beautiful food.

1734
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,639
Ms. Brenda, would you mind
if they joined us on our date?

1735
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,079
I wouldn't have it any other way.

1736
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,159
- Get some chairs, guys.
- No, no, no...

1737
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:48,879
Amit, Amit, pull up a chair.
Come on, it's fine.

1738
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,039
Sir, Indian food... Indian
food is the best food, sir.

1739
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:55,291
- Wait. Wait. Take your plate.
- I'll try everything.

1740
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,479
Not as many as last time.

1741
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,809
Who cares? There's enough.

1742
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,639
Well, this is a little more like it.

1743
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:00,288
- Hello, Ray, Tom.
- JB.

1744
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,279
Good job getting this together.

1745
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,479
It couldn't have been easy.

1746
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:06,570
It was highly improbable.

1747
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,719
But we managed to do it.

1748
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,279
I should've listened
to you the first time.

1749
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:12,006
Oh, you think?

1750
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,519
- Sorry about that.
- Forget it. Live and learn.

1751
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,199
- You nervous?
- I can barely breathe.

1752
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,799
Well, then it's probably
not the best time

1753
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:22,319
to let you know that Chang is here.

1754
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,888
- What? Really?
- Yeah. Five o'clock.

1755
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,759
I really don't feel good.

1756
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:33,647
Well, you're in luck.
Here comes the doctor.

1757
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,679
- Hey.
- Hey.

1758
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:40,879
Hi. Wow. You made it.

1759
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,039
Of course. I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

1760
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,919
Are you kidding me? But I'm so nervous
right now, it's hard to breathe.

1761
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,259
- Yeah, I know. I have the same...
- Are you feeling that?

1762
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:53,442
I think I really
like you, Ms. Brenda.

1763
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:57,519
I really like you, too, Mr. JB sir.

1764
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:58,839
Look, this is all very touching,

1765
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:01,966
but we have to get
this show on the road.

1766
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,799
JB, you might wanna
talk to your boys.

1767
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,448
They're looking a little shaky.

1768
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,719
No. You know what?
I want Amit to do it.

1769
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:10,839
- Me?
- Yeah.

1770
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:13,886
You wanted to be a coach. Go coach.

1771
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,959
- Okay.
- No, no, no. Give me that. Give me that.

1772
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,561
Give me that.

1773
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,039
Go talk to 'em.

1774
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:23,971
Fire 'em up.

1775
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,845
Go get 'em.

1776
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,686
Ready?

1777
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,681
All my life I wanted to
be a baseball player.

1778
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,770
It's a great sport.

1779
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:22,161
But I never dreamed it was possible.

1780
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:29,208
You, Rinku, you, Dinesh,

1781
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:32,049
you are baseball players now.

1782
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:34,131
Real baseball players.

1783
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,330
Now small boys in India,

1784
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:43,210
they can dream to become like you.

1785
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:49,042
So, let's go.

1786
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,879
Let's go and let's make

1787
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:55,519
JB, Ray, Brenda, Tom,

1788
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,851
our families, proud, huh?

1789
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,206
Are you with me?

1790
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,639
"India" on three.

1791
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,287
One,

1792
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,081
two,

1793
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,439
three.

1794
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:17,121
India!

1795
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,759
Hey, brothers,

1796
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,806
I'm seeing my dream in both of you.

1797
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,199
Your victory, my victory.

1798
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,006
Rock it, brother.

1799
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,006
Who knew?

1800
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,331
What's he doing now?

1801
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:29,926
He's having fun.

1802
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:15,679
- That sounds like...
- Juice!

1803
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,019
Ooh.

1804
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:22,721
Ninety-three.

1805
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,139
Yes! Yes!

1806
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,360
Yes!

1807
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,699
Yes, yes!

1808
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,761
Yes!

1809
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:19,486
What do you know about
Pittsburgh Pirates? Anything?

1810
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,759
Well, they're your new team.

1811
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:24,079
You now have been offered

1812
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,921
a contract with the
Pittsburgh Pirates.
