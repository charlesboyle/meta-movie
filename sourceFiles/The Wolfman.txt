I seem to recall he mentioned
you in one of his letters.

31
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,878

in such a way,

you were in London.

received some word.

Why do you think
he's in trouble?

42
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,043
Because the night he went missing,
two villagers were killed.

I was a moment ago
telling my son

182
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,913
that the telegraph system does reach
us here in Ionely old Blackmoor.

183
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,281
Do you find your home
much changed, Mr. Talbot?

184
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,959
Blackmoor does seem
rather the same as I left it.

185
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,593
How so?

186
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,929

they still have the same wild ideas.

187
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:52,094
Yes, well, they're a provincial lot,
I must say,

188
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,907

worldly man such as yourself.

at the ends of the earth.

190

I didn't intend
to start a squabble.

191
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:08,510

the natural man at your peril.

quite strange, Father.

194

No, you mistake that
for my self-awareness.

I've never understood what it is that you do,

199

other people.

200

But I understand you're highly
celebrated and famous for it.

201

Perhaps one day I'll see for
myself what all the fuss is about.

202

would've liked that.

204

205
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,641

as we all do.

206

Does that answer
your question?

208
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,578
I saw Ben's body today.

209

could have done such a thing?

212
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,454

I've never seen anything like this.

You mean a raving lunatic
at loose on the moor?

216
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:39,906
Yes, it's possible, but I think I would
have run him down with my dogs.

217
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,039
On the other hand,

218
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,413
the wounds are so terrible
that only something human

219
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,419
would seem capable
of such wanton malevolence.

220
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,023
I found a strange medallion
among Ben's belongings.

221
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:58,121
Yes, Saint Columbanus.
He was an Eastern saint.

222
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,260
He was also a gypsy.

223
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,728
So did Ben have dealings
with the gypsies?

224
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,607
Yes, he was our negotiator.

225
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,938
The local gentry
would pay a fee,

226
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:16,741
and the gypsies would keep their
criminal activities to a minimum.

227
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:23,111
And they would move on once they'd
sold the local lads all the wine

No, a great mystery,
it is,

given that there are no natural
predators left in England

such horrific injuries.

suggest the action of an animal.

and they would have both
vanished into the night forever.

the beast in me was not.

had come to tell me

that he was quite resolute in his
