1
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,930
<i>Mayday, mayday.
This is Hesper 2-9-9, heavy in distress.</i>

2
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,420
<i>Dad!</i>

3
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,340
<i>Engines 1 and 2 are offline.
We're losing her.</i>

4
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,320
<i>Go! Go!</i>

5
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,570
<i>I've heard stories of Earth.</i>

6
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,240
<i>A paradise...</i>

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,970
<i>until we destroyed it.</i>

8
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:29,495
<i>The founding of the Uniting Ranger Corps,
One thousand years ago</i>

9
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,320
<i>was a global military effort,
in evacuation of earth.</i>

11
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,720
<i>The rangers would lead the settlement
of mankind in its new home.</i>

12
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,750
<i>Nova Prime.</i>

13
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,810
<i>But we were not alone.</i>

14
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,630
<i>The aliens released the Ursas.</i>

15
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,720
<i>Monsters. Bred to kill humans.</i>

16
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,790
<i>Technically blind.</i>

17
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>The Ursas see humans based
on the pheromones</i>

18
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,720
<i>secrete when frightened</i>

19
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,360
<i>They literally smell our fear.</i>

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,410
<i>Humankind was again
in danger of extinction,</i>

21
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,910
<i>and again turned to the rangers
for the answer.</i>

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,170
<i>And that answer
came in the form</i>

23
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,450
<i>of the prime commander
Cypher Raige.</i>

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,340
<i>The original Ghost.</i>

25
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,079
<i>He's believed to be
soul completely free of fear,</i>

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,560
<i>that to an Ursa...</i>

27
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,040
<i>he's invisible.</i>

28
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,320
<i>This phenomena is known
as "Ghosting".</i>

29
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,250
This isn't a race, cadet.

30
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,320
Raige.

31
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,690
<i>Your test scores
are very impressive.</i>

32
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,420
In the classroom you are
an outstanding ranger,

33
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,240
but in the field you collapse.

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,630
I'm not advancing you.

35
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,770
You may try again next year.

36
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,469
Sir, I am dedicated,
I've studied

37
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,440
and consistently displayed conduct
becoming a ranger, sir.

38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,460
I request that the commander
reconsider his assessment, sir.

39
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,280
Cadet...
- Sir,

40
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,690
my father is returning home tonight.

41
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,200
I haven't seen him in...

42
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,840
It's a very special day
for our family.

43
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,570
and I've gotta be able
to tell him that I'm a ranger, sir.

44
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,730
You tell your father...

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,010
that I said welcome home.

46
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,300
Dismissed.

47
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,810
Faia.

48
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,340
Hi.

49
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:07,914
How were finals?

50
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,790
How were finals?
-I wasn't advanced to ranger.

51
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,860
Where do we look
when we speak?

52
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,230
I was not advanced to ranger.

53
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,510
You were not advanced to ranger...

54
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,060
I was not advanced to ranger, sir.

55
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,559
That's all right, you're young...

56
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,360
I ran the canyons 11 seconds
faster than you did.

57
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,280
You weren't ready.

58
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,460
Velan is a good man,
he knows his stuff.

59
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,360
If you were, he would've promoted you.
You weren't ready.

60
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,830
I'm not hungry.
I'm going to my room.

61
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,159
Are you asking me
or telling me?

62
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,290
May I go to my room, sir?
-Denied! Sit down!

63
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,040
Our last visit to Iphitos...

64
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,170
flying tomorrow.

65
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,060
Supervising training...

66
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,140
and after it's completed,

67
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,210
I'm announcing my retirement.

68
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,990
Retirement?

69
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,450
Maybe I'll work with you...

70
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,460
in Turbine division.

71
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,860
Together.

72
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,980
I want my family back.

73
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,680
I want you back.

74
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,750
That boy in there...

75
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,280
is trying to find you.

76
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,470
He's a feeling boy.

77
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,540
He's an intuitive boy.

78
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,910
He watched you read that book
with Senshi his entire life.

79
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,080
He's reading that book now.

80
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,160
He's reaching for you.

81
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,670
Don't get me wrong,

82
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,400
I respect everything you've done.

83
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,780
But you have a son
in the other room that...

84
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,310
who do not know.

85
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,340
He blames himself
on what happened to Senshi.

86
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,390
He thinks it’s his fault.

87
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,630
He's drowning.

88
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,760
And he does not need
a commanding officer.

89
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,580
He needs a father.

90
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,260
Pack your bags.
You're coming with me to Iphitos.

91
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,990
This was a really good decision.

92
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,980
Now go and make some
good memories together.

93
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,550
You take it easy on your father.
He's a little rusty.

94
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,610
Okay.

95
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,280
General Raige.

96
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,300
I was on the plateau.

97
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,930
You saved me and four others.

98
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,600
I just came from seeing
my baby girl's face for the first time.

99
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Stand me up.
-That won't be necessary, ranger.

100
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,025
Damn it, stand me up!

101
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:08,532
<i>What's that, Serge?</i>

102
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,172
<i>Pull.</i>

103
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:14,522
<i>Looks good.</i>

104
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,940
I'm reading "Moby-Dick".

105
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,420
Your mother told me.

106
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,350
That's great.

107
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,690
<i>Our military transporter will arrive
training base on Iphitos in seven hours.</i>

108
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,140
I'm gonna grab some rack time.
I recommend you do the same.

109
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,180
Hey!
Can you read?

110
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,840
I said, can you read?

111
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,410
Yes, sir.

112
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,130
Well, there's a sign back there:

113
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,930
"Authorized Personnel Only."

114
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,680
Why didn't you read that?

115
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,400
What's in the cage?

116
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,620
Might wanna go easy on him, Serge.

117
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,210
That's the Prime Commander son
right there.

118
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,720
You're Raige's kid?
-What's in there?

119
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,230
You wanna see?

120
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
Kit, we have to go.
Right now.

121
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,540
Is that...
-They surprised us.

122
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,580
Senshi, abstract those things.

123
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,240
An Ursa?
-Taking it to Iphitos.

124
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,880
For ghost training.

125
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,330
You wanna see
if you can ghost?

126
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,960
Ghosting is when you don't have
a trace of fear in you.

127
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,780
Most guys freeze.

128
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,790
That's your cerebral cortex
looking for an answer it doesn't have.

129
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,740
See, even your brain
knows you're screwed.

130
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,890
Your blood is filling
with adrenaline right now...

131
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,900
whether you know it or not.

132
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,260
Your heart's beating fast.

133
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
It's getting a little
harder to breath.

134
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,800
Your neurobiological system
is telling you to run,

135
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,450
but your knees are
too weak to move.

136
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,590
And it's... too late anyway.

137
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,510
The pores in your skin
have already opened up.

138
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,580
It's secrete an imperceptible amount
of pheromones into the air.

139
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,290
And all you can think about
is when it gonna kill you.

140
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,560
Senshi!

141
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,960
She sees you, kid.

142
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,060
Attention on deck!

143
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,630
Kitai, back to your seat now.

144
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,960
Rangers, go red-con one.

145
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,580
Secure all cargo!

146
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,800
Behind your seat there's a life-suit.

147
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,770
Put it on now. Strap in,
full harness. -Yes, sir.

148
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,160
Good evening, General.
-Captain.

149
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,920
What's the last known position
of the closest asteroid storm?

150
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,760
Category-4 asteroid formation.

151
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,890
2,000km to starboard
and plus 4-5 declination.

152
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,490
I detected graviton-vibrations
in the hull.

153
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,210
Which you detected, how?

154
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,640
Graviton build-up could be
a precursor to mass-expansion.

155
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,380
That storm could be
on us in minutes.

156
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,160
But, sir, mass-expansion
is one in a million.

157
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,690
If we try to navigate out...

158
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,920
the pull of our own graviton wake
could set the thing off.

159
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,300
Let's just hold course
and hope I'm wrong.

160
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,430
Just out of interest, sir,

161
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,440
How often are you wrong?

162
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,380
My wife would give a very
interesting answer to that question.

163
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,870
Graviton count's decreasing.

164
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,580
800 parts per million.

165
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,040
650.

166
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,790
Well, sir,

167
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,920
there's a first time
for everything.

168
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,210
Turn into it.
Match bearing.

169
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,010
Dad!

170
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,830
She's a dead stick!

171
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,010
Engines 1 and 2
are offline. we losing her!

172
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,980
Can you travel us out of here?
-Where?!

173
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,250
The anchorage on Lycia.
It's the closest.

174
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,240
Negative, sir. We cannot worm-hole
travel in the middle of this.

175
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,070
Do it.

176
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,580
Coordinates for anchorage
at Lycia locked in.

177
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,000
No confirmation signal, sir.

178
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,300
Travel us now.

179
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,380
Sir, without confirmation...
-That's an order.

180
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,560
Go. Go!

181
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,880
Cabin pressure dropping.

182
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,040
Heavy damage to outer hall.

183
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,080
There's a breach possible
to middle cabin.

184
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,270
Find me something I can
land on. Now!

185
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,710
I got something.

186
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,420
Bearing 340 by 95.

187
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,445
Range, 86,000.

188
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,980
<i>Warning: this planet has been
declared unfit for human habitation.

189
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,840
<i>Placed under class-1 quarantine
by the interplanetary authority.

190
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,470
<i>Under penalty of law,

191
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,260
<i>Do not attempt to land.

192
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,060
<i>Repeat: do not attempt to land.

193
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,260
It's not possible.

194
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,610
The computer might have defaulted
back to a known demarcation point.

195
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,660
No. Not yet.

196
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,740
Travel us again.
-Negative, sir.

197
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,330
This ship is gonna tear apart
at any moment.

198
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,860
Set her down.

199
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,840
<i>Mayday, mayday.
This is Hesper 2-9-9 heavy in distress.</i>

200
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,879
We took heavy damage
from an asteroid storm

201
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,950
and are going down
with bingo power.

202
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,320
You all right?

203
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,740
Evaluate.

204
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,970
Good to go.

205
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,790
You confirm
the Ursa's contained.

206
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,740
The back of the ship is gone.

207
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,720
Rangers, count off.

208
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,320
Rangers, count off.

209
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,230
Damn.

210
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,670
The cockpit is directly above us.

211
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,950
Go.

212
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,710
<i>Left rear.
There's a utility compartment.

213
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,230
<i>Inside,
there's an emergency beacon.

214
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,020
<i>Silver. Like a saucer.
Bring it to me.

215
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,350
Consolidate inventory up.

216
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,740
General Cypher Raige.

217
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,150
Crash landed.

218
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,800
Two confirmed survivors.

219
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,760
Kitai,

220
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,310
the emergency beacon you brought me
will fire a distress signal deep into space.

221
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,230
But it's damaged.

222
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,550
There's another one
in the tail section of our ship.

223
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,160
This is us here.

224
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,620
That, is the tail.

225
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,190
Somewhere in this area.

226
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,520
It's approximately 100km
from here.

227
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,710
We need that beacon.

228
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,280
You understand?
-Yeah.

229
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,630
Both my legs are broken.
One very badly.

230
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,920
You are going to retrieve
that beacon,

231
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,880
or we are going to die.

232
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,100
Do you understand?
-Yeah.

233
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,640
Repeat what I just said.

234
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,600
I have to go retrieve the beacon,

235
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,460
or we going to die.

236
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,210
You have air-filtration inhalers.

237
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,000
You need to take one now.

238
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,600
The fluid will coat your lungs,
increase your oxygen extraction

239
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,210
allowing you to breath more
comfortably in the environment.

240
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,460
You have six vials.

241
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,430
In your weight,

242
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,670
that should be 20-24 hours
each. That's more than enough.

243
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,480
Your life-suit and backpack

244
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,680
are equipped with
digital and virtual imaging.

245
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,930
So I'll be able to see
everything that you see...

246
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,840
and what you do not see.

247
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,520
I will guide you.

248
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,760
It'll be like
I'm right there with you.

249
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,510
Take my cutlass.

250
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,300
It's the C-40.

251
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,300
Full, 22 configurations.

252
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,010
Kitai,

253
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,760
every single decision you make
will be life or death.

254
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,199
This is a class-1
quarantined planet.

255
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,430
Everything in this planet
has evolved to kill humans.

256
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,420
Do you know where we are?

257
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,160
No, sir.

258
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,840
This is Earth.

259
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,540
And... the Ursa?

260
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,760
There are three possibilities.

261
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,670
First and most likeliest,
it died in the crash.

262
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,830
The second and less likely,

263
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,900
is that it is injured very badly
and still contained.

264
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,980
The third and least likely,

265
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,080
is that it is out.

266
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,360
We will proceed, however,
in anticipation of the worst case scenario.

267
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,560
Every movement will be under
protocol "escape and evade".

268
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,080
If he's out there,

269
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,750
I will see him long before
he gets anywhere near you.

270
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,060
Do you understand?

271
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,660
Yes, sir.

272
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,240
Do exactly as I tell you,

273
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,790
and we will survive.

274
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,160
<i>Kitai, calm down.</i>

275
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,780
<i>Take a knee.</i>

276
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,680
<i>Root yourself in this
present moment, now.</i>

277
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,200
<i>Sight, sound.
Smell.</i>

278
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,060
<i>What do you feel?</i>

279
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,150
My body feels heavier.

280
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,490
<i>Very good.</i>

281
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,400
<i>Earth gravitational pull
is different than at home.</i>

282
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,070
<i>Very good.</i>

283
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,220
<i>Now, let’s go.</i>

284
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,190
What happened?

285
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,260
You didn't see that?
<i>-Kitai, what happened?</i>

286
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm fine.

287
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,730
No change, I just slipped.

288
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,160
<i>There's condensation
on the stones.</i>

289
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,780
<i>I'm good to go.</i>

290
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,690
General Cypher Raige.

291
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,110
Initiating remote probe recon.

292
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,710
Primary target:

293
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,690
Ursa.

294
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,709
<i>I want to reiterate that
your navi-band</i>

295
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,560
<i>is our sole means of communication.</i>

296
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,700
Roger.

297
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,610
Temperatures in this planet
fluctuate dangerously, Kitai.

298
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,300
And most of the planet
freezes over completely at night.

299
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,560
But there are hot spots.

300
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,480
Geothermal nodes
between here and the tail

301
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,970
that will keep you warm
during the freeze-over.

302
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,100
You must reach one of these
hot spots

303
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,320
each evening before nightfall.

304
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,300
Is that understood?
<i>-Copy.</i>

305
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,280
Standard operating procedure
till I give you further instructions.

306
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,680
Stand by.

307
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,460
<i>Dad, are you there?</i>

308
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,220
<i>Hey, dad, are you there?</i>

309
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,800
<i>Dad?</i>

310
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,120
<i>Are you there?</i>

311
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,100
<i>Hello?</i>

312
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,290
I'm here.

313
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,990
<i>A boy I know had this.</i>

314
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,650
<i>It's a real book.
For a museum.</i>

315
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,840
It's "Moby-Dick".

316
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,190
He said I can even
hold on to it.

317
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,470
Hold on, to what?

318
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,120
The book, dad.

319
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,680
Do they really
kill these whales?

320
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,520
We, Senshi, for their oils

321
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,430
and they almost disappeared.

322
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,770
Just before the age
of carbon fuels.

323
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,160
<i>Where's your brother?</i>

324
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,000
Kit.

325
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,270
Hi.

326
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,890
<i>Dad, are you there?</i>

327
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,160
I'm here.

328
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,900
Where are you?

329
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,240
My suit turned to black.

330
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,760
I like it, but I think
it's something bad.

331
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,549
Your suit is made of
smart-fabric.

332
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,290
It has motion sensors.

333
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,050
I'm tracking a life-form
moving towards you from the west.

334
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,750
<i>It's closing rapidly.</i>

335
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,580
50m.

336
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,080
40.

337
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,530
<i>30.</i>

338
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,900
<i>20.</i>

339
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,150
10.

340
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,370
It is right there, Kitai.

341
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,460
Do not... move.

342
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,900
Recognize your power.

343
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,480
This will be your creation.

344
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,440
Stand down, cadet.

345
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,030
Kitai!
<i>-Go away!</i>

346
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,810
Control yourself, cadet.

347
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,790
<i>Kitai!</i>
Stand down!

348
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,510
Get away!

349
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,770
Get the hell away!
<i>-Kitai!</i>

350
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,470
<i>To your rear.</i>
Out to your rear.

351
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,550
Okay, I'm going.

352
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,120
There's a river,
250m straight ahead, go.

353
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,800
<i>They are no longer in pursuit.</i>

354
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,580
<i>Cadet, you are not
being followed.</i>

355
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,510
<i>I repeat, you are not
being followed.</i>

356
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,000
<i>Kitai, you are running
from nothing!</i>

357
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,990
<i>Kitai!</i>

358
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,670
<i>Kitai, put my damn
cutlass away.</i>

359
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,310
<i>You are not being followed.
Take a knee.</i>

360
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,220
<i>Take a knee, cadet.</i>

361
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,659
<i>You want to die today,
that's fine,</i>

362
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,700
but you are not going
to kill me.

363
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,619
Kitai, I need you to do
a physical assessment.

364
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,890
You are showing rapid blood
contamination. Are you cut?

365
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,030
I'm dizzy.

366
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,510
<i>Kitai, self-eval.</i>

367
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,250
<i>Good, god!</i>

368
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,490
Dad, I can't stand.

369
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,720
<i>Open your med-kit.</i>

370
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:59,750
You are going to have
to administer the antitoxin in sequence.

371
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,120
Inject yourself the clear liquid first.

372
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,380
<i>Do it now.</i>

373
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,880
I can't see.

374
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,390
<i>The poison is affecting
your nervous system. Stay even.</i>

375
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,680
Dad, please come help me.
I can't see.

376
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,390
I can't do this without my sight, dad.
Please, come and get me.

377
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,619
Kitai, inject yourself directly
into your heart

378
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,080
with the first stage.
<i>Do it now.</i>

379
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,210
Now the second. ASAP.

380
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,380
To your left, Kitai.

381
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,600
<i>Left!</i>

382
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,990
I can't feel my hand.

383
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,980
<i>Dad, I can't feel my hands.</i>

384
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,920
Press it into the ground.

385
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,710
<i>Roll over on it
and press it into the ground, Kitai.</i>

386
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,520
Great work, cadet.

387
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,300
But you are going
to lie there for a moment.

388
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,910
The parasite that stung you...

389
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,160
has a paralyzing agent
in its venom.

390
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,790
<i>So you are going to have to
lie there for a little bit.</i>

391
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,380
<i>While the antitoxin
does its job.</i>

392
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,800
<i>It's time to wake up.</i>

393
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,120
<i>Son,</i>

394
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,510
<i>the temperature is dropping
five degrees every ten minutes.</i>

395
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,860
<i>You have got to wake up.</i>

396
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,240
<i>Can you blink your eyes?</i>

397
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,490
Son,

398
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,120
I need you to, please,
blink your eyes.

399
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,320
Blink your eyes.

400
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,280
Hey, dad.

401
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,250
<i>Hey.</i>

402
00:45:06,275 --> 00:45:08,875
<i>-That sucked.</i>
-That is correct.

403
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,860
You got 9.7km to the hot spot.

404
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,440
How about you show me that
10k in 50 minutes, cadet?

405
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,790
<i>Sir, yes, sir.</i>

406
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,740
Two mikes out. All good.

407
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,950
<i>Who wants to be a ranger?
Who wants it?</i>

408
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,380
<i>Watch him go.
Watch him go.</i>

409
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,140
<i>Five miles out.</i>

410
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,480
<i>Come on. Lights out.</i>

411
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,090
Happy 19th birthday, Senshi.

412
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,360
<i>Dad, you help me.</i>

413
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,270
No, Senshi. You go ahead.
You blow.

414
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,380
<i>Come on, dad. Blow.</i>

415
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,000
Nah. You know there's no way
I can actually do that from here.

416
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,020
<i>No. I think you can.</i>

417
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,200
Faia, you're right there.
Help the girl.

418
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,120
<i>You can do it.</i>

419
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,140
<i>I love you, dad.</i>

420
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,030
Hot spot one arrival:

421
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,210
H. plus 54 minutes.

422
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,900
Equipment check
and consolidate.

423
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,890
Take your next inhaler.

424
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,040
Your... oxygen extraction
is bottoming.

425
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,760
Take your next
<i>breathing fluid.</i>

426
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,830
<i>Second dose of
breathing fluid complete.</i>

427
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,200
Count off remaining.

428
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,380
<i>Four vials remain, sir.</i>

429
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,800
Repeat.

430
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,300
Four vials remain, sir.

431
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,350
Dad.

432
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,310
Dad.

433
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,450
I'm here.

434
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,330
How'd you do it?

435
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,040
How'd you first ghost?

436
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,830
Out for a run.

437
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:12,860
Alone.

438
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,280
Something that I
wasn't supposed to do.

439
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,350
Ursa de-camos,

440
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,350
Right in front of me.

441
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,830
I go for my cutlass...

442
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,230
It Shoots its pincer.

443
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,770
Right to my shoulder.

444
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,070
Next thing I know,
we're over the cliff.

445
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,740
Falling.

446
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,190
30m. Straight down.

447
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,140
Into the river.

448
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,540
We settle onto the bottom.

449
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,100
It's on top of me.

450
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,420
But it's stopped moving.

451
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:03,750
And I realize...

452
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,230
He's trying to drown me.

453
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,880
<i>I'm thinking,
"I'm gonna die.</i>

454
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:17,230
<i>"I'm gonna die."</i>

455
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,160
<i>You cannot believe
this is how you gonna die.</i>

456
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,690
I could see my blood
bubbling up,

457
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,860
Mixing with the sunlight,

458
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,510
Shining through the water.

459
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,950
And I'm thinking, "wow...

460
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,900
"That's really pretty."

461
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,040
<i>Everything slows down.</i>

462
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,610
I see his pincer through my shoulder.

463
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,840
And I decide:

464
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,320
I don't want that
in there anymore.

465
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,640
So I pull it out.

466
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,780
And it lets me go.

467
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,790
And more than that
I can tell...

468
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,270
It can't find me.

469
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,230
<i>It doesn't even know
where to look.</i>

470
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,610
<i>And it dawned on me...</i>

471
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,850
Fear is not real.

472
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,900
The only place that fear
can exist

473
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,980
is in our thoughts
of a future.

474
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,430
It is a product
of our imagination.

475
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,150
Causing us to fear things
that do not at present

476
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,420
and may not ever exist.

477
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,070
<i>That is near insanity, Kitai.</i>

478
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,330
<i>Now, do not misunderstand me:</i>

479
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,110
<i>Danger, is very real.</i>

480
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,040
But fear is a choice.

481
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,490
We are all telling ourselves a story.

482
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,290
And that day, mine changed.

483
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,650
<i>14km to the falls.</i>

484
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,190
<i>That's our midway checkpoint.</i>

485
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:43,750
I'm reading you.

486
00:52:45,611 --> 00:52:47,360
<i>Kitai, get to the falls. ASAP.</i>

487
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,580
I hear something.
I think it's water.

488
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,710
A lot of it.

489
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,120
<i>Inventory up.</i>

490
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,790
Roger.

491
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,720
Food rations, half available.

492
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,870
Flares, full.

493
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,910
Med-kit, half-available.

494
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,340
Breathing fluid...

495
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,370
Breathing fluid,
four vials available.

496
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,930
Why you're not showing me
the case?

497
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,390
What?

498
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,920
<i>Show it to me now.</i>

499
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,600
I thought that I could make it, sir.

500
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,860
Abort mission.

501
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,570
Return to the ship.

502
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,810
<i>That is an order.</i>

503
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,430
Don't come out.

504
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,380
No matter what.

505
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,060
<i>That's an order.</i>

506
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:20,520
Help!

507
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,090
Help!

508
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,290
No, dad.

509
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,790
We... I can do it. I can...

510
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,100
I don't need many. I can
get across with just two.

511
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:38,360
You need a minimum
of three inhalers to make it to the tail.

512
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,030
You have exhausted your resources.

513
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,110
I can get across. I can...
I can do it with just two, dad.

514
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:47,160
This mission has reached
abort criteria.

515
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,400
<i>I'll take full responsibility.</i>

516
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,620
<i>You did your best.</i>

517
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,320
You have nothing more to prove.

518
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,080
Now, return to the ship.

519
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,350
<i>What was your mistake?</i>

520
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,530
Trusting me?!

521
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,780
Depending on me?
Thinking that I can do this?

522
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,250
Now I'm giving you an order...

523
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,690
to turn around

524
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,200
and return to this ship.

525
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,890
You wouldn't give
any other ranger that order.

526
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,450
You are not a ranger,

527
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:25,080
and I'm giving you
that order.

528
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,490
What was I supposed to do?

529
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,420
What did you want me to do?

530
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,130
She gave me an order.

531
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:48,000
She said, "no matter what,
don't come out of that box."

532
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:52,700
Was I supposed to just
come out and die?

533
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,560
What do you think, cadet?

534
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,410
What do you think you
should have done?

535
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,450
Because, really, that is
all that matters.

536
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,730
What do you think you
should have done?

537
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,800
And where were you?!

538
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,500
She called out for you.
She called your name.

539
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,620
And you weren't there,
cause you never there.

540
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,450
And you think I'm a coward?!

541
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:24,510
You're wrong!
I'm not a coward!

542
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,100
You're the coward!

543
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,410
I'm not a coward!

544
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,450
Kitai!

545
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,130
Kitai, you've got incoming.

546
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,140
Do you copy?
You've got incoming.

547
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,400
Don't...

548
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,280
Kitai, dive!

549
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,530
Dive!

550
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,710
<i>Kitai!</i>

551
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,200
No!

552
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,370
Leave them alone!

553
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,300
Get away!

554
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,390
Dad, I'm sorry, it's just...

555
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,530
Where is my son?

556
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,250
General Cypher Raige.

557
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,660
This is a message for my wife.

558
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,490
Faia,

559
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,830
I have lost contact
with our son.

560
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:36,210
End message.

561
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:40,820
<i>You have six vials.
In your weight,</i>

562
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:43,780
<i>that should be 20-24 hours
each. That's more than enough.</i>

563
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,270
<i>I estimate four days
to reach the tail.</i>

564
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,880
<i>We'll break it to sections.</i>

565
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,580
<i>You have six hours to reach
the first geothermal site.</i>

566
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,690
<i>First leg is 20 km. to the
mouth of the north forest.</i>

567
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,200
<i>I'm right here.</i>
-Five mikes out.

568
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,970
<i>Keep moving.</i>
-That's about one hour.

569
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,040
<i>Take your next inhaler.</i>

570
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,440
<i>H. plus 54 minutes.</i>

571
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:04,940
<i>There's an escarpment.</i>

572
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:06,779
<i>Looks like it could be
a waterfall</i>

573
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,030
<i>We will call that
our midway point.</i>

574
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,909
<i>I can get across.
I can do it with just two, dad.</i>

575
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,630
<i>14km to the forest.
This is us here.</i>

576
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,170
<i>That, is the tail.</i>

577
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,960
<i>You are going to retrieve
that beacon...</i>

578
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,720
<i>or we are going to die.</i>

579
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,120
Leave me alone!

580
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,120
Wake up.

581
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,440
It's time for you
to wake up.

582
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,020
Hey.

583
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,110
Hey.

584
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,700
I was just about
to come out that day.

585
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,000
No, you weren't.

586
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:28,300
But you did the right thing.

587
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,010
Dad says I should have tried.

588
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,770
He's just mad at himself,
that's all.

589
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,560
Why couldn't you ghost?

590
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,810
You're close right now.

591
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,660
I am?

592
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,400
Are you scared?

593
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,290
No. I'm tired.

594
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,980
That's good.

595
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,920
You filled your heart
with something else.

596
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:12,220
Now you gotta get up.

597
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:14,300
I memorized some "Moby-Dick".

598
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,339
Kitai, get up.

599
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,749
"All that most maddens and
torments..." -Kitai, wake up!

600
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,399
"All that stirs up the lees of things."
-Wake up!

601
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,170
It's time to wake up.
-"All truth with malice in it."

602
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,350
Kitai! -"All that cracks
the sinews and cakes the brain."

603
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,710
<i>Wake up!</i>

604
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,810
Hey... thanks.

605
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,480
No.

606
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:12,590
<i>Dad.</i>

607
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:19,110
<i>Dad, it's Kitai.</i>

608
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,540
<i>I made it to...</i>

609
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,630
Kitai? <i>-Dad, I made it
to the tail, do you copy?</i>

610
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,900
Kitai, I'm here.

611
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:36,800
Are you okay?
<i>-Dad, do you read me?</i>

612
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,790
I copy.

613
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:44,600
<i>Dad, I made it to the tail,
do you copy?</i>

614
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:47,670
Kitai, we have electrical
interference.

615
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,360
You're in a black zone.

616
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,540
I repeat, you are
in a black...

617
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:57,430
Dad, the Ursa is not contained.
Please, copy.

618
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:13,430
Dad?
-I'm here.

619
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:17,020
I swear to you, I'm here.

620
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:03,130
Take a knee.

621
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,560
It is the ionic layer.

622
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:22,710
And the atmosphere
above your current position,

623
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:24,770
it is causing electrical interference.

624
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:27,910
That is why the beacon
is not firing.

625
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,700
To your north.

626
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,990
The peak.

627
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:44,200
You must find the beacon

628
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:46,680
from the peak of that mountain.

629
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:57,300
See it, Kitai.

630
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,020
Please.

631
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,860
See it.

632
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,940
Good boy.

633
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,000
Good boy.

634
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,010
Good boy.

635
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:46,280
It is a pheromone trigger.

636
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:49,140
He set it to scare you...

637
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,580
so he can track you.
Keep moving.

638
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:17,470
It has found you.

639
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,470
Run.

640
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,400
Just run, Kitai.

641
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,830
Just run.

642
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,670
<i>Climb in there, okay?
It won't be able to smell you.</i>

643
01:25:57,930 --> 01:25:59,000
<i>Dad!</i>

644
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:22,420
<i>Root yourself in this
present moment, now.</i>

645
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,050
<i>Sight, sound.
Smell.</i>

646
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,340
What do you feel?

647
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,170
You're still in that box.

648
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:46,140
It's time to come out.

649
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,380
Stand me up.

650
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,620
<i>General.</i>

651
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:42,410
I said... Stand me up.

652
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,770
<i>Watch his back.</i>

653
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,010
Dad?

654
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,210
Yeah.

655
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,560
I wanna work with mom.

656
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,580
Yep.

657
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,290
Me too.
