1
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,590
Come, spirit.

2
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:54,355
Help us sing the story of our land.

3
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:00,720
You are our mother.

4
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,983
We, your field of corn.

5
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,865
We rise...

6
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:16,160
...from out of the soul of you.

7
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:05,499
Dear Mother:

8
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:12,589
You fill the land with your beauty.

9
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:23,225
You reach to the end of the world.

10
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,815
How shall I seek you?

11
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,863
Show me your face.

12
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:43,788
You, the great river...

13
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:46,916
...that never runs dry.

14
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,733
Let him go.

15
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:39,277
You said to hang him, sir.

16
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,489
Now remember, Smith.

17
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:45,283
You've come to these shores in chains.

18
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:47,410
You're under a cloud...

19
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:52,332
...which will darken considerably if I hear
any more of your mutinous remarks.

20
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,585
Is that understood?

21
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,477
Captain Newport, sir. I found oysters.

22
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:55,606
They're as thick as my hands.
They're the size of stones, sir.

23
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,442
And there's fish everywhere,
flapping against your legs.

24
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,987
- We're gonna live like kings.
All these months at sea.

25
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:04,698
I'm weary of looking further.

26
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,825
This place will serve.

27
00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:11,038
We have deep water to the shore,
we can see up and down the river.

28
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:14,124
Our enemies will have
no advantage of surprise.

29
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:17,461
Uh, bring the anchors
and, uh, midsails to shore...

30
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,548
...in case some homesick persons
decide to slip away with them.

31
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:26,386
We must be careful
not to offend the naturals.

32
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:29,514
If our crops fail, we shall be obliged
to trade with them.

33
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:34,353
Once we're established here,
we may go up the river...

34
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:38,733
...and seek a route to the other sea.

35
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:48,117
{AXES CHOPPING IN DISTANCE]

36
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,662
The savages often visit us kindly.

37
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:19,335
Timid, like a herd of curious deer.

38
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:24,674
Tonight we shall sleep
aboard our ships. Everyone in full armor.

39
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,677
In the morning,
we will chop down every tree...

40
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:31,347
...within half a mile of the moorage,
and use the straightest limbs...

41
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:34,476
...to erect a line of watchtowers
and to build our fort.

42
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:36,311
When we have done that...

43
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,024
...we set our wheat and barley,
put up houses and lay in firewood.

44
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:44,527
Slackers will be whipped
at the sight of their transgression.

45
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:45,904
Sir.
Yes, Emery.

46
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:48,531
When might we, uh, be going out to...

47
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,534
...poke about, sir?

48
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:54,871
We are not here to pillage and raid.

49
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,375
We are here to establish a colony.

50
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:01,795
How many lands behind me?

51
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,880
Gold will do you no good.

52
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:06,716
Not six months from now,
when the snow has begun to fly.

53
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,802
How many seas?

54
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,519
What blows and dangers?

55
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,778
Fortune never my friend.

56
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:47,547
Five kegs is gone since we landed.
Somebody stole them.

57
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:50,717
Rairs gotten to this, and worms here.

58
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:51,885
Brand him.

59
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:53,220
And here.

60
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,931
Cut off his ears.

61
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:02,062
Captured these two, sir,
talking to the men.

62
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,730
Spying.

63
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:11,989
Hey, you!

64
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:19,413
He stole me hatchet!

65
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:30,007
We've lost the favor of the naturals.

66
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,844
Had we not sighted land
the day we did...

67
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:36,139
...I would have turned back.

68
00:16:36,682 --> 00:16:39,392
We have eaten
the majority of our stores.

69
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,728
Our best men are sick with fever.

70
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:43,813
The rest will soon breed mutiny.

71
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:46,441
We might as well be shipwrecked.

72
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:48,943
Now...

73
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:54,282
...the naturals tell me
of a city up the river...

74
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,202
...and of a mighty king who lives there.

75
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,997
I propose we send
an envoy to this king...

76
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:04,834
...to see whether he can be persuaded
to trade with us.

77
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:09,964
Meanwhile, I shall, uh, return to England
for fresh supplies.

78
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:11,924
I'll not be back until spring.

79
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:15,470
Radcliffe here will be in command.

80
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:20,266
As to who will approach
the savage king...

81
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:23,853
...I needrt tell you
it will be a hazardous mission.

82
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,689
Captain Smith
is the only professional soldier among us.

83
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:30,986
Smith, sir? What are...?
What are his qualifications?

84
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,237
Those you lack.

85
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,824
I should very dearly
like to know one thing.

86
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:39,161
What is to prevent this friend
of the hangman...

87
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,998
...from making league with the naturals
and turning upon us?

88
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,418
Only under the extremity of torture,
I should like to assume.

89
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:50,255
Or indeed instructing them in
the conduct of war and English strategies...

90
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:52,966
...if I may make so bold.

91
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:57,346
His right to the title of captaincy
is dubious at best.

92
00:17:57,514 --> 00:17:59,431
The lowborn son of a farmer...

93
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,310
...cannot be expected to behave
with a gentlemars sense of propriety.

94
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:05,312
Perhaps you'd like to go, Wingfield.

95
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:10,692
Smith, you have an opportunity
to repair your reputation.

96
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:13,654
I expect you to welcome it.

97
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:46,938
Who are you, whom I so faintly hear?

98
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:52,360
Who urge me ever on?

99
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,738
You have the makings of a leader, Smith.

100
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:58,575
Can one rely on you?

101
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:18,470
What voice is this that speaks within me?

102
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,518
Guides me towards the best?

103
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:42,953
Where?

104
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:08,688
Always the star was guiding me.

105
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:12,275
Leading.

106
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:16,571
Drawing me on.

107
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:22,827
To the fabled land.

108
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:32,879
There life shall begin.

109
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,694
A world equal to our hopes.

110
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:44,536
A land where one might wash
one's soul pure.

111
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:50,625
Rise to one's true stature.

112
00:22:00,094 --> 00:22:02,637
We shall make a new start.

113
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,850
A fresh beginning.

114
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:16,109
Here the blessings of the earth
are bestowed upon all.

115
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,239
None need grow poor.

116
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,747
Here there is good ground for all...

117
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,625
...and no cost but one's labor.

118
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,964
We shall build a true commonwealth.

119
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:40,426
Hard work and self-reliance our virtues.

120
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:47,934
We shall have no landlords
to rack us with high rents...

121
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,520
...or extort the fruit of our labor.

122
00:22:56,485 --> 00:23:00,822
No man shall stand above any other.
We'll all live under the same law.

123
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:16,003
Captain, we haven't the draft
to go any further.

124
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,048
Put in.

125
00:23:43,074 --> 00:23:46,076
None shall eat up carelessly
what his friends got won'thily...

126
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:49,455
...or steal away that which virtue
has stored up.

127
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:56,253
Men shall not make each other
their spoil.

128
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:03,010
Let's go back, sir. Gather a larger party.

129
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:07,514
We're lost.

130
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,061
There the naturals go!
- Let him go!

131
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:24,218
Tide's run out, captain.

132
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:27,721
Bottom's dragging on the mud, sir.

133
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:35,271
Keep your matchlock lit.

134
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,898
Fire a shot if you see anything.

135
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:54,955
The sun.

136
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,833
And the moon as well.

137
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:02,212
It shows you how the sun
chases the night...

138
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,630
...continually around the world.

139
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,588
The sky? No.

140
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,717
From England, a land to the east.

141
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,067
Leave?

142
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:29,988
There won't be any leaving
till the spring.

143
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:31,781
The boats won't be back till then.

144
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:38,746
We have...

145
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,916
...articles that might interest you.

146
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:47,130
Gunpowder.

147
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:34,511
At the moment I was to die,
she threw herself upon me.

148
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:58,995
PARAHUNT:

149
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:16,054
POWHATAN:

150
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,389
Sky.
- Sky.

151
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,276
- Sun.
- Sun.

152
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,286
Water.

153
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:14,254
Wind. Wind.

154
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:48,039
Eyes.

155
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:03,721
Lips.

156
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,695
Ear.

157
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:41,802
All the children of the king
were beautiful, but she...

158
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,388
...the youngest, was so exceedingly so...

159
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:47,599
...that the sun himself,
though he saw her often...

160
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:51,520
...was surprised whenever she came out
into his presence.

161
00:37:57,402 --> 00:38:02,032
Her father had a dozen wives,
a hundred children...

162
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,409
...but she was his favorite.

163
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,585
She exceeded the rest
not only in feature and proportion...

164
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:16,296
...but in wit and spirit too.

165
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:24,387
All loved her.

166
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:32,062
Moon.

167
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:21,882
They are gentle, loving, faithful...

168
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:25,093
...lacking in all guile and trickery.

169
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:32,602
The words denoting
lying, deceit, greed...

170
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:35,688
...envy, slander and forgiveness
have never been heard.

171
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:44,405
They have no jealousy,
no sense of possession.

172
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:56,542
Real, what I thought a dream.

173
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,789
POWHATAN

174
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,178
POWHATAN:

175
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,620
I am not guarded.

176
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,394
They trust me as a brother.

177
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,063
Heat.

178
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,231
Heat. Heat.
Heat.

179
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:26,236
I, who was a pirate
who lived to steal what I could.

180
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:31,367
I am a free man now.

181
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:38,332
All that they have is given me.

182
00:43:40,669 --> 00:43:45,839
I don't know.

183
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:34,597
Saved a child from drowning.

184
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:40,061
Never had it struck me
so forcefully before...

185
00:44:40,229 --> 00:44:43,732
...that I have the power to grant
life and health to others.

186
00:46:52,114 --> 00:46:53,865
Lawless.

187
00:47:04,626 --> 00:47:06,794
I was a dead man.

188
00:47:09,464 --> 00:47:11,299
Now I live.

189
00:47:22,312 --> 00:47:24,187
You, my light.

190
00:47:28,026 --> 00:47:29,943
My America.

191
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:39,244
Love.

192
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:46,418
Shall we deny it when it visits us?

193
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:54,384
Shall we not take what we are given?

194
00:48:13,697 --> 00:48:16,324
There is only this.

195
00:48:18,327 --> 00:48:21,120
All else is unreal.

196
00:48:34,385 --> 00:48:36,052
Mother...

197
00:48:38,722 --> 00:48:41,015
...where do you live?

198
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:46,854
In the sky?

199
00:48:48,691 --> 00:48:51,025
The clouds?

200
00:48:52,736 --> 00:48:55,029
The sea?

201
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,878
Give me a sign.

202
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:25,102
We rise.

203
00:49:39,617 --> 00:49:42,578
Afraid of myself.

204
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:50,294
A god, he seems to me.

205
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:05,393
What else is life but being near you?

206
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:12,817
Do they suspect?

207
00:50:17,156 --> 00:50:19,991
Oh, to be given to you...

208
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,496
...you to me.

209
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:34,255
I will be faithful to you.

210
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:38,927
True.

211
00:50:55,612 --> 00:50:58,197
Two no more.

212
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:05,538
One.

213
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:13,879
I am.

214
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:41,825
The king announced that I was free.

215
00:51:41,993 --> 00:51:44,244
He was sending me back.

216
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:47,038
And on the understanding
that when spring came...

217
00:51:47,248 --> 00:51:49,749
...we were to go back
to where we came from.

218
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,505
His chiefs had advised him to kill me.

219
00:51:56,257 --> 00:52:00,552
I had gained a knowledge of their arms,
their strong places.

220
00:52:01,762 --> 00:52:04,764
But his daughter assured him
I was a good man.

221
00:52:20,364 --> 00:52:23,283
I should tell people
that though the naturals lived in peace...

222
00:52:23,451 --> 00:52:27,412
...they yet were strong and would not
suffer their land to be taken away.

223
00:52:28,956 --> 00:52:31,792
There was no sea
beyond the mountains.

224
00:52:32,502 --> 00:52:36,422
Only a land stretching away forever
in great meadows.

225
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:39,133
A land which had no end.

226
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:38,652
Captain Smith.

227
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:42,823
You're back.

228
00:53:45,243 --> 00:53:47,911
The savages will have
to stop here, captain.

229
00:54:24,742 --> 00:54:27,076
- Where have you been?
- It's like seeing a ghost.

230
00:54:27,244 --> 00:54:29,620
You look like you've come back
from the dead.

231
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:31,497
- Where's Captain Radcliffe?
No word.

232
00:54:31,665 --> 00:54:34,584
Shut your mouth!
People say he went over to England.

233
00:54:34,752 --> 00:54:36,419
Did you bring food?
Starving.

234
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:39,339
I brought food.
Someone got killed. Just fell over.

235
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:41,466
Four months of stealing and stealing.

236
00:54:41,633 --> 00:54:43,551
Look at him. Bastard.
Get up.

237
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:48,806
Gambling. They bowl
while the houses fall down.

238
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:51,768
- Look at the church.
Sickness coming in from the marsh.

239
00:54:51,935 --> 00:54:53,728
Who's taking care of you?
No one.

240
00:54:53,896 --> 00:54:56,105
It's all just dying and sickness
and all that.

241
00:54:56,273 --> 00:54:58,191
- I saw a body in the mud.
- You're a liar.

242
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:00,276
- I saw a leg in the bed.
- You are a liar.

243
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:03,529
- Four people died last night.
- Why was the leg in the bed?

244
00:55:03,697 --> 00:55:06,658
Thieves! Jackals! Lash their feet!

245
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:14,124
You're looking rather well, Smith.
Been enjoying yourself, have you?

246
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:18,754
Been enjoying yourself mightily,
I expect.

247
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:21,256
You were sent to relieve our situation...

248
00:55:21,424 --> 00:55:23,967
...not to pleasure yourself.
We here have suffered.

249
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:26,678
I'll ignore the stories
which bring officials disrepute.

250
00:55:26,846 --> 00:55:29,640
No speeches, Smith.
Things are different now.

251
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:33,394
We can't allow cheek.

252
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:36,397
Allow cheek, and we shall have chaos.
I wear the medal now.

253
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:39,483
I am president and you have been
stripped of your captaincy.

254
00:55:39,651 --> 00:55:41,485
Are you qualified to pass judgment on me?

255
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:44,363
That needrt concern us at the moment.

256
00:55:44,656 --> 00:55:47,825
Pity you were not here at the time
of your trial to defend yourself.

257
00:55:47,992 --> 00:55:52,162
I presume you were too afraid,
too guilty to return.

258
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:55,375
My trial?
- Yes.

259
00:55:55,543 --> 00:55:57,919
You were indicted
upon a chapter in Leviticus...

260
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:01,005
...and tried during the period
of your desertion.

261
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:02,799
Our law is speedy here.

262
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:05,343
Been keeping all the good food
for himself, Smith.

263
00:56:05,511 --> 00:56:07,011
Giving us rotten corn.

264
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:09,055
You, sir, have no other eyes and ears...

265
00:56:09,223 --> 00:56:11,391
...than those which grow
on Smith's head here.

266
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,810
He does nothing but tend his own pot.

267
00:56:13,978 --> 00:56:16,896
I have shared all.
I have kept nothing for myself.

268
00:56:17,064 --> 00:56:19,524
- Nothing!
- His name is not even Wingfield.

269
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:22,944
It's Woodson. Woodson is the name.

270
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:25,655
Left England under a cloud of disgrace.

271
00:56:25,823 --> 00:56:28,491
Seize them. Seize them!

272
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:34,873
Any man impeding the punishment of
these rogues will be dealt with harshly.

273
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:39,878
Here.

274
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:45,049
There's no sense in waiting for a trial.
This is mutiny.

275
00:56:45,217 --> 00:56:47,511
I dispatch you herewith
in the name of the king.

276
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:57,605
Dead as an herring. Serves him right.

277
00:56:57,772 --> 00:57:00,149
I can ratify what Mr. Argall said.

278
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:03,652
I should be ashamed to let my servant
keep company with such fellows.

279
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,488
You were a servant.

280
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,990
I ate a single chicken,
and that when I were ill.

281
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,618
Small has eaten six,
which he could not be troubled...

282
00:57:10,785 --> 00:57:12,620
I say it's Captain Smith should lead us.

283
00:57:12,787 --> 00:57:14,830
Aye.

284
00:57:54,163 --> 00:57:56,164
Tell her.

285
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:00,710
Tell her what?

286
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:05,507
I love you.

287
00:58:07,593 --> 00:58:10,011
But I cannot love you.

288
00:58:32,202 --> 00:58:34,078
It was a dream.

289
00:58:36,623 --> 00:58:38,833
Now I am awake.

290
00:58:40,669 --> 00:58:42,628
What do you want with him?

291
00:58:45,632 --> 00:58:48,718
- What should we do with him?
Nothing.

292
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:51,887
He's mad.

293
00:58:53,015 --> 00:58:54,599
Harmless.

294
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:23,378
It's yours.

295
00:59:23,921 --> 00:59:25,547
You know...

296
01:00:37,413 --> 01:00:40,373
Withdraw! March!

297
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:42,375
- March!
St. George! St. George!

298
01:00:42,543 --> 01:00:44,669
March!
St. George! St. George!

299
01:00:57,641 --> 01:01:00,101
I let her love me.

300
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:09,695
I made her love me.

301
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:13,615
And what was your disagreement about?

302
01:01:13,783 --> 01:01:17,494
He said today is the 15th of October.
I said the 17th.

303
01:01:17,662 --> 01:01:19,413
I must.

304
01:01:20,165 --> 01:01:24,209
You were fighting
about the day of the year?

305
01:01:24,377 --> 01:01:25,753
Damnation is like this.

306
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,173
Didrt I tell you to dig a new well
farther from the shore?

307
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:31,759
Why hasn't this been done?

308
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:36,847
Every man must stop what he's doing
right now and start digging the well!

309
01:01:37,015 --> 01:01:39,475
Those of you that can't carry
the dirt in buckets...

310
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:41,477
...shall carry it with your own hands.

311
01:01:41,644 --> 01:01:44,730
He that will not work shall not eat.

312
01:01:44,898 --> 01:01:47,649
The labors of honest
and industrious men...

313
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:51,278
...shall not be consumed
to maintain the idleness of a few.

314
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:55,116
The country is to them a misery,
a death...

315
01:01:55,284 --> 01:01:57,202
...a hell.

316
01:01:58,412 --> 01:02:00,371
Mind yourself, mate.

317
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:15,720
While they starve, they dig for gold.

318
01:02:19,266 --> 01:02:24,354
There is no talk, no hope,
no work but this.

319
01:02:30,402 --> 01:02:33,738
If there's so much gold,
why don't the naturals have any?

320
01:02:33,906 --> 01:02:36,407
You're chasing a dream.

321
01:02:36,575 --> 01:02:40,787
You see what men they've sent us.
A headless multitude.

322
01:02:41,038 --> 01:02:42,831
They will not sow corn
for their own bellies.

323
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:47,336
They will rather eat their fish raw
than fetch some wood to dress it.

324
01:02:49,256 --> 01:02:50,756
Bad water.

325
01:02:51,758 --> 01:02:53,717
Sturgeon gone.

326
01:02:55,345 --> 01:02:56,720
Mutterings.

327
01:02:56,888 --> 01:02:59,223
They shall plant vineyards
and drink the wine.

328
01:02:59,391 --> 01:03:04,228
I will raise up the tent of David...
Love good and hate evil.

329
01:03:04,396 --> 01:03:07,189
...and close up the breaches of his tent.

330
01:03:07,357 --> 01:03:11,569
Take away from me the noise
of your music and your songs...

331
01:03:11,778 --> 01:03:15,155
...so I will not hear the melody.
The Lord has given the command...

332
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:18,325
...and he will smash
the large house into pieces...

333
01:03:18,493 --> 01:03:20,452
...and the small house into bits!

334
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,454
Somebody should shoot Small there.

335
01:03:22,622 --> 01:03:26,166
He hasn't got a ghost of a chance,
and he'll contaminate us all.

336
01:03:26,334 --> 01:03:31,171
He used Wortham's spoon,
now Wortham's gone, my friend.

337
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:33,132
Have we gotta wait until all is dead?

338
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:56,990
Sir, Ackley's dead.

339
01:03:57,158 --> 01:03:59,659
Somebody ate his hands.

340
01:04:01,454 --> 01:04:04,623
Went out in the height of style, anyhow.

341
01:04:04,832 --> 01:04:10,003
Such tranquility,
you'd think he could speak.

342
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:14,132
I shall miss him. I think we all shall.

343
01:04:18,095 --> 01:04:19,930
We're 38 now.

344
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:41,077
To go back up that river.

345
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,707
To love her in the wild.

346
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:57,760
What holds you here?

347
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:06,602
What are your intentions towards her?

348
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,984
Towards them?

349
01:05:19,742 --> 01:05:22,577
There's nothing in the river.
The river's empty.

350
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:28,250
We wanna go back to England.
Please, can we?

351
01:05:29,585 --> 01:05:32,254
- Where's Captain Newport?
- There's nothing to eat.

352
01:05:32,422 --> 01:05:34,131
Captain Newport will be back shortly.

353
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:35,340
Will he have food?

354
01:05:35,508 --> 01:05:38,510
He'd better.
- When will we go back to England?

355
01:05:38,678 --> 01:05:40,387
They're eating all the dead.

356
01:05:40,555 --> 01:05:42,389
Do you believe in ghosts, captain?

357
01:05:42,557 --> 01:05:45,726
People don't care
about the Indians no more.

358
01:07:14,692 --> 01:07:17,194
Don't put yourself in danger.

359
01:07:18,154 --> 01:07:20,656
You don't have to do anything else...

360
01:07:20,824 --> 01:07:22,699
...for us.

361
01:07:23,618 --> 01:07:26,036
Why have you not come to me?

362
01:07:39,843 --> 01:07:41,468
I know, my love.

363
01:07:46,641 --> 01:07:48,142
Don't trust me.

364
01:07:54,024 --> 01:07:56,651
You don't know who I am.

365
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:23,845
Remember.

366
01:08:58,465 --> 01:09:01,133
Thank you.
God be with you.

367
01:09:01,301 --> 01:09:04,720
God bless.
May almighty God bless you.

368
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:07,348
May God be with you.

369
01:09:07,515 --> 01:09:09,475
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

370
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:11,810
Thank you, kindly.

371
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:28,494
Who are you, whom I love?

372
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:41,925
She.

373
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:46,805
Brass twitched her hand.

374
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:52,978
- Where are you going?
Crabs in a bucket.

375
01:09:53,145 --> 01:09:54,771
Where you would not dare to follow.

376
01:09:54,939 --> 01:09:57,357
Scuttling over each other.

377
01:09:57,733 --> 01:10:01,695
- Don't you think you should take more men?
- They can come if they choose.

378
01:10:01,862 --> 01:10:04,739
I will see if we can trade
with another tribe.

379
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,034
Sail. Sail on.

380
01:10:08,202 --> 01:10:10,370
Be careful, sir.

381
01:10:16,419 --> 01:10:19,087
What else is life but living there?

382
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,884
Steal her love.

383
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,312
She lay in peace...

384
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:36,731
...gazed at the sky.

385
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,736
Motionless.

386
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,866
Afraid of what I most desire.

387
01:10:47,617 --> 01:10:49,702
Fool I was.

388
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,959
Cannot walk two paths at once.
Leave her free.

389
01:10:57,127 --> 01:11:00,963
Ride two horses. Can't deceive the good.

390
01:11:09,222 --> 01:11:11,265
Cling to the good.

391
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:14,602
As long as you do,
you have a claim in life.

392
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,821
She, unbound.

393
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:49,262
The source of all evil.

394
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,351
It excuses vulgarity.

395
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:57,562
Makes wrong right, base noble.

396
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:04,756
There's something I know
when I'm with you...

397
01:13:04,924 --> 01:13:07,176
...that I forget when I'm away.

398
01:13:09,012 --> 01:13:11,096
Tell me, my love...

399
01:13:12,015 --> 01:13:15,058
...did you wish for me
to come back and live with you again?

400
01:13:44,714 --> 01:13:46,548
True.

401
01:13:47,008 --> 01:13:49,134
Shut your eyes.

402
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:57,936
Is this the man I loved?

403
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:00,563
So long.

404
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:04,901
A ghost.

405
01:14:09,865 --> 01:14:11,324
Come.

406
01:14:17,498 --> 01:14:19,749
Where are you, my love?

407
01:14:30,803 --> 01:14:33,263
Free.

408
01:14:43,357 --> 01:14:45,651
What do I fear?

409
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:57,580
Can love lie?

410
01:15:05,046 --> 01:15:06,630
You.

411
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:18,642
We can't go into the forest.

412
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:23,564
Could I show you England?

413
01:15:27,193 --> 01:15:29,528
Oh, it's too far.

414
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,535
If I can be with you...

415
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:41,666
...that is all.

416
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:33,594
That fort is not the world.

417
01:16:39,685 --> 01:16:42,436
The river leads back there.

418
01:16:44,147 --> 01:16:46,482
It leads onward too.

419
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:49,068
Deeper.

420
01:16:51,029 --> 01:16:53,364
Into the wild.

421
01:16:56,493 --> 01:16:58,786
Start over.

422
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:06,585
Exchange this false life for a true one.

423
01:17:09,214 --> 01:17:11,799
Give up the name of Smith.

424
01:17:40,747 --> 01:17:41,913
What are you doing here?

425
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:46,835
Beg your pardon, sir.
You were gone longer than we expected.

426
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,755
Appears I've wandered off myself a bit.

427
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:52,674
Things go badly?

428
01:17:58,514 --> 01:18:00,348
No ties.

429
01:18:04,103 --> 01:18:06,396
Space enough at last.

430
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:08,482
Break free.

431
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:12,320
Can I lead them off some other way?

432
01:18:22,706 --> 01:18:25,541
What about the soil, captain?
Is it as good as we thought?

433
01:18:27,044 --> 01:18:28,711
- Not really.
- Always alone.

434
01:18:28,879 --> 01:18:31,964
In fact, I've rarely seen such a pest hole.

435
01:18:32,132 --> 01:18:34,175
Look about you, everything's swamp.

436
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:37,011
Water standing in lakes and pools
so the ground gives way.

437
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,471
Let the dead bury the dead.

438
01:18:38,639 --> 01:18:41,224
I suspect there's more puddles
than dry land.

439
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:44,143
Each producing more mosquitoes
in their slime...

440
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:47,021
...and each mosquito
is hungry as a priest.

441
01:18:47,564 --> 01:18:49,899
None but a savage
could inabit the place.

442
01:18:51,318 --> 01:18:52,985
But west of here...

443
01:18:53,153 --> 01:18:56,197
...towards the mountains, or south,
that is something else.

444
01:18:56,824 --> 01:18:58,282
- We could sail on.
Come...

445
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:00,911
Seek a passage to the east.
My love.

446
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:04,540
It flows.

447
01:19:07,252 --> 01:19:09,878
Where? Life.

448
01:19:13,299 --> 01:19:14,341
Are you true?

449
01:19:14,509 --> 01:19:19,555
We, in your soul. Life.

450
01:19:22,183 --> 01:19:24,393
Am I to see them?

451
01:19:25,103 --> 01:19:27,020
My mouth is dry.

452
01:19:30,483 --> 01:19:32,943
My body trembles.

453
01:19:36,781 --> 01:19:39,283
My skin burns.

454
01:19:41,786 --> 01:19:43,620
I have two minds.

455
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:49,126
Should I tell Father?

456
01:19:50,587 --> 01:19:53,131
There is nothing but this.

457
01:19:56,635 --> 01:19:58,595
What was I?

458
01:20:03,809 --> 01:20:04,976
What am I now?

459
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:09,731
Oh, Mother.

460
01:20:10,983 --> 01:20:12,817
What have I done?

461
01:20:13,319 --> 01:20:16,195
Love is unbound by limits.

462
01:20:21,243 --> 01:20:23,953
This love is like pain.

463
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,707
I am...

464
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:30,460
...I shall be...

465
01:20:31,462 --> 01:20:33,254
...yours.

466
01:20:59,324 --> 01:21:01,700
POWHATAN

467
01:21:54,839 --> 01:21:56,840
Come away.

468
01:22:00,803 --> 01:22:02,804
You must tell me why.

469
01:22:05,933 --> 01:22:10,937
- They can't hear. I've sent them away.
- He sees you mean to stay.

470
01:22:21,115 --> 01:22:23,116
They're coming.

471
01:22:27,789 --> 01:22:30,207
Make peace with him.

472
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:32,835
He won't accept peace.

473
01:22:33,003 --> 01:22:34,795
Why would he?

474
01:22:42,971 --> 01:22:46,015
- Come away.
- And where would we live?

475
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:50,311
In the woods?

476
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:53,314
On a treetop?

477
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:54,982
A hole in the ground?

478
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:19,216
You have to come with me into the fort.

479
01:23:19,425 --> 01:23:22,719
Your people will know you came here.
They'll find out soon enough.

480
01:25:13,124 --> 01:25:14,833
Go! On the double, gentlemen!

481
01:25:15,084 --> 01:25:16,418
God save the king!

482
01:25:16,586 --> 01:25:23,300
Port your pikes!
God save the king!

483
01:25:23,468 --> 01:25:24,801
Charge!

484
01:25:24,969 --> 01:25:29,306
And on the Swiss step,
gentlemen, march!

485
01:25:29,474 --> 01:25:32,976
St. George,
St. George, St. George, St. George...

486
01:25:33,144 --> 01:25:35,479
- Prepare to stand!
St. George, St. George...

487
01:25:35,647 --> 01:25:36,980
- Stand!
St. George!

488
01:25:37,148 --> 01:25:39,149
Musketeers, advance!

489
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:42,611
Fire!

490
01:26:01,382 --> 01:26:05,134
Hold the ground! Hold together, men!

491
01:28:04,131 --> 01:28:07,175
You're like a herd of deer!
- What are you waiting for?

492
01:28:07,343 --> 01:28:09,844
How can you own land?
This earth was made for such...

493
01:28:10,012 --> 01:28:12,722
...that shall improve it
and knows how to live!

494
01:28:14,642 --> 01:28:17,435
They have no sound, sir,
but I couldn't...

495
01:28:17,603 --> 01:28:19,104
Fire on him!

496
01:28:19,271 --> 01:28:22,315
What are you waiting for? Fire on him!

497
01:28:22,483 --> 01:28:24,192
You heathen bastards!

498
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,987
Please don't. Please. Please.

499
01:28:28,323 --> 01:28:30,032
Seeds of sulfur!

500
01:28:30,242 --> 01:28:34,161
Sons of fire!
Devils in the mouth of hell!

501
01:28:34,329 --> 01:28:36,414
Please don't, please don't, please don't.

502
01:28:47,676 --> 01:28:50,344
Retreat! Fall back!

503
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:15,077
Lord...

504
01:29:15,245 --> 01:29:17,456
...turn not away thy face.

505
01:29:24,839 --> 01:29:27,883
You desire not the death of a sinner.

506
01:29:29,385 --> 01:29:31,470
I have gone away from you.

507
01:29:34,682 --> 01:29:37,225
I have not harkened to your voice.

508
01:29:39,854 --> 01:29:41,396
Let us not be brought to nothing.

509
01:29:41,564 --> 01:29:45,567
Gather reinforcements!
They're climbing up the wall!

510
01:32:33,072 --> 01:32:35,198
The water is poison.

511
01:32:36,575 --> 01:32:39,243
They put a dead dog in the well.

512
01:32:40,913 --> 01:32:43,957
Can't go out to look for fish or game.

513
01:32:47,754 --> 01:32:49,922
How long can we last?

514
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:55,260
Starvation does fearful things to a man.

515
01:32:55,428 --> 01:32:57,179
I hate your hearts.

516
01:32:57,347 --> 01:32:59,682
I'm not sure I should have
the use of this hand again.

517
01:32:59,849 --> 01:33:01,934
My value is the carcasses
of unburied men.

518
01:33:02,102 --> 01:33:04,603
Something you're not telling us.
I got a right to know.

519
01:33:04,771 --> 01:33:07,272
- What was they shouting?
Tired of your contempt.

520
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,233
What did you do to them?

521
01:33:09,401 --> 01:33:11,151
You don't know where you are.

522
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:13,696
Something you're not telling us.

523
01:33:14,698 --> 01:33:16,782
Like a wasp in a bottle.

524
01:33:18,284 --> 01:33:19,868
Trapped.

525
01:33:20,036 --> 01:33:22,287
To give light to them.

526
01:33:22,455 --> 01:33:24,456
Deliver us from evil.

527
01:33:24,624 --> 01:33:26,834
Not sit in darkness.

528
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:31,130
Deal not with us after our sins.

529
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:34,801
All thy people.

530
01:33:34,969 --> 01:33:39,222
I have become, as it were,
a monster unto many.

531
01:33:39,974 --> 01:33:42,100
Cast me not away.

532
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:47,981
Make me a clean heart.

533
01:34:29,524 --> 01:34:30,858
Tell him.

534
01:34:31,026 --> 01:34:32,902
The princess is up the river at Pastancy.

535
01:34:33,111 --> 01:34:34,987
They sent her
to her Uncle Patowomeck...

536
01:34:35,155 --> 01:34:37,239
...lord of the naked devils
of that region...

537
01:34:37,407 --> 01:34:39,408
...and, by the by,
an acquaintance of mine.

538
01:34:39,618 --> 01:34:42,536
So I get talking to his nibs,
and he proposes to sell her.

539
01:34:42,704 --> 01:34:45,873
He says with her at the fort,
the emperor will not dare attack us.

540
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:48,709
- He dotes on her.
- You're certain she's the one you saw?

541
01:34:48,877 --> 01:34:51,879
With these eyes.
I spoke to the king directly.

542
01:34:52,047 --> 01:34:54,381
And what does this rogue
propose to sell her for?

543
01:34:54,549 --> 01:34:57,551
Well, I was getting to that.
His most favorite thing is combs.

544
01:34:57,719 --> 01:35:00,846
But in this case, he seems to have
his heart set on a kettle.

545
01:35:01,014 --> 01:35:04,183
You know, a copper kettle,
like my mother had for making stew.

546
01:35:04,351 --> 01:35:08,062
What use he means to make
of the instrument I cannot say.

547
01:35:11,066 --> 01:35:12,858
Well?

548
01:35:13,026 --> 01:35:14,902
We don't take hostages.

549
01:35:15,071 --> 01:35:16,571
King James would not approve.

550
01:35:16,739 --> 01:35:20,242
- You'd rather see us annihilated?
- She's done enough for us.

551
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:24,204
She risked the beating in
of her own brains to save mine.

552
01:35:24,372 --> 01:35:25,831
Come, Argall, threaten me!

553
01:35:25,998 --> 01:35:28,500
Had she not fed us,
you would have starved.

554
01:35:28,668 --> 01:35:30,418
Then I'd know I was gonna live
for 1000 years.

555
01:35:30,586 --> 01:35:33,088
She's been the instrument
to preserve this colony from disaster.

556
01:35:33,256 --> 01:35:36,591
I'll not return her kindness
by making her a captive.

557
01:35:36,759 --> 01:35:40,804
She and her lot
are on the verge of killing us all.

558
01:35:42,765 --> 01:35:47,185
I expect there will be scarce a handful alive
when the boats return, if they ever do.

559
01:35:48,062 --> 01:35:51,606
You told us yourself that her father
regards her as no one else.

560
01:35:55,695 --> 01:35:59,489
Or do you have private reasons
for this attitude of yours?

561
01:36:02,952 --> 01:36:04,953
Return to your post.

562
01:36:09,293 --> 01:36:12,670
The penalty for disobeying
an order of the president is hanging.

563
01:36:12,838 --> 01:36:14,463
You're breaking the laws.

564
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:16,632
This is mutiny.

565
01:36:17,009 --> 01:36:18,593
Me breaking the laws.

566
01:36:22,389 --> 01:36:25,349
I have information Smith here...

567
01:36:26,143 --> 01:36:30,730
...is planning to marry the wench
and make himself king of Virginia.

568
01:36:43,994 --> 01:36:46,579
You're no longer in command, Smitty.

569
01:36:46,747 --> 01:36:49,332
I shall wear the medal now.

570
01:36:49,499 --> 01:36:52,126
You've been derelict
in your duties to the king.

571
01:36:52,294 --> 01:36:54,670
You've betrayed
these citizens of Jamestown.

572
01:36:55,672 --> 01:36:58,258
I therefore pronounce you unwon'thy...

573
01:36:58,468 --> 01:37:00,177
...of being a member of this colony.

574
01:37:00,345 --> 01:37:01,845
You are no longer in command, Smitty!

575
01:37:03,264 --> 01:37:07,768
Oh, oh, high and mighty, lord and ruler.

576
01:37:07,936 --> 01:37:09,686
No! No!

577
01:37:09,854 --> 01:37:11,939
We must have order, huh?

578
01:37:12,106 --> 01:37:13,982
We can't have everyone
running around...

579
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:16,193
...giving themselves airs and graces...

580
01:37:16,361 --> 01:37:18,779
...because then...
Then we would have chaos, huh?

581
01:37:19,364 --> 01:37:21,782
- Scream.
Come near.

582
01:37:22,033 --> 01:37:23,992
- Getting the strokes.
Come near me.

583
01:37:24,202 --> 01:37:26,745
You say... You say,
"Friend, friend, dear friend...

584
01:37:26,913 --> 01:37:29,039
...I pray to the gods...
You touch me now.

585
01:37:29,207 --> 01:37:32,334
...for your good health
for the rest of my life, I will. "

586
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,462
No man shows me disrespect.

587
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:37,214
In all things...

588
01:37:38,299 --> 01:37:40,175
...may I stand by you.

589
01:37:40,343 --> 01:37:41,927
Put him to hard labor.

590
01:37:43,304 --> 01:37:48,058
Send him to the forest
to hew fresh timbers for the walls.

591
01:37:50,145 --> 01:37:52,480
Set him by the heels
each night when he's done...

592
01:37:52,648 --> 01:37:55,650
...that through the long watches
he might reflect on his transgressions.

593
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,650
Put it down!

594
01:39:18,818 --> 01:39:20,819
Look behind you!

595
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:30,788
Move back.
Now you are the future, barking dog!

596
01:39:35,127 --> 01:39:36,961
Oh, Mother...

597
01:39:37,129 --> 01:39:40,173
...has he sent this ship for me?

598
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:50,683
Conscience is nuisance.

599
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:54,020
A fly.

600
01:39:54,438 --> 01:39:57,023
A barking dog.

601
01:39:58,275 --> 01:40:00,276
If you don't believe you have one...

602
01:40:00,444 --> 01:40:03,279
...what trouble can it be to you?

603
01:40:18,838 --> 01:40:20,797
Mother...

604
01:40:22,007 --> 01:40:25,136
...you are my strength...

605
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:28,973
...or I have none.

606
01:40:49,744 --> 01:40:52,413
Throw us your forward line!

607
01:40:58,086 --> 01:40:59,920
The president.

608
01:41:00,297 --> 01:41:02,923
Yes, I neglected to tell you.

609
01:41:03,758 --> 01:41:06,760
The captairs no longer
occupying that post.

610
01:41:07,095 --> 01:41:10,431
He will be able to explain the reasons
better than I.

611
01:41:50,473 --> 01:41:52,390
It's the princess.

612
01:42:02,026 --> 01:42:03,818
This will be your house, my lady.

613
01:42:03,986 --> 01:42:06,155
Reverend Whitaker,
the one what lived here...

614
01:42:06,323 --> 01:42:08,991
...well, he's...
He's dead and gone now, so...

615
01:43:32,118 --> 01:43:35,162
The ships returned, firing their cannons...

616
01:43:35,663 --> 01:43:38,749
...causing the naturals to sue for peace.

617
01:45:00,166 --> 01:45:02,668
They said they were going to fetch you.

618
01:45:03,169 --> 01:45:05,129
I was against it.

619
01:45:25,483 --> 01:45:27,651
I didn't wanna harm you.

620
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:33,324
There's disaster all around. We should
have stopped before it was too late.

621
01:46:04,982 --> 01:46:07,233
What is right?

622
01:46:07,401 --> 01:46:09,402
Give.

623
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:12,739
Wrong? Who is this man?

624
01:46:15,784 --> 01:46:17,494
Now...

625
01:46:19,455 --> 01:46:21,331
...all is perfect.

626
01:46:21,499 --> 01:46:23,209
Let me be lost.

627
01:46:23,376 --> 01:46:25,252
True.

628
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:28,130
You flow through me...

629
01:46:30,342 --> 01:46:32,676
...like a river.

630
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:37,973
Come.

631
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:40,976
Follow me.

632
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:52,821
Oh, Lord, thank you.

633
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:56,033
Captain.

634
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:18,431
Very well.

635
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:21,518
Leave us alone.

636
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:27,357
You wish to bring charges
against this man?

637
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:29,568
Are you sure?

638
01:47:29,735 --> 01:47:33,446
Well, fine then, Argall,
enough of your quarrels. Be off.

639
01:47:41,831 --> 01:47:44,249
I have news for you.

640
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:48,587
The king wants you
to return to England...

641
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:51,673
...to prepare an expedition
of your own.

642
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:54,259
To chart the northern coasts...

643
01:47:54,427 --> 01:47:58,305
...to see if you might find
a passage to the Indies.

644
01:47:59,348 --> 01:48:02,309
I remember when you had
sight and ambition.

645
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:05,062
Shall you not press on?

646
01:48:05,814 --> 01:48:10,860
Shall you be a discoverer of passages
which you yourself refuse to explore...

647
01:48:11,028 --> 01:48:14,530
...beyond the threshold, that is?

648
01:48:16,199 --> 01:48:19,952
King has great hopes for you.
Plans.

649
01:48:25,167 --> 01:48:28,377
Um, she's to take care of you now.

650
01:48:28,545 --> 01:48:30,630
My name's Mary.

651
01:48:30,797 --> 01:48:32,506
- And yours, I believe is...
- Oh, no...

652
01:48:32,674 --> 01:48:35,051
...she says that's not
her name anymore.

653
01:48:35,218 --> 01:48:37,053
She hasn't got a name.

654
01:48:37,262 --> 01:48:39,013
How unfortunate.

655
01:48:39,181 --> 01:48:41,807
Well, we shall have to give you one.

656
01:48:53,487 --> 01:48:55,196
Here.

657
01:48:58,910 --> 01:49:00,994
Rub with the towel.

658
01:49:01,329 --> 01:49:05,582
I will find joy in all I see.

659
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:08,251
Where am I going? Mother.

660
01:49:09,587 --> 01:49:11,922
- Fast.
Just little steps.

661
01:49:13,257 --> 01:49:15,008
So fast. I want my love.

662
01:49:15,176 --> 01:49:16,593
Oh.

663
01:49:18,262 --> 01:49:20,138
To go to him.

664
01:49:20,306 --> 01:49:22,641
The river. Living water.

665
01:49:22,809 --> 01:49:24,518
To meet him.

666
01:49:25,436 --> 01:49:27,396
Where does it come from?

667
01:49:29,941 --> 01:49:31,400
Where is it going?

668
01:49:31,567 --> 01:49:34,027
Why do they want gold?

669
01:49:36,155 --> 01:49:38,407
Can't they make it?

670
01:49:42,286 --> 01:49:44,579
We shall lose not only our lives...
- Do they eat it?

671
01:49:44,747 --> 01:49:46,123
...and our land...

672
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:47,917
...but our eternal birthright.

673
01:49:48,085 --> 01:49:50,294
Look beyond these gates.

674
01:49:50,462 --> 01:49:52,255
Eden lies about us still.

675
01:49:53,173 --> 01:49:56,926
We have escaped the Old World
and its bondage.

676
01:49:57,094 --> 01:49:59,011
Let us make a new beginning...

677
01:49:59,179 --> 01:50:02,515
...and create a fresh example
for humanity.

678
01:50:02,683 --> 01:50:05,560
We are the pioneers of the world.

679
01:50:05,728 --> 01:50:08,312
The advance guard sent on
through the wilderness...

680
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:11,065
...to break a new path.

681
01:50:12,943 --> 01:50:17,155
And our youth is our strength,
and our inexperience our wisdom.

682
01:50:18,115 --> 01:50:19,490
God has given us...

683
01:50:19,658 --> 01:50:23,286
...a promised land, a great ineritance.

684
01:50:23,454 --> 01:50:27,915
Woe betide if ever
we turn our back on him.

685
01:50:28,709 --> 01:50:33,129
Let us prepare a land
where a man may rise...

686
01:50:33,338 --> 01:50:34,630
...to his true stature.

687
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:40,554
A land of the future,
a new kingdom of the spirit.

688
01:50:40,722 --> 01:50:43,557
Remember what this country was...

689
01:51:26,309 --> 01:51:28,560
Am I as you like?

690
01:51:32,817 --> 01:51:34,692
His eyes.

691
01:51:40,866 --> 01:51:44,536
You knew me as I was...

692
01:51:44,745 --> 01:51:46,663
...long ago.

693
01:51:48,874 --> 01:51:52,085
I have never truly been the man
I seem to you to be.

694
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:54,921
What does he say?

695
01:51:55,089 --> 01:51:58,424
Come, let's sit by the river.

696
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,678
Mean?

697
01:52:06,016 --> 01:52:09,269
I can't sleep till I see you again.

698
01:52:09,854 --> 01:52:10,895
Look up.

699
01:52:13,774 --> 01:52:15,900
You have no evil.

700
01:52:18,237 --> 01:52:20,738
I belong to you.

701
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:32,793
He knows.

702
01:52:40,886 --> 01:52:42,803
Where am I?

703
01:52:59,905 --> 01:53:01,947
Wait two months...

704
01:53:02,824 --> 01:53:05,034
...then tell her I am dead.

705
01:53:05,577 --> 01:53:07,578
Drowned.

706
01:54:47,806 --> 01:54:49,807
Like that.

707
01:54:59,402 --> 01:55:02,446
He's left you, princess.

708
01:55:02,989 --> 01:55:05,198
He told you a pack of lies.

709
01:55:05,408 --> 01:55:07,451
Forget about him.

710
01:55:26,596 --> 01:55:29,890
I, uh, have some terrible news.

711
01:55:32,143 --> 01:55:35,979
Captain Smith is dead.
He drowned in the crossing.

712
01:55:39,358 --> 01:55:41,693
He loved you very much.

713
01:56:27,533 --> 01:56:28,991
Unwed.

714
01:56:32,204 --> 01:56:34,622
Where is your love now?

715
01:56:41,673 --> 01:56:43,382
Where is our child?

716
01:56:51,224 --> 01:56:55,519
You have gone away with my life.

717
01:57:00,650 --> 01:57:03,360
Killed the god in me.

718
01:58:08,302 --> 01:58:10,845
Does the sun see this?

719
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:36,664
On the bed of fate, we lie.

720
01:58:53,181 --> 01:58:55,349
We can enter you.

721
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:00,771
Question you.

722
01:59:09,197 --> 01:59:11,031
I mourn.

723
01:59:13,244 --> 01:59:15,036
I grieve.

724
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,543
Take my hand, Father.

725
02:00:28,487 --> 02:00:30,279
Scorned.

726
02:00:31,573 --> 02:00:34,033
Cast out, cut off.

727
02:00:35,285 --> 02:00:37,119
A dog.

728
02:00:42,417 --> 02:00:45,419
Come, death.

729
02:00:46,004 --> 02:00:47,838
Take me.

730
02:00:50,425 --> 02:00:52,426
Set me free.

731
02:00:57,517 --> 02:01:00,185
Let me be what I was.

732
02:04:47,375 --> 02:04:52,463
When first I saw her,
she was regarded as someone finished.

733
02:04:52,964 --> 02:04:55,758
Broken, lost.

734
02:05:05,143 --> 02:05:08,395
She seemed barely to notice
the others about her.

735
02:05:33,255 --> 02:05:36,966
Um, I would like to spend
the afternoon with you.

736
02:05:41,097 --> 02:05:43,056
How do I ask?

737
02:05:48,604 --> 02:05:53,191
A nature like yours
can turn trouble into good.

738
02:05:54,944 --> 02:05:57,987
All this sorrow will give you strength...

739
02:05:58,197 --> 02:06:01,032
...and point you on a higher way.

740
02:06:02,244 --> 02:06:07,164
Think of a tree,
how it grows around its wounds.

741
02:06:07,332 --> 02:06:10,835
If a branch breaks off, it don't stop...

742
02:06:11,002 --> 02:06:15,256
...but keeps reaching towards the light.

743
02:06:16,466 --> 02:06:21,971
We must meet misfortune boldly,
and not suffer it to frighten us.

744
02:06:22,889 --> 02:06:25,558
We must act the play out...

745
02:06:25,726 --> 02:06:29,562
...then live our troubles down, my lady.

746
02:06:42,242 --> 02:06:44,285
April, May...

747
02:06:44,453 --> 02:06:47,997
...and June, July, August.

748
02:06:48,165 --> 02:06:51,250
- What is a day?
- A day?

749
02:06:51,418 --> 02:06:53,503
An hour?

750
02:06:53,755 --> 02:06:56,381
An hour is 60 minutes.

751
02:06:58,217 --> 02:07:00,969
Why does the earth have colors?

752
02:07:27,038 --> 02:07:29,706
Many passions have I endured.

753
02:07:30,833 --> 02:07:33,877
Daily, hourly.

754
02:07:35,379 --> 02:07:37,464
Even in my sleep.

755
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:42,219
Awaking me to astonishment.

756
02:07:43,054 --> 02:07:45,556
This love has become...

757
02:07:46,225 --> 02:07:48,476
...such a labyrinth...

758
02:07:48,769 --> 02:07:51,395
...that I no longer know...
Were you sad...

759
02:07:51,563 --> 02:07:53,564
...how to wind myself out from it.

760
02:07:53,732 --> 02:07:56,359
...to lose your wife and daughter?

761
02:08:03,742 --> 02:08:05,243
Name this person.

762
02:08:05,744 --> 02:08:07,245
Rebecca.

763
02:08:07,412 --> 02:08:09,413
Rebecca, I baptize thee...

764
02:08:09,581 --> 02:08:12,041
...in the name
of the Father and the Son...

765
02:08:12,209 --> 02:08:15,628
...and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

766
02:08:20,759 --> 02:08:23,261
She has accepted my invitation
to work in the fields.

767
02:08:23,428 --> 02:08:24,929
For Rebecca.

768
02:08:25,097 --> 02:08:26,931
She'll be missed.

769
02:08:27,099 --> 02:08:29,767
She understands
the culture of tobacco.

770
02:08:29,935 --> 02:08:31,936
She's a good lass.

771
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:38,443
The people were sorry at her going.

772
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:57,023
Hours pass.

773
02:09:57,691 --> 02:10:00,485
She speaks not a word.

774
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:50,244
Who are you?

775
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:55,791
What do you dream of?

776
02:10:58,420 --> 02:11:00,421
We're like grass.

777
02:11:18,691 --> 02:11:20,608
Are you kind?

778
02:12:13,330 --> 02:12:16,332
She weaves all things together.

779
02:12:22,798 --> 02:12:25,341
I touched her long ago...

780
02:12:25,842 --> 02:12:28,385
...without knowing her name.

781
02:12:49,032 --> 02:12:51,242
All sings to her.

782
02:13:09,595 --> 02:13:12,389
Suppose I asked you to marry me.
What would you say?

783
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:20,021
Are you asking me?

784
02:13:23,359 --> 02:13:25,485
Where would we live?

785
02:13:25,653 --> 02:13:27,320
Here.

786
02:13:28,573 --> 02:13:33,285
England, if you wish.
Perhaps that would be best. We could...

787
02:13:33,536 --> 02:13:36,705
Well, you could forget your life
in this place.

788
02:13:52,097 --> 02:13:54,348
Why do you shrink from me?

789
02:13:59,271 --> 02:14:01,772
Wort you say yes?

790
02:14:08,071 --> 02:14:10,072
If you like.

791
02:14:13,368 --> 02:14:15,828
This isn't what I expected.

792
02:14:15,996 --> 02:14:17,455
Rebecca.

793
02:14:19,249 --> 02:14:21,042
I'm sorry.

794
02:14:23,253 --> 02:14:26,130
Why are you crying?

795
02:14:30,219 --> 02:14:32,386
I suppose...

796
02:14:33,555 --> 02:14:35,766
...I must be happy.

797
02:14:38,478 --> 02:14:40,938
You do not love me now.

798
02:14:41,689 --> 02:14:43,815
Someday you will.

799
02:14:57,747 --> 02:15:00,582
You're not ignorant to the displeasure
which God conceived...

800
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:05,712
...against the sons of Levi and Israel
for marrying strange wives.

801
02:15:06,506 --> 02:15:08,006
No.

802
02:15:08,716 --> 02:15:11,843
Would you do anything
necessary to bring this about?

803
02:15:12,345 --> 02:15:13,679
Yes.

804
02:15:17,934 --> 02:15:19,810
Would you write a petition...

805
02:15:19,978 --> 02:15:22,104
...explaining as the wealthiest
planter in Virginia...

806
02:15:22,272 --> 02:15:25,148
The governor requires a letter...
The benefit?

807
02:15:25,316 --> 02:15:28,528
...stating acceptable reasons for our union.

808
02:15:28,696 --> 02:15:32,699
Could you state your hope that this might
begin the work of converting the naturals?

809
02:15:32,866 --> 02:15:36,703
That this idea came to you in no way
through any carnal affection...

810
02:15:37,913 --> 02:15:42,375
...but for the good of the plantation.
For the honor of your country.

811
02:15:42,543 --> 02:15:45,295
And your own soul.

812
02:15:46,130 --> 02:15:49,465
Humiliated.
- To save an unbelieving creature...

813
02:15:49,633 --> 02:15:52,218
And yet he does not touch me.

814
02:15:53,554 --> 02:15:55,972
If this be not your true intent...

815
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:58,099
...would you do that?

816
02:15:59,476 --> 02:16:00,977
Yes.

817
02:16:02,354 --> 02:16:06,149
Then surely you do love her, Mr. Rolfe.

818
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:13,364
Write.

819
02:16:27,922 --> 02:16:29,715
I require and charge you...

820
02:16:29,883 --> 02:16:33,427
...as you will answer
on the dreadful Day of Judgment...

821
02:16:33,636 --> 02:16:37,931
...when the secrets
of all hearts are disclosed...

822
02:16:38,975 --> 02:16:41,685
...that if you know any impediment...

823
02:16:41,853 --> 02:16:46,231
...why you should not be
lawfully joined together in matrimony...

824
02:16:46,399 --> 02:16:48,108
...you will confess it.

825
02:18:02,978 --> 02:18:04,812
Mother...

826
02:18:05,939 --> 02:18:08,357
...why can I not feel as I should?

827
02:18:12,821 --> 02:18:14,530
Must?

828
02:18:21,121 --> 02:18:23,164
Once false...

829
02:18:23,331 --> 02:18:26,125
...I must not be again.

830
02:18:31,047 --> 02:18:33,674
Take out the thorn.

831
02:18:47,856 --> 02:18:50,274
He is like a tree.

832
02:18:52,778 --> 02:18:55,155
He shelters me.

833
02:18:58,075 --> 02:19:00,660
I lie in his shade.

834
02:19:19,305 --> 02:19:22,057
Can I ignore my heart?

835
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:33,818
What is from you...

836
02:19:34,195 --> 02:19:36,530
...and what is not?

837
02:20:04,309 --> 02:20:07,979
Great Sun, I offer you thanks.

838
02:20:09,022 --> 02:20:10,815
You give life to the trees...

839
02:20:11,525 --> 02:20:13,401
...and hills.

840
02:20:15,654 --> 02:20:18,114
To the streams of water.

841
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:23,160
To all.

842
02:20:49,022 --> 02:20:50,772
Mother...

843
02:20:52,025 --> 02:20:53,442
...your love...

844
02:20:53,610 --> 02:20:56,153
...is before my eyes.

845
02:20:59,991 --> 02:21:02,284
Show me your way.

846
02:21:05,496 --> 02:21:07,956
Teach me your path.

847
02:21:13,212 --> 02:21:17,007
Give me a humble heart.

848
02:21:17,175 --> 02:21:19,843
We've had some surprising news.

849
02:21:20,970 --> 02:21:22,512
We've been invited to England...

850
02:21:23,890 --> 02:21:25,642
...by the king and queen.

851
02:21:28,562 --> 02:21:30,396
There will be...

852
02:21:30,564 --> 02:21:33,191
...a royal audience in your honor.

853
02:21:35,235 --> 02:21:36,819
You're known to them all.

854
02:23:02,449 --> 02:23:05,701
Gave him up to pirates
when his ship was stopped.

855
02:23:05,869 --> 02:23:07,996
Five years before he could
get a commission.

856
02:23:08,164 --> 02:23:10,498
Five years.

857
02:23:13,669 --> 02:23:15,670
All them ships
went off to Newfoundland.

858
02:23:15,838 --> 02:23:17,505
Yes.
Who would have guessed?

859
02:23:17,673 --> 02:23:20,508
He poked around the north,
then he went home.

860
02:23:20,676 --> 02:23:22,469
Captain Smith.

861
02:23:23,387 --> 02:23:25,180
Yeah, he could make you laugh.

862
02:23:26,056 --> 02:23:28,057
Things are different now.

863
02:23:28,851 --> 02:23:30,518
They've sent him back to London.

864
02:23:30,686 --> 02:23:34,522
What a shame. They say
he's done much for this place.

865
02:23:38,527 --> 02:23:41,362
Captain Smith is alive?

866
02:23:44,533 --> 02:23:46,576
You saw him?

867
02:24:48,431 --> 02:24:50,433
I cannot do that.

868
02:24:51,435 --> 02:24:52,936
Why not?

869
02:24:54,438 --> 02:24:58,859
It would mean something I do not feel.

870
02:24:59,777 --> 02:25:01,570
What's come over you?

871
02:25:04,824 --> 02:25:06,700
I'm married...

872
02:25:07,285 --> 02:25:09,077
...to him.

873
02:25:09,954 --> 02:25:11,621
He lives.

874
02:25:12,498 --> 02:25:14,708
I heard it by the fort.

875
02:25:15,793 --> 02:25:17,794
He's still alive.

876
02:25:22,466 --> 02:25:24,134
Married?

877
02:25:24,594 --> 02:25:28,346
You don't know the meaning
of the word exactly.

878
02:25:30,141 --> 02:25:31,808
But I am.

879
02:25:50,913 --> 02:25:52,872
Sweet wife...

880
02:25:58,253 --> 02:26:00,922
...love made the bond.

881
02:26:01,798 --> 02:26:04,675
Love can break it too.

882
02:26:27,866 --> 02:26:30,076
There is that in her...

883
02:26:30,243 --> 02:26:32,578
...I shall not know.

884
02:29:10,074 --> 02:29:12,367
Stand aside, I say!

885
02:30:26,359 --> 02:30:27,860
- Homage sweetly pay

886
02:30:28,028 --> 02:30:30,446
Whilst towering in the azure sky

887
02:30:30,614 --> 02:30:33,115
They celebrate this happy day.

888
02:30:33,283 --> 02:30:36,035
Let rolling streams their gladness show

889
02:30:36,203 --> 02:30:38,871
With gentle murmurs whilst they play

890
02:30:39,039 --> 02:30:41,415
And in their wild meanders flow

891
02:30:41,583 --> 02:30:44,752
Rejoicing in this blessed day.

892
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:47,922
Kind health descends on downy wings

893
02:30:48,089 --> 02:30:50,383
Angels conduct her on the way

894
02:30:50,551 --> 02:30:53,220
The New World's Princess
New life brings

895
02:30:53,387 --> 02:30:55,972
And swells our joys upon this day.

896
02:33:17,909 --> 02:33:19,618
Mother...

897
02:33:20,411 --> 02:33:22,496
...stay near me.

898
02:35:08,522 --> 02:35:10,398
Sweet wife...

899
02:35:11,734 --> 02:35:14,277
...do you care for me still?

900
02:35:22,745 --> 02:35:26,539
I cannot be to you what I am not.

901
02:35:30,419 --> 02:35:34,589
She would never have married me
had she known that he were alive.

902
02:35:39,053 --> 02:35:43,348
She bound herself to me in ignorance,
and I will not...

903
02:35:44,141 --> 02:35:48,436
I will not let her be encumbered
by a tie which she despises...

904
02:35:48,604 --> 02:35:50,605
...and enter to her mischief.

905
02:35:53,442 --> 02:35:55,443
I will do nothing against her will.

906
02:36:33,567 --> 02:36:35,985
I think you still love the man...

907
02:36:36,444 --> 02:36:40,447
...and that you will not be at peace
until you see him.

908
02:36:42,158 --> 02:36:45,744
In my vanity, I thought...

909
02:36:46,788 --> 02:36:48,247
...I could make you love me...

910
02:36:48,416 --> 02:36:52,919
...and one cannot do that, or should not.

911
02:36:58,467 --> 02:37:00,760
You have walked...

912
02:37:01,470 --> 02:37:03,138
...blindly...

913
02:37:03,306 --> 02:37:05,724
...into a situation
that you did not anticipate.

914
02:37:05,891 --> 02:37:10,186
I will not rob you of your self-respect.

915
02:37:21,240 --> 02:37:24,117
You are the man I thought you were.

916
02:37:26,078 --> 02:37:27,871
And more.

917
02:38:33,606 --> 02:38:36,108
Did I make a mistake in coming here?

918
02:38:38,444 --> 02:38:40,445
I would have come before...

919
02:38:40,613 --> 02:38:42,906
...except I've been
away from the capital.

920
02:38:47,078 --> 02:38:51,039
Perhaps I'm out of order
speaking with you this way...

921
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,460
...but I've thought of you often.

922
02:39:00,299 --> 02:39:03,635
So after I left, it went well for you.

923
02:39:05,138 --> 02:39:07,055
I heard the king and queen received you.

924
02:39:07,223 --> 02:39:09,266
Everybody says you were
a great favorite.

925
02:39:09,434 --> 02:39:11,852
They all speak of you.
One hears them in the streets.

926
02:39:12,019 --> 02:39:15,564
"Her Ladyship. "
Who would have guessed it?

927
02:39:58,609 --> 02:40:00,193
You knew...

928
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:02,445
...I had promise.

929
02:40:02,821 --> 02:40:05,865
- Didrt you?
- Yes.

930
02:40:16,127 --> 02:40:18,378
Did you find your Indies, John?

931
02:40:25,512 --> 02:40:27,471
You shall.

932
02:40:39,234 --> 02:40:41,652
I may have sailed past them.

933
02:41:01,714 --> 02:41:04,258
I thought it was a dream...

934
02:41:05,261 --> 02:41:07,679
...what we knew in the forest.

935
02:41:10,266 --> 02:41:12,600
It's the only truth.

936
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:23,236
It seems as if I were
speaking to you for the first time.

937
02:43:05,132 --> 02:43:07,384
Could we not go home?

938
02:43:09,887 --> 02:43:12,222
As soon as possible.

939
02:43:29,115 --> 02:43:31,408
My husband.

940
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:32,596
Listen.

941
02:44:58,498 --> 02:45:00,123
Thomas.

942
02:45:00,666 --> 02:45:01,666
Where?

943
02:45:19,685 --> 02:45:21,521
Mother...

944
02:45:21,814 --> 02:45:24,107
...now I know where you live.

945
02:45:31,824 --> 02:45:34,826
Thirteenth of April, 1616.

946
02:45:35,035 --> 02:45:37,078
Mother. Mother.
Dear son:

947
02:45:37,246 --> 02:45:39,372
I write this so that someday
in the future...

948
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:41,457
...you might understand
a circumstance...

949
02:45:41,625 --> 02:45:45,086
...which shall be
but a far memory to you.

950
02:45:48,215 --> 02:45:50,091
Your dear mother, Rebecca...

951
02:45:50,259 --> 02:45:52,844
...fell ill in our outward passage...

952
02:45:53,011 --> 02:45:54,554
...at Gravesend.

953
02:45:58,976 --> 02:46:01,853
She gently reminded me that all must die.

954
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:06,440
"'Tis enough," she said, "that you,
our child, should live. "

955
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,086
