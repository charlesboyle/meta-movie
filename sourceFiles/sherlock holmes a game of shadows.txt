2
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,993
<i>The year was 1891.</i>

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,537
<i>Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.</i>

4
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,459
<i>France and Germany
were at each other's throats...</i>

5
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,545
<i>...the result of a series of bombings</i>

6
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,758
<i>Some said it was Nationalists...</i>

7
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,386
<i>others, the anarchists</i>

8
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
<i>But as usual...</i>

9
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>...my friend Sherlock Holmes...</i>

10
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,727
<i>...had a different theory entirely.</i>

11
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,862
<i>Bombing in Strasbourg! Read all about it!</i>

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,490
- Thank you.
- Anarchists suspected...

13
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,118
...in Strasbourg bombing!

14
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,422
Bombing in Strasbourg!

15
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,334
When did you start working
for the postal service?

16
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,503
That was you back there.

17
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,298
Shame your activities
have landed you in the gutter.

18
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,593
A curious parcel.
Who's the intended recipient?

19
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,845
Why don't we discuss that
over dinner tonight?

20
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,056
- I'm free for lunch.
- Hmm. I'm not.

21
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,725
How about the Savoy, 8:00?

22
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:22,934
- Splendid.
- Hmm.

23
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,811
And will you be coming as yourself?

24
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,230
Most likely.

25
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,650
Three men have been following you
for the last half mile...

26
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,819
...their motives highly unsavory.

27
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,115
No.

28
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,002
Oh, and, by the way, they're not
pursuing me, they're escorting me.

29
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,173
And instead of three,
there seems to be, uh, four.

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,383
Heh.

31
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,677
Steady hands with that, Irene.

32
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,847
Oh, I don't think it's my hands
you have to worry about.

33
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,017
Be careful with the face, boys.
We do have a dinner date tonight.

34
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,602
Don't fill up on bread.

35
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,421
I forgot the rest.

36
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,801
Oh, it's coming back now.

37
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,115
Aah!

38
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,325
Aah!

39
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,915
Peelers!

40
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,987
We now come to Lot 34...

41
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:26,034
...Egyptian sarcophagus
of outstanding provenance...

42
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,161
...retrieved from the Valley of the Kings.

43
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,580
Your payment, doctor.
He sends his thanks.

44
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,333
Who will bid 100 pounds?

45
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,627
One hundred. Thank you, sir.

46
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,173
Please, give this to him.
He's expecting it.

47
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,177
Tell him our friend thinks
I delivered it to his sister.

48
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,685
Uh... Stay...

49
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,728
...while I check the contents.

50
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,357
I was assured full payment
would be there.

51
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,318
Yes, but assured by whom?

52
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,195
Have you ever met him in person?

53
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,782
Or like me, have you been...?

54
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,868
Hold it, hold it. Please, don't move it.

55
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,706
Judging from size and weight,
it's not the payment you were expecting.

56
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,834
I'd wager the contents
are rather more incendiary.

57
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,336
- Who is this?
- It's...

58
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,546
Hello, darling.

59
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,055
Oh, dear. I told you not to move it. It seems
a secondary charge has been activated.

60
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,309
Sweet thing, I might need your help
in the disposal of this parcel.

61
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:37,230
One thousand six hundred, 1700, 1800.

62
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,357
- Well, good luck.
- One million pounds.

63
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,571
Oh, and by the way, fire.

64
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,947
Fire!

65
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,538
Leave my side,
you'll be dead in an hour.

66
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,248
And don't be late for dinner.

67
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,543
My schedule will be quite tight
because of these activities here.

68
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,422
- I've never been late in my life, only early.
- Fashionably.

69
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,424
Mm. Mm-mm. Mm!

70
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,385
Very witty. So confident, even in retreat.

71
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,680
I'll hold onto that.
We'll read it together over an aperitif.

72
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,351
Fine. Dinner and a show.

73
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,107
Stay. Trust me.
This is what I do for a living.

74
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,779
Herr Hoffmanstahl,
you should count yourself lucky.

75
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,617
This faceless man with whom you find yourself
in business is no ordinary criminal.

76
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:35,455
He's the Napoleon of crime.
Fortunately, you now have me as an ally.

77
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,875
I'm a consulting detective
of some repute.

78
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,753
Perhaps you've heard of me?
My name is Sherlock...

79
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,674
...Holmes.

80
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,883
Hyah!

81
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,346
A fresh pot of tea. Thank you, George.

82
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,306
Yes, Miss Adler.

83
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,769
Fine choice, this place.

84
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,981
Do you have the letter?

85
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,150
It was taken.

86
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,154
Taken? Now, that is unfortunate.

87
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,201
During the chaos created
by your package.

88
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,411
Thank you.

89
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,084
Perhaps if you had shared your plans.

90
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,504
You wish to know my plans now,
do you?

91
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:10,133
Did you imagine, Miss Adler,
that something would happen to you?

92
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,178
Is that why you chose to meet here
in a public place?

93
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,554
Your favorite restaurant?

94
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,005
I don't blame you.

95
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,675
I blame myself.

96
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:58,598
It's been apparent to me for some time that
you had succumbed to your feelings for him.

97
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:05,438
And this isn't the first occasion Mr. Holmes
has inconvenienced me in recent months.

98
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,149
The question is...

99
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,778
...what to do about it.

100
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:21,579
But that's my problem to solve now.

101
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,794
I no longer require your services.

102
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,510
Mrs. Hudson?

103
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,431
Oh, Mrs. Hudson?

104
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,144
Holmes, you in there?

105
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,154
Your hedge needs trimming.

106
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,242
HOLMES Where am I?

107
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,245
I don't care where you are
as long as you're ready.

108
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,335
I'm waiting.

109
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,715
I'm not gonna play this game.

110
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,136
Remember, I have to catch the last...

111
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,184
- ...train.
Uh-oh.

112
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,354
- That's you dead, I'm afraid.
- You win.

113
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,235
I lose. Game over.

114
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,114
Still don't see me?

115
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,959
I'm not going out with you
dressed like that.

116
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,380
Would you prefer I joined you
in the fashion faux pas...

117
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,758
...of wearing fine military dress
with that heinous handmade scarf...

118
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,302
...clearly one of your fiancée's
early efforts?

119
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,638
Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.

120
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,391
Have you? Why?

121
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,437
I've barely noticed your absence.
Then again, I'm knee-deep in research.

122
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,440
Extracting fluids from
the adrenal glands of sheep...

123
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,317
...and designing
my own urban camouflage...

124
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,029
...all the while verging
on a decisive breakthrough...

125
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:45,491
...in the single most important case
of my career, perhaps of all time.

126
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,911
Mrs. Hudson, how are you?

127
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,041
Oh. I'm so pleased to see you, doctor.
Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.

128
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,835
And thank you for looking after
Gladstone.

129
00:13:56,002 --> 00:14:01,966
Dear, dear sickly-sweet Nanny,
might I have a word?

130
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,679
Yummy. Feed the snake, woman.

131
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,931
You feed it.

132
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,518
Touchy, touchy.

133
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,230
Doctor, you must get him
to a sanatorium.

134
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,525
He's been on a diet of coffee, tobacco,
and coca leaves.

135
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,821
He never sleeps. I hear multiple voices
as if he's rehearsing a play.

136
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,033
Leave him to me.

137
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,827
Don't you have a goat
that needs worming?

138
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,455
Oh, how kind of you to remind me.

139
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,626
So much to look forward to.
What would I do without you?

140
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,796
Good luck with your patient, doctor.

141
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,048
Why are you here?

142
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,301
I'm getting married tomorrow.

143
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,554
Oh! Embrace me.

144
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,641
Watson's getting married.

145
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,186
- You've lost a few pounds, Holmes.
- Yes, and you've picked them up.

146
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,397
- Noshing on Mary's muffins, no doubt.
- Ha.

147
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,400
Pour us a brandy.
The stag party has begun.

148
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,738
It is our last adventure, Watson.

149
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,990
I intend to make the most of it.

150
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,921
I see you've made good use
of my old office.

151
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,091
- Do you like my spider's web?
- Is that what you call it?

152
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,717
Follow that strand.

153
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,431
What do a scandal involving
an Indian cotton tycoon...

154
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,725
...the overdose of
a Chinese opium trader...

155
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,894
...bombings in Strasbourg and Vienna...

156
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,523
...and the death of a steel magnate
in America all have in common?

157
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:48,114
Well, according to your diorama,
Professor James Moriarty.

158
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,323
Indeed.

159
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,579
Mathematical genius.
Celebrated author and lecturer.

160
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,330
Boxing champion at Cambridge...

161
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,458
...where he made friends
with our current prime minister.

162
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,295
Do you have any evidence
to substantiate your claim?

163
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,426
This. Now do you see?

164
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,805
Dr. Hoffmanstahl's death?
- Yes.

165
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,308
I've heard you speak of him,
extolling his virtues.

166
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,270
Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront
of medical innovations, a true pioneer.

167
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,982
Just the other day, I averted
an explosion that was intended for him.

168
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,235
Says here he died of a heart attack.

169
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,823
Has all my instruction been for naught? You
read the official statement and believe it.

170
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,326
It's a game, dear man, a shadowy game.

171
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,413
We're playing cat and mouse,
the professor and I. Cloak and dagger.

172
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,582
I thought it was spider and fly?

173
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,793
I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.

174
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,213
Not a mouse, but a dagger.

175
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,839
You're drinking embalming fluid.

176
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,676
Ooh. Yes. Care for a drop?

177
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,178
You do seem...

178
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,387
- Excited?
- Manic.

179
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,597
- I am.
- Verging on...

180
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,182
- Ecstatic?
- Psychotic.

181
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,103
- Should've brought a sedative.
- I'll give my life to see his demise.

182
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,524
He must be stopped before
his evil machinations come to a crescendo.

183
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,026
And how will he do all this?

184
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,988
Don't be a dingy bird. Bad people
do bad things because they can.

185
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,201
No one, not the victims, the police,
the governments, not anyone...

186
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,037
- Except the great Sherlock Holmes...
- Correct.

187
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,539
- ...on this diet, will work it all out.
- Right.

188
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,459
- Or thereabouts.
- Thereabouts, not quite there.

189
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,753
Here's to your good health.

190
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,714
Dingy bird.

191
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,304
What have you done to Gladstone now?

192
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,350
<i>Ricinus communis.</i>
The fruit is highly toxic.

193
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,893
He's barely breathing.

194
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,021
What an excellent opportunity.

195
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,356
This may be just the thing.

196
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,986
Sorry, do you mind terribly
if I try my adrenal extract?

197
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,571
How many times are you going
to kill my dog, Holmes?

198
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,535
Took off like a monkey from a box.

199
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,329
- Hmm.
- I may need one of those in a few hours.

200
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,081
Consider it a wedding gift.

201
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,585
Watson, might we use
an alternative exit?

202
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,089
Is there something different about you?

203
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,258
I'm under observation.

204
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,343
As you should be.

205
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,886
You drive.

206
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,893
Will your beard be with us all night?

207
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,564
I'll remove it once
we're south of Trafalgar Square.

208
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,276
If you believe Moriarty
has you under observation...

209
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,194
...isn't this a bit conspicuous?

210
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,656
It's so overt, it's covert.

211
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,621
Trafalgar Square.
You must be safe by now.

212
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,923
Why are you looking at me
with such concern?

213
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,720
I'm so very worried.
Your vitality's been drained from you.

214
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,640
- Marriage is the end, I tell you.
- I think of it as the beginning.

215
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,100
- Armageddon.
- Rebirth.

216
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,769
- Restriction.
- Structure.

217
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,605
- Answering to a woman.
- Being in a relationship.

218
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,109
A life in matrimony,
the possibility of a family.

219
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,903
Who wants to die alone?

220
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,114
We'll have a good old-fashioned
romp tonight...

221
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,785
...you'll settle down, have a family,
and I'll die alone.

222
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,287
Yes, that's about it.

223
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:30,836
Perhaps it's better for one to die alone
than to live life in eternal purgatory.

224
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,674
Anyway...

225
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,014
Not bad, that.

226
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,016
So where are we going?

227
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,812
In the future, there'll be one of
those machines in every town in Europe.

228
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,523
Loitering in the woodshed again,
are we, Myccie?

229
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,858
- Good evening, Sherly.
- Well.

230
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,694
I see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.

231
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,032
As I detect that you've recently changed
the brand of soap with which you shave.

232
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,368
The chimney in the front room
at Baker Street...

233
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,370
...still needs a damn good sweeping up.

234
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:08,374
Were you aware that the hackney carriage
by which you arrived had a damaged wheel?

235
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,335
Yes, the left. And it's plain
to the meanest intelligence...

236
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,922
...that you have recently
acquired a new bow for your violin.

237
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,799
Same bow, new strings.

238
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,344
And may I deduce, Mycroft...?
Good evening, by the way.

239
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,720
No.

240
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,807
- He doesn't.
- May I deduce that you...

241
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:30,146
...who rarely strays from the path that
runs from your home to the Diogenes Club...

242
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,899
...and never on a Monday when
they serve your favorite potted shrimps...

243
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:39,029
...must be here for some far more important
reason than my stag party?

244
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:45,077
You know, he's nothing like as slow-witted
as you'd been leading me to believe, Sherly.

245
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,996
No, you're quite right, Dr. Watson...

246
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:52,334
...but with all the conflict in Europe
at the moment, the whole situation could...

247
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,670
Excuse me.... suddenly erupt.

248
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:58,757
I am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

249
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,595
If the concerns of two nations...

250
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,722
...which shall remain nameless...

251
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:09,268
...but I can tell you they speak
French and German...

252
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,938
...are not dealt with tonight,
I shall be forced to go to Switzerland...

253
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,484
...to attend the ghastly peace summit
in Reichenbach.

254
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,944
The worst thing about Switzerland
is the altitude.

255
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,405
It gives me nosebleeds,
exacerbates my asthma-1...

256
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,867
I'm so glad you invited your brother.

257
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,425
This looks promising.

258
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,886
And your poison of choice, gentlemen?

259
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,722
We'll start with the champagne.
We may need several more chairs.

260
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,891
Perhaps a good cigar.

261
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,645
And don't bother with the chairs.

262
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,481
What is it your brother does exactly?

263
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,484
He's the keeper
of the broom cupboard of state.

264
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,361
No ambition, no energy...

265
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,323
...yet I'm repeatedly told that he's
indispensable to the British government...

266
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,116
...particularly the Foreign Office.

267
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,994
- I would like to propose a toast.
- Really?

268
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,206
To my dear friend, Dr. John...

269
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,752
...um, Hamish Watson...

270
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,962
I'm right here.

271
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,674
...On the eve of his wedding. He...

272
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,261
...has been the best companion.

273
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,138
Shouldn't we be waiting
for the boys from my rugby club?

274
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,724
He has always kept us...
They couldn't attend.

275
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,851
...flat-footed on the ground.

276
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,104
All of them? Hmm.
The chaps from my medical school?

277
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,356
- They declined.
- The lads from the regiment?

278
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,193
- No man's better worth having at your side...
- Who is it you're looking for?

279
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,988
Because I don't know a single
damn person here, do I?

280
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,699
There's no need for hysterics.
You know me and Mycroft.

281
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,035
- Don't be a ponce, Watson.
- Ponce?

282
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,373
You completely forgot about my stag party,
didn't you?

283
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,211
- Why are we here?
- Your very good health, doctor.

284
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,505
Shame none of your friends
could make it.

285
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,016
I'm going to the gaming tables.
I refuse for this night to be a total loss.

286
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,352
- Give me my money.
- Happily. Give me the wedding ring.

287
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,522
So now you're interested
in being the best man.

288
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,066
You're supposed to keep
the ring anyway.

289
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,902
Just as you're supposed to
organize my stag party.

290
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,739
- Don't want to lose it on a bet.
- And invite my friends...

291
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,576
...of which, by the way, there are many.
You're the one with no friends...

292
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,078
...Sherly No Mates.

293
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,877
He's all "me, me, me," isn't he?

294
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,597
I win!

295
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,360
Please, sit.

296
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,279
Put your money on the table
and we will begin.

297
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,913
Welcome. I am Madam Simza.

298
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:24,046
Cards can illuminate your past...

299
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,633
...clarify your present,
and show you the future.

300
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,639
If you have a specific question,
hold it in your mind.

301
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,265
Mm.

302
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,274
I'm holding.

303
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,152
Let me know when you're ready.

304
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,822
Actually, I'd prefer to read...

305
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,448
...your fortune.

306
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,414
Temperance inverted.

307
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,791
Indicative of volatility.

308
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,878
A woman who has recently
taken her comfort in drink.

309
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,424
From what does she seek solace?
What does she not wish to see?

310
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,511
- A fool embarrassing himself?
- Hmm.

311
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:16,014
- Hmm.
- Oh, yes. The Fool.

312
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,018
Someone has been led astray, involved
in something without their knowledge.

313
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,939
Not bad,
but you have to make me believe you.

314
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,524
I have to see it in your eyes.

315
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,360
- Right. I can do better.
- Uh-huh.

316
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,530
The Two of Cups, a powerful bond.

317
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,825
But between whom?
A brother and sister perhaps?

318
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,204
And I see a name. Yes, it's...

319
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,206
...Rene.

320
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,376
What do you want?

321
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:45,919
The Devil.

322
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,634
Why are we playing this game?

323
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,562
Where did you get this?

324
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:08,025
I stole it from a woman in an auction room,
but I believe it was intended for you.

325
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,375
"Found my purpose in life."

326
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,838
So the question I've been holding is,
what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

327
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,344
Time is up.

328
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,138
I have other clients.

329
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,522
Though you may not have detected
the wisp of astrakhan fur...

330
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,774
...snagged on a nail
over my left shoulder...

331
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,818
...you couldn't have failed to notice
the overpowering aroma...

332
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,946
...of herring pickled in vodka...

333
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,949
...in tandem with
a truly unfortunate body odor.

334
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,369
There's a man concealed
in the rafters above us.

335
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:04,122
A Cossack, renowned for
their infeasible acrobatic abilities...

336
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,793
...and are notorious for moonlighting
as assassins.

337
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,172
So it's safe to presume
that your next client is here to kill you.

338
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,967
Anything else? No?

339
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,226
<i>First, pillage the nest.</i>

340
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,689
<i>Clip wings.</i>

341
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,318
<i>Now blunt his beak.</i>

342
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,658
<i>Crack eggs.</i>

343
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,204
<i>Scramble. Pinch of salt.</i>

344
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,125
<i>Touch of pepper.</i>

345
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,090
<i>Flip the omelet.</i>

346
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,847
<i>Additional seasoning required.</i>

347
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,351
<i>Breakfast is served.</i>

348
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:23,619
Come with me. I need you alive. Now.

349
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,706
Oh!

350
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,300
Aah!

351
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,942
Didn't see that in the cards, did you?

352
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,114
Oh...

353
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,797
Coming down, folks, coming down.

354
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,800
Looks like we've got ourselves
our next cockfight.

355
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:08,223
Five, four, three, two, one...

356
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,891
...let him go!

357
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,461
Get up there!

358
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,346
All mine?

359
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,998
Now, wait a minute.

360
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,574
You're right. He did stink.

361
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,576
Hey, you can run...

362
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,829
Where's you?

363
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,291
Just had a fight.

364
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,920
- Just had a fight.
- Yes.

365
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,713
- Where were you?
- I'm glad to see...

366
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,424
...you're taking your best-man duties
so seriously.

367
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,262
I was on my own!
Not gonna get my monies!

368
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,888
She was biting my leg.

369
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,600
I'll have Carruthers put some fuel
into that motor carriage of yours.

370
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,435
You do have a wedding to attend.

371
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,770
Oh, I'll drive.

372
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,272
Hmm.

373
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,734
Ho-honk. Ha-ha-ha.

374
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,530
Let's have another drink.
- No, no, I think you've had quite enough.

375
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,068
Present arms!

376
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,224
I've been to a wedding here before.

377
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,895
Funeral too.

378
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,775
The professor wants to meet.

379
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,780
I'd expected to hear from him sooner,
in light of recent events.

380
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:21,119
He was wondering if it'd be convenient for
you to come by the college this afternoon.

381
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,455
His lecture concludes at 4.

382
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,664
Looking forward.

383
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,625
One side, chummy.

384
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,654
"Fischerweise," Schubert, 1826.

385
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,999
- "Give up your foolish trickery."
- "This fish you cannot cheat."

386
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,834
I hope I'm not intruding.

387
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,671
Excuse me. Matthew,
take these up to Mr. Williams.

388
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,924
And make sure he packs
my white tie and tails.

389
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,885
- I'll take care of it, professor.
- Thank you. I do apologize.

390
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:23,014
I'm off on a blasted lecture tour.
Would you care for some tea or coffee?

391
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,517
- Neither.
- Something stronger, perhaps?

392
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,521
No, but might I trouble you
for an inscription?

393
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,209
I read that the good doctor
was to be married today.

394
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,752
How was the service?

395
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,170
Definitive.

396
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:58,466
He'll no longer be party to my investigations.
He's out of the equation.

397
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,762
I trust you'll take this
into consideration.

398
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,686
And what considerations
will you grant me?

399
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,362
Have you actually read the book?

400
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,698
I found it compelling...

401
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:26,161
...though I'm primarily interested
in your more recent endeavors.

402
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,789
I take that as a compliment.

403
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,834
I have the utmost regard for your talents.

404
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,088
It's a pleasure to finally meet you...

405
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,215
...officially.

406
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,097
Are you familiar
with the study of graphology?

407
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,058
I've never given it
any serious thought, no.

408
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,812
The psychological analysis
of handwriting.

409
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:57,775
The upward strokes on the P, the J, and
the M indicate a genius-level intellect.

410
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,111
While the flourishes on the lower zone...

411
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,364
...denote a highly creative
yet meticulous nature.

412
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,868
But if one observes the overall slant
and the pressure of the writing...

413
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:11,456
...there's a suggestion of acute
narcissism, a complete lack of empathy...

414
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,167
- ...and a pronounced inclination toward...
- No.

415
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,960
...moral insanity.

416
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,883
In answer to your previous request
regarding Dr. Watson not being involved...

417
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,719
...the answer is no.

418
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:31,726
The laws of celestial mechanics dictate
that when two objects collide...

419
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,231
...there is always damage
of a collateral nature.

420
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,652
<i>Exempli gratia.</i>

421
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,948
Two gentlemen find themselves
at cross-purposes.

422
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,661
<i>A young woman torn between them.</i>

423
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,791
<i>The strain proves loo much for her,
and she suddenly falls ill...</i>

424
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,004
...with tragic consequences.

425
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:06,177
<i>A rare form of tuberculosis.</i>

426
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,014
She succumbed in a matter of seconds.

427
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,310
Now...

428
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,690
...are you sure you want
to play this game?

429
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,860
I'm afraid you'd lose.

430
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:30,618
Rest assured, if you attempt
to bring destruction down upon me...

431
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,037
...I shall do the same to you.

432
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:38,793
My respect for you, Mr. Holmes,
is the only reason you're still alive.

433
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,755
You've paid me several compliments.

434
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,632
Let me pay you one in return...

435
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,885
...when I say that if I were assured
of the former eventuality...

436
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,182
...I would cheerfully accept the latter.

437
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,565
I'll be sure to send my regards
to the happy couple.

438
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,821
Another time, then.

439
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,677
All aboard for Brighton! All aboard!

440
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,095
Which coach are we?

441
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,014
We should be just here.

442
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,892
Ooh.

443
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,894
First class.

444
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,358
All aboard for Brighton! All aboard!

445
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,611
Hurry up, Dr. Watson,
your wife needs you.

446
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,946
Coming, Mrs. Watson.

447
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,951
Ooh. First class, champagne.

448
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,662
You do know how to spoil a girl,
Mr. Watson.

449
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,289
You're not just any girl.

450
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,002
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the
lavatory while the train's in the station.

451
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,342
You're Mrs. Watson.

452
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,637
Give me that bottle.

453
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,196
John, there is nowhere else in the world
I would rather be.

454
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,032
There's no one I'd rather be with.

455
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,701
Why do you have a gun stuffed down
the back of your trousers?

456
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,913
Heh. Old habits.

457
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,419
Ahem. Come in.

458
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,923
- Oh, yes, please.
- We didn't order that.

459
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,341
With our compliments, sir.

460
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,302
Thank you. Put it there.

461
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,110
Open the door, John.

462
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,699
I think it's time for you to leave.

463
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,790
Sit down.

464
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,629
Shh.

465
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,860
I agree it's not my best disguise,
but I had to make do.

466
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,363
- My God.
- They'll be back.

467
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,949
- John, shut the door.
- They'll only shoot through it.

468
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,577
He's right, you know.
- Oh, my God.

469
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,872
- I understand.
- Do you?

470
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,374
Terribly inconvenient.

471
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,752
We don't have much time.

472
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,219
- How many are we expecting?
- Half a dozen.

473
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,763
Who are they?
- A wedding present from Moriarty.

474
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,849
Lovely ceremony, by the way.
Many a tear shed in joy.

475
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,059
Oh, John?

476
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,603
Yeah, just a minute, darling.

477
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,105
- Do you trust me?
- No.

478
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,943
Well, then I shall have
to do something about that.

479
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,868
Who's up to bat next, you bastards?

480
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,913
Send out the fast bowler!

481
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,581
John, do shut the door.

482
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,797
It had to be done.

483
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,800
She's safe now.

484
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,471
In my own defense, I timed it perfectly.

485
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,933
Did you kill my wife?!

486
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,228
Did you just kill my new wife?!

487
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,438
Of course not!

488
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:14,652
What do you mean? How do you know that
when you just threw her off a train?

489
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,988
I told you, I timed it perfectly.

490
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,406
What does that mean?!

491
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,287
- Calm down.
- Explain!

492
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,622
By the time I've explained,
we'd both be dead!

493
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:42,471
I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the
lavatory while the train's in the station.

494
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,234
That was no accident.

495
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,155
It was by design.

496
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:48,245
Now, do you need me to elaborate...

497
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,124
...or can we just crack on?

498
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,466
Come on!

499
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,888
Don't worry, old boy,
she's as safe as houses.

500
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,140
She's with my brother.

501
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,268
I'm on my honeymoon!

502
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,605
Why did you lead them here?!
Why did you involve us?!

503
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,899
They aren't here for me!
They're here for you!

504
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,865
Fortunately...

505
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,332
...so am I.

506
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,875
Now mind the door.

507
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,045
Good evening.

508
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,551
I think you'll find that second class
is more comfortable.

509
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,678
The coast is clear.

510
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:47,304
To the south, quick march.

511
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,314
Lie down with me, Watson.

512
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,317
- Why?
- I insist.

513
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,993
What are we doing down here?

514
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:12,329
We are waiting. I am smoking.

515
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,561
- Patiently waiting.
- For what?

516
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,523
Your window of opportunity.

517
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,656
Make it count.

518
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,210
I said make it count.
How many windows must I provide?

519
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,692
Who'd have known that honeymooning
in Brighton was such a dangerous notion?

520
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,569
Is that what this is about?

521
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,155
By your own admission,
you've never enjoyed it there.

522
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,907
I've never been to Brighton.

523
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,910
Or you're just too fragile
to remember at present.

524
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,912
Oh, shut up.

525
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,247
Tell me my wife's safe.

526
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,165
I can't do both.

527
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,752
I promise. As I said, I timed it perfectly.

528
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,428
Over here, madam!

529
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:56,100
I believe congratulations are in order,
Mrs. Watson.

530
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,689
I'm the other Holmes.

531
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,066
You mean there's two of you?

532
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,944
How marvelous.
Could this evening get any better?

533
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,363
Why were Mary and I targeted at all?

534
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,866
Excellent question.
The answer is twofold.

535
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,952
He's after us because of you.

536
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,913
I'm afraid you must bear
half the responsibility.

537
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,457
- Here it comes. So predictable.
- Had you and Mary...

538
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,627
...not been hell-bent on wedding,
we could've solved this case.

539
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,297
- Oh, it's my fault now.
- The argument could be made...

540
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,174
- No, it couldn't.
- ...that your nuptials were poorly timed.

541
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,053
Thus, our relationship...

542
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,431
Relationship?

543
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,725
Very well, partnership.

544
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,978
...has not yet run its course.

545
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:45,149
My dear fellow, if you could be bothered
to see this through to the end...

546
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,944
...I shall never again ask you
to assist me.

547
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,493
Once more unto the breach.

548
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,996
That's the spirit. Now, to the question.

549
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,166
This is so deliciously complicated.
You may be asking yourself...

550
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:06,337
...what does a criminal mastermind want
with a simple gypsy fortune teller?

551
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,798
It's her brother, I tell you.
When we find him, and we must...

552
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,508
After you find my luggage.

553
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:14,678
Go on.

554
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,513
Wait.

555
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,432
Where is it we're going?

556
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,519
Paris, the most sensible
honeymoon destination of all.

557
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,046
- So why Paris?
- Peaches.

558
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,839
Outside the city at Montreuil...

559
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:55,844
...there's a Gypsy camp famous
for its dried fruit, especially peaches.

560
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:01,183
And there we shall find
our fortune teller...

561
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,560
...and return her bag.

562
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,972
And my ticket?

563
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,905
Unfortunately,
you won't be needing yours.

564
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:43,494
That's a shame, professor.
I was looking forward to Don Giovanni.

565
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,880
Follow Meinhard.

566
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,504
Wake up, we're here.

567
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,881
Brace yourself.
We're about to be violated.

568
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,050
Don't be so cynical.

569
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,604
- They're taking my luggage.
- Laugh them away, Watson. I have her bag.

570
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:58,151
You had her bag.

571
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,237
Now they have my coat.

572
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,740
Where is Madam Simza?

573
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,911
This is Simza.

574
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,919
Sim is a goose.

575
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,922
I am Sim. Ha-ha-ha.

576
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,221
Nice scarf. I like.

577
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,788
- You hungry?
- Famished.

578
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,338
Madam, this is a glorious
hedgehog goulash.

579
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:03,091
I can't remember ever having had better.

580
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:10,307
Do tell me, when was the last time
you had a hedgehog goulash?

581
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,060
I told you, Watson, I can't remember.

582
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,978
Perhaps you've repressed it.

583
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,775
That's where we differ.
Unlike you, I repress nothing.

584
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,485
Perfectly normal.

585
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:26,531
How dare you be rude to this woman
who has invited us into her tent...

586
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,283
...offered us her hedgehog?

587
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,162
Says the man who throws women
from trains.

588
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,248
Who are you two?

589
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,125
Concerned citizens.

590
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,003
Why did someone try to kill me?

591
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:44,591
Your brother has become involved
with a very dangerous man...

592
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,428
...who clearly believes that Rene has
told you something you shouldn't know.

593
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:51,682
I don't know anything.

594
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,644
I've been looking for him for over a year.

595
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,938
That was why I was in London.

596
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:01,692
- It's the last place anyone saw him.
- It's clear that your brother loves you.

597
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,820
He'd never send you a message
that would put you in harm's way.

598
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:08,699
Any information, therefore,
would be, by default, unintentional.

599
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,951
Has he sent you anything else?

600
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,370
Just a few drawings.

601
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,998
Let's just see what they have to tell us.

602
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:27,175
Unusual choice of paper. Thicker gauge,
designed for a printing press.

603
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,387
- And it's the same stock as the letter.
- Mm.

604
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,472
They smell musty.

605
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,226
Must have been stored
somewhere cold and damp.

606
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,895
What's that? Blood?

607
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:45,068
Wine. So a wine cellar located
near a printing press.

608
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,695
That should narrow it down.

609
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:55,203
There's a wine cellar used
by the anarchist group Lapin Vert.

610
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,748
Rene was close to their leader.

611
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,332
Claude Ravache.

612
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:03,003
- A bomb maker.
- I sampled some of his work last week.

613
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,258
I was a part of the movement.
So was Rene.

614
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,927
Until it became too extreme for us.

615
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,306
Ravache knows me.

616
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:19,019
If my brother's back there, he will see us.

617
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:20,270
We will send a message.

618
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,366
Whatever you do,
don't let these gypsies make you drink.

619
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,576
Of course.

620
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,453
You dance?

621
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:40,290
For God's sake, don't dance.
It'll be the death of you.

622
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,255
You know what happens
when you dance.

623
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,020
Huuh...

624
00:58:14,098 --> 00:58:16,058
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Watson.

625
00:58:16,684 --> 00:58:18,227
- Have you had breakfast?
- I...

626
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,229
Stanley here does a wonderful
deviled kidney.

627
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:22,648
Ahem.

628
00:58:22,815 --> 00:58:24,567
- Carruthers?
- Morning, sir.

629
00:58:24,692 --> 00:58:27,153
Telegram for Mrs. Watson.

630
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:34,785
Uh...

631
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:36,662
It just doesn't make any sense.

632
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:38,164
Allow me.

633
00:58:39,915 --> 00:58:41,000
Oh, yes.

634
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:45,546
"My most loathed Mary, I do not love you.
I never wish to see you again.

635
00:58:45,713 --> 00:58:49,800
Every moment I count away from you
is a blessing."

636
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:52,595
Fret not.
It's a double encryption, my dear...

637
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,931
...that Sherly and I
have used since we were boys.

638
00:58:56,057 --> 00:58:59,060
If the first letter of the message
is a consonant...

639
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:02,271
...then what follows is the mirrored truth.

640
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:03,689
- I see.
- Hmm.

641
00:59:05,524 --> 00:59:07,193
Stanley!

642
00:59:08,069 --> 00:59:11,322
You know, although our time together
has been but a brief interlude...

643
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:15,743
...I'm beginning to understand
how a man of particular disposition...

644
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:20,831
...under certain circumstances,
extreme ones perhaps...

645
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:25,211
...might grow to enjoy the company of...

646
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:31,384
- ...a person of your gender. Hmm.
- Hmm.

647
00:59:31,509 --> 00:59:33,386
Thank you so much.

648
00:59:33,511 --> 00:59:35,721
Most charming.

649
00:59:36,263 --> 00:59:39,475
May...? Terribly sorry. Thank you.

650
00:59:41,143 --> 00:59:43,187
Where are you going, Stanley?

651
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:01,747
Whoa, whoa.

652
01:00:52,298 --> 01:00:54,258
Still hiding in basements?

653
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:06,479
I'm not here to see you.

654
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:10,691
Yeah.

655
01:01:14,612 --> 01:01:16,113
...with your English friends.

656
01:01:18,866 --> 01:01:22,286
1189, a seminal vintage.

657
01:01:22,453 --> 01:01:24,497
The year of our glorious revolution.

658
01:01:24,663 --> 01:01:27,166
- Is he here?
- When freedom triumphed over tyranny.

659
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,375
Is my brother here?

660
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:31,962
I haven't seen him for a long time.

661
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:33,172
You're lying.

662
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:36,342
Sit, please.

663
01:01:39,303 --> 01:01:42,431
A letter was received from Rene
using this same paper.

664
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,808
Of course.
He took it with him wherever he went.

665
01:01:46,101 --> 01:01:48,062
He's telling the truth. Rene isn't here.

666
01:01:48,229 --> 01:01:51,524
- He was given another assignment by an...
- An anonymous benefactor.

667
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:56,028
Another Englishman...

668
01:01:56,612 --> 01:02:00,407
...with money, power,
who supported our cause.

669
01:02:01,116 --> 01:02:02,618
And now...

670
01:02:03,202 --> 01:02:06,038
...he dictates our every move...

671
01:02:11,544 --> 01:02:16,173
...demanding I take responsibility
for his acts of terror.

672
01:02:16,882 --> 01:02:18,676
I made a deal with the devil.

673
01:02:18,842 --> 01:02:20,678
But after tonight, ahem...

674
01:02:21,887 --> 01:02:23,180
...it will be over.

675
01:02:24,932 --> 01:02:26,892
My job is almost done.

676
01:02:29,103 --> 01:02:32,398
He's had you plant another bomb,
hasn't he?

677
01:02:32,565 --> 01:02:34,191
Claude, please.

678
01:02:34,483 --> 01:02:35,985
These men can help you.

679
01:02:36,777 --> 01:02:38,737
I wish they could.

680
01:02:39,446 --> 01:02:41,365
You see, gentlemen...

681
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:44,243
...he has my wife and children.

682
01:02:45,703 --> 01:02:47,329
If you tell us where the bomb is...

683
01:02:47,454 --> 01:02:50,749
- ...I'll find a way to help your family.
- That's already taken care of.

684
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,168
We have a deal.

685
01:02:55,879 --> 01:02:57,923
He and I.

686
01:02:59,383 --> 01:03:01,093
No loose ends.

687
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:04,930
There's only one thing I can do
to keep my family safe.

688
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:08,350
- You have less than 10 minutes.
- Don't!

689
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:24,617
He has no further need of that pistol.
Why don't you take it and cover the stairs?

690
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:59,568
There's only one way out of this place.

691
01:04:01,153 --> 01:04:02,279
Right you are.

692
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,078
Ah. Ingenious.

693
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:11,330
That's the one. Quickly as we can.

694
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:17,086
You know what to do with that sandbag,
Watson.

695
01:04:17,878 --> 01:04:19,588
Quick now.

696
01:04:26,845 --> 01:04:28,847
Doctor, could you secure that lever?

697
01:04:30,224 --> 01:04:31,517
You could have told me.

698
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:36,063
Ravache was strong. He lived for liberty.
He would never take his own life.

699
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,356
Calm yourself.

700
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:45,489
My brother, he's weak.

701
01:04:46,073 --> 01:04:49,243
Sim, I need you to take a deep breath...

702
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:50,619
...and follow us.

703
01:04:53,205 --> 01:04:54,998
To the opera.

704
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:31,321
I was mistaken.

705
01:07:31,488 --> 01:07:34,616
- What?
- I made a mistake.

706
01:09:24,768 --> 01:09:26,395
He took the shot from here.

707
01:09:28,146 --> 01:09:30,983
Using a tripod and a shooting stick.

708
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:34,069
And realized there was a better position.

709
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:39,658
There's a faint scrape where
he dragged his tripod and set it up here.

710
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:42,786
- Six hundred yards?
- Or 650?

711
01:09:42,953 --> 01:09:45,414
Not to mention a seven-
or eight-mile-an-hour wind.

712
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:48,083
He would've needed a wind gauge.

713
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,460
Which he placed here.

714
01:09:53,171 --> 01:09:55,007
And put a cigarette down here.

715
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,844
Can anyone shoot that far?

716
01:09:59,011 --> 01:10:01,680
Not more than half a dozen men
in all of Europe.

717
01:10:02,806 --> 01:10:04,850
How many of those men served
in Afghanistan?

718
01:10:05,017 --> 01:10:07,561
Why?
- Hirschsprung with a touch of Tekel.

719
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:10,022
<i>Must have fallen out
when he was rolling up.</i>

720
01:10:10,188 --> 01:10:12,024
Wasn't that the blend you all smoked?

721
01:10:14,234 --> 01:10:17,195
- Didn't I read something about a colonel?
- Sebastian Moran.

722
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:20,532
<i>Best marksman in the British army.</i>

723
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:22,701
Dishonorable discharge.

724
01:10:22,868 --> 01:10:27,539
He's likely now a gun for hire. This is the
second victim of his that I've encountered.

725
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:29,416
What better way to conceal a killing?

726
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:31,877
No one looks for a bullet hole
in a bomb blast.

727
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,893
- He's 20 minutes late.
- He must come soon.

728
01:10:48,894 --> 01:10:50,145
I don't have any papers.

729
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:52,481
And I am a foreigner.

730
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:54,900
This climate is exactly what
Moriarty wants.

731
01:10:55,066 --> 01:10:58,862
Ahem.
The omelet fines herbes was divine...

732
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:01,573
...but they spared every expense
on the tea.

733
01:11:02,407 --> 01:11:06,661
Now shall we compare moods,
or consider what we know?

734
01:11:07,788 --> 01:11:09,664
<i>Last night's bombing was
clearly meant...</i>

735
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:12,751
<i>...to look like Germany's retaliation
for Strasbourg.</i>

736
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:16,588
<i>However, the bomb was also meant
to conceal the murder of just one man.</i>

737
01:11:17,214 --> 01:11:21,259
The man killed by the gunshot
was none other than Alfred Meinhard.

738
01:11:21,718 --> 01:11:22,761
Ah.

739
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:27,349
He makes guns. Big guns.

740
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:31,853
Only days ago, a large share of his company
was bought by an unknown investor.

741
01:11:31,978 --> 01:11:33,188
Moriarty.

742
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:37,901
The clues point in one direction, but to
avoid repeating last night's debacle...

743
01:11:38,068 --> 01:11:41,947
...I was obliged to collect
more sufficient data, hence my tardiness.

744
01:11:48,912 --> 01:11:52,123
Train departs in 40 minutes, sir.

745
01:12:07,264 --> 01:12:08,515
Whoa!

746
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:20,151
- Just the bags.
- But...

747
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:23,280
We have enough time for me
to indulge my little habit.

748
01:12:23,446 --> 01:12:24,489
Yes.

749
01:12:24,656 --> 01:12:29,828
<i>His habit of feeding that
urban species, the feral pigeon.</i>

750
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:35,000
So there are seven mainline
railway stations in Paris.

751
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:38,044
But taking 10 minutes to get
to the Jardin des Tuileries...

752
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:41,840
...where the largest concentration
of the winged vermin may be found...

753
01:12:42,007 --> 01:12:45,093
...reduces there to one,
the Gare du Nord...

754
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:50,432
...where he will be just in time
to catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.

755
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,143
It makes several stops along the way,
one of which is...

756
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:55,020
Heilbronn.

757
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,273
Exactly where we must go.

758
01:12:58,732 --> 01:13:00,233
Where Meinhard's factory is.

759
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,360
It's Moriarty's factory now.

760
01:13:03,069 --> 01:13:04,738
Unfortunately, due to the bombing...

761
01:13:04,905 --> 01:13:07,657
...the crossing between
France and Germany is to be closed.

762
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:12,621
I'm afraid our pursuit is over
unless we can happen upon a comrade...

763
01:13:12,787 --> 01:13:16,541
...who knows their way around borders.

764
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:19,210
Too English.

765
01:13:21,504 --> 01:13:23,882
However, you do make a fantastic gypsy.

766
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:26,092
Certainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.

767
01:13:26,259 --> 01:13:29,054
Now, now, no need to be demeaning.

768
01:13:29,262 --> 01:13:31,389
It is a nice scarf.

769
01:13:31,556 --> 01:13:34,225
No, no, too English. It'll suit you more.

770
01:13:35,602 --> 01:13:38,396
Black one is yours. Gray one is mine.

771
01:13:38,563 --> 01:13:41,566
- And this is for you.
- Um... Hmm.

772
01:13:41,733 --> 01:13:42,901
Right.

773
01:13:43,902 --> 01:13:46,363
- Where are the wagons?
- The wagon is too slow.

774
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:47,948
Can't you ride?

775
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:52,744
It's not that he can't ride.

776
01:13:52,911 --> 01:13:54,245
How is it you put it, Holmes?

777
01:13:54,412 --> 01:13:58,083
They're dangerous at both ends
and crafty in the middle.

778
01:13:58,249 --> 01:14:02,587
Why would I want anything with a mind
of its own bobbing about between my legs?

779
01:14:02,754 --> 01:14:05,256
Then I shall require a bicycle,
thank you very much.

780
01:14:05,423 --> 01:14:08,593
It's 1891. Could've chartered a balloon.

781
01:14:11,221 --> 01:14:13,390
How can we make this
more manageable?

782
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:27,779
Where's the fire?

783
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,624
It's not as if Germany
is going somewhere.

784
01:14:48,883 --> 01:14:50,093
We know another way.

785
01:14:56,141 --> 01:14:58,977
Slow and steady wins the race.

786
01:15:16,286 --> 01:15:17,954
Come on!

787
01:15:33,344 --> 01:15:37,515
We slip in through the loading
bay, find out what he's doing...

788
01:15:37,682 --> 01:15:39,517
...and we get out.

789
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:41,352
Getting out might be tricky.

790
01:15:41,519 --> 01:15:42,937
We will get you out.

791
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:46,149
If my brother's in there,
get him out alive.

792
01:16:02,707 --> 01:16:04,000
Are you happy?

793
01:16:05,502 --> 01:16:07,337
- What?
- At this moment...

794
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:11,466
...are you as happy as you would be
on your honeymoon in Brighton?

795
01:16:11,966 --> 01:16:14,761
I'm not going to grace that question
with an answer.

796
01:16:17,305 --> 01:16:19,849
- Are you happy?
- I think we're here for another reason.

797
01:16:20,016 --> 01:16:21,226
- Okay.
- Shall we get on...?

798
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:23,228
- Simple question.
- Will we do something?

799
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:25,939
- Or wait for them to come back round?
- What time is it?

800
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:28,316
- Three-fifteen.
- Over there...

801
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:31,820
...in the residential part of the complex
should be a telegraph office.

802
01:16:31,986 --> 01:16:35,365
Send this to Mycroft.
Be back here on the hour.

803
01:19:25,535 --> 01:19:29,998
That's what you get, Mr. Holmes,
when industry marries arms.

804
01:19:30,164 --> 01:19:32,375
Now put your gun down.

805
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:35,670
It's a bit old-fashioned.

806
01:19:40,508 --> 01:19:42,343
What you need is one of these.

807
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,430
Go on.

808
01:19:47,724 --> 01:19:48,766
Pick one.

809
01:19:51,602 --> 01:19:54,605
Machine pistol, self-repeating.

810
01:19:56,274 --> 01:19:59,777
Takes 1.63 caliber rounds...

811
01:20:00,403 --> 01:20:02,447
...in one of these.

812
01:20:05,241 --> 01:20:07,535
A 10-shot box magazine.

813
01:20:09,579 --> 01:20:12,123
- Easy enough to load.
- Hmm.

814
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:15,710
I'd imagine one would have to
retract the bolt to engage the first round.

815
01:20:17,253 --> 01:20:18,629
Easier done than said.

816
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:29,599
Take him to the surgery.

817
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:33,311
I'll find the doctor.

818
01:20:44,405 --> 01:20:46,657
"Come at once if convenient.

819
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:52,121
If inconvenient, come all the same."

820
01:21:03,966 --> 01:21:05,009
This is schnapps.

821
01:21:06,302 --> 01:21:09,389
A telegram was sent from here.

822
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:14,602
This isn't schnapps, it's aquavit,
distilled from potato mash.

823
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:17,271
A common misconception.
Thank you, by the way.

824
01:21:18,064 --> 01:21:20,024
Who was it sent to?

825
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:22,193
My horror at your crimes
is matched only...

826
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,279
...by my admiration at the skill
it took to achieve them.

827
01:21:27,031 --> 01:21:28,533
Who was it sent to?

828
01:21:29,742 --> 01:21:33,329
<i>You used the anarchists and
their bombs to create a crisis in Europe...</i>

829
01:21:33,496 --> 01:21:35,123
<i>...nation against nation</i>

830
01:21:35,289 --> 01:21:38,876
Under various pseudonyms, you bought,
schemed, or murdered your way...

831
01:21:39,043 --> 01:21:42,630
...into numerous industries, assuring
that none of it could be traced to you.

832
01:21:43,047 --> 01:21:47,051
<i>Cotton, opium, steel,
now arms and chemical weaponry.</i>

833
01:21:47,218 --> 01:21:50,471
<i>All to be shipped across Europe
in less than a week.</i>

834
01:21:50,638 --> 01:21:52,849
<i>Everything from bullets to bandages.</i>

835
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:57,562
Now that you own the supply,
you intend to create the demand.

836
01:21:59,647 --> 01:22:00,982
A world war.

837
01:22:05,403 --> 01:22:07,238
<i>You are familiar with Schubert's work.</i>

838
01:22:11,909 --> 01:22:15,913
The Trout is perhaps my favorite.

839
01:22:17,915 --> 01:22:22,753
A fisherman grows weary of trying
to catch an elusive fish.

840
01:22:23,921 --> 01:22:26,090
Out the way, out the way.

841
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:28,593
So he muddies the water.

842
01:22:29,218 --> 01:22:30,720
I'm warning you.

843
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,680
Confuses the fish.

844
01:22:38,561 --> 01:22:39,770
You were warned.

845
01:22:39,937 --> 01:22:43,774
It doesn't realize until too late
that it has swum into a trap.

846
01:24:28,796 --> 01:24:30,840
Let's try this again, shall we?

847
01:24:31,257 --> 01:24:34,969
To whom did you send the telegram?

848
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,471
To my...

849
01:24:50,401 --> 01:24:52,403
To my brother Mycroft.

850
01:24:55,656 --> 01:24:57,241
What are you playing at?

851
01:25:01,495 --> 01:25:03,581
That's not fair.

852
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:07,501
I've just got one more question for you.

853
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:15,718
Which one of us is the fisherman...

854
01:25:16,552 --> 01:25:18,387
...and which the trout?

855
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:50,252
Holmes?

856
01:25:52,463 --> 01:25:53,631
- Holmes?
- Unh.

857
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:57,134
Take your time. Take your time.

858
01:26:02,306 --> 01:26:03,557
Uh...

859
01:26:10,106 --> 01:26:11,774
Always good to see you, Watson.

860
01:26:27,331 --> 01:26:28,916
- What were you thinking?
- Wait.

861
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,292
Wait?

862
01:26:31,836 --> 01:26:36,382
Well, if you must know, I was thinking
I had him right where I wanted him.

863
01:26:40,344 --> 01:26:42,972
Right. Crack on, then.

864
01:26:49,145 --> 01:26:50,438
Professor.

865
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:53,357
I'm all right, I'm all right.

866
01:26:53,524 --> 01:26:56,193
Don't waste time attending to me.

867
01:27:00,698 --> 01:27:03,159
I'll find them. I'll find them.

868
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,668
Turn in three, two, one.

869
01:27:21,385 --> 01:27:22,428
Come on, hurry up!

870
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,975
Go!

871
01:27:37,276 --> 01:27:40,237
- Did you see my brother?
- No, but I'm certain he's been here.

872
01:27:40,404 --> 01:27:42,198
Where are we going?
- Over that wall.

873
01:27:42,364 --> 01:27:44,784
- How did you know I'd find you?
- You didn't find me.

874
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:46,744
You collapsed a building on me.

875
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:41,507
Where are the horses?
- They're behind.

876
01:28:41,674 --> 01:28:44,093
- We need them.
- You wanna go back?

877
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:45,469
What's our way out?

878
01:28:45,636 --> 01:28:46,971
That's our way out.

879
01:32:07,671 --> 01:32:09,673
Go! Go!

880
01:32:11,508 --> 01:32:12,801
Come on!

881
01:32:28,567 --> 01:32:30,986
Marko! Marko!

882
01:33:22,746 --> 01:33:23,872
He's not breathing.

883
01:33:32,631 --> 01:33:33,674
Cradle his head.

884
01:33:34,216 --> 01:33:35,926
Raise his legs.

885
01:33:37,761 --> 01:33:40,430
Bloody well not gonna die on me.

886
01:33:45,102 --> 01:33:47,229
I'm not gonna make this easy on you.

887
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:51,358
Come on. Come on.

888
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:53,193
Come on.

889
01:33:58,198 --> 01:33:59,283
Come on.

890
01:33:59,449 --> 01:34:01,618
I know you can hear me,
you selfish bastard.

891
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,745
Come on!

892
01:34:03,912 --> 01:34:06,206
I know you can hear me, you bastard.

893
01:34:26,518 --> 01:34:27,686
His wedding gift.

894
01:34:48,999 --> 01:34:50,959
Terrible dream.

895
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:53,337
You, Mary, Gladstone
and I were in a restaurant.

896
01:34:53,503 --> 01:34:56,548
That satanic pony was there as well,
a massive fork in his hoof...

897
01:34:56,715 --> 01:34:58,675
...and he turned on me!

898
01:34:58,842 --> 01:35:00,761
What have you administered?

899
01:35:01,678 --> 01:35:02,721
Your wedding present.

900
01:35:02,888 --> 01:35:05,140
Who's been dancing on my chest?!

901
01:35:05,307 --> 01:35:06,600
ME.

902
01:35:07,434 --> 01:35:09,061
Why is my ankle so itchy?

903
01:35:09,227 --> 01:35:11,647
You have a large piece of wood
sticking out of it.

904
01:35:11,813 --> 01:35:13,857
Good Lord. You, Tamas.

905
01:35:14,024 --> 01:35:17,194
I have an important job to discuss
with you. Remind me of it later.

906
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:20,155
Sit down. Drink this.

907
01:35:20,322 --> 01:35:22,866
I need to get that out before
it turns septic.

908
01:35:26,286 --> 01:35:29,623
- Did you call me "selfish bastard"?
- Probably.

909
01:35:30,374 --> 01:35:32,376
Just leave it in. Leave it...!

910
01:35:36,213 --> 01:35:37,339
You are a...

911
01:35:37,506 --> 01:35:40,384
- Oh, you are some sort of...
- Be nice.

912
01:35:48,892 --> 01:35:50,978
I'm sorry you didn't get to Brighton.

913
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:56,233
Me too.

914
01:36:03,073 --> 01:36:05,075
- I think we should go home.
- I concur.

915
01:36:06,535 --> 01:36:07,828
We're going home.

916
01:36:14,042 --> 01:36:16,003
Via Switzerland.

917
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:22,384
What better place to start a war
than a peace summit?

918
01:36:23,301 --> 01:36:28,765
We'll drop in and see my brother.
I'm sure he's missed you. Hm?

919
01:36:45,365 --> 01:36:47,743
I don't understand why you don't
cancel the summit.

920
01:36:47,909 --> 01:36:50,287
Fact is it's gonna happen
whether we like it or not.

921
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:52,581
Everyone has already arrived.

922
01:36:52,748 --> 01:36:54,958
Although these gentlemen
may be talking peace...

923
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:57,544
...believe me, they're readying
their armies at home.

924
01:36:57,711 --> 01:37:00,130
To cancel the summit now
would be tantamount to war.

925
01:37:00,297 --> 01:37:03,633
- The telegram, wasn't it clear?
- We have doubled the security, sir.

926
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,969
Oh, doubled security. That's comforting.

927
01:37:06,136 --> 01:37:09,056
You don't understand the delicacy
of the situation.

928
01:37:09,222 --> 01:37:11,099
I passed the telegram on
to my superiors.

929
01:37:11,266 --> 01:37:14,978
But they brought Moriarty in to advise
on the peace process in the first place.

930
01:37:15,145 --> 01:37:17,272
He has positioned himself brilliantly.

931
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:20,150
He's one of our foremost intellectuals,
a personal friend...

932
01:37:20,317 --> 01:37:22,486
Of the prime minister.
Yes, we all know that.

933
01:37:22,652 --> 01:37:25,489
I believe you,
but where's your evidence?

934
01:37:26,698 --> 01:37:29,493
He's too good to leave evidence.

935
01:37:29,659 --> 01:37:30,994
He doesn't leave loose ends.

936
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:34,081
Oh, he's alive.

937
01:37:34,247 --> 01:37:35,332
Sherly, put that down.

938
01:37:35,999 --> 01:37:39,461
What is this contraption? May I have it?
The effect is most invigorating.

939
01:37:39,628 --> 01:37:43,673
That's my private and personal supply
of oxygen, and you're not to touch it.

940
01:37:45,342 --> 01:37:47,010
This argument is getting us nowhere.

941
01:37:47,177 --> 01:37:51,139
I've arranged for documents to be prepared
which allow you into the ball. Carruthers.

942
01:37:51,306 --> 01:37:54,309
Stanley, Stanley.

943
01:37:54,476 --> 01:37:58,855
You haven't aged a day.
Is that my favorite chutney?

944
01:37:59,022 --> 01:38:02,025
Fact is, we don't really know
what he's planning.

945
01:38:02,984 --> 01:38:05,362
- It won't be another bomb.
- No, it wouldn't be.

946
01:38:05,529 --> 01:38:07,030
It doesn't make sense.

947
01:38:07,197 --> 01:38:09,825
Why would he attack all the nations
only to unite them?

948
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:11,368
It'll be an assassination.

949
01:38:12,702 --> 01:38:14,871
By alone gunman at close range.

950
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:17,833
Rene.

951
01:38:18,542 --> 01:38:19,960
Unfortunately, yes.

952
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:23,547
- You knew.
- I had my suspicions.

953
01:38:23,713 --> 01:38:26,758
But having seen who would be attending,
I'm now certain.

954
01:38:26,925 --> 01:38:29,553
Well, at least we know
who to look out for.

955
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,429
Rene will be the evidence.

956
01:38:31,596 --> 01:38:35,308
If we can find him and stop him,
we will perhaps not only save his life...

957
01:38:35,475 --> 01:38:38,603
...but prevent the collapse of
Western civilization.

958
01:38:39,396 --> 01:38:40,814
No pressure.

959
01:39:13,471 --> 01:39:15,473
Welcome, ambassador.

960
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:19,603
Professor James Moriarty.

961
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:36,453
Now we're all present...

962
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:40,415
...I can tell you that the targets are the
German chancellor and his ambassador...

963
01:39:40,582 --> 01:39:42,667
...the French prime minister and his man.

964
01:39:42,834 --> 01:39:47,214
And the other nations are really working out
which side to take should hostilities erupt.

965
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:50,634
Prince Michael, a cousin of the czar,
and the Russian ambassador.

966
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,595
The Archduke Karl Ludwig
and the Austro-Hungarian ambassador.

967
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:57,057
The Romanian Prime Minister
and his ambassador.

968
01:39:57,224 --> 01:40:00,644
And of course our prime minister
and the British ambassador.

969
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:04,648
He'll choose a moment when the dignitaries
are assembled, preferably standing still.

970
01:40:04,814 --> 01:40:06,608
Is there to be an official photograph?

971
01:40:06,775 --> 01:40:10,654
Indeed, yes. In 38 minutes.

972
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:13,782
In which case, we might as well dance.

973
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,830
I've never done this before.

974
01:40:20,997 --> 01:40:25,835
Just follow my lead.

975
01:40:39,182 --> 01:40:41,268
- What do you see?
- Everything.

976
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:54,614
That is my curse.

977
01:40:56,032 --> 01:40:58,994
But you don't see
what you're looking for.

978
01:41:16,344 --> 01:41:18,179
I thought you'd never ask.

979
01:41:20,932 --> 01:41:22,767
Over my shoulder.

980
01:41:22,934 --> 01:41:26,646
Young man, German uniform,
ceremonial sword.

981
01:41:27,022 --> 01:41:28,356
Got him.

982
01:41:29,065 --> 01:41:31,067
Professional opinion?

983
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:33,737
Trauma.

984
01:41:33,903 --> 01:41:36,239
Major injury.

985
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:38,908
But excellent repair work.

986
01:41:40,577 --> 01:41:42,037
Dr. Hoffmanstahl.

987
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:45,540
<i>You did say he was at
the forefront of a medical innovation.</i>

988
01:41:45,707 --> 01:41:48,251
<i>We've already seen an example
of his skills.</i>

989
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:52,672
Those twins weren't twins.

990
01:41:52,839 --> 01:41:55,258
My suspicions were aroused
in Heilbronn...

991
01:41:56,176 --> 01:41:58,762
<i>...when one failed to go to the aid
of the other.</i>

992
01:41:58,928 --> 01:42:03,183
I also noticed the discreet but
unmistakable puckering behind the ear...

993
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:06,436
...where his skin had been drawn back.
I should've realized then...

994
01:42:06,603 --> 01:42:09,481
...that they were a surgical experiment.

995
01:42:09,814 --> 01:42:12,942
To see if it is possible
to make one man look like another.

996
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,445
<i>His face is no longer his own.</i>

997
01:42:15,612 --> 01:42:19,616
What better way to guarantee his world war
than to make the assassin...

998
01:42:21,951 --> 01:42:23,119
One of the ambassadors.

999
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:29,334
That narrows down the possibility
to one of six.

1000
01:42:30,001 --> 01:42:33,004
You and Sim shall find her brother.

1001
01:42:33,171 --> 01:42:35,340
- Of this I have no doubt.
- Holmes.

1002
01:42:35,507 --> 01:42:37,592
You know my methods.

1003
01:42:39,302 --> 01:42:41,304
And I know where you'll be.

1004
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:45,809
No possible solution could
be more congenial to me than this.

1005
01:42:45,975 --> 01:42:49,354
By the way,
who taught you how to dance?

1006
01:42:50,146 --> 01:42:51,481
You did.

1007
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,901
Well, I've done a fine job.

1008
01:42:56,236 --> 01:42:57,987
Be careful.

1009
01:43:36,025 --> 01:43:37,110
Shall we go to work?

1010
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:43,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, gather for the portrait.

1011
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:54,127
I'm sorry.

1012
01:43:54,294 --> 01:43:56,546
Is this a bad time?

1013
01:43:57,172 --> 01:43:58,882
Never better.

1014
01:43:59,632 --> 01:44:03,136
- Would you bring that clock?
- Heh.

1015
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:11,686
We get to play that game after all.

1016
01:44:24,824 --> 01:44:26,618
Here we are.

1017
01:44:32,248 --> 01:44:34,501
Don't want you to catch a cold.

1018
01:44:39,255 --> 01:44:40,757
A five-minute game?

1019
01:44:41,758 --> 01:44:43,760
If you think you can manage it.

1020
01:45:04,781 --> 01:45:06,407
We both have two bishops.

1021
01:45:06,574 --> 01:45:09,369
I may be absent from the room,
but my methods are not.

1022
01:45:09,827 --> 01:45:11,704
You can't mean Dr. Watson, surely.

1023
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:15,124
That doesn't seem fair.

1024
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:24,717
Right. The surgery will have left scars.

1025
01:45:25,218 --> 01:45:27,804
Only four of them have the hairline
to hide them.

1026
01:45:32,141 --> 01:45:35,478
The ambassador that you replaced
with Rene, is he still alive?

1027
01:45:39,148 --> 01:45:41,401
Would you like me to recommend
your next move?

1028
01:45:41,568 --> 01:45:45,280
They're all my brother's height,
right build...

1029
01:45:45,446 --> 01:45:47,240
...but their eyes.

1030
01:45:47,407 --> 01:45:50,076
Their eyes are wrong.
Rene has blue eyes.

1031
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:55,331
He could be wearing glass lenses
to change the color.

1032
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:59,377
In which case, his eyes will be hurting.

1033
01:46:01,087 --> 01:46:03,506
Rene is left-handed.

1034
01:46:03,673 --> 01:46:05,717
<i>Perhaps the assassin
will take measures...</i>

1035
01:46:05,883 --> 01:46:08,011
<i>...Io ensure he doesn't give himself away.</i>

1036
01:46:08,177 --> 01:46:09,679
Like a gambler concealing a tell.

1037
01:46:15,351 --> 01:46:18,146
I think it might be him.

1038
01:46:19,522 --> 01:46:20,565
You think?

1039
01:46:20,732 --> 01:46:22,358
Your clock is ticking.

1040
01:46:22,525 --> 01:46:23,568
You have to be sure.

1041
01:46:23,735 --> 01:46:26,529
<i>May I remind you, this is blitz chess</i>

1042
01:46:26,696 --> 01:46:29,532
<i>A single miscalculation
will cost you the game.</i>

1043
01:46:31,659 --> 01:46:35,163
If I tackle the wrong man to the ground,
I could start a war.

1044
01:46:36,164 --> 01:46:37,790
<i>Maybe it's less obvious.</i>

1045
01:46:37,957 --> 01:46:41,210
<i>A nervous tic. A ﬂutter of anxiety.</i>

1046
01:46:41,377 --> 01:46:44,213
I expect everyone has a reason
to be nervous tonight.

1047
01:46:49,886 --> 01:46:51,304
I don't know.

1048
01:47:00,647 --> 01:47:02,815
<i>A failure to behave naturally.</i>

1049
01:47:03,983 --> 01:47:06,235
<i>An actor so consumed
with his performance...</i>

1050
01:47:06,402 --> 01:47:09,530
<i>...that the one characteristic
he cannot accommodate...</i>

1051
01:47:09,697 --> 01:47:11,324
...is spontaneous reaction.

1052
01:48:02,625 --> 01:48:04,919
Carruthers, protect the prime minister.

1053
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:16,472
Germany will pay! Mark my words!

1054
01:48:17,348 --> 01:48:18,975
That doesn't bode well, does it?

1055
01:48:21,018 --> 01:48:25,481
Seems your bishop
was of some benefit after all.

1056
01:48:25,982 --> 01:48:27,066
The game is still young.

1057
01:48:27,233 --> 01:48:29,277
Actually, it's in its adolescence.

1058
01:48:34,115 --> 01:48:35,408
There are more of us!

1059
01:48:37,744 --> 01:48:40,496
Germany will pay!

1060
01:48:48,671 --> 01:48:51,132
No loose ends.

1061
01:48:56,345 --> 01:48:59,640
What happened to him?
I'm a doctor. A doctor!

1062
01:49:20,828 --> 01:49:22,747
What happened?

1063
01:49:22,914 --> 01:49:24,540
- Curare.
- What's wrong with him?

1064
01:49:24,707 --> 01:49:25,917
It's poison.

1065
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:27,710
Do something!

1066
01:49:32,381 --> 01:49:33,674
Doctor, do something!

1067
01:49:34,759 --> 01:49:36,052
No.

1068
01:49:51,734 --> 01:49:55,988
I think you've just lost
your most valuable piece.

1069
01:49:56,739 --> 01:50:00,785
But a winning strategy
sometimes necessitates sacrifice.

1070
01:50:00,952 --> 01:50:02,411
A war has been averted.

1071
01:50:02,578 --> 01:50:04,997
Mm. Oh, I disagree.

1072
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:06,582
How so?

1073
01:50:07,458 --> 01:50:10,920
Didn't you find it strange
that the telegram you sent...

1074
01:50:11,087 --> 01:50:13,756
...didn't inspire any action to stop me?

1075
01:50:16,884 --> 01:50:21,222
You see,
hidden within the unconscious...

1076
01:50:21,389 --> 01:50:23,933
...is an insatiable desire for conflict.

1077
01:50:26,561 --> 01:50:32,608
So you're not fighting me
so much as you are the human condition.

1078
01:50:33,776 --> 01:50:38,030
All I want to do is own the bullets
and the bandages.

1079
01:50:39,657 --> 01:50:43,411
War on an industrial scale is inevitable.

1080
01:50:43,578 --> 01:50:46,956
They'll do it themselves
within a few years.

1081
01:50:48,124 --> 01:50:51,961
All I have to do is wait.

1082
01:50:56,632 --> 01:50:59,176
I like Switzerland.

1083
01:50:59,343 --> 01:51:02,305
They respect a man's privacy here.

1084
01:51:02,763 --> 01:51:05,474
Particularly if he has a fortune.

1085
01:51:13,441 --> 01:51:15,067
Bishop takes knight. Check.

1086
01:51:15,693 --> 01:51:17,653
The game is over.

1087
01:51:18,404 --> 01:51:20,573
You should get that shoulder looked at.

1088
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:23,075
About that fortune of yours.

1089
01:51:23,242 --> 01:51:28,372
I believe it's just
been substantially reduced.

1090
01:51:28,998 --> 01:51:30,166
King to rook two.

1091
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:32,168
I attended several of your lectures.

1092
01:51:32,335 --> 01:51:35,129
The equations of motion,
which you will find in my book.

1093
01:51:35,296 --> 01:51:38,299
The energy that is required
to release these explosions is...

1094
01:51:38,466 --> 01:51:42,261
<i>It was in Oslo when I first caught
a glimpse of your little notebook...</i>

1095
01:51:42,428 --> 01:51:44,805
...red leather-bound from
Smythson of Bond Street.

1096
01:51:44,972 --> 01:51:48,476
Rook to king's rook three. Check.

1097
01:51:57,443 --> 01:51:58,694
Bishop to rook three.

1098
01:51:58,861 --> 01:52:01,447
Its importance was not fully
apparent to me...

1099
01:52:01,614 --> 01:52:04,533
<i>...until I observed your penchant
for feeding pigeons.</i>

1100
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:08,663
Then it occurred
that with an empire so enormous...

1101
01:52:08,829 --> 01:52:12,041
...even you must keep a record
of it somewhere.

1102
01:52:12,208 --> 01:52:13,626
Bishop takes bishop.

1103
01:52:14,502 --> 01:52:15,878
Rook to bishop four.

1104
01:52:16,045 --> 01:52:18,881
I then only required the notebook itself.

1105
01:52:19,382 --> 01:52:20,466
<i>You didn't make it easy.</i>

1106
01:52:22,468 --> 01:52:23,803
Just the bags.

1107
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:26,389
I would need to endure a considerable
amount of pain.

1108
01:52:28,766 --> 01:52:29,850
Mycroft...

1109
01:52:30,851 --> 01:52:34,647
...care of Her Majesty's Secret Service.

1110
01:52:34,814 --> 01:52:38,901
But the notebook would undoubtedly be
encoded, so how then to break the code?

1111
01:52:40,027 --> 01:52:42,405
- Rook takes rook.
- Pawn takes rook.

1112
01:52:42,571 --> 01:52:44,365
Bishop to bishop seven.

1113
01:52:44,532 --> 01:52:46,492
Queen takes knight pawn.

1114
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:52,039
Does <i>The Art of Domestic Horticulture</i>
mean anything to you?

1115
01:52:53,124 --> 01:52:55,668
<i>How could a man as meticulous as you
own such a book...</i>

1116
01:52:55,835 --> 01:52:59,922
...yet completely neglect the flowers
in his own window box? Irony abounds.

1117
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:08,055
Never mind, it's safe, in London...

1118
01:53:09,765 --> 01:53:12,351
<i>...where my colleagues are making
good use of it.</i>

1119
01:53:13,602 --> 01:53:17,440
<i>The most formidable criminal mind in
Europe has just had all his money stolen...</i>

1120
01:53:17,606 --> 01:53:22,194
...by perhaps the most inept inspector
in the history of Scotland Yard.

1121
01:53:22,361 --> 01:53:23,779
Any chance of a cup of tea?

1122
01:53:23,946 --> 01:53:26,615
Box 0403.

1123
01:53:27,033 --> 01:53:29,618
- Tick.
- Box 0801.

1124
01:53:29,785 --> 01:53:33,914
- How much more is there?
- That's the end of page two.

1125
01:53:34,081 --> 01:53:35,249
Page three.

1126
01:53:45,593 --> 01:53:50,765
He'll be making an anonymous donation
to the Widows and Orphans of War Fund.

1127
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:54,310
Bishop to bishop eight. Discover check.

1128
01:53:54,477 --> 01:53:57,104
And, incidentally, mate.

1129
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:04,069
I seem to have injured my shoulder.
Would you mind?

1130
01:54:09,575 --> 01:54:11,494
Be my pleasure.

1131
01:54:14,455 --> 01:54:18,334
Once we've concluded
our business here...

1132
01:54:18,501 --> 01:54:21,003
...it's important you know...

1133
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:25,341
...I shall endeavor to find the most
creative of endings for the doctor.

1134
01:54:28,844 --> 01:54:30,012
And his wife.

1135
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:36,769
<i>His advantage, my injury.</i>

1136
01:54:36,936 --> 01:54:39,939
<i>My advantage, his rage.</i>

1137
01:54:41,816 --> 01:54:46,195
<i>Incoming assault feral, but experienced.</i>

1138
01:54:46,445 --> 01:54:49,281
<i>Use his momentum to counter.</i>

1139
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:56,622
<i>Come now.</i>

1140
01:54:57,122 --> 01:55:01,377
<i>You really think you're the only one
who can play this game.</i>

1141
01:55:01,544 --> 01:55:05,130
<i>Trap arm. Target weakness.</i>

1142
01:55:05,548 --> 01:55:07,383
<i>Follow with haymaker.</i>

1143
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:10,553
<i>Ah. There we find
the boxing champion of Cambridge.</i>

1144
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:13,055
<i>Competent, but predictable.</i>

1145
01:55:15,432 --> 01:55:18,310
<i>Now allow me to reply.</i>

1146
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:23,148
<i>Arsenal running dry. Adjust strategy.</i>

1147
01:55:27,278 --> 01:55:29,405
<i>Wound taking its loll.</i>

1148
01:55:29,572 --> 01:55:34,076
<i>As I feared.
Injury makes defense untenable.</i>

1149
01:55:39,164 --> 01:55:43,168
<i>Prognosis increasingly negative.</i>

1150
01:55:47,089 --> 01:55:50,676
<i>Let's not waste any more
of one another's lime.</i>

1151
01:55:55,556 --> 01:55:58,475
<i>We both know how this ends.</i>

1152
01:56:12,448 --> 01:56:14,617
<i>Conclusion, inevitable.</i>

1153
01:56:17,411 --> 01:56:18,454
<i>Unless...</i>

1154
01:57:27,523 --> 01:57:31,735
<i>A few words may suffice
to tell the little that remains.</i>

1155
01:57:38,867 --> 01:57:44,206
<i>Any attempt at finding the bodies
was absolutely hopeless.</i>

1156
01:57:48,377 --> 01:57:50,546
<i>And so there...</i>

1157
01:57:50,713 --> 01:57:56,635
<i>...deep down in that dreadful caldron
of swirling water and seething foam...</i>

1158
01:58:02,057 --> 01:58:03,350
<i>...will lie for all lime...</i>

1159
01:58:06,478 --> 01:58:08,897
...the most dangerous criminal...

1160
01:58:10,899 --> 01:58:15,237
<i>...and the foremost champion of the law
of their generation.</i>

1161
01:58:20,409 --> 01:58:23,662
<i>I shall' ever regard him as the</i> best...

1162
01:58:28,584 --> 01:58:32,629
<i>...and the wisest man whom
I have ever known.</i>

1163
01:58:32,796 --> 01:58:34,465
John?

1164
01:58:37,009 --> 01:58:39,178
- John.
- Mm-hm.

1165
01:58:39,845 --> 01:58:41,430
You should probably pack.

1166
01:58:41,597 --> 01:58:42,681
It's half past 2...

1167
01:58:42,848 --> 01:58:44,767
- ...and the carriage is coming at 4.
- Mm.

1168
01:58:46,101 --> 01:58:48,520
It's gonna be a beautiful week
in Brighton.

1169
01:58:49,354 --> 01:58:51,190
Yes, it'll be fun.

1170
01:58:51,732 --> 01:58:53,150
I'm looking forward to it.

1171
01:58:55,319 --> 01:58:57,112
You know I miss him too..

1172
01:58:57,821 --> 01:58:59,448
...In my own way.

1173
01:59:06,622 --> 01:59:08,123
He would have wanted us to go.

1174
01:59:09,792 --> 01:59:12,628
He would have wanted to come with us.

1175
01:59:14,129 --> 01:59:16,465
When's Mrs. Hudson
coming for Gladstone?

1176
01:59:16,632 --> 01:59:18,801
Oh, soon.

1177
01:59:20,928 --> 01:59:22,638
Three o'clock.

1178
01:59:48,789 --> 01:59:50,249
Mary?

1179
01:59:51,834 --> 01:59:53,961
Who delivered this parcel?

1180
01:59:54,128 --> 01:59:56,088
The postman.

1181
01:59:57,506 --> 01:59:59,800
The usual chap or...

1182
01:59:59,967 --> 02:00:03,011
...did he look peculiar?
