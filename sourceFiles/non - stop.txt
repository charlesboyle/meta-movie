1
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:44,061
People have to realize, we cannot
make everybody totally safe,

2
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:48,024
even if we allocated the entire
federal budget towards security.

3
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,693
I promise you there is
not an easier job...

4
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:56,192
in the whole federal government than
riding first class in airplanes from...

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,370
Yeah.

6
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,244
I know. I'm sorry.

7
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,251
No, no, you can trust me. I'm fine.

8
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,501
What? I can't hear you.

9
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,674
I can't hear you!

10
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,610
Hey, man, you got a light?

11
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,120
Sir. Excuse me.

12
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,914
Excuse me, sir. You got a light?

13
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,537
Yeah. Sorry.

14
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,456
May I have your attention, please?

15
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,925
So, where you off to?

16
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,183
Where you headed?

17
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,607
I'm headed to Amsterdam.

18
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,735
May I have your attention, please?

19
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,196
The white zone is for
the immediate loading

20
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,741
and unloading of passengers only.

21
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,540
Here you go, sir.
Enjoy your flight.

22
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,542
Everyone and their mother's
in the game right now.

23
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:33,462
You got Korean phones, Japanese
phones, Scandinavian phones.

24
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,837
OS is trying to keep up with the hardware
from 15 different manufacturers.

25
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,714
Right!

26
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,012
That's what I've been saying.
No one listens to me!

27
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:46,684
Dude, you're preaching to the choir!
It makes absolutely no sense.

28
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,973
Really? I guess I'm in your way.

29
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,226
New Yorkers, man, I swear to God.
Give me two minutes.

30
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,279
Clear.

31
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,996
Right this way, sir. Please.

32
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:11,667
Listen to me. Listen to me. I cannot
stay in London for three days.

33
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,495
Get me on the next flight back.

34
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,756
Please, look. This is...

35
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,005
This is a bad time for...

36
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,719
"You have to do what you have to
do." Well, guess what? So do I.

37
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,567
Here.

38
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,198
Long flights are the worst.

39
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,571
No, thanks.

40
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,171
Hi, baby.

41
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,087
Good evening, passengers.

42
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,727
There's a mix-up
with my reservation.

43
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,057
I was supposed to have a window
seat and they put me in an aisle.

44
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,857
Maybe you could move
some people around,

45
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,150
'cause I was guaranteed
the window seat.

46
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,672
I'm sorry about that, Ms. Summers.

47
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,997
At this time we are inviting
passengers with small children,

48
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,621
or who require assistance,
to board at this time.

49
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,217
Once again, in the boarding area,

50
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,387
we are ready to begin our priority
boarding Flight 10 to London.

51
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,264
We'll begin general boarding
in just a few minutes.

52
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,640
Are you all set to board?

53
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,933
So we have to go on the runway?

54
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,643
Come on, sweetheart.
Is this everything?

55
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,812
Yeah. My mom checked
my big bag for me.

56
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,689
Have you flown by yourself before?

57
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,642
No. This is my first time.

58
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,437
You're gonna have a lovely time.

59
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,531
Welcome aboard. Yes, just through
there and down to the left.

60
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,242
Nancy, this is Becca. It's her
first time on an airplane.

61
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,661
Wonderful. Who's waiting
for you in London?

62
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,871
My dad.

63
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,495
Well, we've a seat by the
window all picked out for you.

64
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,342
Look, I know it may seem scary,
but flying's really quite fun.

65
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,762
I believe this little
guy made a run for it.

66
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,177
What's his name?

67
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,145
Henry.

68
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,856
Yeah, he looks like a Henry.
That's a good name.

69
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,604
- Well...
- Becca.

70
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,861
Becca, I think Henry's
a little scared.

71
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,906
Maybe you can show
him how it's done.

72
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,111
Good girl.

73
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,925
I'm sorry, am I in your way?

74
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,472
Again?

75
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,092
We are right up here.

76
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,435
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

77
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,521
As a reminder, all carry-on luggage
must fit in the overhead bin

78
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,521
or be safely stowed under
the seat in front of you.

79
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,860
If you're having trouble
fitting your luggage,

80
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,734
we'll be happy to check it for you.

81
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,742
Thank you for choosing British
Aqualantic. Enjoy the flight.

82
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,535
Do you know, is there
somebody sitting there?

83
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,371
- Do you know who has that seat?
- No, sorry.

84
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,290
Is somebody sitting here?

85
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,210
Hey, I'm on the plane. And guess what?
They effed up my reservation.

86
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,088
We land at 7:35.
Did they book a car?

87
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,172
Hang on. Hang on.

88
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,426
Excuse me. Sir? I'm here in 3B.

89
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,886
I was wondering if maybe
you'd switch seats

90
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,304
with me so I could have the window?

91
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,889
Do you care?

92
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,593
Do you speak English?

93
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,978
Okay. Thank you.

94
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,228
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir?

95
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,817
Hi. I'm right here, I'm in 3B

96
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,569
and I was just wondering if maybe
you would prefer the aisle,

97
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,738
or if you don't care, if you would

98
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,240
switch with me for the window seat?

99
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,617
A lot of people just sleep
anyway, so I was wondering if...

100
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,126
Sure. Why not?

101
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,297
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate that.

102
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,715
Sorry, let me get out of your way.

103
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,213
Let me help you.

104
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,714
There's room right up here.

105
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,728
Aqualantic is pleased to offer
extensive in-flight entertainment

106
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,272
with hundreds of video and music
programming at your fingertips.

107
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,066
Oh, God.

108
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,109
Hello? Are you there?

109
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,193
Your phone.

110
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,278
- What?
- Hello?

111
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,446
- Your phone.
- Oh, shit.

112
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,905
- Hello?
- Hi. Hi, hi.

113
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,326
I'll call you when we land, okay?
All right, bye.

114
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,618
Rough day, huh?

115
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,120
Yeah, you have no idea.

116
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,705
Hi, excuse me.

117
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,623
Could I get a gin and tonic,
when you get a chance?

118
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,373
- Of course.
- Make that two, please.

119
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,753
God.

120
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,138
- Nancy, right? Gwen.
- Yeah.

121
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,264
Thank God for you.

122
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,891
Girl doesn't show up and leaves me

123
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,476
to handle two cabins.
You're a lifesaver.

124
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,978
If I pass out, just promise to
catch me before I hit the floor.

125
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,726
Not if I do first.

126
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,483
Can I get you gentlemen
anything before we taxi?

127
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,652
No, thanks, Nance, I'm fine.

128
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,910
What?

129
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,328
Nothing.

130
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,373
Ground, this is AQ-10, we're ready
to disconnect ground power.

131
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,576
You naughty boy.

132
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,879
Naughty.

133
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,223
Thank you.

134
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,852
Didn't you order gin and tonic?

135
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,020
Did I?

136
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,894
'Cause she brought you a water.

137
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,147
It's not my lucky day.

138
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,425
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

139
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:39,721
welcome aboard British Aqualantic
Flight 10, non-stop service to London.

140
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,723
I'm your captain, David McMillan,

141
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,600
flying with First
Officer Kyle Rice.

142
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,227
And we expect a smooth
ride this evening

143
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,230
- with a flight time of just over six hours.
- Seatbelts, thank you.

144
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,809
We should have you in
the air momentarily.

145
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,610
This is a beautiful
picture they took of her.

146
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,031
Sir, could you move your
seat-back forward? Thank you.

147
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,281
Flight attendants, please
be seated for takeoff.

148
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,164
What's that for? Is that for luck?

149
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,374
Something like that.
My daughter gave it to me.

150
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,877
Better than a gin and tonic, I bet.

151
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,170
It is.

152
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,851
I'm Jen.

153
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,719
Bill.

154
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,939
- You fly much?
- All the time, actually.

155
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,733
Yeah, I can tell.

156
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,318
It's just the takeoff.
Once we're in the air, I'll...

157
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,494
You'll have a seizure?

158
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,912
I'll be fine. I promise.

159
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,875
You actually fly all the time?

160
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,704
Some things you never get used to.

161
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,717
How old's your daughter?

162
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,554
Now, she's, uh, 17.

163
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,892
What's her name?

164
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,185
Olivia.

165
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,519
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

166
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,973
I like that name, it's a nice name.

167
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,776
So, Why'd she give you the ribbon?

168
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:20,822
Some kids have blankets, stuffed animals.
Olivia had ribbons.

169
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,776
This was hers when she was little.

170
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:35,463
She'd tie it to a finger or
toe before going to bed.

171
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,839
And then in the morning,
she'd make me guess.

172
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,966
- Where she put it?
- Yeah.

173
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,759
That's cute. That's really cute.

174
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,178
Yeah, and then she grew up.

175
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,802
I suppose I need it
more than she did.

176
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,973
Anyway.

177
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,186
So, what do you do for a living?

178
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,902
Well...

179
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,570
I fly a lot.

180
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,897
Oh. yeah?

181
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,158
Yeah, but I think that

182
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,494
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

183
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,496
- Get some sleep, sure.
- Yeah, it's gonna be a long flight.

184
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,745
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sleep well.

185
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,141
- Stop!
- Baby...

186
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,815
- You're crazy!
- You're so hot, baby, I can't stop it! I can't!

187
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,650
People are watching!

188
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,321
No, no, no. Nobody's
watching. Nobody.

189
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,617
Oh, my God.

190
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,077
In front of my mom,
with no pants on

191
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,079
and half a Toblerone in his mouth.

192
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,907
He didn't.

193
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,285
Do you know him?

194
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,101
Excuse me.

195
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,804
What kind of tea do you have?

196
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,898
I'll have chamomile. Thanks.

197
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,476
Certainly.

198
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,412
- This your idea of a joke?
- What're you talking about?

199
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,289
If you have a problem with
me, say it to my face.

200
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,249
Don't play games on a
flight in a secure network.

201
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,459
You need to calm down, partner.

202
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,629
I was a cop for 25 years.
I knew men like you.

203
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,005
Men like me?

204
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,465
Men like me follow
goddamn protocol.

205
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,883
We're not even supposed
to be talking right now.

206
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,802
It's a secure network, Jack!

207
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,143
Bill, what the hell are
you talking about?

208
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,976
Don't deny you sent these.

209
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,107
Bill, I didn't send these.

210
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,400
See for yourself.

211
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,456
Then someone on this flight is
threatening to kill a passenger

212
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:13,712
unless $150 million is transferred
in the next 18 minutes.

213
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,004
Who knows about this?

214
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,377
You and me.

215
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,347
I say no way. It's bullshit.

216
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,683
Any threat to an aircraft
requires immediate landing.

217
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:30,353
Right, yeah, all right.
If there is a threat.

218
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,688
Come on, Bill.
You wanna be the agent

219
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:32,981
who lands an international flight

220
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,566
because some asshole knows
your personal problems?

221
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,359
Sends you a couple of joke texts?

222
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,820
Bill, I gotta ask you, how
many have you had today?

223
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,447
A threat's a threat!

224
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,573
Okay.

225
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,783
You really need to think this
through, partner, all right?

226
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,243
Listen, how do you
kill somebody aboard

227
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,884
a crowded plane and
get away with it?

228
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,165
Pretty hard to pull that
off, don't you think?

229
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:55,213
Bill, if there's not a
situation, you don't create one.

230
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,299
I'm going to see the captain.

231
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,592
You keep your eye
on the main cabin.

232
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,922
Bill? Don't panic
the cockpit. Bill?

233
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,187
I tell you, it's five hours in

234
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,267
and then, out of nowhere, he
suddenly sits up and he says...

235
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,494
- How do we validate the threat?
- We can't.

236
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,872
Captain? TSA says a full cross
check on the passenger manifest

237
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,246
could take 25 to 30 minutes.

238
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,672
We can divert the flight,
if this is for real.

239
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,424
The nearest airport?

240
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,426
Well, it's 95 minutes
back to Halifax,

241
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,596
two hours to Iceland,
three to London.

242
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,175
We're midway over the Atlantic.

243
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,233
You Okay?

244
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:02,029
It's this juice fast I'm on.
Gives me the shakes.

245
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,863
It's your call, Bill.

246
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,953
Do we have a situation?

247
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,917
Can we review the footage?

248
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,419
It's recorded directly
to the black box.

249
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,005
But I can watch all the camera
feeds live from the galley?

250
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,207
Yeah.

251
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,925
Get back on the line with TSA.

252
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,969
See if they can back trace
this account number.

253
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,299
In the meantime, I'll need
the passenger manifest.

254
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,921
I'll see if I can find him.

255
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,520
But in 10 minutes, I'd like you
to switch off the network system.

256
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,691
We don't want him checking to
see if a transfer's been made.

257
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,310
Nancy, come with me.

258
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,748
Two cameras in business,
six in coach.

259
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,000
We're gonna need more eyes.

260
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,293
I'll get another attendant.

261
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,961
How well do you know the crew?

262
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,835
Not very well.

263
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,179
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

264
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,382
Will you come with me, please?

265
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,516
Now?

266
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,856
You want me to come right now?

267
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,822
This is a bad idea.

268
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,449
She was sitting beside
me when this started.

269
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,201
The only two people I trust on
this airplane are you and her.

270
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,746
Trust me with what?
What's going on?

271
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,666
I text, you circle any
passenger with a phone

272
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,793
or acting like they have a phone.

273
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,795
I'm not sure I understand what
it is you want me to do...

274
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,669
Please, just do as I ask.

275
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,380
Ladies and gentlemen, looks like

276
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,589
we've hit some
unexpected turbulence.

277
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,634
Please return to your seats and
keep your seatbelts fastened

278
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,835
until it's safe to move about
the cabin. Thank you.

279
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,453
There. 9B.

280
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,841
Seat 9B. David Norton.

281
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,825
22C.

282
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,617
Austin Reilly.

283
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,469
2F.

284
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,429
Jason Cole.

285
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,884
14C.

286
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,311
14C, Charles Wheeler.

287
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,024
13B.

288
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,022
Fahim Nasir.

289
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,696
5B.

290
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,323
5B. Iris Marianne.

291
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,321
You better answer it.

292
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,952
Hello?

293
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,286
Bill?

294
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,999
Bill?

295
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,887
- Who is this?
- This is Philip Marenick.

296
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,890
I'm with TSA. I understand from
the captain you have a situation.

297
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,183
I need to speak to my supervisor.

298
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,352
Listen, I'm calling from
the DHS here in D.C.

299
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,521
From here on out,
I am your supervisor.

300
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,605
Now, Agent Marks, I need you...

301
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,525
I'm going to run seat numbers by you.
I need red flags and priors.

302
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,527
- That's a very serious request you put in.
- 20G.

303
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,820
Agent Marks, I need you to take me

304
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,029
through the events
from the beginning.

305
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,989
And we're looking into tracing
the account number you gave us.

306
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,074
20G again.

307
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,516
And as you know, protocol
dictates in these situations...

308
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,912
we corroborate everything with
the second officer on board.

309
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:03,996
20G again.

310
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,039
It's not him.

311
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,709
It's not who? Look, I'd rather
not jump to any conclusions.

312
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,545
Listen, Bill, I don't think
you're in a position to sort out

313
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,373
who's a suspect or
not at this point.

314
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,377
Agent Marks?

315
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,089
Bill?

316
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,975
Agent Marks, I need some sort
of acknowledgment from you.

317
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,348
Bill?

318
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,763
Agent Marks?

319
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,438
Marks, you need to answer me.

320
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,982
Hang on.

321
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,243
Marks, are you there?

322
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,991
Go back to your seat.

323
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,001
You son-of-a-bitch!

324
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,169
Keep your voice down.

325
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,122
- Hand it over!
- What're you...

326
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,591
Bill, look at me, okay?
I need this money.

327
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,633
I can cut you in...

328
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,093
- Give me the goddamn phone, Jack.
- Just listen to me.

329
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,762
Give me the phone...

330
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,189
Jack! You son-of-a-bitch.

331
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,607
- Give it up, Marks.
- Stop it!

332
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,060
- Give it up.
- Stop it.

333
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,819
Damn it, Jack!

334
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,660
Stop it. Stop it!

335
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,704
Stop fighting!

336
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,622
Jack!

337
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,060
Don't do this, Jack.

338
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,685
Stop it!

339
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,737
Don't.

340
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,863
Don't.

341
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,862
Don't do this, Jack!

342
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,987
Don't!

343
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,859
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

344
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,277
I apologize for the
inconvenience...

345
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,612
Shit.

346
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,280
But our network is
down for the moment.

347
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,824
If you just bear with us, we'll
attempt to restart the Internet.

348
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,451
- Turn the network back on.
- What?

349
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,952
The network, turn it on.

350
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,996
We'll keep you posted.

351
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,452
I need the network system back on.

352
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,121
Go ahead, Nance.

353
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,844
The account number you gave us.

354
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,263
It's in your name.

355
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,018
What?

356
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,516
TSA just confirmed it.

357
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,145
That doesn't make any sense.

358
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,859
You know me.
You know I'd never do...

359
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,733
I know, I know.

360
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,695
Look, the 20 minutes are up.
Has anything happened?

361
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,122
No.

362
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,832
It's probably just a hoax.

363
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:02,209
Some elaborate middle finger
to the airline industry.

364
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,839
Excuse me. Are you waiting?

365
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,674
No. Go ahead.

366
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,925
Agent...

367
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,469
Hi, ma'am.

368
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,348
Agent Marenick, who you spoke with,

369
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,435
will continue to handle the
investigation from D.C.

370
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,519
David...

371
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,815
And they've asked me to take
your badge and your gun.

372
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,859
- No.
- Bill.

373
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,232
- No.
- Bill...

374
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,738
I don't have a choice here.

375
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,778
I'm the air marshal.

376
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,905
- Bill...
- Okay. Okay.

377
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,706
Look, just sit back, relax,

378
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,082
- and...
- Enjoy the flight.

379
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,876
Enjoy the flight, yeah.

380
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,395
Was it him? The guy in 20G?

381
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,394
No, it was nothing.

382
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,733
I dropped my stupid
phone in the sink.

383
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,693
Oh, God, I do that all the time.

384
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,029
I lost like five
phones in six months,

385
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,281
and then I learned
this little trick.

386
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,859
Here we go.

387
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,529
So, should I be worried?

388
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,455
No, not at all.

389
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,784
It was a mistake to
involve you, I'm sorry.

390
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,954
So, if it's not him, then
why do you have his phone?

391
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,421
I have to be careful, even when

392
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,756
there's nothing to
be concerned about.

393
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,798
It's my job.

394
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,424
As a passenger, don't I have the
right to know what's going on?

395
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,263
- Listen... Jen, right?
- Yeah.

396
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,808
It's an innocent prank.
Some kid with a cell phone.

397
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,935
If it was on the ground,
I'd catch him

398
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,728
in two seconds flat, but up here,

399
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,105
traveling at 500 miles an hour,
I can't track his phone.

400
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,190
There's nothing I can do.

401
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,511
There's nothing you can do?
Aren't you an air marshal?

402
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,403
Ma'am, please return to your seat.

403
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,981
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

404
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,449
Please return to your seat.

405
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,992
Seriously? Did you call me "ma'am"?

406
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,536
Now.

407
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,530
Okay, Bill.

408
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,373
I'm going.

409
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,167
- Thank you.
- Ugh.

410
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,875
Agent Hammond?

411
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,578
Just a moment.

412
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,312
Nancy.

413
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,403
Sorry. The indicator
must be broken.

414
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,447
I was looking for Agent Hammond.

415
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,235
What's wrong?

416
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,211
Nancy, wait. Wait!

417
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,634
Nancy, please.

418
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,302
Calm down, calm down.

419
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,762
Calm down.

420
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,057
Please, I can explain this.

421
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,808
Okay?

422
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,598
This is a setup.

423
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,149
The captain just told
me that the account

424
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,610
they want the money
wired to is in my name.

425
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,564
Do you think I would
extort $150 million

426
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,484
using an account in my own name?

427
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,320
He was transporting cocaine, Nancy.

428
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,539
Whoever we're looking
for knew that.

429
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,493
He threatened Hammond,
made him paranoid.

430
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,830
I found out, and Hammond
tried to kill me.

431
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,924
The person who's doing this,
he wants it to look like this.

432
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,675
Like two federal agents are
the ones doing this, not him.

433
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,350
Jack pulled a gun on me.
I had no choice.

434
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,520
Nancy?

435
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,853
I had no choice.

436
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,528
You know me.

437
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,025
You know I could never
do something like this.

438
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,818
Look at me.

439
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,327
I need you to believe me.

440
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,874
I believe you.

441
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:45,384
In 13 minutes, someone else will
die, unless I find him first.

442
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,384
I need you to help me.

443
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,690
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

444
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,525
My name is Bill Marks.

445
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,361
I'm the federal air marshal
assigned to this flight.

446
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,655
I apologize for the disturbance.

447
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,991
The TSA has recently
instituted a policy

448
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,535
of random searches aboard
international flights.

449
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,539
Unfortunately, this is one of
three lucky flights this month.

450
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,374
I'm gonna be coming
through the cabin.

451
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,293
If I call your name
and seat number,

452
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,337
please stand up and
move into the aisle.

453
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:24,343
If you're in possession of an
illegal substance, item or weapon,

454
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,719
it's best to just step forward now.

455
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,514
Captain, you might
want to hear this.

456
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,892
I need everybody to place both
hands on the seat in front of you.

457
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,187
What the hell is he doing?

458
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,146
Right now!

459
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,772
Contact TSA, tell them we
have a possible hijacking.

460
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,113
- Nancy, what's going on?
- It's just a random search.

461
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,151
Thank you.

462
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,576
Excuse me.

463
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,450
Jennifer Summers?

464
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,414
Should I have told you
about the bomb in my bag?

465
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,494
Let's not use that word
on a plane, please.

466
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,712
When I move on to the main
cabin, you watch business class.

467
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,214
If you see anything suspicious,

468
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,674
anything at all, get my attention.

469
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,217
- Scream, if you have to.
- Okay.

470
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,219
American paranoia.

471
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,390
Iris Marianne, 5B.
Stand up, please.

472
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,141
Is that how older men
pick up younger women?

473
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,438
Fondle first, talk later?

474
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,982
Phone.

475
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,819
Why don't you enter your number?

476
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,117
You're a little young for me.

477
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,792
Who does this guy think he is?

478
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,337
It's all right. Just calm down!

479
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,755
- Just married?
- Yesterday.

480
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,632
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

481
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,967
Sit down.

482
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,094
It's nothing to worry about.
Happens all the time.

483
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,054
- 13B, Fahim Nasir.
- Bullshit.

484
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,178
- Stand.
- Thank you, sir.

485
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,315
Feeling okay?

486
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,317
Flying is not my cup of tea.

487
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,568
Tell me about it.

488
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,445
- You're a doctor.
- How do you know?

489
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,572
Your bag. Can you
fetch it up, please?

490
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,867
Sure. It's right down here.

491
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,332
What kind of doctor?

492
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,666
Molecular neuroscience.

493
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,710
Sounds interesting.

494
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,421
Hey, look, man, some of us
need to get some sleep.

495
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,624
Sir, sit down. Be quiet.

496
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:30,049
14C, Charles Wheeler? Stand.

497
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,175
There was nothing in his bag?

498
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,894
What's the purpose of your trip?

499
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,438
I have a client in Brighton.
I'm a bankruptcy attorney.

500
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,482
Yeah? You any good?

501
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,777
- Why? Oh, you need one?
- Sit down.

502
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:51,404
Sir, you need to keep your hands on
the seat in front of you. Thank you.

503
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,527
This sucks.

504
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,708
This is crazy. Are we next?

505
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,210
Just relax.

506
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:07,416
Okay, 22C. Austin Reilly. Stand.

507
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,218
Hey, look. Can we move this along?
Seriously, man.

508
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,262
I'm not gonna tell you again.

509
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,807
Mr. Reilly, what do
you do for a living?

510
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,555
NYPD.

511
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,644
London your final destination?

512
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,730
My fairy brother's getting married
to a guy with a British accent.

513
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,774
Mind if I take a
look at your phone?

514
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,820
Come on, man. Are you serious?

515
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,115
This is some Big Brother-type shit.

516
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,613
Take your seat.

517
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,079
You, step into the aisle.
Come on, up!

518
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,414
Up! Right now!

519
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,082
Nah, man, I'm good.

520
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,376
I'm not asking. Shades off.

521
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,836
Come on. What is it,
like 2:00 a.m.?

522
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,879
Why don't you go back up there
so I can go back to sleep, man?

523
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,007
- Shades.
- No, dude!

524
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,631
Come on, man! Yo, chill!

525
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,430
Let me see your phone.

526
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,178
I don't have a phone, man.

527
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,517
Jesus.

528
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,977
This isn't yours?

529
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,437
Man, I ain't never
seen that before.

530
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,642
Looks a hell of a lot like the
one you were using at the gate.

531
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,945
This is ridiculous.

532
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,450
Sit down.

533
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,408
Gladly.

534
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,651
What happened to Amsterdam?

535
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,320
I'm connecting to London.

536
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,948
Show me your boarding pass.
What's your name?

537
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,201
Tom Bowen. Why?

538
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,952
Man, take it easy.

539
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,329
Move!

540
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,498
I didn't do anything!

541
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,000
Look, I have rights!

542
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,794
Come here.

543
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,422
- Marenick?
- Marks, what the hell is going on there?

544
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,507
Listen to me. The threat is real.

545
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,675
I want you to stop doing whatever
you're doing immediately.

546
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,845
I have a suspect in custody.
I need a background check.

547
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,848
Seat 24E, Tom Bowen, B-O-W-E-N.

548
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,976
You have unlawfully subdued
innocent passengers, Marks.

549
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,019
I don't have time for this.

550
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,313
You called your supervisor before
the flight and threatened him.

551
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,023
- What?
- He wouldn't book you an overtime flight

552
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,483
and you said you'd do
what you had to do.

553
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,276
- I didn't threaten anyone.
- Is that right? Marks?

554
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,363
I need to run a full check
on Tom Bowen, seat 24E.

555
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,490
- Marks, damn you!
- Now! You're wasting time.

556
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,034
Marks... Agent Marks, you are hereby
relieved of duty. Do you hear me?

557
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,871
In three minutes, someone on this
plane is gonna die. Do you hear me?

558
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,458
Bowen is clean, Bill. He's a
schoolteacher, for Christ's sake.

559
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,661
He has family in London.

560
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,875
Everyone on that flight is clean.
Everyone except you.

561
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,672
Marks?

562
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,798
You said Amsterdam.

563
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,849
I never asked you
where you were going.

564
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,475
You volunteered that information.

565
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,185
Why would you lie
to a federal agent?

566
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,229
Look, I didn't know you
were a federal agent.

567
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,523
Why would you lie to a stranger?

568
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,729
You can answer questions now, or
in federal custody when we land.

569
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,195
Look. Okay, Jesus.

570
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,531
He said he'd give me $100 if I asked
you where you were flying. Okay?

571
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,032
I don't know why I said Amsterdam.

572
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,868
I swear to God, I didn't know
you were a federal marshal.

573
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,411
- Bullshit!
- I swear to God!

574
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,205
He said he wanted to play a prank
on his friend. Will, right?

575
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,790
Bill.

576
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,375
Bill. Whatever, man.
I did it for 100 bucks.

577
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,419
- Who was he?
- I don't know!

578
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,503
What does he look like?

579
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,757
He was white with brown hair, a European
accent, like 30, 35 years old...

580
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,926
- Is he on this plane?
- I don't know, I didn't see him.

581
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,012
When I went back, he didn't
pay me, he was already gone.

582
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,847
- You'd know him if you saw him?
- I don't know!

583
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:47,058
I never saw him get on
the plane, man, I swear!

584
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,977
Humor me. Look!

585
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,064
God damn it!

586
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,767
Come on, look.

587
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,235
I don't see him.

588
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,608
Look.

589
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,119
- Come on, look!
- God damn it! I don't see him!

590
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,288
- Right there.
- Where?

591
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,207
Right there. The glasses.

592
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,910
Come on, move.

593
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,463
This is crazy.

594
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,008
You! You. Look at me.

595
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,135
Look at me! What's your name?

596
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,762
Michael. Michael Tate.

597
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,597
- Well?
- It's not him.

598
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:28,642
- You're sure?
- Yeah, God damn it, I'm sure!

599
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,477
Look, if I'd seen him
get on the plane,

600
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,812
I would've gone and
asked him for my money.

601
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,606
What's going on?

602
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,980
Nancy, watch business class.

603
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,197
Turn around.

604
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,951
- Are you serious?
- Don't talk.

605
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,792
Now, sit down.

606
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,370
Don't move.

607
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,548
Oh, God.

608
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,921
Nancy!

609
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,022
Everybody remain in your seats.

610
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,571
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats

611
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,240
and keep your seatbelts fastened.

612
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,249
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats

613
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,873
and keep your seatbelts fastened.

614
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,964
Nancy, are you okay?

615
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,633
- Yeah.
- You sure?

616
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:25,842
What's happened?

617
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:38,229
He started having chest pains, then
he just collapsed over the yoke!

618
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,807
- Come on, come on!
- Wake up!

619
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,275
- Sit down!
- What the hell was that?

620
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,027
Everything's under control.

621
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,862
Excuse me. Excuse me.

622
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,280
Is the captain okay?

623
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,199
- Dr. Nasir?
- I didn't do anything, I...

624
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,034
Come with me, now.

625
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:55,080
Marshal! Is someone gonna tell
us what the hell is going on?

626
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,122
I need your help.

627
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,666
Hey! People are scared!

628
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,210
We have a right to know
why you searched us.

629
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,962
Why this plane almost went down!

630
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,215
Hey, Marshal, you and I are
gonna have a conversation.

631
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,967
Don't you walk away from me.

632
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,302
Doctor, cockpit, now!

633
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,804
You're letting that
guy in the cockpit?

634
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,889
Here's what's gonna happen. You're
gonna get back to your seat,

635
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,975
you're gonna sit down, and
you're gonna shut up.

636
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,018
Or what?

637
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,436
From one cop to another,

638
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,015
you know.

639
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,163
There was nothing I could do.

640
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:11,198
Excuse me, miss? You were sitting
next to that guy, the marshal?

641
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,734
You know what's happening?

642
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,736
I have no idea.

643
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,537
There's no evidence of assault.

644
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,544
It could be poison.
Induced anaphylaxis.

645
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,296
- What?
- Allergic reaction.

646
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,545
Without an autopsy, I...

647
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,634
Yeah.

648
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,886
Doctor, would you mind seeing

649
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:36,681
if any of the passengers in
coach need medical assistance?

650
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,883
This...

651
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,353
This stays between us. Please.

652
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,183
Nancy, go with him.

653
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,588
Kyle.

654
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:12,544
Kyle, did the captain leave the
cockpit since I last spoke with him?

655
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,930
- You?
- No.

656
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,389
Did anyone else enter?

657
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,933
No.

658
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:24,103
Has he had anything
to eat or drink?

659
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,521
I don't think so.

660
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,733
Have you or the captain had any
reason to unlock this door?

661
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,776
Of course not.

662
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,402
So you and he were both alone here,

663
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,323
on the flight deck, for
the past 20 minutes?

664
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,114
You bastard.

665
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,199
Don't get emotional.

666
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,992
I'm getting emotional? Look at you!

667
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,452
Rice, if you have a
problem with me...

668
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,120
I have a problem with my
friend dying next to me.

669
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,830
I have a problem with being accused

670
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,499
of not only murder,
but also hijacking.

671
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,917
I didn't accuse you of hijacking.

672
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:49,254
Christ, I've heard about you.
About your problems with money.

673
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,089
With drinking. TSA.

674
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,800
They gave a paranoid
alcoholic a gun and a badge

675
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,468
and they put him on my plane.

676
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,171
Brilliant.

677
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,972
You're gonna hit me?

678
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,471
Don't tell... Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

679
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:10,192
This door stays locked until
this plane lands safely. Okay?

680
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,284
- Marenick...
- Marks, God damn it, I thought I told you...

681
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,286
The captain's dead.

682
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,495
Excuse me?

683
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,707
The cockpit was secured,
locked from the inside.

684
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,167
Let me guess, were
you inside, Bill?

685
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,628
The co-pilot said the man
just collapsed beside him.

686
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,465
It could be induced anaphylaxis,
I think it's called.

687
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,509
Induced... What are
you talking about?

688
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,838
Poisoning, I don't know how.

689
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,182
It was just he and the co-pilot,
and the co-pilot, I trust.

690
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,267
For now.

691
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,561
"For now"? I don't
know about this, Bill.

692
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,646
Marenick, you need to
transfer the money.

693
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,772
Where is Agent Hammond?

694
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,973
I need to corroborate
everything you're telling us.

695
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,526
Hammond's dead.

696
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,652
What?

697
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,529
- He had cocaine in his carry-on.
- Jesus Christ!

698
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,905
I confronted him, he pulled a gun.

699
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:01,159
- Are you serious?
- Marenick. Transfer the money.

700
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,452
Buy me time. I'll find him.

701
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,661
Transfer the money.

702
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,205
$150 million into your account?

703
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,625
Is that something you're
seriously asking me to do, Bill?

704
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,711
The moment we land, arrest me,
freeze the funds. Just transfer it.

705
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,171
I can't do that, Bill.

706
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,672
The airline believes
paying the demand

707
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,591
will set a dangerous and
irreversible precedent.

708
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,801
Christ, there are 150
people on this plane.

709
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,803
Which makes me wonder why you
haven't cut the network.

710
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,181
You have 150 people panicking,

711
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,684
contacting their families, while we're
trying to handle the situation.

712
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,269
You attribute all
this to a passenger,

713
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,189
but you can give me no
proof he actually exists.

714
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,191
I won't cut the network. I need
to communicate with this guy.

715
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,568
Then, Agent Marks, I can't
continue talking to you.

716
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,653
What does that mean?

717
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,949
It means we will not
negotiate with a terrorist.

718
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,445
Nancy.

719
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,457
Who else in the crew has
access to the cockpit?

720
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,709
Just me.

721
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,551
Would you like to see
my phone, Agent Marks?

722
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,326
Is your interview in the morning?

723
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,953
Yeah. If we ever make it there.

724
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,454
Yeah, if we ever land, right?

725
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,956
Exactly. But it shouldn't...

726
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,374
I'm sorry. I'll get up.

727
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,751
No. Please, don't worry about it.
Zack, this is Bill.

728
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,877
Bill, Zack.

729
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,171
We were just talking and
Zack was telling me

730
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,545
that he's a programmer
for smart phones.

731
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,084
Is that right?

732
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,928
Yeah. I'm interviewing
at Paige in the morning

733
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,930
for a software analytics position.

734
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,516
Which, technically, isn't
programming. But...

735
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,309
Look, I'm sorry for being
such an asshole earlier...

736
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,603
Yeah, but you were a
programmer, right?

737
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,523
I was telling him that I
keep losing my phone,

738
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:56,649
and because I keep my ringer off...

739
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,023
It'd be nice if there
was a way to find it.

740
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,863
Yeah, but apparently, it's
pretty simple, right?

741
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,990
- I didn't say it was simple...
- GPS?

742
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,408
Carrier signal triangulation?

743
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,868
No.

744
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:10,037
Basically, you just send an intrusion
virus attached to a picture text

745
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,457
that switches the phone
from silent to ring.

746
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,168
Most phones load images
automatically, so if you...

747
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,795
What if there's no
cell phone coverage?

748
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,339
If it's two phones on
a smaller network?

749
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,675
It's the same protocol.
Even over Wi-Fi.

750
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,174
How fast could you do
something like that?

751
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:26,846
What, like right now?

752
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,930
Yes.

753
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,432
There are variables.

754
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,558
The phone and the network.

755
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,560
If the other phone is
even turned on or not.

756
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,313
It's on. But the target
number is anonymous.

757
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:38,108
You have to send it
from this phone.

758
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,155
Jesus.

759
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,157
Marshal, I don't know about this.

760
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,325
Can you do it?

761
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,119
This dude is talking about killing people.
Can he see us right now?

762
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,321
I'm here.

763
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,582
I guess I can give it a shot.
But I can't guarantee...

764
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:55,917
How fast?

765
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,495
Thirty minutes?

766
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,287
Twenty?

767
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,340
We have less than eight minutes.

768
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,753
You can do it. That's why
they want to hire you, right?

769
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,797
Eight minutes.

770
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,673
Okay.

771
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,642
Tell me when it's ready.

772
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,219
Thanks, ma'am.

773
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,363
Hey, hey.

774
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,489
What did you see up there?

775
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,783
I'm really not at liberty to say.

776
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,533
What, are you like a
doctor or something?

777
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,208
What the hell?

778
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,461
Ladies and gentlemen, if I
can have your attention.

779
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,881
The business cabin is now closed.

780
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:47,844
I repeat, the business cabin
is now closed to everyone.

781
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,929
Flight attendants, if
you could do your best,

782
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,014
please, to accommodate
all passengers.

783
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,387
Thank you.

784
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,066
I have a family, for Christ's sake!

785
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,068
We have a situation.

786
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,320
Hey, man, you gonna tell us what
the hell is going on or not?

787
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,489
Is the captain all right or not?

788
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:13,077
The... The situation
is quite complicated.

789
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,328
Complicated? Come on!

790
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,663
But I can assure you...

791
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:16,914
This is bullshit!

792
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,082
Everything's in hand!

793
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,458
Everything is under control!

794
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,419
Everyone, calm down!

795
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,879
I want to see the captain.

796
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,832
I'm gonna head up there myself.

797
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,800
That's it. Move aside, Marshal.

798
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,218
Wait, wait. Free travel.

799
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,470
Free flights!

800
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,847
Free travel.

801
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,308
The airline company will guarantee

802
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,685
one year's international
free travel.

803
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:41,898
If you sit down, remain
quiet, and do what I say.

804
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,443
Free international travel.

805
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,149
Thank you.

806
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,778
Twelve months.

807
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,980
Free.

808
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,281
Guaranteed.

809
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,905
One year. Free travel. Thank you.

810
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:56,913
Kyle, it's Bill.

811
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,286
Why are we turning?

812
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,208
I've been instructed not to
communicate with you, Marks.

813
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:04,458
Did they tell you to cut
the network? Listen to me.

814
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,549
The men who issued those
instructions are not on this plane.

815
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,845
This is your plane. These
are your passengers. Rice!

816
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:13,888
Kyle!

817
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:17,059
We've been diverted north.
55 minutes.

818
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,018
Did they tell you
to cut the network?

819
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,562
I have orders, Marks.

820
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,356
Give me five minutes. Five minutes.

821
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,857
Land the plane wherever you want,

822
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,317
but do not switch that network off.

823
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,987
Do you hear me? I have a plan.
I can find this guy.

824
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,610
Five minutes.

825
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,916
I hope we can trust this guy.

826
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,167
I trust him.

827
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:47,339
Yeah, well, I'd rather not end
up an accessory to a hijacking.

828
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,423
- Okay.
- Zack.

829
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,717
It's done.
Here it is.

830
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,919
Good man.

831
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,806
You think the captain's still
in control of the plane?

832
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,391
The plane almost goes down,

833
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,935
there's a guy waving his gun
around, tying people up.

834
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,812
I'd say he pretty
much took control.

835
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:07,234
So you think the thing about free
international flights was bullshit, or...

836
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,904
At what point do we do something?

837
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,907
Gentlemen, would you please
return to your seats?

838
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,909
You don't know what's
going on either, do you?

839
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,184
So, what's the air
marshal up to now?

840
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,146
Ladies and gentlemen,

841
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,481
I need every passenger to raise
their hands above their heads

842
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,855
and remain silent for
the next 60 seconds.

843
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,071
This is not a request.

844
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,235
Up.

845
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,326
Flight attendants, too.

846
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,831
Up!

847
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,105
- Hands behind your head.
- What the fuck...

848
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,546
Hands behind your goddamn head!

849
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,063
Remove the phone. With one hand.

850
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,531
I've never seen that phone before.

851
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,825
Miss, undo his seatbelt.

852
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,498
Stand up, now.

853
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,502
You searched me.
My phone was in my bag.

854
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,044
Into the aisle.

855
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,546
Whatever you think I've done...

856
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,382
Shut up. Front of the plane. Move!

857
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,967
You're making a mistake.

858
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,715
Turn around.

859
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,763
Take it easy!

860
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,673
What's going on?

861
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,011
Listen to me, please!
That's not my phone!

862
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,229
Who are you?

863
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,023
Just a passenger!

864
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,525
Why did you open the
account in my name?

865
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,818
I don't know what
you're talking about!

866
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,445
Answer the question, or
I will break your arm.

867
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,239
You got the wrong guy!

868
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,948
We found him, Nancy. We got him.

869
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,667
Why me? Why?

870
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,211
Why me?

871
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,501
Why?

872
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,586
Nancy, get the doctor. Now!

873
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,265
Bill? Bill?

874
01:01:59,266 --> 01:02:00,504
Bill? Bill?

875
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,891
Okay, let's break this down.

876
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,810
First, he ties up that guy, then he takes
another guy and brings him out back.

877
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,854
What, is he gonna pick
us off one by one?

878
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,309
That's the doctor right there. Hey.

879
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,529
You want to let us all
know what's going on?

880
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,993
- And the captain?
- Dead.

881
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:36,370
The co-pilot is flying.
Behind locked doors.

882
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,767
- Are you all right?
- Me? Fine. I'm great.

883
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,936
You shouldn't be seeing all this.

884
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:58,809
All right, Doc. So, we got a
dead passenger and a dead pilot.

885
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,777
The plane took a hard
turn 15 minutes ago.

886
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,612
That doesn't happen mid-flight.

887
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,031
The marshal closed
off business class,

888
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,409
moved all the
passengers to the back.

889
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,283
Does this scenario ring any bells?

890
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,136
You think he's gonna
crash the plane?

891
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,356
Flight 10, this is
Royal Air Force 114,

892
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,730
call sign Jackrabbit. How copy?

893
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:12,699
Excuse me.

894
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,410
I was told I could stay
here with my husband.

895
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,828
Of course.

896
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,623
You used the lavatory about an
hour ago. Do you remember that?

897
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,659
I don't have Alzheimer's.

898
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,287
Do you know if someone else
went in there after you?

899
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,333
Yes, she was standing
there blocking the aisle.

900
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,591
Who?

901
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,839
The redhead.

902
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,638
The woman you were sitting next to.

903
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,356
What are you doing in here?

904
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,821
I'm drinking. I'm sorry, I shouldn't.
That's just terrible.

905
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,569
I've been wondering.

906
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,535
Why the window seat?

907
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,579
What? Why the window seat?

908
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,914
Why did you sit next to me?

909
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,708
- What?
- I found a hole

910
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,961
in the first class toilet,
clear shot to the captain.

911
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,257
The guy who died had one of
these imbedded in his skin.

912
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,793
Ever seen one before?

913
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,260
No.

914
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,513
The toilets were locked 10
minutes before the captain died.

915
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,887
Five minutes before that,
I saw a woman enter.

916
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,226
She's 70 years old.

917
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,187
She said you went in after her,

918
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:27,063
and she doesn't have Alzheimer's,
if you're wondering.

919
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,153
Are you asking me if I
saw someone else go in,

920
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,947
or if I killed the captain?

921
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,988
Did you see someone else?

922
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,119
No.

923
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,867
Then answer the question.

924
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,875
You're a dick.

925
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:47,628
You switched seats to be next to
me, which made you trustworthy.

926
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,254
You engaged me in conversation.

927
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,339
To relax you because
you were scared...

928
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,548
Yet you evaded personal questions.

929
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,468
You mean, like where I work. Yeah,
that's a great personal question.

930
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,969
You inserted yourself
into the investigation.

931
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,221
Are you serious?

932
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,680
Tracking the phone,
that was your idea.

933
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,890
Are you kidding me?

934
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,434
I am the only person on this
plane who has stood by you.

935
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,810
You've been lying to
me this entire time.

936
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:05,896
You've been lying to me since the
second you boarded this plane.

937
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,691
Oh, God! Okay, fine, fine!

938
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,612
Seven years ago my heart failed,

939
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:16,281
and I was dead for like 43 minutes.

940
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,116
Aortic arch aneurysm.

941
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,285
They tried to fix it,
but when I woke up,

942
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,954
they told me it was
something they couldn't fix

943
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,876
and that one day it would fail
again and I would just die.

944
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,920
And that's okay with me because
we're all gonna die someday,

945
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,464
and none of us know when
it's gonna be, right?

946
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,635
But when I fly, which is a lot,

947
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,053
I like to look out the
window instead of

948
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,721
at the back of the
seat in front of me

949
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,471
or a folding tray table, because
one day might be today.

950
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,647
Why do you like the aisle?

951
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,312
Dick.

952
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:58,612
Wait a second.

953
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,744
Here.

954
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,866
Let me pour you a real drink.

955
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,380
Thanks.

956
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,045
I'm sorry.

957
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,933
I hate flying.

958
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,803
Really?

959
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,187
I always kind of
liked it, you know?

960
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,773
Six hours in the same spot,
nobody can get to you.

961
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,359
Nothing to do but just
be present, you know?

962
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,233
You have no control.

963
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,824
Control is an illusion.
There is no control.

964
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,906
Over anything.

965
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,703
You need to listen to this.

966
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,627
Where a federal bomb squad and
investigators are searching

967
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,338
a car that allegedly
belongs to Bill Marks.

968
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:58,467
Sources tell us that Marks parked
his car here at the airport today

969
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,303
before boarding British
Aqualantic Flight 10,

970
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,889
the way he had boarded
so many flights before,

971
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,224
in the guise of an
everyday passenger,

972
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,643
but carrying a mandate

973
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:10,479
from the United States
Department of Homeland Security.

974
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,731
His job, to protect the flight.

975
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,568
And he was also, as always,
carrying a concealed handgun.

976
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:20,322
Well, we know this is the hijacker's
phone. Can it tell us anything?

977
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,241
It's password protected.
I can't get in.

978
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,444
Did you try guessing?

979
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,880
This is a transatlantic flight
from New York to London,

980
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,299
the airline now confirming this is,

981
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,049
in fact, a hijacking in progress.

982
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,392
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything, I swear to God.

983
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:51,016
I just was messing around with it.
I didn't do anything.

984
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,453
Open every bag in this cabin.

985
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,957
And the horrific twist
is that the hijacker

986
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,792
is now believed to be
the one person who

987
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,627
was authorized to carry
a gun onto the plane.

988
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,880
You're looking for a package.
You'll know if you find it.

989
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,958
- Every bag. Go! Now!
- Okay.

990
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,467
Marenick.

991
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,010
- Marks?
- Order this plane down to 8,000 feet.

992
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,345
Marks, listen to me.

993
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,972
I have reason to believe
there's a bomb on the plane.

994
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,099
- Agent Marks, just listen to me.
- We need to drop altitude now.

995
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,143
A bomb at this height would
tear this plane apart.

996
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,228
and questions already
swirling around

997
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,230
Bill Marks and his state of mind

998
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,690
as he boarded the flight...

999
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:39,151
Bill, when you send
me a text and you say

1000
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,361
that you're out of options, you and
I both know that's not the case.

1001
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,196
Who else received that message?

1002
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,948
Clearly, we got it here at TSA.

1003
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,908
We're getting calls from
the FBI, the White House,

1004
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,493
and now the press is involved.

1005
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,955
You have our attention. There's no
need to take this any further, Bill.

1006
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:55,584
No one else has to die. I know it feels
like no one is listening, but I am.

1007
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,752
We'll work it out together.

1008
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,295
Marenick, you're not getting this!

1009
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,922
Bill, listen to me.
Let's talk this through.

1010
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,716
You're talking to me
like I'm a terrorist.

1011
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:03,842
You know how this works.

1012
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,511
If you try to bring that plane any
lower into civilian airspace,

1013
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,013
you will be shot down.

1014
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,681
You're a threat to ground, Bill.

1015
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,224
Just wait for your
money and sit tight.

1016
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:15,146
A stark picture of a man in a
dangerous psychological state.

1017
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,566
Bill, stay with me. I need
you to cooperate with us...

1018
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,233
What now?

1019
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,778
Officials say he was originally
from Northern Ireland.

1020
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,738
He became a decorated New York City

1021
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,698
police officer with a young family.

1022
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,576
He became distraught when his
8-year-old daughter, Olivia,

1023
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,286
passed away from cancer.

1024
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,164
Over the next decade, sources
say he became withdrawn,

1025
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,333
got divorced in 2003.

1026
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:39,037
Suspended and later
fired from the NYPD,

1027
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,087
it was then, in the summer of 2003,

1028
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:44,591
that he transferred to the
Federal Air Marshal Service.

1029
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,593
And there, his
colleagues and neighbors

1030
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,304
saying he's a quiet man who
kept mostly to himself.

1031
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,598
This is a costly program, as well.

1032
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,392
There's no question. This is what
happens when you put an unstable,

1033
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,102
angry man in a position of power.

1034
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,729
This guy wasn't even
born in the U.S.

1035
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,314
He could be IRA, for all we know.

1036
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,398
Thank you.

1037
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,610
Since 9/11, we've put 4,000
air marshals in the sky.

1038
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,153
Where do these people come from?

1039
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,780
I've seen these guys myself.

1040
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,907
They walk right past
the security line

1041
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,992
and they're barely qualified
to carry a badge.

1042
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,994
Walked right past security.

1043
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:15,205
There's controversy around the
air marshal program already.

1044
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,957
Is this the final blow?

1045
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:17,002
We give these people
absolute power in the sky.

1046
01:12:17,003 --> 01:12:19,793
We give these people
absolute power in the sky.

1047
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:21,586
We give them guns and
we put them on planes,

1048
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:25,837
and we're surprised when we have
incidences of drug smuggling.

1049
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,209
Oh, God.

1050
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,845
Now!

1051
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,139
Go, go, go!

1052
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,273
Grab him! Grab him! Get the gun!

1053
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,069
- Help me, man!
- Wait!

1054
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,817
Hey, stop it!

1055
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,823
Stop it!
No, no, no, no.

1056
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,116
Stay down!

1057
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,671
- Take him down! Kick his ass!
- Somebody stop him.

1058
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,215
Stop it!

1059
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,710
Oh, my God!

1060
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,550
Stop!

1061
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,723
Help me, man!

1062
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:58,176
Let go of him!

1063
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,852
Stop!

1064
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,363
Get him to the ground!
Hold him steady!

1065
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,405
Get his legs!

1066
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,823
Hold him, God damn it!

1067
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,617
- Grab his legs!
- Listen to me!

1068
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,701
- Listen to me!
- Shut up!

1069
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,162
Listen to me, please!
Please, go into the bathroom!

1070
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,455
- Pin him down!
- In the bathroom!

1071
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,248
- You're done, Marshal!
- There's a dead body!

1072
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:23,375
Shut the hell up! Shut up!

1073
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:24,501
There's a dead body
and a briefcase!

1074
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:25,835
In the briefcase
you'll find a bomb!

1075
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,253
Bullshit, you're lying!

1076
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:28,797
There is a bomb on this plane.

1077
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,214
Believe me, please!

1078
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,345
Get off of him.

1079
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,220
I said get off of him! Get off him!

1080
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,681
Do it now. Get back, back!

1081
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,353
Back away, all of you.

1082
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,395
You don't know what you're
doing with that gun.

1083
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,770
Come on. What is he doing?

1084
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,068
Bowen, give me the gun.

1085
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,903
- Tom, please.
- No, stay where you are.

1086
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:55,278
I'm NYPD, we got it covered!
Put it down!

1087
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,777
Is there a bomb on this plane?

1088
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,252
I want you to tell me what
the hell is going on.

1089
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,626
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax!

1090
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,508
A passenger on board
this flight has

1091
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,258
threatened to kill
someone every 20 minutes

1092
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:19,966
unless they're paid $150 million.

1093
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,386
And now, three people are dead.

1094
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:27,147
The bomb will explode in
less than half an hour.

1095
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,143
Now, they want you to believe
that I'm responsible.

1096
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,612
Everything you've heard
about me is true.

1097
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,818
I've lost my family, my job.
I'm an alcoholic.

1098
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,705
My daughter was diagnosed with
acute leukemia at the age of five,

1099
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:48,126
and I spent my days at work
instead of being at home,

1100
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:52,377
looking after her, because I was
afraid of watching her die!

1101
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,300
I'm not a good father.
I'm not a good man.

1102
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,934
I'm not hijacking this plane.

1103
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,061
I'm trying to save it!

1104
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:11,730
And I will save it!
If you work with me.

1105
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,828
You're NYPD. So was I,

1106
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,331
and you look as if you were
a better officer than I was.

1107
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,205
Cut him loose. Nancy.

1108
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:41,638
We need to start moving all
the luggage towards the back.

1109
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:42,889
And move the women and children,

1110
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,610
move them up to the
front of the plane.

1111
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,226
That's your plan?

1112
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,770
My job is to prepare for the
worst possible outcome.

1113
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,605
Well, my job is to prevent it.

1114
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,559
Women and children, no exceptions.
Men move up in coach.

1115
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:57,904
What the hell are you thinking?

1116
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,198
There's a plan of
action that exists

1117
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,618
called the Least Resistant
Bomb Location Protocol.

1118
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,703
You place the bomb
against the rear door

1119
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,781
and stack anything and
everything against it.

1120
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:12,127
Every bag, blanket, every pillow.
Nullify it as best you can.

1121
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,921
At this height a bomb would
tear this plane apart,

1122
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:19,384
but we descend to 8,000
feet, pressure equalizes,

1123
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,178
and then we have a chance.

1124
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,889
So you're just gonna
let the bomb go off?

1125
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,642
Of course not, I'm gonna stop it.

1126
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,517
But if I can't, I'd rather
be prepared, wouldn't you?

1127
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,604
The man who brought this bomb
on the plane may try something.

1128
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,485
Can I trust you to stop him?

1129
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,986
You're damn straight you can.

1130
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:48,622
Hey, Reilly, sorry about the nose.

1131
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,792
It was never my best feature.

1132
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,879
Can't you get them to wire the money?
Just try something?

1133
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,297
This was never about the money.

1134
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,966
Then what's it about?

1135
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,962
I'm not sure. They used
an account in my name.

1136
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,513
They want an air marshal
to take down a plane

1137
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,099
with 150 people on board,

1138
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,053
and they want the whole
world to see it.

1139
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:14,397
I was never supposed
to find that bomb.

1140
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,691
Look.

1141
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,328
That's not good.

1142
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:30,247
Do you know what that means?

1143
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:37,003
Aqualantic Flight 10, this
is Royal Air Force 114,

1144
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:39,672
call sign Jackrabbit. How copy?

1145
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:41,549
Copy, Jackrabbit.

1146
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,260
We will be your escorts to
the designated landing zone.

1147
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,137
Do not deviate from
your current course

1148
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,972
or altitude without authorization.

1149
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,346
- Do you copy?
- Copy.

1150
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,886
Kyle.

1151
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:55,480
- Kyle.
- Yes, Marks?

1152
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,522
We have a new situation.

1153
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,441
Yeah, no shit.

1154
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,818
I need you to drop the
plane to 8,000 feet.

1155
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,196
Get to the lowest pressure
deferential you can.

1156
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:04,990
One PSI, 1.5 at most.

1157
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,408
Wait, Bill, that's
explosives protocol.

1158
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:11,614
Yes, we have 16
minutes, give or take.

1159
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,707
You know we have company, right?

1160
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,209
Two typhoons are
flanking me right now.

1161
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,169
They're watching, and
you want me to...

1162
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,838
Kyle, we need to drop altitude now.

1163
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:24,259
Look, I have orders, Marks. Any
suspicious activity and they...

1164
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,677
Rice!

1165
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:29,180
There is a bomb on this plane. We
have to descend to 8,000 feet.

1166
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:32,892
All right, give me 10 minutes.
If we drop now, I lose speed.

1167
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:35,728
Ten minutes at this altitude,
maybe I can get us close enough,

1168
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,480
close enough to land in Iceland.

1169
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,183
Ten minutes. Thanks.

1170
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:13,057
It's an RDX explosive. Very
professional. Maybe military.

1171
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,259
Is that blow?

1172
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,930
Are you positive it
can't be disarmed?

1173
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:20,315
This is a calibrated
pressure trigger.

1174
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:23,067
The only way to disarm a bomb
is to remove the trigger.

1175
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:27,739
But remove the trigger, the pressure
releases, the bomb goes off.

1176
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,907
- Well, can't we just dump it?
- Same principle in reverse.

1177
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:31,826
The low pressure outside the plane

1178
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,619
won't hold the trigger.
You try to dump it...

1179
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,704
The bomb goes off.

1180
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,914
- Isn't there like a wire you can cut?
- No.

1181
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,499
So, if this guy doesn't
get his money,

1182
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,043
he's gonna kill himself
and everyone aboard?

1183
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,669
I can't believe this.
This is crazy.

1184
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,629
- Why aren't we looking for this guy?
- We're out of time.

1185
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,340
That's a bullshit answer,
Marshal, you know it.

1186
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,549
Take it easy.

1187
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,177
There's 150 passengers and crew.
It could be anyone.

1188
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,929
Let's find him! Let's pay
him, let's do something.

1189
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,974
It's not about the money,
and even if I find him...

1190
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,642
I don't think he ever intended
to get off this plane.

1191
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,147
My God, we're all gonna die.

1192
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,526
No!

1193
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:10,448
We gotta place the bomb here. Stack
all available luggage over it.

1194
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,116
And direct the explosion outward.

1195
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:15,535
At 8,000 feet, the pressure
will equalize. Then we land.

1196
01:21:15,536 --> 01:21:18,206
- With a hole in the fuselage?
- And this has worked before?

1197
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,000
It's never been tried before.

1198
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,919
- That you know of.
- You're not being helpful, Doctor.

1199
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,128
We're so screwed.

1200
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,296
It could work! We've got to try!

1201
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:28,546
Come on! Grab every able hand!
Let's get this done!

1202
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:33,264
Marshal, if they're setting
this thing off, no matter what,

1203
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,050
what are they waiting for?

1204
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,394
Just grab what you
can, go to the back.

1205
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,812
All right, you guys form a chain,

1206
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,516
send those bags back
as fast as you can.

1207
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:49,147
Please remove all luggage
from the overhead bins.

1208
01:21:56,954 --> 01:22:00,704
Kyle, how close are we?
We need to descend, now!

1209
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,618
No, give me three minutes.

1210
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,294
Three minutes, okay.

1211
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:08,881
Look at your watch. Three minutes
from now, not a second longer.

1212
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:11,961
No matter what happens,
drop down 8,000 feet.

1213
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,469
Okay.

1214
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,760
- Take this.
- Lighter luggage up front.

1215
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:18,808
Keep piling please. Bring
the heavier luggage down.

1216
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,056
Keep them going.

1217
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,396
Sir, keep that with
you, I just need...

1218
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:24,598
Your nose.

1219
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,437
Yeah, it's bleeding, thanks.

1220
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,317
You have a displaced fracture.

1221
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:31,279
Look, it's a broken nose, it's
normal, I don't need you to fix it.

1222
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,029
Look, I'm going to set your nose.

1223
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:35,825
Here, hold this.

1224
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:36,951
Just make it quick, all right?

1225
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,369
Apply some pressure.

1226
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,079
Okay.

1227
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,620
On three. One...

1228
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,926
Sweetheart, you've got to come out.

1229
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:56,387
It's all right, I'll hold your hand.
But it's not safe.

1230
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,972
- Gwen, what's going on?
- Please.

1231
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,348
We need to hurry.

1232
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:03,060
Sorry. I'm sorry, I need your help.
She won't come out.

1233
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,265
What's wrong? Are you scared?

1234
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,146
I wanna see my daddy.

1235
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,771
I know you do, sweetheart.
I know you do.

1236
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:16,113
You know, I was a daddy once to
a little girl just like you,

1237
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,994
and when she was scared,
you know what she'd do?

1238
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,122
She had a magic ribbon,
very powerful.

1239
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,577
It'll protect you,
just like your daddy.

1240
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,087
You wanna see it?
I have it in my pocket.

1241
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:33,382
I carry it all the time.
Here it is. Here.

1242
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:36,511
You wrap it around your
hand, just like that.

1243
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,806
That's it, hold on to it now.

1244
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,434
Are you bribing me?

1245
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,354
Yes, I am.

1246
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:52,401
This is my friend, Jen.
She's gonna look after you.

1247
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:53,861
- Jen, this is Becca.
- Hey.

1248
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,656
Don't worry, you'll see your
father soon. I promise.

1249
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,826
Can I have the window seat?

1250
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:04,827
You mean this old seat?
Mm-hm.

1251
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,630
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
about to begin our descent.

1252
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,217
I need you to return to your
seats and fasten your seatbelts.

1253
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,803
Please stay calm. Everyone,
please get back to your seats.

1254
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:21,973
Yeah?

1255
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,599
Marks, we transferred the money,

1256
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,184
150 million US into your account.

1257
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,311
It's too late for the money.
Whatever he's doing...

1258
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,772
You can stop now, Marks.
You have your money.

1259
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:30,940
The jets will escort you in.

1260
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:32,817
I have to bring this plane
down to 8,000 feet.

1261
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,152
You will not descend
into civilian airspace.

1262
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,781
You think he wants the money?
You think that will stop him?

1263
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:41,033
If you transferred
the money, prove it.

1264
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:44,787
You want proof? Here's your proof,
$150 million was transferred

1265
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:51,168
to account CH-1000-23000-A-10982.

1266
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:54,839
Confirmation code R48940.

1267
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,051
We'll escort you into
a military air field,

1268
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,679
you will not be arrested,
no questions will be asked.

1269
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,974
There is a bomb on this plane.
It isn't mine. It will go off!

1270
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:07,852
- And we have to prepare...
- You're in command of a hijacked vessel

1271
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,520
and you will not dive that
plane into civilian airspace.

1272
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,605
I will!

1273
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,356
Then, Marks, God damn it,
we will shoot you down!

1274
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,860
Someday, they'll fish this plane's
black box out of the Atlantic Ocean,

1275
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,862
and the world will know these
people could have been saved.

1276
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,447
The world already
knows what's going on

1277
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:20,906
in that plane, Bill.
You are hijacking it.

1278
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:22,450
- That's what you're telling them.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1279
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,201
That's what your hostages
are telling them.

1280
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:27,413
That video is playing on every major
news network on repeat, Bill.

1281
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,333
- What video?
- One of your hostages uploaded a video.

1282
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:32,835
You're taking a man, dragging
him around at gunpoint,

1283
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,837
stumbling over
terrified passengers.

1284
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,381
How do you expect us to believe
anything that you're saying

1285
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,467
when you clearly are
abusing those hostages?

1286
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,218
We've seen everything
we need to know.

1287
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,092
But we're trying to negotiate...

1288
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,395
Your phone, now! The phone!

1289
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,439
Show me the video that
you uploaded! Come on!

1290
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,859
I apologize for my son.

1291
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,823
Humor me. Look!

1292
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:08,621
- Look.
- I don't see him.

1293
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:09,869
Come on, look.

1294
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,709
- Right there.
- Where?

1295
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,662
Glasses.
Come on, move.

1296
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,423
God damn it!

1297
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,126
You. Look...

1298
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,635
God damn it!

1299
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,949
Stay where you are.

1300
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,038
Bill, don't test me!

1301
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:56,495
Bill.

1302
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:58,747
Reilly, drop!

1303
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,258
Reilly, get down!

1304
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:04,336
You gave me an unloaded weapon?

1305
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:06,088
Overhead bin, 4B!

1306
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,965
Everybody, down! Stay down!

1307
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,808
- Hey, get out of there, move!
- What?

1308
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,689
Hey, man!

1309
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:24,527
You looking for this?

1310
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:27,154
Give me that.

1311
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,785
What are you doing?

1312
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,175
- Get back!
- Okay, okay.

1313
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:47,097
Jackrabbit, I have shots fired outside
this cockpit, need to descend.

1314
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:51,175
That's a negative, Flight 10, do not deviate
from your current course or altitude.

1315
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:56,055
Turn around.

1316
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:57,772
I need all of you to put your hands

1317
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,270
on the seat-back in front of you.

1318
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:00,942
Do it now!

1319
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,353
- Move.
- Don't test me.

1320
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,067
Step back!

1321
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,864
Put your hands up!

1322
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,073
Sit!

1323
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,867
Sit, sit!

1324
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:14,288
He was supposed to be in
the seat next to mine.

1325
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,207
Yeah. He was close enough.

1326
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:21,585
Listen, whatever I've done to
you, whatever it is, I'm sorry.

1327
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,373
Stay down!

1328
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,800
Bill, I'm not mad at you.

1329
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,756
You're my hero.

1330
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,679
People everywhere are gonna
remember the name Bill Marks.

1331
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,807
An alcoholic, self-destructive,

1332
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,892
suicidal man with a gun
and a federal badge

1333
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,018
who changed everything.

1334
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,937
What do you think doing
this is gonna change?

1335
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:40,189
Two minutes outside
the window. Suit up.

1336
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,066
Every one of these people
boarded this plane

1337
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,859
believing their country
would protect them.

1338
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,437
That you would protect them.

1339
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,241
Everyone!

1340
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,785
We're gonna be okay!

1341
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,824
There's an air marshal on board.

1342
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,703
Do you have any idea
how easy this was?

1343
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,251
You're right, I failed.
You've made your point.

1344
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,795
No, Bill, you failed miserably!

1345
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:07,547
Three thousand people died
that day, including my father!

1346
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,967
So I joined up 'cause I wanted to
go fight the cowards that did it.

1347
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:14,348
But I just ended up fighting in a
war that I still don't understand

1348
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,223
and came home to a country
where nothing had changed.

1349
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,100
Until now.

1350
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:22,311
Security is this
country's biggest lie.

1351
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:27,146
In our homes, in our cities,
in our planes, no one's safe,

1352
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,986
and one day somebody worse than
me is gonna expose that lie,

1353
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:32,700
and the last thing our
children will see

1354
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,778
is our failure as it destroys them.

1355
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:39,456
You, Bill, you are that lie!

1356
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,166
You should just have
handed out pamphlets.

1357
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,914
It would have been a lot easier.

1358
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:48,799
You can't change the
world with words, Bill,

1359
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,010
unless you write those words in
the evening news with blood.

1360
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:52,136
We gotta go.

1361
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,681
You're military. These are the
people you fought to protect.

1362
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:59,018
I swore to protect my country,
and that's what I'm doing.

1363
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:00,811
- You believe that?
- I do.

1364
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,606
I also believe we'll be
$150 million richer.

1365
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,150
You'll never get that money.
It's in an account in my name.

1366
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,103
It's in a trust in your name.

1367
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,155
I die, the money moves.

1368
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:14,992
To 100 accounts, 27 countries, each
of those into 100 other accounts.

1369
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,202
When do you think
you're gonna jump?

1370
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:19,330
35,000 feet? You'll be
dead in four seconds.

1371
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:21,909
We'll jump when the pilot
follows explosive protocol

1372
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,211
and drops us down to 8,000 feet.

1373
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,880
Anything you think of, we've
thought of a thousand times.

1374
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,673
They've been instructed to shoot
us down if we try to descend.

1375
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,175
That's bullshit!

1376
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,218
They're not gonna kill
all these people.

1377
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:37,344
This is a hijacked flight. We're
a classified threat to ground.

1378
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:41,888
If you don't disarm that bomb, everyone
on board will die, including you.

1379
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:43,554
Did you think of that?

1380
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,190
- Look, I'm prepared to die.
- We're not gonna die.

1381
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,943
Say again, Jackrabbit.
I need to descend.

1382
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:50,316
That's a negative, Flight 10.

1383
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,280
I'm gonna stick with the plan.
We descend, we jump.

1384
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,823
The plane goes down,
we have enough money.

1385
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:56,200
We can do whatever we want.

1386
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,655
Think about it, Tommy. We can
disappear and never come back.

1387
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,958
You hear me? Never be found, ever.
Mission accomplished, right?

1388
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,377
But right now we need to get
the hell off this plane.

1389
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:10,253
Zack, you and I both know we were
never getting off this plane.

1390
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,967
Zack, whatever your name
is, you don't have to die.

1391
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,760
If you won't save these
people, save yourself.

1392
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,767
Disarm the bomb.

1393
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,145
Come on, do it.

1394
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,497
He was a martyr,
like you and me, Bill.

1395
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:46,917
Real heroes don't need to be
remembered or recognized.

1396
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,961
Real heroes do
whatever's necessary.

1397
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:50,914
I guess I wouldn't understand.

1398
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,754
- Fuck it!
- I guess you wouldn't.

1399
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:18,649
No!

1400
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,794
20,000! Come on, you wanker!

1401
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,731
8,000 feet! Come on, come on!

1402
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,401
Bill!

1403
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:18,293
8,000!

1404
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,658
- AQ 10, climb back up to 25,000 feet!
- There's a bomb on board!

1405
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,379
I need to get this
plane on the ground.

1406
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,997
Nancy, move, move!
Everybody down, heads down!

1407
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,378
Hey. Bill!

1408
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:56,081
I'm getting off this plane!

1409
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:58,924
Am I in your way, asshole?

1410
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,905
Get down!

1411
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:24,279
Do it quick! Heads down!

1412
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:32,204
Get down!

1413
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:44,804
Come on, Kyle! You can do this!
You can do this, come on.

1414
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,936
Severe damage to your fuselage.

1415
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,514
Are you able to maintain control?

1416
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,438
Shit!

1417
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,945
Fuel dump in progress.

1418
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,501
- Copy that, Flight 10.
- Come on, damn it!

1419
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,751
A little longer, come on!

1420
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,598
Oh, God!

1421
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:38,641
Get the belt! Get the belt!

1422
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:44,359
- Hang on!
- Bill, help me!

1423
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,365
Becca, I have you!

1424
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:49,031
Hang onto me! Hang onto me!

1425
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:08,762
You okay? Are you okay?

1426
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,890
- Door is disarmed.
- Release your seatbelts!

1427
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,855
- Take her. Everybody.
- Come on with me.

1428
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:21,316
Undo your seatbelt!
Move to the front, quickly.

1429
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:23,895
Leave everything. Come
this way, up to the front.

1430
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,481
One at a time, please.

1431
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,404
Leave everything.

1432
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:32,869
Leave everything.

1433
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,117
Up to the front.

1434
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:36,198
Leave everything.

1435
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:16,531
All passengers and
crew accounted for.

1436
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,832
And you, are you all right?

1437
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:20,911
That was a hell of a landing.

1438
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,384
Less than one hour ago,
British Aqualantic Flight 10

1439
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:33,135
made an emergency landing after
a bomb exploded mid-air.

1440
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:37,768
This following an attempted hijacking,
yet in an unbelievable twist,

1441
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:40,854
the suspected hijacker, U.S.
Air Marshal Bill Marks,

1442
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,647
turned out to be the hero.

1443
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:46,068
It was Marks who confronted
and killed the hijackers,

1444
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:48,271
saving the lives...

1445
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:51,031
- Yeah?
- It's Marenick.

1446
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,158
It's my turn to break
protocol, Agent Marks.

1447
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:55,494
I'm calling from my personal line

1448
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,954
and I'll deny this
conversation ever took place.

1449
01:37:57,955 --> 01:38:02,877
Listen, Bill, what you did on that
plane, what you were up against,

1450
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:05,880
I want you to know I
was wrong about you.

1451
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,550
And you'll have my full support.

1452
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,545
Appreciate that.

1453
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:15,009
And, Bill,

1454
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,178
we're gonna need that money back.

1455
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,478
What money?

1456
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:23,769
Take care, Agent Marks.

1457
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:39,948
Marshal!

1458
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,709
Reilly, you son of a gun.

1459
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:46,503
Next time, give me a loaded weapon.

1460
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,377
Next time, don't get shot.

1461
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:50,045
Deal.

1462
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,949
I'm gonna give you
back your ribbon.

1463
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:02,519
I don't need it anymore.

1464
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:06,065
That-a-girl.

1465
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,560
It's your dad.

1466
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,147
Daddy.

1467
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,999
- Hey, I was looking for you!
- Hey.

1468
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:31,506
- Do you know where we are?
- Iceland.

1469
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:34,092
Ah! Well, never been to Iceland.

1470
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:37,888
I mean, I've seen it, few times
from plane windows, but...

1471
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:39,306
Thank you.

1472
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,266
For what?

1473
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:44,596
You stood by me, even
after all that happened.

1474
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:46,563
Why?

1475
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:48,107
You're a good man.

1476
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:51,102
I bet your daughter would
have been proud of you.

1477
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,733
Thanks, ma'am.

1478
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:01,578
So...

1479
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:02,780
Mm-hm.

1480
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:04,956
Where you headed?

1481
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,999
Depends.
