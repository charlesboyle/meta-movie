Come on, do not put it like that . you have
to get stronger.

129
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:45,328
Do you charge a life without
some pride .

130
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,329
So , why do not you give us
a good smile .

131
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,330
Go start the car .

132
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:26,331
- No way , I want to see them burn.
- No shit , go walk.

133
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:38,332
You're very lucky , man.

134
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:45,333
Look, I could not say goodbye to my brother
before you head partieras .

135
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,334
I'll let it lay .

136
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:50,335
You look like a good guy.

137
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:55,336
I'll do you a favor .
I can not stand me .

138
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:01,337
I'll put more gas in it ...

139
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:04,338
and hopefully will burn faster.

140
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,339
Good is cold ...

141
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,340

00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:48,341
How do you feel?

Do not you're gonna do any good
keep looking for information here .

144
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,343
Yeah, well . Anyone know anything .

145
00:15:56,344 --> 00:16:01,344
Maybe so ... but with 6 years you've
in this know that all you do is blind ,

146
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:03,345
for fear of ending up with a knife
in the belly.

147
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:06,346
- So, we look no further.
- What do you got?

148
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:10,347
Nothing ... nobody talks .

149
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:15,348
One neighbor said he heard a commotion
around 11pm . He thought it was the TV .

150
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,349
and called for the cable guy
I saw him .

151
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,350
He saw a truck leaving VMW
at full speed.

152
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:28,351
There are some things that make us think ...
which are the same types that your dad stopped.

153
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:31,352
Whoever they are , the
People are scared Jimmy .

154
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:33,353
Were they alive?

155
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:37,354

156
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:39,355
Do burned alive ?

157
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:45,356
Postmortem examinations
concluded yes.

158
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:50,357
Have you seen Morgan since you got back ?

159
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:53,358
No. .. I have not signed the divorce papers .

160
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,359

00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:19,363
He was strong ...

165
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:23,364

167
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:27,366
You missed the funeral.

168
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:29,367
It would come later.

169
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:34,368
Email I wrote about four ....
Jimmy fivefold .

170
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:37,369
It was on a combat mission .

171
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,370
The officer said you
had been arrested and detained .

172
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,371
What happened?

173
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:54,372
You know I can not tell Morgan.

174
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,373
Jimmy can think so .

175
00:18:56,374 --> 00:19:00,374
Especially when I had to fix
and cover yourself, your parents funeral .

176
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,375
Wait!

177
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:11,376
Sorry.

178
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:14,377
You do not have to be alone .

179
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:18,378
Spend some time around the house . Yeah?

180
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:41,379

- Fuck you .

181
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,380
- Wooow ... who the hell is this ?
- Okay. Just want some .

182
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:52,381
I heard that your product is good.

183
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:54,382
Take him to see Caleb
business hours.

184
00:19:54,383 --> 00:19:56,383
It's something unexpected.

185
00:19:57,384 --> 00:19:58,384
We have a party.

186
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:10,385
Where is the cash?

187
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,386
These are 400. What the fuck !
I said 500.

188
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,387
Your people told us 400.
Only we have over 400 .

189
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:29,388
We can carry 4 - inches.
I said it would take half an ounce .

190
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:34,389
I tell you this : You give me 400, and let me
see your wife 's breasts .

191
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,390
- No , man. Look, write 4 lines and that's it .
- No deal .

192
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:45,391
- Baby, better come on.

193
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,392
Baby, we need this.

194
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:52,393
I do not ask much . single
for quick look.

195
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:54,394
Do not even have support.

196
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,395
This guy is sick.

197
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,396
Think I'll give
100 pounds of my market ...

198
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:09,397

your girlfriend ?

199
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:13,398
Look, here we go .
Give me the money .

200
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:14,399
You do not have where.

201
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
You are crazy .

202
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:26,401
You'll take your product

203
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:30,402
No , let him ... !

204
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,403
Take off your blouse.

205
00:21:37,404 --> 00:21:40,404
They'll stop when you start
to blow me .

206
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:46,405
-Hey let him ! I will.
- Piece of shit.

207
00:21:55,406 --> 00:21:57,406
I have to record this.

208
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:00,407
Wow , wow . What the fuck !

209
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:08,408
I told you ... you - me - the - will suck .
Do it right or you throw out the window.

210
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:09,409
And you have nothing .

211
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,410
Mr Evans ? ?

212
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:30,411
What the hell do you want?

213
00:22:30,412 --> 00:22:33,412
Mr Evans. We have reports of
riots here today .

214
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:34,413
So what?

215
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:37,414
-Mr Evans, you ? Been here all night?
Yes

216
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:40,415
We believe that a man was assaulted
in this place. Mr Ryan Scott.

217
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,416
Does not sound .

218
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:44,417
Can we move on ?

219
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,418
Go to hell out of here!

220
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,419
Mr Evans. The man came to
hospital badly beaten

221
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,420
So what? It has nothing to
do with me.

222
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:55,421
So why not pick up their
shit and make off my property .

223
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:07,422
Do not miss honey.
Come back anytime.

224
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:12,123
- What was that ?
- You heard .

225
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:18,124
What world do you think would interest me
for a piece of shit like you ?

226
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,125
Hey , come on.

227
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:24,126
Okay boss. Watch it.
Keep him on a short leash .

228
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:28,127
Hey , Jenny. Wait.

229
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:34,128
'You can not let it affect you .
'You know he did. Will you let go ?

230
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:37,129
You ever felt uncomfortable about 5 minutes.

231
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,130
Want to make a difference?
Control yourself .

232
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:51,131
I'll be in the car.

233
00:25:03,132 --> 00:25:08,132
The BMW is a Warren Evans and
was seen on South Avenue.

234
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,133
Are you sure it's him?

235
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:16,134
Warren Evans had a
younger brother Joshua .

236
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:22,135
Joshua Evans died accidentally
two weeks ago during a robbery.

237
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:24,136
He bled to death.

238
00:25:26,137 --> 00:25:28,137
For your father .

239
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:51,138
What the fuck !

240
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,139
What the fuck ! Huh?

241
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,140
What the fuck chocándome well ?
Fucking idiot .

242
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:04,141
Do not you mean? I'm
speaking friend.

243
00:27:05,142 --> 00:27:07,142
Look moron !
What the fuck !

244
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:11,143
What the fuck friend!
Are you crazy ?

245
00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:13,144
What the fuck are you doing?

246
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:17,145
You know who I am?

247
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:26,146
I have tied . If not
well , I would have opened the head.

248
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:31,147
I'll ask again . If you
I have to ask twice

249
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:34,148
I will cut off your left ear.
If I ask you again ...

250
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:37,149
I will cut off his right ear.

251
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,150
Are you clear? It is very
very simple ... okay?

252
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:42,151
Are you on my channel ?
Yeah? Good boy.

253
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:49,152
The couple in the garage.
Two weeks ago .

254
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:55,153
Fuck you asshole . It killed my
brother deserved to die .

255
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:59,154
What do you care ?

256
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:04,155
I bet you're the child.

257
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:10,156
Your mom fucking . Large back .

258
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:15,157
We put them in front, before
turn them on.

259
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:19,158
So the two burned .

260
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,159
You should have seen the
look on their faces .

261
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Was priceless.

262
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:28,161
You know what?

263
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:32,162
I'll let go.

264
00:29:33,163 --> 00:29:34,163
But will you do something for me.

265
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,164
'You're lying.
- Not lying .

266
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,166
- Really?
Yes , really.

267
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:42,167
Yeah .. I like you .

268
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:49,168
I need you to give me the
names of the other boys.

269
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:57,169
Take that ... take it. Listen,
they never will know. OK?

270
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:04,170
You give me the names and live ,
if not, well ...

271
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:11,171
Ok , I will.

272
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:20,172
There it is.
Thanks old .

273
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:28,873
About what I said earlier ...
I got carried away , it was my mistake.

274
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:30,174
Yes, yes ...

275
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:38,175
But just imagine how
feels ... be burned alive .

276
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:41,176
- What are you talking about , man?
- Imagine

277
00:30:41,177 --> 00:30:42,177
What the hell are you talking about ?

278
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:45,178
You said you'd let go.

279
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:50,179
What are you doing ? Please.
You said you'd let me go.

280
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
Let me go , man!
Please !

00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,181

282
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:00,182
Sorry, man !

288
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:15,188
Sorry, man !

289
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:18,189
You said you'd let go!

290
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,190
Let me go man! Please !

291
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:20,191
You can not sleep , huh ?

292
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:24,192
The coffee will not help . No?

293
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:28,193
The sun will rise soon.

294
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:32,194
How you been?

295
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:34,195
Yes ..

296
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:43,196
Yeah, well ... I've moved to a
best building . So it's better.

297
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:53,197
Jimmy , I really feel what happened .

298
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:59,198
Do you think that was a revenge
so did your dad?

299
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:09,199
Jimmy , promise me you will not do
anything stupid. Yeah?

300
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Can I use the bathroom?

301
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:18,201
Yes , of course.

302
00:33:20,202 --> 00:33:22,202
What's that ?

303
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:25,703
'It's nothing .
-Jeez Jimmy , you're bleeding !

304
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,204
Morgan -Ya , let it .
- No, sit down.

305
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:30,205
- Listen ...
- Need stitches . Sit .

306
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:38,206
Tell me what happened to Jimmy?

307
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:43,207
- Just a bar fight . You know .
- In Afghanistan .

308
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,208
Okay , okay ...

309
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:56,209
At the end I'll do the talking .

310
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,210
It's complicated.

311
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:05,211
Really? Someone told me
that there is so tricky.

312
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,212
Only problem generated
by someone in a situation.

313
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:17,213
Me? That makes sense.
I should have to be upset .

314
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:19,214
Clear .

315
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:29,215
I 'm not signing that.

316
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,216
No rush.

317
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,217
Well ..

318
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,218
Done.

319
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,219
Wait. Lets put
a bandage there.

320
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
There it is.

321
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:05,221
All right.

322
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:09,222
Thank you.
'Nothing .

323
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:13,223
It is usually better, but that
suffice . I hope you like the scars.

324
00:35:15,224 --> 00:35:16,224
I 'm used to.

325
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:21,225
How is your scar,
when I saved your life ?

326
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:24,226
Please , I would not
to bleed .

327
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:29,227
That was 20 miles from the hospital more
close . Anything could happen.

328
00:35:39,228 --> 00:35:40,228
Ok , then ...

329
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:44,229
Thank you.

330
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,230
Hi - Morgan.
- Hello.

331
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:48,231
- What do I bring ?
- A cappuccino.

332
00:36:51,232 --> 00:36:57,232
Mr Evans was seen yesterday in a
gym town at 9 pm .

333
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:01,233
The question is how Mr Evans
ended here . And why .

334
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:06,234
No one knows what he was doing
Mr Evans alone in his car.

335
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:12,235
- Here you go.
Thank you.

336
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:19,236
They've been putting it all day. A
Who cares , it was just a dealer.

337
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,237
An explosion was heard
moments later ...

338
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:27,238
This area is quite popular
among youth and traffickers.

339
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,239
Mr Evans was arrested 3 years ago
to organize and operate a gang

340
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:41,240
East London . He also admitted
distributing cocaine and heroin.

341
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:46,241
How do you know this Caleb?

342
00:37:46,242 --> 00:37:50,242
Out there. You know these people
waste time on introductions.

343
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:54,243
- I saw him last week.
- I hope everything goes well.

344
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:58,244
Hey , do not talk much . OK?

345
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:00,245
Let's do it .

346
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:17,246
- What's up? We came to talk business.
- Fuck you .

347
00:38:18,247 --> 00:38:19,247
Naked !

348
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:26,248
'You're dead , buddy.
- Tell me you did not.

349
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:27,249
Tell me !

350
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,250
- What are you talking about?
-You know what I mean !

351
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:32,251
I do not understand , man.

352
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:36,252
I have no fucking idea
what you're talking about.

353
00:38:38,252 --> 00:38:40,252
Have one chance
so you put the gun down .

354
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:42,253
Sal above me.

355
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,254
I will leave out
of here alive .

356
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:48,255
Anything I'm not
involved .

357
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:53,256
It 's not even loaded .

358
00:38:54,257 --> 00:38:55,257
Try me .

359
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:58,258
Arise . The two .

360
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,259
- Someone burned his car.
- With it in, buddy.

361
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:14,260
Even if it were me . Where
would take time to do that ?

362
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:16,261
It just would have gotten shot.

363
00:39:17,262 --> 00:39:21,262
- If we discover we was you ...
- Yes , I'm dead .

364
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:28,263
You have your answer , now beat it .
And you do not see in this neighborhood again.

365
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:31,264
Damned imbeciles .

366
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:45,265
I need some directions.

367
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:53,266
Did it feel good?

368
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:58,267
It is far from over .

369
00:40:59,268 --> 00:41:01,268
Jimmy gotta let it go , man.

370
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:03,269
Let it go you .

371
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:05,269
I have 4 names.
What do you have ?

372
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,270
This is then . This is
's going to be things.

373
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,271
I 'm a blind eye while
are you killing people all over London .

374
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:27,272
You know as well as I , that this
It is the only way to solve this.

375
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:29,273
What really happens if you catch one ?

376
00:41:31,274 --> 00:41:33,274
Would you take the declaration, you process ...

377
00:41:34,274 --> 00:41:39,274
while laughing at you, I spit in the face .
I get in a comfortable cell ...

378
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:42,275
resting her fucking ass
playing video games.

379
00:41:43,276 --> 00:41:49,276
This country has changed. the
protests are just hunger .

380
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:55,277
There was a time that would have bled
to maintain the union, Jack.

381
00:41:57,278 --> 00:41:59,278
But those days passed .

382
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:03,279
We have a generation of attackers
those who do not know what to do, Griff.

383
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,280
And you know as well as I do
There is nothing stopping them from doing it again.

384
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:10,281
I am .

385
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,282
Revenge never
give a close .

386
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:20,283
Revenge?

387
00:42:21,284 --> 00:42:24,284
This is not vengeance. It is necessity.

388
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:29,285
Get me an address.

389
00:42:43,286 --> 00:42:45,286
- How many?
- Two .

390
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,287
We do not know how they were Mrs.
Guilbert . You can describe them.

391
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:56,288
One had a black and white hat, the
I do not remember the other . It happened very fast.

392
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:00,289
All right.

393
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,290
Back in a moment . OK?

394
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:06,291
- Sir?
- One second.

395
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:16,292
Okay, done with it. I have
an appointment at 1 pm with the Superintendent ,

396
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,293
and do not want to lose me .
If I'm not shit.

397
00:43:18,294 --> 00:43:20,294
Assault with a deadly weapon , two
suspects like 40.

398
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:24,295
Mr Oliver tried to remove one
gun and shot him in the chest.

399
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:28,296
A Mrs Guilbert they targeted him
as he stole .

400
00:43:28,297 --> 00:43:30,297
Cruel. It seems quite work.

401
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:34,298
- Any surveillance camera ?
Yes, but nothing .

402
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:37,299
What was trying to disarm it?

403
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
I do not know . Protecting ?
your business ?

404
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:43,301
Well, what a way to
finish . No?

405
00:43:45,302 --> 00:43:47,302
- Listen agent. What's your name ?
-Griffin .

406
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:50,303
This is probably a robbery
any . Do not take it so personal.

407
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:54,304
She will bill insurance and
everyone will be happy.

408
00:43:54,305 --> 00:43:55,305
And the suspects?

409
00:43:56,306 --> 00:44:04,306
Send a team to investigate the area.
You may delay , but ... so is justice.

410
00:44:22,307 --> 00:44:24,307
It is enough for me. Thank you.

411
00:44:25,308 --> 00:44:29,808
- A little dry tonight.
- No, I am a lousy drinker .

412
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:32,309
Yeah? Define shocking.

413
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,310
Put it this way :

414
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,310
The last time I got drunk , I ended
a wet T-shirt contest .

415
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,876
- Oh , yeah?
- I won, of course.

416
00:44:44,312 --> 00:44:45,312
Course.

417
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:49,313
What kind of drunk are you?

418
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,888
I am quiet and quite let go .

419
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,315
Unlike others
I assume the effects of alcohol.

420
00:44:58,316 --> 00:45:00,316
I try to have a good time .

421
00:45:01,317 --> 00:45:03,317
And that's your analysis
my character ?

422
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:09,618
No, but realize
you are cautious , timid .

423
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:14,619
And I can recognize that you die
afraid that if you take that cup ...

424
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:20,420
That dress is going to end up on the floor of
my room. And your panties in my collection .

425
00:45:20,621 --> 00:45:22,621
I do not wear any .

426
00:45:27,222 --> 00:45:28,822
Sorry for the delay, guys.

427
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:32,823
Thirsty , baby?

428
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:38,080
Then . Where were we?

429
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:43,825
We were about 40% agreeing .
Finish the dessert and the bill.

430
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,826
That's what his lovely
wife was saying.

431
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:48,827
Yeah?

432
00:45:49,828 --> 00:45:54,828
So I like to bring .
It 's a good judge of character .

433
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:00,829
We have a deal .

434
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,830
Good move .
Good thinking.

435
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:10,831
Excuse me a moment. Yeah?

436
00:46:25,832 --> 00:46:27,832
You look good in a suit , Jimmy.

437
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,833
Though you look better with a
MP5 fucked in an armory .

438
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:33,834
I'll take that as a compliment.

439
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,100
She looks good.

440
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:40,836
Is your wife.
Drink?

441
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:46,837
I need some equipment,
if you todavías you dedicate to that.

442
00:47:10,138 --> 00:47:11,838
Hey !

443
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,839
Hanny !

444
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,840
Hi - Trojan .
- Hello.

445
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:32,841
What the fuck is that?
Excalibur ? ?

446
00:47:33,004 --> 00:47:34,842
I will not go with that.

447
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:37,843
It is lightweight , titanium. this atravieza
the door of a car

448
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:40,844
Why the hell I want to go through
the door of a car?

449
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:43,845
- That works too.
-Wow , listen ... listen .

450
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:46,846
Put that there. You're going to
get someone's eye .

451
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:48,847
Have you ever stabbed
someone?

452
00:47:52,848 --> 00:47:54,848
That's a 6OP ...

453
00:47:55,149 --> 00:47:58,849
Yes , it takes 9 bullets in the chamber .
Effective in a range of 50 meters.

454
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:00,850
The man knows his toys ...

455
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:12,851
The take .

456
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:15,152
You should get another
silencer for that.

457
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:19,853
Jimmy , you should know that I am no
in this. I did it to help but ...

458
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:21,854
I appreciate that.

459
00:48:22,855 --> 00:48:27,055
Jimmy ... see you in a
time, and you know well.

460
00:48:28,056 --> 00:48:30,056
The look in your eyes no
is good , man.

461
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:32,857
I have it under control.

462
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,859
I feel your pain , you know
it's true .

463
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:40,860
If they were my parents I would do
same . But it's crazy , man

464
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:46,861
If you intend to take on that, you
to be strong. Stronger than ever .

465
00:48:47,862 --> 00:48:49,862
You know what I mean?

466
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:53,863
Beware . Yeah?

467
00:48:57,264 --> 00:48:59,864
If you need anything , me
you say. OK?

468
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:30,865
- Hey, at Warren.
- By Warren.

469
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:37,866
Now I come . I go to the bathroom.

470
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:44,567
You're going to crack this type of search .

471
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:46,568
No old are you?

472
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:47,969
Of course not .

473
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:57,170
What we find , and when they
do. You, me and him , we're gonna fuck .

474
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:58,971
- Yes?
- Yes .

475
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:01,272
That's how it is .

476
00:50:01,273 --> 00:50:02,773
Another.

477
00:50:16,174 --> 00:50:17,774
What the hell is this?

478
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:20,775
What is your problem?

479
00:50:22,376 --> 00:50:23,776
You asked for it !

480
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:24,777
- You will die tonight.
-No! No! ...

481
00:51:30,178 --> 00:51:31,778
Or not .

482
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:34,879
It is terrible ...

483
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,880
It is the truth .

484
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:46,281
The only reason I have not
Indeed, it is because in your current

485
00:51:47,282 --> 00:51:48,882
.... and unfortunate situation.

486
00:51:51,283 --> 00:51:53,583
You leave me many options.

487
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:56,784
It could ... literally ...

488
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:01,785
put anything there
inside.

489
00:52:04,786 --> 00:52:06,286
Hello? Hello? ...

490
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:15,787
Sorry. It was a bad joke.

491
00:52:40,488 --> 00:52:42,788
Are you done ?
What's up partner ?

492
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:46,789
Stop fucking .
What the fuck are you doing?

493
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,190
Must be you.

494
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:53,191
Who the fuck ?
Where is Dany ?

495
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:55,192
Can not talk now.

496
00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:00,893
Who are you?

497
00:53:03,394 --> 00:53:05,194
You 're the guy they want.

498
00:53:06,195 --> 00:53:07,795
What is your problem?

499
00:53:09,296 --> 00:53:10,796
It deserves to be burned to death.

500
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,197
He deserves to die for what he did.

501
00:53:15,198 --> 00:53:17,198
For what they did to that cop .

502
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:19,699
That's it.

503
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,700
And what the fuck about you ?

504
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:27,701
Do you think you scare
because you talk on the phone?

505
00:53:29,202 --> 00:53:30,702
What am I scared?

506
00:53:31,703 --> 00:53:33,703
Stand in front so you see my fear.
Where are you, friend?

507
00:53:34,704 --> 00:53:36,704
We shall see face to face.

508
00:53:39,705 --> 00:53:42,705
And when I see you ...
I'll catch .

509
00:53:44,206 --> 00:53:45,706
I ...

510
00:53:46,707 --> 00:53:49,707
I'll turn bastard.

511
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,708
Where were we?

512
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:12,709
You'll love this.

513
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:18,110
This is a small
kind on the concrete.

514
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:24,711
In true sense of the word
cement is a binder.

515
00:54:25,712 --> 00:54:30,712
It gives substance , firmness and
independently thickness .

516
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,712
The materials are mixed together .

517
00:54:45,713 --> 00:54:47,113
Collected a little ...

518
00:54:51,114 --> 00:54:52,714
A term is used :

519
00:54:53,115 --> 00:54:57,115
" Opus Caementecius " ( Concrete
Roman : lime, grease, sand and water)

520
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:37,416
Wow !

521
00:55:37,817 --> 00:55:38,817
Some kids found .

522
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:43,818
Who would do that?

523
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,719
What's that?

524
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,720
Pliers of mouth , I think
that dentists use .

525
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:53,921
It seems some kind
sex toy .

526
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:01,622
It is solid.

527
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:05,623
He should have swallowed, and
eventually die suffocated .

528
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:08,824
Dried cement all
internal organs together .

529
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,825
If you hit the body with a
object , possibly break .

530
00:56:12,826 --> 00:56:13,826
Fuck!

531
00:56:14,227 --> 00:56:15,827
The coroner is on the way .

532
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:20,228
No , fuck it. me
I 'll skip that shit.

533
00:56:21,229 --> 00:56:23,629
I've been waiting for a case
decent for promotion.

534
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,230
Hold this.

535
00:56:25,831 --> 00:56:27,931
Gather testimonials and
bring some coffee.

536
00:56:28,732 --> 00:56:29,832
This will be a
morning long .

537
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:31,833
DCI - Holand
- Anything else ?

538
00:56:34,334 --> 00:56:35,834
Yes ..

539
00:56:37,235 --> 00:56:38,835
All right. Yes ..

540
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:51,236
= LEFT THREE =

541
00:57:06,237 --> 00:57:12,137
DCI Holand . Someone told us to
see something in your security camera .

542
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:13,438
It was not me , love .

543
00:57:13,939 --> 00:57:14,639
Someone called from here.

544
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,640
It was me . come
around here.

545
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:23,641
We have this from last year.

546
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:27,642
Mainly because after three
theft, units were lost without

547
00:57:27,843 --> 00:57:30,643
the security tapes .
Sure

548
00:57:31,544 --> 00:57:34,644
Very busy in a comfortable
office doing paperwork I suppose,

549
00:57:35,245 --> 00:57:37,845
processing rather than criminal
give them what they really need :

550
00:57:38,446 --> 00:57:40,846
a good kick .
- Ok .

551
00:57:41,847 --> 00:57:42,847
Debbie .

552
00:57:42,848 --> 00:57:43,648
Can I talk to Terry?

553
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,249
What?

554
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,450
- What are you doing ?
- Protecting my bar.

555
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:56,851
Do you bar? we both know
well what you are protecting.

556
00:57:57,852 --> 00:57:59,852
Are you being right on this?

557
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:04,453
You know what that's called .
And you want me to make me blind ?

558
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:07,854
They know everything .

559
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:11,555
They can fly this while
we sleep, burn the place

560
00:58:11,756 --> 00:58:14,556
us inside.
See what they can do !

561
00:58:14,957 --> 00:58:17,357
Yes , I know what Jimmy can do.

562
00:58:17,758 --> 00:58:19,358
You will deal with a lot
them.

563
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:23,359
Just go with the flow . not
you can go teach that.

564
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,360
We will look at this or what .

565
00:58:31,361 --> 00:58:32,661
There.

566
00:58:33,162 --> 00:58:34,662
What's that ?

567
00:58:42,263 --> 00:58:43,663
Jesus Christ!

568
00:58:46,664 --> 00:58:48,264
Return it to the top .

569
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:55,765
Put it from there.

570
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:57,766
I paúsalo . There.

571
00:59:04,267 --> 00:59:05,767
I got you , you bastard .

572
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:23,768
Shit !

573
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:34,369
Fuck!

574
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,170
- Mrs. Vickers ?
- Yes .

575
00:59:37,471 --> 00:59:38,871
It is about her husband, Mrs. Vickers .

576
00:59:40,272 --> 00:59:41,372
All right.

577
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:45,273
- Have you seen him in the last days ?
- No, I'm sorry.

578
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:48,774
- Have not spoken?
- No, what is this about? .

579
00:59:49,475 --> 00:59:52,475
We have reason to believe that
her husband is involved in a

580
00:59:52,876 --> 00:59:53,776
series of crimes .

581
00:59:54,377 --> 00:59:56,177
What kind of crimes?

582
00:59:56,978 --> 00:59:58,178
I'm afraid I can not tell .

583
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,579
If you see him , tell him that
call us ASAP.

584
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,180
This is the detective
charge of the investigation .

585
01:00:07,181 --> 01:00:08,181
Right.

586
01:00:08,782 --> 01:00:09,582
Thank you.

587
01:00:25,283 --> 01:00:30,283
These killings ... on the news.
That was you , right?

588
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:39,684
God , Jimmy!

589
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:43,885
Morgan, my parents executed .

590
01:00:44,486 --> 01:00:47,886
And you're doing the same.
What's that ? Justice?

591
01:00:48,387 --> 01:00:53,887
No deserve justice , deserve
live! They need punishment!

592
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:09,888
They've been there all day .

593
01:01:18,389 --> 01:01:24,889
Jimmy , when I told him
happened ... I could not believe it.

594
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,890
Do that to a couple ...
it's just ...

595
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:41,791
I just wanted to find .

596
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:53,891
What happened?

597
01:01:57,392 --> 01:02:01,592
Six Afghan soldiers
we trained , they betrayed us .

598
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:08,893
Four Taliban killed
6 our soldiers.

599
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:14,894
We should find out if they had
most of them among us.

600
01:02:15,495 --> 01:02:17,195
So they put me
work with a guy .

601
01:02:19,596 --> 01:02:21,796
I would play at any time.

602
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:25,797
And I overdid so, so ...

603
01:02:29,498 --> 01:02:31,798
They had assault weapons ...

604
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:34,899
I could not let them go.

605
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,400
One would face plucked
because ...

606
01:02:46,401 --> 01:02:47,401
I went too far ...

607
01:02:50,402 --> 01:02:51,702
And they locked me up .

608
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,803
Escaped .

609
01:02:58,204 --> 01:02:59,804
Yes.

610
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:10,805
Jimmy .

611
01:03:15,406 --> 01:03:16,806
Was there someone else?

612
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:20,807
No! ...

613
01:03:43,408 --> 01:03:45,708
This can only end badly.

614
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:51,009
What do you advise me ?

615
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:57,010
Take the car and drive to
the fuel runs out.

616
01:03:58,211 --> 01:03:59,511
You have to.

617
01:04:01,512 --> 01:04:02,712
And you come with me?

618
01:04:08,413 --> 01:04:09,713
Yes.

619
01:04:14,314 --> 01:04:15,814
I have to finish this.

620
01:05:57,215 --> 01:05:58,315
Holland .

621
01:05:59,116 --> 01:06:00,816
I think we have your man.

622
01:06:04,217 --> 01:06:08,417
Under no circumstances approach .
Just maintain eye contact.

623
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:10,818
I 'm coming. grab
helicopters.

624
01:06:10,819 --> 01:06:12,819
Yes , I want a SWAT team .

625
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,920
Yes , I know we must call
but I do it well .

626
01:06:25,221 --> 01:06:28,221
Hello friend. You bring some
identification on you?

627
01:06:30,222 --> 01:06:31,922
- What is your name?
It's him .

628
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:08,923
Put the gun down , Vickers .

629
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:17,924
Not expect to see Colonel.

630
01:07:20,225 --> 01:07:21,925
He came to take me back .

631
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:28,326
As soon as you reports,
will be best for everyone .

632
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:31,427
Well, they will have to wait .

633
01:07:32,528 --> 01:07:33,828
That's not an option James .

634
01:07:34,429 --> 01:07:36,929
You will serve this country as
soldier in the elite forces .

635
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:42,430
The group of Afghans who strove
yourself, what you want to know.

636
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:47,831
One group things
I have to do before.

637
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,232
That will bring us to
turn . Do you know ?

638
01:07:52,233 --> 01:07:54,233
What are you doing ?

639
01:07:56,234 --> 01:08:00,034
You're a good man .. and
great soldier .

640
01:08:02,035 --> 01:08:06,335
But you must finish this before
make a desatre that even I can clean .

641
01:08:08,036 --> 01:08:09,836
I'll stop when I'm dead.

642
01:08:11,437 --> 01:08:12,837
And I go out.

643
01:08:14,538 --> 01:08:15,738
So?

644
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:20,739
I've seen too much blood already .
I want a normal life.

645
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,940
What is a normal life?

646
01:08:24,341 --> 01:08:26,141
A comfortable desk job
in the Ministry ?

647
01:08:27,242 --> 01:08:31,142
How to best manage an eco car
around a house in the suburbs ?

648
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:35,843
Newspapers and sandwishes in
breakfast. With coffee.

649
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:39,844
People like you are by
on social integration.

650
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:44,245
They are here
and you here.

651
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:51,346
You have an extra , you're psychologically
superior to all those drones Street .

652
01:08:54,247 --> 01:08:55,647
Put them in a row.

653
01:08:56,648 --> 01:09:02,648
If these people knew what you
done ... to maintain their lives ...

654
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:07,349
I would kiss your feet.

655
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,650
You're a hero , James.

656
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,651
I know that if you had not locked
I had been there to defend them.

657
01:09:20,652 --> 01:09:23,352
It was very homey day
before being killed .

658
01:09:29,353 --> 01:09:30,653
Stop.

659
01:09:38,354 --> 01:09:41,654
You have 48 hours to clean
your personal Trash .

660
01:09:42,355 --> 01:09:46,655
Have just that time.
I do not want to screw up .

661
01:10:11,356 --> 01:10:12,856
Morons !

662
01:10:20,457 --> 01:10:21,857
Joe .

663
01:10:22,358 --> 01:10:23,458
What's up?

664
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:24,859
What checaste ?

665
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,560
Yes , but it was in the case.
We follow that.

666
01:10:30,361 --> 01:10:32,561
Jimmy Vickers - know , right?
- Yes .

667
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:36,562
I leaned on a mission four
years ago.

668
01:10:37,563 --> 01:10:38,863
Have they come ?

669
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:41,864
Well, we're on it . not
I will be that crazy.

670
01:10:42,565 --> 01:10:43,865
You know who killed their parents.

671
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:46,866
Never mind. I have to do
what I owe .

672
01:10:47,467 --> 01:10:48,967
You have to help me with
research .

673
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:53,568
Wait ... Did you 're covering ?

674
01:10:54,369 --> 01:10:55,869
Joe , you quee tell me what to do.

675
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:58,870
What the fuck you say !

676
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:00,871
I will degrade .

677
01:11:01,472 --> 01:11:02,872
We have it under control.

678
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:04,873
Why Holland?

679
01:11:06,374 --> 01:11:07,874
He gives a shit all .

680
01:11:08,475 --> 01:11:10,875
Just want to close the case quickly
to earn points.

681
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:14,876
Can you imagine a jerk
Superintendent as he ?

682
01:11:19,477 --> 01:11:21,877
Just keep me posted .
Please.

683
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:33,878
- Anything else ?
- Only account .

684
01:11:34,879 --> 01:11:42,879
Spencer Holland . So here is where
rests to pursue criminals.

685
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,380
I'm a little rushed. So ...

686
01:11:45,981 --> 01:11:49,581
Yes , of course. You have to solve
from the two murders .

687
01:11:51,382 --> 01:11:55,882
- What are you talking about?
Spencer - Come , everyone knows your murderer .

688
01:11:56,483 --> 01:12:00,883
"There are three," that sounds
as a vigilante if you ask me .

689
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,884
If you speak any of this ,
I will end you .

690
01:12:06,585 --> 01:12:09,785
Oh come on, do not be a jerk.
A quick interview.

691
01:12:10,286 --> 01:12:12,386
People have a right to know
what happens in the streets.

692
01:12:12,987 --> 01:12:16,487
Right to Know . Really?
You'll get away with that.

693
01:12:18,488 --> 01:12:19,988
I know you know who he is.

694
01:12:20,589 --> 01:12:21,989
How do you know that?

695
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:26,790
I did not know shit about that! Do not know
Spence lie , looks you in the face .

696
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:29,891
My publishers are going to get
fully in this.

697
01:12:30,492 --> 01:12:33,592
Look, I'll show the police
a good lie . Please say :

698
01:12:34,593 --> 01:12:40,593
"We are following the serial attacker . INN
Holland closely following the criminal "

699
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:48,594
Try the salad was
very good the last time .

700
01:12:49,295 --> 01:12:50,795
I'll take it .

01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:22,399
- No . Get lost ! Get out of here .
-Fuck you ! No puff.

705
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,200
You do nothing , bitch.

706
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:27,801
Here you are.

707
01:13:28,402 --> 01:13:31,802

717
01:15:26,312 --> 01:15:29,812
- I do not even know what you did .
Right? - No, no ...

718
01:15:30,313 --> 01:15:31,813
That's the problem .

719
01:15:33,414 --> 01:15:36,514
Morons like you are on the
life burning people alive.

720
01:15:37,515 --> 01:15:40,215
And they know the devastation
causing emotional .

721
01:15:41,216 --> 01:15:45,716
Look, I'm sorry. I did not do it!
I feel old ! Sorry ...

722
01:15:46,717 --> 01:15:48,717
Sorry , sorry.

01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:53,718
Sorry , you bastard ...

724
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:58,219
Sorry is the cost of getting
no hope for your mistakes .

725
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,420
I'll tell you who I am :

726
01:16:02,221 --> 01:16:04,521
The last face you'll see .

727
01:16:05,222 --> 01:16:07,822
No, please. I said I was sorry.

728
01:16:08,323 --> 01:16:10,823
Come on, man . Please
I do not do anything !

729
01:16:11,324 --> 01:16:13,824
Please , please! ...

730
01:16:29,225 --> 01:16:30,825
Shit !

731
01:16:32,426 --> 01:16:32,826
What are you doing ?

732
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:33,827
I say it 's going work
some homicides.

733
01:17:34,328 --> 01:17:36,228
Nothing I can not handle sr ,
get him.

734
01:17:37,229 --> 01:17:40,229
- You think it's the same person?
- Possibly .

735
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,830
- You think it's the ex-husband ?

736
01:17:44,231 --> 01:17:45,231
Without a doubt .

737
01:17:45,932 --> 01:17:48,832
How do you think I became the
Youngest Superintendent of London?

738
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:51,333
I do not wanna deal with that shit over .

739
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:56,934
In 2003 he was in New York in
missing area .

740
01:17:58,335 --> 01:18:02,335
At the time I was there , do not
Can you imagine the smell that was there.

741
01:18:02,936 --> 01:18:04,836
Which city ! In addition also
was in August.

742
01:18:08,337 --> 01:18:12,837
Listen, people are not interested
whether there is a puncher .

743
01:18:13,338 --> 01:18:15,338
Not interested in talking newspapers
violations ...

744
01:18:16,339 --> 01:18:20,339
But the kicker grows itself is a
problem . The city will begin to stink.

745
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,340
Do you understand where I'm going with this?

746
01:18:26,341 --> 01:18:28,341
What role do you play in the story?

747
01:18:29,342 --> 01:18:32,342
I am the one who cleans the shit
to keep the streets safe .

748
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:36,343
If you do you 're an idiot.

749
01:18:38,344 --> 01:18:41,344
The cleaning the streets is a
great fool .

750
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:48,345
Do not pull the boat without knowing what
first : it's your own city.

751
01:18:49,346 --> 01:18:51,746
- It would be good to be a superintendent is not it?
'Yes, sir

752
01:18:53,347 --> 01:18:58,347
Quick grab this guy. You grab and
you get off the streets and keep the media out .

753
01:19:01,348 --> 01:19:03,348
If the Commissioner finds that
this is out of control , you are

754
01:19:03,749 --> 01:19:07,249
far from here before
you know it . Do you understand ?

755
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:08,550
Yes , sir.

756
01:19:21,751 --> 01:19:23,751
- Anything else ?
- No, just coffee . Please.

757
01:19:40,752 --> 01:19:43,452
- Can I get you anything sir ?
- A tea , please.

758
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:44,953
Yes in a moment.

759
01:19:47,354 --> 01:19:50,954
- Is it cold enough . No?
- Yes .

760
01:19:54,555 --> 01:19:55,955
Have we met?

761
01:19:58,456 --> 01:20:00,356
I will need all
you got it.

762
01:20:02,357 --> 01:20:03,857
Well, that will not happen friend.

763
01:20:05,858 --> 01:20:08,858
He belongs to us
us, not you.

764
01:20:10,859 --> 01:20:15,859
I belong , if you take the law in
his hands in my city.

765
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:26,860
Let me explain something .

766
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:35,261
In September 2009 , we detected a
attempted attack on British soil

767
01:20:35,962 --> 01:20:39,562
a magnitude that would seem 11
September as the Teddy Bear Picnic .

768
01:20:40,563 --> 01:20:43,563
We made it to the man
he planned the attack.

769
01:20:46,364 --> 01:20:48,764
The Taliban fell us
up as rain .

770
01:20:49,565 --> 01:20:51,265
It was a struggle as the
has ever been .

771
01:20:52,866 --> 01:20:56,766
We could not get what
needed at that time.

772
01:20:58,367 --> 01:21:02,767
It took 10 minutes to type Vickers ,
spit to make all information.

773
01:21:04,368 --> 01:21:07,768
While we were fighting ,
30 Taliban gave everything .

774
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:12,769
After Vickers
execute the prisoner .

775
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:20,770
You realize that these people ...
not afraid of death.

776
01:21:21,471 --> 01:21:22,971
They welcome .

777
01:21:24,572 --> 01:21:25,872
So I must ask ...

778
01:21:27,473 --> 01:21:28,873
where I get the value.

779
01:21:31,874 --> 01:21:34,674
We were in danger so
we had to go there.

780
01:21:37,275 --> 01:21:38,475
There was no sign of Vickers .

781
01:21:39,676 --> 01:21:43,676
It appeared three days after
the bastion , without a scratch .

782
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:46,677
No one knows how.

783
01:21:49,278 --> 01:21:51,678
If you do not want to
are, they will not.

784
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:55,279
It ends with these types
and then ...

785
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,680
... disappear.

786
01:22:01,281 --> 01:22:04,881
Well, I'll find ,
because it's what I do .

787
01:22:06,482 --> 01:22:11,782
If you touch a finger to my boy ,
I will come so hard ...

788
01:22:14,483 --> 01:22:16,783
who painted the streets with you.

789
01:22:38,384 --> 01:22:40,784
Commissioner Shield guess.

790
01:22:43,285 --> 01:22:44,785
Superintendent Walsh.

791
01:22:45,286 --> 01:22:46,886
- Who do we see ?
-Carter .

792
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:48,887
And who would that Mr. Carter?

793
01:22:49,388 --> 01:22:50,888
It would be the Chief Carter.

794
01:23:09,389 --> 01:23:11,889
Thank you gentlemen for coming so quickly .

795
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:17,490
We apologize but the details
should go straight to the point .

796
01:23:20,491 --> 01:23:22,391
This man is the subject of
an investigation.

797
01:23:23,492 --> 01:23:26,392
 Jimmy Vickers , yes sir. It is suspected
 a group of murders.

798
01:23:26,993 --> 01:23:30,393
Under no circumstances will
taken into custody .

799
01:23:31,394 --> 01:23:32,894
Understood?

800
01:23:33,495 --> 01:23:38,895
Maybe we should meet
formalities and start again.

801
01:23:39,396 --> 01:23:42,796
I am the Commissioner Shields London.
And you are ?

802
01:23:44,397 --> 01:23:49,797
The man who makes sure you
and the rest of this exquisite country

803
01:23:50,398 --> 01:23:52,798
You are safe every second of
each day .

804
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:59,799
Although we ashamed to speak. this
individual belongs to us .

805
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,800
The directed research report
units to you and to us.

806
01:24:06,401 --> 01:24:07,801
Is that clear?

807
01:24:09,402 --> 01:24:12,802
Could you tell me who you work for ?

808
01:24:13,503 --> 01:24:19,503
You can tell who works within a
 unit , confined to infrastructure

809
01:24:19,904 --> 01:24:22,804
military, which benefits us
his character profile .

810
01:24:24,005 --> 01:24:24,985
The CSIS .

811
01:24:25,406 --> 01:24:27,906
It is a problem that does not
in the streets.

812
01:24:28,307 --> 01:24:32,607
A problem that only
we can deal with.

813
01:24:33,608 --> 01:24:36,608
And I need it back,
where it belongs.

814
01:24:58,309 --> 01:24:59,809
What caraj ... !

815
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:02,810
Open your mouth , open
 the fuck up already .

816
01:25:11,311 --> 01:25:12,811
Touch the door,
play it now .

817
01:25:15,412 --> 01:25:16,812
Who is ?

818
01:26:31,313 --> 01:26:34,813
I do not know what your fucking problem .
Who pays you ?

819
01:26:36,414 --> 01:26:37,814
The socio tripled .

820
01:26:41,415 --> 01:26:42,815
It is in that safe there.

821
01:26:45,316 --> 01:26:46,816
Take a look.

822
01:26:55,317 --> 01:26:56,817
What is the code?

823
01:26:57,318 --> 01:26:58,618
No, no no ...

824
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:01,719
Let me go , partner.

825
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:04,420
Wait, well ...

826
01:27:07,321 --> 01:27:15,421
51-6 ... 44

827
01:27:28,322 --> 01:27:28,922
Socio ...

828
01:27:33,423 --> 01:27:34,623
I want to leave now.

829
01:27:36,324 --> 01:27:37,824
What the fuck !

830
01:27:40,525 --> 01:27:43,825
Dude, what the fuck you want .

831
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:46,826
Tell me , tell me !

832
01:27:48,327 --> 01:27:49,827
What the fuck you want from me ?

833
01:27:52,328 --> 01:27:54,828
Tell me , now ... now !

834
01:27:56,429 --> 01:27:58,829
No. .. no ... no!

835
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:43,830
- Sir, I want to see something ?
- Yes, come and sit down.

836
01:28:45,331 --> 01:28:46,831
Nick , leave us alone .

837
01:28:56,332 --> 01:29:02,432
Great coincidence that the last official to have
access to the files of these men was you.

838
01:29:03,433 --> 01:29:05,433
Before their deaths, I might add.

839
01:29:14,434 --> 01:29:17,434
James Vickers , a soldier ...

840
01:29:20,435 --> 01:29:23,735
Currently serving service
in His Majesty 's forces .

841
01:29:25,436 --> 01:29:29,736
MID not mince words , we know that
 interrogations are their specialty ...

842
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:30,937
Would you believe it ?

843
01:29:32,338 --> 01:29:34,838
I want to know when
catch him.

844
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:38,839
Already finished or miss more ?

845
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,240
I need to know who's next .

846
01:29:45,341 --> 01:29:46,841
You do not need to know anything .

847
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:49,842
All you have to do is
out of the way .

848
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:51,843
I 'm not gonna get out of the way of anyone .

849
01:29:52,244 --> 01:29:55,844
I'll find the lock you and
 I will pay for everything you have done .

850
01:29:56,245 --> 01:29:58,845
The last thing I would do is leave
ud that it encloses .

851
01:30:00,346 --> 01:30:03,846
I 'll sweep , or die
the attempt.

852
01:30:04,347 --> 01:30:05,947
" Dying to " not
enough for me.

853
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:09,848
Every time you see a " vigilante"
in my streets , will have an answer .

854
01:30:10,449 --> 01:30:12,349
He does not care ud .

855
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:14,950
He does not care law.

856
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:20,451
Only interested in one thing:
Revenge .

857
01:30:21,452 --> 01:30:24,452
Will do more justice in a week
what we do in a year.

858
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,853
Do we ?

859
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:32,854
Sr Griffih , I think we can say
he stopped being a cop at the time

860
01:30:33,355 --> 01:30:34,855
that began
help his friend .

861
01:30:37,356 --> 01:30:38,856
Well, good luck finding it .

862
01:30:40,257 --> 01:30:41,857
It may take a while.

863
01:30:43,358 --> 01:30:48,858
But justice is slow
better than no justice.

864
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:15,859
"The UK could face
austerities until 2018 . "

865
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,860
Jules , the board is on top of me.

866
01:31:19,361 --> 01:31:22,561
Alec Morrison only run reports and
Manchester . Marcus there ...

867
01:31:23,162 --> 01:31:24,562
It is what it is, London is quiet .

868
01:31:25,362 --> 01:31:29,562
- And what about those crimes?
'I searched and nothing comes out.

869
01:31:30,263 --> 01:31:33,563
- Or are you late?
'I'm looking to put more substance.

870
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:39,464
Do not expect much , you are very
stop this. Try searching the news.

871
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:55,765
Justice or terrorism?
Vigilante attacks again .

872
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:02,766
Bitch .

873
01:32:13,367 --> 01:32:14,867
