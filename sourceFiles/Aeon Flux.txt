1
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:05,360
Some call Bregna the perfect society.

2
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:09,740
Some call it
the height of human civilization.

3
00:02:12,534 --> 00:02:14,411
But others know better.

4
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:20,459
The Goodchilds built Bregna
to ensure us a future.

5
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:26,465
They built the Relical...

6
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:29,843
a memorial to remind us
of what we've survived.

7
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,474
They built walls to protect us.

8
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:42,272
They tell us that outside,
nature has retaken the world.

9
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,906
But the real problems lie within.

10
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,789
We are haunted
by sorrows we cannot name.

11
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:01,416
People disappear...

12
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,795
and our government
denies these crimes.

13
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:10,092
The Goodchild regime provides for us,
as long as we stay quiet.

14
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:15,472
So we trade freedom for a gilded cage.

15
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:20,310
But there are rebels
who refuse to make that trade...

16
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:24,648
who fight to overthrow a government
that silences us...

17
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:29,319
who fight
in the name of the disappeared.

18
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:36,535
They call themselves the Monicans.

19
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:41,582
I am one of them.

20
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:52,653
Handler.

21
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:54,279
Aeon.

22
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:57,491
We have an assignment.

23
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:01,828
We want you to sabotage Goodchild's
central surveillance facility.

24
00:05:02,496 --> 00:05:07,209
Your entry will be noticed, but we will
briefly disrupt their interior alarms.

25
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:11,088
Surveillance is their greatest tool
against us.

26
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,883
As long as Monicans can be seen,
we can be targeted.

27
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,970
We need you to blind them.

28
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:24,434
Each mission brings us closer
to defeating the Goodchild regime.

29
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,901
This is my daughter.
Have you seen her?

30
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:34,987
She disappeared two months ago.

31
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:38,574
Help me, please, miss.
Have you seen this girl?

32
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:40,784
She disappeared two months ago.

33
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,662
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

34
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:46,081
Visit our sleep center for help.

35
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,919
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?
Visit our sleep...

36
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:52,796
Shopping for me, Una?

37
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,133
Haven't you heard?
It's a special occasion.

38
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:58,885
My sister's finally coming to dinner.

39
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:01,930
Claudius and I
are looking forward to tonight.

40
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:05,142
For once, you'll be in the house
long enough to sit down.

41
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,686
That's why
I wanted to meet with you here.

42
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,980
Aeon.

43
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,274
I may not make it tonight, I'm sorry.

44
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:15,527
Don't be upset.

45
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:17,946
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

46
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:20,115
It's why.

47
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,618
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

48
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:25,329
We have different ways
of solving problems.

49
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:27,915
Yes. You ignore them.

50
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:30,459
How could I possibly ignore them?

51
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,961
Excuse me. This is my daughter.

52
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:37,591
I see the problems. I feel them.

53
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,845
And I'm trying
to make something good out of it.

54
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:46,016
- A life.
- What kind of life is it?

55
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:51,772
There are good things here.

56
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:56,360
There's one.

57
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,284
- So I have a surprise for you.
- Tell me.

58
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:06,870
Tonight.

59
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:10,916
So be careful.

60
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,627
And come back.

61
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:17,923
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

62
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:20,175
Visit our sleep center for help.

63
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:23,929
Losing sleep? Having bad dreams?

64
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:25,889
Visit our sleep center for help.

65
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:45,010
Possible Monican consort.
Three subjects.

66
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:48,263
Identification requested.

67
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:51,808
Possible Monican activity suspected.

68
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:02,444
It's not that you can't come to dinner.

69
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:03,528
It's why.

70
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,574
You know,
I used to imagine you'd come with me.

71
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:15,207
I think we have different ways
of solving problems.

72
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,126
This is the way things are
and I'm trying...

73
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,004
to make something good out of it. A life.

74
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:16,184
You're early, Claudius.

75
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:31,408
But they're everywhere.

76
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,744
We need to protect you from them.

77
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,603
This is how Chairman Goodchild
deals with Monicans.

78
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:01,146
But she wasn't...

79
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:03,857
She wasn't a Monican.

80
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,166
I had a family once.

81
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:26,588
I had a life.

82
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:32,970
Now all I have is a mission.

83
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:46,149
Una.

84
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:49,486
Aeon.

85
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:51,947
Aeon, Una.

86
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,323
Aeon.

87
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:54,866
Come back.

88
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,080
Yes.

89
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:44,625
She will see you now.

90
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,015
Handler.

91
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:01,642
Aeon.

92
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,685
We have an assignment.

93
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,104
One you've been waiting for.

94
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,481
Goodchild.

95
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:11,860
We've intercepted information that
will allow us to penetrate his security.

96
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:15,614
We want you to eliminate him.

97
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:18,242
You should've sent me in earlier.

98
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:21,203
- That would've been suicide.
- Not for me.

99
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:22,621
Patience, Aeon.

100
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:25,499
It has taken a year
to get the information we need.

101
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,793
I know you want to do this for Una.

102
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:31,421
But you must remember,
this is larger than you.

103
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:35,425
She's not the only innocent person
who's been killed.

104
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,138
This is our moment.

105
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,641
We have never been stronger.

106
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:45,394
People are frightened, yes...

107
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,563
but if we show them the way...

108
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:50,023
they will rise behind us when he's gone.

109
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:51,942
I'm ready.

110
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:07,958
Tomorrow, Goodchild will be preparing
his address to the Council.

111
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:12,671
To reach the government zone, you
will need to cross the frontier garden.

112
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:17,050
Once you are through the garden,
you must move quickly to the Citadel.

113
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:21,346
The underground interior has been built
to be confusing.

114
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,058
We've implanted a route for you.
Follow it.

115
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:28,103
I want Sithandra with me
for the crossing.

116
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,772
Of course. Get to the Forum.

117
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:33,233
That's where
Chairman Goodchild will be.

118
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:35,861
You know what to do from there.

119
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:37,195
Yes.

120
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:41,491
Do this and you will have your revenge.

121
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:44,077
And we will all have our victory.

122
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:03,180
Hello, Sithandra.

123
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:09,061
- Still can't surprise you.
- Not yet.

124
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:14,942
How are the modifications?

125
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:25,994
Useful.

126
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:28,247
You should have it done.

127
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,915
I like my shoes.

128
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:38,924
Warning. End of civilian zone.
Do not proceed.

129
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:47,933
Warning. Do not proceed.

130
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,142
Ready?

131
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,311
Always.

132
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:53,605
Warning. Do not proceed.

133
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,929
- Sithandra.
- Let's keep moving.

134
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,766
- We understand these now?
- Completely.

135
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:10,158
I'd keep off the grass.

136
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:19,835
- Rendezvous at 1620.
- I'll be waiting.

137
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:25,025
I agree with the policy
of targeting proven Monican threats.

138
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,569
But I'm afraid we're going too far.

139
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,863
We can't go too far with them.

140
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:36,620
There are advantages
to showing a degree of leniency.

141
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:40,290
We can't allow them the luxury of hope.
Not even one of them.

142
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,668
Brute force isn't the only option.

143
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:44,253
It's an effective one.

144
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:47,005
The Monicans are growing strong.
Soon, force won't be enough.

145
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,591
So you want to compromise?
Negotiate?

146
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,135
The policy should be reconsidered.

147
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:56,181
- Put to a vote.
- The policy is not up for debate!

148
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,976
I'm debating it!

149
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,691
I'd encourage you to look at this
with a little more detachment, Giroux.

150
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,819
Here, we must be impersonal.

151
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:14,157
You wouldn't want me to take
your outburst personally, would you?

152
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:34,219
That is all.

153
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:38,307
Oren?

154
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:50,110
I'm getting worried about you, Oren.
This edge you've taken.

155
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:52,070
Displays like that aren't helpful to us.

156
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:55,240
I believe in protecting what we've
created. I won't apologize for that.

157
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:57,826
This was created
to allow me to do my work.

158
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,121
I can't do that
if you can't control yourself.

159
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:04,416
- Understood.
- Is it?

160
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:06,585
Yes.

161
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:12,090
- And what about the test results?
- All negative.

162
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:16,261
Sorry.

163
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:18,680
Find me a new test group by morning.

164
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:22,392
Maybe it's time
to give up on the tests, Trevor.

165
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:26,230
We're living the solution already.
This is perfection.

166
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:29,608
- Why can't you just embrace it?
- You see what's happening to people.

167
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:31,443
You know
how desperate this has become.

168
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:34,112
It can be contained. Controlled.

169
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:37,991
I think you're forgetting
that this was all meant to be temporary.

170
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,911
We've always said that,
but why should it be?

171
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:42,371
Because it's wrong.

172
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:43,914
Things change.

173
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:46,792
But I know you won't.

174
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:49,044
You know me.

175
00:21:49,628 --> 00:21:51,171
I've been your brother a long time.

176
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:53,382
You're right about that.

177
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:55,217
Trevor, your speech.

178
00:21:57,636 --> 00:21:58,845
Trevor...

179
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:19,116
Useless.

180
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:37,467
- State destination.
- Forum.

181
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,470
Proceed forward.

182
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:47,853
Proceed left.

183
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:51,857
I know you have fears.

184
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:56,111
You have sorrows that shake your belief
and try your patience.

185
00:22:56,862 --> 00:22:59,448
But now more than ever,
we must stand together...

186
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,658
because there are those among us...

187
00:23:01,783 --> 00:23:04,328
who would tear down
what we have built.

188
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:07,080
The Monicans seek to divide us.

189
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:09,499
We must never forget who we are...

190
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:12,502
a lonely outpost, a tiny band.

191
00:23:13,253 --> 00:23:16,798
We're all that remains of a people
that once covered the Earth.

192
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:19,760
We must adapt together
to these new challenges.

193
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:25,098
Remember what we have faced,
what we have survived.

194
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:27,476
We will adapt.

195
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:33,232
We have always adapted.

196
00:23:40,572 --> 00:23:42,950
It's the fabric of who we are.

197
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,419
Katherine.

198
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:09,977
It's you.

199
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:29,496
Katherine.

200
00:25:20,964 --> 00:25:22,382
Wait outside.

201
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:35,646
Aeon.

202
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:38,649
You called me by another name earlier.

203
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:41,485
I did, and you let me live.

204
00:25:41,693 --> 00:25:44,905
Give me my gun. We'll try it again.

205
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,823
Maybe later.

206
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,202
What was that name?

207
00:25:52,204 --> 00:25:54,039
You know me, don't you?

208
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,041
No.

209
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:58,835
Do you know who you are?

210
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,173
- I know I came here to kill you.
- That's why you're in a cell.

211
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:07,886
But we're both still alive for a reason.

212
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,310
I don't know what this is...

213
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:20,107
but it's good to see you.

214
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:59,146
Amateurs.

215
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:08,006
Good boys.

216
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,709
- Aeon.
- Little busy, Sithandra.

217
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,168
Is it done?

218
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:48,589
I need more time.

219
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:50,841
Our information on him may be wrong.

220
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:54,052
I don't understand this.
We have to move. I hope you...

221
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:56,346
Don't question me, Sithandra.

222
00:28:58,223 --> 00:28:59,516
I'll contact you soon.

223
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,436
Aeon, you know
there will be consequences to this.

224
00:29:02,644 --> 00:29:04,479
I know what I'm doing.

225
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:08,358
This is outrageous.

226
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:10,611
One Monican
eluding all of our defenses?

227
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:12,112
The problem will be taken care of.

228
00:29:12,237 --> 00:29:14,531
The problem is
Trevor's concept of security.

229
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:16,700
He needs to learn to accept
more traditional...

230
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:19,077
He needs to learn to accept our input.

231
00:29:19,286 --> 00:29:22,247
Another example of him pursuing his
own agenda, no matter what we think.

232
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:25,208
- I'm beginning to question his agenda.
- Meaning?

233
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:27,920
The Monican tries to kill him
and he lets her live?

234
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:29,463
An unusual choice.

235
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,548
And now she's escaped.

236
00:29:31,632 --> 00:29:33,300
Does anyone believe
this is a coincidence?

237
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:35,260
Do you really think
that I'm a sympathetic ear...

238
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:37,387
for your complaints about Trevor?

239
00:29:38,597 --> 00:29:41,391
You don't have the right
to question what he does.

240
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:43,560
You must be concerned, Oren.

241
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:46,146
This is hardly routine.

242
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:49,524
I think I should talk with Trevor.

243
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:52,527
And I think
all of you should be more discreet.

244
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:56,448
Inari?

245
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:02,579
Image retrieval commencing.

246
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:04,498
What happened?

247
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:06,291
My sources were clear on this.

248
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:08,543
Aeon Flux
is the best the Monicans have.

249
00:30:08,627 --> 00:30:11,338
- She failed.
- It's the first time she has.

250
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,924
I wanted this done cleanly.

251
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:17,678
- My brother...
- Will be vulnerable.

252
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:20,264
Preparing his speech...

253
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,432
Tomorrow, 1300...

254
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,979
It can't be traced to you, in any case.

255
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:28,689
That's comforting.

256
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:30,774
We did everything correctly.

257
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,527
- She had her opportunity.
- And she stopped.

258
00:30:33,986 --> 00:30:35,112
Why?

259
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,117
- I don't know.
- Image retrieval underway.

260
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,744
It'll be too risky to call another hit.

261
00:30:42,828 --> 00:30:45,706
The Monicans may suspect
they are being used.

262
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:50,502
Stop.

263
00:30:52,838 --> 00:30:53,880
Oren?

264
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:55,882
No.

265
00:30:57,843 --> 00:30:59,469
That's impossible.

266
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:13,775
Claudius.

267
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:19,531
- Why are you still here?
- It's not as simple as you think.

268
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:23,160
Una is murdered and you keep working
for the people who did it?

269
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:25,370
- What should I be thinking?
- You don't know.

270
00:31:25,495 --> 00:31:27,289
What don't I know?

271
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:29,458
They killed her.

272
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,669
- And you're still alive.
- You killed her, Aeon.

273
00:31:33,086 --> 00:31:35,964
They thought she was a Monican,
that's why she died.

274
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:40,552
- Una's life was worth more than that.
- She was all I had.

275
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:44,181
You're not the only one.

276
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,811
What are you
really doing here, Claudius?

277
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:52,022
Working.

278
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:55,067
It's all that's left.

279
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:57,569
Working. For Trevor Goodchild.

280
00:31:59,071 --> 00:32:00,697
I blamed him, too.

281
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:03,075
But now
I don't think it was Trevor's fault.

282
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,952
Trevor's trying to help.

283
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:09,039
Something is wrong with us, Aeon.
With everybody.

284
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:12,501
You have the dreams, don't you?

285
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:15,420
Memories of things
that never happened to you?

286
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:17,798
Una had them. I have them.

287
00:32:17,923 --> 00:32:19,967
It's happening all across Bregna.

288
00:32:20,092 --> 00:32:22,135
- What is it?
- I don't know.

289
00:32:22,386 --> 00:32:24,846
They only tell us what we need to know.

290
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,558
My work is a small part
of a larger experiment.

291
00:32:27,683 --> 00:32:30,102
- Whose experiment?
- Trevor's.

292
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:33,897
We're studying
what's growing outside the wall.

293
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,818
Something happened
when they cured the industrial disease.

294
00:32:37,943 --> 00:32:40,529
Something else sprung up in its place.

295
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,614
We're sick.

296
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:46,702
And Trevor's trying to cure us.
That's all I know.

297
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,083
Trevor tried to dope me.

298
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,043
Tell me what's in this.

299
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:03,969
It's a message.

300
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:06,054
Well, what does it say?

301
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,474
You have to drink it.
That's how it works.

302
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,147
I loved her.

303
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:19,985
You know that.

304
00:33:40,172 --> 00:33:41,214
Aeon.

305
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,678
I'm sorry for the pain,
but it's not safe to talk in the open.

306
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,848
Nothing is as it seems.

307
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:55,145
You had your chance.
Why did you hesitate?

308
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:00,859
You know where to find me.

309
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:33,350
- Why am I here?
- I needed to see you again.

310
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:35,852
You killed my sister.

311
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:38,438
I didn't know anything about it.

312
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:40,482
I'm sorry.

313
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:42,776
- And that excuses you?
- No.

314
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:45,821
But this is a war.
People on all sides die.

315
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:49,533
She shouldn't have.
She had nothing to do with this.

316
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,745
- Everyone is involved in this.
- She wasn't.

317
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:59,835
I don't need that to kill you.

318
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:02,337
But it would be easier, wouldn't it?

319
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,719
Everything changed when I saw you.

320
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:13,056
I know you. And you know me.

321
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,353
Why do I know you? Why?

322
00:35:21,189 --> 00:35:23,025
Why did you come back?

323
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:26,945
- What do you want from me?
- What do I want?

324
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:29,072
I want my sister back.

325
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:32,534
I want to remember
what it feels like to be a person.

326
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:41,376
Aeon.

327
00:35:42,002 --> 00:35:44,421
Why do I feel this way around you?

328
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:47,025
Katherine...

329
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:49,903
You know me.

330
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:52,864
I want you to eliminate him.

331
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:55,409
Come back.

332
00:36:56,702 --> 00:36:59,037
I'm not who you think I am, Aeon.

333
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:00,677
Something is missing here.

334
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:04,932
We identified the variables
that compromised test group 7A.

335
00:40:05,057 --> 00:40:09,144
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

336
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:10,646
It's just a matter of time...

337
00:40:10,729 --> 00:40:13,941
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

338
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:45,430
Found you.

339
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,558
No permanent damage here, Chairman.

340
00:42:56,436 --> 00:42:57,896
You may leave.

341
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:03,527
She's escaped.

342
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:05,904
Why am I not surprised?

343
00:43:05,988 --> 00:43:07,906
I found her in the library.

344
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:10,617
- I think I wounded her, but...
- You attacked her?

345
00:43:10,742 --> 00:43:13,161
She's a Monican agent
who tried to kill you.

346
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:15,247
I assumed it was obvious
what I should do.

347
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:18,166
Freya, I want her alive.
Do you understand?

348
00:43:23,672 --> 00:43:25,507
Is Oren aware of this?

349
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:27,676
I can't find him.

350
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:29,761
Stay close.

351
00:43:36,184 --> 00:43:39,980
No matter what Trevor's done for us
in the past, he's not above reproach.

352
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:41,648
This is treason.

353
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:44,568
Oren?

354
00:43:47,237 --> 00:43:50,490
Trevor has been moving away from us
for a long time.

355
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:53,827
What we've built here
is larger than him.

356
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:01,251
I never thought it would come to this,
but we have to face the truth.

357
00:44:02,502 --> 00:44:05,881
He chose that Monican
and he knew what that would mean.

358
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:07,633
He must be removed.

359
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:09,801
And Oren is next in line.

360
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:13,263
Isn't that right?

361
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:16,099
Yes.

362
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:18,852
It's done, then.

363
00:44:20,646 --> 00:44:22,105
Mr. Chairman.

364
00:44:24,942 --> 00:44:27,110
Trevor has betrayed all of us.

365
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:31,240
He's a criminal.

366
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:34,284
We'll treat him as one.

367
00:44:37,454 --> 00:44:39,164
...test group 7A.

368
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:43,252
Schedule a Relical visit regarding 7B
and make sure we isolate them.

369
00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:44,670
It's just a matter of time...

370
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:47,965
before people look up
and question what's happening here.

371
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:53,720
Review progress of subjects
from test group 7B...

372
00:44:54,012 --> 00:44:57,474
Sandrin Veems, Greta Salk, Una Flux.

373
00:44:57,766 --> 00:45:00,727
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

374
00:45:00,852 --> 00:45:03,689
8.26, 7.19.

375
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:07,776
Greta Salk, Una Flux.

376
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:10,946
Schedule a Relical visit
to retrieve new data.

377
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:13,865
8.26, 7.19.

378
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:20,122
Collect additional samples
from Relical strands 5.88.

379
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:26,628
You're certainly killing him kindly.

380
00:45:29,423 --> 00:45:31,466
The situation has changed.

381
00:45:31,592 --> 00:45:33,343
Our orders haven't.

382
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:36,430
I'm not following orders anymore.

383
00:45:37,389 --> 00:45:39,558
Why are you doing this, Aeon?

384
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:42,519
Everything has become
more complicated.

385
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:43,687
No, it's simple.

386
00:45:43,812 --> 00:45:45,898
Trevor may not be responsible
for Una's death.

387
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:49,359
- Trevor?
- I'm trying to find out who is.

388
00:45:49,902 --> 00:45:54,323
Your mission was to kill Goodchild
and you can't or won't do that. So...

389
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:00,495
Give me your weapon
and return across the frontier.

390
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:04,833
- Didn't I teach you to think for yourself?
- You taught me a lot more than that.

391
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:08,128
Please!

392
00:46:08,587 --> 00:46:10,714
I can hurt you if I have to.

393
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:14,301
Don't you feel something wrong
inside you?

394
00:46:14,468 --> 00:46:16,094
Sithandra, I'm...

395
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:21,850
I don't know who I am.

396
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:27,022
You feel it, too, don't you?

397
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:29,942
Come with me.

398
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:33,445
We'll finish the mission together.

399
00:46:39,326 --> 00:46:40,535
I can't.

400
00:47:57,529 --> 00:47:59,489
This sort of thing used to be fun.

401
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:02,409
Now what do I do with you?

402
00:48:43,742 --> 00:48:44,785
Katherine.

403
00:48:47,955 --> 00:48:49,248
Come back.

404
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:35,103
07.4.872.

405
00:50:35,854 --> 00:50:38,649
Noted. Returned to stream.

406
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:41,568
Gregor Plitzen.

407
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:47,366
70.5.872.

408
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:50,994
Noted. Returned to stream.

409
00:50:52,246 --> 00:50:53,956
Suki Denali.

410
00:50:54,706 --> 00:50:59,378
02.4.875.

411
00:50:59,753 --> 00:51:02,381
Noted. Returned to stream.

412
00:51:09,137 --> 00:51:10,556
Welcome back.

413
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:50,554
Una Flux.

414
00:51:51,346 --> 00:51:55,767
32.4.870.

415
00:51:56,476 --> 00:51:57,769
Collected.

416
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:04,192
Successfully reassigned
as Sasha Prillo.

417
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,903
Repeat.

418
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:11,575
Una Flux. Reassigned as Sasha Prillo.

419
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:17,289
Sasha Prillo. Address.

420
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:21,168
Sasha Prillo. Address.

421
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:53,909
Handler.

422
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:55,285
Sithandra.

423
00:52:55,702 --> 00:52:57,704
Goodchild is still alive.

424
00:52:57,913 --> 00:52:59,331
Aeon failed?

425
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:01,541
She let him live.

426
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:04,628
There's something between them.

427
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:06,838
Something personal.

428
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:08,549
Explain.

429
00:53:09,007 --> 00:53:10,717
She abandoned the mission.

430
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:14,429
I tried to stop her,
and she attacked me and left me here.

431
00:53:16,056 --> 00:53:18,225
Are you secure where you are?

432
00:53:19,726 --> 00:53:20,894
Fairly.

433
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,522
Help is coming.

434
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:26,650
Aeon Flux is now considered a fugitive.

435
00:53:27,526 --> 00:53:31,113
She has betrayed the resistance
and must be considered a threat.

436
00:53:31,196 --> 00:53:34,783
She has aligned herself with Goodchild
and is with him now.

437
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:36,660
We must move quickly.

438
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:39,746
You will eliminate her.

439
00:53:40,372 --> 00:53:43,041
Kill her and then complete her mission.

440
00:53:44,585 --> 00:53:47,045
Sithandra, show them where you are.

441
00:53:54,177 --> 00:53:55,554
Do you see?

442
00:53:56,805 --> 00:53:58,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:53:58,724 --> 00:53:59,808
Yes.

444
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:03,395
Extricate her and proceed from there.

445
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,696
Trevor?

446
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:27,252
It's her.

447
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,004
Yes.

448
00:54:30,422 --> 00:54:33,258
- She was here.
- What was she looking for?

449
00:54:33,926 --> 00:54:35,260
Her sister.

450
00:54:37,221 --> 00:54:38,222
Una.

451
00:54:53,612 --> 00:54:54,863
Una Flux.

452
00:54:57,366 --> 00:54:58,742
Scroll down.

453
00:54:59,284 --> 00:55:02,412
Member of test group 7B.

454
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:04,581
Show me all of 7B.

455
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,418
Sandrin Veems.

456
00:55:08,961 --> 00:55:11,213
Member of 7B.

457
00:55:11,713 --> 00:55:13,882
Killed in police action.

458
00:55:17,177 --> 00:55:18,387
Where is she?

459
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:19,846
Greta Salk.

460
00:55:20,347 --> 00:55:22,808
Member of 7B.

461
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:25,269
Killed in police action.

462
00:55:25,477 --> 00:55:27,229
There's nobody here.

463
00:55:28,647 --> 00:55:30,274
Camille Abdi.

464
00:55:30,816 --> 00:55:33,110
Member of 7B.

465
00:55:33,902 --> 00:55:35,946
Killed in police action.

466
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:45,622
Una Flux.

467
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,250
Member of 7B.

468
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:51,503
Killed in police action.

469
00:56:05,934 --> 00:56:07,352
Who did this?

470
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:11,982
All actions authorized
by Adjunct Chairman Oren Goodchild.

471
00:56:14,026 --> 00:56:17,571
Freya, go to my lab,
find the notes from group 7B.

472
00:56:17,696 --> 00:56:20,532
You need to get to a safe place.
They're moving against you.

473
00:56:20,616 --> 00:56:23,035
- Meet me there in two hours.
- Where are you going?

474
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,621
- I have to find her before they do.
- Trevor...

475
00:56:25,704 --> 00:56:27,998
Freya, I'll see you at the lab.

476
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:30,667
Take care of yourself.

477
00:56:39,635 --> 00:56:40,761
Una.

478
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:43,388
You're right.

479
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:49,937
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- She's safe.

480
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,690
You cloned her?

481
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:56,276
I cloned everybody.

482
00:56:58,654 --> 00:57:02,491
There was a complication
when we cured the industrial disease.

483
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:06,954
The vaccine had
an unintended side effect.

484
00:57:08,997 --> 00:57:10,290
Sterility.

485
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:14,503
Only one more generation
of our species could survive.

486
00:57:15,504 --> 00:57:17,005
It was a desperate time.

487
00:57:17,089 --> 00:57:18,465
It's our responsibility...

488
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,094
Cloning had never been used
on humans successfully.

489
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:28,308
But we succeeded.

490
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:34,690
Now, when a person dies,
their DNA is recycled.

491
00:57:34,815 --> 00:57:37,818
Oren and I built the Relical
to store the DNA...

492
00:57:37,943 --> 00:57:39,903
and conceal the cloning process.

493
00:57:40,279 --> 00:57:42,990
The Keeper finds a suitable couple...

494
00:57:43,615 --> 00:57:47,202
and, using food additives,
we induce a chemical pregnancy.

495
00:57:48,954 --> 00:57:52,916
When the woman comes in for an exam,
we implant a cloned embryo.

496
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:55,460
From there, things happen naturally.

497
00:57:56,003 --> 00:57:59,798
In nine months,
a citizen who died is reborn.

498
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:05,637
For seven generations,
Oren and I have cloned ourselves...

499
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:09,600
taught ourselves, so that
I could keep trying to find a cure...

500
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,353
while we all live on.

501
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:19,985
That's what we are?

502
00:58:21,194 --> 00:58:22,362
Copies?

503
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:25,324
We're more than that.

504
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:31,830
It wasn't supposed to be permanent.

505
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:37,628
I've been trying to cure the infertility.

506
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:43,550
Una was part of one of my test groups.

507
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:45,802
Oren lied to me.

508
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:49,139
He told me her test had failed
like the others.

509
00:58:49,848 --> 00:58:51,975
But she had become pregnant.

510
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,564
He killed all of the subjects.

511
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,192
Your sister included.

512
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:05,489
He killed her
because she was pregnant.

513
00:59:10,577 --> 00:59:12,287
Una didn't know it...

514
00:59:12,871 --> 00:59:17,125
but her baby would've been one
of the first new children in 400 years.

515
00:59:19,294 --> 00:59:20,796
Oren's changed.

516
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:25,592
He doesn't want to go back.
He doesn't want a cure.

517
00:59:26,552 --> 00:59:28,512
He wants to live forever.

518
00:59:37,938 --> 00:59:41,608
You must've been expecting this
after helping that Monican.

519
00:59:44,111 --> 00:59:47,239
Your loyalty to Trevor
can't protect you anymore.

520
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:50,409
I'm loyal to something deeper
than any of this.

521
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:54,079
I don't understand
people like you and Trevor.

522
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:57,332
Your sentimentality,
your devotion to the past...

523
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,002
to things that are gone.

524
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:02,671
I couldn't live without those things.

525
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,756
How can you?

526
01:00:22,983 --> 01:00:24,109
Sasha.

527
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:28,947
We should go.
It won't take long for Oren to find us.

528
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:35,245
She's gonna be a handful.

529
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:40,709
Go. They don't want you.

530
01:00:40,834 --> 01:00:41,877
Go!

531
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:41,056
Down!

532
01:03:57,531 --> 01:03:59,783
No. You need to stay conscious.

533
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:10,627
Please remain calm.

534
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:14,423
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

535
01:04:17,175 --> 01:04:18,927
Please remain calm.

536
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:22,681
We are experiencing
a technical malfunction.

537
01:04:24,224 --> 01:04:26,101
Please remain calm.

538
01:04:26,727 --> 01:04:28,645
We are experiencing...

539
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:42,868
We can't go to a Monican safe house.

540
01:04:43,076 --> 01:04:45,329
Nowhere's going to be safe for us.

541
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:03,513
We need to get the bullets out.

542
01:05:40,884 --> 01:05:42,886
Are you hit anywhere else?

543
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,602
Did any of them manage to miss you?

544
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,666
We might have to go outside the wall.

545
01:06:13,917 --> 01:06:15,043
I know.

546
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,923
First, I have to end this.

547
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,596
I need to go back in.

548
01:06:25,846 --> 01:06:28,765
I have to get my notes
from Una's test group.

549
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:33,729
Oren will find the lab and destroy it,
everything I've done.

550
01:06:49,453 --> 01:06:51,997
All military units should report
to their stations...

551
01:06:52,122 --> 01:06:54,208
and wait for further instructions.

552
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:03,383
Who's in charge here?

553
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:06,136
We need your help.

554
01:07:06,261 --> 01:07:08,764
- We have orders to shoot you on sight.
- There's been a coup.

555
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:11,642
Your orders are coming
from an illegitimate government.

556
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:14,645
- Stay where you are, sir!
- What's your name?

557
01:07:15,103 --> 01:07:17,314
- Sir?
- I want to know your name.

558
01:07:18,815 --> 01:07:21,443
It's Ord. Garret Ord.

559
01:07:21,985 --> 01:07:25,572
I can't command you anymore, Garret.
But neither can they.

560
01:07:26,156 --> 01:07:27,574
You're free.

561
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,494
You need to make a decision.

562
01:07:33,997 --> 01:07:36,667
Shoot us or help us, but do it quickly.

563
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:39,461
Lieutenant?

564
01:07:47,886 --> 01:07:50,472
How can I help you,
Chairman Goodchild?

565
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:56,645
We need weapons.
We need to get back into the Citadel.

566
01:07:56,728 --> 01:07:57,980
Yes, sir.

567
01:08:08,073 --> 01:08:12,035
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

568
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,870
You will be updated frequently.

569
01:08:13,954 --> 01:08:18,000
This is an announcement from the
Council and Chairman Oren Goodchild.

570
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:24,256
Attention. Please return to your home
and wait for further instructions.

571
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,345
- We're getting closer.
- Wait.

572
01:08:50,365 --> 01:08:51,575
Trevor.

573
01:08:53,911 --> 01:08:55,913
The name you called me...

574
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:00,125
Katherine.

575
01:09:01,418 --> 01:09:03,003
That was my name.

576
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,175
You were my wife.

577
01:09:12,763 --> 01:09:15,766
We had a life together,
just like anybody else.

578
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:17,309
Wait.

579
01:09:18,602 --> 01:09:20,354
You need to tell me.

580
01:09:22,522 --> 01:09:26,443
I lost you during the disease,
and you couldn't be brought back.

581
01:09:27,027 --> 01:09:30,113
I've lived and died
seven times since then.

582
01:09:31,907 --> 01:09:34,576
And each time
I taught myself about you.

583
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:37,579
You were an idea I kept alive.

584
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,123
Something I had to imagine.

585
01:09:45,337 --> 01:09:47,130
But when I saw you...

586
01:09:49,967 --> 01:09:51,802
what I felt was real.

587
01:09:52,678 --> 01:09:54,054
I knew you.

588
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:57,474
I remembered you.

589
01:09:58,016 --> 01:10:01,979
What we had then survived in us
past death, past everything.

590
01:10:04,231 --> 01:10:06,066
I was looking for you.

591
01:10:07,317 --> 01:10:08,944
I've been waiting.

592
01:10:10,612 --> 01:10:12,573
We were different people.

593
01:10:13,407 --> 01:10:14,616
We were.

594
01:10:15,409 --> 01:10:17,160
Those people are gone.

595
01:10:18,954 --> 01:10:21,248
But something in them came back.

596
01:10:22,499 --> 01:10:23,542
Yes.

597
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:40,684
I remember.

598
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:45,022
It's chaos out there.

599
01:10:45,147 --> 01:10:47,107
There's a coup against Goodchild.

600
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:49,192
Made it easier to slip in.

601
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:50,819
Did you bring a way to find her?

602
01:10:50,903 --> 01:10:53,989
As long as there's a trace of the pill
in her, we can track her.

603
01:11:04,416 --> 01:11:05,459
No.

604
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:25,520
Freya.

605
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:33,028
It's gone.

606
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:36,782
I had cured it.

607
01:11:37,032 --> 01:11:38,909
I'd found the answer.

608
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:40,911
It's all gone.

609
01:11:43,914 --> 01:11:45,749
We have to keep moving.

610
01:11:54,758 --> 01:11:57,219
There's still one more thing to do.

611
01:11:57,761 --> 01:12:01,557
There's nothing left to do.
You and I need to get out of here.

612
01:12:02,558 --> 01:12:05,769
We go outside the wall.
We'll find a way to live.

613
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:09,398
There's one more thing to do.
I need to destroy it.

614
01:12:10,232 --> 01:12:11,233
No.

615
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:15,487
This isn't the answer, Aeon.

616
01:12:15,612 --> 01:12:17,948
There's no guarantee
I can find the cure again.

617
01:12:18,073 --> 01:12:21,076
- The cloning is all we have.
- It's not enough.

618
01:12:21,618 --> 01:12:25,289
Our minds are unraveling, and every
time you bring us back it gets worse.

619
01:12:25,414 --> 01:12:27,291
If you do this, we end.

620
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:29,543
We're meant to die.

621
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:33,839
It's what makes
anything about us matter.

622
01:12:36,133 --> 01:12:38,176
Living like this is torture.

623
01:12:38,302 --> 01:12:39,928
We're just ghosts.

624
01:12:41,972 --> 01:12:43,599
That's not how I feel.

625
01:12:45,851 --> 01:12:46,935
Not now.

626
01:12:55,068 --> 01:12:56,653
Let's be careful.

627
01:12:57,154 --> 01:12:59,364
You know who we're up against.

628
01:13:05,787 --> 01:13:08,790
- This is an empty gesture.
- It's a leap of faith.

629
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:10,959
It's not for you to decide.

630
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,464
Aeon, I don't want to lose you again.

631
01:13:16,882 --> 01:13:18,550
You don't have to.

632
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:21,845
You'll find the cure again.

633
01:13:23,222 --> 01:13:24,890
It's over, Trevor.

634
01:13:32,606 --> 01:13:35,150
Moving into position on the south spire.

635
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:40,530
It goes so much deeper than your cure.

636
01:13:41,073 --> 01:13:43,742
Other women have been
getting pregnant naturally...

637
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:45,953
outside of your experiments.

638
01:13:46,161 --> 01:13:47,996
More and more of them.

639
01:13:49,122 --> 01:13:50,999
They healed themselves.

640
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,878
- And you killed them, too?
- I had to stop it.

641
01:13:55,796 --> 01:13:57,089
How many?

642
01:14:01,552 --> 01:14:02,761
How many, Oren?

643
01:14:03,512 --> 01:14:06,765
It doesn't matter.
Nature's finally found a way.

644
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,853
- In position.
- In position.

645
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:13,272
Position acquired.

646
01:14:13,647 --> 01:14:16,567
Nature's the one who's obsolete, not us.

647
01:14:17,859 --> 01:14:22,072
How can you not understand
the beauty of what you made? I do.

648
01:14:23,407 --> 01:14:25,033
Situation's getting complicated.

649
01:14:31,874 --> 01:14:34,001
You told me she was gone.

650
01:14:38,505 --> 01:14:40,299
There was nothing that they could do.

651
01:14:43,969 --> 01:14:46,096
I ordered her DNA destroyed.

652
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:50,100
You were a different man
with her, Trevor.

653
01:14:50,183 --> 01:14:53,395
She would've stopped you
from doing what needed to be done.

654
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:56,398
- Like she's stopping you now.
- No, Oren.

655
01:14:56,481 --> 01:14:57,524
Yes.

656
01:14:57,858 --> 01:14:59,735
- Waiting for the go.
- On my signal.

657
01:14:59,818 --> 01:15:02,070
This world, our world, is beautiful.

658
01:15:02,696 --> 01:15:04,781
Worth preserving at any cost.

659
01:15:04,948 --> 01:15:07,326
It can't last. It's falling apart.

660
01:15:11,246 --> 01:15:13,123
Sithandra, give us the signal.

661
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:17,461
- Sithandra.
- Take Flux down first.

662
01:15:17,586 --> 01:15:18,670
You're wrong in this, Oren.

663
01:15:18,795 --> 01:15:21,173
We've beaten death, beaten nature.

664
01:15:22,382 --> 01:15:24,051
We've gone beyond you.

665
01:15:24,718 --> 01:15:26,762
And now I need to be free of you.

666
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,065
Wait.

667
01:15:51,078 --> 01:15:52,412
Sithandra.

668
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:59,461
You chose this, Aeon. It's too late.

669
01:15:59,836 --> 01:16:01,838
You know how much we're all suffering.

670
01:16:01,964 --> 01:16:04,341
I'm trying to end it, and so is Trevor.

671
01:16:04,967 --> 01:16:06,885
I would never betray you.

672
01:16:07,511 --> 01:16:08,679
Help me.

673
01:16:10,847 --> 01:16:12,182
Sithandra.

674
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:15,018
You still know me.

675
01:16:15,143 --> 01:16:16,478
Finish it.

676
01:16:17,354 --> 01:16:19,439
You can choose to trust me.

677
01:16:24,278 --> 01:16:25,279
Finish it.

678
01:16:25,362 --> 01:16:26,989
I'm sorry, Oren.

679
01:16:27,197 --> 01:16:28,282
I'm sorry.

680
01:16:28,365 --> 01:16:29,491
I am, too.

681
01:16:34,496 --> 01:16:37,708
Orders have changed.
Cover Aeon. Cover Goodchild.

682
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,585
Goodchild's been hit.

683
01:17:26,131 --> 01:17:27,799
Flux is headed to the courtyard.

684
01:17:31,637 --> 01:17:32,971
Cover Aeon.

685
01:18:56,805 --> 01:18:58,140
Sithandra!

686
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:50,484
Oren.

687
01:20:24,268 --> 01:20:25,769
They're coming.

688
01:20:30,941 --> 01:20:32,109
Aeon.

689
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:54,381
We're waiting for your orders.

690
01:20:54,882 --> 01:20:56,800
You're not part of this?

691
01:20:57,801 --> 01:21:00,429
Whatever we are, we're not anarchists.

692
01:21:00,804 --> 01:21:03,307
- There have to be rules.
- Thank you.

693
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,924
You're the one.

694
01:21:37,674 --> 01:21:39,134
You saved me.

695
01:21:39,718 --> 01:21:40,761
Yes.

696
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,513
I knew you then.

697
01:21:43,889 --> 01:21:46,516
This one was corrupted. Destroy it.

698
01:21:47,059 --> 01:21:49,061
I knew you were important.

699
01:21:49,728 --> 01:21:51,313
The DNA is good.

700
01:21:51,396 --> 01:21:52,731
Destroy it.

701
01:21:58,695 --> 01:22:01,198
I knew that I needed to protect you.

702
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:07,120
I kept your DNA hidden here, dormant.

703
01:22:07,746 --> 01:22:10,457
I've waited until now to bring you back.

704
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:11,833
Why?

705
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:17,005
I knew that your strength
would survive with you.

706
01:22:17,381 --> 01:22:21,176
I thought that if I brought you back,
you could reach Trevor.

707
01:22:22,594 --> 01:22:24,221
You always could.

708
01:22:25,556 --> 01:22:28,475
- I have to end it.
- Yes.

709
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,852
Start over.

710
01:22:31,728 --> 01:22:33,230
What about you?

711
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:38,402
I've waited 400 years for this day.

712
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:43,282
I'm tired.

713
01:22:50,789 --> 01:22:52,374
Stay alive, Aeon.

714
01:22:54,585 --> 01:22:56,086
You are needed.

715
01:23:48,305 --> 01:23:49,556
Look!

716
01:24:57,124 --> 01:24:59,126
Now we can move forward...

717
01:25:00,294 --> 01:25:03,714
to live once for real...

718
01:25:05,716 --> 01:25:10,387
and then give way to people
who might do it better.

719
01:25:18,103 --> 01:25:19,855
Hey, Katherine.

720
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:25,402
Will I see you again?

721
01:25:36,121 --> 01:25:37,873
To live only once...

722
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:44,671
but with hope.
