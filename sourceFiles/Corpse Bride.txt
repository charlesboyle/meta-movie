00:01:55.64,00:02:02.01
Here ye, here ye, 10 minutes to go[br]till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.

00:02:18.29,00:02:19.72
Watch it!

00:02:27.97,00:02:30.80
- It's a beautiful day</i>[br]- It's a rather nice day</i>

00:02:30.97,00:02:33.13
A day for a glorious wedding</i>

00:02:33.31,00:02:36.07
A rehearsal, my dear</i>[br]To be perfectly clear</i>

00:02:36.24,00:02:38.64
A rehearsal for a glorious wedding</i>

00:02:38.81,00:02:41.75
Assuming nothing happens</i>[br]That we don't really know</i>

00:02:41.92,00:02:44.32
That nothing unexpected</i>[br]Interferes with the show</i>

00:02:44.48,00:02:46.88
And that's why everything</i>[br]Every last little thing</i>

00:02:47.15,00:02:51.89
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing</i>[br]Must go</i>

00:02:52.06,00:02:54.96
- According to plan</i>[br]- Our son will be married</i>

00:02:55.13,00:02:57.22
- According to plan</i>[br]- Our family carried</i>

00:02:57.40,00:03:01.20
Elevated to the heights of society</i>

00:03:01.50,00:03:03.99
- To the costume balls</i>[br]- In the hallowed halls</i>

00:03:04.17,00:03:06.33
Rubbing elbows with the finest</i>

00:03:06.51,00:03:09.13
Having crumpets with Her Highness</i>

00:03:09.58,00:03:12.10
We'll be there, we'll be seen</i>[br]Having tea with the queen</i>

00:03:12.28,00:03:15.91
We'll forget everything</i>[br]That we've ever, ever been</i>

00:03:17.92,00:03:21.28
- Blimey! It's my dress is caught.[br]- Begging your pardon, ma'am.

00:03:21.45,00:03:24.91
- Come on, dear.[br]- It's not me. It's my dress is caught.

00:03:25.09,00:03:27.92
Where is Victor? We might be late.

00:03:32.90,00:03:34.83
Fish merchants.

00:03:35.27,00:03:37.96
- It's a terrible day</i>[br]- Now, don't be that way</i>

00:03:38.14,00:03:40.66
It's a terrible day for a wedding</i>

00:03:40.84,00:03:43.83
It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in</i>

00:03:44.01,00:03:47.21
That has led to this ominous wedding</i>

00:03:47.38,00:03:49.54
How could our family have come to this?</i>

00:03:50.22,00:03:52.71
To marry off our daughter</i>[br]To the nouveau riche</i>

00:03:52.89,00:03:54.38
- They're so common</i>[br]- So coarse</i>

00:03:54.55,00:03:58.35
- Oh, it couldn't be worse</i>[br]- Couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree</i>

00:03:58.53,00:04:01.19
They could be land-rich,</i>[br]Bankrupt aristocracy</i>

00:04:01.36,00:04:02.76
Without a penny to their name</i>

00:04:02.93,00:04:06.33
Just like you and me</i>

00:04:06.50,00:04:08.26
Oh, dear.

00:04:08.87,00:04:11.74
And that's why everything</i>[br]Every last little thing</i>

00:04:11.91,00:04:16.67
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing</i>[br]Must go</i>

00:04:19.11,00:04:21.91
- According to plan</i>[br]- Our daughter will wed</i>

00:04:22.08,00:04:24.98
- According to plan</i>[br]- Our family led</i>

00:04:25.15,00:04:29.95
From the depths of deepest poverty</i>

00:04:30.89,00:04:33.88
- To the noble realm</i>[br]- Of our ancestry</i>

00:04:34.06,00:04:36.89
And who would have guessed</i>[br]In a million years</i>

00:04:37.06,00:04:40.26
- That our daughter with a face</i>[br]- Of an otter in disgrace</i>

00:04:40.43,00:04:44.96
Would provide our ticket</i>[br]To a rightful place</i>

00:04:51.48,00:04:52.84
Oh, Hildegarde.

00:04:53.01,00:04:56.64
What if Victor and I[br]don't like each other?

00:04:57.68,00:05:00.28
As if that has anything[br]to do with marriage.

00:05:00.45,00:05:04.08
Do you suppose your father and I[br]like each other?

00:05:04.26,00:05:05.78
Surely you must a little?

00:05:06.53,00:05:07.89
- Of course not.[br]- Of course not.

00:05:08.06,00:05:10.00
Get those corsets laced properly.

00:05:10.16,00:05:13.03
I can hear you speak without gasping.

00:05:19.37,00:05:21.70
You've certainly hooked a winner[br]this time, Victor.

00:05:21.88,00:05:25.64
- Now, all you have to do is reel her in.[br]- I'm already reeling, Mother.

00:05:25.81,00:05:28.94
Shouldn't Victoria Everglot[br]be marrying a lord or something?

00:05:29.12,00:05:32.45
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit[br]as good as the Everglots.

00:05:32.62,00:05:36.99
I always knew I deserved better[br]than a fish merchant's life.

00:05:37.16,00:05:39.46
But I've never even spoken to her.

00:05:39.63,00:05:42.22
Well, at least we have that[br]in our favor.

00:05:43.36,00:05:46.39
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.

00:05:51.84,00:05:55.40
Marriage is a partnership,[br]a little tit for tat.

00:05:55.91,00:05:58.34
You'd think a lifetime watching us...

00:05:58.51,00:06:01.21
Might have taught her that</i>

00:06:01.38,00:06:04.51
- Might have taught her that</i>[br]- Everything must be perfect</i>

00:06:04.68,00:06:07.52
- Everything must be perfect</i>[br]- Everything must be perfect</i>

00:06:07.69,00:06:09.35
Perfect</i>[br]That's why everything</i>

00:06:09.52,00:06:10.92
Every last little thing</i>

00:06:11.09,00:06:15.25
Every single, tiny, microscopic little thing</i>[br]Must go</i>

00:06:15.43,00:06:19.39
According to plan</i>

00:06:21.60,00:06:23.09
Look at the way you're standing.

00:06:23.27,00:06:26.03
You look like you got rickets[br]or something...

00:06:34.05,00:06:39.78
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur![br]Such impeccable taste!

00:06:39.95,00:06:41.82
Oh, beautiful, innit?

00:06:43.96,00:06:45.58
It's not as big as our place, dear.

00:06:49.10,00:06:51.46
- Bit shabby really, isn't it?[br]- Shut up.

00:06:51.63,00:06:54.40
Lord and Lady Everglot...

00:06:54.57,00:06:58.23
...Mr. And Mrs. Van Dort.

00:06:58.40,00:07:00.90
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.

00:07:01.54,00:07:05.77
Yes, I must say, you don't look a day[br]over 20. No. Oh, yes.

00:07:06.85,00:07:09.58
Smile, darling, smile.

00:07:14.15,00:07:18.72
Well, hello. What a pleasure.[br]Welcome to our home.

00:07:19.26,00:07:20.49
Thank you.

00:07:20.66,00:07:23.99
We'll be taking tea[br]in the west drawing room.

00:07:25.47,00:07:28.03
Oh, do come this way,[br]it's just through there.

00:07:28.20,00:07:32.43
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.[br]Who is your decorator?

00:07:32.61,00:07:34.63
Nice tiles, shame about the drapes.

00:07:34.81,00:07:38.30
My husband says such foolish things.[br]Ignore him.

00:07:38.81,00:07:40.90
Yes, it's usually best.

00:09:09.34,00:09:12.90
- Do forgive me.[br]- You play beautifully.

00:09:13.07,00:09:18.34
I... I... I do apologize, Miss Everglot.[br]How rude of me to... Well...

00:09:19.08,00:09:20.57
Excuse me.

00:09:22.52,00:09:24.28
Mother won't let me near the piano.

00:09:25.02,00:09:28.28
Music is improper for a young lady.

00:09:28.45,00:09:30.01
Too passionate, she says.

00:09:30.19,00:09:34.99
If I may ask, Miss Everglot...

00:09:35.16,00:09:37.46
...where is your chaperon?

00:09:38.00,00:09:42.33
Perhaps, in...[br]In view of the circumstances...

00:09:42.90,00:09:45.67
...you could call me Victoria.

00:09:46.14,00:09:47.80
Yes, of course. Well...

00:09:48.61,00:09:52.04
- Victoria...[br]- Yes, Victor.

00:09:53.28,00:09:55.94
Tomorrow, we are to be m...

00:09:57.55,00:09:58.88
M... M...

00:09:59.32,00:10:03.45
- Married.[br]- Yes. Married.

00:10:04.89,00:10:08.95
Since I was a child, I've...[br]I've dreamt of my wedding day.

00:10:09.56,00:10:12.50
I always hoped to find someone[br]I was deeply in love with.

00:10:13.03,00:10:15.87
Someone to spend[br]the rest of my life with.

00:10:16.40,00:10:19.20
- Silly, isn't it?[br]- Yes, silly.

00:10:19.74,00:10:22.67
No. No, not at all, no.

00:10:23.31,00:10:25.83
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

00:10:31.78,00:10:34.45
What impropriety is this?

00:10:34.62,00:10:36.61
You shouldn't be alone together.

00:10:36.79,00:10:41.32
Here it is, one minute before 5,[br]and you're not at the rehearsal.

00:10:41.49,00:10:45.95
Pastor Galswells is waiting.[br]Come at once.

00:10:48.67,00:10:51.57
Master Van Dort,</i>[br]from the beginning. Again.</i>

00:10:51.74,00:10:57.01
"With this hand,[br]I will lift your sorrows.

00:10:57.34,00:11:03.21
Your cup will never empty,[br]for I will be your wine.

00:11:03.38,00:11:09.41
With this candle,[br]I will light your way in darkness.

00:11:09.59,00:11:14.65
With this ring, I ask you to be mine."

00:11:16.00,00:11:19.26
- Let's try it again.[br]- Yes. Yes, sir.

00:11:19.43,00:11:21.83
With this candle...

00:11:24.24,00:11:26.07
This candle...

00:11:27.54,00:11:29.17
This candle.

00:11:30.01,00:11:33.97
- Shall I get up there and do it for him?[br]- Don't get all aflutter, dear.

00:11:39.79,00:11:41.91
With this candle...

00:11:43.79,00:11:45.02
Continue!

00:11:47.43,00:11:49.29
Get the door, Emil.

00:11:50.06,00:11:53.69
Let's just pick it up at the candle bit.

00:11:55.77,00:11:58.13
A Lord Barkis, sir.

00:12:01.97,00:12:04.34
I haven't a head for dates.

00:12:04.51,00:12:07.50
Apparently,[br]I'm a day early for the ceremony.

00:12:08.71,00:12:12.81
- Is he from your side of the family?[br]- I can't recall.

00:12:12.99,00:12:15.61
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.

00:12:21.06,00:12:22.79
Do carry on.

00:12:23.50,00:12:28.37
Let's try it again, shall we,[br]Master Van Dort?

00:12:28.53,00:12:32.73
- Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly.[br]- Right.

00:12:32.91,00:12:35.81
Right. Oh, right!

00:12:35.98,00:12:40.14
- With this... This...[br]- Hand.

00:12:40.31,00:12:43.21
With this hand...

00:12:43.38,00:12:44.87
...I... With...

00:12:45.05,00:12:47.32
Three steps, three!

00:12:47.49,00:12:51.95
Can you not count? Do you not wish[br]to be married, Master Van Dort?

00:12:52.12,00:12:53.82
- No! No.[br]- You do not?

00:12:53.99,00:12:57.99
No! I meant, no,[br]I do not not wish to be married.

00:12:58.16,00:13:00.56
That is, I want very much to...

00:13:00.73,00:13:05.00
Pay attention! Have you[br]even remembered to bring the ring?

00:13:05.17,00:13:07.80
The ring? Yes. Of course.

00:13:11.34,00:13:13.61
- Dropping the ring.[br]- Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!

00:13:13.78,00:13:17.51
- This boy doesn't want to get married.[br]- How disgraceful!

00:13:17.92,00:13:19.58
Excuse me. Got it!

00:13:23.26,00:13:25.49
Out of the way, you ninny.

00:13:26.33,00:13:30.99
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a[br]woman on fire! Help! Emergency!

00:13:32.30,00:13:37.03
- Oh, I hope it doesn't stain.[br]- Stop fanning it, you fool.

00:13:40.37,00:13:44.97
- Get a bucket, get a bucket.[br]- I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!

00:13:53.02,00:13:58.92
Enough! This wedding cannot take place[br]until he is properly prepared.

00:14:00.53,00:14:06.06
Young man, learn your vows.

00:14:20.41,00:14:24.75
Well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?

00:14:39.50,00:14:41.19
Oh, Victoria.

00:14:41.67,00:14:45.60
She must think I'm such a fool.[br]This day couldn't get any worse.

00:14:45.77,00:14:51.87
Hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins[br]as Van Dort boy causes chaos!

00:14:52.98,00:14:56.94
Fishy fiancé could be canned!

00:14:57.12,00:15:02.78
Everglots all fired up[br]as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!

00:15:04.39,00:15:06.95
It really shouldn't be all that difficult.

00:15:07.13,00:15:09.29
It's just a few simple vows.

00:15:09.46,00:15:13.52
With this hand, I will take your wine.

00:15:13.70,00:15:15.10
No.

00:15:16.37,00:15:18.03
With this hand...

00:15:18.20,00:15:19.87
...I will cup your...

00:15:20.04,00:15:21.60
Oh, goodness, no.

00:15:23.41,00:15:25.67
With this...

00:15:26.18,00:15:27.74
With this...

00:15:27.91,00:15:30.47
With this candle, I will...

00:15:32.22,00:15:33.74
I will...

00:15:34.42,00:15:36.55
I will set your mother on fire.

00:15:38.46,00:15:40.15
Oh, it's no use.

00:15:52.74,00:15:57.33
With this hand,[br]I will lift your sorrows.

00:15:57.51,00:16:02.17
Your cup will never empty,[br]for I will be your wine.

00:16:03.88,00:16:05.15
Mrs. Everglot.

00:16:05.79,00:16:08.02
You look ravishing this evening.

00:16:08.85,00:16:13.95
What's that, Mr. Everglot?[br]Call you "Dad"? If you insist, sir.

00:16:14.13,00:16:18.62
With this candle,[br]I will light your way in darkness.

00:16:19.13,00:16:20.79
With this ring...

00:16:21.57,00:16:25.16
...I ask you to be mine.

00:17:18.62,00:17:19.82
I do.

00:18:48.48,00:18:51.45
You may kiss the bride.

00:18:58.49,00:19:01.65
- A new arrival.[br]- He must've fainted.

00:19:01.83,00:19:04.63
- Are you all right?[br]- What..? What happened?

00:19:04.80,00:19:07.86
By Jove, man. Looks like[br]we've got ourselves a breather.

00:19:08.30,00:19:11.17
- Does he have a dead brother?[br]- He's still soft.

00:19:14.17,00:19:15.80
A toast, then.

00:19:21.51,00:19:23.11
To the newlyweds.

00:19:23.28,00:19:24.51
Newlyweds?

00:19:25.48,00:19:29.58
In the woods,[br]you said your vows so perfectly.

00:19:29.76,00:19:31.35
I did?

00:19:31.52,00:19:32.96
I did.

00:19:33.13,00:19:35.36
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

00:19:37.40,00:19:40.42
Coming through, coming through.

00:19:40.60,00:19:43.47
My name is Paul, I am the head waiter.

00:19:44.54,00:19:47.60
I will be creating your wedding feast.

00:19:47.84,00:19:50.21
Wedding feast! I'm salivating.

00:19:51.18,00:19:52.40
Maggots.

00:19:55.31,00:19:56.91
Keep away!

00:20:02.19,00:20:05.55
I've got a...[br]I've got a dwarf.

00:20:05.72,00:20:09.02
And I'm not afraid to use him.[br]I want some questions. Now!

00:20:09.19,00:20:13.15
- Answers. I think you mean "answers."[br]- Thank you, yes, answers.

00:20:13.33,00:20:16.93
I need answers.[br]What's going on here? Where am I?

00:20:17.10,00:20:18.23
Who are you?

00:20:18.40,00:20:21.77
Well, that's kind of a long story.

00:20:22.21,00:20:24.54
What a story it is.

00:20:24.71,00:20:28.27
A tragic tale of romance, passion...

00:20:28.45,00:20:30.24
...and murder most foul.

00:20:30.42,00:20:32.01
This is gonna be good.

00:20:34.12,00:20:35.78
Hit it, boys.

00:20:46.43,00:20:50.03
Hey, give me a listen</i>[br]You corpses of cheer</i>

00:20:50.20,00:20:52.93
At least those of you</i>[br]Who still got an ear</i>

00:20:53.11,00:20:55.90
I'll tell you a story</i>[br]Make a skeleton cry</i>

00:20:56.08,00:20:59.57
Of our own jubiliciously</i>[br]Lovely Corpse Bride</i>

00:20:59.75,00:21:02.15
Die, die, we all pass away</i>

00:21:02.31,00:21:05.08
But don't wear a frown</i>[br]Because it's really okay</i>

00:21:05.25,00:21:07.78
You might try and hide</i>[br]And you might try and pray</i>

00:21:07.95,00:21:11.05
But we all end up</i>[br]The remains of the day</i>

00:21:12.29,00:21:13.62
That's right.

00:21:16.46,00:21:19.95
Well, our girl was a beauty</i>[br]Known for miles around</i>

00:21:20.13,00:21:23.07
When a mysterious stranger</i>[br]Came into town</i>

00:21:23.24,00:21:25.86
He was plenty good-looking</i>[br]But down on his cash</i>

00:21:26.04,00:21:28.94
And our poor little baby</i>[br]She fell hard and fast</i>

00:21:29.11,00:21:31.94
When her daddy said no</i>[br]She just couldn't cope</i>

00:21:32.11,00:21:34.67
So our lovers came up</i>[br]With a plan to elope</i>

00:21:35.38,00:21:37.82
Die, die, we all pass away</i>

00:21:37.98,00:21:41.08
But don't wear a frown</i>[br]Because it's really okay</i>

00:21:41.25,00:21:43.78
You might try and hide</i>[br]And you might try and pray</i>

00:21:43.96,00:21:47.12
But we all end up</i>[br]The remains of the day</i>

00:22:03.91,00:22:05.40
That's right.

00:22:05.94,00:22:09.64
Okay. Oh, yeah.[br]Come on, boys, pick it up.

00:22:10.52,00:22:13.58
Yeah. Like it.

00:22:13.75,00:22:15.65
Okay, Chancy, take it.

00:22:17.89,00:22:19.15
Yeah.

00:22:28.80,00:22:30.36
Yeah!

00:22:34.31,00:22:36.21
That's nice.

00:22:38.01,00:22:40.81
So they conjured up a plan</i>[br]To meet late at night</i>

00:22:40.98,00:22:43.35
They told not a soul</i>[br]Kept the whole thing tight</i>

00:22:43.52,00:22:46.04
Now, her mother's wedding dress</i>[br]Fit like a glove</i>

00:22:46.22,00:22:48.78
You don't need much</i>[br]When you're really in love</i>

00:22:48.95,00:22:51.29
Except for a few things</i>[br]Or so I'm told</i>

00:22:51.46,00:22:54.05
Like the family jewels</i>[br]And a satchel of gold</i>

00:22:54.23,00:22:56.72
Then next to the graveyard</i>[br]By the old oak tree</i>

00:22:56.90,00:22:59.16
On a dark foggy night</i>[br]At a quarter to 3</i>

00:22:59.33,00:23:02.77
She was ready to go</i>[br]But where was he?</i>

00:23:03.44,00:23:04.77
And then?</i>

00:23:05.04,00:23:06.87
- She waited</i>[br]- And then?</i>

00:23:07.04,00:23:09.91
- There in the shadows, was it her man?</i>[br]- And then?</i>

00:23:10.08,00:23:13.51
- Her little heart beat so loud</i>[br]- And then?</i>

00:23:13.98,00:23:17.81
And then, baby, everything went black</i>

00:23:18.28,00:23:21.31
Now, when she opened her eyes</i>[br]She was dead as dust</i>

00:23:21.49,00:23:24.35
Her jewels were missing</i>[br]And her heart was bust</i>

00:23:24.52,00:23:27.08
So she made a vow</i>[br]Lying under that tree</i>

00:23:27.26,00:23:30.06
That she'd wait for her true love</i>[br]To come set her free</i>

00:23:30.23,00:23:33.06
Always waiting for someone</i>[br]To ask for her hand</i>

00:23:33.70,00:23:36.57
Then out of the blue</i>[br]Comes this groovy young man</i>

00:23:36.74,00:23:39.47
Who vows forever</i>[br]To be by her side</i>

00:23:39.64,00:23:43.47
And that's the story</i>[br]Of our Corpse Bride</i>

00:23:43.64,00:23:45.41
Die, die, we all pass away</i>

00:23:45.58,00:23:48.34
But don't wear a frown,</i>[br]Because it's really okay</i>

00:23:48.51,00:23:51.31
You might try and hide</i>[br]And you might try and pray</i>

00:23:51.48,00:23:57.08
But we all end up</i>[br]The remains of the day</i>

00:23:57.56,00:23:58.85
Yeah.

00:24:10.54,00:24:13.20
Victoria, come away from the window.

00:24:14.47,00:24:16.50
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly.

00:24:16.68,00:24:19.87
He's terrified of the dark.[br]In fact, when he was a boy...

00:24:20.05,00:24:24.11
...he used to wet his combinations[br]regularly, didn't he, William?

00:24:24.28,00:24:25.48
Enter.

00:24:29.35,00:24:33.45
Lord Barkis.[br]I trust the room is to your liking.

00:24:33.63,00:24:37.19
Thank you,[br]you are a most gracious hostess.

00:24:37.36,00:24:43.49
Which is why it pains me[br]to be the bearer of such bad news.

00:24:47.64,00:24:51.27
Would you care[br]to repeat tonight's headline for us?

00:24:51.44,00:24:53.43
Hear ye, hear ye!

00:24:53.75,00:24:58.21
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the[br]bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!

00:24:58.38,00:25:02.84
The dark-haired temptress and Master[br]Van Dort slipped away into the night!

00:25:03.02,00:25:04.89
And now, the weather.[br]Scattered showers...

00:25:05.06,00:25:07.53
Enough! That will be all.

00:25:10.50,00:25:14.02
Mystery woman?[br]He doesn't even know any women!

00:25:14.20,00:25:16.26
Or so you thought.

00:25:17.14,00:25:19.54
Do call for me[br]if you need my assistance...

00:25:20.91,00:25:22.77
...in any way.

00:25:24.28,00:25:27.21
Good heavens, Finis,[br]what should we do?

00:25:27.38,00:25:28.87
Fetch me musket.

00:25:29.05,00:25:30.48
William, do something.

00:25:30.65,00:25:33.17
The town crier[br]probably just had a slow news day.

00:25:33.35,00:25:36.15
You know how it is,[br]you need a little something to cry about.

00:25:36.32,00:25:40.82
Regardless, we are one groom short[br]for the wedding tomorrow.

00:25:40.99,00:25:44.16
Not to mention[br]the financial implications.

00:25:44.33,00:25:47.13
A most scandalous embarrassment[br]for us all.

00:25:47.30,00:25:50.74
Oh, give us a chance to find him,[br]we beg of you.

00:25:50.90,00:25:54.74
- Just give us until dawn.[br]- Very well. Till dawn.

00:25:55.44,00:25:58.90
Victor, darling, where are you?

00:25:59.34,00:26:03.01
If you ask me,</i>[br]your boyfriend is kind of jumpy.</i>

00:26:03.18,00:26:05.58
He's not my boyfriend,[br]he's my husband.

00:26:05.75,00:26:08.19
Victor, where have you gone?

00:26:08.52,00:26:10.22
I'll keep an eye out for him.

00:26:10.69,00:26:11.68
Victor?

00:26:15.93,00:26:18.92
There he goes, there he goes![br]He's... He's getting away!

00:26:19.10,00:26:21.16
Quick, quick, after him!

00:26:21.33,00:26:22.56
Victor.

00:26:28.24,00:26:29.23
Thank you.

00:26:29.57,00:26:30.97
Victor!

00:26:31.51,00:26:33.50
Where are you?

00:26:35.51,00:26:37.04
Victor?

00:26:37.72,00:26:39.74
Where have you gone?

00:26:40.29,00:26:42.85
Married, huh? I'm a widow.

00:26:43.02,00:26:45.82
Oh, how rude. He went that way!

00:26:47.53,00:26:49.22
Victor.

00:26:50.50,00:26:52.26
Victor, darling.

00:26:53.80,00:26:57.50
Please. There's been a mistake.[br]I'm not dead.

00:27:01.21,00:27:04.00
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:27:04.94,00:27:06.07
- Excuse me.[br]- Excuse me.

00:27:06.61,00:27:08.14
- Thank you.[br]- Thank you.

00:27:08.95,00:27:10.41
Victor.

00:27:12.38,00:27:15.44
- Dead end.[br]- Victor!

00:27:15.75,00:27:17.19
Hello!

00:27:25.76,00:27:28.29
Could have used the stairs, silly.

00:27:30.77,00:27:34.97
Isn't the view beautiful?[br]It takes my breath away.

00:27:36.17,00:27:38.44
Well, it would if I had any.

00:27:40.11,00:27:42.31
Isn't it romantic?

00:27:49.76,00:27:52.99
Look, I am terribly sorry[br]about what's happened to you...

00:27:53.16,00:27:56.46
...and I'd like to help,[br]but I really need to get home.

00:27:56.63,00:27:59.79
- This is your home now.[br]- But I don't even know your name.

00:27:59.97,00:28:03.42
Well, that's a great way</i>[br]to start a marriage.</i>

00:28:03.60,00:28:05.00
Shut up!

00:28:07.01,00:28:09.87
- It's Emily.[br]- Emily.

00:28:10.04,00:28:13.88
Oh, I almost forgot.[br]I have something for you.

00:28:14.85,00:28:16.84
It's a wedding present.

00:28:29.96,00:28:31.26
Thank you.

00:28:53.19,00:28:54.45
Scraps?

00:28:56.86,00:28:58.29
Scraps!

00:28:58.86,00:29:00.42
My dog, Scraps!

00:29:02.93,00:29:05.90
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.

00:29:06.06,00:29:08.23
I knew you'd be happy to see him.

00:29:08.40,00:29:12.60
Who's my good boy?[br]Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.

00:29:12.77,00:29:16.04
Good boy, Scraps.[br]Roll over. Roll over.

00:29:16.21,00:29:19.11
Good boy, Scraps.[br]Play dead.

00:29:20.88,00:29:22.28
Sorry.

00:29:22.71,00:29:24.34
Oh, what a cutie.

00:29:24.52,00:29:26.58
You should have seen him with fur.

00:29:27.42,00:29:30.29
Mother never approved[br]of Scraps jumping up like this.

00:29:30.46,00:29:33.89
But then again,[br]she never approved of anything.

00:29:34.39,00:29:36.88
Do you think[br]she would have approved of me?

00:29:37.20,00:29:39.60
You're lucky[br]you'll never have to meet her.

00:29:41.83,00:29:43.13
Well, actually...

00:29:44.57,00:29:48.40
...now that you mention it,[br]I think you should.

00:29:48.57,00:29:51.57
In fact, since we're, you know...

00:29:52.61,00:29:55.31
...married,[br]you should definitely meet her.

00:29:55.71,00:29:58.48
And my father too. We should go[br]and see them right now.

00:29:58.65,00:30:01.41
What a fantastic idea![br]Where are they buried?

00:30:03.32,00:30:06.48
- What? What is it?[br]- They're not from around here.

00:30:06.66,00:30:08.18
Where are they?

00:30:09.13,00:30:10.82
Oh, they're still alive.

00:30:11.00,00:30:13.12
- I'm afraid so.[br]- Well, that is a problem.

00:30:13.30,00:30:14.66
What's that, Scraps?

00:30:16.00,00:30:17.97
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.

00:30:19.87,00:30:23.64
- Oh, well, if you put it like that.[br]- What?

00:30:23.98,00:30:25.53
Elder Gutknecht.

00:30:34.99,00:30:35.98
Scraps.

00:30:36.15,00:30:38.49
Elder Gutknecht...

00:30:38.89,00:30:40.38
...are you there?

00:30:43.43,00:30:46.36
Hello? Is anyone home?

00:30:47.23,00:30:48.70
Hello?

00:31:00.08,00:31:01.81
There you are!

00:31:02.48,00:31:04.88
Oh, my dear. There you are.

00:31:05.05,00:31:07.48
I've brought my husband, Victor.

00:31:07.65,00:31:10.45
What's that? Husband?

00:31:10.82,00:31:13.05
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

00:31:13.86,00:31:18.30
We need to go up. Upstairs?[br]To visit the land of the living.

00:31:18.46,00:31:20.69
Land of the living?

00:31:23.27,00:31:24.73
Oh, my dear.

00:31:24.90,00:31:26.70
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

00:31:26.87,00:31:30.70
Now, why go up there, when[br]people are dying to get down here?

00:31:30.87,00:31:33.93
Sir, I beg you to help.[br]It means so much to me...

00:31:35.08,00:31:39.17
- Us.[br]- I don't know, it's just not natural.

00:31:39.35,00:31:41.25
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

00:31:41.42,00:31:44.05
Surely there must be something[br]you can do.

00:31:46.02,00:31:48.62
Let me see what I can do.

00:31:48.96,00:31:51.86
Where did I put that book?

00:31:58.53,00:32:00.76
I left it here somewhere.

00:32:04.17,00:32:06.27
There's the one.

00:32:19.99,00:32:21.58
I have it.

00:32:21.99,00:32:26.66
A Ukrainian haunting spell.[br]Just the thing for these quick trips.

00:32:27.30,00:32:31.06
- So glad you thought of this.[br]- Me too.

00:32:54.66,00:32:56.06
Now, then...

00:32:57.26,00:32:58.66
...where were we?

00:32:59.90,00:33:01.95
The Ukrainian haunting spell?

00:33:11.14,00:33:14.04
Here we have it. Ready?

00:33:14.21,00:33:18.15
Just remember, when you[br]want to come back, say "Hopscotch."

00:33:18.31,00:33:21.04
- Hopscotch?[br]- That's it.

00:33:37.57,00:33:39.80
I spent so long in the darkness...

00:33:39.97,00:33:44.67
...I’d almost forgotten how beautiful[br]the moonlight is.

00:34:11.93,00:34:14.23
Hey, I think you dropped something.

00:34:33.39,00:34:34.98
Hold on, hold on.

00:34:36.99,00:34:41.33
I think I should prepare Mother[br]and Father for the big news.

00:34:43.03,00:34:44.97
I'll go ahead and you...

00:34:45.80,00:34:47.27
...wait here.

00:34:47.87,00:34:50.46
- Perfect.[br]- I won't be long.

00:34:51.34,00:34:54.24
Stay right here. I'll be right back.

00:34:54.41,00:34:55.97
Okay.

00:34:56.71,00:34:58.41
No peeking.

00:35:17.67,00:35:20.60
If ever I see that Van Dort boy...

00:35:20.77,00:35:24.03
...I'll strangle him with my bare hands.

00:35:24.21,00:35:28.37
Your hands are too fat,[br]and his neck is too thin.

00:35:28.54,00:35:30.91
You'll have to use a rope.

00:35:40.79,00:35:45.62
This is the voice of your conscience.</i>[br]Listen to what I say.</i>

00:35:45.79,00:35:49.99
I have a bad feeling about that boy.</i>[br]You know he is no...</i>

00:35:52.10,00:35:54.47
Go chew someone else's ear for a while.

00:35:54.64,00:35:58.37
Victor has gone to see his parents,[br]just like he said.

00:35:59.01,00:36:02.88
If I hadn't just been sitting in it,[br]I would say that you had lost your mind!

00:36:03.05,00:36:07.51
I'm sure he has a perfectly[br]good reason for taking so long.

00:36:07.68,00:36:10.88
I am sure he does.[br]Why don't you go ask him?

00:36:11.05,00:36:12.11
All right, I will.

00:36:12.29,00:36:16.85
After all, he couldn't get far[br]with those cold feet.

00:36:55.33,00:36:59.32
- Victoria.[br]- Victor? I'm so happy to see you.

00:36:59.50,00:37:03.49
Come by the fire. Where have you been?[br]Are you all right?

00:37:04.04,00:37:05.70
I... I...

00:37:05.91,00:37:07.24
Oh, dear.

00:37:08.08,00:37:11.67
You're as cold as death.[br]What's happened to you?

00:37:11.85,00:37:13.71
Your coat.

00:37:14.52,00:37:17.42
Victoria, I confess.

00:37:18.65,00:37:21.78
This morning[br]I was terrified of marriage.

00:37:23.33,00:37:27.82
But then, on meeting you,[br]I felt I should be with you always...

00:37:28.00,00:37:32.19
...and that our wedding[br]could not come soon enough.

00:37:35.17,00:37:38.61
Victor, I feel the same.

00:37:43.51,00:37:46.14
Victoria, I se... I se...

00:37:46.32,00:37:48.88
I seem to find myself married.

00:37:49.05,00:37:51.78
And you should know it's unexpected.

00:37:55.66,00:37:57.96
My darling,[br]I just wanted to meet...

00:38:00.73,00:38:03.39
Darling? Who's this?

00:38:03.57,00:38:07.00
- Who is she?[br]- I'm his wife.

00:38:08.44,00:38:10.96
- Victor?[br]- Victoria, wait. You don't understand.

00:38:11.44,00:38:13.67
She's dead. Look.

00:38:17.35,00:38:18.64
Hopscotch.

00:38:21.52,00:38:24.32
No! No! Victoria!

00:38:29.19,00:38:31.16
You lied to me!

00:38:31.33,00:38:33.82
Just to get back to that other woman.

00:38:34.00,00:38:36.93
Don't you understand?[br]You're the other woman.

00:38:37.10,00:38:41.63
No! You're married to me.[br]She's the other woman.

00:38:45.27,00:38:47.04
She's got a point.

00:38:47.71,00:38:52.87
And I thought... I thought[br]this was all going so well.

00:39:01.72,00:39:05.02
Look, I'm sorry, but...

00:39:05.19,00:39:06.66
...this just can't work.

00:39:06.83,00:39:08.76
Why not?

00:39:09.77,00:39:11.96
It's my eye, isn't it?

00:39:12.13,00:39:13.80
No. Your eye is...

00:39:14.90,00:39:16.20
...lovely.

00:39:17.11,00:39:21.44
Listen, under different circumstances,[br]well, who knows?

00:39:21.84,00:39:26.21
But we're just too different.[br]I mean, you're dead.

00:39:26.38,00:39:29.41
You should've thought about that[br]before you asked me to marry you.

00:39:29.59,00:39:33.11
Why can't you understand? It was[br]a mistake. I would never marry you.

00:40:03.52,00:40:06.22
Roses for eternal love.

00:40:07.29,00:40:09.69
Lilies for sweetness.

00:40:12.46,00:40:14.02
Baby's breath.

00:40:19.84,00:40:21.43
Why so blue?

00:40:21.60,00:40:24.66
Maybe he's right.[br]Maybe we are too different.

00:40:24.84,00:40:27.43
Maybe he should</i>[br]have his head examined.</i>

00:40:28.98,00:40:30.77
I could do it.

00:40:30.95,00:40:34.44
Or perhaps he does belong with her.[br]Little Miss Living.

00:40:34.62,00:40:37.98
With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.

00:40:38.49,00:40:42.69
Oh, those girls are ten a penny.[br]You've got so much more.

00:40:42.86,00:40:45.16
You've got... You've got...

00:40:45.33,00:40:47.82
You've got a wonderful personality.

00:40:54.90,00:40:59.34
What does that wispy little brat have</i>[br]That you don't have double?</i>

00:40:59.51,00:41:03.14
She can't hold a candle</i>[br]To the beauty of your smile</i>

00:41:03.31,00:41:04.57
How about a pulse?

00:41:04.75,00:41:06.08
Overrated by a mile</i>

00:41:06.25,00:41:07.51
- Overvalued</i>[br]- Overblown</i>

00:41:07.75,00:41:11.52
If he only knew</i>[br]The you that we know</i>

00:41:12.82,00:41:15.79
And that silly little creature</i>[br]Isn't wearing his ring</i>

00:41:15.96,00:41:19.36
And she doesn't play piano</i>[br]Or dance, or sing</i>

00:41:19.53,00:41:21.29
No, she doesn't compare</i>

00:41:21.46,00:41:23.73
- But she still breathes air</i>[br]- Who cares?</i>

00:41:23.90,00:41:25.16
- Unimportant</i>[br]- Overrated</i>

00:41:25.33,00:41:27.53
- Overblown</i>[br]- lf only he could see</i>

00:41:27.70,00:41:29.33
How special you can be</i>

00:41:29.50,00:41:33.53
If he only knew</i>[br]The you that we know</i>

00:41:39.38,00:41:44.32
If I touch a burning candle</i>[br]I can feel no pain</i>

00:41:45.05,00:41:48.78
If you cut me with a knife</i>[br]It's still the same</i>

00:41:50.53,00:41:53.49
And I know her heart is beating</i>

00:41:54.03,00:41:56.43
And I know that I am dead</i>

00:41:56.90,00:41:59.26
Yet the pain here that I feel</i>

00:41:59.94,00:42:02.50
Try and tell me it's not real</i>

00:42:03.11,00:42:07.54
And it seems that I still have</i>[br]A tear to shed</i>

00:42:12.01,00:42:15.28
The sole redeeming feature</i>[br]From that little creature</i>

00:42:15.45,00:42:16.82
Is that she's alive</i>

00:42:16.99,00:42:18.61
- Overrated</i>[br]- Overblown</i>

00:42:18.79,00:42:21.81
Everybody knows</i>[br]That's just a temporary state</i>

00:42:21.99,00:42:25.19
Which is cured very quickly</i>[br]When we meet our fate</i>

00:42:25.36,00:42:26.88
- Who cares?</i>[br]- Unimportant</i>

00:42:27.06,00:42:28.43
- Overrated</i>[br]- Overblown</i>

00:42:28.60,00:42:31.86
If only he could see</i>[br]How special you can be</i>

00:42:32.03,00:42:36.49
If he only knew</i>[br]The you that we know</i>

00:42:41.78,00:42:47.11
If I touch a burning candle</i>[br]I can feel no pain</i>

00:42:47.52,00:42:51.54
In the ice or in the sun</i>[br]It's all the same</i>

00:42:53.32,00:42:55.98
Yet I feel my heart is aching</i>

00:42:56.49,00:42:59.29
Though it doesn't beat, it's breaking</i>

00:42:59.46,00:43:01.99
And the pain here that I feel</i>

00:43:02.43,00:43:04.70
Try and tell me it's not real</i>

00:43:05.50,00:43:08.16
I know that I am dead</i>

00:43:09.10,00:43:13.56
Yet it seems that I still have</i>[br]Some tears to shed</i>

00:43:22.68,00:43:24.62
It's true, Mother!

00:43:24.79,00:43:27.55
Victor is married to a dead woman.

00:43:27.72,00:43:32.49
I saw her. A corpse![br]Standing right here with Victor.

00:43:32.66,00:43:34.22
Victor was in your room?

00:43:34.40,00:43:35.76
I have to help him.

00:43:35.93,00:43:37.46
The scandal!

00:43:37.63,00:43:41.47
Come sit in your chair, dearie.[br]You're shaking like a leaf.

00:43:41.64,00:43:43.66
Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.

00:43:43.84,00:43:47.24
Fetch her a straitjacket![br]She's completely mad!

00:43:47.41,00:43:49.27
Come, Hildegarde.

00:44:22.54,00:44:25.48
Finis, come to bed at once.

00:44:46.23,00:44:49.20
What in heaven's name?

00:44:51.81,00:44:54.80
Who could that be at this hour?

00:44:56.34,00:44:57.61
Miss Everglot.

00:44:58.05,00:45:02.31
What are you doing here? You should be[br]at home, prostrate with grief.

00:45:02.48,00:45:05.18
Pastor Galswells,[br]I have to ask you something.

00:45:05.35,00:45:08.75
- This is most irregular.[br]- Please, I beg of you.

00:45:08.92,00:45:13.42
You are the only one in the village who[br]knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

00:45:13.60,00:45:16.33
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.

00:45:16.63,00:45:21.47
It is a bride I fear,[br]which is why I must know:

00:45:22.00,00:45:24.20
Can the living marry the dead?

00:45:24.47,00:45:27.24
What on earth are you speaking about?

00:45:27.41,00:45:30.38
Please, it's Victor.[br]He's married to a corpse.

00:45:30.81,00:45:33.04
He has a corpse bride!

00:45:33.22,00:45:36.91
There must be some way[br]to undo what's been done.

00:45:39.32,00:45:42.29
I believe I know the thing to do.

00:45:42.99,00:45:44.32
Come with me.

00:45:47.13,00:45:49.62
Victoria? Where are your corsets?

00:45:49.80,00:45:53.50
She's speaking in tongues.[br]Of unholy alliances.

00:45:53.67,00:45:55.93
Her mind has come undone, I fear.

00:45:56.10,00:45:58.23
It's not true! Let me go! Let me go!

00:45:58.41,00:46:03.11
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.[br]Thank you so very much.

00:46:03.75,00:46:05.08
Take her to her room!

00:46:05.25,00:46:07.68
No, I'm telling the truth.

00:46:07.85,00:46:09.71
Victor needs my help.

00:46:09.89,00:46:12.12
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?

00:46:12.29,00:46:15.22
- Mother, Father, please.[br]- Seal the doors...

00:46:15.39,00:46:19.85
...and bar the windows. See to it that[br]she doesn't escape again.

00:46:20.13,00:46:24.43
He needs our help! Oh, let me go![br]Let me go!

00:46:24.60,00:46:28.63
Will the mortification never cease?

00:46:28.80,00:46:32.00
It will be years before we can show[br]ourselves in public again.

00:46:32.17,00:46:33.44
What shall we do?

00:46:33.61,00:46:37.24
We shall continue as planned,[br]with or without Vincent.

00:46:37.41,00:46:39.68
- Victor.[br]- Whatever.

00:46:39.85,00:46:44.58
For that boy to toss aside[br]a young woman like Victoria...

00:46:44.75,00:46:46.78
...it's positively criminal.

00:46:46.96,00:46:51.15
Why, if I had a woman[br]like your daughter on my arm...

00:46:51.33,00:46:55.92
...I would lavish her with riches[br]befitting royalty.

00:46:56.10,00:46:59.76
Your lady wife[br]is a most fortunate woman.

00:46:59.94,00:47:02.80
Alas, I am not married.

00:47:02.97,00:47:04.84
I was betrothed some years ago...

00:47:05.01,00:47:08.94
...but tragedy snatched[br]my young bride away.

00:47:09.18,00:47:13.17
When one lives alone,[br]wealth counts for naught.

00:47:21.29,00:47:25.19
Marvelous news, Victoria,[br]there'll be a wedding after all.

00:47:25.36,00:47:26.66
You found him?

00:47:26.83,00:47:30.29
Make haste, my dear,[br]our relatives will arrive at any moment.

00:47:30.47,00:47:34.27
We must have you looking presentable[br]for Lord Barkis.

00:47:35.94,00:47:37.20
Lord Barkis?

00:47:37.37,00:47:38.90
He will make a fine husband.

00:47:39.07,00:47:42.41
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.

00:47:42.58,00:47:44.84
A far better prospect this time.

00:47:45.01,00:47:48.71
But I do not love him.[br]You cannot make me do this.

00:47:48.88,00:47:51.75
- We must.[br]- Please, I beg of you.

00:47:51.92,00:47:53.35
There must be another way.

00:47:53.52,00:47:55.46
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis...

00:47:55.62,00:47:58.11
...we shall be forced,[br]penniless, into the street.

00:47:58.29,00:47:59.73
We are destitute.

00:48:00.16,00:48:01.86
But Victor...

00:48:02.03,00:48:04.56
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.

00:48:04.73,00:48:07.76
You shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.

00:48:10.51,00:48:12.70
- According to plan.[br]- According to plan.

00:48:41.44,00:48:45.10
Oh, my dear.[br]Oh, don't look at me that way.

00:48:45.27,00:48:49.61
You have only to suffer this union[br]until death do us part.

00:48:49.94,00:48:53.61
And that will come sooner[br]than you think.

00:48:56.92,00:48:58.89
Oh, it's almost dawn![br]Where could he be?

00:48:59.05,00:49:02.11
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!

00:49:02.29,00:49:05.99
Heartbroken bride to wed[br]wealthy newcomer!

00:49:06.16,00:49:08.82
Wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.

00:49:09.00,00:49:10.76
Did he say corpse?

00:49:10.93,00:49:14.77
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse[br]would marry our Victor?

00:49:14.94,00:49:20.93
Oh, Mayhew![br]Silence that blasted coughing.

00:49:37.49,00:49:40.09
Mayhew, are you trying to kill us?

00:49:40.26,00:49:42.53
I think he's trying to kill us.

00:50:21.70,00:50:23.03
I...

00:50:24.27,00:50:26.10
...think you dropped this.

00:50:35.22,00:50:36.55
I'm sorry.

00:50:36.99,00:50:40.68
I'm sorry I lied to you[br]about wanting to see my parents.

00:50:40.99,00:50:45.19
It's just this whole day[br]hasn't gone quite, well...

00:50:47.83,00:50:49.49
...according to plan.

00:51:55.06,00:51:56.66
Pardon my enthusiasm.

00:51:57.00,00:51:59.06
I like your enthusiasm.

00:52:03.71,00:52:07.16
- New arrival! New arrival![br]- Lights up!

00:52:10.65,00:52:12.04
Hurry up, boys!

00:52:14.98,00:52:16.61
Drinks for everyone.

00:52:16.78,00:52:17.88
Another pint, sir?

00:52:18.05,00:52:20.08
- No, no. Just a half.[br]- No, no. Just a half.

00:52:25.33,00:52:27.99
It is impossible[br]to get good help anymore.

00:52:28.16,00:52:30.89
Welcoming committee, coming through![br]Coming through!

00:52:31.07,00:52:35.87
- My name's Plum. Miss Plum.[br]- Mayhew?

00:52:37.37,00:52:39.81
Mayhew! How nice to see...

00:52:42.04,00:52:43.24
I'm so sorry.

00:52:43.41,00:52:47.78
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great.

00:52:49.85,00:52:53.72
Hurry up, boys. Can you not see[br]the gentleman is parched?

00:52:54.66,00:52:57.56
Mayhew, I have to get back.

00:52:57.73,00:53:00.29
They all must be worried sick.[br]How is everyone?

00:53:00.46,00:53:04.42
Well, they're still wondering[br]where you slipped off to.

00:53:04.60,00:53:06.79
Oh, and Miss Victoria...

00:53:06.97,00:53:08.53
Yes? Yes, how is she?

00:53:08.70,00:53:11.64
Well, she's getting married[br]this evening.

00:53:11.81,00:53:13.80
What? Married to who?

00:53:13.98,00:53:17.64
Some newcomer,[br]Lord Somebody-or-Other.

00:53:17.81,00:53:19.14
But that's impossible!

00:53:19.31,00:53:21.48
Yeah, with you gone and all...

00:53:21.65,00:53:25.02
I guess they didn't wanna[br]waste the cake.

00:53:26.89,00:53:28.08
But how could she?

00:53:28.26,00:53:31.16
Women, you can't live with them.

00:53:31.33,00:53:33.59
You can't live with...

00:53:35.56,00:53:40.66
Time to pick up the pieces and...[br]You know, and move on, I suppose.

00:53:41.77,00:53:43.90
Speaking of picking up the pieces?

00:53:47.34,00:53:50.61
Victor? Where are you going?

00:53:53.78,00:53:58.62
Miss Victoria, we must leave[br]for the church now.

00:53:59.02,00:54:02.48
Yesterday I thought my wedding[br]would be happy.

00:54:02.69,00:54:06.68
Now I feel like I'm caught[br]in the tide, pulled out to sea.

00:54:06.86,00:54:10.56
The sea leads to many places, dearie.

00:54:11.50,00:54:14.99
Maybe you'll land somewhere better.

00:54:20.81,00:54:25.37
With this candle, I will light[br]your way in darkness.

00:54:31.42,00:54:37.09
With this ring,[br]I ask you to be mine.

00:54:40.90,00:54:45.49
I now pronounce you man and wife.

00:54:46.10,00:54:48.07
Oh, oh, dear.

00:55:04.02,00:55:05.95
I'm too late.

00:55:10.19,00:55:12.68
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?

00:55:12.86,00:55:17.09
He just walked off without saying[br]a word. Are all men like this?

00:55:17.27,00:55:20.13
Well, I'm afraid none of them[br]are very bright.

00:55:20.30,00:55:22.20
They get something stuck[br]in their heads...

00:55:22.37,00:55:24.93
...and you can't do a thing with them.

00:55:25.94,00:55:28.37
My dear, we have to talk.

00:55:28.54,00:55:32.88
- Let me tell her, please. Let me tell her.[br]- What?

00:55:33.05,00:55:36.11
There is a complication[br]with your marriage.

00:55:36.62,00:55:38.11
I don't understand.

00:55:38.29,00:55:42.72
The vows are binding[br]only until death do you part.

00:55:43.12,00:55:44.39
What are you saying?

00:55:45.13,00:55:47.86
Death has already parted you.

00:55:49.10,00:55:50.93
If he finds out, he'll leave.

00:55:51.10,00:55:53.12
There must be something you can do.

00:55:53.30,00:55:56.07
Well, there is one way.

00:55:56.24,00:55:58.14
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.

00:55:58.31,00:56:01.33
It requires the greatest sacrifice.

00:56:01.94,00:56:05.31
- Go on, get to the good part.[br]- What is it?

00:56:05.48,00:56:08.18
- We have to kill him![br]- What?

00:56:08.35,00:56:13.08
Victor would have to give up[br]the life he had forever.

00:56:13.49,00:56:17.32
He would need to repeat his vows[br]in the land of the living...

00:56:17.49,00:56:20.76
...and drink from the wine of ages.

00:56:21.60,00:56:22.86
Poison!

00:56:23.13,00:56:26.26
This would stop his heart forever.

00:56:26.43,00:56:29.70
Only then would he be free[br]to give it to you.

00:56:32.77,00:56:35.33
I could never ask him.

00:56:37.81,00:56:39.61
You don't have to.

00:56:42.15,00:56:43.41
I'll do it.

00:56:43.85,00:56:46.79
My boy, if you choose this path...

00:56:46.95,00:56:49.82
...you may never return[br]to the world above.

00:56:49.99,00:56:51.55
Do you understand?

00:56:55.00,00:56:56.96
I do.

00:56:57.33,00:57:00.20
Gather round. Gather round, everybody.

00:57:03.94,00:57:06.50
We've decided to do this thing properly.

00:57:06.67,00:57:09.07
So grab what you can and follow us.

00:57:09.24,00:57:11.80
We're moving this wedding party upstairs.

00:57:11.98,00:57:16.14
Upstairs? I didn't know[br]we had an upstairs.

00:57:16.32,00:57:18.88
- Sounds creepy.[br]- Let's go!

00:57:19.32,00:57:22.38
A wedding, a wedding</i>[br]We're going to have a wedding</i>

00:57:25.06,00:57:27.22
Hold on, Victor.

00:57:27.40,00:57:30.59
You can't get married looking like that.

00:57:30.77,00:57:34.06
The spiders think you're very cute</i>[br]But goodness knows you need a suit</i>

00:57:34.24,00:57:38.10
But have no fears, we're quite adept</i>[br]We'll have you looking lovely, lovely, lovely</i>

00:57:38.27,00:57:40.64
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely yet</i>

00:57:41.48,00:57:44.64
A little stitch, a little tuck</i>[br]Some tender loving care</i>

00:57:44.81,00:57:47.94
A little thread will fix you up</i>[br]And we've got plenty as you see</i>

00:57:48.12,00:57:51.48
And personally guarantee</i>[br]Our quality repairs</i>

00:57:51.65,00:57:55.09
A little here, I'll fix the mess</i>[br]We're going to do our very best</i>

00:57:55.26,00:57:57.85
When everybody sees you</i>[br]They will all be quite impressed</i>

00:57:58.03,00:58:01.93
They will all be quite impressed</i>

00:58:02.10,00:58:03.79
A wedding, we're going to have</i>

00:58:03.97,00:58:07.03
A wedding cake is no mistake</i>[br]It must be quite sublime</i>

00:58:07.20,00:58:08.96
- We're missing something</i>[br]- Try some dust</i>

00:58:09.14,00:58:10.47
I wish I had more time</i>

00:58:10.64,00:58:13.54
Perhaps there's something I can do</i>[br]These bones might help a bit</i>

00:58:13.71,00:58:15.54
- Oh, my nose.[br]- Sorry.

00:58:15.71,00:58:16.97
Wait a minute, that's it</i>

00:58:17.14,00:58:18.54
- A little of that</i>[br]- A little of this</i>

00:58:18.71,00:58:20.41
The perfect cake is hard to miss</i>

00:58:20.62,00:58:22.88
A wedding, a wedding</i>[br]We're going to have</i>

00:58:23.05,00:58:24.35
A wedding</i>

00:58:24.52,00:58:26.15
Huzzah, huzzah</i>

00:58:26.32,00:58:28.85
We're going to have a wedding</i>[br]A wedding</i>

00:58:29.49,00:58:35.29
Let's all give out a cheer</i>[br]'Cause the bride is getting married today</i>

00:58:36.56,00:58:39.50
One thing you can surely say</i>[br]Is we will stand beside</i>

00:58:39.67,00:58:42.57
Until the end we will defend</i>[br]Our one and only bride</i>

00:58:42.74,00:58:45.93
Our bride-to-be, our bride-to-be</i>[br]Our lovely Corpse Bride</i>

00:58:46.11,00:58:47.90
Huzzah! Hooray! Huzzah! Hooray!</i>

00:58:48.08,00:58:52.31
Our bride is getting married today</i>

00:58:52.48,00:58:54.51
- Oh, there she is.[br]- Here she comes.

00:58:59.72,00:59:03.38
Oh, oh, the bride is here</i>

00:59:03.56,00:59:07.36
She's waited for this day</i>[br]For many a year</i>

00:59:07.53,00:59:11.69
For this day, for this day</i>[br]Our hopes and our pride</i>

00:59:11.87,00:59:18.07
The bride is here</i>[br]Here comes the bride</i>

00:59:18.27,00:59:22.23
Here comes the bride</i>[br]Here comes the bride</i>

00:59:22.48,00:59:26.41
For this day, for this day</i>[br]Will last forever</i>

00:59:26.58,00:59:30.38
And all of her friends</i>[br]Will work together</i>

00:59:30.55,00:59:34.25
To make it the perfect day</i>[br]She's always dreamed</i>

00:59:34.42,00:59:41.66
Our hopes and our pride</i>[br]Our bride, our lovely bride</i>

00:59:42.30,00:59:45.06
We're going to have a party</i>[br]Like nobody's ever seen</i>

00:59:45.23,00:59:48.93
The living in the land above</i>[br]Will not know where they've been</i>

00:59:49.10,00:59:55.74
The land above</i>[br]The party of the bride</i>

00:59:56.58,01:00:02.38
Here comes the bride</i>[br]On this glorious day of days</i>

01:00:02.55,01:00:07.28
Up to the land of the living</i>

01:00:07.46,01:00:15.26
To celebrate</i>

01:00:17.70,01:00:20.19
Oh, dear.

01:00:31.65,01:00:35.05
Quiet down now, everyone.

01:00:39.55,01:00:41.02
Thank you.

01:00:42.06,01:00:46.55
Elegant, cultured, radiant.

01:00:47.19,01:00:49.96
Victoria has found a husband...

01:00:50.13,01:00:54.30
...with all these qualities and more.

01:00:54.47,01:00:57.06
Serendipity brought us together...

01:00:57.24,01:01:02.54
...and no force on earth[br]could tear us apart.

01:01:23.06,01:01:25.40
There's an eye in me soup.

01:01:34.91,01:01:35.90
Oh, sorry.

01:01:42.98,01:01:44.18
Fetch me musket!

01:01:44.35,01:01:46.48
Fetch your own musket. I'm off!

01:01:46.65,01:01:48.88
Coming through. Coming through.

01:01:52.16,01:01:56.89
Excuse me, you don't know me,[br]but I used to live in your dead mother.

01:01:58.20,01:01:59.83
Hey, hold on there.

01:02:00.33,01:02:03.86
I love a woman with meat on her bones.

01:02:05.11,01:02:07.67
Finis, who invited these people?

01:02:08.64,01:02:10.74
They must be from your side[br]of the family.

01:02:10.91,01:02:12.17
Certainly not.

01:02:12.35,01:02:16.31
Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could[br]see this, he'd be turning in his grave.

01:02:16.48,01:02:18.42
Finis.

01:02:19.92,01:02:22.12
Where do you keep the spirits?

01:02:31.00,01:02:35.13
In other news, the dead walk the earth!

01:02:39.87,01:02:43.57
Get back! Don't try[br]and sneak up on me!

01:02:43.74,01:02:45.21
Get back!

01:02:46.58,01:02:48.41
I'll give you such a wallop.

01:02:59.96,01:03:01.22
No.

01:03:01.40,01:03:02.76
Yeah.

01:03:17.24,01:03:19.04
Grandpa?

01:03:22.65,01:03:24.17
- Bounder![br]- Sweetie pie.

01:03:24.35,01:03:25.78
- Monster.[br]- Buttercup.

01:03:25.95,01:03:27.75
- Cad![br]- Gertrude!

01:03:28.22,01:03:29.75
Alfred?

01:03:31.43,01:03:34.33
You've been dead for 15 years.

01:03:34.50,01:03:38.36
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

01:03:38.53,01:03:40.30
Ethel!

01:03:50.64,01:03:52.44
Wait. That's it.

01:03:52.61,01:03:56.01
We're going to take whatever money[br]we can and get out of here.

01:03:56.18,01:03:58.62
Money? What money?

01:03:58.79,01:04:01.15
Your dowry. It's my right!

01:04:01.32,01:04:03.31
But my parents don't have any money.

01:04:03.49,01:04:08.19
It's my marriage to you that will[br]save them from the poorhouse.

01:04:08.36,01:04:10.46
Th... The poorhouse?

01:04:10.93,01:04:14.77
You're lying. It isn't true.[br]Tell me that you're lying!

01:04:14.94,01:04:18.74
Did things not go according[br]to your plan, Lord Barkis?

01:04:18.91,01:04:23.71
Well, perhaps in disappointment[br]we are perfectly matched.

01:04:42.53,01:04:45.33
Be gone, ye demons from hell!

01:04:45.50,01:04:49.56
Back to the void[br]from whence you came!

01:04:49.74,01:04:51.53
You shall not enter here.

01:04:51.71,01:04:54.27
Back, back!

01:04:54.44,01:04:56.67
Keep it down, we're in a church.

01:04:56.84,01:04:58.74
Evening.

01:05:35.25,01:05:37.55
Dearly beloved and departed...

01:05:37.72,01:05:43.42
...we are gathered here today to join[br]this man and this corpse in marriage.

01:05:46.76,01:05:48.73
Victor?

01:05:50.70,01:05:52.16
Living first.

01:05:54.23,01:05:55.79
With this hand...

01:05:56.57,01:05:59.06
...I will lift your sorrows.

01:06:00.67,01:06:02.94
Your cup will never empty...

01:06:03.48,01:06:05.47
...for I will be your wine.

01:06:06.38,01:06:07.64
Now you.

01:06:12.82,01:06:14.88
With this hand...

01:06:15.06,01:06:17.35
...I will lift your sorrows.

01:06:18.86,01:06:22.02
Your cup will never empty.

01:06:23.80,01:06:25.82
For I will be...

01:06:31.44,01:06:33.13
I will be...

01:06:35.04,01:06:36.67
Go on, my dear.

01:06:37.28,01:06:39.04
Your cup...

01:06:39.75,01:06:41.81
...will never empty...

01:06:44.02,01:06:45.95
...for I will be...

01:06:48.09,01:06:50.28
I will be your wine.

01:06:54.93,01:06:56.52
She's having second thoughts.

01:06:59.63,01:07:00.73
I can't.

01:07:01.40,01:07:03.10
What's wrong?

01:07:04.40,01:07:06.20
This is wrong.

01:07:07.44,01:07:09.53
I was a bride.

01:07:10.01,01:07:12.60
My dreams were taken from me.

01:07:13.41,01:07:15.04
Well, now...

01:07:15.55,01:07:18.61
Now I've stolen them[br]from someone else.

01:07:19.35,01:07:21.84
I love you, Victor.

01:07:23.16,01:07:25.52
But you're not mine.

01:07:30.90,01:07:32.16
Victoria!

01:07:46.98,01:07:50.11
Oh, how touching.

01:07:50.28,01:07:53.08
I always cry at weddings.

01:07:54.39,01:07:58.72
Our young lovers together at last.

01:07:58.89,01:08:02.85
Surely now they can live[br]happily ever after.

01:08:03.90,01:08:05.52
But you forget...

01:08:05.73,01:08:07.83
...she's still my wife!

01:08:08.00,01:08:10.63
I'll not leave here empty-handed!

01:08:12.01,01:08:13.17
You?

01:08:16.14,01:08:17.58
Emily?

01:08:17.74,01:08:18.94
You!

01:08:19.11,01:08:22.10
But... But... I left you.

01:08:23.22,01:08:25.01
For dead.

01:08:25.82,01:08:27.65
This woman is obviously delusional!

01:08:35.33,01:08:38.63
Sorry to cut things short,[br]but we must be on our way.

01:08:38.80,01:08:41.17
Take your hands off her.

01:08:42.17,01:08:44.97
Do I have to kill you too?

01:08:48.34,01:08:51.37
Victor, catch!

01:08:52.01,01:08:53.50
Sorry.

01:09:08.13,01:09:10.49
I say, you're not playing fair, sir.

01:09:52.34,01:09:54.24
Touché, my dear.

01:09:54.84,01:09:56.17
Get out.

01:09:56.91,01:09:59.71
Oh, I'm leaving.

01:10:04.22,01:10:07.21
But first a toast. To Emily.

01:10:07.39,01:10:11.82
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

01:10:12.29,01:10:13.95
Tell me, my dear...

01:10:14.13,01:10:18.19
...can a heart still break[br]once it's stopped beating?

01:10:21.20,01:10:22.67
Let me at him! Let me at him!

01:10:22.84,01:10:24.39
- No, don't hold me back.[br]- Wait.

01:10:25.67,01:10:28.30
We must abide by their rules.

01:10:28.48,01:10:31.67
We are amongst the living.

01:10:31.85,01:10:33.71
Well said.

01:10:49.63,01:10:51.60
Not anymore.

01:10:55.14,01:10:58.04
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.

01:11:09.38,01:11:11.44
New arrival.

01:11:18.13,01:11:22.08
Oh, Victor,[br]I never thought I'd see you again.

01:11:29.44,01:11:30.93
Wait.

01:11:31.71,01:11:33.94
I made a promise.

01:11:36.64,01:11:39.24
You kept your promise.

01:11:40.08,01:11:42.05
You set me free.

01:11:52.89,01:11:55.92
Now I can do the same for you.
