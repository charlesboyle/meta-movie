When we go into battle,

you will not pass through the gates

622
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,814

623
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,029

the way they love themselves.

- You beat them.

1054

01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,663

to ever hurt me again.

I don't think you're hiding here

1059
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,293
just because you care about Bonzo.

1060
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,053
I think you're hiding
because you're afraid.

1061

27 years after Rackham's victory.

1088
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,204
Flushed them out of these tunnels

me immediately after?

and the rest just

1182
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,377

most often compared?

1186

- Ants.
- Which have...

1187
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,311
A queen...

1188
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,734
Who directs the worker ants.

1189
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,398
What she thinks they do.

1190
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,733
Without her,
they can't think for themselves...

1191
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,200
And they die.

1192
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,703
You destroyed the queen's ship.

1193
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,078
I must have. Yes.

1194
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,244
- But you can't be certain?
- No.

1195

we keep it classified.

1208

No. No one has.

1209
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,464
But if the Formics have
rebuilt their fleet,

1210
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,165
there must be more than one queen.

1211
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,216
Yes, of course.
On their home planet.

1212
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:05,857
What happened when
you attacked here?

1213
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,713
- Did you find one?
- No.

1214
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,593

have Dink take over.

- Bernard.
- Good to see you, sir.

01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:52,969
At ease.

to death on the simulator!

1229
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,218
All right. Take your seats.

In a matter of weeks

1231
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,017
we may be called on to
fight a real battle.

1232
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,645
Let's bring your
commander up to speed.

1233
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,528
Our latest probe images
will give you an idea

1234
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,321
of what's happening
on the enemy planet.

1235
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,919
Like us, they appear to have
a population growth rate

1236
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,621
that's unsustainable.

1237
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:26,670
For now, they're contained
on their planet.

1238
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,049
Time is not on our side.

1239
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,543
Where are they?

1240
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,629
MAZER:
High surface temperatures limit

1241
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:35,012
their above-ground activity
to just a few hours a day.

1242
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,595
What's most alarming is the rate

1243
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,021
at which their military
power is expanding.

1244
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,833
But they have not yet
moved against us.

1245
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,080
No.

1246
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,469
They're planning to
colonize another planet

1247
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,304
before they breed
themselves into extinction.

1248
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,596
Our orders are to defeat them

1249
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,011
before they pose an
irreversible threat.

1250
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,389
HYRUM: Their very
existence is a threat.

1251
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:20,849
Is that clear, Commander?

1252
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,769
- Clear, sir.
- Good.

1253
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:27,064
Carry on, Colonel.

1254
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,481
We will begin with
photo real simulations

1255
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:33,737
to best approximate real battles.

1256
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,569
You will command overall strategy.

1257
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,784
Your toon leaders will
each command a battle group.

1258
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,245
You will issue orders to them.

1259
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,076
They will issue orders

1260
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,601
to their squadrons of drone pilots.

1261

1263
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:21,280
Finally.

1264
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,370
Your entire fleet must support

1265
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:26,453
and protect your most
important asset.

1266
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:31,298

of pure destruction.

1267
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,135

1269
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:37,922
M.D.?

1270
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:39,928
Molecular Detachment Device.

1271
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,972
We call her "the little Doctor."

1272
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,976
Particle beams accelerate
from her twin barrels.

1273
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,766
At the focus point, they reach
critical effective mass.

1274
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,521
A chain reaction spreads outwards,

1275
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:51,986
shattering molecular bonds.

1276
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:53,821
Leaves nothing standing.

1277
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,856
That's the beauty of
the little Doctor.

1278
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,825
No need to identify
a specific ship for the queen.

1279
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:02,030
The chain reaction takes
out an entire swarm.

1280
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,495
But I'll only get one shot.

1281
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:07,350
Once the Formics see how she works,

1282
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,044
they won't clump together again.

1283
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,501
You will have to win this war
one battle at a time.

I need to be closer.

drift with us, like a shield.

What are you doing, Ender?

1603
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:18,245
- ENDER: I know what she wants!
- Ender!

I saw this place.

What are you talking about?

1613
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,124
The Formics accessed the
game through me.

1614
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,791
Their thoughts. My dreams.
All mixed together.

1615
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:06,550
They were trying to communicate.

1616
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:09,758
What are you doing?

1617
01:40:12,965 --> 01:40:14,262
Go back.

No.

Please...

1620
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,264
I have to do this.
