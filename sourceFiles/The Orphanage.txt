Run! I'm going to catch you!

12
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,584
Good Shepherd Orphanage. Hello?

13
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,837
It's all ready.

14
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,048
She's playing.
We haven't told her yet.

15
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,436
Laura will be very happy
in her new home. Don't worry.

16
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,958
See you in the afternoon.

17
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,803
Your friends
will miss you a lot, Laura.

18
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,950
Got you!

19
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,850
THE ORPHANAGE

20
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:26,684
Mommy!

21
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:28,769
Mommy!

22
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:30,604
Mommy!

23
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:35,818
Mommy!

24
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,830
I'll go, it's my turn.

25
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:44,493
Mommy!

26
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,311
I'm coming!

27
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,409
Simón!

28
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,832
They're outside. Listen.

29
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,125
Come on, go to sleep.

30
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,804
Simón, darling.

31
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:23,872
Oh, I see!

32
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,200
Watson and Pepe
have been playing until very late...

33
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,631
and now they can't get in, right?

34
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,270
Come on, in you go.

35
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,585
Aren't you a bit old for this?

36
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,199
Weren't you scared here,
when you were little?

37
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,843
No, darling. You couldn't be afraid.
There was a gang of us...

38
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,887
and the lighthouse was on all night.

39
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,889
- Lighthouse?
- It's still there...

40
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,682
but it doesn't work anymore.

41
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,809
I'll show you tomorrow
when we go to the beach.

42
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,310
Why doesn't it work?

43
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,020
Can you keep a secret?

44
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,367
Actually, it does work.

45
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,742
But the light's invisible,
and it protects us from danger.

46
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,853
Invisible light?

47
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,267
OK, try this.

48
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,549
Look at the window, you'll see.

49
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,389
Over there. Don't move.

50
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,037
Can you see it?

51
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,761
What?
Did you see it?

52
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,977
Those kids that are coming...

53
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,058
why can't they stay at home?

54
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,191
Darling, because they're
special children...

55
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,862
and they need
a lot of special care.

56
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,405
They can't come and go,
because they're too far away.

57
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,686
Do you understand?

58
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,999
Can I sleep with you tonight?

59
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,245
You're pushing it!

60
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,057
Dad, are you not coming to the beach?

61
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,143
Aren't Watson and Pepe going?

62
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,104
No, they didn't sleep
a wink last night.

63
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,567
You're such a smart-ass!
You have friends only when it suits.

64
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,658
OK, wise guy, take your pill.

65
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,093
"S" for Simón!

66
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:22,167
Go upstairs and get your bag.
Dad'll meet us there later, OK?

67
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,491
One of us should talk to Simón.

68
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,884
About his invisible friends.

69
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,595
It's normal, don't worry.
He's lonely, he's bored.

70
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,382
He'll forget them
as soon as the real kids arrive.

71
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,532
- Calm down!
- OK.

72
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,278
Everything will work out.

73
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,153
We'll have a great home.

74
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,820
I'm so glad we're here together.

75
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,229
- Pirate.
- Pirate.

76
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,241
- Cave.
- Cave.

77
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,093
- And lighthouse.
- And lighthouse.

78
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:13,894
Let's see.

79
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,389
Once upon a time, there was
a very, very bad pirate...

80
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,060
who hid his treasures
in a cave, near a lighthouse.

81
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,770
- And what treasures?
- Stolen treasures.

82
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,896
- But it wasn't easy-
- But...

83
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,273
...to get into the cave.

84
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,608
- They'd click a stone-
- And how did they get in?

85
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,879
...in a gap in the rocks...

86
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,492
...that big stone inside the other stone...

87
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,183
...and the rock did... like this.

88
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,603
And there's were they used to hide
all of their treasures.

89
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:37,763
Hello?

90
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:40,974
Hello?

91
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:43,811
Hello?

92
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,222
Simón?

93
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,269
Simón, let's go!

94
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:21,617
Simón?

95
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,579
What's your name?

96
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,604
l’m Simón.
Do you want to play?

97
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,692
Why? Can't you play?

98
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,991
Do you want to come to my house
to play later?

99
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,544
Simón...

100
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,078
what are you doing there?

101
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,179
We are playing.

102
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,331
But Watson and Pepe
weren't going to come.

103
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,874
It’s not them,
it's another boy.

104
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,585
Then tell him to play somewhere else.
It's dangerous here.

105
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,966
Come on, let's go.

106
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,317
Can he come home to play?

107
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,261
Why are you dropping shells, Simón?

108
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,181
It’s a path
for my friend to follow...

109
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,224
so he can come home and play.

110
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,561
- He made a new friend. How's that?
- Another one?

111
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,402
We won't have room
for all these kids.

112
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,831
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

113
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,802
Sorry I didn't call,
but I couldn't get your number.

114
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,822
I'm Benigna Escobedo.

115
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,481
I'm a social worker.

116
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,444
I'm sorry you've come so far...

117
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,738
but I hadn't arranged
any interviews for today.

118
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,359
Interviews?
No, I'm here for Simón.

119
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,407
What a sitting room!

120
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,680
It's a beautiful house.

121
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,754
How did you find it?

122
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,426
I grew up here.
It was an orphanage.

123
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,386
I always wanted to return,
so we thought of the home.

124
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:06,787
Home?

125
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,182
For special children.
That's not why you came?

126
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,903
You'll need a lot of people for that.

127
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,521
It's not that kind of a home.

128
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,182
We'll be happy with 5 or 6 children.

129
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,679
More would be too complicated, right?

130
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,436
What about Simón?

131
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,941
Yes, yes. Of course.

132
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,960
I received his file yesterday...

133
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,711
and thought, "I should visit them
in case they need anything. "

134
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,798
Will you make many changes
in the house?

135
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,169
Sorry, but I don't understand
why you're here.

136
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,896
This information is old.

137
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,097
I know, but I received it all.

138
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,068
There are new treatments,
an experimental program...

139
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:08,809
that requires an application,
and I thought you might be interested.

140
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,909
As you might know,
my husband is a doctor.

141
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,580
We're aware of all treatments
for Simón's disease.

142
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,301
Now please leave.

143
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,419
Simón doesn't know he's adopted,
or about his illness...

144
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,070
and I like to deal with these issues
when my husband is at home.

145
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,319
CHANGE OF ADDRESS

146
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,682
HIV POSITIVE

147
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,026
Carlos.

148
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,396
I'll go. It's my turn.

149
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,408
Who's there?

150
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,860
What are you doing here?

151
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,520
Carlos! Carlos!

152
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,208
What is it?

153
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,357
Planning to bash
the old lady's head in?

154
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,810
Sleep with Simón tonight.

155
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,650
If she shows up again,
we'll call the cops.

156
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,600
Mommy!

157
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:45,769
Mommy!

158
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,566
Can I wake up?

159
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,320
Can I wake up?

160
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,475
Mommy...

161
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,563
- Can I wake up?
- Simón, please.

162
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,772
You are already awake.

163
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,734
You can get up now, darling.

164
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,039
WENDY GREW UP

165
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,073
Wendy grows old and dies?

166
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:20,945
Wendy grows old, but Peter Pan takes
her daughter to Neverland every year.

167
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,796
Why doesn't Wendy go too?

168
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,256
Well...

169
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,036
If Peter Pan came to get me,
would you come too?

170
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,357
No, l’m too old
to go to Neverland, darling.

171
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,841
- How old are you?
- 37.

172
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,646
At what age will you die?

173
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,700
What sort of question is that?

174
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,075
Not for a long time,
until you're very old.

175
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,209
I won't grow old.

176
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,417
I'm not going to grow up.

177
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,481
Will you be like Peter Pan?

178
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,932
Like my new friends.

179
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,382
- There's more than one?
- Six.

180
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,528
- They won't grow up either?
- They can't.

181
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,514
What are they holding?

182
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,095
Treasures. To play with.

183
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,409
I see. Your invisible friends
play together?

184
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:50,810
Sure.

185
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,443
They steal your treasure...

186
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,624
something you love,
and you have to find it.

187
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,418
That's the game?
Finding what they took from you?

188
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,459
Yes, but following the clues.

189
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,511
If you find it,
they grant you a wish.

190
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,610
Well, now.
And you have a treasure?

191
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,710
Special coins.

192
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,891
An old man left them in the park.
I think they're gold...

193
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,172
and very valuable.

194
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,915
Want to see them?

195
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,804
Don't look yet.

196
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,803
- Where'd you get all this?
- I found it.

197
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,123
What's this?

198
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,143
The first ice cream I had
after my tonsil operation.

199
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,825
The special coins.

200
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,800
They're not coins,
they're your baby teeth.

201
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,969
- Where'd you find them?
- Can't you see?

202
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,280
They're the first clue.
They've got my coins.

203
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,934
You want to play treasure hunt?

204
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,826
The game's started.

205
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,802
Remember where you kept
my baby teeth.

206
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,469
If I find my treasure,
I can make a wish.

207
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,606
Sand.
Where do you find sand?

208
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,264
You set this up, right?

209
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,338
- The beach?
- No, no, it has to be at home.

210
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,484
What's this?

211
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,959
The sewing box!

212
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,418
Simón, wait!

213
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,626
Come on, hurry up!

214
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,568
This rings a bell.

215
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,208
I know, the key in the kitchen!

216
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,538
My treasure!

217
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,671
- Those are Daddy's...
- I can make a wish! I can make a wish!

218
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,297
- I can make a wish!
- Leave that alone!

219
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,508
- I can make a wish!
- Simón!

220
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,302
Those are our things,
you shouldn't touch them.

221
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,323
- Is that clear?
- I didn't. It was them!

222
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,308
- Don't lie to me.
- l’m not lying.

223
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,894
You're lying!
You say you're my mother...

224
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,045
and you're not!

225
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,253
- What?
- You're not my mother.

226
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,445
- Who told you that?
- My friend told me.

227
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,947
- What friend?
- Tomás.

228
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,866
Tomás told me the truth,
that l’m just like them...

229
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,786
I have no mother or father!
And l’m going to die!

230
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,507
You're not my mother,
you're a liar!

231
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:44,393
We wanted you to be a bit older
to talk about certain things.

232
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,603
If you want to ask us anything...

233
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,458
Is Santa Claus a lie too?

234
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,819
Listen, Simón...

235
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,948
you heard Mommy and that lady talking...

236
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,576
saw the envelope
and invented the game...

237
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,487
because you were afraid
to ask about it.

238
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,417
What if I don't take them?

239
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,002
Nothing would happen.

240
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,702
If I don't take them,
how soon would I die?

241
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,966
It would take many days,
many weeks, even, right?

242
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:22,826
Don't worry, we'll take care of you.
You won't get sick or die.

243
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,172
OK?

244
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,705
You don't love me!
It's a lie! It's a lie!

245
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,536
It's a lie! It's a lie!

246
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,923
Simón, come down, son!

247
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:07,622
Simón!

248
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:10,708
Simón!

249
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,941
Hurry, the first kids are here!
Come on!

250
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,944
We can't go yet.
I want to show you something.

251
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,905
- Really? What is it?
- Tomás' little house.

252
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,116
- Not now. Tomorrow, when we are alone.
- No!

253
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,012
- Not now, Simón.
- Now!

254
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,372
Go downstairs right now!

255
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,415
I don't want to!

256
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,206
- Go downstairs!
- I said come and see Tomás' house!

257
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,010
OK, if you don't want
to go downstairs, don't.

258
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,214
No one is forcing you.

259
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,496
WELCOME

260
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,710
Where is the mask?

261
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,067
Simón?

262
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:05,531
Simón!

263
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:16,834
Simón?

264
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,650
Darling!

265
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,365
Darling?

266
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,103
Simón!

267
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,481
Simón?

268
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,240
Simón, darling.

269
00:31:59,292 --> 00:31:59,812
Carlos!

270
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,678
What's going on?

271
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,508
Darling!

272
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,246
Simón?

273
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:25,629
Simón!

274
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,467
Simón!

275
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,247
Simón!

276
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,420
Simón!

277
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,509
Simón!

278
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,044
Simón! Simón!

279
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,477
Simón!

280
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:23,687
Simón!

281
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,514
Simón! Simón!

282
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:35,866
Simón!

283
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,874
Darling! Simón!

284
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,330
Simón!

285
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,022
Laura!

286
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:48,389
No!

287
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,126
The tide is rising!

288
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,049
Simón!

289
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:56,554
Simón!

290
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,475
Simón!

291
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,539
- Simón!
- Laura!

292
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,544
He's over there,
He's over there, Carlos!

293
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,463
There's no one, Laura!
Come on.

294
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:13,764
- There's no one! We can't stay here!
- He's there, Carlos!

295
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,120
EMERGENCIES

296
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,396
Carlos is here.

297
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,256
He spoke to the police...

298
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:57,027
and now he wants to talk to you
if you feel better.

299
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,355
How are you?

300
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,049
He's not in the cave.

301
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,677
But I saw someone, Carlos.

302
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,908
You must have imagined it
in all the confusion.

303
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,311
Believe me, he wasn't there.

304
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,002
I'm Pilar.

305
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:29,012
I know it's hard, but you must know
we're doing all we can...

306
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,294
to locate your son
as soon as possible.

307
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,629
Pilar is a psychologist.

308
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,490
She works with the police.

309
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,342
They're working hard to find Simón.

310
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,023
I have a few questions.

311
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,781
Your husband told me
about the adoption...

312
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,823
and your son's illness.

313
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,590
As he was adopted...

314
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,851
there are possibilities
we must consider.

315
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,234
What possibilities?

316
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,325
He could have been kidnapped
by a relative.

317
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,324
I heard you recently found...

318
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,595
a woman intruder on the grounds.

319
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:08,113
Benigna Escobedo, a social worker,
came a few days ago.

320
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,642
We can't find a social worker
with that name.

321
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,675
Could you describe her?

322
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,374
She was about 70,
with white hair...

323
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,489
pale eyes, very thick glasses.

324
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,261
Don't worry, we will find her.

325
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,813
You can be sure of that.

326
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,894
How can they trust me
with their kids after this?

327
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,660
Let's do something.

328
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,733
Wear my grandmother's Saint Anthony
medal, you know I'm very fond of it.

329
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,354
To bring us good luck.

330
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,530
You don't believe that.

331
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,824
Exactly. It will work if you have it.

332
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,702
But it's not a present,
I am lending it to you.

333
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,083
Give it back when we find Simón.

334
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:50,681
Carlos!

335
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:01,567
Carlos!

336
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,324
Simón Sánchez's parents
feel more and more forsaken.

337
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,836
The 7-year-old boy disappeared
from his home 6 months ago.

338
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,195
The situation
is even more desperate...

339
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:11,574
because Simón is ill and needs
daily medication. His parents...

340
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,845
My son disappeared 6 months ago.

341
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,177
His name is Simón.

342
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,159
There are posters everywhere.
You may have seen them.

343
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,960
We've tried everything...

344
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,227
but not one clue...

345
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,699
not even a trace.

346
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,521
My son had imaginary friends.

347
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,478
We never paid much attention...

348
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,790
but I have the feeling
they're in the house.

349
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,086
I saw my daughter.

350
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,816
A year after her death.

351
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,963
It was at night, we were asleep.

352
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,189
I woke up...

353
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,060
and without knowing why,
I went to her room.

354
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,991
And there she was.

355
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,991
Smiling. Calm.

356
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,171
I think that was her way of telling me...

357
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,687
"I'm fine, I'm safe.

358
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,470
"Don't suffer for me. "

359
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,827
It is not unusual to feel,
in some way...

360
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,929
the presence of a loved one
after their death.

361
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:16,968
All of us in this bereavement group
could tell you similar stories.

362
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,932
You don't understand.

363
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,032
My son is not dead.

364
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,890
His friends took him. I saw one of them
the same day he vanished.

365
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,041
He was at home.

366
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,644
I'll do whatever it takes
to recover my son.

367
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,061
I'm not crazy...

368
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,543
believe me.

369
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,967
I know what I'm saying.

370
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,038
...cities on state of alert
due to gales, rain and snow.

371
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,779
The heaviest snowfalls
will be recorded in the north.

372
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,170
North of Asturias.
Tonight, in some cities...

373
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,966
20 cm of snow are expected
in the Cantabrian Mountains region...

374
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:19,477
cities that usually end up isolated
during these storms. And...

375
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,169
It's her.

376
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,917
The woman who came to the house.

377
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,223
Benigna?

378
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:30,979
Simón!

379
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,565
He destroyed her.
He destroyed her.

380
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,211
She's dead.

381
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,211
We went to Benigna's house.
We found some pictures...

382
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,832
and old Super 8 films.

383
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,239
I'd like you to see them.

384
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,452
Are any of the faces familiar?

385
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:11,719
Antonia, the principal,
and these are the orphans. My friends.

386
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,314
This is Martín.
She liked to be called Martín.

387
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:16,715
Rita.

388
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,860
Víctor.
I think his name was Guillermo.

389
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,951
That's Alicia, she was blind.

390
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,014
And this is me.

391
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,248
- Benigna?
- The woman that went to your house...

392
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,939
worked at the orphanage.

393
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,070
That's impossible. I'd remember.

394
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,105
She wasn't there very long.

395
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,853
She had a son. Tomás.

396
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,498
It seems that the child
was born deformed...

397
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,320
he was kept away from the others.

398
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,479
No one knew about him.

399
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:08,759
It was a total shock for the village
when they found the body.

400
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,096
What do you mean?

401
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,291
It seems he disappeared while playing.

402
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,624
CHILD'S BODY FOUND ON BEACH

403
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,555
Shortly after your adoption.

404
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,984
One of the orphans later confessed...

405
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,674
that they had played
a trick on him.

406
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,301
They went into the caves
with Tomás...

407
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,772
and took his mask off
to see if he'd come out.

408
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,696
But he never emerged.
He drowned.

409
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,629
They found his body at low tide.

410
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:42,035
The children weren't blamed.
They were only playing.

411
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,421
That boy was in my house.

412
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,498
We asked everyone
at the opening party.

413
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:54,504
No one remembers a child
with a sack over his head.

414
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:34,809
I can't remember what it's like
to sleep through the night.

415
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,719
I can't stop thinking.

416
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,152
Remember what we called Simón
when we met him?

417
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,613
"Two Little Kilos”.

418
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,951
You used to say,
"My two little extra kilos. "

419
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,572
That's all he weighed.

420
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,523
The doctors said it wasn't enough.

421
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,896
But it was plenty for us.

422
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,656
Although we knew that...

423
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,456
there was little chance
he could ever be normal.

424
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,596
But when we saw him...

425
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,564
saw his smile for the first time...

426
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,881
his eyes, his bright eyes...

427
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,596
Simón made us strong, Carlos.

428
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,924
Together, we're strong.

429
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,396
Together.

430
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,954
Forgive me if I get upset,
but it's hard.

431
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,624
Carlos, someone's in the bathroom.

432
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,314
- What is it?
- Someone was here.

433
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,265
Carlos, don't give me that look.
Feel, it's still warm.

434
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,766
Sure, I just got up.

435
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,063
Someone got into the bed.

436
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,104
I'm convinced.

437
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,130
That's what Jung means when he says...

438
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:04,898
it's in the subconscious that
the living coexist with the dead.

439
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:11,214
The Germans have another name
for "the herald of death”.

440
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,133
Doppelganger.

441
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:16,298
A being that appears
in one's own image.

442
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:18,866
A double.

443
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,521
To glance at him...

444
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,065
or at any of the others
l’ve shown you...

445
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,241
means, without the slightest doubt...

446
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,547
a passport to the other world.

447
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,568
How long has your son been missing?

448
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,691
Nine months.

449
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,869
Strange things are happening.
Things linked to his disappearance.

450
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,000
I don't know who to turn to.

451
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,459
It's not that simple.

452
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,890
You won't find an exorcist
in the yellow pages.

453
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,036
I tore it from my son's kidnapper's clothes.

454
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:10,223
The police say he's been dead
for over 30 years.

455
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,355
Someone has my son.

456
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:17,226
I don't know why.
But I won't sit at home and wait.

457
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,242
There's someone in this field,
someone I trust.

458
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,753
I'm talking from the heart.

459
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,779
Would you allow a medium
to visit your home?

460
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,778
This wasn't a children's room
in the orphanage, right?

461
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,989
No, the bedroom was back there.

462
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,977
Then we should start here.

463
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,242
Enrique.

464
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,963
Perfect, give me an hour.

465
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,086
I want an old object
from this house...

466
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,897
something related to its history,
and, if possible...

467
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,363
some clothing from the past.

468
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,474
We're not alone.

469
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,206
There's a police psychologist, Pilar...

470
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,985
who would really like
to attend the session.

471
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,366
If you don't mind.

472
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,617
Perfect. Perfect.

473
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,822
Cops are cool!

474
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,847
What does she need that doll for?

475
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,764
Aurora needs an object
to facilitate her trance.

476
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,685
Clothing and objects
get her into it...

477
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,477
and begin the regression.

478
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:18,073
- Regression?
- A psychic summoning.

479
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,796
Past, present and future
are superimposed, and cross.

480
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,997
Like a sort of time travel.

481
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,435
It may sound like witchcraft...

482
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,535
but you mustn't fear
parallel perception.

483
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,620
If there's anything,
Aurora will see it.

484
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,981
If there's anything,
I hope we'll all see it.

485
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,515
Everything's ready, Enrique.

486
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,758
Ready, whenever you want.

487
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,907
- Aurora, can you hear me?
- Perfectly. I'm ready.

488
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:10,768
Here we go.

489
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:22,332
Everything around you
is beginning to fade.

490
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,105
Darkness is forming
a circle around you...

491
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,115
it's closing in on you.

492
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,978
Everything is fading.
We're no longer here.

493
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,781
Now you're alone
in the darkness...

494
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,819
and the darkness
begins to disappear.

495
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,974
I'm going to count down...

496
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,668
from ten...

497
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,452
and once I've finished...

498
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,257
you can go
wherever you want...

499
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,693
and will be able to see...

500
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,415
anyone who is hiding in this house.

501
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,334
Ten...

502
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,064
nine...

503
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,501
eight...

504
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,294
seven...

505
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:14,552
six...

506
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,073
five...

507
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:18,908
four...

508
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:20,803
three...

509
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:22,977
two...

510
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:24,947
one.

511
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,457
You can open your eyes.

512
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,871
It's cold...

513
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,016
the window is open.

514
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,148
Aurora...

515
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,515
I want you
to look around you.

516
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,186
Is there anyone with you in the room?

517
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,411
I can hear someone.

518
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,417
I can hear...

519
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,100
I can hear something.

520
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,359
I can hear something.

521
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,321
The sound comes and goes.

522
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,323
I can't hear it anymore.

523
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,892
I think I've lost them.

524
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,684
I can hear something.

525
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,500
...all alone.

526
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,335
...all alone.

527
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,274
Children...

528
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,542
I'm sure it's children.

529
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,080
At the end of the hall.
I think it's them.

530
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,807
I can't open it.

531
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,677
It's closed.

532
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,046
But there's someone.

533
01:00:04,046 --> 01:00:05,923
Why are you crying?

534
01:00:06,632 --> 01:00:09,886
-We're sick!
-Who's sick?

535
01:00:10,928 --> 01:00:12,680
I won't hurt you.

536
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:16,434
Open the door.
Don't be afraid.

537
01:00:17,518 --> 01:00:18,561
Open the door.

538
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:22,315
We want you to open the door!

539
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:39,415
What have they done to you?

540
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:43,961
What have they done?

541
01:00:48,925 --> 01:00:49,800
Aurora,

542
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:52,136
tell me what you see.

543
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:54,263
Five children.

544
01:00:54,472 --> 01:00:57,475
They're very sick.
They're crying.

545
01:01:00,102 --> 01:01:01,646
What happened?

546
01:01:06,234 --> 01:01:07,318
They're dying.

547
01:01:07,485 --> 01:01:09,737
Who would want to poison you?

548
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:17,245
Someone's going to kill us.

549
01:01:18,204 --> 01:01:19,330
Is my son there?

550
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:22,333
Aurora, is Simón with you?

551
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:27,630
Is Simón here?

552
01:01:45,565 --> 01:01:47,733
Aurora, can you hear me?

553
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:49,485
Let's get her.

554
01:01:49,902 --> 01:01:53,114
Aurora, stay in the middle
of the room.

555
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:54,532
I'll count from ten.

556
01:01:55,408 --> 01:01:56,075
Ten...

557
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,286
Nine...

558
01:01:58,744 --> 01:01:59,370
Eight...

559
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:25,813
I was in the house, but...

560
01:02:26,772 --> 01:02:28,274
everything was different.

561
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:32,195
The beds, the toys, the décor,
everything was much older.

562
01:02:34,363 --> 01:02:38,117
The light from the lighthouse
came through the windows.

563
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:43,206
You didn't see Simón?

564
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,501
It was too dark,
I'm sorry.

565
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:49,045
I couldn't recognize anyone.

566
01:02:49,462 --> 01:02:50,880
But the children were there.

567
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:53,466
You saw the children.
Is that right?

568
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:54,258
That's right.

569
01:02:54,425 --> 01:02:56,344
You're talking about ghosts.

570
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,721
And what is a ghost, Carlos?

571
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:01,682
There's something here,
and we all saw it.

572
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:06,020
When something terrible happens,

573
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:09,440
sometimes it leaves a trace,

574
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:12,568
a wound that acts

575
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,363
as a knot between two time lines.

576
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,033
It's like an echo

577
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,995
repeated over and over,
waiting to be heard.

578
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:25,498
Like a scar...

579
01:03:25,665 --> 01:03:26,916
Oh, I'm sorry.

580
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,460
Like a scar or a pinch

581
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:33,047
that begs for a caress
to relieve it.

582
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:37,802
Laura...

583
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,851
we who are close to death,

584
01:03:45,017 --> 01:03:48,312
we are more receptive
to these messages.

585
01:03:51,732 --> 01:03:55,278
You mean my son
could see those children

586
01:03:58,698 --> 01:03:59,657
because...

587
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,535
That's enough.

588
01:04:02,702 --> 01:04:04,620
Please take your things and leave.

589
01:04:05,621 --> 01:04:07,456
We can't let them go like this.

590
01:04:07,623 --> 01:04:09,709
Laura, this is a farce,

591
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:11,627
a sideshow trick.

592
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:14,088
I can't believe this. Why?

593
01:04:14,463 --> 01:04:17,300
For what reason?
They're right...

594
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:19,427
-They don't want money.
-Not yet.

595
01:04:20,636 --> 01:04:21,971
What should I do?

596
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:23,598
What should I do?

597
01:04:23,764 --> 01:04:26,726
The police haven't found
a single clue

598
01:04:26,893 --> 01:04:29,562
as to whether he's
dead or alive.

599
01:04:29,729 --> 01:04:31,647
What do I do,
just sit and wait?

600
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:33,232
Can it hurt to listen?

601
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:35,026
-Laura, stop!
-No, you stop!

602
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:37,195
Pilar...

603
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:41,199
How many similar cases
have you had in this damned village?

604
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,244
Get another distraction,
I didn't invite you here.

605
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:54,545
What should I do?

606
01:04:54,712 --> 01:04:55,713
My dear,

607
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,299
you are a good mother.

608
01:04:58,508 --> 01:05:01,677
Your pain gives you strength,
it will guide you.

609
01:05:03,012 --> 01:05:07,183
But only you know
how far you are willing to go

610
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:09,435
to find your son.

611
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:11,270
I don't know what to do.

612
01:05:11,437 --> 01:05:13,648
You hear, but don't listen.

613
01:05:14,732 --> 01:05:17,693
Seeing is not believing.
It's the other way around.

614
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,823
Believe,

615
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:24,700
and you will see.

616
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:42,927
What are you doing?

617
01:05:53,729 --> 01:05:56,440
We can't stay here any longer.

618
01:05:57,191 --> 01:05:59,569
We should go,
at least for a while.

619
01:06:02,196 --> 01:06:05,658
The children are here.
Aurora saw them. I can't leave.

620
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:07,201
You heard the voices.

621
01:06:07,368 --> 01:06:10,246
That Enrique could have faked it all.

622
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:12,957
Can't you see it could be a set-up?

623
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,084
That's Pilar's theory,
a set-up?

624
01:06:15,835 --> 01:06:18,462
-Her rational theory?
-She's protecting us.

625
01:06:19,797 --> 01:06:21,215
From what?

626
01:06:21,382 --> 01:06:23,009
Things like this evening.

627
01:06:23,176 --> 01:06:26,304
People entering our home
and fucking up our lives.

628
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,640
-They just want to help.
-Help?

629
01:06:29,807 --> 01:06:31,517
Didn't you hear them?

630
01:06:32,018 --> 01:06:34,562
Did they mention finding Simón?

631
01:06:34,854 --> 01:06:37,106
They just want to contact the dead.

632
01:06:43,404 --> 01:06:47,283
If Simón's alive,
I can't see how they can help us.

633
01:06:50,203 --> 01:06:52,747
If he's not,
they won't recover him.

634
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,583
I don't want to keep
taking this shit.

635
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,044
Please, let's leave this house.

636
01:07:01,047 --> 01:07:04,967
You can't ask me to give up.
Neither you nor Pilar.

637
01:07:07,053 --> 01:07:10,348
We can survive this. Many couples
lose a child and pull through.

638
01:07:10,515 --> 01:07:14,018
I want to be with Simón,
don't you understand?

639
01:07:14,185 --> 01:07:18,272
If you want to go, I can't stop you.
I just want to know

640
01:07:18,439 --> 01:07:20,107
where he is!

641
01:08:26,591 --> 01:08:28,176
Where are you?

642
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,887
I'm not afraid.

643
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,040
You want to play?

644
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:44,669
Are you playing with me?

645
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:10,898
Benigna?

646
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:21,779
Please, don't let it be Simón.

647
01:15:44,654 --> 01:15:46,823
-There are five, right?
Yes.

648
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,825
All my friends.

649
01:15:49,242 --> 01:15:52,119
Martín, Rita, Alicia,
Guillermo, Víctor.

650
01:15:54,497 --> 01:15:57,959
Benigna killed them.
That's why she went to the shed,

651
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,002
to recover their bodies.

652
01:16:00,169 --> 01:16:01,212
I've thought it out.

653
01:16:01,712 --> 01:16:04,048
Their game killed Tomás

654
01:16:04,215 --> 01:16:07,468
and now they're playing
with Simón and me.

655
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:12,598
Simón's in danger
and I don't know how to play.

656
01:16:13,307 --> 01:16:14,392
I don't know how to play.

657
01:16:14,559 --> 01:16:16,227
Laura, you're making it up.

658
01:16:16,394 --> 01:16:18,312
I saw it myself.

659
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:21,357
And this afternoon?
Who laid out the clues?

660
01:16:21,524 --> 01:16:23,484
Simón made it all up.

661
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:25,111
Who?

662
01:16:25,278 --> 01:16:26,654
Tell me! Who?

663
01:16:28,823 --> 01:16:31,284
I've packed.
I don't want us to stay here.

664
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:34,453
I can't leave yet.

665
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,873
I won't live here,

666
01:16:37,874 --> 01:16:39,417
and you're not staying alone.

667
01:16:40,626 --> 01:16:43,713
I can't just leave,
there are too many memories.

668
01:16:44,505 --> 01:16:46,299
I have to say goodbye.

669
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,514
Two days.

670
01:16:53,973 --> 01:16:54,974
Alone.

671
01:16:57,059 --> 01:16:58,853
Please, I need this.

672
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:02,565
Please.

673
01:21:17,361 --> 01:21:19,197
Please bless
what you have given us.

674
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:28,122
Thank you for letting us
gather once again

675
01:21:29,457 --> 01:21:31,501
and be together.

676
01:21:58,986 --> 01:22:01,322
What else do you want?

677
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:04,367
What more must I do?
What?

678
01:22:05,827 --> 01:22:07,912
I have no time,
I have no time.

679
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:24,011
You want to keep playing?
Is that it?

680
01:22:24,345 --> 01:22:26,639
Let's make a deal.
I'll play a while,

681
01:22:26,806 --> 01:22:29,267
then you tell me where Simón is.

682
01:22:31,686 --> 01:22:33,062
OK?

683
01:23:01,883 --> 01:23:04,802
One, two, three,
knock on the wall!

684
01:23:14,854 --> 01:23:17,607
One, two, three,
knock on the wall.

685
01:24:50,199 --> 01:24:52,076
Wait, wait!
No.

686
01:24:52,243 --> 01:24:55,079
I won't hurt you.
I just want to find Simón...

687
01:29:15,923 --> 01:29:17,341
Why are you crying?

688
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:20,261
Oh, my darling!

689
01:29:23,139 --> 01:29:25,892
Are you OK?
You're freezing.

690
01:29:27,268 --> 01:29:29,061
Don't worry about a thing.

691
01:29:29,353 --> 01:29:31,481
Don't be afraid,
I'll get you out.

692
01:29:40,948 --> 01:29:42,742
Stay and play with us.

693
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:45,244
We can't stay to play.

694
01:29:51,918 --> 01:29:53,878
Listen to me, Simón.

695
01:29:54,212 --> 01:29:57,799
Imagine it's just you
and me here. OK?

696
01:29:58,841 --> 01:30:01,677
Think about before we came
to this house.

697
01:30:01,969 --> 01:30:03,346
Remember?

698
01:30:03,554 --> 01:30:05,723
Think only about that, OK?

699
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:08,142
Think only about that,

700
01:30:08,601 --> 01:30:09,769
think about Daddy,

701
01:30:09,936 --> 01:30:11,854
think about next Christmas,

702
01:30:12,021 --> 01:30:14,732
and all the things we'll do together.

703
01:30:15,191 --> 01:30:16,651
So many things, darling!

704
01:30:16,818 --> 01:30:19,237
Close your eyes, tight,

705
01:30:19,403 --> 01:30:21,823
shut them really tight

706
01:30:23,241 --> 01:30:26,744
and think about what you'll be
when you grow up.

707
01:30:27,161 --> 01:30:29,539
What would you like to be, darling?

708
01:30:29,705 --> 01:30:33,334
Think about the schools you'll go to,
the friends you'll make.

709
01:30:35,795 --> 01:30:37,755
And just believe for a moment

710
01:30:40,049 --> 01:30:43,469
that Tomás and the other children
aren't real.

711
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,764
This is a fantasy, my darling,

712
01:30:46,973 --> 01:30:48,599
like a nightmare.

713
01:30:52,854 --> 01:30:54,772
Do it for me, Simón.

714
01:30:55,731 --> 01:30:57,525
When you open your eyes,

715
01:30:58,818 --> 01:31:00,153
make them go away.

716
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,388
Close your eyes, darling,

717
01:31:27,805 --> 01:31:29,682
and keep on playing with me.

718
01:31:32,727 --> 01:31:35,563
Keep on playing, darling, OK?

719
01:32:19,899 --> 01:32:22,193
-What is it?
-Tomás' little house.

720
01:34:25,358 --> 01:34:27,485
I found you.
This isn't fair.

721
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:34,075
I found you...

722
01:36:18,513 --> 01:36:20,473
I want Simón back!

723
01:37:22,243 --> 01:37:23,953
Mummy, can I wake up?

724
01:37:27,915 --> 01:37:30,418
Of course you can, darling.

725
01:37:35,131 --> 01:37:35,923
Mummy...

726
01:37:38,134 --> 01:37:40,052
I found the special coins.

727
01:37:40,219 --> 01:37:42,763
Now I just have to make a wish.

728
01:37:43,681 --> 01:37:47,018
I wish you'll stay
and look after all of us.

729
01:38:43,407 --> 01:38:44,200
It's Laura!

730
01:38:58,965 --> 01:39:01,801
She's grown old,
like Wendy in the story.

731
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,557
It's Laura.

732
01:39:14,522 --> 01:39:16,065
Come, don't be afraid.

733
01:39:18,526 --> 01:39:22,697
The house. The beach.
The lost children.

734
01:39:28,494 --> 01:39:30,121
Once upon a time

735
01:39:30,288 --> 01:39:32,707
there was a house near the beach

736
01:39:32,999 --> 01:39:35,751
where the lost children lived...

737
01:40:15,249 --> 01:40:17,376
In memory of Laura and Simón

738
01:40:17,543 --> 01:40:19,253
and of the orphans

739
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:22,632
Martín, Rita,
Guillermo, Alicia, Víctor

740
01:40:22,799 --> 01:40:24,217
and Tomás

741
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:35,710
