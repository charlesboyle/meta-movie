1
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,420
- And so, heh...
- Heh.

2
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:32,329
I chose jellyfish as my favorite...

3
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,014
You all fed? Yeah?

4
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,295
Yeah...

5
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,935
Marcy! Marcy May!

6
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,113
Where you going?

7
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,022
Marcy, what are you doing here?

8
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,428
Worried about you.

9
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,163
Well, I'm fine.

10
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,506
Yeah? And Patrick is worried about you.

11
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,809
I just wanted to come into town.

12
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,216
Oh, I could have given you a ride.

13
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,075
I wanted to walk.

14
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,117
Through the woods?

15
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,048
Can I get you something?

16
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,556
No, thank you.

17
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,623
Are you done?

18
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,688
Yeah.
Uh...

19
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,900
You're not gonna finish that?

20
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,366
Okay, thanks.

21
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,139
Mm.

22
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,585
Ready to go?

23
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,729
Not right now.

24
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,400
No?

25
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,383
Hey, don't do that. Come here.

26
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,378
You're shaking.

27
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,420
Calm down.

28
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,388
All right. You take care of yourself.

29
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,951
Hello?

30
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,120
<i>He. Ho?</i>

31
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,824
<i>- Martha?
- Yeah.</i>

32
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,231
<i>Where are you? Where have you been?</i>

33
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,801
Uh, I'm not sure. I'm upstate, I think.

34
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,670
<i>You're in New York?</i>

35
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,972
Yeah, I think.

36
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,274
<i>When did you get back?</i>

37
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,816
<i>How long have you been here?</i>

38
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,616
Martha?

39
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,849
<i>Martha, what's wrong?</i>

40
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,351
I don't know. Um...

41
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,287
I should go back.

42
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,590
<i>Go back where?</i>

43
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,061
<i>Martha, what happened? Are you okay?</i>

44
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,631
Um, I have to go. Um...

45
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,533
I can't stay gone, so...

46
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,235
<i>No, no, no, don't go.</i>

47
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,709
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

48
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,309
<i>Martha.</i>

49
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,876
I'm sorry for calling.

50
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,311
<i>Please don't hang up.
Don't hang up the phone.</i>

51
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,286
<i>Find out where you are
and! will come get you.</i>

52
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,386
Martha?
I can't wait that long.

53
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,656
<i>What do you mean? Tell me where you are
and I will come right now.</i>

54
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,225
No, it's okay, you don't have to.

55
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,530
<i>Martha, I wanna see you. Please.</i>

56
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,835
Martha?

57
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,305
<i>Martha.</i>

58
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,671
I made you some tea.
Thanks.

59
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,179
You're dripping everywhere.

60
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,118
Ted should be up from the city soon,
make us some dinner.

61
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,619
I'm pretty tired.

62
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,457
Is it okay if I just go to bed?

63
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,437
Sure.

64
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,132
Get a good night's sleep tonight
and you'll be as good as new tomorrow.

65
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,309
- Hi.
- Hey.

66
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,809
<i>Hey'...</i>

67
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,112
- Well?
- She seems okay.

68
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,882
What did she say?
Not much.

69
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,651
She's really tired.

70
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:26,985
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

71
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,027
Where's she been?

72
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,491
She had some boyfriend.
They were living in the Catskills.

73
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,027
- What?
- It's okay.

74
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,362
Heh, it's not really, Lucy.
It's fine.

75
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,032
She's here now.

76
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,971
Hmm.

77
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,849
- How long is she gonna be staying again?
- Ha-ha-ha!

78
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,188
Oh, Martha.

79
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,392
- Welcome.
- Hi.

80
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,399
- Great to finally meet you.
- Yeah.

81
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,058
- Did you sleep all right?
- Mm-hm.

82
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,702
Good.

83
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,429
So how do you like our house?

84
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,641
It's nice.

85
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,002
It's just a rental.
Yeah, well, I love it.

86
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,976
Mm.

87
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,651
<i>I didn't know there was a lake.
Mm. Yeah.</i>

88
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,677
Do you still like to swim?

89
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,113
- You don't still live in the city?
- Heh, heh.

90
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,362
We do. We just like to come up here
on weekends and holidays.

91
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,691
You know. Ted is working
on this new building downtown...

92
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,426
and as soon as it's finished...

93
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,867
we're taking one of the apartments.
Do you wanna see pictures?

94
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,040
Do you think she's excited
to have you back?

95
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,607
This is just the view, and obviously
the interiors aren't finished...

96
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,855
- but it's nice, right?
- Mm-hm.

97
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,446
We were supposed to move in
in the spring...

98
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,150
but, uh, construction was halted, so
it's gonna be just a little while longer.

99
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:10,400
Yes, just a little while longer.
Okay, sorry, no more work talk.

100
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,069
Aren't you hungry?

101
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,096
Not really, sorry.
Well, you have to eat something.

102
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,708
It's okay,
I can make you something later.

103
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,450
Where are we?

104
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,449
Connecticut.

105
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,595
Well, how far are we?

106
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,996
From what?
Yesterday.

107
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,559
You mean from where I picked you up?

108
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,497
About three hours. Why?

109
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,971
I was just wondering.

110
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,318
Put out your cigarette.
Why?

111
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,257
Just do it.

112
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,390
Is that him?
Yeah.

113
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,858
<i>Hey'...</i>

114
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,293
Is this Martha?

115
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,937
Hi.

116
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,964
- How you doing?
- Great.

117
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,967
Oh, you've got a really nice place here.

118
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,010
It's as much yours as it is mine.

119
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,073
- I thought you quit.
- I did.

120
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,908
I worry for you.

121
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,779
I know.

122
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,023
I'm sorry.

123
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,528
Don't apologize to me. It's your body.

124
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,993
Zoe, look after this girl.

125
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,263
For once in her life,
she deserves some real care.

126
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,564
I will.

127
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,666
She's been great.

128
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,380
Everyone's been really great.
Good.

129
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,548
Martha.

130
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,221
You look like a Marcy May.

131
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,913
Marcy was my grandmother's name.

132
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,888
Wow, there you go.
Heh.

133
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,092
I'm going in.
Do you wanna join'?

134
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,895
Sure.

135
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,342
- You coming?
- In a minute.

136
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,161
Martha!

137
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,196
That is an interesting choice
of swim wear.

138
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,477
Martha, get out of the water.

139
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,001
- What?
- Get out of the water.

140
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,937
Why aren't you wearing any clothes?
What is wrong with you?

141
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,306
- You can't do that around here, you know.
- Why?

142
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,542
Because there are kids around.
People come by.

143
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,011
- So?
- You just can't, OK? Get outta the water.

144
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,656
We don't do that kind of thing.
Get out.

145
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,853
You could have asked me.
I have a bathing suit you could borrow.

146
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,498
What's wrong with you?
Jesus.

147
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,970
Hey, hey, Marcy.

148
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,438
- Max.
- Hey.

149
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,473
- Where do they go at night?
- Uh...

150
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,244
Pfft! I don't know. Heh.
I never get invited.

151
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,059
You wanna have a drink with me?

152
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,320
They won't be back for a few hours.

153
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,661
I shouldn't.
I'm not gonna drink for a while, actually.

154
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:46,962
I think it's a good idea for me.

155
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,928
All right.

156
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,211
Wake up, everybody.

157
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,249
Good morning.

158
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:43,181
We switch out jobs each day
so we all know how to do different things.

159
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,350
Do you knit?
No.

160
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,686
I can learn, though.
Oh, no, that's okay.

161
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,721
You'll find your role.

162
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:54,164
It takes time for people
to find their role in a new family.

163
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:59,397
Mostly, we sell blankets in town
because we still need some money.

164
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,334
But once the farm is up and running,
we'll be self-sufficient...

165
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,673
and we'll never have
to worry about it again.

166
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,725
Hey. I'm sorry, Patrick. Hey.

167
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,194
- What're you sorry for'?
- Ahem.

168
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,372
Um, here.

169
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,098
How are you, man?

170
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,666
Good, you?

171
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,571
Feels like...

172
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:40,438
- It's a really great consistency.
- Yeah, and it's sticky.

173
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,508
And it holds together like glue.

174
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,611
- And it can flow around. Like...
- You should talk to her.

175
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,880
That's why I need to
figure out how to do it.

176
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,353
Yeah.

177
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,618
Yeah, you'll figure it out. Don't look...

178
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,866
How's everything
going so far, Marcy May?

179
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,591
- Good.
- Do you like it here?

180
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,060
Yeah, it's... it's great.

181
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,728
I want you to feel at home.

182
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,272
- I do, thank you.
- Mm-hm.

183
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,934
I know people have abandoned you
your whole life.

184
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,738
- Your father.
- What?

185
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,746
I don't blame you
for not trusting people.

186
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:21,085
But if you're ever going to have
a meaningful relationship...

187
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,121
you need to let your guard down.

188
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,396
It's not your fault, but it's there.

189
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:32,362
And if you feel safe here,
and I hope you do, let us in.

190
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,435
We wanna help you.

191
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,299
Yeah. We think you're fucking awesome.

192
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,239
But if you're gonna live here...

193
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,379
you need to be a part of things.

194
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,818
Play another song.

195
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,990
Do "A Patch of Land".
It's not a song.

196
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,532
Good morning.
Good morning.

197
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,835
- How are you feeling today?
- Good.

198
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,470
Yeah? Good.

199
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:24,375
So, uh, I stopped by the juice place
and I got you a kale with ginseng.

200
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,850
Do you mind just putting your feet
off the counter?

201
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,849
I got you a kale and ginseng
because it's just...

202
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,630
I don't know,
I thought it might make you feel better.

203
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,988
If that doesn't appeal to you,
I also got a pineapple orange.

204
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:40,058
Yeah, that might be better. Thank you.
Okay.

205
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:44,830
Oh, and I also got you protein bars,
just in case you want a snack.

206
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,544
Why is the house so big?

207
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,738
The house isn't so big.

208
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,074
It's big for two people.

209
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,910
Well, yeah, but we like to entertain.

210
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,379
And sometimes friends come up
for the weekend...

211
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,315
sometimes we have parties.
It's just nice to have space.

212
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,684
So no one else lives here?

213
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,488
Of course no one else lives here.

214
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,375
You're married?
Yeah.

215
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:33,680
When?
April.

216
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:38,283
I tried calling you, but, uh, apparently
you got rid of your cell phone.

217
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:40,018
I lost it.

218
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,421
You didn't think to get a new one?
I got used to not having one.

219
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,723
- Cocktails, anyone?
- No, thank you.

220
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,504
Martha?
Mm-mm.

221
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,234
Was it a big wedding?
About 40 people.

222
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:57,936
Mostly Ted's family.

223
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,438
- Did Aunt Dora come?
- Ha, yes.

224
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,274
Did she smoke like a chimney
and complain about everything?

225
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,977
- She's not that bad.
- You didn't have to live with her.

226
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,278
You lived with Dora?

227
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,752
She lived with me after Mom died.

228
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,583
- And where were you?
- College.

229
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,227
Huh.

230
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,288
- She'd love to know you're okay.
- She hates me.

231
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,957
She does not hate you.

232
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,792
- Look at me. Come on.
- Mm-mm.

233
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,869
- No.
- I don't have any pictures of you.

234
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,231
God, you're gorgeous.

235
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,934
It's really rather irritating.

236
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,302
There you go.

237
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,819
You don't need to shake it.
That's a myth.

238
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,289
- Is it true married people don't fuck?
- What?

239
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,054
No, heh.

240
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,660
Excuse me.

241
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,504
- Put this on.
- You're kidding.

242
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,340
- Your clothes are disgusting. Try it.
- Why does it matter?

243
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,952
Because it feels good to put on
something nice and comfortable.

244
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,132
It looks really good on you,
you little shit.

245
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,505
Whatever makes you happy, mama bear.

246
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,218
You're making fun of me,
and I think it looks really good on you.

247
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:59,024
What, ifs not good?
No, no, it's fine.

248
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,064
Uh, it's a bit dry.
It's not dry.

249
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,367
It just needs a little bit more salt,
that's all.

250
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:20,212
She seems better today.
Yeah.

251
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,580
I wish I didn't have to go tomorrow.

252
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,760
Well, let me take you.
No.

253
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,888
I don't want her to be alone.

254
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,001
You'll be nice to her, right?

255
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,194
I'm always nice.
Oh.

256
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,640
I know you feel like something bad
just happened, Marcy May.

257
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,907
But you have to trust me,
that wasn't bad.

258
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,981
That was truly good.

259
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,314
We've all been in this situation.

260
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,320
We wouldn't all still be here
if what happened in that room was bad.

261
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,665
We all love each other very much.

262
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,604
We're all together on this.

263
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,002
You have to trust us.

264
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,274
Do you believe me?

265
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,481
Yeah.

266
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,464
You're so lucky.

267
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,499
I'd give anything
to have my first time again.

268
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,542
Really?
Yeah.

269
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,981
It's so special.

270
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,915
I can't remember anything.

271
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:11,082
I just woke up and felt this pain.

272
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,363
That's the cleansing.

273
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,727
It's good. It means it's working
if you can't remember things.

274
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,334
You're cleansing yourself of the past
and the toxins.

275
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,397
You need to share yourself.

276
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,099
Don't be selfish.

277
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,034
I'm not.

278
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,508
So smile, then.

279
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,044
Enjoy this amazing night.
It only happens once.

280
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,211
Thanks.

281
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,179
Is that a new one, Max?
There's one right there.

282
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,648
<i>Yeah. Is that a new song?</i>

283
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,350
Yeah, I wrote it yesterday.

284
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,085
That was the first half.
Great.

285
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:23,154
That was nice.
Thanks, man.

286
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,934
Yeah.

287
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,139
All right.
This is called "Marcy's Song".

288
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,484
Well, she's

289
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:56,595
<i>She's just a picture</i>

290
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,690
<i>Who lives</i>

291
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,165
<i>Lives on my wall</i>

292
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,731
<i>Well, she's</i>

293
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:10,172
<i>She's just a picture</i>

294
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:16,986
<i>The reason, reason,
reason it is so small</i>

295
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,212
<i>The smile's so inviting</i>

296
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,482
<i>Ana' her body so rah'</i>

297
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,884
<i>Well, she's</i>

298
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,189
<i>She's just a picture</i>

299
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,534
<i>Just a picture</i>

300
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,736
<i>That's all</i>

301
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,234
<i>Well, you stand there</i>

302
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:47,381
<i>Stand there with the nightshade</i>

303
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,007
<i>Her dripping</i>

304
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:54,484
<i>Dripping down your hands</i>

305
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,747
<i>You ask me</i>

306
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,586
<i>Ask me about the lightning</i>

307
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:07,394
<i>The lady, lady, lady,
she understands</i>

308
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,962
<i>So dream for the future</i>

309
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,932
<i>Water for the sand</i>

310
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:20,342
<i>And the strangeness is wandering</i>

311
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:28,084
<i>Through many calling lands</i>

312
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,336
You've been saying
the same thing to me for two months...

313
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,771
and I still don't have them.

314
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,815
I'm going into the meeting
in 14 fucking days.

315
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,312
Great. No, that's all I wanted to hear.
Thank you.

316
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,961
- What're you doing?
- Cleaning.

317
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,166
I thought I'd help out more.

318
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,524
All right.

319
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:19,140
Ahh. I'm gonna take the boat out.
Do you wanna come'?

320
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,998
Is Lucy coming?

321
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,802
Uh, no, she had to run to the city.
Oh.

322
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,646
Come on,
I'll teach you how to drive the boat.

323
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,648
It's okay.

324
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,988
Come on.

325
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,515
Sorry.

326
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,194
It's going, it's going, it's going.

327
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,255
Okay. Okay.
All right.

328
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:22,527
Okay. All right. Okay.

329
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,044
Want one?

330
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,816
Yeah.

331
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,221
How's it been with Lucy?
Fine.

332
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:55,231
Is it strange to spend time together?
No. Why?

333
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,671
It's been a long time.

334
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:00,237
I don't know. It's normal, I guess.

335
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,968
Where is she?

336
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,703
She's at the doctor.

337
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:09,110
<i>Why?
Getting a checkup.</i>

338
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,414
We are trying to have a baby.

339
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:22,820
What?
I just can'! imagine it.

340
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,288
Lucy holding a baby.

341
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,056
Why?

342
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,928
Well, she wouldn't know
what to do with it.

343
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,868
Do you want a baby?

344
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,775
Mm-hm.

345
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,969
If she's happy, I'm happy.

346
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,305
So you're unhappy?

347
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,674
What, now? Ha-ha-ha.

348
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,745
No, no, no, she's doing well.

349
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,787
She's doing well.

350
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,451
Do you want another?

351
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,258
Here.

352
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,266
She is, um, relieved to have you back.

353
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,793
You know, you worried her.

354
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:05,829
Why?
Because you disappeared.

355
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,441
You hadn't called in two years.

356
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,837
I just lost track, I guess.

357
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,984
Well, it's a good thing to let people know
where you are, Martha.

358
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,643
People worry.

359
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,754
I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
Well, she did.

360
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,354
Can I go swimming?

361
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,998
Hey, you don't need to ask.

362
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,199
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

363
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,202
- Martha, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

364
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,172
Jesus.
You can't just come in here like that.

365
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:36,952
Sorry.

366
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,210
Goddamn it, what's wrong?

367
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,379
I'm just having a hard time
sleeping alone.

368
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,854
All you do is sleep. Christ.

369
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,354
Just stay. Stay.

370
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,557
Why would you think it was okay
to come in here like that?

371
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,660
I don't know. it's a big bed.
You guys were on the other side.

372
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:59,162
You can't come into our room
when we're having sex.

373
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:03,536
That's not normal. it's private.
Sorry.

374
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,003
You don't need to apologize.
Just...

375
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,739
I need you to understand
why it's not okay.

376
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,440
Okay.

377
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,042
- Do you?
- Yeah.

378
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:17,258
Well?
Because it's private and not normal.

379
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,530
Oh, God.

380
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,256
Just lie down, Martha.

381
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,504
- Oh, this is just brilliant.
- Don't go.

382
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,402
Just go to sleep.

383
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,352
I'm sorry you slept out here.

384
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,645
Thank you for being patient.

385
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,015
I didn't have much choice, did I?

386
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,297
I'm just trying to make sure she's okay.

387
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,624
I have two weeks a year
to come up here...

388
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,526
- and try to relax.
- I know.

389
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,461
- I'm under pressure...
- I know you are.

390
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,364
To get this building up and running
or the bank takes it.

391
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,199
That has nothing to do with Martha.

392
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,674
No, I guess my point is,
I just don'! need the extra stress.

393
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,674
I'm her only family.

394
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,684
You know, she needs to know
that she can depend on me right now.

395
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,349
- It's complicated.
- As complicated as it might be...

396
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,462
we can't ignore the fact
that her behavior is fucking insane.

397
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,569
I'm sorry.

398
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:06,759
Hey.

399
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,077
Do you ever hear things
hit the roof at night?

400
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,576
No.

401
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,916
Maybe it's pinecones?

402
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,282
Where did you pick up gardening?

403
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,785
There was a garden where I lived.

404
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:45,288
You're good.
I'm good at some things.

405
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,466
I know you are.

406
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,635
Was he ever physical with you?

407
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,002
Who?
Your boyfriend.

408
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,403
What do you mean?

409
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,405
Did he ever hit you?

410
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,208
No.

411
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,277
You had a bruised ear...

412
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:10,247
and when you called me,
you were hysterical.

413
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,459
I never noticed.

414
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:16,653
Are you sure he didn't hit you?
Yeah.

415
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,989
You can tell me.

416
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,167
He never hit me.

417
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,162
I wish you felt more comfortable
talking to me.

418
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,463
I do.
So talk.

419
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:29,176
There's nothing to talk about.

420
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:34,511
I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left.
That's it.

421
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,919
Not everything has to be a big deal.

422
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,959
- Hey, don't stare.
- No.

423
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,335
No.

424
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,047
You okay?
Yeah.

425
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,579
He's right.
I don't know why I'm so weak.

426
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,547
You're not.

427
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,350
You'll quit.

428
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:06,930
Who's that?

429
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:10,110
Her name is Sarah, I think.

430
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,103
You should handle her.

431
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,273
You think?
Yeah, you're ready.

432
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:20,420
Zoe can help, but you'll be great.

433
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,288
Jesus.

434
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,253
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

435
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,721
- Katie, this is Sarah.
- Hi, Sarah.

436
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,157
Zoe and Marcy May.

437
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,938
- Hi.
- Hi.

438
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,799
We share all this.
So if it fits, you can wear it.

439
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,443
Cool.

440
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,809
And this is where we sleep.

441
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,217
You can take any bed that's open
or, uh... you can sleep downstairs.

442
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,822
- I'm hungry. Can we eat?
- We don't eat until the evening.

443
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,991
- Really?
- You'll get used to it.

444
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:11,294
Your body doesn't need that much food.

445
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,997
Hi. Hi.

446
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,300
He's beautiful.

447
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,968
Who's the mother?
Katie.

448
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:22,409
But we all help out.

449
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,675
Is Patrick the father?
Uh-huh.

450
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,777
Come here. Oh, yeah.

451
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,149
Looks just like him.
Oh, oh.

452
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,487
All the kids here are boys.

453
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,995
He only has boys.

454
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,627
You're good with him.
Do you wanna hold him?

455
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:49,532
No. I don't...
I don't have to take care of them, do I?

456
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,501
No, not if you don't want to.

457
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:54,571
There are plenty of jobs you can do.

458
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:56,852
You'll find your role.

459
00:47:57,141 --> 00:48:01,048
It takes time to find your role
in a new family, huh?

460
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,379
Yeah.

461
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,752
I called my dad today
to ask for money.

462
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,320
Does Patrick know?

463
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,692
Yeah, he asked me to.

464
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:15,658
Sometimes if there's something
we need, I'll call.

465
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,529
Well, how was it?
Fine. They're not bad people.

466
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,969
Did he give you the money?

467
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,201
Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.

468
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,903
Did you tell him that you're not?

469
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,938
No, that's why he gives it to me.

470
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:32,812
I guess he'd rather pay for it
than think I'm sucking dick for it.

471
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:36,413
I've done drugs.

472
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:40,890
Not a lot,
but I tried pretty much everything.

473
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,919
Except heroin.

474
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,256
It's good to try everything at least once.
You find out who you are.

475
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,626
What about drinking? Do you drink?
No.

476
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:51,928
I have, but I don't.

477
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,432
Good. We don't drink.
It makes you angry and less focused.

478
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:59,068
Don't get the wrong idea, Sarah.
We don't really talk to our old families.

479
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,604
- I wouldn't call my dad anyway...
- Marcy.

480
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,540
<i>Hey.)'...</i>

481
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,878
Hey, have you met Sarah?

482
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,689
Sally, yeah.

483
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,260
That's enough.

484
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,169
Half. Half is fine.

485
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,778
Okay.

486
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,139
Excuse me.

487
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,969
I can finish this if you wanna go to bed.

488
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,337
I don't mind.

489
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,778
Why don't you get some sleep?
Okay.

490
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:32,130
Hi.

491
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:41,037
What...? What do I have to do?

492
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,682
Nothing you don't want to.

493
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:48,646
Drink this, it will help you relax.
Thanks.

494
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,392
It's herbal. It starts the cleansing.

495
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:00,366
We've all done it
so there's nothing to worry about.

496
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,374
Why do I have to wear this robe?
Heh.

497
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:22,817
I know it's a bit silly
but it's just part of it.

498
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,756
Oh, my God.
You look amazing.

499
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,088
Thanks.

500
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,835
You know,
this is your special night with him.

501
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,368
Enjoy it.

502
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,929
You'll be great.

503
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,709
Yeah.

504
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,534
I don't feel well.

505
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,679
It's okay, just lie down.

506
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,539
Shouldn't I start cooking?

507
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,876
Well, I just made a salad
and Ted is cooking the fish.

508
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,146
- I thought we were going to cook.
- We cooked last night.

509
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,051
Oh, yeah.

510
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:48,891
Do you ever have that feeling where
you can't tell if something is a memory...

511
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,536
or if it's something you dreamed?

512
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:56,808
Not really. No.

513
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,744
Do you blame me for anything?

514
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,490
No.

515
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,818
Like what?

516
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,451
I don't know.

517
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,854
I'm trying to figure out
why we stopped talking.

518
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,289
I don't really think about it.

519
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,434
Really?
Well, we were far apart.

520
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:34,237
Sometimes I wonder if maybe
I couldn't have taken better care of you.

521
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:36,639
The past doesn't matter.
It does matter.

522
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,441
Well, I took care of myself.

523
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:43,279
I know you did, but sometimes
I think I could've done more.

524
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,116
Stop.

525
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:54,026
You really never think about it?
No.

526
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,895
You're not angry with me?
God, I know you don't think much of me...

527
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,798
but I knew what I was doing then
and I still do.

528
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,444
No, Martha, I think the world of you.

529
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,471
Sometimes I just think
I should have come home...

530
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,406
and made sure you went to college.

531
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,476
You had so much potential.
I don't need your guidance now...

532
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:17,246
and I didn't then.
I am a teacher and a leader.

533
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:23,327
You just never let me be that.
But now, I am... I know who I am.

534
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:27,628
A teacher and a leader?

535
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:30,259
What are you talking about?

536
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,762
- I am always...
- Dinner's ready!

537
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:36,999
I was the one who encouraged you
to push yourself, always.

538
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,974
You were the one who shut me out.

539
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,706
- Martha...
- Just because we're sisters...

540
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:47,648
doesn't mean we need to talk about
everything that comes into your head.

541
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,462
TED:
Dinner's ready.

542
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,663
Come on, don't be rude.

543
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:25,016
So, what are your plans, Martha?

544
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,683
For what?

545
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,861
Um, life.

546
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,291
I don't know.

547
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,865
Are you thinking about
what you could do for a job?

548
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,173
No.

549
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:47,637
<i>You're at an age when you need to start
thinking about a proper career.</i>

550
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,040
Why?

551
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,412
It is a part of adult life.

552
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,412
There are other ways to live.

553
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,159
- Really?
- Sure.

554
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,394
Like what?

555
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,223
I don't know.

556
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:10,359
People don't need careers.
People should just exist.

557
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:16,532
He's just saying we should start talking
about what you are interested in.

558
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,302
We can come up with some ideas
that we can put together...

559
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:23,906
But there are moments in my life when I
would love to just go to France and exist.

560
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:28,212
- You can do that if you want to.
- It is not that simple.

561
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:34,150
You know, it's not your fault,
but you learned to measure success...

562
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:37,557
<i>by money and possessions.</i>

563
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:41,095
It's just not the right way to live.

564
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:46,074
It's not the right way to live?

565
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:54,047
What is the right way to live exactly?

566
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:57,340
Martha, what is the right way
to live? Hm?

567
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:59,712
Is it, um...
vanishing off the face of the earth,

568
00:57:59,713 --> 00:58:01,477
not calling your family
for two years...

569
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,580
or until they're worried sick,
is that the right way to live?

570
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:07,650
Or is it living without possessions
until you need someone...

571
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,785
and then turning up on our doorstep...

572
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:13,356
where you know you can get some?
Is that the right way to live? No, no.

573
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,524
You sit there,
lecturing us about our lives.

574
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:19,362
And so far, I have not witnessed one sign
that you have any values of your own.

575
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:22,164
You should remember
that you are living under my roof.

576
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,101
You are eating my food
and you should watch your mouth...

577
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:28,815
because you are rude.
You don't know anything about it.

578
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,920
Hello?

579
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,747
<i>Hello?</i>

580
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,857
Who's this?

581
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,220
<i>Who's this?</i>

582
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,232
<i>Zoe?</i>

583
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,656
Is she not there?

584
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,726
<i>She's not.</i>

585
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,602
Where is she?

586
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,167
<i>Who is this?</i>

587
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,442
Who's this?

588
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,637
<i>Marlene Lewis.</i>

589
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,508
<i>Who's this?</i>

590
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:13,079
<i>Marcy?</i>

591
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,754
Steal.

592
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:50,513
Have you seen my brother?

593
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:53,124
He's got really red hair
and a bunch of freckles.

594
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,950
Good job.

595
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,652
- Very nice.
- Hey.

596
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,522
- Let's mind our own beeswax, huh?
- Heh, okay.

597
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:05,899
I'm seriously the best one at this
and no one will out-fast my hands.

598
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,596
Yes. Oh, God.

599
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,698
Oh, God, you are so hot
when you shoot.

600
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,034
You know that?
This just makes my willy hard.

601
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,803
Get off me.
Thank you. I'm set.

602
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,006
All right, Marcy, let's have fun.

603
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,643
Make sure your knees
are smooth and loose...

604
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:25,047
and your heart is in the right place.
Max, is this just an excuse to grape Marcy?

605
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,850
I'm teaching her how to shoot, okay?

606
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:33,191
And then you just squeeze.

607
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,024
Hi, Patrick.
Nice shot.

608
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,463
<i>Hey.)'...</i>

609
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,497
Focus.

610
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,207
Take a deep breath.

611
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:48,146
Feel the tension leaving your stomach
and moving to your hands.

612
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:53,177
Think of someone who hurt you,
who lied to you. Feel it.

613
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,078
Feel how they made you feel.

614
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,188
Let it build.

615
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:01,189
Let it transfer to the gun.

616
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,529
Building in the gun.

617
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,860
Breathe out.

618
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:07,856
Release.

619
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:14,741
Feels good, right?
Yeah.

620
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,499
Now try that.

621
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,602
What do you mean?
Shoot it.

622
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:24,175
They're living animals.
So shoot Max then.

623
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:29,679
Yeah, go ahead. Let's get it up.

624
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,929
Breathe.

625
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,358
- Go on.
- All right, fuck this.

626
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:44,002
Don't walk away from me, Max.

627
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,675
The cat has terminal cancer.

628
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,708
- It's in excruciating pain.
- I can't.

629
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,571
You know, Max has no substance.

630
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:58,207
He's just here to freeload,
be around the girls.

631
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,249
But you're different.

632
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,778
You're a teacher and a leader.

633
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,281
You don't see it
because no one let you believe it.

634
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:09,218
You're a teacher and a leader, Marcy.
Now prove it.

635
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:12,621
That cat reminds you of some fluffy thing
you think you used to love.

636
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:17,893
You're clinging
to some misguided emotion.

637
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:26,068
So I could spend my life being selfish,
living alone and using this gift for me...

638
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:30,439
but I've sacrificed
in order to be what you need me to be.

639
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,974
Why don't you trust me?
I do.

640
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,642
Then you shouldn't need me
to explain everything.

641
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:44,429
Why...? Why did you do that?

642
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,064
You said it was sick.

643
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,901
One of them was sick.
Zoe knew which one it was.

644
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,738
Sorry.

645
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,157
Try again?

646
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,294
My sweetheart

647
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,397
Come here.

648
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,366
Ready.

649
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,442
Aim.

650
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,937
You shouldn't smoke.
What?

651
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:43,965
I don't smoke.
Especially if you're trying to have a kid.

652
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,803
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

653
01:11:56,746 --> 01:12:00,323
I can't deal with talking to anybody
right now.

654
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,337
Press them together.

655
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,012
I think that's better.

656
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,861
You look really pretty.

657
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:45,672
Thanks.

658
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:52,868

- Let go of me.

701
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,376
- Martha, take a deep breath.
- No. No.

702
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,178
- What is going on?
- I have no idea.

703
01:15:50,179 --> 01:15:52,380
Martha, take a deep breath.
Come on.

704
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,583
You're all right. You're all right.

705
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:02,057
Martha, please try to breathe.
Please try to breathe.

706
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:06,829
Can you tell me what you're talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

707
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,414
Please try to breathe.

708
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:28,950
There you go.

709
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:30,452
Swallow.

710
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:33,421
There you go. Okay.

711
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,726
Okay. Okay, look at me.

712
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,986
- Hi. Hey.
- What the fuck?

713
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,829
Um...

714
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:14,162
We can go.

715
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,832
What do you want?

716
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,029
Nothing.

717
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:23,898
No, there's no need for that.

718
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,734
Um, we're leaving now.

719
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:29,037
So come on, guys.

720
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,840
Hmm?

721
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,612
Sorry.

722
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,189
- Jesus Christ.
- Calm down.

723
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,562
If you calm down, no one will get hurt.

724
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,695
What do you want?

725
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,004
We don't want anything.

726
01:18:53,429 --> 01:18:56,497
Get out.
We were looking at the house. It's nice.

727
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,369
We wouldn't have come in
if we knew you were here.

728
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:01,903
Just leave.

729
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:05,651
I would, but I can't be sure
you won't call the police.

730
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,579
I won't.

731
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:12,747
You didn't take anything?
Mm-mm.

732
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:16,086
So just go.

733
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,695
I just want to make sure my family is safe.
Safe?

734
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,461
Why wouldn't anyone be safe?

735
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:29,606
Unless you call the police,
everything will be fine.

736
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,535
I won't.

737
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:38,875
I give you my word, so please go.

738
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:47,921
Get the fuck out of my house.

739
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:10,883
Marcy, go now.

740
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,646
I got it.

741
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:51,824
Go on.

742
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,122
All right.

743
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,529
Oh, fuck.

744
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:16,472
Hey.

745
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:19,176
Martha.

746
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:23,511
Hey, I made you some tea.

747
01:21:23,512 --> 01:21:25,519
Thanks, Mom.

748
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:29,828
If it's too hot,
you can just blow on it, okay?

749
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,539
Sorry I ruined the party.

750
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,976
You didn't ruin the party. It's fine.

751
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:52,740
Is it over?
Mm-hm.

752
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,078
You slept through the night.

753
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:57,755
That's good.

754
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:06,564
Do you wanna try to sit up
and drink the tea?

755
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,992
No, I don't need it.

756
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:31,285
<i>- You okay?
- Mm-hm.</i>

757
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,898
You know that death...

758
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:44,362
is the most beautiful
part of life, right?

759
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:51,069
Death is beautiful
because we all fear death.

760
01:22:54,102 --> 01:23:00,819
And fear is the most amazing emotion of all
because it creates complete awareness.

761
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,883
It brings you to now...

762
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,927
and that makes you truly present.

763
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:17,635
And when you're truly' present,
that's nirvana.

764
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,466
That's pure love.

765
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:25,937
So death is pure love.

766
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,535
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, is Watts there?</i>

767
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:39,046
<i>- Who is this?
- Jane. Is Watts there?</i>

768
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:43,044
<i>- Can I help you?
- Who is this?</i>

769
01:24:43,045 --> 01:24:44,579
Marlene Lewis.

770
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,347
What's your last name, Jane?

771
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:48,683
<i>Heller. Sorry, do I
have the right number?</i>

772
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:51,157
I don't know. Do you?

773
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:53,688
<i>- It's a Jane.
- What?</i>

774
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:55,423
Jane.

775
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,226
Hello?

776
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:00,730
Hey, how are you?

777
01:25:01,964 --> 01:25:05,711
Uh, sure, let's do it.
I'll be around there on Friday.

778
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,909
No, that was my cousin Marlene.

779
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,082
Okay, sure.

780
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:17,918
All right, I'll see you then.
I'm glad you called.

781
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,923
All right. Bye.

782
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,530
<i>Hey.)'...</i>

783
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,448
Marcy.

784
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:51,322
We don't eat until they're finished.

785
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,256
You know better.

786
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,724
I know. Sorry, Katie.

787
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:01,463
<i>- Who's Katie?
- What?</i>

788
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:09,839
Why don't you go sit down
and I'll finish this?

789
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:40,266
- What's going on?
- Who the fuck knows?

790
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:47,134
- She needs to see someone.
- I know.

791
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:51,383
Okay. I'll start looking
into places tomorrow.

792
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,717
Places?

793
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:57,956
I don't think she should
stay with us any more.

794
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:06,662
We can't do anything for her
when she's like this.

795
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:15,037
I don't wanna talk about it any more, okay?

796
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,047
Zoe.

797
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,213
Yeah?

798
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:38,721
I can't stop thinking about that man.

799
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,832
I know.

800
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,608
It just happens, though.

801
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,238
We're never really dead or alive.

802
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:59,573
We just exist.

803
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:02,877
So he's still existing,
but it's in a parallel time.

804
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:05,249
Just don't think about it.

805
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:10,054
Patrick?

806
01:28:10,252 --> 01:28:12,054
Yes?

807
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:23,097
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt...

808
01:28:23,098 --> 01:28:29,781
but I've heard some of the girls
talking outside.

809
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:41,225
It's Zoe. Can we talk?

810
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,824
Will you let me in?

811
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,706
Get over it.
You haven't learned anything.

812
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:08,042
- I have.
- I thought we had a connection.

813
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:10,323
- We do.
- Show me.

814
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:30,500
Maybe I asked too much from you
too soon.

815
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:36,805
I'll expect less of you
from now on, okay?

816
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:49,654
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. Shh.

817
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,027
You're my favorite...

818
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,668
and I won't lose you.

819
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,853
Martha.

820
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:21,058
Martha.

821
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:24,563
Martha.

822
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:30,524
Oh, fuck.

823
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,226
- Are you all right?
- Fuck. Yes.

824
01:30:32,227 --> 01:30:35,062
- Jesus. What happened?
- She kicked me down the stairs.

825
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:38,098
- She what?
- She kicked me down the fucking stairs!

826
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:42,603
Christ! I mean,
what is it gonna fucking take, Lucy?

827
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:45,105
What the fuck is wrong with you?

828
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:47,107
- I was confused.
- About what?

829
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,110
What are you confused about?
I thought he was someone else.

830
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:54,188
You thought he was someone else?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

831
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:59,119
I'm not doing this any more.
Okay, I'm not gonna do this any more.

832
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,790
I have beat myself up over you for years
and I am sick of it.

833
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:06,727
I am sick of chasing you down
and worrying about you.

834
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:08,939
I'm sorry.

835
01:31:08,997 --> 01:31:13,473
You need help, Martha.
I know.

836
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:16,279
What happened to you?

837
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,745
What happened?
I don't know!

838
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:35,729
We're gonna get you some proper help.

839
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:40,995
Are you gonna send me away?

840
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,496
I don't know how to help you

841
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,666
Please don't. Please.
I can't help you, Martha.

842
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:49,471
Please, I can't be alone. Please.

843
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:51,575
No.

844
01:31:52,774 --> 01:31:54,576
No.

845
01:31:56,144 --> 01:32:00,483
We're trying to have a family
and I don't feel safe with you here.

846
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:04,297
- Lucy.
- What?

847
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,361
What?

848
01:32:08,656 --> 01:32:11,835
You're gonna be a terrible mother.

849
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:34,452
Do you have any money left?

850
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,152
No?

851
01:32:38,153 --> 01:32:40,694
No, I didn't think you did.

852
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:48,136
We'll make sure everything
is taken care of.

853
01:33:07,382 --> 01:33:09,093
Hey.

854
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,992
You're going swimming?
Yeah.

855
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:19,893
It's a bit chilly.

856
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:22,037
I don't mind.

857
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:31,683
I think we both said some things last night
that we didn't mean.

858
01:33:32,307 --> 01:33:34,109
Yeah.

859
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:51,458
We scheduled an appointment for you
for tomorrow morning.

860
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,739
What's it like there?

861
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:57,974
It looks nice.

862
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,477
It's not that far from us.

863
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:11,979
We head back to the city
in about an hour.

864
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,624
You're gonna be ready, right?
Yeah.

865
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,068
What the hell is he doing?

866
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:20,578
Fucking lunatic.

867
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,610
- God. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

868
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:26,255
He just came out of nowhere.

869
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:14,094
<i>The ghost of her</i>

870
01:37:14,095 --> 01:37:16,363
<i>Floats over there</i>

871
01:37:16,364 --> 01:37:20,367
<i>And her smile, her smile, it seems</i>

872
01:37:20,368 --> 01:37:23,911
<i>So lonely</i>

873
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:29,609
<i>She gave me her hand</i>

874
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:34,214
<i>As I struck up the band
And she seemed to say</i>

875
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:38,930
<i>She seemed to say
"You're the only"</i>

876
01:37:40,488 --> 01:37:44,291
<i>Then we danced like two snow?akes</i>

877
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:49,007
<i>In the falling wind, in the wind</i>

878
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:54,735
<i>And do me a favor, God</i>

879
01:37:54,736 --> 01:37:58,176
<i>Won't you let Marlene come in?</i>

880
01:38:01,676 --> 01:38:05,846
<i>The gymnasium door</i>

881
01:38:05,847 --> 01:38:09,549
<i>The brass bound door</i>

882
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:14,162
<i>The jungle bird, the jungle bird
That you showed me</i>

883
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:20,727
<i>Her love was so clean</i>

884
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:24,664
<i>To tell the truth, Marlene</i>

885
01:38:24,665 --> 01:38:29,880
<i>The sound of your tambourine
Still haunts me</i>

886
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:35,208
<i>We were so young then</i>

887
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:39,855
<i>Now that I'm old I know
Oh, I know</i>

888
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:45,585
<i>I loved you right then</i>

889
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:49,424
<i>I would've made Marlene let go</i>

890
01:38:54,796 --> 01:38:57,964
<i>My friends in the bars</i>

891
01:38:57,965 --> 01:39:00,901
<i>Hell, they only see the scars</i>

892
01:39:00,902 --> 01:39:04,538
<i>And they do not give a damn
They do not give a damn</i>

893
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:06,682
<i>That I loved you</i>

894
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:13,447
<i>I don'! know why</i>

895
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:17,617
<i>But once you've seen the sky</i>

896
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:22,731
<i>You think you know all
birds are lovely</i>

897
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:27,060
<i>But there's snow on the ground</i>

898
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:32,606
<i>In Woodstock tonight</i>

899
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:37,814
<i>It's 22 years dead</i>

900
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:43,544
<i>Since I saw the light</i>

901
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:50,684
<i>The world did explode</i>

902
01:39:50,685 --> 01:39:53,753
<i>At such a high-powered load</i>

903
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:56,656
<i>To run, to run, to run</i>

904
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:59,961
<i>Was all I left me</i>

905
01:40:01,796 --> 01:40:05,365
<i>Up here there's breeze</i>

906
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:08,435
<i>High in the clouds we're free</i>

907
01:40:08,436 --> 01:40:14,311
<i>To fly, to fly away was the lesson</i>

908
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:19,515
<i>And though the fire
That burned her life out</i>

909
01:40:20,314 --> 01:40:24,824
<i>Left me a little more</i>

910
01:40:25,887 --> 01:40:28,861
<i>lam a crippled singer</i>

911
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:33,931
<i>And it evens up the score</i>

912
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:41,034
<i>The ghost of her</i>

913
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,004
<i>It floats over there</i>

914
01:40:44,005 --> 01:40:47,474
<i>And her smile, her smile, it seems</i>

915
01:40:47,475 --> 01:40:49,686
<i>Seems so lonely</i>

916
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:56,583
<i>She gave me her hand</i>

917
01:40:56,584 --> 01:41:01,221
<i>As I struck up the band
And she seemed to say</i>

918
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:05,902
<i>She seemed to say
"You're the only"</i>

919
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:11,097
<i>And then we danced
like two snow?akes</i>

920
01:41:11,098 --> 01:41:16,313
<i>In the falling wind, in the wind</i>

921
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:21,408
<i>And do me a favor, God</i>

922
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:25,156
<i>Won't you let Marlene come in?</i>

923
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:30,917
<i>And do me a favor, God</i>

924
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:36,258
<i>Won't you let Marlene come in?</i>
