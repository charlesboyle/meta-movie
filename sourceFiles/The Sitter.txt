<i>I'll make you feel at home</i>

(GIRL BREATHING HEAVILY)

5
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,050
<i>Now let's pour a glass of wine</i>

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,469
<i>'Cause now we're all alone</i>

(GIRL CONTINUES MOANING)

8
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,718
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,644
<i>Girl you make me feel real good</i>

10
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,194
That's right.

11
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,568
What's up?

12
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,490
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,910
My mom was so right.

14
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,238
Nice guys really do
eat the best pussy.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,618
I'm not really sure how to
interpret that. Thank you?

16
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:13,870
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

17
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,917
How are you so good at that?

18
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,586
I'll let you in
on a trade secret.

19
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,460
I actually write a short story
with my tongue every time I do it.

20
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,541
It follows this young kid

21
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,422
who finds this
alien in the woods

22
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,344
with all these
Reese's Pieces and stuff.

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,514
And he learns that
aliens are just no different.

24
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,715
You just can
connect with anyone.

25
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,974
It's kind of like E.
T., only with a lot more going down on chicks.

26
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,144
Cool beans.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,267
Yeah, cool beans.

28
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,189
Definitely. Cool little
frozen beans.

29
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,357
Yeah.

30
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,185
All right, so...

31
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,236
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

32
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,985
Yeah, we should, uh...

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,107
We should probably...
Yeah, you should probably go.

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,533
Switch places.

35
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,031
What's that?

36
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,529
(LAUGHS)

37
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,205
I figured...
Don't you have to go?

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,332
No, no, I just figured because
I made "mouth love" to you

39
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,756
that maybe you could return the favor.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,295
What?

41
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,047
Maybe toss a BJ my way.

42
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,878
If you have time.

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,714
Um, my stomach is
super-iffy right now.

44
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,347
I think I got food poisoning.

45
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,928
Baby.

46
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:20,687
So I'm just in no condition
to blow you right now, Noah.

47
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,689
No, yeah, that's cool.
Okay.

48
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,612
Sorry. Next time, sweetie.

49
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,236
Are you sure you don't
want to come over tonight?

50
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,317
There's this thing called
a geomagnetic storm.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,495
It's really cool
and rare, actually.

52
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,322
It's like
an astronomical explosion

53
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,157
in the sky of all
these beautiful colors.

54
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,084
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

55
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,082
Kind of like
Mother Nature's fireworks.

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,038
It happens, like, almost never.

57
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,839
Like I said,
I'm just not feeling good.

58
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,134
But thank you so much
for going down on me.

59
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,555
Oh, yeah. You're really good
at, um, getting going down on,

60
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,473
getting downed on,

61
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,970
so you should be proud
of that as well.

62
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,427
Okay, cool. You da man!

63
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,853
You da man.

64
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,351
Peace. You're
the best, sweetie.

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,524
Don't stop believing in
yourself, okay, Maris?

66
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,897
<i>Uncle Ricky, could you
read us a bedtime story?</i>

67
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,856
<i>Please, huh, please?</i>

68
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,195
<i>Here we go</i>

69
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,371
<i>Once upon a time, not long ago</i>

70
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,869
<i>Where people wore pajamas
and lived life slow</i>

71
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,168
<i>Where laws were stern
and justice stood</i>

72
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,416
<i>And people were behavin'
like they ought to good</i>

73
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,623
<i>There lived a little boy
who was misled</i>

74
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,084
<i>By another little boy
and this is what he said</i>

75
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,464
<i>Me and you Tike,
we're gonna make some cash</i>

76
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,888
<i>Robbin' old folks
and makin' the dash</i>

77
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,182
<i>They did the job,
money came with ease</i>

78
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,305
<i>But one couldn't stop,
it's like he had a disease</i>

79
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,853
<i>He robbed another and another
and a sister and a brother</i>

80
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,226
<i>Tried to rob a man
who was a D. T. undercover</i>

81
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,433
<i>The cop grabbed his arm,
he started actin' erratic</i>

82
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,860
<i>He said, "Keep still boy,
no need for static"</i>

83
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,150
<i>Punched him in his belly
and gave him a slap</i>

84
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,527
<i>But little did he know,
the little boy was strapped</i>

85
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,075
<i>The kid pulled outta gun,
he said, "Why'd you hit me?"</i>

86
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,245
<i>The barrel was set straight
for the cop's kidney</i>

87
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,663
<i>Ran up the stairs
up to the top floor</i>

88
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,867
<i>Opened up a door,
there guess who he saw</i>

89
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,085
<i>Dave, the dope fiend
shootin' dope</i>

90
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,413
<i>Who don't know the meaning
of water nor soap?</i>

91
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,793
<i>He said, "I need bullets,
hurry up, run "</i>

92
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,171
<i>The dope fiend rolled back
a spankin' shot gun</i>

93
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,594
<i>This ain't funny,
so don't ya dare laugh</i>

94
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,922
<i>Just another case
about the wrong path</i>

95
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,679
<i>Straight and narrow
or your soul gets cast</i>

96
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,472
<i>Good night</i>

97
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,349
Yo, Mom, what's up?

98
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,480
Noah!

99
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,153
Where were you?
Were you out with that girl again?

100
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,821
Yeah, but she's not
"that girl," okay?

101
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,150
We're in a relationship.
It's legit.

102
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,326
So have you started
looking for a job yet?

103
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,995
I can't afford to have you
sitting around all day.

104
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,951
You're in a period of stasis.
Just a stage of stasis.

105
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,081
Sorry.

106
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,788
<i>You sure you don't
want that beer now?</i>

107
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,919
<i>Or maybe something stronger?
I have absinthe.</i>

108
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,589
Why can't we hit up Dad?
He owes us 10 years of alimony.

109
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,961
Oh, look, kiddo.

110
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,218
If you're looking for a handout,
think again times 10.

111
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,720
That guy's a diamond dealer.
He has crazy cash.

112
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,393
Why'd you marry
such an A-hole?

113
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,475
That A-hole gave me the
greatest gift in the world.

114
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,726
Crabs?

115
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,857
He gave me you.

116
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,981
Okay.
(LAUGHS)

117
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,186
So, tell me, what do you think?

118
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,737
Do I look okay?
You look amazing.

119
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,690
Why are you so
concerned with your outfit?

120
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,616
Mrs. Pedulla is introducing
me to a surgeon

121
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,406
at the fundraiser at
the Historical Society.

122
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,657
Okay.

123
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,238
She thinks we're going
to hit it off. Nice.

124
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,198
Well, don't give
it up too easily.

125
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,658
Give what up?
What?

126
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,618
Give what up?
What did...

127
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,120
What the hell are
you talking about?

128
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,204
I don't know.

129
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,834
Have fun. I love you. Okay?
I love you.

130
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,419
(KISSING)

131
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,010
Hey, Mom.
Yeah.

132
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,928
I think you're going to
have a really great night,

133
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,005
and you look beautiful.

134
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,091
Oh. From your lips
to God's ears.

135
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,553
<i>Scientists are predicting a giant
storm over the city tonight.</i>

136
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,855
<i>A geomagnetic storm, that is.</i>

137
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,898
<i>Caused by ﬂare-ups on the
sun,</i> (PHONE RINGING)

<i>this rare storm affects

139
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,020
Noah, can you get the phone?

140
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,197
Mom, the phone's ringing!

141
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,650
Noah, please get the phone!

142
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,993
Mom, the phone's ringing!
Do you hear it?

143
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,284
Noah, can't you think about somebody
else besides yourself for once?

144
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,365
No, I totally was.
That's why I said the phone was ringing.

145
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,700
I was letting you
know that it was ringing.

146
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,911
Yeah. I'm thrilled
about tonight.

147
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,923
<i>You flip, but they flop.
You flip, but they flop!</i>

148
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,046
What? Oh, is that right?

149
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,923
NOAH: They perfected
the pancake?

150
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,219
A rain check?

151
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,421
It's a perfect pancake!

152
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,177
No, that's fine.
It's perfect.

153
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,426
Mom, tell whoever's
on the phone

154
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,634
that there's a perfect pancake.

155
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,557
Thanks.

156
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,268
I'm not going after all.

157
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,940
What? Why?

158
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,395
The Pedullas' sitter
canceled at the last minute.

159
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,315
What?

160
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,901
Do I have shit on my face?

161
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,237
Come on. Don't tell me
you can't use the money.

162
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,618
Are you crazy?
No. I'm not Mary Poppins.

163
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,450
I'm not gonna be a babysitter.
I'm an adult man.

164
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,252
Okay'? Babysitting sucks.
Adult men don't babysit things.

165
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,922
Oh, Noah, you're
wonderful with children!

166
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,417
You know, never mind.

167
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,175
Who am I kidding?
Finding a guy at my age is ridiculous.

168
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,259
I'm going to change
my dress. (EXHALES)

169
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,894
What are you in
the mood for? Chinese?

170
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,809

God, I haven't see you since
you were, like, 15.

Yeah. So Dr. Pedulla, he's still alive?
You two are still together?

Um...

181
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,882
Oh! That's my kind
of TV, right there.

182
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,305
Yeah, well, feel free to
watch anything you want.

00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,642
Anyway, honey, this is Noah.
He's going to be babysitting tonight.

What happened to Nancy?

187

Honey, we talked about this.

188

tract infection, okay?

Is Clayton coming over tonight?

190
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,405
No, Mom. His tarantula
died from parasites,

191
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,823

192

Well, you're in luck, Noah.

193

man up and babysit,

It's a hot name.

NOAH: Yeah.

692
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,843
JULIO: Yeah!
KARL: Put out your hand.

693
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,557
Here's one ticket.

694
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,730
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

695
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,227
How do you know Marisa?

696
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,684
You know Marisa?

697
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,360
She is my girlfriend, actually.

698
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,944
(LAUGHING)

699
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,616
Come on, man, stop it!

700
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,365
Karl.

701
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,287
There's some kid here.

702
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,456
KARL: You didn't call
the fuzz, did you, Noah?

703
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,033
No. Rodrigo.

704
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,787
What are you doing? Go back to the car.
How'd you even get in here?

705
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,463
I pee-pee now.

706
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,628
He's with you?

707
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,924
Yeah, I'm, uh babysitting.

708
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,047
Babysitting?

709
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,753
You need to go back to the car,

710
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,383
because you already
went pee-pee. Okay?

711
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,306
I pee-pee.
Pee your pants.

712
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,224
What's your problem, man?
Let him take a piss!

713
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,893
Trying to make a little kid
hold in his pee-pee!

714
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,686
That's right. <i>Oye,</i> Fonzie.

715
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,560
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

716
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,558
You go pee-pee

717
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,767
KARL: Don't make a mess!

718
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,147
Come in for a bear hug.

719
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,192
Get outta here.
Put that handshake away.

720
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,148
Better hug this motherfucker if
you know what's good for you.

721
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,654
Hug him tight!

722
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,987
Swordfight up in this motherfucker!
Pull it together!

723
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,071
(GROANS)

724
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,997
KARL: Have a great night.
(GRUNTS)

725
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,706
Okay, I know we had a few
setbacks, but we're almost done.

726
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,833
I just gotta drop off this
package to my girlfriend,

727
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,505
say a quick hi-ho to her,

728
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,423
then I'm going to turn us
around and take us home.

729
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,918
I know I can be a bit
of a prick sometimes,

730
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,798
so I want to thank you guys
for being patient.

731
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,254
BLITHE: Okay,
so we're gonna go

732
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,634
to my favorite
club in New York City,

733
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,805
and you're gonna come...

734
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,882
Hey, buddy, what you got there?

735
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:19,933
RODRIGO: I no know.

736
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,260
I find it in bathroom.

737
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,016
Shit!

738
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,442
Rodrigo,
give that to me right now.

739
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,191
I'm serious, man.
Give it to me right now.

740
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,647
No way. Finder keepers.

741
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,027
Put it in my hand right now!

742
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,154
No.

743
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,485
Rodrigo.
No.

744
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,410
Just... Just let go!

745
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,121
It's mine.

746
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,743
Let it go!
Just give it to me!

747
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,367
BLITHE: You're both such booger faces.
Stop fighting!

748
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,544
Let go!
Okay.

749
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,214
It's snowing!

750
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,671
What the fuck?

751
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,222
(PHONE RINGING)

752
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,481
Hello?
<i>Noah Griffith!</i>

753
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,029
Hey!

754
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,607
Hey, Karl, what's up?
How did you get this number?

755
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,408
I got it off
your Facebook page,

756
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,111
as I was trying to friend you
as you were walking out.

757
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,414
Anyway, as I was friending
you, Julio noticed that

758
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,867
maybe you stole a baby
dinosaur egg from me.

759
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,078
And it's just,
like, I'm confused.

760
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,131
You know what I mean?
Because I'm thinking that we're friends,

761
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,835
and then all of a sudden,
I don't know, it's like...

762
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,713
I really liked you, you know?

763
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,390
Karl, just relax, please.
I'm sorry, I don't have your drugs.

764
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,468
<i>The kid I'm babysitting,
he took one of your eggs,</i>

765
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,765
<i>and I was trying to get it back</i>

766
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,061
<i>and it accidentally
splashed in my face.</i>

767
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,980
<i>Fucking shut the fuck up.</i>

768
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,440
<i>Unless I get my drugs back</i>

769
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,110
<i>or my money back,
I'm going to kill you!</i>

770
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,859
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

771
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,814
<i>I want you to meet me
at Wing's Fish Market.</i>

772
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:58,899
Where?

773
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,326
Wing's Fish Market.
It's in Chinese Town.

774
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,535
<i>You meet me there in one hour with
my 10 grand, or you're dead meat.</i>

775
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,708
Um, okay. Thanks, bye.

776
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,293
I have to go pee-pee now.

777
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,001
You're holding it in
this time, asshole.

778
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,176
It'll be all right.

779
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,353
I thought he was my friend.

780
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,276
It's all right.

781
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,700
Shut up!
I wanna go home.

782
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,911
(SPEAKS SPANISH) I don't
know what you're saying.

783
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,407
Don't. Stop it!
Stop! No!

784
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,909
BLITHE: No, my lip gloss!
Give it back!

785
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,912
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

786
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,243
What are you
getting mad at us for?

787
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,580
Because Rodrigo here is a thief,
and now I'm in deep shit.

788
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,461
And the worst
part of all of this

789
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,292
is that I'm stuck
here with you three.

790
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,174
You, you got more issues
than a magazine stand.

791
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,301
And, you, wipe the makeup
off your face, Picasso.

792
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,428
What are you, a mob wife?

793
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,680
And, you, you're the worst.

794
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,432
I know you're a little kid,
and I know I'm not

795
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,184
supposed to say this
kind of stuff to you,

796
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,523
but fuck you.

797
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,316
Fuck you so much.

798
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,609
You're a douche.

799
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,437
Look, Noah,
if you hate us that much,

800
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,272
then just drop us
off with our parents.

801
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,030
You know what?
That's an amazing idea. Let's go.

802
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,132
<i>I've seen the way
you look at me</i>

803
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,258
<i>I know the things you say
when I'm not there</i>

804
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,969
<i>But when you're here
alone with me</i>

805
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,560
<i>Baby, don't pretend
that you don't care</i>

806
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,315
<i>Come on, let the feeling begin</i>

807
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,944
<i>Come on, baby Come on, yeah</i>

808
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:09,280
<i>Don't stop
when the feeling begins</i>

809
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:15,202
Come on. I've changed my mind.
I need to clean up my mess myself.

810
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:20,378
All right, ideas,
ideas, ideas, ideas, ideas.

811
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,460
Okay. Slater,
can you get off the phone?

812
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,341
I need an idea. You can text
your buddy Clayton later, okay?

813
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,922
Yeah, man, seriously!

814
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,007
SLATER: It's not Clayton.
It's those twins,

815
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,842
and they want me to
go to Prospect Hall

816
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,644
for Wendy Sapperstein's
Bat Mitzvah.

817
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,222
That's, like, a pretty
swanky joint, right?

818
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,524
Yeah, the Sappersteins
are totally loaded

819
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,772
and she's, like, crazy spoiled.

820
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,898
Spoiled.

821
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,197
So lots of gifts, lots of cash.

822
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,277
Slater, you're a genius.
You're a genius, dude!

823
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,249
All right, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

824
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,622
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Hustle!

825
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,296
All right, come on, kids.
Come on.

826
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,215
All right, thank you.

827
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,883
BLITHE: This place
looks like a party.

828
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,461
NOAH: Keep walking,
keep walking.

829
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,801
WENDY: Maybe you should
just invite anyone you know,

830
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,008
anyone who's ugly, because
they seem to all be here!

831
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,972
MRS. SAPPERSTEIN:
That's very nice.

832
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,303
Is that what
the rabbis taught you?

833
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,139
Mom! This is my night.
It's my celebration,

834
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,725
and I did not invite these
nerds to my Bat Mitzvah!

835
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:23,108
What more can I do for you?
Rent the Taj Ma-fucking-hal for you?

836
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,986
There's so much blue cheese
here, it smells like barf, Mom!

837
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,069
Damn, Wendy Sapperstein's
a big ol' bitch!

838
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,448
Yeah, she scares me.

839
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,405
All right, guys, we're gonna
stay under the radar.

840
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,990
Okay? Keep it low profile.

841
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,416
Did you hear what I just said?

842
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,210
I said low profile!
All right?

843
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,294
Stop puncturing balloons!
Do you understand me? (SHUSHING)

844
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,752
Noah, Noah. Does this place
have bottle service?

845
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,212
I want a Red Bull and vodka.

846
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,512
No, you don't.
You don't even know

847
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,760
what that is.
It's bad for you.

848
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,682
Slater! You showed up!

849
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,555
We've been looking
all over for you!

850
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,806
Oh. Hey.

851
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,011
TWIN 1: We've been
dancing all night.

852
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,688
TWIN 2: Yeah, this Bat
Mitzvah is the best!

853
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,266
It's like Jew city out there,
and we're the fucking mayors.

854
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,396
You ready to go dance?

855
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,775
He's ready to go dance.
This guy was born to dance.

856
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,106
You want to come?
Come on. Let's go.

857
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,155
You big stud.

858
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,279
Time to go make
a Slater sandwich!

859
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,406
Some of that gingerbread,

It's Roxanne.

870
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,942
I lived in the dorms down the
hall from you, freshman year.

871
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,743
That's right.
We were in Astronomy, right?

872
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,286
Yeah, I sat behind
you in Astronomy.

873
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,581
We were, like, the only two
students who seemed to give a shit.

874
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,823
(CHUCKLES)
That's right. Yeah.

875
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,831
You made that scale model of
Saturn with a cantaloupe, right?

876
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,662
Oh, shit, yeah.
That was you.

877
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,418
That thing was fresh.
That was cool. Yeah, that was me.

878
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,750
Did you know about the
geomagnetic storm tonight?

879
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,717
I did. I'm gonna
check it out. Are you?

880
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,965
I'm actually kind
of excited for it.

881
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,259
Yeah. For sure.

No. No chair for me.

Yeah, I'm actually
not in school this year.

But I'm working
right now, obviously.

892
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,826
But once I get off work,

893
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,825
I'm going to a pool hall
with some of my co-workers.

894

Would you want to come?
Oh, cool.

895
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,208
That would be great,
but I'm actually

896
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,877
in the middle of
a situation currently.

897
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,705
Oh, yeah. No worries.
I just thought I'd ask.

with Benji Gillespie?

Look, I can hang out with as
many other people as I want.

918

I don't think you
understand that.

919
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,342
I'm getting kind of sick of going
to your house all the time

920

No, we don't!
You don't do anything!

I can't just
always hang around you.

924

I don't get why
you're being mean to me.

He doesn't want to hang out
with you any more, bro.

understand that?

Just stop calling and texting
him all the time. It's weird.

00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,989

have to say this to you.

you can't find my car?

taking a shit right now?

There's no "a little
bit" of taking a shit.

your pants or you're not.

my team of scientists,

958

have them invent a new perfume.

selling it and we'll have

being a celebrity and

1197
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,227
They're at least half crazy.
You're full-on nuts!

1198
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,440
They are not my brother and sister!
They are nothing to me!

1199
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,145
They are not my family!

1200
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,650
She does nothing
all day but paint

1201
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,073
her face like a <i>puta.</i>
She is a <i>puta!</i>

1202
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,191
And this one is
sick in the head!

1203
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,151
He goes to the head doctor
four times a week!

1204
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,328
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1205
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,155
HEY! Stop acting
crazy, okay?

1206
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,285
He is the crazy one.

1207
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,913
He has this medicine!
He <i>loco!</i> He <i>muy loco!</i>

1208
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,661
Hey, relax!
Shut up!

1209
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,997
You shut up with your stupid fanny pack!
I take your fanny pack!

1210
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,332
No! No! No, I need that!

1211
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,510
Stop it! I need that!
My pills! No! No!

1212
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,428
NOAH: What did
you do that for?

1213
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,505
SLATER: Pull over!
Pull over!

1214
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,589
Okay! Okay!

1215
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,558
SLATER: Right now! Right now!
NOAH: Okay! Okay!

1216
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,513
Slater! Where are you going?

1217
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,348
What the fuck is
your problem, man?

1218
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,603
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

1219
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,279
NOAH: Slater.

1220
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,943
You're not going to
find it, all right?

1221
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,446
I need those pills, okay?
I need them.

1222
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,618
No, you don't.

1223
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,866
Yes, I do, okay?
I have serious issues.

1224
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,323
You don't have serious issues.

1225
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,454
Yes, I do! Those pills are the
only thing that keep me normal,

1226
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,877
and I need them!

1227
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,545
I can't do this any more.

1228
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,418
Slater, you're gay, all right?

1229
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,258
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1230
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,676
Nothing. Never mind.

1231
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,003
Take that back!

1232
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,259
Take it back, Noah!

1233
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,182
You're gay. All right?

1234
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:55,387
You're as queer as a football
bat, and that's fine.

1235
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,642
And if your therapist hasn't
clued you into that by now,

1236
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,644
then you should ask
for your money back, pal.

1237
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,896
You ever think
the reason you're so upset

1238
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,024
your buddy Clayton doesn't
want to hang out any more

1239
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,606
is because you have a lot
of special feelings for him

1240
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,236
that maybe
he doesn't feel back?

1241
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,942
It breaks your heart, man.

1242
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,777
And that breaks my heart.

1243
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,658
'Cause I know
what that feels like.

1244
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,455
I feel it all the time.

1245
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,159
I don't want to be gay!
I'm not gay!

1246
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,577
Tough.

1247
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,583
I don't want to be a faggot!

1248
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,165
Hey! Do not say shit like that!
Do you understand me?

1249
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,210
This is the worst night
of my life.

1250
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,931
All right, high school
is going to suck.

1251
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,853
Coming out to your parents, it's
not gonna be a picnic, either.

1252
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,895
But trust me when I tell you

1253
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,474
that when you get to college,
nobody will care.

1254
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,106
And then,
when you graduate college,

1255
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,154
you'll get an awesome job
in the entertainment industry.

1256
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:51,109
You'll be super-organized and dress
really well, you'll smell good.

1257
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,660
Smell good? What are you
talking about, Noah?

1258
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,363
Relax. Listen to me.

1259
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,917
My dad hates me. All right?

1260
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,204
I got kicked out of college.

1261
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,541
(SIGHING)

1262
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:09,127
Before tonight,
this babysitting thing,

1263
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,507
I've only ever had one job,
and I was a lifeguard.

1264
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,464
I got fired after four days

1265
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,096
because I kept falling
asleep in the sun.

1266
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,678
I'm a constant
disappointment to my mom,

1267
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,855
who's the only
decent person in my life.

1268
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,897
I've been arrested
numerous times.

1269
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,943
I had a month-long, intense
addiction to Robitussin.

1270
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,275
There's only
one freak out here.

1271
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,607
You're looking at him.

1272
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,319
I've never had a gay thought in my
life, so what does that tell you?

1273
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,039
That tells me
you're pretty messed up.

1274
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,537
I have seen <i>Devil Wears Prada</i>
about 19 times,

1275
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,711
but that's because
it's a good movie.

1276
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,709
It's a good flick.

1277
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,962
<i>Devil Wears P.</i> You ever seen it?
<i>D Wears P?</i>

1278
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,506
I think, like, once.
I don't really remember it though.

1279
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:56,015
Nothing's wrong with you.
You're normal.

1280
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,810
Just super gay.

1281
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,060
You're a dick.

1282
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:07,609
(LAUGHS) Yes, that's true.
Enough of the pills, all right?

1283
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,233
Okay.

1284
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,860
You know,

1285
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,323
deep down, I think
I always kind of knew.

1286
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,659
(SIGHS) But don't tell
anybody yet, okay?

1287
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,831
I won't. I won't.

1288
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,288
What do you think
lam, an asshole?

1289
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,833
(LAUGHING) Yeah, sort of.

1290
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,426
Come on, Ricky Martin,
let's get out of here.

1291
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,128
SLATER: That's an example.

1292
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,049
Hey, Slater, are you okay?

1293
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,475
Yeah, I'm okay.

1294
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,928
Hey! That's Mom's car!

1295
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,057
NOAH: Are you sure?

1296
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,517
(BEEPING)

1297
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,398
All right.
Let's go! Let's go!

1298
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,317
BLITHE: Rodrigo’s jacket
must be in there!

1299
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,969
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1300
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,304
BLITHE: This is
my kind of club.

1301
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,806
SLATER: Let's just go home.
NOAH: No.

1302
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,934
All right? I have a half-hour
to get to this party,

1303
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,765
pay off Karl,
pick my girlfriend up

1304
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,600
off the floor,
get you kids home,

1305
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,436
and be home in time for my mom to
tell me how awesome her night was.

1306
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:36,399
I'm not gonna let some bullshit
car thief fuck this up for me.

1307
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,318
Hey.

1308
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,699
What's happening, my man?
How you doing, man?

1309
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,498
You know, this ain't
no place for no kids.

1310
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,416
These aren't kids,
these are little people.

1311
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,251
This woman's 48 years old.

1312
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,665
Her children have children.

1313
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,292
Hi. I'm a grandma.

1314
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,463
All right.

1315
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,711
What's your name, baby?

1316
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:54,883
They call me Soul, Soul Baby.

1317
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,881
Soul Baby?
Keep it in control, baby.

1318
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,052
I hear you, baby.

1319
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,129
My name's
Noah J-Bird. (CAWS)

1320
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,635
Noah J-Bird.

1321
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,432
Oh, you like to fly.
I fly, baby.

1322
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,721
Fly, fly, fly away, baby.

1323
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:04,927
In the clouds, no frowns.

1324
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,349
All right, now, that's
what I'm talking about.

1325
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,475
Tears, no fears, man.

1326
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,555
Is that right?

1327
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:09,856
Respect it, don't neglect it.

1328
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,685
All right. That's what I'm
talking about, baby. My brother.

1329
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,395
Treat it, don't beat it, my man.
All right, baby.

1330
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,985
You're a badass motherfucker.

1331
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,033
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1332
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,618
Hey.
(GROANS)

1333
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,366
God, man.
What's up, white boy?

1334
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,076
I'm here for my minivan.
What's up?

1335
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,662
(LAUGHS) Get out of here.

1336
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,168
What, are you stalking me now?
You're stealing my car?

1337
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,216
I'm serious.
Give me the keys.

1338
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,090
Look, homey, we got beef.
You understand that?

1339
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,386
Just give me the keys.

1340
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,181
Step back, homey!
This ain't where you belong!

1341
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,510
All right, you're going
to listen to me, okay?

1342
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,220
You're right, I threw up in
your grandmother's ashes.

1343
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,395
Hell, yeah, you did.

1344
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,518
It was an accident.

1345
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,814
Fucked up.

1346
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,018
I apologize from
the bottom of my heart.

1347
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:56,445
I have been stuck babysitting
these three kids.

1348
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,818
I was talked into buying
cocaine for my girlfriend,

1349
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:01,158
who I realize is not
even my girlfriend.

1350
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,528
She's just a girl
who occasionally

1351
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,112
lets me stick
my face in her crotch

1352
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,197
and who's mean to me all the time.
Okay? (ALL LAUGH)

1353
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,329
And this time, making her happy

1354
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,376
is probably
gonna get me killed.

1355
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:15,172
You're acting all gangster, stealing
cars, hanging out with thugs.

1356
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,290
Well, you know what?

1357
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,252
A few years ago we went to the
same lame-ass high school.

1358
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,759
The point is, you and I
are two fucked-up kids

1359
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,181
meeting on the playground.

1360
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:29,304
I came here for my motherfucking
keys to my motherfucking minivan,

1361
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,808
and that's what's up!

1362
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,892

00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,690
Is that supposed to be
a threat, little man?

1364
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,936
I ain't giving you shit.

1365
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,146
It's not a threat.

1366
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,607
I'm going to put both my
hands behind my back,

1367
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,193
and you get one punch to my
face as hard as you want.

1368
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,911
I can punch you in the face?

1369
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,533
You deserve to
punch me in the face.

1370
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,406
Go on, baby.
Punch him in the face.

Guess you ain't the little pussy
you used to be. Huh, Noah?

fall across your face, girl.

00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,022
I like your style, you dig?

I honestly might start DJ-ing here.
I don't know.

Okay, that's all right,

1418

but do you really think that this is
an appropriate place to bring kids?

I don't know. Look, Rodrigo's over
there chatting up some prostitutes.

Just me being cool.
Playing it cool.

1428
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,050
No big deal.

1431
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,069
So, did you drive here?

1432
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,521
No, I took a cab.

1433
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,113
Maybe you should
take my dad's car,

1434
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:29,408
because I can't drive
both of them anyways.

Are you serious?

1436
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,077
Yeah, it'd actually
really help me out.

Okay. How are
you gonna find me?

1438

all freshman year.

I don't know. I thought you
were really funny and smart

and seemed really sweet.

01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:11,234
I guess I was kind of nervous
to talk to you back then.

1533
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,474
Okay.

1534

1538
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,564
Have you seen Marisa?

1539
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,986
Who's Marisa?
She's my girlfriend.

1540
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,483
She's like my height,
blonde hair.

1541
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,274
No, sorry.
No.

1542
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,655
If I find her, we should all
hang out next week or something.

1543
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:42,782
Totally, yeah.

1544
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:43,987
Yeah, great.
You have great breasts. Thanks.

1545
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,287
Thank you.
Later, Noah.

1546
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,626
What are you doing?
Fuck you.

1547
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,206
Why are you such
an asshole, Rodrigo?

1548
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,667
Ever since
you moved in with us,

1549
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,549
you've been so mean
to everybody!

1550
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,721
What's wrong with you?

1551
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,139
You want to know
what's wrong with me?

1552
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,012
This is my third family
in three years.

1553
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,559
When your papas
get tired with me,

1554
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,056
they give me to
another families.

1555
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,433
That happens every time.

1556
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,516
Well, maybe if you didn't do
such messed-up stuff

1557
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,853
then they would actually feel
like you wanted to be here.

1558
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,608
You don't know me.
You look at me

1559
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,280
like a crazy that live
in your house.

1560
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,859
That's not true.
You never talk to us.

1561
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,161

you're pretty scary, man.

Marisa anywhere. Let's go.

1565

1566
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,301
Blithe, get down from there.
We have to go.

1567
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,471
These are my friends!
Come on, we're having fun.

1568
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,762
No. They're not your friends.

1569
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,681
They're drunk and they're
making fun of you, okay?

1570

You need to get down here right now.
What are you doing?

1571
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:49,269
Listen, they're drunk.
Let's go.

1572
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,470
Come up here!

1573
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,679
They just want
to dance with me!

1574
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:52,810
They don't want to dance...

1575
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,687
Oh! You're here!

1576
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:57,770
Where have you been?
This has been the best night ever.

1577
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,526
Are those kids?
Yeah. They're with me.

1578

I'll explain.
We need to get out of here right now.

1579

Did you get the party favors?

1580
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,743
I had them and now I don't.
I'll explain.

We need to get out
of here right now.

I'm serious.
It's Ricky.

1583
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:10,748
We don't have time for this.

1584
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,622
That is Ricky Fontaine.
He is my ex-boyfriend.

1585
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,327
I obviously have to go say hi.

1586
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,583

1587
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:16,754
NOAH: You're drunk, Marisa.

1588
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,415
Hey.

1589
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:19,670
Marisa.

1590
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,046
What's up? How are you?

1591
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:24,255
You haven't responded to any of my
texts in, like, a really long time.

1592
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,339
Yeah. There's a reason
for that.

1593
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:30,348
Marisa, I'm sorry.
I don't know how else I can say it.

1594
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:33,180
We had a great run,
but it's over now,

1595
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,607
and I wish you the best
and I pray for you, I do.

1596

Is everything okay?

1597
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:41,279
Actually, no.
Ricky's being kind of a dick.

1598
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,446
Why don't you defend me, Noah?

1599

1600
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,574

a real dick!

I've been nothing but cool to you, man.

1603
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,156
Okay. She's drunk.

1604
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,913

1609
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:01,796
We're in a relationship, okay?

1610
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,923
Friendship relationship.

is a pretty big nightmare.

to say to somebody!

be your friend, Karl!

She and that guy
that I set her up with,

to have a nightcap.

Let me tell you, I think she
was having a really good time.

I need to take advice
from is you, sir.

Excuse me?

You're banging your assistant,
Debra, and you're going to stop.

1929

Do you understand me?

1930
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,844
I would be very careful
how you talk to me.

1931
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:01,422
You'd better be very careful
how you talk to me.

1932
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:04,224
Because I'm going to be at
home with nothing going on.

1933

And I'm going to have one eye
on my three friends up there

1934
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,606
and the other eye right on you.

1935
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,775
I just want you to get
your act together, Doc.

(SOFTLY) Fucking...

1937

One more thing.
Your wife's smoking hot.

1938
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,074
You need to get rid of Debra
and focus on tapping that ass.

1939
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:26,614
And there may be a scratch
or two on your minivan!

Hey.

How'd you find me?

1945
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:01,274
Oh, this little gizmo kept beeping,
so I followed it to find you.

1946
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:03,485
Which is a little creepy
now that I think about it.

1947

No.

1952
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,958

cool, eventually. She'll move on.
