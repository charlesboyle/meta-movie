1
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:57,755
It is an extremely common mistake,

2
00:01:57,756 --> 00:02:01,084
people think the writer's
imagination is always at work,

3
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,962
that he's constantly
inventing an endless supply

4
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,089
of incidents and episodes,

5
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,968
that he simply dreams up his
stories out of thin air.

6
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:12,854
In point of fact, the
opposite is true.

7
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:15,015
Once the public knows
you're a writer,

8
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,901
they bring the characters
and events to you

9
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:20,820
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look

10
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,448
and to carefully listen,

11
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,110
these stories will continue to...

12
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:28,946
Stop it. Stop it! Don't!
Don't do it!

13
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:38,671
Will continue to seek you
out over your lifetime.

14
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:42,126
To him who has often told
the tales of others,

15
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:44,002
many tales will be told.

16
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:45,929
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

17
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,349
The incidents that follow
were described to me

18
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,518
exactly as I present them here

19
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,013
and in a wholly unexpected way.

20
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:03,821
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

21
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:06,866
<i>while suffering from a mild
case of "Scribe's Fever,"</i>

22
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:10,821
<i>a form of neurasthenia common among
the intelligentsia of that time,</i>

23
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,872
<i>I decided to spend
the month of August</i>

24
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:16,994
<i>in the spa town of Nebelsbad
below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,</i>

25
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:20,630
<i>and had taken up rooms
in the Grand Budapest,</i>

26
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:25,677
<i>a picturesque, elaborate, and once
widely celebrated establishment.</i>

27
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:28,505
<i>I expect some of you will know it.</i>

28
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,393
<i>It was off season and, by that
time, decidedly out of fashion,</i>

29
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:35,561
<i>and it had already
begun its descent</i>

30
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:39,732
<i>into shabbiness and
eventual demolition.</i>

31
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,685
<i>What few guests we were</i>

32
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:44,146
<i>had quickly come to recognize
one another by sight</i>

33
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:48,575
<i>as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment,</i>

34
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:51,744
<i>although I do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded</i>

35
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,706
<i>beyond the polite nods we
exchanged as we passed</i>

36
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:55,873
<i>in the Palm Court,</i>

37
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,917
<i>in the Arabian baths,</i>

38
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,420
<i>and onboard the
Colonnade Funicular.</i>

39
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:03,464
<i>We were a very reserved
group, it seemed,</i>

40
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:06,043
<i>and, without exception, solitary.</i>

41
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:13,133
<i>Perhaps as a result of
this general silence,</i>

42
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:16,136
<i>I had established a casual
and bantering familiarity</i>

43
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,479
<i>with the hotel's concierge,
a West-continental</i>

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,648
<i>known only as </i>Monsieur <i>Jean,</i>

45
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:25,938
<i>who struck one as being, at once, both
lazy and, really, quite accommodating.</i>

46
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:28,448
<i>I expect he was not well paid.</i>

47
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,949
<i>In any case, one evening,</i>

48
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,702
<i>as I stood conferring
elbow-to-elbow with </i>Monsieur <i>Jean,</i>

49
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:37,157
<i>as had become my habit, I noticed
a new presence in our company.</i>

50
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,792
<i>A small, elderly man,
smartly dressed,</i>

51
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:42,913
<i>with an exceptionally
lively, intelligent face</i>

52
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:46,125
<i>and an immediately
perceptible air of sadness.</i>

53
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,761
<i>He was, like the rest of us,
alone, but also, I must say,</i>

54
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:54,557
<i>he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely.</i>

55
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:57,477
<i>A symptom of my own medical
condition as well.</i>

56
00:04:57,478 --> 00:04:59,520
Who's this interesting old fellow?

57
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:01,181
<i>I inquired of </i>Monsieur <i>Jean.</i>

58
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,025
<i>To my surprise, he was
distinctly taken aback.</i>

59
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,610
- Don't you know?<i>
- He asked.</i>

60
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:07,570
Don't you recognize him?

61
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,030
<i>He did look familiar.</i>

62
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:12,985
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.
He arrived earlier this morning.

63
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:15,453
<i>This name will no doubt be familiar</i>

64
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:18,240
<i>to the more seasoned
persons among you.</i>

65
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,997
<i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time
the richest man in Zubrowka,</i>

66
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:30,085
<i>and was still indeed the
owner of the Grand Budapest.</i>

67
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:33,554
He often comes and
stays a week or more,

68
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:35,841
three times a year at least,
but never in the season.

69
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,302
Monsieur <i>Jean signaled to
me and I leaned closer.</i>

70
00:05:38,477 --> 00:05:39,686
I'll tell you a secret.

71
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:42,105
He takes only a single-bed
sleeping room without a bath

72
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:44,065
in the rear corner of the top floor

73
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:46,185
and it's smaller than
the service elevator!

74
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:47,853
<i>It was well known,</i>

75
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:50,613
<i>Zero Moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited</i>

76
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:53,734
<i>some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent.</i>

77
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:57,120
<i>Yet here, in his own
nearly empty hotel,</i>

78
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:00,073
<i>he occupied a servant's quarters?</i>

79
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:03,285
<i>At that moment, the curtain rose on
a parenthetical, domestic drama...</i>

80
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,752
Shit.

81
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:07,839
<i>which required the immediate
and complete attention</i>

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,042
<i>of </i>Monsieur <i>Jean,</i>

83
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:14,171
<i>but, frankly, did not
hold mine for long.</i>

84
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:22,604
<i>However,</i>

85
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:25,325
<i>this premature intermission in the
story of the curious, old man</i>

86
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:27,942
<i>had left me,
as the expression goes,</i>

87
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:30,229
"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,"

88
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:32,822
<i>that is, on the edge of my seat,</i>

89
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:35,909
<i>where I remained throughout
the next morning, until,</i>

90
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,871
<i>in what I have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,</i>

91
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:43,992
<i>fate, once again,
intervened on my behalf.</i>

92
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,915
I admire your work.

93
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:54,628
I beg your pardon?

94
00:06:56,013 --> 00:07:00,300
I said, I know and admire
your wonderful work.

95
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:03,102
Thank you most kindly, sir.

96
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,605
Did <i>Monsieur </i>Jean have a word
or two to share with you

97
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:09,393
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment?

98
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:14,113
I must confess, I did
myself inquire about you.

99
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:16,950
He's perfectly capable,
of course,<i> Monsieur </i>Jean

100
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,910
but we can't claim he's a first,

101
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,704
or, in earnest, even
second-rate concierge.

102
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:23,115
But there it is.

103
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:25,868
Times have changed.

104
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:32,006
The thermal baths
are very beautiful.

105
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:35,593
They were in their first condition.
It couldn't be maintained, of course.

106
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:37,379
Too decadent for current tastes.

107
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:42,301
But I love it all just the same,
this enchanting old ruin.

108
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,979
How did you come to
buy it, if I may ask?

109
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,182
The Grand Budapest.

110
00:07:57,783 --> 00:07:58,984
I didn't.

111
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,370
If you're not merely being polite,

112
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:13,256
and you must tell me
if that's the case,

113
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:16,460
but if it genuinely
does interest you,

114
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:19,087
may I invite you to
dine with me tonight,

115
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:23,057
and it will be my pleasure and,
indeed, my privilege to tell you

116
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:26,804
"my story." Such as it is.

117
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,903
Two ducks roasted with olives.

118
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,397
Rabbit, salad?

119
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:40,359
Pouilly-Jouvet '52, plus
a split of the brut.

120
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:44,787
That should provide us ample time

121
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:47,241
- if I commence promptly.
- By all means.

122
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:12,516
Well, it begins, as it must, with
our mutual friend's predecessor.

123
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:16,061
The beloved, original concierge
of The Grand Budapest.

124
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:19,440
It begins, of course, with...

125
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:43,972
- Bring the table to the window.
- Yes, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

126
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:46,613
- Bring the tray to the table.
- Right away, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

127
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:49,143
Right there. Have those
been brushed and blocked?

128
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:51,062
- Of course, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.
- Pack them in the hat boxes.

129
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:53,356
- Is that from Oberstdorf & Company?
- I believe so, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

130
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:55,275
- Second trunk. Who has the tickets?
- I do, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

131
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:57,478
Give them to me.

132
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,814
These are in order.
Wait in the corner.

133
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:11,249
- I'm not leaving.
- I beg your pardon?

134
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,452
- I'm not leaving.
- Why not?

135
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,579
- I'm frightened.
- Of what?

136
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:18,006
I fear this may be the last
time we ever see each other.

137
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:19,799
Why on earth would
that be the case?

138
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,135
Well, I can't put it into
words, but I feel it.

139
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:24,929
For goodness sake, there's no reason
for you to leave us if you'd...

140
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,141
- Come with me.
- To fucking Lutz?

141
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:30,427
- Please.
- Give me your hand.

142
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:35,356
You've nothing to fear. You're
always anxious before you travel.

143
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:38,359
I admit, you appear to be suffering a
more acute attack on this occasion.

144
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,404
But, truly and honestly... Oh, dear God.
What have you done to your fingernails?

145
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:43,364
- I beg your pardon?
- This diabolical varnish.

146
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:45,408
- The color is completely wrong.
- Don't you like it?

147
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:48,529
It's not that I don't like it.
I am physically repulsed.

148
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,957
- Perhaps this will soothe you.
- What? Don't recite.

149
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,410
- Just listen to the words. Hush.
- Please. Not now.

150
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:59,422
"While questing once in noble
wood of gray, medieval pine,

151
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:03,927
"I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd,
rubbed-cool, ethereal,

152
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,921
"'its inscription long-vanished,

153
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,465
"yet still within its
melancholy fissures..."

154
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,135
Will you light a
candle for me, please?

155
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:16,056
- In the sacristy of Santa Maria?
- I'll see to it myself immediately.

156
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,185
Remember, I'm always with you.

157
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:23,939
- I love you.
- I love you.

158
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:37,961
It's quite a thing winning the
loyalty of a woman like that

159
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:40,164
for 19 consecutive seasons.

160
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:44,217
- Yes, sir.
- She's very fond of me, you know.

161
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:45,385
Yes, sir.

162
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:47,470
But I've never seen
her like that before.

163
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:48,672
No, sir.

164
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:51,258
She was shaking like
a shitting dog.

165
00:11:52,393 --> 00:11:53,594
Truly.

166
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,229
Run to the cathedral of Santa
Maria in Brucknerplatz.

167
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,064
Buy one of the plain,
half-length candles

168
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,745
and take back four
Klubecks in change.

169
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,737
Light it in the sacristy,
say a brief rosary

170
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,070
then go to Mendl's and get
me a <i>courtesan au chocolat.</i>

171
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:06,871
If there's any money left, give it
to the crippled shoe-shine boy.

172
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,652
- Right away, sir.
- Hold it.

173
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,575
- Who are you?
- I'm Zero, sir. The new Lobby Boy.

174
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,001
- Zero, you say?
- Yes, sir.

175
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:20,503
I've never heard of you, never
laid eyes on you. Who hired you?

176
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,248
- Mr. Mosher, sir.
- Mr. Mosher!

177
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,508
Yes, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave?

178
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,261
Am I to understand you've
surreptitiously hired this young man

179
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:29,713
in the position of a Lobby Boy?

180
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:33,509
He's been engaged for a trial period,
pending your approval, of course.

181
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:37,353
Perhaps, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Mosher.

182
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:40,015
You're most welcome,
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

183
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:42,726
You're now going to be
officially interviewed.

184
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,187
Should I go and light
the candle first, sir?

185
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:46,605
What? No.

186
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,367
Experience?

187
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,654
Hotel Kinski, Kitchen
Boy, six months.

188
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:56,164
Hotel Berlitz, Mop and
Broom Boy, three months.

189
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:59,042
- Before that I was a Skillet Scrubber...
- Experience, zero.

190
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,210
- Thank you again, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.
- Straighten that cap, Anatole.

191
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,171
- The pleasure's mine, <i>Herr </i>Schneider.
- The strap's busted.

192
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:05,131
- These are not acceptable.
- I fully agree.

193
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:08,051
- Education?
- I studied reading and spelling.

194
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:10,428
I started my primary school.
I almost...

195
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,756
- Education, zero.
- Now it's exploded.

196
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,058
Good morning, Cicero.
Call the goddamn plumber!

197
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,435
- This afternoon, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave?
- Without fail, <i>Frau </i>Liebling.

198
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,228
- What in hell is this?
- Not now.

199
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:21,431
Family?

200
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,644
Zero.

201
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:28,021
Six, Igor.

202
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,239
Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy?

203
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:43,586
Well, who wouldn't, at
the Grand Budapest, sir?

204
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:45,789
It's an institution.

205
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,335
Very good.

206
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:07,728
- A thousand Klubecks.
- My goodness.

207
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:11,732
Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir?

208
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,116
What do you think?

209
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:15,201
Well, I suppose you'd have
to start somewhere...

210
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:17,203
- Go and light the goddamn candle.
- Yes, sir.

211
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,328
<i>And so, my life began.</i>

212
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:28,381
<i>Junior Lobby Boy in-training,</i>

213
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,091
<i>Grand Budapest Hotel,</i>

214
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:33,386
<i>under the strict command
of </i>Monsieur <i>Gustave H.</i>

215
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:36,639
<i>I became his pupil, and he was
to be my counselor and guardian.</i>

216
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,592
<i>What is a Lobby Boy?</i>

217
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:42,304
<i>A Lobby Boy's completely
invisible, yet always in sight.</i>

218
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:44,480
<i>A Lobby Boy remembers
what people hate.</i>

219
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,482
<i>A Lobby Boy anticipates
the client's needs</i>

220
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,769
<i>before the needs are needed.</i>

221
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:52,155
<i>A Lobby Boy is, above
all, discreet to a fault.</i>

222
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:54,282
Our guests know their
deepest secrets,

223
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:55,992
some of which are,
frankly, rather unseemly,

224
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:57,861
will go with us to our graves.

225
00:14:58,037 --> 00:15:00,739
- So keep your mouth shut, Zero.
- Yes, sir.

226
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,827
That's all for now.

227
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,086
<i>I began to realize that
many of the hotel's</i>

228
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:10,874
<i>most valued and distinguished
guests came for him.</i>

229
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:14,128
<i>It seemed to be an essential
part of his duties,</i>

230
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:16,547
<i>but I believe it was
also his pleasure.</i>

231
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,516
<i>The requirements were
always the same.</i>

232
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:23,269
<i>They had to be rich,</i>

233
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,520
<i>old,</i>

234
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:25,848
<i>insecure,</i>

235
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:27,190
<i>vain,</i>

236
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,566
<i>superficial,</i>

237
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:29,852
<i>blonde,</i>

238
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:31,645
<i>needy.</i>

239
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:34,773
Why blonde?

240
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,318
Because they all were.

241
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:39,820
<i>He was, by the way,</i>

242
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:43,581
<i>the most liberally perfumed
man I had ever encountered.</i>

243
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:46,660
<i>The scent announced his
approach from a great distance</i>

244
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:50,831
<i>and lingered for many
minutes after he was gone.</i>

245
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,551
<i>I worked six days each week
plus a half-day Sunday,</i>

246
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:57,963
<i>5:00 AM until just after midnight.</i>

247
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,717
<i>Our meals were small but
frequent, for stamina.</i>

248
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,761
<i>Two breakfasts, two lunches
and a late supper.</i>

249
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:09,232
Monsieur <i>Gustave also
delivered a nightly sermon.</i>

250
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:12,485
Rudeness is merely the
expression of fear.

251
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:14,855
People fear they won't
get what they want.

252
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,575
The most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved,

253
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:21,286
and they will open
up like a flower.

254
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:22,946
I am reminded of a verse,

255
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:25,623
"The painter's brush
touched the inchoate face

256
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:27,750
"by ends of nimble bristles

257
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:31,872
"and with their blush of first color,
rendered her lifeless cheek living."

258
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:35,292
<i>His own dinner, he took
alone in his room.</i>

259
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,559
<i>The identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us.</i>

260
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,563
<i>Each month, his emissary, known
as Deputy Kovacs, arrived</i>

261
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:50,607
<i>to review the books
and convey messages</i>

262
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:53,359
<i>on behalf of the
mysterious proprietor.</i>

263
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,487
<i>On these occasions, </i>Monsieur
<i>Gustave and our business manager,</i>

264
00:16:56,488 --> 00:17:01,318
Herr <i>Becker, met with him in private
consultation above Reception.</i>

265
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:15,541
<i>This was also when I met Agatha,</i>

266
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:35,686
<i>but we won't discuss that.</i>

267
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:27,652
- What do you want?
- Look.

268
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:33,827
Dear God.

269
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:35,378
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

270
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,547
- We must go to her.
- We must?

271
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:41,376
<i>Tout de suite. </i>She needs me, and I need
you to help me with my bags and so on.

272
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:44,887
- How fast can you pack?
- Five minutes.

273
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,931
Do it. And bring a bottle
of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26

274
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:48,349
in an ice bucket with two glasses

275
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,512
so we don't have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car.

276
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:02,648
I blame myself.

277
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:06,659
She tried to tell me she had
a premonition. I didn't listen.

278
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,411
All of Lutz will be
dressed in black,

279
00:19:08,412 --> 00:19:10,496
except her own ghastly,
deceitful children

280
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:12,790
whom she loathed and
couldn't bear to kiss hello.

281
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,410
They'll be dancing like gypsies.

282
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:20,381
There's really no point in
doing anything in life,

283
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,383
because it's all over in
the blink of an eye...

284
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:25,511
And, the next thing you
know, rigor mortis sets in.

285
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:28,556
Oh, how the good die young.

286
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:31,643
With any luck, she's left a few
Klubecks for your old friend,

287
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:35,097
but one never knows until the ink
is dry on the death certificate.

288
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:38,559
She was dynamite in
the sack, by the way.

289
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,820
She was 84, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

290
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:44,530
I've had older.

291
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,407
When you're young,
it's all fillet steak,

292
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:49,535
but as the years go by, you have
to move on to the cheaper cuts,

293
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,955
which is fine with me,
because I like those.

294
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,575
More flavorful, or so they say.

295
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,872
Why are we stopping
at a barley field?

296
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:16,805
Well, hello there, chaps.

297
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:18,481
Documents, please.

298
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,684
With pleasure.

299
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,614
It's not a very flattering
portrait, I'm afraid.

300
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:28,525
I was once considered
a great beauty.

301
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:32,029
What does the "F" stand for?
Fritz? Franz?

302
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:34,907
- Franz.
- I knew it!

303
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,118
He's making a funny face.

304
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:41,879
That's a Migratory Visa with Stage
Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.

305
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,166
He's with me.

306
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,084
Come outside, please.

307
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:50,597
Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.
His papers are in order.

308
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:53,766
I cross-referenced them myself with
the Bureau of Labor and Servitude.

309
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,727
You can't arrest him simply
because he's a bloody immigrant.

310
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:58,055
He hasn't done anything wrong.

311
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,687
Stop it, damn you!

312
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,906
Never mind, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave!
Let them proceed!

313
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:09,817
Ow! That hurts!

314
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:15,496
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

315
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,950
Take your hands off my Lobby Boy!

316
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:31,054
What's the problem?

317
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:32,388
This is outrageous.

318
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:35,270
The young man works for me at the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.

319
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:38,595
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave?

320
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:43,267
My name is Henckels.

321
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:47,771
I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs. Wolfgang
Henckels-Bergersdofer.

322
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,731
Do you remember me?

323
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:54,278
I know exactly who you are.
It's uncanny. You're little Albert.

324
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,280
I'm terribly embarrassed.
Release them.

325
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:59,241
Release them.

326
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:07,332
Your colleague is stateless.

327
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:09,842
He'll need to apply for a
revised Special Transit Permit,

328
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:13,297
which at this point may be
very difficult to acquire.

329
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,631
Take this.

330
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:18,935
It's temporary but it's the
best I can offer, I'm afraid.

331
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:21,263
And how's your wonderful mother?

332
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,439
- She's very well, thank you.
- I adore her.

333
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,893
- Send my love.
- I will.

334
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,689
Your companion was very kind to me
when I was a lonely little boy.

335
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:34,067
My men and I apologize
for disturbing you.

336
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,278
I beg your pardon, sir.

337
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:55,888
You see? There are still faint
glimmers of civilization

338
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:59,843
left in this barbaric slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity.

339
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:04,264
Indeed, that's what we provide in our
own modest, humble, insignificant...

340
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:07,851
Oh, fuck it.

341
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,969
Where is she, Clotilde?
Take me to her.

342
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:19,423
You're looking so well, darling.
You really are.

343
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:21,049
They've done a marvelous job.

344
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,726
I don't know what sort of cream they've
put on you down at the morgue,

345
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:25,144
but I want some.

346
00:24:25,145 --> 00:24:27,689
Honestly, you look better
than you have in years.

347
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,892
You look like you're alive.

348
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:39,284
Oh, you changed it after all.
It's perfect.

349
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:41,244
- Clotilde?<i>
- Oui, Monsieur </i>Gustave?

350
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:43,489
A glass of chilled water
with no ice, please.

351
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:52,456
All right, then.

352
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:54,833
I shan't be long, darling.

353
00:24:55,843 --> 00:24:58,011
<i>We were escorted through
a green baize door,</i>

354
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:01,507
<i>down a narrow service corridor
and into the butler's pantry.</i>

355
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:06,512
<i>A moment later, the kitchen
passage swung open</i>

356
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:10,057
<i>and a small servant dressed in
white jolted into the room.</i>

357
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,185
<i>I've never forgotten the
look on that man's face.</i>

358
00:25:13,861 --> 00:25:16,063
What the devil is going on?

359
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:20,359
<i>I, myself, had never set foot inside
a house of this kind in my life.</i>

360
00:25:21,702 --> 00:25:24,287
<i>I understood very little about
the events that were to follow.</i>

361
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:27,449
<i>But, eventually,
I came to recognize,</i>

362
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:31,210
<i>when the destiny of a great
fortune is at stake,</i>

363
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:35,332
<i>men's greed spreads like a
poison in the bloodstream.</i>

364
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,762
<i>Uncles, nephews, cousins,</i>

365
00:25:40,763 --> 00:25:43,465
<i>in-laws of increasingly
tenuous connection.</i>

366
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:45,224
<i>The old woman's most
distant relations</i>

367
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:47,511
<i>had come foraging out
of the woodwork.</i>

368
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:53,316
<i>At the head of this congregation,
it was a disorienting coincidence,</i>

369
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:56,270
<i>we discovered our
own Deputy Kovacs,</i>

370
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:59,231
<i>himself an important
attorney, of course.</i>

371
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,901
<i>He was the executor of
the dead widow's estate.</i>

372
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,578
This is Madame D's last
will and testament.

373
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:15,922
It consists of a general tontine

374
00:26:15,923 --> 00:26:20,043
drawn up before the event of her
husband's death 46 years ago,

375
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:23,346
in combination with 635 amendments,

376
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:26,266
notations, corrections,
and letters of wishes

377
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:29,553
executed during the
subsequent decades.

378
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,570
The ultimate legality
of this accumulation

379
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:34,941
requires further analysis,

380
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:38,187
but in the opinion of this office,
it was Madame D's intention

381
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:40,238
that control of the
vast bulk of her estate

382
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:43,116
should be transferred,
forthwith, to her son, Dmitri,

383
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:45,994
with special allowances
for his sisters,

384
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:48,530
Marguerite, Laetizia, and Carolina,

385
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,874
and minor gifts for various
members of the extended family

386
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:55,496
as shown in the List of Recipients,
which I will elucidate in due course.

387
00:26:57,756 --> 00:26:59,041
However.

388
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:03,845
An additional codicil,

389
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:07,265
delivered into my possession
by post only this morning,

390
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:09,968
and, by all indications,
sent by Madame D

391
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:11,352
during the last hours of her life,

392
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:14,139
contains an amendment to
the original certificate,

393
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:18,276
which, as prescribed by law,
I will read to you now.

394
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:19,736
The authenticity of this document

395
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:21,863
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate,

396
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:26,159
so I ask that all parties be
patient and refrain from comment

397
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,613
until such time as our
investigations can be completed.

398
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:41,883
"To my esteemed friend who
comforted me in my later years

399
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:44,336
"and brought sunshine into
the life of an old woman

400
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:47,305
"who thought that she would
never be happy again.

401
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:49,424
<i>"Monsieur </i>Gustave H,

402
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:53,436

00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:56,515
"and with full and absolute
fiduciary entitlement,

404
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:59,192
"the painting known as
<i>'Boy with Apple...'"</i>

405
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:01,145
- Wow!
- "...by Johannes van Hoytl..."

406
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:02,779
- I can't believe it.
- "...the younger..."

407
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,198
- What?
- "which gave us both so much pleasure."

408
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,241
The van Hoytl?

409
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:07,602
- Tax-free?
- Can she do that?

410
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:09,945
Who's Gustave H?

411
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:12,656
I'm afraid that's me, darling.

412
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:17,335
That fucking faggot!

413
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:20,046
He's a concierge. What
are you doing here?

414
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:23,216
I've come to pay my respects
to a great woman whom I loved.

415
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:26,511
- This man is an intruder in my home!
- It's not yours yet, Dmitri.

416
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:29,055
Only when probate is granted,
and the Deed of Entitlement...

417
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,616
You're not getting <i>Boy with
Apple,</i> you goddamn little fruit!

418
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,353
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

419
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:37,598
Call the police.
We're pressing charges.

420
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:40,942
This criminal has plagued my
family for nearly 20 years.

421
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:42,986
He's a ruthless adventurer
and a con-artist

422
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,238
who preys on mentally
feeble, sick old ladies,

423
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:47,490
and he probably fucks them, too!

424
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,985
I go to bed with all my friends.

425
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:01,379
Where's Celine?

426
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,209
What? She's dead.
We're reading her will.

427
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:07,552
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

428
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:10,631
If I learn you ever once laid
a finger on my mother's body,

429
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:14,259
living or dead, I swear to God,
I'll cut your throat! You hear me?

430
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:16,553
I thought I was supposed
to be a fucking faggot.

431
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:20,273
- You are, but you're bisexual.
- Let's change the subject.

432
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:21,517
I'm leaving.

433
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:33,737
That picture, <i>Boy with Apple,</i>
is priceless. Understand?

434
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:35,496
Congratulations, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave!

435
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,457
They're going to fight me
for the son of a bitch.

436
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:40,043
- Is it very beautiful?
- Beyond description.

437
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,545
"E'en the most gifted
bard's rhyme can only sing

438
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:44,790
"but to the lack of her
and all she isn't!

439
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:47,467
- "His tongue doth..."
- Can I see it?

440
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:49,670
I don't see why not.

441
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:23,704
This is van Hoytl's
exquisite portrayal

442
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:26,214
of a beautiful boy on
the cusp of manhood.

443
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:29,092
Blond, smooth.
Skin as white as that milk.

444
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,544
Of impeccable provenance.

445
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:34,339
One of the last in private hands,
and unquestionably, the best.

446
00:30:34,348 --> 00:30:35,799
It's a masterpiece.

447
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:38,177
The rest of this shit
is worthless junk.

448
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:59,633
What did you want
to tell me, before?

449
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:02,886
I think I cannot say right now.

450
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:05,514
Write me tomorrow.
Lutzbahn Station!

451
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:19,452
I'll never part with it.

452
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:23,949
It reminded her of me.
It will remind me of her. Always.

453
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,910
I'll die with this
picture above my bed.

454
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:29,246
See the resemblance?

455
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:32,249
Oh, yes.

456
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,298
Actually, we should sell it.

457
00:32:39,306 --> 00:32:42,475
Sooner rather than later, in
case they try to steal it back.

458
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:45,429
Plus, something about those lunatic
foot-soldiers on the express...

459
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:48,932
This could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade.

460
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:51,685
For all we know, they could
board us up tomorrow.

461
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:59,943
Let's make a solemn blood-pact.

462
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,537
We'll contact the black market
and liquidate <i>Boy with Apple</i>

463
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:03,580
by the end of the week,

464
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,700
then leave the country and lay low
somewhere along the Maltese Riviera

465
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:09,495
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts.

466
00:33:09,503 --> 00:33:11,455
In exchange for your
help, your loyalty

467
00:33:11,463 --> 00:33:13,457
and your services as
my personal valet,

468
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:18,219
I pledge to you 1.5%
of the net sale price.

469
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,422
- 1.5?
- Plus room and board.

470
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,343
- Could we make it 10?
- 10? Are you joking?

471
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,227
That's more than I'd
pay an actual dealer,

472
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:28,680
and you wouldn't know chiaroscuro
from chicken giblets.

473
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:30,607
No, 1.5 is correct. But
I'll tell you what,

474
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,936
if I die first, and I most certainly
will, you will be my sole heir.

475
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:37,072
There's not much in the kitty except
a set of ivory-backed hairbrushes

476
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:38,573
and my library of romantic poetry,

477
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:41,409
but when the time comes,
these will be yours,

478
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,787
along with whatever we haven't
already spent on whores and whiskey.

479
00:33:44,788 --> 00:33:47,665
This is our sacred bond.

480
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,868
I'll draw it up right now.

481
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:58,919
I, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave H, being of
relatively sound mind and body,

482
00:33:59,094 --> 00:34:02,965
on this day, the 19th of October,
in the year of our Lord 1932...

483
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,009
<i>He never told me where he came from.</i>

484
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:11,807
<i>I never asked who his
family had been.</i>

485
00:34:32,544 --> 00:34:34,746
Excuse me.

486
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:36,498
Uh-huh?

487
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:40,919
The police are here.
They asked for you.

488
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,842
Tell them I'll be right down.

489
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:49,678
Okay.

490
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,812
Have you ever been questioned
by the authorities?

491
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:59,737
Yes, on one occasion I was arrested
and tortured by the rebel militia

492
00:34:59,738 --> 00:35:00,981
after the Desert Uprising.

493
00:35:01,156 --> 00:35:03,236
- You know the drill, then. Zip it.
- Of course.

494
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:06,820
You've never heard the word "van
Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go.

495
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:23,837
How may we serve you, gentlemen?

496
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:26,347
Ah, Inspector Henckels.

497
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:28,967
"By order of the Commissioner
of Police, Zubrowka Province,

498

00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:36,900
I knew there was something fishy.
We never got the cause of death.

501
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:40,437
She's been murdered and
you think I did it.

502
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,982
Hey!

503
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:47,861
Stop!

504
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,003
What happened?

505
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:41,714
What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit

506
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:44,634
out of a sniveling little
runt called Pinky Bandinski

507
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,594
who had the gall to
question my virility,

508
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:48,972
because if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls,

509
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,334
it's that, when you find
yourself in a place like this,

510
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,892
you must never be a candy-ass.

511
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:54,978
You've got to prove
yourself from Day One.

512
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,763
You've got to win their respect.

513
00:36:56,855 --> 00:37:00,142
You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.

514
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:05,488
He's, actually,
become a dear friend.

515
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,107
You'll meet him, I hope.

516
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:10,110
So. You've talked to Kovacs?

517
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:11,786
I saw him last night in secret.

518
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:14,268
He made me take an oath on a
Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.

519
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,749
- You're supposed to also.
- I'll do that later.

520
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,502
- He suspects you're innocent.
- Of course he does.

521
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,538
What's the charge?

522
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,800
In the small hours of the
evening of 19 October,

523
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:29,012
an individual well-known to the house
and staff, a <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave H,

524
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,473
did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence in Lutz

525
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:35,018
and entered by the
rear service alley,

526
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,678
alerting no one to his presence,

527
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,648
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants' passage,

528
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:43,067
to deliver himself into the
private chambers of Madame D.

529
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:45,862
There is no evidence to
indicate whether this visit

530
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,615
had been pre-arranged
with her or not.

531
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:53,703
The next morning Madame D was found
dead by strychnine poisoning.

532
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,955
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave was not
observed on the premises again

533
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:59,284
until, of course, 24 hours later.

534
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,206
The identity of his accusers is made
clear in this notarized deposition.

535
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:07,884
They include, essentially, all
members of the extended family,

536
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:12,805
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events

537
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:15,683
appears to have fled
the jurisdiction.

538
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,560
His whereabouts are
currently unknown,

539
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,264
but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.

540
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:22,724
Who is he?

541
00:38:26,612 --> 00:38:28,897
- Serge?
- I'm afraid so.

542
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,316
That little prick.

543
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,735
No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.

544
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,995
I've been dropped into
a nest of vipers.

545
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:37,197
You have an alibi?

546
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:39,666
Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westphalia.

547
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:42,543
I can't allow her name to get
mixed-up in all this monkey business.

548
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:46,547
- Your life may be at stake.
- I know, but the bitch legged it.

549
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:50,335
She's already onboard the <i>Queen
Nasstasja</i> halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.

550
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,173
Don't give up.

551
00:38:59,812 --> 00:39:01,638
<i>The details of the conspiracy,</i>

552
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,983
<i>now a matter of public record,</i>

553
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:08,270
<i>were, at that time, impossible
for us to apprehend.</i>

554
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:27,171
I'm looking for Serge X,

555
00:39:27,172 --> 00:39:30,250
a young man in the
service of my employer,

556
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:34,046
the family Desgoffe und
Taxis of Schloss Lutz.

557
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:37,174
- Yes, sir?
- You're his sister?

558
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,843
- Yes, sir.
- Seen him lately?

559
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,096
- No, sir.
- No, sir?

560
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,182
No, sir.

561
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:51,313
I need to find him right
away, for his own safety

562
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:53,107
and everybody else's.

563
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:55,992
If he shows up...

564
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,987
- Yes, sir?
- Tell him Jopling says,

565
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,406
"Come home."

566
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,161
<i>But one thing was certain,</i>

567
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,875
<i>the Desgoffe und Taxis were
a very powerful family,</i>

568
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:18,173
<i>and time was not on our side.</i>

569
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:29,017
A letter from
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave. Zero.

570
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,937
- You want me to?
- Read it.

571
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:39,744
"My dear and trusted colleagues..."

572
00:40:39,745 --> 00:40:41,955
I miss you deeply as I
write from the confines

573
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:45,124
of my regrettable and
preposterous incarceration.

574
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,411
Until I walk amongst you
again as a free man,

575
00:40:47,544 --> 00:40:50,038
the Grand Budapest
remains in your hands,

576
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,374
as does its impeccable reputation.

577
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:54,717
Keep it spotless and glorify it.

578
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,136
Take extra special care of
every little-bitty bit of it

579
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:59,423
as if I were watching
over you like a hawk

580
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:03,101
with a horse whip in its
talons, because I am.

581
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:06,346
Should I discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence,

582
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:10,191
I promise, swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you.

583
00:41:10,192 --> 00:41:14,354
A great and noble house has been
placed under your protection.

584
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,198
Tell Zero if you see
any funny business.

585
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,485
"Your devoted <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave."

586
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,036
Then there's a poem, but we
might want to start on the soup

587
00:41:22,037 --> 00:41:24,706
since it's 46 stanzas.

588
00:41:24,707 --> 00:41:28,494
"A moist, black ash dampens the
filth of a dung-dark rat's nest

589
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:30,920
"and mingles with the
thick scent of wood rot

590
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,922
"while the lark song
of a guttersnipe..."

591
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,300
I never trusted that butler.

592
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:39,178
- He's too honest.<i>
- Too honest, you say?</i>

593
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:43,842
<i>Right, well, be that as it may,
find him quick and make it snappy.</i>

594
00:41:59,867 --> 00:42:02,528
May I offer any of you
inmates a plate of mush?

595
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,490
No? Anyone?

596
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:09,076
You with the very large
scar on your face?

597
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:21,220
Try it. It's actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning.

598
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:22,464
It needs a dash of salt.

599
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,016
Good day.

600
00:42:37,696 --> 00:42:39,898
Mush, gents? Any takers?

601
00:42:43,786 --> 00:42:45,404
Suit yourselves.

602
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:52,619
Rise and shine. Chop, chop.

603
00:42:54,046 --> 00:42:55,414
Good morning, Pinky.

604
00:43:01,053 --> 00:43:03,888
- Mendl's again?
- Precisely.

605
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,091
Who's got the throat slitter?

606
00:43:11,397 --> 00:43:14,516
- Out of this world.
- Mendl's is the best.

607
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,977
- Well, back to work.<i>
- Monsieur </i>Gustave?

608
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:21,982
Yes?

609
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:28,030
Me and the boys talked it over.

610
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,616
We think you're a
really straight fellow.

611
00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:33,076
Well, I've never been
accused of that before,

612
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:35,211
but I appreciate the sentiment.

613
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:36,914
You're one of us now.

614
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:40,083
What a lovely thing to say.

615
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:42,135
Thank you, dear Pinky.
Thank you, Günther.

616
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:43,845
Thank you, Wolf.

617
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:46,048
Anything else?

618
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:48,967
Tell him, Ludwig.

619
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,105
Checkpoint 19 ain't
no two-bit hoosegow.

620
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:57,518
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

621
00:43:57,693 --> 00:44:01,321
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

622
00:44:01,322 --> 00:44:05,943
You got a 325-foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles.

623
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:08,077
But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,

624
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,038
which in this case
happens to take the form

625
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:12,290
of a storm-drain sewer system

626
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:14,910
dating from the time of the
original rock fortification

627
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:17,128
way back in the Middle Ages.

628
00:44:17,129 --> 00:44:20,340
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade

629
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:22,300
with a fine lady and
a white poodle,

630
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:26,179
but it's got what you'd
call "vulnerability,"

631
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,133
and that's our bread and butter.

632
00:44:29,808 --> 00:44:32,136
Take a look.

633
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,555
Who drew this?

634
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,981
What do you mean,
"Who drew this?" I did.

635
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:39,192
Very good. You've got a
wonderful line, Ludwig.

636
00:44:39,193 --> 00:44:41,110
This shows great artistic promise.

637
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,606
Question, how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment?

638
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,367
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

639
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:49,319
Digging with the throat-slitter,

640
00:44:49,328 --> 00:44:52,163
I expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort,

641
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:53,949
during which time
several of our members

642
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,458
will have been violently executed.

643
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,086
You hit the nail on the
head, Mr. Gustave.

644
00:44:58,087 --> 00:45:00,922
We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

645
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:03,383
a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunk-linens,

646
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:05,468
but we need digging tools,

647
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,630
which are proving hard to
come by in this flop-house.

648
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:24,529
<i>At this point in the story,</i>

649
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:28,366
<i>the old man fell silent and
pushed away his saddle of lamb.</i>

650
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:31,411
<i>His eyes went blank as two stones.</i>

651
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:33,614
<i>I could see he was in distress.</i>

652
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:36,374
- Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa?<i>
- I finally asked.</i>

653
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,994
- Oh, dear me, no.<i>
- He said.</i>

654
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:41,538
It's only that I don't
know how to proceed.

655
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,008
<i>He was crying.</i>

656
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:46,551
You see, I never speak of Agatha,

657
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:50,388
because even at the
thought of her name

658
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:53,383
I'm unable to control my emotions.

659
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,680
Well, I suppose there's
no way around it.

660
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:02,351
You see, she saved us.

661
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:04,444
<i>On our third formal rendezvous,</i>

662
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:07,439
<i>I had asked for her hand in
marriage and she had agreed.</i>

663
00:46:07,448 --> 00:46:09,650
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

664
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:14,370
<i>We did not have 50 Klubecks
between the two of us.</i>

665
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:17,783
<i>No one knew, of course, but,
then, who would have cared?</i>

666
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:20,702
<i>We were each completely
on our own in the world,</i>

667
00:46:21,837 --> 00:46:24,039
<i>and we were deeply in love.</i>

668
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:34,515
- Here.
- Thank you.

669
00:46:34,516 --> 00:46:36,559
- It's a book.
- I see.

670
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,311
<i>Romantic Poetry, Volume One.</i>

671
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:40,939
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave recommended it.
I have a copy of my own as well.

672
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,185
- I ruined the surprise, I suppose.
- I'll go ahead and open it, anyway.

673
00:46:48,364 --> 00:46:50,566
Read the inscription.

674
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:10,218
Monsieur <i>Gustave insisted</i>

675
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:12,595
<i>on an immediate and thorough
cross-examination...</i>

676
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,473
She's charming. She's so charming.

677
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:18,184
<i>during which he presented
Agatha with a porcelain pendant</i>

678
00:47:18,185 --> 00:47:21,305
<i>and five dozen individually
tissue-wrapped white tulips</i>

679
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:23,564
<i>in a box the size of
a child's coffin.</i>

680
00:47:23,565 --> 00:47:26,484
- It's not right.
- I beg your pardon?

681
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:27,811
Why is he sulking?

682
00:47:27,987 --> 00:47:30,071
She's my girlfriend.
You can't just buy her things.

683
00:47:30,072 --> 00:47:33,491
I'm only interviewing this vision
of loveliness on your behalf.

684
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:36,327
Never be jealous in this life,
Zero, not even for an instant.

685
00:47:36,328 --> 00:47:38,155
Is he flirting with you?

686
00:47:39,206 --> 00:47:42,493
- Yes.
- I approve of this union.

687
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:45,253
Agatha, my beauty,
return to your beloved.

688
00:47:45,254 --> 00:47:46,671
<i>Soon we learned...</i>

689
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:48,590
Blessings upon you both.

690
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:50,542
<i>not only was Agatha
immensely skilled</i>

691
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:53,303
<i>with a palette knife and a
butter-cream flourish...</i>

692
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,506
- Mendl.
- Go.

693
00:47:56,432 --> 00:47:58,634
<i>she was also very brave.</i>

694
00:48:03,022 --> 00:48:05,307
<i>I believe she was born that way.</i>

695
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,586
Something's missing.

696
00:48:26,587 --> 00:48:31,341
A crucial document, either misplaced
or, conceivably, destroyed.

697
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,022
I don't know what it contains,
I don't know what it represents,

698
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:35,587
I don't know what it is,

699
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:38,882
but there are traces and
shadows of it everywhere.

700
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,767
Now, I don't want to alarm you,

701
00:48:40,768 --> 00:48:42,685
and I don't expect to see
any significant change

702
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,889
in the magistrate's ultimate decision
vis-a-vis your own inheritance,

703
00:48:46,065 --> 00:48:49,893
but, especially given the
circumstances of the death,

704
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:54,614
as well as the disappearance of the key
witness in the murder case, Serge X,

705
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:56,491
I suggest that we immediately
bring this matter

706
00:48:56,492 --> 00:48:58,861
to the attention of the
municipal inspector

707
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,916
so that there can be
absolutely no question

708
00:49:00,996 --> 00:49:03,456
of impropriety at any future date.

709
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:05,451
- Agreed?
- Not agreed.

710
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:09,413
- Not agreed?
- Not agreed.

711
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:15,343
- Can I ask you a question, Vilmos?
- Yes, Dmitri?

712
00:49:15,344 --> 00:49:18,263
- Who are you working for?
- I beg your pardon?

713
00:49:18,264 --> 00:49:22,225
Who are you working for? I thought
you're supposed to be our lawyer.

714
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:25,687
Well, in point of fact, I'm
the executor of the estate.

715
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:29,975
In this particular situation,
I represent the deceased.

716
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,276
Oh, yeah?

717
00:49:31,277 --> 00:49:34,237
Yeah. A provision for my fees
was included in the...

718
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:39,276
Just wrap it up and don't
make waves. Agreed?

719
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:45,324
I'm an attorney. I'm obligated to
proceed according to the rule of law.

720
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,701
Not agreed.

721
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:56,418
This stinks, sisters.

722
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,840
Did he just throw my
cat out the window?

723
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:04,767
I don't think so.

724
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:05,969
- No. Did he?
- Jopling?

725
00:50:32,755 --> 00:50:34,957
Okay.

726
00:50:45,392 --> 00:50:48,387
There's something I
haven't told you, Agatha.

727
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:49,729
- Okay.
- We stole a painting.

728
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:52,523
It's very valuable, maybe five
million Klubecks, in fact.

729
00:50:52,524 --> 00:50:54,567
I don't know if anyone's even
noticed it's missing yet,

730
00:50:54,568 --> 00:50:56,402
but if something
should happen to me...

731
00:50:56,403 --> 00:50:58,021
You steal art?

732
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:02,283
One picture. Anyway, we need to
make a plan for your survival.

733
00:51:02,284 --> 00:51:05,286
Hide this. It's in code and you might
need a magnifying glass to read it,

734
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:07,664
but it tells you exactly where
and how to find <i>Boy with Apple.</i>

735
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:09,874
Don't take less than half the
retail asking price. Also...

736
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,794
- Zero, I'm a baker.
- You're a pastry chef.

737
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:14,879
I'm not a fence,
if that's the term.

738
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,999
I don't trade in stolen property.

739
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,377
I said it wrong.
She willed it to him.

740
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:31,555
Go to sleep.

741
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:33,974
Yes, <i>Herr </i>Mendl.

742
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:38,528
- Hide this.
- No.

743
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,731
Okay, but take it anyway.

744
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,906
<i>The next morning,</i> Herr
<i>Becker received a peculiar,</i>

745
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:12,860
<i>last-minute notice from the
office of Deputy Kovacs,</i>

746
00:55:12,868 --> 00:55:17,656
<i>postponing their scheduled
meeting, in perpetuity.</i>

747
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:49,730
Let's blow.

748
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:02,018
- How did you get out there?
- Shut the fuck up.

749
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,896
These guys are trying to escape.

750
00:57:04,897 --> 00:57:06,814
What's wrong with you,
you goddamn snitch?

751
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,017
Guard! Guard!

752
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:19,862
It's you. Thank you.
Thank you, you sweet, kind man.

753
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:51,727
Okay.

754
00:59:05,392 --> 00:59:08,303
I suppose you'd call that a draw.

755
00:59:17,196 --> 00:59:19,398
Good evening.

756
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:31,292
Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf,
Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.

757
00:59:31,293 --> 00:59:33,336
Günther was slain in the catacombs.

758
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:36,331
Well, boys, who knows when we'll
all meet again, but if one day...

759
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,583
Hold it.

760
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:43,088
No time to gab.

761
00:59:43,097 --> 00:59:45,591
Take care of yourself, Mr. Gustave.

762
00:59:45,724 --> 00:59:47,926
Good luck, kid.

763
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,399
- Which way to the safe house?
- I couldn't find one.

764
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,644
No safe house? Really? We're
completely on our own out here?

765
00:59:57,778 --> 01:00:01,106
I'm afraid so.
I asked around, but...

766
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:04,109
I understand. Too risky. We'll
just have to wing it, I suppose.

767
01:00:04,118 --> 01:00:06,612
Let's put on our disguises.

768
01:00:06,745 --> 01:00:09,038
- We're wearing them.
- No, we're not.

769
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,617
We said false whiskers and
fake noses and so on.

770
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,335
- You didn't bring any?
- I thought you were growing one.

771
01:00:14,336 --> 01:00:17,422
And it wouldn't look
realistic, would it?

772
01:00:17,423 --> 01:00:19,924
No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.

773
01:00:19,925 --> 01:00:22,051
But I take your point. So be it.

774
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:24,630
Give me a few squirts of L'air
de Panache, please, will you?

775
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:29,635
- Can I not get a squirt, even?
- I forgot the L'air de Panache.

776
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:32,437
Honestly, you forgot
the L'air de Panache?

777
01:00:32,438 --> 01:00:35,599
I don't believe it. How could you?

778
01:00:35,774 --> 01:00:38,902
I've been in jail, Zero! Do you
understand how humiliating this is?

779
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:41,105
I smell.

780
01:00:42,907 --> 01:00:45,025
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

781
01:00:45,034 --> 01:00:48,953
I suppose this is to be expected back
in... Where do you come from again?

782
01:00:48,954 --> 01:00:50,572
- Aq Salim al-Jabat.
- Precisely.

783
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,333
I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat

784
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:54,918
where one's prized possessions

785
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:56,961
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat,

786
01:00:56,962 --> 01:01:00,965
and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs.

787
01:01:00,966 --> 01:01:03,585
But it's not how I trained you.

788
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,345
What on God's earth
possessed you to leave

789
01:01:05,346 --> 01:01:06,930
the homeland where
you obviously belong

790
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:10,050
and travel unspeakable distances
to become a penniless immigrant

791
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:12,177
in a refined,
highly-cultivated society

792
01:01:12,186 --> 01:01:15,389
that, quite frankly, could've
gotten along very well without you?

793
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:17,307
The war.

794
01:01:18,234 --> 01:01:19,685
Say again?

795
01:01:19,818 --> 01:01:22,062
Well, you see, my
father was murdered

796
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:24,731
and the rest of my family were
executed by firing squad.

797
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:26,449
Our village was
burned to the ground

798
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,953
and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee.

799
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:32,030
I left because of the war.

800
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,577
I see. So you're, actually, really
more of a refugee, in that sense?

801
01:01:37,503 --> 01:01:38,704
Truly.

802
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:42,624
Well, I suppose I'd better take
back everything I just said.

803
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:47,087
What a bloody idiot I am.
Pathetic fool.

804
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:49,347
Goddamn, selfish bastard.

805
01:01:49,348 --> 01:01:52,593
This is disgraceful, and it's beneath
the standards of the Grand Budapest.

806
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:56,354
I apologize on behalf of the hotel.

807
01:01:56,355 --> 01:01:58,982
It's not your fault. You were
just upset I forgot the perfume.

808
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:03,152
Don't make excuses for me.
I owe you my life.

809
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:07,232
You are my dear friend and protégé
and I'm very proud of you.

810
01:02:07,241 --> 01:02:09,651
You must know that.

811
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:12,029
I'm so sorry, Zero.

812
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:15,491
We're brothers.

813
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:25,626
How's our darling Agatha?

814
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:31,389
"'Twas first light when I saw
her face upon the heath,

815
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:34,259
"and hence did I return,
day-by-day, entranced,

816
01:02:34,268 --> 01:02:37,312
"tho' vinegar did brine
my heart, never..."

817
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:40,189
Very good. I'm going to stop you
there because the alarm has sounded,

818
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:43,769
but remember where we left off
because I insist you finish later.

819
01:03:01,587 --> 01:03:04,547
I want roadblocks at
every junction for 50km.

820
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:07,501
I want rail blocks at every
train station for 100km.

821
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,553
I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds
ready in five minutes.

822
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:14,057
We're going to strip-search every
pretzel<i>-Haus, Waffel-</i>hut, <i>Biergarten</i>

823
01:03:14,058 --> 01:03:18,095
and especially every grand hotel
from Augenzburg to Zilchbrock.

824
01:03:18,145 --> 01:03:20,264
These men are dangerous,
professional criminals.

825
01:03:20,272 --> 01:03:22,482
At least three of them are anyway.

826
01:03:22,483 --> 01:03:23,684
Who are you?

827
01:03:26,028 --> 01:03:28,814
What are you doing here? Civilian personnel
aren't permitted in the cellblock.

828
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:32,075
- This is a military investigation.
- This is Mr. Jopling, sir.

829
01:03:32,076 --> 01:03:34,369
His employer's mother
was one of the victims...

830
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,822
Shut up.

831
01:03:37,623 --> 01:03:40,250
You work for the family
Desgoffe und Taxis?

832
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:44,379
Are you aware of the murder of Deputy
Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?

833
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:46,832
I'm aware of his disappearance.

834
01:03:47,049 --> 01:03:49,592
His body was found stuffed in a
sarcophagus behind a storage room

835
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:51,420
at the Kunstmuseum late last night.

836
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:54,264
<i>He was short four fingers.</i>

837
01:03:54,265 --> 01:03:57,217
- What do you know about that?
- Nothing.

838
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:00,721
Escort Mr. Jopling
off the premises.

839
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:13,317
Mendl's.

840
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:20,290
Operator, get me the Excelsior
Palace in Baden-Jurgen

841
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:21,909
and reverse the charges, please.

842
01:04:22,084 --> 01:04:24,127
We've no choice.
There's nowhere else to turn.

843
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:25,503
I'll hold. Thank you.

844
01:04:25,504 --> 01:04:28,423
It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't
even mention its existence to you.

845
01:04:28,424 --> 01:04:31,426
It goes without saying, never breathe
a word about this to a living soul.

846
01:04:31,427 --> 01:04:33,386
- Do you swear?
- Of course. What is it, in fact?

847
01:04:33,387 --> 01:04:34,671
I can't say.

848
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:39,218
How does one come by
front-row aisle seats

849
01:04:39,226 --> 01:04:42,562
for a first night at the Opera
Toscana with one day's notice?

850
01:04:42,563 --> 01:04:44,348
How does one arrange
a private viewing

851
01:04:44,356 --> 01:04:47,317
of the tapestry collection
at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

852
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:49,319
How does one secure a corner table

853
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,571
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?

854
01:04:51,572 --> 01:04:54,157
Ivan, darling, it's Gustave. Hello.

855
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:56,360
Well, I was until about
five minutes ago.

856
01:04:56,368 --> 01:04:59,579
We've taken it upon ourselves to clear
out in a hurry if you see what I mean.

857
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:02,332
Well, through a sewer,
as it happens. Exactly.

858
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:05,168
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to cut you
off, but we're in a bit of a bind.

859
01:05:05,169 --> 01:05:06,912
This is an official request.

860
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:10,374
I'm formally calling upon
the special services of...

861
01:05:15,387 --> 01:05:16,922
<i>I'll call you back, Gustave.</i>

862
01:05:17,139 --> 01:05:19,258
Right. Stand by.

863
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:22,560
I beg your pardon.
Do you prefer to walk?

864
01:05:22,561 --> 01:05:24,680
We're right here. It's very simple.

865
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:26,890
Straight down the
corniche, then left.

866
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:29,226
Jojo, see the gentleman out.

867
01:05:31,737 --> 01:05:34,398
Get me <i>Monsieur </i>Georges at
the Château Luxe, please.

868
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:39,535
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

869
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:40,620
Take over.

870
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:42,330
<i>Happy birthday, dear...</i>

871
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:43,699
<i>Hello, Ivan?</i>

872
01:05:45,626 --> 01:05:47,703
Got it.

873
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,706
Get me <i>Monsieur </i>Dino at the
Palazzo Principessa, please.

874
01:05:52,299 --> 01:05:54,835
Higher, goddammit, higher!

875
01:05:56,512 --> 01:05:58,388
Take over.

876
01:05:58,389 --> 01:06:00,223
- Monsieur <i>Georges.</i>
- Higher.

877
01:06:00,224 --> 01:06:02,551
I see. Straightaway.

878
01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:06,555
Get me <i>Monsieur </i>Robin at
l'Hotel Cote du Cap, please.

879
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,309
and two and three.

880
01:06:11,318 --> 01:06:14,362
<i>Monsieur </i>Robin. There's a call
from Monsieur Dino for you.

881
01:06:14,363 --> 01:06:16,565
Take over.

882
01:06:17,658 --> 01:06:20,618
- One, two, three.<i>
- Yes, Dino.</i>

883
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:24,239
Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.

884
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:28,535
Get me <i>Monsieur </i>Martin at
the Ritz Imperial, please.

885
01:06:30,129 --> 01:06:32,039
Too much salt.

886
01:06:32,131 --> 01:06:35,250
Not enough pepper.

887
01:06:35,259 --> 01:06:37,461
Take over.

888
01:06:39,305 --> 01:06:41,514
<i>- Robin? Martin.</i>
- Too much salt.

889
01:06:41,515 --> 01:06:43,717
So I've heard.

890
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:47,971
Maybe. Let me make a few calls.

891
01:06:52,818 --> 01:06:55,570
Serge X, missing.
Deputy Kovacs, also missing.

892
01:06:55,571 --> 01:06:58,573
Madame D, dead.<i> Boy with
Apple, </i>stolen, by us.

893
01:06:58,574 --> 01:07:01,326
Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless,
cold-blooded savages.

894
01:07:01,327 --> 01:07:04,662
Gustave H, at large. What else?

895
01:07:04,663 --> 01:07:07,582
- Zero, confused.
- Zero, confused, indeed.

896
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:09,910
The plot "thickens," as they say.

897
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:12,788
Why, by the way?
Is it a soup metaphor?

898
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,998
I don't know.

899
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:21,547
Get in.

900
01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:25,300
We found the butler.

901
01:07:25,309 --> 01:07:28,311
He's hiding out in the remote
foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.

902
01:07:28,312 --> 01:07:30,563
Our contact convinced him
to meet you midday tomorrow

903
01:07:30,564 --> 01:07:32,085
at the observatory on the summit.

904
01:07:32,191 --> 01:07:34,643
Tell no one.
He'll explain everything.

905
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:36,861
Your train departs in
four and a half minutes.

906
01:07:36,862 --> 01:07:38,571
Here's your tickets.

907
01:07:38,572 --> 01:07:40,941
- Third class?
- It was overbooked

908
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:44,744
but the conductor used to be a
sommelier at the old Versailles.

909
01:07:44,745 --> 01:07:46,071
He pulled some strings.

910
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:48,532
You'll need these
for the dining car.

911
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,412
One last thing.

912
01:07:54,755 --> 01:07:56,957
L'air de Panache.

913
01:07:59,385 --> 01:08:01,712
They only had the half-ounce.

914
01:08:05,724 --> 01:08:07,892
We should give him something
as a symbolic gesture.

915
01:08:07,893 --> 01:08:10,478
- How much money you got?
- 42 Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.

916
01:08:10,479 --> 01:08:12,681
Give me 25. Yes.

917
01:08:16,235 --> 01:08:19,354
- Bless you.
- Please.

918
01:08:35,921 --> 01:08:37,672
- I've got to hand it to him.<i>
- Jesus Christ.</i>

919
01:08:37,673 --> 01:08:41,676
I didn't see that coming.
Well, what do you want next?

920
01:08:41,677 --> 01:08:47,132
<i>Talk to the club-footed sister again,
and, this time, be persuasive.</i>

921
01:08:54,273 --> 01:08:57,101
Goddamn son of a bitch.

922
01:09:20,549 --> 01:09:22,751
Holy fuck!

923
01:09:26,805 --> 01:09:29,849
What's the meaning of this shit?

924
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:31,643
<i>Boy with Apple? </i>I thought
you'd hidden it.

925
01:09:31,644 --> 01:09:34,221
- Why are you only noticing now?
- I assumed it went to the tax appraiser.

926
01:09:34,396 --> 01:09:38,608
Are you fucking kidding me?

927
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:41,645
I believe it was removed
by <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

928
01:09:49,328 --> 01:09:50,612
I'm not angry with Serge.

929
01:09:50,621 --> 01:09:53,198
You can't blame someone for their
basic lack of moral fiber.

930
01:09:53,332 --> 01:09:55,492
He's a frightened, little,
yellow-bellied coward.

931
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:57,669
- It's not his fault, is it?
- I don't know. It depends.

932
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:59,379
Well, you can say that
about most anything.

933
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,880
"It depends." Of course it depends.

934
01:10:00,881 --> 01:10:02,674
Of course it depends.
Of course it depends.

935
01:10:02,675 --> 01:10:04,960
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Of course it depends.

936
01:10:04,969 --> 01:10:08,714
That doesn't mean I'm not going
to throttle the little swamp rat.

937
01:10:10,891 --> 01:10:15,512
May I officiate, by the way?
The ceremony?

938
01:10:15,521 --> 01:10:16,646
With pleasure.

939
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:19,524
I must say, I find that
girl utterly delightful.

940
01:10:19,525 --> 01:10:21,143
Flat as a board, enormous birthmark

941
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,103
the shape of Mexico
over half her face,

942
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,530
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen

943
01:10:25,531 --> 01:10:27,031
while Mendl, genius though he is,

944
01:10:27,032 --> 01:10:28,859
looms over her like
a hulking gorilla.

945
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:31,195
Yet without question, without fail,

946
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:34,664
always and invariably,
she's exceedingly lovely.

947
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:36,116
Why?

948
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:38,994
Because of her purity.

949
01:10:40,879 --> 01:10:43,290
She admires you as well,
<i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.

950
01:10:43,382 --> 01:10:46,168
- Does she?
- Very much.

951
01:10:46,385 --> 01:10:50,214
That's a good sign, you know.
It means she "gets it."

952
01:10:50,389 --> 01:10:52,591
That's important.

953
01:10:54,727 --> 01:10:56,929
Don't flirt with her.

954
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:46,110
A radio telegram was delivered and
signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.

955
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:49,064
The envelope was found near the body,
but its contents were missing.

956
01:11:49,657 --> 01:11:52,951
However, the telegraph office always keeps
a carbon of the ticker tape for 24 hours.

957
01:11:52,952 --> 01:11:55,320
I copied it down.
It reads as follows,

958
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:57,656
"Pack your things stop.

959
01:11:57,665 --> 01:11:59,874
"Be ready to leave at
moment's notice stop.

960
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:02,627
"Hide-out is vicinity of
Gabelmeister's Peak stop.

961
01:12:02,628 --> 01:12:05,164
"Destroy this message
all my love full stop."

962
01:12:06,006 --> 01:12:08,041
Where's the basket?

963
01:12:33,117 --> 01:12:35,319
Where you headed, mister?

964
01:12:38,872 --> 01:12:41,325
Skiing? Sledding?
Mountain climbing?

965
01:12:50,926 --> 01:12:53,086
Three Klubecks.

966
01:13:03,022 --> 01:13:05,015
<i>By express wireless, I wrote Agatha</i>

967
01:13:05,024 --> 01:13:07,942
<i>with instructions to move to
our pre-arranged hideout,</i>

968
01:13:07,943 --> 01:13:10,729
<i>a Gypsy caravan on the
outer Nebelsbad road,</i>

969
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:12,731
<i>while </i>Monsieur <i>Gustave
and I continued east</i>

970
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,233
<i>into the Zubrowkian Alps,</i>

971
01:13:14,241 --> 01:13:18,237
<i>toward our high-altitude rendezvous
with the butler Serge X.</i>

972
01:13:19,955 --> 01:13:22,407
<i>As a precaution, we
disembarked quietly</i>

973
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:25,119
<i>in the freight yard just
outside the station.</i>

974
01:13:32,593 --> 01:13:34,461
L'air de Panache.

975
01:13:44,939 --> 01:13:47,565
It's a hell of a view. I give
them that, for what's it's worth.

976
01:13:47,566 --> 01:13:49,768
I agree.

977
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:04,165
"'Tis oft'-remarked, no single,
falling-flake does any other

978
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:08,036
- "in its pure and perfect form..."
- Somebody's coming.

979
01:14:10,297 --> 01:14:13,758
Are you <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

980
01:14:13,759 --> 01:14:16,503
- Uh-huh.
- Get on the next cable car.

981
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:59,463
Are you <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

982
01:14:59,638 --> 01:15:01,924
- Uh-huh.
- Switch with me.

983
01:15:31,211 --> 01:15:34,164
Are you <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

984
01:15:34,173 --> 01:15:37,167
- Uh-huh.
- Put these on and sing.

985
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:07,830
- Are you <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave of the...
- Yes, dammit.

986
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:08,998
Confess.

987
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:11,000
I'm innocent.

988
01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:13,078
Hmm? No, no.

989
01:16:22,263 --> 01:16:25,139
Forgive me, <i>Monsieur </i>Gustave.
I never meant to betray you.

990
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:28,268
They threatened my life and now
they've murdered my only family.

991
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:30,103
No. Who did they kill this time?

992
01:16:30,104 --> 01:16:32,598
- My dear sister.
- The girl with the club foot?

993
01:16:32,773 --> 01:16:34,274
- Yes.
- Those fuckers!

994
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:35,942
I tried to warn you
at the beginning.

995
01:16:35,943 --> 01:16:37,443
I know, darling. Let's
put that behind us.

996
01:16:37,444 --> 01:16:40,863
Listen, I hate to put you on the spot, but
I really must ask you to clear my name.

997
01:16:40,864 --> 01:16:44,109
- Obviously you're grieving...
- There's more.

998
01:16:44,118 --> 01:16:45,639
- To the story.
- I get it. Go on.

999
01:16:45,744 --> 01:16:47,912
I was the official witness
in Madame D's presence

1000
01:16:47,913 --> 01:16:49,573
to the creation of a second will

1001
01:16:49,748 --> 01:16:52,917
to be executed only in the
event of her death by murder.

1002
01:16:52,918 --> 01:16:54,536
- A second will?
- Right.

1003
01:16:54,712 --> 01:16:56,296
- In case she got bumped off?
- Right.

1004
01:16:56,297 --> 01:16:58,006
- Uh-huh?
- But they destroyed it.

1005
01:16:58,007 --> 01:16:59,583
- Oh, dear.
- However...

1006
01:16:59,758 --> 01:17:01,301
- Uh-huh?
- I pulled a copy.

1007
01:17:01,302 --> 01:17:03,587
A second copy of the second will?

1008
01:17:03,804 --> 01:17:05,255
- Right.
- Uh-huh?

1009
01:17:07,808 --> 01:17:10,184
What does it say? Where is it?
What's it all about, dammit?

1010
01:17:10,185 --> 01:17:13,187
Don't keep us in suspense. This has
been a complete fucking nightmare.

1011
01:17:13,188 --> 01:17:15,933
Just tell us what the
fuck is going on!

1012
01:17:17,401 --> 01:17:21,188
Serge? Serge? Serge!

1013
01:17:24,825 --> 01:17:27,277
Bloody hell. They've
strangled the poor slob.

1014
01:17:55,064 --> 01:17:56,265
Come on! Let's go!

1015
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,366
- What do we do if we catch him?
- I don't know.

1016
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:08,986
He's a homicidal psychopath.
Let's stop.

1017
01:18:08,994 --> 01:18:11,405
I can't. I can barely steer.

1018
01:19:19,064 --> 01:19:22,768
You sick, pathetic creep.
I hate you.

1019
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:39,409
"'If this do be me end, farewell!'
cried the wounded piper-boy,

1020
01:19:40,878 --> 01:19:43,504
"whilst the muskets cracked and
the yeomen roared 'Hurrah!'

1021
01:19:43,505 --> 01:19:44,832
"And the ramparts fell.

1022
01:19:46,342 --> 01:19:50,178
"'Methinks me breathes me
last, me fears!' said he..."

1023
01:19:50,179 --> 01:19:52,297
Holy shit! You got him!

1024
01:19:52,306 --> 01:19:54,424
Well done, Zero!

1025
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:07,813
<i>Gustave H! You are a
fugitive from justice!</i>

1026
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,691
<i>Surrender lawfully and I
will personally vouchsafe</i>

1027
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,033
<i>your fair treatment.</i>

1028
01:20:12,034 --> 01:20:13,652
<i>Do not attempt to flee!</i>

1029
01:20:13,661 --> 01:20:15,370
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

1030
01:20:15,371 --> 01:20:18,490
I'd rather jump off this cliff right
now than go back to fucking prison.

1031
01:20:18,499 --> 01:20:21,201
I say we steal that sick maniac's
motorcycle, go fetch Agatha,

1032
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:24,212
take back <i>Boy with Apple </i>and head for
the Maltese Riviera, once and for all.

1033
01:20:24,213 --> 01:20:27,131
Very good! You're so extraordinary,
Zero. Thank you.

1034
01:20:27,132 --> 01:20:29,751
A moment of silence in
memoriam of a devoted servant

1035
01:20:29,927 --> 01:20:32,713
killed violently during the
conduct of his duties.

1036
01:20:35,474 --> 01:20:37,676
Goodbye, Serge.

1037
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:41,263
Okay, let's go.

1038
01:20:53,742 --> 01:20:55,702
<i>The war began at midnight.</i>

1039
01:20:55,703 --> 01:20:58,454
<i>Pffeifelstad fell by lunch
under heavy shelling,</i>

1040
01:20:58,455 --> 01:21:01,909
<i>and 10 battalions surged across
the long western border.</i>

1041
01:21:02,084 --> 01:21:03,911
<i>High-command advanced to Nebelsbad.</i>

1042
01:21:16,098 --> 01:21:19,802
Compliments of <i>Herr </i>Mendl,
for the executive staff.

1043
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:26,232
General Stieglitz requests a garden-view
sitting room with an extra roll-away.

1044
01:21:26,233 --> 01:21:28,359
Let's put him in the
Duke Leopold Suite.

1045
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,278
Secretary Woroniecki's
office cabled.

1046
01:21:30,279 --> 01:21:33,941
He's checking in a day early.
Rooms 401-2-3.

1047
01:21:34,074 --> 01:21:35,742
Tell Tactical Logistics
we're moving them

1048
01:21:35,743 --> 01:21:37,535
to a standard double
on the third floor.

1049
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,613
They'll need more space than that.

1050
01:22:02,478 --> 01:22:07,357
The beginning of the end of the
end of the beginning has begun.

1051
01:22:07,358 --> 01:22:10,568
A sad finale played off-key
on a broken-down saloon piano

1052
01:22:10,569 --> 01:22:13,363
in the outskirts of a
forgotten ghost town.

1053
01:22:13,364 --> 01:22:15,531
I'd rather not bear witness
to such blasphemy.

1054
01:22:15,532 --> 01:22:16,699
Me neither.

1055
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,319
The Grand Budapest has
become a troops' barracks.

1056
01:22:19,328 --> 01:22:21,905
I shall never cross its
threshold again in my lifetime.

1057
01:22:22,039 --> 01:22:23,665
- Me neither.
- Never again shall I...

1058
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:26,869
Actually, I think we might be going
in there right now after all.

1059
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:30,247
Dmitri.

1060
01:22:32,841 --> 01:22:34,793
Agatha.

1061
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:47,605
Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.
I'm <i>Monsieur </i>Chuck.

1062
01:22:47,606 --> 01:22:51,018
We've booked you and your sisters
into the King Ferdinand Suite.

1063
01:22:51,193 --> 01:22:53,319
Good evening. General von
Shrecker asked me...

1064
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,281
- Who's that?
- I beg your pardon?

1065
01:22:56,282 --> 01:22:59,276
I think that girl's got my picture.
Excuse me.

1066
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:17,753
- Six.
- Hold it.

1067
01:23:20,723 --> 01:23:21,965
Six.

1068
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:26,929
Compliments of <i>Herr </i>Mendl.

1069
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:44,071
Excuse me.

1070
01:23:44,204 --> 01:23:46,456
Have you seen a pastry girl
with a package under her arm

1071
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:47,749
in the last minute and a half?

1072
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,335
Yep. She just got on the elevator
with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.

1073
01:23:50,336 --> 01:23:52,670
Thank you.

1074
01:23:52,671 --> 01:23:54,339
I'm sorry. Who are you?

1075
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,759
- Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy.
- You haven't been trained properly.

1076
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,045
A Lobby Boy never provides
information of that kind.

1077
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:02,506
You're a stone wall. Understood?

1078
01:24:18,906 --> 01:24:20,774
Pretty picture.

1079
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:22,651
Sixth floor.

1080
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:08,071
Where's <i>Boy with Apple?</i>

1081
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:11,450
None of your goddamn business!

1082
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:15,829
I'm going to blast your candy-ass
once and for all right now.

1083
01:25:24,972 --> 01:25:26,799
Drop your weapon!

1084
01:25:48,787 --> 01:25:50,906
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
- Whoa!

1085
01:25:50,915 --> 01:25:52,540
Stop it!

1086
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:54,201
Who's shooting who?

1087
01:25:54,335 --> 01:25:56,920
That's Gustave H! The escaped
murderer and art thief.

1088
01:25:56,921 --> 01:25:58,247
I've got him cornered!

1089
01:25:58,422 --> 01:25:59,923
That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis!

1090
01:25:59,924 --> 01:26:02,126
He's responsible for the
killing of Deputy Kovacs,

1091
01:26:02,259 --> 01:26:05,129
Serge X and his club-footed
sister, plus his own mother!

1092
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:08,924
Nobody move. Everybody's
under arrest.

1093
01:26:10,059 --> 01:26:12,602
Who's out the window?

1094
01:26:12,603 --> 01:26:14,805
Agatha!

1095
01:26:20,778 --> 01:26:21,945
310-bis.

1096
01:26:21,946 --> 01:26:23,564
Hang on! Here I come!

1097
01:26:48,472 --> 01:26:50,674
Something's on the back of the...

1098
01:26:56,063 --> 01:26:57,264
Agatha!

1099
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:59,183
Agatha!

1100
01:26:59,316 --> 01:27:01,518
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

1101
01:27:02,861 --> 01:27:05,022
Something's on the
back of the picture.

1102
01:27:18,335 --> 01:27:21,163
<i>She left everything to</i>
Monsieur <i>Gustave, of course.</i>

1103
01:27:22,965 --> 01:27:25,626
<i>The mansion, known as Schloss Lutz,</i>

1104
01:27:26,844 --> 01:27:30,130
<i>the factories, which produced
weapons, medicine and textiles,</i>

1105
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,802
<i>an important newspaper syndicate,</i>

1106
01:27:35,728 --> 01:27:38,305
<i>and perhaps you've already deduced</i>

1107
01:27:38,355 --> 01:27:43,143
<i>this very institution, the
Grand Budapest Hotel.</i>

1108
01:27:44,486 --> 01:27:46,029
<i>He anointed me his successor,</i>

1109
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:49,115
<i>and as the war continued,
I served my adopted country</i>

1110
01:27:49,116 --> 01:27:53,779
<i>from the narrow desk still found
against the wall in the next room.</i>

1111
01:27:53,871 --> 01:27:56,122
<i>He was the same as his disciples,</i>

1112
01:27:56,123 --> 01:27:59,785
<i>insecure, vain,
superficial, blond, needy.</i>

1113
01:28:00,461 --> 01:28:02,830
<i>In the end he was even rich.</i>

1114
01:28:03,923 --> 01:28:07,251
<i>He did not succeed,
however, in growing old.</i>

1115
01:28:11,889 --> 01:28:13,932
"Dearly beloved, we are
gathered together..."

1116
01:28:13,933 --> 01:28:16,009
<i>Nor did my darling Agatha.</i>

1117
01:28:16,018 --> 01:28:18,603
<i>She and our infant son would
be killed two years later</i>

1118
01:28:18,604 --> 01:28:21,648
<i>by the Prussian grippe.
An absurd little disease.</i>

1119
01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:27,020
<i>Today we treat it in a single week,
but, in those days many millions died.</i>

1120
01:28:30,074 --> 01:28:32,075
<i>On the 21st day of the occupation,</i>

1121
01:28:32,076 --> 01:28:35,036
<i>the morning the independent
state of Zubrowka</i>

1122
01:28:35,037 --> 01:28:36,363
<i>officially ceased to exist,</i>

1123
01:28:36,497 --> 01:28:38,623
<i>we traveled with </i>Monsieur
<i>Gustave to Lutz.</i>

1124
01:28:38,624 --> 01:28:41,034
In answer to your earlier
question, by the way,

1125
01:28:41,043 --> 01:28:43,120
of course.

1126
01:28:44,755 --> 01:28:47,757
Zero asked me about my humble
beginnings in the hotel trade.

1127
01:28:47,758 --> 01:28:50,210
I was, perhaps, for a time,
considered the best Lobby Boy

1128
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:52,921
we'd ever had at the
Grand Budapest.

1129
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:54,639
I think I can say that.

1130
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,683
This one finally surpassed me.

1131
01:28:56,684 --> 01:28:59,769
Although, I must say, he had
an exceptional teacher.

1132
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:01,096
Truly.

1133
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:09,271
"Whence came these two
radiant, celestial brothers,

1134
01:29:09,446 --> 01:29:10,863
"united, for an instant,

1135
01:29:10,864 --> 01:29:15,243
"as they crossed the stratosphere
of our starry window?

1136
01:29:15,244 --> 01:29:18,204
"One from the East and
one from the West."

1137
01:29:18,205 --> 01:29:20,199
Very good.

1138
01:29:20,207 --> 01:29:22,409
Don't flirt with her.

1139
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:27,080
Why are we stopping at
a barley field again?

1140
01:29:35,139 --> 01:29:38,425
I find these black
uniforms very drab.

1141
01:29:42,855 --> 01:29:46,016
Well, hello there, chaps.
We were just talking about you.

1142
01:29:46,025 --> 01:29:50,020
- Documents, please.
- With pleasure, as always.

1143
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:56,159
You're the first of the
official death squads

1144
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,703
to whom we've been
formally introduced.

1145
01:29:58,704 --> 01:30:00,906
How do you do?

1146
01:30:01,874 --> 01:30:04,118
<i>Plus Ã§a change, </i>am I right?

1147
01:30:08,297 --> 01:30:12,000
That's a migratory visa with stage
three worker status, darling.

1148
01:30:12,009 --> 01:30:13,210
Read this.

1149
01:30:22,269 --> 01:30:25,347
- Come outside.
- Now, stay there.

1150
01:30:27,316 --> 01:30:29,901
I give you my word, if you
lay a finger on this man,

1151
01:30:29,902 --> 01:30:32,229
I'll see you
dishonorably discharged,

1152
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:35,524
locked up in the stockade
and hanged by sundown.

1153
01:30:36,742 --> 01:30:38,743
<i>There are still faint
glimmers of civilization</i>

1154
01:30:38,744 --> 01:30:43,240
<i>left in this barbaric slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity.</i>

1155
01:30:46,085 --> 01:30:50,038
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

1156
01:30:50,923 --> 01:30:53,800
<i>He was one of them.</i>

1157
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:56,003
<i>What more is there to say?</i>

1158
01:31:03,352 --> 01:31:06,229
What happened in the end?

1159
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:08,432
In the end they shot him.

1160
01:31:10,067 --> 01:31:12,269
So it all went to me.

1161
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:24,330
<i>After dinner, we went to
collect the keys to our rooms,</i>

1162
01:31:24,331 --> 01:31:26,332
<i>but </i>Monsieur <i>Jean had
abandoned his post.</i>

1163
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,835
I expect he's forgotten
all about us.

1164
01:31:28,836 --> 01:31:30,086
<i>In recent years, of course,</i>

1165
01:31:30,087 --> 01:31:32,498
<i>such properties and holdings
as the Grand Budapest</i>

1166
01:31:32,673 --> 01:31:36,335
<i>had with very few exceptions
become common property.</i>

1167
01:31:37,136 --> 01:31:39,345
<i>While the precise terms
of his negotiation</i>

1168
01:31:39,346 --> 01:31:41,466
<i>with the new government
had never been announced,</i>

1169
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,040
<i>the result was an open secret,</i>

1170
01:31:43,684 --> 01:31:46,470
<i>Zero Moustafa had traded
a great and important fortune</i>

1171
01:31:46,645 --> 01:31:51,100
<i>in exchange for one costly,
unprofitable, doomed hotel.</i>

1172
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:53,102
<i>Why?</i>

1173
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:55,320
<i>Was it merely sentimental?</i>

1174
01:31:55,321 --> 01:31:59,240
<i>It was quite forward of me
and a bit out of character,</i>

1175
01:31:59,241 --> 01:32:01,318
<i>but I felt I must know,</i>

1176
01:32:01,327 --> 01:32:03,529
<i>for my health, I suppose.</i>

1177
01:32:05,998 --> 01:32:08,333
Forgive me for asking.
I hope I haven't upset you.

1178
01:32:08,334 --> 01:32:10,536
No, of course not.

1179
01:32:11,378 --> 01:32:14,380
Is it simply your last connection
to that vanished world,

1180
01:32:14,381 --> 01:32:17,008
his world, if you will?

1181
01:32:17,009 --> 01:32:18,961
His world?

1182
01:32:19,011 --> 01:32:22,138
No, I don't think so.

1183
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:24,390
You see, we shared a vocation.

1184
01:32:24,391 --> 01:32:26,343
It wouldn't have been necessary.

1185
01:32:26,352 --> 01:32:31,306
No. The hotel I keep for Agatha.

1186
01:32:32,441 --> 01:32:34,025
We were happy here.

1187
01:32:34,026 --> 01:32:36,228
For a little while.

1188
01:32:41,325 --> 01:32:43,910
To be frank, I think
his world had vanished

1189
01:32:43,911 --> 01:32:46,029
long before he ever entered it.

1190
01:32:46,038 --> 01:32:47,656
But, I will say,

1191
01:32:47,831 --> 01:32:51,452
he certainly sustained the
illusion with a marvelous grace.

1192
01:32:52,878 --> 01:32:55,213
- Are you going up?
- No, I'll sit for a little while.

1193
01:32:55,214 --> 01:32:57,374
Good night.

1194
01:33:02,388 --> 01:33:03,672
<i>The next week,</i>

1195
01:33:03,806 --> 01:33:06,175
<i>I sailed for a cure
in South America</i>

1196
01:33:06,183 --> 01:33:09,052
<i>and began a long,
wandering journey abroad.</i>

1197
01:33:09,061 --> 01:33:12,139
<i>I did not return to
Europe for many years.</i>

1198
01:33:16,944 --> 01:33:19,521
<i>It was an enchanting old ruin.</i>

1199
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:27,043
<i>But I never managed
to see it again.</i>
