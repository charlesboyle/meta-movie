1
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,385
All the food's gonna go bad

2
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,304
Yeah, I drew up a list

3
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:51,641
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out

4
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:55,395
Fuck

5
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:57,939
- Can you save it?
- No. No way

6
00:01:58,022 --> 00:02:00,608
No, I gotta start over from scratch

7
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:02,944
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

8
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:04,612
see if they can extend my deadline

9
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:07,490
What choice do they have?

10
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:11,160
You kiddin'?

11
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:14,079
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon

12
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:16,415
They do it all the time
Two big heads

13
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:18,375
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night

14
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,127
Just stupid, I guess

15
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,170
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

16
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:24,214
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window

17
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:25,716
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

18
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,342
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

19
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:29,553
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know

20
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:31,221
Order in some new glass

21
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:34,057
Oh, you know what?
That was your...

22
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,685
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted

23
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:39,479
Used to play in that tree

24
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:40,689
It's just stuff, though

25
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,316
You know, we're safe
That's all that counts

26
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,525
Yeah

27
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:46,110
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

28
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:47,904
Hey, Billy, take it easy,
all right?

29
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:49,697
I really don’t want you running
all over the place

30
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,865
But you gotta come look

31
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:53,951
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

32
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:55,203
Billy

33
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:58,331
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

34
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,252
Come on

35
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,254
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs

36
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:07,924
Come on!

37
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:10,008
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

38
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:13,720
You have incredibly low standards

39
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:16,848
Let's go, uh, see the damage

40
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:17,891
No

41
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,898
- Norton's tree
- Yeah

42
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:28,443
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

43
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:30,695
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

44
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:31,738
That tree?

45
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:35,992
- Really got smooshed
- You ain't kiddin'

46
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,078
Look at that

47
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:42,498
What is it, Daddy?

48
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:44,500
Mist

49
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:48,963
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before

50
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:50,965
Coming off the mountain like that?

51
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:53,509
Two fronts meeting,

52
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:55,803
left over from the storm,
something like that

53
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:57,388
You sure?

54
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,889
Honey, I'm not the weatherman

55
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,100
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed

56
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:02,518
I'll take him to town with me

57
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:03,978
Okay Where you going?

58
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,146
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbour about his tree

59
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,314
Hon

60
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,400
Don’t worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose

61
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,818
You know what he's gonna say

62
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,904
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should

63
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,782
Honey, one property dispute
with this guy

64
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,284
is enough to last me a lifetime

65
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,995
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information

66
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:23,079
Okay

67
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,123
- That's all
- Yeah

68
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:30,670
Ohh!
Mother fucker!

69
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,340
Aw, shit!

70
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:37,843
Ohh, you mother fucker!

71
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:40,178
Cock sucker!

72
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:43,348
"Turn on

73
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,642
"Full choke

74
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,853
Pull five choke"

75
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:53,817
I guess you’ve seen the...

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,361
boathouse

77
00:04:56,445 --> 00:04:57,779
Yeah, and...?

78
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,488
Nothin'

79
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,867
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?

80
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,951
That's all

81
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:09,165
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna love me

82
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:13,377
Oh

83
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,421
Shit The 1980

84
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:17,381
I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but

85
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,676
I don't know, the weather was
so beautiful coming out of New York,

86
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:22,970
I just...
You know, top down

87
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:24,764
I'm sorry, man I mean it

88
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:26,349
Sincerely

89
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,685
- That's nice of you to say
- No, that car was cherry

90
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,395
I hate to see it like that

91
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:36,858
Okay, I'll tell you what,

92
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,694
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later

93
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,363
- That okay?
- No problem

94
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:48,662
So, uh, David...

95
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,875
you’re not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

96
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:10,474
Well, CMP's out in force

97
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:12,977
Maybe we'll get our power back

98
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:15,062
I know Some storm, huh?

99
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,438
One for the books, yeah

100
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:18,190
For a moment there last night,

101
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,693
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz

102
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,819
WZON is off the air,

103
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:25,113
but Portland's still broadcasting

104
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,197
Daddy, look

105
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,116
Ah

106
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:30,034
guys from the base

107
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:31,661
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh

108
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,329
The Arrowhead Project?

109
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:36,165
Well, you’re a local

110
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:38,001
Any idea what they do up there?

111
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:39,586
Missile defence research

112
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:41,462
You know, I'm sure
you’ve heard the stories

113
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:42,547
Oh, sure

114
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,008
The woman at the Laundromat
say that, uh,

115
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:48,177
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies

116
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,013
Right Miss Edna Yeah

117
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,681
Miss Tabloid

118
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:55,434
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby"

119
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:59,271
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire"

120
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,647
You know, real reliable stuff

121
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:06,904
Well, they're in a hurry

122
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:08,614
Maybe their power's out too

123
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:18,873
Huh Still no signal

124
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:22,126
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone

125
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,920
Can I go with Mr Norton, Daddy?

126
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:26,797
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess

127
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,840
Yeah
- Yeah

128
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,508
Here's a list

129
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:30,927
- Sure
- Okay?

130
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,178
Meet you guys in there

131
00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:35,264
Hold hands

132
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:41,354
I'm sorry I didn't know
it was your sister

133
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,901
That looks so freaky!

134
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:48,944
Hmm

135
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,411
- Sally, hey
- Hey, Mr Drayton on

136
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,038
You guys look jammed up

137
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:03,250
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out

138
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,669
Oh, no What,
no backup generator?

139
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,212
Only to keep the food cold

140
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:08,838
Everything else,
welcome to the Dark Ages,

141
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,006
and bring your check book

142
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,592
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night

143
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:15,094
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah I'm there

144
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:17,721
Oh, my God

145
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:19,306
The storm

146
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,476
Every body's stockin' up
Been like this since we opened

147
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,686
Crappy day, huh?

148
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,272
Eh, every one's a little
pissed off this morning

149
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,190
'Morning, Mrs Carmody

150
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:31,902
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

151
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:34,196
but I guess we'll have to make do

152
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:37,700
- Keep your head down, pal
- I know it

153
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:42,495
Hey, champ

154
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:44,998
Your wife should be a doctor

155
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:47,208
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting

156
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,086
Yeah, it takes some getting used to

157
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:52,338
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout

158
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:53,381
Okay, done

159
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:59,304
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today

160
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,101
Are you and Mr Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

161
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:06,728
Oh, I don't know

162
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:10,105
"Friends" might be
stretching it a little

163
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:13,483
I guess you’re not mad
at each other any more

164
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:14,568
I guess not

165
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:17,946
And that's a start, huh?

166
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:20,991
I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down

167
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,076
The power outage got us too

168
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,787
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon

169
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:38,341
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes
- We'll make it, okay?

170
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:40,426
You guys get the goodies
I'll wait in line

171
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:47,767
I need some change
on register five

172
00:09:49,393 --> 00:09:51,437
Good morning, Ms Reppler

173
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,772
Hello, Ms Reppler

174
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,983
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton on

175
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,735
How'd you hold up in the storm?

176
00:09:57,818 --> 00:09:59,946
We had a tree come through
the picture window last night,

177
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,197
right in my studio

178
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,241
And the boathouse got all smooshed
Mr Norton's tree fell on it

179
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:05,283
Ouch

180
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,869
- Yeah
Sorry to hear that

181
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,123
How'd you guys make out?

182
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:15,335
Oh, we're fine
It's the listings I'm worried about

183
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:18,255
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over

184
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:20,966
We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?

185
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,052
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

186
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:27,639
but with funds being cut every year

187
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:29,182
You'd think educating children

188
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:31,475
would be more
of a priority in this country,

189
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:33,644
but you’d be wrong

190
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:36,814
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

191
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:40,568
like corporate handouts
and building bombs

192
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:55,708
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

193
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,586
I'm sure she's fine
Don’t worry, okay?

194
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:01,170
Mind what you’re doing, Sally

195
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:03,756
Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave

196
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,841
Check our papers

197
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:06,926
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled

198
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,969
I don't know why

199
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:10,054
I gotta go check the pharmacy out

200
00:11:10,138 --> 00:11:12,599
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes

201
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:13,683
That's an order

202
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:19,689
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone

203
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:54,472
Oh, my God!

204
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:04,148
Something in the mist!

205
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:06,067
Something in the mist

206
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,652
took John Lee!

207
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,070
Dan, catch your breath

208
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:10,988
Something in the mist took John Lee

209
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,823
I could hear him screaming

210
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:15,826
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

211
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,578
Daddy, I'm scared
Can we go home?

212
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:23,041
Don't go out there

213
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:25,377
There's something in the mist
It took John Lee

214
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,921
Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car

215
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:29,506
Mister, no!

216
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:03,289
Please hold me

217
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,332
It's okay, it's okay

218
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:09,545
It's a pollution cloud
The mills down in Rumford

219
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:12,715
Some kind of chemical explosion
Has to be

220
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:15,593
What is it?

221
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:18,303
What's going on?

222
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:22,640
It's death

223
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:59,885
Stay down!

224
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:02,221
Daddy!

225
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:11,188
You okay?

226
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:22,907
That was an earthquake

227
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:26,202
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

228
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:29,747
Is every one okay?
Is any one hurt?

229
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,125
Every body just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store

230
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:36,087
I can't I can't stay here
I gotta get home to my kids

231
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:39,215
No
No, don't go out there

232
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:42,092
It's death out there
It's the end of days

233
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,219
Stop it, okay? Stop it

234
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:47,097
Please, every body,
every body just relax, okay?

235
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,182
He's right Let's just stay cool

236
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:50,642
Let's just try to figure out
what happened

237
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:55,105
I'm sorry, I... I can’t just stay here
I have to get home to my kids

238
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:57,065
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there

239
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:58,817
Could be a poisonous gas cloud

240
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,402
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

241
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:03,113
I agree Let's stay here
until we figure it out

242
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:04,573
You're not listening!

243
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,825
I can't stay here

244
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,787
Wanda's looking after little Victor
She's only 8

245
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,749
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him

246
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,089
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes

247
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:25,593
She's only 8

248
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,095
For their sakes,

249
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,471
don't

250
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,187
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

251
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,649
Shh It's okay, pal

252
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,361
Won't somebody here
see a lady home?

253
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,534
You?

254
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,210
You?

255
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,970
It's okay, buddy
- You?

256
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,307
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about

257
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,980
I hope you all rot in hell

258
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,233
Ma'am, please, wait until...

259
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:01,893
Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

260
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,646
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that

261
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,357
Aisle three has medical supplies

262
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,277
It's okay It's okay

263
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,028
All right, easy, champ
Come on

264
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:13,113
Come on

265
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:15,866
Come on
All right, hey, hey, hey

266
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,576
Can't keep crying like this, pal

267
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:18,994
Come on!

268
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:21,037
Come on,
you’re gonna hurt yourself

269
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:23,456
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

270
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,000
All right, I know you want Mommy

271
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,585
All right, just try to breathe

272
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:28,961
Just try to breathe, okay?

273
00:17:30,462 --> 00:17:32,298
Just try to breathe, pal
That's okay

274
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:34,049
It's all right

275
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:39,722
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was 2 years old

276
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,599
He's in shock

277
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:43,392
I think we all are

278
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:44,852
You haven't met

279
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:46,770
Amanda Dunfrey

280
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,981
She's new in town
as of this semester

281
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,483
Teaches third grade

282
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:54,819
and the specialed kids,
now that Mosher's retired

283
00:17:54,903 --> 00:17:56,821
She's wonderful
The kids love her

284
00:17:57,822 --> 00:17:59,991
And David's an artist

285
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:03,036
He does movie posters and such

286
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,078
And me

287
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:09,584
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

288
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:11,127
My nerves are jangled, I guess

289
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:12,420
Boy settle down?

290
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,005
How is he?

291
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,131
Still hot

292
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:16,716
Why don't I get him some aspirin

293
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,635
- Aisle three
- Okay

294
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:20,261
Thanks

295
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:21,803
How's Dan?

296
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,722
His nose stopped bleedin'

297
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:26,099
He's calmer now
Somebody gave him a Valium

298
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,269
Can't believe the way he ran in here

299
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:31,438
Never seen him like that

300
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:34,816
I need something to cover my boy up
Got any blankets?

301
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:37,778
Furniture pads Loadin' dock

302
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,906
Gonna keep checkin' on people
If you need anything, just holler

303
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:43,075
You bet Sally, you mind?

304
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:45,452
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up

305
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:47,955
- I'll take him
- Okay

306
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:48,997
Daddy, don't go

307
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:52,250
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket

308
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,210
Mrs Reppler's here,

309
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:56,295
and so is Mrs Turman

310
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:58,798
I'll be close by, okay?

311
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:01,467
- Okay
- Don’t worry, I'm not far Okay?

312
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:03,553
Let me look at you

313
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,431
Hmm?

314
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,309
Wanna lie down?

315
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:11,352
Yeah

316
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:13,688
There you go

317
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:17,440
Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe andfree,

318
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,942
but we have to be smart about it

319
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,653
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

320
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,321
and find out what’s happened

321
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,865
Well, how we gonna
do that, my man?

322
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:27,534
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio

323
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:30,162
I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak

324
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:32,497
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

325
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,540
would be their top priority

326
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:48,512
Jeez!

327
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,201
Oh, shit.

328
00:20:11,702 --> 00:20:13,161
Ow!

329
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,164
Shit!

330
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:21,669
God damn it!

331
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,713
Ow! Ow!

332
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,925
Bitch!

333
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,176
It's obvious that we’re...

334
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,220
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here

335
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:32,931
Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit

336
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,350
There ain't nothin'
natural about it either

337
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,392
That's right

338
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:39,145
It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last

339
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:41,688
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that

340
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,273
Ohh, fuck, now

341
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:45,025
You've done that to yourself,

342
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:46,985
by a life of sin and dissolution

343
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,991
Hey, whoa! David!

344
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:37,450
Hey, you guys hear that?

345
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,411
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out

346
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,329
No, no, I turned the generator off

347
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:43,415
It... it was backing up

348
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,419
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

349
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,132
I don't know, like a weird noise,

350
00:21:52,174 --> 00:21:53,967
back there in the dark

351
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:56,511
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door

352
00:21:56,595 --> 00:22:00,140
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

353
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,058
No, only after

354
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:04,393
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

355
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:06,520
- Nobody's calling you a liar
- That's what it sounds like

356
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:09,273
No, no, no, no
Now, don't be that away, Mr Drayton on

357
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:11,400
You had a scare, no doubt

358
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:13,152
What say we all go check it out?

359
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:14,653
Here

360
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:22,578
Oooopf!

361
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:23,621
Man.

362
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,831
It's pretty rank in here

363
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:28,000
- Myron, go check it out
- All right

364
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,253
Go on, fire it up

365
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:43,264
All right!

366
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:44,432
Shut it off!

367
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:47,227
Holy crow, don't that stink!

368
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:49,562
Something's
got the exhaust vent

369
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,272
plugged up from the outside

370
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:53,775
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

371
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:55,318
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it

372
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:56,569
No, no, you can't do that

373
00:22:56,653 --> 00:22:58,654
Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

374
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:01,698
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there

375
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,116
Okay, I'll do it

376
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,077
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there

377
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,162
What, don't you think I can do it?

378
00:23:07,246 --> 00:23:09,873
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea

379
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:11,416
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

380
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,085
J-Jim, right?

381
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:15,671
Myron? You guys are...

382
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:17,840
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

383
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:19,466
or you’re try in' real hard not to

384
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,218
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

385
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,429
You open that door,
and something gets in here

386
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:25,680
Like what?

387
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,891
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard

388
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:30,434
Are you guys being will fully dense?

389
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:32,854
Mr Drayton on, you’ll pardon me,

390
00:23:32,937 --> 00:23:36,566
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything

391
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,484
I mean, we're not
hearing anything now, right?

392
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:39,527
Anybody?

393
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:41,863
See?

394
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:46,242
Now, I know, I know...
you’re a big shot artist

395
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,828
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

396
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:51,205
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book

397
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:52,623
Hey, I didn't say that

398
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:55,041
Nor do I like being talked down to
or called stupid

399
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:58,086
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters

400
00:23:58,128 --> 00:24:00,297
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator

401
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,756
The food'll keep without it

402
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:04,551
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door,

403
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:06,261
and you yell out
when you got enough room

404
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:07,846
Yeah Okay, good

405
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,681
Wait

406
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:10,724
This is...

407
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:12,726
You guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

408
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:14,519
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

409
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:16,021
Would you just
shut the fuck up already?

410
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:17,063
Norm!

411
00:24:17,147 --> 00:24:19,149
Listen, Mr Drayton on,
I tell you what

412
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:21,233
The next time
you got somethin' to say,

413
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:22,651
you count your teeth,

414
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:26,071
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit

415
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:27,615
All right?

416
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:28,699
Come on, Myron

417
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,451
This is crazy!
Leave 'em be

418
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:32,495
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

419
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:35,039
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion

420
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,457
What's going on here?

421
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:38,292
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused

422
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:40,336
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

423
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:42,463
so they're goddamn gonna solve it

424
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:44,006
Ready, kid?
- Let's rock

425
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,466
Norm, come on

426
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:46,509
Don't, man

427
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:52,055
It's a mistake

428
00:24:56,684 --> 00:24:57,811
Pussy

429
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:03,441
Go up!

430
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:26,755
So

431
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,298
any boogeymen?

432
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:32,719
Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

433
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:34,847
Yeah, right

434
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,101
Norm

435
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,854
Norm!

436
00:25:41,937 --> 00:25:43,230
What the fuck!

437
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:44,856
Get it off! Get it off!

438
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:46,858
Get this friggin' thing off me!

439
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:48,651
Get it off! Help me!

440
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:50,528
Help me! Help me!

441
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:53,531
Jesus!

442
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:06,752
There's more! There's more!

443
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:08,754
Somebody help me

444
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:12,299
Somebody help me

445
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:14,050
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

446
00:26:26,438 --> 00:26:27,814
Hang on!

447
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:40,743
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

448
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,711
Oh, Jesus!

449
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:25,787
Shit! Oh, shit!

450
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,956
Oh, shit!

451
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:31,876
David, it's no good!

452
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:34,504
Start the generator

453
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:45,030
Hey, I'm sorry

454
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,201
I mean, how the...

455
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:51,328
how the hell was I supposed
to know what you meant?

456
00:28:52,746 --> 00:28:54,372
You said you heard something

457
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:57,167
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

458
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,459
You should've said
what you meant better

459
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:02,004
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or something

460
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:04,465
You got that kid killed!

461
00:29:04,548 --> 00:29:06,509
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

462
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:09,720
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

463
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:11,013
- Huh?
- David!

464
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:12,389
Don't hit him any more!
Doesn't solve anything!

465
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:15,309
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

466
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,353
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

467
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,249
Okay, I'm done

468
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:42,377
Okay

469
00:29:45,463 --> 00:29:46,923
What's next?

470
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,467
Kill the generator

471
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:51,136
That's the first thing

472
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,431
I'm sorry

473
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:03,230
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

474
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:05,858
I'm... I'm sorry about the kid

475
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:10,112
Oh, God Oh, God Oh, God

476
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,865
We oughtta get out of here

477
00:30:17,244 --> 00:30:18,537
Hey, we didn't twist his arm

478
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,914
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid
He's supposed to be stupid

479
00:30:22,915 --> 00:30:24,834
What's your excuse, huh?

480
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:29,338
Get outta here

481
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:32,258
Go back in the market
Stay by the door

482
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,554
Don't say anything, to anybody

483
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,140
Not yet

484
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:41,726
Not yet

485
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:57,782
Shit

486
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:01,077
David? Need a little light here

487
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,673
We have to tell 'em

488
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:16,592
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside

489
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:19,220
They won't believe us

490
00:31:20,554 --> 00:31:21,514
They have to

491
00:31:21,597 --> 00:31:23,849
I'm not sure I believe it
I was here.

492
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:27,019
W- what we saw was impossible

493
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:29,021
You know that, don't you?

494
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:30,064
I mean, what...

495
00:31:31,732 --> 00:31:33,067
what do we say?

496
00:31:34,068 --> 00:31:36,737
How do we convince them?

497
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,743
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

498
00:31:49,582 --> 00:31:51,918
Oh, my God!
Are... are you all right?

499
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:54,504
Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood I'm fine

500
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:55,880
W- what the hell happened?

501
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,757
I'll explain Give me a minute, okay?

502
00:31:57,841 --> 00:31:59,843
I need to deal with something first

503
00:32:01,761 --> 00:32:03,346
Please, I've got to...

504
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:06,141
I can't let Billy see me like this
He's scared enough

505
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,060
Just give me a minute
Keep him distracted Okay?

506
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,145
Okay

507
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,819
Hey, look,
I'm sorry about Norm

508
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:20,237
Me too

509
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,739
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'

510
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:24,074
Look, we need to tell people

511
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:26,660
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

512
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:29,496
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here

513
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,039
People need to know

514
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,666
What about the out-of-towners?

515
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:35,502
We got plenty of them in the store
Where do we even start?

516
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,796
Brent Norton?
That windbag?

517
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,590
He's an important attorney
in New York

518
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:42,842
That fellow could be
on the bench one day

519
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:45,386
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or... or any here

520
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,013
Yeah, that's right
- Do it quick, David

521
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:50,016
We've got to discuss how we’re gonna
stop that thing getting in here

522
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,851
W- wait What do you mean
getting in?

523
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:53,936
You shut the loading door

524
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,607
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass

525
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:03,404
Jesus Christ

526
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:15,791
I was wondering
where you’d gotten to

527
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:17,375
Um, listen

528
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:20,212
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose

529
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:29,221
they're... they're...
We saw tentacles.

530
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:30,722
Ain't goin' very well, is it?

531
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:33,266
Unh-unh

532
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,851
- You what?
- Come here, you’ve got...

533
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:38,270
Come here

534
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:41,315
Tell him

535
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,401
It's true

536
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:53,661
Tentacles Yeah

537
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:04,295
Um, gentlemen, um

538
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:08,133
I'm sorry, I...
I'm just not that stupid

539
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:09,592
I mean, what do you take me for?

540
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:11,344
I'm shocked

541
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:13,429
I'm shocked

542
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:15,640
I'm shocked It's pretty tasteless

543
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:17,684
using what's happening here
to try to make me look like an idiot

544
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:19,435
No, no, that's not
what's going on here

545
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,479
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

546
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:22,522
I'll show you

547
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:26,192
Blood A chunk of tentacle
on... on the floor

548
00:34:26,276 --> 00:34:27,277
No

549
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,028
No? What do you mean no?

550
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:31,280
No We've got real problems
to deal with here,

551
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:34,533
and this pathetic attempt at a joke

552
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:36,535
has gone far enough

553
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:39,580
Mr Norton, what reason
could we possibly have...?

554
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,290
Oh, please! Please!

555
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,834
This is pay back for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

556
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,752
and you guys are backing him up

557
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,504
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

558
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,756
You wanted to humiliate me
some more,

559
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,176
show me a rubber snake
while these... these hicks

560
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,552
stand around laughing their asses off

561
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:54,887
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

562
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,847
- Hey, hey, fuck...!
Mr Norton

563
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,515
I swear, you have
got us all wrong

564
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,061
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

565
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,190
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

566
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:11,110
and I have seen you
talking behind my back

567
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,946
Y'all stick together

568
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,951
Well, don't I feel foolish?

569
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:21,537
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

570
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,080
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight

571
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,332
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

572
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,793
Glad Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic

573
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,461
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way

574
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,088
I know you’re scared, man
I'm scared too

575
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,257
- Lives are at stake around here
- David...

576
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,635
Okay, my son's life
Now, I need you.

577
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,263
Brent, please,
get your head out of your ass

578
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,432
All right, I'll drag you
back there if I have to

579
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,475
Come here

580
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,561
David, get your goddamn hands
off of me!

581
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,563
I'll sue your ass again!

582
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,899
Sue your ass, and this time
you’ll go to jail!

583
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,441
This man assaulted me

584
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,152
He assaulted me
You were witness to it

585
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,237
This man's crazy
He's crazy

586
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,947
No

587
00:35:57,988 --> 00:36:00,407
He isn't I wish he was, but he isn't

588
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:06,747
E- every one in the store,
you want to come back here?

589
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,459
There's something you need to hear
It concerns you all

590
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,794
Okay

591
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:14,880
W- w-wait I don't know
what you people think you’re doing

592
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,423
You're drinking?

593
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,008
For Christ's sake, Ollie

594
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:22,137
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

595
00:36:22,178 --> 00:36:24,097
Look, I'm gonna be taking down
names, starting with you

596
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,141
And I am prepared to file
a police report

597
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:28,184
- Fine, Bud, write down your names
- I will

598
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:31,104
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen

599
00:36:32,897 --> 00:36:34,149
This is Mr David Drayton on

600
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,527
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you’re thinking about leaving

601
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,279
go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

602
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:40,655
Listen, don't be scared

603
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:43,825
It's okay

604
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,036
Okay

605
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:49,538
This is how it is

606
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:52,040
Now, I don't know
what this mist is

607
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,294
but there are things in it, and they're
dangerous, like Dan said

608
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:56,336
That's right

609
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,755
That's exactly right

610
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:00,674
What kind of things?

611
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:02,759
I never saw it
It happened too fast

612
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:04,636
I got knocked down

613
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,847
Five of us went back
in the loading dock

614
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,517
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie

615
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,269
me

616
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:13,812
Norm, the bagboy

617
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,396
- We opened the door
- Where's Norm?

618
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,192
So Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator

619
00:37:20,526 --> 00:37:22,153
Something come out of the mist
and took him

620
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:23,196
Took him?

621
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:24,864
What do you mean?

622
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:27,617
Just killed him

623
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,535
I mean dragged him off

624
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:34,207
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are

625
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:36,751
All we saw were tentacles

626
00:37:40,713 --> 00:37:41,672
Tentacles?

627
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,468
Tentacles, he say

628
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:49,137
Tentacles from Planet X

629
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:50,555
It's a lie, you know

630
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:53,725
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up

631
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:55,060
It's a pile of shit

632
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:56,603
Of course it's a lie
Of course it's a lie

633
00:37:56,686 --> 00:37:57,687
It's lunacy

634
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:01,233
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans

635
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:03,026
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it

636
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,069
Go look

637
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:11,826
Over there

638
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:18,999
What the hell is that?

639
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:54,784
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here

640
00:39:11,008 --> 00:39:12,468
Yeah, just keep 'em in line
Thanks

641
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,147
Let me

642
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:30,694
help these people

643
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:32,613
Let me...

644
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:34,655
let me preach your word

645
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:39,118
Let me shine your light,

646
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:41,662
'cause they're not all bad

647
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:44,999
They can't all be bad

648
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:51,964
Some can be saved, can't they?

649
00:39:52,048 --> 00:39:53,800
Yes

650
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:55,343
Some can be brought

651
00:39:56,385 --> 00:39:59,639
to heaven's holy gates
through your grace

652
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:00,932
I have to believe that,

653
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:05,393
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever

654
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:10,690
If I can save a few

655
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:14,027
even one

656
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,531
then my life will have counted
for something

657
00:40:18,573 --> 00:40:21,368
I will have pulled my weight

658
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:24,830
I will have earned my place
at your side

659
00:40:24,913 --> 00:40:29,208
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth

660
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,793
Hello?

661
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:48,185
What?

662
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:50,479
I just need to use the bathroom

663
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:51,522
Oh

664
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:55,151
Okay Well, then, have at it

665
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:00,697
Ma'am

666
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:05,618
I... I just want you to know
that it's okay...

667
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:07,370
being scared, I mean...

668
00:41:07,454 --> 00:41:09,998
and, well, if you need a friend...

669
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:12,500
you know, someone to talk to

670
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:14,544
I have a friend...

671
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:18,548
God up above
I talk to him every day

672
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:20,592
Don't you condescend to me

673
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:21,801
I'm sorry?

674
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:25,429
Not ever
You don't mock me

675
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:27,097
That's not what I was doing

676
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,100
Well, I'll tell you what...

677
00:41:30,184 --> 00:41:32,019
the day I need a friend like you,

678
00:41:32,102 --> 00:41:35,147
I'll just have my self a little squat
and shit one out

679
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:42,654
Maybe you do believe this

680
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:45,824
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions Whatever

681
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:49,119
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy

682
00:41:49,203 --> 00:41:51,246
- It's bordering on ludicrous
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom

683
00:41:52,246 --> 00:41:53,247
You're not arguing a case,

684
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:54,874
and you’re doing nothing but damage,
talking the way you are

685
00:41:54,957 --> 00:41:57,919
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to

686
00:41:58,002 --> 00:41:59,462
You still haven't fooled any one

687
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:00,588
Leave it alone, David

688
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:02,340
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

689
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:04,425
even when their hair is burning

690
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:05,968
Denial is a powerful thing

691
00:42:06,052 --> 00:42:07,053
Well, keep talking

692
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:10,473
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person

693
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:13,226
Keep thinking, Mr Lawyer

694
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:16,229
There's no defence
against the will of God

695
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:18,481
There's no court of appeals in hell

696
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:20,982
There's no defence here, either

697
00:42:21,024 --> 00:42:23,276
Not even with all the fertilizer
in the world,

698
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,821
not even if you stack it
as high as you can

699
00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:28,448
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

700
00:42:28,532 --> 00:42:30,492
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

701
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:34,621
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me

702
00:42:34,704 --> 00:42:37,332
Those who want to stack dog food,

703
00:42:37,415 --> 00:42:38,959
knock yourselves out

704
00:42:42,712 --> 00:42:45,048
We got those windows taped up
as best we could

705
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:46,299
It should help

706
00:42:46,383 --> 00:42:47,675
Yeah, think so?

707
00:42:49,718 --> 00:42:51,554
Duct tape and dog food bags

708
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:55,099
That bad?

709
00:42:55,182 --> 00:42:56,142
It's not good

710
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:59,395
There's none so blind
as those who will not see

711
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:02,273
Open your eyes

712
00:43:02,356 --> 00:43:04,608
Let the scales fall away

713
00:43:04,692 --> 00:43:06,652
This has all been written

714
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:11,532
Revelations, chapter 15:

715
00:43:11,574 --> 00:43:13,909
"And the temple was filled with smoke

716
00:43:13,993 --> 00:43:16,161
"from the glory of God

717
00:43:16,244 --> 00:43:17,620
"and from his power,

718
00:43:17,704 --> 00:43:19,164
"and no one could enter the temple

719
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:23,251
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed"

720
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,628
Well, what are you saying?

721
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:27,046
What are you proposing?

722
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:28,715
That we all prepare

723
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:31,593
to meet our Maker

724
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,845
Oh, prepare to meet shit!

725
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:37,390
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

726
00:43:37,474 --> 00:43:39,392
so that it can waggle at both ends

727
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:41,227
The end time has come,

728
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:43,061
not in flames, but in mist

729
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:44,104
Come here!

730
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,314
Easy! Back off!

731
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:48,400
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot

732
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:49,485
How about that?

733
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:51,028
Hey, there's no call for that

734
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:53,697
Myron, please,
calm your friend down

735
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:56,533
I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man

736
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:58,786
- Doubters will doubt till the end
- It's okay

737
00:43:58,869 --> 00:43:59,912
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

738
00:43:59,995 --> 00:44:02,581
A monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away

739
00:44:03,165 --> 00:44:06,543
Things in the mist...
do you doubt?

740
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:07,586
Do you?

741
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:11,089
Then go out

742
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:13,549
Go out and say,
"How do you do"

743
00:44:13,633 --> 00:44:14,592
Shut up, lady

744
00:44:16,344 --> 00:44:17,553
For God's sakes

745
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:19,764
Look, you’ll have to stop now
You're scaring the children

746
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:21,265
They should be scared

747
00:44:21,307 --> 00:44:24,018
Oh, yes, they should

748
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:27,563
Their beautiful, pure little minds

749
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:30,108
have been corrupted with lies

750
00:44:30,191 --> 00:44:31,192
Lies

751
00:44:31,275 --> 00:44:33,361
All this talk of a modern God,

752
00:44:33,444 --> 00:44:36,114
or no God

753
00:44:36,197 --> 00:44:37,864
There is one God

754
00:44:37,948 --> 00:44:39,616
The God of the Israelites

755
00:44:39,658 --> 00:44:42,494
And he is a stern and vengeful God,

756
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:45,122
and we have been mocking him
far too long,

757
00:44:45,205 --> 00:44:48,875
and now he demands
retribution in blood

758
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:51,628
It is time to declare yourselves

759
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,338
Take sides...

760
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:55,257
the saved and the damned

761
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,802
Read the Good Book
It calls for expiation

762
00:44:58,885 --> 00:45:00,720
- Blood!
- What?

763
00:45:00,804 --> 00:45:01,763
Blood

764
00:45:03,014 --> 00:45:04,641
Little Normie was first,

765
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:07,810
and now God calls the rest of us

766
00:45:07,852 --> 00:45:09,353
The bill is due

767
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:10,938
It must be paid

768
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:13,983
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

769
00:45:14,066 --> 00:45:15,568
to prove his love for God, so...

770
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:16,819
Enough

771
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:25,453
- Ohh
- Another down payment

772
00:45:25,536 --> 00:45:26,996
A few more pennies in the jar

773
00:45:27,037 --> 00:45:28,080
Now, that's nice, see

774
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,082
I can't smack her,
but it's okay for you

775
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:31,500
I- I'm sorry every body,

776
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:34,544
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste

777
00:45:34,627 --> 00:45:36,129
They'll come for you

778
00:45:37,172 --> 00:45:39,632
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes

779
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:44,095
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else

780
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:46,139
See if they don't

781
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:47,974
And when they do,

782
00:45:48,057 --> 00:45:50,685
you will cry to God,

783
00:45:50,727 --> 00:45:54,397
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way

784
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:55,815
That's fine

785
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,152
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

786
00:45:59,235 --> 00:46:01,195
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth

787
00:46:01,278 --> 00:46:03,614
You just try it, Ollie Weeks

788
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,157
And you, bitch

789
00:46:06,658 --> 00:46:08,160
you hit me again

790
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:10,329
if you dare

791
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,999
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through

792
00:46:20,756 --> 00:46:22,549
Those of you who aren't local
should know

793
00:46:22,591 --> 00:46:25,427
that Mrs Carmody
is known in town for being

794
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:27,513
unstable

795
00:46:27,596 --> 00:46:30,973
No shit
What was your first clue?

796
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,520
Shh

797
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,397
Hi

798
00:46:38,481 --> 00:46:39,649
What's up, little dude?

799
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:41,526
How come your friends
don't come get us?

800
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:43,069
They got tanks and stuff, right?

801
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:45,905
Why can't you just call 'em?

802
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:47,156
Phones don’t work

803
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,991
But don't you got, like, a radio?

804
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:50,535
Hey, champ, what's going on?

805
00:46:50,618 --> 00:46:52,745
I want their friends
to come rescue us

806
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:54,831
They would if they could, pal
They're stuck here just like us

807
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:55,873
But...

808
00:46:55,957 --> 00:46:57,833
Shh Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there

809
00:46:57,916 --> 00:46:58,875
Yeah, sure thing

810
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,419
Troop, off your asses

811
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,547
You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady

812
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,924
Oh, man, I don't either

813
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:07,467
But you know what?

814
00:47:08,468 --> 00:47:10,262
Maybe she's scared too

815
00:47:11,304 --> 00:47:12,264
You think?

816
00:47:13,306 --> 00:47:14,808
You think Mommy's okay?

817
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:18,145
Billy

818
00:47:21,022 --> 00:47:23,191
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her

819
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:24,233
Aw, hey

820
00:47:25,317 --> 00:47:28,446
Mommy loves you very much

821
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:29,989
And I'll bet she's fine

822
00:47:31,824 --> 00:47:33,826
And I promise you,

823
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:37,079
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her

824
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:40,040
- Okay?
- 'Kay

825
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,543
- Yeah?
- 'Kay

826
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:46,380
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops

827
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:47,798
to make torches

828
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,717
And we've got knives and stuff,
God knows

829
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,177
This maybe
a silly question, Bud, but

830
00:47:53,178 --> 00:47:55,013
do you happen to have
a gun in the store?

831
00:47:56,014 --> 00:47:57,849
Here? No Please

832
00:47:57,932 --> 00:47:59,642
This... this isn't Los Angeles

833
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:01,394
I've got a shotgun in my truck

834
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:04,230
I could try for it if you want

835
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,566
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr Cornell

836
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:07,609
Hold on

837
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,613
This gun, um

838
00:48:11,696 --> 00:48:13,573
my husband's idea

839
00:48:13,656 --> 00:48:15,617
He's away on business a lot

840
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,868
It's not even loaded

841
00:48:16,951 --> 00:48:18,578
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am

842
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:19,620
Um

843
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:24,750
You know how to use that?

844
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,418
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range

845
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:27,961
Hit the target a few times

846
00:48:29,004 --> 00:48:31,590
So, we got a gun

847
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:33,592
Anybody know how to shoot it?

848
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:35,010
Well, I mean?

849
00:48:35,094 --> 00:48:36,095
I do

850
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:39,848
You?

851
00:48:39,932 --> 00:48:42,768
Ollie Please

852
00:48:48,106 --> 00:48:50,024
Some target shooting

853
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:52,276
State champion in '94

854
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,195
You're crazy if you go out there!
Let us pass!

855
00:48:54,278 --> 00:48:56,197
Let us pass, please!

856
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,281
Let's just talk this thing through

857
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:59,534
We have, and we've
made our decision We're leaving

858
00:48:59,575 --> 00:49:02,620
Hey, Mr Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill

859
00:49:02,703 --> 00:49:03,913
Why don’t we just
sit down and just...

860
00:49:03,913 --> 00:49:05,039
What, and let you keep on talking?

861
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:07,208
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that

862
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,377
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already

863
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,461
Your people?

864
00:49:10,545 --> 00:49:12,380
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all

865
00:49:12,422 --> 00:49:13,881
Now... now listen, every one

866
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:16,925
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster

867
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:19,010
I don't know whether
it's manmade or natural,

868
00:49:19,094 --> 00:49:22,973
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

869
00:49:23,056 --> 00:49:25,350
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs Carmody,

870
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:27,060
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

871
00:49:27,102 --> 00:49:28,770
is to seek rescue

872
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:31,648
We're going out

873
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:36,361
- Brent, look
- I'm not discussing this any further

874
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:38,613
I know I just want to ask a favor

875
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:41,825
Tie this around your waist

876
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:43,075
What for?

877
00:49:43,117 --> 00:49:45,244
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet

878
00:49:47,455 --> 00:49:48,456
I'll do it

879
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,500
Are you throwing in with them?

880
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:53,669
Me? No thanks

881
00:49:53,753 --> 00:49:56,213
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound

882
00:49:56,297 --> 00:49:58,507
Gonna get somebody killed

883
00:49:58,591 --> 00:50:01,385
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours

884
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:04,096
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in

885
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,348
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

886
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:08,392
Son, you got brass balls

887
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:11,186
The shells are
in the glove compartment

888
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:12,228
Drive it back

889
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:15,940
All right

890
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:17,692
Just see they're paying out this line

891
00:50:17,776 --> 00:50:19,944
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

892
00:50:20,028 --> 00:50:21,529
just so you understand

893
00:50:21,613 --> 00:50:22,572
Yeah

894
00:50:30,205 --> 00:50:32,540
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

895
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:33,583
David

896
00:50:34,626 --> 00:50:37,878
there's nothing out there
Nothing in the mist

897
00:50:37,961 --> 00:50:39,922
What if you’re wrong?

898
00:50:41,006 --> 00:50:42,508
Then, I guess

899
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:47,554
the joke would be on me after all

900
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:54,103
We're gonna send back help

901
00:50:55,229 --> 00:50:57,564
You'll die out there
All of you

902
00:51:10,326 --> 00:51:13,496
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too

903
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:16,165
I just don't think
he's the bloodthirsty asshole

904
00:51:16,249 --> 00:51:17,583
you make him out to be

905
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:20,378
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him

906
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:21,963
You just chat it over at your leisure

907
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,639
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town

908
00:51:51,783 --> 00:51:52,951
Keep it loose

909
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:10,384
Nice and easy

910
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:11,719
Keep going

911
00:52:29,402 --> 00:52:30,361
Look

912
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:34,824
It's going

913
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,078
They're doing good

914
00:52:56,136 --> 00:52:57,346
Put it down!

915
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,682
Pull!

916
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,978
Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

917
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,816
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

918
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:23,246
Get it off!

919
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:33,631
Oh, my God

920
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:41,806
Aw, sh...
Blood!

921
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,641
Awww, sh...!

922
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:45,351
Oh, my God!

923
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:48,813
Oh, my God!

924
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:04,661
Cut the rope!

925
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:08,331
Shut the door!

926
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,131
Now do you see?

927
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:19,633
Now do you believe?

928
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,395
About a half-hour of day light left

929
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,523
guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

930
00:54:34,565 --> 00:54:35,900
We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right

931
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:38,235
Yeah, check it out

932
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,821
All right, all right
Save it, save it

933
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:42,698
These batteries ain't topped up

934
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:44,909
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick

935
00:54:44,992 --> 00:54:46,077
How quick?

936
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,161
- Five minutes, maybe ten
- Yeah, if that

937
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:50,246
Okay, emergencies only

938
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:52,749
If something gets in the store

939
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:03,051
Holy Jesus,
you scared the shit outta me

940
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:04,636
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really

941
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:09,057
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up

942
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:10,600
- Hi
- Hi

943
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:13,061
Barely How about you?

944
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:14,686
I'm worried about my folks, I guess

945
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,439
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road

946
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,525
That's less than
five miles from here

947
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,276
How 'bout yours?

948
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,861
Well, they're out of town right now

949
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,490
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so

950
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,326
That's lucky
That means they're okay

951
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,369
I hope so

952
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:33,872
So

953
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,500
how soon you shipping out?

954
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,252
Uh, couple weeks

955
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,380
Scared about going over there?

956
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:43,798
Yeah

957
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,638
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

958
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,224
How come you never asked me out?

959
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:56,811
We flirted all through high school
I know you like me

960
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,567
So how come?

961
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:06,863
I'm stupid, I guess

962
00:56:23,378 --> 00:56:25,380
Oh, shit! I'm sorry

963
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:26,673
Don't be I just...

964
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:29,968
I just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?

965
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:32,262
Some shitty locker room at work

966
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:34,931
Can we just stay in here
a while, then?

967
00:56:36,391 --> 00:56:37,975
I mean, just... just you and me

968
00:56:50,071 --> 00:56:52,615
The parking lot lamps
turned on

969
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:53,699
They're on a timer

970
00:56:53,783 --> 00:56:55,785
Must be a different one
that's live

971
00:56:55,868 --> 00:56:58,537
Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

972
00:56:58,621 --> 00:57:00,498
get some electricity in here

973
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,209
That'd mean walking out the door

974
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:15,929
Gaaaahhhh! God!

975
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:18,264
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

976
00:57:18,348 --> 00:57:20,308
David! David!

977
00:57:22,685 --> 00:57:23,686
You sure?

978
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,771
Look!

979
00:57:47,876 --> 00:57:49,336
My God

980
00:58:04,892 --> 00:58:06,352
Are those bugs?

981
00:58:08,521 --> 00:58:09,772
Not like any I've ever seen

982
00:58:10,773 --> 00:58:12,942
"They came out of the smoke,

983
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:14,944
"locusts upon the earth,

984
00:58:15,027 --> 00:58:17,530
"and unto them was given power

985
00:58:17,613 --> 00:58:21,784
even as the scorpions
of the earth have power"

986
00:58:21,868 --> 00:58:24,370
Wow

987
00:58:24,454 --> 00:58:26,914
Look at those stingers

988
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,377
Dear God

989
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,042
Holy shit!

990
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,433
Myron, get the ones in the back!

991
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,645
God, I think they're
attracted to the light

992
00:59:33,728 --> 00:59:36,064
Look out, look out, look out!

993
00:59:36,147 --> 00:59:37,232
The light! Douse the light!

994
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,235
Look out! Look out!

995
00:59:45,031 --> 00:59:46,324
Move! Move!

996
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,786
Light, light,
light, light, light!

997
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,789
"And there came a voice
from the temple

998
00:59:53,831 --> 00:59:55,666
"saying to the seven angels,

999
00:59:55,749 --> 00:59:58,085
"'Go your ways

1000
00:59:58,168 --> 01:00:02,339
and pour out the vials
of the wrath of God upon the earth"'

1001
01:00:11,223 --> 01:00:13,684
Ollie,
the glass is gonna give!

1002
01:00:21,482 --> 01:00:22,483
Shit!

1003
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:24,026
Oh, my God,
they turned on all the lights!

1004
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,279
Jim! Myron!
Fire!

1005
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:27,697
Fire! Lighter!
Douse the lights!

1006
01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:30,032
Come on, come on!

1007
01:00:41,544 --> 01:00:43,004
Sally, look out!

1008
01:00:45,423 --> 01:00:46,423
No!

1009
01:00:54,264 --> 01:00:56,808
Let me see, let me see
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see

1010
01:00:56,892 --> 01:00:58,810
No, you’re gonna be okay

1011
01:00:58,894 --> 01:00:59,853
Let me see Let me see

1012
01:00:59,936 --> 01:01:01,646
You're fine You're gonna be okay
You're gonna be okay

1013
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,065
Give me the lighter!
Put it on fire!

1014
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:04,107
Come on!

1015
01:01:11,156 --> 01:01:13,283
Goddamn childproofing sons of bitches!

1016
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:17,620
Oh, shoot it! Shoot it!

1017
01:01:19,246 --> 01:01:20,915
Shoot it! Shoot it!

1018
01:01:20,998 --> 01:01:22,625
I can't! I'll smash the window!

1019
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,877
God!

1020
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:26,545
Oh, God! Ohh!

1021
01:01:28,089 --> 01:01:29,799
Go! Go!

1022
01:01:32,176 --> 01:01:34,011
Get down!

1023
01:01:40,393 --> 01:01:41,851
Shit!

1024
01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:52,946
Ollie, you want
these lights on or off?

1025
01:01:52,946 --> 01:01:53,446
Leave 'em on

1026
01:01:59,828 --> 01:02:00,912
Oh, God!

1027
01:02:00,995 --> 01:02:03,289
Kill it!

1028
01:02:12,423 --> 01:02:14,383
Bring torches!
Bring something to keep 'em out!

1029
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:15,426
Come on

1030
01:02:17,386 --> 01:02:18,554
Sally!

1031
01:02:30,441 --> 01:02:32,651
Where are the goddamn extinguishers?

1032
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:44,746
Get it! Get it! Get it!

1033
01:02:50,126 --> 01:02:53,087
Bring torches
We need torches at the window!

1034
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:54,714
Plug that hole!

1035
01:03:01,929 --> 01:03:02,930
Dad!

1036
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:10,520
Down! Down! Lay down!

1037
01:03:24,743 --> 01:03:25,744
Ohh

1038
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,121
My life

1039
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:32,666
my life for you,
your will be done

1040
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:48,140
Daddy!

1041
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,476

Somebody please

1051
01:05:10,845 --> 01:05:12,513
Here's some tape!

I'm right here
I'm right here Don’t worry

1053
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:19,979
Hurry up with the blankets!

1054

It hurts so bad! Please!

It hurts so bad!

1056
01:05:32,616 --> 01:05:33,617
Block it up here

1057
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:36,453
Get me some more bags!

1058
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:40,207
Did we get 'em?
Did we get 'em all?

1059
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,918
She was right

1060
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:45,212
She said that
it would happen like this

1061
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:47,381
She said that
they would come at night

1062
01:05:48,548 --> 01:05:50,383
She told us someone would die

1063
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:16,075
Mommy

1064
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:19,661
Ohh, shh, shh, shh
It's okay

1065
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,247
It's okay, it was just a dream

1066
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:24,708
It's just a bad dream

1067
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,627
I want my mommy

1068
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,295
I know

1069
01:06:29,379 --> 01:06:31,631
I know Of course you do

1070
01:06:31,715 --> 01:06:34,259
- Shh
I wanna go home

1071
01:06:34,342 --> 01:06:35,844
Just sleep

1072
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,888
Everything'll be better in the morning

1073
01:06:45,561 --> 01:06:47,020
Think he likes you

1074
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:52,151
Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him

1075
01:06:53,235 --> 01:06:54,695
You have kids?

1076
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:55,988
No

1077
01:06:56,071 --> 01:06:58,198
I always wanted to, but

1078
01:06:59,324 --> 01:07:00,993
things haven't been working out

1079
01:07:03,328 --> 01:07:06,290
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best

1080
01:07:07,499 --> 01:07:11,253
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that...

1081
01:07:11,336 --> 01:07:13,004
they shouldn't exist

1082
01:07:14,505 --> 01:07:17,008
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room

1083
01:07:18,509 --> 01:07:19,761
You're not alone in that

1084
01:07:20,762 --> 01:07:22,221
We're all right there with you

1085
01:07:23,347 --> 01:07:25,099
This isn't gonna end, is it?

1086
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,145
David

1087
01:07:30,229 --> 01:07:32,440
It's Joe He's getting worse

1088
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:52,292
Joe

1089
01:07:54,211 --> 01:07:55,962
How you holdin' up, partner?

1090
01:07:56,046 --> 01:07:59,383
David is that you?

1091
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:01,968
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

1092
01:08:02,969 --> 01:08:05,764
It's bad He's bad

1093
01:08:05,806 --> 01:08:08,474
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this

1094
01:08:09,475 --> 01:08:11,811
If you guys can't help me

1095
01:08:12,978 --> 01:08:15,314
you... you gotta end it, okay?

1096
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:19,860
Ollie's got that gun, right?

1097
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,864
Right?
- No. No way

1098
01:08:23,948 --> 01:08:26,283
You can't fuck with me
on this, bro

1099
01:08:26,325 --> 01:08:28,494
Not with me like this

1100
01:08:28,577 --> 01:08:30,079
I'll do it

1101
01:08:30,162 --> 01:08:32,915
Just give me the gun

1102
01:08:32,998 --> 01:08:34,625
Hey, hey Shh

1103
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:37,794
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

1104
01:08:37,836 --> 01:08:39,587
Joe, now, listen

1105
01:08:40,672 --> 01:08:41,631
Pal

1106
01:08:42,674 --> 01:08:43,842
we're gonna work something out

1107
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:45,635
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay?

1108
01:08:45,677 --> 01:08:46,761
Can we do that?

1109
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,308
Stay with him
I'll be back

1110
01:08:55,687 --> 01:08:59,649
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom
Will you watch Billy?

1111
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:02,652
Hattie

1112
01:09:19,251 --> 01:09:20,252
See anything?

1113
01:09:21,837 --> 01:09:24,631
The last of those bugs
went away about four

1114
01:09:24,715 --> 01:09:25,674
Dawn's coming

1115
01:09:26,717 --> 01:09:28,052
What's on your mind?

1116
01:09:28,093 --> 01:09:29,094
It's Joe

1117
01:09:31,013 --> 01:09:32,847
We don't get him
on some serious antibiotics,

1118
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:34,057
he's gonna die of infection

1119
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,476
Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way

1120
01:09:36,559 --> 01:09:40,271
All... all... all we got here
is liquor and aspirin

1121
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:43,232
You... you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

1122
01:09:43,274 --> 01:09:45,234
Irene Reppler say
they've got Silvadene...

1123
01:09:45,276 --> 01:09:46,986
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards

1124
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:48,029
She knows where they keep it

1125
01:09:48,112 --> 01:09:49,280
Slow down

1126
01:09:49,364 --> 01:09:51,032
You can't actually be thinkin'
of doin' this

1127
01:09:51,074 --> 01:09:52,992
I'm also thinkin' beyond that

1128
01:09:53,076 --> 01:09:54,535
We have to get out of here

1129
01:09:55,703 --> 01:09:56,913
I mean permanently.

1130
01:09:56,954 --> 01:09:59,414
Why? We got plenty to eat!

1131
01:09:59,498 --> 01:10:02,334
What happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?

1132
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:05,003
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm

1133
01:10:05,087 --> 01:10:08,048
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn’t work so well, did it?

1134
01:10:08,131 --> 01:10:10,258
We almost burned
the goddamn store down

1135
01:10:16,556 --> 01:10:17,891
It's Hattie

1136
01:10:24,606 --> 01:10:25,774
Here?

1137
01:10:25,816 --> 01:10:27,817
All right,
gently, now Gently

1138
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,152
One two three

1139
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:41,956
I don't know
how long she was there like that,

1140
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:43,374
lying there next to us

1141
01:10:43,457 --> 01:10:45,126
I thought she was sleeping

1142
01:10:46,502 --> 01:10:48,337
I got my 4-wheel drive

1143
01:10:48,421 --> 01:10:50,005
It's out there

1144
01:10:50,089 --> 01:10:51,757
Y- you’re talking about leaving?

1145
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:54,592
Well, we

1146
01:10:54,634 --> 01:10:56,511
should hit the pharmacy first

1147
01:10:56,594 --> 01:10:57,887
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured

1148
01:10:57,971 --> 01:10:59,389
I mean, if we don't,

1149
01:10:59,472 --> 01:11:01,433
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen

1150
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,518
But after that

1151
01:11:04,519 --> 01:11:06,187
look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people

1152
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:08,481
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

1153
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:09,899
and try to get clear of this mist

1154
01:11:10,859 --> 01:11:12,861
That's it?

1155
01:11:12,944 --> 01:11:14,279
That's the plan?

1156
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,239
- That's what I got
- No, you can't mean it

1157
01:11:16,322 --> 01:11:18,283
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group

1158
01:11:18,366 --> 01:11:20,827
No, no, no Amanda, think.

1159
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,911
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store

1160
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:24,455
That's how much rope play ed out

1161
01:11:24,538 --> 01:11:27,082
I'm parked half that distance
from here

1162
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:29,126
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

1163
01:11:29,209 --> 01:11:30,711
It could be
the entire eastern seaboard

1164
01:11:30,794 --> 01:11:32,963
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know

1165
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:36,341
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

1166
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:38,218
We have one gun

1167
01:11:38,302 --> 01:11:40,304
- How many rounds?
We got ten left

1168
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:41,513
Ten rounds Jesus

1169
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,223
Okay, so ten

1170
01:11:44,224 --> 01:11:46,226
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

1171
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,312
I'll give you the best one

1172
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:49,396
Her

1173
01:11:50,396 --> 01:11:51,898
Mrs Carmody

1174
01:11:51,981 --> 01:11:54,859
She's our very own Jim Jones

1175
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:57,570
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid

1176
01:11:57,653 --> 01:11:58,654
He's right

1177
01:11:58,696 --> 01:12:01,032
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look

1178
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:03,785
No, I don't buy that
It's obvious she's nuts

1179
01:12:03,868 --> 01:12:05,328
Look, a few people maybe, but...

1180
01:12:05,411 --> 01:12:07,705
No, I count four
She's preachin' to 'em right now

1181
01:12:07,789 --> 01:12:09,290
By noon, she'll have four more

1182
01:12:09,374 --> 01:12:11,501
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

1183
01:12:11,584 --> 01:12:13,086
she'll have a congregation,

1184
01:12:13,169 --> 01:12:16,672
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

1185
01:12:16,714 --> 01:12:18,382
to make it all better

1186
01:12:18,465 --> 01:12:20,133
Hmm?

1187
01:12:20,217 --> 01:12:22,135
You, Amanda?

1188
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:23,470
My little boy?

1189
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:25,138
He's right

1190
01:12:25,222 --> 01:12:27,349
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

1191
01:12:28,392 --> 01:12:29,768
None whatsoever

1192
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:31,353
I can't accept that

1193
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:34,106
People are
basically good, decent

1194
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:36,400
My God, David,
we're a civilized society

1195
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:37,984
Sure, as long as
the machines are workin'

1196
01:12:38,068 --> 01:12:39,319
And you can dial 9-1-1,

1197
01:12:39,403 --> 01:12:42,239
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

1198
01:12:42,322 --> 01:12:44,324
you scare the shit out of them,

1199
01:12:44,408 --> 01:12:46,242
no more rules,

1200
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:48,285
You’ll see how primitive they get

1201
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:51,080
You scare people badly enough,

1202
01:12:51,122 --> 01:12:53,624
you can get 'em to do anything

1203
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:57,378
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

1204
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:58,587
or whatever.

1205
01:12:58,671 --> 01:13:00,673
Ollie, please, back me up here

1206
01:13:00,756 --> 01:13:02,425
I wish I could

1207
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,844
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane

1208
01:13:05,845 --> 01:13:07,888
Put more than two of us
in a room, we pick sides

1209
01:13:07,972 --> 01:13:10,558
and start dreaming up reasons
to kill one another

1210
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:14,227
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

1211
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:16,896
Oh, Jesus, that's just

1212
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,981
wrong

1213
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:20,608
Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

1214
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:22,193
First things first...

1215
01:13:22,777 --> 01:13:23,737
the pharmacy

1216
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:27,032
That'll be our test run

1217
01:13:27,115 --> 01:13:28,074
Okay?

1218
01:13:38,334 --> 01:13:40,127
It's all right, Big Bill

1219
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:41,879
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books

1220
01:13:41,962 --> 01:13:43,297
I don’t want them

1221
01:13:43,338 --> 01:13:45,007
I want you to stay here

1222
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:47,092
I won't be gone long

1223
01:13:48,218 --> 01:13:50,137
Just... just next door

1224
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,056
Hey, you’ll be safe

1225
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,641
Daddy...

1226
01:13:54,725 --> 01:13:56,226
Daddy, there are things out there

1227
01:13:57,227 --> 01:13:59,146
Things...

1228
01:13:59,188 --> 01:14:02,107
Yeah There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime

1229
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:04,693
They'll wait

1230
01:14:04,777 --> 01:14:06,445
They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

1231
01:14:06,487 --> 01:14:08,946
and then when you go
and can't get back in

1232
01:14:08,988 --> 01:14:10,490
they'll come and eat you up!

1233
01:14:10,573 --> 01:14:12,825
- Shh
- Daddy, don't go!

1234
01:14:22,168 --> 01:14:23,336
I'll be back

1235
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:25,963
Big Bill

1236
01:14:26,005 --> 01:14:27,298
I promise

1237
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,675
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home

1238
01:14:30,677 --> 01:14:32,303
All right?

1239
01:14:32,345 --> 01:14:34,430
Together, we're going home

1240
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,474
If something happens,
anything at all,

1241
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:38,725
you cut and run

1242
01:14:38,809 --> 01:14:41,436
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake

1243
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,980
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy

1244
01:14:45,023 --> 01:14:48,026
best as you can,
and long as you can

1245
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:49,861
Land Cruiser's yours now

1246
01:14:50,946 --> 01:14:52,489
You... you get him out of here

1247
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:53,907
You just keep drivin'

1248
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:02,499
Where do you think you’re going,
Mr David Drayton on?

1249
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:05,584
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

1250
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,753
My boy is no concern of yours

1251
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,088
Listen up

1252
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,173
We're going to the pharmacy

1253
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,217
We're gonna bring back
some supplies

1254
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,679
Also, there maybe people
trapped over there who need help

1255
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,889
Listen, folks, listen!

1256
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:20,975
We're not gonna take any chances

1257
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:22,518
If there's any trouble,

1258
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,603
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket

1259
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:28,024
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you

1260
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,567
She's right

1261
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,317
You'll make 'em notice us

1262
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:32,652
You'll make 'em come

1263
01:15:33,653 --> 01:15:36,364
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

1264
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:38,283
Lady, this what you call
'"well enough"?

1265
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:39,868
You wanna stop us?

1266
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:41,411
You better explain to Bobby here

1267
01:15:41,494 --> 01:15:43,747
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother

1268
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,999
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone

1269
01:15:46,082 --> 01:15:47,792
You'll die out there, young man

1270
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,920
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

1271
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:54,174
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us

1272
01:15:54,257 --> 01:15:57,093
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said

1273
01:15:57,177 --> 01:15:59,178
Do you want that
to happen, people?

1274
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:02,431
No!
No! No! No!

1275
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:04,516
Well, it is this kind of hubris

1276
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,019
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place

1277
01:16:07,102 --> 01:16:08,771
This kind of pride and defiance of...

1278
01:16:10,564 --> 01:16:12,274
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

1279
01:16:12,316 --> 01:16:14,193
You old bitch!

1280
01:16:17,738 --> 01:16:20,824
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay

1281
01:16:20,908 --> 01:16:22,576
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

1282
01:16:22,618 --> 01:16:24,453
And I got lots of peas

1283
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:27,121
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time

1284
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:28,956
How 'bout it, Army?

1285
01:16:28,998 --> 01:16:30,500
Any help from the armed forces?

1286
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:31,584
I'll go

1287
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:35,505
Jim Grondin

1288
01:16:35,588 --> 01:16:37,090
I had you in school, didn't I?

1289
01:16:37,131 --> 01:16:39,133
Yes, me and my sister Pauline

1290
01:16:39,175 --> 01:16:40,843
Pair of underachievers

1291
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:42,136
After you, Jim

1292
01:16:43,221 --> 01:16:44,639
Yes, ma'am

1293
01:16:44,681 --> 01:16:46,015
Oh, shit.

1294
01:16:46,099 --> 01:16:48,476
That it?
That's every body?

1295
01:16:48,559 --> 01:16:50,061
Every body that's goin'

1296
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:52,146
Yep
- Okay

1297
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:55,273
Single file,
one by one, all right?

1298
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:57,109
Let's get this thing over with

1299
01:16:58,235 --> 01:16:59,236
Let's go

1300
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:01,154
After you
Yes

1301
01:17:04,157 --> 01:17:05,158
Stay together

1302
01:17:08,286 --> 01:17:10,163
You know what?

1303
01:17:10,247 --> 01:17:11,748
Mrs Carmody, you’re not helping

1304
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:13,500
Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

1305
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,674
Save the batteries

1306
01:18:09,137 --> 01:18:10,722
Shit.

1307
01:18:10,805 --> 01:18:12,807
They left the doors propped open

1308
01:18:14,142 --> 01:18:15,685
Think something got in?

1309
01:18:17,186 --> 01:18:20,189
Let's just
get what we need,

1310
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:21,648
get the hell outta here

1311
01:18:21,732 --> 01:18:23,192
Yeah Let's do that

1312
01:18:23,275 --> 01:18:26,111
The meds
are over at the end there,

1313
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:27,696
in the cubicle

1314
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:49,509
Will you not do that?

1315
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,552
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

1316
01:18:51,636 --> 01:18:53,596
Oh, God.

1317
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,621
Where's that Silvadene?

1318
01:19:19,705 --> 01:19:21,206
It's over behind David

1319
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,125
In the fridge Check there

1320
01:19:29,256 --> 01:19:30,674
Silvadene Got it

1321
01:19:31,258 --> 01:19:33,301
- Good
- Ollie, what are we lookin' for?

1322
01:19:33,385 --> 01:19:34,886
Penicillin
Yeah

1323
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,430
Any strong antibiotics

1324
01:19:36,513 --> 01:19:37,514
Yeah

1325
01:19:38,265 --> 01:19:41,684
Pain meds like
Vicodin or OxyContin

1326
01:19:41,767 --> 01:19:43,269
Shh!
- OxyContin!

1327
01:19:44,979 --> 01:19:46,772
Hydrochloride?

1328
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:50,276
Penicillin

1329
01:20:01,537 --> 01:20:02,538
guys

1330
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:08,043
Hurry it up
I hear something

1331
01:20:11,921 --> 01:20:12,922
What?

1332
01:20:15,175 --> 01:20:16,760
Somethin' fuckin' weird

1333
01:20:26,353 --> 01:20:28,146
Oh, God

1334
01:20:28,355 --> 01:20:29,647
Oh, God!

1335
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:33,651
No Oh, no

1336
01:20:33,735 --> 01:20:35,486
Oh, nooooo

1337
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:37,112
Oh, fuck.

1338
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:40,991
Look
There's another one

1339
01:20:41,033 --> 01:20:43,827

1340
01:20:43,869 --> 01:20:46,246

guys, let's get out of here now.

1342
01:20:51,043 --> 01:20:52,920
Holy shit!

1343
01:20:56,882 --> 01:20:59,551
Shit! Shit! Oh, shit!

1344
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:04,013
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Help me!

1345
01:21:04,055 --> 01:21:06,140
Good Lord!
Help him!

1346
01:21:11,979 --> 01:21:13,439
Son of a bitch!

1347
01:21:13,523 --> 01:21:15,108
This stuff ain't comin' off!

1348
01:21:16,109 --> 01:21:18,528
Oh, man!
He's glued to this fuckin' post!

1349
01:21:18,569 --> 01:21:20,405
It's our fault

1350
01:21:20,488 --> 01:21:22,532
It's all our fault

1351
01:21:22,615 --> 01:21:24,075
It's really stuck

1352
01:21:28,413 --> 01:21:30,414
God, I can feel 'em!

1353
01:21:30,497 --> 01:21:32,499
I can feel 'em!

1354
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:36,086
Oh, my God!
Jesus!

1355
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,845
Oh, my God

1356
01:21:44,928 --> 01:21:47,389
I...

1357
01:21:56,732 --> 01:21:58,691
There's more!

1358
01:22:08,701 --> 01:22:09,910
There's another one!
Hit it!

1359
01:22:11,829 --> 01:22:14,123
What the hell is that stuff?

1360
01:22:14,206 --> 01:22:16,083
Ollie! One over there!

1361
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,710
Ollie, there!

1362
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:19,503
Got it!

1363
01:22:19,587 --> 01:22:22,048
There, there, there!
Shoot! Shoot!

1364
01:22:22,131 --> 01:22:24,008
Shit!

01:22:25,925 --> 01:22:26,885
See 'em?

1366
01:22:28,553 --> 01:22:31,765
Bobby!

1367
01:22:31,806 --> 01:22:33,308
Bobby!

1368
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,982
Hold on, man! Hold on!

1369
01:22:41,066 --> 01:22:42,776
- Hold on, man!

1370
01:22:42,859 --> 01:22:43,860
Help me!

1371
01:22:45,195 --> 01:22:46,946
Let's get out of here!

1372
01:22:48,948 --> 01:22:51,284
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

1373
01:22:56,163 --> 01:22:57,498
I got him, I got him
Hold on

1374
01:22:58,832 --> 01:23:00,292
Pull it tight!

1375
01:23:01,835 --> 01:23:03,462
Look! Look!

1376
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,931
Light!

1377
01:23:14,014 --> 01:23:16,517
God!

1378
01:23:19,645 --> 01:23:22,814
We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

1379
01:23:22,855 --> 01:23:25,316
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

1380
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,360
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

1381
01:23:38,663 --> 01:23:40,081
Let's get out of here!

1382
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:44,168
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

1383
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,420
Come on!

1384
01:23:52,634 --> 01:23:54,636
Oh, my God!

1385
01:23:56,346 --> 01:23:58,015
Ollie! Ollie!

1386
01:24:02,477 --> 01:24:04,354
Kill it! Kill it!

1387
01:24:15,073 --> 01:24:16,074
Fuckers!

1388
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:17,241
Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

1389
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:19,994
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

1390
01:24:20,077 --> 01:24:21,871
Drayton on, come on,
come on, come on!

1391
01:24:21,954 --> 01:24:23,456
Come on, Drayton on,
he's dead!

1392
01:24:23,539 --> 01:24:24,498
Come on!

1393
01:24:55,737 --> 01:24:57,072
Open the door!

1394
01:24:58,698 --> 01:24:59,908
Where's Bobby?

1395
01:24:59,949 --> 01:25:00,950
Daddy!

1396
01:25:02,452 --> 01:25:03,453
Close up the doors!

1397
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:04,537
Hurry up!

1398
01:25:04,621 --> 01:25:06,206
What happened?

1399
01:25:06,247 --> 01:25:09,000
They're dead!
They're all dead!

1400
01:25:25,974 --> 01:25:27,935
Expiation, because we have seen

1401
01:25:28,018 --> 01:25:30,562
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions

1402
01:25:30,646 --> 01:25:34,650
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

1403
01:25:34,733 --> 01:25:36,735
obscenities and profanities

1404
01:25:36,819 --> 01:25:39,112
of such nightmare proportions

1405
01:25:39,195 --> 01:25:43,032
And for these evil,
lurking spirits,

1406
01:25:43,116 --> 01:25:45,076
and for these evil people

1407
01:25:45,159 --> 01:25:46,494
How long was I out?

1408
01:25:46,577 --> 01:25:47,954
Most of the day

1409
01:25:49,038 --> 01:25:51,541
You just came over here to lay down
and went to sleep

1410
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:53,292
Just passed out, is more like it

1411
01:25:53,334 --> 01:25:54,794
What will stop this Great Whore?

1412
01:25:54,877 --> 01:25:56,963
Just shut down for a while

1413
01:25:57,046 --> 01:25:58,047
Sorry

1414
01:25:58,131 --> 01:25:59,465
How will it end?

1415
01:25:59,549 --> 01:26:00,550
Expiation!

1416
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:03,261
Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when

1417
01:26:03,302 --> 01:26:05,013
How's Joe?

1418
01:26:05,096 --> 01:26:08,473
Dead Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep

1419
01:26:09,057 --> 01:26:10,892
We were just too late

1420
01:26:10,976 --> 01:26:12,310
I told you this would come!

1421
01:26:12,352 --> 01:26:14,771
Oh, God,
I thought I was dreaming her voice

1422
01:26:14,855 --> 01:26:16,148
No dream

1423
01:26:16,231 --> 01:26:18,442
She's getting people whipped up

1424
01:26:18,483 --> 01:26:21,278
That poor girl is dead,

1425
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,697
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

1426
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,949
She's got 'em believing
she's a psychic,

1427
01:26:26,033 --> 01:26:27,659
she has a direct line with God

1428
01:26:27,743 --> 01:26:30,245
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up

1429
01:26:30,329 --> 01:26:32,622
Like those speeches
Castro used to make

1430
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:38,669
Ollie say you’re thinking of leaving

1431
01:26:38,711 --> 01:26:40,046
I'm in

1432
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:42,089
No Sorry

1433
01:26:42,173 --> 01:26:46,010
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby Mike

1434
01:26:46,052 --> 01:26:47,053
I won't

1435
01:26:47,136 --> 01:26:49,847
do that again
I won't be responsible

1436
01:26:49,889 --> 01:26:51,349
You might want to reconsider that

1437
01:26:51,432 --> 01:26:53,601
What will... what will keep these evil,

1438
01:26:53,684 --> 01:26:54,852
these abominations at bay?

1439
01:26:54,894 --> 01:26:56,395
What will keep them away?

1440
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:59,482
"The rock will not hide them
The dead tree gives no shelter"

1441
01:26:59,523 --> 01:27:00,941
What will end it?
Let me hear it

1442
01:27:01,025 --> 01:27:02,901
- Expiation!
- What are we talking about?

1443
01:27:03,068 --> 01:27:05,570
- Expiation!
- Say it again like you mean it!

1444
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:06,946
Expiation!

1445
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:11,993
Welcome to Sesame Street
Today's word is "expiation"

1446
01:27:12,077 --> 01:27:14,120
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1447
01:27:14,204 --> 01:27:16,873
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy

1448
01:27:16,915 --> 01:27:19,918
His mind's just snapped
Gone

1449
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,503
Hasn't even been two day s

1450
01:27:22,587 --> 01:27:24,089
Not even two day s

1451
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:26,758
I'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what

1452
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:29,511
I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

1453
01:27:29,552 --> 01:27:32,888
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door

1454
01:27:32,971 --> 01:27:35,224
It was your idea
It's your vehicle

1455
01:27:35,307 --> 01:27:36,809
It'll be your call

1456
01:27:38,769 --> 01:27:41,313
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting

1457
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,734
Who will save them? No one

1458
01:27:45,776 --> 01:27:48,862
The rocks will not hide them

1459
01:27:48,946 --> 01:27:51,740
I want some idea
of what we’re up against

1460
01:27:51,782 --> 01:27:53,450
I want to know what this mist is

1461
01:27:54,785 --> 01:27:55,953
I want to talk to the soldiers

1462
01:27:56,036 --> 01:27:57,537
Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

1463
01:27:57,578 --> 01:27:59,831
You heard what that MP said
at the pharmacy

1464
01:27:59,914 --> 01:28:02,250
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking

1465
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:03,960
The situation was insane

1466
01:28:04,043 --> 01:28:05,837
He said he was sorry

1467
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,880
Wasn't that the word
he used... "sorry"?

1468
01:28:07,964 --> 01:28:09,966
That's right
He said it was their fault, right?

1469
01:28:10,049 --> 01:28:11,592
What did he mean by that?

1470
01:28:11,676 --> 01:28:14,178
That's what we’re gonna find out

1471
01:28:14,262 --> 01:28:15,930
Irene, stay with Billy, please

1472
01:28:15,972 --> 01:28:17,265
Verse 17!

1473
01:28:17,348 --> 01:28:19,851
"poured out his vial into the air,

1474
01:28:19,934 --> 01:28:21,811
"and there came a great voice

1475
01:28:21,894 --> 01:28:24,605
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

1476
01:28:24,689 --> 01:28:27,190
"'It is done! It is done! '

1477
01:28:27,274 --> 01:28:30,485
"And there were voices
and lightning,

1478
01:28:30,569 --> 01:28:33,613
and thunders,
and a great earthquake"

1479
01:28:33,697 --> 01:28:36,366
Yes! Come to me!

1480
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:37,617
What?

1481
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:39,911
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em

1482
01:28:39,995 --> 01:28:42,247
Not that big a store
It's kinda hard to lose

1483
01:28:42,331 --> 01:28:45,292
I ain't seen 'em, I said
I look like their keeper?

1484
01:28:48,462 --> 01:28:51,423
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

1485
01:28:51,506 --> 01:28:53,966
I don't know nothin'
I got nothin' to do with it

1486
01:28:54,008 --> 01:28:55,801
That's not what the MP
said in the pharmacy

1487
01:28:55,843 --> 01:28:57,678
before the spiders
came out of his skin

1488
01:28:59,221 --> 01:29:00,973
They're not in the store

1489
01:29:01,057 --> 01:29:04,226
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock

1490
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:05,269
because you know

1491
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:07,521
You saw the good face
of God tonight

1492
01:29:07,605 --> 01:29:08,856
Yes? Tell us

1493
01:29:08,939 --> 01:29:11,150
Here is an old man
who has seen!

1494
01:29:11,233 --> 01:29:13,402
Yes, he has seen!

1495
01:29:13,486 --> 01:29:14,445
Amen

1496
01:29:14,528 --> 01:29:16,030
And I want to say,

1497
01:29:16,113 --> 01:29:18,240
do I want to walk with you

1498
01:29:18,324 --> 01:29:20,992
into my Father's hands?

1499
01:29:21,534 --> 01:29:22,535
Morales

1500
01:29:23,578 --> 01:29:24,579
Donaldson

1501
01:29:27,248 --> 01:29:28,249
guys

1502
01:29:30,585 --> 01:29:32,087
It's the only place they can be

1503
01:29:33,088 --> 01:29:34,130
What?

1504
01:29:34,214 --> 01:29:35,632
Couldn’t just disappear

1505
01:29:35,674 --> 01:29:38,677
Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are...

1506
01:29:45,767 --> 01:29:47,268
I didn't think they'd do it

1507
01:29:47,352 --> 01:29:49,895
They said they would do it,
and I just...

1508
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:52,147
I told them what
the MP said at the pharmacy,

1509
01:29:52,231 --> 01:29:53,357
and they swore they'd do it

1510
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,109
I just... I didn't think they would

1511
01:29:55,192 --> 01:29:56,151
Jesus

1512
01:29:56,235 --> 01:29:59,446
It's the Arrowhead Project,
isn't it?

1513
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:03,117
This mist, it's some kind of, what,
military fuckup?

1514
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,660
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

1515
01:30:04,743 --> 01:30:07,621
We got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1516
01:30:07,705 --> 01:30:08,664
Get in there!

1517
01:30:08,747 --> 01:30:11,750
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

1518
01:30:11,834 --> 01:30:15,337
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

1519
01:30:15,421 --> 01:30:17,880
Those two peckerwoods that
he's been with this whole time,

1520
01:30:17,964 --> 01:30:20,383
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

1521
01:30:20,425 --> 01:30:21,926
They knew it all along!

1522
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:23,845
- He's crazy He doesn't know...
- Get on your knees!

1523
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:25,221
Stay out of it, Drayton on!

1524
01:30:25,305 --> 01:30:27,307
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

1525
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:28,725
All about the Arrowhead Project

1526
01:30:28,808 --> 01:30:30,852
and all that secret shit
up on the mountain

1527
01:30:30,935 --> 01:30:32,395
That's what brung it down on us

1528
01:30:32,478 --> 01:30:34,605
That's what brung down
the wrath of God!

1529
01:30:34,689 --> 01:30:35,690
Oh!

1530
01:30:37,483 --> 01:30:39,402
Private Jessup

1531
01:30:41,321 --> 01:30:42,488
It wasn't me.

1532
01:30:42,572 --> 01:30:44,906
I'm just...
I'm stationed up there

1533
01:30:44,948 --> 01:30:46,366
I'm not responsible...

1534
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:48,076
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

1535
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,162
Most of you people know me

1536
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:52,706
You stop your chicken shit whining

1537
01:30:52,789 --> 01:30:55,417
or I will cut your puling tongue out

1538
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,044
Now you tell us!

1539
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:00,255
Tell us

1540
01:31:00,339 --> 01:31:03,008
Look, look Okay, okay

1541
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:04,509
I heard stuff

1542
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:05,886
Stuff?

1543
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:07,929
Yes, we all heard stuff

1544
01:31:09,306 --> 01:31:13,059
Like how they, um,

1545
01:31:13,142 --> 01:31:15,227
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

1546
01:31:15,311 --> 01:31:18,105
you know, other...
other worlds all around us,

1547
01:31:18,189 --> 01:31:20,691
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

1548
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:22,234
a window...

1549
01:31:22,318 --> 01:31:24,904
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side

1550
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:29,867
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door Didn't it?

1551
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:31,786
Not mine! Those scientists'!

1552
01:31:31,869 --> 01:31:34,413
Oh, the scientists!
Yes, the scientists!

1553
01:31:34,497 --> 01:31:36,624
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident

1554
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:38,459
This other world
came spilling through to ours

1555
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:41,878
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself

1556
01:31:41,961 --> 01:31:43,922
I didn't understand the half of it

1557
01:31:45,882 --> 01:31:47,425
It ain't my fault!

1558
01:31:47,509 --> 01:31:48,551
Oh

1559
01:31:49,636 --> 01:31:52,973
Ain't His Fault

1560
01:31:53,056 --> 01:31:55,600
No, no, no

1561
01:31:55,642 --> 01:31:57,018
Ain't nothin'

1562
01:31:57,102 --> 01:31:59,688
Ever anybody's fault

1563
01:31:59,771 --> 01:32:02,107
But he denies it

1564
01:32:02,148 --> 01:32:04,651
He points the finger,

1565
01:32:04,734 --> 01:32:07,820
this Judas in our midst

1566
01:32:07,903 --> 01:32:08,904
Judas!

1567
01:32:08,988 --> 01:32:10,823
David!

1568
01:32:10,906 --> 01:32:13,158
You! You!

1569
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,160
Don't you know by now?

1570
01:32:15,202 --> 01:32:17,287
Don't you know the truth?

1571
01:32:17,371 --> 01:32:19,957
We are being punished

1572
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:23,627
For what? For going
against the will of God!

1573
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:27,965
For going against
his forbidden rules of old!

1574
01:32:28,007 --> 01:32:29,508
Walking on the moon!

1575
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,093
Yes! Yes!

1576
01:32:31,176 --> 01:32:34,053
- Or... or splitting his atoms!
Amen!

1577
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:36,514
Or... or... or stem cells

1578
01:32:36,597 --> 01:32:38,850
and abortions!

1579
01:32:38,933 --> 01:32:41,894
And destroying the secrets of life

1580
01:32:41,978 --> 01:32:45,231
that only God above has any right to!

1581
01:32:45,315 --> 01:32:46,816
Amen! Amen!

1582
01:32:46,858 --> 01:32:49,444
Yes, I know! It is true!

1583
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:51,988
And now we are being punished

1584
01:32:52,071 --> 01:32:55,074
The judgment is being
brought down upon us

1585
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:57,827
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

1586
01:32:57,869 --> 01:33:01,497
and star Wormwood blazes!

1587
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:02,873
And it is his fault!

1588
01:33:02,956 --> 01:33:06,293
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

1589
01:33:06,376 --> 01:33:09,338
They did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

1590
01:33:09,421 --> 01:33:10,422
No!

1591
01:33:10,505 --> 01:33:12,716
Get over there!

1592
01:33:13,258 --> 01:33:14,343
No!

1593
01:33:14,426 --> 01:33:16,053
Judas!

1594
01:33:17,387 --> 01:33:18,347
Jim!

1595
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:20,891
Kill him! String him up!

1596
01:33:23,977 --> 01:33:25,646
Stand up, you coward!

1597
01:33:30,232 --> 01:33:31,359
Jesus!

1598
01:33:34,362 --> 01:33:35,571
No!

1599
01:33:37,114 --> 01:33:39,283
Expiation!

1600
01:33:39,867 --> 01:33:40,951
- No!
Stab him!

1601
01:33:42,536 --> 01:33:44,455
Expiation!

1602
01:33:44,538 --> 01:33:47,249
Feed him to the beast!

1603
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,251
Expiation!

1604
01:33:49,335 --> 01:33:53,297
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

1605
01:33:54,799 --> 01:33:56,467
No, no! No!

1606
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:02,430
- Jesus! Wait!
- No, David!

1607
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:00,611
Please

1608
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:13,916
The beast will leave us alone tonight

1609
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:16,419
Tomorrow

1610
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:20,255
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see

1611
01:35:29,598 --> 01:35:30,766
Daddy

1612
01:35:32,434 --> 01:35:33,602
Daddy

1613
01:35:45,447 --> 01:35:47,282
Sorry I left you, pal

1614
01:35:49,617 --> 01:35:51,285
I'll never leave you again

1615
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:53,788
Promise?

1616
01:35:55,206 --> 01:35:58,876
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

1617
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,380
Your very best promise,
and can never break it

1618
01:36:02,463 --> 01:36:04,215
Tell me

1619
01:36:05,883 --> 01:36:08,219
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me

1620
01:36:11,889 --> 01:36:14,058
Ever No matter what

1621
01:36:15,767 --> 01:36:17,227
I promise

1622
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,273
I love you, Daddy

1623
01:36:22,857 --> 01:36:24,234
I love you, Billy

1624
01:36:25,235 --> 01:36:26,569
More than anything

1625
01:36:56,265 --> 01:36:57,433
It's dawn

1626
01:37:02,896 --> 01:37:05,733
Hey, pal,
you ready to go home?

1627
01:37:05,774 --> 01:37:07,151
Come on

1628
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:12,572
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two

1629
01:37:12,613 --> 01:37:15,116
Five bags We can grab 'em
and get out the door

1630
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:16,492
Okay

1631
01:37:16,576 --> 01:37:20,288
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end

1632
01:37:20,371 --> 01:37:22,707
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

1633
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:25,293
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

1634
01:37:25,376 --> 01:37:26,544
Let's go

1635
01:37:49,941 --> 01:37:52,152
Stealing food now?

1636
01:37:56,406 --> 01:37:58,408
Going out now, Mrs Carmody

1637
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:01,370
Please stand aside

1638
01:38:02,788 --> 01:38:05,332
You can't go out
I won't allow it

1639
01:38:05,415 --> 01:38:06,749
Won't allow it?

1640
01:38:06,832 --> 01:38:09,502
It's against God's will

1641
01:38:09,543 --> 01:38:11,671
Don't you know that by now?

1642
01:38:11,754 --> 01:38:16,300
Haven't I proven my self
again and again and again?

1643
01:38:16,384 --> 01:38:20,846
Haven't I shown that I am his vessel?

1644
01:38:25,726 --> 01:38:27,228
What's the matter with you?

1645
01:38:30,564 --> 01:38:32,024
Don't you believe in God?

1646
01:38:33,025 --> 01:38:34,567
No one's interfered with you

1647
01:38:34,651 --> 01:38:37,237
All we're asking for
is the same privilege

1648
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,655
You heard him

1649
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:44,244
It is these people
who brought this upon us

1650
01:38:45,537 --> 01:38:46,496
They...

1651
01:38:46,579 --> 01:38:50,542
people who refused to bend
to the will of God,

1652
01:38:50,583 --> 01:38:53,169
and claim it privilege

1653
01:38:53,253 --> 01:38:56,256
Sinners in pride

1654
01:38:56,339 --> 01:38:58,341
Yes, haughty

1655
01:38:58,383 --> 01:39:00,010
Privileged!

1656
01:39:00,552 --> 01:39:04,388
They mock us They mock our...
our God, our faith,

1657
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:07,891
our values, our very lifestyle

1658
01:39:07,933 --> 01:39:10,102
They mock our humility

1659
01:39:10,185 --> 01:39:12,021
and our piousness

1660
01:39:12,062 --> 01:39:15,232
They piss on us and laugh

1661
01:39:18,485 --> 01:39:20,154
It's from them

1662
01:39:20,237 --> 01:39:23,741
the blood of human sacrifice
must come

1663
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:25,784
From them

1664
01:39:25,868 --> 01:39:28,454
- Come on
- the blood of expiation

1665
01:39:28,537 --> 01:39:29,537
Come on

1666
01:39:29,579 --> 01:39:31,164
You try it

1667
01:39:31,247 --> 01:39:32,582
Fuckin' try it!

1668
01:39:32,624 --> 01:39:34,083
Come on!

1669
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:36,419
Get 'em!
- We want the boy

1670
01:39:36,461 --> 01:39:37,754
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

1671
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,006
- Yeah!
- You get back!

1672
01:39:40,089 --> 01:39:41,007
The boy!

1673
01:39:42,592 --> 01:39:44,427
Grab that boy! Grab him!

1674
01:39:48,473 --> 01:39:49,807
Grab him!

1675
01:39:51,434 --> 01:39:53,269
And get the whore too!

1676
01:39:53,353 --> 01:39:54,812
Grab her!

1677
01:39:54,896 --> 01:39:57,314
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

1678
01:40:12,371 --> 01:40:14,206
Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

1679
01:40:21,129 --> 01:40:22,798
I... I killed her

1680
01:40:24,966 --> 01:40:25,925
Thank you, Ollie

1681
01:40:28,135 --> 01:40:29,387
Let's go

1682
01:40:30,471 --> 01:40:33,641
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please

1683
01:40:36,143 --> 01:40:37,812
You killed her!

1684
01:40:37,895 --> 01:40:40,231
You murdered her!

1685
01:40:43,818 --> 01:40:45,278
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,

1686
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:46,988
not if there'd been any other way

1687
01:40:47,071 --> 01:40:48,572
That's why I said thank you

1688
01:40:48,656 --> 01:40:49,782
Okay

1689
01:40:49,865 --> 01:40:52,200
Okay, then
let's go!

1690
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,161
Get up, Myron!

1691
01:40:55,245 --> 01:40:56,496
Come on! We gotta go!

1692
01:40:56,579 --> 01:40:57,580
My ankle!

1693
01:41:06,047 --> 01:41:08,174
Okay All the way down!

1694
01:41:09,217 --> 01:41:10,844
Where are they?

1695
01:41:10,927 --> 01:41:12,762
Bud! Myron!

1696
01:41:12,846 --> 01:41:13,847
Ambrose!

1697
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:15,515
I think I broke it!

1698
01:41:15,598 --> 01:41:17,142
Come on! Come on!

1699
01:41:17,225 --> 01:41:18,727
We gotta go!
Come on, come on!

1700
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:20,019
They're lost!

1701
01:41:27,735 --> 01:41:29,361
- Oh, Jesus
- Ollie!

1702
01:41:29,445 --> 01:41:31,989
Ollie!

1703
01:42:11,736 --> 01:42:13,071
All that screaming!

1704
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:16,573
Are they out there?
Can they see us?

1705
01:42:26,416 --> 01:42:28,835
Let me... let me in!
Let me in!

1706
01:42:43,265 --> 01:42:44,767
Are we going?

1707
01:42:51,607 --> 01:42:52,900
- No
- Yeah

1708
01:42:52,942 --> 01:42:55,069
- No! No!
- Yeah!

1709
01:42:55,111 --> 01:42:56,445
- Daddy
- David

1710
01:42:56,529 --> 01:42:58,447
- David, no
- Daddy, no

1711
01:42:58,531 --> 01:43:00,283
- David!
- Daddy!

1712
01:43:00,366 --> 01:43:01,867
Get back in the car!

1713
01:43:01,951 --> 01:43:03,577
- Daddy!
- David!

1714
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,630
Oh, my God!

1715
01:43:18,466 --> 01:43:20,427
Oh, my God!

1716
01:43:40,613 --> 01:43:41,614
We gotta go

1717
01:45:40,812 --> 01:45:42,772
I told her I'd fix it

1718
01:45:46,192 --> 01:45:48,111
Front window

1719
01:45:48,194 --> 01:45:49,529
broken open

1720
01:45:53,283 --> 01:45:54,409
Tree

1721
01:45:56,619 --> 01:45:57,578
My

1722
01:45:58,662 --> 01:45:59,997
grandfather's tree

1723
01:46:15,054 --> 01:46:18,390
I'm sorry, David,
I'm just so sorry

1724
01:46:33,488 --> 01:46:34,447
Let's, uh

1725
01:46:36,824 --> 01:46:37,951
see how far this

1726
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,955
fuel takes us, huh?

1727
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:47,085
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist

1728
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:04,567
Well

1729
01:50:05,817 --> 01:50:07,819
we gave it a good shot

1730
01:50:09,237 --> 01:50:10,739
Nobody can say we didn't

1731
01:50:12,741 --> 01:50:14,451
Nope

1732
01:50:14,534 --> 01:50:16,369
Nobody can say that

1733
01:51:45,455 --> 01:51:46,415
Well

1734
01:51:48,625 --> 01:51:50,127
We got, uh

1735
01:51:54,631 --> 01:51:55,590
four

1736
01:52:00,303 --> 01:52:01,262
Four bullets

1737
01:52:05,891 --> 01:52:07,393
But there's five of us

1738
01:52:17,903 --> 01:52:19,655
I'll figure something out

1739
01:54:18,394 --> 01:54:19,895
Come on!

1740
01:54:25,901 --> 01:54:27,236
Come on!

1741
01:54:28,529 --> 01:54:30,031
Come on!

1742
01:54:33,409 --> 01:54:36,370
Come on Come on

1743
01:54:36,454 --> 01:54:39,665
Come on

1744
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:48,214
Come on

1745
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:50,091
Come on

1746
01:54:50,258 --> 01:54:51,760
Come on

1747
01:54:52,844 --> 01:54:54,638
Come on, come on!

1748
01:54:54,804 --> 01:54:57,891
Come on! Come on!

1749
01:56:34,984 --> 01:56:37,486
They're... they're dead

1750
01:56:37,570 --> 01:56:39,030
For what?
