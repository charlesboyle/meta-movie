1
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,234
I watched Signs again last night.

2
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,399
It keeps getting better
every time I see it.

3
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,106
It's funny.

4
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:08,741
The first time you watch it,
it's hard to understand what it's about.

5
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,004
It just sort of meanders.

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:17,078
And then, everything comes together
in this one perfect moment at the end.

7
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,515
And when you watch it a second
or a third or a fourth time,

8
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:26,096
you start to see that
all of this randomness

9
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,895
is leading towards a perfect moment.

10
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:35,169
My favorite character is the little girl.

11
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,032
Everyone thinks she's so strange

12
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,676
because she can't finish
a glass of water.

13
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,809
She's convinced they're contaminated.

14
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,645
So, by the end of the film,

15
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,323
there are glasses of water
littered around this house.

16
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,226
And then, it's the water that saves them.

17
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,462
And that was fate.

18
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,869
I can't help but wonder about my fate.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,073
About my destiny.

20
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,202
<i>Renewal.</i>

21
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,202
<i>Vitality.</i>

22
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,907
<i>Energy-</i>

23
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,140
<i>Are you tired of feeling sluggish?</i>

24
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,146
<i>Do you feel like life is passing you by?</i>

25
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,614
<i>Then we've got the solution for you.</i>

26
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,723
<i>It's called "The Most Incredible Vitamin

27
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,359
<i>and there's a reason you're watching
this right now.</i>

28
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,963
<i>Just pick up the phone

29
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,436
<i>Call now. Not available in stores.</i>

30
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,477
<i>Made in Germany.
Beware of imitators. Call 1-800...</i>

31
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,440
Hello?

32
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,847
<i>Yo, Kevin.</i>

33
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,218
No, this is Jeff.

34
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,810
<i>Where Kevin at?</i>

35
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,214
I don't know.

36
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,722
<i>Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!</i>

37
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,917
<i>Where the fuck is Kevin?</i>

38
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,422
Kevin doesn't live here.

39
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,123
<i>There's always some motherfucker
trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!</i>

40
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:24,362
<i>Let me put this word in your fucking
peanut brain, Kevin! K-E- V-I-N!</i>

41
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,349
Kevin.

42
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,327
What are you doing?

43
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,589
Doing this.

44
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,958
Some strawbs,

45
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,192
hand-sliced.

46
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,368
A white rose of whipped cream. Bam!

47
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,302
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

48
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,846
What's the special occasion?

49
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,509
This is one of those
"just because" breakfasts, you know?

50
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,951
It sounds corny,
but relationships are like flowers

51
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,012
and flowers need water to bloom.

52
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:24,050
Consider this sprinkling
from a watering can.

53
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,453
Well, thanks.

54
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,990
- That's nice.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.

55
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:35,032
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.

56
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,300
Yeah?

57
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,433
I got a phone call from Randy.

58
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,172
Is he the guy
that we talked to at that barbecue?

59
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,714
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.

60
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,113
- But that guy's name was Randy, right?
- Yes.

61
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,344
I liked his wife.

62
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,950
Different Randy.

63
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,851
- We should have them over.
- Yeah.

64
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,686
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.

65
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,352
Can I tell you something?

66
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:00,159
With no money down,
this thing is practically free.

67
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,391
Pat! No!

68
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,832
Whoa, whoa. Don't start with no.

69
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,666
- That's what this is.
- Don't start with no.

70
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,728
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...

71
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,934
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.

72
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,534
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.

73
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,045
Honey, look, I'm trying
to be really careful,

74
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,275
and I've cut back on some things.

75
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,613
And, like, we promised
we were going to get a house this year...

76
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,346
I'm just trying
to be a grown-up about this.

77
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,354
Surprise.

78
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,824
We got it.

79
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,892
This is happening.

80
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:40,195
Look... Everything you just
said about the house,

81
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,603
you know, our future,

82
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,831
you're exactly right.

83
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,238
And I'm so lucky to have you

84
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,179
looking out for us in that way.

85
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,851
But I'm looking out
for us in another way.

86
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,784
I'm looking out for...

87
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,886
That intangible thing
that every couple needs.

88
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,395
It's a little bit of magic,
and a little bit of danger, frankly.

89
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,396
This is gonna solve
a lot of our problems.

90
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,560
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing

91
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,298
and you feel the energy

92
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,203
and you feel it rumble

93
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,667
in your gut.

94
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:23,907
If you don't get turned on,
you're made of stone.

95
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,014
Where is it?

96
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,909
It's in the driveway.

97
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,785
Are you... Is this...

98
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,294
Oh, come on. Okay, okay... That's...

99
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,509
Hello?

100
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,980
- Mom?
<i>- Jeff.</i>

101
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,216
Hi.

102
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,519
You know, you're supposed to say
"hello" when you pick up the phone.

103
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,958
Yeah, I know.

104
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,291
I thought that maybe
you were somebody else, but you're not.

105
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,059
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.

106
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,121
You really want to know?

107
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,258
You didn't like it last time
we had this conversation.

108
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,734
Okay, no. You know what?
You're right. I don't.

109
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,929
Did you get the wood glue?

110
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,562
What are you talking about?

111
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,538
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.

112
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,507
I haven't been upstairs.

113
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,477
One of the shutters on the pantry
is broken and I need you to fix it.

114
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,514
You know what,
I'm kind of busy right now, so...

115
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,482
All I want for my birthday
is for you to get your ass off that couch,

116
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,813
and you get on the bus

117
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,716
<i>-and you go to the Home Depot.
- I'm not on the couch.</i>

118
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,382
You come home and fix the shutter
before I get home,

119
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,153
or you're gonna find
someplace else to live.

120
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,386
<i>- Fine.
- Fine.</i>

121
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,928
Good. You got it? Do you understand?

122
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,396
Yes, Mom! Okay!

123
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,126
Love you! Goodbye.

124
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,025
Did you hang up on me?

125
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,945
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

126
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,702
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?

127
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,804
Sorry. Thank you.

128
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,559
Can I help you?

129
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,100
Can I help you, sir?

130
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,198
No.

131
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,436
What?

132
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,985
Pass the ball!

133
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,199
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

134
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,478
Shit, you a'ight?

135
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,981
Get your big ass up, man.

136
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,914
You bleeding and shit?

137
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,390
- He out, man.
- We need another person.

138
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,790
We need one!

139
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,218
You got next.

140
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,162
Who, him?

141
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,324
He gonna be a ref?

142
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,993
That's all we got. That's all we got.

143
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,934
Let's see what he got.

144
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,336
Let's go, dawg. Get out here.

145
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,079
Oh, he's passing now.

146
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,646
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?

147
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,556
That's your man.

148
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,360
Why don't you play some D, man?

149
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,297
Right, right, right.

150
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,364
Hell, no!

151
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,805
You working on this? Come on, man.

152
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,479
Go, go, go, go.

153
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,793
I'm Jeff.

154
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,832
Kevin.

155
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:29,929
Ke...

156
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,167
Kevin.

157
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,402
Is your name Kevin Kevin?

158
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,871
No.

159
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,242
So, that's your first name
on your jersey?

160
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,880
Yeah, that's my name.

161
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,212
Yeah.

162
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,945
Do you live around here?

163
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,944
Yeah, I don't live far from here.

164
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,115
You obviously don't
live around here, though.

165
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,352
No, I was just strolling around today.

166
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,691
It was a nice day,
so I thought I'd walk around.

167
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,752
Were you following me, or...

168
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,127
No. I mean, no.

169
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,598
I saw you on the bus.

170
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,828
Let me explain.

171
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,831
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?

172
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,840
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin,
and Abigail Breslin?

173
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,639
Nah, I don't think I have.

174
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,747
I got a phone call this morning.

175
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,640
Someone was asking for Kevin.

176
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,152
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.

177
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,279
It's kind of a common name.

178
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,154
Yeah. I guess that's true.

179
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,715
I mean, you never got a call,

180
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,783
like someone called
the wrong house phone?

181
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,591
What if there's no wrong numbers?

182
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,223
Maybe it's always the right house phone.

183
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,302
Everything happens for a reason, right?

184
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,563
Exactly. No, that's exactly it.

185
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,405
Hey, man, I'm about to go
put something in the air real quick.

186
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,878
I don't know if you want to come.

187
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,912
I don't... I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.

188
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,382
Smoke weed?

189
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,085
You want to smoke weed with me?

190
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,178
Yeah, man.

191
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,724
I like weed.

192
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,418
Yeah, I can see that.

193
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,432
Wow.

194
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,333
It's nice in here.

195
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,084
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

196
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,323
Oh, shit. That's a treat.

197
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,498
Check his pockets!

198
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,003
Sorry, Jeff.

199
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,716
Marriage is a compromise.

200
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,223
She got what she wanted,
I'm living here in Baton Rouge.

201
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,090
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.

202
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,991
- Right?
- Sure.

203
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,855
Yeah.

204
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,490
Thank you. You know what's up.

205
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,999
I got to take this... It's a business call.

206
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,467
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?

207
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,766
Whatever.

208
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:26,680
Fine. I will get glue and fix your shutter.

209
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,275
No. It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.

210
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,185
<i>He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.</i>

211
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,349
Okay. What are you...
Why are you calling me?

212
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,887
Maybe you could get him
moving a little bit. Do you understand?

213
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,794
<i>He's stuck, honey. He's stuck.</i>

214
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,230
He's 30!

215
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,131
He had a difficult adolescent period.

216
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,195
You of all people would know neither of
us had a very easy adolescent period.

217
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,236
<i>- You were older.
- What does that have to do with it?</i>

218
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,302
When you're an adult, you take
responsibility for your life. Okay?

219
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,609
<i>But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?</i>

220
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,413
You know, fake it
for a little bit just to get... You know.

221
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,748
Maybe he'll grow on you.

222
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,979
We don't do that, Mom. We don't

223
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,085
spend time together.

224
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,653
<i>Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.</i>

225
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,491
I gotta call you back.

226
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,434
- No, no, no, Pat...
- Bye.

227
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,335
Damn it. Asshole.

228
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,102
Jeff!

229
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,965
Pat?

230
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,704
What the hell are you doing here?

231
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,712
Kevin beat me up. I walked.

232
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,803
Who's Kevin?

233
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,272
Some kid I was following.

234
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,512
Well, if he's a kid,
how come you didn't kick his ass?

235
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,290
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.

236
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,847
Right. I forgot. You're a pussy.

237
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,256
Look, Mom called
and she's really pissed.

238
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,521
Was Gandhi a pussy?

239
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,755
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.

240
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,855
And once again,
I have to pick up your slack.

241
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,263
Well, it's not your problem.

242
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,323
Well, it becomes my problem

243
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,528
when Mom calls me
in the middle of a business meeting.

244
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,572
Yeah? You're having
a business meeting at Hooters?

245
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,799
Yeah. Yes.

246
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,965
That's very classy.

247
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,872
Right. Well, business is business.

248
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,538
So, come on. Get in the car.

249
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,276
Hey! You don't need to grab onto me.

250
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,214
I'm a little bit conflicted right now,
that's all.

251
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,410
About what?

252
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,111
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.

253
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,245
Let's go. Try me.

254
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,380
I want to learn how you think
because I want to free my mind.

255
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,255
Let me try to explain it to you maybe
in terms that you would understand.

256
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,384
- Okay.
- This morning

257
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:55,091
I was meant to have
a business meeting with the Kevins.

258
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,827
And destiny. And now you're here

259
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,165
at this weird Hooters thing...

260
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,672
And so now I'm just trying
to figure out how to proceed.

261
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,608
What you just said
sounded like Yoda took acid

262
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,770
and stumbled into a business meeting.

263
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,178
You can make all the fun of Yoda
that you want,

264
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,307
Yoda would be fucking killer
in a business meeting.

265
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,285
Whatever, man. Come on!
Let's go. Get in the Porsche.

266
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,342
Shit!

267
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,623
Hey, I think your Porsche
got a ticket, Pat.

268
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,624
Shut up, Jeff. Just get in the car.

269
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,497
This Porsche is tiny.

270
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,058
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.

271
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,700
Are those workout gloves?

272
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,833
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...

273
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,875
Check this out. You see where those
cars are stopping up ahead?

274
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,969
Yeah.

275
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,242
I should probably stop
pretty soon, right?

276
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,676
Pat, slow down.

277
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,911
What? I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!

278
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,817
Hey, stop it, dude. This is not funny.

279
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,981
- Count to three and I'll stop.
- Pat, please stop.

280
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,151
Count of three! One! Two!

281
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,420
- Pat, look out!
- Three!

282
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,889
Curb! Curb!

283
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,986
Shit! Yes!

284
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,490
Will you please stop the car?

285
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,664
It handles better at high speeds!

286
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,168
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!

287
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,127
Tree! Tree!

288
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:20,906
Pat?

289
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,445
Fuck!

290
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,817
Wow. Yeah, that's real bad.

291
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,085
Oh, shit.

292
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,818
What the fuck?

293
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,485
He looks mad.

294
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,755
Are you on drugs?

295
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,319
How many beers have you had?

296
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,625
Shut up, Jeff. Shut up.

297
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,826
Did you not see that damn tree?

298
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,132
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.

299
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,799
I am fine, yes. Thank you for asking.

300
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,138
Burt, should we call an ambulance?

301
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,644
Hi. There was a pedestrian child

302
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,045
in the street
and in order to avoid killing it,

303
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,118
I had to swerve
and maneuver onto your sidewalk,

304
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,915
at which point I lost control
of my vehicle

305
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,478
and I've hit your tree here.

306
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,251
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?

307
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,384
No. Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.

308
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,723
Is he okay?

309
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,286
Yeah, he's fine. Just a little stunned.

310
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,492
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.

311
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,034
He's fine. He's okay.

312
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,501
That child's not moving.

313
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,938
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?

314
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,669
Yeah. Get out of the car.

315
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,638
Show her that you're fine.

316
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,307
See? Live and limber.

317
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,371
- Baby, are you sure you're all right?
- Look at that.

318
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,042
- I am fine, thank you.
- Look at that. Good as new.

319
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,108
You remind me of my grandson.

320
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,817
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?

321
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,554
Brian, why?

322
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,521
<i>No reason, ma'am.</i>

323
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,892
Do you think there's any way that you
and I can take care of this ourselves?

324
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,557
I really don't want to hang out here
all afternoon with the cops.

325
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,999
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.

326
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,729
It might have ruined the tree, baby.

327
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,465
Whoa. Is that Linda?

328
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,832
Give me 500 bucks,
and we'll call it even.

329
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,667
Excuse me?

330
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,369
No "excuse me," man.

331
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,743
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.

332
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,247
Might have to do some landscaping.

333
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,646
I'll probably have
to bring a tractor in here

334
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,910
and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.

335
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,110
It's a tree!

336
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:03,949
Have you been drinking?

337
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,415
No.

338
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,621
Why don't we just
let the police decide that. Call 911.

339
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,286
-$100.
- Times five.

340
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,025
-$150.
- Plus $350.

341
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,259
- Fine. Call the police.
- Call 911.

342
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,097
God damn it!

343
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,032
You take a check?

344
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,405
Yeah. No problem.

345
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,771
<i>Oh, good.</i>

346
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,508
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?

347
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,103
Trying to negotiate
with you about our tree.

348
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,876
He come in my yard, hit my tree.

349
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,009
You look at that tree
and he don't think he owes me.

350
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,144
Who's that guy she's with?

351
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,886
Get in the car, Jeff.

352
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,410
It was very, very quick
and it could have been somebody...

353
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,680
She was wearing a peach dress
that she wore this morning, okay?

354
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,414
And they got into our car!

355
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,058
Man, something really big
is happening here.

356
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:28,689
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!

357
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,857
We don't know that yet.

358
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,423
Let's follow this
and see where this leads.

359
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,992
Well, I'm trying to,
but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.

360
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,435
Go! Go! Go, go!

361
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,434
Hang on.

362
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,046
- I see them!
- Where?

363
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,845
They're just up here to the left!

364
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,785
There they are! Pat.

365
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,185
What the fuck are you doing?

366
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,616
You told me to hurry!

367
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,988
Tell me before you swerve
so I don't fall off the fucking car!

368
00:26:56,047 --> 00:27:00,189
Okay. Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?

369
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,464
They're turning up there!

370
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,557
What street?

371
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,463
South Clark! South Clark!

372
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,137
They're going to Cochon! Damn it!

373
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,510
Let me tell you about Cochon.

374
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,206
It's full of A-holes
who look down on everybody

375
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,374
that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.

376
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,579
Look at this, no parking.

377
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,949
I can wait with the car.

378
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,317
No. I got it.

379
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,488
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!

380
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,420
There's a fire hydrant right here.

381
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,323
I got it.

382
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,265
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

383
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,666
Come on. Let's go.

384
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,033
Okay, what we got here
is a friendly lunch.

385
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,509
It could be a coworker.

386
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,904
It could be a long-lost cousin.

387
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,414
She hates her coworkers
and I know her whole family.

388
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,381
We got to hear what they're saying.

389
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,217
Well, body language
can tell you a lot, man.

390
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,225
- You're going in there.
- What, me?

391
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,424
Yeah.

392
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,433
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.

393
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,095
Why don't you just go in there
and talk to her?

394
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,670
This could all be
a huge misunderstanding.

395
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,798
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.

396
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,038
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?

397
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,771
Oh, my God. You have no idea
how adult relationships work, do you?

398
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,574
You haven't had a girlfriend
since high school.

399
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,639
- So? So?
- So? So...

400
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,577
I need to find out
exactly what's going on

401
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,246
so I'll have the upper hand later.

402
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,324
Do you still love Linda?

403
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,191
There's an empty booth next to them.

404
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,490
Okay?

405
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,691
Just sneak in with my phone.

406
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,324
Here's a little grease money.

407
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,268
Okay. Get in there,
do what you got to do.

408
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,947
- Hello.
- Hi.

409
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,418
- How do you do? Lovely.
- Fine, thank you.

410
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:05,819
Can I help you?

411
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,322
Table for one, please.

412
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,753
- Right this way.
- Great. Thank you.

413
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,522
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?

414
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,258
Could I sit there?

415
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,963
Those tables are saved for two patrons.

416
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,161
- Right.
- Right this way.

417
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,932
Miss? You know what? Excuse me.

418
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,565
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.

419
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,075
You said table of one.

420
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,444
I meant that more like
in the bistro sense,

421
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,947
like one plus another one?

422
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,780
Well, just in case, I think this table back
here would be quite lovely for you guys.

423
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,086
What if I grease you?

424
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,380
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

425
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,119
I have money.

426
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:47,027
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.

427
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:50,225
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.

428
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,094
But it's really important.

429
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,244
I mean, I honestly don't even feel
like he really likes me.

430
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,814
Well, that's his problem. I mean...

431
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,890
From where I stand,
there's plenty to like.

432
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:20,054
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.

433
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,390
Thank you.

434
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,022
It's such a treat.

435
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,395
I'm just being myself.

436
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,628
<i>Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.</i>

437
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,568
<i>If you can hear me,
give me a thumbs-up.</i>

438
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:33,198
Okay, now take the talking part
of the phone and hold it,

439
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,633
<i>but keep it low, don't let them see.</i>

440
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,907
I really don't think that
you want to hear this.

441
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,380
<i>Jeff, just do it! Okay?</i>

442
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,815
<i>Stop talking
so I can hear what's going on.</i>

443
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,922
I can't. Honestly,
I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.

444
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:51,324
'Cause my friends just don't like him.

445
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,794
I think a little bit's my fault,

446
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,456
'cause I would complain
a lot to them and...

447
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:00,567
For a really long time,
I've felt like he and I are...

448
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,029
I don't know...

449
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,165
<i>We got, like,
weirdly competitive with each other.</i>

450
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,403
<i>We just never communicate.</i>

451
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,375
He just never listens, ever.

452
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,510
Gosh.

453
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,007
I shouldn't even be talking about this

454
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:20,250
but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.

455
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,054
That's a long time.

456
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,789
And I think, kind of,
what's worse than that

457
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,888
<i>is that it's so awkward.</i>

458
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,824
<i>Well, having sex is one thing</i>

459
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,592
but making love
is something else, right?

460
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,196
What does that even mean?

461
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,401
Thank you, Steve.

462
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,274
I'm not used to being able
to talk so openly with someone

463
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:47,043
and have them listen,
and care what I'm saying and...

464
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,243
Hey!

465
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,308
Hey! Hey!

466
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,718
Wail!

467
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,322
Pat, what do you want
me to do now, huh?

468
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,986
Hello, my name is Rob. Can I start you
out with something to drink?

469
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,721
Some water.

470
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,956
Excuse me?

471
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,890
- I'll have water.
- I'm sorry?

472
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,627
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.

473
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,163
Absolutely.

474
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:10,895
Jeff?

475
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,007
Whoa! Hey.

476
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,567
- Wow!
- Hi.

477
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,771
What are you doing here?

478
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,645
I'm just... Lunching it up, you know?

479
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,651
Getting a little bistro action.

480
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,845
'Pp-

481
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,718
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?

482
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,917
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.

483
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,960
- This is Steve.
- Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.

484
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,858
- My friend Steve.
- Steve.

485
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,794
We were just gonna leave.

486
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,332
Did you still want me
to drop you off at your car?

487
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,594
Yep. Yeah.

488
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:44,997
So, I'm going to take him to his car,
and I'll see you later.

489
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,100
Hope so.

490
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,610
Nice meeting you, Jeff.

491
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,783
Pat, they're coming out...

492
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,347
What the fuck?

493
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,153
Jeff! They went that way!

494
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,594
Pat! Well, then, let's go get the car!

495
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,029
- No car!
- What?

496
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,498
No car! Help me get a cab!

497
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,125
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?

498
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,431
Nothing! It got towed.

499
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,602
- That's not funny!
- I'm not...

500
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,972
- I know. I know it's not.
- It's so not funny!

501
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,442
Help me get a cab!

502
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,911
- There's no way to know where they are.
- Great.

503
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,340
What do we do?

504
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,348
I think we should just
sit down right here.

505
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,348
- And?
- And wait.

506
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,685
- For what?
- For a sign.

507
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,022
I'm not gonna sit here
and wait for a fucking sign!

508
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,617
Okay, well, then let's walk!

509
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,289
A school bus just drove by! It's a sign!

510
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,626
What does it mean?

511
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,291
Do we go to a school?

512
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,302
Is my wife fucking some guy
in a janitor closet?

513
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,895
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.

514
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,840
- That's not it.
- Good guess.

515
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,041
Now what?

516
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,640
What are you doing?

517
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,377
I'm looking for a credit card slip.

518
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,313
I don't see why.

519
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,047
If I find the slip, I get his last name

520
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,453
and then we can look up
where he lives and go beat him up.

521
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,685
No, I get it. I just don't think
they throw those things away.

522
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,784
Just shut up and help.

523
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,658
Find it yet?

524
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,498
- How about now?
- That's not helping!

525
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,296
I think we've gotten
off track somewhere.

526
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,998
Like I've gotten off track.

527
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,270
Something feels wrong.

528
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,207
Fine. I'll do it myself,

529
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,678
if it'll make you stop talking.

530
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,880
- Is that it?
- No.

531
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,109
It's not.

532
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,911
Oh, God.

533
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,145
What is that?

534
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,416
No, don't do it, Pat.

535
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,257
You don't have to smell it.

536
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,690
Pat. Okay.

537
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,760
- Hey.
- Hey, Carol.

538
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,227
That was yummy.

539
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,562
What're you doing?

540
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,405
Don't tell anybody else.

541
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,434
What?

542
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,173
Somebody's messing with me.

543
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,073
- Really?
- Yeah, in this office.

544
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,946
- No.
- Yeah. I got hit by a plane.

545
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,013
- What?
- A little paper plane came into my...

546
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,359
And all these messages
were coming to me on my computer.

547
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,789
Kind of...

548
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,453
- Flirty stuff.
- Flirty?

549
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,930
I know someone's playin'
some kind of a joke

550
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,159
and I think it's those guys

551
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,600
that are in the back over there
that did the fantasy football.

552
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,193
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.

553
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,263
That would be so good.
They're young, too.

554
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,307
Do you think it's Henry?

555
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,642
- Henry?
- Yeah.

556
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,304
He's kind of...

557
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,376
Interesting.

558
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,118
He's married, isn't he?

559
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,120
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.

560
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,589
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?

561
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,320
Well, somethin' about, you know...

562
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,489
What?

563
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,594
That they're a secret admirer.

564
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,826
They said they were...

565
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,659
I think that's kind of hot.

566
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,398
No, it's not. It's ridiculous.

567
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,940
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.

568
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,236
How do you know it's a joke?

569
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,744
I mean, how many times do we get
to get juiced up like this?

570
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,507
This is awesome.

571
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,640
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.

572
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:17,618
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly. I want attention.

573
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,348
You're impossible.

574
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,485
When was the last time
you had a relationship?

575
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,652
Well, my husband, of course.

576
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,921
No way.

577
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,792
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.

578
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,729
Come on. I've been to the movies.

579
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,165
- It's no wonder you're so cranky.
- I've been bowling...

580
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,225
- I'm not...
- Yeah, you need to get busy.

581
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,067
- You need to get your pipes cleaned.
- You think I'm...

582
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,107
You need to get f... Yeah.

583
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,542
Well, I won't tell anyone. Pinky swear.

584
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,278
What else? What else?

585
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,280
I did hear her say that
she felt neglected.

586
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,423
Sounds like they're banging already.

587
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,494
It's possible.

588
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,055
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.

589
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,431
Really? I think it would
be kind of awesome.

590
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,992
Well, it's not.

591
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,029
Okay.

592
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,672
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

593
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,902
Okay.

594
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,911
I'm sick of walking.

595
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,572
Okay.

596
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,946
Is that what I think it is?

597
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,599
You know, I've been havin' this really
weird dream about Dad lately.

598
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,966
- Really?
- Yeah.

599
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,135
He's a teacher.

600
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,974
And...

601
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,844
We're in this classroom
with a whole bunch of kids,

602
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,474
and we all sit down.

603
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,950
And Dad asks everyone,

604
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,386
"What's the greatest day
in the history of the world?"

605
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,417
And one kid is like, "Christmas."

606
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,824
And Dad's like, "No."

607
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,027
And whenever they get
the answer wrong,

608
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,119
they have to leave the room.

609
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:13,333
And eventually it's just me and Dad.

610
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,304
And he looks at me and says,

611
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,567
"Pat, what's the greatest day
in the history of the world?"

612
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,404
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.

613
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,102
And I'm like, "Dad, I don't know."

614
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,168
And he just looks at me
and he smiles and he says...

615
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,239
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."

616
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,343
How'd you know that?

617
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,853
He says, "Today is the greatest day
in the history of the world."

618
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,913
Yeah.

619
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,150
I have that dream, Pat.

620
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,660
Except in mine, it's me,
you and Dad in his car.

621
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,956
Okay.

622
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,702
I guess it's just something he said
to us when we were kids or somethin'.

623
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,872
It's like floatin' around
in both of our brains.

624
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,879
What is wrong with you?

625
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,612
- Pat.
- What? What?

626
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,679
What is wrong with you?

627
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,521
Why do you want to be like this?

628
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,023
- What are you talking about?
- We had... We were havin'...

629
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,454
We're having the same dream!

630
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,565
What the fuck are you talking about?

631
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:19,896
Why do you want to live like this?

632
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:25,404
You're drifting through this life with
no awareness of how special this is.

633
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,137
You want to talk about what's
happening right now, right here?

634
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,243
What's happening right now

635
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,645
is that I'm getting lectured
by my pothead brother

636
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,115
who lives in our <i>mom's</i> basement
at 30 years old

637
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,947
about how I don't
understand the universe!

638
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,453
Hey, here's some understanding for you.

639
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,617
A job and a car
and a wife and an apartment!

640
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,321
I got to go.

641
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,522
What?

642
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,587
- I have to go, Pat.
- Where are you going?

643
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,929
You know what? You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.

644
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,063
Jesus Christ.

645
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,627
You see a fucking truck

646
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,331
with the word "Kevin" on it
and you have to run after it?

647
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,931
Yeah. I do.

648
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,737
I wish I was that stupid!

649
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,842
You're a dick!

650
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,577
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.

651
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,740
It breaks my heart.

652
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,511
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

653
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,677
- You call me an asshole?
- Yeah, you are an asshole!

654
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,743
You fucking piece of shit!

655
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,153
You drive a fucking Boxster!

656
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,349
Fuck you!

657
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:17,916
Don't do this, Pat!

658
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,427
Fuck you!

659
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,121
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!

660
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,357
Fucking idiot!

661
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,369
You and Mom will never understand me.

662
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,534
And you're all I have left!

663
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,628
Another Jack and Coke?

664
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,599
Nope.

665
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,964
Got to get home.

666
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,372
Old lady, huh?

667
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,469
No, she's boning another dude.

668
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,209
Right on.

669
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,406
Stop the car. Stop. Please, stop?

670
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,382
- Hi.
- Hello.

671
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,959
Hey, so, my sister and her husband
just got here a little while ago

672
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:11,056
in that red Camry out there. And...

673
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,493
I need to... I'm meeting them. So...

674
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,004
- Okay...
- Actually,

675
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,268
it's an emergency.

676
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,537
I have to get her medication,
like, right now,

677
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,634
so what's her room number?

678
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,279
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.

679
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,477
I know it's like policy and everything,
but this is a family emergency,

680
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,019
so maybe you could just
give me the room number...

681
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,281
It'll take me a second to call.

682
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,380
I lied. It's not an emergency.

683
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:37,651
It's not a health emergency.

684
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,956
It is a financial emergency.

685
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,531
Their home is about to be foreclosed on

686
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:49,162
and I need to make a payment.

687
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,343
- Just stop.
- Okay.

688
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,145
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Right.

689
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,287
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?

690
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,262
No, just thank you so much.

691
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,593
Pat! Pat!

692
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:56,761
Oh, my God. Jeff.

693
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,306
- Oh, my God, Pat.
- What the fuck?

694
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,534
I was on the truck.

695
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,633
The truck came here
and now you're here.

696
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,474
- This shit is aligned!
- Shut the fuck up.

697
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,105
- What?
- Linda is here,

698
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,615
in this hotel somewhere.

699
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,284
- With the guy?
- Yeah, probably with the guy.

700
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,586
Sorry.

701
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,283
How the fuck did you find me?

702
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,587
It was the candy man.

703
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,126
Oh, shit.

704
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,634
He's right there.

705
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,192
Okay, what should we do?

706
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,968
Duck in there.

707
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,062
I'm gigantic!

708
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,954
Come on, let's go.

709
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:40,797
What do you want to do?

710
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,139


711
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:44,173
Should we stay? Should we wait?

712
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,442
Do we just wait, or...

713
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,013
We could wait.

714
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,609
I don't know. I don't...

715
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,446
Should I call her?

716
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,185
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.

717
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,091
And then, like, act innocent
and be like, "What's going on?"

718
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,722
You could try that.

719
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,129
You know, you're not
fucking helping at all.

720
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,533
You're just like,
"Do you want to do that?"

721
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,397
Do you want to know
what I think you should do?

722
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:10,563
Yeah.

723
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:11,867
I think you should take
a few deep breaths,

724
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,931
close your eyes,

725
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,374
and focus.

726
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:20,975
That is like stupid fucking
Jeff mumbo-jumbo.

727
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:25,520
If you have any other idea, even one,

728
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,783
I'll be happy to try it
without making fun of you.

729
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,484
Okay, all right.

730
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,286
Okay. Close your eyes.

731
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,068
What do you see?

732
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,540
I just can't stop picturing
what's going on.

733
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:50,236
What if she's, like,
giving him a hand job?

734
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,980
You know, I think they're adults.

735
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,277
It's probably unlikely
she's giving him a hand job.

736
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,515
I'm gonna break down the door.

737
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,883
No. Pat.

738
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,183
I'm gonna break it down.

739
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,851
Listen. Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.

740
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,259
I've seen you try to do things physically.

741
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,761
I'll do it.

742
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,632
Do you think you can do that?

743
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,861
I wish I could get
some sort of running start.

744
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,632
You totally can. There's, like, hallways.

745
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:17,933
You run and turn.

746
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,997
Parallel isn't gonna help me.

747
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,236
You could run
and turn right at the last second.

748
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,007
I wouldn't... No. That's not gonna work.

749
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,439
All right.

750
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,313
One,

751
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,512
two,

752
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,483
three!

753
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,185
Fuck!

754
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,624
- Run!
- What was that?

755
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,286
- Are you okay?
- Fuck!

756
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,692
Get up!

757
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,197
- Linda!
- Pat! What are you...

758
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,096
- Pat, don't... Pat, stop!
- What's going on?

759
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,691
- Steve, let him go!
- Either you're gonna calm down...

760
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,361
- Let him go! Jeff!
- Don't fucking move!

761
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,029
- What are you doing?
- What the hell is going on?

762
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,902
- We just got here!
- Who are you people?

763
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,306
You, shut up! Who the fuck is this guy?

764
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,638
He's just a friend, okay? Calm down.

765
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,508
- There's wine!
- Yeah!

766
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:01,140
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?

767
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,376
- That's a...
- A sex board?

768
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,975
No, you bring it with the... Pat!

769
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,578
And your face is flushed,
which means you're horny.

770
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,987
- No!
- What the fuck is going on?

771
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,322
Stop yelling and I'll answer
all of your questions.

772
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,726
Excuse me! Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.

773
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,196
Linda, I think you should come with me.

774
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,665
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!

775
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,895
I think that you should go
and I'll call you later.

776
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,198
You're not calling this fucking guy.

777
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,397
Linda, do you want me to stay?

778
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,872
- I think you should go.
- You should go! You need to go!

779
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,737
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?

780
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,778
Time for you to go, man.

781
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,771
- Get out, bro!
- All right, Pat.

782
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,075
Get out!

783
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:38,217
Okay. Start talking.
ls there anyone else in here?

784
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:45,256
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,

785
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,158
-and I think that it's understandable!
- I understand that.

786
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:50,892
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?

787
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,365
- Okay. What?
- Okay.

788
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,763
Are you mad because you came in here
and you found me with another man?

789
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,165
Yes.

790
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,541
- Yes.
- Or...

791
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,480
Or are you mad because
you're afraid that you might lose me?

792
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,311
What? There's like a part B now?

793
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:09,881
Please, don't do that.

794
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,283
It's just semantic bullshit!

795
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,945
- No, it isn't! It isn't!
- Yeah, it is!

796
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,489
- You really don't know the difference.
- You know what?

797
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:15,989
Because if you don't understand
the difference...

798
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,323
Linda! Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you

799
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,886
blabber about whatever this is.

800
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,098
And I'm gonna try to understand
your incoherent babble. Go.

801
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,362
- Why do you always do that?
- What?

802
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,602
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not.

803
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,002
Yeah, I'm trying.

804
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,538
You always just make me feel so stupid!

805
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,540
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...

806
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,803
You make fun of everything I say.

807
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,875
I'm really just trying to have
a conversation with you right now.

808
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,181
This is why our relationship
is so fucked.

809
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,222
Because you know what?
When I asked you

810
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,693
if you would take me to Cochon

811
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,490
you laughed at me.

812
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,695
Who care... I'm sorry. That's...

813
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:02,032
But when I asked Steve,
he just, you know, said, let's go.

814
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,763
Yeah, 'cause he wanted
to get in your pants!

815
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:07,908
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying
to put in some time and effort!

816
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,710
Let me tell you
something about Cochon.

817
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,010
- Cochon is full of assholes...
- You're not even...

818
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,518
...and snobs in fucking turquoise

819
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,578
tailored shirts and pink ties,
like that asshole!

820
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,481
You want to ask me to take you there?

821
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:25,117
Fine. I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...

822
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,526
- Yeah.
- God, you're not even listening to me.

823
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,029
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.

824
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,929
You're not! It's not about the restaurant.

825
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:34,161
I just want you to, like,
care that I want to go there!

826
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,602
And do you think it's about this guy?

827
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,664
Because I really don't even
fucking care about him! He's nice.

828
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,765
- He listens to me.
- I'm nice.

829
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,876
But you and I, we are petty,

830
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,039
we are passive-aggressive
with each other,

831
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,050
we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!

832
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:53,685
And what I think, honestly,
is that we have no house,

833
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,916
we have no kids, thank God!

834
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,925
It would be really fucking easy
for us to just walk away!

835
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,484
It'd be super simple.

836
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,188
And that is what I think
that we should do.

837
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:08,900
Hang on, hang on.

838
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,271
You know, let's just not,
like, let's just not...

839
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,006
Can we not talk about this anymore?

840
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,605
Let's just go home
and sleep on it, and, like...

841
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:23,773
And like...

842
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,251
Forget it.

843
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,115
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.

844
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,267
Bye, Jeff.

845
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,002
<i>Jeffrey, where are you?</i>

846
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,975
I asked you to call me
after you got the wood glue.

847
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,705
I'm at the office.

848
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,509
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks. Bye.

849
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,376
Oh, please.

850
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,762
It sure is a noisy little thing.

851
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,132
Yeah.

852
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,867
- Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
- Really?

853
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:00,874
You're kidding me. Blow out my biceps

854
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,740
trying to lift these cups that many times.

855
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,380
- I'm Barry.
- Sharon.

856
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,545
Nice to meet you.

857
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:13,952
Same here.

858
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,216
What am I saying?

859
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,451
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.

860
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,493
I really do like flowers.

861
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,667
Yeah?

862
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,134
Like.

863
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,578
Metaphorically, too.

864
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,979
Symbolically. All kinds.

865
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,348
Gardenias are my favorite.

866
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,316
I'm not following you.

867
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,866
Excuse me.

868
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,334
It was nice meeting you.

869
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,881
Just stupid.

870
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:28,921
Sharon?

871
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,130
What's going on?

872
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,436
I think it's over.

873
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,514
<i>What happened?</i>

874
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,811
What?

875
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:28,947
This is not the way I imagined
my life was gonna be.

876
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,889
How did you imagine it?

877
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:38,631
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps
and all that crap, you know,

878
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:42,500
with some guy in an exotic place,

879
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,405
all worldly and giving and shit,

880
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,237
and living in a little hut,

881
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,242
and taking care of cute little kids

882
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:58,912
and kissing under waterfalls
and stuff, you know.

883
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:03,149
You can still kiss under waterfalls
and stuff like that.

884
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,925
It's like,

885
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,094
how many good years do I have left?

886
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,062
I hate my kids right now.

887
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,397
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.

888
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:18,770
I look at the pictures of them,
and our family...

889
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,067
Don't cry.

890
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:23,172
Have some more tissue.

891
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,884
- Don't explain. Oh, God.
- No. I just...

892
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:36,754
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse. Don't explain.

893
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,019
But it's not what you think!

894
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,116
Yeah, it is.

895
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,496
I wish that I could

896
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,306
see the world like you.

897
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,506
Really?

898
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:05,809
I don't know. You have this, like,
belief in this cosmic order.

899
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,652
I really envy that.

900
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,754
You don't want to be like me.

901
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:21,325
<i>I'm not happy</i>

902
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:23,861
at all.

903
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,272
You know, since Dad died,
I've had this...

904
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,439
Had this feeling
that it had to be for a reason.

905
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:39,510
I keep thinking that
the signs are all about me, but maybe...

906
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,751
Maybe they're about you
and your marriage.

907
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:48,693
My marriage is not good.

908
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,526
It

909
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,693
is a

910
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,367
disaster.

911
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,074
I just want to feel

912
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,368
like I love Linda.

913
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:10,507
And I want to feel like she loves me.

914
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:18,389
And we both want to, like, be in love.

915
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:26,728
I miss it and I want it so bad.

916
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,568
I think you should just say that.

917
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,407
To her.

918
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,912
It's not that simple, Jeff.

919
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,709
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.

920
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:50,250
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched
if Linda walked in here right now

921
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:52,959
and sat down in this tub
next to you and said,

922
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:56,020
"Pat, I want to be
in love with you again"?

923
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,297
That would be awesome.

924
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,010
Dude, you need to say that to her.

925
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:11,671
You need to tell her that right now.

926
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,463
- River Parish.
- I am so sorry.

927
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,230
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.

928
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,066
- But! want to.
- It's okay.

929
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,869
<i>No, I just... It was so weird
and didn't come out the way I...</i>

930
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,467
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.

931
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,137
<i>But that's okay. I'm not gay, either.</i>

932
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,612
But you like women.

933
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:48,643
<i>So?</i>

934
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,145
Well, I like men.

935
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:55,412
<i>I like men, too. And to me,
it's like, at this point in my life,</i>

936
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:58,357
<i>whether it's a man or a woman,
it doesn't matter.</i>

937
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,519
<i>I want someone who gets me.</i>

938
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,856
<i>I</i> fee! like <i>I</i> deserve <i>that.</i>

939
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,467
<i>And! think you do, too.</i>

940
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,993
Well, it's important, yes.

941
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,500
But it doesn't mean

942
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:15,441
I want to sleep with everybody
that understands me. That's all.

943
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:18,104
<i>No, no, no. That's not my intention.</i>

944
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,443
<i>Isn't the most important thing</i>

945
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:24,678
<i>finding someone
who sees you exactly as you are?</i>

946
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:28,915
<i>Who gets the Peace Corps
and the kissing under waterfalls?</i>

947
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,355
Yeah.

948
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,867
So? Carol? Are you there?

949
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,095
Hello?

950
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,764
Shit.

951
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,276
Okay, sorry, everybody.

952
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,816
Just head for the exits! Single file!

953
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,193
Keep it orderly! Please!

954
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,393
Close your eyes.

955
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,482
It's clear. Come on.
There's my car, right here.

956
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,320
Where are we going? We're all wet.

957
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,621
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

958
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,457
I can't believe I'm doing this.

959
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:52,598
Let's go to the mall and get drinks
with the little umbrellas in them.

960
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,065
Bigger. Wilder.

961
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,903
I haven't been to New Orleans
in 20 years. How about that?

962
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:01,667
It's perfect.

963
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,067
Okay, let's go.

964
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,783
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.

965
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,667
Shit.

966
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:13,009


967
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,813
What is this?

968
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,844
It looks like really bad traffic.

969
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,082
Well, I mean in your, you know...

970
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,413
- You mean, like, is it a sign?
- I don't know.

971
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:25,818
It could be.

972
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:29,557
- It definitely could be.
- How do I know what to do?

973
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,989
That's the big question, yeah.

974
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:34,056
It's a constant struggle.

975
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:40,572
I think you got to go with your gut.

976
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,512
Well, I'm not going to stop now.

977
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:54,414
Right?

978
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,551
Hey. Pat?

979
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:00,617
If we don't get a chance
to reconnect today,

980
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,595
I'm, like, super proud of you.

981
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:28,982
Linda!

982
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:30,515
Linda!

983
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:33,653
Sorry.

984
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,091
- Second thoughts?
- Well, I just...

985
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,037
It's okay.

986
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,240
Pat?

987
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:53,974
Pat!

988
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,681
- I think that's my son.
- Sharon?

989
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:58,174
What now, my man?

990
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:03,186
I guess I'll go back.

991
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:05,322
We'll have to wait
for all this traffic to clear.

992
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,325
You all right?

993
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:12,997
Yeah, I'm fine.

994
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,632
I just...

995
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,768
You ever feel like you're waiting forever

996
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:21,365
to figure out what your destiny is,
and then when you do

997
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,738
it's not really that exciting?

998
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,249
Linda!

999
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:07,745
Pat?

1000
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,047
Pat!

1001
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:10,181
Linda!

1002
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,558
What are you doing here?

1003
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,021
I want to be in love again.

1004
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,289
What?

1005
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,060
Things have gotten way off track.

1006
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:24,835
And weird and shitty.

1007
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,773
And I'm a big part of that,
and I'm really sorry for it.

1008
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,036
- Pat!
- What?

1009
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,867
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?

1010
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,777
- Why are you running down...
- Mom?

1011
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,406
What's going... Oh, hi.

1012
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:37,644
- Wait, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

1013
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:38,741
How did you get here?

1014
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,684
In Carol's... This is Carol.

1015
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:41,983
Hi.

1016
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,148
I'm Linda. Nice to meet you.

1017
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,555
Jeff... Jeff's here?

1018
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,862
Whoa, hey! Did you see that?

1019
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,899
Is he okay? Is he okay?

1020
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:58,370
Yeah, we're here.

1021
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,805
A car just went off the bridge.

1022
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,604
There's people inside of it.

1023
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,180
Somebody jumped in!

1024
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:37,911
Wait! Our dad's still down there!

1025
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:38,968
Fuck.

1026
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,673
Come on.

1027
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,711
Help! Help us!

1028
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:44,841
Dad!

1029
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,314
Help!

1030
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,621
Come on, girls! Come on. Swim hard!

1031
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:52,284
Come on, honey! Give me your hand.
That a girl. Come on.

1032
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:58,354
- Get back there.
- Dad?

1033
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,226
Hey, the car's going down!

1034
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,032
The car's sinking!

1035
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,035
Dad!

1036
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:11,475
Dad!

1037
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,213
Jeff!

1038
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,712
Jeff!

1039
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,119
Dad!

1040
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,054
Come on, Dad!

1041
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,894
We need some help over here.

1042
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:49,847
Pat?

1043
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,677
Over here! Over here!

1044
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:55,413
Pat!

1045
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:58,716
Pat!

1046
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,093
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

1047
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:11,002
Help! Help!

1048
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:12,636
Man in the water!

1049
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,267
Help!

1050
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:19,140
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.

1051
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:20,544
Coming into the dive deck.

1052
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:21,971
Hurry!

1053
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,277
Get a hold of him!

1054
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,977
One, two, three!

1055
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,818
Jeff!

1056
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,823
We have an unresponsive person!

1057
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,225
He's not moving!

1058
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,525
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!

1059
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,429
- Jeff!
- Sir, we got to help him. We got him.

1060
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,490
Do something! Jesus!

1061
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:42,727
Sir, sir.

1062
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,895
Jeff!

1063
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,263
- He's not moving!
- Starting CPR!

1064
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:49,036
Get off me! Leave me alone!

1065
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,237
You need to sit down!

1066
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,804
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

1067
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:56,639
Jeff, wake up!

1068
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,926
- Jeff!
- Still not responding.

1069
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,829
Can you hear me?

1070
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:18,835
HEY. hey, you okay?

1071
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,430
Hey.

1072
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:21,668
Sir?

1073
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:24,106
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

1074
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,738
Let's get blankets!

1075
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,177
Sir, stay still.

1076
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,739
Let me sit up.

1077
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,416
What happened?

1078
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:40,191
Everything-

1079
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,694
I'm hungry-

1080
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,804
<i>And coming up next,</i>

1081
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,903
<i>the story of two girls, their father,</i>

1082
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:43,506
<i>and the man who was
in the right place at the right time.</i>

1083
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:46,849
<i>The car that was behind us
crashed into the back of us</i>

1084
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,684
<i>and then we went over the bridge.</i>

1085
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:50,984
<i>And then this man,</i>

1086
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:53,452
<i>he just came and broke our window...</i>

1087
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:56,519
<i>And he almost died doing it.</i>

1088
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:59,529
<i>If we had lost our dad,</i>

1089
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:03,931
<i>you know,
I just really can't even imagine it.</i>

1090
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,466
<i>We're just really thankful he was there.</i>

1091
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,531
<i>We'll be right back with that rescue tale</i>

1092
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:13,068
<i>of local councilman Kevin Landry
and his two little girls.</i>

1093
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:15,672
<i>All that and more when we come back.</i>
