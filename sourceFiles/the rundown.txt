1
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,582
I just love mushrooms.

2
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,651
One of my favorites,
or as I call it...

3
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,654
...the king of mushrooms,
is the porcini.

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,957
Now, stop right there.

5
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,633
Don't be alarmed.

6
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:41,761
There's a lot of confusion
in this country between porcini...

7
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:43,274
... the Italian name, and cpes,
which is the French name.

8
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:47,370
... the Italian name, and cepes,
which is the French name.

9
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:50,537
They're fat and they're earthy.

10
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:55,709
Now, the porcini is most often seen
dried here in this country.

11
00:00:56,153 --> 00:00:58,621
And they would always be labeled...

12
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:03,423
-...dried porcinis, not dried cepes.
-Beck!

13
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:07,325
-come on!
-They are very, very, very flavorful.

14
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:15,968
It's about time.
I've been waiting.

15
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,873
Man, you're Iucky to be getting in.
It's an extremely private party tonight.

16
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:25,882
-What's he drinking?
-Jagermeister and cristal.

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,280
Great.

18
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:39,694
-Security?
-No, but we do have a slight problem.

19
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,665
Have fun.

20
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:45,735
What's the problem?

21
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:49,705
That's your problem.

22
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:51,865
The guy on the Ieft
is Jalil Johnson.

23
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,671
-I think he's the Ieft tackle.
-Jamal Johnson.

24
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:56,540
Defensive end.

25
00:01:56,714 --> 00:02:00,445
The best defensive lineman Notre
Dame's produced in the last 20 years.

26
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:02,142
Maybe ever.

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,914
The guy on his Ieft
is Kambui Jackson.

28
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:09,389
He ran for 2000 yards last year,
All-Pro five years in a row.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,520
The guy in the headband,
that's Fernando Lewis.

30
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,460
Middle Iinebacker.

31
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:16,656
Plays a lot like Ray Lewis.

32
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:20,660
-He just hits harder.
-Whatever. I'm not into football.

33
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:24,068
The other two guys
are Jimmy coggeshell...

34
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,936
...and David Mulaire.

35
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:29,335
One's from USC.
The other one's from Ohio State.

36
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,242
Stay down, bitch!

37
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:34,350
The guy you're Iooking for is there.
Brian Knappmiller.

38
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:38,021
Throws like Brett Favre.

39
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,952
Bets like Pete Rose.

40
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:43,753
So I'm telling this cat, I'm Iike,
"Yo, I know it's you that jumped.

41
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:45,862
I saw you.
Don't tell me it's not you."

42
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,793
He's Iike, "I don't know."

43
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:50,660
-Excuse me.
-"Trust me. It's you, I know."

44
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,302
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you guys.

45
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,063
-I apologize. I need--
-My man.

46
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:58,764
I ain't got no hookups to tryout
camps. You just gotta show up.

47
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:00,376
I think you'II be all right.

48
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:02,637
So I'm telling the cat,
"I don't want--"

49
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:05,373
Excuse me. I'm not here
to talk about tryouts.

50
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,177
-If I could have a minute--
-I got it. Pass me that.

51
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,150
Who do I make this out to, man?

52
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:13,989
Who do I make it out to?
What's your name?

53
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:15,853
-Beck.
-Beck?

54
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,357
B-E-c-K.

55
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:19,929
-What's up?
-What's happening?

56
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:21,894
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

57
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,726
-AII right?
-Thank you.

58
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:27,097
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna come back, or what?

59
00:03:28,672 --> 00:03:30,606
Excuse me.

60
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:33,141
-I'm really--
-What are you doing, man?

61
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,110
A couple of months ago, you made
wagers with an associate of mine.

62
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,545
-Two, three months ago.
-What's up, Knappy?

63
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:42,481
-Nothing. It's good. Enjoy your drink.
-What's up?

64
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,054
Yo, bets? You embarrass me
in front of friends about bets?

65
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:50,591
I don't mean to embarrass you.
This is embarrassing to me.

66
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:54,162
-$50,000. You might remember.
-Yeah, I know what it is, man.

67
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:57,357
Listen, there's a G to get me started.
Now do me a favor.

68
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,036
Tell your man I'II see him Monday
with the rest...

69
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:04,674
...and not to send anybody else
to see me, all right?

70
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,315
Brian.

71
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:14,508
I'm gonna need some collateral
from you.

72
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:16,915
What?

73
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:19,813
I'm gonna need the ring.

74
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:31,132
-I'm sorry.
-You're--? Are you--?

75
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:34,104
SIip it under the table,
on the Iow-Iow.

76
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:36,796
-I'II make sure you get it back.
-On the Iow-Iow.

77
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:40,168
-I'II give it to you. Want a drink too?
-Thank you.

78
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,411
Take the ring.
That's what I think about that.

79
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:46,675
Get the hell on, man.
Go, man! Go!

80
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:49,251
-Do something with this.
-You heard the man.

81
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,045
Yo, man, get up!

82
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:54,719
Okay.

83
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:59,523
Yeah, that's right, playboy, walk.
Go on, man!

84
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:01,688
You wanna jump?

85
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,333
Get your ass out of here.

86
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:13,910
You all right?

87
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,804
This shit burns.

88
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:24,515
Hey, it's me.

89
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,486
Oh, yeah, he's here.
We got a problem, though.

90
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:33,153
He's got the entire offensive Iine.
The entire offensive Iine is here.

91
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:37,434
Let me do it another night.
How about that?

92
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:39,694
They've got a shot
at repeating this year.

93
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:42,702
I do not want to hurt them.
I don't want to go out--

94
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:47,133
Okay, Billy.

95
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:08,260
Knappmiller!
You got two choices.

96
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:10,660
Option A, you give me the ring.

97
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:13,632
Option B,
I make you give me the ring.

98
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:16,002
I'II take B.

99
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:18,773
Wrong choice.

100
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,161
Okay.

101
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:15,588
Yeah, put him down, man!

102
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:47,060
-Yo, what's with all this hostility?
-You should have taken option A.

103
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:40,540
Are you all right, mate?

104
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,253
Are you okay?

105
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,456
Thanks, mate.

106
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,698
-There he is.
-Why'd you send him, Billy?

107
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,571
Martin? Oh, he was just a backup.

108
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:11,010
After I got your call,
I wasn't so sure you could deliver.

109
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:13,240
-What happened?
-He stole it from me!

110
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:17,217
He got you
with those beanbags? No.

111
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,912
It is gonna be 1 0 off your vig,
anyway, you know.

112
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,355
Billy, you know I've got plans!
Stop nickel-and-diming me.

113
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,859
It's a tough business,
the restaurant business.

114
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,487
I hear 75 percent of them fail
the first year. Do you know why?

115
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,260
Undercapitalization, that's why.
I don't think--

116
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:36,838
Billy, I want out, I want a new Iife.
I want my money, and I want it now!

117
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:39,309
Now?

118
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:42,577
Now.

119
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:46,548
Okay.

120
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:54,253
One job.

121
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:57,086
One job, I wipe your slate clean...

122
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:01,755
...and you have your restaurant.

123
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,631
come on, open it up.

124
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,437
come on.

125
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:15,807
That's a photo
of Travis AIfred Walker.

126
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:19,278
Stanford dropout, treasure hunter.
Only to date...

127
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:22,509
...the only thing he's found
is trouble.

128
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,517
-Did you say, "Walker"?
-My son.

129
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:27,384
From my third marriage.
Lasted about three minutes.

130
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,950
That picture was taken
two months ago...

131
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:33,858
...in some gold-mining town called EI
Dorado in the middle of the Amazon.

132
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:35,396
-How much?
-250 Iarge.

133
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:38,033
For that much,
why not invite him back yourself?

134
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:41,035
-The boy doesn't trust me.
-Kidnapping's gonna help.

135
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,229
Is that sarcasm?

136
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:46,836
You wanna be sarcastic,
do it to your monkey friends!

137
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,878
You do not do it to me!
Do you understand?

138
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:55,913
I'm sorry, Billy.

139
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,784
You're goddamn right you are.

140
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:04,823
-What'd he do?
-Pissed off the wrong people.

141
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:09,221
I don't have to remind you
what happens when you do that, do I?

142
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:11,162
So I bought him some forgiveness.

143
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:13,893
But if I don't bring him back
to face the music...

144
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:17,232
...you know damn well
that I can't carry a tune.

145
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:22,276
So you deliver my boy back here,
you bring him right through that door...

146
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:27,748
...you walk out of this house
a free man, with a restaurant.

147
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,148
Is that duct tape?

148
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:12,118
Don't worry there, Iittle fella.
Walk by faith, not by sight.

149
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:20,496
Will you Iook at that?
We can't Iand now.

150
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:24,504
-Why? Why can't we Iand?
-They got the bulls on the ground.

151
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:27,670
"Booze on the grind"?

152
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:30,176
The bulls. On the ground.
cattle down there.

153
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:31,575
-cows?
-Yeah.

154
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:34,808
I'II give them a wee fright there.
Get moving! come on!

155
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:36,714
Out of me way!

156
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:39,355
Out the way, you!

157
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:41,683
Move it! Move it now!

158
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:47,657
Out my way!

159
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:50,790
Out me way!

160
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,985
AII right there, Iittle fella.
Okay, gotcha.

161
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,528
What did I tell you about the Iamp?
My needle was totally knackered.

162
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,995
Rpm's all over the shop.

163
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:28,337
-Is this the only road in and out?
-If you wanna stay alive.

164
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:31,633
-Why is that?
-There. That's the jungle, Iittle fella.

165
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:33,332
You got anacondas in there.

166
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,673
Poison arrow frogs, black flies,
bullet ants.

167
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:38,940
If they don't get you,
the rebels will.

168
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:41,710
-What?
-Rebels. That's what I'm telling you.

169
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:45,548
To them, cornelius Hatcher's
built a Babylon in paradise.

170
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:48,190
-Built a what?
-A Babylon.

171
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:57,330
Yeah, that mine is as close as a man
can come to the gates of hell...

172
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,495
...while his heart's still beating.

173
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:08,738
The Sunday school picnic is over,
I'II tell you that.

174
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:11,073
Stay out of the jungle,
Iittle fella, okay?

175
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:55,883
I found these flowers growing
in the deepest parts of the jungle.

176
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:59,392
I mean, as far as I can tell,
no one's ever identified them...

177
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:02,225
...which means I'm responsible
for naming them.

178
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:06,892
I can only think of one word
that fits something so beautiful.

179
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,403
Mariana.

180
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:15,377
How much do you want?

181
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:16,944
-What?
-How much?

182
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:19,844
I need your uncle's boat.
A day or two, max. Mariana--

183
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,382
You borrow my car,
bring it back with no windshield.

184
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:24,850
-My brother's scooter--
-That wasn't my fault.

185
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,955
Now you want to borrow
my uncle's boat?

186
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:30,457
"I found it, I found it." You'II never
find this Garbo of yours.

187
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:34,097
-It's "Gato," I told you.
-Gato.

188
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:38,257
It's out there, Mariana.
I know exactly where it is.

189
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:40,299
But I need that boat.

190
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,008
-How much?
-I told you, I--

191
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:47,837
No. How much is your Gato worth?

192
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:50,309
This is a very significant
academic find.

193
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,209
-How much?
-It's not about money.

194
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:55,010
-You Iie Iike a Iittle girl, Travis.
-I'm not Iying.

195
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,319
If I get the boat for you,
you have to take me with you.

196
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:01,684
Ridiculous.
We're talking about a boat.

197
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:05,294
-And we split the take 50-50.
-I've been doing all the work, okay?

198
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:09,159
-I found it. No way.
-50-50, Travis.

199
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:13,025
-70-30.
-50-50.

200
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:15,898
-60-40.
-50-50, and I get off work at 6.

201
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,165
Then we can go and get your Gato.

202
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,835
You're evil.

203
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,272
-Thank you.
-Whatever.

204
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,916
For the flowers.

205
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:53,808
Harvey! We're here
to see your brother.

206
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:55,802
Where's he from?

207
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:58,243
-He's an American.
-You got a gun?

208
00:16:58,415 --> 00:16:59,814
No, I don't Iike guns.

209
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:02,008
check him.

210
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:11,289
-What's the current payout?
-Give me a payout for Quadrant 3.

211
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,105
2425, down 20 percent.

212
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:46,223
Checked him?

213
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:48,125
AII right, Iet's go.

214
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,821
come on.

215
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,034
come on.

216
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:55,495
I never met an American
who didn't Iike guns.

217
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,847
Tell them to dig harder.

218
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:08,818
If only it were that simple,
eh, Mr. Beck?

219
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:12,515
-How do you know my name?
-When a man of your dimensions...

220
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:15,852
...travels all this way
to visit a place Iike this...

221
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,221
...it arouses the curiosity.

222
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:20,454
What can I do for you?

223
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,962
Do you know this man?

224
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,599
Travis Walker.

225
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,760
I Iet him excavate
around the mine...

226
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:29,962
...allow him to rent a room
in my town...

227
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:33,165
...all for a fair 60 percent
of anything he might unearth.

228
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,811
-Where can I find him?
-Follow the bullshit.

229
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:39,574
-Guy's mouth should be in the circus.
-Brother, please.

230
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,411
-Do you have business with him?
-I do.

231
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:44,815
What kind of business?
I Iove business.

232
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:46,819
-It's personal.
-So...

233
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,753
-...why come to me?
-When I'm a guest in a man's house...

234
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:53,862
...I don't reach into his refrigerator
without permission.

235
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,331
Refrigerator.

236
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,865
I want to show you something,
Mr. Beck, please.

237
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:10,106
Does that Iook Iike
a refrigerator to you?

238
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,182
Looks more Iike hell.

239
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:21,113
Where you see hell, I see
a spellbinding sense of purpose.

240
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:26,695
I see the value of keeping your eye
on the ball.

241
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:29,862
When a bride slips the ring
on her finger...

242
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:33,126
...when a businessman lays his hands
on a Rolex...

243
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:38,933
...when a rapper gets a shiny new
tooth, this is that cost, Mr. Beck.

244
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:43,910
My horror for their beauty.
My hell for their Iittle slice of heaven.

245
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:48,579
Somebody's gotta keep his eye
on the ball.

246
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,686
That somebody is me, Mr. Beck.

247
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:55,882
I am down here every day
keeping my eye on the ball.

248
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:58,357
That's just a simple fact of life.

249
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:02,225
And if you're bold enough
to face that cold, hard fact...

250
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,633
...you can make a Iot of money.

251
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:11,966
-What do you want with the kid?
-I've come to take him home.

252
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,942
That'II cost you $1 0,000.

253
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:21,649
-I need to borrow the jeep.
-Wait a minute, friend.

254
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:24,514
I'II give you $1 000.

255
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:27,614
I'II give you $1 000.

256
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,750
I need you to take my bag back to
the plane, keep the engine running.

257
00:20:31,928 --> 00:20:33,919
-can you do that?
-For $1 000?

258
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:37,089
-That's right.
-I'II find a way.

259
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:44,404
Declan. I'm gonna be coming fast.

260
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:09,361
American?

261
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,060
Yeah.

262
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:17,636
Where from?

263
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:20,469
Someplace that's got bartenders.

264
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:36,920
What can I get you?

265
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:42,727
I'II take a beer.

266
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,423
Nice flowers.

267
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:52,000
"The smiling fool."

268
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:58,212
Back in the States, Brazil nuts
Iike these go for $1 5 a pound.

269
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:02,480
Well, those fell off the tree
out back.

270
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:05,177
And around here,
we don't call them Brazil nuts.

271
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:08,552
-What do you call them?
-Well, we're in Brazil...

272
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:10,625
...so we just call them nuts.

273
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:15,094
-Fair enough.
-What brings you to the Amazon...

274
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,290
...other than the food and drink,
of course?

275
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,929
-I'm Iooking for a man.
-What's your type?

276
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:24,199
His name's Travis Walker.

277
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:28,742
Brown hair. He's in his 20s.
Wears a blue shirt, jeans.

278
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:31,972
Right now he's got a real
bewildered Iook on his face.

279
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:34,616
-Do I know you?
-Name's Beck.

280
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:38,784
-What can I do for you?
-I need you to make a choice for me.

281
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:40,547
A choice?

282
00:22:40,723 --> 00:22:43,248
-Option A or option B.
-What's option A?

283
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:46,259
Option A is, you and I
walk out of here nice and easy...

284
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:48,420
...and drive back to the airstrip.

285
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:51,998
And then we begin our Iong journey
back to Los Angeles.

286
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:55,103
There'II be no blood,
no broken bones...

287
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:58,271
...and no problems.

288
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:01,535
-What's in Los Angeles?
-Your father.

289
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:10,208
-What's option B?
-Pretty much the opposite of A.

290
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:14,156
But I wouldn't recommend that one.

291
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:16,952
I'II take option c.

292
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:20,720
Travis, there is no option c.

293
00:23:20,897 --> 00:23:22,387
Really?

294
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:26,261
Are you sure?

295
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:31,730
I mean, big boy,
there's always an option c.

296
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:40,477
So angry!

297
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:42,141
-Shut up.
-Shut up!

298
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:47,222
Like I said,
there is no option c.

299
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:55,759
-Let me introduce you to option c.
-Mr. Beck...

300
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,904
...there's been a slight change
in the narrative.

301
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:05,803
-An unexpected twist, you might say.
-can I have a beer, please?

302
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:10,372
Mr. Hatcher, I was just gonna
come find you when this--

303
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:12,777
The kid stays.

304
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,747
-I paid you.
-Well, fortunately...

305
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:17,045
...I had my fingers crossed
the whole time.

306
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:19,451
Apparently, young Mr. Walker...

307
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:21,887
...may have stumbled
onto a trinket of value.

308
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:25,927
And as he's Iocated it
in my jungle...

309
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,228
...I'm gonna need him
to Iead me to it.

310
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:38,668
Okay, so Iet's go, dickhead.

311
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:41,011
Don't call me a dickhead,
you dickhead.

312
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:43,806
-Did you find it or not, asshole?
-What, asshole?

313
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:45,972
-Did you find it or not?
-What's that?

314
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,641
-Did you find it or not, asshole?
-Don't!

315
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,719
Hey, don't rock the boat.

316
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:56,959
Okay.

317
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:01,730
-I don't want any trouble.
-Leave now. Don't come back.

318
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:04,765
-And the 1 0,000?
-consider it tax deductible.

319
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:07,870
A contribution
to your personal health fund.

320
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:10,438
With all due respect, Mr. Hatcher...

321
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:13,268
-...I'm feeling pretty healthy.
-Oh, yeah?

322
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:14,741
Walk.

323
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,914
Don't make waves.

324
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:58,885
You're gonna kill us all, Mr. Beck?

325
00:26:14,077 --> 00:26:15,510
I tried to be reasonable.

326
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:19,610
That's not the way to do business.

327
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,754
You should've kept the gun.

328
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:48,273
You're dead already.
You just don't know it yet.

329
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:49,112
This is option B?
Are you kidding me?

330
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:51,478
This is option B?
Are you kidding me?

331
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:52,945
Quiet.

332
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:55,311
You're dead. You're so dead.

333
00:26:57,453 --> 00:27:00,581
We won't get out of here.
AII this Iand, Hatcher owns it.

334
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:03,385
The road, the air,
Hatcher owns it all.

335
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,790
-Shut up.
-Whatever my dad is paying you...

336
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:07,293
-...I will double it.
-No.

337
00:27:07,463 --> 00:27:08,794
-I'II quadruple it.
-No.

338
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:10,556
-Double it and quadruple it.
-No.

339
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,064
You're being unreasonable!

340
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:17,871
-I'II give you a chance to reconsider.
-You get one more chance to shut up.

341
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,373
Is that your final answer?

342
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:25,710
For what it's worth,
I hope you enjoy the fall.

343
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:27,509
-Yeah, what fall?
-This fall.

344
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:02,575
come on, big boy,
where's the frigging keys?

345
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,140
AII right.

346
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,586
Travis?

347
00:29:21,164 --> 00:29:22,392
Good God!

348
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:27,167
Travis!

349
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:35,000
-I'm not going back.
-Oh, you're going back.

350
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:36,509
No way.

351
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,479
-Right now.
-Who the hell do you think you are?

352
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,950
You come into my town,
mess up my bar...

353
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:47,851
-...and you eyeball my woman?
-Eyeball your woman?

354
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:49,886
It's on.

355
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:53,820
What's this?

356
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:56,830
Who is this? Is he your friend?
Do you know him?

357
00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:59,331
Do you? Say hello.

358
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:02,232
Say hello. Say hello.

359
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,445
Are you finished?
Let's go.

360
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,442
Big boy, you Iike thunderstorms?

361
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:19,512
Bet you do, right?

362
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:22,222
-Little thunder?
-Stop it.

363
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:23,620
-Little Iightning?
-Stop!

364
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:26,193
Thunder? Lightning?
Thunder? Lightning? Ears--

365
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:30,728
You done beating me up?
Let's go.

366
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:32,761
-I'm tired of this.
-You win.

367
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,203
come on! Go to sleep.

368
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:42,276
Go to sleep. Night-night.

369
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:46,004
Night-night. Go to sleep now!
come on!

370
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:56,687
Obviously, we got off
on the wrong foot here.

371
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:00,056
So I'm gonna be completely
candid with you.

372
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:02,729
Have you ever heard
of the Gato do Diabo?

373
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:05,901
-The Devil's cat?
-You're gonna stop speaking now.

374
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:07,433
AII right. It's--

375
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:10,939
It's a priceless object, man.

376
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:14,342
Forged out of pure gold.

377
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,375
-Worth millions.
-You said priceless.

378
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:19,481
You do not want to argue semantics
with a Ph.D. candidate.

379
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:21,139
-Ph.D.?
-Yeah.

380
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:25,476
I am really very close
to being Dr. Travis Walker.

381
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:28,920
You dropped out of Stanford
after two semesters, Einstein.

382
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:32,353
So I'm fairly close.
closer than you.

383
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:34,689
close to getting your ass
kicked again.

384
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:37,799
Wait, wait, wait!
The Gato is real, all right?

385
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:39,434
I know where to find it.

386
00:31:39,635 --> 00:31:41,796
-I'II split it with you, 80-20.
-Move!

387
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:44,171
70-30?

388
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:48,842
You're a very unpleasant individual,
you know that?

389
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:16,298
You think they're dead?

390
00:32:16,472 --> 00:32:18,838
What am I, psychic?

391
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:21,841
I'm gonna cut that kid's nose off.

392
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:26,511
No, Harvey.

393
00:32:26,682 --> 00:32:29,310
You want the Gato
because if the bad guys get it...

394
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:31,510
...they won't need us anymore.

395
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:35,316
There'II be no one to work the mine.
You want to work the mine?

396
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:47,661
There are two men in that jungle
who are trying to steal from me.

397
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,863
I feel Iike a Iittle boy
who's Iost his first tooth...

398
00:32:52,074 --> 00:32:56,602
...put it under his pillow,
waiting for the tooth fairy to come.

399
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:01,773
Only, two evil burglars
have crept in my window...

400
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:05,546
...and snatched it
before she could get here.

401
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:13,286
Wait a second. Do you understand
the concept of the tooth fairy?

402
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,159
Explain it to them.

403
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:24,566
You find a tooth,
you put it under your pillow.

404
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:27,734
The fairy comes...

405
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:30,245
...waiting for the tooth.

406
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:34,275
Wait. She takes the goddamn thing,
gives you a quarter!

407
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,384
They got my tooth!

408
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:38,853
I want it back.

409
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:57,728
I have to ask you,
back at the bar, man. That was crazy!

410
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,737
No guns. Strip, toss, toss, strip.

411
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:02,844
-Didn't I tell you to be quiet?
-I know, but what is that?

412
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:07,449
Some kind of nouveau samurai code?
You got a problem with guns?

413
00:34:07,617 --> 00:34:09,949
They take me to a place
I don't wanna go.

414
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,381
Where do they take you?

415
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,785
To a place you
don't wanna see me go. Walk!

416
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:19,219
How often do you work out?

417
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:25,965
Let me get this straight.

418
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:27,898
-You never use guns?
-No.

419
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,867
-Never?
-Never.

420
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:32,098
What if your best friend
was gonna die?

421
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:33,537
No guns.

422
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:35,802
Santa would do it
to save his best friend.

423
00:34:35,978 --> 00:34:37,343
Do I Iook Iike Santa claus?

424
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:40,281
-Do I Iook Iike Santa claus to you?
-What is it?

425
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,475
Guns make you um pouco louco?
Bang-bang crazy?

426
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:46,315
I pick up guns, bad things happen.
I don't Iike that.

427
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,515
-What kind of things?
-Very bad things, Travis. Walk.

428
00:34:50,526 --> 00:34:52,926
-What about knives?
-Move!

429
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:55,622
My father doesn't share
the same distaste.

430
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:58,823
-He's your father. He won't kill you.
-AII he cares about...

431
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:02,300
...is what's good for business.
Now, the question is, Mr. Beck...

432
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,371
...what's good for your business?

433
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,403
You don't Iike money?

434
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:09,467
I don't make deals
with people Iike you.

435
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:14,012
-You don't even know me.
-You're Iike every jackass I take down.

436
00:35:14,183 --> 00:35:17,516
First they try to run, then fight,
then they try to negotiate.

437
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:21,748
When that fails, they do what you're
about to do when you realize it's over.

438
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:23,585
Oh, yeah? What's that?

439
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:27,286
You're gonna get down on your hands
and knees and beg me for a break.

440
00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:30,261
Well, guess what.
I don't give breaks.

441
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,861
No breaks.

442
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:34,932
You don't understand the situation.

443
00:35:35,104 --> 00:35:37,072
You borrowed money
from the wrong guy.

444
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:41,369
You slept with the wrong guy's wife.
I don't care.

445
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:43,736
Your mistake.

446
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:48,081
What about you, Mr. Beck?
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

447
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:52,013
I know! Move.

448
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,553
No breaks. That's Iame.

449
00:35:57,727 --> 00:36:01,163
No breaks!
No, I don't give breaks.

450
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:04,231
Santa claus doesn't give
any breaks.

451
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:26,913
-Should've been at the airstrip by now.
-Like I'm gonna help.

452
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:28,920
I didn't ask for your help.

453
00:36:32,962 --> 00:36:35,362
-What are you doing?
-I have to pee.

454
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,362
-Pee in your pants. Move.
-No.

455
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:41,203
I've Iet you push me around
this jungle for, Iike, five hours.

456
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:45,238
You've been very aggressive, and I'm
not moving until you Iet me pee.

457
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:49,037
If you wanna keep going, you'II have
to carry me. I'II pee on your head.

458
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:51,907
You threatening me?
You threatening me with pee?

459
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:54,447
Well, yeah,
if you don't Iet me pee here.

460
00:36:55,718 --> 00:36:57,845
Fine. You win.

461
00:36:58,087 --> 00:36:59,645
Pee.

462
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:01,750
-Will you unzip me?
-No, I won't.

463
00:37:01,924 --> 00:37:05,360
-You wanna pee, you got 30 seconds.
-How can with I my hands cuffed?

464
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:06,893
Find a way. Pee.

465
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:09,155
come on.

466
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:11,333
Don't make it weird.

467
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:17,100
PIease?

468
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:22,402
Don't breathe, don't say a word.

469
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,810
Don't even Iook at me.
Look over there.

470
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:36,619
Thanks, man.

471
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:43,465
Oh, shit.

472
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:50,969
I can't get it out!

473
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,506
-could you just help--?
-No. Hell, no.

474
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:06,978
come on! Son of a--!

475
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:09,615
come on, come on!

476
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:13,319
come on! Oh, hey. Hey, I got it.

477
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:16,431
congratulations.
You got 30 seconds. Hurry up.

478
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:19,696
Don't Iisten to Tiny Tim, okay?

479
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:22,871
You're the real big boy.
Everybody knows it.

480
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:27,702
Ready? One, two, three, go.

481
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:31,637
One, two, three, go, go, go, go!

482
00:38:31,814 --> 00:38:33,076
Oh, yeah.

483
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,945
I'm going.

484
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:40,112
Oh, boy.

485
00:38:48,564 --> 00:38:50,862
What--? What is this?

486
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,897
What is--?

487
00:38:53,135 --> 00:38:54,534
Travis! Hey!

488
00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:58,265
Welcome to the jungle, tough guy!

489
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,704
Looks Iike big boy
got himself pig-snared!

490
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:03,310
Hey! Hey!
I've got the keys to your cuffs.

491
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,507
-Shit.
-I'II tell you what you've got, pal.

492
00:39:06,715 --> 00:39:10,651
-You've got problems.
-That's-- Don't do it, Travis.

493
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:15,250
Hey. Hey, get me down. Travis.

494
00:39:15,424 --> 00:39:18,825
Oh, what's this? Is this your diary?
Your Iittle journal?

495
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:21,792
-Give me that. Don't touch that.
-You want this? Get it!

496
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:24,865

00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,234
Give it to me!

499
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:30,770
You're Iike a Iittle birdie up there!

500
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:36,042
I will kill you.
You better give me that book.

501
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:39,879
"Shrimp and pea risotto
with basil and mint."

502
00:39:40,115 --> 00:39:42,811
-Are you a chef?
-None of your business. Give it back!

503
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:45,317
Looks Iike you're
Wolfgang Stuck right here.

504
00:39:45,487 --> 00:39:46,886
Travis! Travis!

505
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:50,852
-Hey! I Iet you pee.
-Oh, yeah, you did. You did.

506
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:52,926
Thank you so much.
Do you have to pee?

507
00:39:53,095 --> 00:39:55,461
Well, you got 30 seconds.
Go ahead and pee.

508
00:39:58,133 --> 00:39:59,532
Oh, shit.

509
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:05,338
-Hey, I was kidding about what I said.
-Give me the book.

510
00:40:05,507 --> 00:40:08,237
-I don't want it. I don't want it.
-Turn around.

511
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:11,044
-Why you always gotta hit me?
-Now Iisten to me.

512
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:13,647
We gotta get to this tree.
Let's go back to back.

513
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:15,807
AII right. Okay.

514
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:19,120
-Kick your Iegs!
-I'm trying! I'm kicking my Iegs!

515
00:40:19,288 --> 00:40:21,950
-Where are you?
-Grab me. Grab my back, not my ass.

516
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:23,614
-Got it?
-I got it. Got it.

517
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:25,521
Oh, great! You did it!

518
00:40:25,694 --> 00:40:28,185
-Now what?
-Put your arm over me. Get to the tree.

519
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:30,365
-Listen.
-You're Iike Joe Pig-snare?

520
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:32,500
Put your arm over me!

521
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:36,994
-Just stop moving!
-The vine. You gotta grab the--

522
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:40,498
What was that?

523
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:44,374
-Oh, shit.
-What was that?

524
00:40:45,614 --> 00:40:46,911
Monkeys.

525
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:54,850
Steady.

526
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:57,488
Steady.

527
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,221
Steady.

528
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:02,526
Steady.

529
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:07,834
Steady!

530
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:12,105
Oh, God!

531
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:19,274
Oh, God!

532
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,454
Do not fight them!

533
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:29,552
Oh, my God!

534
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:35,319
-What's he doing? What's he doing?
-He's humping you, he's humping you!

535
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:37,624
-What's he doing?
-Establish dominance!

536
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,425
Establish dominance!

537
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:41,902
Get him off of me!

538
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,070
He's humping me!
Make him stop!

539
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:49,241
The ears! Get the ears.

540
00:41:56,985 --> 00:41:58,850
-Who's that?
-It's the rebels.

541
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:01,046
Don't worry, they're my friends.

542
00:42:03,726 --> 00:42:05,591
God bless you!

543
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:07,456
Say hi.

544
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:09,093
Hi.

545
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:33,580
These are your friends, huh?
What, are you kidding me?

546
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:36,452
I'm starting to Iong for a monkey
with a hard-on.

547
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:46,122
Whatever happens,
just keep Iooking into his eyes.

548
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:47,996
-Won't that offend him?
-No.

549
00:42:48,637 --> 00:42:52,073
Whatever you do, do not blink.
They're Iike grizzlies.

550
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:54,402
Just shut up
and Iet me take care of this.

551
00:42:57,045 --> 00:43:03,314
We know you work for Hatcher.
Were you tracking us?!

552
00:43:03,485 --> 00:43:06,511
-He thinks we work for Hatcher.
-Well, tell him the truth.

553
00:43:07,122 --> 00:43:09,920
Fierce gaze. Fierce gaze.
Fierce gaze.

554
00:43:17,132 --> 00:43:22,092
Honorable host, unlike this man on my
Ieft, I do not work for that evil scum.

555
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:30,743
Why does the giant stare at me without
respect? I will cut out his arrogant eyes!

556
00:43:30,913 --> 00:43:34,212
-What's he saying?
-Shut up. Just hold his gaze.

557
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:39,749
He is Hatcher's assassin. Paid to hunt
all who oppose him, including me.

558
00:43:45,661 --> 00:43:48,858
Why do I get the feeling
you really suck at Portuguese?

559
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:51,827
What did he say?!

560
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:55,102
He says he pisses on your ancestors...

561
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,966
...and that you would make
a very pretty bride!

562
00:44:01,443 --> 00:44:03,468
-What's going on?
-He wants to fight you.

563
00:44:03,645 --> 00:44:06,614
No. We're not fighting.
Tell him I don't want to fight.

564
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,183
The assassin is a great warrior! Better
to shoot him now and get it over with!

565
00:44:13,355 --> 00:44:16,347
-We are not fighting.
-Don't worry, they're Iittle people.

566
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:19,289
-What?
-You could take them. They're Iittle.

567
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:21,592
You can win.

568
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,167
Why do you want to fight? Why?

569
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:28,570
I just want to get back to the airport.

570
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,102
PIease. I just have to get home.

571
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,540
Okay, hip-hop.

572
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:45,952
I don't want to do this.
PIease. PIease.

573
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:50,057
Travis, tell them one more time
I do not want to fight.

574
00:44:50,425 --> 00:44:53,292
I'd Iove to help you out,
buddy, but I don't think...

575
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:55,692
...they're really Iistening
to me anymore.

576
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:59,257
Heads up.

577
00:45:08,944 --> 00:45:11,640
That's okay! That is okay!

578
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,895
Hey, Kansas cities!

579
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,067
Don't do it.

580
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:45,880
What is that?
It's Iike spinning Tarzan jujitsu!

581
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:53,259
Speedy Iittle bastards, aren't they?

582
00:45:55,782 --> 00:45:57,545
Head's gotta stay up.

583
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:08,879
I am not your enemy.

584
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:17,124
Mariana?

585
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,698
What are you doing here?

586
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:36,105
Barmaid by day,
rebel Ieader by night.

587
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,010
You are good! The whole time I was
working you, you were working me.

588
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:43,448
I was hoping you might find
O Gato do Diabo.

589
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,813
It couldn't have all been work.

590
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:49,925
could it?
Man, that was some good work.

591
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,192
What do you think, Travis?

592
00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:55,357
I knew. You know that, right?
I totally knew.

593
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,396
Of course.

594
00:47:58,368 --> 00:48:00,029
Hey.

595
00:48:00,637 --> 00:48:03,401
The herbs will keep it
from getting infected.

596
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,644
-Why do you do this?
-Pardon me?

597
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:17,476
-Why do you fight?
-Because of 65 cents an hour.

598
00:48:17,988 --> 00:48:20,149
That's what Hatcher
pays the workers.

599
00:48:20,323 --> 00:48:22,484
But in order to mine,
you need tools.

600
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:26,117
You need food, clothing,
a place to sleep.

601
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,455
You have no money,
so, what do you do?

602
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:31,600
You borrow from Hatcher.

603
00:48:32,068 --> 00:48:35,560
Pick and shovel, a dollar a day.

604
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,340
A sack to haul the dirt,
another dollar.

605
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:41,944
OId Mr. Beck knows a Iot
about debt, don't you?

606
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:45,579
He knows what it's Iike to dig a hole
so deep you can't climb out.

607
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:48,582
call it what you want.
It's escravidao.

608
00:48:48,752 --> 00:48:50,014
"SIavery."

609
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:52,212
And we intend to stop it.

610
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:05,633
Manito wants to know who would win
a fight between Tyson and AIi.

611
00:49:08,505 --> 00:49:09,938
AIi, hands down.

612
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:14,942
He says, "What about
Tyson's power?"

613
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:17,477
Shit. Tell him AIi
would've done to Tyson...

614
00:49:17,647 --> 00:49:19,478
...what he did to Foreman in Africa.

615
00:49:20,717 --> 00:49:22,981
Rumble. Rumble in the Jungle.

616
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,578
Tell him AIi was too smart.

617
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,520
Too smart, too fast.
Would've used his jabs. Bam, bam!

618
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:32,022
Would've danced.

619
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:33,887
Would've played with his mind.

620
00:49:34,064 --> 00:49:37,659
Before you know it, bam! Left
to the body. Bam! Right to the head.

621
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:40,502
Down goes Tyson.

622
00:49:41,871 --> 00:49:43,668
FIoat Iike butterfly.

623
00:49:44,574 --> 00:49:46,474
Sting Iike bee.

624
00:49:48,178 --> 00:49:51,147
FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike bee.

625
00:49:51,314 --> 00:49:53,748
-Yeah!
-FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike a bee!

626
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:58,081
-Yeah!
-FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike a bee!

627
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:20,872
He says he thinks
you are a great fighter...

628
00:50:21,945 --> 00:50:23,503
...and he wants you to have it.

629
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,944
-It's for Iuck.
-Tell him I'm sorry, I can't.

630
00:50:26,116 --> 00:50:29,210
You'II offend him if you refuse.

631
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:36,516
I'm honored. Thank you.

632
00:50:40,563 --> 00:50:42,428
You'II need all the Iuck you can get.

633
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,494
It's a Iong walk back to the airfield.

634
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:47,834
Especially by yourself.

635
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:49,972
Nice!

636
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,902
You don't understand.

637
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:56,107
-I'm not going back without him.
-Oh, here we go again.

638
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:57,677
Fifty rifles say you are.

639
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:04,804
And we're rebels, not thieves.

640
00:51:12,384 --> 00:51:13,914
Hatcher!

641
00:51:16,554 --> 00:51:18,494
Travis!

642
00:51:37,314 --> 00:51:39,104
Let's clean it up.

643
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:07,734
Not so fast, jungle boy.

644
00:52:13,514 --> 00:52:15,174
Move! Move!

645
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:22,274
come on!

646
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:33,754
Manito!

647
00:52:35,764 --> 00:52:37,394
Go, go, go!

648
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,264
-Manito!
-Let's go!

649
00:53:00,164 --> 00:53:02,124
I want hunting parties.

650
00:53:02,324 --> 00:53:03,954
Small ones.

651
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:05,854
Find them.

652
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:07,964
Find them!

653
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:15,204
AII right, this is the way
it's going to be.

654
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:20,324
You're going to take me
to O Gato do Diabo.

655
00:54:22,904 --> 00:54:25,434
-And you're going to take me now.
-calm down.

656
00:54:25,614 --> 00:54:29,204
Don't! You saw what they do.
Don't ever tell me to calm down.

657
00:54:29,384 --> 00:54:32,014
Travis, don't play with me.

658
00:54:32,184 --> 00:54:34,484
-Or what?
-Or I'm going to shoot you.

659
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:37,624
Well, if you shoot me,
you're never gonna find the Gato.

660
00:54:38,094 --> 00:54:41,524
-So we're gonna make a Iittle deal.
-Deal?

661
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:46,194
You see? O Gato is an object to you.
It's Iife on the Riviera, a private yacht.

662
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:49,024
-You don't know anything about me.
-For us it's hope.

663
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:51,364
My heart's breaking.
It's Iike a telethon.

664
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:53,834
-You selfish--
-Enough!

665
00:54:54,004 --> 00:54:55,804
Sit down! Sit down!

666
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:57,804
Holy shit, you tried to shoot me!

667
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:01,174
You saw it!

668
00:55:01,644 --> 00:55:03,044
-crazy.
-Shut up.

669
00:55:03,214 --> 00:55:04,844
Shut up.

670
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:09,984
The deal's this.
He takes you to the Gato.

671
00:55:10,194 --> 00:55:14,624
You just show me how I get out of this
jungle so I can take him home. Deal?

672
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:20,754
Do we have a deal?

673
00:55:22,264 --> 00:55:25,324
-Deal.
-Let me get this straight.

674
00:55:25,504 --> 00:55:28,494
She gets what she needs,
you get what you need...

675
00:55:28,674 --> 00:55:32,074
-...and I get the shaft.
-I could always give her back the gun.

676
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:35,774
-I really don't Iike you.
-Yeah, well, I get that a Iot.

677
00:55:35,944 --> 00:55:37,434
Seriously.

678
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:40,574
What?

679
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:43,714
I was just wondering
how it is you came to do...

680
00:56:43,884 --> 00:56:46,074
...you know, whatever it is you do.

681
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,214
-It's a Iong story.
-It's a Iong walk.

682
00:56:53,154 --> 00:56:55,624
I grew up in a very rough place.

683
00:56:56,464 --> 00:56:58,724
One thing Ied to another, that's all.

684
00:56:59,864 --> 00:57:01,494
-Just Iike you.
-Like me?

685
00:57:01,664 --> 00:57:03,694
Yeah, you get pushed,
you push back.

686
00:57:03,874 --> 00:57:06,704
Well, with me, I pushed so hard
that word got around.

687
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:10,434
Before I knew it, I was in a room
full of the wrong people...

688
00:57:10,614 --> 00:57:12,104
...with the wrong money.

689
00:57:12,374 --> 00:57:15,434
So you think I'm standing
in a room full of the wrong people?

690
00:57:15,614 --> 00:57:18,344
Yeah. Something Iike that.

691
00:57:18,784 --> 00:57:21,214
I Iike you, Mr. Beck.

692
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:23,274
Really.

693
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:26,354
But you and I are nothing alike.

694
00:57:28,694 --> 00:57:30,184
Travis!

695
00:57:30,394 --> 00:57:32,524
Let's keep moving. Let's go.

696
00:58:13,804 --> 00:58:15,504
What are you doing?

697
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:19,374
Let's take us a Iittle swim,
Wolfgang.

698
00:58:21,844 --> 00:58:23,784
We're not swimming. Let's go.

699
00:58:23,954 --> 00:58:25,884
come on, big boy.
You could use a bath.

700
00:58:26,054 --> 00:58:28,784
Travis, we have to keep moving.
It'II be dark soon.

701
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:32,324
Why?

702
00:58:32,494 --> 00:58:34,514
We're already here.

703
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:49,044
-Don't pee in the water.
-Why?

704
00:58:49,204 --> 00:58:52,944
A candiru, a vicious parasite,
will swim up the urine into your pau.

705
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:56,704
come on, big boy! It feels good!

706
00:58:58,054 --> 00:59:00,884
-Swim up my what?
-Your pinto.

707
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:06,054
It'II swim up your ding-dong. And once
it gets in, you can't get it out.

708
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:08,524
come on!

709
00:59:08,694 --> 00:59:10,324
Wait.

710
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:12,724
Well, then what?

711
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:14,824
They have to amputate.

712
00:59:24,214 --> 00:59:27,614
Not this boy's pinto. Not today.

713
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:55,034
The hieroglyphic code...

714
00:59:55,204 --> 00:59:58,604
...said the great chief of the Marajo
people put the Gato to sleep...

715
00:59:58,774 --> 01:00:02,304
-...behind walls of a moving curtain.
-A waterfall.

716
01:00:22,734 --> 01:00:24,934
Must be some kind of
methane buildup.

717
01:00:29,844 --> 01:00:31,834
It's cool. Let's go.

718
01:00:45,254 --> 01:00:48,524
-Oh, God!
-Yeah, real genius.

719
01:00:48,694 --> 01:00:51,224
-You have no clue what you're doing.
-Oh, shut up!

720
01:00:51,434 --> 01:00:54,294
You obviously don't know
anything about methane deposits.

721
01:00:54,464 --> 01:00:57,234
-Oh, and you do?
-Shut up.

722
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,734
What'd you just say?

723
01:01:31,774 --> 01:01:33,504
What is it?

724
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:43,414
Why do I get the feeling
we are not supposed to be here?

725
01:01:44,554 --> 01:01:46,414
Because we're not.

726
01:01:56,624 --> 01:01:58,394
There it is! I told you it was real!

727
01:01:58,564 --> 01:02:02,024
Travis, you're never gonna get
back there. It's too dangerous.

728
01:02:05,374 --> 01:02:06,774
The roof is coming down!

729
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:08,904
Wait a second.

730
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:12,644
A jaguar.

731
01:02:15,684 --> 01:02:17,044
I know what this is.

732
01:02:17,214 --> 01:02:18,804
Monkey.

733
01:02:19,414 --> 01:02:21,044
Eagle.

734
01:02:21,254 --> 01:02:23,684
-I can't hold this, Travis.
-I know what this is.

735
01:02:23,854 --> 01:02:26,324
-What is it?
-It's an 800-year-old safe.

736
01:02:26,524 --> 01:02:28,994
This is how they kept
their treasures protected.

737
01:02:30,934 --> 01:02:32,324
There's a combination.

738
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:38,224
Jaguar, cat. Gato, cat.
It's gotta be the jaguar.

739
01:02:38,404 --> 01:02:41,564
We pull the sticks closest
to the jaguar, we'II be okay.

740
01:02:41,744 --> 01:02:43,934
For 60 seconds,
then the roof's coming down.

741
01:02:44,114 --> 01:02:46,234
You're not gonna touch anything.
Let's go!

742
01:02:50,044 --> 01:02:51,714
AII right.

743
01:02:53,984 --> 01:02:55,854
Follow the jag.

744
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:57,854
Follow the jaguar.

745
01:03:04,534 --> 01:03:07,264
Easy. Easy.

746
01:03:09,234 --> 01:03:10,824
It's coming down, Travis.

747
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:19,334
What are you doing?
Let's go!

748
01:03:20,174 --> 01:03:21,574
Pass it to me.

749
01:03:27,524 --> 01:03:29,644
-Is that a jaguar?
-I think it's an eagle!

750
01:03:29,854 --> 01:03:31,514
Travis, hurry!

751
01:03:34,494 --> 01:03:36,424
Oh, my....

752
01:03:42,434 --> 01:03:44,764
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

753
01:03:52,344 --> 01:03:53,974
I did it.

754
01:03:54,514 --> 01:03:56,244
I found you.

755
01:03:56,944 --> 01:04:00,614
Not some Oxford archaeologist
or some stiff-ass Harvard professor.

756
01:04:00,784 --> 01:04:03,584
-I did it! I found you!
-Who gives a shit?

757
01:04:03,784 --> 01:04:06,124
How you Iike me now, huh, Beck?

758
01:04:08,994 --> 01:04:10,514
Go! Go! Move! Now!

759
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:12,654
Run!

760
01:04:15,504 --> 01:04:17,164
Let's go!

761
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:18,564
Move!

762
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:35,914
These are konlabos.

763
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:38,254
They're very rare.

764
01:04:38,454 --> 01:04:39,654
You're Iucky.

765
01:04:45,634 --> 01:04:49,194
And I wouldn't flirt with O Gato
do Diabo's eyes if I were you.

766
01:04:49,364 --> 01:04:51,894
-They say it's dangerous.
-What else do they say?

767
01:04:52,074 --> 01:04:55,764
Once restored to its rightful owners,
the rivers will be Iaden with fish.

768
01:04:55,944 --> 01:04:58,914
And the trees will grow tall,
bringing shade for hammocks...

769
01:04:59,074 --> 01:05:01,044
...so its people may rest their backs.

770
01:05:01,214 --> 01:05:03,734
You think bringing this Gato
will do all that?

771
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:07,754
No, Mr. Beck. But I expect the money
selling it brings will do just that.

772
01:05:07,924 --> 01:05:11,684
We can buy seed, irrigate.
Farm our own Iands.

773
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:13,954
Free ourselves from Hatcher's mine.

774
01:05:16,024 --> 01:05:19,124
When that statue hits the black
market, it'II vanish forever.

775
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:20,924
It's a Iittle Iate for morals.

776
01:05:21,104 --> 01:05:23,864
Especially after you were going
to do the same thing.

777
01:05:24,034 --> 01:05:27,094
And 1 0 percent of that is going
to pay for your freedom...

778
01:05:27,274 --> 01:05:30,364
...so I'd be a Iittle more grateful
if I were you.

779
01:05:31,814 --> 01:05:34,784
What if I told you I was gonna
give it to a museum...

780
01:05:34,944 --> 01:05:37,044
...so the whole world
could appreciate it?

781
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:41,744
You can tell me anything you want,
Travis, but I know you.

782
01:05:47,624 --> 01:05:50,094
What are you going to do
after you bring him home?

783
01:05:50,294 --> 01:05:54,094
-I'm gonna open a restaurant.
-Yeah. He's a killer in the kitchen too.

784
01:05:54,264 --> 01:05:56,664
Ten, 1 5 tables. Nothing fancy.

785
01:05:57,574 --> 01:06:00,804
Italian. Southern Italian.

786
01:06:21,464 --> 01:06:23,424
How do you...?

787
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:29,464
How do you...? How do you spell...

788
01:06:31,034 --> 01:06:32,974
...konlabos?

789
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:37,844
Konlabos, with a K.

790
01:06:38,314 --> 01:06:42,444
Don't worry. After four or five hours,
you'II be as good as new.

791
01:06:45,684 --> 01:06:48,744
The fire will keep the animals away
until sunup.

792
01:06:51,194 --> 01:06:52,814
I'm sorry...

793
01:06:53,024 --> 01:06:55,994
...but money has a way
of changing people.

794
01:06:56,694 --> 01:06:58,124
You did find it, Travis.

795
01:06:58,964 --> 01:07:01,094
Just Iike you said.

796
01:07:02,404 --> 01:07:05,024
No one can take that
away from you.

797
01:07:12,744 --> 01:07:14,574
And I will send you the money...

798
01:07:14,744 --> 01:07:16,474
...buy your freedom. I meant that.

799
01:07:20,284 --> 01:07:23,154
You kept your word,
and I admire that...

800
01:07:23,484 --> 01:07:25,384
...so I'II keep mine.

801
01:07:25,554 --> 01:07:27,654
Go north until you reach
the Quantana Road.

802
01:07:27,864 --> 01:07:30,354
Take it south
all the way to the airfield.

803
01:07:30,564 --> 01:07:32,494
Good Iuck to you, Mr. Beck.

804
01:08:36,694 --> 01:08:38,164
Oh, shit.

805
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,834
What? What?

806
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:48,944
-What?
-Monkey. Monkey.

807
01:08:49,104 --> 01:08:51,164
Monkey? Where?
Just get him away from me.

808
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:53,814
-Get out of here.
-Get out of here.

809
01:08:53,974 --> 01:08:55,814
Get out of here, monkey!

810
01:08:57,244 --> 01:08:59,184
Oh, no.

811
01:08:59,354 --> 01:09:01,414
-I hate this place.
-Get out of here!

812
01:09:01,584 --> 01:09:05,884
I hate penis-eating minnows,
and I hate freaky fruit.

813
01:09:07,054 --> 01:09:10,394
-Get them away from me.
-I wanna go home. I want concrete.

814
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:13,994
-Get out of here, monkey.
-I want homemade tortellini.

815
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:16,534
I want my Los Angeles Lakers.

816
01:09:16,864 --> 01:09:20,324
That's what I want. I want to go home.
I want to go home.

817
01:09:21,344 --> 01:09:24,334
I want to go home!

818
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:28,544
Get out of here, monkey.
Get out of here, monkey.

819
01:09:47,634 --> 01:09:49,764
Well, what about that?

820
01:09:53,574 --> 01:09:56,334
-Been for a stroll, have you, boys?
-Where's my bag?

821
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:58,564
Where's my jeep?

822
01:09:58,744 --> 01:10:00,714
Give me my bag.

823
01:10:10,324 --> 01:10:11,784
You have any water?

824
01:10:20,264 --> 01:10:23,534
Sit down. How soon
before we can take off?

825
01:10:23,704 --> 01:10:26,364
You Ieft a jeep at the bottom
of a mountainside.

826
01:10:26,534 --> 01:10:29,004
-I'II take care of it.
-In a bloody Iarge puddle.

827
01:10:29,174 --> 01:10:32,634
-I said, I'II take care of it.
-That jeep is dead, my friend.

828
01:10:33,174 --> 01:10:34,874
Look, you'II get your money.

829
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:37,344
-Just start the plane.
-What's your big hurry?

830
01:10:37,514 --> 01:10:40,784
I'm trying to Ieave before I run
into Hatcher or more problems.

831
01:10:40,954 --> 01:10:42,644
Don't go worrying about Hatcher.

832
01:10:43,084 --> 01:10:46,084
That monstrosity
won't give a flying fornication...

833
01:10:46,294 --> 01:10:49,264
...for the pair of youse no more.
He got what he was after.

834
01:10:49,424 --> 01:10:50,984
What do you mean?

835
01:10:51,194 --> 01:10:53,794
He caught up with poor Mariana
in the jungle.

836
01:10:53,964 --> 01:10:56,024
He relieved her of her artifact.

837
01:10:56,734 --> 01:11:01,194
-What'd you say?
-I said, he relieved her of her artifact.

838
01:11:01,374 --> 01:11:04,464
It's a word in the English Ianguage.
"Artifact." Look it up.

839
01:11:04,644 --> 01:11:07,974
Son of a bitch. He's got my Gato!

840
01:11:08,144 --> 01:11:12,084
-Your what?
-The Gato. Don't you speak English?

841
01:11:12,784 --> 01:11:15,614
-Hey. Where is she?
-Hatcher's got her in town.

842
01:11:15,884 --> 01:11:18,754
-He's torturing her for information.
-He's doing what?

843
01:11:20,794 --> 01:11:23,154
Freedom fighters?
Freedom fighters, my ass.

844
01:11:23,324 --> 01:11:26,324
Lutadores de Louco, you ask me.

845
01:11:26,494 --> 01:11:28,594
They're all gonna die.

846
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:30,794
come on. AII aboard.

847
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:03,454
come on.

848
01:12:04,304 --> 01:12:06,134
What are you doing?

849
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:12,134
-We made a deal.
-A deal?

850
01:12:13,274 --> 01:12:14,934
What the hell does that mean?

851
01:12:15,114 --> 01:12:17,704
I'm here at the airstrip,
she doesn't have the Gato.

852
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,014
Gonna go in there by yourself?

853
01:12:21,624 --> 01:12:24,314
No way. No way.

854
01:12:24,524 --> 01:12:26,614
Hey, Hatcher's got a small army
back there.

855
01:12:26,824 --> 01:12:28,794
You don't know your way
around the town.

856
01:12:28,994 --> 01:12:30,514
Oh, wait. I got an idea.

857
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:32,724
Saddle up to one of those bulls...

858
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:37,394
...ride into town Iike a conquistador
and challenge all of them to a duel.

859
01:12:37,674 --> 01:12:40,604
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

860
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:42,834
You don't use guns.

861
01:12:43,004 --> 01:12:45,474
-What's your point?
-You're gonna die, Beck.

862
01:12:45,644 --> 01:12:48,514
The boy's right.
You mind if we settle the bill now?

863
01:12:48,684 --> 01:12:50,174
You need help.

864
01:12:50,344 --> 01:12:53,514
Are you gonna help me, Travis?
AII you care about is the money.

865
01:12:53,684 --> 01:12:55,344
No, Beck, you're wrong.

866
01:12:55,554 --> 01:12:58,684
I'd rather die than Iet that
son of a bitch get my Gato.

867
01:12:58,894 --> 01:13:02,694
You need all the help you can get.
You can even use him, for chrissake.

868
01:13:02,864 --> 01:13:05,724
Don't bring me into it.
I got a dodgy knee here.

869
01:13:07,394 --> 01:13:09,924
You can't do this on your own.

870
01:13:18,674 --> 01:13:20,904
Okay, Travis.

871
01:13:22,244 --> 01:13:24,304
I know you're gonna run on me.

872
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:26,384
Might not be tonight or tomorrow.

873
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:30,454
But I will find you,
and I will take you back.

874
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:34,584
-Are we clear?
-Yeah.

875
01:13:34,794 --> 01:13:37,764
We'II both probably be dead
in about an hour.

876
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:39,894
So Iet's cancel christmas.

877
01:13:50,144 --> 01:13:52,734
Your plan of attack was a bit naive.

878
01:13:53,814 --> 01:13:56,244
Man, if I was only
1 0 minutes younger, huh?

879
01:13:57,244 --> 01:14:00,944
I suppose now we have a conversation
where you enlighten me.

880
01:14:01,124 --> 01:14:02,344
Mr. Hatcher.

881
01:14:02,554 --> 01:14:05,544
How many more of you are out there?
Enlighten me.

882
01:14:05,754 --> 01:14:08,244
Where are the rest of your
compadres? Enlighten me!

883
01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:09,684
Mr. Hatcher.

884
01:14:09,864 --> 01:14:12,264
I don't get why you people
are so hostile.

885
01:14:12,434 --> 01:14:14,924
I've been good to you.
I built you a town.

886
01:14:15,104 --> 01:14:16,324
Why are we fighting?

887
01:14:16,504 --> 01:14:17,834
-Mr. Hatcher.
-What?

888
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:20,934
We've Iost contact
with Outpost 1.

889
01:14:23,044 --> 01:14:24,734
There's nobody answering.

890
01:14:29,584 --> 01:14:33,514
-Mr. Hatcher, are you out there?
-What can I do for you, Mr. Beck?

891
01:14:33,684 --> 01:14:36,014
I have no desire to fight
with you or your men.

892
01:14:36,454 --> 01:14:38,384
For that reason,
you have two options.

893
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:41,584
Option A, you leave the Gato
and the girl...

894
01:14:41,794 --> 01:14:44,284
...and you walk out of town,
no questions asked.

895
01:14:44,494 --> 01:14:47,594
-What's option B?
-Option B...

896
01:14:47,764 --> 01:14:49,564
...I make you.

897
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:04,144
Wrong choice.

898
01:15:10,484 --> 01:15:12,454
Lock down the town.

899
01:16:15,924 --> 01:16:19,784
Still no visual contact. Team two
is checking the perimeter right now.

900
01:17:04,774 --> 01:17:06,364
He...

901
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:10,064
...that heard the sound
of thy holy trumpet...

902
01:17:10,244 --> 01:17:12,304
...and took not warning...

903
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:16,404
...he hath clearly wandered too far...

904
01:17:16,584 --> 01:17:18,204
...from the word of God.

905
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:21,544
And cornelius Bernard Hatcher...

906
01:17:21,854 --> 01:17:26,484
...your heir has come.
Let's get it on, big boy!

907
01:17:26,694 --> 01:17:30,214
It's time to get back on the path.

908
01:18:29,154 --> 01:18:30,554
That's a Iot of cows.

909
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,494
Hi.

910
01:18:56,544 --> 01:18:57,844
What nerve.

911
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:23,474
About bloody time, huh?

912
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:28,344
Somebody just shoot him.

913
01:19:55,414 --> 01:19:57,464
Oh, yeah? Oh, you want one?

914
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,174
Oh, okay.

915
01:20:01,344 --> 01:20:05,254
A Iittle thunder? Huh?
You Iike thunderstorms, big boy?

916
01:20:06,054 --> 01:20:07,524
How about some Iightning?

917
01:20:14,594 --> 01:20:19,294
Ear, ear-- Ears, eyes, foot, face!

918
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:29,414
Take the Gato and the girl
and get to the airfield.

919
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,374
If you run into trouble,
use her as a hostage.

920
01:20:32,544 --> 01:20:35,214
And Harvey,
when you're safely out of town...

921
01:20:35,384 --> 01:20:38,184
...put her out of my misery.

922
01:21:10,084 --> 01:21:11,414
I need help!

923
01:21:16,804 --> 01:21:19,434
Do not go gentle
into that good night, my Iovely.

924
01:21:21,304 --> 01:21:23,964
Beck! I need help. Beck!

925
01:21:24,244 --> 01:21:25,934
Rage, rage...

926
01:21:28,444 --> 01:21:30,274
...against the dying of the Iight.

927
01:21:34,114 --> 01:21:36,584
There shall be no mercy...

928
01:21:39,924 --> 01:21:42,124
...for any force that stands...

929
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:48,224
...blocking this path
of his righteousness.

930
01:21:52,404 --> 01:21:54,234
Beck, help!

931
01:21:56,404 --> 01:21:57,934


932
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:04,584
Help!

933
01:22:43,184 --> 01:22:44,884
Move!

934
01:23:24,864 --> 01:23:27,024
No way.

935
01:23:39,244 --> 01:23:41,444
Give me back my Gato,
you Iittle bald freak!

936
01:24:37,574 --> 01:24:38,834
Oh, great.

937
01:26:12,844 --> 01:26:14,814
See you.

938
01:26:14,984 --> 01:26:17,004
You got the moves.

939
01:26:17,184 --> 01:26:18,584
I'II give you that.

940
01:26:27,494 --> 01:26:32,364
You reached into the wrong
refrigerator, Mr. Beck.

941
01:26:44,004 --> 01:26:45,974
Hold your horses.

942
01:26:46,144 --> 01:26:48,134
What have I done?

943
01:26:49,714 --> 01:26:51,474
Are we not men?

944
01:26:52,384 --> 01:26:54,144
-Hatcher.
-What?

945
01:26:54,314 --> 01:26:58,014
Option A is still on the table.
You can walk away right now.

946
01:26:59,254 --> 01:27:01,694
Option A doesn't work for me.

947
01:27:02,724 --> 01:27:06,754
Before I came here,
what did you people have?

948
01:27:07,094 --> 01:27:08,584
Face it. Be fair.

949
01:27:09,064 --> 01:27:11,694
I put a roof over your head,
coin in your pockets.

950
01:27:11,874 --> 01:27:15,934
You barefoot Indians
didn't have pockets...

951
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:19,504
...before Hatcher came along.

952
01:27:19,844 --> 01:27:23,444
I gave you a Iife!
I'm the heart in the darkness.

953
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:25,204
Face it...

954
01:27:25,384 --> 01:27:27,974
...you can't run this thing
without me.

955
01:27:28,154 --> 01:27:32,054
I am pumping the blood
of the modern world...

956
01:27:32,254 --> 01:27:34,384
...into your backward veins...

957
01:27:34,594 --> 01:27:36,754
...you stinking...

958
01:27:38,794 --> 01:27:40,024
...ingrate...

959
01:27:41,364 --> 01:27:43,854
...Oompa Loompa...

960
01:27:44,034 --> 01:27:46,234
...morons!

961
01:27:49,944 --> 01:27:51,734
Okay.

962
01:27:51,914 --> 01:27:53,874
That's it, I'm done.

963
01:28:01,424 --> 01:28:03,324
Mr. Beck...

964
01:28:05,454 --> 01:28:08,054
...I'II take option A.

965
01:28:10,294 --> 01:28:12,264
clear, please.

966
01:28:37,924 --> 01:28:39,184
Oh, shit.

967
01:28:53,874 --> 01:28:56,704
You make a hell of an entrance,
Mr. Beck.

968
01:28:58,474 --> 01:29:00,104
Yeah.

969
01:29:05,614 --> 01:29:08,914
I'd offer you a beer,
but I think you blew up my bar.

970
01:29:09,724 --> 01:29:11,714
Yeah, I think you're right.

971
01:29:13,954 --> 01:29:15,554
Thank you.

972
01:29:17,064 --> 01:29:20,194
-We had a deal.
-Yes, we did.

973
01:29:20,594 --> 01:29:23,394
And I'm afraid I didn't deliver
on that deal.

974
01:29:24,134 --> 01:29:25,934
How is that?

975
01:29:27,834 --> 01:29:29,734
The Gato.

976
01:29:29,844 --> 01:29:32,174
I promised you the Gato.

977
01:29:33,044 --> 01:29:35,444
Yes, well, I promised you Travis.

978
01:29:35,614 --> 01:29:38,514
You all talking about this Travis?

979
01:29:39,414 --> 01:29:41,384
And this Gato?

980
01:29:53,434 --> 01:29:54,664
I'm impressed.

981
01:29:54,834 --> 01:29:57,304
Yeah, well, make sure
they spell my name right.

982
01:30:00,074 --> 01:30:02,434
I told you it wasn't about the money.

983
01:30:04,714 --> 01:30:06,474
Well, big boy...

984
01:30:06,644 --> 01:30:08,614
...I guess it's your move.

985
01:30:19,824 --> 01:30:21,694
I'm impressed myself, Travis.

986
01:30:26,764 --> 01:30:29,464
Declan, start the plane.

987
01:30:29,934 --> 01:30:33,304
"Declan, start the plane"?
What does that mean?

988
01:30:33,474 --> 01:30:35,594
-I'm taking you home.
-Oh, I figured that.

989
01:30:35,874 --> 01:30:37,564
No breaks. Good Iuck.

990
01:30:37,744 --> 01:30:39,374
You too.

991
01:30:40,414 --> 01:30:42,534
I will send you your cut.

992
01:30:43,284 --> 01:30:45,144
Move.

993
01:30:46,484 --> 01:30:50,044
-Not a penny Iess than 1 5.6 million.
-Move, Travis.

994
01:30:50,254 --> 01:30:52,224
You really ought
to stay away from guns.

995
01:30:52,424 --> 01:30:56,014
You ought to get yourself
a psychiatrist. Seriously.

996
01:31:48,684 --> 01:31:50,304
Move.

997
01:31:55,184 --> 01:31:56,814
Well, Iook at him.

998
01:31:57,024 --> 01:32:00,514
Look at you. Your beard.
You're Iike a real man.

999
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:03,124
-But you're so thin.
-Running is good exercise.

1000
01:32:03,294 --> 01:32:05,694
Good exercise. That's funny.
Did you hear him?

1001
01:32:06,034 --> 01:32:07,294
Running for your Iife.

1002
01:32:08,604 --> 01:32:10,564
I Iove it. I really do!

1003
01:32:13,334 --> 01:32:15,934
You know there's not
enough aspirin in the world...

1004
01:32:16,104 --> 01:32:18,804
-...for a headache Iike you?
-Well, there probably is.

1005
01:32:18,974 --> 01:32:21,674
-But I understand what you mean.
-Well, that's good.

1006
01:32:21,844 --> 01:32:25,944
Because that means you'II understand
why you'II take that trip to chicago.

1007
01:32:26,114 --> 01:32:28,714
Actually, I don't completely
understand that one.

1008
01:32:28,884 --> 01:32:31,914
-Still the smart-ass.
-I'm not that smart, Dad.

1009
01:32:32,124 --> 01:32:35,184
-I didn't know she was married.
-Well, she was.

1010
01:32:35,924 --> 01:32:37,894
Very married.

1011
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:40,624
And you. What took you
so Iong, huh?

1012
01:32:40,794 --> 01:32:43,354
Your kid was
a tough rundown, Billy.

1013
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:47,024
-Him? No.
-Yeah, yeah.

1014
01:32:47,204 --> 01:32:50,534
But I did walk him right through
that door, right? Like we agreed?

1015
01:32:50,704 --> 01:32:52,544
-You did.
-We good?

1016
01:32:54,044 --> 01:32:56,804
We're good.
Two hundred and fifty Iarge.

1017
01:32:57,144 --> 01:32:58,774
You got your restaurant, kid.

1018
01:32:59,384 --> 01:33:00,784
Now get out of here, huh?

1019
01:33:03,524 --> 01:33:04,584
Before I Ieave....

1020
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:08,084
When I was in Brazil, they
showed me this ritual they do...

1021
01:33:08,294 --> 01:33:10,054
...when they have big celebrations.

1022
01:33:10,224 --> 01:33:16,134
What they do is, they eat this fruit,
and it's called konlabos, with a K.

1023
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:22,164
So I figured before I Ieave,
we could celebrate one Iast time.

1024
01:33:22,344 --> 01:33:24,174
come on, guys. Try some of this.

1025
01:33:24,344 --> 01:33:27,504
If he says it's good, it's gotta be.
He's the best chef I know.

1026
01:33:27,674 --> 01:33:30,474
Billy, here, you try the first piece.

1027
01:33:31,584 --> 01:33:32,814
Not bad.

1028
01:33:33,354 --> 01:33:36,754
Big seeds, though.
I don't Iike seeds.

1029
01:33:40,254 --> 01:33:41,914
Hey, what are you--?

1030
01:34:00,144 --> 01:34:02,574
I walked him right through
that door, Billy.

1031
01:34:07,854 --> 01:34:09,514
Boy...

1032
01:34:11,224 --> 01:34:13,194
...you got a funny-Iooking face.

1033
01:34:13,824 --> 01:34:15,554
Hey, Dad.

1034
01:34:18,994 --> 01:34:19,134
I Iove you, you know that?

1035
01:34:19,134 --> 01:34:20,524
I Iove you, you know that?

1036
01:34:20,694 --> 01:34:22,924
Because you showed me
something back there.

1037
01:34:23,104 --> 01:34:26,834
I thought you had character,
but I wasn't sure.

1038
01:34:27,004 --> 01:34:29,764
-You got it, man. You really got it!
-Get in the truck.

1039
01:34:29,874 --> 01:34:33,814
-You violated every agricultural Iaw.
-That's the Ieast of my problems.

1040
01:34:33,974 --> 01:34:36,414
We should go back
in there and finish him off.

1041
01:34:36,584 --> 01:34:38,104
You want to go back, go ahead.

1042
01:34:38,284 --> 01:34:41,484
-Knock yourself out. I'II wait for you.
-I'm not going back.

1043
01:34:41,654 --> 01:34:45,644
Right. So shut up, get in the truck
before I change my mind.

1044
01:34:45,854 --> 01:34:47,184
Don't push me.

1045
01:34:48,264 --> 01:34:49,984
-What?
-Don't push me.

1046
01:34:50,164 --> 01:34:52,124
I appreciate everything you did.

1047
01:34:52,334 --> 01:34:56,464
If you want to get technical, all you did
is even the score. I saved you first.

1048
01:34:56,664 --> 01:34:58,494
-Get in.
-You don't have to thank me.

1049
01:34:58,674 --> 01:35:01,864
But this pushing shit ain't
happening no more. You read me?

1050
01:35:05,014 --> 01:35:08,504
Okay. I'm gonna bust you up.

1051
01:35:08,914 --> 01:35:10,674
Go for it.

1052
01:35:11,814 --> 01:35:13,684
Yeah.

1053
01:35:15,454 --> 01:35:18,784
Hey, remember your friend
Mr. Thunder?

1054
01:35:18,994 --> 01:35:21,454
How about his buddy
Mr. Lightning?

1055
01:35:22,794 --> 01:35:25,264
I know you know him.

1056
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:28,194
You know him real well, don't you?

1057
01:35:39,644 --> 01:35:42,444
I'm just playing, man.
I'II be in the truck.

1058
01:35:46,784 --> 01:35:48,014
I'm gonna kill you.

1059
01:35:49,784 --> 01:35:51,014
THE END
