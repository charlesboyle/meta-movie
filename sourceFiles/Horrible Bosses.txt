1
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,455
I get to work before the sun comes up
and I leave long after it's gone down.

2
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:42,001
I haven't had sex in six months
with someone other than myself

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,920
And the only thing in my refrigerator
is an old lime.

4
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,805
Could be a kiwi. No way to tell.

5
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,093
- Morning, Thomas.
- Good morning, Nick. You better hurry.

6
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,596
This is just temporary.

7
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,020
Quick story:

8
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,935
My grandmother came to this country
with $20 in her pocket.

9
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,197
She worked hard her whole life
and never took shit from anyone.

10
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:08,657
When she died, she had
turned that $20 into $2000.

11
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,662
That sucks.

12
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,664
You know why she didn't succeed?

13
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,497
Because she didn't take shit
from anyone.

14
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,751
The key to success...

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,789
They will not teach you this
in business school... is taking shit.

16
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,384
That's what I've been doing the last
eight years, and it's all about to pay off

17
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,590
This is Nick.

18
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,677
I'm this close to getting a big promotion
with my own office...

19
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,383
I'll be right there, Mr. Harken.

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,850
Then all the endless hours,
and the sacrifice and the shit-eating...

21
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,309
...will have been worth it.

22
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,269
See, this is what concerns me, Nick.

23
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,187
You're a punctual guy. You know the
importance of being here right at 6 a.m.

24
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,193
Which is what leads me to think that...

25
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,450
...there must be something wrong
with the clock on our system.

26
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,952
May have been a minute late.

27
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,614
But according to this, you were two minutes late.
So either you're a liar...

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,502
...or this system is off by a full minute.

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,877
The only hitch?

30
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,290
I work for this guy, David Harken...

31
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,802
...who right now is giving me some
fresh shit for being two minutes late.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,133
He 's a total fucking asshole.

33
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,551
If that's the case, I'm gonna have to fire
Thomas, our longtime security coordinator.

34
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,970
- I may have been two minutes late.
- Oh.

35
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,767
Well, then you were lying.

36
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,065
No. I... Who you calling?

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,858
- Thomas. I gotta let him go.
- No, uh...

38
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,314
- I was lying. Sorry.
- Lying?

39
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,402
I didn't mean to. It was more of a saying.
"Might have been a minute late."

40
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:32,161
Literally, uh, truthfully,
was two minutes late.

41
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,040
Boy, I have to get used to driving
with this big, heavy ring on my finger.

42
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,577
- Come on.
- I keep swerving to the left, babe.

43
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,088
When I was a kid, people would
ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up.

44
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,839
I always gave the same answer.

45
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,090
I love you so much.

46
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,755
I love you too.

47
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,261
I wanted to be a husband.

48
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,672
- I will call you when I'm done.
- Have a good day.

49
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,090
I know that sounds weird.

50
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,476
Most boys wanna be firehouse chiefs
or personal trainers...

51
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,935
...but to me being a husband
was, like, the highest calling.

52
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,223
And thanks to Stacy...

53
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,274
...that dream's about to come true.

54
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,939
Unfortunately, no one's gonna pay you
to be a husband unless you marry Oprah.

55
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,903
So I had to find a job...

56
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,284
Now, I always admired dentists.

57
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,412
They're smart, they're capable,
they keep your teeth healthy.

58
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,164
So I went out and I became one.

59
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,494
- How are you today, Dale?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

60
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,874
Excavator.

61
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,540
- Okay, I became a dental assistant.
- It's basically the same thing...

62
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,926
I just make a lot less money.

63
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,132
Did you ever see that show Gossip Girl?

64
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,171
- No.
- Ooh.

65
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,306
I watched an episode last night.

66
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,603
I fingered myself so hard to that
Penn Badgley guy, I broke a nail.

67
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,810
And it would have been
the perfect job. If not for one...

68
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:47,399
...evil crazy bitch, D.D.S.

69
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,698
I bet you're no shrimp in
the cock department, huh, there, Dale?

70
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,153
- Okay, Julia. Come on.
- What?

71
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,319
- I'm uncomfortable talking about that.
- Oh, Dale, come on.

72
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,953
You know that I like to fool around.

73
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,614
- Oops.
- Mr. Anderton.

74
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,329
Not in the office. This is bad.

75
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,335
- Bad, bad, bad!
- You probably shouldn't hit the patients.

76
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,672
Ah, I love this. So festive.

77
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,003
I love my job.

78
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,012
If you ask me, anyone who hates their job
has no one to blame but them self

79
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,639
We make our own destinies,
and I've made a sweet one.

80
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,175
We have stairs.
You don't need to bring your own.

81
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,221
I'm an account manager at a chemical company.
I'll tell you, the job has its perks.

82
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,434
Hi, can I help you?

83
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,941
He's just signing for these packages.
Thank you.

84
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,271
Oh, no. I should do this.

85
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,902
Reggie, I got this. Thank you, buddy.

86
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,529
- This is high-priority stuff here.
- Thank you.

87
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,315
- So, what's going on here?
- I'm sorry?

88
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,951
- Is this one of those hidden camera shows?
- What do you mean?

89
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,282
You're way too cute
to be just a FedEx girl.

90
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,039
You gotta be a model or actress
or something, right?

91
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,372
What happens when I open these?
Something'll jump out, bite my penis?

92
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,663
No. Nothing's gonna jump out.
I'm just a FedEx girl.

93
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,251
- Shut up.
- Ha, ha.

94
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,757
- Bye.
- Have a great afternoon.

95
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,963
Thank you.

96
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,924
I didn't sign that form, by the way,
so she has to come back.

97
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,133
She's cute, huh, Reg?

98
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,220
- Caught another fly in your web, did you?
- Ha, ha. Hey, Jack.

99
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,564
Jack Pellit, my boss.
The sweetest man I know.

100
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,775
He loves me and I love him.
Everybody loves him.

101
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,483
- You all right, Margie?
- Hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt.

102
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,739
I've been waiting to get in there
for a while.

103
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,320
- Who's in there?
- It's your son.

104
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,072
Bobby!

105
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,239
Margie's waiting.
You nearly done in there?

106
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,001
A man can't get any privacy around here.

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,753
- Okay, Margie. Bobby?
- What?

108
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:32,170
Your stomach okay? You seem
to spend more time on the toilet...

109
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,424
...than at your desk.

110
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,217
I didn't realize I had to tell you
every time I wanna take a dump.

111
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,508
If the worst thing about this job
is having to tolerate my boss's...

112
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,395
...dipshit cokehead son,
well, it's a small price to pay.

113
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,180
Need me to tell you when I pee-pee?

114
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,691
I'm just trying to get you to do
your part, son. It's not easy times.

115
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,194
I do my part. I do other people's parts.

116
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,277
But it doesn't matter to you. You just
wanna ride my ass because I'm your son.

117
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,285
You know what? I don't hear you
giving dickskin any shit.

118
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,366
- "Dickskin"? Nice.
- Kiss-ass.

119
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,452
- Come on, come on.
- Yeah, go on. In you go.

120
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,991
- Go on, gay boy.
- I'm not gay.

121
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,785
Please, I've seen gay boys.
You're one of them.

122
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,296
- Where'd you see them?
- At your house. Get in!

123
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,500
- I'm a green belt, motherfucker.
- What?

124
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,714
- Yeah. All right?
- Okay.

125
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,131
Now, I know you've been working
your tail off for that promotion.

126
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,391
But I'm not sure I can even consider...

127
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:26,641
...making you the Senior Vice President
of Sales...

128
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,060
...if I can't trust you.

129
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,314
- You can trust me.
- Yeah, now you sound like my wife.

130
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,150
"Trust me. You can trust me, honey.

131
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,532
Nothing's happening behind your back.
Trust me."

132
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,660
Meanwhile, she's fucking
every guy in the neighborhood.

133
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,246
Oh, you want one?

134
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,998
It's 8:15 a.m.

135
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,661
Well, is there something wrong with
a man enjoying a drink in the morning?

136
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,462
No.

137
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,673
Thank you. Sure, thanks.

138
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,434
Bottoms up.

139
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,519
Nothing for you?

140
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,981
Nick, it's 8:15 in the morning.
I'm not an alcoholic.

141
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,852
The only reason I took one,
I thought you were gonna have one.

142
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:19,023
You took one because you thought I was?
Is that something a Senior VP would do?

143
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,066
I was just trying to be polite.

144
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,906
So if I, uh, was gonna put my balls
in honey and shaved coconut...

145
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,116
...you'd do that too?

146
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,575
- I would not.
- Sure?

147
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,116
- Yeah.
- Because I've got some coconut.

148
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,871
I'm having my teeth whitened Tuesday. You
have to get your work done by Monday...

149
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,381
...which means you'll probably
be here all weekend.

150
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,962
Look, if you want a promotion,
you gotta earn it.

151
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,419
Now, what do I keep saying?

152
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,054
Life is a marathon,
and you cannot win a marathon...

153
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,513
...without putting a few Band-Aids
on your nipples, right?

154
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,222
Right.

155
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,478
Nick.

156
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,723
It's 18-year-old Scotch.

157
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,393
You don't really expect me to
pour it back into the bottle, do you?

158
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,453
- Water.
- Yep.

159
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,131
All right. Let's see if
this thing's working. Oh!

160
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:23,303
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! I'm sorry. I'm a squirter, Dale.

161
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,216
- Oh, you know what?
- What?

162
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,603
Ah. I think I can make out
our little friend right there.

163
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,762
Stop it.

164
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,516
- Somebody's circumcised.
- Okay.

165
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,526
- Listen.
- What?

166
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,610
- Can we stop doing this thing here?
- Why? Because you have a girlfriend?

167
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,609
She's not just my girlfriend anymore.
We're engaged now.

168
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,619
- What?
- We're engaged.

169
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,866
You said that she was
just a hole for your dick.

170
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,956
I never said that.

171
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,370
Not really my style.

172
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,921
Shut up.

173
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,800
That's a lot of gas.

174
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,053
- That's good. No, those are great ideas.
- Yeah?

175
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,301
- Put them down on paper, will you?
- Will do.

176
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,102
- You're happy here, aren't you?
- Yeah, of course.

177
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,979
Good.

178
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,933
You got a bright future here,
you know?

179
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,027
Someday soon,
it'll be you running this place.

180
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,113
- See you, kid.
- All right, now.

181
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,112
- Drive safe.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,872
Oh, shit.

183
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,078
He had a heart attack.

184
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:39,163
They said his, uh, heart burst in his chest
like a water balloon.

185
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,167
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, man.
I know you guys were close.

186
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,836
Yeah. Yeah, I loved that guy.

187
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,176
I loved working for him, you know?
It was, like, awesome.

188
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,013
Now his shitbag son's
gonna be in charge and it's like...

189
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,176
The cokehead?

190
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,017
Yeah. Know how many times
I caught him doing blow at work?

191
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,355
This thing's a real bummer. Sorry. You're
the only one of us who didn't hate his job.

192
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,863
Did I tell you that Harken tricked me
into having a drink at 8:00 this morning?

193
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,694
I mean, I work for the Antichrist.

194
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,780
- How did he trick you?
- I thought he was giving you a promotion.

195
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,366
He is, definitely.
That's why he's being extra evil.

196
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,873
This is his last chance
to make my life miserable.

197
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,126
Right. At least your boss
isn't sexually harassing you.

198
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,082
- God. Here we go.
- Don't give me shit.

199
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,872
You won't get sympathy for this.

200
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,542
She's going crazy. It's like a totally
hostile work environment now, man.

201
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,130
- It's not funny.
- Yeah?

202
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,389
All right, today she starts spraying water
at my crotch to see the outline of my dick.

203
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,970
- That's great.
- It's not great.

204
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,137
What are you talking about?
Why don't you just, you know, fuck her?

205
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,932
Because I am engaged to be married
and I love my fiancee, okay?

206
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,145
That's true.

207
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,729
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

208
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,361
What about getting
a different dental hygienist job?

209
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,612
I can't get another job.

210
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,695
- No, he's a child molester, Nick.
- No, uh, deviant. Sexual deviant?

211
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,236
What is it? How do they classify it?
Sex offender.

212
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,245
I'm on the registered
sex offender list, yes.

213
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,122
You can't get that expunged? All you did
was pull your dick out on a playground.

214
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,582
I was taking a piss at night,
there were no kids.

215
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:06,045
All right, you know what? You don't
put a playground right next to a bar.

216
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,754
- It's entrapment.
Mm-hm.

217
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,756
Speaking of entrapment, I'm gonna go
see that girl about her vagina.

218
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,557
Excuse me.

219
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,722
He did say 10:00, right?

220
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,852
- Yeah. Do you know what this is about?
- It just said "staff meeting" on the memo.

221
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:29,524
It's funny how he gets all over my ass if I'm
a minute late, but then he makes us wait 15.

222
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,407
- You were two minutes late.
- Morning.

223
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,864
Didn't think I had to punch a clock
with you.

224
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,280
I'll just attribute this
to your drinking problem.

225
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,120
- I don't have...
- Please, we're in the middle of a meeting.

226
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,456
Morning, everyone.
So I have finally decided...

227
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:48,797
...who I want to be our new
Senior Vice President of Sales.

228
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,216
He's right here in this room.

229
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,516
- It's me.
- What'd he say?

230
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,974
I've decided to absorb
the responsibilities...

231
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,810
...of the Senior VP position
into my own.

232
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,567
I've realized if you wanna get something
done right, you gotta do it yourself.

233
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,902
I'll break through the wall of the office
that would have been the Senior VP's...

234
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,192
...and make one huge enormous office.

235
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:18,660
However, I will only be taking 85 percent of
the additional salary I am entitled to...

236
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,700
...and that is self-sacrifice, people.
Learn from it.

237
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,334
Fucker!

238
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,338
You fucking son of a bitch!

239
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,050
You are so fucking fired!

240
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,426
Yeah!

241
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,593
So, meeting adjourned.

242
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,099
- Can I speak to you?
- Sure, what is it?

243
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,190
For months you've been hinting
I was in line for that promotion.

244
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,354
And look how hard you've been working.

245
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,398
- You were just lying to me?
- Lying?

246
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,069
No, Nick, motivating.

247
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,909
I mean, look, we're all
part of the same team here.

248
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,325
Plus, you know, I'm the one
who's gonna be doing all the extra work.

249
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,664
You know last month
you made me work so late...

250
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,501
...I missed saying goodbye
to my Gam Gam?

251
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,875
- Sorry, what?
- My grandmother.

252
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,715
I told you I needed to see her
because she was very sick.

253
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,720
You said if I left early, I'd get fired.

254
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,007
And she died
before I made it to the hospital.

255
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,968
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

256
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:27,562
I had no idea that you called
your grandmother "Gam Gam."

257
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,570
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

258
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,899
I'm sorry you didn't get to
say bye-bye to Gam Gam.

259
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,444
Really, I really am. I'm sorry.

260
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,286
But I needed you to work late because you
are an invaluable member of this operation.

261
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,497
And I need you in the position you're in.

262
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,583
Well, tough shit, okay?

263
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,960
Been in that position for eight years. Why
would I stay after being treated like this?

264
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,176
Well, because I'd make sure that nobody
in the industry would ever hire you again.

265
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,465
Bullshit.

266
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,010
No, because they're gonna want
my letter of recommendation, right?

267
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:09,775
So I'm perfectly willing to write that
you are an insubordinate, dishonest drunk.

268
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,151
You can't do that. That's not true.

269
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,693
Let me tell you something,
you stupid little runt.

270
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,452
I own you.

271
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,079
You're my bitch.

272
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,286
Don't walk around thinking
you have free will because you don't.

273
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,793
I can crush you any time I want.

274
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:34,128
So settle in because you are here
for the long haul.

275
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,816
Yo, dickwall.

276
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,902
- What the fuck?
- What?

277
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,322
Three hours late. What's the deal?

278
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,901
- I was at your father's funeral.
- Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

279
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,038
Maybe that excuse would have flown when
my dad was here, but I'm in charge now.

280
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,995
That excuse wouldn't make any sense
if your dad was still here.

281
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,704
Whoa.

282
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,869
In my office, now.

283
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,670
Yes?

284
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,047
All right, sit.

285
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,712
- I'm not a dog, Bobby.
- Good boy.

286
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,132
I've been looking through the books.
You're the accountant. Tell me...

287
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,926
...why is this company in the crapper?
Well, we're not.

288
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,346
- It's a recession, but we're still profitable.
- Bullshit.

289
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,105
Look, I know you and my dad
were pals.

290
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:36,566
Frankly, I always thought
it was, uh, weird, it was gay.

291
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,196
- Do you know what that word means?
- Yeah, it's dick on dick.

292
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,528
It ain't my bag.
I thought it was a little bit weird...

293
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,035
...that my dad thought
you were so fucking special.

294
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,537
But that doesn't matter now,
he's in the ground.

295
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,540
I'm your boss. And there's gonna be
some changes around here.

296
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,793
- Can't wait to hear them.
- First things first.

297
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,578
Hospital bills, Larry Murinsky.

298
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,044
Why the fuck are we paying his hospital
bills, he doesn't even work here?

299
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,210
He doesn't work here because he had
a horrible accident in our warehouse.

300
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,630
- All right? The guy burned off half his face.
- Exactly.

301
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,174
I don't want my money
going to support monsters.

302
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,470
He's not a monster. He's a great guy
who worked for us for many, many years.

303
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,356
Cut him off. Second.

304
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,397
EnviroTech Waste Management.
It's costing us a lot of money.

305
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,982
Your dad chose to dispose
of our waste responsibly.

306
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,988
To do that, you gotta spend money.

307
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,866
Fuck that. The Bolivians are gonna do it
for a third of the price.

308
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,993
- I'm gonna hire them.
- No, you can't go to them.

309
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,825
I Will. I think I Will.

310
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,864
They're gonna endanger
local residents.

311
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,285
Oh, I give a fuck some tribesman
gets cancer. Cry me a fucking river.

312
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,294
They're not tribesmen.
It's a modern society.

313
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,875
Do I look like I fucking care?

314
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,502
Your dad told me very clearly
he would rather die...

315
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,542
...than save money
and hurt people, okay?

316
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,259
Well, guess what, looks like
we're right on schedule, doesn't it?

317
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,592
What else? Gotta trim
some of the fat around here.

318
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,886
What do you mean by "trim the fat"?

319
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,271
- I want you to fire the fat people.
- What?

320
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,978
They're lazy, and slow
and they make me sad to look at.

321
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,314
You can start with Large Marge.
Marge, can you come in here, please?

322
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,481
No, Margie's not fat, she's pregnant.
I'm not gonna fire her.

323
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,069
Well, fine. Uh...

324
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,735
...stay where you are, Marge.
Congratulations.

325
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:11,373
- You can fire, uh, Professor Xavier.
- Who are you talking about?

326
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,083
- You mean Hank?
- Yeah.

327
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,462
He creeps me out, rolling around
all day in his special secret chair.

328
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,668
- He's up to something.
- I won't fire anyone.

329
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,878
- You're not? Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

330
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,464
It's like you don't care
about this company at all.

331
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:28,177
No fucking shit I don't care about
this company. This is just an ATM to me.

332
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,809
You think when I was a kid I dreamed
of running a fucking chemical company?

333
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:36,064
No. I dreamed of being on a beach
with a model sewing me tropical drinks.

334
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,771
That's what I dreamed of.
That's what's gonna happen...

335
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:43,655
...as soon as I squeeze the profit out
of this company. But first things first.

336
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,867
You either fire the fatty or you fire the
cripple, or I fire all three of you.

337
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:53,411
Decision is yours. You can phone a friend,
ask the audience, fifty-fifty.

338
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,952
Do the math.
One loses the job or three loses it.

339
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,876
Your call.
I think I know who you're gonna fire.

340
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,172
And tell him to leave his handicap
parking pass when he leaves.

341
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,344
You can't take that.
It's issued by the state, Bobby.

342
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,097
Well, this is...
You're looking at the state.

343
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,725
The State of Bobbyville.

344
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,352
- Okay? Deal with it.
- That would be a town, Bobby.

345
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,558
United States of Me.

346
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,564
- Okay, there we go.
- It's all here.

347
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,372
- Hey, Hank, how you doing, man?
- Good, what's up?

348
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,748
Um ...

349
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,918
We're going through a real tough time...

350
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,955
...financially and...

351
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,135
We're gonna have to let you go.

352
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,629
Shit.

353
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,263
- I'm sorry.
- Everyone.

354
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,096
Uh, can I have your attention, please?
I have an announcement to make.

355
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:03,894
I've just learned that Kurt
has fired our dear friend Hank here.

356
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,067
I just want you all to know that I am just
as shocked and angered as you all are.

357
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,575
- What are you doing?
- Please.

358
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,203
Enough out of you already today.
My dad...

359
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,364
...on the day of his funeral.

360
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,579
This is an accounting department decision.
My hands are tied.

361
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,587
I'm sorry. You are one cold,
heartless bastard, Buckman.

362
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,423
- Hank, this wasn't my idea.
- Fuck you, Kurt.

363
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,901
Come in.

364
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,995
Julia, you needed to see me? Oh, shit.

365
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,537
Uh-oh.

366
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,415
- Will you have a seat, Dale?
- Do I have to?

367
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,420
Please.

368
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,762
Sure.

369
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,139
This is a little ridiculous, but...

370
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:23,898
Look, Dale, you know, I know that
I like to fool around at work. Right?

371
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,310
And I might even... You know,
I might even cross the line a bit.

372
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,151
But the last thing that I wanna do
is make you uncomfortable.

373
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,279
I mean, it's just not professional.
You know?

374
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,821
And I pride myself
on being a professional.

375
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:42,584
So from now on, what I would like you
to do is just tell me, you know...

376
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,087
...when and if, uh, I cross the line. Okay?

377
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,668
Okay. Now.

378
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,212
What?

379
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,878
Well, now,
you're kind of crossing a line...

380
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,138
...because you're naked.

381
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,844
Uh ...

382
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,392
Not naked, Dale.

383
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,725
- Can you see my pussy?
- Hmm.

384
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,358
True. Um ...

385
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:12,272
But I think, uh, even really
saying the word "pussy" is...

386
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,440
- That's crossing the line?
- Little bit.

387
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,701
You're starting to sound like
a little faggot.

388
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,580
There we go. That one's another one,
probably illegal thing to say too.

389
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:25,835
Okay. Let's not talk about illegal,
Mr. I-Like-To-Pee-On-Little-Boys.

390
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,542
It was an empty playground
in the middle of the night.

391
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,082
Ah. That's weirder. Poor child
must have been terrified.

392
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,502
There were no children. No kids in the park.
Why do people think that?

393
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,889
You know what? Forget it. Listen, let's
just out to the chase, all right, mister?

394
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,971
- You're engaged now.
- Right.

395
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,730
And I respect the institution of
marriage way too much to violate it.

396
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,893
So that's why you're gonna have to
fuck me well before the wedding.

397
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,822
Because the closer we get to this date,
the less ladylike I'm gonna feel about it.

398
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,324
Julia, I'm not gonna sleep with you.

399
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,907
We'll see about that.

400
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,744
Get out.

401
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,418
Could you do the, uh...?

402
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,678
I'm a sucker.
Harken wasn't gonna promote me.

403
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,557
That coked-up prick
is gonna ruin Pellit Chemicals.

404
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,597
He's just gonna fire everybody.

405
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,729
She stood there with her breasts
right in my face.

406
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,015
Yeah, you know,
yours doesn't sound that bad.

407
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,774
I'll stop bringing it up.

408
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,981
I don't understand
why you guys don't quit.

409
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,613
Julia's the only one who'd hire me.
Are you registered sex offenders?

410
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,652
Going to school, changing fields, starting
from the bottom. Who wants to do that?

411
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,789
What do I care about protecting
Pellit's name when his own son doesn't?

412
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:48,042
- Gotta be a million jobs out there.
- You could find another job.

413
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,623
- Is this really happening? Look at this.
- Oh!

414
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,256
The Three Musketeers. Nick, Kurt and Dale.
Look, hanging like high school.

415
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,667
Oh, shit.

416
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,005
- Kenny's here.
- What's up?

417
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,295
- Yeah, I love this.
- Kenny Sommerfeld.

418
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,338
In the flesh, boys.
In the flesh.

419
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,631
Oh, my goodness.

420
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,344
Now, I heard you moved to New York,
you're working at Lehman Brothers.

421
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,638
- They, uh, hired me right out of Yale.
- Hell yeah.

422
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,308
- Smart Kenny. I love that shit.
- What are you doing here?

423
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,900
- You read the papers? They shut us down.
- Right. Sorry about that.

424
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,359
I've been looking for work
for the last two years.

425
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,570
I can't even get a job waiting tables.

426
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,659
You waiting tables. I don't buy that.

427
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,617
Kenny Sommerfeld, you were voted
"Most Likely to Succeed," weren't you?

428
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,498
- I mean, everyone thought you were set.
- Everybody including me!

429
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,335
I'll tell you what though.

430
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,666
I would fucking murder those
Lehman Brothers if I could.

431
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,502
- I don't blame you.
- I bet.

432
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,510
Line them up, and I would put one bullet
through the three of their heads.

433
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,295
- That would do it.
- Heh.

434
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,806
- Take it easy, Kenny.
- No, you guys don't understand, okay.

435
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:49,516
I was making the high six figures, and now,
ha, I can't even pay for this fucking drink.

436
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,932
- You can't?
- Well, we'll cover it, right? Dale's got it.

437
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,226
- Seriously, yeah?
- Uh, I actually can't cover it.

438
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,065
- I'll do it.
- Will you spot him?

439
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,229
Got some extra, maybe throw my way?

440
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,612
- Beyond the drink?
- Maybe some extra scratch, if you got it.

441
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,743
- Of course.
- Can you cover me? Just because...

442
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,200
- And I'll get you next time I see you.
- Cool, thank you.

443
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,536
Kenny, I had no idea
it was that bad, buddy.

444
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,247
- Do you have change for a 10?
- No, I don't.

445
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,458
You know what? That's probably
not gonna cut it, so I'll tell you what.

446
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,498
How about I give you guys
some hand jobs?

447
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,007
- What is it?
- Huh?

448
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,589
Forty bucks a piece.
We'll do it right here in the bathroom.

449
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,720
All right, you guys
are driving a hard bargain.

450
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,177
Since I know you,
I'll let you stare into my eyes.

451
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,310
- I'll do the three of you for a hundred.
- Kenny, are you gay now?

452
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,721
- No, I'm not gay!
- You just do gay stuff.

453
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,608
I'm the opposite of gay.
Now, come on. What do you say?

454
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,814
Handies for the Three Musketeers.

455
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,490
Come on. You know what?
I'll hit the three of you at the same time.

456
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,400
Dale, I'm gonna deal with you
right here behind my knee.

457
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,410
Nobody's doing that, you're gonna love it.
You two, I'm gonna rock you.

458
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,742
Nordic style.
You know what they're saying right now?

459
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,374
They're saying my hands
are rated four stars.

460
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:56,254
Four stars wrapped around your stick,
pop the thumb, nick the top. Nick the top.

461
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,586
- Nick the top, nick the top, pecker spit.
- You been drinking all day, Kenny?

462
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,127
Look at me. I know what I'm doing
down there. Nobody will ever know.

463
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,012
Hey! Come on, man.
I thought I told you to stay out of here.

464
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,299
I gotta go. But listen,
if you guys change your mind...

465
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,638
...I'm staying at my mom's house. Mm.

466
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,350
For an extra hundred, I'll let you
guys pool your mayonnaise...

467
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,607
...right here in my bellybutton. You'll love it.
Think about it. Ugh, ugh! Yes!

468
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
I'll be at my mom's.

469
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,105
Okay.

470
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,029
Oh, Kenny.

471
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,401
That dude banged all three of my sisters.

472
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,947
He might be looking for your brother now,
you know.

473
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,040
Maybe don't quit your job.

474
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,462
I guess we'll be miserable
for the rest of our lives? That's the deal?

475
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,173
- That's the way it's looking.
- Why you saying that?

476
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,958
We don't have many options, do we?

477
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,086
Think about it, we can quit our jobs
and turn into Kenny...

478
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,507
...or, uh, keep our jobs
and just become spineless losers...

479
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,893
...that spend their entire day
dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.

480
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,645
- You do that too?
- Of course.

481
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,977
- Sounds a little sick.
- It's not- It's just a way to blow off steam...

482
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,484
It's not like we're gonna
actually kill our bosses.

483
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,111
- Good.
- Ha, ha. Though you would have to admit...

484
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,319
...that our lives would be a lot easier
if our bosses weren't alive.

485
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,529
Mm-hm.

486
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:12,322
Hypothetically, if we could do it and none
of us get caught, would you guys do it?

487
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,289
- No.
- I would.

488
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,825
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

489
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,243
- You would?
- Yeah.

490
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,709
It's not murder if it's justified.
Justifiable homicide, right?

491
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,214
I can't wait to hear this.

492
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,091
If one evil person dies
for the greater good, so be it.

493
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,426
You know, Bobby Pellit is an absolute
monster. He's a fucking jerk.

494
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,934
If he has his way, he's gonna end up
killing thousands of innocent Bolivians.

495
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,140
What?

496
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,600
Technically, I think it's immoral
not to kill him.

497
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,687
I should kill Harken for not letting me
say goodbye to Gam Gam?

498
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,817
Yes. Yes, you should.

499
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,820
But I don't care how bad our bosses are.
We're not murderers.

500
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,482
Julia is ruining your life, you know?
That's wrong.

501
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,368
- That is wrong.
- It's affecting your possible marriage.

502
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,872
- Come on, she's not ruining it.
- Would your life be easier without Julia?

503
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,782
You're right.
Uh, know what I'm gonna do?

504
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,577
I'm gonna go to Julia's house,
maybe I'll slash her up...

505
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,373
...and I'll put her in a box and I'll mail
it to you two, uh, tough-guy mafiosos.

506
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,339
I'm done with this conversation. You're
paying for dinner because you've upset me.

507
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,050
You're paying
and I'm finding a cab somehow.

508
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,807
I was just speaking hypothetically,
you know.

509
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,718
Me too.

510
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,848
Guess who.

511
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,608
Look, I'm really kind of
not in the mood for this.

512
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,356
Not in the mood for what?

513
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:26,778
- Hi.
- Hi, babe.

514
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,530
Oh, what are you doing here?

515
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,738
- I invited her.
- Yes. She called.

516
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,280
And she said that now that we're engaged,
she wanted to offer me free dental work.

517
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,416
- And you know I have that loose filling.
- Yeah.

518
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,577
This really was so, so sweet of you, Julia.

519
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,212
Oh, please. Come on, Stacy,
it's my pleasure.

520
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,873
You're part of the family now.

521
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,175
But, um, I don't know
if it's a good idea, sweetie.

522
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,093
Oh, why not?

523
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,606
Because we're mixing pleasure
with business. Business and pleasure.

524
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,391
We're taking advantage of Julia.

525
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,442
Dale.

526
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,482
There's nothing that you could do ever
that would be taking advantage of me.

527
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,450
- Okay?
- So sweet.

528
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,121
All right, you. Let's go say
we pump you full of gas, huh?

529
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,491
- Okay.
- Okay.

530
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,877
Fuck me.

531
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,959
Ten.

532
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,798
Nine.

533
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,177
I don't know
what you're doing with your hand.

534
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,804
- Okay.
- Seven.

535
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,466
Put your hand in a safe place
because there's sharp tools here.

536
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,101
Oh, there she goes.

537
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,271
- Come here!
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

538
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,151
You're gonna give me that dong, Dale.

539
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,523
My dong?

540
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,653
You're gonna fuck my slutty little mouth.

541
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,986
Do you hear the words you say sometimes?
I mean, who talks like that?

542
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,743
Let's have sex on top of her.
Let's use her like a bed.

543
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,031
Get down, get down. Hey, hey!
Get off of her.

544
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,418
Goddamn you! That's it, okay?
You know what? That's crossing the line.

545
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,078
So I'm done, Julia.

546
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,840
Fuck this. I'm out. I don't need this job.
So goodbye, I'm quitting. I'm done.

547
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,671
I'm gonna tell her you fucked me.

548
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,423
What?

549
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,338
If you don't fuck me,
I'm gonna tell her that you fucked me.

550
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,017
Okay. Tell her whatever the hell you want.
She's not gonna believe you.

551
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,349
She already knows
that you're a sex offender.

552
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,728
And I think once she gets a look
at these...

553
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,518
...she's gonna believe me.

554
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,980
- What is that?
- Do you remember your first week here?

555
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,399
When I changed the crown
on your second bicuspid?

556
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,691
Yeah.

557
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:41,368
Well, I just, uh, took a few pictures
of the procedure.

558
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,453
DALE; on, my God.
Right?

559
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,035
Oh, no. What?

560
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,496
Oh. Ooh.

561
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,415
You did all this
while I was unconscious?

562
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,504
Ooh. Mm-hm. Yep.

563
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,175
That's my favorite.

564
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,384
- Rape.
- What?

565
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,720
Rape. That's a rape.
This is what raping is.

566
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,476
You're a raper and you've raped me.
That's a rape! Rape!

567
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,058
Just relax there, Jodie Foster.

568
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,023
Your dick wasn't even hard.

569
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,899
That does not give me any relief.

570
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,777
But it will be next time,
and if it is not...

571
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:17,487
...this little sweetheart right here is
gonna get a peek at my little photo album.

572
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:23,618
So please prep the patient
for the bitewing x-ray.

573
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,116
I'll be back in a jiffy.

574
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,213
I'm in. Let's kill this bitch!

575
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,725
- What bitch?
- "What bitch"? Guys, my boss.

576
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:47,138
Our bosses need to die. You were right,
man. We should do this thing.

577
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,353
We were drinking last night.
You said that killing is wrong.

578
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,770
I know. That was before Julia tried to fuck
me on top of Stacy's unconscious body.

579
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,062
- Really?
- Yes, dude.

580
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,608
She's gone fucking batshit crazy.
She took a bunch of photographs of me...

581
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,449
- Where are they?
- They'll ruin my life. I can't show them.

582
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,455
- It's a whole thing. You guys in or out?
- I was in last night.

583
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,662
- Nick, what do you say?
- Please. Let's go.

584
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,871
Nick, come on.

585
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,288
Seriously. I mean, uh, what about
your grandma, you know? Bubbe.

586
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,751
- Gam Gam.
- Whatever it is.

587
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,008
She didn't get to say goodbye
to her grandson.

588
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,010
Because his dickbag of a boss
wouldn't let him leave. Right?

589
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,469
- What would Gam Gam want you to do?
- She wouldn't want me to kill him.

590
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,510
Okay, forget about Gam Gam.
She's dead. You gotta accept that.

591
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,519
This is about you, Nick.
Okay, what do you want?

592
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,597
Well, obviously I want him gone.

593
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,516
- Exactly. So let's do this.
- Right?

594
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,977
- How do we do this?
- I thought about that.

595
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,647
Stacy and I, we watch a ton of Law & Order.
Huge Law & Order buffs.

596
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,909
There's all sorts of ways the bad
guys on the show mess up, right?

597
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,946
They leave behind skin cells
and, uh, bullet casing...

598
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,159
Sperm.

599
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,415
- Most of the time, it's sperm.
- Silent killer.

600
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,450
Anyway, that's not the point.
Point is...

601
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,666
...we're not qualified.
We gotta hire a professional.

602
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,838
- Are you talking about a hit man?
- Yeah.

603
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,999
That's a really good idea.

604
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,669
Yeah. We don't clean
our own apartments or cut our own hair.

605
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,463
- No, we pay someone to do that.
- Yeah.

606
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,640
Well, I don't actually. Stacy cuts my hair.

607
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,934
- She does?
- Yeah.

608
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,687
- She have training for that?
- Doesn't need it.

609
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,143
She might.

610
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,891
And where are you
gonna find a hit man?

611
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,186
Why don't you guys
leave that up to me, okay?

612
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,650
I got this whole thing figured out.

613
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:24,319
I'm gonna give you a call tomorrow,
I'm gonna tell you where to meet me.

614
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,031
Why don't you just tell us now?

615
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,334
I don't have it all figured out.
I got some of it figured out.

616
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,335
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go home and start.

617
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,168
Okay. All right. I'm gonna go home too.

618
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,676
- Well, you are. This is your house here.
- Oh. I couldn't tell that by the way you go...

619
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,714
...in and out of my fridge
drinking all my fucking beer.

620
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,885
- No, no.
- Enjoy.

621
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,121
- Were you followed?
- Why would I be followed?

622
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,409
People follow people in these types
of situations. Sure you weren't?

623
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,622
Oh, boy. What people?

624
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,912
Just take one quick look around,
make sure.

625
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,501
- Let's put this down.
- Look around, make sure some...

626
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,416
- Calm down!
- That's what you get.

627
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,836
Shut the door, take the chain off
and let me in.

628
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,925
- I pissed him off already.
- Already?

629
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,058
What the hell's going on, huh?
What are we doing here?

630
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,890
I don't want an assassin
in my apartment.

631
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,271
Don't want this guy knowing
where we live.

632
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,979
Hang on, you guys already went ahead
and found someone and he's coming here?

633
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,439
- Oh, bigtime.
- Not "we." Dale, all by himself.

634
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:44,277
- It was easy. Easy as buying a used futon.
- You found a hit man online?

635
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,862
Yeah. They don't write "hit man,"
right? That's dumb.

636
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,450
They use code words, like wet work,
right? Liquidation. Check him out.

637
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,910
"Skilled professional
with years of experience..."

638
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,075
...in domestic and international
wet work.

639
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,336
"Discreet. No children,
no political figures."

640
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,464
That last part was important. I saw that,
I thought, "This is a good idea."

641
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,921
I feel we should've got
a cheese plate for this guy.

642
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,301
- 20/20 hindsight.
- Is that him?

643
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,134
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, that was definitely a car.

644
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,145
- He looks like James Bond.
- He really does, dude.

645
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:19,308
Bet he carries a gun you screw together.
Those are, like, the coolest guns they make.

646
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,693
So dangerous.
What if that is an undercover cop?

647
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,398
- Come on.
- What if it's the real thing?

648
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,532
He charges so much we can't
afford it, gets pissed, kills us.

649
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,442
- Kills all three of us? Hold on.
- That's a thing?

650
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,655
Could that happen?

651
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,488
- Gotta let him in.
- How's my hair?

652
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,703
- What do you mean?
- It doesn't matter. Let's do this. Okay.

653
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,412
Ready?

654
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,671
Yeah?

655
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,006
Are you Dale?

656
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,883
- I am the one they call Dale.
- Hmm.

657
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,142
Please come in.

658
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,144
Thank you.

659
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,025
Are all three of you participating in this?

660
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,275
- Yes.
- Well, um ...

661
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,312
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yep.
- Yes.

662
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,105
Very well.

663
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,991
Now, before we go any further...

664
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,620
...I need to know if there are
any hidden recording devices in the room.

665
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,701
I will find out if there are.

666
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:19,494
I'm sure you would, but there's none
because that would be stupid of us.

667
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,707
- That's a silly move.
- It's a no.

668
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,503
Then let's get started.

669
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,836
- I love this guy.
- This is the real deal.

670
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,005
- His voice, you kidding?
- This guy is legit.

671
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:35,426
And you do know that
we just wanna start with a...?

672
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,762
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait, what's this for?

673
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,396
- For the mess.
- What?

674
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,148
Wouldn't wanna leave a stain, now.

675
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,309
- Oh, my God. I knew it.
- Who's first?

676
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,820
- "Who's first"? No.
- We don't want you to kill us.

677
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,107
We want you to kill another person.
If anyone's first, probably him.

678
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,320
No. Goddamn it.

679
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,952
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what are you talking about?

680
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,912
Your ad said you do wet work.

681
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,073
That's correct.

682
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,208
I urinate on other men for money.

683
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,914
- What was that?
- What'd he say?

684
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,704
I think he said he pisses on dudes.

685
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,500
Why else do you think my ad was
in the "men seeking men" section?

686
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:09,964
Where was it?

687
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,003
- You fucking idiot.
- Could you be dumber?

688
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,390
- Why look in the "men seeking men"...?
- We are men looking for a man!

689
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,471
How do people
let you work on their teeth?

690
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,012
They don't, actually.
I just hand the tools to Julia.

691
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,607
Are you telling me that I've driven all
this way and nobody wants to get pissed on?

692
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,268
Uh-uh.
- Well, it's not our thing.

693
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,435
Sorry about that.

694
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,947
Can I use your toilet? I stored up
rather a large amount of pee for this.

695
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,905
Sure. Yeah, it's right through there.
Knock yourself out.

696
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,911
Oh, and by the way,
I still will want my $200.

697
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,367
- Understandable.
- We insist.

698
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,783
- Two hundred, huh? A bargain.
- To kill three people?

699
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,418
- I thought it was such a good deal.
- Dipshit. Unbelievable.

700
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,038
I'll be in the car.

701
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,298
Okay, but you guys
are gonna chip in for the...

702
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,005
Am I gonna have to give him
all my money?

703
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,675
Sir, I'm going to leave your money
on the bed.

704
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,518
God, he would have drenched us.

705
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,856
Okay, I'm gonna
take the blame on that one.

706
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,567
- You bet your ass you will.
- You should take the blame.

707
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,574
- It was an honest mistake.
- That's not how you find a killer.

708
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,282
- Oh, you know how to find a killer?
- Yeah, I bet I...

709
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,697
Yeah, hey, you know what?
Yeah. I got an idea.

710
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,989
What are you doing?

711
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,157
What are you doing?

712
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,325
Good evening, Mr. Buckman.

713
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,711
Thank you for contacting Nav Guide.
My name is Gregory.

714
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,622
How may I be of service this evening?

715
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,668
Yeah, we're looking for the most dangerous
bar in the city. Can you help us, please?

716
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,677
- We're going to dinner.
- I'm sorry?

717
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:38,340
Looking for a bar filled with criminals.
Lowlife thugs, hard-core shitheads.

718
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,850
- What do you got for us?
- Let's go to a restaurant.

719
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,730
I'm afraid our listings
are not organized by danger, sir.

720
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,858
I see there's an Applebee's
three blocks from your location.

721
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,563
- Perfect.
- No, not really helpful.

722
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,400
They're not the kind of shitheads
we need. Anything else?

723
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,439
I could direct you
to a neighborhood...

724
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,279
...with the greatest
number of cadackings.

725
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,240
- Now we're thinking outside the box.
- I wanna go to dinner.

726
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,904
- Love it.
- That's probably right.

727
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,290
- Very good, sir.
- You may wish to lock your doors.

728
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,129
- This is worse than getting pissed on.
- Shh.

729
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,293
- I'd rather be pissed on.
- Jesus.

730
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,179
You weren't kidding, Gregory.
This is, uh, a bad part of town.

731
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,636
You can stay on the line.
You're still there?

732
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,769
- I'm still here, sir.
- Just keep, uh, keep us on the line.

733
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:27,272
I'm always curious about these things,
but is your real name Gregory?

734
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,560
Uh, no, sir. My real name is Atmanand.

735
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,069
How do you get Gregory from that?

736
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,526
Oh. Gregory was assigned to me...

737
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,191
- .-.by Nev Guide-
- Why not let you use your real name?

738
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,578
They say many Americans
find our real names hard to pronounce.

739
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,704
I'm not gonna play
by their rules anymore.

740
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,911
From now on,
I'm gonna call you Ahmenan.

741
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,951
- Atmanand.
- Ammenand.

742
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,915
- Atmanad.
- Atmanand.

743
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,581
I'm gonna call you Gregory,
that name's a nightmare.

744
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,875
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, boy.

745
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,759
- You hurt his feelings.
- I didn't.

746
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,920
You have arrived at your destination, sir.

747
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:02,432
- All right. Well, thanks, Gregory.
- You're welcome.

748
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,266
All right. All right, here we go.

749
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,977
- This is a really bad idea.
- This is a great idea.

750
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,317
- Gonna yell "anybody here kill for money"?
- No.

751
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,733
- That's a terrible plan.
- Follow me. I got this.

752
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,277
- Where you going?
- I don't feel we should stay.

753
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,070
All right.

754
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,291
- Bowflex?
- Shut up.

755
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,920
Ah.

756
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,290
My man.

757
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,795
Hey, uh, does anyone here
kill people for money?

758
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,463
- Kurt.
- The fuck you just say?

759
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,051
No, it's not a race thing.

760
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,468
Uh, I believe that society discriminates
and disenfranchises you folks.

761
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,886
- "You folks"?
- Subtle.

762
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,647
Man, I'm a small-business owner.
Who the hell you calling disenfranchised?

763
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,979
Well, not you in particular,
in that instance.

764
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,895
- Oh, right. You mean all black people.
- Yes.

765
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,234
- I'm gonna be in the car.
- Oh, a baseball bat.

766
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,571
Uh, I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry if that's what happened.

767
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,577
My heart's in the right place.

768
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,330
In five seconds, your heart
gonna be in the wrong place.

769
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,162
- Four, three, two, let's roll.
- Got it. Okay. Take care.

770
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,952
Have a nice day. Good day to you.

771
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,870
Bye, baby.

772
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,841
Don't say a word. I know, I know.

773
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,593
Hit the button. Hit the button.

774
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,880
- Guys, I don't know. Should we quit?
- Yeah, definitely.

775
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,674
- Yo. Think I can help you boys.
- Is that for us?

776
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,344
- Here we go.
- Not interested, thank you.

777
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,557
Hey, hey, hey.

778
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,058
Let's follow a strange guy
into a dark corner.

779
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,775
Somebody said y'all looking
for somebody to help with business.

780
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,161
- Yep.
- Well, um...

781
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,037
...are you a businessman?
Yeah.

782
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,698
Motherfucker Jones.

783
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,452
- How's that?
- Motherfucker Jones.

784
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:57,126
Your first name is Motherfucker?

785
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,792
Not Motherfucker. Motherfuckah.
White people say "er."

786
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,257
Negroes say "fuckah."

787
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,547
- Got it.
- You say E-R. I say A-H.

788
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,384
Cool name. Yeah. Is that,
like, on your birth certificate too?

789
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,893
No, goofball.

790
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,103
My real name is Dean.

791
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,981
Dean Jones. Same name of
the actor in Herbie, the Love Bug.

792
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,357
He won't know who that is.

793
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,565
- I know who he is, bitch.
- Sorry.

794
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,322
I can't walk around in this fucking
neighborhood with that Disney-ass name.

795
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,233
How'd you get the name
Motherfucker?

796
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,070
When I was a kid, I snuck
into my mother's bedroom.

797
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,488
- Ooh.
Uh-Oh.

798
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,502
- She was sleeping on the bed.
- She had been drinking all night.

799
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,629
- I've heard enough.
- Her skin was glistening.

800
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,509
- And I snuck up behind hen
- Dean.

801
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,586
And I slipped my fingers...

802
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,049
Ahh.

803
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,882
- ...Into her purse.
- Purse? He said "purse."

804
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,932
- And I took all of her money.
- And it was her week's pay.

805
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,937
- I really fucked her over.
- Motherfucker!

806
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,646
And that's how I got the name
Motherfucker Jones.

807
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,855
Right.

808
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,988
They should call you Motherfucker-Over
Jones to avoid confusion.

809
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,274
- What's the confusion?
- There's no confusion.

810
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,614
We're gonna get back on track here.
Sir, we each have a boss, uh...

811
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,777
...that, you know...

812
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,915
There's three bosses, and it would be best
if those bosses maybe were no longer ...

813
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,243
- No longer around anymore.
- We want them...

814
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,504
You know?
...killed.

815
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,622
You got the cheese?

816
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,843
We got the cheese.
What kind of cheese are you thinking?

817
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,721
- What is that, three hits? That's ...
- Yeah.

818
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,309
- Thirty large.
- Whoa.

819
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,641
- Hungry.
- That's a lot of cheese.

820
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,975
Oh, here's an idea.

821
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,891
If you kill two, could we get
the third one hold the cheese?

822
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,278
It's no negotiations.
Thirty large or nothing.

823
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,861
- That's more cheese than we've got-
- Okay, then- It's five large now.

824
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,362
Then We're in. We're in. We're in. Right?

825
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,657
Hang on. Wouldn't it be awful
if it was traceable back to us?

826
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,166
I don't even know your names.

827
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,248
- That is rude. This is Dale.
- Don't say my name.

828
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,290
Shut the fuck up. Listen. Bring the money
here tomorrow, I'll take care of the rest.

829
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,335
Do you want it in something specific,
a shoebox, duffel bag?

830
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,879
- Just be here with the fucking money.
- Yeah.

831
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,423
- Put it in a briefcase.
- Thanks for your time.

832
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,636
Here we go.

833
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,016
Is the briefcase coming out of your end?

834
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,572
Looks like it's all there.

835
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,110
Didn't even need a briefcase.
It's a smell stack.

836
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,950
- We should have used a manila envelope.
- It's all right.

837
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,992
What is your projected outside date
of completion, Motherfucker?

838
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,120
Ah.

839
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,256
I just got back from doing a dime
for some real nasty shit.

840
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,962
- That's 10 years.
- I know.

841
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,254
They're looking at me. I'm on probation,
and if I step out of line...

842
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,344
...I'm going back.

843
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,268
- Right.
- Understood.

844
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,646
- Period? End of story?
- What does that mean?

845
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,274
- Wait. You said you'd take care of this.
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

846
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,862
I'm gonna be your murder consultant.

847
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,778
I'm sorry, but, uh ...

848
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:39,663
- No, man. Right? That's not cool.
- You don't shut this fucking hamster up ...

849
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,868
- Don't call me a hamster now. Come on.
- Easy, easy.

850
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,284
- It's just upsetting.
- No, it's somewhat accurate.

851
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,498
Look, that is not what we talked about,
Motherfucker.

852
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,665
So how about we just take the money
and we'll get out of here?

853
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,832
How about you go fuck yourself?
No refunds.

854
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,674
That's $5000. If you think we're just gonna
walk out and let you keep that...

855
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,510
I think you're forgetting...
Don't go grabbing quickly.

856
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,674
Jesus.

857
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,219
Mr. Motherfucker, please,
don't shoot us. Let's just talk it out.

858
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,684
Listen, $5000 is mine.
I don't care what you say.

859
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,190
You can take my advice
or get the fuck out of here.

860
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,522
- That's a terrible deal.
- We should listen.

861
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,653
- Okay, $5000 worth of advice?
- Yeah.

862
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,234
Most killers are first-timers.

863
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,947
You wanna pull off a brilliant murder,
you gotta act like it's an accident.

864
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,204
Failed brakes, gas leaks, suicide.

865
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,411
You do it right, you ain't even
gotta be there when it goes down.

866
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,167
Oh, boy. That's five grand worth, huh?

867
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,338
- Pretty pedestrian.
- Not really. Obvious information, isn't it?

868
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,796
Sounds like Scooby-Doo. How are we
supposed to fake three accidents?

869
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,050
You stalk your prey.

870
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,385
Gotta be smart. Find out where they live,
find out their habits. What's their hobbies?

871
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,300
What they like, what food they like,
who they fucking.

872
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,184
- Word.
- Find them vulnerable.

873
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,768
I have a job, you know?
What's that, surveillance and recon?

874
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,560
That's why we were hiring, because
we wanna sub that out. We have jobs.

875
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,320
Even if you pull it off perfectly...

876
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,068
...if you crackers got motives...

877
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,232
...the popo...

878
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,447
- That's police.
- ...will pin it to you.

879
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,237
We all have clear motives
for killing our bosses...

880
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,408
...so this is not gonna work.
This is garbage.

881
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,080
I got it.

882
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,128
Why don't you kill each other's bosses?

883
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,465
- That's actually a good idea.
- It's not bad.

884
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,130
Yeah, like Hitchcock's
Strangers on a Train, right?

885
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,221
- I didn't see that. They do that?
- Danny DeVito movie. It's funny.

886
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,933
That famous Alfred Hitchcock, Danny
DeVito movie. That's the one he's...

887
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,393
Come on. You're thinking of
Throw Momma From the Train.

888
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,604
- That's what it is.
- That I saw.

889
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,895
Good movie.
That's what you're thinking about.

890
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:38,406
Same idea, though. We kill
each other's bosses, there's no link to us.

891
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,817
Exactly. Five thousand dollars
well spent, right?

892
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,281
- No. Not at all.
- Waste of money.

893
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,117
Well, too fucking bad.

894
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,576
Get out.

895
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,415
Hello.

896
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,501
Hey. I'm outside.
You ready to do a little recon?

897
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:59,009
Yep. Yeah. I have to get Harken
to let me leave a little bit early.

898
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,138
What's the difference? Not like
he'll be your boss much longer.

899
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,931
I'll be down in three minutes.

900
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,843
Three minutes it is. Bye.
He'll be down in three minutes.

901
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:11,606
- Dude, these seats are crazy comfortable.
- Look at this. I know, it's so good. Ah.

902
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,146
The worst report I have ever read
in my life, you nimwit.

903
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,027
You're such a fucking dweeb.

904
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,866
Do you have a parking space?
Because I'm gonna take it away from you.

905
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,073
Who is it, like your mother-in-law
that knows my wife?

906
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,364
How you got this fucking job,
I don't even understand.

907
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:33,790
Ugh.

908
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,959
What the hell?

909
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,255
Sorry, everybody. I've been fighting
that bug all day. Let me get back to work.

910
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:44,298
No, no, no. You're disgusting. Go home.
I don't want you getting anyone else sick.

911
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,181
Probably best.

912
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,474
Take all your work with you
and have it on my desk 6 a.m. Monday.

913
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:53,139
- You got it. Thank you, Mr. Harken.
- Jesus Christ.

914
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,525
- Don't forget to take your fucking trash can.
- Yeah. No, that's mine.

915
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,107
You goddamn barfing pig.

916
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,025
Evens are over here.

917
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,412
I know, but sometimes on some
streets evens are on the opposite side.

918
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,618
Never.

919
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,033
Never have and they never will.
There it is, 428.

920
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,793
- Which one, which one?
- Don't stop right in front of it.

921
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,705
Stop right here. Right here, right here.

922
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,334
Okay, boys.

923
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,176
We wait till Pellit makes a move,
then we tail him, all right?

924
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,931
- It is on like Donkey Kong.
- Ha, ha.

925
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,718
- Hells yeah, man.
- Here we go, huh?

926
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,059
- Fire that the other way next time, okay.
- Is my breath bad?

927
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,442
- Yeah. Find some gum or lean back.
- I had a falafel.

928
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,989
You had a shawarrna, right?
It's like a lamb mistake.

929
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,115
- Where'd you get a falafel?
- Mickey's.

930
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:48,073
- Mickey's has falafels? No kidding.
- Mm-hm.

931
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,657
Why don't you lean back?

932
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,457
Because he parked right in front of a tree.
If I lean back, I can't see the house over there.

933
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:57,246
Stop exasperating on me,
or watch your H's.

934
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,081
Through the nose stinks too, okay?

935
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:02,799
I hate that angle.

936
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,257
We should probably get lower.
If he sees three guys...

937
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,297
- Slouch down a little.
- I'm gonna get back.

938
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,592
- You're gonna back your seat up?
- If you get in your seat...

939
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,260
...I can back my seat up.

940
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,475
I don't really have a good angle from here
because there's that tree.

941
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,732
- You got a whole window to look through.
- I'm coming up.

942
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,439
- Come on, lean back.
- I like the three man thing.

943
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,437
What are you doing, Kurt?

944
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,986
- What's going on?
- He's fucking around, man.

945
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:30,779
Creating a finger web in front of your face.
Is that...? Is that like a camouflage?

946
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,118
It is his boss. I mean, he's the one
who's going to get recognized.

947
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,374
Finger-flage. It's called finger-flage.

948
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,207
Finger-flage. This is actually
a pretty damn good idea, dude.

949
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,838
Just roll up your window.
Please, I can't... I can't...

950
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,545
- Do the finger-flage.
- Let's not have jokes for two hours.

951
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,960
- This is serious business.
- This is fun.

952
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:52,134
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe how much this sucks.

953
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,849
I don't get it, man. On TV,
surveillance always looks fun, right?

954
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,686
You know, the cops, they got
the sunflower seeds and the coffee.

955
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,850
Talk about their lives and shit.
And then...

956
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,567
You know, right when someone reveals
something really intimate, the perp appears.

957
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,823
- They spring into action.
- Yeah.

958
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,578
Are we even sure this guy's home?

959
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,204
- Let's go check this out.
- Yeah, we should probably look, right?

960
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,999
Shh.

961
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,257
Oh, my God.

962
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,215
What do you wanna do?
What's the plan?

963
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:32,007
- Let's look through this window right here.
- No, no. No, let's ring the bell.

964
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,301
You're not gonna ring the bell.
Look through the window right here.

965
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,721
Chances are, he's not home.
I haven't seen any activity in this house...

966
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,857
What are you doing?
You're not gonna ring the doorbell.

967
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,617
- Come on. Come on.
- Dale, Dale, Dale.

968
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,375
I didn't make it in.

969
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,791
I'm sorry, guys. Didn't make it in.

970
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,049
You in?

971
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,712
Yeah, I'm okay. Jesus Christ,
the guy owns a fucking bear?

972
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,596
- We're breaking and entering here.
- I know. Shh. Oh, look at this.

973
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,307
Look at this place. It's awful.
It's like a douchebag museum.

974
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,557
It's like we stepped inside
the mind of an asshole.

975
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,230
Shit. He's got a foosball table.

976
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,112
Dale! Don't touch anything.
Get your hands off that.

977
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,570
- Fingerprints.
- Yeah, fingerprints.

978
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:35,077
- God. We should be wearing gloves.
- We don't have... Oh, here. I know.

979
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,078
Use your sleeves. Use your sleeves.

980
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,955
- For what?
- Use them for gloves.

981
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,084
- Come on.
- I can see my fingerprints from here.

982
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,212
- What do we do? What's the plan?
- We're here to get some intel.

983
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,248
- "Intel"'?
- It's short for "intelligence."

984
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,917
- I know what it stands for.
- Then why did you ask?

985
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,465
Why are we talking
about this? Let's split up.

986
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:56,428
In and out, in and out. We'll find something
good, and we're in and out of here.

987
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,220
- Stop chatting and start looking.
- We're committing a crime. This is a crime.

988
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,229
Whoa.

989
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,101
- Nick.
- Yeah?

990
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,771
- Now, this would count as intel, right?
- Holy shit, that's a lot of cocaine.

991
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,815
Have you ever seen this much cocaine?

992
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,109
That's gotta be worth,
what, 10, 15,000...?

993
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,913
Oh, I blew it. I blew that, didn't I?

994
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,992
Hmm.

995
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,549
- Don't inhale.
- Grab the box. I'll scoop it in.

996
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,468
I really don't wanna touch it.
I don't have sleeve-gloves.

997
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,978
Get something to... Ugh. I'll scoop it in.

998
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,389
So bitter.

999
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,814
Hmm.

1000
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,158
In the butt you go, go, go.

1001
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,752
There you go.

1002
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,000
Big scoop.

1003
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,211
All right, let me try this. Look out.

1004
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,341
- Yeah, that better work.
- Watch out.

1005
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,673
There you go.

1006
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,179
- I don't know.
- Go slow.

1007
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,887
Get on the couch. Stop helping.

1008
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,347
All right.

1009
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:30,935
In you go.

1010
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,354
Ooh.

1011
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:44,077
You probably should have
emptied the DustBuster first.

1012
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,168
Is that what you think?

1013
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,747
I was thinking that.
On account of the dust.

1014
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,720
Well, I've heard of butt floss,
but this is ridiculous. Ha, ha.

1015
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,551
- Get a sifter, or a...
- Colander.

1016
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,761
Colander would be good.

1017
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,009
And I'll start picking.

1018
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,349
That'll do.

1019
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:17,440
I feel like everything'll work out.
I'm like a machine. Look how fast I am.

1020
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,904
I'm moving super fast.
I can't even feel my nose.

1021
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,320
Wanna know what's weird?
I should be panicking...

1022
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,864
..-and I am a little,
but it's in a very good way...

1023
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,783
It's a good kind of panic
because I feel like I wanna die...

1024
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,248
...but I also feel very, very, very good.
Yeah.

1025
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,287
Hey! What are you guys doing?

1026
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,082
Nothing. But before we go,
I wanna take one more dump.

1027
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,423
Take a dump and I'm gonna
do push-ups. Because I gotta get fit.

1028
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,804
What the hell have you guys done?

1029
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,015
I'm feeling good, dude.
Wanna help me clean?

1030
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,176
We bond over this.
This is friendship stuff.

1031
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,813
We broke into someone's house.
It's the most amazing experience of my life.

1032
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:53,852
We broke into a man's house. Suddenly,
I'm like an expert at sifting cocaine.

1033
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,985
It's amazing.
Come here and help me with this.

1034
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,988
Can't believe we weren't prepared.

1035
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,490
That was completely dangerous,
a total waste of time.

1036
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:04,074
Well, no. Actually, not a total waste
of time. Look what I got.

1037
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,613
- Not bad, huh?
- What is that?

1038
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,622
- Is this his phone?
- That's his phone.

1039
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,287
- You steal this?
- I sure did.

1040
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,794
I got his contacts, schedule.
Weird pictures of him doing awesome shit.

1041
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,000
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

1042
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,459
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

1043
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,671
That's a crime. Pfft. Nope. Ha.
No one said we'd be stealing.

1044
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,508
- This is a good grab.
- We broke in! You guys did cocaine!

1045
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,640
- Right. Two... Three crimes.
- He's all jitzed out. Ignore him.

1046
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,597
We're in the process of
getting ready to kill three people...

1047
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,137
...and you're giving me shit
about stealing a phone?

1048
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,398
Run it by me
if you'll be stealing stuff.

1049
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,978
- Run it by you?
- Run it by me!

1050
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:37,236
- Nick, will you hold this for a second?
- What are you doing?

1051
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,817
"Run"? I'm not gonna run
anything by you.

1052
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,358
I'm not gonna run anything by you.
Dickhead.

1053
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,777
- There's a lot of stuff in here.
- I know.

1054
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,321
- Wanna go check out your boss now?
- Yeah, I guess we should.

1055
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,909
Okay, let's do it.

1056
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,325
- Hold on.
- You gotta take care of that.

1057
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,960
No. No!

1058
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,497
Get off me! Come on, hey!

1059
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,507
- You don't punch the driver!
- I need you back here for the brakes.

1060
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,546
Oh, shit, the brakes. I'm sorry, buddy.
I'm sorry. Don't punch the driver, Dale!

1061
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,339
I'm sorry I hit you! Get the wheel.

1062
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,509
- You don't punch the driver!
- You don't punch the fucking driver.

1063
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:12,145
I'm coked out of my fucking brain.
I'll punch whoever the fuck I want to.

1064
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,614
Let's do this, guys. Feeling good.

1065
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,455
- Be very quiet out there.
- Calm down, Dale.

1066
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,369
You know what? Hang on a second.

1067
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:39,415
Dale? Dude, hold it. Last time the three
of us did this, it was very messy.

1068
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,879
- It was awesome, exciting.
- It was clunky as hell.

1069
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:46,047
Here's what we'll do. In the event that
Harken is not here, just me and Kurt go in.

1070
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,636
You'll stay out here, not go in,
and be our lookout.

1071
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,803
What? Are you kidding me?
That's awesome. I love that. The lookout.

1072
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,097
- I don't know what the guy looks like.
- Doesn't matter.

1073
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,391
You see anybody, just assume
that it's Harken, send us a signal.

1074
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,230
- Okay? Have a seat.
- Okay.

1075
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:03,068
Okay. Send a sig...
I'm gonna honk the horn six times.

1076
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,857
- Goddamn it. No.
- Did he say "six"?

1077
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,401
- Something much more subtle.
- That's too many.

1078
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,990
- More subtle? Four honks?
- Can you honk once?

1079
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,621
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all.

1080
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,249
People honk once all the time.
You'll be in and out...

1081
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:17,457
- We'll know it's you.
- Come on, man. Dale, two honks.

1082
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,839
That kind of tone's gonna get you nowhere.
All right, two honks.

1083
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,672
- Just two honks. A little tap, tap.
- Okay.

1084
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:28,260
Two very long, very slow honks.

1085
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,511
- I'm gonna check this window over here.
- Okay.

1086
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:41,355
- There's nothing on that side.
- Yeah. I don't think there's anyone in there.

1087
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:44,316
I think he's definitely out.

1088
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,698
Maybe we can find a way in upstairs.

1089
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,281
Yeah, or maybe there's a window open.

1090
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,165
Or better yet ...

1091
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,285
That makes things easier, huh?

1092
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,546
I like the way you think. Move.

1093
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,627
- No, don't do that. Hey! God!
- Oh, shit.

1094
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,212
I broke a rock.

1095
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,002
Please tell me you realize
that was a key thingy.

1096
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,218
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1097
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,633
You weren't gonna
throw a rock through the door?

1098
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,801
No, of course not.
No, I wanted to open it.

1099
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,187
Like a real cat burglar.

1100
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,441
Wow.

1101
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:23,861
Just recon, now, okay?

1102
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:27,523
Hey, take this. I don't want it.
I want my hands free.

1103
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,487
You broke it.

1104
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,078
I feel the intel...

1105
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,952
- God!
- Okay, just a cat.

1106
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,165
Out of nowhere.

1107
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,832
Just a cat. We're all right.
Let's look upstairs. Come on.

1108
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,670
The call me hell

1109
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,176
They call me Stacey

1110
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:54,183
That's not my name
That's not my name

1111
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,467
They call me hell

1112
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,806
They call me her

1113
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,265
They call me hell

1114
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,680
They call me Stacey

1115
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,520
That's not my name
That's not my name

1116
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,244
Oh! Goddamn it.

1117
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,075
Jesus, how many oats do they have?

1118
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,366
- It's the same one, I think. Yeah.
- Really?

1119
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,867
Quick little bugger, huh?

1120
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,081
Hey.

1121
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,747
- Shit, is that Harken's wife?
- Yeah, that's her.

1122
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,211
- Oh, man, she is hot.
- She sure is. Here we go.

1123
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,503
I'd like to bend her over a barrel
and show her the 50 states.

1124
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,547
- I don't know what that means.
- Ah, it's a saying.

1125
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:37,138
- I don't think so.
- No, it is, it is. Yeah. No, people say that.

1126
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,053
- I haven't heard it.
- I've definitely heard people say that.

1127
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,439
I'm not gonna argue.
Let's continue the recon.

1128
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,521
- Well, it's definitely a phrase.
- It sure isn't.

1129
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:48,904
Yeah, it is. It's from a book.
The Great Gatsby, maybe?

1130
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,862
Let's just look for an address book
or a day planner or something. You know?

1131
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,946
You know, it's too bad we're not looking
for cats. These people fucking love cats.

1132
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,260
Hey, schmuokface.

1133
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:27,768
You Wanna tell me what you're doing
littering on my street?

1134
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,438
I think what happened, ahem, was that
the wind blew it out of my hand.

1135
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,949
I don't care if the wind
blew it out of your twat.

1136
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,283
Why don't you take this piece-of-shit car
and get off my fucking block?

1137
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:42,291
I don't know why you're mad at the car.
I don't think we should get hostile now.

1138
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,292
"Hostile"? You wanna see hostile?

1139
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,124
How about I go in my house
and I get my...?

1140
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,963
What are...?
What's going on with you?

1141
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,675
Peanuts.

1142
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,627
"Penis"?

1143
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,629
Oh, peanuts.

1144
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,969
That was a peanut butter sandwich.
Are you not good with peanuts?

1145
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,976
What are you pointing at?
What's going on? What's here?

1146
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,471
Oh, I got it! What do I do? What do I do?

1147
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,316
"Check the needle, pump back, pump..."
Okay, hold on. I'm a slow reader.

1148
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,977
"Hold the pump... " Okay, okay!

1149
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,646
Jab it in your chest. Okay.
I got you, dude. Ready?

1150
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,367
How you feeling, you good?

1151
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,824
You good? Did I get you? Did I get you?

1152
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:27,252
Whoa. Whoa. Dude, come here. Hurry.

1153
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,957
Look at this.

1154
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,005
- Is that Harken? Dale's killing Harken?
- That's Harken?

1155
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,010
I'm gonna hit you again, okay?

1156
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,926
- What is he doing?
- He's really doing it?

1157
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,387
- This is the recon stage.
- Holy shit.

1158
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,177
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, we gotta go. Oh, God.

1159
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:48,473
I'm pushing on it. Okay.

1160
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,443
What about little jabs? Little jabs?

1161
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:53,861
Do I get your neck?

1162
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,444
Was that good?

1163
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,279
Come on, man!

1164
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,492
Oh, my God.

1165
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:04,914
Hey, hey! Come here!

1166
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:08,452
What's going on? What are you doing?
What's happened?

1167
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,212
I think he's okay! I hit him
with this. Do you know him?

1168
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,841
Of course, he's my husband. Sweetie?
Honey? Sweetheart, are you okay?

1169
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,134
- There he is. Hey.
- Ah. What did you do to me?

1170
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,267
I saved you with your thingy.
It was incredible.

1171
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,803
Oh, my God, sweetie.
He saved your life.

1172
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,061
You saved his life.

1173
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,434
Okay. That's cool.

1174
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,645
- What's with the hugging?
- Saved your life!

1175
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:36,314
Oh, sweetie, I am just so grateful
that he was here. You could have died.

1176
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,823
- I'm sure you are grateful he's here.
- Yes, I am.

1177
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,780
- You know this guy?
- No, I don't.

1178
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,287
Are you fucking this guy? What were
you doing, waiting to fuck my wife?

1179
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,199
Dude, I just met your wife.
You want your thing back?

1180
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,244
- You better get out of here.
- No problem.

1181
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,584
Dave. Dave, what are you...? Honey?

1182
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:57,502
Honey, you should be thanking this young
man. Why are you being so suspicious?

1183
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,510
Why? You know why I'm being suspicious.

1184
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,137
Because I know you sleep
around on me.

1185
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,552
That's ridiculous.

1186
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,183
What about the way
you look at Maurilio?

1187
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:10,473
You realize We're all going to jail
because of that idiot?

1188
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:13,687
Man, I can't go to jail. Look at me.
I'll get raped like crazy.

1189
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,102
Fuck, me too.

1190
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,105
Yeah, totally.

1191
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,241
I'd get raped just as much
as you would, Kurt.

1192
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,652
- Do you think you're more rape-able?
- I'm not saying that.

1193
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,201
- You're pretty close to saying...
- Oh, fuck.

1194
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,456
Holy shit.
Did you guys see me out there?

1195
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,125
Yeah, we saw you, Dale.

1196
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,259
Shh. Yeah, we saw that.

1197
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,670
How cool was that?

1198
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,635
It wasn't cool at all.
We come out to gather information...

1199
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,052
...and you start stabbing Harken to death
in front of the neighborhood?

1200
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,471
- Harken?
- Who'd you think you were stabbing?

1201
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:51,809
I wasn't stabbing anyone.

1202
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,646
He had an allergic reaction to some peanuts
and I rescued him, know what I mean?

1203
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,811
He had a little allergy shot on him
and I...

1204
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:01,068
I mean, I jabbed him with that,
but I was just saving his life.

1205
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,983
- Saved a man's life.
- Hang on a second.

1206
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,743
So my boss, who we're
thinking about planning to kill...

1207
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,405
...is dying in front of you
and you saved his life?

1208
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,994
Well, that sounds bad
when you say it like that.

1209
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,455
- Can you open the door?
- That's not cool.

1210
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,167
- But I didn't know it was Harken.
- Hit the button.

1211
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,582
This is why I need to know
what people look like.

1212
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,421
You're mad at me for killing him ...

1213
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,551
Can we give him a time-out?
For one second.

1214
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,963
Make up your fucking mind. It's like...

1215
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,177
What is this?

1216
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,683
You gotta admit
we got some good intel tonight.

1217
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:32,221
Harken is allergic to peanuts
and Pellit's got a huge stash of cocaine.

1218
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,684
Are you playing this game?

1219
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:38,023
So all we gotta do is figure a way to get
peanuts somewhere into Harken's house...

1220
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,107
...and put some poison in Pellit's coke.

1221
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,399
It's easy for someone to think
Pellit got a bad batch of cocaine.

1222
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,694
You seriously locking me
out of the car like we're in 8th grade?

1223
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,579
What about Harken? Probably
always got that injector thing.

1224
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:51,114
Doesn't shower with it.

1225
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,579
So then we'll put some peanuts
inside his shampoo.

1226
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,457
A couple of fatal accidents
we're not even there for.

1227
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,168
- Motherfucker Jones would be so proud.
- Yeah, he would.

1228
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,004
- Getting old.
- What do you do about dummy's boss?

1229
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,795
I'll stake her out tomorrow
and get to the bottom of it.

1230
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,840
- A man has his limits.
- That left a fucking dent.

1231
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,968
Get him fucking home.

1232
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:16,231
Very funny. That was very funny, guys.

1233
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,892
We have one thing to figure out,
if you can help us.

1234
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,403
If Nick and I were in prison,
who do you think would get raped more?

1235
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,446
Nick.

1236
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,576
Really? Why?

1237
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,866
It's about weakness and vulnerability-
It's not a looks thing.

1238
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,246
It probably would be Nick.

1239
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,625
Getting locked out of the car
is bullshit, man.

1240
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,917
That's an awesome deal.

1241
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,805
Jesus, Dale- It's a murder,
not a cocktail party...

1242
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:33,387
I know. You don't have to
announce that to the world.

1243
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,554
There was a great deal on nuts.
I'm not gonna pass up on savings.

1244
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,936
Okay, so this is it.

1245
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:42,317
I'm doing Pellit, you're gonna do Harken, and
you'll get some intel from Julia, right?

1246
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,062
- Copy that.
- Okay. See you on the other side.

1247
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,888
Okay.

1248
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,349
- Thank you, Kimmy.
- You're welcome.

1249
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,105
That was great.

1250
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,566
- See you next time.
- Yeah.

1251
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:31,108
- Thank you, Bill.
- Thank you, Bobby.

1252
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,533
What?

1253
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,456
Whew.

1254
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,370
Oh.

1255
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,054
Shit.

1256
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,720
- Hey.
- How's it going over there?

1257
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,224
- What do you know about Julia?
- I learned I gotta switch dentists...

1258
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,388
...because this woman
is unbelievably hot.

1259
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,729
- How's it going over there?
- Uh, it's...

1260
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:10,565
Just I'm waiting for, you know,
Pellit to sleep or leave or ...

1261
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,199
Just... Just waiting.

1262
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:16,077
Wonder what, uh,
Dale's doing with Harken.

1263
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,987
It's gonna be really hard.

1264
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:22,000
And well have to work at this every day,
but I wanna do that because I want you.

1265
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,503
I want all of you forever, you and me,
every day...

1266
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,602
Everybody was kung-fu fighting

1267
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:50,274
Everybody was kung-fu fighting

1268
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,948
Give me that.

1269
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,859
Give it to me.

1270
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:18,306
Jesus. Where does this guy
get the energy?

1271
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,144
Oh, yeah.

1272
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,535
What the fuck was that?

1273
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,840
Okay. Okay.

1274
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:01,179
Okay. Okay.

1275
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,183
- Yeah, Dale?
- I don't think I can do this.

1276
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:12,690
Look, I know
you really hate Harken but...

1277
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,404
...I don't think
I can go through with it.

1278
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:16,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1279
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,868
I know. I've been thinking
the same thing.

1280
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:22,575
- Yeah, let's just call it off
- What the fuck?

1281
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,865
- What?
- It's Harken. He's here.

1282
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,123
He's at Pellit's? Why?

1283
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,785
I don't know. He's walking
right up to the front door.

1284
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:32,001
- You think he's onto us?
- How the fuck do I know?

1285
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,381
Knock a little louder?

1286
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,541
What? What?

1287
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,256
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ,
Harken just shot Pellit.

1288
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,799
Are you sure?

1289
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:46,344
Holy shit. Pellit opened up the door,
Harken shot him in the chest...

1290
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,684
...he fell down, he shot him again
in the head.

1291
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:52,396
- He shot him? Wait, what's going on?
- I don't understand. He shot him?

1292
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,606
Nick? Say something.
Nick, say something.

1293
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,989
Nick! Nick, Nick, talk to me.
Nick, what's happening?

1294
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,239
What's going on?

1295
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,901
- How's Pellit doing?
- Still pretty fucking dead, Dale.

1296
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,083
I gotta get out of here before somebody sees me.
Meet me at the bar. I'll call Kurt.

1297
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,668
Yeah. I'll meet you there.

1298
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:18,756
I might throw up a couple times in the
toilet here, but then I'll meet you there.

1299
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,220
Oh.

1300
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,677
Oh, Toyota.

1301
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,443
Stay calm. We'll figure this out.

1302
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,604
"Calm"?
I saw a guy get shot an hour ago.

1303
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:42,275
- I know. A guy you were gonna kill anyway.
- Listen, I don't know about that.

1304
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,114
- What?
- Don't Know if I had it in me.

1305
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,371
I freaked out and panicked,
got out of there.

1306
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,952
Are you kidding?
You can't change a plan like this...

1307
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,162
I'm not a murderer.

1308
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:53,328
You think when it came down to it,
you'd be able to kill Julia?

1309
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:57,340
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
It is a little hard to imagine killing her now.

1310
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,627
- "Now"?
- Wait, what does that mean?

1311
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,386
- Did you sleep with her?
- No, no.

1312
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,968
- Tell me you didn't sleep with her.
- You're a mess.

1313
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,384
But this time it wasn't my fault,
I swear to God.

1314
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,928
You will be a suspect
if you try and kill her now.

1315
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,143
At first I was surveilling her,
like I was asked to do.

1316
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:17,482
- She's incredibly hot, by the way. So hot.
- Don't talk about how hot she is, bastard.

1317
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,816
Next thing,
she starts deliberately undressing.

1318
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:21,026
Come on.

1319
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,156
In front of her window with the lights on.

1320
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,739
- Like she knew I was watching.
- "Deliberately undressed"?

1321
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,030
Slowly, seductively,
lot of shoulder moves...

1322
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,072
...is clearly putting on a show.

1323
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,163
- Next she makes herself a little snack.
- She have a nice chest?

1324
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,327
A Popsicle.

1325
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,086
- Then a banana.
- Come on.

1326
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,795
- And finally, a hot dog. I mean, come on.
- Now I don't believe your story.

1327
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,836
Three penis-shaped foods,
that can't be a coincidence, right?

1328
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:45,596
Eating them in that weird order?
Not a proper meal.

1329
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:46,847
It's cold to hot.

1330
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,885
Fine. So you took the penis foods
as an invitation to fuck her.

1331
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:53,851
No, no. God, no. I took he-r invitation
to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her.

1332
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,308
She lured me in. lt was
like one of these things.

1333
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:59,023
- Something clinically wrong with you.
- You're a whore.

1334
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:02,029
- Come on. That's not nice, okay?
- Look, your problem 's solved.

1335
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:03,690
She won't mess with you anymore.

1336
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,484
Can we move on?
Let's talk about what happened to Pellit.

1337
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:10,326
All right, okay. Let me think. Okay,
here's what I'm thinking. Here's my idea.

1338
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,866
We call the cops
with an anonymous tip. All right?

1339
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,080
We tell them Harken killed Pellit. Boom.

1340
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:18,712
Harken's in jail, Pellit's in hell,
Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her...

1341
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,044
...and all three of us
have our problems solved.

1342
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,460
It could work. An anonymous tip,
that's not bad.

1343
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:24,673
Mm-hm.

1344
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:27,759
Gotta be from a pay phone, though,
so it's not traced back to us.

1345
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,971
- Exactly.
- Good. Let's take my car. Let's do it.

1346
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,683
All right. Where do you even
find a pay phone these days?

1347
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,813
There's a ton at the bus station for sure.

1348
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,772
Oh, yeah, I guess that's a good point.
Maybe the mall.

1349
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,402
What is this?

1350
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:44,568
- What is this?
- Is that for us?

1351
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,858
- What?
- Oh, shit.

1352
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,413
All the way down.

1353
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,420
Right there.

1354
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:04,843
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- I own it. Yup.

1355
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:10,424
We got an APB on a gray Toyota Prius,
license 2-Whiskey-Alpha-Quincy-2-3-3.

1356
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:11,806
- How come?
- Hang on, man.

1357
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,934
- Did I talk to you?
- No.

1358
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:17,104
That's this car. Tell me how I can help.

1359
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:20,312
A traffic cam caught this car
fleeing the scene of a crime tonight.

1360
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,944
- Would you know anything about that?
- I don't know why it would do that.

1361
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:27,365
I mean, I don't know. What happened?

1362
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,571
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

1363
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,117
I smell alcohol.

1364
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,496
- This guy and the mouth in the back.
- That's me.

1365
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,953
I'm gonna need you
to follow us to the station.

1366
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,242
Officer.

1367
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:39,785
My man.

1368
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:45,967
I cannot believe I let you talk me into
this whole thing. I cannot believe it.

1369
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,219
Are you kidding me?
We were being hypothetical.

1370
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,755
- Being hypothetical?
- You're the one that pushed us into it.

1371
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,635
Well, don't bark.

1372
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,933
- You know we're dead, right?
- Why?

1373
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,315
Because they know everything.
Cops are smart.

1374
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,818
You realize we can't even mention
Harken now?

1375
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,319
- Yeah, I know.
- Shit, dude.

1376
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:08,231
- Wait, why?
- It was supposed to be an anonymous tip.

1377
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,694
- Yeah, so?
- Come on, man.

1378
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:13,077
Should I just tell them the only reason
I know about Harken is...

1379
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,334
So should I just say that the only reason
I know about Harken...

1380
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,212
...is because I was parked
in front of your dead boss's house?

1381
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,668
You were at the scene of the crime.
It was bad then.

1382
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:29,586
You kind of fled the scene of a crime.
That's actually a crime in and of itself.

1383
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,175
Shouldn't have done that.
I'm the one that hasn't done anything.

1384
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:34,466
- You broke into two people's houses.
- So you broke into a house.

1385
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:37,010
I followed you into a house
after you broke into it.

1386
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,099
- You stole a blackberry.
- You did cocaine.

1387
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,059
I accidentally inhaled some cocaine.

1388
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:44,522
- What are you gonna do, rat me out?
- Maybe I will rat you out. What do you think?

1389
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,526
- You gonna rat me out too?
- I Could.

1390
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,858
You stole a blackberry. You fled a crime.
You raped my boss.

1391
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,570
- I did not rape her.
- I'll climb over and kick your ass!

1392
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,906
- Wanna see what happens?
- Hey! Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

1393
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,787
- Right this way.
- Yeah, let's do it. Come on.

1394
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,539
Let's go in there. Let's go. Let's do it.

1395
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:02,789
Do you wanna explain
why you were doing 61 in a 25 zone...

1396
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,171
...one block from the victim's house...

1397
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,502
...just moments after he got shot dead?

1398
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,335
I was drag racing.

1399
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,255
- I'm a drag racer.
- You were drag racing?

1400
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,680
Mm.

1401
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:17,884
In a Prius?

1402
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,395
I don't win a lot.

1403
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,899
Here's what I don't understand.

1404
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,276
You were at the crime scene.

1405
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:31,735
Hour later we find the car. You happened to
be hanging with this freaky motherfucker.

1406
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,741
- A registered sex offender.
- It was an empty playground.

1407
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:39,030
And this guy. Who happens to be working
for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company.

1408
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,910
What?

1409
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,493
My boss was murdered?

1410
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:49,750
Oh, wow. What were you doing at his
house, Nick? Why were you there?

1411
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,252
Where were you during the murder?

1412
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:57,799
I was making love.
I was making love to a woman.

1413
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:00,093
Yeah. Murdering some ass.

1414
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:04,021
- Detectives ...
- No, uh, I have a question.

1415
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,854
If one of us knew, you know,
who the shooter was...

1416
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:11,362
...and he was willing to
serve you that perp on a platter...

1417
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:15,491
...he would be entitled
to some sort of immunity, right?

1418
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,493
No. He would be entitled
to some jail time.

1419
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,489
If he knew who the shooter was
and didn't tell us...

1420
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,532
...that would be obstruction of justice.

1421
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,625
Glad none of us
know who the shooter is.

1422
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:30,881
Listen, if you think we're gonna believe
that this is all just a big coincidence...

1423
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,213
...we're gonna be here for a long time.

1424
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:40,096
Okay, wait. By saying
"we're gonna be here for a long time"...

1425
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,515
...you're implying that
we're not allowed to leave...

1426
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:47,307
...which would only be the case if we
were under arrest. Are we under arrest?

1427
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:50,477
No. We just brought you in
for questioning.

1428
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:54,154
Well, then, ipso facto...

1429
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,658
...you don't have sufficient evidence...

1430
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,660
...constituting probable cause
for an arrest warrant.

1431
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,820
Not yet.

1432
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:06,493
Well, uh, then, pursuant to
the Fourth Amendment...

1433
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,963
...I believe we are free to go.
Are we not?

1434
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,002
Yeah, technically. Yeah.

1435
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,009
Technically is good enough for me.

1436
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,012
Gentlemen, ahem, we are free men.

1437
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,007
Let's go.

1438
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,267
We gotta get back to your car.
Keep moving.

1439
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,894
We get a cab? Take the train?
What do you wanna do?

1440
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:29,728
- You ever been on a subway in this town?
- Pretty great. Where'd that come from?

1441
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,689
Law & Order, okay? You can
learn stuff watching Law & Order.

1442
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,694
- We showed them, huh?
- We did show them.

1443
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,355
You were about to turn us in.

1444
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,945
There was a few conversations
about ratting each other out...

1445
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,701
...but it was gonna be fine.

1446
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,111
Hold on.

1447
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,077
That's for you, hotshot.
Speeding and running a red light.

1448
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,076
You boys don't get
too comfortable out there.

1449
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:53,373
Our forensics team is sweeping the Pellit
house right now for DNA and fingerprints.

1450
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:56,550
And I'll tell you something.
They don't miss shit.

1451
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,307
In the butt you go, go, go.

1452
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,394
Why would you put his whole bathroom
in your ass?!

1453
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:11,558
- I didn't I know I had DNA in my butt.
- Lying! You know there's DNA in your butt.

1454
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,227
You just like shoving shit in your ass,
you fucking pervert!

1455
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:16,191
We are lawyering up, men. That's it.

1456
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:20,324
I don't have money for a lawyer. I bought
a very expensive ring I can't afford...

1457
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,406
...then I gave the rest of my motherfucking
money to Motherfucker Jones.

1458
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,196
That's who we should talk to.

1459
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,205
He's covered us this far, right?
Five grand?

1460
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,366
Five thousand forty with the briefcase.

1461
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,828
- Shut up about that!
- Shut up about the briefcase.

1462
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:37,044
Excuse me. Excuse me. Da-da-da.

1463
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:40,711
- Hello, Motherfucker.
- Hey, look who's back. Look who's back.

1464
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:43,722
Whatever happened to
that, uh, Strangers on a Train shit?

1465
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,554
Didn't work out. We need your help.

1466
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:48,560
One of our intended victims
killed the other intended victim.

1467
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,312
- Shut the fuck up.
- It's gone bad.

1468
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,348
You guys are some fucking evil geniuses.

1469
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,984
Thank you, but we had nothing to do
with it. We don't know why it happened.

1470
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:57,690
The cops bring us in as suspects.

1471
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,574
Kurt's DNA's all over the apartment because
he shoved a toothbrush up his ass.

1472
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:04,281
- That's not the point.
- I'm giving him the whole story.

1473
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,571
I got you. First thing first,
we gotta handle business.

1474
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,284
Mm-hm.

1475
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,534
- I need $5000.
- There's gonna be no more money.

1476
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,293
- Two thousand?
- Absolutely not.

1477
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:16,581
No way, Motherfucker. No.

1478
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,424
All right, look, pay for my drinks.

1479
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,130
- Pay for his drink.
- I'll do that.

1480
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,795
Not a very good negotiator.

1481
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:26,056
The guy that killed the other guy,
are the cops after him?

1482
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,058
No, no, they don't suspect him.

1483
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,140
Then this is what you need to do:

1484
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:34,807
Get him to confess to the murder
while you're wearing a wire.

1485
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,646
A wire? We can do that. That's easy.

1486
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:39,983
That how they got you
when you murdered somebody?

1487
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:46,285
- I ain't never murder nobody.
- I'm sorry?

1488
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,370
I never murdered anybody.

1489
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:51,499
Wait, no. You said you did a dime
for some pretty nasty shit.

1490
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,911
It was some nasty shit,
but does that mean I murdered somebody?

1491
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,124
You implied it.

1492
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:58,505
You didn't murder someone,
what'd you do?

1493
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,258
All right, listen, get in here.

1494
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,672
You guys ever see the movie
Snow Falling on Cedars?

1495
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:07,840
No.

1496
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,679
- Never seen that.
- I love that movie.

1497
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:13,642
What happened was is that I took a video
camera into the movie and I bootleg it.

1498
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,273
They was waiting right outside the exit.
They got me.

1499
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,480
- You did 10 years for video piracy?
- Yeah.

1500
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:21,361
- They take that shit so serious, man.
- Not that seriously.

1501
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,113
We've been taking murder advice...

1502
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:26,446
...from some guy whose biggest crime
is taping an Ethan Hawke movie.

1503
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,031
- So you do know the movie.
- I know who's in it.

1504
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:33,119
Everyone knows the movie. That's not
the point. You tricked us, Motherfuck...

1505
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:37,879
Hang on a second, something doesn't
stack up quite right with this, all right?

1506
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:42,337
So you just call yourself a video pirate,
right? Pirating the high seas of videocy?

1507
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,002
Why do you Carly a gun on you,
Mr. Video Pirate?

1508
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:46,671
- A gun?
- Yeah.

1509
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:48,965
- I don't wanna see it.
- It's my cell phone.

1510
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:53,143
- It's a Sidekick. I'm gonna be in the car.
- Oh, shit.

1511
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:57,398
You grab at it like a gun and you confuse
people. Goddamn it, I feel like a moron.

1512
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,229
- Let's go.
- You are a moron.

1513
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:04,238
Look, you don't go into a bar and
hand a guy $5000 just because he black.

1514
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,615
- It was never a black-white thing.
- No, come on.

1515
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,741
Let's go. Come on. Dale.

1516
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:10,903
Y'all motherfuckers crazy.

1517
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:23,040
Okay.

1518
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,379
Looks pretty quiet, yeah?

1519
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:28,842
Yeah, it does. Okay, tape recorder's ready
to roll, I got some fresh batteries in here.

1520
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,929
It was a pretty big investment so I should
be the one who does the tape-recording.

1521
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,310
- No way. No, I'll do it.
- You're gonna do it?

1522
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,517
You'll have to duct-tape that
to your chest.

1523
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,102
I can't tape this to my chest.
I have hair on chest.

1524
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,109
Just put it in your pocket.
Not gonna tape it to his chest.

1525
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:47,945
So, what do we do? Wait for him to come
home, we grab a office chair or something?

1526
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:51,610
One of us gets in the chair, spins around
and dramatically confronts him.

1527
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,620
- I'm in the chair.
- Nick's in the chair.

1528
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,656
- Why are you in the chair?
- He's my boss.

1529
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:59,292
Maybe we should get three chairs
and all spin around at the same time.

1530
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:00,577
Confront him like that.

1531
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,213
That's not intimidating,
that's like a musical number.

1532
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,083
Watch out for the cat.

1533
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,467
Surprise!

1534
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:12,389
Okay. It's a false alarm-
Just mingle, mingle, mingle...

1535
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,800
Hi. Who are you?

1536
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,809
Come inside. Close that door. Hurry.

1537
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,811
Um, okay. Now, wait a minute.

1538
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:21,315
You're the young man who helped Dave
out on the street the other night.

1539
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,771
- That's him.
- Yeah, that's who I am.

1540
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:27,905
- How is he?
- He is great, thanks to you. Thank you.

1541
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,653
- Did I invite you?
- You did and you didn't.

1542
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,659
I work with your husband. We're late.

1543
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,946
- These are my plus-twos.
- He's in the garage.

1544
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,160
Oh, we should hide.
Everybody, come on in.

1545
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:42,127
- Someone get the lights.
- Get down, get down, get down.

1546
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:46,795
I'm Kurt, by the way. I didn't get a
chance to introduce myself at the door.

1547
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:50,086
- Oh, hey, Rhonda. Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Rhonda. Very nice to meet you.

1548
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,843
Nick didn't tell me
his boss was married to a model.

1549
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,133
Ha, ha. Yeah, not a model.

1550
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,181
When did you quit?

1551
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:04,725
Surprise!

1552
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,189
Goddamn it! God, I hate that!

1553
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,569
We got you, huh, honey?

1554
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,736
- So you were surprised?
- Yeah.

1555
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,195
Look, sweetie, everybody's here.

1556
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,119
I'm gonna put my stuff down.

1557
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:19,031
She knows I hate surprises.

1558
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,914
I think we got him. Ha, ha.
We got him good.

1559
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,712
Okay.

1560
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:28,294
He's gone off on his own.
This is our chance.

1561
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,209
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, very ready.

1562
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,173
- Stay close, okay?
Mm-hm.

1563
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,967
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1564
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,141
Harken.

1565
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,095
I cannot believe my wife invited you.

1566
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:44,185
What are you doing here?
Come to stab me a few more times?

1567
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,897
- We know what you did.
- Well, what does that mean?

1568
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,153
We were there. We saw you kill him.

1569
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,439
Really?

1570
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,741
So, what is this, then?
Your little Shakedown?

1571
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,658
You think that you can blackmail me...

1572
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:02,537
...because you saw me
kill my wife's lover?

1573
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:04,914
Say his name!

1574
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,296
What?

1575
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,216
The man you killed, you say his name.

1576
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,595
Pellit? Trust me, Pellit's name
means nothing anymore.

1577
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:17,222
There it is. Thank you. Let's do it, guys.

1578
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,850
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hang on. Where the fuck is Kurt?

1579
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,601
I killed Pellit.

1580
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,603
Hold that thought,
I'm missing my friend Kurt.

1581
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:28,359
I walked right up to his door, I put
a gun in his chest and I shot him.

1582
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,771
Then you know what? You know
what I did after that? I shot him again.

1583
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,905
And let me tell you something.

1584
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,400
I liked it.

1585
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:41,121
So if you think
that I'm some sort of pussy...

1586
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,876
...who won't do exactly the same thing
to a couple of lame-assed blackmailers...

1587
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,160
...think again.

1588
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:50,456
Know who thinks you're a pussy?
My friend Kurt. Let me grab him.

1589
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,044
You are pathetic, Hendricks.

1590
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:59,431
You walk into my house on
my goddamn birthday and pull this shit.

1591
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,642
Well, let me tell you something.

1592
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,895
You're dead.

1593
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:09,016
You and you.

1594
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,525
- And...'?
- Kurt.

1595
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:13,312
Kurt. Dead men.

1596
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,656
- I didn't know it was your birthday.
- What's he doing?

1597
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:19,489
- What do you got?
- Getting my gun. Only take a second.

1598
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,948
- I'll get the car.
- I'll go.

1599
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:25,161
We had him, we had the whole goddamn
thing. What the fuck happened to Kurt?

1600
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:26,579
- Hey!
- There you are.

1601
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:27,789
Where were you?

1602
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:30,329
My, uh, stomach was bothering me.
Had to use the bathroom.

1603
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,793
He confessed everything,
now he's getting his gun.

1604
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:34,424
- Kurt, what happened there?
- Oh, uh...

1605
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,585
...she was giving me a tour
of the mouth... House.

1606
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,846
- Ow! What are you... '?
- Get in the car. Right now.

1607
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:42,133
- Knock it off.
- Come on.

1608
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:48,514
Look, I wasn't thinking, okay? I'm sorry.

1609
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:52,309
She-'s just very hot. And I'm weak.
I'm a weak, weak man, okay?

1610
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:53,602
I admit it.

1611
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:56,946
- Back it up, back it up.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1612
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,607
- They found my DNA.
- Back it up.

1613
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:03,200
Go backwards. Go backwards.
See? They found your poop brush.

1614
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:07,204
- You are obsessed with your asshole!
- No, I'm not. It was a prank, Dale.

1615
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:10,244
Shut it down. Let's start talking about
where we're gonna live.

1616
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:13,380
- The current situation Won't work.
- There'll be cops everywhere.

1617
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,835
You talking about fleeing?

1618
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:17,547
Damn right.
I'm talking about Canada or Mexico.

1619
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:20,595
I can't live in Mexico.
I mean, I can't handle the food.

1620
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:22,677
My digestion alone... I'll probably die.

1621
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,433
- You'd rather be in jail the rest of your life?
- Shut the fuck up.

1622
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,930
I'm getting a call. I gotta get this.
Hello?

1623
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:30,559
Hello, lover.

1624
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:33,475
Uh, look, Julia,
now's not a good time to talk.

1625
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,736
- Hey, I'm not here.
- That's okay.

1626
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,113
I actually meant to
call your home phone.

1627
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,069
You know, tell Stacy about us.

1628
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:43,406
- No, don't do that. Wait. Wait.
- We'll learn the metric system.

1629
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:46,742
We gotta buy coats and sweaters
and learn hockey and all that shit.

1630
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,158
No, I think I've waited long enough, Dale.

1631
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,668
I'm sort of tired of you
toying with my emotions.

1632
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:53,249
I'm not playing with you.

1633
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:57,041
I'm not toying with you. I'm gonna
take care of it. I'm gonna take care of it.

1634
01:28:57,207 --> 01:29:00,086
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you gonna do to me?

1635
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,091
- I'm gonna have sex with you.
- What?

1636
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:04,382
I want you to give me details, you pussy.

1637
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:06,221
And please be explicit.

1638
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:09,637
Details? I'm in a car with people.
Now is not a good time for details.

1639
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:13,231
- I don't care if it's not a great time.
- Okay, fine.

1640
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:15,438
I'm gonna make you feel good.
You know?

1641
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,069
With my fingers and my tongue
and whatnot.

1642
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,105
I know you can do better than that.

1643
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:22,946
All right, I'm gonna put my penis
in your pussy, Julia.

1644
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,406
Oh, boy, that's gonna get me done.

1645
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,701
What the fuck was that?

1646
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,748
- What the fuck?
- That's Harken. Lose him.

1647
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,955
- Oh, my God!
- Get out of here.

1648
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,925
Look, careful.

1649
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,765
Hey, are you gonna slap me in the face
with your cock, Dale?

1650
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:49,221
Yes, I'll slap you in the face
with my cock!

1651
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,638
- This guy's fucking crazy.
- Slap you all over your face with my cock!

1652
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:55,140
- Don't get in a wreck.
- It's go time.

1653
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:58,982
Okay. More, Dale.

1654
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,646
I will go up and down on you...

1655
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,736
...and I'll rub my naked butt
against your naked butt...

1656
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:05,492
...until it's raw and red...

1657
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,698
...and we're both really chafed up
real bad.

1658
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:17,163
Not good. Get us out of here!
Get us out of here!

1659
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,330
I got it, I got it.

1660
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,426
- Come on.
- I'll spit on your arms and stuff.

1661
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,336
- What else?
- And then I'm gonna...

1662
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:26,379
...jam my skull
into the crack of your ass!

1663
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,675
Yeah, baby. In the crack of your ass.

1664
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:34,187
And I'll dance on your boobies,
and I'll jump up and down on your butt.

1665
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,939
Ah. I'll see you Friday, dirty bird.

1666
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,444
Good. Friday. See you Friday.

1667
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:43,605
Nice job fucking the crazy
out of her, Kurt!

1668
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:46,116
Maybe I should have been
dancing on her boobs, huh?

1669
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,366
Maybe you should have.

1670
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:49,243
That was very good driving, by the way.

1671
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:50,494
Thank you very much.

1672
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:53,578
- Good evening, Mn Buckman.
- Yeah, hey, Gregory. How are you?

1673
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,209
Our onboard sensors
report you've had a collision.

1674
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,496
That's because
we have a crazy man that hit us.

1675
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:01,541
I will alert the authorities
and direct them to your location.

1676
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:03,800
Don't call the cops.
They're already after us.

1677
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,964
No, Gregory, they think we murdered
someone, all right? Do not call the cops.

1678
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,599
What's going on?
Why you slowing down, Kurt?

1679
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:14,728
Whoa. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't do that.
No, the engine died.

1680
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,230
- I remotely disabled your engine.
- What?

1681
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:19,141
It is standard Nav Guide protocol...

1682
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,230
...whenever a driver
has committed a crime.

1683
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,987
I pay 19 bucks a month
for this fucking service.

1684
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:27,066
- Remain with your vehicle.
- The police will be arriving shortly.

1685
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:30,031
Gregory, I thought you were
our fucking friend, man!

1686
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,927
Get out of the car, all of you.
Come on. Come on.

1687
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,934
- Remember I saved your life that one time?
- Shut up.

1688
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,138
- Just take it easy with that...
- Shut up.

1689
01:31:58,304 --> 01:31:59,977
I got six bullets in this gun.

1690
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,610
Which means I can shoot all of you
twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1691
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,770
...if I really wanted to,
but I'm not gonna.

1692
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,440
You're not gonna shoot us twice
or not gonna shoot us?

1693
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:09,778
Shut up.

1694
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:14,663
I got a better idea. I'm gonna tell
the cops that you killed Pellit.

1695
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:18,451
And when I found out,
you tried to kill me to shut me up.

1696
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,118
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

1697
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:24,131
Because I don't see one shred
of evidence that proves that I shot Pellit.

1698
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,792
And besides, I'm the guy
with the bullet in his leg.

1699
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,255
What?

1700
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:32,263
God, that hurts so much.

1701
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:34,174
Son of a bitch.

1702
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,762
- Catch!
- No, don't ca...!

1703
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,802
- Goddamn it, Dale.
- You see?

1704
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:41,473
You can't win a marathon without
putting some Band-Aids on your nipples.

1705
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,776
- What does that mean?
- Watch this.

1706
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:51,859
- Everybody freeze!
- Police!

1707
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:54,244
Drop the gun! On your knees!

1708
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:57,326
- Thank God.
- Officers, thank God you're here.

1709
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,491
These guys, they shot me.

1710
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,330
- That's not true!
- That's bullshit!

1711
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:04,292
I found out they murdered someone.
They tried to shut me up.

1712
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:07,333
Please protect me from them.
I have a wife and a cat!

1713
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,877
- All right, take it easy.
- Call for an ambulance.

1714
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:13,931
- Hey, what is this?
- It's nothing. It's just a tape recorder.

1715
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,636
Oh, shit! It's a tape recorder!

1716
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:18,848
- A tape recorder. Did you turn that off?
- No, it's been recording!

1717
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,388
- So listen to us, officer.
- Hands up!

1718
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:24,603
Listen to us for one second.
He confessed to killing Pellit.

1719
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,063
He said he shot him twice...

1720
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:29,480
...and he was gonna shoot us once
or twice. He was unclear about that.

1721
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:31,865
- You are insane.
- Just play the tape.

1722
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:37,158
But all those people are
just right outside.

1723
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,038
Your balls are so smooth.

1724
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:40,952
Wait a minute. Is that my wife?

1725
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:43,039
No, no. Of course not, no.
Let's move past that.

1726
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:45,875
- -Jam my skull
into the crack of your ass!

1727
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,460
I'll dance on your boobies,
and jump up and down on your butt.

1728
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:49,670
What the fuck is this?

1729
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:53,178
Don't judge. I have a thing with my boss-
It's none of your business.

1730
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:54,838
If you could get to the end...'?

1731
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,676
There's nothing on here.

1732
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:01,220
- Shit!
- What happened?

1733
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,229
Thing must have stopped
when we crashed.

1734
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:05,061
Before this guy
supposedly confessed?

1735
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:07,726
I told you, these guys are liars.
They cannot be trusted.

1736
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:09,735
They shot me in the leg, killed a guy.

1737
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,397
- He shot himself.
- I don't need to hear anything else.

1738
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:16,409
- Cuff them.
- Oh, my God.

1739
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:19,321
- You don't need to cuff us.
- My God, we're going to jail.

1740
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:21,114
We're going to jail. Unbelievable.

1741
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:22,703
It hurts. It hurts so much.

1742
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,664
Excuse me? Officers?

1743
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,996
I should mention
that it is Nav Guide policy...

1744
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:30,006
...to record all conversations
for quality assurance.

1745
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:32,463
- Who the hell's that?
- That's our Nav Guide rep.

1746
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,218
- His name is Almonan.
- Hands up!

1747
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:35,924
- Atmanad.
- Almondmond.

1748
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:38,431
- Atmanad is what it was!
- Atmanand.

1749
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,434
Atmand... Gregory, uh, play what he said.

1750
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:44,221
- Play it just after the crash.
- Very good, sir.

1751
01:34:44,387 --> 01:34:47,106
You're not gonna listen to this.
This isn't evidence.

1752
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,313
I got six bullets in this gun.

1753
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:52,445
Which means I can shoot all of you
twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1754
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:55,073
...if I really wanted to,
but I'm not gonna.

1755
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:56,699
- That's it.
- So it was you.

1756
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:02,614
That is not proof. That's just a car.
You're not gonna listen to a car.

1757
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,374
Looks like I'm getting that promotion
after all. Yeah.

1758
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,785
To answer your question,
that was your wife.

1759
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,080
- You fucked my wife?
- I fucked your wife.

1760
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,293
Nobody fucks my wife!

1761
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,672
Ah.

1762
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:18,304
How you like them nipples?

1763
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,090
Did you just do the catchphrase?

1764
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:22,475
- Good Will Hunting.
- Good Will Hunting.

1765
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,261
- That's so great.
- Caught it, yeah.

1766
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:27,556
Good Will Hunting rip. Instead of
saying "apples" he said “nipples."

1767
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,816
- Felt like a moment.
- And happy birthday.

1768
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:32,352
So in the end,
we didn't wind up going to jail.

1769
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:35,146
Actually, we did later that night
when they booked us.

1770
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:37,315
But since we led the cops to Harken...

1771
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:40,361
...they ultimately agreed
to let our other offenses slide.

1772
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:42,028
Strangely enough, lucky for Kurt...

1773
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:46,329
...there 's no laws on the books against
putting people's toiletries up your ass.

1774
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,619
Anyway,
with Harken in his new position...

1775
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:54,042
...on all fours in prison for 25 to life,
Comnidyne made me acting president.

1776
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:58,424
It's a great job, I got a solid raise
and I 'm actually my own boss.

1777
01:35:58,586 --> 01:35:59,883
Well, except for the CEO.

1778
01:36:00,046 --> 01:36:03,767
- Morning.
- Oh, morning. You, uh, must be Nick.

1779
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:06,678
- I am.
- Well, it's great to finally meet you.

1780
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:09,848
- You too, Mr. Sherman.
- Please. Lou.

1781
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:12,438
Okay. Lou.

1782
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,695
I appreciate the opportunity
you've given me. I won't let you down.

1783
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,522
Yeah, I'm sure you won't, son.

1784
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,363
From what I hear people say
he's the nicest guy in the world.

1785
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:23,657
Mr. Sherman,
I'm sorry your coffee was cold.

1786
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,867
Uh, Lou?

1787
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,246
Most people.

1788
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:29,376
Mr. Sherman, I'm hungry!

1789
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,502
Can I come out now, please?

1790
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:34,039
- You hear that?
- No.

1791
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,299
Sounds like there's someone
in your trunk.

1792
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,879
Why don't we let this
be, uh, our little secret?

1793
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,422
I need a shower.

1794
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:44,886
Yeah. Turns out my new boss...

1795
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,222
...is a twisted old fuck.

1796
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:52,399
Meanwhile, the Pellit family put the most
senior person in charge of the company...

1797
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:55,561
...which wasn't Kurt.
But he was okay with that.

1798
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:59,652
Because he realized that when you're
the boss, sometimes people want you dead.

1799
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:03,193
- Hey, Kurt. Come in.
- Margie, I wanted to congratulate you.

1800
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,406
Thank you.

1801
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:08,324
If there's anything I can do to help out
before the baby gets here, let me know.

1802
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:10,662
- What baby?
- Your baby.

1803
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:14,747
- I'm not pregnant.
- So I'm just touching you?

1804
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:17,373
AY...

1805
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,296
Julia.

1806
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:24,260
I was thinking perhaps
we could drill the patient first.

1807
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:25,469
And Dale?

1808
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,435
Ultimately, he decided his only choice
was to screw Julia after all.

1809
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:33,599
You just continue to surprise me...

1810
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:35,938
...you dirty, dirty little man.

1811
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,274
Just you wait.

1812
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,530
You like that, Dale?

1813
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,282
- You like that, Dale?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

1814
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:45,284
Oh.

1815
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:50,457
Oh, gosh, do I wish
I could have sex with Julia.

1816
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,536
What?

1817
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:57,455
I'm so sorry, but I couldn't keep it
together! It's amazing!

1818
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:59,795
- She was talking to your penis!
- Who are you?

1819
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:03,712
Julia, this is my good friend,
Kenny Sommerfeld.

1820
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:05,551
Most Likely to Succeed.

1821
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:07,807
- Give me some of that.
- Don't you touch me.

1822
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:10,639
Now, Kenny here, he'll do
just about anything for 50 bucks.

1823
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:12,896
- Yeah, it's true.
- Yeah, and it's not pretty.

1824
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:15,807
But that's why I asked him
to help me frame you.

1825
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:20,103
Really? ls this all you've got?
Your word against mine?

1826
01:38:20,269 --> 01:38:21,816
Don't forget about that guy.

1827
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:25,574
Say hi to my cameraman.
He's filmed a lot of Hollywood hits.

1828
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,485
You are a sick little bastard.

1829
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,450
You are a sick little bastard.

1830
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:31,034
Shut the fuck up for a second.

1831
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:34,167
Julia, shut the fuck up for a second,
all right?

1832
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:36,293
Now, here's what's gonna happen, okay?

1833
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:39,080
I'm going to take a very nice,
very expensive...

1834
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,716
...two-week vacation with my fiancée.

1835
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:45,003
Let's call it a honeymoon, all right?
And you are gonna pay for it.

1836
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:50,263
Then I'm going to return
to a rape-free workplace, all right?

1837
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:55,352
Because if you so much as look
at my sexy little ass, Julia...

1838
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,266
...I will have yours locked the fuck up...

1839
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:04,361
...you crazy bitch whore!

1840
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:07,692
Ah, that felt good.

1841
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:19,546
How's the hair? Is it good, is it great?
It's not as bad as his, is it?

1842
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:27,178
I had no idea that you called
your grandmother "Gam Gam."

1843
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,261
Calm down!

1844
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:33,843
Oh!

1845
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:40,233
Holy shit. He went out the door.

1846
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:43,732
This place is awful. It's like
The Sharper Image took a shit in here...

1847
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:45,112
Five forty with the briefcase.

1848
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:47,899
Oh, shut up about the briefcase.

1849
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:51,865
Gonna put that "briefcase" up my ass.

1850
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,080
'M gonna put that briefcase up my ass!

1851
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,581
A dancin' girl

1852
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,716
- You're good? He's good.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1853
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,586
Or else little Stacy here's
gonna get a little peek...

1854
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:12,178
...at my photo album.

1855
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:17,554
One more. Let's fix this.

1856
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,104
Have you ever in your life
seen this much co...?

1857
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:27,605
Pee, pee, pee, pee on the...

1858
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,278
Let's...

1859
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:37,414
Now I'm sneezing dust bunnies.
Is that diabetes?

1860
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:39,575
I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor.

1861
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:41,460
Is that my brain?
Take my temperature.

1862
01:40:41,619 --> 01:40:43,087
Have you any, uh, roofies?

1863
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,089
I want a lollipop.
Do you like karaoke?

1864
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:48,001
Do you have MDMA?
I'll suck your d...

1865
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:55,140
Shit happens.

1866
01:40:56,801 --> 01:41:01,682
What is your projected outside date
of completion, Motherfucker?

1867
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,233
Give me that again.

1868
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:17,117
- Oh, hi! Hi! Hello.
- Hi.

1869
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,497
Come on, what are you...?

1870
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:23,544
Wouldn't mind bending her over a barrel
and showing her the 50 states.

1871
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,125
I don't know what that means.

1872
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:27,256
- It's a phrase.
- I don't think so.

1873
01:41:27,415 --> 01:41:31,261
Yeah, it is. It certainly is.
Yeah, it definitely is.

1874
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:33,672
- Really?
- Yeah, it's from a movie.

1875
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:34,885
Mm-mm.

1876
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,720
It is now.

1877
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:38,726
Beautiful.
