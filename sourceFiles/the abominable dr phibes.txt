1
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,443
Good morning, sir.

2
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,432
It's a damn strange
business, Tom.

3
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,724
A man literally shredded to death
right in the heart of London.

4
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,605
That's the last one.

5
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,360
Bats appearing out of nowhere?

6
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,140
I don't know, it just...
just doesn't make sense.

7
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,825
Ooh, they're nasty-looking
little blighters, aren't they?

8
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,619
Seen them in Mandalay.
Suck your throat dry, they would.

9
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,904
Yeah, well, that's where
they belong, in the tropics.

10
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,574
I mean, not -- not here.
Not in a place like this.

11
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,616
Yes, all right, thank
you very much.

12
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,285
Take them all off to the
laboratory, would you?

13
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,060
Right, sir.

14
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,454
And have them double-checked
for rabies.

15
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,129
Yes, sir.

16
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,627
- Now, Morgan?
- Yes, sir'?

17
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,533
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm up here, sir.

18
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,617
Oh, so you are.

19
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,757
When you're finished up there,

20
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,004
I want you to question
the butler again.

21
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,343
There may be something
he's overlooked.

22
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,472
Very good, sir.

23
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,599
Remember when you were in Scotland
at the beginning of last week?

24
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,475
YES.

25
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,932
Well, there was another surgeon
who died.

26
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,518
- A Dr. Thornton.
- What about him?

27
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,106
- It's was more the way he died.
This...reminded me of it.

28
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,398
He was stung...to death by bees
in his library.

29
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,651
Bees in his library?

30
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,819
That's right.

31
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,406
Before we arrived, the whole place
must have been swarming with 'em.

32
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,453
I've got the file on my desk now.

33
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,245
You should have seen his face.

34
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,754
The whole flesh was a mass of...
well, boils.

35
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,458
- Boils?
- All over. Stings, I suppose.

36
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,673
I wonder if there is
a connection.

37
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,838
Well, I'll go through the file.

38
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,633
God knows what we've got.

39
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,098
Two doctors, both dead.

40
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,022
Oh, don't take him out
like that!

41
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,275
At least cover his face up.

42
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,026
What's left of it.

43
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,814
Good God.

44
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,984
Nobody told me this was a --
a masked affair.

45
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,738
For me?

46
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,956
How very elegant.

47
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,288
But, my dear fellow...

48
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,041
It's beautiful!

49
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,189
I say, jolly fine party, what?

50
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,396
Don't believe we've met.
My name's Hargreaves.

51
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,435
Dr. Hargreaves.

52
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,946
I'm a psychiatrist, actually.

53
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,614
Head shrinker.

54
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,122
I say, would you -- would you oblige?
Some fancy catch.

55
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,712
Much obliged.

56
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,215
Now point me towards the ladies.

57
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,588
Thank you.

58
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,259
Say...

59
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,426
Is that you, Freda?

60
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,533
This mask is jolly tight.

61
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,151
Hi.

62
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,433
Absolutely not.

63
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,726
We're short-staffed as it is,

64
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,065
and you want me
to give you more men

65
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,271
to go charging off on one of
your half-baked theories?

66
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,610
It's ridiculous.

67
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,365
Anyway, medical men die every day.

68
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,741
- I'm aware of that, sir.
- Good.

69
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,903
They're composed of the same
flesh and blood as you and I.

70
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:36,991
I'm aware of that, too, sir.

71
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,282
I happen to have seen rather a lot
of their flesh and blood

72
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,200
in the past few days.

73
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,373
And another thing.

74
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,083
Suppose the press
get hold of this.

75
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,086
Don't you talk to me
about the press, Trout.

76
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,590
You keep your ideas you've got
to yourself on that one.

77
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,880
Mention this to the press
and you know as well as I do,

78
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,890
given half a chance, they'd whip
up a panic story overnight.

79
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,346
The whole damn place
would be an uproar.

80
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,931
It was not my intention.

81
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,891
It's certainly not mine.

82
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,897
I want no statements.

83
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:08,983
Can you imagine what they'd make
of bats, bees and...and what?

84
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,571
Frogs.

85
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,027
Exactly.

86
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,360
Why don't you go and reread
"Aesop's Fables"?

87
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,781
Then perhaps you'll come to me
with a rather more pertinent theory.

88
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,531
That's all, Trout.

89
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,871
Look, three men have died, sir,
all in the medical profession.

90
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,789
Does that not suggest --?

91
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,420
No, it damn well doesn't.

92
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,549
There are some very strange people
practicing medicine these days.

93
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,405
Dr. Longstreet.

94
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,441
Mrs. Frawley.

95
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,733
I'm Off.

96
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,447
- You're what?
- Off.

97
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,736
Oh, yes. Yes.

98
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,159
You're sure you don't mind me
having the evening off?

99
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,834
No, no. I shall rather enjoy it.
I mean -- I mean, have a good time.

100
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,874
I've got you some cold brawn.

101
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,630
Oh, that sounds delicious.

102
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,167
I won't be back late.

103
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,127
I'll be back before midnight.

104
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,589
You don't have to hurry.
You won't turn into a pumpkin.

105
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,553
I don't know, though.

106
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,730
Mrs. Frawley!

107
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,942
Dr. Longstreet,
we are naughty, aren't we?

108
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,402
We haven't touched our supper,
have we?

109
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,818
-  Oh.
- And what is this?

110
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,407
This? What's thi-- Well, it's a...

111
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,947
Oh, I see what you mean.
Oh, yes.

112
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,490
It's a -- It's a new thing
on the market.

113
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,455
It -- It keeps out drafts.

114
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,743
Dra...

115
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,766
I'm...

116
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,351
I'm Dr. Longstreet, you know.

117
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,489
Who's this?

118
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,354
How did it go, Harry?

119
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,815
It didn't.

120
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,279
It came to a great grinding halt
if you want to know.

121
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,160
All he's worried
about is the press.

122
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,616
Well, they've been
on, of course.

123
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,076
-  And?
- I've killed it, don't worry.

124
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,162
We're playing it all down.
I'm sitting on the lab reports.

125
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,577
I don't care
what the old man says, Tom.

126
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,589
There is a pattern here,
a most definite pattern.

127
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,340
-  Is there anything in there?
- Well, I've been through the whole lot.

128
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,338
Correspondence, family,
all that sort of thing.

129
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,509
Yeah, well, what does
it tell us?

130
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,670
Well, they have one
thing in common.

131
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,215
If you say they all died mysteriously,
I'll bloody kill you.

132
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,133
Vesalius.

133
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,473
-  What?
- Dr. Vesalius.

134
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,230
That's a funny name.
Who the hell's he?

135
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,356
Well, they all worked for him
at some time,

136
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,393
and judging by
the correspondence here,

137
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,853
were fairly close associates.

138
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,111
Good, good, yes.
What else?

139
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,273
Nothing.

140
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,908
Nothing?

141
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,820
I see. You mean to say that
after 24 hours diligent research,

142
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,239
that is all you have been able
to discover.

143
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,076
Well, do we have an address
for this man?

144
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,290
An address.

145
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,082
Oh, damn it all, Tom.
where does he live?

146
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,375
This way.
He's through here, sir.

147
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,631
Ah, I see.
Thank you very much.

148
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,046
Father.

149
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,306
Father, there's someone
to see you.

150
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,469
Inspector Trout.

151
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,812
From Scotland Yard.

152
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,063
Detective inspector.

153
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,778
Good evening, sir.

154
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,616
I -- I'm sorry to intrude
like this, sir,

155
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,699
but it is a -- a very
urgent matter.

156
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,283
And I thought perhaps you might be
of some assistance to us, sir.

157
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,291
How?

158
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,169
Three men...

159
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,715
Three men in your profession
have all died in the past week

160
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,926
in most unusual circumstances.

161
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,510
Inspector...

162
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,015
men in my profession
die every day.

163
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,145
-  You have your foot on my pliers.
- I'm sorry, sir.

164
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,773
Thank you.

165
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,110
Do the names Hargreaves,
Thornton, and Dunwoody

166
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,067
mean anything to you, sir?

167
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,775
It's hard to believe.

168
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,068
I'm -- I'm sure of that, sir,

169
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:58,239
but can you think of anything,
anything at all,

170
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,286
that would relate to the killing
of these three men?

171
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,576
Nothing. Nothing.

172
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,043
Only last week
I was talking to Thornton.

173
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,502
Hello.

174
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,759
Yes, he is.

175
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,340
It's for you.

176
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,884
Thank you.

177
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,475
Hello. Trout.

178
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,268
I see. Where's that?

179
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,572
Yes, all right.
Ten minutes.

180
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,819
Did you know Dr. Longstreet?

181
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,908
You heard a what?

182
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,825
Well, a -- a violin or a cello
or something.

183
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,538
At half past two in the
morning, woman?

184
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,078
-  Yes.
- In the street?

185
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,498
Yes, I told you.
Don't keep on at me.

186
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,665
I'm sorry.

187
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,842
Like I said, I heard it.

188
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,550
Then there was
this car door banging.

189
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,430
Well, I couldn't get off to sleep,

190
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:00,308
so I co-- came down
to find some aspirins.

191
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:04,438
The door was open a bit,
and as I looked through, there he was.

192
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,598
-  And then I rang for you lot.
- And that's all?

193
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,063
Well, that's enough for one night.

194
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,445
I mean, look at him --
all white and everything.

195
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,073
There's nothing except this.

196
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,159
And, uh, that.

197
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,318
Ah, now...

198
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,663
Do you recognize this, madam?

199
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,831
Unh-unh. Fingerprints.

200
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,702
No, it's not mine.

201
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,163
And it's certainly not his.

202
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,591
Well, thank you, madam.
That's all for the moment.

203
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,428
You may go.

204
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,635
We'll come back in the morning
and take a full statement from you.

205
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,681
Thank you, Mrs...

206
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,683
-  Frawley.
- Thank you, Mrs. Frawley.

207
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,435
Oh, he was a nice man.

208
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,767
Good to me, he was,
in his own sort of way.

209
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,682
Yeah. You were his...

210
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,767
housekeeper?

211
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,700
Whoever did it
must have been a real pro.

212
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,028
He's as dry as a bone.

213
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,037
That is his bone.

214
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,574
Poor devil, I'll bet he was
still conscious when it happened.

215
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,370
-  Do you think it can be the same --?
- Oh, I don't think anymore, Tom.

216
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,600
Ah, this is the object in question, sir.

217
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,179
-  Oh, dear me, you've broken it.
- What's that?

218
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,564
It really is incredible
the amount of vandalism

219
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,939
that there is around these days.

220
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,397
I mean, I make something like this,
a thing of beauty and a joy forever --

221
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,528
-  Ah, you did make it, sir?
- Yes, of course I made it.

222
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:36,984
I wish to establish that, sir, yes.

223
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,945
Yes, certainly I did.
That's my mark on the back there.

224
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,327
Good, thank you. Now, can you tell me
a little bit about it, please, sir?

225
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,987
Yes, yes, certainly.

226
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,327
It's one of a very unusual set, this.

227
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,411
-  A set?
- Yes.

228
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,499
There's more than one?

229
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,160
Of course there's more than one.
It's a set.

230
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,079
-  Yes, well, how many in the set, sir?
- Ten.

231
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,214
-  Ten?!
- Ten.

232
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,421
Yes, well, I see.
Were -- Were they all the same?

233
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,177
Of course they weren't all the same.

234
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,088
Do you want 10 amulets
looking exactly the same?

235
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,223
Each of them had a different symbol.

236
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,636
I see.
Well, who ordered the set?

237
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,849
It was a lady.

238
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,059
Oh, a woman, eh?

239
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,440
No, no. A lady.

240
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,067
Yes, I remember the occasion well.

241
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,147
She -- She came in here,

242
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,404
she gave me a set
of working drawings,

243
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,237
she paid half the cost there
and then in cash

244
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,358
and the other half later.

245
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,367
When she returned for them,

246
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,199
she was absolutely delighted
with them,

247
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,078
as well she might be.

248
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,114
That's beautiful craftsmanship,
you know.

249
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:28,890
Yes.

250
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,659
You don't often get craftsmanship
like that nowadays.

251
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,826
Could I take another look at it?

252
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,457
Now, one more question if I might, sir.

253
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,964
-  Yes?
- What did she look like?

254
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,841
-  Well, she was a tall...
- Tall.

255
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,715
-  Attractive...
- Attractive.

256
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,845
-  Young lady.
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,841
She didn't speak much,
as I remember.

258
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,342
But she was, um...

259
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,931
-  She was --
- Smart, sir?

260
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,971
Fashionable.

261
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,481
Ah. Yes, sir.

262
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,235
Uh, can you tell me anything else
about her, sir?

263
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,610
No, I don't think so.

264
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,647
Aren't you going to write down
"fashionable"?

265
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,362
-  I think I can remember that, sir.
- Oh, good.

266
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,452
No, as a matter of fact,
she didn't stay very long.

267
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,117
And then, of course,
there was the money to be counted.

268
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,656
Yes. Yes.

269
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,745
Well, thank you very much indeed, sir.
You've been a great help.

270
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,831
I'm sorry to take up so much
of your valuable time.

271
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,413
Reasonably valuable, yes,
it certainly is.

272
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,832
-  Good day, sir.
- Good day, Inspector Pike.

273
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,092
Trout, sir.

274
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,424
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

275
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,889
Oh, by the way...

276
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,225
Sir?

277
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,180
That sign,
that mark on the amulet,

278
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,848
I don't know whether
this is of any assistance,

279
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,730
but, uh, it is, I believe, Hebrew.

280
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,317
Thank you very much, sir.

281
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,573
Hebrew.

282
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,954
This is it, sir.

283
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,578
It's a Hebrew symbol for blood.

284
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,500
Oh, I see.

285
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,710
Part of the G'Tach.

286
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,209
-  The what, sir?
- The G'Tach.

287
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:06,846
The 10 curses visited
upon the Pharaohs before Exodus.

288
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,890
-  Here, I'll show you.
- Thank you, sir.

289
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:14,475
They were all ancient maledictions...

290
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,810
solemn curses...

291
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,725
anathemas...

292
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,361
wished upon the Pharaohs
for keeping the Israelites in bondage.

293
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,272
Ah, here it is.

294
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:28,990
But, uh, all this would just be myth
of course, sir.

295
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,070
-  Oh, I think not.
- No?

296
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,534
No.

297
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,204
There is little doubt
that the plagues did occur,

298
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,710
though so distant now
as to seem a myth.

299
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,793
I see. Well, what form
would the curses take, sir?

300
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,543
Oh, such as the curse of boils,

301
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,837
of bats...

302
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,964
- Frogs?
- Frogs, yes.

303
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,594
And the curse of blood...

304
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,179
I see, sir, yes. I see.

305
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,937
Uh, these 10 curses, would they follow
any particular order?

306
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,017
Oh, that is a point

307
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,683
that Talmudic scholars have debated
for generations.

308
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,318
But there is no doubt
that the classical tradition

309
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,156
is the curse of boils, bats,

310
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,944
frogs, the curse of blood,

311
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,744
the curse of rats,

312
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:15,908
hail, of beasts,
the locusts, of course,

313
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,664
the death of the firstborn,

314
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,412
and then, finally, of darkness.

315
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,957
-  Darkness, Rabbi?
- Yes.

316
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:31,177
The final curse upon the land
to end forever the sleep of man.

317
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,468
My love.

318
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,102
Sweet queen and noble wife.

319
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:26,988
I alone remain
to bring delivery of your pain.

320
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:33,494
Severed, my darling, too quickly
from this life

321
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,624
of fires drawn and of memories met.

322
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:47,712
I shall hold our two hearts again
in single time.

323
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:54,715
I have prepared a little mathematical
equation for you, Inspector.

324
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,725
These files represent
all of the surgical cases

325
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,262
on which I have served
over a decade.

326
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,773
Some, uh...1,200.

327
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,855
As you know, modern surgery
is all a matter of teamwork,

328
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,522
sometimes requiring the services of,
oh, a dozen or more people --

329
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,565
interns, residents, other specialists.

330
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,699
Quite so, sir.

331
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:19,365
Now, ruling out all the cases
that are over five years old,

332
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,784
the year that Dr. Dunwoody,
our bat victim,

333
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,248
resumed his practice in London,

334
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,507
that leaves us 37 cases

335
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:35,092
on which I worked with any two
of the four now-dead men.

336
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,095
A scant dozen with three,

337
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,227
but only one...

338
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,897
just one case...

339
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,853
where I worked with all of them.

340
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,696
Victoria Regina Phi-bes.

341
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,986
I think they called it "Phibes."

342
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:02,749
Victoria Regina Phibes.
Born November the 27th, 1893.

343
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,912
Married, no children.

344
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:08,171
Diagnosis,
immediate radical resection.

345
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,715
Well, what happened?

346
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,045
We were too late.

347
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,587
Nine killed you.

348
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:21,385
Nine shall die,
and be returned your loss.

349
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,146
Nine times nine.

350
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,773
Nine killed you.

351
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,185
Nine shall die.

352
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:35,194
Nine eternities in doom!

353
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,197
-  Very attractive.
- Quite beautiful.

354
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,780
A strange presence even in death.

355
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,825
-  And the husband?
- Dr. Anton Phibes.

356
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,873
He was in Switzerland.
We cabled him.

357
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,211
But as he raced back,

358
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:54,134
his car went off the cliff
and he was burned to death.

359
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,335
Are you quite sure of that, sir?

360
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,176
I know it must be
a tempting theory for you, Inspector,

361
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,718
but they were interred
at the same time

362
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,634
in the family vault
just outside of London.

363
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,893
Were they fond of each other?

364
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,931
They seemed so.
Completely. Completely devoted.

365
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,814
Of course, you realize, don't you,
what your equation proves.

366
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,979
Someone, some madman,

367
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,820
has condemned
the whole surgical team for her death.

368
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,987
I mean, everybody in this list here,
including yourself.

369
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,372
Obviously, you're going to put
the remaining people involved

370
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,373
- under police protection.
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:32,793
Although, heaven knows from what.

372
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,253
<i>From the G'T ach, sir,
if you know what that is.</i>

373
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,463
Isn't that the, uh...

374
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,973
curse of the Pharaohs?

375
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,258
That's right, sir.
Quite right.

376
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,678
Someone is using
these ancient biblical curses

377
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:51,065
to kill everyone associated
with the Phibes operation.

378
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,402
But, I mean, the husband's dead,
there's no children,

379
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,565
it all happened ages ago,
so who the hell are we looking for?

380
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,870
There's a young lady
in a spot of trouble, Benson.

381
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,284
See if you can help her out.

382
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,086
Hello.
What have we got here?

383
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,048
Ah. Needing some help, Miss?

384
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,292
Hail, rats, beasts, locusts --
take your pick.

385
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,330
Or there's death of the firstborn
and, of course, darkness.

386
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,335
-  Darkness?
- Yes, darkness.

387
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,541
-  Coffee.
- Thank you.

388
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,051
On this list of Vesalius,

389
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,587
there are five people
who are in danger.

390
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,427
- There's Hedgepath, Kitaj --
- Oh, it's pronounced "Kit-eye. "

391
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,348
Oh.

392
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,477
Whitcombe, the woman Nurse Allen,
and Vesalius himself.

393
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:38,938
I've located everybody else,
but so far we can't find...Kitaj.

394
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,396
We think he's somewhere in Europe.

395
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,195
What about the Phibes estate
in Switzerland?

396
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,322
Well, the insurance
and bank accounts were closed

397
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,949
after his death was reported.

398
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,160
- So his money's still over there.
- No.

399
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,037
Two years ago, the bulk of the money
was transferred here to England.

400
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,369
- To whose account?
- I don't know.

401
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,543
But later it was withdrawn
by a woman in cash.

402
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:02,047
In fact, the whole estate
was transferred into her name.

403
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,628
A woman.

404
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,585
She tall, attractive,
hardly speaks a word?

405
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,674
Right.

406
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,132
Oh, now, I'm very interested in her.

407
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,269
It's a quarter to three

408
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:19,432
There's no one in the place

409
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,314
Except you and me

410
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:29,280
So, set 'em up, Joe

411
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,741
I've got a little story

412
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,032
I think you ought to know

413
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:43,214
We're drinking, my friend

414
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:49,926
To the end of a brief episode

415
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:57,266
So, make it one for my baby

416
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,772
And another one

417
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,774
For the road

418
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,653
Over here, Inspector.

419
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,489
We found him sitting off
to the side of the road, sir.

420
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,741
He's quite out of it, I'm afraid.
In shock.

421
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,281
You won't get much out of him,
poor devil.

422
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,790
Well, what happened to him?

423
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,825
- Well...
- Yeah, I see.

424
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,211
- Is that the car?
- Yes, sir.

425
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,749
We traced the owner, sir.
It's a man called Hedgepath.

426
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,384
Dr. Hedgepath?

427
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,173
Well, what's all this?

428
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,554
He's in the back, sir.

429
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,305
It's frozen solid.

430
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:05,000
A curse of hail
in the bloody middle of nowhere!

431
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,914
Take a look at this, sir.

432
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,715
He worked it off the motor.

433
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,845
He brought the internal temperature

434
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,340
down to at least 100 degrees
below zero.

435
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,890
Mercifully, he didn't feel much, sir.

436
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,897
Like hell he didn't.

437
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,214
Check.

438
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,926
Check.

439
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,258
Huh? Oh!

440
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,423
Well done.

441
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,966
Get up to bed.

442
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:04,059
Uh, it's not mate, father.
You can still move.

443
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,943
Oh, well, uh,
we'll finish tomorrow, Lem.

444
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,353
Up you go.

445
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,106
You -- You wouldn't like to
hear some --

446
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,321
I'm afraid I'm not
very good company tonight.

447
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,609
You read a little.

448
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,616
I must play to you tomorrow.

449
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,744
Old Darrow put me on to it.
It's a super piece.

450
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,998
Darrow.

451
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,501
You know,
the chap at the music shop.

452
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,002
Mm.

453
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,132
I always thought he was such a bore,
but what a fantastic memory he's got.

454
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,463
Get him talking
about the great organists...

455
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,378
Bridges, Drew, and Phibes,
he knew 'em all.

456
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,718
Anyway, 'night, Dad.

457
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,261
Good night.

458
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,041
Mr. Darrow.

459
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,372
Mr. Darrow, did you know this man?

460
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,303
Excuse me, Mr. Darrow.

461
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,464
Did you know this man?

462
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,769
Sixpence.

463
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,772
Yes, but...

464
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,774
did you know him?

465
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,575
Oh, God knows
what the old chap meant.

466
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,115
He couldn't tell you anything else?

467
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,534
He kept insisting in his strange way

468
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,998
that Phibes has been his patron
for years.

469
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,538
Mm.

470
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,666
And still is.

471
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,295
He didn't tell you what he looks like?

472
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,460
Oh, no, he's blind as a...

473
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,886
Well, he can hardly see at all.

474
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,265
Well, he might not be able to see,

475
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,893
but there's something
I very much want to have a look at.

476
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,520
May I use your phone?

477
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,608
I don't know what
you expect to find here.

478
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,609
I don't know exactly, sir,

479
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,486
but we've drawn a blank
everywhere else.

480
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,737
Fools.

481
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,406
Fools!

482
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,693
They'll have the worms soon enough.

483
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,531
What happened to the money?
The Phibes estate?

484
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,450
Oh, that's an immensely
complicated matter, sir.

485
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,584
It seems he had money invested
all over Europe,

486
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,995
but we're still investigating.

487
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,085
Trout...

488
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,920
where did he get all those degrees?

489
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,425
Ah, that I can tell you, sir.

490
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:42,464
He took, uh, a degree in music
in Germany at Heidel...

491
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,505
- Berg.
- ...Berg.

492
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,016
and another one in Paris at the...

493
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,267
- Sorbonne?
- Yes.

494
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:51,681
Uh, now, that was a PhD in theology.

495
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,770
Theology? Hm.

496
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:57,399
That rather neatly explains
his knowledge of the Old Testament.

497
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,188
The G'Tach, sir.

498
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,455
Open up, please.

499
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,526
Does anyone ever visit this place?

500
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,492
Well, someone has.

501
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,247
Are you sure that...?

502
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,175
Well, here he is.
Anton Phibes.

503
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,427
Right next to his wife.

504
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,763
Let's take a look.

505
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,729
Notice that smell.

506
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,683
ROSES?

507
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,565
No. More like formaldehyde.

508
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,146
Mind your fingers.

509
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,320
Careful.

510
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,456
There. Ashes. Anton Phibes.

511
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,366
Now are you satisfied?

512
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,707
Well, I'm not sure
that I am really, sir.

513
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,130
Now, just think about it.

514
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:25,884
All this proves is that somebody
was incinerated in that car crash.

515
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,802
Well, the Swiss police
have told us that already.

516
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:28,883
Exactly.

517
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,964
But suppose
for the sake of argument

518
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,092
that that somebody
was not Phibes at all,

519
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,931
but his chauffeur.

520
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,355
And Phibes is back in London?

521
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,856
Just like the old man told you.

522
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,611
She was not incinerated.

523
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,397
Let's have a look at her.

524
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,685
My love...

525
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,899
my sweet queen...

526
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,436
my noble wife,

527
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:33,362
severed too quickly, too cruelly,
from this life.

528
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:42,538
I remain and suffer
to bring delivery of your pain

529
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,750
of fires drawn

530
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:49,214
and of memories met.

531
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:55,429
Soon we shall hold
our two precious hearts

532
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,013
in single time.

533
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,651
This one here --
Kitaj or however you pronounce it --

534
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,694
- Schenley's on his way down there?
- Yes, sir.

535
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,239
Crow!
I've been looking for you.

536
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:19,452
Now, this is most unsettling.

537
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,786
Thank God the newspapers
have been slow

538
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,201
in picking up these stories so far.

539
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,584
Well, we've managed
to withhold most --

540
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,745
I don't proposed to go
into the seriousness of this, Crow,

541
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,381
- but if the press do get hold of this --
- We'd have a disaster on our hands.

542
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,963
What the hell do you think we've got
at the moment?

543
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,220
And if we don't handle this
with kid gloves,

544
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,051
there'll be questions in the House.

545
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,389
This whole thing's
a political time bomb.

546
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,674
Do you realize that?

547
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,094
We're, all of us, as vulnerable as hell.

548
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:41,056
Especially me.

549
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,641
The men are working
as hard as they can.

550
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,555
That's not hard enough!

551
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:44,939
Now, Crow, you come upstairs
with me.

552
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,317
- You... What's your name?
- Trout, sir.

553
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,443
Oh, Trout.

554
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,694
I don't know what the hell
you're doing standing there.

555
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:50,900
- Where's your jacket?
- Um --

556
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,063
You get out there
with the rest of them.

557
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:56,322
There's a madman out there,
and I want him brought in here now!

558
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,613
And another thing, Crow...

559
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,035
- All right, Harry?
- Okay.

560
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,596
Okay, Dr. Kitaj...brakes on.

561
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:06,684
Brakes on.

562
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,143
Throttle closed.

563
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:09,440
Throttle closed.

564
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,809
Switches off.

565
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:11,852
Switches off.

566
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,739
Throttle set.

567
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,615
Throttle set.

568
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,358
Contact.

569
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,861
Contact.

570
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,221
Well, you should have driven faster!

571
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,260
Faster?

572
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,680
As it was, I got there
a couple of minutes before the locals.

573
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,439
Yeah, but two minutes after the crash.

574
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,147
I was going over 90 miles an hour
through the outskirts of the town.

575
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,812
I thought the damn thing was going
to explode a couple of times.

576
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,446
Whose --
Whose car is it, by the way?

577
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,943
Oh, God knows.

578
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:45,982
When we got the call about Kitaj,

579
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,026
I came down to the Yard
and got the fastest car I could see.

580
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,991
But I mean, it is one of ours?

581
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,702
It must be. There's a --
a police book in -- in the front.

582
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,207
Uh-huh.

583
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,867
It's gonna need a damn good service
now, though.

584
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,128
A couple of the oil seals have gone.

585
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,163
Hey, you!
What's your name? Pike!

586
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,582
Uh, Trout, sir.

587
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,126
- Why has my car been moved?
- Your --

588
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,006
Yes.

589
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,967
- Is it your car, sir?
- Well, of course it's my car!

590
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,631
It's a very sophisticated piece
of machinery.

591
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,425
It's not to be moved at all,
not even pushed.

592
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,676
- Do you understand?
- Perfectly, sir.

593
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,061
The engine's not run in yet.

594
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,814
Have we located this fellow Kitaj yet?

595
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,350
Pronounced "Kit-eye," sir.

596
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:21,894
Well, uh, that's a bit
of a long story, sir.

597
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,403
I wanted to talk to you about him.
You see, the fact is --

598
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:26,903
I'll expect your report in the morning.
I can't wait now.

599
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,363
I say, any more news
on this fellow Pheebs?

600
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,031
Phibes, sir.

601
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:37,667
Are you in the habit of contradicting
your superiors, Bream?

602
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,211
Well, we are on to him, sir.

603
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:42,251
But where are you concentrating
the search?

604
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,670
I mean, where was he last seen?

605
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,585
- Highgate, sir.
- Highgate?

606
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,923
Good. whereabouts?

607
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,214
- Well, the cemetery, sir.
- The cemetery?

608
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,007
Yes, sir.
That's where he's buried.

609
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,301
Good. Well done, Perch.

610
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,697
And this nurse?

611
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,955
- Nurse Allen.
- Yes.

612
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,787
Yes, I've got men
all around the hospital.

613
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,793
- Vesalius?
- I've got him covered, too.

614
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,750
And That just leaves that fellow...

615
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,380
- Dr. Whitcombe.
- Yeah, Dr. Whitcombe.

616
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,540
Well, we're gonna take him
off to the country for a few days

617
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:50,875
if he'll come with us.

618
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,760
If he'll come with us?

619
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,887
I appreciate your concern, Sergeant,

620
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,013
but you must understand

621
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,221
that I owe it to my patients
to be back in London within the week.

622
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:00,010
Of course, Doctor.

623
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,553
I guarantee we'll have you back here
within a few days.

624
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,767
Let me take that, sir.

625
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,648
Inspector Trout, sir.

626
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:09,061
I must say,
I feel rather like a head of state!

627
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,837
All right now. Careful, son.

628
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,550
Easy does it.
I think it's a left-hand thread.

629
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,967
Yes, it is.

630
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,971
Shh.

631
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,563
It's coming.

632
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:47,895
Yeah, pull...

633
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,936
Gentlemen, can't we have
a little quiet in this club?

634
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:51,898
Pull.

635
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,147
It's brass!

636
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:39,534
He's cast the thing in bloody brass!

637
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,287
It appears to have been fired
by a catapult, sir.

638
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,622
Oh, brilliant.

639
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,051
Where can we find

640
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:05,060
two better hemispheres

641
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,563
without sharp north,

642
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,976
without declining west?

643
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:17,648
My face in thine eye.

644
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:22,194
Thine in mine appears.

645
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,910
And true, plain hearts

646
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:31,294
do in the faces rest.

647
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:41,968
Within 24 hours,
my work will be finished.

648
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,385
And then, my precious jewel,

649
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:51,728
I will join you in your setting.

650
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:57,734
We shall be reunited forever

651
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:04,320
in a secluded corner
of the great Elysian field

652
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:08,698
of the beautiful beyond.

653
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,628
Seventy men are active on this case,

654
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,334
trying to find a man who,
according to you,

655
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,544
has been buried once.

656
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:18,799
It's one of Trout's theories, sir.

657
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,001
Well, I don't know
about Trout's theories,

658
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,715
but I've had a bellyful
of Trout's practice.

659
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,887
- Ah, I'm talking about you.
- Sir?

660
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,549
Now, it seems to me
that with immaculate precision,

661
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:30,687
you've been arriving on the scene
just after the victim's death.

662
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:34,349
Now, this time, due no doubt
to some organizational oversight,

663
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,734
you arrived there before the crime.

664
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,770
But as I've come to expect
from you two,

665
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,321
that made little difference.

666
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,277
It was still committed.

667
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:46,369
A brass unicorn has been catapulted
across a London street

668
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,034
and impaled an eminent surgeon.

669
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,533
Words fail me, gentlemen.

670
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,667
- Yes, excuse me, sir.
- Where are you off to now, Trout?

671
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,500
- The lavatory, sir.
- Highly appropriate.

672
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,481
- Evening, Constable.
- Sir.

673
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,366
- Everything quite normal?
- Nothing to report, sir.

674
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:08,697
Good.

675
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:30,432
The whole place is completely sealed.
It's as simple as that.

676
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,593
Simplicity isn't exactly
the word I'd use

677
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:36,683
in dealing with this man, Inspector.

678
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,520
I've got half the Yard, sir,
plus some of the local boys

679
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:41,559
and a small mobile unit here.

680
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,320
I've got cars all round the place
here, here, and here

681
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,906
and, of course,
some plainclothes men.

682
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:52,078
So unless he drops in on us
from above in a balloon,

683
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,909
which I wouldn't put past him,

684
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,956
she should be safe.

685
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,414
Supposing...

686
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,121
he's in the building already.

687
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,835
I hope he is.

688
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:08,378
'Cause if he's in, he can't get out,
and we've got him.

689
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:15,803
After all, he has killed 7 people
in the last 14 days.

690
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,937
- Dr. Vesalius.
- Ah.

691
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,015
What on Earth are you doing here?

692
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,775
You're not involved in this charade,
I hope.

693
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,401
I am afraid I am, Nurse.

694
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:28,110
Doctor, these men have told me that
I must not leave the hospital building.

695
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,023
- Now, why me?
- For your own...

696
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,232
Surely that's not right.

697
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,493
- Nurse Allen, please.
- Just what is going on here?

698
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,619
Please, Miss, if you'll be so good
as to to your room,

699
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:35,613
we'll have your supper sent up to you.

700
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,282
I've already eaten, thank you, Officer.

701
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,871
- Now, Dr. Vesalius --
- Inspector Trout is doing his best.

702
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,752
Now, please,
you must go to your room

703
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,504
and stay there for at least 24 hours.

704
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,539
- Twenty--
- Now, don't say a word, please.

705
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,208
I know just what your feelings are.

706
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:48,126
Please come.

707
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:51,296
The police have reason to believe...

708
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,982
And just what do the police
have reason to believe, Doctor?

709
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,911
Uh, do you remember assisting me
in an operation four years ago?

710
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:15,991
Yes.

711
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,618
Well, in connection with that,
the police have reason to believe

712
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,536
that a...a man
is going to try to kill you.

713
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,672
Kill me?
Yes, uh, within a few hours.

714
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,542
I'm sorry.

715
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,132
I don't know how you expect me
to sleep with all this going on, Doctor.

716
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:39,142
I suggest you take a sleeping pill.

717
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,143
Good night.

718
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,100
Good night!

719
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:06,477
There is one aspect of this situation
we have not yet explored.

720
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,437
Oh, don't worry about it, sir.

721
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,436
Sooner or later, he's gonna get
stopped by the oldest snag of all --

722
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:12,444
human error.

723
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,071
Oh, human error won't stop him.

724
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,107
Why? What do you mean?

725
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:19,034
He's had years to hide,

726
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,321
to plot this damnable thing.

727
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:24,741
He's compelling himself to follow
exactly the classic death pattern

728
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,124
of the G'Tach.

729
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:28,168
It's a psychic force
that holds the man together,

730
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,497
this maniacal precision.

731
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:34,008
If we could just throw it off,
interrupt the cycle,

732
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:38,637
then he might be stopped
by his own inflexible standards.

733
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:35,606
Three curses left.

734
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,309
YES.

735
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:41,361
Uh, of course, the, um,
the thought does occur,

736
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:42,984
if you'll pardon the liberty, sir,

737
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,865
that it could be your turn tonight.

738
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,991
I've considered that.

739
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,495
I have a feeling he's saving
something special for me,

740
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,404
that I'll be last.

741
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,956
After all, I was chief surgeon
on the case.

742
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,742
Yes, well, if he keeps
to the classic pattern,

743
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,626
it should be the darkness
for you, sir,

744
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,038
though heaven knows
what that could be.

745
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:03,797
Have you, um, have you considered
the death of the firstborn, sir?

746
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,303
Well, the fact that
my older brother is dead

747
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:10,345
should surely exclude me
from that particular curse.

748
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:11,892
Well, you must just resign yourself
to the fact

749
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,802
that I am going to remain
by your side

750
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,562
until we apprehend this man.

751
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,019
- Thank you.
- Not at all, sir. It...

752
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,814
What about your firstborn?

753
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,728
- Schenley!
- Ah?

754
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,776
Get two cars, take the doctor home,

755
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:25,819
- put a guard on his house...
- My God.

756
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,236
...alert the local division,
and report back here.

757
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:29,447
- Right.
- The sergeant will take you, sir.

758
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,006
The back door was hanging off.
The lock had been forced.

759
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,920
Bit of a struggle upstairs
by the look of it.

760
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,964
Oh, the lad's been
taken all right.

761
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,349
Stay here with Vesalius.

762
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,351
I'll get back to Trout.

763
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:40,855
Poor little devil.

764
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,329
The boy's gone.

765
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,661
Oh, no! Any sign of Phibes?

766
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,076
No, none at all.

767
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,415
We'll go check on Nurse Allen,
and then we'll get over there.

768
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,917
- How's he taking it?
- Vesalius? You can imagine.

769
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,206
Yeah.

770
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:24,558
Open it.

771
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,268
Slowly.

772
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:11,231
Soon, Victoria, soon.

773
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:17,119
But one world to possess.

774
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:22,204
There to love and sleep again

775
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:28,047
in our own eternal paradise.

776
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:37,931
We're doing everything we can, sir.

777
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,433
Perhaps a little brandy might help.

778
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:01,489
There must have been something
I could have done to prevent this.

779
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:06,602
Hello?

780
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:11,418
Who's there?

781
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:33,028
Nine killed her.

782
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,820
Nine shall die.

783
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,234
Is that you, Phibes?

784
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:40,903
Phibes?

785
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:41,678
Phibes?

786
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:45,415
Eight have died.

787
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:49,124
Soon to be nine.

788
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:54,463
Nine eternities in doom.

789
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,174
Phibes, I--I must see you.

790
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,889
Where are you, Phibes?

791
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,050
I must speak...

792
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,969
Phibes!
Where is my son, Phibes?!

793
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:10,983
The organ plays till midnight.

794
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:17,198
The large house in Maldine Square.

795
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,484
Come alone.

796
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,283
I'm going alone.

797
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,498
Perhaps he'll trade my life
for my son's.

798
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,504
If you think you can reason with him,
then you're as mad as he is!

799
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:34,714
- Trout --
- Oh, no, we're coming with you.

800
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:35,632
We'll break the place open.

801
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:37,505
Your men have made
very little contribution

802
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:38,543
to this ghastly affair.

803
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,133
Their presence there could only
accelerate the death of my son!

804
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,344
I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot
allow you to go there alone.

805
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,599
My son's life is at stake!

806
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,351
We shall take every possible
precaution, sir,

807
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,228
but I cannot allow you
to go there alone.

808
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:48,995
I am.

809
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:51,477
I am prepared to use force
if necessary!

810
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,608
I'm very sorry, sir,
but you are my responsibility.

811
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,611
All right, all right. All right, Trout.
I'll do whatever you say.

812
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,649
At least there's time for me
to make a telephone call, I hope.

813
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,193
If you're quick, sir, yes.

814
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,865
Your brandy.

815
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,335
I'm sorry, too, Trout.

816
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:45,720
Good evening, Dr. Vesalius.

817
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,348
I have come for my son.

818
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,850
He will die at midnight.

819
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,850
If you must take a life, 
take mine.

820
01:18:54,021 --> 01:19:00,861
I will have killed nine times
in my life, Dr. Vesalius.

821
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:04,986
How many murders
can be attributed to you?

822
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:08,368
None. I did not kill your wife.

823
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:11,370
- No?
- I tried to save her.

824
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:13,616
With a knife in your hand?

825
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:18,208
Doctor, I have no faith
in your profession.

826
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:24,002
I was told after my crash
that I would never speak again.

827
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,387
The doctors were, 
of course, wrong.

828
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:30,094
For as you see and can hear,

829
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:34,478
I have used my knowledge
of music and acoustics

830
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,934
to re-create my voice.

831
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:41,273
You don't have to remind me
of your ingenuity, Dr. Phibes.

832
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,435
Where...

833
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,854
Where is my son?!

834
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:49,444
May I give you one final reminder,
Dr. Vesalius?

835
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,912
You will see your son
under circumstances

836
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:58,335
which may bring back memories
to you.

837
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:05,750
What is it you want?

838
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:11,924
The skill of your hands, Doctor.

839
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:19,357
I am giving your son the same
chance that my wife had.

840
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:23,940
You need not be alarmed.

841
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:28,900
He has already been anaesthetized.

842
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:35,280
Your wife, no, Phibes,
but you I will kill.

843
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:38,747
But you can't, Doctor.

844
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:43,163
I am already dead.

845
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:46,924
Your son needs you.

846
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,085
Sergeant!

847
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:43,228
Are you receiving me, Vesalius?

848
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:48,362
That is an x-ray
of your son's rib cage.

849
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:50,447
You will see from it

850
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:55,486
that a tiny key has been lodged
close to his heart.

851
01:21:55,661 --> 01:22:00,909
It will unlock the halter
around your son's neck

852
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,918
and will free the trolley.

853
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:10,968
If you are wondering why you need
to free the operating table,

854
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:18,392
then I suggest you look
above his head, Doctor.

855
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:24,899
In a few moments, acid will
be released into that tube.

856
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:28,026
It will creep down

857
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:32,481
slowly, inexorably.

858
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:39,659
It will take six minutes
to reach the outlet over his face.

859
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:44,751
Exactly six minutes, Doctor.

860
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:13,897
Please hurry.

861
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:04,823
For God's sake!

862
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:10,921
Don't cry upon God, 
Dr. Vesalius.

863
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,540
He is on my side!

864
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:19,588
He led me, showed me the way
in my quest for vengeance.

865
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:21,973
Not God, Doctor.

866
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,929
<i>Look to yourself.</i>

867
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:27,972
Those hands,
those skilled hands of yours.

868
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:32,483
You can be his only salvation.

869
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:36,446
Look above your son, Doctor.

870
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:39,566
Vulnavia,

871
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,781
my work is nearly finished.

872
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,324
Go now.

873
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,457
Destroy all I have created.

874
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,873
Work faster, Doctor.

875
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,753
The acid is descending.

876
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:59,879
My wife existed only six minutes
on the operating table,

877
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:03,298
and then she was dead.

878
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:05,466
You murdered her.

879
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:08,432
- No!
- Murdered her!

880
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:11,348
But he will have what
she did not --

881
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,516
a second chance.

882
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:39,798
Perhaps your hands will shake
and he, too, will die under your knife.

883
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:44,760
A few remaining minutes
are all you have,

884
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:49,849
because when the acid reaches him,

885
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:54,892
he will have a face like mine.

886
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,479
Follow me, men.

887
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,116
Vesalius! Is the boy all right?

888
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,572
YES.

889
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:30,050
Turn that damn thing off!

890
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,514
We'll need an ambulance for Lem.

891
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:37,223
Well, what about...?

892
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:39,768
Oh.

893
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:46,813
Right!

894
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,066
The two of you get downstairs
and bring that boy up here.

895
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,609
The rest of you,
keep searching the house.

896
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:53,073
We have got to find Phibes.

897
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,704
Oh, where the hell is he?!

898
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:27,861
Where the devil did
this come from?

899
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,148
Well, what comes up must go down.

900
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:31,691
Brilliant.

901
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:35,658
Ah-ah, no. Don't touch it, sir.
Much better to leave it to us.

902
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,697
Never know, it could be a trap.

903
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:24,038
He's gone. 
Vanished.

904
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,290
That's bloody impossible.

905
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:29,828
That still leaves the
final curse.

906
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:31,416
Darkness.

907
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,039
Well, he'll be working on it.

908
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,417
Wherever he is.
