1
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:08,041
The Crime Rate in the United States
Rises Four Hundred Percent.

2
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,750
The once-great city of New York

3
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,916
becomes the one maximum-security prison
for the entire country.

4
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,041
A fifty-foot containment wall
is erected along the New Jersey shoreline,...

5
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,333
across the Harlem river,
and down along the Brooklyn shoreline.

6
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,208
It completely surrounds Manhattan Island.

7
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,333
All bridges and waterways are mined.

8
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:41,500
The United States Police Force, like an army,
is encamped around the island.

9
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,500
There are no guards inside the prison:

10
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,625
only prisoners and the worlds
they have made.

11
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:54,500
The rules are simple.
Once you go in, you don't come out.

12
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,458
This is Gotham 4, North Bay, Station 17.

13
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,458
I have an escape in progress.

14
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,375
An object in mid-bay moving toward the wall.

15
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,208
You have 10 seconds.  Turn around.
Start back to the island.

16
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,833
Gotham 4, confirm the kill.

17
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,333
Circled the base.  Over.

18
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,958
Security, this is Rehme.
We have confirmation from Gotham 4.

19
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,125
We have a kill in midharbor. South of
the battery. Two in the water dead.

20
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,625
Two confirmed.

21
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,125
Very well.

22
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,708
Air traffic, this is Rehme ...

23
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,250
"No talking.  No smoking.
Follow the ORANGE line."

24
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,041
Attention.  You are now entering
the debarkation area.

25
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,041
No talking.  No
smoking.

26
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,041
Follow the orange line
to the processes area.

27
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,708
The next scheduled departure to
the prison is in two hours.

28
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,708
You now have the option to terminate
and be cremated on the premises

29
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:37,416
If you elect this option, notify the
duty sergeant in your processing area.

30
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,000
Hold on!

31
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,000
We've got a small jet in trouble,
over restricted air space.

32
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,666
- Where is it?
- Seven miles out and closing.

33
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:35,166
We've been on the board for the last 20
minutes. We haven't been able to reach them.

34
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,375
There was a transmission 10 minutes ago.

35
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:41,250
He identified as "David 14."
Then all of a sudden he was cut off.

36
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,666
David 14, acknowledge.

37
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,541
David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.

38
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,958
Squawk 7700,

39
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,458
contact on 121.5.

40
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,458
There's still no reply.

41
00:09:55,541 --> 00:10:00,041
Bayonne.  I have a mayday in restricted space.

42
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,833
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

43
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,916
- You have the code?
- There's no David 14 on the computer.

44
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,541
- Unlisted?
- Unregistered code.

45
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,416
We telexed Washington.
Still waiting for a reply.

46
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,625
I think I've got him, sir.

47
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,916
It's too late, assholes.

48
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,416
All your imperialist weapons and lies
can't save him now.

49
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,208
We're going down. We're going to crash.

50
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,708
David 14, acknowledge!

51
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,791
The code's coming in, sir.

52
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,083
"Aircraft Identified.

53
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,875
Code: David14.

54
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,291
Decode: AIR FORCE ONE."

55
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,666
Tell this to the workers when
they ask where your leader went ...

56
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:03,791
We, the soldiers of the national
liberation front of America,

57
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,250
in the name of the workers

58
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,083
and all the oppressed of
this imperialist country

59
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:14,666
have struck a fatal blow to
the racist police stick!

60
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,958
What better revolutionary example
than to let the president perish

61
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,958
in the inhuman dungeon of
his own imperialist prison?

62
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,125
Unlock the pod!
She's bolted the door.

63
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,250
- Can't you shoot off the lock?
- No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.

64
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,541
How about lifting the door off of the hinges?

65
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,541
No, sir.

66
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,750
Get me to the pod.

67
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,416
Sir, this is a locating device to trace you
if you become separated from the pod.

68
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,833
I'm activating it now.

69
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,708
God save me and watch over you all.

70
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,083
Computer simulation tracking Air Force One.

71
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,791
The plane goes down.

72
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,083
It's the escape pod.

73
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,791
40 degrees,

74
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,458
50 yards from impact.

75
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,250
I'm going in.

76
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,916
1-W-Larry.  Over the battery.

77
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,916
We're moving down.

78
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,916
Direct sight ahead.

79
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,291
You touch me... he dies.

80
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,000
If you're not in the air
in thirty seconds...he dies.

81
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,791
You come back in... he dies.

82
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,375
- Twenty seconds.
- I'm ready to talk.

83
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,666
19...18...

84
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,666
- What do you want?
- 17...16...

85
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,541
Let's go.  Let's go!

86
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,625
Yes, he's right here,
Mr. Vice President.

87
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,041
This is Bob Hauk.

88
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,416
We can't.  If we move in with choppers,
they'll kill him.

89
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,708
We're lucky if he's not dead already...

90
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,625
They don't want anything yet. By the time they
figure out what they want,it'll be too late.

91
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,708
Tell him we have to go with your plan now.

92
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,500
We can't wait until tomorrow. If we have to move
in and take the island, it's a last resort.

93
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:13,083
It's 8:45. I want permission to try a
rescue.

94
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,416
Thank you.

95
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,875
All right.

96
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,208
- He's dangerous sir.
- I know. I'll be ok.

97
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,750
I'm not a fool, Plissken.

98
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,958
Call me Snake.

99
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,875
S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.

100
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,833
Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.

101
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,041
Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.

102
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,833
.  Youngest man to be decorated
by the President.

103
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,750
You robbed the federal reserve depository.

104
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,041
Life sentence, New York
Maximum Security Penitentiary.

105
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,833
I'm ready to kick your
ass out of the world, War Hero.

106
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,708
- Who are you?
- Hauk

107
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,208
Police Commissioner.

108
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,416
Bob Hauk.

109
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,916
Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.
We heard of you, too, Plissken.

110
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,791
- Why are we talking?
- I have a deal for you.

111
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,083
You'll receive full pardon for every criminal
act committed in the United States.

112
00:18:55,291 --> 00:19:00,000
There was an accident about an hour ago.
A small jet went down inside New York City.

113
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,583
The President was on board.

114
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,583
President of what?

115
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,291
That's not funny, Plissken.

116
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,875
You go in, find the President and
bring him out in 24 hours,

117
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,500
- and you're a free man.
- 24 hours, huh?

118
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,791
- I'm making you an offer.
- Bullshit.

119
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,291
- Straight just like I said.
- I'll think about it.

120
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,375
No time.  Give me an answer.

121
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,458
Get a new president.

122
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,875
We're still at war, Plissken.
We need him alive.

123
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:30,250
I don't give a fuck about your war...
or your president.

124
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,875
- Is that your answer?
- I'm thinking about it.

125
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,375
Think hard.

126
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,541
Why me?

127
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,958
You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.

128
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,833
You know how to get in quiet.

129
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,958
You're all I've got.

130
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,541
I guess I go in one way or the other.
Doesn't mean shit to me. Give me the paper.

131
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,250
- When you come out.
- Before.

132
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,125
I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.

133
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,333
Call me Snake.

134
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:11,916
Some of them have cars. They took old junkers
that were left behind and converted them to steam.

135
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,500
We think they may also have a gasoline source
in there, and power.

136
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,916
Greenhouses, rigged up generators.
Some areas have streetlights.

137
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,625
The crazies.

138
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:24,625
Live in the subways.  Complete control
of the underground.

139
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,208
They're night raiders.

140
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,583
Tracer.  Sends a radio signal
for fifteen minutes.

141
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,291
You push it, we can track you on radar.
Just like Leningrad.

142
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,000
But they added something.  A
safety catch.

143
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,375
Where am I landing?

144
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,291
Top of the world trade center.
Only place you can land.

145
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,375
They won't see it, and you can t
take off from a free fall.

146
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,166
On the roof there's a
service elevator.

147
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,375
It's still operational.
We use it to infiltrate the prison.

148
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:06,166
There's a power box.
It'll activate the elevator down to fifty.

149
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,750
From there on down you walk.

150
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,041
You can locate the President by
his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.

151
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,250
It sends out a sig pulse.  Use this.

152
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:19,166
Homing device.
Shows directions and distance.

153
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:26,750
Strong antitoxin. Stops bacteria
and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.

154
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,625
- Take off the jacket.
- I'll be OK.

155
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,125
Let's go, Plissken.

156
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,041
I don't like needles.

157
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,625
22 hours, 29 minutes,
57 seconds...

158
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,125
We talked about twenty-four.

159
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,500
In 22 hours the Hartford Summit
meeting will be over.

160
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,208
China and the Soviet Union
will go back home.

161
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:06,500
The president was on his way to the
summit when his plane went down.

162
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,708
He has a briefcase attached to his wrist.

163
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:13,500
The tape recording inside has
to reach Hartford in 22 hours.

164
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,291
What's on it?

165
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,416
You know anything about nuclear fusion?

166
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,291
All right.

167
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,708
It's about the survival of
the human race, Plissken.

168
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,708
Something you don't give a shit about.

169
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm going to inject you.
It'll sting for a second or two...

170
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,083
That's it, Plissken.

171
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,750
Tell him.

172
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,958
Tell me what?

173
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,375
That idea you had about turning
the Gullfire around 180 degrees

174
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:03,541
and flying off to Canada.

175
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,333
What did you do to me, asshole?

176
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,750
My idea, Plissken.

177
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,833
Something we've been fooling around with. Two
microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.

178
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,541
They're already starting
to dissolve.

179
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,333
In twenty-two hours, the cores
will completely dissolve.

180
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:22,041
Inside the cores are
that heat-sensitive charge.

181
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,125
Not a large explosive.

182
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,833
About the size of a pinhead.

183
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:30,208
big enough to --
open up both your arteries.

184
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,416
I'd say you'd be dead
in 10 or 15 seconds --

185
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,000
- TAKE THEM OUT NOW.
- They're protected by the cores.

186
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,500
minutes before the last hour is
up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.

187
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,583
We'll burn out the charges IF
you have the President.

188
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,208
What if I'm a little late?

189
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:57,208
No more Hartford Summit.
And no more Snake Plissken.

190
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,583
When I get back I'm going to kill you.

191
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,791
The Gullfire's waiting.

192
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,125
I'm ready.

193
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,916
21 hours.

194
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,833
Suppose he's dead, Hauk.

195
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,416
If I come back without him,
you'll burn these things out?

196
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,708
Get them both back, Plissken.

197
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:11,333
Remember, once inside you're on your own

198
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,916
- Oh, you mean I can't count on you?
- No.

199
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,416
Good.

200
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,291
"Master Life Clock"

201
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,583
20:17:43... 42... 41....

202
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,500
30 seconds.

203
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,666
Are you picking up the target blip?

204
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,583
Right on course.

205
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,250
It's been a while ...

206
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,625
How's your altitude?

207
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,041
Plissken?

208
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:51,541
Plissken?
Plissken, what are you doing?

209
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:54,125
Playing with myself.  I'm going in.

210
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,750
Plissken? Plissken?

211
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:48,916
I'm inside the World Trade Center
on the 50th floor.

212
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:52,291
- Just like Leningrad, Hauk.
- Is the glider intact?

213
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:56,916
Yeah, but taking off is for shit.
I'll work it out.

214
00:28:56,916 --> 00:29:01,291
You'll have to use the east stairwell.
It'll take you a little while to
get to ground level.

215
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,708
Call me when you get outside.

216
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:06,375
I'm at the plane.

217
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,875
Nobody else made it, Hauk.

218
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,166
Wait a minute.

219
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,750
I've got his pulse.

220
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:21,166
Right up ahead, moving northwest.

221
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:10,375
Hey!  You're Snake Plissken, ain't you?

222
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,166
- What do you want?
- Nothin'.

223
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,458
I thought you were dead!

224
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:25,458
Hey!  You don't want to
walk around down there, Snake!

225
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,000
Hi, Chief.  Nice night.

226
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,000
Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey.

227
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,375
Easy now, chief.

228
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm walking.  I'm walking.

229
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,875
Mr. President ...

230
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,666
I'm the President?
Sure, I'm the President.

231
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,666
If I knew where I got this thing --
I'd be the President.

232
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:30,958
- Where did you get it?
- I woke up, and there it was,
just like a miracle ...

233
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:35,958
The President's life signs all fail.

234
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,250
Oh my god ...

235
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:42,750
It ... It may be just an impact
on the mechanism itself ...

236
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,625
Hauk?

237
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,708
I'm right here, Plissken.

238
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:52,208
I don't know who you assholes are
looking at, but it's NOT the President.

239
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,916
Hail to the chief... La la la la la la...

240
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,500
All right, get your machine ready.
I'm coming out.

241
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,708
18 hours, Plissken.

242
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:08,416
Listen to me, Hauk. The President is DEAD,
you got that? Somebody's had him for dinner!

243
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,708
Plissken, if you get back in that
glider I'll shoot you down.

244
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:14,083
You climb out, I'll burn you off the wall.

245
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,916
You understand that, Plissken?

246
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:23,083
A little human compassion ...

247
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,875
- You a cop?
- No.

248
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,708
You've got a gun.

249
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,875
You got a smoke?

250
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,958
Keep your hand over it.

251
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,875
It's all right if we're quiet.
They won't hear us.

252
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:07,750
Hey, this is a real one.  You just get in?

253
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:10,375
What's going on out there?

254
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,250
Crazies.

255
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:15,250
It's the end of the month.  They're out of food.

256
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,875
Do you live here?

257
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:23,166
Skulls?  You kidding?
I'm with the Turks now.

258
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,541
I just got caught in the street after
dark and now I'm stuck here all night.

259
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:29,041
- A plane crashed seven hours ago.  Did you see it?
- No.

260
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,625
Shit.

261
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,416
- You're a cop.
- I'm an asshole.

262
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,208
Hey, wait a minute.

263
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,833
I know who you are.

264
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,208
Yeah!  But I heard you were
dead.

265
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,708
I am.

266
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:57,416
Wow, Snake Plissken.  All right!
What you doing in here with a gun, Snake?

267
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:59,416
Looking for somebody.

268
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,125
- Who?
- The President.

269
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:05,625
Come on!  He really here?

270
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,625
Somewhere.

271
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:13,791
When you find him,

272
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:16,083
are you gonna take him out?

273
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:21,791
Take me out with you, Snake.

274
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,291
Why?

275
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,375
I can think of lots of reasons why ...

276
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,750
Where you goin', buddy?

277
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:43,166
Bad neighborhood! You don't want to be
walking from the Bowery to 42nd street at night!

278
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:47,833
I've been driving a cab here for 30 years
and you don't walk around here at night!

279
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,541
Yes, sir!

280
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,958
They'll kill you and strip
you in ten seconds flat.

281
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:57,416
Usually I'm not down around here myself,
but I wanted to catch that show.

282
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:59,625
This stuff is like gold around here, you know.

283
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:12,041
Hey, Snake, when'd you get in?
I didn't even know they caught you.

284
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:16,125
Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab.

285
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,125
Wait'll I tell Eddie!

286
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:19,625
Hey, hang on, Snake.

287
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:33,208
- Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake?
- Looking for somebody.

288
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:37,208
Well, why didn't you ask me?
Hell, I know everybody in this town.

289
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:41,208
I've been driving this cab for
thirty years, this very same cab.

290
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:43,875
I'm GONNA ask you.

291
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,791
Now where's the President?

292
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:49,375
The Duke's got him!
Everyone knows the Duke's got him!

293
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,666
You don't have to put a gun to my head.
I'll tell you!

294
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,958
- Who's the Duke?
- The DUKE!

295
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:58,583
The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!
The big man, that's who!

296
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:03,458
I want to meet this Duke.

297
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:07,875
You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy?
Nobody wants to meet the Duke!

298
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,958
You meet him once and then you're dead!

299
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:38,333
I hate to leave her on the street.

300
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:42,833
Usually I don't leave her alone at all.

301
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:48,041
But you're a special case, Snake.

302
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:18,208
It's OK, Snake.  It's a better neighborhood.
You can relax.

303
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:23,291
Thanks.

304
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,375
Boy, they got a great place here.
Like a fortress!

305
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,291
They?

306
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,791
- Who is it?
- It's me!

307
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:33,875
- Who's me?
- Cabbie!

308
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:36,166
What do you want?

309
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:38,458
Somebody wants to see Brain, it's important --

310
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,583
- No way, Cabbie --
- No, it's Snake!  Snake Plissken!

311
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,875
Snake Plissken.

312
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:55,166
YOU'RE Plissken?

313
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,375
He wants to see Brain.

314
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,833
Why?

315
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,958
I want to meet the Duke.

316
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:32,125
Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake?
It used to be a public library.

317
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,625
Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest!

318
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,125
Mr. Fabulous!

319
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:38,208
Duke loves him.

320
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:43,791
- Who is that?
- That's Maggie.  Brain's squeeze.

321
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:47,291
Duke gave him to Brain just to
keep him happy ...

322
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:49,416
...see what I mean?

323
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:53,916
Heard you were dead.

324
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:05,500
Brain?  Brain!
I brought somebody to see you!

325
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,500
Harold Hellman.

326
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,666
Snake?

327
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:16,083
Harold?

328
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:20,291
Where you been, Harold?
It's been a long time.

329
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,750
You never told me you
knew Snake Plissken, Brain.

330
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:27,666
Isn't that great?  Hey, Brain, I could use
some gas if you can spare some ...

331
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,458
I'm glad you remember me.

332
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:37,375
Yeah.  A man should remember his past.

333
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,333
Kansas City, four years ago.
You ran out on me.

334
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:44,458
- You left me sitting there.
- You were late.

335
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:47,333
We were buddies, Harold.

336
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:51,541
You, me, and Fresno Bob.
You know what they did to Bob?

337
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:58,750
You want to see him sprayed all over
that map, baby? Where's the President?!

338
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,750
- Swear to god, Snake, I don't know --
- Don't fuck with me!

339
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:06,041
- Why do you want to know?
- I want him.

340
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:10,625
- Working for the man now, huh?
- Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze --

341
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,708
Mm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is

342
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:16,500
and unless you know EXACTLY PRECISELY w
here he is you'll never find him.

343
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,000
Listen, I'll take you out of here.

344
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:32,708
Yeah.  Jet glider just a couple of
blocks down the street.

345
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:36,291
And all you gotta do is get me to him.

346
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:39,083
No kidding?  On the level?

347
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,583
Will you take me, too?

348
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:46,000
- We've got to deal somewhere else.
- No glider.

349
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:50,291
We've got the President.  And the Duke's
taking everybody out of here.

350
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,291
Never happen.

351
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:57,375
See, I know something
you and the Duke don't know.

352
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:00,958
.  We've
only got so long before Mr. President
don't mean a whole lot.

353
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:04,750
- You're lying.
- Maybe he's not ...

354
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:09,083
I know him!  Look at his face, he's lying!

355
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,541
Right, Harold.  I'm lying.

356
00:51:12,541 --> 00:51:17,250
So I might as well have some fun
and keep looking by myself.

357
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,041
Brain, he'll kill us both if you don't tell him --
Brain, you've got to tell him --

358
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:22,750
ALL RIGHT!!!

359
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,125
You always were smart, Harold.

360
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:31,250
Just one thing right now.

361
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,750
Don't call me "Harold."

362
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:41,416
So you work for this Duke, huh?

363
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:43,041
Yeah.

364
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:47,333
Make gas for him.
Figure out things for him.

365
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,333
Like what?

366
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:51,541
Like how to get across
the 69th street bridge --

367
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,000
it's mined, but I know
where they're planted.

368
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:57,708
We got a diagram from a guy
that got all the way across ...

369
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:00,000
... before they shot the poor bastard.

370
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,625
We got a crew up there now clearing
the way across the first barricade.

371
00:52:02,708 --> 00:52:04,625
What a sight, Snake!

372
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:09,291
The whole camp rolling right across
the bridge and the President right out front!

373
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:12,000
Oh, that would have been so fine ...

374
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,291
Yeah, it would have been ...

375
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:16,500
Yeah, but we're going with Snake now.

376
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:22,375
That's the Duke!  I know the
sound of his engines.

377
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,083
Don't cross the Duke

378
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:28,583
-- everybody knows that.

379
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,791
-- everybody knows that.

380
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:46,375
No, Brain!

381
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:57,291
- He's looking for you, Brain
- What does he want?

382
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,375
He wants my diagram of the bridge.

383
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,875
When he finds out I'm with you he's going to want
my life! I knew I shouldn't have listened to you --

384
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:05,375
We've got to get to the President NOW,
while he's busy.

385
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,791
Forget it, he's on the other side of town
and we got no wheels. The deal is off --

386
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,791
Just calm down.

387
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,916
I think they saw us!
Turn left, turn left here!

388
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:26,708
Brain. This is Broadway.

389
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:31,000
- I know, I know, the Duke'll take
Seventh Avenue, Broadway is 5 minutes. - No!

390
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:32,916
Yes!!! Just keep driving!

391
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,083
What's wrong with Broadway?

392
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,875
Come on sweetheart...

393
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:57,458
Maggie!

394
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:00,125
Hold on.

395
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:35,958
He'll be in the third car from
the end, by the last campfire.

396
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:48,166
It's all right. He's got to go in the front way.
It'll take him 5 minutes.

397
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,750
If you're not back to the car
in four minutes you're on your own.

398
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:54,250
When we get there,
Harold, you just keep talking.

399
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:30,416
Hi, guys.

400
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:41,208
Hi ... how's it going?
Cooled off a little, huh?

401
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,625
What do you want, Brain?

402
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:46,291
Duke told us to wait inside.
He's on his way here now.

403
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:48,291
He didn't say nothing to us about it.

404
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:51,791
Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody
in the joint, now can you? That's why he's the Duke.

405
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:55,083
Why don't we wait outside here for him?

406
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:57,375
Why don't we wait inside for him?

407
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,375
'Cause I got orders, that's why.

408
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,583
What are your specific orders, by the way?

409
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:07,375
Specific orders, Brain, was for
me not to let no one go inside.

410
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,500
How's the President holding up, by the way?

411
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,291
Any political discussion
you've had with him?

412
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,958
That Brain is a real pain in the ass.

413
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:21,083
He's always sniffing around like a dog.

414
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:23,083
He comes up with the gas.

415
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:30,250
What are you looking at?

416
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,333
Are you from the outside?

417
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,250
- Stop shaking.
- I can't! Who are you?

418
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:52,333
- Hauk sent me.  We've got to move fast
- Move fast?

419
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,541
- You're goddamned right I'll move fast.
- Quiet!

420
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:47,500
They got him.  Now watch him.

421
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:03,166
Friend of yours, Brain?

422
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:06,166
He had a gun on me, Duke,
there was nothing I could do.

423
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:33,833
Who are you?

424
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:44,708
I said who are you?

425
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:48,625
Snake Plissken, Duke.
he Man sent him in here.

426
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,625
Something's going down
... we need him.

427
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:07,708
Snaaaaaake Plissken.

428
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:14,208
I've heard of you.

429
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,583
I heard you were dead.

430
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:54,750
This is surveillance 4 to security control.

431
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,958
Nothing on the infrared body scan.

432
01:02:56,958 --> 01:03:01,166
There aren't any fires on the street.

433
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,833
Nobody moving down here.

434
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:06,125
Surveillance 5 ... security control ...

435
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:10,333
negative on infrared body
scan ... no movement in the searchlight ...

436
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:13,625
nothing strange going on down there.

437
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:25,625
- We've got to go in now.
- We hold.

438
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:28,708
- You're countermanding my orders, Hauk.
- This is my prison, I'll give the orders.

439
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,833
I override all that!

440
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,333
Just try.

441
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:40,625
...still negative on the scan.

442
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:43,708
This is Surveillance 4
to Security Control.

443
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:47,416
Nothing on the infrared
body scan.  Negative on the sweep.

444
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,208
Surveillance 10.
Still negative on the scan.

445
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:54,416
Surveillance 5 still negative.

446
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,291
This is Surveillance 4 to Security Control.
Nothing on the infrared body scan. Negative...

447
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,708
Don't move, Snake.

448
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,708
I want that diagram, Brain.

449
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:27,791
Oh. It's at my place, Duke.

450
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:32,416
Duke, that Plissken said
something about a time limit.

451
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
- What time limit
- On him.

452
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,583
That's a lot of crap.

453
01:05:36,708 --> 01:05:39,000
What did I teach you?

454
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:44,666
You... You are...
the Duke of New... New York...

455
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:46,791
You're... A-Number-One.

456
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,375
I can't hear you.

457
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:55,958
YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK...
YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE!

458
01:05:57,666 --> 01:06:00,375
Get me the diagram.

459
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:04,583
Duke... Don't kill Plissken.
We need him.

460
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:09,875
Get moving, Brain.

461
01:07:35,166 --> 01:07:38,291
People out below in the park.
Can you see them?

462
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:42,750
Surveillance 2 to Security Control.

463
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,083
We're getting that readout,
mostly in the infrared.

464
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:47,166
We have a visual sighting on it.

465
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:50,750
It's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park.

466
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:54,666
They're waving at us.
Signaling us in the food drop area.

467
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,666
They're waving us down.

468
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:47,125
I still can't figure out whether that son
of a bitch Plissken was telling the truth or not.

469
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:49,208
God, I hate that guy.

470
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,916
He got in somehow.

471
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,208
Yeah, yeah, but how?

472
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:59,791
You gotta land the glider and take off. You can't
do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.

473
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:02,208
Port Authority's too low to the ground.

474
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:06,166
Unless it was some......
Someplace high up.

475
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,291
World Trade Center.  That's it.

476
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:11,875
There we go. The
World Trade Center.

477
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,458
And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier
for me to take off than it was for him to land.

478
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:24,083
"Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City
in exchange for President.

479
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,666
69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.

480
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,666
No bullshit or he's dead."

481
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:31,750
- Where's the tape?
- Not here.

482
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,833
They're Plissken's.

483
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:40,541
So much for your man, Hauk?

484
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,250
Warm up the choppers.
We're moving in.

485
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,541
Plissken?

486
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:09,916
Come on, get up!

487
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:45,250
They sent in their best man.

488
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:48,166
And when we roll down the 69th
street bridge tomorrow

489
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:51,375
on our way to freedom,...

490
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:56,541
we're gonna have their best man
leading the way.  From the neck up.

491
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:12,125
On the hood of my car!

492
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:20,125
On the hood of my car!

493
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:03,708
Hello.
Where'd you get the hat?

494
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,875
- Got it from Cabbie.
- Yeah?

495
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,583
- Traded him.
- For what?

496
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:11,583
- What are you so nervous about?
- I'm here to see the President.

497
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:13,666
- Who says?
- The Duke.

498
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:17,166
- No he doesn't.
- Well... I'll have to
tell him you said that.

499
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,791
Wait a minute.  Why?

500
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:22,250
He's got something hidden
in his clothing.  The Duke wants it.

501
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,250
- What?
- I'll show you.

502
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:26,875
- You'll tell me.
- Cyanide capsules.

503
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:29,875
The Duke don't want a dead president.

504
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,750
Gentlemen.

505
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:36,041
Mr. President.

506
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,250
Cyanide?

507
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:54,416
Yeah. He might try to take it tomorrow.

508
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:56,250
That's bullshit.

509
01:14:58,041 --> 01:15:00,750
You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --

510
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:02,500
Snake! Snake!

511
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:14,916
"Tracer Status: ACTIVATED."

512
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,375
Tracer activated at one hour,
thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

513
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,875
Hauk!

514
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,875
LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!  LISTEN!!!

515
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,250
THE PRESIDENT'S GONE!

516
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:59,958
BRAIN TOOK HIM!

517
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:22,916
Hauk! Plissken's tracer!

518
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:28,833
Get on the radio!  Keep them down!
Nobody move!

519
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:33,333
He's approaching the World Trade Center.

520
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:35,916
I knew that son of a bitch was alive.

521
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,416
He's inside.

522
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,208
It's gone.

523
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,583
The signal only lasts for 15 minutes.

524
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:04,166
Download the choppers.
We're in a standby situation.

525
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:07,000
Anybody could have pushed that button.

526
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:10,083
Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch.

527
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:13,166
Now we'll give him a little more time,
just to make sure.

528
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,250
Goddamned redskins!

529
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:37,666
They're savages, Mr. President!

530
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:58,916
- Listen, I swear to god, I thought you were dead --
- Yeah, you and everybody else.

531
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:03,416
That's your car in the lobby?
The keys!  Quick!  Quick!

532
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,708
Diagram of the bridge!
Hey, hey, hey --

533
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:12,208
- I'm the only one who knows how to read that --
- Stay out of my way, Harold

534
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:14,916
Besides, you can't read and
drive at the same time.  You need us!

535
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,625
You shouldn't have double-crossed me again,
Brain. Come on, let's go --

536
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:21,791
- They sawed it off...
- The tape? - Gone... I don't know where...

537
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:23,416
I do.

538
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:30,708
Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is. Just
take us to the car and I'll take you right to it.

539
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,458
Don't talk.

540
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:54,083
Breathe.

541
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,458
Come on, come on, we're wasting time!

542
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:59,958
- What's wrong?
- Dead, Harold.
- What?!

543
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:03,250
Here, take these.

544
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:08,750
Car trouble?

545
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,750
Hi, Duke.

546
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,416
This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.

547
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:35,750
You and Brain just say good-bye
to each other.

548
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:09,500
GO, GO!

549
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:22,208
They're behind us --

550
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:27,083
- They come in groups of threes!
- Where's the tape, Brain?

551
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:30,583
- The tape from the briefcase!
- Oh, that tape! Here it is!

552
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:33,875
- You traded away your hat for it!
- How'd you know?

553
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:35,375
See, see!

554
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:47,666
- Here, give me that tape!
- Not just yet.

555
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:18,625
- Easy... easy!
- Go for it, Snake!

556
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:20,583
You've got to slow down a little, Snake...

557
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:23,750
- I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.
- You think?!

558
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:37,250
Stay left, stay left, stay left,
and then jog right when I tell you.

559
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,666
You're pushing her too hard, Snake.

560
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,166
OK, OK, NOW!

561
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:17,625
I said JOG RIGHT!...
you asshole.

562
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:35,500
Stay to the right, stay to
the right, now jog left.

563
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:39,083
Hold it, left...left...

564
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:40,875
LEFT, DAMMIT!

565
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:03,583
Keep moving...

566
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:20,250
Maggie... he's dead.

567
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:21,750
Come on.

568
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:35,166
Station 19!  They spotted two cars
on the 69th street bridge.

569
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:37,166
- Station 19!  They spotted two cars on the
69th street bridge. - Taxicab and a Cadillac.

570
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:39,166
Taxi hit a mine.
There's four people on foot.

571
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:42,250
- Fourteen minutes...
- Get a jeep with a winch over there fast.

572
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:46,875
Strombaerden!  Get over to Station 19.
They're coming across the bridge.

573
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:57,166
This is Rehme, Security Control.

574
01:27:57,166 --> 01:28:01,458
We are in a standby situation.
Repeat.  We are in a standby situation.

575
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:05,541
All helicopters, down.  Wall
guard, do not fire on prisoners.

576
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:08,958
Repeat, do not fire on prisoners.

577
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:11,250
All vehicles, stand by.

578
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,250
Repeat, all vehicles, stand by.

579
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:46,333
Yeah, hey, Number One!

580
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:49,333
You're the Duke!

581
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,833
You're the Duke!

582
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:58,250
You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.

583
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,375
The tape, Plissken.

584
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,291
That's it.

585
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,958
I radioed ahead, Mr. President.
They know the situation.

586
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:28,625
They're waiting for your broadcast.

587
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:36,416
Yeah. Oh, it's all right.

588
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:45,708
I, uh... I want to thank you.

589
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:50,416
Anything you want... you just name it.

590
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:53,833
Just a moment of your time.

591
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:55,500
Three minutes, sir.

592
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:59,125
Yes?

593
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:02,000
We did get you out.

594
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:05,791
A lot of people died in the process.
I just wondered how you felt about it.

595
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:07,291
Well, I...

596
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:11,083
I want to thank them.

597
01:32:11,208 --> 01:32:14,083
This nation appreciates their sacrifice.

598
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:25,375
Look, uh, I'm on the air in...
Two and a half minutes?

599
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:26,875
Yes, sir.

600
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:57,666
You going to kill me now, Snake?

601
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,833
I'm too tired.

602
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:03,041
Maybe later.

603
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:05,958
I've got another deal for you.

604
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:08,333
I've got another deal for you
while you're resting.

605
01:33:09,833 --> 01:33:12,333
I want to give you a job.

606
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:15,416
We'd make one hell of a team, Snake.

607
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:23,208
The name's Plissken.

608
01:33:32,416 --> 01:33:36,125
You're on camera, Mr. President.

609
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:37,625
Good evening.

610
01:33:38,916 --> 01:33:44,708
Although I shall not be present
at this historic summit meeting...

611
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,791
I present this...

612
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:51,208
in the hope...

613
01:33:51,291 --> 01:33:54,708
that our great nations ...

614
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:58,291
may learn to live in peace.
