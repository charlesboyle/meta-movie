00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:21,151

00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:25,215

174
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:26,426
Okay. So, What’s the good news.

175
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,713

Happy Birthday.

207
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,750
What happened to your face?

208
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,287
You look nice today.

209
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,746
My girls come over last night?

210
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:52,907
We played board games.

211
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,107
I bet, Y'all let her win too.

212
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,307
- Of course.

213
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,685
Yall hella weak for that.
She gets no easy wins with me around.

214
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:01,694
What?

215
00:23:01,894 --> 00:23:04,147
Do you remember that microwave popcorn
you bought a while back?

216
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:05,347
Hella good.

217
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:08,514
Yeah. While I was putting it into a bowl.

218
00:23:08,714 --> 00:23:11,652
Tatiana’s just standing there..
staring up at me;

219
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:13,901
Looking like she wants something.

220
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,434
Okay, what?
C'mon mom.

221
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:18,634
She says..

222
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,379
"Grandma, do we have any dark butter?"

223
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,100
What's Dark butter?

224
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,811
I'm thinking, maybe she watch
“Food Network” or something.

225
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,663
So I say, "what's dark butter sweetheart?"

226
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:36,419
She says, "When Daddy took me to see WALL.E
he asked for light butter,

227
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:39,209
so I want to try some dark butter this time."

228
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:40,409
She too smart.

229
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,430

230
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,860

233
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:58,247
Is there a problem here?

234
00:23:58,447 --> 00:23:59,447

237
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:17,776
Calm...down!

238
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:18,976
Oscar...

239
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,232
What happened to your face?

240
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:29,475
Dark butter.

241
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:36,157
She always listening?
Too damn smart for her own good.

242
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:39,206
The preschool said we should think about
starting her in school early.

243
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:40,406
Phina tell you that?

244
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:44,425
Yeah, we're gonna put her in private school.

245
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:48,842
Uniforms...

246
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:53,253
I was lookin at St. Bede the other day.
It’s this other school that starts them off learning Spanish,

247
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:56,357
and they back going on English -
- I'm not coming to see you anymore.

248
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:57,557
What?

249
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:03,550
I'm not coming here, to these visits anymore.
This is the last time.

250
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,118
I know I know I know. This is my last time too.
I told you that.

251
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,747
I ain't goin down no more.
- You want to keep putting Sophina through this...

252
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:11,357
you go on right ahead. Okay?

253
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:12,640
But Tatiana,

254
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,700
that baby doesn’t deserve this, Oscar.

255
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,955
She don't know what's going on.

256
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:21,911
So, I guess that’s why she asked me
why you love taking your vacations more than being with her.

257
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,111
She aint say that.

258
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:25,359
Oh, So I'm the liar now.

259
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:30,961
Ma you gotta tell her that I love her.

260
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,758
Tell her, i ain't gonna leave her.
- Tell her yourself!

261
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:37,547
The Next time you call home you tell her yourself.

262
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,645
Or better yet,
let her come visit you here.

263
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:49,125
She don't need to be exposed.
- You’ve already exposed--!

264
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,390
You’ve already exposed her to this.
- So, you gonna leave me?

265
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,660
You gonna leave me again,
What kinda mom is you?

266
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,510
You wanna fuck around and leave me in here?

267
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,100
You ain't never have my fuckin' back anyway.

268
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,450
I'm being here by myself.

269
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,214
I love you Oscar..

270
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:16,646
And, I’m praying for you.

271
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,730
I'll see you when you get home.

272
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,420
Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug, Ma.

273
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:27,035
- Grant.
- I can't get a hug?

274
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:33,386

275
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:34,586

Sold it to a white boy.
- For real..For how much?

282
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,857
Gave me a rack for it.
-  I was'nt gonna pay that high.

283
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:57,052
But, I still needed that though...
What’s the good?

Carrot cake.

293
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,480
Why you didn’t get ice cream?

294
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,320
Cause it aint your birthday.

295
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,442
You know it would be hella easier
if you just had your stuff at my spot right.

296
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,590
When you gonna move in.

297
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,450
Maybe, when you stop having trees
in the car before we pick up T.

298
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,519
Can you roll down the window, please?

299
00:30:32,828 --> 00:30:35,189
Hey T. T, come here.

00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,641

-They couldn’t catch me.

00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,970
You think you're fast huh?

303
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,770
Faster than daddy?

304
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,090

306
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:29,209
What are you doing?

307
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,915
Can watch T tonight?
We gonna go to Frisco.

308
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:08,985
Ask your sister.
- But Rose got hella kids to watch.

309
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:13,472
But what’s the difference between watching
six kids or watching seven kids?

310
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,093
<i>Quieres pasar la noche con sus primos?
- Si, si.</i>

311
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:34,020
Daddy, what's that on your shirt?

312
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:38,948
Daddy had an accident at work.

313
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:42,818
How’s work? By the way.

314
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:46,875
Work is...work.

315
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:57,416
I'll be back.

316
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:16,355
What you think?

317
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:20,418
It’s cool.

318
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:24,135
There a shirt on the bed for you,
if you want.

319
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:35,349
Are you alright?

320

I lost my job.

323
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,690
For what?

324
00:34:05,147 --> 00:34:06,673
Being late.

325
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,344
Missed a couple days
when I had to get some money.

326
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:13,139
They told you today?

327

329
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:23,106

I thought i could talk to Emi...
- You think life a fucking joke...

332
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,483
You think you’re gonna get fired and then

333
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:40,304

You lie to me,

You ain't even listening to me.

341
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:10,261
Not after you lie for two weeks get cornered,
and don’t have a choice.

342
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:11,461
That's some pussy act shit.

You threw a whole zip of weed.
And you don’t got a job.

Maybe if I can just not fuck up, for 30 days..

353
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:25,009

Sophina?
- The police, they got Oscar and them...

591
01:06:33,841 --> 01:06:37,313
I heard something I don't know
if it was a beanbag or a taser...

592
01:06:37,513 --> 01:06:40,894
Is Oscar there with you?
- Naw, he upstairs, with the Police.

593
01:06:44,089 --> 01:06:45,275
Did Oscar get arrested?

594
01:06:45,475 --> 01:06:47,765
I don't know, but I think so, wanda.

595
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,400
Okay, Imma call you back.

596
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,537
Who's that for?

597
01:06:53,737 --> 01:06:54,737
Who's that for?

598
01:06:58,293 --> 01:06:59,924
Why can't you tell me what's going on?

599
01:07:00,124 --> 01:07:02,275
What is the problem?
Tell me, what's going on?

600
01:07:02,475 --> 01:07:05,710
Jason! Jason!

601
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:07,798
What happened?
- They fucking shot him, Phina!

602
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:10,589
They shot him in the fucking back
for no reason man!

603
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,680
Where is Oscar?

604
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,880
Where is he?

605
01:07:18,746 --> 01:07:19,565
What is going on?

606
01:07:21,832 --> 01:07:24,231
Where is he?

607
01:07:31,759 --> 01:07:33,439
Oscar can you hear me?

608
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,860
Please...Please.
My boyfriend is...

609
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:57,260
My boyfriend is up there, okay.
You don't understand.

610
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,790
You need to let me up there.

611
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:08,754
Wanda. I'm trying to get up,
but they are not letting me up.

612
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:09,954
Oh my God!

613
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:11,154
Oh my God!

614
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:14,910
What did you do to him?
Did you fucking killed him?

615
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,920
What did you do to him?

616
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:28,900
I need to check he's okay.

617
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:33,000
Where are they taking him?

618
01:08:33,565 --> 01:08:35,996
Where are they taking him?
- He's going to Highland.

619
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,196
Get off me!

620
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,120
Wanda, They shot Oscar!

621
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:21,657
 They say he alive,
but his eyes was closed.

622
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,090
They takin him to Highland,
you gotta come and get us righ now.

623
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,290
I'm on my way.

624
01:09:27,498 --> 01:09:28,691
Fuck.

625
01:09:28,891 --> 01:09:29,891
What you got for me?
- 22 years old male,

626
01:09:30,091 --> 01:09:33,177
...scapula GSW.
He was lying face down when he was shot.

627
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:35,279
On three.
One..two...three.

628
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:36,479
What's blood pressure?
- 72 solid.

629
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:39,215
Was he moving his limbs?
- Yes, moving arms and legs.

630
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,020
I'm gonna need a chest tube.

631
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,402
We gotta get him upstairs, right away.

632
01:09:55,168 --> 01:09:56,041
Excuse me.

633
01:09:56,241 --> 01:09:59,107
My son is Oscar Julius Grant III.
He's been shot, and they told me to come here- 

634
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:00,240
- G-R-A..?
- -N-T. Yes.

635
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,462
Okay, he's in surgery. Go to the ICU
and someone will be out soon.

636
01:10:04,662 --> 01:10:05,662
And then, where?
- Right there.

637
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,210
Is that blood in?

638
01:10:14,852 --> 01:10:15,964
Scissors.

639
01:10:18,308 --> 01:10:19,509
Suction.

640
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:55,512
Hey, listen.
None of that.

641
01:10:55,712 --> 01:10:56,712
None of that.

642
01:10:56,912 --> 01:10:58,730
It's not the time or the place.

643
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,820
Hey, we gotta keep him positive.

644
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:16,269
We gotta.we gotta let these
people do their job.

645
01:11:16,469 --> 01:11:17,469
He's gonna be fine.

646
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:20,579
Let's put all our energy toward
Oscar right now.

647
01:11:20,779 --> 01:11:21,779
I know y'all are upset.

648
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:25,732
We gotta lift him up.
Let's keep him lifted up.

649
01:11:27,265 --> 01:11:28,793
Let's keep him lifted up.

650
01:11:40,616 --> 01:11:41,602
Mrs.Johnson?
- Yes.

651
01:11:43,556 --> 01:11:44,748
How is he?
How is he?

652
01:11:44,948 --> 01:11:47,254
Mrs.Johnson, as you know..

653
01:11:47,454 --> 01:11:48,454
Your son has been shot.

654
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:50,584
We've stabilized him,

655
01:11:50,784 --> 01:11:51,784
but he's critical.

656
01:11:54,082 --> 01:11:55,178
Critical. What is that?

657
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:59,016
Well, he has massive internal bleeding
and we had to remove the right lung.

658
01:11:59,216 --> 01:12:03,681
His lung? How is he...
How is he going to be able to breathe?

659
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,575
He's on a breathing machine, right now.

660
01:12:06,775 --> 01:12:07,775
His breathing is stable.

661
01:12:09,168 --> 01:12:11,360
The main problem is the internal bleeding.

662
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,995
We've had some difficulty
stopping the bleeding..

663
01:12:16,195 --> 01:12:17,195
that's getting his blood to clot.

664
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,067
He hasn't fully responded
to the transfusions, yet.

665
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:22,970
But he's going to make it right?

666
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,170
But he's going to make it.

667
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:26,598
I promise you, we're gonna do
everything we can okay?

668
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:36,539
Please do whatever you can, please.

669
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,523
We gotta lift him up, you all.

670
01:12:45,723 --> 01:12:48,140
We gotta lift Oscar up.

671
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:32,512
You all, let's pray.

672
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,360
<i>Heavenly father...</i>

673
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,939
<i>We kneel before you..
and ask you..</i>

674
01:13:48,139 --> 01:13:51,237
<i>to put your healing hands around your child.</i>

675
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:54,475
<i>We ask you dear Lord...</i>

676
01:13:54,675 --> 01:13:57,280
<i>to operate through these doctors;</i>

677
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:04,130
<i>Breathe strength into their hands Lord,
as they work on him.</i>

678
01:14:06,268 --> 01:14:08,812
<i>We are asking you right now,
to heal him.</i>

679
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:15,946
<i>Oh, Heal him lord,
so we can hold him and see his smile again.</i>

680
01:14:16,146 --> 01:14:20,123
<i>In your name, we pray. Amen.</i>

681
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,202
He didn't make it.

682
01:15:20,014 --> 01:15:22,039
I need to see him.

683
01:15:24,098 --> 01:15:25,392
Okay, you can see him.

684
01:15:25,592 --> 01:15:28,281
But they don't want you go into
the room and detach him.

685
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:30,493
Cos they ruled it a homicide.

686
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,028
I need to see him.

687
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:37,041
I need to see him.

688
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:38,241
I can take her.
- Okay.

689
01:16:21,221 --> 01:16:23,133
I told him to catch the train.

690
01:16:24,772 --> 01:16:27,371
I told him to catch BART!

691
01:16:27,571 --> 01:16:30,466
I didn't know they were gonna hurt him.

692
01:16:32,837 --> 01:16:34,682
I should have just let him drive.

693
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:38,262
I should have let him drive.
I wanted him to be safe.

694
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:45,561
You gotta let me hug him.

695
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:48,714
Please, let me hug him.
Please.

696
01:16:50,396 --> 01:16:52,987
He didn't like to be alone!!

697
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,636
Come on, T.

698
01:17:36,357 --> 01:17:37,789
Where’s Daddy?

01:19:56,814 --> 01:20:01,239
