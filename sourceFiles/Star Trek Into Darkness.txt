00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
[xxRaZoRxx]

2
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:36,199
Damn it, man! That was our ride!
You just stunned our ride!

3
00:01:38,234 --> 00:01:39,281
Oh, great.

4
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,561
Run!

5
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,279
What the hell did you take?

6
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:51,277
I have no idea,
but they were bowing to it.

7
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,274
Kirk to Shuttle One.

8
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:54,965
Locals are out of the kill zone.

9
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:56,320
You are clear. Repeat.

10
00:01:56,474 --> 00:02:00,160
Spock, get in there, neutralize the
volcano and let's get out of here.

11
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:09,202
We have to do this now!
I told the Captain

12
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:11,396
the shuttle wasn't built
for this kind of heat.

13
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,881
Captain, did the indigenous
life forms see you?

14
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:15,758
No, Mr. Spock, they did not.

15
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:17,081
The Prime Directive clearly states

16
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:18,395
there can be no interference

17
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,594
with the internal development
of alien civilizations.

18
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:22,159
I know what it says!
Which is why I'm running

19
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,754
through the jungle wearing a disguise!

20
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:28,397
Now drop off your
super ice cube and let's go! Kirk out!

21
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:29,800
You're good.

22
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:31,915
If we're gonna do this,
we've got to do it now!

23
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,358
This ash is killing our coils.

24
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:35,925
You sure you don't want me
to go instead?

25
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,076
That would be highly illogical
as I am already outfitted...

26
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:39,799
Spock, I was kidding.

27
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,884
- You got this.
- Guys! We have to go! Now!

28
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:55,236
They're trying to kill us!

29
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:57,724
They're trying to kill us, Jim!

30
00:02:58,274 --> 00:02:59,435
I'll see you in 90 seconds.

31
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:06,564
Do it, do it!

32
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:24,285
<i>Prerequisite change, 2-7-3...</i>

33
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,404
I can't hold this position.

34
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:30,965
Spock, I've got to pull you back up.

35
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:33,719
Negative. This is our only
chance to save this species.

36
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:35,558
If this volcano erupts, the planet dies.

37
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:40,396
Pull him back up. Now!

38
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,960
<i>Spock, are you okay?</i>

39
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:03,759
I am,

40
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:06,678
surprisingly, alive. Stand by.

41
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,882
We have to get him back.
I'll suit up. I'm gonna go down.

42
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,160
We have to abandon the shuttle.

43
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:12,163
- We can't just leave him, Sulu!
- We don't have a choice!

44
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:13,679
Uhura, I'm sorry.

45
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,765
<i>Spock, we're going back
to the Enterprise.</i>

46
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:16,915
<i>We'll get you out of there.</i>

47
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,678
Captain, I'm ditching the shuttle.

48
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:20,478
<i>You've got to make it
to the Enterprise on your own.</i>

49
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:21,885
<i>Wonderful!</i>

50
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:24,474
- Uhura! You ready to swim?
- I'm ready.

51
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:27,715
Jim!

52
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,558
Jim! The beach is that way!

53
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,359
I know! We're not going to the beach!

54
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:35,318
Oh, no, no, no!

55
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:41,238
I hate this!

56
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,515
I know you do!

57
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:27,363
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous it is

58
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,879
to hide a star-ship
on the bottom of the ocean?

59
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,365
We've been down here since last night!

60
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,795
The salt water's gonna ruin the...

61
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,757
Scotty! Where's Spock?

62
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:34,914
Still in the volcano, sir.

63
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:18,277
Captain on the bridge!

64
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:21,034
Lieutenant, do we have
an open channel to Mr. Spock?

65
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,401
The heat's frying his comms,
but we still have contact.

66
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:26,720
Spock?

67
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,956
I have activated the device, Captain.

68
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,081
When the countdown is complete,

69
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:31,639
the reaction should
render the volcano inert.

70
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,114
Yeah, and that's gonna render him inert!

71
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:34,480
Do we have use of the transporters?

72
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,238
- Negative, sir.
- Not with these magnetic fields.

73
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,884
I need to beam Spock back to the ship.

74
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:39,564
Give me one way to do it.

75
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:41,876
Maybe if we had a direct line of sight.

76
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:43,041
- If we got closer...
- Hold on, wee man!

77
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,755
You're talking about an active volcano!

78
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:46,364
Sir, if that thing erupts,

79
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,194
I cannot guarantee
we can withstand the heat!

80
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,322
I don't know that we can
maintain that kind of altitude.

81
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:51,919
Our shuttle was concealed
by the ash cloud,

82
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,325
<i>but the Enterprise is too large.</i>

83
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:55,437
If utilized in a rescue effort,

84
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:57,124
<i>it would be revealed
to the indigenous species.</i>

85
00:06:57,314 --> 00:06:59,115
Spock, nobody knows
the rules better than you,

86
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:00,997
but there has got to be an exception.

87
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,395
None. Such action violates
the Prime Directive.

88
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:05,514
Shut up, Spock! We're trying
to save you, damn it!

89
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:08,325
Doctor, the needs of
the many outweigh the needs of the few.

90
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:10,522
Spock, we're talking about your life!

91
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:11,795
<i>The rule cannot be broken...</i>

92
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,280
Spock!

93
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:15,675
Try to get him back online.

94
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,755
Ninety seconds to detonations.

95
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:23,436
If Spock were here
and I were there, what would he do?

96
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:28,118
He'd let you die.

97
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:11,319
Spock!

98
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:13,319
You all right?

99
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,314
Captain, you let them see our ship.

100
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:16,885
He's fine.

101
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:18,956
<i>- Bridge to Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Lieutenant.</i>

102
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:21,202
Is Commander Spock on board, sir?

103
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:22,275
<i>Safely and soundly.</i>

104
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:24,115
Please notify him that his device

105
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,645
<i>has successfully detonated.</i>

106
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,762
<i>You hear that?
Congratulations, Spock.</i>

107
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,159
You just saved the world.

108
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,163
You violated the Prime Directive.

109
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:35,840
Oh, come on, Spock.
They saw us. Big deal.

110
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,878
I can save her.

111
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,684
What did you say?

112
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:23,404
Your daughter.

113
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:26,357
I can save her.

114
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,845
Who are you?

115
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:49,800
Oh, Jim. Come on, let it go.

116
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:51,840
Jim!

117
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:54,804
You're not actually gonna
answer that, are you?

118
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,158
Spock, I'm telling you,
this is why he called. I can feel it.

119
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,801
Your feeling aside,
I consider it highly unlikely

120
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:04,036
that we will be selected
for the new program.

121
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,436
Why else would Pike want to see us?

122
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:07,920
Forget about seniority.

123
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:09,359
They gave us the newest ship
in the fleet.

124
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:10,640
I mean, who else
are they gonna send out?

125
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:11,715
I can think of numerous possibilities.

126
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:13,996
A five-year mission, Spock!

127
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:16,476
That's deep space!
That's uncharted territory!

128
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:17,555
Think how incredible that's gonna be.

129
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:20,201
Hey, ladies. Jim Kirk.

130
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,322
- "Uneventful."
- Admiral?

131
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:26,155
It's the way you described the survey of
Nibiru in your captain's log.

132
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:28,322
Yes, sir, I didn't want to waste your time
going over the details.

133
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:30,317
Tell me more about this volcano.

134
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,759
Data says it was highly volatile.

135
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,399
If it were to erupt,
it would wipe out the planet.

136
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:34,760
Let's hope it doesn't, sir.

137
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,120
Something tells me it won't.

138
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:39,162
Well, sir, volatile is all relative.

139
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,918
Maybe our data was off.

140
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,281
Or maybe it didn't erupt

141
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:44,965
because Mr. Spock detonated
a cold fusion device

142
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:47,321
inside it right after a civilization

143
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,556
that's barely invented the wheel

144
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:52,644
happened to see a star-ship
rising out of their ocean!

145
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:54,876
That is pretty much how
you describe it, is it not?

146
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:56,724
- Admiral...
- You filed a report?

147
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,875
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:00,754
I incorrectly assumed that you would be
truthful in your captain's log.

149
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:02,956
Yeah, I would have been
if I didn't have to save your life.

150
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:04,200
A fact for which I am
immeasurably grateful

151
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:05,875
and the very reason I felt it necessary

152
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,075
to take responsibility for the actions...

153
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:08,679
Take responsibility, yeah.

154
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:09,835
That'd be so noble, pointy,

155
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:11,364
if you weren't also
throwing me under the bus.

156
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,436
"Pointy"? Is that
a derogatory reference to...

157
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:14,755
Gentlemen.

158
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:19,085
Starfleet's mandate is to explore and
observe, not to interfere.

159
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,043
Had the mission gone
according to plan, Admiral,

160
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:22,275
the indigenous species would never

161
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,441
have been aware of our interference.

162
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:24,874
That's a technicality.

163
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:26,797
I am Vulcan, sir.
We embrace technicality.

164
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,478
Are you giving me attitude, Spock?

165
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:30,438
I'm expressing
multiple attitudes simultaneously, sir.

166
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:31,754
To which are you referring?

167
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:32,961
Out.

168
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,638
You're dismissed, Commander.

169
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:47,243
You have any idea what
a pain in the ass you are?

170
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:49,240
I think so, sir.

171
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:50,555
So tell me what you did wrong.

172
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:52,557
What's the lesson to be learned here?

173
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:54,160
Never trust a Vulcan.

174
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,714
Now, see, you can't
even answer the question. You lied.

175
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,717
On an official report, you lied.

176
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,239
You think the rules don't apply to you

177
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:01,520
'cause you disagree with them.

178
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,483
That's why you talked me
into signing up in the first place.

179
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,794
It's why you gave me your ship.

180
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:08,043
I gave you my ship because
I saw a greatness in you.

181
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:11,560
And now, I see you haven't
got an ounce of humility.

182
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:12,914
What was I supposed to do,
let Spock die?

183
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,155
You're missing the point.

184
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:15,804
I don't think I am, sir.
What would you have done?

185
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:17,763
I wouldn't have risked
my First Officer's life

186
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,120
in the first place!

187
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:21,083
You were supposed to survey a planet,

188
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,997
not alter its destiny!

189
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:25,162
You violated a dozen
Starfleet regulations

190
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:27,476
and almost got everyone
under your command killed.

191
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:29,005
Except I didn't!

192
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:30,439
You know how many
crew members I've lost? Not one!

193
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,516
That's your problem,
you think you're infallible!

194
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:33,755
You think you can't make a mistake.

195
00:15:33,954 --> 00:15:35,115
It's a pattern with you!

196
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:37,435
- The rules are for other people!
- Some should be.

197
00:15:37,514 --> 00:15:39,198
And what's worse is you using blind luck

198
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,442
to justify your playing God!

199
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,845
Given the circumstances,

200
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:47,882
this has been brought to
Admiral Marcus's attention.

201
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:50,719
He convened a special tribunal,
to which I was not invited.

202
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,519
You understand what Starfleet
regulations mandate

203
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:54,721
be done at this point.

204
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:00,842
They've taken the Enterprise
away from you.

205
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,042
They're sending you
back to the Academy.

206
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:10,195
Admiral, listen...

207
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:11,315
- No, I'm not going to listen.
- I can justify...

208
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:12,395
Why should I listen?
I'm not going to listen.

209
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,800
You don't listen to anybody but yourself!

210
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,638
I understand regulation,
but every decision I've made...

211
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:16,715
No! I can't listen!

212
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:18,558
You don't comply with the rules,

213
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:20,716
you don't take responsibility
for anything,

214
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,882
and you don't respect the chair.

215
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:26,404
You know why?

216
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,397
Because you're not ready for it.

217
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:41,162
I'm going to need three titanium...

218
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:44,204
<i>Radiation protection
is required in this area.</i>

219
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:52,715
How did you find me?

220
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:54,956
I know you better than you think I do.

221
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:59,955
The first time I found you
was in a dive like this.

222
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,918
Remember that? You got
your ass handed to you.

223
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:05,235
No, I didn't.

224
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:07,203
- You don't?
- No, that's not what happened.

225
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,720
- That was an epic beating.
- No, it wasn't.

226
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:11,796
You had napkins
hanging out of your nose.

227
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:13,959
Did you not?

228
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:17,956
Yeah, that was a good fight.

229
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,518
"A good fight."

230
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:25,755
I think that's your problem right there.

231
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,437
They gave her back to me.

232
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,605
<i>The Enterprise.</i>

233
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:47,315
Congratulations.

234
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:52,675
Watch your back with
that First Officer, though.

235
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:55,685
Spock's not going
to be working with me.

236
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,404
He's been transferred.

237
00:20:58,274 --> 00:20:59,958
<i>U.S.S. Bradbury.</i>

238
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:04,356
You're going to be my First Officer.

239
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:07,515
Yeah, Marcus took some convincing.

240
00:21:09,154 --> 00:21:12,203
But every now and then
I can make a good case.

241
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,999
What did you tell him?

242
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:18,755
The truth.

243
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:21,278
That I believe in you.

244
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:26,356
That if anybody
deserves a second chance, it's Jim Kirk.

245
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:37,718
I don't know what to say.

246
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:40,205
That is a first.

247
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,878
It's going to be okay, son.

248
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,078
"Emergency session, Daystrom."

249
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:55,880
That's us.

250
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:57,520
Yeah.

251
00:21:58,474 --> 00:21:59,805
Suit up.

252
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:14,279
<i>All Starfleet personnel,
please be advised,</i>

253
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:17,284
<i>- new security protocols are in effect.
- Captain.</i>

254
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:19,476
Not anymore, Spock. First Officer.

255
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:23,241
I was demoted
and you were reassigned.

256
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,084
It is fortunate that the consequences

257
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,275
were not more severe.

258
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:27,680
You've got to be kidding me.

259
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:28,835
Captain, it was never my intention...

260
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,075
Not Captain.

261
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,515
I saved your life, Spock.

262
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:33,961
You wrote a report, I lost my ship.

263
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:38,524
Commander, I see now
I should have alerted you

264
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:40,278
to the fact that I submitted the report.

265
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:42,197
No, I'm familiar with your compulsion

266
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:45,005
to follow the rules.
But you see, I can't do that.

267
00:22:45,594 --> 00:22:47,722
Where I come from,
if someone saves your life,

268
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:49,034
you don't stab him in the back.

269
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:50,798
Vulcans cannot lie.

270
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,524
Then I'm talking
to the half-human part of you.

271
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:54,204
All right?

272
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:56,755
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

273
00:22:56,954 --> 00:23:00,276
Commander Spock?
Frank Abbot, U. S. S. Bradbury.

274
00:23:00,474 --> 00:23:01,805
Guess you're with me.

275
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:04,965
Yes, Captain.

276
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,284
The truth is

277
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:17,679
I'm going to miss you.

278
00:23:25,914 --> 00:23:28,315
<i>Admiral Marcus, sir.</i>

279
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,483
Thank you for convening
on such short notice.

280
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:33,840
Be seated.

281
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:38,765
By now, some of you
have heard what happened in London.

282
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:41,201
The target was a Starfleet data archive.

283
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:42,475
Now it's a damned hole in the ground,

284
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,363
42 men and women are dead.

285
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:45,595
One hour ago,

286
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,475
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

287
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,403
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

288
00:23:49,874 --> 00:23:52,195
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

289
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:55,204
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

290
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:58,358
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

291
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,118
For reasons unknown,
John Harrison has just declared

292
00:24:01,194 --> 00:24:03,640
a one-man war against Starfleet.

293
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,516
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

294
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:09,198
to escape Federation space.

295
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:11,604
You here tonight represent
the senior command

296
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:13,443
of all the vessels in the region.

297
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:16,161
And in the name of those we lost,

298
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,555
you will run this bastard down.

299
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:22,875
This is a manhunt,
pure and simple, so let's get to work.

300
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:25,277
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

301
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,964
any warp signatures leaving the system,

302
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,399
so we know he can't be far.

303
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:31,716
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

304
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:34,281
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

305
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:37,164
to run down every lead.

306
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:39,004
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

307
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,640
so the rules of engagement are simple.

308
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,763
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

309
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:46,643
or the lives of those nearby,

310
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:49,797
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

311
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:51,564
- What's in the bag?
- James, not now.

312
00:24:51,754 --> 00:24:53,836
It doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

313
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:55,404
It's like bombing a library.

314
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,198
Chris? Everything okay there?

315
00:24:57,594 --> 00:25:00,200
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk is just acclimating

316
00:25:00,274 --> 00:25:02,083
to his new position as First Officer.

317
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,838
You got something to say, Kirk, say it.

318
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:05,564
Tomorrow's too late.

319
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:08,755
I'm fine, sir. My apologies.

320
00:25:09,314 --> 00:25:11,715
Spit it out, son. Don't be shy.

321
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:14,956
Why the archive?

322
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,761
All that information is public record.

323
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:19,876
If he really wanted to damage Starfleet,

324
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:23,684
this could just be the beginning.

325
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:25,324
The beginning of what, Mr. Kirk?

326
00:25:25,514 --> 00:25:28,245
Sir, in the event
of an attack, protocol mandates

327
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:31,204
that senior command gather
captains and first officers

328
00:25:31,274 --> 00:25:33,322
at Starfleet H.Q., right here

329
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,757
- in this room.
- It is curious Harrison

330
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:39,195
would commandeer a jump-ship
without warp capabilities...

331
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:46,115
Clear the room!

332
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:52,515
No!

333
00:25:54,474 --> 00:25:57,318
We need an air defense team!
Daystrom Conference Room!

334
00:25:58,994 --> 00:26:00,519
- Let's go!
- Cover me!

335
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:10,684
- Target acquired.
- Take him out!

336
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:11,841
Watch my flank!

337
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:15,635
- Go, go, go!
- Cover me!

338
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:00,595
Fire!

339
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,835
Yeah?

340
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,440
<i>Commander,
Mr. Scott has found something</i>

341
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:28,397
<i>in the wreckage of Harrison's ship.</i>

342
00:30:28,754 --> 00:30:31,075
<i>He has asked to see us right away.</i>

343
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,878
Captain!
I found this in the crashed jump-ship, sir.

344
00:30:35,954 --> 00:30:37,763
- This is how the bastard got away.
- What do you mean?

345
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,962
It's a portable
transwarp beaming device.

346
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:41,274
Well, can you figure out where he went?

347
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:44,318
I already did, sir.
And you're no gonna like it.

348
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,278
He's gone to the one place we...

349
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:49,637
We just can't go.

350
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:54,123
Admiral, sir, he's not on Earth.

351
00:30:56,074 --> 00:30:58,520
He's on Kronos, sir.

352
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:00,198
I request my command be reinstated

353
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:02,163
and your permission to go after him.

354
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:04,840
Give us a minute.

355
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:07,395
- Kronos.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:10,000
So Harrison's gone
to the Klingon homeworld.

357
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:11,764
- Is he defecting?
- We're not sure, sir.

358
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,245
He has taken refuge
in the Ketha Province,

359
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:14,315
a region uninhabited for decades.

360
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:15,924
He's gotta be hiding there, sir!

361
00:31:15,994 --> 00:31:17,723
He knows if we even
go near Klingon space,

362
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:18,795
it'd be all-out war.

363
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:21,155
Starfleet can't go after him, but I can.

364
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,479
Please, sir.

365
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,285
All-out war with
the Klingons is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

366
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:29,719
If you ask me, it's already begun.

367
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,399
Since we first learned of their existence,

368
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,602
the Klingon Empire
has conquered and occupied

369
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:34,835
two planets that we know of

370
00:31:34,954 --> 00:31:37,480
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

371
00:31:39,594 --> 00:31:41,164
They are coming our way.

372
00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:45,156
London was not an archive.

373
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:47,158
It was a top-secret branch of Starfleet

374
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,800
designated Section 31.

375
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:51,405
They were developing
defense technology

376
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,397
and training our officers
to gather intelligence

377
00:31:53,514 --> 00:31:54,959
on the Klingons
and any other potential enemy

378
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,321
who means to do us harm.

379
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:58,845
Harrison was one of our top agents.

380
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:01,281
Well, now he's a fugitive
and I want to take him out.

381
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:05,845
Pike always said you were
one of our best and brightest.

382
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:08,681
You should have heard him defend you.

383
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,034
He's the one who talked you
into joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

384
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:14,160
Yes, sir.

385
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:16,881
Did he ever tell you
who talked him into joining?

386
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:23,156
His death is on me.

387
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:25,795
And yours can't be.

388
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:26,955
Sir, please. All I...

389
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:28,524
Mr. Spock, you said the province

390
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,085
where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?

391
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:31,799
Affirmative, sir.

392
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:36,683
As part of our defensive strategy,

393
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,041
31 developed a new photon torpedo.

394
00:32:41,674 --> 00:32:43,085
Long-range and untraceable,

395
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,322
it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.

396
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:48,558
I don't want you hurt,
but I want to take him out.

397
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:50,517
You park on the edge
of the Neutral Zone,

398
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,483
you lock onto Harrison's position,

399
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,155
you fire, you kill him and you haul ass.

400
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,837
Permission to
reinstate Mr. Spock as my First Officer.

401
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:01,515
Granted.

402
00:33:09,194 --> 00:33:10,241
Jim!

403
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:13,203
- Where were you?
- For what?

404
00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:14,884
Your medical exam.

405
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:16,922
Ten hours ago, you were
in a damn firefight.

406
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:19,241
- Now it's my duty as ship's...
- I'm fine, Bones.

407
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:20,925
The hell you are.

408
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,399
I'm fine.

409
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:32,155
Status report, Mr. Spock.

410
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:33,605
The Enterprise should be
ready for launch

411
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:35,079
by the time we arrive.

412
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:37,482
- Good. Good.
- Captain.

413
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:40,797
Thank you for requesting
my reinstatement.

414
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:43,765
You're welcome.

415
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:46,762
As I am again
your First Officer, it is now my duty

416
00:33:46,954 --> 00:33:48,714
to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

417
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:49,995
Of course it is.

418
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:51,525
There is no Starfleet regulation

419
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,274
that condemns a man
to die without a trial,

420
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:56,005
something you
and Admiral Marcus are forgetting.

421
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:58,355
Also, preemptively firing torpedoes

422
00:33:58,434 --> 00:33:59,995
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

423
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:01,803
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

424
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,274
There's only gonna be one casualty.

425
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:04,515
And in case you weren't listening,

426
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:06,835
our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

427
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,439
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

428
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:11,643
Regulations aside,
this action is morally wrong.

429
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:14,405
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

430
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:15,555
And I didn't win any points for that.

431
00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:16,715
Whoa, Jim, calm down.

432
00:34:16,794 --> 00:34:18,239
I'm not gonna take
ethics lessons from a robot!

433
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:20,044
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

434
00:34:20,154 --> 00:34:21,485
and therefore find my opinion valid.

435
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:22,875
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

436
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:25,077
Bones, get that thing off my face.

437
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:27,839
Captain, our mission
could start a war with the Klingons

438
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:30,036
and it is, by its very definition, immoral.

439
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:31,754
Perhaps you should
take the requisite time

440
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:34,121
to arrive at this conclusion for yourself.

441
00:34:34,194 --> 00:34:35,355
Captain Kirk.

442
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,165
Science Officer Wallace.

443
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:40,481
I've been assigned
to the Enterprise by Admiral Marcus.

444
00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:42,484
These are my transfer orders.

445
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:45,356
You requested an additional
science officer, Captain?

446
00:34:45,514 --> 00:34:46,595
I wish I had.

447
00:34:48,314 --> 00:34:50,476
"Lieutenant Carol Wallace."

448
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:51,920
"Doctorate in applied physics

449
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:54,924
"specializing in advanced weaponry."

450
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:56,041
Impressive credentials.

451
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:57,515
Thank you.

452
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:59,079
But redundant now that
I am back aboard the Enterprise.

453
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:00,639
And yet, the more the merrier.

454
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:02,796
- Have a seat, Doctor.
- Thank you.

455
00:35:05,674 --> 00:35:08,405
Shuttle crew, stand by for lift-off.

456
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:31,524
No! I'm not signing anything!

457
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:33,801
Now, get these bloody things
off my ship! Captain!

458
00:35:33,874 --> 00:35:35,074
Is there a problem, Mr. Scott?

459
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:37,077
Aye, sir. I was just
explaining to this gentleman

460
00:35:37,274 --> 00:35:39,720
that I cannot authorize any
weapons on board this ship

461
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:40,920
without knowing what's inside them.

462
00:35:40,994 --> 00:35:42,803
Mr. Scott raises yet another point...

463
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,000
Report to the bridge.

464
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:45,355
Captain.

465
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:47,403
Mr. Scott, I understand your concerns,

466
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:49,363
but we need these torpedoes on board.

467
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:52,034
Due respect, sir,
but photon torpedoes run on fuel.

468
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:53,684
Now, I cannot detect the type of fuel

469
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:55,563
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

470
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:56,675
because it's shielded.

471
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:59,115
Now, I asked for
the specifications, but he said...

472
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:01,237
- it's classified.
- It's classified.

473
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:03,396
So I said, "No specs, no signature!"

474
00:36:03,474 --> 00:36:04,475
Captain.

475
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:06,883
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

476
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:08,883
- Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

477
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:11,998
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

478
00:36:12,594 --> 00:36:13,755
Get down!

479
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,444
Jim, your vitals are way off.

480
00:36:15,514 --> 00:36:17,835
Report to the med bay. Scotty!

481
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,518
I need you to approve those weapons.

482
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,595
Do you know what this is, Captain?

483
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:22,085
I don't have time for a lecture, Scotty.

484
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:25,004
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a warp core.

485
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:28,118
It's a radioactive
catastrophe waiting to happen.

486
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,163
A subtle shift in magnetic output

487
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:33,118
from, say, firing
one or more of six dozen torpedoes

488
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,639
with an unknown payload

489
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:36,205
could set off a chain reaction
which would kill

490
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:37,958
every living thing on this ship.

491
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:40,560
Letting those torpedoes on board the
Enterprise is the last straw!

492
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:42,483
- What was the first straw?
- What was the...

493
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,398
There are plenty of straws.

494
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:47,125
How about Starfleet
confiscating my transwarp equation?

495
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:49,435
And now some madman's
using it to hop across the galaxy!

496
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:50,635
Where do you think he got it from?

497
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:52,045
We have our orders, Scotty!

498
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:53,963
That's what scares me.

499
00:36:54,354 --> 00:36:56,721
This is clearly a military operation.

500
00:36:57,034 --> 00:36:58,604
Is that what we are now?

501
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,074
'Cause I thought we were explorers.

502
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:03,165
Sign for the torpedoes, that's an order.

503
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,158
Right, well, you leave me no choice

504
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:07,520
but to resign my duties.

505
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:09,164
Come on, Scotty.

506
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:10,839
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

507
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:12,081
You're not giving me much of a choice.

508
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:13,440
Will you just
make an exception and sign...

509
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:14,954
Do you accept my resignation or not?

510
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:16,200
Idol

511
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:23,839
I do.

512
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,036
You are relieved, Mr. Scott.

513
00:37:37,874 --> 00:37:43,517
Jim, for the love of God,
do not use those torpedoes.

514
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:59,159
<i>Attention. Warp core
anti-matter containment check</i>

515
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:00,685
<i>in three minutes.</i>

516
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:07,040
<i>Captain! I'm so sorry
about Admiral Pike.</i>

517
00:38:07,394 --> 00:38:08,759
We all are.

518
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,243
- Are you okay?
- Fine, thank you, Lieutenant.

519
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:21,404
Actually, Scotty just quit.

520
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:26,443
And your boyfriend's second-guessing
me every chance he gets.

521
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,204
I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.

522
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:34,915
It's just sometimes
I want to rip the bangs off his head.

523
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,283
- You know, maybe it's me. I...
- It's not you.

524
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:41,075
It's not?

525
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:45,876
Wait, are you guys...
Are you guys fighting?

526
00:38:45,954 --> 00:38:46,955
I'd rather not talk about it, sir.

527
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,122
Oh, my God! What is that even like?

528
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:55,994
Your ears burning?

529
00:38:56,074 --> 00:38:57,155
Captain on the bridge!

530
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,040
Captain.

531
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,758
Mr. Chekov. You've been
shadowing Mr. Scott.

532
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,155
You are familiar with
the engineering systems of this ship?

533
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:06,275
Affirmative, sir.

534
00:39:06,434 --> 00:39:07,435
Good.

535
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:11,197
You're my new Chief.
Go put on a red shirt.

536
00:39:14,754 --> 00:39:16,279
Aye, Captain.

537
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:21,924
Retract all moorings, Mr. Sulu.

538
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:24,194
Yes, sir.

539
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:31,000
<i>Docking clamps one, two,
and three are released.</i>

540
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:32,075
<i>All moorings retracted.</i>

541
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,554
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a shipwide channel.

542
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:45,635
Yes, sir.

543
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:48,004
<i>Mr. Chekov,
how we looking down there?</i>

544
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:50,561
- All systems nominal, Captain.
- Copy that.

545
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:52,159
Warp available at your command.

546
00:39:52,234 --> 00:39:53,804
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chekov.</i>

547
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:56,478
- All right. Let's ride.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:11,279
Channel open, sir.

549
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:14,561
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

550
00:40:14,794 --> 00:40:16,876
As most of you know, Christopher Pike,

551
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:19,878
former captain of this ship
and our friend,

552
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:22,999
is dead.

553
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:25,678
The man who killed him
has fled our system

554
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,523
and is hiding on the Klingon homeworld,

555
00:40:27,714 --> 00:40:30,240
<i>somewhere he believes
we are unwilling to go.</i>

556
00:40:31,674 --> 00:40:34,245
<i>We are on our way there now.</i>

557
00:40:34,354 --> 00:40:38,245
<i>Per Admiral Marcus, it is essential
that our presence go undetected.</i>

558
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:39,924
<i>Tensions between the Federation</i>

559
00:40:40,034 --> 00:40:41,718
<i>and the Klingon Empire have been high.</i>

560
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,155
<i>Any provocation could lead
to an all-out war.</i>

561
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,882
I will personally lead a landing party

562
00:40:59,954 --> 00:41:02,605
to an abandoned city
on the surface of Kronos

563
00:41:03,354 --> 00:41:06,597
where we will capture
the fugitive, John Harrison,

564
00:41:06,794 --> 00:41:10,765
and return him to Earth
so he can face judgment for his actions.

565
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:16,959
All right. Let's go
get this son of a bitch. Kirk out.

566
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,760
Captain, I believe you have
made the right decision.

567
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:25,874
If I can be of assistance,

568
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:28,074
I would be happy to accompany
you on the away team.

569
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,722
You? Happy?

570
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:34,565
I was simply attempting to use your
vernacular to convey an idea.

571
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:38,438
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

572
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:51,204
<i>All personnel, prepare for the
closing of payload bay doors.</i>

573
00:41:58,954 --> 00:42:01,116
Mr. Spock. You startled me.

574
00:42:02,114 --> 00:42:03,604
What are you doing, Doctor?

575
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,597
- Verifying that the torpedo's internal...
- You misunderstand.

576
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:07,756
What are you doing aboard this ship?

577
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:10,678
There is no record
of you being assigned to the Enterprise.

578
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:12,205
Really? That must be
some sort of mistake.

579
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:14,595
My conclusion as well, Dr. Marcus.

580
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:18,165
Except that you have lied
about your identity.

581
00:42:18,354 --> 00:42:20,755
Wallace is the surname of your mother.

582
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:23,075
I can only assume
the Admiral is your father.

583
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:27,805
Mr. Spock.

584
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:30,880
I'm aware that I have
no right to ask this of you.

585
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:34,123
But please, he cannot
know that I'm here...

586
00:42:41,874 --> 00:42:44,081
Engineering manually
dropped us out of warp, sir.

587
00:42:44,154 --> 00:42:45,883
Mr. Chekov, did you break my ship?

588
00:42:45,994 --> 00:42:47,598
Sorry, sir. I don't know what happened!

589
00:42:47,674 --> 00:42:48,800
The core overheated.

590
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:50,564
I had to activate the emergency stop.

591
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,284
It must be a coolant leak.
I need time to find it.

592
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:54,596
- Sony, Captain.
- Damn it.

593
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:57,156
Mr. Sulu, time to our destination.

594
00:42:57,394 --> 00:42:58,555
Twenty minutes, sir.

595
00:42:58,674 --> 00:43:00,802
That's 20 minutes
in enemy space we weren't counting on.

596
00:43:00,874 --> 00:43:02,524
All right. We better hop to it.

597
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:04,119
- Where's Spock?
- Here, Captain.

598
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:06,163
You're coming with me to Kronos.

599
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:07,235
Lieutenant, how's your Klingon?

600
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:09,595
- It's rusty, but it's good.
- Good, you're coming, too.

601
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:13,115
This isn't going to be a problem, is it,
you two working together?

602
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:14,844
Absolutely not.

603
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,555
Unclear.

604
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:20,795
I'll meet you in the shuttle bay.

605
00:43:21,754 --> 00:43:24,200
Jim, you're not actually
going down there, are you?

606
00:43:24,274 --> 00:43:27,835
You don't rob a bank
when the getaway car has a flat tire.

607
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,564
I'm sure engineering
will have us all patched up

608
00:43:30,634 --> 00:43:31,681
by the time we get back.

609
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:33,836
<i>Isn't that right, Mr. Chekov?</i>

610
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:34,915
Yes, Captain.

611
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:36,400
<i>I'll do my best, sir.</i>

612
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:39,805
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

613
00:43:40,874 --> 00:43:42,554
Once we're en route,
I want you to transmit

614
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:44,875
a targeted comm burst
to Harrison's location.

615
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:47,525
You tell him you have a bunch
of real big torpedoes pointed at his head

616
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:50,359
and if he doesn't play nice,
you're not afraid to use them.

617
00:43:50,554 --> 00:43:52,283
- Is that a problem?
- No, sir.

618
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:54,204
I've just never sat in the chair before.

619
00:43:55,554 --> 00:43:57,044
You're gonna do great.

620
00:43:58,714 --> 00:44:00,239
Jim! Wait!

621
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:02,834
You just sat that man down
at a high-stakes poker game

622
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:05,042
with no cards and told him to bluff.

623
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:07,555
Now Sulu's a good man,
but he is no captain.

624
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:08,840
For the next two hours, he is.

625
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:10,962
And enough with the metaphors, all
right? That's an order.

626
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:13,560
Mr. Sulu, make sure
that K'normian ship is ready to fly.

627
00:44:23,354 --> 00:44:25,641
Acting Captain Sulu to Shuttle Bay 2.

628
00:44:25,714 --> 00:44:27,557
<i>Please have the trade ship
we confiscated</i>

629
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:30,160
<i>during the Mudd incident last month
fueled and flight ready.</i>

630
00:44:30,394 --> 00:44:32,442
<i>Captain Kirk is en route to you now.</i>

631
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:37,478
Ready to deploy, Captain.

632
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,278
Lieutenants, lose the red shirts.

633
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:41,394
You are K'normian arms dealers.
Put those on.

634
00:44:41,834 --> 00:44:43,395
- Sir?
- Look, if this thing goes south,

635
00:44:43,434 --> 00:44:45,357
there can be nothing
tying us to Starfleet.

636
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:47,880
Unless of course you want to
start a war, Mr. Hendorff.

637
00:44:47,954 --> 00:44:50,355
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

638
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:51,635
Good. Me, neither.

639
00:45:09,594 --> 00:45:12,245
I am detecting
a single life sign in the Ketha Province.

640
00:45:12,314 --> 00:45:14,442
Given the information
provided by Mr. Scott,

641
00:45:14,514 --> 00:45:15,875
this is most likely John Harrison.

642
00:45:15,994 --> 00:45:17,564
Mr. Sulu, I think we found our man.

643
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:18,874
You let him know you mean business.

644
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:20,115
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

645
00:45:21,994 --> 00:45:23,996
Attention, John Harrison.

646
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:27,397
This is Captain Hikaru Sulu
of the U. S. S. Enterprise.

647
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:31,920
A shuttle of highly trained officers
is on its way to your location.

648
00:45:32,554 --> 00:45:35,125
<i>If you do not surrender
to them immediately,</i>

649
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:39,398
<i>I will unleash the entire payload
of advanced long-range torpedoes</i>

650
00:45:39,474 --> 00:45:41,522
<i>currently locked onto your location.</i>

651
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:45,078
<i>You have two minutes
to confirm your compliance.</i>

652
00:45:45,194 --> 00:45:48,038
<i>Refusal to do so will result
in your obliteration.</i>

653
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:53,562
If you test me, you will fail.

654
00:45:57,874 --> 00:45:59,399
Mr. Sulu,

655
00:45:59,714 --> 00:46:02,035
remind me never to piss you off.

656
00:46:07,074 --> 00:46:08,758
We will arrive at Harrison's location

657
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:10,199
in three minutes, Captain.

658
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,924
It is unlikely that he will come willingly.

659
00:46:11,994 --> 00:46:15,794
I calculate the odds
of him attempting to kill us at 91.6%.

660
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:17,080
Fantastic.

661
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:19,034
Good thing you don't care about dying.

662
00:46:20,674 --> 00:46:22,563
I am sorry, Lieutenant.
I could not hear what you said.

663
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:24,199
I didn't say anything.

664
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,121
Actually, I'd be happy to speak

665
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:28,195
- if you're willing to listen to me.
- Guys...

666
00:46:28,354 --> 00:46:29,924
Lieutenant, I would prefer
to discuss this in private.

667
00:46:30,074 --> 00:46:31,360
You'd prefer not to discuss this at all.

668
00:46:31,514 --> 00:46:32,561
Our current circumstances...

669
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:34,045
Are you really gonna do this right now?

670
00:46:34,154 --> 00:46:35,644
What never seems to require
your undivided focus...

671
00:46:35,714 --> 00:46:37,204
I'm sorry, Captain, just two seconds.

672
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:38,640
- Okay.
- It's us.

673
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,955
At that volcano, you didn't
give a thought to us.

674
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:43,561
What it would do to me
if you died, Spock.

675
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,602
You didn't feel anything.

676
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:48,879
You didn't care.

677
00:46:48,954 --> 00:46:51,798
And I'm not the only one who's upset
with you. The Captain is, too.

678
00:46:52,274 --> 00:46:54,561
No, no, no. Don't drag me into this.

679
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:57,360
She is right.

680
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,518
Your suggestion that
I do not care about dying is incorrect.

681
00:47:00,594 --> 00:47:02,278
A sentient being's optimal chance

682
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:04,476
at maximizing their utility
is a long and prosperous life.

683
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:05,555
Great.

684
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:07,279
Not exactly a love song, Spock.

685
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:08,441
You misunderstand.

686
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:12,002
It is true I chose not to feel anything

687
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:14,964
upon realizing that
my own life was ending.

688
00:47:16,114 --> 00:47:17,320
As Admiral Pike was dying,

689
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:19,283
I joined with his consciousness

690
00:47:19,634 --> 00:47:23,241
and experienced what he felt
at the moment of his passing.

691
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:26,481
Anger. Confusion.

692
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,959
Loneliness.

693
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:30,080
<i>Fear.</i>

694
00:47:30,594 --> 00:47:33,484
I had experienced those feelings before,

695
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:35,565
multiplied exponentially

696
00:47:35,634 --> 00:47:38,319
on the day my planet was destroyed.

697
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:41,758
Such a feeling is something I choose

698
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:43,996
never to experience again.

699
00:47:46,594 --> 00:47:49,996
Nyota, you mistake my choice not to feel

700
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:52,840
as a reflection of my not caring.

701
00:47:53,674 --> 00:47:57,565
Well, I assure you,
the truth is precisely the opposite.

702
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:04,835
What the hell was that?

703
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:06,920
What happened? Where's their signal?

704
00:48:06,994 --> 00:48:09,156
It cut out. I'm working to get them back.

705
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,563
We are being pursued by
a D-4 class Klingon vessel.

706
00:48:15,754 --> 00:48:16,721
I thought this sector was abandoned!

707
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:17,955
It must be a random patrol.

708
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:19,155
Hold on!

709
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:24,395
This ship has no offensive capabilities.

710
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:26,317
It's got us. Give me all six fuel cells.

711
00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:27,395
Aye, Captain.

712
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:42,835
Damn it!

713
00:48:44,674 --> 00:48:46,836
They're closing fast, bearing 285!

714
00:48:49,514 --> 00:48:51,394
All right, there! There!
We can lose them there.

715
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:54,434
If you are suggesting
that we utilize the passage

716
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,561
between the approaching structures,

717
00:48:55,714 --> 00:48:57,523
- this ship will not fit.
- We'll fit.

718
00:48:57,674 --> 00:49:00,644
- Captain, we will not fit.
- We'll fit, we'll fit!

719
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:21,158
- I told you we'd fit.
- I am not sure that qualifies.

720
00:49:25,114 --> 00:49:26,195
Any sign of them?

721
00:49:26,394 --> 00:49:27,919
- No. Which worries me.
- We lost them!

722
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:29,354
Or they're jamming our scanners.

723
00:49:29,394 --> 00:49:30,395
Or we lost them.

724
00:49:48,394 --> 00:49:50,715
They're ordering us to land.

725
00:49:52,754 --> 00:49:54,754
Captain, they're gonna
want to know why we're here.

726
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:57,202
And they're gonna torture us.

727
00:49:57,354 --> 00:49:58,924
Question us.

728
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:00,599
And they're gonna kill us.

729
00:50:02,754 --> 00:50:04,483
So we come out shooting.

730
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,644
We're outnumbered, outgunned.

731
00:50:10,914 --> 00:50:13,918
There's no way we survive
if we attack first.

732
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:17,798
You brought me here
because I speak Klingon.

733
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,795
Then let me speak Klingon.

734
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:10,559
This isn't going to work.

735
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,636
It is our only logical option.

736
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:15,804
And if you interrupt her now, you will
not only incur the wrath of the Klingons

737
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:18,480
but that of Lieutenant Uhura as well.

738
00:51:50,514 --> 00:51:52,198
- Lieutenant.
- Thanks, Captain.

739
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:02,639
- Stand down.
- How many torpedoes?

740
00:55:02,714 --> 00:55:03,715
Stand down!

741
00:55:04,394 --> 00:55:07,238
The torpedoes, the weapons you
threatened me with in your message.

742
00:55:07,394 --> 00:55:08,805
How many are there?

743
00:55:10,714 --> 00:55:11,715
Seventy-two.

744
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:20,079
I surrender.

745
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:38,956
On behalf of Christopher Pike,

746
00:55:39,554 --> 00:55:40,601
my friend,

747
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:42,885
I accept your surrender.

748
00:56:07,634 --> 00:56:09,284
Captain!

749
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:18,965
Captain.

750
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:32,199
Cuff him.

751
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:54,315
- Bones, meet me in the brig.
<i>- Be right there.</i>

752
00:56:54,874 --> 00:56:55,875
Lieutenant.

753
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:59,837
Contact Starfleet, let them know
we have Harrison in custody,

754
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:02,721
and we'll be on our way once
the warp core is repaired.

755
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:04,074
Yes, sir.

756
00:57:20,554 --> 00:57:22,682
<i>- Why the hell did he surrender?
- I don't know.</i>

757
00:57:22,874 --> 00:57:24,638
But he just took out a squad
of Klingons single-handedly.

758
00:57:24,714 --> 00:57:25,795
I want to know how.

759
00:57:25,914 --> 00:57:28,281
Sounds like we have
a superman on board.

760
00:57:28,354 --> 00:57:29,685
You tell me.

761
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:40,164
Put your arm through the hole.
I'm gonna take a blood sample.

762
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:57,438
Why aren't we moving, Captain?

763
00:57:58,754 --> 00:58:01,803
An unexpected malfunction,
perhaps in your warp core

764
00:58:01,954 --> 00:58:04,878
conveniently stranding you
on the edge of Klingon space?

765
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:07,235
- How the hell do you know that?
- Bones.

766
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:11,400
I think you'd find
my insight valuable, Captain.

767
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:15,717
- We good?
- Yeah.

768
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:17,364
Let me know what you find.

769
00:58:18,074 --> 00:58:22,398
Ignore me and you
will get everyone on this ship killed.

770
00:58:28,914 --> 00:58:31,520
Captain, I believe
he will only attempt to manipulate you.

771
00:58:31,714 --> 00:58:33,876
I would not recommend
engaging the prisoner further.

772
00:58:33,954 --> 00:58:35,479
Give me a minute.

773
00:58:47,834 --> 00:58:50,201
Let me explain what's happening here.

774
00:58:50,514 --> 00:58:52,323
You are a criminal.

775
00:58:52,634 --> 00:58:55,001
I watched you murder
innocent men and women.

776
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,640
I was authorized to end you!

777
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,322
And the only reason
why you are still alive

778
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:03,038
is because I am allowing it.

779
00:59:03,354 --> 00:59:06,039
So shut your mouth.

780
00:59:06,594 --> 00:59:08,961
Oh, Captain, are you going
to punch me again

781
00:59:09,034 --> 00:59:11,958
over and over till your arm weakens?

782
00:59:12,034 --> 00:59:14,401
Clearly you want to, so tell me,

783
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:17,875
why did you allow me to live?

784
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:19,315
We all make mistakes.

785
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,165
No. I surrendered to you because,

786
00:59:22,234 --> 00:59:24,236
despite your attempt
to convince me otherwise,

787
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:27,238
you seem to have
a conscience, Mr. Kirk.

788
00:59:28,714 --> 00:59:30,921
If you did not,
then it would be impossible for me

789
00:59:30,994 --> 00:59:33,076
to convince you of the truth.

790
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:38,921
23-17-46-11.

791
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,315
Coordinates not far from Earth.

792
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:45,841
If you want to know why I did what I did,

793
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:47,245
go and take a look.

794
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:50,325
Give me one reason
why I should listen to you.

795
00:59:50,514 --> 00:59:52,516
I can give you 72.

796
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:55,599
And they're on board your ship, Captain.

797
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:59,245
They have been all along.

798
00:59:59,674 --> 01:00:02,405
I suggest you open one up.

799
01:00:18,954 --> 01:00:19,955
Hi!

800
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:30,321
You know what really
bothers me, though?

801
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:33,079
It's the modifications,
you know, the enhancements.

802
01:00:33,754 --> 01:00:36,155
Right? And then like that,
I'm off the ship!

803
01:00:36,234 --> 01:00:38,441
Just for trying to do what's right!

804
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:40,604
And what did you do anyway?

805
01:00:40,714 --> 01:00:41,761
You just stood there like an oyster,

806
01:00:41,994 --> 01:00:43,234
looking at me!

807
01:00:43,354 --> 01:00:44,355
What?

808
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,919
Scotty, it's Kirk.

809
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:47,559
Well now!

810
01:00:47,714 --> 01:00:50,638
If it isn't Captain James
Tiberius Perfect Hair!

811
01:00:50,754 --> 01:00:52,563
<i>Did you hear that?
I called him Perfect Hair.</i>

812
01:00:52,714 --> 01:00:54,125
- Where are you?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

813
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,360
Are you drunk?

814
01:00:55,714 --> 01:00:58,524
What I do in my private time
is my business, Jimbo.

815
01:00:58,594 --> 01:00:59,959
I need you to help me out
with something.

816
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,360
Will you take these coordinates down?

817
01:01:01,434 --> 01:01:04,563
23-17-46-11.

818
01:01:05,154 --> 01:01:06,201
<i>Are you writing?</i>

819
01:01:06,274 --> 01:01:08,322
What, you don't think
I can remember four numbers?

820
01:01:09,434 --> 01:01:12,563
You.. little faith.
What was the third one?

821
01:01:13,074 --> 01:01:14,678
<i>Forty-six.</i>

822
01:01:15,234 --> 01:01:17,635
I don't know exactly
what you're looking for,

823
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:20,920
but I have a feeling you'll know it
when you see it.

824
01:01:21,634 --> 01:01:23,762
You may have been right
about those torpedoes.

825
01:01:25,634 --> 01:01:27,875
I will consider that an apology.

826
01:01:27,954 --> 01:01:29,763
And I will consider that apology.

827
01:01:31,114 --> 01:01:32,400
You are the one who quit.

828
01:01:32,594 --> 01:01:34,244
You made me quit!

829
01:01:34,554 --> 01:01:36,124
Mr. Scott?

830
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:37,920
Scott.

831
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,963
The nerve of that guy!

832
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:45,443
I am not doing that man any favors!

833
01:01:45,594 --> 01:01:46,800
No!

834
01:01:47,674 --> 01:01:48,960
All right, then!

835
01:01:49,114 --> 01:01:51,082
Are you out of your corn-fed mind?

836
01:01:51,234 --> 01:01:52,963
You're not actually going
to listen to this guy?

837
01:01:53,034 --> 01:01:54,957
He killed Pike, he almost killed you,

838
01:01:55,034 --> 01:01:57,275
and now you think
it's a good idea to pop open a torpedo

839
01:01:57,394 --> 01:01:58,555
because he dared you to.

840
01:01:58,634 --> 01:02:00,477
Why did he save our lives, Bones?

841
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:02,204
The Doctor does have a point, Captain.

842
01:02:02,314 --> 01:02:04,715
Don't agree with me, Spock.
It makes me very uncomfortable.

843
01:02:04,794 --> 01:02:07,718
Perhaps you, too, should learn
to govern your emotions, Doctor.

844
01:02:07,794 --> 01:02:09,125
In this situation, logic dictates...

845
01:02:09,194 --> 01:02:11,242
Logic? Oh, my God! There's a maniac

846
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:12,964
trying to make us blow up
our own damn ship and...

847
01:02:13,074 --> 01:02:14,803
That's not it.
I don't know why he surrendered,

848
01:02:14,874 --> 01:02:16,319
but that's not it.

849
01:02:16,394 --> 01:02:18,715
Look, we're gonna open a torpedo.
The question is how.

850
01:02:18,794 --> 01:02:20,398
But, Jim, without Mr. Scott on board,

851
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:21,919
who exactly is qualified

852
01:02:21,994 --> 01:02:24,201
to just pop open
a four-ton stick of dynamite?

853
01:02:24,314 --> 01:02:25,918
The Admiral's daughter
appeared to have interest

854
01:02:25,994 --> 01:02:27,996
in the torpedoes
and she is a weapons specialist.

855
01:02:28,554 --> 01:02:30,522
Perhaps she could be of some use.

856
01:02:30,754 --> 01:02:32,358
What Admiral's daughter?

857
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:34,921
Carol Marcus. Your new science officer

858
01:02:34,994 --> 01:02:36,837
concealed her identity to board the ship.

859
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:39,402
When were you going to tell me that?

860
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:41,636
When it became relevant. As it just did.

861
01:02:41,794 --> 01:02:43,319
Are the torpedoes in the weapons bay?

862
01:02:43,394 --> 01:02:44,955
Loaded and ready to fire.
What are they?

863
01:02:45,154 --> 01:02:46,519
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

864
01:02:46,594 --> 01:02:47,880
onto your ship to find out why.

865
01:02:47,954 --> 01:02:49,683
I do apologize for that.

866
01:02:49,754 --> 01:02:52,564
By the way, if I caused you
any problems, I am sorry.

867
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:54,079
I'm Carol Marcus.

868
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:56,236
- James Kirk.
- Torpedoes.

869
01:02:57,154 --> 01:02:59,282
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

870
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:02,039
then I heard he was
developing these prototype torpedoes.

871
01:03:02,114 --> 01:03:05,675
When I went to confront him about it,
he wouldn't even see me.

872
01:03:05,794 --> 01:03:07,922
That's when I discovered
the torpedoes had disappeared

873
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:10,122
from all official records.

874
01:03:10,434 --> 01:03:12,118
And then he gave them to me.

875
01:03:12,234 --> 01:03:15,204
You're much cleverer than
your reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

876
01:03:15,434 --> 01:03:17,004
I have a reputation?

877
01:03:17,074 --> 01:03:19,202
Yes, you do. I'm a friend
of Christine Chapel's.

878
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:21,205
Christine, yes. How is she?

879
01:03:21,274 --> 01:03:23,356
She transferred to the
outer frontier to be a nurse.

880
01:03:23,434 --> 01:03:24,481
She's much happier now.

881
01:03:24,554 --> 01:03:25,555
That's good.

882
01:03:25,794 --> 01:03:28,035
You have no idea
who I'm talking about, do you?

883
01:03:28,994 --> 01:03:29,961
What are we doing in here?

884
01:03:30,034 --> 01:03:31,035
Is this shuttle prepped to fly?

885
01:03:31,194 --> 01:03:32,480
Of course it is.

886
01:03:32,554 --> 01:03:34,238
- Would you please turn around?
- Why?

887
01:03:35,154 --> 01:03:36,644
Just turn around.

888
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:39,716
It's too dangerous to try and open

889
01:03:39,794 --> 01:03:41,717
one of these torpedoes
on the Enterprise.

890
01:03:42,074 --> 01:03:44,554
But there is a nearby planetoid.

891
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:46,238
I can open one up there.

892
01:03:46,394 --> 01:03:48,283
But I will need some help.

893
01:03:48,634 --> 01:03:50,204
Turn around.

894
01:03:51,234 --> 01:03:52,474
Now!

895
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:55,484
Captain on the bridge!

896
01:03:55,754 --> 01:03:57,199
Mr. Sulu,

897
01:03:57,274 --> 01:03:59,754
have Doctors Marcus and McCoy
landed on the planetoid yet?

898
01:03:59,834 --> 01:04:02,519
Yes, sir. They're moving the
torpedo into position now.

899
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:04,836
Good. Any activity from the Klingons?

900
01:04:04,914 --> 01:04:06,200
Not yet.

901
01:04:06,354 --> 01:04:08,515
But if we're stuck
here much longer, they will find us.

902
01:04:09,274 --> 01:04:10,994
Lieutenant Uhura,
did you let Starfleet know

903
01:04:11,034 --> 01:04:12,604
we have Harrison in custody?

904
01:04:12,674 --> 01:04:14,676
Yes, sir. No response yet.

905
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:17,438
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

906
01:04:17,514 --> 01:04:19,755
<i>Hello. Captain, can you hear me?</i>

907
01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:21,603
Mr. Chekov, give me some good news.

908
01:04:21,954 --> 01:04:25,197
We found the leak, sir,
but the damage is substantial.

909
01:04:25,274 --> 01:04:26,275
We're working on it.

910
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:28,118
<i>Any idea what caused it?</i>

911
01:04:28,794 --> 01:04:32,355
No, sir. But I accept full responsibility.

912
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:37,720
Something tells me
it wasn't your fault. Stay on it.

913
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:39,877
Shuttle is standing by, Captain.

914
01:04:40,594 --> 01:04:42,323
Bones, thanks for helping out.

915
01:04:42,434 --> 01:04:44,641
Dr. Marcus asked
for the steadiest hands on the ship.

916
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:46,205
You know, when I dreamt
about being stuck

917
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:48,356
on a deserted planet
with a gorgeous woman,

918
01:04:48,434 --> 01:04:49,799
there was no torpedo!

919
01:04:49,874 --> 01:04:52,559
<i>Dr. McCoy, may I remind you,
you are not there to flirt.</i>

920
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:55,205
So how can these legendary
hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

921
01:04:55,314 --> 01:04:56,361
<i>Bones!</i>

922
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,323
To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

923
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,515
we need to open the warhead.

924
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:01,204
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

925
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:02,275
Unfortunately for us,

926
01:05:02,354 --> 01:05:04,960
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

927
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:06,075
Sweetheart, I once performed

928
01:05:06,154 --> 01:05:08,521
an emergency C-section
on a pregnant Gorn.

929
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:09,595
Octuplets.

930
01:05:09,674 --> 01:05:11,881
And let me tell you,
those little bastards bite.

931
01:05:11,994 --> 01:05:14,679
I think I can work
some magic on your missile.

932
01:05:14,754 --> 01:05:17,644
Dr. McCoy,
there's a bundle of fiber optic cables

933
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:19,125
against the inner casing.

934
01:05:19,194 --> 01:05:21,162
You'll need to cut the 23rd wire down.

935
01:05:21,234 --> 01:05:22,963
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

936
01:05:23,034 --> 01:05:24,035
Do you understand?

937
01:05:24,114 --> 01:05:26,037
Right. The thought
never crossed my mind.

938
01:05:26,234 --> 01:05:27,360
Dr. McCoy,

939
01:05:27,514 --> 01:05:29,482
<i>wait for my word.</i>

940
01:05:29,594 --> 01:05:31,483
<i>I'm rerouting the detonation processor.</i>

941
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:33,636
- Are you ready?
- And raring.

942
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:34,715
Good luck.

943
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:37,557
Sir, the torpedo just armed itself.

944
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,159
The warhead's gonna
detonate in 30 seconds, sir!

945
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:41,555
What the hell happened?
I can't get my arm out!

946
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:43,239
Target their signal.
Beam them back right now.

947
01:05:43,474 --> 01:05:47,115
The transporter cannot differentiate
between Dr. McCoy and the torpedo.

948
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,963
We cannot beam back one
without the other.

949
01:05:49,034 --> 01:05:50,638
Dr. Marcus, can you disarm it?

950
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:53,001
I'm trying. I'm trying-

951
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,515
Jim, get her the hell out of here!

952
01:05:54,594 --> 01:05:56,278
No! If you beam me back, he dies!

953
01:05:56,394 --> 01:05:57,884
<i>Just let me do it!</i>

954
01:05:58,234 --> 01:05:59,918
Ten. Nine.

955
01:06:00,074 --> 01:06:01,075
Eight.

956
01:06:01,274 --> 01:06:03,754
Standing by to transport
Dr. Marcus on your command, sir.

957
01:06:04,634 --> 01:06:05,635
Four. Three.

958
01:06:05,874 --> 01:06:06,875
Shit!

959
01:06:12,714 --> 01:06:14,955
Deactivation successful, Captain.

960
01:06:16,314 --> 01:06:17,804
Dr. McCoy, are you all right?

961
01:06:23,154 --> 01:06:24,394
<i>Bones!</i>

962
01:06:25,474 --> 01:06:26,635
Jim?

963
01:06:27,554 --> 01:06:29,716
You're going to want to see this.

964
01:07:35,314 --> 01:07:38,636
<i>Delta team, deliver your
thrusters to loading dock 12.</i>

965
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:41,318
<i>U.S.S. Vengeance, bridge crew</i>

966
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:43,715
<i>requesting entry to construction hangar.</i>

967
01:07:46,194 --> 01:07:47,634
<i>You are cleared to enter the hangar.</i>

968
01:07:56,394 --> 01:07:59,921
<i>I need a welding team
on the number one nacelle.</i>

969
01:08:03,234 --> 01:08:04,759
Holy...

970
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:07,755
What have we got?

971
01:08:07,874 --> 01:08:08,875
It's quite clever actually.

972
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:11,082
This fuel container's been
removed from the torpedo

973
01:08:11,154 --> 01:08:13,839
and retrofitted to hide this cryo tube.

974
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,324
- Is he alive?
- He's alive.

975
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:19,564
But if we try to revive him

976
01:08:19,794 --> 01:08:22,035
without the proper sequencing,
it could kill him.

977
01:08:22,154 --> 01:08:23,918
This technology's beyond me.

978
01:08:24,194 --> 01:08:25,559
How advanced, Doctor?

979
01:08:25,754 --> 01:08:28,200
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.

980
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:31,758
We haven't needed to freeze anyone
since we developed warp capability,

981
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:35,202
which explains the most interesting
thing about our friend here.

982
01:08:36,194 --> 01:08:37,525
He's 300 years old.

983
01:08:46,394 --> 01:08:48,203
Why is there a man in that torpedo?

984
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:50,604
There are men and women

985
01:08:50,674 --> 01:08:52,483
in all those torpedoes, Captain.

986
01:08:52,554 --> 01:08:54,238
I put them there.

987
01:08:57,394 --> 01:08:58,520
Who the hell are you?

988
01:09:02,594 --> 01:09:05,279
A remnant of a time long past.

989
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,402
Genetically engineered to be superior

990
01:09:08,474 --> 01:09:11,444
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

991
01:09:12,594 --> 01:09:17,600
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

992
01:09:18,874 --> 01:09:20,683
For centuries we slept,

993
01:09:21,794 --> 01:09:25,435
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

994
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:28,036
But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

995
01:09:28,274 --> 01:09:30,436
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

996
01:09:30,554 --> 01:09:31,794
distant quadrants of space.

997
01:09:31,874 --> 01:09:34,639
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

998
01:09:34,714 --> 01:09:36,478
I looked up "John Harrison."

999
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:38,035
Until a year ago, he didn't exist.

1000
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:41,635
John Harrison was a fiction
created the moment I was awoken

1001
01:09:41,714 --> 01:09:44,923
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

1002
01:09:45,194 --> 01:09:48,596
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

1003
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:51,842
My name is

1004
01:09:51,914 --> 01:09:53,404
Khan.

1005
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:00,959
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1006
01:10:01,274 --> 01:10:04,960
ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help?

1007
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:07,765
Because I am better.

1008
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:10,275
- At what?
- Everything.

1009
01:10:11,794 --> 01:10:13,796
Alexander Marcus needed to respond to

1010
01:10:13,874 --> 01:10:15,956
an uncivilized threat in a civilized time

1011
01:10:16,034 --> 01:10:18,480
and for that he needed a Warrior's mind.

1012
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:19,715
My mind.

1013
01:10:20,034 --> 01:10:22,116
To design weapons and warships.

1014
01:10:22,314 --> 01:10:24,237
You are suggesting the Admiral

1015
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:26,283
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1016
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,436
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1017
01:10:28,634 --> 01:10:30,955
He wanted to exploit my savagery.

1018
01:10:31,114 --> 01:10:33,765
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1019
01:10:33,834 --> 01:10:35,598
You... You can't even break a rule.

1020
01:10:35,674 --> 01:10:38,484
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1021
01:10:39,314 --> 01:10:41,999
Marcus used me to design weapons.

1022
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,919
To help him realize
his vision of a militarized Starfleet.

1023
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,759
He sent you to use those weapons.

1024
01:10:48,194 --> 01:10:52,199
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1025
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:55,605
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1026
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:59,594
in enemy space,
leading to one inevitable outcome.

1027
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,284
The Klingons would come searching

1028
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:03,203
for whomever was responsible,

1029
01:11:03,314 --> 01:11:05,442
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1030
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:09,957
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1031
01:11:10,034 --> 01:11:12,116
The war he always wanted.

1032
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:13,884
No. No.

1033
01:11:14,874 --> 01:11:16,035
I watched you open fire

1034
01:11:16,194 --> 01:11:18,720
in a room full of
unarmed Starfleet officers.

1035
01:11:18,954 --> 01:11:20,718
You killed them in cold blood!

1036
01:11:20,794 --> 01:11:23,320
Marcus took my crew from me.

1037
01:11:23,474 --> 01:11:25,522
You are a murderer!

1038
01:11:25,674 --> 01:11:29,201
He used my friends to control me.

1039
01:11:32,594 --> 01:11:35,245
I tried to smuggle them to safety

1040
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:37,043
by concealing them in the very weapons

1041
01:11:37,114 --> 01:11:38,843
I had designed,

1042
01:11:40,594 --> 01:11:42,596
but I was discovered.

1043
01:11:43,914 --> 01:11:47,600
I had no choice but to escape alone.

1044
01:11:49,074 --> 01:11:53,284
And when I did,
I had every reason to suspect

1045
01:11:53,354 --> 01:11:57,643
that Marcus had killed every single one

1046
01:11:57,714 --> 01:12:01,161
of the people I hold most dear.

1047
01:12:05,274 --> 01:12:08,005
So I responded in kind.

1048
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,125
My crew

1049
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:16,119
is my family, Kirk.

1050
01:12:16,314 --> 01:12:20,319
Is there anything
you would not do for your family?

1051
01:12:22,434 --> 01:12:23,640
<i>Proximity alert, sir!</i>

1052
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,478
<i>There's a ship at warp
heading right for us.</i>

1053
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:27,522
- Klingons?
- At warp?

1054
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:28,965
No, Kirk.

1055
01:12:29,034 --> 01:12:31,196
<i>- We both know who it is.
- I don't think so.</i>

1056
01:12:31,394 --> 01:12:33,396
<i>It's not coming at us from Kronos.</i>

1057
01:12:38,474 --> 01:12:39,680
Lieutenant, move Khan to med bay.

1058
01:12:39,754 --> 01:12:41,115
Post six security officers on him.

1059
01:12:41,154 --> 01:12:42,235
Yes, Captain.

1060
01:12:42,514 --> 01:12:43,879
Captain on the bridge!

1061
01:12:44,714 --> 01:12:46,239
ETA of the incoming ship.

1062
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:47,600
Three seconds, sir.

1063
01:12:49,554 --> 01:12:51,556
- Shields.
- Aye, Captain.

1064
01:13:15,914 --> 01:13:16,961
They're hailing us, sir.

1065
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,725
On screen.

1066
01:13:20,714 --> 01:13:23,001
Broadcast shipwide, for the record.

1067
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:28,405
<i>Captain Kirk.</i>

1068
01:13:29,834 --> 01:13:32,485
Admiral Marcus. I wasn't expecting you.

1069
01:13:33,394 --> 01:13:35,203
That's a hell of a ship you got there.

1070
01:13:35,434 --> 01:13:36,560
<i>And I wasn't expecting to get word</i>

1071
01:13:36,674 --> 01:13:38,278
<i>that you'd taken Harrison into custody</i>

1072
01:13:38,394 --> 01:13:40,044
<i>in violation of your orders.</i>

1073
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,558
Well, we...

1074
01:13:42,634 --> 01:13:44,602
We had to improvise
when our warp core

1075
01:13:44,674 --> 01:13:46,642
unexpectedly malfunctioned.

1076
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:48,682
But you already knew that,
didn't you, sir?

1077
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:50,199
<i>I don't take your meaning.</i>

1078
01:13:50,354 --> 01:13:51,915
Well, that's why you're here, isn't it?

1079
01:13:51,954 --> 01:13:54,036
To assist with our repairs?

1080
01:13:54,714 --> 01:13:56,398
Why else would the head of Starfleet

1081
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,397
personally come to the edge
of the Neutral Zone?

1082
01:13:59,794 --> 01:14:01,398
Captain, they're scanning our ship.

1083
01:14:01,594 --> 01:14:03,676
Is there something
I can help you find, sir?

1084
01:14:04,554 --> 01:14:06,238
<i>Where is your prisoner, Kirk?</i>

1085
01:14:06,314 --> 01:14:07,520
Per Starfleet regulation,

1086
01:14:07,674 --> 01:14:11,838
I'm planning on returning Khan
to Earth to stand trial.

1087
01:14:12,914 --> 01:14:14,564
Well, shit.

1088
01:14:15,554 --> 01:14:17,079
You talked to him.

1089
01:14:18,314 --> 01:14:20,840
This is exactly what I was
hoping to spare you from.

1090
01:14:21,034 --> 01:14:23,765
<i>I took a tactical risk
and I woke that bastard up,</i>

1091
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,201
<i>believing that his superior intelligence</i>

1092
01:14:26,434 --> 01:14:29,199
could help us protect ourselves
from whatever came at us next.

1093
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:32,399
But I made a mistake.

1094
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:36,560
<i>And now the blood
of everybody he's killed is on my hands.</i>

1095
01:14:37,154 --> 01:14:39,202
So I'm asking you,

1096
01:14:39,314 --> 01:14:41,078
give him to me

1097
01:14:41,154 --> 01:14:44,237
so that I can end what I started.

1098
01:14:47,234 --> 01:14:48,963
And what exactly
would you like me to do

1099
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:50,923
with the rest of his crew, sir?

1100
01:14:52,394 --> 01:14:56,035
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?

1101
01:14:56,114 --> 01:14:57,684
Start a war in the process?

1102
01:14:57,794 --> 01:15:00,604
He put those people in those torpedoes.

1103
01:15:00,754 --> 01:15:02,279
<i>And I simply didn't want to burden you</i>

1104
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:04,561
<i>with knowing what was inside of them.</i>

1105
01:15:04,714 --> 01:15:06,557
<i>You saw what this man
can do all by himself.</i>

1106
01:15:06,674 --> 01:15:10,440
<i>Can you imagine what would happen
if we woke up the rest of his crew?</i>

1107
01:15:11,154 --> 01:15:13,555
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?

1108
01:15:13,754 --> 01:15:16,564
<i>He's playing you, son,
don't you see that?</i>

1109
01:15:16,754 --> 01:15:20,281
<i>Khan and his crew were condemned
to death as war criminals.</i>

1110
01:15:20,674 --> 01:15:22,756
<i>And now it is our duty
to carry out that sentence</i>

1111
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:25,280
<i>before anybody else
dies because of him.</i>

1112
01:15:27,834 --> 01:15:30,201
Now, I'm going to ask you again!

1113
01:15:31,034 --> 01:15:33,275
One last time, son.

1114
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:36,798
<i>Lower your shields.</i>

1115
01:15:37,194 --> 01:15:38,958
<i>Tell me where he is.</i>

1116
01:15:41,874 --> 01:15:43,797
He's in engineering, sir.

1117
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:46,879
But I'll have him moved

1118
01:15:46,954 --> 01:15:48,956
to the transporter room right away.

1119
01:15:49,114 --> 01:15:50,957
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

1120
01:15:51,754 --> 01:15:52,721
Do not drop those shields,

1121
01:15:52,794 --> 01:15:53,834
- Mr. Sulu.
- Aye, Captain.

1122
01:15:53,874 --> 01:15:54,875
Captain, given your awareness

1123
01:15:54,954 --> 01:15:56,515
of Khan's true location in the med bay,

1124
01:15:56,554 --> 01:15:58,238
may I know the details of your plan?

1125
01:15:58,314 --> 01:16:01,204
I told Marcus we were
bringing a fugitive back to Earth.

1126
01:16:01,314 --> 01:16:02,964
That's what we're going to do.

1127
01:16:03,274 --> 01:16:04,639
Mr. Chekov, can we warp?

1128
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:06,398
Sir, if we go to warp,

1129
01:16:06,474 --> 01:16:09,603
we run the risk of
seriously damaging the core!

1130
01:16:09,674 --> 01:16:11,119
<i>Can we do it?</i>

1131
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:15,600
Technically, yes, but I
would not advise it, Captain.

1132
01:16:15,874 --> 01:16:17,114
Noted.

1133
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:20,036
Mr. Sulu, set course for Earth.

1134
01:16:20,154 --> 01:16:21,155
Yes, sir.

1135
01:16:22,314 --> 01:16:23,725
Punch it.

1136
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:33,564
Well, at least we're moving again.

1137
01:16:35,354 --> 01:16:38,995
If you think you're safe
at warp, you're wrong.

1138
01:16:42,914 --> 01:16:44,518
Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet.

1139
01:16:44,594 --> 01:16:46,119
Tell them we were pursued
into the Neutral Zone

1140
01:16:46,194 --> 01:16:47,798
by an unmarked Federation ship.

1141
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:49,000
Comms are down, sir.

1142
01:16:51,514 --> 01:16:52,561
Permission to come on the bridge.

1143
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:53,675
Dr. Marcus.

1144
01:16:54,394 --> 01:16:55,725
He's gonna catch up with us,
and when he does,

1145
01:16:55,874 --> 01:16:57,205
the only thing
that's gonna stop him destroying

1146
01:16:57,274 --> 01:16:58,685
this ship is me,
so you have to let me talk to him.

1147
01:16:58,794 --> 01:17:00,674
Carol, we're at warp.
He can't catch up with us.

1148
01:17:00,714 --> 01:17:01,954
Yes, he can.
He's been developing a ship

1149
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,320
that has advanced warp capabilities...

1150
01:17:03,394 --> 01:17:06,045
Captain! I'm getting
a reading I don't understand.

1151
01:17:35,954 --> 01:17:37,001
Where are we?

1152
01:17:37,074 --> 01:17:38,235
We're 237,000 kilometers from Earth.

1153
01:17:38,314 --> 01:17:39,315
- Damage report!
- Weapons are way down.

1154
01:17:39,394 --> 01:17:40,805
- Shields are dropping.
- We're defenseless, sir.

1155
01:17:40,914 --> 01:17:42,154
Sir, we have a bulkhead breach.

1156
01:17:42,234 --> 01:17:44,236
- Where's the damage?
- Major hull damage, Captain.

1157
01:17:49,754 --> 01:17:52,155
Evasive maneuvers! Get us to Earth!
Right now!

1158
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:55,522
Captain! Stop!
Everybody on this ship is going to die

1159
01:17:55,594 --> 01:17:56,915
if you don't let me speak to him.

1160
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:01,083
Uhura, hail him.

1161
01:18:01,754 --> 01:18:04,075
Sir. It's me. It's Carol.

1162
01:18:13,754 --> 01:18:16,405
<i>What are you doing on that ship?</i>

1163
01:18:16,594 --> 01:18:18,278
I heard what you said.

1164
01:18:19,954 --> 01:18:21,115
That you made a mistake

1165
01:18:21,194 --> 01:18:23,595
and now you're doing
everything you can to fix it.

1166
01:18:24,794 --> 01:18:26,125
But, Dad,

1167
01:18:29,434 --> 01:18:33,200
I don't believe that
the man who raised me

1168
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:37,916
is capable of destroying a ship
full of innocent people.

1169
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:40,879
<i>And, if I'm wrong about that,</i>

1170
01:18:40,954 --> 01:18:43,400
then you're gonna have to
do it with me on board.

1171
01:18:46,474 --> 01:18:48,158
<i>Actually, Carol, I won't.</i>

1172
01:18:53,154 --> 01:18:54,565
- Jim...
- Can we intercept the transport signal?

1173
01:18:54,674 --> 01:18:55,675
No, sir.

1174
01:18:57,994 --> 01:18:58,995
Carol!

1175
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:01,477
<i>Captain Kirk, without authorization</i>

1176
01:19:01,594 --> 01:19:03,722
<i>and in league with
the fugitive John Harrison,</i>

1177
01:19:03,834 --> 01:19:05,643
<i>you went rogue in enemy territory,</i>

1178
01:19:05,794 --> 01:19:06,841
<i>leaving me no choice</i>

1179
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:08,837
<i>but to hunt you down and destroy you.</i>

1180
01:19:09,154 --> 01:19:11,395
- Lock phasers.
- Wait, sir, wait, wait, wait!

1181
01:19:11,594 --> 01:19:12,595
<i>I'll make this quick.</i>

1182
01:19:12,674 --> 01:19:14,961
<i>Target all aft torpedoes
on the Enterprise bridge.</i>

1183
01:19:15,154 --> 01:19:17,521
Sir, my crew
was just following my orders.

1184
01:19:17,594 --> 01:19:20,074
I take full responsibility for my actions.

1185
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:22,236
But they were mine
and they were mine alone.

1186
01:19:23,234 --> 01:19:25,282
If I transmit Khan's location to you now,

1187
01:19:25,434 --> 01:19:27,755
all that I ask is that you spare them.

1188
01:19:34,594 --> 01:19:36,437
Please, sir.

1189
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,436
I'll do anything you want.

1190
01:19:41,874 --> 01:19:43,683
Just let them live.

1191
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:47,595
That's a hell of an apology.

1192
01:19:47,874 --> 01:19:49,956
But if it's any consolation,

1193
01:19:50,034 --> 01:19:52,036
I was never going to spare your crew.

1194
01:19:54,114 --> 01:19:55,445
<i>Fire 'em...</i>

1195
01:20:15,874 --> 01:20:17,080
I'm sorry.

1196
01:20:24,394 --> 01:20:25,555
Our weapons won't fire, sir!

1197
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:26,920
Our shields are down!
We're losing power!

1198
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:29,235
Someone in engineering
just manually reset our systems!

1199
01:20:29,474 --> 01:20:31,761
What do you mean, "someone"? Who?

1200
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:34,480
Their weapons have powered down. Sir.

1201
01:20:34,594 --> 01:20:36,835
<i>Enterprise! Can you hear me?</i>

1202
01:20:36,914 --> 01:20:38,040
Scotty!

1203
01:20:40,154 --> 01:20:42,122
Guess what I found behind Jupiter.

1204
01:20:42,234 --> 01:20:44,123
- You're on that ship!
<i>- I snuck on.</i>

1205
01:20:44,234 --> 01:20:45,679
And seeing as I've just
committed an act of treason

1206
01:20:45,754 --> 01:20:47,358
against a Starfleet
Admiral, I'd really like

1207
01:20:47,434 --> 01:20:49,596
to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!

1208
01:20:49,754 --> 01:20:50,835
You're a miracle worker.

1209
01:20:50,914 --> 01:20:52,757
We're a little low on power right now.

1210
01:20:52,874 --> 01:20:53,875
<i>Just stand by. Stand by.</i>

1211
01:20:53,954 --> 01:20:55,194
What do you mean, "low on power"?

1212
01:20:55,274 --> 01:20:56,554
<i>What happened to the Enterprise?</i>

1213
01:20:57,234 --> 01:20:58,520
Call you back.

1214
01:21:00,274 --> 01:21:01,435
Scotty!

1215
01:21:02,634 --> 01:21:05,114
Spock. Our ship, how is she?

1216
01:21:05,514 --> 01:21:06,959
Our options are limited, Captain.

1217
01:21:07,074 --> 01:21:09,042
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.

1218
01:21:12,194 --> 01:21:13,355
There is one option.

1219
01:21:13,554 --> 01:21:15,283
Uhura, when you get Scotty back,

1220
01:21:15,394 --> 01:21:17,203
- patch him through.
- Yes, sir.

1221
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:18,600
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

1222
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,637
Captain, I strongly object.

1223
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:26,557
To what? I haven't said anything yet.

1224
01:21:26,634 --> 01:21:28,204
Since we cannot take
the ship from the outside,

1225
01:21:28,314 --> 01:21:29,804
the only way we can take it
is from within.

1226
01:21:29,874 --> 01:21:31,478
And as a large boarding party
would be detected,

1227
01:21:31,594 --> 01:21:32,641
it is optimal for you to take

1228
01:21:32,714 --> 01:21:34,478
as few members
of the crew as possible.

1229
01:21:34,554 --> 01:21:37,000
You will meet resistance,
requiring personnel

1230
01:21:37,154 --> 01:21:38,235
with advanced combat abilities

1231
01:21:38,314 --> 01:21:40,157
and innate knowledge of that ship.

1232
01:21:40,394 --> 01:21:42,396
This indicates that
you plan to align with Khan,

1233
01:21:42,474 --> 01:21:44,397
the very man
we were sent here to destroy.

1234
01:21:44,634 --> 01:21:46,274
I'm not aligning with him, I'm using him.

1235
01:21:46,314 --> 01:21:48,316
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

1236
01:21:48,394 --> 01:21:50,396
An Arabic proverb attributed
to a prince who was

1237
01:21:50,474 --> 01:21:52,238
betrayed and decapitated
by his own subjects.

1238
01:21:52,314 --> 01:21:54,476
Still, it's a hell of a quote.

1239
01:21:54,554 --> 01:21:56,841
- I will go with you, Captain.
- No, I need you on the bridge.

1240
01:21:56,914 --> 01:21:58,678
I cannot allow you to do this.

1241
01:21:58,754 --> 01:22:00,483
It is my function aboard
this ship to advise you

1242
01:22:00,634 --> 01:22:01,999
on making the wisest
decisions possible,

1243
01:22:02,114 --> 01:22:03,161
something I firmly believe

1244
01:22:03,274 --> 01:22:04,719
you are incapable
of doing in this moment.

1245
01:22:04,914 --> 01:22:06,245
You're right!

1246
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,358
What I'm about to do,
it doesn't make any sense,

1247
01:22:09,554 --> 01:22:12,000
it's not logical. It is a gut feeling.

1248
01:22:15,434 --> 01:22:18,005
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

1249
01:22:19,194 --> 01:22:21,401
I only know what I can do.

1250
01:22:22,034 --> 01:22:23,604
The Enterprise and her crew
need someone

1251
01:22:23,674 --> 01:22:26,484
in that chair that knows what he's doing.

1252
01:22:30,034 --> 01:22:31,445
And it's not me.

1253
01:22:34,354 --> 01:22:35,719
It's you, Spock.

1254
01:22:58,514 --> 01:23:00,234
Tell me everything you know
about that ship.

1255
01:23:00,594 --> 01:23:02,358
Dreadnought class.

1256
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:04,118
Two times the size,
three times the speed.

1257
01:23:04,194 --> 01:23:07,038
Advanced weaponry.
Modified for a minimal crew.

1258
01:23:07,114 --> 01:23:10,038
Unlike most Federation vessels,
it's built solely for combat.

1259
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:13,435
I will do everything I can

1260
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,401
to make you answer for what you did.

1261
01:23:22,634 --> 01:23:24,238
But right now I need your help.

1262
01:23:24,354 --> 01:23:26,277
In exchange for what?

1263
01:23:27,634 --> 01:23:29,955
You said you'd do anything
for your crew.

1264
01:23:31,474 --> 01:23:34,239
- I can guarantee their safety.
- Captain.

1265
01:23:35,114 --> 01:23:38,800
You can't even guarantee
the safety of your own crew.

1266
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:46,558
Bones, what are you doing
with that tribble?

1267
01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:48,725
The tribble's dead.

1268
01:23:48,794 --> 01:23:52,276
I'm injecting Khan's platelets into
the deceased tissue of a necrotic host.

1269
01:23:53,314 --> 01:23:55,794
Khan's cells regenerate
like nothing I've ever seen,

1270
01:23:55,874 --> 01:23:57,603
and I want to know why.

1271
01:24:02,754 --> 01:24:04,995
You coming with me or not?

1272
01:24:07,594 --> 01:24:09,244
You want to do what?

1273
01:24:09,434 --> 01:24:10,765
We're coming over there.
Sulu's maneuvering

1274
01:24:10,834 --> 01:24:12,677
<i>the Enterprise
into position as we speak.</i>

1275
01:24:12,754 --> 01:24:14,199
<i>To this ship? How?</i>

1276
01:24:14,474 --> 01:24:16,841
There's a cargo door,
hangar 7, access port 101A.

1277
01:24:16,914 --> 01:24:18,996
You need to find
the manual override to open that airlock.

1278
01:24:19,074 --> 01:24:21,964
Are you crazy? Whoever you are.

1279
01:24:22,194 --> 01:24:23,958
Just listen to him, Scotty.
It's gonna be all right.

1280
01:24:24,154 --> 01:24:25,519
It is not gonna be all right.

1281
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:27,403
You want me to open
an airlock into space,

1282
01:24:27,474 --> 01:24:30,364
whereupon I will freeze,
die and explode!

1283
01:24:30,594 --> 01:24:32,084
Lieutenant,
from our current position, is it possible

1284
01:24:32,154 --> 01:24:34,122
to establish contact with New Vulcan?

1285
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:37,280
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

1286
01:24:39,034 --> 01:24:41,355
Mr. Sulu, what is
the status of the other ship?

1287
01:24:41,434 --> 01:24:43,038
Their systems are still offline.

1288
01:24:43,114 --> 01:24:44,957
I'm aligning our ship now.

1289
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:20,674
Scotty, how we doing over there?

1290
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:23,076
<i>Captain, I wish I had better news.</i>

1291
01:25:23,674 --> 01:25:25,836
<i>They've locked out access
to the ship's computer.</i>

1292
01:25:25,914 --> 01:25:27,484
<i>They'll have full weapons in</i>

1293
01:25:27,874 --> 01:25:29,035
three minutes.

1294
01:25:29,114 --> 01:25:30,764
That means next time
I won't be able to stop them

1295
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:32,677
destroying the Enterprise. Stand by.

1296
01:25:34,354 --> 01:25:35,435
Commander, our trash exhaust
is aimed at

1297
01:25:35,514 --> 01:25:37,755
access port 101A of the other ship.

1298
01:25:37,834 --> 01:25:39,563
Captain, the ships are aligned.

1299
01:25:39,714 --> 01:25:40,681
Copy that.

1300
01:25:40,754 --> 01:25:43,883
- Scotty!
- I'm in the hangar. Give me a minute.

1301
01:25:48,194 --> 01:25:50,515
I'm running. Stand by.

1302
01:26:00,354 --> 01:26:01,879
Whoa, whoa, hold on, now, Captain.

1303
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:04,878
This door is very wee.
I mean, you know, small.

1304
01:26:05,074 --> 01:26:07,076
It's four square meters, tops.

1305
01:26:07,234 --> 01:26:09,157
It's gonna be like
jumping out of a moving car,

1306
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:11,157
off a bridge, into your shot glass.

1307
01:26:11,354 --> 01:26:13,118
It's okay. I've done it before.

1308
01:26:15,034 --> 01:26:16,115
Yeah, it was vertical.

1309
01:26:16,194 --> 01:26:19,118
We jumped onto a... It was a...

1310
01:26:19,194 --> 01:26:20,400
It doesn't matter. Scotty...

1311
01:26:20,474 --> 01:26:21,680
Did you find the manual override?

1312
01:26:21,754 --> 01:26:23,040
The manual override, Scotty.

1313
01:26:23,274 --> 01:26:24,924
Not yet, not yet.

1314
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:33,238
Captain, before you launch,
you should be aware there is

1315
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:35,123
a considerable debris field
between our ships.

1316
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:37,925
- Spock, not now. Scotty, you good?
- It's not easy!

1317
01:26:37,994 --> 01:26:40,725
Just give me two seconds,
all right, you mad bastard!

1318
01:26:48,914 --> 01:26:51,235
Tell me this is gonna work.

1319
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:53,519
I have neither the information

1320
01:26:53,594 --> 01:26:55,403
nor the confidence to do so, Doctor.

1321
01:26:55,594 --> 01:26:56,925
<i>Okay, Captain, stand by.</i>

1322
01:26:57,234 --> 01:26:58,679
Boy, you're a real comfort.

1323
01:27:00,074 --> 01:27:02,076
Come on, come on, come on.

1324
01:27:02,194 --> 01:27:03,275
Yes!

1325
01:27:03,394 --> 01:27:04,919
<i>Okay, okay!
I'm set to open the door.</i>

1326
01:27:04,994 --> 01:27:06,120
You ready?

1327
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:07,685
Are you?

1328
01:27:10,914 --> 01:27:12,279
Spock, pull the trigger.

1329
01:27:13,514 --> 01:27:14,515
Yes, Captain.

1330
01:27:20,274 --> 01:27:21,958
Launching activation sequence on

1331
01:27:22,194 --> 01:27:23,480
three,

1332
01:27:23,634 --> 01:27:24,840
<i>two,</i>

1333
01:27:25,474 --> 01:27:26,475
<i>one.</i>

1334
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:39,365
Sir, Kirk is headed for collision at 432!

1335
01:27:39,674 --> 01:27:41,483
Captain, there is debris directly ahead.

1336
01:27:41,554 --> 01:27:42,555
Copy that.

1337
01:27:46,554 --> 01:27:47,965
Whoa! Jim, you're way off course!

1338
01:27:48,114 --> 01:27:49,354
I know, I know! I can see that.

1339
01:27:59,834 --> 01:28:01,359
Don't move.

1340
01:28:03,634 --> 01:28:05,159
Use your display compass, Captain.

1341
01:28:05,234 --> 01:28:06,281
You must correct precisely

1342
01:28:06,354 --> 01:28:08,436
<i>- 37.243 degrees.
- Got it.</i>

1343
01:28:08,714 --> 01:28:09,715
I'm working my way back.

1344
01:28:12,554 --> 01:28:14,594
Scotty, you're gonna be ready
with that door, right?

1345
01:28:15,794 --> 01:28:17,125
What are you doing in here?

1346
01:28:17,594 --> 01:28:21,201
Wee bit of maintenance
on the airlock console. You're big.

1347
01:28:21,394 --> 01:28:22,680
Mr. Scott, where are you?

1348
01:28:22,754 --> 01:28:24,154
Captain, he can't seem to hear you.

1349
01:28:24,194 --> 01:28:26,117
I'm working on getting
his signal back. Stand by.

1350
01:28:28,834 --> 01:28:30,677
<i>- Damn it.
- Captain, what is it?</i>

1351
01:28:30,754 --> 01:28:31,755
My helmet was hit.

1352
01:28:31,834 --> 01:28:33,438
Uhura, tell me you have Mr. Scott back.

1353
01:28:33,674 --> 01:28:35,005
Not yet. I'm still working on a signal.

1354
01:28:35,194 --> 01:28:36,639
<i>His communicator is working.</i>

1355
01:28:36,754 --> 01:28:38,915
<i>- I don't know why he isn't responding.</i>
- What is that?

1356
01:28:38,994 --> 01:28:40,439
Are you Starfleet or private security?

1357
01:28:40,514 --> 01:28:41,481
Show me your other hand.

1358
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:42,680
Because you look like private security.

1359
01:28:42,754 --> 01:28:44,244
Imminent collision detected!

1360
01:28:44,394 --> 01:28:45,395
Khan, use evasive action!

1361
01:28:45,474 --> 01:28:47,556
- There is debris directly ahead.
- I see it.

1362
01:28:54,634 --> 01:28:55,840
Mr. Sulu, did we lose Khan?

1363
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:58,914
I don't know, Commander. I'm having
trouble tracking him in all this debris.

1364
01:28:59,194 --> 01:29:00,400
Was Khan hit?

1365
01:29:00,554 --> 01:29:01,794
We are trying to find him now.

1366
01:29:02,074 --> 01:29:03,724
Captain, you need to adjust
your target destination

1367
01:29:03,794 --> 01:29:06,115
to 183 by 473 degrees.

1368
01:29:17,474 --> 01:29:19,556
Spock, my display's dead.
I'm flying blind.

1369
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:21,804
Captain, without your display compass,

1370
01:29:21,874 --> 01:29:23,717
hitting your target destination
is mathematically impossible.

1371
01:29:24,074 --> 01:29:25,235
Spock, if I get back,

1372
01:29:25,314 --> 01:29:27,234
we really need to talk
about your bedside manner.

1373
01:29:27,274 --> 01:29:29,276
Commander, he's not going to make it.

1374
01:29:34,874 --> 01:29:36,478
My display is still functioning.

1375
01:29:36,594 --> 01:29:38,244
I see you, Kirk,
you're 200 meters ahead of me

1376
01:29:38,314 --> 01:29:39,554
at my one o'clock.

1377
01:29:39,634 --> 01:29:41,682
Come to your left
a few degrees and follow me.

1378
01:29:54,314 --> 01:29:55,645
Scotty, we're getting close.
We need a warm welcome.

1379
01:29:55,794 --> 01:29:58,274
Do you copy? Do you copy? Scotty?

1380
01:29:58,354 --> 01:29:59,685
If you can hear us, Mr. Scott,

1381
01:29:59,754 --> 01:30:01,563
- open the door in ten, nine...
- Scotty!

1382
01:30:01,634 --> 01:30:02,674
That person counting down,

1383
01:30:02,714 --> 01:30:03,754
- what is that?
- ...eight...

1384
01:30:03,794 --> 01:30:04,920
I think you're hearing things, mate.

1385
01:30:05,034 --> 01:30:06,798
- ...seven...
- Mr. Scott, where are you?

1386
01:30:06,914 --> 01:30:09,997
- ...six, five...
- 1,800 meters. 1,600 meters.

1387
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:11,440
- Scotty, where are you?
- ...three...

1388
01:30:11,554 --> 01:30:13,318
- Do you copy, Scotty? Please!
- ...two...

1389
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:14,600
- Sorry about this.
- About what?

1390
01:30:14,754 --> 01:30:15,960
- Mr. Scott, open the door!
- Open the door!

1391
01:30:16,074 --> 01:30:17,678
<i>Mr. Scott, now!</i>

1392
01:30:38,874 --> 01:30:40,524
Welcome aboard.

1393
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:44,441
- It's good to see you, Scotty.
- Who is that?

1394
01:30:46,914 --> 01:30:48,564
Khan, Scotty. Scotty, Khan.

1395
01:30:48,794 --> 01:30:50,000
Hello.

1396
01:30:50,714 --> 01:30:52,125
They'll know we're here.

1397
01:30:52,194 --> 01:30:54,162
I know the best way to the bridge.

1398
01:30:57,994 --> 01:30:59,678
It's locked to stun.

1399
01:30:59,914 --> 01:31:01,245
Theirs won't be.

1400
01:31:01,474 --> 01:31:03,158
Try not to get shot.

1401
01:31:06,234 --> 01:31:09,078
Commander, I have that
transmission as requested.

1402
01:31:09,434 --> 01:31:11,084
On screen, please.

1403
01:31:11,434 --> 01:31:12,595
Stand by.

1404
01:31:18,754 --> 01:31:20,119
<i>Mr. Spock.</i>

1405
01:31:21,594 --> 01:31:22,925
Mr. Spock.

1406
01:31:27,434 --> 01:31:28,674
Admiral.

1407
01:31:31,634 --> 01:31:32,760
I'll deal with you in a...

1408
01:31:35,434 --> 01:31:37,801
I am ashamed to be your daughter.

1409
01:31:41,714 --> 01:31:44,365
Sir, we just had
a hangar door open on deck 13.

1410
01:31:45,794 --> 01:31:46,955
Khan.

1411
01:31:47,194 --> 01:31:49,481
They're going to have
full power and we're walking?

1412
01:31:49,554 --> 01:31:50,715
The turbolifts are easily tracked

1413
01:31:50,794 --> 01:31:52,205
and Marcus would have us in a cage.

1414
01:31:52,274 --> 01:31:54,561
This path runs adjacent
to the engine room.

1415
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:56,318
They know they
won't be able to use their weapons here

1416
01:31:56,394 --> 01:31:57,634
without destabilizing the warp core,

1417
01:31:57,714 --> 01:31:59,125
which gives us the advantage.

1418
01:31:59,234 --> 01:32:01,965
- Where'd you find this guy?
- It's a long story.

1419
01:32:02,234 --> 01:32:03,315
<i>I Will be brief.</i>

1420
01:32:04,314 --> 01:32:07,636
In your travels, did you ever
encounter a man named Khan?

1421
01:32:12,234 --> 01:32:13,315
<i>As you know,</i>

1422
01:32:13,394 --> 01:32:15,715
<i>I have made a vow
never to give you information</i>

1423
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:18,758
<i>that could potentially alter your destiny.</i>

1424
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:24,322
<i>Your path is yours to walk,
and yours alone.</i>

1425
01:32:27,994 --> 01:32:29,996
<i>That being said,</i>

1426
01:32:31,154 --> 01:32:35,364
<i>Khan Noonien Singh is
the most dangerous adversary</i>

1427
01:32:35,434 --> 01:32:37,675
the Enterprise ever faced.

1428
01:32:38,354 --> 01:32:41,244
<i>He is brilliant, ruthless,</i>

1429
01:32:41,434 --> 01:32:43,914
<i>and he will not hesitate to kill</i>

1430
01:32:43,994 --> 01:32:45,962
<i>every single one of you.</i>

1431
01:32:49,674 --> 01:32:51,483
Did you defeat him?

1432
01:32:52,354 --> 01:32:55,676
<i>At great cost. Yes.</i>

1433
01:32:57,674 --> 01:32:58,675
How?

1434
01:32:58,834 --> 01:33:00,882
I don't mean to tempt fate here,
but where is everybody?

1435
01:33:00,954 --> 01:33:02,683
The ship is designed
to be flown by minimal crew,

1436
01:33:02,754 --> 01:33:03,801
one, if necessary.

1437
01:33:03,874 --> 01:33:05,114
One? I...

1438
01:33:26,394 --> 01:33:28,715
- You all right?
- Yeah. Where's Khan?

1439
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,555
Lieutenant, I need you to
assemble all senior medical

1440
01:33:36,634 --> 01:33:38,235
and engineering staff
in the weapons bay.

1441
01:33:38,994 --> 01:33:40,155
All right.

1442
01:33:41,634 --> 01:33:44,843
Dr. McCoy, you inadvertently
activated a torpedo.

1443
01:33:44,914 --> 01:33:46,194
Could you replicate the process?

1444
01:33:46,234 --> 01:33:47,714
Why the hell would I want to do that?

1445
01:33:47,754 --> 01:33:49,165
Can you or can you not?

1446
01:33:49,234 --> 01:33:52,044
Damn it, man, I'm a doctor,
not a torpedo technician!

1447
01:33:52,234 --> 01:33:53,360
The fact that you
are a doctor is precisely

1448
01:33:53,474 --> 01:33:55,078
why I need you to listen very carefully.

1449
01:33:56,594 --> 01:33:57,925
Where is he?

1450
01:34:03,434 --> 01:34:04,765
Shit!

1451
01:34:05,074 --> 01:34:07,042
This way.

1452
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:11,845
The minute we get
to the bridge, drop him.

1453
01:34:11,914 --> 01:34:15,396
What, stun him? Khan?
I thought he was helping us.

1454
01:34:15,554 --> 01:34:17,318
I'm pretty sure we're helping him.

1455
01:34:26,514 --> 01:34:27,879
Power coming online, sir!

1456
01:34:28,034 --> 01:34:30,162
- Retarget the Enterprise now.
- Aye, sir.

1457
01:34:44,514 --> 01:34:45,845
Make sure he stays down.

1458
01:34:46,914 --> 01:34:48,279
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1459
01:34:52,074 --> 01:34:54,395
Admiral Marcus, you're under arrest.

1460
01:34:54,554 --> 01:34:56,355
You're not actually
going to do this, are you?

1461
01:34:57,914 --> 01:35:00,155
Admiral, get out of the chair.

1462
01:35:00,314 --> 01:35:02,840
You better stop
and think about what you're doing, Kirk.

1463
01:35:02,954 --> 01:35:05,002
You better think about
what you did on Kronos.

1464
01:35:05,194 --> 01:35:07,720
You made an incursion
onto an enemy planet!

1465
01:35:08,074 --> 01:35:09,963
You killed a Klingon patrol.

1466
01:35:10,154 --> 01:35:13,317
Even if you got away without
a trace, war is coming.

1467
01:35:13,594 --> 01:35:16,916
And who is going to lead us? You?

1468
01:35:17,234 --> 01:35:18,804
If I'm not in charge,

1469
01:35:18,874 --> 01:35:21,605
our entire way of life is decimated!

1470
01:35:22,234 --> 01:35:24,760
So you want me off this ship,

1471
01:35:25,074 --> 01:35:27,441
you better kill me.

1472
01:35:27,594 --> 01:35:29,358
I'm not going to kill you, sir.

1473
01:35:30,514 --> 01:35:34,200
But I could stun your ass
and drag you out of that chair.

1474
01:35:34,434 --> 01:35:37,119
I'd rather not do that
in front of your daughter.

1475
01:35:40,874 --> 01:35:42,876
- You all right?
- Yes, Captain.

1476
01:35:45,394 --> 01:35:46,441
Jim!

1477
01:35:59,714 --> 01:36:01,478
Listen! Wait!

1478
01:36:13,194 --> 01:36:14,195
You...

1479
01:36:14,674 --> 01:36:18,121
You should have let me sleep.

1480
01:36:23,394 --> 01:36:24,634
Where is the Captain, Mr. Sulu?

1481
01:36:24,714 --> 01:36:27,081
Our sensor array's down, sir.
I can't find him.

1482
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:30,882
<i>I'm going to make this
very simple for you.</i>

1483
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:33,600
<i>- Captain.
- Your crew for my crew.</i>

1484
01:36:33,754 --> 01:36:34,915
You betrayed us.

1485
01:36:35,354 --> 01:36:37,163
<i>You are smart, Mr. Spock.</i>

1486
01:36:37,234 --> 01:36:38,679
<i>Spock don't...</i>

1487
01:36:41,074 --> 01:36:44,237
<i>Mr. Spock, give me my crew.</i>

1488
01:36:45,074 --> 01:36:46,678
And what will you do
when you get them?

1489
01:36:46,794 --> 01:36:49,274
<i>Continue the work we were doing
before we were banished.</i>

1490
01:36:49,394 --> 01:36:51,123
Which, as I understand it,
involves the mass genocide

1491
01:36:51,234 --> 01:36:54,283
of any being you find to be
less than superior.

1492
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,436
<i>Shall I destroy you, Mr. Spock?</i>

1493
01:36:56,754 --> 01:36:59,439
<i>Or will you give me what I want?</i>

1494
01:37:02,034 --> 01:37:03,877
We have no transporter capabilities.

1495
01:37:03,994 --> 01:37:05,917
<i>Fortunately mine are
perfectly functional.</i>

1496
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:08,196
<i>Drop your shields.</i>

1497
01:37:08,594 --> 01:37:10,244
If I do so, I have no guarantee

1498
01:37:10,314 --> 01:37:12,043
that you will not destroy the Enterprise.

1499
01:37:12,114 --> 01:37:14,640
Well, let's play this out
logically then, Mr. Spock.

1500
01:37:14,714 --> 01:37:16,364
Firstly, I will kill your Captain

1501
01:37:16,434 --> 01:37:18,084
to demonstrate my resolve.

1502
01:37:18,154 --> 01:37:21,044
Then if yours holds,
I will have no choice

1503
01:37:21,114 --> 01:37:23,685
but to kill you and your entire crew.

1504
01:37:23,834 --> 01:37:25,518
If you destroy our ship,

1505
01:37:25,594 --> 01:37:27,596
you will also destroy your own people.

1506
01:37:27,714 --> 01:37:30,558
Your crew requires oxygen
to survive, mine does not.

1507
01:37:30,634 --> 01:37:32,284
I will target your life support systems

1508
01:37:32,394 --> 01:37:34,556
located behind the aft nacelle.

1509
01:37:34,754 --> 01:37:37,917
And after every single person
aboard your ship suffocates,

1510
01:37:38,114 --> 01:37:42,597
I will walk over your cold
corpses to recover my people.

1511
01:37:45,154 --> 01:37:46,565
Now,

1512
01:37:47,314 --> 01:37:49,316
shall we begin?

1513
01:37:53,314 --> 01:37:54,679
Lower shields.

1514
01:37:58,594 --> 01:38:00,562
A wise choice, Mr. Spock.

1515
01:38:08,514 --> 01:38:11,279
I see your 72 torpedoes
are still in their tubes.

1516
01:38:11,674 --> 01:38:13,961
If they are not mine,
Commander, I will know it.

1517
01:38:14,274 --> 01:38:16,436
Vulcans do not lie.

1518
01:38:17,314 --> 01:38:19,476
The torpedoes are yours.

1519
01:38:30,314 --> 01:38:31,998
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

1520
01:38:32,314 --> 01:38:34,476
I have fulfilled your terms.

1521
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:36,200
Now fulfill mine.

1522
01:38:37,394 --> 01:38:39,317
Well, Kirk,

1523
01:38:39,594 --> 01:38:41,756
it seems apt to return you to your crew.

1524
01:38:42,554 --> 01:38:44,158
After all,

1525
01:38:46,994 --> 01:38:50,316
no ship should go down
without her captain.

1526
01:38:52,914 --> 01:38:54,359
He's locking phasers on us, sir!

1527
01:39:00,594 --> 01:39:01,675
Let us out of here now!

1528
01:39:10,954 --> 01:39:12,524
Shields at 6%!

1529
01:39:12,794 --> 01:39:14,762
The torpedoes!
How much time, Lieutenant?

1530
01:39:14,874 --> 01:39:15,875
Twelve seconds, sir!

1531
01:39:15,994 --> 01:39:17,041
<i>Crew of the Enterprise,</i>

1532
01:39:17,114 --> 01:39:18,754
prepare for imminent
proximity detonation.

1533
01:39:19,034 --> 01:39:20,877
What's he talking about?
What detonation?

1534
01:39:20,954 --> 01:39:23,036
The torpedoes.
He armed the damn torpedoes!

1535
01:39:33,234 --> 01:39:34,281
No!

1536
01:39:41,554 --> 01:39:43,155
Sir, their weapons
have been knocked out.

1537
01:39:44,234 --> 01:39:46,316
- Not bad, Commander.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

1538
01:39:46,674 --> 01:39:48,563
- Bones!
- Bones!

1539
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:50,762
- Nurse!
- I got you. I got you.

1540
01:39:50,874 --> 01:39:53,002
Dr. Marcus.

1541
01:39:54,554 --> 01:39:55,635
Good to see you, Jim.

1542
01:39:55,754 --> 01:39:57,324
You helped Spock
detonate those torpedoes?

1543
01:39:57,394 --> 01:39:58,395
Damn right I did.

1544
01:39:58,474 --> 01:39:59,999
He killed Khan's crew!

1545
01:40:00,074 --> 01:40:01,678
Spock's cold, but he's not that cold.

1546
01:40:02,074 --> 01:40:04,076
I've got Khan's crew.

1547
01:40:04,234 --> 01:40:06,396
Seventy-two human popsicles

1548
01:40:06,594 --> 01:40:09,074
safe and sound in their cryo tubes.

1549
01:40:09,914 --> 01:40:11,040
Son of a bitch!

1550
01:40:16,794 --> 01:40:18,603
Sir, the central power grid is failing!

1551
01:40:18,754 --> 01:40:21,917
- Switch to auxiliary power.
- Auxiliary power failing, sir.

1552
01:40:29,594 --> 01:40:31,474
Commander, our ship's
caught in Earth's gravity!

1553
01:40:31,834 --> 01:40:33,962
- Can we stop?
- I can't do anything.

1554
01:40:43,194 --> 01:40:44,958
Sorry! Oh, no.

1555
01:40:45,194 --> 01:40:46,320
Clear the area!

1556
01:40:47,034 --> 01:40:49,958
Engage emergency lockdown!
I hope you don't get seasick.

1557
01:40:50,114 --> 01:40:52,003
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1558
01:40:52,194 --> 01:40:53,795
Lieutenant, sound evacuation, all decks.

1559
01:40:53,834 --> 01:40:54,835
Aye, sir.

1560
01:40:55,994 --> 01:40:59,680
As acting Captain,
I order you to abandon this ship.

1561
01:41:00,954 --> 01:41:02,877
I will remain behind and divert all power

1562
01:41:03,034 --> 01:41:04,445
to life support
and evacuation shuttle bays.

1563
01:41:04,554 --> 01:41:06,204
<i>Evacuation protocols...</i>

1564
01:41:06,314 --> 01:41:08,794
I order you to abandon the ship!

1565
01:41:08,914 --> 01:41:12,043
All due respect, Commander,
but we're not going anywhere.

1566
01:41:16,074 --> 01:41:19,157
One day I've been off this ship!
One bloody day!

1567
01:41:23,194 --> 01:41:25,435
Gravity systems are failing.
Hold on! Hold on!

1568
01:41:29,114 --> 01:41:30,798
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1569
01:41:30,874 --> 01:41:32,364
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1570
01:41:33,514 --> 01:41:36,279
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1571
01:41:36,514 --> 01:41:37,754
There won't be time for evacuation

1572
01:41:37,874 --> 01:41:41,037
if we don't get power
to stabilize the damn ship!

1573
01:41:41,234 --> 01:41:43,714
- Can we restore it?
- Only from engineering.

1574
01:41:43,834 --> 01:41:46,360
We have to get back to the warp core.

1575
01:41:49,234 --> 01:41:50,565
Jim?

1576
01:41:51,514 --> 01:41:53,835
Scotty, we got to get
the power back on! Come on!

1577
01:42:11,714 --> 01:42:13,045
- Scotty, we got to jump!
- What?

1578
01:42:13,274 --> 01:42:14,560
Jump! Jump!

1579
01:42:14,674 --> 01:42:16,324
Oh, God.

1580
01:42:17,074 --> 01:42:19,554
Emergency power at 15% and dropping.

1581
01:42:19,674 --> 01:42:21,039
<i>Attention, all decks.</i>

1582
01:42:21,114 --> 01:42:23,594
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1583
01:42:23,674 --> 01:42:27,201
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1584
01:42:39,674 --> 01:42:41,244
- Jim?
- Hold on!

1585
01:42:41,434 --> 01:42:42,799
I can't.

1586
01:43:01,354 --> 01:43:02,844
I've got you, Captain!

1587
01:43:02,994 --> 01:43:04,678
- Chekov.
- Don't let go!

1588
01:43:15,754 --> 01:43:18,519
Even if we get the warp core online,
we've still got to redirect the power!

1589
01:43:18,594 --> 01:43:20,198
- He's right, Captain!
- What are you talking about?

1590
01:43:20,274 --> 01:43:22,356
Someone has to hit
the manual override.

1591
01:43:22,434 --> 01:43:23,674
Laddie, there's a switch...

1592
01:43:23,794 --> 01:43:26,035
Behind the deflector dish!
I'll flip the switch!

1593
01:43:26,114 --> 01:43:27,525
Let's go!

1594
01:43:30,474 --> 01:43:31,475
Oh, no.

1595
01:43:42,834 --> 01:43:45,599
<i>Evacuation protocols initiated.</i>

1596
01:43:45,674 --> 01:43:48,405
<i>Proceed to exit bays
and report to your assigned shuttle.</i>

1597
01:43:50,274 --> 01:43:52,163
Mr. Sulu, divert
any remaining power to stabilizers.

1598
01:43:52,234 --> 01:43:54,077
Doing what I can, sir. Doing what I can.

1599
01:44:10,434 --> 01:44:13,438
<i>Core misaligned. Danger.</i>

1600
01:44:13,514 --> 01:44:15,198
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- What?

1601
01:44:15,274 --> 01:44:16,560
The housings are misaligned!

1602
01:44:16,634 --> 01:44:18,557
There's no way
we can redirect the power!

1603
01:44:18,634 --> 01:44:21,638
The ship's dead, sir. She's gone.

1604
01:44:23,034 --> 01:44:24,957
- No, she's not.
- Wait, Jim!

1605
01:44:25,074 --> 01:44:27,600
If we go in there, we'll die!

1606
01:44:27,674 --> 01:44:29,676
Do you hear me?
The radiation will kill us!

1607
01:44:29,954 --> 01:44:32,241
Will you listen to me?
What the hell are you doing?

1608
01:44:32,314 --> 01:44:33,475
I'm opening the door. I'm going in.

1609
01:44:33,554 --> 01:44:35,761
That door is there to stop us
from getting irradiated!

1610
01:44:35,834 --> 01:44:38,155
We'd be dead
before we made the climb!

1611
01:44:40,554 --> 01:44:41,840
You're not making the climb.

1612
01:44:43,074 --> 01:44:48,638
<i>Danger. Core misaligned.</i>

1613
01:45:47,794 --> 01:45:49,762
If we don't get power
or shields back online,

1614
01:45:49,834 --> 01:45:52,485
we're gonna be incinerated on re-entry!

1615
01:46:59,194 --> 01:47:00,275
Warp core is back online!

1616
01:47:00,474 --> 01:47:01,999
Maximum thrusters, Mr. Sulu!

1617
01:47:07,114 --> 01:47:09,401
Thrusters at maximum!
Stand by! Stand by!

1618
01:47:36,874 --> 01:47:39,036
- Shields restored!
- Commander, power online.

1619
01:47:39,314 --> 01:47:41,316
Mr. Spock, altitude stabilizing.

1620
01:47:41,674 --> 01:47:43,483
It's a miracle.

1621
01:47:45,234 --> 01:47:47,236
There are no such things.

1622
01:47:49,674 --> 01:47:51,085
<i>Engineering to bridge.</i>

1623
01:47:51,154 --> 01:47:52,440
<i>- Mr. Spock!</i>
- Mr. Scott.

1624
01:47:52,514 --> 01:47:55,438
<i>Sir, you'd better get down here.</i>

1625
01:47:55,514 --> 01:47:56,845
<i>Better hurry.</i>

1626
01:48:19,514 --> 01:48:20,595
Open it.

1627
01:48:20,754 --> 01:48:22,483
The decontamination process
is not complete.

1628
01:48:22,634 --> 01:48:23,760
You'd flood the whole compartment.

1629
01:48:23,874 --> 01:48:25,922
The door's locked, sir.

1630
01:48:55,394 --> 01:48:56,441
How's our ship?

1631
01:48:58,234 --> 01:48:59,759
Out of danger.

1632
01:49:02,234 --> 01:49:04,441
You saved the crew.

1633
01:49:05,914 --> 01:49:08,758
You used what he wanted against him.

1634
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:14,563
That's a nice move.

1635
01:49:16,234 --> 01:49:18,282
It is what you would have done.

1636
01:49:19,994 --> 01:49:21,280
And this,

1637
01:49:22,914 --> 01:49:24,916
this is what you would have done.

1638
01:49:25,274 --> 01:49:27,436
It was only logical.

1639
01:49:33,754 --> 01:49:35,483
I'm scared, Spock.

1640
01:49:39,194 --> 01:49:40,958
Help me not be.

1641
01:49:45,354 --> 01:49:47,721
How do you choose not to feel?

1642
01:49:54,474 --> 01:49:56,124
I do not know.

1643
01:49:58,794 --> 01:50:00,842
Right now I am failing.

1644
01:50:07,554 --> 01:50:10,637
I want you to know
why I couldn't let you die.

1645
01:50:14,794 --> 01:50:16,558
Why I went back for you.

1646
01:50:18,474 --> 01:50:20,920
Because you are my friend.

1647
01:51:44,274 --> 01:51:47,323
Khan!

1648
01:51:49,914 --> 01:51:51,245
God, that was close!

1649
01:51:54,594 --> 01:51:58,804
Set destination, Starfleet Headquarters!

1650
01:51:58,954 --> 01:52:00,194
<i>Engines compromised.</i>

1651
01:52:00,274 --> 01:52:02,356
<i>Cannot guarantee destination.</i>

1652
01:52:02,434 --> 01:52:03,799
<i>Confirm order.</i>

1653
01:52:04,154 --> 01:52:05,440
Confirm.

1654
01:53:09,834 --> 01:53:12,041
Search the enemy ship for signs of life.

1655
01:53:12,314 --> 01:53:14,203
Sir, there's no way anyone survived.

1656
01:53:15,514 --> 01:53:16,675
He could.

1657
01:53:17,354 --> 01:53:18,515
Yes, sir.

1658
01:53:50,234 --> 01:53:51,884
Whoa! He just jumped 30 meters!

1659
01:53:52,034 --> 01:53:53,160
Can we beam him up?

1660
01:53:53,234 --> 01:53:54,281
There's too much damage.

1661
01:53:54,394 --> 01:53:55,759
I have no incoming signal.

1662
01:53:55,914 --> 01:53:58,758
But it may be possible
to beam you down, sir.

1663
01:53:59,234 --> 01:54:00,520
Go get him.

1664
01:54:05,634 --> 01:54:08,205
- Stand by for coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

1665
01:54:08,554 --> 01:54:11,034
Enter 3517 by 2598.

1666
01:54:11,154 --> 01:54:12,963
Coordinates confirmed.

1667
01:55:51,114 --> 01:55:52,957
Get me a cryo tube, now!

1668
01:56:48,754 --> 01:56:50,279
Get this guy out of the cryo tube.

1669
01:56:50,434 --> 01:56:51,720
Keep him in an induced coma.

1670
01:56:51,794 --> 01:56:53,239
We're gonna put Kirk inside.

1671
01:56:53,354 --> 01:56:55,038
It's our only chance to
preserve his brain function.

1672
01:56:55,114 --> 01:56:56,957
How much of Khan's blood is left?

1673
01:56:57,074 --> 01:56:58,075
None.

1674
01:56:58,954 --> 01:57:02,003
<i>Enterprise to Spock. Spoon!</i>

1675
01:58:02,914 --> 01:58:05,076
Activate the cryogenic sequence.

1676
01:58:07,074 --> 01:58:08,564
McCoy to bridge.

1677
01:58:09,154 --> 01:58:11,600
I can't reach Spock. I need Khan alive.

1678
01:58:11,674 --> 01:58:14,837
You get that son of a bitch
back on board right now!

1679
01:58:15,754 --> 01:58:17,358
I think he can save Kirk.

1680
01:58:17,474 --> 01:58:18,680
Can we beam them up to the ship?

1681
01:58:18,754 --> 01:58:21,155
They keep moving! I can't
get a lock on either of them.

1682
01:58:21,274 --> 01:58:22,605
Can you beam someone down?

1683
01:58:57,554 --> 01:58:58,555
Spock!

1684
01:59:06,114 --> 01:59:07,161
Spock!

1685
01:59:07,394 --> 01:59:09,237
Spock, stop! Stop!

1686
01:59:09,834 --> 01:59:12,075
He's our only chance to save Kirk!

1687
01:59:21,794 --> 01:59:24,115
<i>- What is it?
- It's a boy.</i>

1688
01:59:24,434 --> 01:59:25,435
<i>Let's call him Jim.</i>

1689
01:59:25,554 --> 01:59:27,875
<i>Your father was
captain of a star-ship for 12 minutes.</i>

1690
01:59:27,954 --> 01:59:31,879
<i>He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.</i>

1691
01:59:41,034 --> 01:59:44,038
Don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1692
01:59:44,114 --> 01:59:46,720
It was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1693
01:59:46,914 --> 01:59:47,881
You were out cold for two weeks.

1694
01:59:47,954 --> 01:59:48,955
Transfusion?

1695
01:59:49,074 --> 01:59:51,805
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1696
01:59:52,594 --> 01:59:53,800
Khan?

1697
01:59:53,914 --> 01:59:55,120
Once we caught him,

1698
01:59:55,234 --> 01:59:57,840
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1699
01:59:57,954 --> 02:00:00,480
Tell me, are you feeling homicidal?

1700
02:00:00,594 --> 02:00:02,119
Power mad? Despotic?

1701
02:00:02,314 --> 02:00:03,998
No more than usual.

1702
02:00:04,434 --> 02:00:05,595
How'd you catch him?

1703
02:00:05,994 --> 02:00:07,325
I didn't.

1704
02:00:16,154 --> 02:00:17,804
You saved my life.

1705
02:00:17,954 --> 02:00:20,480
Uhura and I had
something to do with it, too, you know.

1706
02:00:22,034 --> 02:00:24,321
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1707
02:00:24,794 --> 02:00:26,125
Spock, just...

1708
02:00:27,794 --> 02:00:29,125
Thank you.

1709
02:00:30,474 --> 02:00:32,636
You are welcome, Jim.

1710
02:00:43,474 --> 02:00:46,876
<i>There will always be
those who mean to do us harm.</i>

1711
02:00:48,834 --> 02:00:50,199
<i>To stop them,</i>

1712
02:00:50,834 --> 02:00:54,725
<i>we risk awakening
the same evil within ourselves.</i>

1713
02:01:00,714 --> 02:01:03,285
<i>Our first instinct is to seek revenge</i>

1714
02:01:03,394 --> 02:01:05,715
<i>when those we love are taken from us.</i>

1715
02:01:08,794 --> 02:01:10,558
<i>But that's not who we are.</i>

1716
02:01:12,074 --> 02:01:13,724
<i>We are here today</i>

1717
02:01:13,834 --> 02:01:16,724
<i>to rechristen the U.S.S. Enterprise,</i>

1718
02:01:16,834 --> 02:01:19,678
<i>and to honor those who lost their lives</i>

1719
02:01:20,674 --> 02:01:22,358
<i>nearly one year ago.</i>

1720
02:01:22,834 --> 02:01:24,996
<i>When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship</i>

1721
02:01:25,074 --> 02:01:27,520
<i>he had me recite the Captain's Oath,</i>

1722
02:01:28,394 --> 02:01:31,238
<i>words I didn't appreciate at the time.</i>

1723
02:01:31,914 --> 02:01:34,963
<i>Now I see them as a call
for us to remember</i>

1724
02:01:35,794 --> 02:01:37,637
<i>who we once were,</i>

1725
02:01:39,554 --> 02:01:41,921
<i>and who we must be again.</i>

1726
02:01:43,194 --> 02:01:44,719
<i>And those words?</i>

1727
02:01:45,394 --> 02:01:48,443
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

1728
02:01:48,874 --> 02:01:52,595
<i>These are the voyages
of the star-ship Enterprise.</i>

1729
02:01:53,434 --> 02:01:55,323
<i>Her five-year mission,</i>

1730
02:01:55,394 --> 02:01:57,283
<i>to explore strange new worlds,</i>

1731
02:01:57,914 --> 02:02:01,441
<i>to seek out new life
and new civilizations,</i>

1732
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:05,914
<i>to boldly go
where no one has gone before.</i>

1733
02:02:08,914 --> 02:02:10,803
Captain on the bridge.

1734
02:02:13,914 --> 02:02:16,235
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1735
02:02:16,314 --> 02:02:17,839
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1736
02:02:17,914 --> 02:02:20,201
"Captain" does have a nice ring to it.

1737
02:02:20,274 --> 02:02:21,764
Chair's all yours, sir.

1738
02:02:23,594 --> 02:02:25,084
Mr. Scott.

1739
02:02:25,234 --> 02:02:26,201
<i>How's our core?</i>

1740
02:02:26,274 --> 02:02:27,924
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1741
02:02:27,994 --> 02:02:30,315
She's ready for a long journey.

1742
02:02:30,394 --> 02:02:31,555
<i>Excellent.</i>

1743
02:02:31,674 --> 02:02:34,200
Come on, Bones! It's gonna be fun.

1744
02:02:35,434 --> 02:02:38,677
Five years in space. God help me.

1745
02:02:38,914 --> 02:02:40,359
Dr. Marcus.

1746
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:43,597
I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1747
02:02:44,074 --> 02:02:45,838
It's nice to have a family.

1748
02:02:48,154 --> 02:02:49,360
Spock.

1749
02:02:49,474 --> 02:02:50,635
Captain.

1750
02:02:53,594 --> 02:02:55,119
Where shall we go?

1751
02:02:56,434 --> 02:02:59,643
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1752
02:03:01,634 --> 02:03:04,114
I defer to your good judgment, Captain.

1753
02:03:13,114 --> 02:03:15,685
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1754
02:03:15,794 --> 02:03:17,319
Aye, Captain.
