For her eyes only.

365
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,114
She's ready for you.

366
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,700
I'm sorry, have we met before?

367
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,619
I'm the one who
should say "sorry".

368
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,707
lt was only four ribs.

369
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,209
Some of the less vital organs.

370
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,421
Nothing major.

371
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,386
Not enough
excitement in Istanbul?

372
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,138
I've been reassigned.

373
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,306
Temporary suspension
from field work.

374
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,891
Really?
Mmm.

375
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,643
Something to do
with killing 007.

376
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,770
Well, you gave it
your best shot.

377
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,647
That was hardly my best shot.

378
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,066
I'm not sure I
could survive your best.

379
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,985
I doubt you'll get the chance.

380
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,405
Well, do me a favor, will you?
If they do ever let
you back out there,

381
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,158
warn me first.

382
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,494
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition,

383
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,496
and then I'll be
back in the field.

384
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,331
That's what you want?

385
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,916
Yes, of course.

386
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,668
It's not for everyone.

387
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,087
Ah, 007. It's this way.

388
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:55,593
ln your defense,
a moving target is
much harder to hit.

389
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,263
Then you better keep moving.

390
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,692
The whole office
goes up in smoke

391
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,569
and that bloody
thing survives.

392
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,573

have always been appreciated,
007.

393

394
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,453

missed anything.

398
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,423
I've just been
reviewing Bond's tests.

399

lt seems you've passed. . .
by the skin of your teeth.

400
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,262
You're back on active service.

401
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:42,348
Congratulations.

402
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,599
Thank you.

403
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,434
I'll, um. . .

404
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,644
I'll be outside.

405
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,979
I only have one question.

406
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,565
Why not stay dead?

407
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,278
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.

408
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,657
Not many field
agents get to leave
this cleanly.

409
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,450
Do you get out
in the field much?

410
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:06,163
You don't need
to be an operative
to see the obvious.

411
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,791
It's a young man's game.

412
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,585
Look, you've been
seriously injured.

413
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,004
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

414
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,091
The only shame would
be not admitting it
until it's too late.

415
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,178
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

416
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,265
If he says he's ready,
he's ready.

417
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,852
Perhaps you can't see it,
or maybe you won't.

418
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,645
What exactly are you implying?

419
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,647
You're sentimental about him.

420
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,819
As long as I'm head
of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.

421
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,865
Fair enough.

422
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,037
Good luck, 007.

423
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,874
Don't cock it up.

424
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,716
We've analyzed
the shrapnel fragments.

425
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,093
You're lucky it
wasn't a direct hit

426
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,553
or it would have
cut you in half.

427
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,973
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

428
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,018
Hard to get,
extremely expensive,

429
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,812
and only used by a select few.

430
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,148
Recognize anyone?

431
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,067
Him.

432
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,487
TANNER: Okay. Name's Patrice.

433
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,032
He's a ghost.
No known residence
or country of origin.

434
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,742
So how do we find him?

435
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,078
Well, luckily, we still have
one or two
friends left in the CIA.

436
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,997
They're after him for
the Yemeni ambassador's
murder,

437
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,874
and they're getting close.

438
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,001

going to be in Shanghai

439
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,920
in two days time,
probably on a job.

440
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,672
You're to go there
and await
further instructions.

441
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,758
If he turns up, he's yours.

442
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,219
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.

443
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,388
Then terminate him,
for Ronson.

444
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,015

446

No.

the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.

448
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,902
He hasn't set up
shop yet, but Tanner will

449

put you two together.
Good luck.

Yes, ma'am.

454
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,548

passed the tests.

I'm your new Quartermaster.

You must be joking.

467
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,821
Why, because I'm not
wearing a lab coat?

468
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,948
Because you still have spots.

469
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,784
My complexion is
hardly relevant.

470
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,870
Well, your competence is.

471
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,664
Age is no
guarantee of efficiency.

472
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,542

00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,617
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

542
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,288

543
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,624
. . .already
briefed me on the list.

544
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,961

the tantalizing question

545
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,130
of what you're
really doing here.

546
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,884
My official
directive was to help. . .

547
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,637
"in any way I can."

548
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,808
Like spying for Mallory.

549
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,479
You know, Mallory's not as bad
as you think.

550
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,482
He's a bureaucrat.

551
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,277
You should do your homework.

552
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,447
Gareth Mallory was
a Lieutenant Colonel. . .

553
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,283
Lieutenant Colonel
in Northern Ireland,
Hereford Regiment.

554
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,869
Spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

555
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,037
(CHUCKLES)

556
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,332
So there's more to
him than meets the eye.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

558
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,336
We'll see.

559
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,672
Keep still.

560
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,177
This is the tricky part.

561
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,690
Now that's better.

562
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,068

563
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,195
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

564
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,490
And what part's that?

565
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,035
Old dog,

566
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,038

567
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,445
Good evening.

568
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,988
EVE: Evening.

569
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,948
Don't touch your ear.

570
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,285
I've got three exits,

571
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:15,121
lots of blind spots.

572
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,290
EVE: I've got them covered.

573
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,631
You look
beautiful in that dress.

574
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,425
You don't scrub
up so bad yourself.

575
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,470
It's amazing what one can do
with an extra pair of hands.

576
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,638
You're telling me.

577
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,017
Do you gamble?

578
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,852

flutter now and then.

to take chances?

580

Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

581
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,492
I'd like to cash
this in, please.

582
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,500
One moment, sir.

583
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,534
Good fortune tonight, sir.

584
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,208
Let's hope so.

585
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,885
With compliments
of the house.

586
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,720
Thank you.

587
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,411
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink.

588
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,915
Maybe I'll even
stretch to two.

589
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:26,586
I'm guessing I've
got four million euros
in here.

590
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,547
Not bad. I like this game.

591
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,799
Why don't we play another?

592
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,927
I don't gamble.

593
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,932
I'm not very lucky.

594
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,268
A little like our
friend in Shanghai.

595
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,609
I've been waiting to see
who would redeem the chip.

596
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:53,487
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

597
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,907
Did I over-complicate
the plot?

598

So, Mr. Bond, shall we
discuss your next
performance over that drink?

Would you mind
if I asked you
a business question?

614
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,674
Depends on the question.

A subject in which
you're well-versed.

617
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,183
And how would you know that?

618
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,396
Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress

619
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,732
with a Beretta 70
strapped to her thigh.

620

too careful when

621

tuxedos carry Walthers.

622
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,244
I am correct in
assuming you killed Patrice?

623
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,705
Yes.

624
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,250
Might I ask why?

625
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,253

627
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,187
You're scared.

But ever since we sat down,
you haven't stopped

632

633
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,630
Now, three of them
is a bit excessive.

634

They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.

635

is Macau sex trade.

was your way out.

thought you were in love.

and pretending not to be.

know about fear?

surrounding the Ministry
of Defence has escalated today

But I didn't die.

896
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,915
Life clung to me
like a disease.

897
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,587
And then. . .

898
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:33,591
I understood why
I had survived.

899
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:39,764
I needed to look in
your eyes one last time.

900
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,769
Well, I hope it was worth it.

901
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,775
Mr. Silva, you're
going to be transferred
to Belmarsh Prison

902
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,778
where you'll be
remanded in custody

903
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,613
until the Crown
Prosecution Service

904
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,490
deem you fit to
stand trial for. . .

905
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,784
Say my name. Say it.

906
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,953
My real name.

907
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,497
I know you remember it.

908
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,959
Your name is on
the memorial wall

909
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,128
of the very
building you attacked.

910
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,630
I will have it struck off.

911
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:17,552
Soon your past
will be as nonexistent
as your future.

912
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,471
I'll never see you again.

913
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,309
Do you know what
it does to you?

914
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,731
Hydrogen cyanide?

915
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,829
Look upon your work,

916
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,165

919
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,789
Let me know what you recover
from his computer.

920
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:31,375
Has he transmitted the lists?
If so, to whom?
I want this resolved.

921
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,543
Yes, ma'am.

922
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,385
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

923
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,554
He was a brilliant agent.

924
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,725
But he started
operating beyond his brief,
hacking the Chinese.

925
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:52,480
The handover was coming up
and they were onto him,
so I gave him up.

926
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:55,733
I got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.

927
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:58,986
We should go, ma'am.
Board of Inquiry
begins in 30 minutes.

928
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,489
I want to know
what's on that computer.

929
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,796
Now, looking at
Silva's computer,

930
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:21,217
it seems to me he's done
a number of
slightly unusual things.

931
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:24,303
He's established
failsafe protocols
to wipe the memory

932
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,973
if there's any
attempt to access
certain files.

933
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,518
Only six people in the world
could program
safeguards like that.

934
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,645
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

935
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,981
I invented them.

936
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,485
Right, then.

937
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,990
Let's see what you've
got for us, Mr. Silva.

938
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,785
We're in.

01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,752
Sir, what do you make of this?

941
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:03,593
It's his Omega site.

942
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,304
Most encrypted level he has.

943
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,976
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.

944
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:15,438
Security through obscurity.

945
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order?

946
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:22,653
I'd like to begin
the proceedings.

We're gathered today
to address important issues

948

of our national security.

(GROANS LOUDLY)

950
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,835
Going somewhere?

951
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,549
So you believe your
stewardship of Ml6
during the recent crisis

952
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,009
has been up to scratch?

953
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:48,471
Well,
I believe we have apprehended
the responsible party

954
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,348
and are taking
all necessary steps

955
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:53,184
to ensure that
the sensitive information
is contained.

956
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,560
Oh,

957
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,312
so it's a job well done.

958
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,147
I'm not saying
it's gone perfectly, but. . .

959
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,942
You'll forgive me
for not putting
up the bunting.

960
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,319
I find it rather difficult
to overlook monumental

and dead operatives

962
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,282
for which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.

963
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,663
He's using
a polymorphic engine
to mutate the code.

964
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,998
Whenever I try to
gain access, it changes.

965
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,210
It's like
solving a Rubik's cube
that's fighting back.

966
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,384
Stop.

967
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,512

It's an old Tube station
on the Metropolitan Line.

you should be in the Tube.

This was years
in the planning.

capture him, he wanted us
to access his computer.

It's what he's got
planned next that worries me.
