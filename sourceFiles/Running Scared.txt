1
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:08,617
Come on!
Come on, kid!

2
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:10,219
The fuck?!

3
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:12,887
Look at me.
Fuck!

4
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:16,358
Come on, Oleg,
stay with me.

5
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:18,560
Come on. Come on!

6
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,834
Come on, kid.
We're gonna make it.

7
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:27,102
We're gonna crash!

8
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,093
Yeah, mon.

9
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,329
Sweet like cola wine.

10
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:57,666
Come on, we count
the hundreds only.

11
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:01,170
Jeez.

12
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,742
Why don't
they finish it?

13
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:15,850
We're good.

14
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,124
What you have there?

15
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:26,562
It's all looking
very good.

16
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,297
Nobody fucking move!

17
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:29,298
Eat the floor,
fucker!

18
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:30,299
Down on the ground!

19
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:31,300
Get down!

20
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,301
Now, you cocksuckers!

21
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:33,569
You heard him!
Get down!

22
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,470
You're makin' the biggest
fuckin' mistake--

23
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:36,672
Ohh!
Shut up!

24
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,507
Down, motherfuckers, down!

25
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,975
Everybody,
eat the fuckin' floor!

26
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,177
Fucker!

27
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,646
Now, very fuckin' carefully,

28
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,215
reach into your jackets

29
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:47,982
and take out
whatever you're packin'

30
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,784
and slide it
under the bed!

31
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:50,785
Fuck you.

32
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:51,953
Come on, all of you!

33
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,855
Move it! Come on, fuckheads!

34
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,092
Keep it moving! Now!

35
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,428
You better spend it
real quick, shitbags.

36
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,597
You ain't long
for this fuckin' world.

37
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:04,499
Yeah, right. I'll be sure
to have a Mai Tai on you.

38
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:05,767
Ohh!

39
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:08,704
All of you goombah fucks.

40
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,139
Come on. I'll have one
on you, too.

41
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,341
Go, go! Come on!

42
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:13,609
Come on!
Move, move, move!

43
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,710
Hurry!
Fuckin' move!

44
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,877
Get going!
Move!

45
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,247
Let's go, let's go,
let's go! Come on!

46
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:21,516
Come on! Now!

47
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,685
Aah!

48
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,554
Aah!

49
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,888
Motherfucker!

50
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:33,895
Aaaaah!

51
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,132
Aaaah!

52
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,133
No, man.

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,301
Ohh!

54
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,571
You fuckers!
You motherfuckers!

55
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,006
We don't give a fuck
about these niggers.

56
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:47,476
Now, you spill
Perello blood,

57
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,911
you're deep-six invested.
Walk clean.

58
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,980
Piss on Perello blood!
Fuck him!

59
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:54,383
Aah! Ohh!

60
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,617
Oh, shit!

61
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,786
God damn it!

62
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:00,756
I don't think so.

63
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,056
Uhh!

64
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,725
Aah!
Son of a bitch!

65
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,427
Motherfucker!

66
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,472
Oh, fuck!

67
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:19,541
Come on!

68
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,510
Get up, you fuck!

69
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:22,844
Come on!

70
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,362
Aah!

71
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:42,631
Ohh!

72
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,033
Guys, let's blow
this cunt!

73
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,702
What a fuckin' pussy!

74
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,137
What? Where you goin',
you fuck?

75
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,105
We can work this out!
Let's talk!

76
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:53,274
Fuck you!

77
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:55,577
Uhh! Aah!

78
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,879
Shut the fuck up!

79
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,751
Where the fuck
you reachin'? Huh?

80
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,953
Please--
tell you what...

81
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,456
Have a Mai Tai
on me, huh?

82
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:15,497
Fuck me.
He's a cop.

83
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,033
A fuckin' cop?!

84
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,869
Motherfucker!

85
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:23,572
Get the shit,
and let's go! Now!

86
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,806
Hurry the fuck up!

87
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,798
Fuckin' dirty mooks.

88
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,099
Cocksuckers!

89
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,566
Is there one fuckin'
honest cop

90
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,435
in this
fuckin' city, huh?

91
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,937
Joey.

92
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,973
Give me your gat.

93
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,944
Take this shit
and get rid of it.

94
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,146
And do me a favor--
don't fuck it up.

95
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,351
No!

96
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,093
Give, loser punk!

97
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,662
Never...dickwad!

98
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,665
Uhh.

99
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,868
Oh, sorry.
You ok?

100
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,839
Oh, shit.

101
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,274
I didn't mean to do that.

102
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,530
Call now.

103
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,633
Hey, boss.

104
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,036
What are you
doing there?

105
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,704
Whacking off to
the E! Channel again?

106
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,373
Huh?

107
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,315
Whew.

108
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,472
I just want to smell you.
Stay just like that.

109
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,341
You didn't call,
you son of a bitch.

110
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,610
Mmm.

111
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,161
Let me guess.

112
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,595
Those are my pearls
you've been promising?

113
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,531
No. No, it's nothing.

114
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:47,698
It's just
a little recycling.

115
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,101
Joey, come on.
You are looking for trouble,

116
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,769
'cause if Tommy ever
found out about that--

117
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,538
shh. Just remember,

118
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,540
it's just our little
insurance policy, all right?

119
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:56,841
'Cause there's
no way in hell

120
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,043
I'm gonna be thinkin'

121
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,211
about gettin'
some of this right here

122
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,746
lookin' at you through
some glass window.

123
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,848
There's no fucking way.

124
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,791
Ohh.

125
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:37,615
No, Joey, come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

126
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,084
No. No!

127
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,286
Come on, baby.
Baby, look. Look at me.

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,587
What?
Nicky's around.

129
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,788
No, Nicky's busy.

130
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,190
Come on, I'll be quick
and real quiet. Come on.

131
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,825
Quiet? I don't think so.
Quick, I can believe.

132
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:49,627
You know somethin',
Mrs. G?

133
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,662
What?
You're bad.

134
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,599
Ha ha! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Sure.

135
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,234
I got a rep.

136
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,402
Yeah?
You got a rep.

137
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,536
Yeah, some things--

138
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,804
you got
a crazy rep.

139
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,908
Teresa likes to make it
on washing machines.

140
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,144
On select occasions,
yeah.

141
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,445
Uhh!
Ohh.

142
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:09,647
Oh, no, no.
What?

143
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,849
My sauce!
My sauce is bubbling!

144
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,051
Wait, that's how
I like it!

145
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,752
Yeah.

146
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,354
Aw, fuck!
Come on!

147
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,956
Hey! You use
language like that,

148
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,726
you ain't gettin'
no after-dinner dessert.

149
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,029
Go find Nicky.

150
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,064
I think he's up in
the bedroom with Oleg.

151
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,732
Why's he always
with that russkie kid?

152
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,234
Don't he have
no other friends?

153
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,469
Joey, you know,
they get along.

154
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,438
It's fine.
What do you want?

155
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,273
I don't want him
going over there no more,

156
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,508
that's what I want.

157
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:37,875
I know. He knows.

158
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,344
Mmm.

159
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,811
He knows.

160
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,051
I'll go get him.
Mm-hmm.

161
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,725
Yo, Nick.

162
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,261
Dinner.

163
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,239
Oh, shit.

164
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:12,276
Come on.

165
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:15,980
Get down.

166
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,669
Ahem. Dinner.

167
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,405
Can Oleg stay?

168
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,440
Babe, it's already been
3 times this week.

169
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,108
I'm sure his mom would
like to have him home

170
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,143
for a change.

171
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,478
It's ok.

172
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,146
I'm not even hungry.

173
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,481
I'll see you
tomorrow.

174
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,183
Go razors.

175
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,417
You, go wash up.

176
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,352
Those hands
are scary.

177
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,289
Good night, Oleg.

178
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,957
Good night,
Mrs. Gazelle.

179
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:39,730
He's not even up there.

180
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:41,832
They turned the damn basement
into a sports complex again.

181
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,033
Well...

182
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,735
Come on, T, how many times
am I supposed to tell him?

183
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,537
Joe, what do you want?
They're just boys.

184
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,738
They--

185
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,050
Dad, I won't do it
again, I swear.

186
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,919
Don't you expect me
to make book on that.

187
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,221
Now go get
your grandfather.

188
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:05,022
I just washed my hands.

189
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,559
All right.

190
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,700
Hey, Nick.

191
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:19,704
Razors and blues
Friday night?

192
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,038
120 Yellow, pal.

193
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,541
No way!

194
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,376
It's gonna be
a total deathmatch

195
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,677
between Chester
and Erlich.

196
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,412
They're going home
in body bags!

197
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,580
Red ice!

198
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,350
Hey, um...
Can Oleg come?

199
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,017
He's never been
to one game, and--

200
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,486
no. No, not this time.

201
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,154
Sal can only score me
a pair of tickets.

202
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,956
Maybe next time, though.

203
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:42,860
Go get your
grandfather.

204
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,044
Get up.

205
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:01,312
Get up.

206
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,916
Uhh.

207
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,684
Come on.

208
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,787
Come on, man.

209
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,388
Make it different
this time.

210
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,828
Get up.

211
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,265
Get up.

212
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,674
I said, get up!

213
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:31,776
What is this?

214
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,878
Wolfgang puck.
It's your favorite.

215
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,280
It's thick-crust...

216
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,248
<i>You damn Blyad.</i>

217
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,117
I cut off crust for you.

218
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,652
It'll be better.

219
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,357
Bring me
another Moskova.

220
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,233
Hey.

221
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,036
Hey.

222
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,106
Come here.

223
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,843
Come here.

224
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,279
Come.

225
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,951
Watch this.

226
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,254
<i>John Wayne
in the cowboys.</i>

227
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,024
I don't like cowboys.

228
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:22,026
Come on.

229
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,028
It's the Duke.

230
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,330
Come. Sit.

231
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,844
When I was growing up
in Kishinev,

232
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,047
we had no VHS,
no DVD back then.

233
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:46,216
I remember...

234
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:49,787
I did a job for
this friend of my father.

235
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,157
I pickpocketed a key
off this apparatchik.

236
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:56,594
The man gave me
as a reward

237
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,964
this children's
projector.

238
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,333
It came with 3 films--

239
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:06,037
<i>Speedy Gonzales,
Tarzan of the apes,</i>

240
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:08,338
<i>and John Wayne
in the cowboys.</i>

241
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,275
I watched that thing...

242
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:14,045
A thousand times.

243
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:17,682
Anzor,
it's getting cold.

244
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:27,725
I was 9 years old.

245
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,828
I didn't know how long
movies were supposed to be.

246
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,697
<i>My version
of the cowboys,</i>

247
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,865
it was only
10 minutes long.

248
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:38,936
No John Wayne
getting shot.

249
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:43,173
Because it was for kids,
they left that part out.

250
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,976
I didn't know this...

251
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,680
Until I arrive
in America

252
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:54,885
and see it on TV
for the first time.

253
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,353
I hate it.

254
00:15:56,421 --> 00:16:01,291
I want
my 8-millimeter back.

255
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:05,129
Because on that one,
the Duke lives.

256
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:10,400
Some things were better
in the old place.

257
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:11,869
Not too many.

258
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,505
Some things.

259
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:18,042
Let me show you
from the beginning.

260
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,448
Oh, no, no, no, no.

261
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,951
Oh, go forward.

262
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,219
This part's better.

263
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,691
Without the Duke?

264
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,333
Where are you going?!

265
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:45,736
You don't walk out
on the Duke!

266
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:55,179
She said
he's always distracted

267
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:56,613
and he never finishes
his work,

268
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,316
and she wants
to get him tested.

269
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,052
Wait, she wants
to get him tested?

270
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,519
Tested for what?

271
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,354
I think maybe, uh,

272
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,223
attention disorder
or something.

273
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,591
I'm not
fucking a.D.D.

274
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,161
Hey! You don't use that word
in front of your mother.

275
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,328
What's wrong
with "A.D.D."?

276
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:14,198
The other one,
smart-ass!

277
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:15,833
And he don't use
that word, period!

278
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,401
I don't want to be
on medication.

279
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:18,803
You can't make me take it,
'cause I won't.

280
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,637
No, no, Nick. You know what?
Don't even worry about.

281
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,974
There's no way in hell anybody's
gonna put you on meds, ok?

282
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,275
T, why don't you tell
that teacher

283
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:27,211
to come down to the rink
and watch him wax that puck?

284
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:28,846
That's perfect concentration
every time.

285
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,380
That's different, Joe.

286
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,950
We're just--we're just
trying to find out

287
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,151
what's going on
with you.

288
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,020
Ok? Buddy, she said
some great things, too.

289
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,588
She said--she said
that he's very bright.

290
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,656
She said
he's very creative.

291
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,459
You left that part out before.
I like that part.

292
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,628
I got potential.

293
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,309
What are you doing?

294
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,812
You takin' a collection
down there?

295
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,304
He must eat.

296
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,342
The little prick...

297
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,879
Insults the Duke.

298
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,549
He don't eat
in this house.

299
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:45,455
You hear me,
you little snotface?!

300
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:47,391
Stay in your room!

301
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,960
Jerk off to
your fucking razors!

302
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,196
Faggot!

303
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,999
He's a growing boy.

304
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,813
Uhh!

305
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,849
<i>What did I
fucking say, Suka?</i>

306
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,318
He has to eat, anzor.

307
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:15,686
Please.

308
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,422
Who puts food
on this fucking table?

309
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:19,456
Uhh!

310
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,728
<i>Not you, Blyad.</i>

311
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,797
I'm the big man
of this house.

312
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,934
When I say the little shit
don't eat, he don't eat.

313
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,036
Anzor.

314
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,873
John Wayne was a faggot.

315
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,676
So, uh, Vicki Goletto
told me she saw you

316
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:41,511
walking hand-in-hand
with Jeannie's daughter.

317
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:42,679
The fat one?

318
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,584
That sounded
like a gun.

319
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:52,289
Hey, Nick,
throw me some bread.

320
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,759
Aah!
Shit! Get down!

321
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,228
Get down! You ok?
You ok?!

322
00:19:58,296 --> 00:19:59,630
Jesus, Joe.
What the hell?

323
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,398
Stay here.
Motherfucker.

324
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,666
Motherfucker!

325
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,435
I'm gonna kill that
fuckin' piece of shit!

326
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:05,469
Where are you going?

327
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,504
You Russian piece of shit!

328
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,473
Gun.

329
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,743
Shoot my fuckin' house.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

330
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,977
Dad, wait!

331
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,746
Get back in the house.

332
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,215
Get back in the house!

333
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:19,683
Get back in now! Go!

334
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,456
Stay right here.
Don't you move, son, ok?

335
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,424
You fuckin' piece of shit.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

336
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,425
Nicky, get inside.

337
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,426
Fuckin'
piece of shit!

338
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,927
Joe! Joe!
Aah!

339
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,963
What's the matter with you?
I just called 911.

340
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,997
Leave it for the cops!

341
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:35,733
Get the kid and take him
back in the house!

342
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,133
You fuckin' piece of shit!

343
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:39,002
I'm gonna kill you!
Open the fuckin' door!

344
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,371
Oleg's my friend!
I'll kick it in!

345
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,239
He's my friend!
Open the door!

346
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,774
Joey, don't be
a damn hero!

347
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,643
Open up! It's Joey Gazelle
from next door! Open up!

348
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,144
Open up!

349
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,182
Get back! Get back!

350
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:54,752
Where is he?
Is he upstairs?

351
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:55,886
He's in--

352
00:20:55,953 --> 00:20:57,053
what?
He's--

353
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,355
listen, get down.

354
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,663
What the fuck?

355
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,099
Where's the kid?

356
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,401
Huh?

357
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,907
Where's the kid?

358
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,543
Fuck him.
I'm the one who's shot.

359
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,077
Who is he?
Is he still in the house?

360
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:23,514
The little snotfuck
ran out back.

361
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:26,182
Oleg?

362
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,885
Oleg? What are you
trying to say?

363
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,453
Oleg shot you?

364
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,321
What are you...

365
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:33,590
A fucking idiot?

366
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,692
I didn't do this
to myself.

367
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,296
The little prick
put a gun to me, too.

368
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:40,964
Look at him.

369
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,927
She used to
fucking make--

370
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,662
where'd he get
the piece?

371
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:12,696
Where'd he get
the fuckin' piece?!

372
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,730
Fuck should I know?!

373
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:14,765
What, it wasn't yours?

374
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,000
No! No way!

375
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:21,705
I got a .357
in the safe out back.

376
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,908
He had some fucking
snub-nosed thing.

377
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,612
Silver. Chrome.

378
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,064
This is bullshit, Nick!

379
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,500
Now you tell me!
I'm not playing around!

380
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,667
We saw where
you put the gun,

381
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:52,268
but he didn't
take anything--

382
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,670
not with me.

383
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:55,105
Well, he went back, Nicky.

384
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:56,339
Well, I didn't know.

385
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:58,642
I swear I didn't know.

386
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,377
Come here.
Listen to me.

387
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:01,912
Listen to me.
That piece,

388
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,480
that's not just
any hot piece.

389
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,181
Tommy used it
to burn a dirty cop.

390
00:23:05,249 --> 00:23:06,249
Oh, no.
Yeah.

391
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:07,250
Joe.
Yeah. No, no.

392
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:08,652
Listen, listen.
On top of it,

393
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,820
that kid's out there
right now.

394
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,121
The cops
are on their way.

395
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:13,256
If they find the gun
or they find the kid

396
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:15,325
and he talks,
I'm dead.

397
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,326
Fuck!

398
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,694
Calm down! Calm down.

399
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:18,695
Yeah.
Calm down.

400
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:19,830
We can get to him.

401
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,532
You can get to the gun
before the cops do.

402
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,833
Oh, shit.

403
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:34,310
Hey.

404
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:38,682
Hey, so where you
gonna take him?

405
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,017
Grimley
Memorial.

406
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:41,852
Hey, Mila, you know, I think
you should go with him, ok?

407
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,953
<i>Nyet.
Ya padazhdu.</i>

408
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:43,954
Yeah, no, you should
go with him.

409
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:44,955
I'm gonna go look
for Oleg.

410
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,289
Me and Nicky are gonna
go find him, ok?

411
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:47,424
And I'll get Teresa to stay
here in case he comes back.

412
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:48,491
All right?
All right, you should go.

413
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,526
Ok. Thank you,
Joey.

414
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,861
Yeah, no problem.
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,162
Yeah, no problem.

416
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:55,265
Yeah, we're gonna find him.
Don't worry about it.

417
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:01,404
Fuck.

418
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:07,343
Come on.

419
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:15,986
Police officers.

420
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,554
Sir, you live here?

421
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,255
No, no. Actually,
I live next door.

422
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:21,024
I heard some gunshots,
so I came over,

423
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,158
you know, to see
what's going on.

424
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,359
What did you see?

425
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:27,464
Uh, I saw anzor,
my neighbor.

426
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,866
He was in the kitchen.
He--he's been shot.

427
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,068
He say who did it?

428
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:32,970
Nah. He was screaming
in Russian.

429
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:34,671
His wife, she asked me
to stick around

430
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,039
for the kid.
He's out somewhere.

431
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,373
You don't know
who shot him?

432
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:38,575
No.

433
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,677
I'm gonna need to take
a statement outside.

434
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,512
I can't have you
messing up the scene, ok?

435
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,513
All right.

436
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,215
Hey, check it out.

437
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,385
I don't see
nothing inside.

438
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:51,688
Maybe all the way back.

439
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,556
Got it.

440
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,359
Leave it
for forensics.

441
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:00,230
Sir, I need for you
to wait outside.

442
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:02,799
All right.
No problem.

443
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,043
Fuckin' havin'
a heart attack.

444
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,612
I can't--I can't--

445
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,646
breathe.

446
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,082
I got to find this kid, t.

447
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,850
I got to find
this kid tonight.

448
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:22,286
Nick, I need to know
places, all right?

449
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,154
I need to know hideouts.
Go to your room right now

450
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,323
and make a list.
Nick, make a list!

451
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,591
Ok.

452
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:28,859
I'm not
fuckin' around, Nick.

453
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,594
Joe, just--
just take it easy.

454
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,096
There's
no fuckin' time!

455
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,905
All right, I want you
to wait next door,

456
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,475
and the second
he shows up, call me.

457
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,014
I got to fuckin'
do something about this.

458
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,749
I can't have the kid
fuckin' talking to the cops.

459
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,984
You understand me?

460
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,619
The fuckin' gun
is on the street.

461
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:57,054
This whole fuckin'
goddamn thing

462
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,389
is about to fuckin' blow up.

463
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,024
If fuckin' Tommy
or any of those fuckin' guys

464
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,825
find out about it,
I'm a dead man.

465
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,195
You got to fuckin' help me.

466
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,164
If I fuckin' have to.

467
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,942
Hey, grab your jacket, Nick.
We're going for a ride.

468
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,054
All right, Nick.

469
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,955
I want you to stay
in the car, all right?

470
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,424
Don't get out
for anything,

471
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,891
and if I'm not back
in one hour,

472
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:35,992
I want you to call
your mother.

473
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,728
She'll come
and get you, ok?

474
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:39,829
Excuse me.

475
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,765
Ok, take her
to burn now.

476
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:43,067
You're going
to be fine.

477
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:58,014
Dr. Gutierrez, 745.
Dr. Gutierrez, 745.

478
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,250
Excuse me.

479
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,819
Um, who's
in the other room?

480
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,955
Is that Yugorsky,
gunshot victim?

481
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:06,690
Teenager,
D.U.I. Car wreck.

482
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:08,959
I think they just
lost a G.S.W. in 3.

483
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:12,129
Lost?
He--he's dead?

484
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,230
Yeah.

485
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,798
No, wait. He took
a bullet right here.

486
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:16,700
No, a major trauma
to chest.

487
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:20,036
Been in surgery all day.
Guy was a cop.

488
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,672
Oh, wait. No. Yeah,
they did bring someone in

489
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,108
about 40 minutes ago.

490
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,443
O.R. number 2. I think
he's gone upstairs already.

491
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,711
That's this way?

492
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,509
Can I help you...
Dr. Donaldson?

493
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,377
Yeah. The cops
are waiting outside,

494
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,979
and they need to run a match
on this bullet asap.

495
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:04,914
Well, I'll make sure
they get it right away.

496
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,635
Excuse me.

497
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,180
You looking for this?

498
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,815
Yugorsky,
G.S.W., shoulder?

499
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,619
You got to help me
find him, Nick.

500
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,689
What are you gonna
do to him?

501
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:46,923
I'm not gonna
do nothing.

502
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,625
I just need to get my gun
back and bring him home.

503
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,728
You sure?

504
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,764
Talk to me, Nick.

505
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,202
It's this old
abandoned rec center

506
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,269
in the park.

507
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,071
Me and Oleg would
hang out there sometimes,

508
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,740
read comics.

509
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,075
He might be there.

510
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:30,066
Nice gun.

511
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,239
Lo Chan to admitting.

512
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,213
Detective Rydell,
narcotics.

513
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,049
I already made
a statement.

514
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,086
I don't know
who the shooter was.

515
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:52,188
Fuckin' niggers
all look the same.

516
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,390
Yeah.

517
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,858
Anzor Yugorsky.

518
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:56,860
Any relation
to Ivan Yugorsky?

519
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,528
My Uncle.

520
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,397
The czar
of Brighton beach.

521
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,098
I been to his club
a couple of times.

522
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,101
Nice joint. He even
sang a few songs.

523
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:07,971
He sings like
a fucking toad.

524
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,839
Well, Sinatra he's not,

525
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:12,108
but he's a man with
a serious reputation.

526
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:13,943
He has a lot of enemies.

527
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,178
Bullshit.

528
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,749
I told you. It was just
some fucking crackhead.

529
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,451
Yeah, well, I spoke to
the officers on the scene.

530
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,287
There was no sign
of forced entry,

531
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,156
but they did find some
interesting shit out back--

532
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:28,158
6 cases of Nyquil,

533
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:29,760
and it ain't even
cold season.

534
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,161
Now, what do you think
a search warrant

535
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,329
is gonna turn up, huh?

536
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,535
Dr. Cookson,
call imaging services.

537
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,805
Dr. Cookson,
call imaging services.

538
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,989
Come on, where?

539
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:01,257
It's this way.

540
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,793
Let's go.

541
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,428
Quick, come on.

542
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,231
Come on.

543
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,802
Go.
Go, go, go.

544
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,940
This way.

545
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,275
Be cool...

546
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:23,780
And let me do
all the talking.

547
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,915
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

548
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:27,651
Help you?

549
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,520
Yeah.
How much you got?

550
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,291
Oh, I got a lot.

551
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,963
Ha ha ha. Yes.

552
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,505
Oleg, it's Nicky.
Are you in there?

553
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:58,181
Is this the spot?

554
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,649
Yeah.

555
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,836
Now, where's
the stash?

556
00:32:03,904 --> 00:32:05,372
Last stall,
motherfucker.

557
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:07,524
Go. Find the stash.

558
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,693
Find it.

559
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,695
Go on.

560
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,996
Find it.

561
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,564
Find it!

562
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,999
Heh heh heh.

563
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:22,372
Fuck.

564
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,580
We're gonna search
this entire fuckin' park.

565
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:31,815
He might still be around.

566
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,858
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, white boy?

567
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:42,959
All right,
drop it, man,

568
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,494
or I'll fuckin'
waste the midget!

569
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,162
Come on!

570
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,332
He's just a tagalong.

571
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,535
Plug 'em, Dale!
Plug the motherfucker!

572
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,102
Fuck him up!

573
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,105
I'll fuck you up, man!
Just let my boy go!

574
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:58,942
Pop a cap
in his ass!

575
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,878
Wait, motherfucker, wait!

576
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,880
Man, shoot this
motherfucker! Shoot that--

577
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,325
All right,
stay right by me.

578
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:17,327
Here.
Against the wall.

579
00:33:17,394 --> 00:33:18,394
You stay right there.
Don't you move.

580
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,529
You stay right there.

581
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,566
Fuck.

582
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,301
Hey, hey, I didn't
do nothing, officer.

583
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:26,603
I--I--I just came--

584
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,137
you put
your fuckin' hands

585
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:29,439
against
the stall now!

586
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,307
Put your fuckin'
head down!

587
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:34,544
Oleg.

588
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,948
I--I told you
to stay outside.

589
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:38,949
Did you find him?

590
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:40,383
Get the fuck outside!

591
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,852
Get out of here!

592
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,487
I'm fuckin' talking to you!
Turn around. What'd you see?

593
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:46,422
Did you find the gun?

594
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,524
Did you find
the silver gun?

595
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,625
Did you find
that fuckin' silver gun?

596
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,961
I--I--I don't know.

597
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,639
Aah!

598
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:05,542
You want to study
for your G.E.D.? Here.

599
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:06,543
Aah!

600
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,843
Aah!

601
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,451
Uhh!

602
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,121
Look what you done to
my fuckin' ride, bitch.

603
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,424
It's just 6 weeks, baby.

604
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,092
Please?

605
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,995
I only been taking
one class--

606
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,630
one class,
two hours a week.

607
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,567
I still got time
to be pullin' tricks.

608
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:33,236
3 fuckin' gs I find you
for these fuckin' airbags,

609
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,672
and what do I get
in return?

610
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,706
Fuckin' night school?

611
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:38,575
I'll quit.

612
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:41,244
I'm super-proud of you for
showing some initiative.

613
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,580
Maybe I'll even come
to your graduation.

614
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,615
But first you're gonna
give me back

615
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:46,782
my fuckin' property!

616
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,994
<i>You learn how to use that
watching sesame street?</i>

617
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:03,533
You ain't even
holding it right.

618
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,703
What's the matter, kid?

619
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,871
You got the shakes?

620
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:13,876
Whoops.

621
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:17,614
Now I'm gonna put a smile
on your face, boy--

622
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,649
cheek to cheek.

623
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,318
You're gonna be the happiest
little brat in school.

624
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,953
Say cheese.

625
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,521
Aah!

626
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:26,623
Who's laughing now,

627
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,660
you fucking gray meat
limp dick motherfucker?

628
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,994
Mack daddy!

629
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:33,963
Who's mackin' now, bitch?

630
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,097
<i>¡Puñeta!</i>

631
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,470
<i>You got
some cojones, kid.</i>

632
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:58,288
Let me see
your fingers, son.

633
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,461
Is this--hey, hey.
Is this your son?

634
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,963
I'm taking care of him
tonight, ok?

635
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,899
Well, unless you have the name
and number of his doctor

636
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:11,601
and I can get a prescription
over the phone,

637
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,336
you're gonna have to
take him to emergency, ok?

638
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,537
Now, if you want me
to call you a cab--

639
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,572
I don't need
no fucking cab.

640
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,508
I need some
spray shit for him.

641
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:19,809
Well, that spray shit
happens to be

642
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,076
a controlled substance,
ma'am,

643
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:22,412
so what can I tell you?

644
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,181
Keep the change.

645
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:27,350
I can't--this is stupid.
I can't do this.

646
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,319
Listen, why don't we
go out in the back,

647
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:31,287
and we talk
about it, ok?

648
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,388
Look, lady--

649
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,489
I'll take care of you.

650
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,892
There's nothing
I can do, lady.

651
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,260
There's nothing
you can do?

652
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,462
Take him
to emergency.

653
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,996
Ok.

654
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:42,365
Ok...

655
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,900
Nothing you can
fucking do?

656
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:47,903
Get what he needs...Now.

657
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:49,472
It's Beclovent.

658
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,707
Yeah, I know.

659
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:52,141
Beclovent, bitch!

660
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:54,143
Come on,
let's just go back.

661
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:57,847
No. No. If he turns up,
your mom's gonna call.

662
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:02,117
T.

663
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,622
Sal.

664
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,024
Yeah.

665
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:15,164
Do girls really
get naked in there?

666
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,333
You'll find out
when you're 21.

667
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,336
I've seen mom naked.
It's no big deal.

668
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,006
Trust me on this one.
It's always a big deal.

669
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:27,910
Stay here.

670
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:40,990
Put your hands together
for the sexy redhead...

671
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,827
Galaxy.

672
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,114
What?

673
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,249
It's taken care of.

674
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:10,386
Oh, it's taken care of.
Lucky us.

675
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,756
Guys, sit down.
Have a seat.

676
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,357
Don't be shy.

677
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,361
They make a good Mai Tai
for a twat bar,

678
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:20,329
but seriously
overpriced--

679
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:22,665
$2 million for
a round of drinks,

680
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:23,800
and the pussy
ain't even that hot.

681
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,534
Hey, baby.

682
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:28,037
Jodi, I'm doing
business here. Jodi...

683
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,339
Come on. Get the fuck
out of here.

684
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,008
$2 million.

685
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,743
Suck a dick,
you prick bastard.

686
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,944
You don't have
shit on us.

687
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,345
What do you think
of this?

688
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,447
The cops never found
these at the scene,

689
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:40,850
just 2 dead narcs
and 3 dead Jamaicans.

690
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,318
Ballistics
is going to reveal

691
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,853
that the slugs
that killed my partners

692
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,955
didn't come
from the Jamaicans,

693
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,657
so there were
others involved.

694
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,659
As for myself, uh...

695
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:51,161
I was never there.

696
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:55,431
Well, dead guys
tell no tales.

697
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,900
Yeah.

698
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:59,269
Why don't you ask
your pal here?

699
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,705
What the fuck
you talking about?

700
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,174
You blew my partner
Stevie's balls off

701
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,641
with a .38 snub nose,

702
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:07,543
a real
distinctive piece--

703
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,414
stainless, polished up
like a spic's hubcap.

704
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:14,984
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

705
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,452
I think that
you gave him the gun

706
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,288
to dump in the river.

707
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:19,889
Now, I'm assuming that
he never got around to it,

708
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,524
because 2 hours ago,

709
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:24,194
his next-door neighbor
took a slug in the shoulder.

710
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,495
The shooter was the guy's
10-year-old stepson,

711
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:28,731
who was over
at Gazelle's house

712
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,933
2 hours earlier.

713
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,734
What the fuck you
trying to do here?

714
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,636
Huh? You trying to
fuckin' play us?

715
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,104
Because you're wasting
our fuckin' time.

716
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,405
This is goddamn
fuckin' bullshit.

717
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,774
Bullshit?
Bullshit, huh?

718
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,944
This punk
anzor Yugorsky,

719
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,779
he describes the gun
to me in vivid detail.

720
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,216
Makes mention
it's a snub nose

721
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,484
with a serious
shine to it.

722
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,519
What the fuck is this guy
talking about, Joey?

723
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:51,988
He's talking about
a fuckin' shiny gun.

724
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,056
Big fuckin' deal.

725
00:39:53,123 --> 00:39:54,190
There's a thousand
of them on the street.

726
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,658
It ain't
the fuckin' piece.

727
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,427
Oh, yeah? What were you
doing at the hospital

728
00:39:58,495 --> 00:39:59,795
when they brought
Yugorsky in?

729
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,365
Huh? Sniffing around
emergency?

730
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:04,033
You know what I figure?

731
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,501
I figure you were there
to pull a switch

732
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,237
on the slug
they took out of him.

733
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,706
My wife asked me to go
to the hospital.

734
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,041
She was concerned--you know,
in a neighborly way.

735
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,076
She wanted me
to go to see--

736
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:14,110
all right,
you know what?

737
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,144
Enough bullshit.

738
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,213
I expect to find
a bag in this locker

739
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,349
at Dominic station
by midnight.

740
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,550
If the bag is not there
one minute after,

741
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:24,888
I'm taking you all down
any fuckin' way I can,

742
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,956
even if I have to
manufacture the case.

743
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,191
And you know I will,

744
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,559
because I got the toughest
mob in the world.

745
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:32,695
I'm the law.

746
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,914
All right, stay put.

747
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,315
I'm gonna grab you
a burger.

748
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,549
I'm not hungry.

749
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,817
Yeah, but you didn't
finish dinner,

750
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,319
so I'm gonna grab you
something to eat.

751
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,621
Stay here.

752
00:40:58,688 --> 00:40:59,989
Dad?

753
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,827
Don't go in there.
Let's just go home.

754
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,896
It's gonna be
all right.

755
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,367
No, it's not.

756
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:14,703
Hey, Frankie,
how you doing?

757
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:15,905
Hey, how are you?

758
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,106
Yeah, it's good
to see you.

759
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,541
Sit, Joe.

760
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:19,608
How you doing, guys?

761
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:20,944
Hi, Joey.

762
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:21,945
How you doing, man?

763
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,646
Joey.
I'm fine.

764
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:25,081
You want some coffee,
something to eat?

765
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,582
Nah, I'm good.
But, listen,

766
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,284
I got my boy, he's
waiting out in the car.

767
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,485
I want to get him
a burger or something.

768
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,920
Tony, go and take care
of that, yeah?

769
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,721
Yeah, Tony,
get him some fries

770
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,290
and a strawberry shake.

771
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,659
And don't scare him.
He don't know you're coming.

772
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:41,965
So, Joe...

773
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,666
I just got off the phone
with Ivan Yugorsky

774
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,001
about this thing
with his nephew.

775
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,636
I told you. It's not
the fuckin' piece.

776
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:49,973
Look, everybody knows

777
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,342
the nephew is
a brain-fried retrobate.

778
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,443
Yeah, whatever.

779
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,978
He's a fuckin' tweaker
piece of shit.

780
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,245
And he's cooking meth
in his backyard.

781
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,347
I know I told you
this already,

782
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,581
but it's just
a matter of time

783
00:41:58,648 --> 00:41:59,815
before he blows up the whole
fuckin' neighborhood.

784
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:00,984
We notice,

785
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,519
but it's a sensitive issue
with me and you.

786
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:07,357
Now, I'm in bed with Yugorsky
on this gasoline deal.

787
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,492
Hey, it's a good deal.

788
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,860
I don't want
to rock the boat.

789
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:14,364
Aw, fuck that. Fuck those
Russian cunts, huh?

790
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,832
Pa, it's
the fuckin' narc

791
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,468
that's got his dick
in our ass.

792
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,669
Hey...

793
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:23,239
Calm down, Tommy.

794
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,174
You see, Joe,

795
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,310
the tweaker's
got it in his head

796
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,978
that maybe
you were looking

797
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,646
to knock him out
of the cooking business

798
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,081
and help the boy out.

799
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,450
Made a piece
available to him.

800
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,687
I would never use a kid
to do something like that.

801
00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:40,423
Never.

802
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,292
All right, all right, look.

803
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,062
I made a personal
reassurance to Yugorsky

804
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,164
that I would have
my entire crew in the street

805
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,899
out looking for that kid.

806
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:53,769
Now, in the interest
of professional harmony,

807
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,105
I think we all want
to get our stories straight.

808
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,674
You agree,
don't you, Joe?

809
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,448
One hamburger,
and you're out of my life.

810
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,549
That's it.

811
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:07,983
Oleg.

812
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,390
Oh, shit.

813
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,025
Hey, kid...

814
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,326
How you doing?

815
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,228
Your old man sent
this stuff out for you.

816
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,963
Thanks.

817
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,532
Ain't it a little late
for you to be out, huh?

818
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,800
I got twins your age.
They're in bed by now.

819
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,370
What are you, like, 9?

820
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,004
10...

821
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,540
And a half.

822
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,575
I got to go
to the bathroom.

823
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,387
Hey, Joey...

824
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,889
Looks like your kid
don't listen too well.

825
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,061
It must run
in the family.

826
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,798
Hey, Nicky, get over here.

827
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:57,733
Get over here.

828
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:02,838
What the hell you doing?

829
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,340
I thought I told you
to wait in the car.

830
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:05,641
I had to go
to the bathroom.

831
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,942
How you doing,
Nicky?

832
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,612
You want, uh, you want
some gummy bears?

833
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,583
Hey, Nicky,
you wouldn't by chance

834
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,420
know where your friend
got that gun, would you?

835
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,422
No. Uh...

836
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,324
I have to go
to the bathroom.

837
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:22,558
Ok.

838
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,760
Nicky, you go
to the bathroom.

839
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,401
Have you decided yet?

840
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,837
I have a bus
to catch in--

841
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:36,305
<i>ah. ¿cuando?</i>

842
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,740
I'll have a cheeseburger
and a coke.

843
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:38,874
Mmm.

844
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,611
I got to go
to the bathroom.

845
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,412
Don't worry. We're gonna
take care of the cop, ok?

846
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,281
I know.
Ok.

847
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,624
Where is it?

848
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:12,041
Hey, Nicky.

849
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:14,676
Where the hell are you?

850
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:15,844
I'm almost done.

851
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:17,313
Well, hurry up in there.
Come on, we got to go.

852
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,981
Razors.
Razors.

853
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,620
Get over there
and wash your hands.

854
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:26,288
We got to get
out of here. Come on.

855
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,503
Fuck.

856
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,007
Hey, sweetie,
how you doing?

857
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,075
Good, hon.

858
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,843
All right, Nick,
listen to me.

859
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,611
I want you to think
really hard

860
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:50,946
about where your friend
might be right now,

861
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,448
because the others,
they're looking for him,

862
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:53,882
and if they find him
first, I'm--

863
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,051
they won't find
the gun.

864
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:56,252
What did you say?

865
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,287
What did you say?

866
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,360
Don't you mess
with me, Nicky.

867
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,262
I want you to fuckin'
talk to me now.

868
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:08,264
Just promise me
you won't hurt him.

869
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:09,798
Nick, I don't have time
for this shit right now.

870
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:11,467
Now fuckin' tell me.
Promise!

871
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:12,734
Promise you what?

872
00:46:12,802 --> 00:46:14,636
What, what? I promise.
I swear to God.

873
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:15,971
I'm not gonna fuckin'
hurt your friend.

874
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,039
Now, just come on.
Just tell me.

875
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,208
Just tell me
what you know.

876
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:40,396
Come on.

877
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:47,436
Uhh. Uhh...

878
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,305
This one here?

879
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,979
Uhh. Uhh.

880
00:46:57,046 --> 00:46:58,380
Man.

881
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,284
Unh!

882
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,753
Uhh. Ohh.

883
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,913
Come on,
where is it, Nick?

884
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:33,249
I thought you said
you put it in there.

885
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:34,416
Well, I did.
I put it right there.

886
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:35,551
Then where is it?

887
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,752
I thought you said
you put it in the tank.

888
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:37,953
I put it in here.

889
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,358
Aw, shit. Which one
did you put it in, Nick?

890
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:45,494
Huh? Which one
did you put it in?

891
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,434
God damn it, Nicky.

892
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,802
Why'd you lie to me?

893
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,003
Why did you lie
to me?

894
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:56,238
I didn't.

895
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,906
Why did you
lie to me?!

896
00:47:57,974 --> 00:47:59,341
Why did you
lie to me?!

897
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,377
I'm not fucking lying!
I put it in there!

898
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:04,780
You just fuckin'
killed me, Nick.

899
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:06,982
You just fucking
killed me.

900
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,727
You come here.

901
00:48:51,794 --> 00:48:53,562
Now, I want you to keep
an eye open, right?

902
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,663
If you see anybody come,

903
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,865
I want you to cough
really loud, all right?

904
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:10,746
You're like
a broken record.

905
00:49:10,813 --> 00:49:12,414
I'm telling you.
You got to see this.

906
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,216
You better not be
jerking my chain.

907
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,051
What are you
doing here, kid?

908
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,853
I was looking
for the bathroom.

909
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,021
See? Even the kid thinks
it's a shithole back here.

910
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:21,523
Shut up, Ralphie.

911
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:22,824
All right, just...

912
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:24,526
You go on out
through that door there,

913
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,262
turn left, go all the way
down to the end,

914
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:28,497
turn left again,
and you're there.

915
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,366
You got it?

916
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:36,572
Uh, which door?

917
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:39,642
Come here, kid.
I'll show you.

918
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:41,977
Come here, kid.

919
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,280
Hey, yolanda.

920
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:45,614
Come on.
Wait up.

921
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,848
Where you going
with my cheesecake?

922
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:48,584
No, this is
for paying customers,

923
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,218
not you.

924
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:54,590
Manny.

925
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,425
Where are you? Here.

926
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,263
There. I got
your number, fucker.

927
00:50:10,106 --> 00:50:12,274
Forget it. I ain't
dragging your butt

928
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,043
across no state lines.

929
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:19,981
Look, papa, why don't you
just go home?

930
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:22,951
I bet you things are not
as bad as you think they are.

931
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,160
Come on, papa.

932
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:37,466
Oh, motherfucker!

933
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,900
Be careful
what you say!

934
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:41,102
Get down! Over here.

935
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,807
Run! Run,
little man, run!

936
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,211
Hey!

937
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:50,579
Let go!

938
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,748
Get off! Get off!

939
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,049
Get off!

940
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,674
Do you know these guys?

941
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,684
Yeah.

942
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,952
Baby?
Hmm.

943
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,287
Where the hell
are you?

944
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,055
Taking care of things.

945
00:51:34,123 --> 00:51:35,391
Well, forget about it,

946
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:36,892
because they picked up
Oleg at a bus station

947
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:37,959
with some hooker.

948
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:41,196
Who picked him up?
The cops?

949
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,264
Yeah.

950
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:44,633
Jesus Christ. This is
fuckin' bullshit.

951
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,101
Hey...
Fuck!

952
00:51:46,168 --> 00:51:48,136
Hey! You got Nicky
with you?

953
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:49,571
Yeah, he's right here.

954
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,540
Then stop using
your mouth around him

955
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,643
and bring my son
home now.

956
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:57,145
Yeah. Yeah,
that's what I'm doing.

957
00:51:57,213 --> 00:51:58,280
I'm bringing him home
right now.

958
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:09,257
Ah.

959
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:10,492
Do you mind?

960
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,728
I'm feeling
kind of parched.

961
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,297
Big game Friday night.

962
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:18,667
I bet you're excited
about that, huh?

963
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,301
It's gonna be red ice

964
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:22,270
and plenty of
blue shirt body bags.

965
00:52:22,338 --> 00:52:25,273
Am I right?
Ha ha ha.

966
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:27,475
Look...

967
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:29,310
I could help you, kid--

968
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:31,146
you and your mom,
if need be.

969
00:52:31,213 --> 00:52:33,882
Now, I could get that prick
out of your life,

970
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,316
lock him up.

971
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:37,953
I could do that.
I'm a cop.

972
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,755
All you have to do
is tell me

973
00:52:39,822 --> 00:52:41,456
where you found the gun

974
00:52:41,524 --> 00:52:44,860
and where you stashed it.

975
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,395
That's it.
What do you say?

976
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:50,265
You let me help you.

977
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:56,138
Get out of here, Mila.

978
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:58,874
You know,
go to a shelter.

979
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:01,877
I mean, I can get you
an address.

980
00:53:01,944 --> 00:53:04,279
You don't understand.

981
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,449
I belong to him.

982
00:53:08,517 --> 00:53:13,955
No. No. No, no, no.
I don't understand.

983
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:20,461
I was prostitute
in moscow.

984
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,700
Yugorsky
escort service

985
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:26,501
offered to
bring girls over

986
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:30,305
with promise
of big bucks.

987
00:53:30,372 --> 00:53:32,874
We would owe
$50,000--

988
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:35,310
you know, pay back
through work.

989
00:53:37,413 --> 00:53:39,347
I take offer,

990
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:42,718
not tell them
I'm pregnant.

991
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:45,320
When they
find out...

992
00:53:47,656 --> 00:53:49,791
They insist
I have an abortion.

993
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,993
Tss.
I told them no.

994
00:53:54,396 --> 00:53:57,332
They sent anzor
to kill me.

995
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:00,836
Anzor's not a killer.

996
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:04,272
He's not hard man

997
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,842
like big yugorsky.

998
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:11,346
He thinks...

999
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:14,983
He thinks he's,
you know, John Wayne.

1000
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,355
Must do right thing.

1001
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:23,391
He goes
against his Uncle.

1002
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:25,293
He tells
big man yugorsky

1003
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:27,863
he will pay off my debt.

1004
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:31,699
His Uncle refuses,

1005
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,236
tells him...

1006
00:54:34,303 --> 00:54:36,738
He will send others
to kill me

1007
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,374
to set example.

1008
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:44,445
So, anzor make me wife.

1009
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:48,383
Big man yugorsky can't
kill his nephew's wife.

1010
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:54,156
But he tells anzor

1011
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:56,457
to leave
little Odessa.

1012
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:58,894
He's no longer

1013
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:02,764
working for
yugorsky family.

1014
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,565
Yeah.

1015
00:55:06,468 --> 00:55:08,736
I'm gonna get you
the name of a shelter.

1016
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,582
You ok?

1017
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,252
This ain't right, Joe.

1018
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,955
He don't need to be
put through this.

1019
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,424
Nick, I'm proud of you.
You done good, all right?

1020
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,369
Look, I'm gonna head up
to community hills.

1021
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:42,704
The cops don't got
the gun yet,

1022
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:44,372
but I may have a line on it,
so I'm gonna go over there.

1023
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:47,642
I'm scared, Joe.

1024
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:51,379
I am pissed at you,
and I am scared--

1025
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:53,614
equal measures.

1026
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:01,823
Be careful.

1027
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:14,035
Hey.
Hey.

1028
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:16,471
Just got word. The cops
picked up the kid.

1029
00:56:16,538 --> 00:56:18,273
Anything you still
want to tell us?

1030
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,075
Tell you what?
There's nothing to tell.

1031
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:21,910
Where you headed, Joe?

1032
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,445
Uh, I was supposed
to head to the store

1033
00:56:24,513 --> 00:56:26,114
and pick up
some milk and eggs.

1034
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,917
In all the excitement,
I forgot to do it, so...

1035
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:32,487
Hmm. Yugorsky's
gonna call us

1036
00:56:32,554 --> 00:56:34,655
when he talks
to the kid.

1037
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:37,825
Don't go too far.

1038
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,495
Later, Joe.

1039
00:56:40,562 --> 00:56:42,497
Yeah, see you.

1040
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,367
Hey, t...

1041
00:56:45,434 --> 00:56:47,235
Lookin' fuckin' good.

1042
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,012
He keeps giving me
this bullshit story

1043
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,479
about finding the gun

1044
00:56:58,547 --> 00:57:00,681
in some abandoned locker
in school.

1045
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:02,183
What do you
want me to do?

1046
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:03,584
The little fucker
shot me.

1047
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:05,086
He ain't gonna
spill dick to you.

1048
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:08,489
You know, I don't think
I'm being clear enough here.

1049
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:10,525
You know what I mean?

1050
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,030
Let me be crystal clear.

1051
00:57:15,097 --> 00:57:17,465
You get the boy
to give up Gazelle,

1052
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:19,767
or I'm closing shop
on your tweaker ass,

1053
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:21,736
and I'm taking you down
fuckin' hard.

1054
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:23,905
Understand me?

1055
00:57:29,545 --> 00:57:31,879
Hey, cowboy.

1056
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,015
Want to go get
some ice cream?

1057
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:52,733
Yo, we got
good shit, daddy.

1058
00:57:56,238 --> 00:57:59,674
Get the fuck away
from my car.

1059
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,782
Hey. Hey, I'm looking
for Manny Perez.

1060
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,451
He--he's
not here. No!

1061
00:58:11,687 --> 00:58:13,921
Manny?
Where the fuck is he?

1062
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,290
He's not here.
Where is he?

1063
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:16,391
Where is he?!

1064
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:17,592
He's not here!

1065
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,127
You better not
fuckin' lie to me!

1066
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,128
Aah!

1067
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:21,596
Where the fuck is he?
Where is he?

1068
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:23,031
Ok, ok.
Where is he?

1069
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,632
He's at Armando's.

1070
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,766
Armando's.
Uh-huh.

1071
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:26,834
He's at Armando's.

1072
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:28,003
Yes. He's at--

1073
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,704
get the hell out of the way.
You stay right there.

1074
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,978
What's your name?
What's your name?

1075
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,113
Conchita.

1076
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,547
Conchita.

1077
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:41,316
Now, you listen
to me, conchita.

1078
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:42,550
You listen to me
real good.

1079
00:58:42,618 --> 00:58:43,718
I don't want
to hurt Manny.

1080
00:58:43,785 --> 00:58:44,785
Ok.
All right?

1081
00:58:44,853 --> 00:58:45,820
I don't want
to hurt him,

1082
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:47,255
but he has something
that belongs to me--

1083
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:48,689
a gun. Do you know
anything about a gun?

1084
00:58:48,757 --> 00:58:50,025
No, no.
No.

1085
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:53,094
No. It's block 5, number 602.
That's where he is.

1086
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,196
Ok. Now,
listen to me.

1087
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:57,198
We are now on what we call
the honor system.

1088
00:58:57,266 --> 00:58:58,466
<i>You comprende? You
understand what I'm saying?</i>

1089
00:58:58,534 --> 00:58:59,534
<i>Sí.
Ok.</i>

1090
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:01,369
You don't call Manny.
Ok.

1091
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:02,737
You don't tell Manny
I'm coming.

1092
00:59:02,804 --> 00:59:04,272
You don't warn him
for anything,

1093
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,992
because if you do,
I'm gonna come back here!

1094
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:17,669
I can be an asshole.

1095
00:59:19,505 --> 00:59:21,840
You've made your point.

1096
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:25,510
You showed some balls.

1097
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,683
I like that.

1098
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:36,021
But now it's time
to be smart.

1099
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:42,260
You tell me
what I want to know,

1100
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,029
and I'm gonna
reward you--

1101
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:47,032
razors season tickets.

1102
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:51,803
I'm sorry.

1103
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:53,839
It's ok.

1104
00:59:53,906 --> 00:59:56,274
I told you, we're cool.

1105
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,776
Just tell me.

1106
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,611
I'm sorry I missed.

1107
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:03,181
You little shit.

1108
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:09,587
Tell me where
the fuckin' gun is.

1109
01:00:09,656 --> 01:00:12,457
You tell me, or I will
fuckin' kill you.

1110
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:14,893
Uhh! Fuck!

1111
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:20,198
Oleg!

1112
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:28,707
Oleg!

1113
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,544
Oleg!

1114
01:00:38,017 --> 01:00:39,450
Where are you?

1115
01:00:39,518 --> 01:00:41,252
You little shit!

1116
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:47,726
Oleg!

1117
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:49,895
I'll find you!

1118
01:00:56,535 --> 01:00:58,737
I'm gonna kill you, you...

1119
01:00:58,805 --> 01:01:02,473
You're only making it
worse on yourself!

1120
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:04,776
Do you hear me?

1121
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:16,121
Jeez, Edele, I think
we picked up a stray.

1122
01:01:17,556 --> 01:01:19,457
Indeed.

1123
01:01:19,525 --> 01:01:21,292
Hello there.

1124
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,427
Hi.

1125
01:01:22,494 --> 01:01:25,831
And who might you be?

1126
01:01:25,898 --> 01:01:27,265
You know, I think we should
get another ice cream cone.

1127
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:30,168
Oh, I think you're
right, papa bear.

1128
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,480
Hey.

1129
01:01:42,548 --> 01:01:44,249
Hey, are you Manny?

1130
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:46,051
Manny? Nah.
He's upstairs.

1131
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,219
What you want
with him?

1132
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,820
Business.

1133
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:51,256
If he owes you any
money, forget about it.

1134
01:01:51,323 --> 01:01:53,225
<i>Heh! I just cleaned
the cabron out.</i>

1135
01:01:55,261 --> 01:01:56,661
Yeah?
Who is it?

1136
01:01:56,729 --> 01:01:58,496
It's conchita.

1137
01:01:58,564 --> 01:01:59,765
Ah, conchita.

1138
01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:01,166
<i>Oh, la conchita.</i>

1139
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:05,070
Uhh!

1140
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,738
Faces on
the fuckin' table!

1141
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,306
Heads down and fuckin'
hands behind your head!

1142
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:10,375
You move,
and I will fuck you up!

1143
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:12,677
I will fuck you up!
Don't you move, partner.

1144
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:14,212
Don't you fuckin' move.

1145
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,546
I'll fuck you up.

1146
01:02:15,614 --> 01:02:16,948
Which one of you
is fuckin' Manny?

1147
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:17,983
Who's Manny?

1148
01:02:20,052 --> 01:02:21,419
Are you done?

1149
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,687
<i>You mother--
¡pendejo!</i>

1150
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:25,123
You Manny?
You motherfucker!

1151
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:27,225
<i>Don't call me
pendejo, you fuck!</i>

1152
01:02:27,293 --> 01:02:28,827
I want my fuckin' gun!

1153
01:02:28,895 --> 01:02:30,295
I want my fuckin'
snub nose!

1154
01:02:30,362 --> 01:02:32,097
You lifted it from
the fuckin' Arlington!

1155
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,665
Now, where
the fuck is it?

1156
01:02:33,732 --> 01:02:34,666
Where the fuck is it?

1157
01:02:34,733 --> 01:02:36,434
Aah!

1158
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,602
Aah!

1159
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,137
Aah! Aah!

1160
01:02:39,205 --> 01:02:41,506
Fuck you!
Where the fuck is my gun?

1161
01:03:01,393 --> 01:03:04,262
fuck!

1162
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,631
Fuck! Motherfucker!

1163
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,134
Aah!

1164
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,151
Look at that.

1165
01:03:10,218 --> 01:03:11,152
That's a good smile.

1166
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:12,386
Look at those braces.

1167
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,788
There's a little
dimple there.

1168
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,523
They are.

1169
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,328
Yeah, that's
super cute.

1170
01:03:20,395 --> 01:03:21,896
Isn't this cool, huh?

1171
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,230
Here, come on.
Look back in the camera.

1172
01:03:23,298 --> 01:03:24,599
Try it again.
And you push that.

1173
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,335
Look in there and push--
oh, my gosh. Yeah.

1174
01:03:27,402 --> 01:03:29,136
You can't see, right?

1175
01:03:29,204 --> 01:03:30,171
Hey, Eric.

1176
01:03:30,238 --> 01:03:31,172
That's very smart.
Yeah.

1177
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:32,273
You want to hug
your sister?

1178
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,041
Yeah.
Come on.

1179
01:03:34,109 --> 01:03:36,110
Just a little bit.
Get a little closer.

1180
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:37,912
Come on, you guys
love each other.

1181
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,246
You need a little hug.

1182
01:03:39,314 --> 01:03:40,348
A little closer.

1183
01:03:40,415 --> 01:03:41,349
Come on.

1184
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:42,484
Extend the arm.

1185
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:44,251
Heh heh heh heh.

1186
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,320
Come on.
Come on, Eric.

1187
01:03:46,388 --> 01:03:47,589
You can do it a little
better than that.

1188
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:49,557
I mean, that's
your sister, right?

1189
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,692
That's very good.

1190
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:52,894
You love your sister,
don't you?

1191
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,261
What about you,
Oleg?

1192
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:57,031
You want to be in the film
as well, don't you?

1193
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:59,367
My stomach hurts.
Can I go to the bathroom?

1194
01:03:59,434 --> 01:04:00,902
Sure.

1195
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:04,205
I'll just hold on
to this.

1196
01:04:04,272 --> 01:04:05,239
Mm-hmm.

1197
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:07,742
You go outside,
you take a right

1198
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,377
and then a left.

1199
01:04:09,444 --> 01:04:11,212
Hurry up though.
You're missing out.

1200
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:13,414
Mmm.

1201
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:16,417
Who wants to play
dress-up?

1202
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,886
Oh, good,
dress-up.

1203
01:04:17,953 --> 01:04:20,321
We have
the burning rocket

1204
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,823
and the volts.

1205
01:05:33,528 --> 01:05:34,696
There you are.

1206
01:05:34,763 --> 01:05:38,666
I thought you needed
to go to the bathroom.

1207
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:40,401
I couldn't find it.

1208
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,237
Silly boy.

1209
01:05:43,305 --> 01:05:44,906
I told you
to take a right,

1210
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,208
then a left.

1211
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,613
Come.

1212
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,047
I'll show you.

1213
01:05:58,553 --> 01:06:01,555
Don't forget to wash
your hands when you're done.

1214
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,272
Joe?

1215
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,341
Mrs. Gazelle?

1216
01:06:20,408 --> 01:06:21,909
Who is this?

1217
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:23,344
Is this--
Oleg.

1218
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:25,513
I'm sorry about taking
the gun, Mrs. Gazelle.

1219
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,481
Oleg, where are you?

1220
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:29,150
I think I'm in trouble.

1221
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:31,853
Sweetheart, I know
what happened, ok?

1222
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,187
I need you to be
straight up with me.

1223
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,989
Are the police listening
in on this call?

1224
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:37,191
No, I'm not
with the police.

1225
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:39,160
I'm at Dez and Edele's
apartment.

1226
01:06:39,227 --> 01:06:41,462
There's
2 other kids here.

1227
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,630
What?

1228
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,999
I--I think they're
gonna to hurt us.

1229
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,333
Oh, Jesus.

1230
01:06:46,401 --> 01:06:48,602
Come on. No. Is this
some kind of a joke?

1231
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,705
Oleg, you have caused
enough trouble today.

1232
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,073
Where are you?

1233
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,776
I don't know. I was in
the back of a van.

1234
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:55,977
They brought us here.

1235
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:57,845
They got this room with
all these toys in it.

1236
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:59,346
They're making a video.

1237
01:06:59,414 --> 01:07:01,983
Ok, ok. Oleg,
I need you to look around

1238
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,085
for an address
for me, ok?

1239
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,187
Um, is there any mail
laying around?

1240
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:07,454
I'm in the bathroom.

1241
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:08,990
She's gonna come back
any minute.

1242
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:12,493
Bathroom. Oh, Jesus,
I don't know, I don't know.

1243
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,395
I don't know. Um...

1244
01:07:14,462 --> 01:07:18,666
Uh, I don't know.
Just call 911.

1245
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:22,036
No. I don't want to go
back to the police.

1246
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,805
Why?

1247
01:07:23,872 --> 01:07:26,741
They want me to say I got
the gun from Mr. Gazelle.

1248
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,614
Do you need
some help in there?

1249
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,416
I'm ok.

1250
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:37,819
It's my stomach.
I'm almost done.

1251
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:40,955
Oh, you poor thing.

1252
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,524
Well, I'm right outside.

1253
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,026
Oleg.
I'm still here.

1254
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,460
Ok.

1255
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:50,732
Ok, so look in
the medicine cabinet.

1256
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,399
Do you see any bottles?

1257
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:54,568
Prescription bottles
usually have

1258
01:07:54,636 --> 01:07:56,570
the address
on the front label.

1259
01:07:58,406 --> 01:07:59,874
Do you see anything?

1260
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,009
Is there anything
in there?

1261
01:08:05,013 --> 01:08:07,181
Oleg, what--
what's happening?

1262
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,621
Oleg, it's Dez. You want
to open up, please?

1263
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:14,722
Uhh!

1264
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,090
Oleg.

1265
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,558
Uhh!

1266
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,396
Ok. Oleg?

1267
01:08:22,464 --> 01:08:24,232
Unh.

1268
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:25,233
- Come on.
- Oleg?

1269
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,234
Oleg.
Oleg!

1270
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:27,434
What is--
what's going on?

1271
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:28,870
Oleg!

1272
01:08:28,937 --> 01:08:30,104
Just open the door.

1273
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:32,106
Mrs. Gazelle,
I got a bottle.

1274
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,540
So, now read me
the address.

1275
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:36,878
1456 Owens Park Lane,
Hoboken.

1276
01:08:36,945 --> 01:08:41,482
Oleg! Let's go!
Open the door!

1277
01:08:41,549 --> 01:08:43,951
Oleg?
Come on! Oleg!

1278
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,353
Jesus!

1279
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,758
Wake up, wake up.

1280
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,260
We got to go get Oleg.

1281
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:53,494
Come on,
put your coat on.

1282
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:54,628
I thought
he was in jail.

1283
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,468
Hey, homes.

1284
01:09:01,536 --> 01:09:03,271
I got
a busted headlight.

1285
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:05,306
Hey, Lester,
my man.

1286
01:09:05,373 --> 01:09:07,842
Ouch. Who got over
on you, bro?

1287
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,278
<i>Some puta who's
forwarding address</i>

1288
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:12,780
is gonna be in
10 different zip codes,

1289
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:14,548
all of 'em dumpsters.

1290
01:09:14,616 --> 01:09:16,818
Heh heh heh.
Ha ha ha!

1291
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:22,089
I got you covered
by tomorrow night.

1292
01:09:22,157 --> 01:09:25,293
Hey, check this out.
Is that sweet or what?

1293
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,528
Hey, a royal flush
put her in my pocket.

1294
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:29,396
300 cold
puts her in mine.

1295
01:09:29,464 --> 01:09:31,432
No, man.
She's a beauty.

1296
01:09:31,499 --> 01:09:33,767
Think I'm gonna
hold on to her.

1297
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,770
500.

1298
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,373
Heh.
I won't miss 'em--

1299
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,309
<i>not until
Cinco de Mayo.</i>

1300
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,023
Oh, Joe.
Shit!

1301
01:09:57,926 --> 01:09:59,393
I'm under a lot
of stress tonight,

1302
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,662
so whatever I say
don't count.

1303
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:05,599
Do I still have to go
to school tomorrow?

1304
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:08,802
I don't know.
We'll see.

1305
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:26,820
Remember me?

1306
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,322
Who in the fuck
are you?

1307
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,924
You got something
that belongs to me,

1308
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,092
a snub nose .38.

1309
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:32,659
You just scored it
off of Manny in a card game.

1310
01:10:32,727 --> 01:10:34,028
I need it back.

1311
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:38,866
Fuck.

1312
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,502
I want my fuckin' gun!

1313
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:44,138
Where the fuck
are you? Huh?

1314
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,374
Don't be fuckin' stupid.

1315
01:10:46,441 --> 01:10:47,875
Whoa! Fuck!

1316
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,677
Unh! Unh! Unh!

1317
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,882
Uhh! Uhh! Aah!

1318
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,050
Aah! Uhh!

1319
01:11:00,588 --> 01:11:01,588
Aah! Fuck!

1320
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,363
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1321
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,864
You fuck!

1322
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,599
You fuck! Where's
my fuckin' gat!

1323
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:13,667
Aah! Help me!

1324
01:11:13,735 --> 01:11:15,803
Where's my gun?
Where's my gat?

1325
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:17,638
You gonna fuckin' tell me
where my gun is now?

1326
01:11:17,705 --> 01:11:19,606
Tell me where I can find it,
or in about 30 seconds,

1327
01:11:19,674 --> 01:11:20,774
you're gonna have
third degree burns.

1328
01:11:20,842 --> 01:11:21,976
You know
what that means?

1329
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,210
No cock, asshole!

1330
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:24,979
You're gonna have
a fuckin' melted dick!

1331
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,880
I--I sold it
to a pimp, Lester!

1332
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,849
Say, what
you waitin' on?

1333
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:29,984
Where the fuck
can I find him?

1334
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:31,052
Where can I find him?

1335
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:32,286
I need to fuckin'
know now!

1336
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,221
Buckhill Cab,
Union Street!

1337
01:11:34,289 --> 01:11:35,389
Ask them!

1338
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,224
Aah! Aah!

1339
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:45,632
Stay here.
Do not move.

1340
01:11:55,643 --> 01:11:57,711
I'm not touching it.
Get away from me.

1341
01:11:57,779 --> 01:11:58,745
Fuck you!

1342
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,448
Ow! The little shit!
He just bit me!

1343
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,491
Who the hell
is that?

1344
01:12:11,559 --> 01:12:13,627
I'll go see.
Throw me my robe.

1345
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:15,129
Take the kids
into the bedroom.

1346
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,051
May I help you?

1347
01:12:37,118 --> 01:12:38,252
I'm looking for Oleg.

1348
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,254
Oleg? You must have
the wrong address.

1349
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:41,788
No. He's
a 10-year-old boy.

1350
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,523
He's pale.
He never smiles.

1351
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,259
He's my neighbor's kid.

1352
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,061
He called me
from this apartment.

1353
01:12:47,128 --> 01:12:49,563
Owens park Lane,
apartment 303.

1354
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,698
Well, he must've given
you the wrong address,

1355
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:53,000
or maybe
you heard wrong.

1356
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:54,235
There's no Oleg here.

1357
01:12:54,302 --> 01:12:56,737
He also said that he was
being held against his will.

1358
01:12:56,804 --> 01:12:59,006
That is ridiculous.
There's only my husband

1359
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:00,607
and my 2 children
inside--

1360
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:02,309
no one else.
And it's late.

1361
01:13:02,377 --> 01:13:04,311
Well, I'd like to take
a little look inside

1362
01:13:04,379 --> 01:13:05,645
just to satisfy
my curiosity.

1363
01:13:05,713 --> 01:13:07,181
This is absurd.
What are you suggesting?

1364
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:08,482
That I kidnapped Oleg?

1365
01:13:08,549 --> 01:13:09,884
Or you know what? I'm just
gonna call the police,

1366
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:11,752
and I'm gonna stand here
for the next half-hour

1367
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:12,953
waiting for them
to arrive

1368
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,454
when all's you got to do
is just let me in.

1369
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,426
If you must.

1370
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,076
Do you mind?

1371
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:38,012
Go right ahead.

1372
01:13:40,782 --> 01:13:42,950
The children's room
is on the right.

1373
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,518
They are asleep.

1374
01:13:44,585 --> 01:13:46,686
Please, go right in.

1375
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,266
Hello.

1376
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,935
Don't even ask.
It's too ridiculous.

1377
01:14:01,002 --> 01:14:04,104
Sorry. I'm really
embarrassed.

1378
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:05,806
Excuse me,
but I seriously doubt

1379
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:08,675
he's hiding in there.

1380
01:14:20,388 --> 01:14:21,956
What's through here?

1381
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:23,690
The playroom.

1382
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,729
Whoa. Wow.

1383
01:14:30,865 --> 01:14:32,866
You guys got your own little
Disneyland in here.

1384
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:34,734
Well, it's all about
the children,

1385
01:14:34,802 --> 01:14:38,238
and as you can see,
there's no Oleg.

1386
01:14:47,682 --> 01:14:50,117
I really hope
that you find him.

1387
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,453
You hear too many stories
these days.

1388
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,921
God only knows
if it were our children.

1389
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,691
Where are your children
photographs?

1390
01:14:57,758 --> 01:14:58,859
Excuse me?

1391
01:14:58,926 --> 01:15:00,961
Photographs.

1392
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,797
No photographs.

1393
01:15:03,865 --> 01:15:05,332
If they were
your children,

1394
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,102
you would have
at least one photograph

1395
01:15:08,169 --> 01:15:09,903
somewhere
in this apartment.

1396
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:11,005
This is ridiculous.

1397
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:12,306
We only just moved
into this place.

1398
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:13,573
Everything's in storage.

1399
01:15:13,641 --> 01:15:15,775
Now, I really must
ask you to leave.

1400
01:15:15,843 --> 01:15:18,145
I insist!

1401
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,646
Oleg?

1402
01:15:20,848 --> 01:15:22,649
What the hell
do you want me to do?

1403
01:15:22,717 --> 01:15:26,987
You let this bitch in here
in the first place.

1404
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:30,290
All right? Right. Ok.

1405
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:39,566
Oh, man. This is too much.

1406
01:15:39,634 --> 01:15:42,202
It's too much. It's like
some kind of a lure.

1407
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:43,603
You're making
a mistake.

1408
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:44,938
Tell her
to leave, Dez.

1409
01:15:45,006 --> 01:15:47,408
Ma'am, if you don't leave
right now...

1410
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:48,608
I'm calling
the police.

1411
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:50,577
Call 'em. Call 'em.
And be sure to mention

1412
01:15:50,645 --> 01:15:52,546
that you got 2 abducted
children in the next room.

1413
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:55,082
2 children who don't appear
in any photographs

1414
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,216
in this house.

1415
01:15:56,284 --> 01:15:57,284
This is insane.
Where is Oleg?

1416
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:58,985
How dare you suggest
that we--

1417
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,554
ohh.

1418
01:16:00,621 --> 01:16:02,822
Where's the boy?

1419
01:16:03,724 --> 01:16:05,825
Where is he?!

1420
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:20,974
Oh, God.

1421
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:25,045
Oh. You better pray
he's not dead. Oh.

1422
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:32,786
Back off, you sick fuck.

1423
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:38,192
Jesus.
Oh, God help me.

1424
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:41,628
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1425
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:48,302
I said back the fuck up,

1426
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:51,538
you sick, twisted,
motherfucking cunt!

1427
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:52,639
Oh.

1428
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,477
Holy God.

1429
01:16:56,544 --> 01:16:58,778
That's right.

1430
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:00,214
That's right. Breathe.
You're gonna be ok.

1431
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:01,482
You're gonna
breathe now, Oleg.

1432
01:17:01,549 --> 01:17:03,717
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

1433
01:17:03,784 --> 01:17:06,553
Just breathe.
That's right.

1434
01:17:08,055 --> 01:17:09,923
Ok.

1435
01:17:09,991 --> 01:17:12,092
Just cutting
through wire.

1436
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,728
Uhh. Uhh.

1437
01:17:17,064 --> 01:17:18,798
Back off!

1438
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:20,434
I said back off!

1439
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,902
I will blow you away!

1440
01:17:25,706 --> 01:17:28,708
Ok. Ok, get up.

1441
01:17:28,776 --> 01:17:30,043
Ok.

1442
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:31,811
Go to the bedroom,
get the 2 kids.

1443
01:17:31,879 --> 01:17:33,680
Bring them downstairs.
Nicky's there.

1444
01:17:33,748 --> 01:17:35,682
All right?
Wait with them. Ok?

1445
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,916
Move over.

1446
01:17:40,588 --> 01:17:42,689
Get out of his way.

1447
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,827
No, I've got a safe
in the bedroom.

1448
01:17:47,895 --> 01:17:49,996
There's 100,000 cash
in there in diamonds.

1449
01:17:50,064 --> 01:17:52,499
All you gotta do is
take the boy and walk away.

1450
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,681
Oh, my God.

1451
01:18:07,748 --> 01:18:09,049
Oh.

1452
01:18:09,116 --> 01:18:10,450
Oh, God.

1453
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:13,887
No. Oh...

1454
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:18,958
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1455
01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:20,360
Oh, my God.

1456
01:18:20,428 --> 01:18:21,961
Oh.

1457
01:18:22,029 --> 01:18:25,131
Oh, you sick fucks.

1458
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,800
You're right.
We're--we're sick.

1459
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:27,967
We are. We're sick.

1460
01:18:28,035 --> 01:18:29,436
This is really great.
This is gonna help us--

1461
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:30,504
give me your phone.

1462
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:31,572
Please. Yeah.

1463
01:18:31,639 --> 01:18:32,639
What are you doing?

1464
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:33,707
She wants the phone--

1465
01:18:33,774 --> 01:18:34,808
who are you calling?

1466
01:18:40,081 --> 01:18:42,782
911. What is
the nature of your emergency?

1467
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:45,385
I just heard shooting
across the hall.

1468
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:47,254
1456 Owens park Lane.

1469
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:48,822
What is your name,
ma'am?

1470
01:18:50,758 --> 01:18:52,359
You're not serious.

1471
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:00,900
Ok.

1472
01:19:00,968 --> 01:19:02,369
Ok.

1473
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:12,946
Hey. Hey, listen,
one of your cabs

1474
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:15,582
just picked up my brother
at Al's automotive.

1475
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,451
Yeah, well, listen--
listen to me.

1476
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,919
I was supposed
to pick him up,

1477
01:19:18,986 --> 01:19:20,521
but there's been
a family emergency.

1478
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:22,656
So what I need you to do
is I need you to find out

1479
01:19:22,723 --> 01:19:24,724
where the cab
dropped him off at.

1480
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:29,363
Yeah. Call me back.
My phone number's 555-7556.

1481
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:36,403
Hello? Yeah.

1482
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,172
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1483
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,540
Hey, calm down.

1484
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,954
What happened to your face?

1485
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:55,122
It's nothing.

1486
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,656
I need to talk
to you, Joe.

1487
01:19:56,724 --> 01:19:58,459
Later.
No. Now!

1488
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,627
Why couldn't you just have
taken the kid and left?

1489
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:02,829
Why couldn't you just have
taken the kid and left?!

1490
01:20:02,897 --> 01:20:06,266
I have never seen evil
before tonight, Joe.

1491
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:08,768
Real fucking evil.

1492
01:20:08,836 --> 01:20:10,270
Ok?

1493
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,740
And I know that's
not what I see

1494
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:14,975
when I look
in your eyes.

1495
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,477
That's a lot, t.

1496
01:20:16,544 --> 01:20:18,345
I'm trying to make
a point here!

1497
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:20,714
No, I know the point
you're trying to make!

1498
01:20:20,781 --> 01:20:23,650
I did not marry
an evil man, ok?

1499
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:26,253
I did not marry
an evil man.

1500
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,188
Shady, sleazy,

1501
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:29,923
mixed up with the wrong
kind of people,

1502
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,659
but definitely not evil.

1503
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:35,095
I know what you're
trying to say, t.

1504
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:37,297
Do you?!

1505
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:40,434
I hope so.
I have turned my back

1506
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,170
on a lot of things since
we've been married.

1507
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,805
My eyes are wide open
on this one.

1508
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,716
Nicky, go home
with your ma.

1509
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:58,585
Oleg, let's go
take a ride.

1510
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,536
What kind of music
do you listen to?

1511
01:21:15,603 --> 01:21:19,039
Huh? You listen
to that techno shit?

1512
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:23,109
You listen to rap music?
You like rap music?

1513
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:25,479
They don't have
what I listen to on the radio.

1514
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,913
Yeah, what's that?

1515
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:28,215
Kvasha.

1516
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:31,017
It's my mother's tape
from Russia.

1517
01:21:31,085 --> 01:21:33,820
What the fuck?
Kvasha?

1518
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,624
You're an American.
You weren't born in Russia.

1519
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,560
What are you listening
to that shit for?

1520
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:42,563
My mother said I started
in her belly in Russia.

1521
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,930
So I'm Russian.

1522
01:21:43,998 --> 01:21:44,998
You're not
a fuckin' Russian.

1523
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,300
You're an American.
You know that.

1524
01:21:46,367 --> 01:21:48,001
'Cause you were born in the
United States of America.

1525
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:49,536
You're an American.
You're an American.

1526
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:51,271
Say, "I'm an American."
You say it.

1527
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:54,040
Say, "I'm an American."
Say, "I'm an American."

1528
01:21:54,108 --> 01:21:55,275
I'm an American.

1529
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:56,810
You're an American.
You were born

1530
01:21:56,877 --> 01:21:58,144
in the fuckin'
United States of America.

1531
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:00,013
That makes you
an American.

1532
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:01,481
Listen to this.

1533
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:04,718
This guy right here

1534
01:22:04,785 --> 01:22:06,152
is gonna be warming up
the back seat for you

1535
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,287
when you're ready
to get laid.

1536
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,089
You mark my words.

1537
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,060
fuckin' kvasha.

1538
01:22:14,128 --> 01:22:15,161
Jesus Christ.

1539
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,563
You put me through
the ringer tonight.

1540
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:17,997
You know that,
don't you?

1541
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:20,467
Hmm?

1542
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,068
I won't say nothing.

1543
01:22:22,136 --> 01:22:23,370
Yeah, and what about
the cops?

1544
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,771
What'd you say to them?
What did you say to 'em?

1545
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:28,108
I told them I got the gun
from Steven Monroe's locker.

1546
01:22:28,175 --> 01:22:31,778
He doesn't go there no more.
Nicky told me to say that.

1547
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,614
Nicky told you
to say that?

1548
01:22:33,681 --> 01:22:35,115
Smart kid.

1549
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:36,583
He's my best friend.

1550
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:37,951
We're both gonna play
for the razors.

1551
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:40,920
Yeah. Hello?

1552
01:22:40,988 --> 01:22:42,989
Yeah, that was me.

1553
01:22:43,057 --> 01:22:44,891
The royal towers?
How long ago?

1554
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:46,960
All right, thanks.

1555
01:22:47,027 --> 01:22:48,228
All right, kid. Hold on.

1556
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,564
We're gonna reclaim some
stolen property here.

1557
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,120
Don't worry about it.

1558
01:23:14,188 --> 01:23:16,590
We're just gonna
sit tight for a while.

1559
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:18,925
You know, uh...

1560
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:23,830
I used to know this kid.

1561
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:28,902
His old man was a real
fuckin' piece of shit.

1562
01:23:30,938 --> 01:23:33,440
Always drunk.

1563
01:23:35,075 --> 01:23:37,611
Always smackin' him
and his mom around.

1564
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:42,882
This kid,
he takes his licks,

1565
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:45,985
and he waits this
old fuckin' prick out.

1566
01:23:46,053 --> 01:23:50,557
And on the morning
of his 14th birthday,

1567
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,626
he walks into
his old man's room

1568
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,093
with a baseball bat...

1569
01:23:57,398 --> 01:24:00,600
And he mark Mcgwires the fuckin'
living shit out of him.

1570
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:06,440
After that, the old man...

1571
01:24:06,507 --> 01:24:09,643
He can't even hold a spoon
without shaking.

1572
01:24:12,046 --> 01:24:14,381
He don't remember things
too good, either.

1573
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:16,616
He's neutralized.

1574
01:24:19,186 --> 01:24:21,488
Which is a good thing.

1575
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:24,791
4 more years Max.

1576
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:26,760
Maybe 3. If you
get some size early on,

1577
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,962
you'll be all right.
You just gotta hang in there.

1578
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:33,867
'Cause it's more money.

1579
01:24:33,934 --> 01:24:35,769
It's lonely at the top.

1580
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,104
I'm telling you,
this corporation...

1581
01:24:39,306 --> 01:24:40,907
Get your hands off
of Lester's property.

1582
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:41,941
That's my property.

1583
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:44,244
I'm sorry.

1584
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:45,545
All right,
you stay right there.

1585
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:46,680
Don't you move.

1586
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:49,949
Stay just like that.

1587
01:24:50,017 --> 01:24:51,084
Fuck.

1588
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,457
Jesus Christ.
Not now.

1589
01:24:59,927 --> 01:25:01,961
All right,
let's get in the car.

1590
01:25:04,297 --> 01:25:05,632
I can hide it for you.

1591
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,733
No, give it to me.

1592
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:09,235
They're gonna think
you got the .38.

1593
01:25:09,303 --> 01:25:11,271
They're gonna
frisk you.

1594
01:25:11,338 --> 01:25:12,672
Come on, give me
the fucking gun.

1595
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:25,552
Yo, Joe.

1596
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,220
Who you got there?

1597
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:33,293
He's one of them
Christmas elves.

1598
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,994
I found him hitchin' a ride
on broad street.

1599
01:25:35,062 --> 01:25:36,730
Heh heh heh heh heh.

1600
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:39,599
Joey's a funny
fuckin' guy, huh?

1601
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:41,334
Let me take
a guess, Joey--

1602
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,770
you were just about
to call us.

1603
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:45,104
That's pretty good.

1604
01:25:45,172 --> 01:25:47,040
You must have telepathy
or something.

1605
01:25:47,107 --> 01:25:50,343
Must. Give me
your piece.

1606
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:53,613
Think I'm fuckin' around
with you?

1607
01:25:55,883 --> 01:25:57,551
How about that, huh?

1608
01:25:57,618 --> 01:25:59,553
Cocked and ready to go.

1609
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,788
What are you,
fuckin' nervous, tough guy?

1610
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,660
You're gonna
follow us, Joey.

1611
01:26:08,195 --> 01:26:10,764
The kid'll ride
with us.

1612
01:26:27,114 --> 01:26:28,581
Stay the fuck
in the car.

1613
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:38,892
Yeah.

1614
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,995
Nah, nah.
I'm with him right now.

1615
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:43,897
Yeah, 100%.

1616
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,069
I fuckin' knew it.

1617
01:26:49,136 --> 01:26:51,204
Nah, don't worry
about it.

1618
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:53,473
I'm takin' care of this
motherfucker right now.

1619
01:27:00,447 --> 01:27:01,982
Come on,
what the fuck?

1620
01:27:02,049 --> 01:27:04,484
What, are you gonna
fuckin' whack me?

1621
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:07,020
Come on, man,
I fuckin' told you.

1622
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:08,721
You got any fuckin' doubts,
I'm fuckin' tellin' you--

1623
01:27:08,789 --> 01:27:09,789
shut your mouth.

1624
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:12,592
Shut your
fuckin' mouth now.

1625
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:15,561
You see, my old man,

1626
01:27:15,629 --> 01:27:19,165
he says to me,
"nobody...

1627
01:27:19,233 --> 01:27:20,833
Knows nobody."

1628
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,270
Man, you fuckin' put
that piece of shit away.

1629
01:27:23,337 --> 01:27:26,106
I fuckin' told you,
on my fuckin' family--

1630
01:27:26,173 --> 01:27:27,507
fuckin' family?
When I leave here,

1631
01:27:27,574 --> 01:27:29,175
I'm gonna fuck
Teresa in the ass.

1632
01:27:29,243 --> 01:27:30,510
That's how much
I give a fuck

1633
01:27:30,577 --> 01:27:31,744
about your
fuckin' family.

1634
01:27:31,812 --> 01:27:33,113
On my fuckin' family,

1635
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,847
it ain't
the fuckin' piece!

1636
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,616
Now, how fuckin' far
do we go back?

1637
01:27:36,683 --> 01:27:38,118
How fuckin' long
have we known each other?

1638
01:27:38,185 --> 01:27:40,120
Come on,
what the fuck?!

1639
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:41,454
This is bullshit!

1640
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:43,924
Like I said,
nobody...

1641
01:27:43,991 --> 01:27:46,092
Knows nobody.

1642
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:50,596
You fuckin' take
that shit off me--

1643
01:27:51,598 --> 01:27:52,665
not in front of
the fuckin' kid.

1644
01:27:52,733 --> 01:27:53,733
What kid?

1645
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:55,101
Not in front of
the fuckin'--

1646
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:56,736
you grab this fuckin'
gun out of my hand

1647
01:27:56,804 --> 01:27:57,837
one more time,

1648
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:59,306
I'm gonna blow
your fuckin' brains

1649
01:27:59,373 --> 01:28:00,407
all over
this fuckin' place,

1650
01:28:00,474 --> 01:28:01,874
and I'll fuck
that kid up

1651
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,077
right in front of you!
You got that, nigger?!

1652
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:06,879
Nobody knows nobody!
You got that?!

1653
01:28:12,619 --> 01:28:15,055
Shit! What the fuck?!

1654
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:16,389
Ha ha ha ha!

1655
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:17,958
Heh heh heh.
Oh, shit.

1656
01:28:18,025 --> 01:28:20,827
You see,
pop reached out

1657
01:28:20,894 --> 01:28:23,129
to a friend of ours
in the department,

1658
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:24,697
had him
pull the paper

1659
01:28:24,765 --> 01:28:26,967
on Rydell's
recent busts.

1660
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:28,534
Turns out
our friend sal here

1661
01:28:28,602 --> 01:28:30,170
was running his own
little thing

1662
01:28:30,237 --> 01:28:31,371
on the side.

1663
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:32,538
Hey, sal.

1664
01:28:32,606 --> 01:28:35,508
How's fuckin'
business, huh?

1665
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,711
A few weeks back,
sal gets bagged

1666
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:40,847
by Rydell
and his partners.

1667
01:28:40,914 --> 01:28:42,715
They let him walk...

1668
01:28:42,783 --> 01:28:46,853
As a situated
informant.

1669
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,589
We just got confirmation
10 minutes ago.

1670
01:28:49,656 --> 01:28:51,992
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Get the fuck up.

1671
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:54,827
Get the fuck up.

1672
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:57,364
Yeah.

1673
01:28:57,431 --> 01:28:59,232
Yeah.

1674
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,334
Oh, he's alone?

1675
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:04,004
Good. Give me
the fuckin' number.

1676
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,780
Have a Mai Tai
on me, guys.

1677
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,618
One nike gym bag--

1678
01:29:18,685 --> 01:29:20,220
60 bucks.

1679
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:29,662
Heh!

1680
01:29:31,565 --> 01:29:34,134
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1681
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:37,470
You motherfuckin'
Guinea cocksuckers.

1682
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:40,907
One Nokia cell phone--

1683
01:29:40,974 --> 01:29:42,308
100 bucks.

1684
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:49,715
You have just
fucked yourselves!

1685
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:51,884
One ounce Semtex--

1686
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:53,853
500 bucks.

1687
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,824
Gettin' rid
of a dirty cop--

1688
01:29:58,892 --> 01:30:00,760
heh heh heh heh.

1689
01:30:00,827 --> 01:30:04,164
Fuckin' priceless.

1690
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:05,331
Now...

1691
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:07,400
The jury's still out
on you, pal,

1692
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:08,568
so do me a favor.

1693
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:10,636
Get your ass in that car
and follow me.

1694
01:30:10,704 --> 01:30:12,638
And hey, hey.

1695
01:30:12,706 --> 01:30:14,207
Don't get lost.

1696
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:16,443
Where the fuck
we goin'?

1697
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:58,818
Uhh!

1698
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:13,700
Come on down,
come on down.

1699
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:22,508
Let him go.

1700
01:31:27,047 --> 01:31:29,448
So, Oleg...

1701
01:31:29,516 --> 01:31:32,085
You want to see
something really cool?

1702
01:31:32,152 --> 01:31:33,452
Hmm?

1703
01:31:39,259 --> 01:31:41,293
It's called a jet ice.

1704
01:31:41,361 --> 01:31:43,496
Black light paint.

1705
01:31:43,563 --> 01:31:46,733
You gotta do crazy shit
like this to fill the seats.

1706
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,042
Now, Oleg,

1707
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:59,345
this is
very serious matter.

1708
01:31:59,412 --> 01:32:02,248
This man--

1709
01:32:02,315 --> 01:32:06,185
he give you the gun
to shoot anzor?

1710
01:32:07,087 --> 01:32:09,255
Bullshit!
He gave it to you!

1711
01:32:09,322 --> 01:32:12,424
He told you to whack me!
Stop fucking protecting him!

1712
01:32:12,492 --> 01:32:16,495
You shut
the fuck up. Ah.

1713
01:32:16,563 --> 01:32:17,563
Ha ha ha ha!

1714
01:32:17,631 --> 01:32:20,833
Oleg,
you listen to me.

1715
01:32:20,901 --> 01:32:23,402
Where did you get gun?

1716
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:25,138
At school.

1717
01:32:25,205 --> 01:32:27,339
I found it
in a locker.

1718
01:32:27,407 --> 01:32:28,741
Don't you fuckin'
touch him!

1719
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:29,909
You don't
fuckin' touch him!

1720
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:31,177
Don't you fuckin'
touch him!

1721
01:32:31,244 --> 01:32:32,344
I'll fuckin'
kill you!

1722
01:32:32,412 --> 01:32:35,181
You shut the fuck up!
You turn is coming.

1723
01:32:35,248 --> 01:32:36,883
Oh, yeah? Well,
fuckin' eat me!

1724
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:38,617
<i>You fuckin' Vor
cocksucking bitch!</i>

1725
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:39,952
Fuck you!

1726
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:41,387
What you call me?

1727
01:32:41,454 --> 01:32:42,555
Nah, you fuckin'
heard me.

1728
01:32:42,622 --> 01:32:44,057
Fuck you,
you fuckin' bitch!

1729
01:32:44,124 --> 01:32:45,692
I'm impressed.

1730
01:32:45,759 --> 01:32:47,526
<i>You know Vor.</i>

1731
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,464
<i>Vor V'Zakoni.</i>

1732
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:55,902
The brotherhood.
If you were smart man,

1733
01:32:55,969 --> 01:32:58,838
you would learn
to fear this symbol.

1734
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:00,073
Yeah, well, fuck you,

1735
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,574
and fuck
your brotherhood, Boris,

1736
01:33:01,641 --> 01:33:03,442
'cause I don't have to
fuckin' answer to you!

1737
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:05,011
Fuck you!

1738
01:33:06,246 --> 01:33:07,914
You gonna let him muscle me
around like this, Frankie?

1739
01:33:07,981 --> 01:33:10,950
Well, we're just trying to
establish some truth here, Joe.

1740
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:12,218
I mean, to be honest,

1741
01:33:12,285 --> 01:33:14,187
I think the man's got
some grounds for inquiry.

1742
01:33:14,254 --> 01:33:16,388
No, that's fuckin' bullshit.
I told you,

1743
01:33:16,456 --> 01:33:17,890
I didn't give the kid
the fuckin' piece.

1744
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,125
Come on, Frankie!

1745
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:20,893
Oh, come on!
What the fuck, Frankie?!

1746
01:33:20,961 --> 01:33:23,129
I told you, I didn't
give him the fuckin' piece!

1747
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:24,764
Don't you let 'em hurt
the fuckin' kid, anzor!

1748
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:26,565
Don't you fuckin'
hurt the kid!

1749
01:33:27,968 --> 01:33:30,369
You fucks!
You fuckin' motherfuckers!

1750
01:33:30,437 --> 01:33:32,105
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

1751
01:33:32,172 --> 01:33:33,940
Ohh!

1752
01:33:34,007 --> 01:33:36,042
How's that feel,
Joey, huh?

1753
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,643
Aah! Aah!

1754
01:33:37,711 --> 01:33:39,445
Fuck you, Tommy!

1755
01:33:39,512 --> 01:33:41,881
Don't you do this, Frankie.

1756
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,149
Don't you do it!

1757
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:44,884
Don't you fuckin'
let 'em do this!

1758
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:46,385
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1759
01:33:46,453 --> 01:33:48,921
I'm not
fuckin' lying!

1760
01:33:48,989 --> 01:33:50,556
I'm not fuckin' lying!

1761
01:33:50,624 --> 01:33:52,658
Fuck!

1762
01:33:52,726 --> 01:33:54,493
Ohh!

1763
01:33:54,561 --> 01:33:56,595
Just tell 'em
what they want to know!

1764
01:33:57,664 --> 01:33:58,798
Uhh! Fuck!

1765
01:33:58,866 --> 01:34:00,833
I told you I didn't
know anything, Frankie!

1766
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,001
Fuck!

1767
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:04,470
Fuck!

1768
01:34:04,537 --> 01:34:06,172
Shit, it's a fuckin'
human hockey puck.

1769
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,706
I'm gonna fuckin'
kill you!

1770
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:09,041
Oh,
you're gonna kill me?

1771
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:10,209
You're gonna
fuckin' kill me?

1772
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:12,278
Aaah!

1773
01:34:12,345 --> 01:34:13,679
Give anzor the gun.

1774
01:34:13,747 --> 01:34:15,114
Frankie, don't you
fuckin' let 'em do this!

1775
01:34:15,182 --> 01:34:16,749
Kill the kid.

1776
01:34:18,018 --> 01:34:19,919
Christ.

1777
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:23,289
I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you!

1778
01:34:23,356 --> 01:34:27,426
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1779
01:34:27,494 --> 01:34:28,928
Don't you let them
do this, Frankie!

1780
01:34:28,996 --> 01:34:30,196
What do you
want me to do?

1781
01:34:30,264 --> 01:34:31,998
You brought it on
your goddamn self!

1782
01:34:32,065 --> 01:34:34,533
No. No. Wait, no!

1783
01:34:34,601 --> 01:34:35,567
Don't do it!

1784
01:34:35,635 --> 01:34:36,836
Joey...

1785
01:34:36,904 --> 01:34:39,205
I'll fuckin' talk!
I'll fuckin' tell you

1786
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:41,473
whatever you want
to fuckin' hear!

1787
01:34:41,541 --> 01:34:42,675
No, my friend!

1788
01:34:42,742 --> 01:34:44,476
First you will see
that I am serious.

1789
01:34:44,544 --> 01:34:45,978
Then afterwards,
believe me,

1790
01:34:46,046 --> 01:34:47,646
you will talk!

1791
01:34:47,714 --> 01:34:49,682
No, come on!
Jesus Christ! I'm fuckin'--

1792
01:34:49,749 --> 01:34:51,784
don't you--
I'll fuckin' talk!

1793
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:53,352
I'll tell you whatever
the fuck you want to hear,

1794
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,021
you fuckin' motherfuckers!

1795
01:34:55,088 --> 01:34:57,690
Finish it!
Do it right this time!

1796
01:34:58,725 --> 01:35:00,693
No, anzor!

1797
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,528
Anzor, look at me!
Don't fuckin' do it!

1798
01:35:02,595 --> 01:35:03,729
Shut up!

1799
01:35:03,797 --> 01:35:05,031
Uhh!

1800
01:35:05,098 --> 01:35:06,665
I said finish it.

1801
01:35:06,733 --> 01:35:07,867
Ha ha ha ha!

1802
01:35:07,935 --> 01:35:09,135
He's not your blood!

1803
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:11,070
Don't fuckin' do it.

1804
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:12,404
If you do it,
I swear to God,

1805
01:35:12,472 --> 01:35:14,073
you better fuckin'
swallow a bullet.

1806
01:35:14,141 --> 01:35:15,308
There's no fuckin' way

1807
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:16,742
you're gonna be able
to live with yourself!

1808
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:19,145
Trust me, anzor.
Don't do it!

1809
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:21,647
Say something bad
about the Duke.

1810
01:35:21,715 --> 01:35:24,917
Let me hear you
call him a faggot.

1811
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:26,352
Come on.

1812
01:35:26,419 --> 01:35:28,988
Don't do it!

1813
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,289
Say it.

1814
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:31,590
Ow.

1815
01:35:31,658 --> 01:35:33,259
Shoot him!

1816
01:35:56,783 --> 01:35:58,985
Ohh.

1817
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:02,922
What are you
fucking doing?!

1818
01:36:04,858 --> 01:36:06,926
Pick up
the fucking gun.

1819
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:09,862
Oh,
you pick it up.

1820
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:11,898
You do it.

1821
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:17,870
Gutless piece of
faggot shit!

1822
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:20,706
Come on, faggot!

1823
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:23,709
I said finish it!

1824
01:36:25,345 --> 01:36:28,281
Pick it up
and use it.

1825
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:32,952
Pick it up and do it.

1826
01:36:35,688 --> 01:36:38,291
Pick it up and do it.

1827
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:45,464
Don't you fucking
walk away from me!

1828
01:36:45,532 --> 01:36:47,199
Ohh.

1829
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:51,437
Uhh.

1830
01:37:00,814 --> 01:37:02,114
Uhh!

1831
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:07,553
Get up...

1832
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:09,422
You fuck.

1833
01:37:09,489 --> 01:37:11,290
Uhh. Uhh!

1834
01:37:11,358 --> 01:37:12,758
Uhh!

1835
01:37:14,394 --> 01:37:15,861
Aaaah!

1836
01:37:15,929 --> 01:37:17,964
Fucking bullshit.

1837
01:37:18,031 --> 01:37:19,865
Frank! Frank!

1838
01:37:19,933 --> 01:37:21,300
Fuck you, Frankie!

1839
01:37:21,368 --> 01:37:23,635
I ain't takin' the fuckin' heat
for you no more!

1840
01:37:23,703 --> 01:37:27,106
It wasn't supposed
to go down this way!

1841
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:28,274
What are you
talkin' about?

1842
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,776
The czar of Brighton.

1843
01:37:30,844 --> 01:37:33,079
<i>Vor whatever
the fuck you are.</i>

1844
01:37:33,146 --> 01:37:34,947
Fucking Perello
didn't like it

1845
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:37,549
that your nephew
was cookin' a dealer

1846
01:37:37,617 --> 01:37:38,917
in the neighborhood.

1847
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:40,353
So he said--

1848
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:43,022
he said, "well,
let's send him a message."

1849
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:45,291
He said,
"let's use the kid."

1850
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,160
Yogi, would I put
our thing in jeopardy

1851
01:37:48,228 --> 01:37:50,997
for some two-bit
fuckin' meth lab?

1852
01:37:51,064 --> 01:37:53,399
Think about it, ok?
That's number one.

1853
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:55,134
Number 2--

1854
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:57,470
I don't even live in
that fuckin' neighborhood!

1855
01:37:57,537 --> 01:37:59,305
What do I care
if it blows up?

1856
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:01,573
The gun--

1857
01:38:01,641 --> 01:38:03,542
it was Tommy's!

1858
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:04,943
You fuck!

1859
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:08,014
Tommy. Tommy,
don't get involved

1860
01:38:08,081 --> 01:38:09,548
in their
goddamn jackpot!

1861
01:38:09,616 --> 01:38:10,816
It's all bullshit!

1862
01:38:10,884 --> 01:38:12,784
He fuckin' put it
in my right hand!

1863
01:38:12,852 --> 01:38:15,921
A fuckin' snub nose .38,
stainless steel.

1864
01:38:15,989 --> 01:38:17,490
It was Tommy's gun!

1865
01:38:17,557 --> 01:38:19,158
You motherfucker.

1866
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:21,660
I told you to get rid
of that fuckin' piece.

1867
01:38:21,728 --> 01:38:23,762
Yeah, well, not to
my fuckin' recollection!

1868
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:25,831
He said,

1869
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:27,733
"interest the tweaker's kid
in the piece."

1870
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,601
That's what he said.

1871
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:31,770
"Interest the tweaker's kid
in the piece."

1872
01:38:31,838 --> 01:38:34,340
Ask the kid!

1873
01:38:34,408 --> 01:38:36,108
Ask the kid.

1874
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:39,711
Mister, 'cause he--
he gave me the gun.

1875
01:38:39,779 --> 01:38:41,414
He said I'd get to
go to the game

1876
01:38:41,481 --> 01:38:44,783
if--if I shot anzor...

1877
01:38:44,851 --> 01:38:46,718
And it would make
his friends happy.

1878
01:38:46,786 --> 01:38:48,887
I'm sorry, kid.

1879
01:38:48,955 --> 01:38:50,489
Ok. Ok.

1880
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:52,058
Fuck this bullshit.

1881
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:53,892
Fuck you, Joey!
Aah!

1882
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,461
You fuckin' bastard!
Aah!

1883
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:57,196
You're fuckin' dead,
nigger!

1884
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,598
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1885
01:38:59,666 --> 01:39:01,300
Aaah!

1886
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:03,135
Ohh!

1887
01:39:06,706 --> 01:39:07,873
Ohh!

1888
01:39:07,941 --> 01:39:09,475
I'm fuckin' shot!

1889
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:11,544
You dancin' bear
motherfucker!

1890
01:39:11,611 --> 01:39:12,778
<i>Fuckin' Vor!</i>

1891
01:39:12,845 --> 01:39:14,613
Uhh!

1892
01:39:14,681 --> 01:39:15,948
Ohh!

1893
01:39:16,015 --> 01:39:17,283
Scumbag!

1894
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:19,585
You Russian cocksucker.

1895
01:39:21,154 --> 01:39:22,121
Uhh!

1896
01:39:22,189 --> 01:39:23,255
Ohh!

1897
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:25,824
Uhh!

1898
01:39:27,194 --> 01:39:28,894
You son of a bitch!

1899
01:39:28,962 --> 01:39:31,230
Aaah!
Die!

1900
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:38,270
You die, motherfucker!

1901
01:39:39,906 --> 01:39:41,207
Where's the fuckin' gun?!

1902
01:39:41,274 --> 01:39:42,374
Ohh!

1903
01:39:53,686 --> 01:39:55,221
Uhh!

1904
01:39:55,288 --> 01:39:56,788
Uhh!

1905
01:39:56,856 --> 01:40:00,459
Aah!
Aah!

1906
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:02,261
Uhh!

1907
01:40:03,396 --> 01:40:04,763
Uhh!

1908
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:11,003
Mr. Gazelle!

1909
01:40:21,781 --> 01:40:23,516
Uhh!

1910
01:40:26,386 --> 01:40:27,453
Uhh!

1911
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,421
Fuck you.

1912
01:41:08,061 --> 01:41:10,329
Oh. Ohh.

1913
01:41:15,435 --> 01:41:16,569
Aah!

1914
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,874
Get off him, you fuck.

1915
01:41:22,942 --> 01:41:24,843
Do you know
you got my son killed,

1916
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:26,412
you fuckin' scumbag?!

1917
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:28,814
Aw, Frankie,
I'm glad it's you,

1918
01:41:28,881 --> 01:41:30,649
'cause there's
somethin' I've been--

1919
01:41:30,717 --> 01:41:32,784
I've really been meaning
to get off my chest.

1920
01:41:32,852 --> 01:41:37,055
You rat cocksucker.
All this fuckin' time?!

1921
01:41:37,123 --> 01:41:38,657
Yeah, this whole
fuckin' time!

1922
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,559
This whole fuckin' time!

1923
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:42,127
And the only thing
we don't have

1924
01:41:42,195 --> 01:41:43,895
is your finger on the trigger,
so fuckin' do me!

1925
01:41:43,963 --> 01:41:45,097
And it's one more nail
in your coffin.

1926
01:41:45,164 --> 01:41:47,065
Oh, you got
all that, do you?

1927
01:41:47,133 --> 01:41:50,035
How come it took you
so fuckin' long, tough guy?

1928
01:41:50,103 --> 01:41:52,938
Huh? How come
so fuckin' long?! Tell me!

1929
01:41:53,005 --> 01:41:55,241
You had to climb in bed
with yugorsky, didn't you?

1930
01:41:55,308 --> 01:41:56,609
I was all but out,

1931
01:41:56,676 --> 01:41:59,545
and you had to go mix up
with the fuckin' Russians.

1932
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:01,012
12 years undercover,

1933
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,881
and my own wife
don't even fuckin' know!

1934
01:42:02,949 --> 01:42:05,451
Oh, you cocksucker.
You don't have to worry.

1935
01:42:06,786 --> 01:42:08,153
She ain't never
gonna hear it

1936
01:42:08,221 --> 01:42:09,688
from your
fuckin' lips anyhow,

1937
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:11,724
you fuckin' scumbag!

1938
01:42:11,791 --> 01:42:12,791
Uhh!

1939
01:42:12,859 --> 01:42:14,192
I'll tell her
all about it

1940
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:16,328
while she sucks
my fuckin' dick!

1941
01:42:23,703 --> 01:42:24,870
Heh heh.

1942
01:42:24,937 --> 01:42:27,640
Aw, come on.
Come on!

1943
01:42:27,707 --> 01:42:30,008
Are you fuckin'
kiddin' me?

1944
01:42:30,076 --> 01:42:32,645
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1945
01:42:33,713 --> 01:42:35,648
What are you gonna do
with that, little boy?

1946
01:42:35,715 --> 01:42:37,215
Do you know that
I had a little boy?

1947
01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:40,519
My Tommy. At one time,
he was your age.

1948
01:42:40,587 --> 01:42:42,354
What are you gonna do
with that, kid?

1949
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:43,722
What are you gonna do
with that?

1950
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,291
What are you gonna do
with that,

1951
01:42:45,358 --> 01:42:47,760
you cheerio-bred
little motherfucker?!

1952
01:42:47,827 --> 01:42:49,961
Uhh! Aah!

1953
01:43:09,382 --> 01:43:11,317
Let's go home.

1954
01:43:46,219 --> 01:43:47,820
In position!

1955
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:50,556
All right, Johnny!
On the other side! Let's go!

1956
01:43:58,832 --> 01:44:00,966
Jesus Christ, Joey.
We got shorted out.

1957
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:02,234
We lost you
back at Newark.

1958
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:03,535
Last thing we heard,

1959
01:44:03,603 --> 01:44:04,937
you were headed
for little Odessa.

1960
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:07,639
Air support finally
made your mustang.

1961
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:10,910
I'm taking the kid
home to his mom.

1962
01:44:10,977 --> 01:44:12,377
Joey, where you going?

1963
01:44:12,445 --> 01:44:15,848
You're hurt. We got to
get you to a hospital.

1964
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:19,384
I'm going home.

1965
01:44:32,665 --> 01:44:34,633
What are you
thinking?

1966
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:36,602
I don't want
to go home.

1967
01:44:36,669 --> 01:44:38,738
Well, I'm next door
to you, remember,

1968
01:44:38,805 --> 01:44:41,540
and I'm gonna be
keeping my eye on you.

1969
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,048
Why don't we get
some breakfast

1970
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:50,415
before we have to
start making

1971
01:44:50,483 --> 01:44:51,884
with the heavy
explaining.

1972
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:54,220
Get ourselves
cleaned up a bit.

1973
01:45:20,446 --> 01:45:21,781
Hey, listen.

1974
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:25,918
I'm taking Nick to the game
on Friday night.

1975
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:28,754
Maybe we could find you
another ticket.

1976
01:45:31,391 --> 01:45:33,926
If you'd like to go,
that is.

1977
01:45:45,906 --> 01:45:49,208
All right,
that's good.

1978
01:45:49,276 --> 01:45:51,177
You want to get some more
orange juice or something?

1979
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:00,585
Right.

1980
01:46:02,555 --> 01:46:04,290
Well, uh...

1981
01:46:04,357 --> 01:46:06,625
What do you say
we get out of here?

1982
01:46:20,073 --> 01:46:21,874
Well, lookie, lookie,

1983
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:24,543
if it ain't little
Charlie Bronson.

1984
01:46:26,746 --> 01:46:27,880
One thing about Lester,

1985
01:46:27,948 --> 01:46:30,149
he always makes good
on a promise.

1986
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,817
Hey, asshole.

1987
01:46:33,954 --> 01:46:35,754
Aah!
Fuck! Motherfucker!

1988
01:46:35,822 --> 01:46:36,989
Shoot that fuck!

1989
01:46:38,124 --> 01:46:39,325
Fuck him up!

1990
01:46:39,392 --> 01:46:41,026
Fuckin' piece of shit!

1991
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:42,027
Plug that asshole!

1992
01:46:42,095 --> 01:46:44,096
Unh! Cocksucker!

1993
01:46:44,164 --> 01:46:46,265
Oh, shit!

1994
01:46:46,333 --> 01:46:48,167
In your face,
motherfucker!

1995
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:49,969
Aah!

1996
01:46:53,673 --> 01:46:55,875
Say hello to my little friend.

1997
01:46:55,942 --> 01:46:58,710
Heh. That's real
fuckin' original.

1998
01:46:58,778 --> 01:47:00,512
What are you,
a fuckin' cartoon?

1999
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:03,582
I'm a mack daddy pimp.
You know that.

2000
01:47:03,649 --> 01:47:05,951
And now I'm gonna
cap your ass.

2001
01:47:06,019 --> 01:47:07,686
And when I'm
finished with you,

2002
01:47:07,754 --> 01:47:09,688
I'm gonna take
your little punk friend,

2003
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:12,224
and I'm gonna
put him in my posse,

2004
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:14,626
and I'm gonna pimp him out
for a couple of months.

2005
01:47:14,694 --> 01:47:16,295
And then I'm gonna take
that knife of yours,

2006
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:18,097
and I'm gonna cut him
from ear to ear,

2007
01:47:18,164 --> 01:47:20,632
just like I should've done
yesterday, you fuck!

2008
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:21,967
I'm sure that
sounds great to you

2009
01:47:22,035 --> 01:47:23,402
all in your fuckin'
pimp world and all,

2010
01:47:23,469 --> 01:47:24,770
but, listen, right now,

2011
01:47:24,837 --> 01:47:26,471
that's not the fuckin'
thing you want to do!

2012
01:47:26,539 --> 01:47:28,140
You want to put down
that fuckin' gun,

2013
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:29,441
and you want
to walk away,

2014
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:30,575
'cause I swear
to fuckin' God

2015
01:47:30,643 --> 01:47:31,944
I'll fuckin' kill you,

2016
01:47:32,012 --> 01:47:33,412
you stupid fuckin'
pimp bitch!

2017
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:34,880
Wrong!

2018
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:37,016
Only one of us
is walking out of here.

2019
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:38,017
Guess who?

2020
01:47:38,084 --> 01:47:39,551
Oleg, get behind me.

2021
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:43,555
Oleg, get behind me!

2022
01:47:46,492 --> 01:47:49,295
Heh heh heh heh.

2023
01:48:04,945 --> 01:48:06,645
Come on.

2024
01:48:06,712 --> 01:48:08,747
Oleg, talk to me.
Come on.

2025
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:10,449
Ok, gotta
make it home now.

2026
01:48:10,516 --> 01:48:11,583
Gotta make it home.

2027
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:13,118
Joey, please.
You're bleeding.

2028
01:48:13,186 --> 01:48:14,686
I got some, see?
I got some.

2029
01:48:14,754 --> 01:48:16,521
Come on! Fuck!

2030
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:19,258
Fuck!

2031
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:20,459
Look out!

2032
01:48:37,577 --> 01:48:39,744
Mr. Gazelle,
stop the car.

2033
01:48:39,812 --> 01:48:41,113
We need to get
some help.

2034
01:48:41,181 --> 01:48:42,547
Come on.
Got to meet t.

2035
01:48:42,615 --> 01:48:43,682
Please,
Mr. Gazelle!

2036
01:48:43,749 --> 01:48:44,716
I'm coming home!

2037
01:49:01,767 --> 01:49:03,502
Mr. Gazelle, please,
stop the car.

2038
01:49:03,569 --> 01:49:04,736
We need to get
some help.

2039
01:49:04,804 --> 01:49:05,737
What's happened?

2040
01:49:05,805 --> 01:49:07,473
You're hurt!

2041
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:08,607
We're gonna
make it home.

2042
01:49:08,674 --> 01:49:09,708
Stop the car.

2043
01:49:09,775 --> 01:49:11,310
Uhh! Uhh!

2044
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:13,145
You're bleeding!

2045
01:49:25,492 --> 01:49:27,726
Oh, God.

2046
01:49:27,793 --> 01:49:29,461
Oh, God.

2047
01:49:30,463 --> 01:49:32,898
Nicky, stay back,
stay back!

2048
01:49:38,271 --> 01:49:39,538
Mila.

2049
01:49:39,605 --> 01:49:41,106
Joey!

2050
01:49:41,174 --> 01:49:44,510
Joey, please!
Stop!

2051
01:49:44,577 --> 01:49:48,047
Mr. Gazelle,
come on, wake up!

2052
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:55,854
Mr. Gazelle, wake up!
Come on!

2053
01:49:55,922 --> 01:49:58,057
Stop the car,

2054
01:49:58,124 --> 01:49:59,525
Please! Stop!

2055
01:50:00,493 --> 01:50:01,527
Joe! Come on!

2056
01:50:01,594 --> 01:50:03,095
Something's wrong!
Let's go!

2057
01:50:03,163 --> 01:50:05,064
Aah!

2058
01:50:05,131 --> 01:50:06,532
Aah! Joe!

2059
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:07,966
Joe!

2060
01:50:11,003 --> 01:50:13,372
Oleg, wait, wait!

2061
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,474
God.
Mom!

2062
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:16,475
Mom!

2063
01:50:16,543 --> 01:50:19,044
Joe!
Mom!

2064
01:50:20,947 --> 01:50:22,581
Uhh, uhh, uhh!
Fuck!

2065
01:50:22,648 --> 01:50:25,317
Nicky, call 911!

2066
01:50:25,385 --> 01:50:28,019
Oh, don't do this
to me, Joe.

2067
01:50:28,088 --> 01:50:29,388
Don't fucking
do this to me.

2068
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:30,956
Oh, sweetheart...

2069
01:50:31,023 --> 01:50:33,192
I loved you, ok?

2070
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:36,995
Just remember I was always
stuck with Joey. Ok?

2071
01:50:37,063 --> 01:50:38,297
Only once did I lie.

2072
01:50:38,364 --> 01:50:40,732
Shut up, shut up.
Look at me, look at me.

2073
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,334
Hey, baby,
look me in the eye.

2074
01:50:42,402 --> 01:50:43,868
Joey,
look me in the eyes.

2075
01:50:43,936 --> 01:50:45,937
I don't care, ok?
It doesn't matter.

2076
01:50:46,005 --> 01:50:48,140
Whatever it is, I'm gonna
kick your ass over it later.

2077
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:49,774
Stay with me, Joe.
Stay--look at me.

2078
01:50:49,842 --> 01:50:51,110
Look at me.
I'm right here.

2079
01:50:51,177 --> 01:50:52,111
I'm right here for you.

2080
01:50:52,178 --> 01:50:53,378
Nicky!

2081
01:50:53,446 --> 01:50:54,513
Nicky, come here!

2082
01:50:54,581 --> 01:50:56,448
Nicky! Nicky!

2083
01:50:56,516 --> 01:50:57,716
He's right here.
He's right here.

2084
01:50:57,783 --> 01:50:58,817
They're coming.
They're on their way.

2085
01:50:58,884 --> 01:51:00,185
Ok.

2086
01:51:00,253 --> 01:51:02,187
We're still going
to the game

2087
01:51:02,255 --> 01:51:03,489
Friday night,
right, dad?

2088
01:51:03,556 --> 01:51:05,324
I love you, Nick!
Aah!

2089
01:51:05,391 --> 01:51:08,460
Ok, he wants--he wants
to go to the game, baby.

2090
01:51:08,528 --> 01:51:11,096
Yeah. We're gonna
go to the game.

2091
01:51:11,164 --> 01:51:12,431
We're gonna fuckin' kick
their asses, right, mom?

2092
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:15,601
They are going down
big fucking time!

2093
01:51:15,668 --> 01:51:17,569
You--you have
a bad mouth.

2094
01:51:17,637 --> 01:51:18,703
Ha ha!

2095
01:51:18,771 --> 01:51:20,139
Yep. Yep.

2096
01:51:22,408 --> 01:51:24,676
It's not that bad.
You'll be ok.

2097
01:51:24,744 --> 01:51:26,245
Joe.

2098
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:29,248
Ahh. Unh.

2099
01:51:31,417 --> 01:51:32,817
I'm right here.

2100
01:51:32,885 --> 01:51:35,787
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

2101
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:39,057
Joe. Joe!

2102
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:41,593
Joe?

2103
01:51:41,661 --> 01:51:43,195
Joe. Oh, God,
no, don't!

2104
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:48,300
Oh, God, no!

2105
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:51,436
Oh, God! Joe!

2106
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:58,443
Keep the kid outside.

2107
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:00,111
I don't want him
going in there.

2108
01:52:02,982 --> 01:52:05,217
Keep that boy over there.
We got to move in.

2109
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:07,986
This guy's C.P.T.
Come on, let's move.

2110
01:52:59,339 --> 01:53:00,606
Louise.

2111
01:53:00,673 --> 01:53:02,341
Louise.

2112
01:53:04,244 --> 01:53:06,712
Good girl.
How's it going?

2113
01:53:08,314 --> 01:53:09,981
George...

2114
01:53:10,049 --> 01:53:11,550
The alternator's
in the car.

2115
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:13,552
All right.

2116
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:21,393
Don't ever ask me
to bury you again, Joe.

2117
01:53:29,068 --> 01:53:30,902
Mmm.

2118
01:53:37,009 --> 01:53:38,843
Oh. Hey.

2119
01:53:38,911 --> 01:53:41,012
So, what did they put
in that coffin really?

2120
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,046
What?

2121
01:53:42,114 --> 01:53:43,081
What did they put
in that coffin?

2122
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:44,115
What'd they put
in the coffin?

2123
01:53:44,183 --> 01:53:45,150
Yeah.

2124
01:53:45,217 --> 01:53:46,184
Why? Did it seem
kind of heavy?

2125
01:53:46,252 --> 01:53:47,218
Yeah!

2126
01:53:47,287 --> 01:53:48,920
I don't know.
I'm thinking, uh...

2127
01:53:48,988 --> 01:53:50,622
Probably a couple
of blue shirts.

2128
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:53,592
Must've been
Lashaub and McCall.

2129
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:54,726
That sound good?

2130
01:53:54,794 --> 01:53:55,727
And Cavin.

2131
01:53:55,795 --> 01:53:57,162
And Cavin? You want
some of this, too?

2132
01:53:57,229 --> 01:53:58,229
For sure, Marishka.

2133
01:53:58,298 --> 01:53:59,864
Marishka? You want
some of this, too?

2134
01:53:59,932 --> 01:54:01,400
I'm gonna check
the both of you right now,

2135
01:54:01,467 --> 01:54:02,967
right in this house.
How about that?

2136
01:54:03,035 --> 01:54:04,403
Grab his head.

2137
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:06,271
Ha ha!
