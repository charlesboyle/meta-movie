1
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,530
Ladies and Gentlemen,
here she is now.

2
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:28,540
Let's get together
and meet that very delightful,

3
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:31,406
that sultry siren of the southland,

4
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:34,639
the lovely Bettie Page.

5
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:36,375
<i>( crowd applauding )</i>

6
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:40,518
<i>( '50s beach music playing )</i>

7
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:54,094
Who are you?

8
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,102
I'm an illusion.

9
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:59,229
You're an illusion?

10
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,035
Then you're not real?

11
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:04,542
Of course, I'm real.

12
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:06,612
It is very difficult

13
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:10,740
to find a parallel for her.

14
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:14,582
I mean, this combination of...

15
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:16,622
<i>naughty and nice.</i>

16
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:21,319
<i>And it is all</i>
<i>in the context of innocence.</i>

17
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:24,192
She expressed sexual liberation.

18
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:27,425
Bettie is still this subversive,

19
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:30,628
<i>adventurous, sexual persona</i>

20
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:32,762
<i>that people are trying to emulate.</i>

21
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:34,773
I think it's like the confusion

22
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,400
between maybe the real person

23
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:40,173
and the artwork and the cartoons,

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,577
like all of these--

25
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:44,275
it's sort of confusing even
whether she was a real person or not.

26
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,217
People love Bettie Page
for her whole being

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,084
for the radiance that she exuded,

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,920
the sexuality that she showed

29
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:56,052
without being cheap, ever.

30
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:58,654
And women gravitated to that concept.

31
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,097
The remarkable thing about her image is

32
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,998
how much it has influenced pop culture

33
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:06,368
from movies to music
to fashion. It's remarkable.

Perez Hilton: <i>One of the things</i>
<i>that I love about her iconography</i>

37
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:52,448
is that she just portrayed
herself as a very strong woman,

38
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:55,385
even if she was not
in the position of power.

39
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,218
( women scream )

40
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,686
She's lasted because
she has that rare quality

41
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:06,197
that's sort of hard to define,
it's that sort of ultimate star quality.

42
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,726
I feel like a lot of girls like me

43
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,429
can identify with Bettie

44
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,404
<i>because you can</i>
<i>kind of capture the spirit</i>

45
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:18,444
<i>of that sexy, sensual, timeless look.</i>

46
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:23,747
She looks fantastic
and I think that's what men prefer.

47
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,722
I don't think men prefer
the really skinny, bones thin women.

48
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:33,759
I think Bettie Page is a real woman.

49
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,294
I mean she have form, boobs,

50
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:39,524
butt, and that's very beautiful.

51
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:45,765
I gave her a lot of credit because
she opened the door for a lot of us.

52
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,770
She's the most important glamour icon

53
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:54,904
that she really
paved the way for all the rest.

54
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:02,251
And she's beautiful
but yet she's approachable,

55
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,822
<i>she's the girl next door.</i>

56
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:06,620
Bettie Page is the good girl
but she's a bad girl.

57
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,523
<i>She's fun, she's playful.</i>

58
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,357
All right, bitch, bring it.

59
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,960

61
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,202
Oh, st-- ah!

62
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:23,674
I mean, she's the reason why
we're all here today

63
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,039
in a sense is because of her,

64
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:28,444
I mean, she's the original pinup girl,
she's the original.

65
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:30,641
We're all going to be dust,

66
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,377
they'll be nothing else anymore,

67
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:35,352
and there'll always be
Bettie Page no matter what.

68
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,854
She had the magic.

69
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,549
She was deeply religious.

70
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,991
She was willing to do
all kinds of crazy outrageous things.

71
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:45,087
There's some rather large skeletons
in that woman's closet.

72
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:47,894
How do you reconcile that behavior

73
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:53,200
with the image that she projects
in these photographs?

74
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:57,106
She reached the peak of popularity
in her profession and disappeared.

75
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,236
Nobody knew
what happened to Bettie Page.

Bettie, if you know what's going on,

79
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:10,733
I want to tell you this is your friend
Robert Schuller saying,

80

Let us rejoice and be glad in it."

<i>We all thought we knew her</i>
<i>from different perspectives,</i>

83
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:28,624
but I'm sure no one
will leave this place today

84
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,719
without having had another glimpse

85
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,426

<i>I'll just ask you some questions.</i>

Mark: <i>You were born in Nashville, right?</i>

89
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,646
Bettie: <i>I was born</i>
<i>in Nashville, Tennessee,</i>

90
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:53,150
<i>April 22nd, 1923.</i>

91
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,155
<i>We were so poor, we lived on beans,</i>

92
00:07:57,257 --> 00:08:00,124
<i>fried potatoes, and macaroni.</i>

93
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:03,195
<i>You couldn't talk to Mama,</i>

94
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:06,788
<i>she didn't want</i>
<i>any girls in the first place.</i>

95
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,926
<i>She always wanted only two boys.</i>

96
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:14,537
<i>My father was</i>
<i>a womanizer of the worst sort.</i>

97
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:17,109
<i>A sex fiend is the way to put it.</i>

98
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,738
<i>I mean sex with anything that</i>
<i>he could get his "you know what" into.</i>

99
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:26,581
<i>Chickens, and sheep,</i>
<i>and cows, and anything.</i>

100
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:29,382
<i>And in order to get 10 cents</i>
<i>to go to the movies,</i>

101
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,787
<i>I let him fool around on the outside.</i>

102
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:36,021
<i>Now, he didn't penetrate me inside</i>
<i>like he did my two sisters.</i>

103
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:43,001
<i>Mama left him and hitchhiked</i>
<i>30 miles to Nashville</i>

104
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,093
<i>with six children,</i>

105
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:47,503
<i>and she was uneducated,</i>
<i>only a third grade education,</i>

106
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,507
<i>she had no trade at all,</i>

107
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:52,203
<i>and she couldn't take care</i>
<i>of all six of us children,</i>

108
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:56,043
<i>so my two sisters and I were put</i>
<i>in a Protestant orphanage for a year.</i>

109
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:02,120
<i>The orphanage was run</i>
<i>by three old maids.</i>

110
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:07,057
<i>They would talk to us like dogs,</i>
<i>they were very mean to us,</i>

111
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,560
<i>and they had me</i>
<i>scrubbing floors all the time.</i>

112
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,994
<i>I was only 11 years old then.</i>

113
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:16,458
<i>We just hated that place.</i>

114
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:19,367
<i>I was so glad to get out of there.</i>

115
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,509
<i>I learned to pose</i>
<i>from movie star pictures</i>

116
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:30,412
<i>in magazines and newspapers.</i>

117
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:37,579
<i>And my sisters and I</i>
<i>would try to mimic their poses.</i>

118
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,751
<i>We'd even get out in the front yard</i>
<i>with our underwear on.</i>

<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

120
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,760
<i>I had several photographers</i>

121
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,596
<i>and amateur photographers</i>

122
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,260
<i>come up</i>
<i>and approach me and ask me</i>

123
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:54,863
<i>if they could take pictures of me,</i>
<i>I always said yes.</i>

124
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,438
<i>My dream when I was in high school</i>
<i>was to be Valedictorian,</i>

125
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:05,449
<i>and I studied so hard</i>
<i>trying to be Valedictorian</i>

126
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:11,251
<i>because with it was a four year</i>
<i>scholarship to Vanderbilt University.</i>

127

<i>by one-quarter of a point now,</i>

129
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:20,464
<i>can you imagine, and I had to settle</i>
<i>for being Salutatorian.</i>

130
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:23,262
<i>And all I got</i>
<i>was a $100 scholarship</i>

131
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:26,031
<i>to George Peabody College</i>
<i>for Teachers.</i>

132
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:31,702
<i>After high school,</i>
<i>I started dating Billy Neal.</i>

133
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:36,009
<i>He was a big sports hero around town.</i>

134
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:38,049
<i>And he taught me to dance,</i>

<i>which I've always loved.</i>

136
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,520
<i>And he taught me</i>
<i>everything about sex too,</i>

137

<i>which I enjoyed.</i>

138
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,821
<i>Well, when the war came on,</i>

139
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:55,423
<i>he was drafted one day into the army,</i>

140
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:59,403
<i>and he started bugging me</i>
<i>about marrying him.</i>

141

<i>30 miles to Galliton, Tennessee,</i>

143
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:07,345
<i>and were married in five minutes.</i>

144

<i>And when I got on the bus</i>
<i>to go back with him,</i>

145
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:15,312
<i>I said to myself, "What have I done?"</i>

146
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,754
<i>Well, we were in San Francisco, 1 944.</i>

<i>to look like Joan Crawford.</i>

154
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:51,480

<i>Within two months,</i>
<i>I ballooned way up to 162 pounds.</i>

172
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,764
<i>Well, my sister came to visit me,</i>

173
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,632
<i>Goldie, from Nashville.</i>

174
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,969
<i>She said that the landlord,</i>
<i>he had cussed her out</i>

175
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:44,703
<i>and accused her of causing</i>

176
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:48,804
<i>the sink in the bathroom</i>
<i>to fall off the wall.</i>

177
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:51,748
<i>I went to the door,</i>
<i>and boy, he flew in on me,</i>

178
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:55,548
<i>beating me in the face</i>
<i>with his fist, just a mad man.</i>

179
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:59,216
<i>And Goldie grabbed the milk bottle</i>
<i>and cracked him over the head with it.</i>

180
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,850
<i>And he started bleeding</i>
<i>down the front of his head,</i>

181
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,260
<i>and he thought</i>
<i>he was dying, and we did too.</i>

182
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:08,128
<i>Because Goldie was underage,</i>

183
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:12,000
<i>under 21,</i>
<i>I'm the one who had to testify,</i>

184
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,370
<i>even though I'm not the one</i>
<i>who hit him over the head.</i>

185
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:20,412
<i>But they gave me a 30-day suspended</i>
<i>sentence and I had to pay 10 dollars,</i>

186
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:24,244
<i>and it was in the paper,</i>
<i>a great big picture of me</i>

187
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,116
<i>and a big headline,</i>
<i>"Tenant Bashes Landlord".</i>

188
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,552
<i>( Bettie chuckles )</i>

189
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:38,556
<i>Well, Billy came back</i>
<i>from fighting overseas.</i>

190
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,598
<i>He had battle fatigue,</i>
<i>you know, he was in the hospital,</i>

191
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,033
<i>in the army hospital</i>
<i>in Guam for about six months.</i>

192
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,662
<i>When he came home,</i>
<i>he wasn't the same guy.</i>

193
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,899
<i>He was a jealous maniac.</i>

194
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:52,876
<i>Accused me of sleeping</i>
<i>with every sailor in San Francisco,</i>

195
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,913
<i>and he went off the deep end.</i>

196
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:58,347
<i>So I tried so hard to make a go of it</i>
<i>with him but it was impossible.</i>

197
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:01,011
<i>We were sitting in the kitchen,</i>

198
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,315
<i>and he had a knife right at my throat,</i>

199
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:06,323
<i>he was gonna cut me with it</i>
<i>if I divorced him.</i>

200
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:09,417
<i>I went ahead</i>
<i>and divorced him anyhow.</i>

201
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,961
<i>When I went to New York,</i>
<i>I was getting over</i>

202
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:20,300
<i>my divorce from Billy Neal</i>
<i>and the miserable marriage.</i>

203
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:25,137
<i>I liked all the lights on Broadway.</i>

204
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:28,042
<i>And I liked Central Park.</i>

205
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:33,676
<i>All I paid for my apartment</i>
<i>on West 46th Street,</i>

206
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:39,019
<i>46 dollars and 29 cents a month.</i>

207
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,094
<i>I used to go</i>
<i>to the Roseland ballroom.</i>

208
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:45,426
<i>And then I went dancing so much.</i>

209
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:48,523
<i>I was a movie fiend in those days.</i>

210
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,194
<i>Didn't cost much of anything,</i>
<i>40 or 50 cents,</i>

211
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,704
<i>something like that,</i>
<i>to see a double feature.</i>

212
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:58,869
<i>One night, I was very lonely,</i>

213
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:03,847
<i>and I was walking along Broadway,</i>
<i>and a good looking fella came up</i>

214
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,043
<i>and started talking to me,</i>
<i>introduced himself.</i>

215
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:09,883
<i>He was very polite and courteous,</i>
<i>seemed like a very nice fella.</i>

216
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:12,457
<i>He asked me,</i>
<i>"Would like to go dancing?"</i>

217
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,958
<i>I said, "Sure, I'd love to go. "</i>

218
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:16,653
<i>So we got in the car,</i>

219
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,127
<i>and he and I sat in the back,</i>

220
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,291
<i>and the girlfriend</i>
<i>and the boyfriend driving.</i>

221
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,302
<i>Well, we stopped at a red light,</i>
<i>and two guys jumped in the car.</i>

222
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:26,996
<i>We went farther on,</i>

223
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,802
<i>two more fellas got in the car.</i>

224
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:33,504
<i>But when it hit me,</i>
<i>a big pain shot through me</i>

225
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,376
<i>as we crossed that bridge and I thought,</i>

226
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:37,779
<i>"We are not going dancing. "</i>

227
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:43,017
<i>You can imagine</i>
<i>how you would have felt then</i>

228
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:47,058
<i>with six men in the car</i>
<i>and the two women.</i>

229
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,327
<i>The guy in front and his girlfriend</i>

230
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,694
<i>got out of the car</i>
<i>and went behind the building.</i>

231
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,235
<i>I thought real fast,</i>
<i>and I said I'm menstruating,</i>

232
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,736
<i>you can't have sex with me.</i>

233
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,070
<i>And all five</i>
<i>of those snakes forced me</i>

234
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:06,872
<i>to perform oral sex</i>
<i>on every one of them.</i>

235
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:14,211
<i>They could have killed me or something</i>
<i>and left me dead behind that school.</i>

236
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,651
<i>I went home to Mama right away,</i>
<i>I was so frightened.</i>

237
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:31,864
<i>Back in New York,</i>
<i>the first secretarial job I ever had</i>

238
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:35,771
<i>in New York was</i>
<i>for the American Bread Company.</i>

239
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,867
<i>I was a secretary</i>
<i>to the office manager.</i>

240
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:44,476
<i>I had a small room up on the fifth floor</i>
<i>of an old brownstone house.</i>

241
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:45,779
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

242
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:49,514
<i>Somebody knocked</i>
<i>on the door around midnight.</i>

243
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:51,089
Woman: Who is it?

244
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,124
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"Bettie, open the door, it's Billy. "</i>

245
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,455
- Woman: What do you want?
- Bettie: <i>"Let me in. "</i>

246
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:59,327
<i>A friend of mine in the next apartment,</i>
<i>a little fella named Jimmy,</i>

247
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:02,060
<i>a 50-year-old man,</i>
<i>came out to the door</i>

248
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,602
<i>and asked what was going on.</i>

249
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:06,331
<i>Well, Billy told him</i>
<i>to mind his own business,</i>

250
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,806
<i>and he cut</i>
<i>little Jimmy across the face,</i>

251
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:12,343
<i>a couple of inches with a knife now.</i>

252
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:15,505
<i>He was going to kill me with a knife</i>
<i>is what he was going to do.</i>

253
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,441
<i>He must have left.</i>

254
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,815
<i>He didn't come back.</i>

255
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,287
<i>I was working</i>
<i>as secretary, way up high</i>

256
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,861
<i>in the Eastern Airlines building</i>
<i>on the 12th floor,</i>

257
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:33,454
<i>overlooking the skating rink</i>
<i>in Rockefeller Center,</i>

258
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:35,500
<i>a very nice place to work.</i>

259
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:39,367
<i>And that's where I met the love</i>
<i>of my life, Carlos Garcia Arrese.</i>

260
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:40,564
<i>( laughs )</i>

261
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:43,107
<i>You know I was a nut</i>
<i>over dancing back in those days.</i>

262
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:47,703
<i>And he taught me the rumba,</i>
<i>and mambo, and cha-cha, and samba.</i>

263
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,509
<i>And he was very good at it.</i>

264
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:54,279
<i>Well, we dated</i>
<i>and we were making mad love,</i>

265
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:56,287
<i>he was a very good lover.</i>

266
00:17:57,757 --> 00:18:00,351
<i>One night I was up at his apartment,</i>

267
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:04,156
<i>all of a sudden,</i>
<i>a big loud knocking on the door,</i>

268
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:06,163
<i>"Carlos, open up the door,</i>
<i>l know you're in there. "</i>

269
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:10,759
<i>And she was really mad,</i>
<i>and I thought, oh gosh, who's that?</i>

270
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,804
<i>And he said, "Bettie, that's my wife. "</i>

271
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:15,169
<i>I said, "Your wife!"</i>

272
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:19,210
<i>I never felt so low in my life,</i>
<i>I felt like two cents.</i>

273
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:23,247
<i>I didn't want to see him again</i>
<i>because he had deceived me.</i>

274
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:27,877
<i>But if I had known he was married</i>
<i>I would never have dated him.</i>

275
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:36,259
<i>I always wanted</i>
<i>to be a fashion model.</i>

276
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:40,628
<i>And I went to-- let's see, what was</i>
<i>the name of the most famous one?</i>

277
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,201
<i>Ford, that's it. She says, "Oh, my. "</i>

278
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:45,862
<i>She says, "You would never do</i>
<i>as a fashion model. "</i>

279
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:48,269
<i>She says, "In the first place,</i>
<i>you're not tall enough. "</i>

280
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,865
<i>But she says, "More than that, "</i>
<i>she says, "you're too hippy. "</i>

281
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:53,206
<i>You've got to be</i>
<i>skin and bones, you know.</i>

282
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,746
<i>Even back then,</i>
<i>to be a fashion model.</i>

283
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,979
<i>In October 1 950,</i>
<i>I was walking out on Coney Island.</i>

284
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,558
<i>Nobody was on the beach in that area,</i>

285
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,890
<i>except this black fella, Jerry Tibbs.</i>

286
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:14,091
<i>He gave me his card and he said,</i>
<i>"I'm a Brooklyn policeman. "</i>

287
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,533
<i>He said, "I think you'd make</i>
<i>a good pinup modeI. "</i>

288
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,696
<i>He said, "l have a studio,</i>
<i>if you wouId come over there</i>

289
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:22,774
<i>free of charge,</i>
<i>I'll make you up a portfolio</i>

290
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,844
<i>that you could</i>
<i>take around to the studios. "</i>

291
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,971
<i>I posed in a couple of bikinis of his.</i>

292
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:31,914
<i>But he said, "Bettie, have you ever</i>
<i>tried to wear bangs?"</i>

293
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:35,646
<i>He said, "You have a very high forehead,</i>
<i>I think you'd look good in bangs. "</i>

294
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:38,314
<i>So I went home and cut me some.</i>

295
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:43,589
<i>And I've been wearing them ever since,</i>
<i>its sort of been a trademark of mine,</i>

296
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:46,062
<i>I'm still wearing them.</i>

297
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,565
Mark: <i>That's that</i>
<i>famous Bettie Page look, isn't it?</i>

298
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,259
<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

299
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,200
Bettie: <i>I think I was about 27</i>

300
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:55,898
<i>when I started modeling,</i>

301
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:57,703
<i>but I looked much younger.</i>

302
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,506
<i>All of the writers and editors</i>

303
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:03,207
<i>would say I was 22 years old,</i>

304
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:05,875
<i>they were saying that</i>
<i>for years that I was 22.</i>

305
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:09,443
<i>I never refuted it, I never said</i>
<i>anything one way or another,</i>

306
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,489
<i>let them think what they wanted to.</i>

307
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,251
<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

308
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:17,828
<i>The first modeling I did</i>
<i>was for the camera clubs.</i>

309
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,491
<i>First one was Cass Carr</i>
<i>who was an orchestra leader.</i>

310
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:25,229
Every Sunday we'd say we're going out

311
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:28,033
to Headly Farm
in New Jersey or some other farm,

312
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,576
or we're going out to Fire Island
or Broad Channel Bay.

313
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:35,169
Bettie Page and four other amateur
models will be with them,

314
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:38,011
<i>and it would cost</i>
<i>ten dollars or five dollars.</i>

315
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:41,518
Bettie: <i>There would be maybe</i>
<i>30 or 40 camera club members</i>

316
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,145
<i>and three or four models.</i>

317
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:46,690
<i>We would go</i>
<i>on field trips, on weekends,</i>

318
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,885
<i>upstate New York, over in New Jersey,</i>

319
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:51,519
<i>on the beaches,</i>
<i>especially on Fire Island.</i>

320
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,733
<i>I got 25 dollars a day.</i>

321
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,030
<i>And we would be gone all afternoon</i>
<i>and they would bring lunches,</i>

322
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:05,474
<i>and I enjoyed</i>
<i>the outings very much.</i>

323
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:09,708
<i>They were always polite</i>
<i>and courteous to us.</i>

324
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:11,612
<i>I enjoyed posing for them.</i>

325
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:14,880
It was absolutely fun
photographing Bettie.

326
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:18,787
<i>And I could tell, I think</i>
<i>it shows up in the photographs,</i>

327
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:20,722
<i>that she enjoyed it too.</i>

328
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,191
<i>She was happy.</i>

329
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:25,092
<i>She was exhilarated.</i>

330
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:26,425
<i>She projected.</i>

331
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:28,500
<i>She came right out at you.</i>

332
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,035
<i>Whereas others were just pretty.</i>

333
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:34,367
When she turned,
she didn't just turn and smile,

334
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,270
<i>her hands, her body, her feet,</i>

335
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,434
<i>everything moved, everything moved.</i>

336
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:41,707
<i>She smiled with her face,</i>
<i>she smiled with her whole body.</i>

337
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:43,839
<i>And that's something very few girls got.</i>

338
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:48,476
Amsie: <i>The good pinup</i>
<i>involves three things:</i>

339
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:52,387
<i>Pose, clothes, and expression.</i>

340
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:55,289
She knew just when I said, pert, saucy,

341
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:58,488
frisky, haughty, angry, sullen,

342
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:01,395
whereas with many other models
I'd have to tell them,

343
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,365
"Well, no, tilt
your head up a little bit,"

344
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:06,461
"Move it up like that,"
"Raise your eyes," etcetera.

345
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,767
<i>She would pop up</i>
<i>into that right away.</i>

346
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:11,900
Bettie: <i>I was very happy posing.</i>

347
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,672
<i>And I never had any problem</i>

348
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,145
<i>thinking of what to do with my body.</i>

349
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:21,083
<i>I could think of a thousand different</i>
<i>poses that just came natural to me.</i>

350
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:23,677
<i>Sometimes I would imagine</i>

351
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:26,656
<i>the camera was my boyfriend.</i>

352
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,286
<i>And I would play to my boyfriend.</i>

353
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:34,662
Amsie: <i>All I do know is that</i>
<i>when Bettie Page was announced</i>

354
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,565
<i>as being the feature model</i>

355
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,264
<i>of next Sunday's shoot,</i>

356
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:42,863
<i>there was a big crowd.</i>

357
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:47,709
Mark: <i>Did the guys in the camera clubs</i>

358
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:50,111
<i>ask you out for dates a lot?</i>

359
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:51,273
Bettie: <i>No.</i>

360
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:53,943
<i>Now I wouldn't date anybody</i>
<i>who drank or smoke.</i>

361
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:58,854
<i>I just don't like the taste</i>
<i>of cigarettes on your breath,</i>

362
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,425
<i>and I hate alcohol.</i>

363
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:05,826
One of the most interesting
characters in this entire story

364
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,899
was Richard Arbib,

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,298
<i>one of her ex-boyfriends.</i>

366
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:15,362
<i>He was a top designer of the '50s.</i>

367
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:20,343
<i>Designed cars, watches,</i>
<i>extremely well known designer.</i>

368
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:29,047
<i>Richard had split up with his wife,</i>

369
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:30,553
<i>and met Bettie,</i>

370
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,886
<i>and they had a red hot romance,</i>

371
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:35,551
<i>they were deeply in love.</i>

372
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:40,064
<i>He took her</i>
<i>in his two seater down to Florida.</i>

373
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:42,690
Arbib:
<i>Well, we just decided we'd take off</i>

374
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:45,964
<i>and go to Florida for three weeks.</i>

375
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:49,632
<i>She wanted to have sex with me</i>
<i>in the car and I said,</i>

376
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:52,677
<i>"If you're going to do that, I've got</i>
<i>to stop 'cause I'll go off the road. "</i>

377
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:55,542
<i>So she's going away at me,</i>

378
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:58,878
<i>and all of a sudden</i>
<i>there's a flashlight in the door,</i>

379
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:02,283
<i>it was raining cats and dogs,</i>
<i>there's a state trooper there.</i>

380
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:05,719
<i>And I thought he was going to arrest us</i>
<i>for having sex in the car.</i>

381
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:11,795
<i>All he said was, "You all know</i>
<i>you've got one tail light out. "</i>

382
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:15,765
<i>Bettie had a very normal sex life.</i>

383
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:19,736
<i>She wasn't inhibited,</i>
<i>she wasn't hung up in any way at all.</i>

384
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:23,103
<i>She liked sex</i>
<i>and she was very good at it.</i>

385
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,609
Theakson: <i>Arbib told me</i>
<i>he designed a watch for Bettie.</i>

386
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,579
<i>It was a custom made piece</i>
<i>for Bettie Page.</i>

387
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:32,582
<i>He was renowned for his watches.</i>

388
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,054
<i>This was a unique</i>
<i>one of a kind piece.</i>

389
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:42,617
<i>He presented it to her</i>
<i>and she wore it proudly.</i>

390
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:46,459
<i>And for some reason,</i>
<i>Richard decided that</i>

391
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,328
<i>he was going to give it</i>
<i>one more shot with his wife,</i>

392
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,901
<i>and it didn't work out with his wife,</i>

393
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,028
<i>and when he came back,</i>
<i>Bettie was gone.</i>

394
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:57,040
<i>And that was the regret of his life.</i>

395
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:02,580
All of the guys that I knew
that met this woman,

396
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:08,017
had this, "The one that got away"
ennui about them.

397
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:14,424
She wasn't just a pretty face with
nothing behind it, she was not a facade.

398
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:16,426
She had a high IQ.

399
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:20,931
<i>And had a great range</i>
<i>of things that interested her.</i>

400
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,236
Bettie:
<i>I used to make a lot of my clothes.</i>

401
00:25:25,337 --> 00:25:28,864
<i>I made all my bikinis,</i>
<i>most of my lingerie.</i>

402
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:30,942
<i>I enjoyed making them.</i>

403
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:36,644
Bettie used to design stuff.

404
00:25:36,748 --> 00:25:38,682
<i>She could have made a fortune.</i>

405
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:42,550
<i>'Cause she had an eye for it,</i>
<i>she knew what was sexy.</i>

406
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:46,852
Bettie: <i>Bikinis were never heard of</i>
<i>on the beaches in this country.</i>

407
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,893
<i>( big band music playing )</i>

408
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:50,985
Male announcer: <i>Don't know what</i>
<i>the wild waves are saying,</i>

409
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:54,122
<i>but the gals are talking about</i>
<i>the latest thing in swimming attire.</i>

410
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:57,225
<i>A suit with a built in girdle.</i>

411
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:59,634
Bettie: <i>I made them real skimpy.</i>

412
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:02,070
<i>It was considered very risqué.</i>

413
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,210
<i>One of the jobs I had in New York</i>

414
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:09,906
<i>was with a couple</i>
<i>down in Greenwich Village.</i>

415
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:13,849
<i>Well, they had me bring</i>
<i>every one of my costumes,</i>

416
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:15,977
<i>especially all my bikinis.</i>

417
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:20,286
<i>And I wondered why they had me</i>
<i>change costumes so many times.</i>

418
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:25,395
<i>And then they had taken my designs</i>

419
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:27,431
<i>from the pictures they'd took of me</i>

420
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,057
<i>and had them</i>
<i>manufactured under my name</i>

421
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:34,036
<i>and selling them</i>
<i>as "Bettie Page's Bikinis" now.</i>

422
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:40,944
<i>I should have sued them or something,</i>
<i>but I didn't do anything about it.</i>

423
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:55,582
<i>The first bona fide</i>
<i>commercial work I did</i>

424
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:59,460
<i>was for Robert Harrison's magazines.</i>

425
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:01,691
<i>You know,</i>
<i>he had five or six girly books.</i>

426
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,965
<i>Wink, Titter, Flirt, Beauty Parade.</i>

427
00:27:07,072 --> 00:27:09,404
<i>They had four</i>
<i>or five writers in the back room</i>

428
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:13,308
<i>that made up all kinds</i>
<i>of crazy things we had to act out.</i>

429
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:17,041
<i>But one thing I didn't like</i>
<i>and none of the other girls did either,</i>

430
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:22,109
<i>Robert Harrison insisted</i>
<i>that our breasts be taped.</i>

431
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,780
<i>He was a nut about the cleavage.</i>

432
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,290
<i>I'd have to hold my breasts together,</i>

433
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:30,919
<i>and they put a great big thick</i>
<i>two-inches wide tape,</i>

434
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:32,929
<i>all the way across.</i>

435
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:34,828
<i>I hated that.</i>

436
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:37,868
<i>Mr. Harrison said,</i>
<i>"Bettie, I want you to represent</i>

437
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,268
<i>my magazines at the artists ball. "</i>

438
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:43,830
<i>They have a contest</i>
<i>for the best costume.</i>

439
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:46,604
<i>And guess what I was wearing?</i>

440
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:51,172
<i>Just two telephone dials,</i>
<i>one over this breast, one over this,</i>

441
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,376
<i>and a suggestion box,</i>

442
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:55,510
<i>and black net stockings up to the waist,</i>

443
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,488
<i>and that was it, and I won it that year,</i>

444
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:02,219
<i>and I got a whole set</i>
<i>of Revere kitchen ware.</i>

445
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,090
<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

446
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:07,091
<i>( patriotic classical music playing )</i>

447
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,495
Announcer: <i>Estes Kefauver of the Senate</i>
<i>crime investigation fame</i>

448
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:14,663
<i>brings the Democratic</i>
<i>political pot to boil</i>

449
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:17,901
<i>by announcing his candidacy</i>
<i>for the presidential nomination.</i>

450
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:21,679
Bettie: <i>Senator Estes Kefauver.</i>

451
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,475
<i>He's from my home state, you know.</i>

452
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:26,710
<i>He was trying to drum up votes,</i>

453
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,752
<i>and get the public on his side,</i>

454
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:33,484
<i>by going after juvenile delinquency</i>
<i>and pornography.</i>

455
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:37,551
What I expected,
having served in World War II,

456
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:41,291
which I thought was a fight
for democracy and liberation,

457
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,391
<i>what I expected after World War II was</i>

458
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:46,903
something like what I perceived
as the "Roaring '20s" was like

459
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:49,405
after World War I, a huge celebration.

460
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:54,111
<i>And what we actually got</i>
<i>was repression.</i>

461
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,045
Repression on several fronts,

462
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:01,676
it was social and sexual and political.

463
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:05,086
Man: <i>Are you now or have you ever been</i>
<i>a member of the Communist Party?</i>

464
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,715
The thing that
the American people can do

465
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:12,286
is to be vigilant, day and night.

466
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:15,833
To make sure
they don't have communists

467
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:20,132
teaching the sons
and daughters of America.

468
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:23,366
We have an image of the fifties
as a time when everything was placid

469
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:26,842
and everybody lived in
a sort of Ozzie and Harriet life,

470
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:30,039
<i>but going on</i>
<i>at the same time in the culture</i>

471
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:32,708
was an enormous amount of fear

472
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,480
of infiltration of new things

473
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:38,181
<i>that were going</i>
<i>to undermine and infect the culture,</i>

474
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,589
<i>and make</i>
<i>the youth of America delinquents,</i>

475
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,422
<i>as the term that had been invented.</i>

476
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:45,894
And a lot of it focused on pornography.

477
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:48,295
Male announcer:
<i>The peddling of obscene books,</i>

478
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,664
<i>a furtive and despicable occupation</i>

479
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,566
<i>has become a lucrative sideline</i>

480
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:55,469
<i>for unscrupulous shopkeepers</i>
<i>in some high school neighborhoods.</i>

481
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:58,099
Smith: <i>People basically,</i>
<i>I think, felt that anything</i>

482
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,110
<i>that got people sexually</i>
<i>excited was a bad thing.</i>

483
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:03,511
<i>I mean, even to talk about sex</i>
<i>in the 1 950s was a taboo.</i>

484
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:08,446
The Postmaster General
had a very visible campaign

485
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:11,784
of trying to suppress
the use of the mails

486
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,188
to deliver sexually explicit materials.

487
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,522
<i>Postal inspectors could open your mail,</i>

488
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:17,822
<i>they could confiscate it,</i>

489
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:20,124
<i>they could come</i>
<i>and do raids on your premises</i>

490
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:21,995
<i>to keep you from mailing</i>
<i>material at another time.</i>

491
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,091
<i>Of course they could</i>
<i>turn you over to the prosecution.</i>

492
00:30:24,202 --> 00:30:29,469
So they had a great deal
of power at their disposal.

493
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:33,704
Anything that would be
perceived as being lewd,

494
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:36,144
a term pretty broad,

495
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:38,580
could be treated as a crime

496
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,412
if you circulated it through the mail.

497
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,920
And certainly nudity alone
was considered enough to be obscene

498
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:46,718
by the standards
of the authorities at the time.

499
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:51,722
Bettie: <i>I don't even believe God</i>
<i>disapproves of nudity,</i>

500
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,492
<i>after all, he put Adam and Eve</i>

501
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,966
<i>in the Garden of Eden</i>
<i>naked as jaybirds.</i>

502
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:02,899
<i>As a part of posing for the camera club,</i>

503
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:05,169
<i>most of it was in bikinis,</i>

504
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:07,006
<i>but sometimes there would be</i>

505
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:09,012
<i>a few shots topless.</i>

506
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:26,554
Theakson: <i>Bettie Page was very sexual,</i>

507
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:29,156
<i>but in a very free</i>
<i>and innocent kind of way.</i>

508
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:32,068
<i>She's gorgeous</i>

509
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,038
<i>and she makes you feel good.</i>

510
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:39,133
<i>She makes direct eye contact with you,</i>

511
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:42,509
<i>and it's engaging.</i>

512
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:44,241
I've seen her work

513
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:47,750
with some very shy newcomers,

514
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:50,184
<i>and actually help them out.</i>

515
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:53,485
<i>Bettie would suggest something,</i>
<i>"How 'bout this one,</i>

516
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,389
<i>how 'bout this one,</i>
<i>how 'bout this one?"</i>

517
00:31:55,493 --> 00:31:57,654
<i>And that way she would</i>
<i>get him out of his shell.</i>

518
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:08,337
Theakson:<i>Bettie is sexuality</i>
<i>in it's sparkly, cleanest,</i>

519
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,705
<i>most beautiful, charming, smilingest.</i>

520
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:17,144
Theakson: <i>But there was some discussion</i>

521
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:20,844
<i>about the kind of women</i>

522
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:22,442
<i>that would do camera club shoots</i>

523
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:26,285
<i>because primarily they were nude,</i>
<i>totally nude shoots.</i>

524
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,359
<i>And Bettie would say,</i>

525
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,258
<i>"Whenever there was</i>
<i>a shoot that I was attending,</i>

526
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:35,595
<i>where things started</i>
<i>getting sketchy, I got out of there. "</i>

527
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:40,703
Amsie: <i>Everybody would have</i>
<i>liked to date Bettie Page,</i>

528
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:43,638
<i>but nobody made the moves.</i>

529
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:47,337
Mark: <i>Are there any boyfriends</i>
<i>of Bettie that you know of,</i>

530
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:49,470
<i>that you've talked to her</i>
<i>that you know of?.</i>

531
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,209
I talked to a lot of guys,

532
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:56,583
not only photographers, but her lovers.

533
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:58,451
<i>Charles West was one of them.</i>

534
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:01,787
<i>Apparently met her</i>
<i>through a camera club.</i>

535
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:08,464
<i>He did a notorious series</i>
<i>of photographs with Bettie.</i>

536
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:11,967
Charles West: <i>One day, a Saturday,</i>
<i>she and I were walking</i>

537
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,129
<i>down 5th Ave. at Rockefeller Center.</i>

538
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:17,902
<i>She wore that same</i>
<i>tight translucent sweater.</i>

539
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:22,673
<i>We were on our way to a shooting session</i>
<i>in the Time Life building.</i>

540
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:26,376
<i>You should have seen the swiveling</i>
<i>heads, both male and female.</i>

541
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:28,418
<i>My God, wasn't she beautiful.</i>

542
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,385
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

543
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:33,184
<i>My photos were taken very privately,</i>

544
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:36,226
<i>I never intended</i>
<i>for any of them to be published.</i>

545
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:39,092
<i>God gave her a lovely body</i>
<i>and she knew it.</i>

546
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:41,791
<i>As a model,</i>
<i>she used it to full advantage.</i>

547
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:50,973
<i>Her body was</i>
<i>absolutely without blemish,</i>

548
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:54,341
<i>and everything</i>

549
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:56,505
<i>exactly right in proportion.</i>

550
00:33:57,582 --> 00:34:00,517
<i>And that was the same with her face,</i>
<i>and you put the two together,</i>

551
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:03,451
<i>and you had</i>
<i>just about the perfect woman.</i>

552
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:08,181
<i>There was also a very sheer</i>
<i>pair of white panties.</i>

553
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:15,225
<i>Also, super long black</i>
<i>opera length gloves.</i>

554
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,435
<i>She was absolutely pure,</i>

555
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,597
<i>plain and natural.</i>

556
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:25,642
<i>And of course she shows up</i>
<i>that way in her photographs.</i>

557
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:29,441
<i>And I just think</i>
<i>you see the real girl there.</i>

558
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:34,115
<i>No one ever dominated Betts,</i>

559
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,312
<i>either physically or psychologically.</i>

560
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:39,913
<i>She was her own person and she never</i>
<i>could have mistreated anyone.</i>

561
00:34:44,162 --> 00:34:47,859
<i>Yes, she and I made love.</i>

562
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:50,365
<i>And she was marvelous.</i>

563
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:54,404
<i>She's an extraordinary creature.</i>

564
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:56,838
<i>My memories of Betts are ever present.</i>

565
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:34,301
Nudity back then was, was very unusual.

566
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:36,039
<i>That was '52,</i>

567
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:39,878
<i>a time of restrictive sexuality.</i>

568
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,282
<i>You talked</i>
<i>to your friends in college even,</i>

569
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:45,788
<i>and the fellow</i>
<i>who had been sexually active</i>

570
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,915
was the unusual guy.

571
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:50,051
Know when and how

572
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:51,753
you're going to say "no".

573
00:35:51,863 --> 00:35:55,424
<i>Take the case of the girl</i>
<i>who finds herself in this situation.</i>

574
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,728
Girl in car:
Say, is anybody else hungry?

575
00:35:57,836 --> 00:36:02,034
How about it you two, couldn't we go
someplace for something to eat?

576
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:07,875
Heinlein: <i>I was on my way</i>
<i>into the army at that time,</i>

577
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:09,844
<i>on my way to Korea eventually.</i>

578
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:14,282
<i>So I thought it was a time</i>
<i>to have a little bit of fun.</i>

579
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:19,351
Bettie:
<i>We were upstate New York on a farm.</i>

580
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,553
Mark: <i>But maybe this have been</i>
<i>your first opportunity</i>

581
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:26,892
<i>to see a woman without</i>
<i>much clothes on?</i>

582
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:29,193
Ah, that's not a bad guess.

583
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,997
( laughter )

584
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:36,596
Heinlein: <i>The photographers</i>
<i>all sort of gravitated to Bettie Page.</i>

585
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,972
<i>You were drawn as if by a magnet.</i>

586
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,307
<i>She lit up the place.</i>

587
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,209
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>anybody can really explain</i>

588
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:47,751
<i>why some people</i>
<i>have that kind of charisma.</i>

589
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:51,583
<i>It was kind of</i>
<i>a revolution for me really</i>

590
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:55,716
<i>to see that openness.</i>

591
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:59,125
Bettie: <i>Somebody went</i>
<i>to the police about it,</i>

592
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,461
<i>some old fogy no doubt,</i>
<i>went to the police and said</i>

593
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,229
<i>we were running around</i>
<i>in the woods nude out there.</i>

594
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:07,201
<i>And here came a squad car.</i>

595
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:11,241
Man: <i>Calling car 6 and 7 eighths,</i>
<i>car 6 and 7 eighths.</i>

596
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:13,333
Heinlein:
<i>Here they are coming with drawn guns,</i>

597
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:16,242
<i>coming on a bunch of photographers.</i>

598
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:19,441
I mean, what were we going to do?

599
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:23,043
<i>I mean, this is absolute nonsense.</i>

600
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:27,090
And they said, "Also, take
the pictures out of your cameras."

601
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:29,284
<i>I opened the back of the camera.</i>

602
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,555
The counter, which may have been,

603
00:37:31,663 --> 00:37:33,722
say on film number 5,

604
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:35,765
<i>well, I snapped back to zero.</i>

605
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:38,995
<i>I immediately closed the camera</i>
<i>and thought to myself,</i>

606
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:42,630
why not try to keep

607
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,140
what films I have in the camera.

608
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:47,040
And I showed it to one
of the deputies and I said,

609
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:50,308
<i>"Look, you see, the counter's on zero,</i>

610
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:52,940
<i>but to tell you the truth</i>
<i>I have a new roll in there,</i>

611
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:55,246
<i>I'd rather not expose it</i>
<i>by opening the back. "</i>

612
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,946
<i>I said, "Okay if I keep it that way?"</i>

613
00:37:58,056 --> 00:37:59,182
<i>And he said sure.</i>

614
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,919
<i>But I didn't come upon the idea</i>
<i>of holding onto those photos</i>

615
00:38:03,027 --> 00:38:05,120
<i>until I saw it snap back to zero.</i>

616
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:37,058
<i>The charming thing was that</i>

617
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:40,221
<i>a little kitten wandered by.</i>

618
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:42,561
<i>And she picked it up,</i>

619
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:44,430
<i>and she held it to her breast.</i>

620
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:47,367
<i>I found that exquisite.</i>

621
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:51,966
<i>And I did take a picture of that</i>
<i>but half of it was destroyed.</i>

622
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,215
One of the deputies said something,

623
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:08,519
which was rather nasty,

624
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:11,186
but I do remember her saying,

625
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:14,355
<i>"Don't you talk to me like that.</i>

626
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,592
<i>I won't have it. "</i>

627
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:18,066
<i>And I think she had more courage</i>

628
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:21,434
<i>than the dozen and a half</i>
<i>photographers that were there.</i>

629
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:24,508
They decided to charge the guys
for disturbing the peace,

630
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:27,772
<i>and the girls for indecent exposure.</i>

631
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:30,814
Heinlein:
<i>She was just terribly offended by it.</i>

632
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:33,179
Menning:
<i>Bettie says, "I'm not indecent.</i>

633
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:36,082
<i>I will not plead guilty to that. "</i>

634
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:38,087
Bettie:
<i>And we sat there in the anteroom,</i>

635
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:40,714
<i>outside the court room for five hours.</i>

636
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:44,286
<i>( Menning speaking )</i>

637
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:56,940
Theakson: <i>Bettie demanded</i>
<i>that this release form be rewritten</i>

638
00:39:57,041 --> 00:40:00,499
<i>so that it didn't say</i>
<i>"indecent exposure".</i>

639
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:07,179
Bettie: <i>And the judge warned us</i>

640
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:09,253
<i>never to come in his county again.</i>

641
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:10,911
<i>( Bettie chuckles )</i>

642
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:14,890
Theakson: <i>Her being put in jail</i>
<i>because she was posing,</i>

643
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:17,483
<i>making a living,</i>
<i>gave her pause for thought.</i>

644
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:20,223
<i>She really had never considered</i>
<i>that it could happen to her.</i>

645
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:23,892
<i>And in fact, it was an alarm</i>
<i>to wake her up to the fact</i>

646
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,970
<i>that a lot of people</i>
<i>did not like what she was doing.</i>

647
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,799
<i>( dramatic classical music playing )</i>

648
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:35,140
On Friday, we shall continue
the investigation of the relationship

649
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:38,647
of pornographic
materials to delinquency.

650
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:41,514
Hefner: <i>In the 1950s,</i>

651
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,951
<i>the repression</i>
<i>was coming from the government.</i>

652
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:47,286
And it also involved Kefauver
and his investigations,

653
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:49,791
in terms of pornography and crime.

654
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:52,089
You couldn't sell in many places

655
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:57,259
a magazine that had the kinds of nudity

656
00:40:57,368 --> 00:41:00,496
that we see in a modern <i>Playboy.</i>

657
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:02,971
<i>That was considered going too far.</i>

658
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:06,771
Bettie: <i>I never had any bad feelings</i>

659
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:08,470
<i>about posing in the nude</i>

660
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,878
<i>or semi-nude outfits.</i>

661
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:15,248
<i>I found out I could make</i>
<i>more money posing in two hours</i>

662
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:17,947
<i>than I'd make all week as a secretary.</i>

663
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,888
<i>All the girls</i>
<i>who worked for Robert Harrison</i>

664
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:25,451
<i>would end up posing for lrving Klaw.</i>

665
00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:29,294
<i>He had a big business,</i>
<i>he and his sister Paula,</i>

666
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,597
<i>selling movie star pictures</i>
<i>before they got into, locally,</i>

667
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:35,695
<i>shooting models in New York.</i>

668
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:38,742
And one of the cameramen
brought her in and said,

669
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:42,210
she's a super model, she works well,

670
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:45,043
and she's a love, give her a shot.

671
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:47,379
<i>And we did.</i>
<i>You should have seen her then.</i>

672
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,976
<i>The long black hair</i>
<i>and always smiling,</i>

673
00:41:50,087 --> 00:41:53,887
<i>giggling and whatever,</i>
<i>she was so great to work with.</i>

674
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:57,461
<i>She loved posing.</i>

675
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:07,067
Bettie: <i>Irving Klaw,</i>
<i>he was a real sweet fella.</i>

676
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:09,935
<i>He was a big fat chubby guy.</i>

677
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,635
<i>And he was sort of short</i>
<i>and he was almost bald.</i>

678
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:15,371
<i>But he was so nice.</i>

679
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:18,676
<i>He never made any passes</i>
<i>at the women or anything.</i>

680
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:21,877
<i>They would bring food there,</i>
<i>sandwiches and all for us.</i>

681
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:24,716
<i>They were always</i>
<i>very generous about that.</i>

682
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:28,588
Paula Klaw: <i>He got some of the ideas</i>
<i>from some of the customers.</i>

683
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,218
<i>And he would sort of talk to me about,</i>

684
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:33,388
<i>"What do you think of this</i>
<i>and what do you think of that",</i>

685
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:36,295
<i>and between the two of us</i>
<i>we'd figure it out.</i>

686
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:40,662
In some of her earliest
Irving Klaw photos,

687
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:42,295
Bettie looked a little gawky.

688
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:44,806
<i>But Klaw would give her</i>
<i>a set of these photos.</i>

689
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:48,242
<i>She could summarize</i>
<i>what she was doing right</i>

690
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:49,608
<i>and what she was doing wrong,</i>

691
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:52,444
<i>and I think she became</i>
<i>a much better model.</i>

692
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:55,985
Paula Klaw:
<i>She liked being in front of the camera.</i>

693
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,146
<i>She enjoyed her body.</i>

694
00:42:58,256 --> 00:42:59,917
<i>She liked the way she looked.</i>

695
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:01,582
<i>She liked her hair.</i>

696
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,922
<i>She enjoyed herself.</i>

697
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,590
<i>She never cried about anything--</i>

698
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:09,757
<i>"It's too tight, '"'It's too loose, "</i>

699
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:11,858
<i>"Don't do that, " or anything.</i>

700
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:14,870
<i>She was just a super lady to work with.</i>

701
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:20,000
Bettie: <i>Irving said I was</i>
<i>his most famous model that he ever had,</i>

702
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:23,740
<i>and he had some</i>
<i>1,500 pictures of me going.</i>

703
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:27,544
<i>A lot of them to service men.</i>

704
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,887
Paula Klaw: <i>We made this set</i>
<i>of pictures, we'd advertise it,</i>

705
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:35,447
<i>and we noticed the increase in sales.</i>

706
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:38,187
Bettie: <i>One of the biggest sellers</i>

707
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:39,786
<i>is a picture of me wearing</i>

708
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:43,094
<i>my little leopard-skin bikini,</i>
<i>and I'm looking real mean,</i>

709
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,931
<i>holding this whip</i>
<i>with one foot up on a stool</i>

710
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:50,166
<i>and a cigarette dangling</i>
<i>out the side of my mouth.</i>

711
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:52,242
<i>And the teenagers.</i>

712
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:55,938
<i>Irving said that's</i>
<i>their favorite picture of me now.</i>

713
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:57,810
<i>You know, I never smoked.</i>

714
00:43:57,915 --> 00:43:59,109
<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

715
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:00,843
<i>I hate cigarettes.</i>

716
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:05,412
Well, I shot stills but there was
more money into making films

717
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:08,321
so we started with the 16mm,

718
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:10,155
because that was
very popular at that time.

752
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:16,985
Bettie: <i>In one of them starring</i>
<i>Tempest Storm, I played her maid.</i>

753
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:22,048
<i>And I also introduced the acts</i>

<i>wearing my bikinis and other costumes.</i>

<i>It was just fun.</i>

760

Bettie: <i>Irving Klaw would pay me $150</i>

761
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:53,618
<i>every time I did one of these movies.</i>

762
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:57,854
<i>And I would take the money</i>
<i>and go to visit my mother in Pittsburgh,</i>

763

<i>or my brothers in Nashville,</i>

764

<i>or my sister in Coral Gables.</i>

765
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:11,573
Bettie happened to be in Miami
on a little vacation.

766
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:13,700
<i>And she gave me a call.</i>

767
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:15,836
<i>And she said she was</i>
<i>a New York model.</i>

768
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:18,380
And I said, "Oh,"
and I was very impressed.

769
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:20,609
Bettie: <i>I posed for Bunny</i>

770
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:24,415
<i>in Florida in the spring of 1954.</i>

771
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:27,958
<i>She had just started out</i>
<i>as a photographer,</i>

772
00:47:28,058 --> 00:47:30,117
<i>she used to be a pinup model.</i>

773
00:47:30,227 --> 00:47:32,821
I said, "You do pinup modeling?"

774
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:34,557
And she says, "I do nudes, too."

775
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:38,066
And when I heard that
she did nudes, I was really excited

776
00:47:38,169 --> 00:47:40,034
because I had never photographed

777
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:42,298
<i>a professional nude model before.</i>

778
00:47:42,406 --> 00:47:46,672
<i>So I told her to come on over,</i>
<i>I would use her sight unseen.</i>

779
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:51,377
<i>Bettie was so perfect in every way.</i>

780
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:56,078
<i>It would be hard for anybody</i>
<i>to take a bad picture of Bettie.</i>

781
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:57,677
Bettie: <i>Because she was a woman,</i>

782
00:47:57,788 --> 00:48:01,690
<i>I felt more comfortable</i>
<i>posing in the nude for Bunny.</i>

783
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:04,989
<i>And we'd go out there</i>
<i>about 7:00 in the morning</i>

784
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:09,429
<i>before anybody came on the beaches</i>
<i>and do our shooting then.</i>

785
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:12,297
<i>( "Casbah" by</i>
<i>Los Straightjackets playing )</i>

786
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:17,837
Bunny: <i>We worked so well together</i>
<i>because she caught on</i>

787
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:20,206
<i>to what I was trying to get out of her.</i>

788
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:24,304
<i>And she just played like she was</i>
<i>a teenager in front of the camera,</i>

789
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:27,111
<i>and followed</i>
<i>every direction I gave her.</i>

790
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:28,651
<i>And that was a thrill too,</i>

791
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:33,746
<i>because I had not worked</i>
<i>with somebody that professional before.</i>

792
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:37,419
<i>You knew she was trying</i>
<i>to look her very best.</i>

793
00:48:37,528 --> 00:48:39,792
<i>She would work on her tan</i>

794
00:48:39,897 --> 00:48:42,957
<i>and sunbathe the nude</i>
<i>for a certain time everyday</i>

795
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:45,661
<i>so that her skin would be so glorious.</i>

796
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:50,570
<i>Bettie had a different torso</i>
<i>than most girls.</i>

797
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:53,268
<i>Her bone structure there,</i>

798
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:54,776
<i>close to her waistline,</i>

799
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:58,507
<i>went way in to a very tiny waist.</i>

800
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:02,211
<i>And there are very few girls</i>
<i>that are built like that.</i>

801
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,914
Bettie: <i>I was 36-24-37.</i>

802
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:09,959
<i>I worked out</i>
<i>at the health club three times a week.</i>

803
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,221
<i>I've always liked to exercise.</i>

804
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:15,924
<i>I wanted to keep in shape</i>
<i>for my modeling.</i>

805
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:21,066
Bunny: <i>She lied to me about her age.</i>

806
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:24,766
<i>She told me she was 24 when she posed</i>
<i>for me but she was much older.</i>

807
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,740
<i>I think that she was 32.</i>

808
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,541
<i>We shot pictures at Kiddie Land Park.</i>

809
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:35,380
<i>And I put her in a bikini</i>

810
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,511
<i>and shot her on the merry-go-round</i>

811
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,589
<i>and all these stupid rides.</i>

812
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,386
<i>And she, she had a ball, you know.</i>

813
00:49:42,493 --> 00:49:45,553
<i>We had to go</i>
<i>before they opened up at 10:00</i>

814
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:50,191
<i>because I was getting worried</i>
<i>with the briefness of the bathing suits.</i>

815
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:54,567
<i>I was a little scared and I thought,</i>
<i>"Bettie, we might get arrested.</i>

816
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:56,572
<i>How do you feel about that?"</i>

817
00:49:56,674 --> 00:49:59,973
<i>And he says, "Oh, I wouldn't</i>
<i>want to, but you know.</i>

818
00:50:00,077 --> 00:50:01,567
<i>What are we going to do?"</i>

819
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,705
So we just took our chances.

820
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:08,046
<i>So they're very sensual pictures.</i>

821
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,345
<i>Very sexy.</i>

822
00:50:13,924 --> 00:50:15,687
<i>( boat motor humming )</i>

823
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:21,221
Bunny: <i>We went out on the boat</i>
<i>and it was late in the afternoon,</i>

824
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:24,665
<i>and the sun was already getting low.</i>

825
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:28,329
<i>But that made for</i>
<i>good shadowing of Bettie's body</i>

826
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:31,033
<i>for some beautiful nudes on the boat.</i>

827
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:34,201
<i>And she actually caught a fish</i>
<i>while I was shooting her.</i>

828
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,336
It was unbelievable.

829
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,972
<i>I had never seen anybody</i>
<i>catch a fish so fast.</i>

830
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,051
<i>We must have been in good waters.</i>

831
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:44,951
<i>But that picture that you see</i>
<i>of Bettie holding the fish up.</i>

832
00:50:45,055 --> 00:50:46,488
<i>That was for real.</i>

833
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:50,520
While we were shooting
some pinups on the beach one day,

834
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:54,028
I asked Bettie,
"Are you afraid of wild animals?"

835
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:56,964
<i>( tribal music playing )</i>

836
00:50:57,067 --> 00:50:59,900
Bunny: <i>I had seen</i>
<i>too many Tarzan movies, I think.</i>

837
00:51:00,003 --> 00:51:04,235
Bettie: <i>She set up a session</i>
<i>for me up in Boca Raton</i>

838
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:08,038
<i>at Little Africa</i>
<i>to pose with the animals.</i>

839
00:51:10,414 --> 00:51:12,974
Bunny: <i>When you come into Africa USA,</i>

840
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:16,052
<i>they had a greeter at the gate,</i>

841
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:17,950
<i>dressed all up like a native.</i>

842
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:20,649
<i>I said, "Would you like to take</i>
<i>some pictures with my model?"</i>

843
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:23,283
<i>He said, "Sure. "</i>
<i>He was happy about that.</i>

844
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:26,986
Bettie: <i>I was very fond</i>
<i>of my one-piece outfit</i>

845
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:30,123
<i>that I made</i>
<i>with the scallops and high bottoms.</i>

846
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,168
<i>I was dressed just like a cheetah.</i>

847
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:34,396
<i>There wasn't much to the bottom of it,</i>

848
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:38,601
<i>but maybe that was</i>
<i>the most alluring part of it.</i>

849
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:40,904
<i>I was very proud of that design.</i>

850
00:51:41,011 --> 00:51:43,036
<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

851
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:48,451
Bettie: <i>The pictures that sold the most</i>
<i>were with two cheetahs.</i>

852
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:50,179
<i>Beautiful animals.</i>

853
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:53,882
<i>They had been sick the night before</i>

854
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:56,152
<i>and they were in a bad temper.</i>

855
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,093
<i>I was afraid to be around 'em.</i>

856
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:04,767
Bunny: <i>The trainer said, "Please,</i>
<i>don't let go of that chain, Bettie,</i>

857
00:52:04,868 --> 00:52:06,392
<i>because if they run,</i>

858
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:09,097
<i>they run 55 miles and hour</i>
<i>and they'll be gone. "</i>

859
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:12,802
<i>She kept control,</i>

860
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,775
<i>and we got great pictures.</i>

861
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:20,148
<i>All my life I had worshiped</i>

862
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,481
<i>these pinup girls</i>
<i>on the calendars, and I thought,</i>

863
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:26,988
<i>"I'd love to shoot a calendar</i>
<i>of someone as beautiful as Bettie. "</i>

864
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:30,890
And I thought, the holiday season
will be coming up soon.

865
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:35,158
<i>And I had</i>
<i>this little white Christmas Tree.</i>

866
00:52:35,265 --> 00:52:37,790
<i>And I had her pose,</i>

867
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:40,665
<i>kneeling on a white shag rug.</i>

868
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:43,604
Bettie: <i>I didn't know that Bunny Yeager</i>

869
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:48,667
<i>was going to send pictures</i>
<i>to Mr. Hefner for Playboy Magazine.</i>

870
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:51,714
Hefner: <i>She was Miss January of 1955,</i>

871
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:55,546
<i>but Bettie had a fame</i>
<i>that kind of coincided</i>

872
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:59,713
<i>and predated</i>
<i>her appearance in Playboy.</i>

873
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:02,223
Bettie:
<i>You know, that little Santa Claus hat</i>

874
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:04,590
<i>and I'm winking,</i>
<i>and I'm sitting on my knees</i>

875
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:10,224
<i>with a little Christmas Tree ball</i>
<i>covering "you know where".</i>

876
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:11,801
<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

877
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:17,802
She had a very unique look
and also a very unique attitude.

878
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:27,144
Bettie: <i>Back in New York,</i>

879
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:29,014
<i>you couldn't work for lrving</i>

880
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,816
<i>without doing about an hour</i>
<i>or an hour and a half of bondage,</i>

881
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,788
<i>or you didn't get paid.</i>

882
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:47,965
<i>Bondage, I'm noted for being</i>

883
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:51,040
<i>the number one</i>
<i>bondage queen, they call me.</i>

884
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,006
<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

885
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:06,288
<i>Most of the work came</i>

886
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,257
<i>from requests he would get in the mail,</i>

887
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,554
<i>from doctors, lawyers,</i>

888
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:13,357
<i>businessmen,</i>

889
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:16,990
<i>men up in high society even,</i>

890
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,591
<i>wanted all of these things.</i>

891
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:25,599
Paula Klaw: <i>One was a big official</i>
<i>in the government</i>

892
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:28,803
<i>and one guy was a big lawyer.</i>

893
00:54:28,912 --> 00:54:30,971
Mark: <i>Are either</i>
<i>of these guys still alive?</i>

894
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:32,844
No, I don't think so.

895
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,941
<i>So you care to say who they were?</i>

896
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:36,917
No. Promises.

897
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,553
Paula Klaw: <i>The guy came in</i>
<i>with all the rubber outfits.</i>

898
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:42,386
<i>And there was leather.</i>

899
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:45,256
<i>There's a big leather fetish out there.</i>

900
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:48,263
<i>Men wanted her with the boots on.</i>

901
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:52,199
<i>Pay for it,</i>
<i>bring the costumes, we'll do it.</i>

902
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:57,503
Bettie: <i>For some reason,</i>
<i>men like to see girls,</i>

903
00:54:57,608 --> 00:54:59,405
<i>one spanking the other one.</i>

904
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:01,477
<i>Why, I don't know.</i>

905
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:06,072
<i>And they liked</i>
<i>to see women helpless, tied up.</i>

906
00:55:06,183 --> 00:55:08,549
<i>I never thought it was anything strange.</i>

907
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:14,924
Theakson: <i>Bettie had not been exposed</i>
<i>to this type of culture.</i>

908
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:18,222
She was instructed
that this is what the job was.

909
00:55:18,328 --> 00:55:19,795
To her it was acting.

910
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:23,263
<i>Which she enjoyed doing,</i>
<i>which is why her bondage stuff</i>

911
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:26,336
<i>is just so terrific,</i>
<i>because she's acting.</i>

912
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:30,600
<i>She's making believe</i>
<i>that she's terrified.</i>

913
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,640
<i>For the most part,</i>
<i>anybody in a bondage photograph is</i>

914
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:37,771
<i>just going on</i>
<i>like half-assed, hardly doing it.</i>

915
00:55:37,881 --> 00:55:39,906
<i>Bettie was acting.</i>

916
00:55:52,195 --> 00:55:55,631
Bettie: <i>Paula, she was the only one</i>
<i>that ever tied us up.</i>

917
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:59,427
<i>She didn't hurt us,</i>
<i>she was very careful about it.</i>

918
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:02,471
Paula Klaw:
<i>She felt safe with me being there.</i>

919
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:05,063
Don't hurt the babies, you know.

920
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:09,407
Bettie: <i>Some of the pictures</i>
<i>looked like I was really being hurt.</i>

921
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:13,813
<i>There was only one time</i>
<i>that I was ever frightened.</i>

922
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:18,684
<i>Some guy, some lawyer</i>
<i>I think he was, wanted me tied up.</i>

923
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:21,952
<i>And my feet were off the ground</i>
<i>about six inches.</i>

924
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:25,927
<i>I thought my arm holes</i>
<i>were going to pull out of the sockets.</i>

925
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:27,587
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"Hurry up, it's hurting me. "</i>

926
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:30,667
<i>And they kept shooting me</i>
<i>from all kinds of angles.</i>

927
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:33,702
<i>And finally they let me down.</i>

928
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:37,706
<i>And Irving later told me</i>
<i>that those pictures sold more</i>

929
00:56:37,808 --> 00:56:39,799
<i>than any picture that he'd ever sold</i>

930
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,071
<i>of movie stars than anybody else.</i>

931
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:43,908
<i>( Bettie laughs )</i>

932
00:56:51,988 --> 00:56:54,957
<i>About two months later...</i>

933
00:56:56,293 --> 00:57:00,787
<i>I was doing</i>
<i>a little 16mm wrestling movie.</i>

934
00:57:00,897 --> 00:57:03,024
<i>I heard something pop.</i>

935
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:06,660
<i>I couldn't straighten out</i>
<i>my right knee at all.</i>

936
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,170
<i>Finally, I called a doctor.</i>

937
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:12,435
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"It'll be about a six inch scar. "</i>

938
00:57:12,542 --> 00:57:16,774
<i>He said, "You won't be able</i>
<i>to do your pinup modeling anymore. "</i>

939
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:21,949
<i>I was lying in bed</i>
<i>feeling very unhappy</i>

940
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:25,818
<i>at the thought that</i>
<i>I wouldn't be able to model anymore.</i>

941
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:29,358
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>
<i>I heard a man's voice</i>

942
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:34,158
<i>just as loud and clear</i>
<i>as you'd hear any human talk.</i>

943
00:57:34,264 --> 00:57:39,133
<i>He said, "Bettie, you can</i>
<i>straighten out your knee. Try it. "</i>

944
00:57:39,236 --> 00:57:44,173
<i>And within a couple of seconds</i>
<i>I was able to straighten out my knee.</i>

945
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:48,506
<i>I knew immediately</i>
<i>it was the voice of God.</i>

946
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,271
Theakson: <i>She was the girl next door.</i>

947
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:58,812
Just so good,
and went to church on Sunday,

948
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:02,585
that women identified with,
that they liked the idea

949
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:04,660
that they could exude sexuality

950
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:08,697
<i>and not be thought of as a tramp,</i>

951
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,962
<i>that she's playing a role,</i>

952
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:14,559
<i>whether it be dominatrix</i>

953
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:16,229
<i>or the girl next door,</i>

954
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:20,275
and it was never demeaning
at any point whatsoever.

955
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:28,409
Bettie: <i>The craziest request I ever had,</i>

956
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:31,385
<i>this guy wanted me to pose</i>

957
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:33,979
<i>in a black leather pony outfit</i>

958
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:37,025
<i>that he sent to Irving and Paula.</i>

959
00:58:37,127 --> 00:58:40,096
<i>I had to get on all fours like a horse,</i>

960
00:58:40,197 --> 00:58:43,325
<i>and my head covered up</i>
<i>with this hood on.</i>

961
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:46,834
<i>I said, "Well, how would he even know</i>
<i>who was under there at all?"</i>

962
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:49,735
<i>You couldn't even see my face.</i>

963
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,298
<i>We died laughing about it.</i>

964
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,378
And some we turned away.

965
00:58:55,478 --> 00:58:59,209
<i>Well, there were no nudes,</i>
<i>that's number one.</i>

966
00:58:59,316 --> 00:59:03,218
<i>If there were men</i>
<i>in the pictures, it was pornographic.</i>

967
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,153
And we didn't want to sell
anything that was pornographic.

968
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:10,022
<i>( Menning speaking )</i>

969
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:27,170
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

970
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:29,973
Bettie: <i>These two guys</i>
<i>came to me and said,</i>

971
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,447
<i>"Bettie, we want you to testify</i>
<i>against Irving Klaw as a pornographer. "</i>

972
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:37,746
<i>I said, "What are you talking about?</i>
<i>Irving never even did nudes. "</i>

973
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:40,948
They'd come in with search warrants.

974
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:43,082
<i>They took a bunch of stuff.</i>

975
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:47,027
<i>They took a lot of the photographs</i>
<i>and negatives of the models.</i>

976
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:51,692
<i>They confiscated our mail</i>
<i>and we were getting bad publicity.</i>

977
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:54,964
<i>( dramatic classical music playing )</i>

978
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,932
<i>( gavel bangs )</i>

979
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,770
Male announcer: <i>Repercussions</i>
<i>from the New York hearings</i>

980
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:02,868
<i>have been nationwide,</i>
<i>with contempt and perjury citations</i>

981
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:05,379
<i>indicated by the committee.</i>

982
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:07,575
Bettie: <i>Now there's supposed</i>
<i>to be a young boy,</i>

983
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:11,950
<i>I think he was 17 years old,</i>
<i>somewhere in Florida.</i>

984
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:14,285
<i>The Kefauver committee was blaming me</i>

985
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,689
<i>for contributing to juvenile delinquency</i>

986
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:20,524
<i>because this boy killed himself</i>
<i>looking at one of my bondage pictures.</i>

987
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:23,326
<i>What would I have to do with that?</i>

988
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:26,699
Man: <i>Sir, I direct</i>
<i>your attention specifically</i>

989
01:00:26,803 --> 01:00:30,364
<i>to page 3 of this publication,</i>
<i>showing a young lady trussed up.</i>

990
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:32,168
<i>And ask you to look at that picture,</i>

991
01:00:32,275 --> 01:00:35,210
<i>with her arms tied</i>
<i>behind her back, her mouth gagged.</i>

992
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:36,779
There is a definite connection

993
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,849
between this sort of thing
and his death.

994
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:45,317
Bettie: <i>They made me</i>
<i>come down to the courthouse,</i>

995
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:48,550
<i>and they had me</i>
<i>sit outside the courtroom</i>

996
01:00:48,658 --> 01:00:51,286
<i>while they had Irving on the stand.</i>

997
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:56,632
Man: <i>Mr. Chairman,</i>
<i>our investigation reveals</i>

998
01:00:56,733 --> 01:01:01,966
<i>that Mr. Klaw is one of</i>
<i>the largest distributors</i>

999
01:01:02,072 --> 01:01:05,530
<i>of obscene, lewd,</i>
<i>and fetish photographs</i>

1000
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:08,475
<i>throughout the country by mail.</i>

1001
01:01:08,578 --> 01:01:11,638
I decline to answer

1002
01:01:11,748 --> 01:01:15,844
under the Fifth Amendment
of the Constitution.

1003
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:20,480
Well, Mr. Klaw, I must warn you that

1004
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:22,990
I'll have you cited for contempt.

1005
01:01:23,093 --> 01:01:25,118
Do you still refuse to answer?

1006
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:27,662
I decline to answer.

1007
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:31,165
Would that be sufficient or should I say
it all the way through, Mr. Kefauver?

1008
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:33,235
Kefauver: <i>We're not asking any quarter</i>

1009
01:01:33,336 --> 01:01:35,167
<i>nor giving any quarter, Mr. Klaw.</i>

1010
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:38,037
Bettie: <i>Those creeps.</i>

1011
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:39,836
<i>Ol' Kefauver and his committee.</i>

1012
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:43,379
<i>I told them, "I'm not testifying</i>
<i>and lying about Irving Klaw. "</i>

1013
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,744
<i>I said, "I don't care.</i>
<i>You can't force me to do it. "</i>

1014
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:47,714
<i>I said, "I won't do it. "</i>

1015
01:01:52,655 --> 01:01:55,283
But we also went before the judge.

1016
01:01:55,392 --> 01:01:58,691
<i>And the judge said,</i>
<i>"You want to keep your freedom,</i>

1017
01:01:58,795 --> 01:02:02,094
<i>you have to destroy all the negatives. "</i>

1018
01:02:02,198 --> 01:02:05,827
I said that was wrong.

1019
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:09,063
We have every right to do
and print whatever we like.

1020
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:10,969
We're not hurting anybody.

1021
01:02:12,008 --> 01:02:16,672
<i>And so I was the one that was</i>
<i>in charge of chucking it away.</i>

1022
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,748
<i>But I didn't.</i>

1023
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:24,851
We did hide them,
until we were sure that the courts

1024
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:26,615
would throw it out

1025
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:29,317
and agree that this was not pornography.

1026
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:33,760
<i>I kept the ones I know I could sell,</i>
<i>just the ones with Bettie.</i>

1027
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:38,891
<i>I knew one day</i>
<i>these were going to be famous.</i>

1028
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:42,460
Bettie: <i>She was able</i>
<i>to sneak a few of mine away</i>

1029
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:44,870
<i>that they didn't know about.</i>

1030
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:47,602
<i>Nearly all three-fourths of his pictures</i>

1031
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,440
<i>that he had taken</i>
<i>in his movie star photos and all,</i>

1032
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:51,946
<i>they were all burned.</i>

1033
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:53,982
<i>And it just ruined the poor man</i>

1034
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:57,747
<i>and put him in bad health,</i>
<i>and he ended up dying.</i>

1035
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:04,754
<i>I always thought, live and let live.</i>

1036
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:06,761
<i>Let anybody do what they want to do</i>

1037
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:09,525
<i>as long as they're</i>
<i>not hurting anybody else.</i>

1038
01:03:09,632 --> 01:03:12,795
<i>I still feel that way.</i>

1039
01:03:12,902 --> 01:03:15,302
Mark: <i>There was</i>
<i>a lot of people in America</i>

1040
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:17,999
<i>that would have considered</i>
<i>what you were doing</i>

1041
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:19,803
<i>to be nasty back in those days.</i>

1042
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:24,403
<i>I never thought</i>
<i>I was doing anything wrong.</i>

1043
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:27,813
<i>I never even thought there was</i>
<i>anything wrong about the bondage.</i>

1044
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:34,622
<i>The only thing I regret</i>
<i>in all of my modeling experience,</i>

1045
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:38,524
<i>one time three</i>
<i>camera clubs got together.</i>

1046
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:43,691
<i>And they got me</i>
<i>to drinking blackberry brandy,</i>

1047
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,496
<i>it's very tasty, you know.</i>

1048
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:51,267
<i>And I must have gotten drunk,</i>
<i>the only time in my life I was drunk.</i>

1049
01:03:51,374 --> 01:03:53,069
<i>But I don't remember what happened,</i>

1050
01:03:53,176 --> 01:03:54,768
<i>I remember starting to pose for them</i>

1051
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:59,212
<i>in my regular poses</i>
<i>but never open poses.</i>

1052
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:01,943
<i>And there were four or five shots.</i>

1053
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:04,485
<i>And I was so disappointed in it.</i>

1054
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:06,612
<i>That's one of the reasons</i>
<i>I left New York,</i>

1055
01:04:06,723 --> 01:04:10,716
<i>was because of those pornographic</i>
<i>pictures being sold on me.</i>

1056
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:18,457
<i>I was 34 in 1957,</i>

1057
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:21,833
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>I was getting too old to model.</i>

1058
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:24,532
<i>And that there were</i>
<i>so many pictures of me around,</i>

1059
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:28,236
<i>I thought the photographers</i>
<i>were tired of shooting me.</i>

1060
01:04:28,344 --> 01:04:33,111
<i>And then too I'd had all that unhappy</i>
<i>experience with the Kefauver committee.</i>

1061
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:36,208
<i>So I just left everything.</i>

1062
01:04:42,592 --> 01:04:46,028
She just disappeared
and there was much mystique about her.

1063
01:04:46,129 --> 01:04:49,360
Nobody knew beyond that,

1064
01:04:49,465 --> 01:04:52,400
that their was
a fascinating story about this woman,

1065
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:57,303
who reached the peak of popularity
in her profession and disappeared.

1066
01:04:57,407 --> 01:05:00,843
Over my years of research,
I heard a lot of crazy rumors.

1067
01:05:00,944 --> 01:05:04,243
That she was slinging hash in Texas,

1068
01:05:04,347 --> 01:05:07,475
<i>that she had married Lash LaRue,</i>

1069
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:10,678
that she had moved to England
and married a duke.

1070
01:05:10,787 --> 01:05:14,814
That the mob had rubbed her out
because of a photo shoot gone bad.

1071
01:05:14,924 --> 01:05:17,722
That she had passed out literature

1072
01:05:17,827 --> 01:05:20,921
in the Chicago O'Hare airport
for Billy Graham.

1073
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:23,362
That was the only one that was true.

1074
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:27,529
The whole Bettie Page phenomenon,

1075
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:29,298
which is separate
from the human being,

1076
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:31,339
<i>developed while</i>
<i>she was simply off the scene,</i>

1077
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:34,706
<i>and she was not really aware of it.</i>

1078
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:37,336
Bettie: <i>It still amazes me</i>

1079
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:39,711
<i>after 40 years,</i>

1080
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,307
<i>as popular as my pictures are now,</i>

1081
01:05:42,418 --> 01:05:44,716
<i>especially with young people.</i>

1082
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:48,450
<i>Most of the boys say</i>
<i>they learned about me</i>

1083
01:05:48,558 --> 01:05:53,188
<i>from their fathers' girly magazines</i>
<i>that they found in the attic,</i>

1084
01:05:53,296 --> 01:05:57,232
<i>or prowling through their fathers'</i>
<i>dresser drawers and things like that.</i>

1085
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,891
<i>( Bettie chuckles )</i>

1086
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:03,962
<i>And they claim that I opened up</i>
<i>the sexual revolution.</i>

1087
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:05,438
<i>( chuckles )</i>

1088
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:08,635
Robert Blue: <i>The first time</i>
<i>that I ever saw Bettie Page</i>

1089
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:13,114
in any of this material, I mean,
I immediately recognized her

1090
01:06:13,216 --> 01:06:17,550
<i>as someone that had the visual power</i>

1091
01:06:17,654 --> 01:06:21,613
<i>to provoke something inside.</i>

1092
01:06:23,726 --> 01:06:26,593
<i>I was thinking</i>
<i>that I was doing something</i>

1093
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:31,326
<i>that was part of</i>
<i>the modernist movement of painting</i>

1094
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:35,666
<i>and that was to take</i>
<i>a taboo photograph,</i>

1095
01:06:35,772 --> 01:06:39,173
<i>blow it up bigger than life-size</i>
<i>in a beautiful oil painting,</i>

1096
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:42,005
<i>and put it in a high-end gallery.</i>

1097
01:06:42,111 --> 01:06:45,603
<i>Bettie Page really set the stage</i>

1098
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:48,684
<i>for the vogue photographers</i>

1099
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:51,879
<i>that came in the '7 0s and the '80s.</i>

1100
01:06:54,324 --> 01:06:56,918
Olivia De Berardinis: <i>There's never</i>
<i>been anyone like Bettie before.</i>

1101
01:06:57,026 --> 01:06:59,256
Monroe had Harlow and Dietrich,

1102
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:01,592
she had all those blond bombshells,

1103
01:07:01,698 --> 01:07:04,394
but Bettie,
there was nothing like Bettie.

1104
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,663
She's the first icon of her nature.

1105
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,795
<i>And feminism has changed,</i>

1106
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:12,204
so women are actually using sexuality

1107
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:14,708
in a different way,
they're more accepting of it.

1108
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:16,802
I would paint a few pictures

1109
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,507
and then I would see them
appear in front of me.

1110
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:23,450
<i>And the girls would start</i>
<i>showing up dressed like her.</i>

1111
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:24,884
<i>Either they had purple hair,</i>

1112
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:27,455
but they'd have the Bettie Page bangs,
they'd be tattooed.

1113
01:07:27,557 --> 01:07:31,186
It'd be a form of Bettie, but different.

1114
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:33,262
<i>Bettie meant something to them.</i>

1115
01:07:33,363 --> 01:07:38,528
So I kept painting Bettie for them.

1116
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:45,773
<i>The fetishistic outfits that she wore,</i>

1117
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,309
<i>I mean, those are dreams to paint.</i>

1118
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:51,539
<i>You know, the seam stockings,</i>
<i>the garter belts,</i>

1119
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:55,515
<i>the snub-nosed stilettos, and that hair.</i>

1120
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:58,781
<i>It's a lot of fun to paint those things.</i>

1121
01:07:58,888 --> 01:08:03,018
<i>Her attitude, her eyes,</i>
<i>the steam that rises from them.</i>

1122
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:04,957
<i>That's the most important thing to me.</i>

1123
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:09,064
<i>She makes it accessible that</i>
<i>anybody can be having this fun,</i>

1124
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:11,429
<i>you're not going to go to hell for it.</i>

1125
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:13,229
<i>( spank slaps skin )</i>

1126
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:16,896
<i>When AIDS came out as the huge plague,</i>

1127
01:08:17,006 --> 01:08:21,136
<i>and anybody who had sex could get it</i>
<i>and die this horrible death,</i>

1128
01:08:21,244 --> 01:08:25,476
<i>I think that people</i>
<i>really identify with Bettie as fantasy</i>

1129
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:28,675
<i>instead of the actual sex act,</i>

1130
01:08:28,785 --> 01:08:32,221
<i>so it was just a matter of survival.</i>

1131
01:08:33,956 --> 01:08:37,392
<i>I could see that Bettie</i>
<i>was getting more popular</i>

1132
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:39,688
<i>in so many other directions.</i>

1133
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:43,527
<i>And Dave Stevens'</i>
<i>the Rocketeer happened.</i>

1134
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,624
I came across a full page photograph

1135
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:47,760
of her standing in water

1136
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,929
<i>in a little bikini that she made</i>

1137
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:52,940
<i>and just was knocked out, totally.</i>

1138
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:57,342
<i>I remember thinking,</i>
<i>this has got to be the most attractive,</i>

1139
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,915
<i>she just exuded health</i>

1140
01:09:00,016 --> 01:09:04,282
<i>and joy and everything else</i>
<i>that's like so appealing.</i>

1141
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:21,470
Dave's foundation
certainly led to the Betty Pages.

1142
01:09:22,672 --> 01:09:25,800
<i>At the time, nobody</i>
<i>had reprinted a picture of Bettie Page</i>

1143
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:28,433
<i>in two or three decades.</i>

1144
01:09:29,846 --> 01:09:33,441
<i>The first issue of the Betty Pages</i>
<i>sold out in two weeks.</i>

1145
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:35,039
<i>But word filtered back immediately.</i>

1146
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:36,618
<i>Can you do a reprint of this?</i>

1147
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,917
<i>It sold out instantly</i>
<i>on the newsstands, I had no idea.</i>

1148
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:43,423
<i>And when I say newsstands,</i>
<i>I mean comic book stores,</i>

1149
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:45,960
<i>that was my only</i>
<i>distribution outlet at the time.</i>

1150
01:09:46,062 --> 01:09:48,530
<i>But there was an audience waiting.</i>

1151
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:50,861
<i>Thank you, Dave Stevens.</i>

1152
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,401
<i>The readers</i>
<i>already knew who she was.</i>

1153
01:09:54,504 --> 01:09:57,064
Olivia: <i>Then Bettie</i>
<i>really became bigger</i>

1154
01:09:57,173 --> 01:09:59,368
<i>in the fashion world:</i>

1155
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:01,409
<i>Gaultier, Muggler,</i>

1156
01:10:01,511 --> 01:10:03,502
<i>the S&M world, through Madonna.</i>

1162
01:10:16,993 --> 01:10:19,723
<i>she was a force to be reckoned with.</i>

1163
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:23,629
<i>She just became part of the culture.</i>

1164
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:26,531
Bob Shultz and I started this club,

1165
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:29,127
<i>the "Bettie Scouts"--</i>
<i>tongue and cheek title,</i>

1166
01:10:29,272 --> 01:10:32,207
kind of line Boy Scouts of America,
but Bettie Scouts of America--

1167
01:10:32,308 --> 01:10:34,037
'cause we spent a lot of time
going around the country

1168
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:36,111
scouting for Bettie Page.

1169
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:37,372
<i>And when we started it,</i>

1170
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,846
<i>we did not know</i>
<i>if Bettie was still alive.</i>

1171
01:10:41,884 --> 01:10:44,375
<i>My gut feeling was</i>
<i>she had probably passed away,</i>

1172
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:47,149
<i>'cause I couldn't understand</i>
<i>how somebody could be under the radar</i>

1173
01:10:47,256 --> 01:10:50,248
<i>that many years, when people</i>
<i>were actively looking for her.</i>

1174
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:55,921
<i>I got a call from a reporter</i>

1175
01:10:56,032 --> 01:10:59,058
in Nashville, Tennessee
named Thomas Goldsmith.

1176
01:10:59,168 --> 01:11:03,696
<i>I would give him credit</i>
<i>with finding Bettie Page.</i>

1177
01:11:03,806 --> 01:11:06,172
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"Do you know where Bettie's at?"</i>

1178
01:11:06,275 --> 01:11:08,300
And I said,
"No, I'm just like all the rest

1179
01:11:08,411 --> 01:11:10,345
in the people in the country
trying to figure out

1180
01:11:10,446 --> 01:11:12,346
<i>what happened to Bettie Page. "</i>

1181
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:15,611
<i>He said, "Bettie Page is alive.</i>

1182
01:11:15,718 --> 01:11:17,310
<i>And I'm gonna give you a big clue.</i>

1183
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:21,356
She has a living brother in Nashville."

1184
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:23,789
<i>Within minutes, I called Jack Page.</i>

1185
01:11:23,893 --> 01:11:27,522
<i>I said, "If I write a letter to Bettie,</i>

1186
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,394
<i>would you forward it to her?"</i>

1187
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:33,263
And I wrote the letter,
I believe it was, April--

1188
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:36,065
April, May, 1992.

1189
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:39,835
I didn't hear anything
'til December of 1992.

1190
01:11:39,942 --> 01:11:41,170
And I could remember that,

1191
01:11:41,277 --> 01:11:44,246
that was one of
the most excited days of my life.

1192
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:47,077
I went to the mailbox
and here's a letter,

1193
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:50,812
<i>and it says in the corner,</i>
<i>"Bettie Page. "</i>

1194
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:55,051
<i>She used to write everything</i>
<i>in this turquoise ink.</i>

1195
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:56,715
<i>Very identifiable ink.</i>

1196
01:11:56,826 --> 01:11:58,191
<i>It's like her trademark.</i>

1197
01:11:58,294 --> 01:12:01,161
<i>And she was so flattered</i>
<i>to have a fan club,</i>

1198
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:02,525
<i>she couldn't believe that people</i>

1199
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:04,657
<i>had any interest in her</i>
<i>after all these years.</i>

1200
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:08,669
<i>For about a year,</i>
<i>we did this little relay of letters.</i>

1201
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:12,138
<i>And then finally in August of 1999,</i>

1202
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:15,335
my wife and I drove out to California

1203
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:18,038
and met Bettie face to face.

1204
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:21,583
<i>We spent a lot of time</i>
<i>talking about the Bible,</i>

1205
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:23,345
<i>because she loved the Bible.</i>

1206
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:27,252
<i>And I enjoy reading the Bible too,</i>
<i>so we just had a good old time.</i>

1207
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:29,051
And then to think, you know,

1208
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:31,524
here I'm just a guy
collecting old magazines

1209
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:35,586
and kind of becomes infatuated
with this pinup girl from the '50s,

1210
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:37,461
<i>and to think that this could materialize</i>

1211
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:43,095
<i>to the point that I get to meet her,</i>
<i>her family, her sisters, her brothers.</i>

1212
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:46,368
Mark: <i>Now, did your family know</i>
<i>that you were a pinup model?</i>

1213
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:48,773
Bettie: <i>They never said</i>
<i>a word to me about it,</i>

1214
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:51,472
<i>never commented about it</i>
<i>and nether did my mother.</i>

1215
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:56,745
<i>One time, I was looking in her closet</i>
<i>when she was gone to work,</i>

1216
01:12:56,852 --> 01:12:59,821
<i>and I found a whole big stack</i>

1217
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:02,584
<i>of Robert Harrison's pinup magazines,</i>

1218
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:04,683
<i>with my pictures marked</i>

1219
01:13:04,794 --> 01:13:07,786
<i>and the pages turned down in it.</i>

1220
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:10,457
<i>Never said a word to me,</i>
<i>one way or another about it,</i>

1221
01:13:10,566 --> 01:13:12,932
<i>never even mentioned it</i>
<i>and I didn't either.</i>

1222
01:13:17,406 --> 01:13:21,672
Theakson: <i>She was living way out</i>
<i>in the fringes of Los Angeles,</i>

1223
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:25,508
<i>you went any further,</i>
<i>there was no more humanity.</i>

1224
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:28,344
<i>And she explained</i>
<i>that she'd had some difficulties</i>

1225
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:31,386
<i>and that she was</i>
<i>on Social Security.</i>

1226
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:35,717
Mark: <i>Now, when you walked away</i>
<i>from the modeling career,</i>

1227
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:37,417
<i>you never really</i>
<i>looked back at it, did you?</i>

1228
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:39,517
Bettie: <i>I didn't want to be bothered.</i>

1229
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:44,088
<i>I'd rather be incognito,</i>
<i>like I am nowadays.</i>

1230
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,462
<i>( Bettie chuckles )</i>

1231
01:13:47,369 --> 01:13:50,361
<i>After I left New York,</i>
<i>I went back to Florida,</i>

1232
01:13:50,473 --> 01:13:54,910
<i>and I just wanted to enjoy</i>
<i>the sunshine and do something else.</i>

1233
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:58,741
<i>I started up</i>
<i>with my old boyfriend Armond Walterson</i>

1234
01:13:58,848 --> 01:14:01,612
<i>that I had dated in 1954</i>

1235
01:14:01,717 --> 01:14:04,015
<i>when I was in Florida</i>
<i>posing for Bunny Yeager.</i>

1236
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,714
<i>He was going with Margaret.</i>

1237
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,119
<i>As soon as I called him up</i>

1238
01:14:08,224 --> 01:14:10,055
<i>he dropped Margaret</i>
<i>like a hot potato</i>

1239
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,525
<i>and started dating me.</i>

1240
01:14:12,628 --> 01:14:15,358
<i>Every Saturday night,</i>
<i>we'd go to the drive in</i>

1241
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:17,728
<i>and we would sit</i>
<i>in the car and make love.</i>

1242
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:19,767
<i>We didn't watch</i>
<i>the movies half the time.</i>

1243
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:21,131
<i>( Bettie chuckles )</i>

1244
01:14:21,237 --> 01:14:24,468
<i>When I met him,</i>
<i>he didn't even know how to kiss.</i>

1245
01:14:24,573 --> 01:14:27,542
<i>I taught him everything he knew.</i>

1246
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:30,737
<i>He learned fast though.</i>

1247
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:33,440
<i>Two months after the wedding,</i>

1248
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:36,313
<i>I realized that I made a mistake.</i>

1249
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:39,546
<i>All we had in common was movies,</i>

1250
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:42,055
<i>sex, and hamburgers.</i>

1251
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:46,024
<i>If ever I've been stupid</i>
<i>about anything in my life</i>

1252
01:14:46,128 --> 01:14:49,757
<i>it's where men</i>
<i>are concerned about marriage.</i>

1253
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:52,629
<i>Here's what broke it all up.</i>

1254
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:54,828
<i>This was the beginning</i>
<i>of New Year's 1958.</i>

1255
01:14:54,937 --> 01:14:57,735
<i>We got into a big argument</i>

1256
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,468
<i>because he wanted to go</i>
<i>and get drunk with his buddies,</i>

1257
01:15:00,576 --> 01:15:03,670
<i>and I wanted to go dancing</i>
<i>like I'd been in the habit of doing</i>

1258
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:05,610
<i>on New Year's Eve,</i>

1259
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:10,014
<i>so he left at about 20 minutes to 12.</i>

1260
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:11,916
<i>And I went walking out White Street.</i>

1261
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:17,754
<i>And I saw a little church over there,</i>

1262
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,454
<i>and heard music, singing.</i>

1263
01:15:20,563 --> 01:15:24,363
<i>It had a white neon cross</i>
<i>over the top of it.</i>

1264
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:30,297
<i>And I just had to go,</i>
<i>like somebody had me by the hand,</i>

1265
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:33,398
<i>I had to cross the street</i>
<i>and go in there, I'm telling you.</i>

1266
01:15:33,509 --> 01:15:37,707
<i>I knew it was the Lord, nobody would</i>
<i>ever convince me it wasn't him.</i>

1267
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:41,747
<i>I stood back there</i>
<i>and cried about all my sins.</i>

1268
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:46,049
<i>I thought God disapproved</i>
<i>of me doing nudes, you know.</i>

1269
01:15:46,155 --> 01:15:48,419
<i>I didn't think anything</i>
<i>about the fetish and the bondage</i>

1270
01:15:48,524 --> 01:15:50,219
<i>for Irving, but I had to do that.</i>

1271
01:15:50,326 --> 01:15:53,489
<i>But I thought maybe He looked down</i>
<i>on me for posing in the nude.</i>

1272
01:15:53,596 --> 01:15:56,588
<i>That's what I was telling</i>
<i>the pastor, and he said,</i>

1273
01:15:56,699 --> 01:16:00,191
<i>"Have you ever done anything</i>
<i>as bad as the apostle Paul?"</i>

1274
01:16:00,302 --> 01:16:02,167
<i>I said, "What did he do?"</i>

1275
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:04,000
<i>I didn't know the Bible.</i>

1276
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,472
<i>He said, "Well, he had</i>
<i>the Christians murdered.</i>

1277
01:16:06,575 --> 01:16:08,440
<i>Have you ever done</i>
<i>anything that bad?"</i>

1278
01:16:08,544 --> 01:16:10,569
<i>I said, "No, of course not. "</i>

1279
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:12,670
<i>He said, "Well, God forgave him</i>

1280
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:15,113
<i>and made him</i>
<i>the greatest missionary of all time.</i>

1281
01:16:15,217 --> 01:16:19,381
<i>He can certainly forgive you for posing</i>
<i>in the nude, don't you think?"</i>

1282
01:16:19,488 --> 01:16:22,616
<i>And I received</i>
<i>the Lord Jesus as my savior</i>

1283
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:26,161
<i>and I turned my life over to the Lord,</i>

1284
01:16:26,262 --> 01:16:30,961
<i>and went to Bible schools</i>
<i>for three years.</i>

1285
01:16:31,066 --> 01:16:32,556
<i>They were very strict, you know.</i>

1286
01:16:32,668 --> 01:16:35,432
<i>I always loved dancing.</i>

1287
01:16:35,537 --> 01:16:38,028
<i>I couldn't even go dancing,</i>
<i>couldn't even go to the movies.</i>

1288
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,233
<i>The only movie</i>
<i>I was allowed to attend</i>

1289
01:16:40,342 --> 01:16:43,641
<i>during those three years</i>
<i>was</i> The Ten Commandments.

1290
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,538
<i>I wanted to be a missionary.</i>

1291
01:16:46,649 --> 01:16:48,276
<i>I thought God</i>
<i>wanted me to be a missionary.</i>

1292
01:16:48,384 --> 01:16:52,150
<i>But you know, when I graduated</i>
<i>and I went to a mission board,</i>

1293
01:16:52,254 --> 01:16:56,088
<i>they would not take me</i>
<i>because I had been divorced.</i>

1294
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:59,126
<i>To some Christians,</i>
<i>especially the fundamentalists,</i>

1295
01:16:59,228 --> 01:17:02,891
<i>being divorced is worse</i>
<i>than having committed murder!</i>

1296
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,161
<i>They got me to believe</i>
<i>that I would be out of the will of God</i>

1297
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:10,067
<i>if I didn't go back</i>
<i>and lead my first husband</i>

1298
01:17:10,172 --> 01:17:12,800
<i>to the Lord and marry him again.</i>

1299
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:16,400
<i>Well, I led him to the Lord</i>
<i>and he prayed with me to receive Jesus</i>

1300
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:18,537
<i>and I thought he was sincere</i>

1301
01:17:18,647 --> 01:17:20,945
<i>and I married him again.</i>

1302
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:24,178
<i>One month I was in his house.</i>

1303
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:27,119
<i>The man would</i>
<i>not even have sex with me.</i>

1304
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:28,780
<i>And I see him, I said,</i>
<i>"What's the matter, Billy?"</i>

1305
01:17:28,891 --> 01:17:31,223
<i>He said, "Well, you're filthy.</i>
<i>You've still got a venereal disease. "</i>

1306
01:17:31,327 --> 01:17:33,522
<i>I said, "Where did you ever hear</i>
<i>anything like that?"</i>

1307
01:17:33,629 --> 01:17:35,187
<i>He said, "Everybody knows it. "</i>

1308
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:39,393
<i>I said, "Everybody's a liar, I've never</i>
<i>had a venereal disease in my life. "</i>

1309
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:43,434
<i>Well, do you know,</i>
<i>he grabbed me by the throat,</i>

1310
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:45,166
<i>I mean, he was choking me.</i>

1311
01:17:45,274 --> 01:17:49,040
<i>I was finally able to get his hands off</i>
<i>enough to scream out loud,</i>

1312
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:51,977
<i>"Billy, if you kill me,</i>
<i>God will never forgive you!"</i>

1313
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:55,881
<i>He let go, and he got up</i>
<i>and went in his room.</i>

1314
01:17:55,985 --> 01:17:58,215
<i>The man almost choked me to death.</i>

1315
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,778
<i>But that was the worst thing</i>
<i>that ever happened to me.</i>

1316
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:04,051
<i>I almost lost my life over it.</i>

1317
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:08,658
<i>I had the thing annulled right away,</i>

1318
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:11,631
<i>since it was never</i>
<i>consummated sexually.</i>

1319
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:15,194
<i>After I spent a year and a half</i>

1320
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:17,966
<i>working on</i>
<i>a masters degree at Peabody,</i>

1321
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:22,601
<i>I just lacked four credits now,</i>
<i>getting the masters,</i>

1322
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:25,373
<i>and I just got tired of studying.</i>

1323
01:18:25,481 --> 01:18:27,506
<i>So I left Nashville.</i>

1324
01:18:27,616 --> 01:18:33,020
<i>I went back to Miami</i>
<i>and I started going dancing again.</i>

1325
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:38,184
<i>And one night</i>
<i>I saw this handsome fella.</i>

1326
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:41,694
She didn't look like a model
of any kind, you know.

1327
01:18:41,797 --> 01:18:45,289
She's just a healthy looking young lady.

1328
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:47,892
Well, not so young,
she was in her forties,

1329
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:50,972
<i>but just looked like a nice person.</i>

1330
01:18:51,073 --> 01:18:53,940
So I went out on the floor
and asked her to dance,

1331
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:56,568
and she says, "Certainly,
I'd love to dance with you."

1332
01:18:56,678 --> 01:19:00,307
<i>So we danced and we danced,</i>
<i>we danced all night.</i>

1333
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:03,180
She was the most unpretentious person

1334
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:04,946
that I have ever met.

1335
01:19:05,054 --> 01:19:10,048
<i>I called her the next day</i>
<i>and we were inseparable.</i>

1336
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,024
Bettie: <i>He was divorced.</i>

1337
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,617
<i>He says, "I have two boys and a girl. "</i>

1338
01:19:13,729 --> 01:19:16,596
<i>I said, "Two boys and a girl,</i>
<i>that's what I always wanted. "</i>

1339
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:21,461
<i>Well, I couldn't have children,</i>
<i>I tried for years.</i>

1340
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:26,007
<i>But I was attracted</i>
<i>to Harry from the word "go".</i>

1341
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:30,204
<i>I just wanted to be with him</i>
<i>and to make love to him.</i>

1342
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:32,041
Harry: <i>I didn't know a thing about her.</i>

1343
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:34,308
We went out on this pier,

1344
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:37,874
and I was looking through the post cards

1345
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:40,955
<i>and I saw this post card</i>
<i>and I looked at that post card,</i>

1346
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:43,854
<i>and I looked over at her</i>
<i>and I looked at the card again.</i>

1347
01:19:43,959 --> 01:19:45,586
<i>It was Bettie.</i>

1348
01:19:45,694 --> 01:19:49,494
Bettie: <i>It says, "Wow! We alligators</i>
<i>have such fun in Florida. "</i>

1349
01:19:49,598 --> 01:19:51,225
<i>( Bettie chuckles )</i>

1350
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:55,432
Harry: <i>She told me</i>
<i>that she modeled a lot.</i>

1351
01:19:55,537 --> 01:19:58,768
And she told me
she never posed nude.

1352
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:00,933
<i>( Harry laughs )</i>

1353
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:04,376
<i>It didn't make any difference to me.</i>

1354
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,471
<i>The people on the beach,</i>

1355
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:08,880
their heads would turn and follow us,

1356
01:20:08,984 --> 01:20:12,545
not me of course, but they would
follow us walking along the beach.

1357
01:20:13,555 --> 01:20:18,788
Bettie: <i>We got married</i>
<i>on Valentine's Day 1967</i>

1358
01:20:18,894 --> 01:20:24,526
<i>with his three children</i>
<i>as witnesses to the wedding.</i>

1359
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:27,534
Harry: <i>I had a nice new home for Bettie</i>

1360
01:20:27,636 --> 01:20:32,664
<i>and the children,</i>
<i>everything was set up perfect, you know.</i>

1361
01:20:32,774 --> 01:20:35,572
<i>And then we had</i>
<i>an addition put on the house</i>

1362
01:20:35,677 --> 01:20:37,577
<i>with a cement roof on top,</i>

1363
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,615
<i>and then I had a three foot wall</i>
<i>around the top of it,</i>

1364
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:44,208
<i>she'd sunbathe in the nude</i>
<i>up there sometimes.</i>

1365
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,354
Bettie: <i>He was a hard worker.</i>

1366
01:20:47,456 --> 01:20:49,481
<i>Harry was a good provider, a good lover,</i>

1367
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:52,059
<i>now, he was one of the best lovers</i>
<i>I ever had in my life.</i>

1368
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:54,129
<i>And he was very considerate of me,</i>

1369
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:57,494
<i>always thinking</i>
<i>of my pleasure before his own.</i>

1370
01:20:57,599 --> 01:21:01,035
I'm not anymore,
but I was a very good lover,

1371
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:02,569
and she was a very good lover.

1372
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:05,504
<i>We enjoyed thrilling each other.</i>

1373
01:21:05,607 --> 01:21:09,703
<i>Oh, by the way,</i>
<i>that leopard skin robe, you know.</i>

1374
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:12,006
<i>She still had that.</i>

1375
01:21:12,114 --> 01:21:16,483
<i>And in the morning she'd put it on,</i>
<i>and in the evening she'd put it on.</i>

1376
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:19,918
<i>It just turned me wild when I saw her</i>
<i>walking around with that thing on.</i>

1377
01:21:20,022 --> 01:21:22,115
<i>( Mark laughing )</i>

1378
01:21:22,224 --> 01:21:26,183
Bettie: <i>Well, the children were</i>
<i>just as sweet and nice to me</i>

1379
01:21:26,295 --> 01:21:29,458
<i>during the months</i>
<i>that I dated Harry.</i>

1380
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:34,434
<i>But soon as I moved into the house,</i>
<i>everything changed.</i>

1381
01:21:34,536 --> 01:21:35,867
<i>His ex-wife,</i>

1382
01:21:35,971 --> 01:21:38,599
<i>she was so jealous of me</i>
<i>with the children,</i>

1383
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:42,108
<i>and she called me up at 4:00</i>
<i>in the morning and cussed me out.</i>

1384
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:45,476
<i>It was getting on my nerves,</i>
<i>I wasn't getting any sleep,</i>

1385
01:21:45,581 --> 01:21:47,173
<i>and I was very unhappy.</i>

1386
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:50,376
<i>So I stuck it out for five years.</i>

1387
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:52,544
<i>I started losing my love for Harry</i>

1388
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:54,713
<i>when he wouldn't make</i>
<i>those children mind me</i>

1389
01:21:54,823 --> 01:21:56,688
<i>or do anything I asked them to do.</i>

1390
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:02,252
Harry: <i>She wanted to start</i>
<i>going to church again.</i>

1391
01:22:02,364 --> 01:22:05,424
<i>And the whole family</i>
<i>went to church together.</i>

1392
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:10,801
<i>We went Sunday morning,</i>
<i>Sunday night, Wednesday evening.</i>

1393
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:15,843
<i>I mean, it got to be like sort of</i>
<i>a fanatic thing, you know.</i>

1394
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:17,206
I could see it in her eyes.

1395
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:20,406
We'd go to church
and she'd blast out singing,

1396
01:22:20,515 --> 01:22:24,246
<i>not boisterous or anything</i>
<i>but real loud voice singing.</i>

1397
01:22:24,353 --> 01:22:27,550
Tears came down her cheeks,

1398
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:29,886
and she'd get real emotional.

1399
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:32,654
<i>She was so obsessed</i>
<i>with things of the Lord.</i>

1400
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:35,457
Why should I stop her if...

1401
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:38,158
...if she wanted to go and serve God,

1402
01:22:38,267 --> 01:22:40,997
or the Lord, or be a missionary.

1403
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:49,041
Bettie: <i>I got divorced</i>
<i>on January 17, 1972,</i>

1404
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:50,941
<i>then I went to Bible Town,</i>

1405
01:22:51,046 --> 01:22:55,176
<i>which is 70 miles up</i>
<i>near Boca Raton, Florida.</i>

1406
01:22:55,284 --> 01:22:58,617
<i>While I was up there,</i>
<i>I started imagining</i>

1407
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,917
<i>that I was hearing somebody</i>
<i>talking to me on my tape recorder,</i>

1408
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:05,084
<i>and I thought I was really listening</i>

1409
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:08,185
<i>to God and the angels and the devil.</i>

1410
01:23:08,297 --> 01:23:10,925
<i>I lost a lot of weight then,</i>
<i>I wasn't eating</i>

1411
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:14,298
<i>because they were</i>
<i>keeping me awake talking all night.</i>

1412
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:20,998
<i>It had built up in my mind</i>
<i>so much that my mind snapped.</i>

1413
01:23:23,078 --> 01:23:26,741
Harry: <i>She had caused</i>
<i>some kind of a disturbance.</i>

1414
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,748
The police called me

1415
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:33,753
and asked me
if I could come up and pick her up.

1416
01:23:33,855 --> 01:23:37,723
<i>I put her out there in my,</i>
<i>I think it was my bedroom,</i>

1417
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:40,590
<i>and I slept</i>
<i>on the couch at the time.</i>

1418
01:23:40,696 --> 01:23:42,755
<i>I thought I owed it to her.</i>

1419
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:44,991
<i>What would happen</i>
<i>if I kicked her out?</i>

1420
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:50,037
<i>And the state of Florida</i>
<i>in no way is good to mental illness.</i>

1421
01:23:50,138 --> 01:23:53,733
And I tried to get her going in places

1422
01:23:53,842 --> 01:23:56,174
and they wouldn't bother with her.

1423
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:59,406
<i>She had lost it,</i>
<i>there's no doubt about it.</i>

1424
01:23:59,514 --> 01:24:02,608
Bettie called us into the living room,

1425
01:24:02,718 --> 01:24:05,482
<i>me and my son Larry and Brad,</i>

1426
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:10,547
<i>called us over</i>
<i>by this picture of Jesus Christ,</i>

1427
01:24:10,659 --> 01:24:12,991
with a knife in her hand.

1428
01:24:13,095 --> 01:24:15,063
She said, "If you take
your eyes off him,

1429
01:24:15,163 --> 01:24:17,927
<i>I'm going to cut your guts out. "</i>

1430
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:23,066
Whoa, you know, here I was.

1431
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:25,002
<i>I could read Bettie pretty good</i>

1432
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:30,238
<i>and I felt safe that</i>
<i>she wasn't going to do it right then.</i>

1433
01:24:30,345 --> 01:24:33,041
I said, "Bettie,
I've got to go to the bathroom,

1434
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:36,049
I've got to relieve myself real bad."

1435
01:24:36,151 --> 01:24:38,949
So I went back into the bedroom,

1436
01:24:39,054 --> 01:24:41,249
<i>picked up the phone,</i>

1437
01:24:41,356 --> 01:24:43,256
<i>called the Hialeah Police.</i>

1438
01:24:43,358 --> 01:24:45,656
<i>I let the cop in the front door.</i>

1439
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:48,355
<i>Bettie went peacefully,</i>

1440
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:50,590
<i>with a blank look on her face.</i>

1441
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:54,693
Bettie: <i>I ended up having</i>
<i>a nervous breakdown and hearing voices,</i>

1442
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:57,829
<i>and had to go</i>
<i>to the hospital because of it.</i>

1443
01:24:57,939 --> 01:25:00,669
<i>They took me</i>
<i>to Jackson Memorial Hospital.</i>

1444
01:25:00,776 --> 01:25:04,143
<i>They have on the fifth floor</i>
<i>a psychiatric ward.</i>

1445
01:25:04,246 --> 01:25:07,079
<i>I was just there two months.</i>

1446
01:25:07,182 --> 01:25:10,743
<i>They gave me this horrible thorazine.</i>

1447
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:15,346
<i>I felt like I had sparks</i>
<i>and things going in my head,</i>

1448
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:17,721
<i>and you feel like</i>
<i>you're going to die right after,</i>

1449
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:20,192
<i>for an hour or two</i>
<i>after you take the thorazine.</i>

1450
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:25,930
<i>But it knocked the voices</i>
<i>right out of me though.</i>

1451
01:25:26,034 --> 01:25:29,970
Harry: <i>She was completely</i>
<i>medicated all the time.</i>

1452
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:33,506
Mark: <i>Now, when she was</i>
<i>getting treatment,</i>

1453
01:25:33,608 --> 01:25:35,701
<i>do you know if they gave her</i>
<i>any shock treatment?</i>

1454
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:39,304
Harry: <i>I think she had two.</i>

1455
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:48,283
<i>Jimmy, one time he came up to the house</i>
<i>after Bettie was with me awhile.</i>

1456
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:52,092
He said, "I'm gonna take Bettie
back to California with me,

1457
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:54,321
we're gonna get a place,
we're gonna live together,

1458
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:56,693
we're gonna get a house or something."

1459
01:25:56,798 --> 01:26:00,063
<i>California, it's a very liberal state,</i>

1460
01:26:00,168 --> 01:26:03,626
<i>and their mental facilities</i>
<i>are the best in the world.</i>

1461
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,798
Bettie: <i>Jimmy and I were close</i>
<i>when we were growing up.</i>

1462
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,810
<i>I didn't have any money hardly.</i>

1463
01:26:10,912 --> 01:26:13,380
<i>I had just enough</i>
<i>to get to California at the time.</i>

1464
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:18,881
Jimmy was supposed
to meet her in California,

1465
01:26:18,987 --> 01:26:21,512
didn't show up.

1466
01:26:21,623 --> 01:26:23,921
<i>That's why she got in trouble.</i>

1467
01:26:27,829 --> 01:26:31,765
Richard W. Bann: <i>She was trying to get</i>
<i>rent receipts from her landlord.</i>

1468
01:26:31,867 --> 01:26:34,335
<i>She was hearing voices,</i>

1469
01:26:34,436 --> 01:26:37,234
<i>I guess telling her to do</i>
<i>some pretty awful things.</i>

1470
01:26:37,339 --> 01:26:41,002
<i>And she thought</i>
<i>it was the devil speaking to her.</i>

1471
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:42,440
<i>And she did tell me,</i>

1472
01:26:42,544 --> 01:26:46,310
"I had a knife
and I was upset with my landlady,

1473
01:26:46,414 --> 01:26:49,008
and I wrestled her
to the ground and I straddled her,

1474
01:26:49,117 --> 01:26:51,847
and I told her that I was
going to cut her up."

1475
01:26:51,953 --> 01:26:53,750
The lady did not die.

1476
01:26:53,855 --> 01:26:57,814
<i>The lady got cut</i>
<i>pretty severally on her hand.</i>

1477
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:01,054
Bleeding, blood everywhere.

1478
01:27:01,162 --> 01:27:03,096
Obvious that the lady needed stitches.

1479
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:07,134
<i>She was stabbed like 20 or 30 times.</i>

1480
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:12,434
<i>She pleaded insanity to this charge</i>
<i>of "attempt to commit murder"</i>

1481
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:15,908
<i>and this assault</i>
<i>so they then put her away for ten years.</i>

1482
01:27:20,615 --> 01:27:24,073
Bettie: <i>You talked</i>
<i>to the psychiatrist, I think it was,</i>

1483
01:27:24,185 --> 01:27:26,983
<i>three times a week for half an hour.</i>

1484
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:31,923
<i>And you went to groups,</i>
<i>mostly group therapy as they call it.</i>

1485
01:27:32,027 --> 01:27:34,018
<i>You just talked about why</i>

1486
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:36,097
<i>or what caused you</i>
<i>to have your breakdown,</i>

1487
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:39,655
<i>and I was put on something</i>
<i>called Novane and Artane.</i>

1488
01:27:39,768 --> 01:27:43,465
She had never hinted
about any of the trouble with the law,

1489
01:27:43,572 --> 01:27:46,598
any of the mental
institution years, any of that.

1490
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,734
Bettie: <i>I didn't think it was something</i>
<i>anybody would want to hear about.</i>

1491
01:27:49,844 --> 01:27:52,108
<i>And it was not anybody's business.</i>

1492
01:27:53,315 --> 01:27:56,341
<i>A lot of people still look down on you</i>
<i>if you've had a nervous breakdown.</i>

1493
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:59,943
<i>They still thinking like they did</i>
<i>a hundred years ago about it.</i>

1494
01:28:02,357 --> 01:28:04,382
Bann: <i>Bettie's the one</i>
<i>that paid the price,</i>

1495
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:07,655
<i>spending 9 or 10 years at Patton State</i>

1496
01:28:07,762 --> 01:28:10,230
<i>in a horrible, horrible situation.</i>

1497
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:16,194
I learned that she was
paranoid schizophrenic.

1498
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:19,364
That's an enormous cross to bare.

1499
01:28:19,474 --> 01:28:23,672
And whereas she had her parents

1500
01:28:23,778 --> 01:28:27,407
<i>to thank for her amazing good looks,</i>

1501
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:28,743
<i>it was a mixed blessing</i>

1502
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:31,876
because her parents
were also responsible

1503
01:28:31,987 --> 01:28:36,083
for this genetic predisposition

1504
01:28:36,191 --> 01:28:39,627
towards paranoid schizophrenia,

1505
01:28:39,728 --> 01:28:43,357
<i>plus her mother didn't want her,</i>

1506
01:28:43,465 --> 01:28:47,196
<i>and her father molested her.</i>

1507
01:28:47,302 --> 01:28:51,363
Those are heavy burdens to deal with.

1508
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:58,377
<i>She was probably</i>
<i>one of the most strong willed people</i>

1509
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,811
<i>anyone's ever going to meet.</i>

1510
01:28:59,914 --> 01:29:02,940
And she'd admit
that she had fallen down

1511
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:05,611
but she was going to renew,

1512
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,450
with great enthusiasm and optimism

1513
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:10,547
<i>that this time she would get it right.</i>

1514
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:15,392
I told her that anytime
there's anything she needs,

1515
01:29:15,497 --> 01:29:17,431
that there are thousands of people

1516
01:29:17,532 --> 01:29:20,399
who would just do anything for her
if they had the chance.

1517
01:29:20,502 --> 01:29:24,734
<i>The one who really did</i>
<i>the most for her was Dave Stevens,</i>

1518
01:29:24,839 --> 01:29:27,364
<i>to the point of</i>
<i>she would call him to go out</i>

1519
01:29:27,475 --> 01:29:30,501
<i>and bring her food</i>
<i>or take her to the doctor.</i>

1520
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:33,046
Stevens: <i>I took her into Tower Records</i>

1521
01:29:33,148 --> 01:29:36,140
<i>and I steered her around</i>
<i>to the book section,</i>

1522
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:39,345
<i>and there on an end cap</i>
<i>of an aisle of books</i>

1523
01:29:39,454 --> 01:29:42,685
<i>was a display</i>
<i>of nothing but Bettie Page books,</i>

1524
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:45,760
<i>and she just stood there</i>
<i>in amazement.</i>

1525
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:48,260
<i>She gets so tickled</i>
<i>when she sees some new book</i>

1526
01:29:48,363 --> 01:29:52,800
with her picture on it
or some... whatever product it is,

1527
01:29:52,901 --> 01:29:55,369
even if she's
not getting any money for it.

1528
01:29:55,470 --> 01:30:00,464
Bann: <i>Dave knew that Bettie</i>
<i>had been Miss January 1955,</i>

1529
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:03,237
<i>and he knew that Hef</i>
<i>had never met Bettie Page</i>

1530
01:30:03,344 --> 01:30:05,574
<i>and suggested that they meet.</i>

1531
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,911
Bettie: <i>And he invited me</i>
<i>to dinner at his home,</i>

1532
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:11,451
<i>the most beautiful home</i>
<i>I've ever been in in my life.</i>

1533
01:30:11,553 --> 01:30:14,545
<i>Looks like a big castle</i>
<i>up in Beverly Hills.</i>

1534
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,886
So usually at the Playboy Mansion,

1535
01:30:16,991 --> 01:30:19,391
everyone has cameras,
everything is being recorded.

1536
01:30:19,494 --> 01:30:22,361
But on this night,
because of Bettie being so private,

1537
01:30:22,464 --> 01:30:24,898
so discreet, no cameras.

1538
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,331
Bettie: <i>I liked Mr. Hefner.</i>

1539
01:30:27,435 --> 01:30:29,767
<i>He was a very nice,</i>
<i>down to earth fella.</i>

1540
01:30:29,871 --> 01:30:32,931
<i>And he greeted us,</i>
<i>Dave Stevens and I,</i>

1541
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:36,670
<i>in his pajamas,</i>
<i>now, a smoking jacket</i>

1542
01:30:36,778 --> 01:30:41,044
<i>and his purple, satin pajamas.</i>

1543
01:30:41,149 --> 01:30:44,949
And Hef had arranged for a loan
of a 35mm print of "The Rocketeer",

1544
01:30:45,053 --> 01:30:49,319
which was Dave Stevens'
creation, from Disney.

1545
01:30:49,424 --> 01:30:51,619
And Bettie had never seen the film.

1546
01:30:51,726 --> 01:30:54,752
She wanted to see this film
that was an homage

1547
01:30:54,863 --> 01:30:56,262
to her, inspired by her.

1548
01:30:56,464 --> 01:30:59,433
♪ <i>You're a sweet little headache</i> ♪

1549
01:30:59,534 --> 01:31:03,095
♪ <i>But you are lots of fun</i> ♪

1550
01:31:03,204 --> 01:31:05,297
♪ <i>I've a good mind to spank you...</i> ♪

1551
01:31:05,406 --> 01:31:07,203
There was an unauthorized film

1552
01:31:07,308 --> 01:31:12,905
made in 2005 called
"The Notorious Bettie Page".

1553
01:31:13,014 --> 01:31:14,311
This is quite an elegant knot,

1554
01:31:14,415 --> 01:31:17,350
because the more the subject pulls
the tighter the knot becomes.

1555
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:23,021
She didn't like the word
"Notorious" in the title.

1556
01:31:23,124 --> 01:31:25,922
And do you approve?

1557
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:27,892
I believe in Jesus.

1558
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:31,630
Well, of course you do, my dear.

1559
01:31:35,937 --> 01:31:37,871
Of course you do.

1560
01:31:39,874 --> 01:31:41,603
Bann: <i>But all of a sudden,</i>
<i>here's what you heard</i>

1561
01:31:41,709 --> 01:31:43,677
from the back
of the screening room.

1562
01:31:43,778 --> 01:31:47,544
"Lies, lies, lies!

1563
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:51,312
L-I-E-S, lies!

1564
01:31:51,419 --> 01:31:54,582
Why don't you tell the truth?"

1565
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:57,080
( woman gasps )

1566
01:31:57,192 --> 01:31:59,786
Hefner: <i>When she resurfaced</i>
<i>here in California,</i>

1567
01:31:59,894 --> 01:32:03,625
<i>she was not being</i>
<i>properly represented by anybody,</i>

1568
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:07,428
and a lot of people were exploiting her
and taking advantage of her.

1569
01:32:07,535 --> 01:32:13,337
And I was able to put her in the hands
of more appropriate business people,

1570
01:32:13,441 --> 01:32:15,102
legal people,

1571
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:17,235
so that she had
the right kind of representation

1572
01:32:17,345 --> 01:32:20,041
and somebody to look after her
and take care of her.

1573
01:32:20,148 --> 01:32:22,309
And we've been very close ever since.

1574
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:25,818
And I had a call
from Mr. Hefner, who asked me

1575
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,615
if I would help out a friend of his

1576
01:32:27,722 --> 01:32:30,418
<i>and try to see</i>
<i>that anything that was done</i>

1577
01:32:30,525 --> 01:32:32,049
<i>with Bettie's name and likeness</i>

1578
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,458
<i>ultimately had her approval on it</i>

1579
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:38,225
<i>and of course she would receive</i>
<i>some type of compensation for it.</i>

1580
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:40,801
Bettie: <i>I made more money</i>
<i>in very recent years</i>

1581
01:32:40,902 --> 01:32:44,702
<i>than I ever made during the seven years</i>
<i>I was modeling back in the '50s.</i>

1582
01:32:44,806 --> 01:32:47,866
Bettie was able to enjoy life more

1583
01:32:47,976 --> 01:32:51,605
because of what she could do
in the later part of her life.

1584
01:32:51,713 --> 01:32:53,408
( people chattering )

1585
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,445
I think she had an incredible charm.

1586
01:33:01,556 --> 01:33:04,650
She had an incredible aura,
or how you say it, charisma.

1587
01:33:04,759 --> 01:33:07,694
And I think a lot of models
learned from her.

1588
01:33:07,795 --> 01:33:10,195
There's nothing
intimidating about Bettie.

1589
01:33:10,298 --> 01:33:12,232
Women can appreciate her,
men can appreciate her.

1590
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,860
Most of them, you don't
really remember the the person,

1591
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:18,905
<i>but her, you know, you say,</i>
<i>"Oh yeah, that's Bettie Page. "</i>

1592
01:33:19,007 --> 01:33:21,737
She's also has had
the keen sense of timing

1593
01:33:21,843 --> 01:33:25,176
to know exactly when
not to appear, which is hard.

1594
01:33:26,381 --> 01:33:27,439
Man #1 : Go ahead, Bettie.

1595
01:33:27,548 --> 01:33:29,573
Bettie: <i>Hello every one of you.</i>

1596
01:33:29,684 --> 01:33:32,915
- <i>( crowd oohs )</i>
- Hi, Bettie.

1597
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:34,545
Bettie: <i>Thank you very much.</i>

1598
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:36,920
<i>Gee, sounds like a big mob.</i>

1599
01:33:37,025 --> 01:33:38,322
Man #1 : <i>It is a big mob.</i>

1600
01:33:38,426 --> 01:33:42,192
Man #2: <i>Bettie, you have thrown the</i>
<i>coolest opening in SoHo that I've seen.</i>

1601
01:33:42,297 --> 01:33:45,994
Bettie: <i>I hope you like my book,</i>
<i>I'm very pleased with it.</i>

1602
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:50,196

( cheering and applause )

1605
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,243
When I realized it was really big

1606
01:34:01,349 --> 01:34:06,616
is when I got the first Bettie Scouts
of America fan letter from China.

1607
01:34:06,721 --> 01:34:09,349
<i>I mean, it's literally</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

1608
01:34:09,457 --> 01:34:11,516
New Zealand, Australia, all over Europe.

1609
01:34:11,626 --> 01:34:14,220

1612

Chantal Thomass: <i>Always I had been</i>
<i>inspired by Bettie Page,</i>

1613
01:34:26,641 --> 01:34:30,941
and then the pinups
from the '50s and Bettie is the one,

1614
01:34:31,045 --> 01:34:33,343
the most extreme and most special one.

1615
01:34:33,448 --> 01:34:35,473
Chantal Thomass (in French):
<i>Bettie Page was way ahead of her time...</i>

1616
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:56,064
<i>She influenced</i>
<i>[Theiry Mugler, Gauliter].</i>

1617
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:58,001
<i>I mean, she did it with humor,</i>

1618
01:34:58,106 --> 01:35:00,939
<i>and I'll always work</i>
<i>on my design in lingerie with humor.</i>

1619
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:02,566
<i>I mean, it has to be sexy,</i>

1620
01:35:02,677 --> 01:35:05,475
<i>but it must have</i>
<i>a small part of humor.</i>

1621
01:35:06,914 --> 01:35:10,042
<i>Bettie Page can be</i>
<i>an example for women</i>

1622

The Bettie Page they love is very real.

1645
01:36:27,228 --> 01:36:32,222
In other words, I think that
she had this kind of amoral attitude

1646
01:36:32,333 --> 01:36:36,667
<i>towards sexuality and nudity,</i>
<i>and even, you know, the bondage things.</i>

1647
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:42,175
She did not disgrace those
who looked more sternly

1648
01:36:42,276 --> 01:36:46,337
upon portraits of sexuality.

1649
01:36:46,447 --> 01:36:51,282
I think she handled
her phases of life with dignity.

1650
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:57,084
The suggestion back then
that sex was simply a natural,

1651
01:36:57,191 --> 01:37:01,525
normal part of life
was very revolutionary,

1652
01:37:01,629 --> 01:37:08,296
and helped to change
the values of our time.
