My name is Turkish.

a famous 19th century ballet dancer.

remember. He's my partner.

MUTTI: Listen to this. Are you
busy? I'll tell you the whole story.

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,264
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"

35
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,683
into the Greek word
for "virgin. "

36
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:28,352
It was an easy mistake
to make

37
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:33,148
because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.

38
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:45,327
So, they came up
with a prophecy:

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,748
"Behold, the virgin shall
conceive and bear us a son. "

40
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:54,128
You understand this? It was the word
"virgin" that caught people's attention.

41
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:58,507
It's not every day a virgin
conceives and bears a son.
