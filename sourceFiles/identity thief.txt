00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,739
(SIREN WAILS)

350
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,449
(SIGHING)

351
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,325
- Damn it.
- WOMAN: <i>Excuse me?</i>

352
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,494
- Unbelievable. I gotta call you back.
- (SIREN WAILS)

353
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,662
- TRAFFIC COP: <i>Driver.</i>
- Sorry!

354
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,040
<i>Pull the vehicle to the side of the road.</i>

355
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,545
FEMALE DISPATCHER:<i>
NCIC says 10-29F, use caution.</i>

356
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,346
Step out of the vehicle, Mr. Patterson.

357
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,058
Okay, coming out of the vehicle
for hands-free?

358
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,060
That seems just a little bit excessive.

359
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,186
Mr. Patterson, you're under arrest.

360
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,228
Under arrest?

361
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,480
You have the right to remain silent.

362
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,564
Hey, wait a second.

363
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,068
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

364
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,529
REILLY: The arresting officer
ran your license through the NCIC.

365
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,407
You were booked for felony assault
two weeks ago in Florida.

366
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,077
What? No, I wasn't.
What are you talking about?

367
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,204
- I've never even been to Florida.
- You've never been to Florida?

368
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,581
No, sir. This whole morning...

369
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,251
Well, hang on a second.
Was it Winter Park, Florida?

370
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,336
See, that's good.

371
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,046
We're dropping the whole
"there's been a mistake" thing.

372
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,589
I got it now. Listen...

373
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,216
The problem is, Mr. Patterson,

374
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,010
is that you missed your court date
three days ago in Florida.

375
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,178
Officer, let me just explain.

376
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,306
And the judge has
issued a warrant for your arrest.

377
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,100
- Yeah...
- So what we're gonna do

378
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,935
is we're gonna go ahead
and ship you back down to Florida.

379
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,061
You can work on your tan.

380
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,145
Sir. Yeah, listen. You're not listening.

381
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,271
- Sit down.
- Sorry.

382
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,940
There's a person that has my same name

383
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,483
that is doing things in Florida.

384
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,612
This guy is making salon appointments,
he's buying beach equipment.

385
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,322
He's maxing out my credit card.

386
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:38,410
Are you Sandy Bigelow Patterson,
born May 18th, 1974?

387
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,494
That is you, correct?

388
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,121
Yeah, but it's not me doing this stuff.

389
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,623
I've never even been to the state.
I'm here with you guys.

390
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,001
I'm in Colorado. How can I be in Florida?

391
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,463
Call Winter Park PD. Pull the mug shot.

392
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,301
Okay, uncuff him.

393
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,138
Uncuff me. That's great.

394
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,973
Can I see?

395
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,475
Whoa.

396
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,102
Is that a woman?

397
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,938
If I had to guess,
it's the woman that stole your identity,

398
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:10,025
obviously taking advantage
of the fact that you have a female name.

399
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,860
Oh, it's not female, it's unisex.

400
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,654
When you say "stole my identity,"
do you mean credit card fraud?

401
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,031
Oh, no, no, it's a lot worse than that.

402
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,657
What happens is,
they get a hold of your name,

403
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,867
your birthday, Social Security.

404
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,577
And then they run up debt,

405
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,245
get arrested, commit crimes as you.

406
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,872
What do you do now?
You go down, you go get her?

407
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,167
Oh, no, we don't go get anyone.
Let me walk you out.

408
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,628
See, we're Denver PD.
All we do is open and close the case.

409
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,630
Now, if she buys something on Amazon,

410
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,507
then Seattle PD would investigate.

411
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,510
Your mobile company's in Ohio,
then Cleveland PD handles that.

412
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,346
Then so on and so forth
for every single theft.

413
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,556
Well, hang on. How long does all this take?

414
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,516
About six months to a year.

415
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,642
A year?

416
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,852
Yeah. So why don't you go ahead

417
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,937
and just leave your contact information
with this gentleman here?

418
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,148
You might want to hold on to this mug shot
in case you may need it.

419
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,232
SANDY: Great. Okay.

420
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,859
Listen, I'm gonna need this solved

421
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,361
a whole lot quicker than a year, Detective.

422
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,030
Okay, listen, I understand
that this is really frustrating for you,

423
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,449
but our percentage rate
in solving these cases is pretty high.

424
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,575
Yeah? How many?

425
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,868
About 5% to 10%.

426
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,037
That's garbage.

427
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,247
We'll be in touch with you, Sandy.

428
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,972
- Hi, I'm Sandy...
- Mr. Patterson.

429
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:26,017
- I know who you are. I'm Jessica.
- Hi.

430
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,102
Welcome.

431
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,479
Anything you need, just ask.

432
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,897
Your office is right over there.

433
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,149
Office. Nice to meet you.

434
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,368
- Patterson?
- Sorry.

435
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,246
I had a hell of a morning.

436
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,497
- Listen to this.
- Can you explain this to me?

437
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,581
What do you got?

438
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,668
These are e-mails I received
from a couple of prospective clients.

439
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:52,877
No, no, no.

440
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,713
You defaulted on six credit cards?

441
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,756
- No, I didn't, actually.
- You did.

442
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:57,966
- No.
- You have nine other delinquencies.

443
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,259
This is what my morning's been all about.

444
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,720
- Your credit score's a 240. A 240!
- (SIGHING)

445
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,597
There are homeless people
with better numbers than that, Sandy.

446
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,766
Dude, you have a warrant
out for your arrest.

447
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,393
This is a financial institution.

448
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,604
How am I supposed to give you access
to $5 billion in funds?

449
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,106
My identity's been stolen.

450
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,941
I was at the police station all morning.

451
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,359
Don't worry about it, though.

452
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,819
I'm gonna get on the phone,
I'm going to clean it up.

453
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,113
They can run my credit tomorrow
and it's gonna be fine, okay?

454
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,448
What the fuck is this?

455
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,284
- Those are cops!
- That's my guy.

456
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,244
This is the detective
that's handling my case.

457
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,497
Hi. I was just
filling my boss in on our situation.

458
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,750
Did you find her?
Do you have some good news?

459
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,960
No, I'm sorry,
we don't have any good news.

460
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,504
Soon after you left,
we got a call from Orlando Metro.

461
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,758
They just busted a narcotics dealer
named Paolo Gordon.

462
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,594
Your name and your credit cards
turned up in connection

463
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,970
with the investigation.

464
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,305
Ah! This... (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

465
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,684
One of my colleagues spoke
to your former employer, Mr. Harold Cornish.

466
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,769
Yeah.

467
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,271
And he said that, in fact,
you are a drug dealer.

468
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,647
(CHUCKLING)

469
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,567
That's... He's a fucking liar.

470
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,320
I've got a warrant to search the premises.

471
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,072
- For drugs.
- Oh.

472
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,656
And guns.

473
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,367
And guns.

474
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,826
- This is a waste of time.
- I understand.

475
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,496
It's not me, it's the woman in the picture.

476
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,289
- Just doing my job.
- I need to put that out.

477
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,874
Okay.

478
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,001
(SIGHING) Okay, guys, let's...

479
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,174
Okay, we're done.

480
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,884
You can let your employees back in now.

481
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,010
Thank you.

482
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,012
- So, no Oxy?
- No, no Oxy.

483
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,180
Did you find my weapons?

484
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,599
I'm not an idiot, Mr. Patterson, okay?

485
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,393
I know almost certainly
it's the woman in Florida.

486
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,644
Yeah.

487
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,729
But until we know for sure
that you didn't do this,

488
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:35,980
it's an open investigation.

489
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,524
For narcotics.

490
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,362
Let me walk you out.

491
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,866
We're gonna have to
talk about our options.

492
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,494
I think we got to let you go.

493
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,300
I know where she is. Hey!

494
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,429
I know exactly where she's gonna be
tomorrow afternoon.

495
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,597
If I tell you, you can tell
the Winter Park Police Department,

496
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:11,850
they can grab her, and we're done.

497
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,019
- No, no, it doesn't work like that.
- Why not?

498
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,354
Well, they'd have to
bring her up on local charges first.

499
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,732
And it would pretty much
be about a year before we get a shot at her.

500
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,901
I mean, she'd have to be
standing right here to do you any good.

501
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,029
That's the new standard of police work?

502
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,322
The criminal's got
to be standing right in front of you?

503
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,116
- Have a good day.
- Hang on, hang on.

504
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,410
If they won't bring her here,
what if I bring her here?

505
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,661
What if, somehow, I get her here,

506
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,746
and I put her right in front of you,

507
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,081
she gives you a full statement
and owns up to everything?

508
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,916
Then we'd be done, wouldn't we?

509
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,585
Oh, I wouldn't recommend
that, Mr. Patterson.

510
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,295
You see, criminals generally just don't

511
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,880
volunteer confessions to policemen.

512
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,299
All right, what about this?

513
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,760
What about if I ask her to talk to you?

514
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,929
Because she cost me my job
and I want to get my job back,

515
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,640
and in return, I don't press any charges.

516
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:55,268
She doesn't have to worry about me.
There's no cops.

517
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,478
But there are cops.

518
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,730
You're down the hall,
you're listening to a thing. I'm wearing...

519
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,273
(CHUCKLING) What? That's ridiculous.

520
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,608
No, no, no, this sort of thing

521
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:02,901
- tends to work pretty well.
- Right?

522
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,486
And we do have enough
for an eavesdrop warrant.

523
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,946
No, no. Sandy, I need somebody
here doing the work right now.

524
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,240
I'm the best at what I do.
Those are your words.

525
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,617
I'm just looking for a little bit of time.

526
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,244
We don't have time.
I'm supposed to put everything on hold?

527
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,287
We have clients!

528
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,748
Listen, I gave up everything because
I believe in you. Just believe in me.

529
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,459
Come on, you know me. Come on, Daniel.

530
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,090
- I'll give you one week.
- Really?

531
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,132
But that's it.

532
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,635
That's all I need. Thank you.

533
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,845
One week, Patterson!

534
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,431
I'm calling to confirm
my wife's appointment for tomorrow at 3:00.

535
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,684
Thank you. She ended up
making the appointment.

536
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,603
I didn't realize that
she's gonna be in the area.

537
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,357
Anyway, I need your address
because she lost it.

538
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,610
Okay. Got it. Thank you.

539
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,779
She'll see you tomorrow at 3:00. Bye-bye.

540
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,658
Okay. I've got cash for the plane ticket,
I've got my sock money.

541
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,660
- Did you call the cab?
- Don't do this.

542
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,663
Don't start this again.
Trish, I need you to just hang in there.

543
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,331
This is not who we are.

544
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,916
- You're not Batman.
- Do not unpack this.

545
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,668
Please, I can't refold all this stuff.

546
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,503
- Do you even know how to use those?
- It's just in case.

547
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,672
It is my only option.

548
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,883
It is our only option.

549
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,511
Let me see the picture of her again.

550
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,851
Make you feel better to see that?

551
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:18,935
Uh-huh.

552
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,312
Yeah. She's not dangerous.

553
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,565
That number right there is her height.

554
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,901
It's hobbit height.

555
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,195
I'm going after Bilbo.

556
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,323
Yeah, I can do this, I really can.

557
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,159
But I can't do it without your support.

558
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,203
Okay? Please trust me.

559
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,414
Thank you.

560
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,542
If all goes well,
I'll be right back here tomorrow night.

561
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,919
Also, I borrowed your anxiety pills

562
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,546
because I might have to
coax her onto the airplane.

563
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,214
Oh, good. Okay, that's fine

564
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,716
'cause why would I need those right now?

565
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,886
I'll call you when I land, okay?

566
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,137
Goodbye, you guys.

567
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,181
Daddy, the TV's broken.

568
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,559
Oh. Well, you know. Come here.

569
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:03,229
Some things are broken,
but only for a few days.

570
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,731
That's why I have to go on this trip

571
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,232
to pretty much the worst place in America.

572
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,068
But Daddy's gonna fix these problems.

573
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,362
When I get back, it's all gonna be perfect.

574
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,697
I promise, okay? Come here.

575
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,699
It's too late for TV anyway,
you guys are going to bed.

576
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:18,578
Do some drawing, and then PJs. Goodbye.

577
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,415
Go get this bitch.

578
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,125
Roger.

579
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,876
Ooh!

580
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:19,848
Okay.

582
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,072

585
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,001
Oh, jeez.

586
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,252
You got an injury.

587
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,421
- Oh, my neck. My neck got it.
- Sorry about that.

588
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,381
I didn't assume
you were gonna come to a full stop

589
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:54,591
in the middle of the highway.

590
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,677
Oh, a mama badger
and a baby crossing the road.

591
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,763
A badger, huh?

592
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,222
Yeah. Oh, my God.

593
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:05,018
My fibromyalgia's
just shooting down my spine.

594
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,895
Jeez Louise.

595
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:11,107
No, this is totally my fault.
You got your license on you?

596
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,734
Why don't we swap information?

597
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,694
We can get
the insurance companies involved.

598
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,114
I guess that's what it comes to.

599
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:22,035
I hate to tell you,
but that's a custom paint job. Thank you.

600
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,872
You know, if it's okay with you,

601
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,542
I'm okay and I'm cool with just doing cash.

602
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:34,381
Yeah, cash would be a lot easier,
wouldn't it, Sandy Bigelow Patterson?

603
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,465
Yeah.

604
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,050
Bigelow is such a rare name.

605
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,052
Well, it's a family name, you know.

606
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,054
It goes back to the <i>Mayflower.</i>

607
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,263
Is that right?

608
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,765
Yeah. Jeremiah Bigelow.

609
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:47,143
Maybe you've heard of him.
Pretty prominent bear hunter.

610
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,937
- Sounds brave.
- Kind of a big deal.

00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,229
Open the fucking door!

692
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,272
Shit!

693
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:02,440
Who's that?

694
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:05,026
Just changing my clothes. I'll be right out!

695
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:08,863
MARISOL: Don't lie to me.
Those credit cards you sold Paolo were shit.

696
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,740
No, no, no, it's a misunderstanding.

697
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,743

when I explain it to you guys.

699
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:16,788

700
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,331

SANDY: You just make friends
wherever you go, huh?

707
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:51,156
- Who were those people?
- Don't worry about it.

708
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,908

Is that a bobby pin?

709

711

Yeah, we'll see about that.

712
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,789
How about you just apologize
for getting me shot at?

713
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:01,041
I'm not gonna apologize for that

714
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:05,170
because you should not
have broken into my home.

715
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,839
So, it's a little lesson for you, Sandy.

716
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,382
- Pull over.
- I'm not pulling over.

717
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,092
We're going to an airport

718
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,428
and we're taking
the first flight to Denver, Diana.

719
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,889
Why don't you pull over
before I kick your ass again?

720
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,432
As soon as I explain it,
you're gonna come with me. All right?

721
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,435
I'll tell you what, why don't we find a bar,
we calm down a little bit...

722
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:22,937
I buy you a drink, I talk, you listen?
Does that sound fair?

723
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,898
That sounds fair, Sandy.

724
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,441
You'll behave yourself if we find a bar?

725
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:27,859
- Oh, totally.
- Great.

726
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,027
Yeah, I'll behave myself

727
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,945
because you will have probably dosed me

728
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,822

729
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,115
Hey, when did you get those?

730
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,451
I had two hands down your pants,
and you didn't notice,

731
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,453
so you should deal with that.

732
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,913
Fucking dead below the waist.

733
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,039
You're disgusting.

734
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,624
Just pull the car over.

735
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:43,750
- Is that what you want?
- Yes.

736
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,293

737
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,797

Right in the middle of the highway.

Yeah, right in the middle of the highway.

Really?

740
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:55,220
All right. I'll tell you what, then.
I'll just call the police

741
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,930
and I'll tell them that there's a criminal

742
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,598
out here with a known warrant

743
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,183

744
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,102
I got a lot of evidence they'd like to see.

745
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,521
You got nothing.

746
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,233
Hey! I'm calling the police right now.

747

Good luck, pal. I'll be long gone.

Listen, I just need you to talk to my boss.

That's it. And I won't press charges, okay?

752
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,290
I'm losing my job because of you.

753
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:25,500
- Your job?
- That's right.

754
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,710
I didn't fire you.

755
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,753
- Effectively, you did.
- I don't think I did.

756
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,172
And I don't wanna go to Colorado
and meet your anxious wife.

757
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,799
You're right, she is anxious.
She's very anxious.

758
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,009
You wanna know why?

759
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,469
Because we have two daughters
and a third on the way.

760
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:37,887
We live in a very, very small apartment,

761
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,306
about half the size
of that house I bet you stole.

762
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:41,683
Hey, I worked hard for that house.

763
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:46,312
I'm proud of it.
I have a seven-year amorticized sub-rate...

764
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,439
It's amortized.

765
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,608
Well, I can't get into that.
You're not gonna get it.

It's on me, all right?

talk to my boss, that's it.

That's all. It's very simple.

You want to show me
where that appointment book is?

865
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:55,789
There you go.

866
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,220
Oh, jeez.

867
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,318
I really do appreciate your help.

868
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:30,615
Go on. Take it.

869
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,119
Now, how about a smile?

870
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,123
Look at you light up a room.

871
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,667
I'm gonna have a hard time
forgetting that face.

872
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,254
You go on and forget about this one.

873
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:55,181
SANDY: Yeah, not what I was planning,

874
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:58,351
but I will be home
on Sunday or Monday by the latest.

875
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,021
It is what it is, I guess.
How are the girls?

876
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,355
(CHUCKLING)

877
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:04,024
Okay. I love you, too.

878
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,776
I'll call you later. Bye.

879
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:11,740
How long have you guys been together?

880
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,451
I'm not going to talk about myself.

881
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:18,455
Or my family. You're never going
to know anything about me.

882
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,458
There's nothing wrong
with being a simple guy.

883
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:22,876
I'm just a simple gal.

884
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:27,047
From Wisconsin.
You know? I'm a cheesehead.

885
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:28,214
Fascinating.

886
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:29,341
I'm from Morganville.

887
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:32,052
It's a little, tiny town, but charming.

888
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:33,261
I don't care.

889
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:35,722
Mom's 70. Still working.

890
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:38,433
- Dad retired about, I guess, two and a...
- (SIGHING)

891
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,727
I want to say two and a half years.
Two, two and a half...

892
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:42,771
- Jesus Christ.
- Two and a half years ago.

893
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:44,939
He was a principal at a middle school.

894
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:46,232
They sound so normal.

895
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,401
How'd they have
a criminal asshole for a daughter

896
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:49,903
who just goes around
wrecking people's lives?

897
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:51,112
How'd that work out?

898
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:55,909
I think you're painting it with
the most negative brush possible.

899
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:59,454
I bet that they would paint it
the same exact way.

900
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,873
- I mean, what you do is...
- I use the system.

901
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,085
- I use the system that's provided...
- You cheat the system.

902
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,128
Now, the fact that I...
No, I do not cheat the system.

903
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,339
I use the system. If there's a loophole,

904
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:10,757
and I go through the loophole,

905
00:43:10,882 --> 00:43:12,384
I'm not doing anything wrong.

906
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,427
You create a lot of destruction.

907
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:17,389
You know, it's not my fault
if people don't check their own finances.

908
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:20,308
All you do is make one call
to the credit card company,

909
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,644
they take the charge off.
It's a victimless crime...

910
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:23,728
You don't take any accountability for this?

911
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,689
It's not a victimless... I'm a victim!

912
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:29,234
We're kind of in the midst
of a pivotal moment here, you know?

913
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:30,443
This is...

914
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:33,780
I think we might want to take stock of this.

915
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:37,033
We're kind of bonding.

916
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,578
It's kind of like family,
or brother and sister,

917
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,832
if brother and sister were

918
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,793
pretty attracted to each other.

919
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:50,046
We are just driving to Denver.
There will be nothing else.

920
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:52,173
I just thought,

921
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:54,426
in the spirit of honesty, I'd put out there

922
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:55,969
that I visually enjoy you.

923
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:57,595
Hmm.

924
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:02,517
And I've always, you know,
really liked tall men.

925
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:06,813
What are you talking... I'm average height.

926
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:08,148
Not to me, stretch.

927
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:10,316
- Great.
- (GASPING)

928
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,986
Look at that. See that? "Adventure."

929
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:14,821
I love that.

930
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,072
When are we going to pull over?

931
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:17,157
We're not.

932
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:21,161
You know, they say driving
tired is more dangerous than driving drunk

933
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:23,830
and that's a statistical fact.

934
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:25,999
I doubt it.

935
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,960
You know, I drive drunk all the time.

936
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,839
Never had a problem. I slept-drove
once and I smashed into an Arby's.

937
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,049
Take a nap.

938
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:37,927
- All right. Whatever you say. Going down.
- Thank you.

939
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:40,930
Uh-oh.

940
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,015
What happened?

941
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:43,850
You look taller from down here.

942
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,689
WAITRESS: Welcome to the Colonnade.

943
00:44:49,856 --> 00:44:51,024
How y'all doing?

944
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,193
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Good. We're famished, though.

945
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,695
We just drove all the way from Gibson, so.

946
00:44:56,946 --> 00:45:00,825
You know what, do you think we can maybe
have a booth instead of a table?

947
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:04,287
It's just it's real hard
for Walt there to sit on a hard chair,

948
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,498
'cause of his accident and he, uh...

949
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:07,540
(WHISPERING)

950
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:11,002
You know what I mean? He doesn't...

951
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:12,295
(MUTTERING)

952
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,090
Just right at the base.

953
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,389
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

954
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:24,015
Come on.

955
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:28,770
Oh! This is nice.

956
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,565
It's nice and soft, Walt. You like that.

957
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:35,151
Just leave me out of the school plays, okay?

958
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:36,361
I'm not comfortable with it.

959
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:39,364
Now, I have allotted us each $8 per meal,

960
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:42,075
- (SIGHING)
- so it looks like you can get one of the...

961
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,411
One of the salads or a soup or...

962
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:45,620
Sorry, I'm quick.

963
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:48,164
The tomato soup for me,
please. That'll do it.

964
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:51,042
I'm going to take a full
slab of the baby backs,

965
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:54,004
and I'm going to take
that with mashed taters,

966
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,091
hushpuppies and I'm
going to have a sweet tea.

967
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,384
The fuck you are.

968
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,178
(CHUCKLING) I don't know what that means.

969
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,097
I asked you to eat less food.

970
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:07,767
What is wrong with you?

971
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:09,644
This is a beautiful woman.

972
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:11,021
You let her eat.

973
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,024
No, he's right.

974
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:17,610
You know, I've put on a little bit of weight
because of all the stress.

975
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:19,738
- Walter is a fireman.
- (GROANING)

976
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:22,574
Yeah. It's okay, it's okay.

977
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:25,452
He was in a pretty intense...

978
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,578
She doesn't care.

979
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:30,540
...accident last year,
and he injured his male parts.

980
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,209
- Oh.
- They're just shredded down there.

981
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,794
And now he can't work.

982
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:36,755
He wants to fight fires,

983
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,424
and he wants to pee standing up.

984
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:43,595
Don't you want to pee standing up?
I know you do, but he can't.

985
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:44,804
Just bring two soups.

986
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:48,725
And he can't lay with me
like a husband should,

987
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:50,185
on account of the injury.

988
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:51,394
And I don't even need him to,

989
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,814
but he gets mad at me,
and takes his anger out on me.

990
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,524
And then I feel bad about myself

991
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:58,151
and I feel ugly, and then I eat.

992
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,695
Lord knows, I know I eat. I know I do.

993
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:04,366
No, no. You just wait right here,
sweetheart, okay?

994
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:05,700
(SNIFFLING) Okay.

995
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,035
I'm going to wait right here.

996
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:08,203
SANDY: God.

997
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,496
You're breaking the rules.

998
00:47:09,537 --> 00:47:10,914
You understand that?
You're breaking the rules.

999
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,832
Society can't function without rules.

1000
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,000
Ah.

1001
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,168
You follow the rules, right?

1002
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:16,294
I sure do.

1003
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,129
Oh, yeah, how's that working out for you?

1004
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,257
Yeah. Hold on just a minute.

1005
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:23,134
(WEEPING)

1006
00:47:24,177 --> 00:47:28,431
This is from the buffet,
and it is on the house.

1007
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:29,766
That's so sweet.

1008
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,186
Enjoy your soup.

1009
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:36,523
And if you have to pee,
the ladies' room is right back there.

1010
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:40,652
- God bless you. God bless you.
- All right. Okay, okay.

1011
00:47:40,735 --> 00:47:42,028
(SNIFFLING)

1012
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:46,282
You know what a sociopath is?

1013
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:48,618
Do they like ribs?

1014
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,832
Hey, how you doing?
I need one room, two beds, please.

1015
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:54,916
Oh, sorry.

1016
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,168
We only have single beds left tonight.

1017
00:47:57,335 --> 00:47:58,545
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

1018
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,797
We don't really mind.
I mean, it's an inconvenience,

1019
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,049
but my husband can't really
digest stuff anyway

1020
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:04,175
(SIGHING)

1021
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:06,970
because of his intestinal surgery,
so just comp us the mini-bar.

1022
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:08,346
He can digest Pringles.

1023
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,682
Right, that's right. I'm Walt.
This is the wife, Myra.

1024
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:13,351
She's a functional idiot.
Wears diapers like a chimp.

1025
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:15,020
I'm running her down to Disneyland.

1026
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:16,563
She loves the noise and the sugar.

1027
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:17,689
He's just tired from the drive.

1028
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:19,315
We're going to have to figure out
the mattress thing

1029
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,734
because even though I
can't have sex with her

1030
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,652
due to my cock and balls getting shot off

1031
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:23,778
in an apparent warehouse fire...

1032
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:24,946
Oh, shit.

1033
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,531
I wouldn't share a bed with her anyway.

1034
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:29,075
I'd much rather sleep on the floor.
Do you want to know why?

You okay?

1383

Are you all right? You're bleeding.

Oh, God.

God, you did it too hard.

All right. How much is this one?

1407
01:08:00,955 --> 01:08:02,624
That one is 350,000.

1408

What this means? "Traditional"?

1414
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:19,099
It means no homosexuals.

1415
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:21,810
It means no foreigners.

1416
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:23,812
It means no blacks.

Your whore, she's in a rental car.

they look up the Lo-yack.

It's disgusting.

But to answer your question,
the Lo-yack is an excellent product.

01:14:33,306 --> 01:14:34,933
Get away from me!

1552
01:14:37,602 --> 01:14:38,645
Throw him! Throw him!

1553
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:44,150
Oh, God, it was so close to me.

1554
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:46,986
- Thanks for the help.
- You're welcome.

1555
01:14:47,153 --> 01:14:48,488
This is no longer our sleeping spot.

1556
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:49,823
There's probably a fucking ton of them.

1557
01:14:49,989 --> 01:14:51,908
They're not pack animals, Sandy.

1558
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:53,827
I know they're not pack animals, okay?

1559
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:55,453

Oh, shit.

1561
01:14:56,955 --> 01:14:58,998
Just the mere thought of that
is going to keep me up...

1562
01:14:59,457 --> 01:15:00,667
Oh, God.

1563
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:02,002
Don't move.

1564
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:03,503
Not a problem. I'm not moving.

1565
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,296
Shit, it's huge!

1566
01:15:05,463 --> 01:15:06,965
No shit. Get him off me.

1567
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:09,342
Okay. I got it.

1568
01:15:10,176 --> 01:15:11,302
What's the plan with the fire?

1569
01:15:11,344 --> 01:15:12,512
What are you doing with the fire?

1570
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:13,638
Get away from me with that thing.

1571
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,849
I saw it on a television
show. Snakes hate fire.

1572
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:18,351
Unless that was about spiders. I don't know.

1573
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:20,145
You're going to burn me,
and you're going to piss him off.

1574
01:15:20,186 --> 01:15:22,689
- Get away from me.
- Be quiet and stay still.

1575
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:23,940
Get away from me with that thing.

That's not helping.

01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:30,363

Okay. Go slow, fella.

Just go slow. Easy.

Whose pants are these?

1598
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,927
I got them out of the lost and found.

1599
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:35,929
It's a good fit, huh?

1600
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:38,431
Yeah. Okay. Better get on a bus.

1601
01:16:39,265 --> 01:16:43,061
We're not getting on any bus for three days,
not to Denver.

1602

What?

1603
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,606
There's not a bus
from here to Denver for three days.

1604
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:50,068
Hey. When's the next bus to Denver?

1605
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:52,278
Wednesday.

I got nothing left.

01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,693
I got no money, I got no time,
I got no job, I got no chance.

1613
01:17:38,116 --> 01:17:42,162
I've got these weird pants on,
out in the middle of nowhere.

1614
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,708
How did we get here anyway?

1615
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:49,544
I carried you.

1616
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:50,670
You what?

1617
01:17:51,629 --> 01:17:53,882
I carried you. It's not a big deal.

1618
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:56,551
You were unconscious.

1619
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:58,178
We were like, a half
mile from the main road.

1621
01:17:59,429 --> 01:18:02,390
So, I just...
I scooped you up and flagged down a truck,

1622
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:05,185
and he gave us a ride here, dropped us off.

1623
01:18:06,853 --> 01:18:09,356
You carried me a half mile. That's, uh...

1624
01:18:09,522 --> 01:18:12,317
Probably not even that far.
(CLEARING THROAT AWKWARDLY)

the same place you got the pants?

No. Yeah.

1631
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:26,539
Because you needed shoes.

What is the matter with you?

1633
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,753
My socks, though...

1634
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,380
They're your socks,
they're not dead guy socks.

You can get a pretty cheap car

Tell him Carl sent you.
He's a good man, Andrew.

"Well, is that going to be crazy?"

Oh, God, my leg is cramping up.

1719
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:51,721
- What can I do? What can I do?
- Oh, God. Rub it.

1720
01:22:51,888 --> 01:22:52,972
- Rub it?
- Rub it! Rub it!

1721
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,140
Rub it! It's cramping.

1722
01:22:55,892 --> 01:22:56,893
Oh!

1723
01:22:57,727 --> 01:22:58,728
SECURITY GUARD: Up?

1724
01:22:58,812 --> 01:23:01,022
Higher, higher, higher.

1725
01:23:01,147 --> 01:23:02,273
- Higher.
- A little higher.

1726
01:23:02,315 --> 01:23:03,483
Oh, God, it's in my glutes.

1727
01:23:08,738 --> 01:23:09,823
Get in there!

1728
01:23:09,989 --> 01:23:11,241
How is this helping you?

1729
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:14,035
Oh, God! (GRUNTING)

1730
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,375
God, get in there! All right, get off me.

1731
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,459
Get off me.

1732
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,513
I thought it was gonna
be a couple of offices.

1733
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:35,181
No. Come on.

1734
01:23:37,183 --> 01:23:38,268
Who is this guy?

1735
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:42,188
That's Accounts Processing.
That's the "me" of this branch. Come on.

1736
01:23:42,355 --> 01:23:43,690
Oh. That shouldn't be any problem.

1737
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:45,442
No offense, but just keep your mouth shut.

1738
01:23:45,608 --> 01:23:47,527
This will be over in a minute.

1739
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:50,321
Hi. Good morning.

1740
01:23:50,488 --> 01:23:54,868
Tina... Van Westengarden. How are you?

1741
01:23:56,036 --> 01:23:58,163
I'm fine. Can I help you?

1742
01:23:58,371 --> 01:24:01,875
I'm here with my boss, Harold Cornish.
We're in from Denver.

1743
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:03,585
Oh. I'm familiar with the name.

1744
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:05,003
DIANA: I'm sure you are.

1745
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,880
We're gonna need
to get into your Accounts Room.

1746
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,923
Do you have an authorization letter?

1747
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:17,891
(SOFTLY) I'm gonna be real honest with you.

1748
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:19,351
I fucked up.

1749
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:24,064
I just kind of completely
blanked on that authorization letter.

1750
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,233
He basically runs me 24-7. He's...

1751
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,028
Cornish is... He's a handful. I mean...

1752
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:32,072
Honestly, he's an asshole.

1753
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:35,158
And I'm just hoping that we can

1754
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,954
figure something out,
and you can do me a solid and...

1755
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:43,124
You know, I don't think
you want to see me shit-canned.

1756
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:45,794
On my birthday.

1757
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:49,756
'Cause I'm getting married.

1758
01:24:50,924 --> 01:24:52,092
This weekend...

1759
01:24:53,593 --> 01:24:54,969
'Cause I got pregnant.

1760
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:56,930
Just a sec.

1761
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:59,766
Twins. And my cat died.

1762
01:24:59,849 --> 01:25:00,934
How are we doing over there?

1763
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:02,727
We doing good? You calling security?

1764
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:05,146
You better not be calling security.
Hang up the phone right now.

1765
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:06,398
I wasn't calling security.

1766
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:07,899
Yes, you were. Hang it up.

1767
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:09,567
Right now.

1768
01:25:10,568 --> 01:25:12,821
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed back there
without authorization.

1769
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:15,198
I'm not... You're not allowed back there
without authorization.

1770
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:16,574
I can do whatever the hell I want.

1771
01:25:17,158 --> 01:25:19,327
I don't have to tell you that we suspect

1772
01:25:19,411 --> 01:25:20,912
that there are some people at this branch

1773
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,539
that are doing some very, very bad things.

1774
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,290
And I don't have to tell you
that I've been sent here

1775
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:27,544
to look very quietly at some records.

1776
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:31,715
Mr. Cornish, I don't mean any offense,
but we have rules.

1777
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:33,508
I know you have rules.

1778
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:35,301
Like never backdate a 5590

1779
01:25:35,343 --> 01:25:39,472
or don't stamp a 33-B transfer
without telling a client first.

1780
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:41,975
I bet you do that one twice a month,
don't you?

1781
01:25:43,226 --> 01:25:45,061
Tanya, can you give us a minute, please?

1782
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:47,397
It's Tina, but...

1783
01:25:47,564 --> 01:25:49,065
- See what I mean?
- What did I say?

1784
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:50,525
Nothing. You said that.

1785
01:25:51,818 --> 01:25:53,570
I have you at a disadvantage.

1786
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,031
You don't know me, but I know you, Ken.

1787
01:25:56,197 --> 01:26:00,035
I know that you make $49,395 a year.

1788
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:04,080
I know that you work very hard
for that wife and child right there.

1789
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:05,999
I know that you're real good at your job,

1790
01:26:06,082 --> 01:26:07,584
that you take care of this company

1791
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:10,337
and you do things
that they'll never know about,

1792
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,588
that they'll never appreciate.

1793
01:26:11,671 --> 01:26:13,465
So, you're very proud, right?

1794
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:15,383
But you're scared.

1795
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:17,969
You're scared because you're dispensable.

1796
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:21,473
You're scared because you know that,
more than likely, one day,

1797
01:26:21,639 --> 01:26:25,018
you're gonna be replaced
by somebody younger, somebody cheaper,

1798
01:26:25,185 --> 01:26:26,227
maybe even by an app.

1799
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:28,063
But not me.

1800
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,024
I'll be fine, 'cause
I'm on a different level.

1801
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:37,197
So if I don't get into that room today,
I'll be okay. But not you.

1802
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:39,783
You're still going to be scared.

1803
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,119
And that's not fair, is it?

1804
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:45,789
Here's what we can do, though.

1805
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:49,417
You can help me today
and someday I might be able to help you.

1806
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:52,170
But you're gonna have to break the rules.

1807
01:26:53,713 --> 01:26:54,839
9488.

1808
01:27:14,901 --> 01:27:16,236
Got it.

1809
01:27:23,034 --> 01:27:24,369
Let me see it.

1810
01:27:24,577 --> 01:27:26,246
This is it. Right there.

1811
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:28,957
We got it.

1812
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,458
All right. That's what I need.

1813
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,559
Shit.

1815
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:55,442
Got it.

1816
01:27:56,776 --> 01:27:58,361
- Got it.
- Wow.

1817
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:16,629
Okay, great. Good job.

1818
01:28:16,796 --> 01:28:19,257
Let's put this baby to use,
get some gasoline and hit the road again.

1819
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:21,801
Wait, wait, wait. Hit the road? No, no.

1820
01:28:21,968 --> 01:28:25,263
I am exhausted. I need to sleep
for at least a couple of hours.

1821
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,807
I need something to eat
that doesn't come out of a bag

1822
01:28:28,058 --> 01:28:30,810
and I need to put
at least some of my parts into a shower.

1823
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:31,895
I bet you're a real mess.

1824
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:33,813
Do we get you a Motel 6, or something?

1825
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:37,150
Motel 6? No, no, no.

1826
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:39,903
Mr. Cornish, we go wherever we want.

1827
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:43,740
Come on. Let's go.

How about a suite?

1830
01:28:54,334 --> 01:28:56,336
Thank you, Mr. Cornish.

you taught me something.

Well, you taught me a few things.
You taught me

about getting what you want,
and you taught me about confidence.

much about confidence.

01:53:58,797 --> 01:53:59,839
I know. I know.

2238
01:54:00,006 --> 01:54:01,091
I'm putting this in the file.

2239
01:54:01,257 --> 01:54:04,719
Oh, come on, it's not like
somebody's gonna hire an ex-con.

2240
01:54:05,011 --> 01:54:07,722
I'm actually starting a first step program,

2241
01:54:07,889 --> 01:54:09,307
and I have a few years to figure it out.

2242
01:54:09,349 --> 01:54:10,850
Three, with good behavior.

2243
01:54:11,017 --> 01:54:13,061
And how is that going, by the way?

2244
01:54:13,144 --> 01:54:14,187
Great. Great.

2245
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:15,355
- Decent, you know.
- Good.

2246
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:18,858
Some of these dykes are still
really getting up into my sweet junk,

2247
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,443
but I don't let them.

2248
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:22,779
Girls, "sweet junk" is just...

2249
01:54:22,946 --> 01:54:25,907
Dessert. She's having
a problem in the mess hall.

2250
01:54:25,990 --> 01:54:26,991
We should probably get going.

2251
01:54:27,033 --> 01:54:29,536
The lesson there, if you listen,

2252
01:54:29,744 --> 01:54:31,788
is that if you're in the woods,

2253
01:54:31,871 --> 01:54:36,126
maybe a boyish female bear with corn rows

2254
01:54:36,543 --> 01:54:41,381
comes at you this way,
meaning this way, and you just deflect.

2255
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:46,094
It is always nice to see you,
and we'll wait out...

2256
01:54:46,261 --> 01:54:47,345
Girls, let's get going.

2257
01:54:47,429 --> 01:54:49,973
What are you gonna do?
Not let them in, right? Come here.

2258
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:51,599
Bye, Diana.

2259
01:54:51,766 --> 01:54:53,476
Stay beautiful, okay?

2260
01:54:55,854 --> 01:54:56,938
Okay, I'll see you in a couple months?

2261
01:54:57,147 --> 01:54:58,773
Okay. Love you.

2262
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:00,400
Love you, too.

2263
01:55:01,526 --> 01:55:02,819
I got you something.

2264
01:55:03,403 --> 01:55:05,071
- Ooh!
- I pulled some strings with Reilly,

2265
01:55:05,238 --> 01:55:08,616
and we ran your fingerprints
through the Wisconsin state database,

2266
01:55:08,783 --> 01:55:10,326
and we got that.

2267
01:55:14,289 --> 01:55:15,457
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

2268
01:55:16,541 --> 01:55:17,584
My name.

2269
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:21,254
Dawn Budgie.

2270
01:55:23,214 --> 01:55:25,508
(VOICE BREAKING)
That's a terrible fucking name.

2271
01:55:26,176 --> 01:55:27,635
(SNIFFLING) It's a really bad name.

2272
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:32,432
It's not as great as I
was hoping, but it's you.

2273
01:55:33,099 --> 01:55:34,601
Thanks, Sandy.

2274
01:55:38,063 --> 01:55:40,148
But I already know who I am.

2275
01:55:48,114 --> 01:55:49,908
Yep. Thanks.

2276
01:56:02,754 --> 01:56:03,880
(SNIFFLING)

2277
01:56:12,764 --> 01:56:14,599
Back in your cage, bitch.

2278
01:56:16,559 --> 01:56:18,228
- (TASER CLICKING)
- Shit!

2279
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:20,355
- Budgie?
- (GASPING)

2280
01:56:23,942 --> 01:56:25,110
Sorry.

2281
02:00:19,928 --> 02:00:21,680
SKIPTRACER: <i>No, Sandy's a girl's name.</i>
