1
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:04,258
Are you seriously
trying to rope-a-dope me?

2
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:05,907
That's an old man's move.

3
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:08,256
- I am old man.
- No, you're not.

4
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:09,702
But you box like one.

5
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:14,136
Not bad.

6
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:16,026
Come on. Keep your guard up. Come on.

7
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,940
Come on, Ben. You're telegraphin'.

8
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:24,823
Mr. President.

9
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:27,056
Ten minutes, sir.

10
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:28,024
Thank you.

11
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:29,863
Thank you, Forbes.

12
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:33,264
Hey.

13
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,588
You're not supposed
to hit the president.

14
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,466
Yeah. I know.

15
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:40,583
I'll get you next time.

16
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,147
Yeah. I'm sure you will.

17
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:46,588
Perimeter's secure.

18
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:53,899
Weather's getting worse out there,
but we're advised it's drivable.

19
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,581
Post vehicles to stand by.

20
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:03,578
Good evening, Mr. President.
Five minutes, sir.

21
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:04,222
Thanks, Mike.

22
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:06,576
- Evening, ma'am.
- Merry Christmas, Mike.

23
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:08,898
The president gets us off our
dependence on foreign oil...

24
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,184
yet he cannot help
a wife choose an earring.

25
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:15,019
Uh, small one.
Classic look for a classic lady.

26
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:17,463
Good chat.

27
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,263
Kiss ass.

28
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:23,222
Well, I love you both
but I am going with the long.

29
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:28,379
I hate going to these fundraisers.
Why don't you go for me?

30
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,779
Oh, honey. You're perfect.

31
00:02:34,977 --> 00:02:37,218
God forbid people know we kiss.

32
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:52,667
Now the real bloodbath starts
when your mom catches you playing this.

33
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:55,663
You suck.

34
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,265
You suck worse. Come on.

35
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,264
Well,
he likes it when you call him Dries...

36
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,419
because it makes him feel like,
I don't know, you're pals or something.

37
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,180
Hey, love.
You wanna open a gift before we go?

38
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:08,783
It's not love, and I'm gonna wait
'til everyone else is here.

39
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:10,416
Keep forgetting. Sorry.

40
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,222
Do I really have to come with you guys?
I mean, I've been on so many.

41
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:15,026
Re-election's hard work, buddy.

42
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,296
Sorry, pal.

43
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,867
Can I at least ride with Mike?

44
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,899
You'll have to ask him. He's the boss.

45
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,662
Mike, do I get to ride with you?

46
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,107
Okay. All right.

47
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:33,136
Okay, Diaz.
You're riding in the Beast tonight.

48
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,218
Merry Christmas.

49
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,376
Thank you, sir.

50
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,980
You okay to stay back
and watch the fort tonight?

51
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,058
You kidding me? In this weather?

52
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:43,424
Get out of this monkey suit,
sit by the fire,

53
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,976
watch "Breaking Bad?" Fine by me.

54
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,900
My own little retirement party?

55
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,186
Leave the babysitter alone, all right?

56
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,778
- Are you going to wear that hat?
- I like the hat.

57
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,938
I think it's fine.
It's age appropriate.

58
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,827
- You take it off when you get inside.
- No, the girls dig it.

59
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:01,943
Mustang, this is Big Top.

60
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:03,666
Bringing out the full package.

61
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,099
Let's go.

62
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:08,148
Package is on the move.

63
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:33,428
ETA to Morgan residence, 22 minutes.

64
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,307
Keep it tight, everybody.

65
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,658
Hey, Connor. Come on.
Scoot back. Put your belt on.

66
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,658
What if I don't?

67
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,263
Then O'Neil here's gonna punch
in the nuts. Come on.

68
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:49,699
You keeping 180 degrees awareness?

69
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,539
I thought you said it was 360.

70
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,863
Yeah, I was just checkin'.

71
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,780
Setting me up is what you're doing.

72
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:57,776
All right. So, how many emergency exits

73
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:59,220
- in the West Wing?
- 8.

74
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:01,902
How many feet from the Oval Office
to the PEOC elevator?

75
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,536
116.

76
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,868
From doors closing in the elevator,

77
00:05:04,857 --> 00:05:06,382
how long does it
take to get to the PEOC?

78
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:07,456
Four minutes.

79
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,618
Security cameras? How many have audio?

80
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:11,060
Only the ones in the common areas.

81
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,942
- Not bad.
- Kid's got it, huh?

82
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:15,816
Yeah, we're gonna make
a Secret Service agent outta you yet.

83
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,706
You just need to remember
to keep your seat belt on.

84
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:18,664
That's right.

85
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,586
Gosh, it's really coming down.

86
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:39,138
I've been thinking about shaving my head.

87
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,302
That sounds good.

88
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:46,224
It's getting worse out there. Bring it down to five.

89
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:51,739
Merry Christmas, Mr. President.

90
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:54,788
You shouldn't have.

91
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:05,576
My God. It's my grandfather's watch.

92
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,022
How did you find this?

93
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:09,587
Just have my ways.

94
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,176
Thank you.

95
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,702
You're just welcome.

96
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:17,745
Now, let's talk about that shaved head idea.

97
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,176
You were listening.

98
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:19,860
You didn't think I was listening,

99
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:21,347
- did you?
- Very clever.

100
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,700
You ever been to a billionaire's
Christmas party before, Diaz?

101
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:30,296
- No, sir.
- They're over-rated.

102
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:31,298
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:32,617 --> 00:06:34,221
Oh, my gosh.

104
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:35,978
Look what I found.

105
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:38,307
Where'd that come from?

106
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:40,343
Merry Christmas.

107
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:54,902
Stop, stop, stop!

108
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,060
Hey, Connor, stay right there!

109
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:15,056
Clear communications, it's Diaz.

110
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:16,024
- First lady's injured.
- Connor.

111
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:18,301
Get some weight on the back!
O'Neil, get on the back!

112
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:19,742
I'm gonna get this door!

113
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:22,544
- Don't anybody move inside! Don't move!
- Mike! Maggie!

114
00:07:31,897 --> 00:07:33,340
- Sir?
- Seat belt’s stuck!

115
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,461
Sir, get out of the car!
I'll take care of her!

116
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:37,182
Keep your weight on the back, O'Neil!

117
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:39,141
- Hold it back!
- Roma, open the fucking door!

118
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:42,102
It's jammed! It's fucking jammed!
Pull her out that side!

119
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:43,982
It's going down! it's going down!

120
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:46,901
O'Neil, goddamn it!
Hold it down! Hold it down!

121
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:52,023
- Mike, it's going!
- Hold it back!

122
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:54,627
Mike, take Maggie!

123
00:07:55,097 --> 00:07:56,736
Shit. Sir, I'm sorry!

124
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,421
- Watch out, it's going!
- Maggie!

125
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,262
No, Mike!

126
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:10,742
No!

127
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:33,341
Mom!

128
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:47,903
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,898
Yeah.

130
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,904
And I don't like going to
barbecues by myself, you know?

131
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:06,020
North Korean maneuvers along the DMZ
continue to ring alarm bells...

132
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:09,019
throughout Pacific markets,
even as President Asher...

133
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,066
is set to meet this afternoon
with South Korean...

134
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,742
Babe, we out of coffee?

135
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,381
I don't know. Are we?

136
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:22,027
All right, just...
I thought you said that anything...

137
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:28,898
You were saying?

138
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:32,427
I was saying, I'll get some more coffee.

139
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,064
Great.

140
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:38,336
So, how was the barbecue I missed?

141
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,943
It was actually kind of fun.
You might have enjoyed it.

142
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:41,938
Yeah?

143
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:44,981
Paula's got this new boyfriend
who's very sweet...

144
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:47,787
but he's working in the same department
as her ex, Alex.

145
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:49,056
Remember Alex?

146
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:52,345
Anyway,
Alex ended up showing up at the party...

147
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:56,547
which was really weird for Paula,
who was...

148
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,468
overwhelmed.

149
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,216
Mike, you're not listening to me.

150
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:05,176
I was listening.

151
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:05,860
You were talking about

152
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,901
- patty's boyfriend and she's...
- No.

153
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:11,060
Paula and Paula's boyfriend.
You've met Paula.

154
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:13,938
It's okay, Mike.
We'll talk about it later.

155
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:15,822
All right, babe. I'm sorry.

156
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:20,620
But I tell you what.
Why don't we go see a movie tonight?

157
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:22,301
Okay? Just the two of us.

158
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:27,340
Or you can bring Paula and Patty
and their boyfriends.

159
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:28,907
You know what I think we should do?

160
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:33,144
I think we should take that holiday
that we've been talking about.

161
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:34,376
All right?

162
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:37,586
You, me, the ocean.

163
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,180
Come on. It'll be like the honeymoon
we never had.

164
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:45,020
We didn't have a honeymoon?

165
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:04,704
Thanks.

166
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:07,299
So, how was your Fourth?

167
00:12:08,057 --> 00:12:09,616
My fourth what?

168
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,618
Fourth of July. Don't be an ass.

169
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:13,984
Some people do take holidays, you know.

170
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:17,016
Yeah, it was quiet.
You know, we stayed in.

171
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:17,984
We?

172
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,376
Okay. I stayed in. She went out.

173
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:22,976
I'm shocked.

174
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,176
Mrs. Jacobs.

175
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,142
- Good morning.
- Director.

176
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:26,216
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey, Roma.

177
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:27,548
- Good to see you, partner.
- How's the family?

178
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:29,139
- The kids are good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

179
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,377
- O'Neil.
- Hey, Banning.

180
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:31,898
You're looking sharp.

181
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,536
So, we missed you for, poker,
uh, last week. Where were you?

182
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:35,345
Missed taking your money.

183
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:37,658
Yeah, I know.
I've been working the late shift.

184
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,868
Yeah, non-stop action over there
at the Treasury.

185
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:42,820
You gotta do what you gotta do, right?

186
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,941
Yeah.
You guys got a big day coming up, huh?

187
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,699
You got the Koreans coming in?

188
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,176
Nah, I mean, you know.
Business as usual.

189
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:50,827
Hey, I wanted to introduce you.
This is Agent Jones.

190
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,387
You've heard of Mike Banning,
haven't you?

191
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:53,458
Yeah, yeah. The guy who told

192
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,425
the Speaker of the House
to go fuck himself.

193
00:12:58,057 --> 00:13:00,058
Don't you guys have somewhere to be?

194
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:01,656
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

195
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,261
- Hey, Mike. Good seein' you.
- Yeah, you too.

196
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,180
- Come Thursday night, all right?
- Okay.

197
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:06,178
Seven o'clock.

198
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:11,021
Not getting any easier, huh?

199
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:12,624
No.

200
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:16,377
I want back in.

201
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,067
Desk job's killing me.

202
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,256
Mike.

203
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,544
Everybody knows you did the right thing
on that bridge.

204
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:24,665
Hell, even the president knows.

205
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:29,268
He just doesn't want to see you
and have to be reminded of it every day.

206
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:33,067
He never even stopped
to grieve properly.

207
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,743
Just, give it some time.

208
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:40,056
How's Connor?

209
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:42,696
President's son, misses his mom.

210
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,216
Hell of a gig.

211
00:13:44,217 --> 00:13:45,976
Misses his buddy though.

212
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:47,263
Yeah, he's a good kid.

213
00:13:47,897 --> 00:13:49,136
Is he still sneaking
around the White House,

214
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:50,420
making everybody crazy?

215
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:52,021
Oh, I wonder who taught him that.

216
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:58,742
You know, the first time you walked
into my office out of the darkness...

217
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:01,104
you needed therapy then.
Never mind now.

218
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:04,696
And you don't exactly
do yourself any favors.

219
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:05,936
Where are you going with this?

220
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:09,982
Mike. Look, you gotta learn
how to get back into the real world.

221
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,105
That's good, Jacobs.
Let me write that one down.

222
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:19,239
Hey, Jacobs.

223
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:22,816
Thanks.

224
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,148
I'll be in touch.

225
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:01,184
Hey, buddy. What do you think of this?

226
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:06,459
- Which one do you like?
- I don't know.

227
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:11,308
Okay, you take that one.
I'll take this one.

228
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,348
- Maggie! Maggie!
- I'll take care of her! Sir!

229
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:39,827
No! No, Mike!

230
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:58,906
Mr. Foss came in. Chest pains.
About an hour ago.

231
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:05,656
Hey, it's Leah.

232
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:07,864
You've reached my phone.
You know what to do.

233
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,708
Just checking in.

234
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:17,746
Listen, I'll call you later. Bye.

235
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:22,427
Get some fishing in.

236
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:26,176
Hit the bag together. Be fun.

237
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,936
I hate Camp David.

238
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:31,576
Do we really have to go?
Can't we go somewhere else?

239
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:33,739
You know, the beach?

240
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:36,344
Yeah.

241
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,541
The beach does kinda sound better.

242
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,339
Hey.

243
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:50,376
I've got three minutes.

244
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,220
Let's run down to the kitchen
and get some ice cream.

245
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,376
Yeah.

246
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:54,896
Chocolate chip or rocky road?

247
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:56,820
I'm gonna have rocky road
before you eat it all,

248
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,057
like you did the last time.

249
00:16:58,577 --> 00:17:01,148
- I don't remember it that way.
- Yeah, you did.

250
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,384
Come in.

251
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,221
Mr. President, we're ready for you.

252
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:08,621
- Already?
- Yes, sir.

253
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:11,223
Sorry, buddy.

254
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:12,738
It's okay, Dad.

255
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:15,104
All right.

256
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:17,583
I'll see you soon.

257
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,259
Minister Lee
is going to want you to issue

258
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,418
a joint statement, Mr. President...

259
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,023
threatening military action
to get the North Koreans...

260
00:17:57,024 --> 00:17:59,256
to stand down from the border

261
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:01,736
and stop their missile tests.

262
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:03,626
Which I think we should give them.

263
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:07,656
Ruth?

264
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:10,183
Provided that the
North Koreans are rational...

265
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:11,986
which is dicey, at best.

266
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,096
We bluff. They call it. Then what?

267
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:17,826
Well, who says we'd be bluffing?

268
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:21,345
Personally,
I like to try to avoid a war.

269
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:23,824
Charlie?

270
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:27,467
I think I agree with Ruth on this one,
Mr. President.

271
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:30,861
Thank you for sitting in, Mr. Speaker.

272
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,939
- Yes, sir.
- I won't hold you up any longer.

273
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:45,819
- Hello, Mr. Speaker.
- Hello, Janie.

274
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,622
What time is Minister Lee due to arrive?

275
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:50,107
7:00 this evening.

276
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,027
Our guests have arrived.

277
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:33,896
Prime Minister Lee.

278
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:35,656
I'm Special Agent-in-Charge Roma.

279
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:37,227
I'd like to welcome you
to the White House, sir.

280
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:37,862
Thank you.

281
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,940
May I introduce my Head of Security
and Chief Aide, Mr. Park.

282
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:44,668
My pleasure.
Prime Minister, after you, please.

283
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:53,141
Agent Davis will be taking care
of your security team outside.

284
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:56,902
Prime Minister, if you would follow
Agent O'Neil, please?

285
00:20:58,217 --> 00:20:59,139
Ma'am?

286
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,219
Private sector looks good on you, Dave.

287
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,787
Yeah, something to look forward to.

288
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:06,736
Yeah. How've you been?

289
00:21:06,737 --> 00:21:08,579
I'll tell you.
I miss the Secret Service.

290
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,988
Best years of my life.

291
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:12,416
It misses you too, old man.

292
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,907
I could still kick your ass.

293
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:16,620
At what? Dominos?

294
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,625
- It's good to see you, my friend.
- You, too.

295
00:21:33,017 --> 00:21:33,938
Unidentified flight,

296
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:37,221
this is Flight Leader, U.S. Air
Force aircraft at your starboard wing.

297
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,946
You've entered restricted airspace.

298
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:40,418
Unidentified flight,

299
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:43,941
you must divert immediately
to vector 0-2-0. Acknowledge.

300
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:46,221
I'm sorry to have
disrupted your vacation.

301
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,707
Please. I'm glad you could come.

302
00:21:48,217 --> 00:21:50,345
Mr. Lee, we have a mutual problem.

303
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:54,141
And I think together,
I'm confident we can find a solution.

304
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:57,027
Thank you, Mr. President.
That's why I'm here.

305
00:21:57,577 --> 00:22:00,462
As you know, North Korea
has a one million man standing army...

306
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:02,698
less than 50 kilometers
from our capital.

307
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:04,263
The threat is real.

308
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,621
Unidentified flight.

309
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:10,183
You must divert immediately
to vector 0-2-0.

310
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:13,420
This is your final warning.
You will be shot down. Acknowledge.

311
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:23,345
Anti-aircraft. We're taking fire.

312
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:39,137
Mr. Lee, I'm sure you can appreciate
that this is...

313
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,821
Sir? There's been an incursion.
Please stand up.

314
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:41,784
Let's go. Move!

315
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:44,938
- Mr. Lee, please join us.
- That's not protocol, sir.

316
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:45,741
He's coming with us!

317
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:47,705
Move, move, move!
Get him to the elevator.

318
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:51,180
- Go! Go!
- Find Connor!

319
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:53,296
Code 9-9-9.

320
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,628
Go, go, go! Move!

321
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:57,498
Keep moving!
Get that elevator open now!

322
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:06,019
Give me four minutes, Mr. President.

323
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,382
Harden down on Olympus.

324
00:23:11,777 --> 00:23:13,302
Air support on the way.

325
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:17,816
ETA, four minutes.

326
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:21,026
Code Red. Air space 1 and 2 compromised.

327
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,262
Robert, Delta, Ready One.

328
00:23:23,263 --> 00:23:26,227
Move to West Corridor!
Move to West Corridor!

329
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:43,176
This way, please.

330
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:45,783
This is not a drill.
Evacuate immediately.

331
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:16,256
All units, 9-9-9.

332
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:19,898
I repeat, all units, 9-9-9.

333
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,350
Let's move!

334
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:13,424
Find my son.

335
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:15,228
Sylvio, find Sparkplug immediately.

336
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,457
You okay, Mr. President?

337
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,342
Sir. This way. Over here.

338
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,746
Go on! Get down!

339
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:30,260
Get down!

340
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:42,341
Stay down! Don't move!

341
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:49,026
Get down! Get out of the way!
Take cover!

342
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:21,584
PPD Command, this is Wolfhound 6.
Have bogey in sight.

343
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:24,788
Wolfhound 6, fire at will.
Repeat, fire at will.

344
00:26:25,177 --> 00:26:26,258
Acknowledge.

345
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,944
Mr. President?

346
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:31,018
We have confirmation
that the bogey is down, sir.

347
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:32,617
Thank you, Jones.

348
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:36,816
Activate Compound One.

349
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:40,264
I want open lines to the Pentagon,
Homeland Security and NSA.

350
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:44,262
Charlie.
Coordinate with the Air Force and FAA.

351
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,780
- Find out if that's' a lone aircraft.
- Yes, sir.

352
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:48,063
Half hour at the most.

353
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:51,865
Ruth. Where the hell is my son?

354
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,024
Hey!

355
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:37,416
Hey!

356
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,226
Hey, get the fuck down!

357
00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:42,896
Mr. Lee. We've had a problem.

358
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:44,740
- Please have patience with us.
- Got it.

359
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,466
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

360
00:29:48,617 --> 00:29:49,982
It's a critical message.

361
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,266
The White House is under ground attack.

362
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:22,661
Officer on deck!

363
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:25,467
Rapid Response Team from Andrews,
get 'em moving!

364
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:27,696
At ease. How bad is it?

365
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:29,182
Front fence has been breached.

366
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:31,178
We've got a C-130 burning
on the South Lawn

367
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,020
and a gunfight raging on the North.

368
00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:34,896
Fucking shitting me.

369
00:30:34,897 --> 00:30:36,223
Where's the president?

370
00:30:36,224 --> 00:30:37,104
In the bunker.

371
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:14,381
- Get me the Pentagon on the line now!
- Yes, sir!

372
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:15,378
It's happening.

373
00:31:22,657 --> 00:31:23,658
Mr. President!

374
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:35,023
Forbes, what are you doing?

375
00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:39,058
- Move!
- For God's sakes, Forbes.

376
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:47,901
Forbes! What are you doing?

377
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:49,099
Shut up!

378
00:32:48,977 --> 00:32:50,096
Come on. Tim.

379
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:51,896
Come on. Hang in there!

380
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:52,784
Hey!

381
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:55,138
Ah, shit.

382
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:01,776
Where's the president?

383
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:02,938
I don't know!

384
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:06,258
Goddamn it! Where's that response team?

385
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:08,736
- They're 5 minutes out, sir, but...
- But what?

386
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,138
We have a hostage situation
on our hands.

387
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:12,866
P.E.O.C.'s gone offline.

388
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:40,703
Go back! Get back now! Go back!

389
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:21,463
Fuck!

390
00:34:24,617 --> 00:34:25,982
RPG!

391
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:38,423
Get in! Get inside! Get inside!

392
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,265
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

393
00:36:07,657 --> 00:36:09,227
Go, go! Move!

394
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:13,216
Fall back, fall back!

395
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:14,582
Let's go, let's go!

396
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,704
- They're down the hall!
- Shit, we've only got four guys left!

397
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:26,347
Hold your positions, you understand?

398
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:32,940
I got this door. Cover the other one.

399
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:58,616
Olympus has fallen. Olympus has fallen.

400
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,142
Olympus has fallen.

401
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:02,984
Fuck you!

402
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:09,981
They've taken the White House.

403
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:40,105
Command, Sniper Team One, in position.

404
00:38:02,377 --> 00:38:04,936
We're coming from the White House.
So far, the perimeter's been set.

405
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:07,622
We're waiting on more intel to come
in right now, and once we do...

406
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:09,262
Bravo team's gonna breach.

407
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:11,908
- Wait for my command to execute.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:17,903
Not since the British burned down
the White House in the War of 1812...

409
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:21,102
has an enemy force occupied
the center of American power.

410
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:21,939
The White House,

411
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,623
the most protected building on Earth,
has fallen.

412
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,418
Sir,
we have a hot feed from the P.E.O.C.

413
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:33,376
Mr. Lee. Sir, are you safe?

414
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,106
Are you with the president?

415
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,781
Sir, can you hear m...?

416
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:38,898
Oh, my God.

417
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,308
Don't negotiate.

418
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:51,783
Sir?

419
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,259
I have your commander-in-chief.

420
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:57,427
Now, stand down.

421
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:59,216
Who are you?

422
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:01,982
I am the man in control
of your White House.

423
00:39:04,097 --> 00:39:07,067
Now, stand your men down.

424
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:15,576
- Stand down!
- Sir.

425
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:17,386
All units, stand down!

426
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:21,416
Ladies and gentlemen we are at DEFCON 4.

427
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,748
How could you?

428
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,938
- Put your hands up.
- Fuck you.

429
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:40,388
No!

430
00:39:49,457 --> 00:39:51,459
There is a reason I never voted for you.

431
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:55,102
Don't do it, Forbes!

432
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:50,742
It takes 15 minutes
for your Armed Forces

433
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:52,262
to reach the White House.

434
00:41:54,817 --> 00:41:56,626
We took it down in 13.

435
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:35,142
Hurry, we need a wheelchair.

436
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:37,743
In Triage, do you want me
to color code them or number code them?

437
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:38,658
Color code 'em.

438
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,739
Okay, Pam,
we still need to take the vitals.

439
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:53,463
Call, Mike. Mike.

440
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:59,296
The cellular service in the area
you are calling

441
00:43:59,297 --> 00:44:00,264
has been suspended temporarily.

442
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:02,863
I got head trauma,
six-year-old girl, she's fading!

443
00:44:20,737 --> 00:44:22,307
Bring Mr. Asher here.

444
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,619
What are you doing, for Christ's sake?

445
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:30,423
Oh, sir!

446
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:36,427
I have no interest
in your nuclear launch codes.

447
00:44:38,857 --> 00:44:41,622
By now your Pentagon
has changed then, no?

448
00:44:42,857 --> 00:44:44,188
Sit.

449
00:44:44,937 --> 00:44:46,348
You from the North?

450
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:48,945
You sure as hell are not from the South.

451
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:51,346
I'm working for justice.

452
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:54,180
To give millions of starving
men, women and children

453
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:56,700
a chance at more than just subsistence.

454
00:44:56,701 --> 00:45:00,418
To end the civil war your country
interrupted so long ago.

455
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:02,463
And yes...

456
00:45:04,377 --> 00:45:06,816
for a united, prosperous Korea.

457
00:45:06,817 --> 00:45:08,740
It's a whole new world, baby.

458
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:11,698
What's the going rate for souls
these days?

459
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:13,696
What'd you say to me?

460
00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:15,426
I never would have taken you
for a traitor.

461
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:16,384
Me?

462
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:18,616
What about you?

463
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:21,746
You sold this country out long
before I ever did.

464
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:25,896
Globalization and fucking Wall Street.

465
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:28,946
What's it cost to buy
a presidency nowadays anyway?

466
00:45:29,457 --> 00:45:32,416
$500 million?

467
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:36,342
I'm a fucking rookie compared to you!

468
00:45:37,657 --> 00:45:39,466
Gotta keep your gloves up, Forbes.

469
00:45:40,617 --> 00:45:41,459
Enough!

470
00:45:46,137 --> 00:45:47,707
What about Connor?

471
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:50,026
What the fuck are you gonna do
with my son?

472
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:03,778
Mr. Speaker.

473
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:06,939
As both the President
and the Vice President

474
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,018
of the United States
are unable to discharge

475
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:10,460
the duties of their offices

476
00:46:10,461 --> 00:46:14,257
I'm officially placing you
under Secret Service protection.

477
00:46:18,697 --> 00:46:21,621
You are the Acting President
of the United States.

478
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,937
Are they alive?

479
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:26,578
They are.

480
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:41,780
Sir, North Korea is denying
any involvement in the attack.

481
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:44,343
We've secured the perimeter
of the White House...

482
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:46,222
and cleared a 10-block radius.

483
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:50,063
Sir, they've also assassinated
the South Korean Prime Minister.

484
00:47:57,897 --> 00:48:00,543
We have contact
from inside the White House.

485
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,938
Trace confirms
it's the president's Sat phone.

486
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:04,224
Put it through!

487
00:48:05,377 --> 00:48:06,788
Mr. President?

488
00:48:07,097 --> 00:48:08,536
Negative.

489
00:48:08,537 --> 00:48:11,016
- Identify yourself.
- Echelon Four.

490
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:12,018
That's one of yours?

491
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:16,336
- Designator?
- Oscar Zulu 309.

492
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:19,056
Jesus. Banning? Where are you?

493
00:48:19,057 --> 00:48:20,656
I'm in the Oval Office.

494
00:48:20,657 --> 00:48:22,307
Is the president in the bunker?

495
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:24,903
- He...
- Can we trust him?

496
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,901
Banning was one of our best agents.

497
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:30,336
Mr. Speaker, I just have to say,
this is Mike Banning.

498
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:32,816
This is the same guy that was removed
from the president's detail...

499
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:33,737
- after the accident
- Whoa, whoa,

500
00:48:33,738 --> 00:48:34,976
- when we lost the first lady?
- Ray! Ray! Ray!

501
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:35,976
- You wanna add something?
- Well, what's he doing

502
00:48:35,977 --> 00:48:36,783
- I suggest you get your facts straight.
- In the White House right now?

503
00:48:36,784 --> 00:48:38,302
- How do we know we can trust this guy?

504
00:48:38,303 --> 00:48:41,107
Banning is ex-Special Forces,
Ranger Battalion

505
00:48:41,108 --> 00:48:45,147
He will move mountains or die try.
I know him.

506
00:48:45,617 --> 00:48:46,820
Does anyone else in this room

507
00:48:46,821 --> 00:48:49,548
have any intelligence
coming out of the White House?

508
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:52,942
Then we have no choice.

509
00:48:54,777 --> 00:48:58,577
Yes. The president's in the bunker.
He's being held hostage.

510
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,340
What do they want?

511
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:02,782
We're trying to find out.

512
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:04,536
Who's in charge?

513
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:05,456
Trumbull.

514
00:49:05,457 --> 00:49:08,028
- Are there any survivors with you?
- Negative, sir.

515
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:10,108
They wiped us out.

516
00:49:12,177 --> 00:49:14,461
They have commandos roaming
the hallways...

517
00:49:14,462 --> 00:49:16,824
with enough explosives
to take out an army.

518
00:49:17,177 --> 00:49:20,856
Looks like the doors and windows
are rigged with C-4 explosives.

519
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:23,098
Who knows what other tricks
they have up their sleeves?

520
00:49:23,657 --> 00:49:26,820
Any team coming in is gonna be ringing
the front doorbell pretty loud.

521
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:28,656
They shut the power down.

522
00:49:28,657 --> 00:49:31,103
Lights off.
And I assume they closed the air vents.

523
00:49:31,537 --> 00:49:32,459
I killed the surveillance,

524
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,664
but I don't know
how long that's gonna last.

525
00:49:34,665 --> 00:49:35,704
Where's Connor?

526
00:49:36,217 --> 00:49:40,342
Oh, we have no status of his location,
but he's presumed to still be inside.

527
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:42,099
Well, they're looking for him.

528
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,428
They have his photo.

529
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:45,183
Sir...

530
00:49:45,897 --> 00:49:47,616
I'm here. Use me.

531
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:50,666
Okay, Banning. Sit tight.
We'll get back with you.

532
00:50:48,297 --> 00:50:50,459
Sir, we have a hot feed
from the P.E.O.C.

533
00:50:51,137 --> 00:50:53,696
- Mr. Speaker.
- What is it you want?

534
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:56,621
Recall the Seventh Fleet
from the Sea of Japan.

535
00:50:56,622 --> 00:51:01,576
And withdraw all 28,500 American troops
from the Demilitarized Zone.

536
00:51:01,577 --> 00:51:03,227
If you do not comply.

537
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:07,061
If you attempt any operation
to take this building...

538
00:51:07,062 --> 00:51:10,059
- if you deviate from my instructions...
- Wait a minute.

539
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,298
We can't just recall the Seventh Fleet.

540
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:14,868
Then I will execute your officials
one by one...

541
00:51:15,257 --> 00:51:17,338
and their blood will be on your hands.

542
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:18,668
You have until dawn.

543
00:51:18,977 --> 00:51:20,900
I suggest you move quickly.

544
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:23,658
Who is that guy?

545
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:26,303
Well, sir, we're running facial
recognition on him right now.

546
00:51:26,304 --> 00:51:29,062
Well, he cleared as part of
the South Korean security detail.

547
00:51:29,063 --> 00:51:32,696
If we recall the Fleet,
and leave the DMZ...

548
00:51:32,697 --> 00:51:36,178
Seoul, all of South Korea could fall
within 72 hours, sir.

549
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:39,259
But if we do nothing, they kill Asher,
the vice president...

550
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,225
and his entire National Security team.

551
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:43,345
And Connor, if he's in there.

552
00:51:58,937 --> 00:52:00,656
Mary, get me some coffee

553
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:04,456
Half-and-half, three Sweet 'N Lows.
In a real cup.

554
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:06,744
Not one of those paper
or Styrofoam things.

555
00:52:09,217 --> 00:52:13,176
All right.
Let's secure all nuclear sites.

556
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,536
Get me our expert on North Korea.

557
00:52:15,537 --> 00:52:18,858
Then I want to speak with the Premiere
of North Korea on a secure line.

558
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:20,699
After that,
I wanna speak with the Russians,

559
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,661
the Chinese,
the British and the French.

560
00:52:22,662 --> 00:52:24,944
And set up a press conference.
In that order.

561
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:32,066
The United States of America
doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

562
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:41,302
Who said anything about negotiating?

563
00:53:09,177 --> 00:53:13,307
Admiral Hoenig, your Cerberus code.

564
00:53:19,977 --> 00:53:21,979
You kill him, you won't get the code.

565
00:53:23,217 --> 00:53:25,185
I will not ask again.

566
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:48,028
- Give it to him, Joe.
- Mr. President.

567
00:53:48,457 --> 00:53:49,982
You'll never get mine.

568
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:55,988
Tango-Juliet-1-9-3-3-4.

569
00:53:57,897 --> 00:53:59,096
Louder.

570
00:53:59,097 --> 00:54:04,103
Tango-Juliet-1-9-3-3-4.

571
00:54:16,177 --> 00:54:17,417
What the hell?

572
00:54:18,617 --> 00:54:20,221
Get me Homeland Security.

573
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:21,184
No, now!

574
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:29,381
Sir. NORAD reports a Cerberus code
has been entered.

575
00:54:30,297 --> 00:54:31,662
Jesus.

576
00:54:38,857 --> 00:54:42,942
Jacobs, I got something coming your way.

577
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:45,540
I got a clean commando in front of me.

578
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:48,902
- What is that?
- Is he alive?

579
00:54:48,903 --> 00:54:50,422
Ask me a serious question.

580
00:54:51,217 --> 00:54:52,707
Anybody around the table?

581
00:54:53,897 --> 00:54:55,303
We don't recognize it.

582
00:54:55,304 --> 00:54:58,221
Well, whoever they are,
they're fucking good.

583
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:01,456
They're well-trained
and they're well-organized.

584
00:55:01,457 --> 00:55:02,663
But I guess you know that already.

585
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:03,943
Get that over to Langley.

586
00:55:04,777 --> 00:55:06,858
So, what have you got? Talk to me.

587
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:09,940
They want us to recall the Seventh Fleet
and pull our troops out.

588
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:12,143
Oh, is that all?

589
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:15,858
A Cerberus code has been entered.

590
00:55:16,577 --> 00:55:17,976
What's Cerberus?

591
00:55:17,977 --> 00:55:19,296
That's classified.

592
00:55:19,297 --> 00:55:20,981
Classified? Really?

593
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:24,660
Well, right now I think I have
the proverbial need-to-fucking-know.

594
00:55:29,417 --> 00:55:32,660
Cerberus is a
highly-classified military protocol.

595
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:38,023
A 3-pronged fail-safe in the case of
an inadvertent nuclear launch.

596
00:55:39,177 --> 00:55:42,656
It allows us to access
the self-destruct mechanism

597
00:55:42,657 --> 00:55:45,096
in our ICBM's in-flight.

598
00:55:45,097 --> 00:55:48,222
So even if one of our nuclear warheads
was launched and we wanted to abort.

599
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,346
Cerberus is the only way to stop it
from reaching its target.

600
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:53,704
No one person has all three codes.

601
00:55:54,137 --> 00:55:57,342
It's parceled out to the president,
Secretary of Defense...

602
00:55:57,343 --> 00:55:59,338
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

603
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:02,102
All of whom are
in the president's bunker right now.

604
00:56:02,103 --> 00:56:05,896
With those codes they can destroy
any long-reach nuke that we fire.

605
00:56:05,897 --> 00:56:09,788
And that would make America vulnerable
to a nuclear strike.

606
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:13,016
So, change the codes.

607
00:56:13,017 --> 00:56:14,096
We can't.

608
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:16,061
Cerberus was designed
as a self-contained

609
00:56:16,062 --> 00:56:17,542
total-isolation system.

610
00:56:17,543 --> 00:56:20,582
The only way to change the codes
is physically on the computer itself.

611
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,818
Which is located
in the president's bunker.

612
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:25,340
So, now we know why
they wanted the president's son.

613
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,940
The president will hold out
as long as he can.

614
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:29,587
But if they get his son...

615
00:56:30,297 --> 00:56:31,628
if they hurt him...

616
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,096
well...

617
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:35,862
nobody could hold out
under those circumstances.

618
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:37,862
So, find Connor

619
00:56:38,297 --> 00:56:39,947
get him the hell out of there.

620
00:56:40,617 --> 00:56:41,618
Yes, sir.

621
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,108
Mr. Forbes.

622
00:56:57,977 --> 00:56:59,183
Who is that?

623
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:07,388
Mike Banning.

624
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:18,456
And who might that be?

625
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:21,825
He was on the president's protection
detail for a few years.

626
00:57:22,537 --> 00:57:24,256
Are we worried about him?

627
00:57:24,257 --> 00:57:25,383
Hell no.

628
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:29,783
No.

629
00:57:31,257 --> 00:57:32,588
He should be.

630
00:59:37,137 --> 00:59:42,621
Did Truman gut the White House interior
in 1948 or '49?

631
00:59:43,337 --> 00:59:45,260
I believe it was '49.

632
00:59:46,337 --> 00:59:49,898
Steel frame over
the old stone walls. Yes?

633
01:00:08,337 --> 01:00:09,384
Connor!

634
01:00:15,817 --> 01:00:18,104
- How're you doing? Okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

635
01:00:24,177 --> 01:00:26,748
I see this is still
your favorite hiding place, huh?

636
01:00:30,057 --> 01:00:31,456
I've got Sparkplug

637
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:33,266
Finally, some good news.

638
01:00:34,017 --> 01:00:36,588
He's safe. I'm bringing him out.

639
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:39,776
What about my dad?

640
01:00:39,777 --> 01:00:42,376
Your dad's gonna be fine, okay?

641
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:43,538
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

642
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:44,982
We can get him outta here.

643
01:01:37,617 --> 01:01:39,142
- Okay?
- Yeah.

644
01:01:39,617 --> 01:01:41,426
All right. Let's get outta here.

645
01:01:43,377 --> 01:01:45,696
- You ready to haul ass?
- Yeah.

646
01:01:45,697 --> 01:01:46,983
Okay, stay close.

647
01:01:50,097 --> 01:01:50,905
Okay.

648
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,024
Come on.

649
01:02:13,657 --> 01:02:14,624
Okay, come on.

650
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:21,976
All right, kiddo.

651
01:02:21,977 --> 01:02:24,456
Keep an eye out, okay? Watch my six.

652
01:02:24,457 --> 01:02:25,344
Jacobs.

653
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:27,587
Okay, I have Sparkplug.

654
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:32,543
He's coming out in a ventilation shaft
in the northwest corner, ground floor.

655
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:33,820
Have the green party waiting.

656
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:34,739
We'll be there.

657
01:02:56,057 --> 01:02:58,901
How are you gonna fit through that?
You're coming with me, right?

658
01:03:02,337 --> 01:03:03,748
I gotta go get your dad.

659
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:06,376
All right. Now, listen, you can do this.

660
01:03:06,377 --> 01:03:09,187
Now, you remember chimney climbing
I taught you on the Rose Garden wall?

661
01:03:09,188 --> 01:03:12,016
Yeah? So, that's all it is. Okay?

662
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:15,099
It's one foot against the front wall,
one foot against the back.

663
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,622
Now, all the way to the top.

664
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:23,696
- Mike?
- Yeah.

665
01:03:23,697 --> 01:03:24,858
I'm scared.

666
01:03:25,257 --> 01:03:26,668
Yeah, me too.

667
01:03:27,457 --> 01:03:29,027
But you're gonna get through it.

668
01:03:30,137 --> 01:03:31,627
You're one of us now.

669
01:03:32,217 --> 01:03:34,616
This is yours. Put that on.

670
01:03:34,617 --> 01:03:36,460
Now, I'm counting on you, kiddo.

671
01:03:37,017 --> 01:03:38,016
Okay...

672
01:03:38,017 --> 01:03:40,384
Good man. All right. Let's go.

673
01:03:44,617 --> 01:03:46,858
There you go, kiddo.
I'm gonna push you on up, okay?

674
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:51,701
I'll see you on the other side.

675
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:56,616
Now, keep movin'.

676
01:03:56,617 --> 01:03:58,346
Sparkplug is on his way up.

677
01:04:00,577 --> 01:04:03,786
Oh, Jacobs, hold on. Connor, wait up.

678
01:05:11,057 --> 01:05:13,219
- False alarm. Go.
- Okay.

679
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:17,347
He's coming out, Jacobs.

680
01:05:38,897 --> 01:05:41,343
Hold your position.
Hostiles in the area.

681
01:05:51,457 --> 01:05:53,425
Go, go, go! It's clear.

682
01:05:54,377 --> 01:05:56,141
CIB-1. Going in.

683
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:14,218
You Okay?

684
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:20,658
Coming out.

685
01:06:26,937 --> 01:06:29,668
Hostile moving toward the ledge.
Hustle up.

686
01:06:43,017 --> 01:06:44,860
Sparkplug received.

687
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,827
Good job, Banning.

688
01:06:49,457 --> 01:06:51,983
Now, let's see
if we can get the president out.

689
01:06:52,817 --> 01:06:54,057
Roger that.

690
01:06:57,457 --> 01:07:02,463
I want to reassure all Americans
and everyone around the world

691
01:07:04,057 --> 01:07:05,976
that despite today's events

692
01:07:05,977 --> 01:07:08,981
our government remains 100% functional.

693
01:07:09,737 --> 01:07:12,547
We know that the president is alive.

694
01:07:13,577 --> 01:07:18,265
To our friends, we are grateful
for your loyalty and support.

695
01:07:19,137 --> 01:07:22,107
As a nation,
we are never stronger than when tested.

696
01:07:22,577 --> 01:07:25,706
We will remain united and strong.

697
01:07:26,297 --> 01:07:28,416
God bless you all

698
01:07:28,417 --> 01:07:31,023
and God bless
these United States of America.

699
01:07:50,577 --> 01:07:54,946
Okay, asshole.
Yo. Hey. Who's running the show?

700
01:07:57,257 --> 01:07:58,747
Oh, you speak English?

701
01:07:59,377 --> 01:08:01,220
They teach you that where you come from?

702
01:08:01,937 --> 01:08:03,859
'Cause you know what they teach me?

703
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,747
Is how to extract information
from people like you.

704
01:08:15,457 --> 01:08:16,936
That's funny, huh?

705
01:08:16,937 --> 01:08:18,780
No, it's funny. I know. I get it.

706
01:08:32,937 --> 01:08:36,100
Yeah. I guess I'm a little rusty.

707
01:08:38,097 --> 01:08:39,902
I liked your friend though.

708
01:08:39,903 --> 01:08:41,422
He seems like a funny guy.

709
01:08:42,777 --> 01:08:44,347
What's your leader's name?

710
01:08:44,897 --> 01:08:46,547
Oh, I'm sorry. Here.

711
01:08:47,777 --> 01:08:49,017
How many men do you have?

712
01:08:53,177 --> 01:08:54,667
In English.

713
01:08:55,897 --> 01:08:57,816
His name is Yeonsak Kang.

714
01:08:57,817 --> 01:08:59,056
He's the head of the KUF.

715
01:08:59,057 --> 01:09:01,025
The paramilitary organization?

716
01:09:01,026 --> 01:09:02,462
No surprises there.

717
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:05,622
40 commandos breached the gate
and 28 are left.

718
01:09:05,623 --> 01:09:07,699
How do we know
we can trust the information?

719
01:09:08,137 --> 01:09:09,980
I just asked them nicely.

720
01:09:11,537 --> 01:09:12,816
Kang Yeonsak?

721
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:15,702
Sir, this is one of the most
wanted terrorists in the world.

722
01:09:15,703 --> 01:09:18,902
He was brought across the DMZ as a child
after his father was executed

723
01:09:18,903 --> 01:09:21,216
for crimes against
the North Korean state.

724
01:09:21,217 --> 01:09:22,264
While they were crossing the border,

725
01:09:22,265 --> 01:09:24,418
his mother was killed
by an American landmine.

726
01:09:24,419 --> 01:09:28,216
This guy masterminded the 2004 bombing
of the British Embassy in Seoul.

727
01:09:28,217 --> 01:09:31,936
And he funneled Pyongyang uranium
enrichment technology from Pakistan.

728
01:09:31,937 --> 01:09:33,905
He's never before been
photographed or identified

729
01:09:33,906 --> 01:09:36,216
by any Western intelligence agency.

730
01:09:36,217 --> 01:09:38,297
Well, Jesus Christ,
nobody ever thought to look for him

731
01:09:38,298 --> 01:09:39,423
inside the South Korean government.

732
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:42,227
Look, I don't care who he is.
With a force that size

733
01:09:42,228 --> 01:09:44,576
I have men who can sweep
him up in short order.

734
01:09:44,577 --> 01:09:46,864
Sir, this is not going to be a cakewalk.

735
01:09:47,297 --> 01:09:49,740
These sons of bitches
are pretty fucking tough.

736
01:09:49,741 --> 01:09:52,260
I've got the toughest fuckin' guys
in the world.

737
01:09:52,261 --> 01:09:54,381
What we need to know is
how to get into that bunker.

738
01:09:54,382 --> 01:09:57,619
Once those blast doors close, you don't.
It's nuclear hardened.

739
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,901
Now, there used to be some old tunnels,
but they were sealed up years ago.

740
01:10:00,902 --> 01:10:03,628
Sir, your men need to know
what the hell they're dropping into.

741
01:10:03,629 --> 01:10:06,780
Do not launch anything
until I do some recon.

742
01:10:40,377 --> 01:10:45,065
Agent Banning. Yes, I know who you are.

743
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:49,141
Welcome to my house.

744
01:10:54,897 --> 01:10:56,819
Hey, asshole. What took you so long?

745
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,138
You're the one that
let the first lady die, no?

746
01:11:00,817 --> 01:11:02,626
And soon, the president.

747
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:05,458
Failure seems to be a habit with you.

748
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:06,947
Yeah, well...

749
01:11:07,737 --> 01:11:11,219
Maybe I owe you for giving me the chance
for making up for that today.

750
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:14,696
I admire you
for acknowledging your failure.

751
01:11:14,697 --> 01:11:16,301
But there's no going back.

752
01:11:16,302 --> 01:11:19,816
Nothing you try and do here
tonight can atone.

753
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,228
Yeah, maybe not.

754
01:11:21,937 --> 01:11:25,225
But I reckon fucking your shit up
will be a pretty good start.

755
01:11:25,226 --> 01:11:30,223
You may wanna take a headcount.
The bodies are piling up.

756
01:11:32,457 --> 01:11:34,858
I have more than enough men
to finish the mission.

757
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:37,822
Oh, and by the way,
if you're looking for Connor...

758
01:11:37,823 --> 01:11:39,899
he's on his way to the baseball game.

759
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:44,260
How's your wife, Michael?

760
01:11:45,017 --> 01:11:47,861
Leah. She's a nurse.

761
01:11:48,297 --> 01:11:49,896
Saves lives.

762
01:11:49,897 --> 01:11:52,059
Too bad she will not save yours.

763
01:11:52,777 --> 01:11:54,416
You know what?

764
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:57,023
Why don't you and I
play a game of fuck off?

765
01:11:57,537 --> 01:11:59,027
You go first.

766
01:12:00,977 --> 01:12:02,058
Go kill him.

767
01:12:14,617 --> 01:12:15,664
Enough!

768
01:12:17,297 --> 01:12:18,344
Enough!

769
01:12:36,257 --> 01:12:37,543
Madam Secretary.

770
01:12:39,377 --> 01:12:41,061
Your Cerberus code.

771
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,097
No!

772
01:12:47,817 --> 01:12:48,784
Ruth!

773
01:12:53,657 --> 01:12:54,783
Your code!

774
01:12:55,857 --> 01:12:57,736
You'll have to kill me.

775
01:12:57,737 --> 01:12:59,182
As you wish.

776
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:09,542
There's a saying...

777
01:13:10,794 --> 01:13:11,794
in Korea.

778
01:13:17,537 --> 01:13:19,422
Seeing something a 100 times...

779
01:13:19,423 --> 01:13:21,545
is not as good as living it once.

780
01:13:23,657 --> 01:13:24,988
Fuck you.

781
01:13:26,257 --> 01:13:27,304
Stop!

782
01:13:27,857 --> 01:13:29,336
Enough!

783
01:13:29,337 --> 01:13:30,941
Enough! Stop!

784
01:13:33,177 --> 01:13:34,144
Enough!

785
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:46,428
Give it to him, Ruth.

786
01:13:47,017 --> 01:13:48,336
It doesn't matter.

787
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:50,021
And he won't get mine.

788
01:13:55,537 --> 01:13:56,379
Ruth.

789
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,143
Give it to him!

790
01:14:04,177 --> 01:14:05,861
That's an order, Ruth.

791
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:07,543
Sir...

792
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:09,947
Give it him, Ruth.

793
01:14:12,177 --> 01:14:13,622
Yes, sir.

794
01:14:15,737 --> 01:14:19,576
Echo-Mike...

795
01:14:19,577 --> 01:14:24,185
6-0-2-8...

796
01:14:25,457 --> 01:14:27,937
5, sir.

797
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:39,982
Get your fucking hands off of me!

798
01:14:42,697 --> 01:14:46,702
Sir, NORAD reports that the second
Cerberus code has been entered.

799
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:53,418
My God.

800
01:15:06,217 --> 01:15:09,376
- Mike! Mike, Mike, it's me.
- Dave?

801
01:15:09,377 --> 01:15:10,862
You scared the shit out of me.

802
01:15:10,863 --> 01:15:12,096
Jesus, what the fuck?

803
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:12,903
Yeah, just put that thing down.

804
01:15:12,904 --> 01:15:14,581
I almost blew your
fucking brains out, man.

805
01:15:14,582 --> 01:15:15,780
What are you doing here?

806
01:15:15,781 --> 01:15:17,699
I was with the South Korean delegation.

807
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,736
What the fuck are you doing here?

808
01:15:19,737 --> 01:15:21,102
I thought you were working
at the Treasury.

809
01:15:21,103 --> 01:15:22,256
Yeah, I am.

810
01:15:22,257 --> 01:15:24,305
Believe it or not,
I came in through the front door.

811
01:15:25,777 --> 01:15:29,384
Oh, fuck, Mike.

812
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,899
I saw my life flash in front of me.

813
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,696
Look at my hand. Fucker's shakin'.

814
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,016
Jesus Christ.

815
01:15:36,017 --> 01:15:37,380
It's good to see you, buddy.

816
01:15:37,381 --> 01:15:39,061
You got a funny way of showing it.

817
01:15:43,257 --> 01:15:44,543
Is the president okay?

818
01:15:44,544 --> 01:15:45,868
He's alive for now.

819
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:49,382
They got him in the bunker.

820
01:15:50,857 --> 01:15:52,380
It's a fucking shit show, huh?

821
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,708
Yeah, that's for sure.

822
01:15:56,017 --> 01:15:57,348
Roma make it?

823
01:15:59,657 --> 01:16:00,943
Fuck.

824
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,388
We gotta keep movin'.

825
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:10,619
- You got a plan, Mike?
- Yeah.

826
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,346
But it hasn't worked out so far.

827
01:16:14,457 --> 01:16:16,744
Fuckin' Mike. You always were a hardass.

828
01:16:16,745 --> 01:16:18,227
You never change.

829
01:16:21,217 --> 01:16:22,423
Hey, Dave.

830
01:16:23,177 --> 01:16:26,738
This place is getting me rattled, man.
I can't think straight.

831
01:16:27,537 --> 01:16:28,743
You Okay?

832
01:16:29,617 --> 01:16:32,826
No. Not for real.

833
01:16:33,457 --> 01:16:35,744
This fucking Kang, man. He's crazy.

834
01:16:38,017 --> 01:16:39,428
How do you know his name?

835
01:16:45,897 --> 01:16:48,468
Hey, Mike, do you remember that time
in New York?

836
01:17:44,817 --> 01:17:45,898
Dave.

837
01:17:48,137 --> 01:17:49,468
Why'd you do it?

838
01:17:50,777 --> 01:17:52,586
Fuck, Mike.

839
01:17:54,097 --> 01:17:55,258
Fuck.

840
01:17:57,817 --> 01:17:59,660
I lost my way.

841
01:18:04,257 --> 01:18:06,021
You can make up for it now.

842
01:18:09,097 --> 01:18:10,747
Tell Kang I'm dead.

843
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:14,060
You'll help me save the president.

844
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:21,944
Kang. It's Forbes.

845
01:18:23,457 --> 01:18:27,940
I got him. All clear.

846
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:31,138
Good.

847
01:18:44,977 --> 01:18:46,058
Ruth.

848
01:18:47,257 --> 01:18:49,863
Mr. President, sir?

849
01:18:53,177 --> 01:18:54,338
Rough day.

850
01:18:55,017 --> 01:18:56,462
Could be worse.

851
01:18:57,817 --> 01:18:59,581
How's my hair?

852
01:19:01,457 --> 01:19:03,425
Not a strand out of place.

853
01:19:11,297 --> 01:19:12,628
Any regrets?

854
01:19:12,897 --> 01:19:13,898
None.

855
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:16,857
You?

856
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:20,423
A few.

857
01:19:20,897 --> 01:19:22,467
Like running for president.

858
01:19:24,457 --> 01:19:27,222
The office is lucky to have you, sir.

859
01:19:28,337 --> 01:19:31,022
We all may meet our maker today...

860
01:19:33,057 --> 01:19:37,062
but the one thing
I do not want on my tombstone...

861
01:19:38,377 --> 01:19:40,778
"She Went Down Without a Fight."

862
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:48,027
No danger of that.

863
01:19:49,977 --> 01:19:51,342
Pull up your satellite feed.

864
01:19:52,017 --> 01:19:53,303
Give me eyes on.

865
01:19:55,017 --> 01:19:57,827
Looks like there's only four sentries
on the roof.

866
01:19:58,257 --> 01:19:59,939
With the Air Defense grid gone,

867
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:01,905
they're vulnerable
to an aerial insertion.

868
01:20:03,217 --> 01:20:05,458
Wait. Let me get there first
and check it out.

869
01:20:06,777 --> 01:20:08,136
We're not waiting.

870
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:10,026
We have to secure Cerberus.

871
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:11,828
Oh, fuck.

872
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,860
Send in the SEALS, General.

873
01:20:15,537 --> 01:20:16,868
We're going through the roof.

874
01:20:25,577 --> 01:20:27,306
Command, Tiger Flight inbound.

875
01:20:29,857 --> 01:20:31,268
Tiger Team, stand by.

876
01:20:34,137 --> 01:20:35,899
The assault team is on the way.

877
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,183
About fucking time.

878
01:20:38,297 --> 01:20:39,981
Yes, sir. Copy.

879
01:20:56,777 --> 01:20:59,348
Command,
Tiger Flight's three minutes out.

880
01:20:59,349 --> 01:21:00,862
Team, go green.

881
01:21:01,337 --> 01:21:02,259
Go green.

882
01:21:08,377 --> 01:21:09,026
Cho.

883
01:21:44,937 --> 01:21:48,100
60 seconds to target.
I want a clean deployment.

884
01:22:11,097 --> 01:22:11,859
Fuck.

885
01:22:12,617 --> 01:22:13,664
Tell them to hold.

886
01:22:14,177 --> 01:22:15,906
We aren't holding shit!

887
01:22:17,017 --> 01:22:20,096
Jacobs. You've gotta abort his mission.

888
01:22:20,097 --> 01:22:21,877
They've got the Hydra Six!

889
01:22:21,897 --> 01:22:22,816
What's that?

890
01:22:22,817 --> 01:22:25,056
Next generation weaponry. Ours.

891
01:22:25,057 --> 01:22:27,219
How the hell would they get that?

892
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,299
It doesn't matter.
We'll take it out.

893
01:22:29,937 --> 01:22:31,905
I said abort this fucking mission!

894
01:22:32,417 --> 01:22:34,339
Let's go get our goddamn house back,
Captain.

895
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:36,704
Tiger Two, Tiger Three,
you're cleared hot.

896
01:22:36,705 --> 01:22:37,896
Tiger Two, roger.

897
01:22:37,897 --> 01:22:39,180
Tiger Three, roger.

898
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:42,147
All birds, be on the lookout
for possible advanced weaponry.

899
01:22:58,257 --> 01:22:59,782
Approaching rooftop.

900
01:23:02,617 --> 01:23:04,142
Negative on the four sentries.

901
01:23:04,537 --> 01:23:05,823
Tiger Flight's on station.

902
01:23:06,417 --> 01:23:07,384
We got 'em.

903
01:23:08,297 --> 01:23:09,423
Go, go, go!

904
01:23:09,857 --> 01:23:11,461
Fast ropes deployed.

905
01:23:13,977 --> 01:23:16,378
We have a radar locked sourced
from target.

906
01:23:17,937 --> 01:23:19,699
Tiger Two's taking fire
from the rooftop!

907
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,182
Tiger Team, go combat flight.

908
01:23:21,183 --> 01:23:23,019
Tiger Two's hit.He's going down.

909
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,343
Tiger Two going down hard.

910
01:23:24,344 --> 01:23:25,418
Tiger Two's hit.

911
01:23:26,257 --> 01:23:27,301
Evasive, evasive.

912
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:28,583
Take out that target.

913
01:23:29,177 --> 01:23:30,622
Concentrate fire on that rooftop.

914
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:34,302
Tiger Three, fly behind the target.

915
01:23:34,303 --> 01:23:35,660
Tiger Four, adjust approach!

916
01:23:35,661 --> 01:23:37,466
Head northwest and flank from there!

917
01:23:39,217 --> 01:23:42,618
Tiger Five and Six, switch to Formation
Charlie and take out that gun!

918
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:43,982
Damn it, drop altitude!

919
01:23:45,857 --> 01:23:47,461
Tiger One gunner just got hit!

920
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:56,901
Watch your three. Watch your three.

921
01:23:57,297 --> 01:23:58,264
Taking fire.

922
01:23:58,657 --> 01:23:59,943
- Hold on!
- We're getting hit!

923
01:24:06,057 --> 01:24:07,218
Tiger Six is down!

924
01:24:10,937 --> 01:24:12,098
Tiger Five taking...

925
01:24:15,137 --> 01:24:16,627
Tiger Five's gone down.

926
01:24:18,977 --> 01:24:21,344
Reset formation. Tiger One taking lead.

927
01:24:21,345 --> 01:24:22,384
Roger that.

928
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:31,418
We need backup!

929
01:24:32,337 --> 01:24:33,179
They're chewing us up!

930
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:34,902
Engaging Target. Provide cover.

931
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,945
All remaining Blackhawks,
provide air cover.

932
01:24:44,377 --> 01:24:46,823
Two birds up. Only two birds remain.

933
01:24:46,824 --> 01:24:47,976
Abort! Abort!

934
01:24:47,977 --> 01:24:49,100
Pull out. Clear the area.

935
01:24:49,101 --> 01:24:50,622
Roger! Clearing the area!

936
01:24:53,377 --> 01:24:55,266
Tiger One is hit! Losing control!

937
01:24:59,457 --> 01:25:02,779
Tail rotor failure.
Mayday, mayday! We're going down!

938
01:25:32,657 --> 01:25:34,341
Five out of six birds are down.

939
01:25:34,937 --> 01:25:36,587
Requesting QRT.

940
01:25:38,417 --> 01:25:40,465
Permission to launch second squadron.

941
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:42,776
Negative, negative.

942
01:25:42,777 --> 01:25:43,824
We don't have any intel about

943
01:25:43,825 --> 01:25:45,899
what other surprises
they could have for us.

944
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:49,145
Return to base. Return to base. Over.

945
01:25:49,537 --> 01:25:50,459
Roger that.

946
01:25:56,257 --> 01:26:00,228
Banning, are you there? Banning!

947
01:26:04,257 --> 01:26:08,176
Half the White House is just gone.

948
01:26:08,177 --> 01:26:11,096
The residence, the roof,
all destroyed...

949
01:26:11,097 --> 01:26:13,941
and the remainder of
the historic building now trashed.

950
01:26:15,697 --> 01:26:16,823
Speaker Trumbull,

951
01:26:17,817 --> 01:26:20,548
that was a very foolish undertaking.

952
01:26:32,257 --> 01:26:34,100
Your president is next.

953
01:26:34,617 --> 01:26:37,905
You now have one hour
to recall the Seventh Fleet

954
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,336
and your troops.

955
01:26:39,337 --> 01:26:42,625
Once you do so,
I want a helicopter on the North Lawn

956
01:26:42,626 --> 01:26:43,903
fueled and ready.

957
01:26:44,377 --> 01:26:45,788
60 minutes.

958
01:27:05,337 --> 01:27:06,179
Fuck.

959
01:27:07,137 --> 01:27:08,104
It's Banning.

960
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:09,863
Patch him through.

961
01:27:10,217 --> 01:27:11,662
- Mike?
- Yeah.

962
01:27:12,537 --> 01:27:14,821
We've been trying to reach you, son.
Are you okay?

963
01:27:14,822 --> 01:27:18,538
Mr. Speaker, sir,
if we ever get out of this shit storm...

964
01:27:19,177 --> 01:27:21,179
you can hold me for insubordination.

965
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:25,183
But your team needs
some serious fucking help.

966
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:27,259
This is General Clegg,
Army Chief of Staff.

967
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,816
I am ordering you to stand down.

968
01:27:29,817 --> 01:27:31,626
Remove your only eyes and ears
from the ground.

969
01:27:31,627 --> 01:27:32,820
That's fucking brilliant.

970
01:27:32,821 --> 01:27:35,661
We need to pull you out of there
before we lose another hostage!

971
01:27:35,662 --> 01:27:37,896
I am giving you a direct order.

972
01:27:37,897 --> 01:27:41,096
Newsflash, asshole.
I don't work for you.

973
01:27:41,097 --> 01:27:44,336
General Clegg.
I'm the Commander-in-Chief.

974
01:27:44,337 --> 01:27:47,216
If I didn't absolutely need you,
I would relieve you right now.

975
01:27:47,217 --> 01:27:48,707
- I will not let this asshole
- General.

976
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:50,267
- Blow up America, sir!
- I don't wanna here another word...

977
01:27:50,268 --> 01:27:52,578
out of you unless I ask you a question!

978
01:27:57,697 --> 01:27:58,664
Sir.

979
01:27:59,257 --> 01:28:00,463
Mr. Banning.

980
01:28:01,697 --> 01:28:03,142
Mr. Banning, are you there?

981
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:06,788
Yes, sir. What's the plan?

982
01:28:08,377 --> 01:28:12,699
We're recalling the Seventh Fleet
pulling our troops back from the DMZ

983
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,299
and giving them the helicopter.

984
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:18,380
Sir, you cannot do that.
You cannot give this guy what he wants.

985
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:20,538
I've dealt with
these types of men before.

986
01:28:20,539 --> 01:28:22,661
Give me some time. Let me flush him out.

987
01:28:22,662 --> 01:28:26,623
We are talking about the safety
of the President of the United States!

988
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,938
We're talking about a hell of
a lot more than that, sir.

989
01:28:33,577 --> 01:28:36,979
With all due respect,
you're acting president now.

990
01:28:37,857 --> 01:28:39,780
And I'm the best hope you've got.

991
01:28:42,057 --> 01:28:44,185
Okay, Mike. You've got 30 minutes.

992
01:28:49,337 --> 01:28:51,226
Leah, call for you on the landline.

993
01:28:51,227 --> 01:28:52,548
The emergency line.

994
01:28:56,417 --> 01:28:58,021
Can you make sure he gets some morphine?

995
01:28:58,022 --> 01:28:58,825
Yes.

996
01:29:02,137 --> 01:29:03,024
Mike?

997
01:29:03,537 --> 01:29:05,585
Hey. I was just checking in.

998
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:09,458
Babe. How's your day been?

999
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:12,542
Yeah, it's been busy.

1000
01:29:13,457 --> 01:29:15,107
It's good, you know.

1001
01:29:16,577 --> 01:29:17,908
How 'bout you?

1002
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,304
Yeah. Busy.

1003
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:23,668
Hey, you okay?

1004
01:29:24,137 --> 01:29:27,619
Yeah, I just, I've, I've had to stay
a little later than I expected.

1005
01:29:28,857 --> 01:29:30,143
Yeah, me too.

1006
01:29:32,537 --> 01:29:34,744
You're gonna come home tonight, right?

1007
01:29:35,137 --> 01:29:36,976
Yeah. Sure.

1008
01:29:36,977 --> 01:29:38,741
We got a date, remember?

1009
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:40,868
Hey, I gotta go.

1010
01:29:41,177 --> 01:29:44,784
You know, this, uh,
paperwork's piling up.

1011
01:29:45,257 --> 01:29:46,383
Okay.

1012
01:29:49,697 --> 01:29:50,744
I love you.

1013
01:30:11,577 --> 01:30:12,942
What's the matter, Kang?

1014
01:30:13,337 --> 01:30:15,101
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1015
01:30:15,697 --> 01:30:18,428
I guess you don't know
who you can trust, huh?

1016
01:30:18,429 --> 01:30:19,576
It's over.

1017
01:30:19,577 --> 01:30:23,376
No more televised executions.
No chopper.

1018
01:30:23,377 --> 01:30:24,979
No more negotiating with you

1019
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:27,947
and the United People's Front
of Who Gives a Fuck.

1020
01:30:28,777 --> 01:30:30,905
I will send the president out...

1021
01:30:30,906 --> 01:30:32,816
one piece at a time.

1022
01:30:32,817 --> 01:30:34,023
It won't matter.

1023
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:36,541
Because whatever you think
you accomplished

1024
01:30:36,542 --> 01:30:38,301
you won't be alive to see it.

1025
01:30:39,897 --> 01:30:41,183
Shut him down.

1026
01:30:41,657 --> 01:30:44,024
Ah, you're not shutting me down, Kang.

1027
01:30:44,025 --> 01:30:45,816
I'm here to stay.

1028
01:30:45,817 --> 01:30:47,376
I underestimated you.

1029
01:30:47,377 --> 01:30:49,096
It will not happen again.

1030
01:30:49,097 --> 01:30:50,456
There is no again.

1031
01:30:50,457 --> 01:30:54,064
You're gonna die down there alone
cut off from the rest of the world.

1032
01:30:54,065 --> 01:30:57,696
My advice?
Save the last bullet for yourself.

1033
01:30:57,697 --> 01:30:59,216
'Cause if you don't...

1034
01:30:59,217 --> 01:31:01,743
I'm gonna stick my knife
through your brain.

1035
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:03,376
But don't worry.

1036
01:31:03,377 --> 01:31:06,023
I'm gonna leak the photos
of your body to the press.

1037
01:31:06,024 --> 01:31:08,338
You know, 'cause I know you
like that kind of shit.

1038
01:31:27,297 --> 01:31:28,139
Her!

1039
01:31:47,017 --> 01:31:49,696
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

1040
01:31:49,697 --> 01:31:54,419
of the United States of America!

1041
01:32:08,897 --> 01:32:10,945
Your leader is out of his mind.

1042
01:32:15,297 --> 01:32:17,538
You fucking idiot!

1043
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:24,344
Go.

1044
01:32:24,897 --> 01:32:26,137
Walk.

1045
01:32:26,937 --> 01:32:28,098
Move!

1046
01:32:54,617 --> 01:32:57,223
Sir, there's movement
in front of the White House.

1047
01:32:57,224 --> 01:32:58,616
Ours or theirs?

1048
01:32:58,617 --> 01:33:00,540
Looks like Secretary McMillan, sir.

1049
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,904
- Any bulges, wires?
- Negative.

1050
01:33:08,697 --> 01:33:11,223
Sir, ground reports activity
at the White House.

1051
01:33:11,737 --> 01:33:13,296
- Is that?
- McMillan.

1052
01:33:13,297 --> 01:33:16,983
Get a team out there now.
And another to cover! Go!

1053
01:33:20,577 --> 01:33:24,468
It looks like Secretary McMillan.
Yeah, yes, it is.

1054
01:33:46,017 --> 01:33:46,984
Yes!

1055
01:34:02,297 --> 01:34:03,219
Mike?

1056
01:34:05,577 --> 01:34:06,456
Hey.

1057
01:34:06,457 --> 01:34:08,778
He got away. He's back in the bunker.

1058
01:34:09,617 --> 01:34:12,382
You gave it a good shot, Mike.
You saved McMillan.

1059
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:17,221
North and South Korean military
forces are on high alert

1060
01:34:17,222 --> 01:34:20,300
in response to rumors
of an impending American

1061
01:34:20,301 --> 01:34:22,056
pull-out from the DMZ.

1062
01:34:22,057 --> 01:34:25,299
India, China and Russia
have declared a state of emergency

1063
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,136
and have mobilized military forces.

1064
01:34:27,137 --> 01:34:27,979
In the Middle East though,

1065
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:31,182
the response to the attack
on the White House is jubilant.

1066
01:34:31,183 --> 01:34:33,656
Crowds of thousands
are celebrating in the streets

1067
01:34:33,657 --> 01:34:35,419
and American flags are burning.

1068
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,943
Created by a U.S. departure
could spark

1069
01:34:37,944 --> 01:34:42,896
an immediate and full-scale conflict
and that any conventional war

1070
01:34:42,897 --> 01:34:45,582
in this heavily-armed corner
of the world

1071
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:50,139
could easily escalate
into nuclear confrontation.

1072
01:34:50,417 --> 01:34:51,543
The hour's up.

1073
01:34:52,337 --> 01:34:53,941
Send the helicopter.

1074
01:34:55,697 --> 01:34:57,426
Le's recall the Seventh Fleet.

1075
01:34:59,337 --> 01:35:01,536
Pull the troops out of the DMZ.

1076
01:35:01,537 --> 01:35:03,380
We just lost South Korea.

1077
01:35:05,697 --> 01:35:07,778
Our Pentagon sources are now saying

1078
01:35:07,779 --> 01:35:08,938
that U.S. ground troops

1079
01:35:08,939 --> 01:35:11,668
have been given the order
to withdraw from Korea

1080
01:35:11,669 --> 01:35:14,056
for the first time in 60 years.

1081
01:35:14,057 --> 01:35:16,660
We're also hearing reports
that the U.S.'s Seventh Fleet

1082
01:35:16,661 --> 01:35:19,260
has been directed to pull back
in the region.

1083
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:20,663
Although unconfirmed,

1084
01:35:20,664 --> 01:35:23,782
this historic turn of events
seems to be motivated

1085
01:35:23,783 --> 01:35:26,141
by today's attack on the White House

1086
01:35:26,142 --> 01:35:28,660
which began
as the Prime Minister of Korea

1087
01:35:28,661 --> 01:35:30,739
was meeting with President Asher.

1088
01:35:55,297 --> 01:35:56,219
What are they doing?

1089
01:36:33,577 --> 01:36:35,978
Mike. We have to get Kang
and the president out

1090
01:36:35,979 --> 01:36:37,979
in the open and take out our best shot.

1091
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:39,058
Copy that, sir.

1092
01:36:53,457 --> 01:36:55,300
Bravo Team is in position.

1093
01:36:58,457 --> 01:37:01,188
Sir, we are ready.
All units are in position.

1094
01:37:08,617 --> 01:37:09,903
Here come the hostages.

1095
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,266
We count 11 targets, sir.

1096
01:37:16,777 --> 01:37:18,459
One of them's gotta be the president.

1097
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:19,618
That's their ticket out.

1098
01:37:24,697 --> 01:37:26,779
Hercules Six in position.

1099
01:37:27,217 --> 01:37:28,787
Can you I.D. the president?

1100
01:37:31,777 --> 01:37:32,824
Negative.

1101
01:37:33,257 --> 01:37:34,782
Can you I.D. Kang?

1102
01:37:37,057 --> 01:37:37,936
Negative.

1103
01:37:37,937 --> 01:37:39,223
Targets unclear.

1104
01:37:41,417 --> 01:37:43,142
Sir, all ground units are in position.

1105
01:37:43,143 --> 01:37:45,299
Do we have the go-ahead to take them?

1106
01:37:55,017 --> 01:37:56,701
If we're gonna go, we gotta go now, sir.

1107
01:38:00,937 --> 01:38:02,427
Do we have the go-ahead, sir?

1108
01:38:05,697 --> 01:38:08,348
No. Too risky.
They could kill the president.

1109
01:38:10,817 --> 01:38:11,579
Yes, sir.

1110
01:38:12,177 --> 01:38:14,217
It's okay.
We have a tracking device on the chopper.

1111
01:38:27,417 --> 01:38:30,128
Holy shit. What was that? Was that us?

1112
01:38:30,217 --> 01:38:32,345
Negative, negative. That wasn't us.

1113
01:38:40,617 --> 01:38:44,056
Though it is not confirmed yet,
President Asher

1114
01:38:44,057 --> 01:38:45,942
is believed to have been
among those killed

1115
01:38:45,943 --> 01:38:48,018
when the Blackhawk helicopter went down

1116
01:38:48,019 --> 01:38:50,258
in flames on the White House North Lawn.

1117
01:38:51,657 --> 01:38:54,659
And certainly, today's events
will be recorded in history

1118
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:57,422
- as one of this country's darkest hours.
- Oh, my God.

1119
01:39:00,657 --> 01:39:02,182
The president's gone.

1120
01:39:20,897 --> 01:39:21,944
Mike?

1121
01:39:22,537 --> 01:39:23,948
What the hell just happened?

1122
01:39:25,057 --> 01:39:26,661
I'm sorry to report...

1123
01:39:28,177 --> 01:39:30,464
the president was on that helicopter.

1124
01:39:31,177 --> 01:39:32,463
And Kang?

1125
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,056
Kang killed himself.

1126
01:39:35,057 --> 01:39:36,946
And all the other hostages.

1127
01:39:38,817 --> 01:39:43,141
Wait. This doesn't add up.

1128
01:39:44,297 --> 01:39:45,896
It doesn't make sense.

1129
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:47,342
What doesn't make sense?

1130
01:39:48,737 --> 01:39:50,818
Kang would not go out like that, sir.

1131
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:52,182
That's not who he is.

1132
01:39:54,017 --> 01:39:56,141
I think he's still in the bunker.

1133
01:39:56,142 --> 01:39:58,708
And he has the president.
He's gonna try and slip away.

1134
01:39:59,057 --> 01:40:01,059
If Kang is still on the premises
with the president,

1135
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:02,866
you can't let him leave.

1136
01:40:04,377 --> 01:40:05,458
He won't.

1137
01:40:07,337 --> 01:40:10,068
Huh? Who the hell does that?

1138
01:40:11,377 --> 01:40:12,344
Enough!

1139
01:40:15,977 --> 01:40:18,576
I read your Bible, Mr. President.

1140
01:40:18,577 --> 01:40:21,736
It says, the wages of sin is death.

1141
01:40:21,737 --> 01:40:23,387
You better keep that in mind.

1142
01:40:31,937 --> 01:40:32,745
What are you doing?

1143
01:40:32,746 --> 01:40:34,656
Cerberus has been activated.

1144
01:40:34,657 --> 01:40:36,386
We haven't launched any missiles yet.

1145
01:40:38,137 --> 01:40:39,946
I don't need to launch them.

1146
01:40:40,377 --> 01:40:43,023
The explosive force
within each hardened silo

1147
01:40:43,024 --> 01:40:44,587
will detonate the missiles.

1148
01:40:44,977 --> 01:40:47,423
Tens of millions of Americans
will perish.

1149
01:40:48,137 --> 01:40:51,983
Your country will be a
cold, dark nuclear wasteland.

1150
01:40:54,857 --> 01:40:58,657
Now, too, America shall know
suffering and famine.

1151
01:41:00,897 --> 01:41:03,942
South Korean officials are saying
now that they've pulled out the reserves

1152
01:41:03,943 --> 01:41:06,861
and they're mobilizing additional
armored units in response...

1153
01:41:06,862 --> 01:41:09,456
Sir? Cerberus has been activated.

1154
01:41:09,457 --> 01:41:11,425
- What?
- NORAD confirms.

1155
01:41:12,857 --> 01:41:14,536
How did it come to this?

1156
01:41:14,537 --> 01:41:16,816
We lost Korea and now our nukes?

1157
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:18,943
- They couldn't have broken the code.
- That would be impossible.

1158
01:41:18,944 --> 01:41:21,416
They'd be on the bunker computer
for days to break three codes.

1159
01:41:21,417 --> 01:41:23,936
No, he only need to break one code.

1160
01:41:23,937 --> 01:41:26,224
But we haven't launched any missiles.

1161
01:41:29,737 --> 01:41:31,865
They're gonna detonate them
in their silos.

1162
01:41:34,537 --> 01:41:35,663
How many?

1163
01:41:38,097 --> 01:41:39,303
All of 'em.

1164
01:41:47,297 --> 01:41:49,345
He's just opened the gates of hell.

1165
01:41:53,977 --> 01:41:55,422
Time to go, Mr. President!

1166
01:42:05,297 --> 01:42:07,664
You really think you're gonna
get out of here alive?

1167
01:42:08,337 --> 01:42:10,226
The world thinks we're both dead.

1168
01:42:11,457 --> 01:42:13,346
And with you as insurance...

1169
01:44:09,937 --> 01:44:11,063
Come on, Mike.

1170
01:44:17,177 --> 01:44:19,145
Looks like you failed again, Mike.

1171
01:44:46,657 --> 01:44:47,544
Sir?

1172
01:44:48,017 --> 01:44:51,817
Sir, sir, look at me. Sir...

1173
01:44:53,897 --> 01:44:54,898
Sir.

1174
01:44:55,937 --> 01:45:00,096
Okay. It's gone through
and you've lost a little blood.

1175
01:45:00,097 --> 01:45:01,781
But I'm gonna get you outta here, okay?

1176
01:45:02,537 --> 01:45:03,823
Now, you know what to do.

1177
01:45:06,017 --> 01:45:07,223
Ben, Ben, come on!

1178
01:45:07,224 --> 01:45:09,056
- Cerberus.
- What?

1179
01:45:09,057 --> 01:45:10,582
Cerberus activated.

1180
01:45:10,977 --> 01:45:12,138
Cerberus.

1181
01:45:14,937 --> 01:45:16,268
Keep that pressed in.

1182
01:45:16,269 --> 01:45:17,702
Sir! Ben!

1183
01:45:18,177 --> 01:45:19,542
You're gonna be okay.

1184
01:45:19,543 --> 01:45:20,379
All right.

1185
01:45:29,897 --> 01:45:31,056
This is Banning.

1186
01:45:31,057 --> 01:45:33,181
I have the president.
He's hurt, but alive.

1187
01:45:33,182 --> 01:45:34,941
How do I switch this fucking thing off?

1188
01:45:35,417 --> 01:45:37,306
- Hang on.
- Deactivation code!

1189
01:45:38,977 --> 01:45:42,743
Find a control panel marked,
"Countermand."

1190
01:45:43,777 --> 01:45:44,744
Countermand.

1191
01:45:45,577 --> 01:45:46,576
Got it!

1192
01:45:46,577 --> 01:45:51,219
Flip a blue-white switch marked,
"Initiate Recall."

1193
01:45:51,777 --> 01:45:53,222
Initiate recall.

1194
01:45:53,977 --> 01:45:54,705
Okay.

1195
01:45:55,177 --> 01:45:57,896
Deactivation sequence initiated.

1196
01:45:57,897 --> 01:45:59,420
Please enter abort command.

1197
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:00,828
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

1198
01:46:01,337 --> 01:46:03,180
November. India.

1199
01:46:04,977 --> 01:46:06,136
Lima.

1200
01:46:06,137 --> 01:46:10,016
- Wait, wait. Yep.
- 5-Oscar-hotel.

1201
01:46:10,017 --> 01:46:12,776
- Oscar, hotel.
- Backslash. Niner.

1202
01:46:12,777 --> 01:46:14,825
- Backslash.
- Victor. Kilo.

1203
01:46:15,257 --> 01:46:16,656
- Hash-tag.
- What?

1204
01:46:16,657 --> 01:46:18,864
- Hash-tag.
- Shift 3!

1205
01:46:19,337 --> 01:46:20,616
Okay, fuck!

1206
01:46:20,617 --> 01:46:22,856
- Shift 3!
- Echo.

1207
01:46:22,857 --> 01:46:24,056
Sierra.

1208
01:46:24,057 --> 01:46:25,980
- Foxtrot.
- Foxtrot.

1209
01:46:26,897 --> 01:46:27,856
Is that it?

1210
01:46:27,857 --> 01:46:28,779
That's it.

1211
01:46:34,817 --> 01:46:37,343
Cerberus has been deactivated.

1212
01:46:46,977 --> 01:46:50,096
Sir. NORAD confirms...

1213
01:46:50,097 --> 01:46:51,747
Cerberus has been shut down.

1214
01:46:52,217 --> 01:46:53,343
Good.

1215
01:46:53,777 --> 01:46:56,098
Now get me Seoul and Pyongyang
on the line.

1216
01:47:25,417 --> 01:47:27,021
Are you ready, Mr. President?

1217
01:47:38,297 --> 01:47:39,344
All right.

1218
01:47:55,937 --> 01:47:57,666
Sorry about the house, sir.

1219
01:47:59,897 --> 01:48:03,219
It's okay. I believe it's insured.

1220
01:48:25,377 --> 01:48:26,947
We've lost good friends.

1221
01:48:28,937 --> 01:48:30,063
Family.

1222
01:48:31,937 --> 01:48:33,223
All good people.

1223
01:48:36,057 --> 01:48:38,344
- Heroes, every one of them.
- Dad!

1224
01:48:39,337 --> 01:48:42,147
Our hearts and prayers
go out to their families.

1225
01:48:42,897 --> 01:48:44,467
And they will be remembered.

1226
01:48:45,577 --> 01:48:47,216
Nor will we forget...

1227
01:48:47,217 --> 01:48:50,336
those who serve out of the spotlight

1228
01:48:50,337 --> 01:48:54,023
to whom we owe our highest gratitude.

1229
01:49:01,337 --> 01:49:05,183
Our foe did not come only to destroy
our things or our people.

1230
01:49:06,177 --> 01:49:08,736
They came to desecrate a way of life.

1231
01:49:08,737 --> 01:49:11,900
To foul our beliefs,
trample our freedom.

1232
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:14,863
And in this, not only did they fail...

1233
01:49:15,377 --> 01:49:18,347
they granted us the greatest gift.

1234
01:49:19,617 --> 01:49:21,460
A chance at our rebirth.

1235
01:49:23,777 --> 01:49:26,587
We will rise. Renewed.

1236
01:49:27,057 --> 01:49:29,105
Stronger and united.

1237
01:49:29,617 --> 01:49:30,948
This is our time...

1238
01:49:31,657 --> 01:49:35,946
our chance to get back
to the best of who we are.

1239
01:49:36,777 --> 01:49:39,376
To lead by example with the dignity,

1240
01:49:39,377 --> 01:49:42,142
integrity and honor
that built this country

1241
01:49:42,817 --> 01:49:45,741
and which will build it once again.

1242
01:49:46,097 --> 01:49:47,428
May God bless you.

1243
01:49:48,577 --> 01:49:51,228
And may God bless
the United States of America.
