00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,745
Come on.

3
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:54,475
Come on, mutt.
Look at that ball. All right.

4
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,849
Come on. Get that ball. Baah!

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,684
There's no problem
with that.

6
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:01,951
Oh, goddamn it.

7
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,619
If it happens,
let me know.

8
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:07,857
What the hell are you doing here?
This is not the office!

9
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,593
- This is my private time.
- Five minutes.

10
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:14,034
No! I said no Tuesday,
I said no last week,

11
00:01:14,103 --> 00:01:15,968
and I'm gonna keep saying no
till you hear me.

12
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,837
Five minutes,
Mr. Chairman.

13
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:21,035
It's all I ask. Five minutes.

14
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,843
- You want some coffee?
- No, I don't want any coffee. I want to play with my dog.

15
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:29,951
Look, I'm not asking you
to vote for it.

16
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:32,681
I know you can't.
Just release your people.

17
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,985
Let them go
the way they want.

18
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:39,620
Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act!

19
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:42,164
Invasion of privacy
is more like it.

20
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,496
You read the Post?

21
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:47,365
"This bill is not the first step
towards the surveillance society.

22
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:49,598
It is the surveillance
society. "

23
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:52,641
- Liberal hysteria.
- Listen, I'm not gonna sit in Congress...

24
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,304
and pass a law that lets the government
point a camera and a microphone...

25
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:58,313
at anything
they damn well please.

26
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:01,179
Phil

27
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,742
Look, I don't care
who bangs who,

28
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,186
what cabinet officers
get stoned.

29
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:09,748
But this is the richest, most powerful
nation on earth, and therefore the most hated.

30
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:12,420
And you and I know what
the average citizen does not:

31
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:15,055
That we are at war
24 hours of every day.

32
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:17,691
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,361
Do I have to itemize the number
of American lives we've saved...

34
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:23,928
in the past 12 months alone with
judicious use of surveillance intelligence?

35
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,532
Thomas, cut the crap.

36
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:30,409
I've got three major employers
in the Syracuse area alone...

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,971
who are gonna get
just killed by this bill.

38
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,017
I promise to get you funds
equal to...

39
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:39,919
or greater than whatever those
companies gave your last campaign.

40
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,447
I'm not talking about
campaign contributions, damn it.

41
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:46,324
I'm talking about my constituents
being out of work.

42
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:48,660
Jesus, man!
Wake up!

43
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:52,167
National security isn't the only thing
going on in this country.

44
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:56,995
God.

45
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:59,633
This conversation
is over.

46
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,009
I beg of you, Phil
Please don't.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,446
I've been there for you in the past,
haven't I? There have been times,

48
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:10,008
personal situations, when you needed
my assistance and my confidence.

49
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:14,182
Are you blackmailing me,
you ambitious shit?

50
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:18,819
I'm sorry we can't find a common ground
on this one, Congressman.

51
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:21,921
You're a good man.
People of your district are lucky...

52
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:24,057
to have you
representing them.

53
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:35,910
Come on.

54
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:33,151
Let me fight management.
Okay, I can accept that.

55
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:35,815
But this is our own
goddamned union leadership...

56
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,984
trying to railroad us into signing
some sweetheart contract.

57
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,824
Look, everybody knows...

58
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:45,354
that the mob has been controlling these
guys since as long as I can remember.

59
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,993
And now, uh...
now we got Pintero's goons...

60
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,003
down there
tuning up my people.

61
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:53,666
Well, first off, that's a Hobbs Act
violation, probably a RICO.

62
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:56,676
- Hey, thanks. Great.
- How you doing, Eddie? How's it going?

63
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:59,212
- Robert Dean.
- Tony O'Neill. Nice to meet you.

64
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,512
A Hobbs and a RICO.
Ooh, baby, don't stop.

65
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:07,520
Sounds like you guys need
a labor lawyer. What happened?

66
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:10,216
We were in Louie's
two nights ago,

67
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,987
I go to use the bathroom,
and these two fucking guidos jump me.

68
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:17,020
Uh, I prefer we use the term
"Italian-Americans. "

69
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:21,194
Eh, whatever, but they were really going
to work on me. It could've gotten serious.

70
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:25,000
- But then Larry Cash came in and he went after 'em.
- Larry Cash is in the hospital

71
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,166
with a broken jaw
and a ruptured kidney.

72
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:30,176
Is this becoming a criminal
investigation, Robert?

73
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:33,372
- Um, no, it would take years
to see that thing through.

74
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:36,383
Besides, these people have families
that are living through this every day.

75
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,752
Hey, Julie, can we send a case
of Chianti over to Larry Cash?

76
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,053
- Larry Cash?
- Yes, he's at St. Luke's.

77
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,253
And send some flowers to his wife,
Brenda. They're both in the Rolodex.

78
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:49,796
Yes, Mr. Dean.

79
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:54,025
Well, why don't you guys
just head on home?

80
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:57,799
I'm your lawyer. I'm in the process of
dealing with these guido motherfuckers.

81
00:07:57,872 --> 00:08:00,272
Pintero doesn't stand
a chance.

82
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:07,876
So, how's the trout?

83
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,577
- Tastes like fish.
- It is fish.

84
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:13,882
No, I mean it tastes like
every other fish I've ever had.

85
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:17,254
Okay.

86
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:19,793
Brill's note said that...

87
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:23,092
this is the videotape you need
to convince Pintero with.

88
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:27,225
And watch out for the F.B. I Brill says
the place is under surveillance.

89
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:31,465
- So when do I get to meet him?
- Pintero?

90
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:34,337
Brill.

91
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:36,968
Never.

92
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,171
Okay. Um...

93
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,977
wow. That's not exactly
the answer I was hoping for.

94
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,279
And what was the answer
you were hoping for?

95
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:47,913
Oh, I don't know. Soon.
Uh, definitely sooner than never.

96
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:51,117
Bobby, why do we have to
go through this every time?

97
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,524
Brill talks to me,
I talk to you.

98
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,528
That's the way
it works.

99
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,723
Well, pardon me for being
a little uncomfortable...

100
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,927
with hiring someone that
I don't know and I've never even met.

101
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,867
Then don't hire him.

102
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:09,402
$10,000.

103
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:12,173
And I'm also uncomfortable having
to carry that kind of cash around.

104
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:14,840
Well, this should lighten
your load.

105
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,010
I don't know if it's Brill's price
that's going up or your commission.

106
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:21,054
I take 15%,
as always.

107
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,215
Brill's fee varies
with risk.

108
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,623
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
using someone else.

109
00:09:25,693 --> 00:09:29,493
- What, other than Brill?
- Other than me.

110
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:32,795
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, there's nothing wrong with me.

111
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:35,165
Just, you know,
someone with whom...

112
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:38,672
you don't have quite
so complicated a history.

113
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,244
I like our history,
and I like you.

114
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,872
Tsk.
I like you too.

115
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,519
Look, I-I just want to make sure that
I'm not breaking the law in any way.

116
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:57,046
- You're not.
- And how can I be so sure?

117
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,962
Because
I wouldn't let you.

118
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:12,029
So, Mr. Pintero, the guy on the left...

119
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:15,677
is Carl Matthews,
president of Local 6650.

120
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,608
And this is Dave Early,
secretary-treasurer of the National

121
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,410
Oh, right there,
you see... you see the guy there?

122
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:24,383
That's Hugh Simic.
He administers the pension fund.

123
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:26,852
Hey, you're going to recognize
this fellow right here.

124
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:30,413
That's you.

125
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:33,255
- Am I correct, Mr. Pintero?
- That ain't me.

126
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:36,353
Let's watch a little more.

127
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:40,891
- Take a picture of this.
- Everybody say "money. "

128
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:43,163
Here comes a great shot
right here.

129
00:10:43,237 --> 00:10:45,501
Everybody say "not guilty. "

130
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,700
Right here; here it comes.

131
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:51,609
- That's not you?
- That ain't me.

132
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,207
well, you know, that's
actually really great news for me.

133
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:58,377
It lifts a huge weight
off of my shoulders.

134
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:03,049
Because the conditions of your parole
specifically forbid you from having any contact...

135
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:06,787
- of any kind with any union officials.
- I know that.

136
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:10,888
Well, I'm saying,
so hypothetically, had that been you,

137
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:13,832
I mean, you'd be headed
back to prison for...

138
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:17,200
fifteen... I don't know...
maybe twenty years... even more.

139
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:20,900
But, I don't know, that ain't you,
as you so eloquently put it.

140
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:25,412
Are you fucking with me?
Eloquently? That's not me.

141
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,382
Oh, that's not you. Well, I'm sorry
I've wasted your time, gentlemen,

142
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,509
you know, since
that's not you, um...

143
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:39,151
Oh, you know what? I'm thinking.
Maybe I'll just, you know,

144
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:41,320
run this tape past
the federal prosecutor.

145
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:44,296
You know, they have
really great VCRs down there.

146
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:47,027
Alot of times, they can see
things that we can't see.

147
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:49,865
You ain't running this
by nobody.

148
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:56,703
- What do you want?
- My clients want to vote their contract up or down...

149
00:11:56,778 --> 00:12:00,771
as they see fit, without,
shall we say, any outside influences.

150
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:03,840
Okay.
Sit down.

151
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,512
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- No, you are not fine.

152
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:10,387
Now sit your ass...
down.

153
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:24,170
I would like my clients to be able
to exercise their constitutional rights.

154
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:27,901
And if that happens, that tape will
disappear forever into my private collection,

155
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:32,878
along with the Zapruder fil
and the porno from Hitler's bunker.

156
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:35,472
You got any copies
of this thing?

157
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,575
- Absolutely.
- Who made it? You make it?

158
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,186
I'm an attorney.
I don't make videotapes.

159
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:45,658
Now you listen to me,
you fucking eggplant.

160
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:48,786
This fucking videotape
may save your clients' asses,

161
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:51,923
but you can be goddamned sure
it ain't gonna save yours.

162
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,599
Now, who made
the fucking videotape?

163
00:12:57,038 --> 00:13:00,565
- I don't know.
- How'd you get it?

164
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:04,042
Through an acquaintance.

165
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:07,842
Mr. Dean, he's got acquaintances.
Me, I got friends. I don't know.

166
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:10,406
Vic, get outside. See if they're
any acquaintances out there...

167
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:12,543
that are of
the black persuasion.

168
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,815
Carlos, why don't you
get out of that chair?

169
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:20,123
Talk to Mr. Dean.

170
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,897
Who's your fucking
acquaintance?

171
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,396
Listen to me. I wanna know
who made that videotape,

172
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:35,135
but I wanna know
in a week.

173
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:37,905
Or I'll kill ya.

174
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:43,748
Hey, smile.

175
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:46,412
- What?
- Smile for the F.B. I

176
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:56,354
- who's the brother?
- I don't know, but he doesn't look Italian to me.

177
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,094
Table Harvest to 101.
We got a blue overcoat heading east.

178
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:12,613
Give me a loose one.
See if we can get his plates.

179
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,719
I'm standing by live at
the Lockraven Reservoir right now...

180
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,691
where police and fire officials
are in the process of removing...

181
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,524
a classic Mercedes owned by
Republican congressman...

182
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:31,928
Phillip Hamersly
of Syracuse, New York.

183
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:35,490
This accident comes
at a very untimely juncture,

184
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:39,299
since the congressman was working on a
controversial piece of legislation, Dale,

185
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:42,864
opposing the Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.

186
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,208
Fire officials do tell me
that it appears the congressman...

187
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,213
was by himself
in the car.

188
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,875
We have confirmed that.
However, strangely enough,

189
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:54,352
his favorite dog, Bob,
is currently with police.

190
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:56,355
I understand there
was a history of heart problems.

191
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,448
There was, in fact,
a history of heart problems.

192
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:02,017
In fact, the congressman endured open-heart
surgery just a couple of years ago.

193
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:07,362
Homicide investigators have told me they
did find a bottle of pills in his lap.

194
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:09,800
That might mean that the congressman...
and I speculate here...

195
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:14,203
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

196
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:17,141
He leaves behind
a family of four.

197
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,440
we'll have
more details as the story develops.

198
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:54,275
I need a 10-27 on a...

199
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:57,134
brown and tan
'75 GMC Jimmy.

200
00:15:57,267 --> 00:16:00,259
D.C. Tags.
Eight, kilo,

201
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,896
six, three, nine, four.

202
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:05,304
And a 10-28
on the registered owner.

203
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:28,410
Do not give me
optimistic numbers. I hate optimism.

204
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:30,415
- Sir?
- I want to know how many votes we have in the bank...

205
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:33,247
aren't gonna change their mind
every time the wind blows.

206
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,549
Thank you.

207
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:38,386
We may have a problem
out at the lake.

208
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:42,326
This is Daniel Zavitz. He's a nature
photographer with some government grants.

209
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:46,695
One of them is for monitoring
migratory patterns of Canadian geese.

210
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:48,893
Or lack thereof.

211
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:53,166
The box is called a hide.
It contains a motion-activated...

212
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,673
digital video camera
with a compound lens.

213
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:58,472
It was aimed directly
at the boat ramp across the lake.

214
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:15,823
We need two techs with full electronic
capabilities... two humpty-dumpties.

215
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:19,160
Get Fiedler to organize it,
and call Kramer...

216
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:21,166
to get us some
ex-military cutouts.

217
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:23,498
How do I describe
the project?

218
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:28,337
Call it a training op
hosted here.

219
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:30,433
Set up a link
with the N.R.O.

220
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,173
- That's good.
- Falsify F.B. I approval

221
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:38,445
And none of this goes beyond our team.
And get that videotape.

222
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:41,248
- Of course.
- Get a wire on our bird-watcher.

223
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,240
You got it.

224
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,776
Fiedler, it's Hicks. I need
an intercept on a Daniel Leon Zavitz.

225
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:51,075
202-555-0108.

226
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:53,638
And, uh, what's
our authorization?

227
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:56,241
We're calling it a P-1 training op.
F.B. I approval

228
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,973
Kruger and Jones, sir.

229
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,131
We were with the 22nd Marine
expeditionary unit. Kramer sent us.

230
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,302
- Nice haircut.
- Thirty months in a federal penitentiary...

231
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:08,575
at Marion, Illinois, for a G.V.H.
- 1... on your gunnery sergeant... what's that about?

232
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:13,483
The guy was an asshole, sir,
and he deserved it, if you'll excuse me.

233
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:24,629
All new, designed for today.

234
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:28,895
The electric car is here.

235
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,732
A sedan for you.

236
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:33,897
I'm standing by
live at the Lockraven Reservoir...

237
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:37,136
right now, where police and fire
officials are in the process of removing...

238
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,203
a classic Mercedes owned by Republican
congressman Phillip Hamersly.

239
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,044
You may be able to see it here,
being removed in the background.

240
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:46,881
Now, fire and police officials
aren't saying much at this point.

241
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:49,979
Here's what I do know.
I have been told that the congressman...

242
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:55,221
was alone in the vehicle when this
accident happened just under an hour ago.

243
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:57,694
You may know that the congressman
suffers from a heart condition.

244
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:01,860
Homicide investigators have told me that
they did find a bottle of pills in his lap.

245
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:05,301
That might mean that the congressman...
and I speculate here...

246
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:08,636
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

247
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,973
- I am also told that there was
no one in the car...

248
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:15,412
Fuck a duck.

249
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,779
Holy shit!

250
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,341
...on the ground,
and is currently with police.

251
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,513
He's from Syracuse, New York.

252
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:27,218
The congressman was an opponent of the
Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act.

253
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:30,456
News desk.

254
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,433
Lenny, you are not going to believe
what I have in my possession.

255
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:38,299
- Zavitz. Long time.
- Lenny, I've got...

256
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:41,465
the Phil Hamersly murder
on videotape.

257
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,941
Phil Hamersly died
of a heart attack.

258
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,309
Negative. Hamersly was professionally
wasted under the direction...

259
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,044
of some anal-retentive with what looks
like a serious vitamin D deficiency.

260
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:56,646
- How did you get this tape?
- My conservation study at the lake photographed the murder.

261
00:19:56,722 --> 00:20:00,317
- You're kidding me!
- The camera was aimed straight across at the pier,

262
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:02,520
right where Phil Hamersly
was killed.

263
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:05,996
- How fast can you get that tape over here?
- I'm making a copy right now.

264
00:20:06,065 --> 00:20:08,932
Uh, Mark, I have to take this.

265
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,094
Good. Thank you.

266
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,104
Call if you need
anything.

267
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,878
Fiedler,
is this line secure?

268
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,414
- Yes, it is, sir.
- Go ahead.

269
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,609
Zavitz is speaking
to a Lenny Bloom,

270
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,811
a former anti-war activist.

271
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:30,583
He publishes a variety of left-wing
newsletters on various political subjects.

272
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:35,059
- He's taking the tape now to Bloom's offices. Over.
- Put a tap on Bloom.

273
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:39,292
- And give us a dedicated satellite for this operation.
- It's already done.

274
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:41,992
Yeah, so, Julie,
I'm gonna take the rest of the day.

275
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:45,868
Finish up my Christmas shopping.
Take my mind off things.

276
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:50,307
Hey, do chicks dig
lingerie?

277
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,367
All right. I'll see you
in the morning.

278
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:58,141
- Hi.
- Hi.

279
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,208
How you doing?

280
00:21:00,286 --> 00:21:02,584
Why, hello.

281
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:05,021
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Hey, hi.

282
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:08,686
- Uh, yes.
- Do you see something you like?

283
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:12,288
- Uh, I'm married.
- That's allowed.

284
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:14,799
Uh, um, I just...
I need... I need some,

285
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:17,358
uh, a...
a Christmas present.

286
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:20,735
- For your wife? - Yes, of-of
s- several years. We're ver... Uh, yes.

287
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:25,038
- You want some lingerie for your wife?
- Yes-Yes, I would

288
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:27,409
Do you like
Christian Dior?

289
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,347
You know, I have to be really honest
with you. Um, I'm not really...

290
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:34,645
- experienced in this.
- Get out of town!

291
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,247
L- I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean,
I'm-I'm experienced, you know, from...

292
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:40,792
- Yeah. Right.
- From a certain perspective, I-I just...

293
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,852
I don't want to come in here and,
you know, look stupid.

294
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,262
Too late.

295
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:50,325
- Yeah. What size?
- I'm sorry?

296
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:53,531
- Oh, my wife. Oh, uh, she's, um...
- Yeah.

297
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:56,200
- She's about... She's...
- Size six.

298
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,607
Yeah, right, she's, uh...
She's ab... She's, uh... she's a six.

299
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:00,771
Right. And what
about cup size?

300
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:02,746
Um...

301
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:05,340
Oh! Oh, she's
way bigger than that.

302
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:09,184
I mean, not...
I mean, not noticeably.

303
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:12,691
- Oops.
- Should have gotten her a watch.

304
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:14,759
Hello?

305
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:16,818
- It's me, Ruthie.
- Shit.

306
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:19,922
They disconnected
my phone again.

307
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:23,958
Uh, mine's not working either.
I think it's a problem with the line.

308
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:27,038
Um...

309
00:22:27,106 --> 00:22:30,371
Let me borrow some change
for the pay phone, man.

310
00:22:30,443 --> 00:22:33,378
Come on.
I gotta call Dr. Mike.

311
00:22:38,184 --> 00:22:41,119
Danny!

312
00:22:41,187 --> 00:22:46,591
Danny, I always pay you back.
Come on!

313
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:50,060
Danny!

314
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:58,163
Open the door!

315
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:00,398
Shit. Fuck.

316
00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:07,011
- Come on, man!
- Uh, one minute.

317
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,877
- I'm going.
- Come on, Danny!

318
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:15,152
Come on. Come on.

319
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:20,456
Oh, shit.

320
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,435
Shit.
It's not working.

321
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,203
I got him! I got him!
He's rabbiting!

322
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:39,608
He's out the back.

323
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,775
Give me real-time imagery
coverage at LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00.

324
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:46,113
Got it.
Base, this is local control

325
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:48,153
Requesting immediate
keyhole visual tasking.

326
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,179
Maximum resolution,
LAT 38, 55, LONG 77, 00. Over.

327
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:54,726
Roger that. I'll need a minute
on satellite visual Over.

328
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:58,161
Run, run, Danny! They got guns!

329
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,664
- Where is he?
- He's on the roof. Right there.

330
00:24:02,968 --> 00:24:04,902
Okay, satellite imagery coming through.

331
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,370
Roger that.
Patch visual my location.

332
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,806
Confirm visual
Thank you much.

333
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,208
All units:
Target heading north on rooftop.

334
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,339
Columbia and 18th.
Request immediate visual support. Over.

335
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:18,349
Roger that. We have visual

336
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:34,656
Everybody move. He just jumped
to the adjacent building.

337
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:44,337
- All units, he is entering rear entrance of Capt. Ike's.
- Roger.

338
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:59,122
Get out of the way!

339
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,719
Hey!

340
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,430
Air One, be advised, suspect
heading towards front entrance.

341
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:13,529
- Detail front of building on Columbia.
- Copy that.

342
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:23,949
I got him!
I got him!

343
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:27,508
- All units, target entering
the barbershop.

344
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:39,223
- Hah! Bullshit! We lost him; we lost him.
- We lost him!

345
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:42,756
Units in pursuit, target seen exiting
rear of barbershop in alley. Follow.

346
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:55,143
- I'm blank. I can't see anything.
- We lost the visual

347
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:57,315
- I'm blank. What do you got?
- Who's got him?

348
00:25:58,816 --> 00:26:00,943
Oh!

349
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,578
Zavitz!
Dan Zavitz!

350
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:08,521
It's me, Bobby Dean. We were at
Georgetown together. You okay?

351
00:26:08,592 --> 00:26:10,651
- Help me.
- Are you hurt?

352
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:14,425
What do you think of this one, sir?
Yeah, this is Becky.

353
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:17,490
- Becky, say hi.
- I'm s... Can I have second, please?

354
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:22,532
- He's right on top of Pratt. Running down Connecticut.
- Right.

355
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:25,097
- He's on your 6:00. Turn around.
- Got him!

356
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:28,077
Move, move, move. Get out of the way!

357
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:32,844
Hey, hey!
Come back, man! Come back!

358
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:36,409
Hey, I got him!

359
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:38,717
Target northbound...
northbound on Connecticut.

360
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:40,780
Okay, got him.

361
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:43,850
Go, go, go, go!

362
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,571
Switching targets. Heading southbound
towards DuPont circle.

363
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:10,083
Stop!

364
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,668
Target down on Connecticut Avenue.
Air One confirm.

365
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:34,939
Target is down.
Target is down permanently.

366
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:49,053
- What happened?
- A guy on a bike got creamed.

367
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,291
Oh, Jesus.

368
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:27,493
- I'm beatin' you.
- Yeah, right.

369
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:29,657
Oh, you are.

370
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:31,667
Hey, hey!

371
00:28:31,735 --> 00:28:33,669
- I'm beatin' you.
- No, I'm beatin' you.

372
00:28:33,737 --> 00:28:36,729
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Dean.

373
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:39,571
Am I in the wrong house?

374
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,941
I'm looking for and eight-year-old boy,
about yea high.

375
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,946
Kinda good-looking.
Allegedly my son.

376
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,177
- No.
- Hmm. Maybe he's behind the TV.

377
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,185
Eric?

378
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:51,847
- Eric?
- What? What?

379
00:28:51,922 --> 00:28:55,449
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Are those my Christmas presents?

380
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,256
- Yep, some of them.
- Can I open them?

381
00:28:58,328 --> 00:29:00,319
- Yeah, sure, here you go.
- Seriously?

382
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,922
- In your dreams, buddy. Beat it.
- Dad!

383
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,696
- Are you staying for dinner tonight, Dylan?
- IF it's okay with you.

384
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,761
- Got any money?
- He's kidding.

385
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,865
- I'm going to sleep over at Dylars, okay?
- Did you ask your mother?

386
00:29:11,942 --> 00:29:14,672
I was going to,
but she's too busy yelling at the TV.

387
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:18,977
Oh, well there goes the Fourth
Amendment... what's left of it.

388
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:21,882
- Hey, Maria.
- Hello, Mr. Bobby.

389
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:27,948
- Hey, you're about a bark-and-
a- half from being homeless.

390
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:31,290
Baby, listen to
this fascist gas bag.

391
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:34,524
- Uh-oh... and freedom
have always existed in a... -

392
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:38,227
in a very precarious balance,
and when buildings start blowing up,

393
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:41,533
- people's priorities change.
- He's got a point there, sweetie.

394
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:45,063
- Bobby!
- I mean, who is this idiot?

395
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:48,009
He is talking about ending
personal privacy.

396
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:52,242
- You want your phone tapped?
- I'm not planning on blowing up the country.

397
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:56,013
Well, how do we know until we've heard
all your dirty little secrets?

398
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,486
- You're just gonna have to trust me.
- Hmm.

399
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:02,150
Oh, I know.
We'll just tap the criminals.

400
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:04,786
We won't suspend the civil rights
of the good people.

401
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:07,797
- Right.
- Then who decides which is which?

402
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:11,824
- I think you should
- Bobby, I think you should take this more seriously.

403
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:14,735
Honey, I think you're taking it
seriously enough for both of us,

404
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:17,968
and half the people
on the block.

405
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:23,678
Tens of millions of foreign nationals
living within our borders,

406
00:30:23,747 --> 00:30:26,739
and many of these people consider
the United States their enemy.

407
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:31,550
- They see acts of terrorism...
- Do you remember Daniel Zavitz?

408
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,648
- We were at Georgetown together?
- Vaguely.

409
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:38,058
- I saw him today.
- How's he doing?

410
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,222
- He's dead.
- What?

411
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:45,257
- He got hit by a fire engine pretty much in front of my eyes.
- My God!

412
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:48,793
I ran into him in a store,
and he was upset about something.

413
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:51,033
- About what?
- I don't know.

414
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:54,236
Before we had a chance to talk about it,
he ran out of the store,

415
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,302
and next time I saw him,
he was dead.

416
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:01,115
Baby!
Come here.

417
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:04,780
Ohh, I love you
so much!

418
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:07,050
I love you, too,
sweetie.

419
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:12,328
That's not even to mention the gangster
that threatened to kill me today.

420
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:15,058
- Hah! Very funny!
- Oh, you think?

421
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:18,693
- Hilarious.
- Mmm. What'd you get me?

422
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:20,896
A bowling ball.

423
00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:24,168
No more of that MSNBC terrorist talk.
You're scaring the kids.

424
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:27,802
We'll be back with your phone calls for
Congressman Sam Albert right after this.

425
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:32,841
- Tell me.
- Zavitz is dead. So is Lenny, the guy from the paper.

426
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:35,612
- What about the tape?
- We found the original in Zavitz's apartment.

427
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,620
- The original?
- There was a copy.

428
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,156
- There was a copy?
- I think so, sir.

429
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:42,954
- Any more good news?
- They never made it to the paper, but there was a private contact.

430
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,756
- Who was that?
- Several indiscriminants and one primary.

431
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:47,763
- Who?
- Robert Dean, a D.C. Labor lawyer.

432
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:50,959
Lives in Georgetown with his wife,
Carla Dean. She's also an attorney.

433
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,935
She's with the A.C.L.U.,
as it happens.

434
00:31:54,004 --> 00:31:56,131
I suppose he could've given it
directly to Bob woodward.

435
00:31:56,206 --> 00:32:00,643
Maybe we dodged a bullet.
Find out what Dean knows.

436
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,770
Make contact.

437
00:32:02,846 --> 00:32:05,838
- Yes, sir.
- I hate doing this at Christmas.

438
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,147
Fiedler,
we need a complete FinCEN, EPIC...

439
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,521
and a DRD work-up
on a Robert Clayton Dean.

440
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:20,552
His social's 986-26-0901.
Pull up keyhole data files, okay?

441
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:23,964
Let's go!
Let's get this show on the road!

442
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:28,061
Eric, just call me in the morning
when you want me to come pick you up.

443
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:30,436
You know, if you decide
you want to stay at Dylars...

444
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:35,035
till the end of the weekend or the end of
the century, your mom and I have discussed it.

445
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:38,741
It'll be difficult initially,
but we think we can live with it.

446
00:32:38,815 --> 00:32:42,080
Dad's kidding.
He's gonna miss you, just like me.

447
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:46,485
Honey, hurry back.

448
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:50,356
- You know what that means. - Mmm-hmm.
That you're gonna be asleep when I get back.

449
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,260
That only happened
one time, sweetie.

450
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,197
we're running
a comprehensive database search.

451
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,258
Brian did a preliminary
analysis and comparison,

452
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:01,998
and he came up with
some pretty interesting stuff.

453
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,738
Thanks, Brian.

454
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:10,439
Thank you.

455
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:13,745
Prioritize his phone bill.

456
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,513
Who's he been calling?

457
00:33:18,322 --> 00:33:20,620
- Oh, man. Check this one.
- Who?

458
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:24,559
Rachel F-for-you-know-what Banks. God,
would I love to have her ruin my life.

459
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,528
Do a cross.

460
00:33:26,596 --> 00:33:29,531
They were at Georgetown
together, sophomore year.

461
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,534
They have the same address,
same phone number.

462
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:35,469
They remain close. Many calls,
regardless of marriage.

463
00:33:36,873 --> 00:33:39,933
- Oh, here we go.
- what?

464
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,308
Dean, over the past
18 months,

465
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:46,873
has four, five, seven cash
withdrawals of 4,000, 5,000,

466
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,441
and up, and up,

467
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,453
and each time,

468
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:54,922
the delectable Miss Banks makes large cash
deposits of her own within a day or two.

469
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,687
- Blackmail?
- Well, her deposits aren't the same,

470
00:33:57,761 --> 00:34:00,127
but let me figure this out.

471
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:02,062
Oh, yes, they're exactly...

472
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:05,067
exactly 15% of the amount
Dean withdrew.

473
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:07,968
Brian, can we get some more?

474
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:12,236
I mean, you know, we got the blimp cam,
we got the police officer cam,

475
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:16,973
we've got two A.T.M. Cameras,
but this is the one showing promise.

476
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:20,574
This is the security camera
at the underwear store. Freeze there.

477
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,609
- Rotate us 75 degrees
around the vertical please.

478
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,486
Freeze there.
Times ten.

479
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,017
Focus on the drop.

480
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:37,026
Enance, then forward
frame-by-frame.

481
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,162
All right. Now, just before the view's
blocked, there's a shape change in Dears bag.

482
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:46,505
See the shadow variance?
See?

483
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:50,444
The shadow's wrong. Zavitz changed
the configuration of Dears packages.

484
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:55,042
- Is it a tape?
- It's hard to say for sure. These things are...

485
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:58,576
- Can the computer take us around to the other side?
- It can hypothesize. Chris?

486
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:00,623
- Yeah?
- Can you rotate us...

487
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,817
75 degrees around
the vertical please?

488
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:09,859
- What do you think it is?
- It looks a lot bigger than a tape.

489
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,958
Zavitz had digital compression
equipment in his apartment.

490
00:35:12,035 --> 00:35:13,969
He could've downloaded it
to anything.

491
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:16,005
Or maybe the bag twisted
in Dears hand.

492
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,803
Or something moved in front of the light
and altered the shadow. Maybe it's nothing.

493
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:22,970
Maybe it's everything.
Let's get it and find out.

494
00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:27,913
Beat it. I got work to do.

495
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:30,919
Go. Porsche!

496
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:34,118
Ohh!

497
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:36,819
Go away!

498
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:39,555
Damn it, Porsche!

499
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:43,188
- Hello, Mr. Dean?
- Uh, yes. Can I help you?

500
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,758
This is Detective Benning.
I'm Pratt. We're with D.C. Metro.

501
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:48,828
- Shh.
- Uh, sorry to bother you at home, sir.

502
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:51,237
We were hoping to ask you
a few questions about Daniel Zavitz.

503
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:54,106
- Wh... I'm s... Can I see your badges, please?
- Certainly, sir.

504
00:35:54,177 --> 00:35:56,509
Sure.

505
00:35:57,814 --> 00:36:00,374
All right. Come on.
Back up, Porsche.

506
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:06,549
- All right. Nice and smooth. Come on.
- Okay.

507
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,421
I didn't really see the accident.
I don't know whose fault it was.

508
00:36:09,492 --> 00:36:12,290
- We're not here to talk about the accident, Mr. Dean.
- I'm sorry, I thought you said...

509
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:15,263
we should apologize
for the confusion, sir.

510
00:36:15,332 --> 00:36:17,732
It's just that we're handling
a different aspect of the inquiry.

511
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:21,532
It turns out Mr. Zavitz was
involved in an extortion scheme.

512
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:25,405
- What kind of watch is that?
- It's an Omega.

513
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,239
- So you're not constrained by
attorney-client privilege?

514
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,075
- Shh-shh. Yeah, that's correct.
- You see, Mr. Dean,

515
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,639
we have reason to believe that Mr. Zavitz
may have passed sensitive materials to you.

516
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:37,243
What kind of materials?

517
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,050
Well, sensitive, so we were
hoping you could tell us that.

518
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:43,286
No, he didn't pass me anything.

519
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,954
These voice stress points indicate
a really high degree of anxiety.

520
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:48,554
Anxiety about what?

521
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:53,331
That's the nature of physics. If he'd
given me something, I would've known.

522
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:56,668
- Oh, he's lying!
- What about your packages, sir?

523
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,436
Could something have slipped in amongst
the purchases without your knowledge?

524
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,967
Excuse me. Daniel Zavitz
did not give me anything.

525
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:06,140
- That's a Parker pen.
- It's a Mont Blanc.

526
00:37:06,216 --> 00:37:09,413
He didn't secrete it
into any of my bodily orifices.

527
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:12,011
- Whatever it is, I don't have it.
- Could we look at them?

528
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:14,249
I don't think so.
Not without a warrant.

529
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:16,986
- Oh, Christ.
- This guy's good.

530
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,188
- How did you happen to be at Ruby's today?
- I was shopping for lingerie.

531
00:37:20,263 --> 00:37:22,663
- That's still legal isn't it?
- You buying that for your wife?

532
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:25,030
No, I was, uh,
picking something up for myself.

533
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:28,332
I do a little cross-dressing on the
weekends. You know, you'd be surprised...

534
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:31,374
how a nice pair of edible panties
can make a guy feel sexy.

535
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:34,638
We thought it might be
for Rachel Banks.

536
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:38,010
Good night, gentlemen.

537
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:41,312
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Mr. Dean.

538
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:02,727
What are they talking about, Porsche?
There's nothing here.

539
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,406
Honey, I'm home.

540
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:14,917
Uh, yeah, just a second, sweetie.

541
00:38:23,826 --> 00:38:26,590
Well, either he's getting ready to do
something with it, or he doesn't know he has it.

542
00:38:26,662 --> 00:38:29,961
Or he doesn't have it.

543
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:34,435
You know what I've seen?
I've seen killers walk free...

544
00:38:34,503 --> 00:38:37,404
because the eyewitness
was an alcoholic.

545
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:40,909
I've seen sex offenders that couldn't be
touched because the victim was a call girl

546
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:46,539
Credibility... It's the only currency that
means anything on this kind of playing field

547
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,674
Dears got the tape,
and he's gonna come out with it.

548
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:51,379
And when he does,
I want his credibility.

549
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,786
I want people to know he's lying
before they hear what he says.

550
00:38:53,856 --> 00:38:56,188
We could take his wife and kid.
He'd give it up for them.

551
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:59,819
We'd have the police and the F.B. I
all over this in 24 hours.

552
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:03,296
Put taps on his 20 most frequently called
numbers, and let's get into his life.

553
00:39:03,365 --> 00:39:06,300
The union situation has-has mob
written all over it.

554
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:08,529
And he's definitely vulnerable
on Rachel Banks.

555
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:11,129
I want to know about his wife,
I want to know about his parents,

556
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:13,937
I want to know about his gambling problems,
his urine samples, his porno rentals.

557
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:16,375
I want to use every means possible
to get what we need.

558
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:19,972
Because this little son of a bitch is not
going to be the final chapter of my life.

559
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:28,383
- Tell me something.
- Uh-oh.

560
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:31,551
How did you find out Pintero
was associated with union officials?

561
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:34,152
I'm just that good.

562
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,824
I hired an investigator.

563
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:49,972
- Hey.
- Shut up the dog!

564
00:39:50,045 --> 00:39:51,979
My mom used to have
one of these. Come on.

565
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:54,015
Ow!
The dog bit me!

566
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:58,281
- Who was the investigator?
- Wh-what do you mean? His name?

567
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:02,256
Come on, Bobby. You know what I'm
asking. Is it the guy who Rachel knows?

568
00:40:04,426 --> 00:40:06,519
Why do... why do we have to go
through this every time?

569
00:40:06,595 --> 00:40:08,825
- Baby, I'm just asking, okay?
- Carla,

570
00:40:08,898 --> 00:40:11,526
Rachel Banks is not
an issue anymore.

571
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:29,376
You are the only woman
in the world for me.

572
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:33,350
You and Janet Jackson.

573
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:38,291
- I have to be honest.
If-If Janet Jackson called me,

574
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,352
I w... I might have to change
my last name to Jackson.

575
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:45,560
- Yeah, right. I'd have
to break that womars legs too.

576
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,538
- Lower, like kids would do it.
- You sound like a fucking old lady. Shut up.

577
00:40:57,613 --> 00:41:00,844
Ooh, sensitive.

578
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,180
Jones has some issues
we need to resolve.

579
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:08,717
- Oh. Control they are home.
- Uh-oh.

580
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,996
Move, guys.

581
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:19,091
Oh, nice blender.

582
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,001
Oh, my God.

583
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,745
Oh, Porsche.

584
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:36,410
Shh.

585
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:39,784
Oh, damn.
The dog is green.

586
00:41:39,855 --> 00:41:43,416
Jones painted the... the dog!

587
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:46,859
This is Robert Dean, 2811 Sutton.
I'd like to report a break-in.

588
00:41:46,929 --> 00:41:50,524
I don't know. It's been vandalized.
From the looks of it, i-it's kids,

589
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,567
but I need
a squad car here immediately.

590
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,277
Here we go.

591
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:05,575
We'll be checking out the rest
of the house, sir, ma'am.

592
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,616
At least
they left me one.

593
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,062
How do you know
it wasn't Pintero?

594
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:25,658
I don't. It was just
kind of frivolous.

595
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:28,897
I guess I'm just hoping
it was kids.

596
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,271
John.

597
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,491
What have we here?

598
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:59,366
I think we have
a winner.

599
00:42:59,435 --> 00:43:01,869
Phone for phone.

600
00:43:01,937 --> 00:43:04,167
Take any of your clothes?

601
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,868
No, they threw all my shoes
and suits in the tub,

602
00:43:07,943 --> 00:43:09,968
and spray painted
my damn dog.

603
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,843
- Black.
- Black.

604
00:43:12,915 --> 00:43:15,816
Perfect.
How does that look?

605
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,512
Paging Mr. Dean.

606
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:21,181
We have you bugged,
Mr. Dean.

607
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:26,193
They thrashed my computers, my
big-screen TV... They took my blender.

608
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:28,786
- What about jewelry?
- Nope.

609
00:43:28,864 --> 00:43:32,197
- What about silverware?
- Nope. Just my blender.

610
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:35,725
- Blender, huh?
- Loved that blender.

611
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:38,739
You know, I did stuff
when I was a kid.

612
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:41,002
I mean, not breaking-and-entering,
but, you know, stuff.

613
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:45,172
Yeah, we all did stuff. I just wish
they hadn't stolen my damn blender.

614
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,148
You seem a little attached
to this blender, Robert.

615
00:43:48,217 --> 00:43:51,914
Yeah, well, some people meditate,
some people get massages.

616
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:56,048
- I blend.
- You're really weird, you know that?

617
00:43:56,125 --> 00:44:01,028
Yeah, then on top of it, the only suit
they leave me is three years ol

618
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,360
Hasn't gotten any better
with age.

619
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,794
Blow over? I'm not gonna sit
around and wait for this to blow over!

620
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:13,001
Jerry, I-I'm suing their right-wing
asses right into Chapter 11!

621
00:44:13,075 --> 00:44:15,839
This is flagrant! They never even called
to see what my side of the story was!

622
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:18,539
- They have no Sullivan protection
with this!

623
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,549
- Mr. Dean, Rachel Banks is on line one.
- Yes.

624
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,415
And Silverberg and Blake would like
to see you in the conference room.

625
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:27,455
Uh, Jerry,
I got to take this call. All right.

626
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:29,457
Hey, what's up?

627
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:32,119
My firm called me this morning
telling me not to come in.

628
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:34,492
- What? Why not?
- I don't know.

629
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:37,760
Reporters are calling, asking me
about my relationship with you...

630
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:40,529
and how long
I've worked for the mob.

631
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:43,264
- The mob, Bobby.
- Jesus.

632
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:47,069
- Do you know how hard I worked to get this job?
- Yeah, I know. I know.

633
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,373
Mr. Dean, Silverberg and Blake are still
waiting to see you in the conference room.

634
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:53,643
- I heard you the first time. Thank you.
- You got your own problems.

635
00:44:53,715 --> 00:44:55,945
Uh, no, Rachel It's fine.

636
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:58,213
Oh, damn it!

637
00:45:04,726 --> 00:45:07,286
I just got off the phone
with a source that I trust.

638
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:11,594
A grand jury is being convened
to look into your labor practice...

639
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,658
as far back as the
electrical workers' strike.

640
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:16,465
And why is that?

641
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:19,905
They claim you helped create a shell
company for Sam Villotti in Zurich.

642
00:45:19,975 --> 00:45:23,968
And through your continuing relationship,
the Peitso family has been able...

643
00:45:24,046 --> 00:45:28,574
to exert influence and provide
false witness to discredit our case.

644
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,244
- Oh, well, that's true.
- You're admitting it?

645
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,257
Sure. Everything except
setting up a company in Zurich.

646
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:38,293
Or even knowing anyone
named Sam Villotti.

647
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,591
Or having any relationship whatsoever
to the Peitso family!

648
00:45:41,663 --> 00:45:43,597
This is ridiculous!

649
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:45,394
- Robert...
- Mark, I'm telling you.

650
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:47,298
This is Pintero.
He's coming back after me.

651
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,395
You give me one week... one week
and four guys from litigation,

652
00:45:50,472 --> 00:45:53,339
and I guarantee you,
we'll have this guy begging us...

653
00:45:53,408 --> 00:45:55,842
Tell us
about Rachel Banks.

654
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:02,674
Tell you what? Uh, she was my
girlfriend the second year of law school

655
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,849
we keep in touch. We-we toss one another
some work every once in awhile. That's it.

656
00:46:04,884 --> 00:46:06,947
We keep in touch. We-we toss one another
some work every once in awhile. That's it.

657
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:10,355
Did you have an affair
with her four years ago?

658
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:14,695
You ever beat off
in the shower, Brian?

659
00:46:14,763 --> 00:46:17,857
Hmm? You ever have
any homosexual thoughts?

660
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:22,393
- Bobby, that is...
- None of my fucking business! You're damn right it's not!

661
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:25,235
I love my wife,
and I love my son...

662
00:46:25,307 --> 00:46:29,539
absolutely, with no equivocations, and
that's none of your fucking business either.

663
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:32,604
Uh, we think that you
should take a leave of absence...

664
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:34,842
until we're able
to, uh, sort all this out.

665
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,909
- Are you firing me?
- I think you just fired yourself.

666
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,698
Carla!

667
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:56,163
Where is she, Jen?

668
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,108
Don't go in there.
She doesn't want to talk to you.

669
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:02,575
- Why not?
- Because she's reading the paper.

670
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:08,550
Asshole.

671
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,381
Carla...

672
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,751
How could you let me
find out like this?

673
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:17,883
I'm finding out like this. This is
all lies. None of this stuff is true.

674
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,053
So you're saying
you were'nt there with her?

675
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,359
Yes, I had lunch with her.
We have lunch once a month.

676
00:47:22,431 --> 00:47:25,696
She's the contact for the investigator,
Brill. You were right about that.

677
00:47:25,768 --> 00:47:29,363
Someone must have taken this picture off
the security camera outside the restaurant.

678
00:47:29,438 --> 00:47:31,736
- You said she wasn't an issue.
- She's not!

679
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,299
I have to see her for business.
And I knew if I told you that...

680
00:47:35,377 --> 00:47:38,107
Bobby, you had an affair
with this woman! An affair.

681
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,148
We went to a counselor
for a year!

682
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:43,548
And now you're standing there
lying about even seeing her?

683
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,554
You make me sick!

684
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:52,561
Carla, I am smeared all over the newspapers for money
- laundering schemes, mob ties...

685
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:55,688
I lost my job.
I am asking you.

686
00:47:55,764 --> 00:48:00,133
I am asking you to please just trust me
on this Rachel Banks thing right now.

687
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:03,069
How in God's name
can I trust you?

688
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:05,163
Bobby, I want you
to leave.

689
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,333
Carla, I'm telling you
that this is all bullshit!

690
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:09,343
I don't want
to hear anything else.

691
00:48:09,411 --> 00:48:12,312
I cannot think with you in my face.
I want you to leave.

692
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:14,679
What do you need to think about?
I'm telling you it's bullshit!

693
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,514
Just leave, so I can think!
For me, okay? Just leave.

694
00:48:17,586 --> 00:48:20,453
Just go, Bobby.
Go.

695
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,251
Go!

696
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,924
- You want a blend?
- Yeah.

697
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:31,250
Thanks.

698
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:41,644
- Hi.
- Hi. I'd like to have a room for the evening, please.

699
00:48:41,777 --> 00:48:45,008
Okay.
Thank you.

700
00:48:47,316 --> 00:48:50,444
- I'm sorry, sir.
This card was declined.

701
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,714
Declined? This is a brand-new card.
Try it again, please.

702
00:48:52,788 --> 00:48:55,951
Yes, sir.

703
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:59,392
- You know, maybe it's
not activated yet.

704
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:02,521
Thank you.
Run this one, please.

705
00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:05,567
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

706
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:08,899
No, it didn't
go through.

707
00:49:08,971 --> 00:49:10,962
- But I'll try it again.
- No, thank you.

708
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:15,201
- My briefcase is gone.
- Excuse me, sir?

709
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:17,939
- My briefcase was right here.
- Are you sure you brought it in?

710
00:49:18,013 --> 00:49:20,675
Yes, I'm sure
I brought it in!

711
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:27,913
Hi. This is Rachel
Leave a message after the beep.

712
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:31,517
- Hey, Rachel it's Bobby.
I need to talk to you,

713
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,221
And I need to talk to you
face-to-face.

714
00:49:34,296 --> 00:49:37,390
Meet me tomorrow, 11:00 a. m.,
Mount Vernon Square. I'll see you then.

715
00:49:37,466 --> 00:49:39,730
Yes.

716
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:52,346
All right, we're moving into
phase two of the training op.

717
00:49:52,414 --> 00:49:54,439
Selby's gonna brief you on it,
so listen up, okay?

718
00:49:54,516 --> 00:49:57,542
We're gonna be following the subjects
through the square.

719
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,917
We're gonna have three listening stations
and two video surveillance units...

720
00:49:59,988 --> 00:50:01,922
with unidirectional mikes.

721
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,618
Pratt, you're three.
Jones, Fiedler, Krug,

722
00:50:04,693 --> 00:50:07,685
you guys are at ground level
You'll be following the targets.

723
00:50:07,763 --> 00:50:09,788
You move when I say,
you go when I say.

724
00:50:09,865 --> 00:50:12,527
All handoffs go
on my command.

725
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:15,729
Now, for the uninitiated,
if we don't have line-of-sight,

726
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,034
we can't hear
what they say, right?

727
00:50:18,107 --> 00:50:20,268
- Right?
- Yeah. Got it.

728
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:23,436
- All right. You guys clear?
- Yeah.

729
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:25,776
Jones, Krug, what, are you guys
from communications?

730
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:28,874
- No, we're ops.
- You can tell by their haircuts.

731
00:50:37,158 --> 00:50:40,286
I would like to sit down
with Mr. Pintero in private...

732
00:50:40,361 --> 00:50:42,386
so he and I can discuss
what's happening to me.

733
00:50:42,463 --> 00:50:44,727
I called; they said
he was here.

734
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:47,825
Mr. Pintero would like
to help you.

735
00:50:47,902 --> 00:50:50,632
But he won't.

736
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:53,765
- And why not?
- Well, first, you haven't told him...

737
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:56,207
who made the tape,
and second,

738
00:50:56,277 --> 00:51:00,213
we've spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars...

739
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:02,681
on shyster lawyers
just like you...

740
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,278
because of shyster lawyers
just like you.

741
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:11,985
Actually, I believe the slur "shyster"
is generally reserved...

742
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,255
for Jewish attorneys.

743
00:51:14,328 --> 00:51:17,229
I believe the proper slur
for someone like myself...

744
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:19,664
would be, uh,
"eggplant. "

745
00:51:19,734 --> 00:51:23,038
Boom. This kid gets brighter
every time I see him.

746
00:51:27,675 --> 00:51:30,511
You said 11:00 sharp.

747
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:32,373
I know. Uh,
Christmas traffic is horrible.

748
00:51:34,515 --> 00:51:39,111
You know, it's not so smart, us being
seen together in public like this.

749
00:51:39,186 --> 00:51:43,247
- Do we have anything to hide?
- Heavy background on one. Can we do better on two?

750
00:51:43,323 --> 00:51:45,553
- Unfortunately not.
- Two is better.

751
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:48,527
The IR.S. Contacted me this morning.

752
00:51:48,595 --> 00:51:51,291
- Two, you're good. Hold position.
- They say my lifestyle...

753
00:51:51,365 --> 00:51:55,267
- exceeds my income.
- Ohh. You're being audited?

754
00:51:55,335 --> 00:51:59,169
For the last four years.
What's going on, Bobby?

755
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:03,539
Uh, look, don't worry about that. My
firm will represent you free of charge.

756
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:07,239
- Eighty percent.
- You don't work there anymore, remember?

757
00:52:07,314 --> 00:52:09,373
It's a temporary
situation.

758
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:13,044
- Your 80's becoming a 20. Move to audio three.
- On three. Much better.

759
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,486
- we're screwed.
- Wake up, one.

760
00:52:15,556 --> 00:52:18,548
We are out.

761
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:22,527
Rachel
I'm going to fix this.

762
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:24,564
- How?
- Tell me about Brill.

763
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:28,590
- Did he say "Bill"? - No, "Brill,"
with an "R." - I can't do that.

764
00:52:28,669 --> 00:52:31,536
- Cross-reference Rachel's file.
See if "Brill" comes up. - Got it.

765
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:35,336
Rachel don't you see that he
is the key to this whole mess?

766
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:39,004
From the second you gave me that tape,
my life has been falling apart.

767
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:41,274
You assured me
that this-this guy was legit.

768
00:52:41,348 --> 00:52:43,680
- You needed information; I got it for you.
- Two, you're good.

769
00:52:45,018 --> 00:52:48,920
- Three is good.
- This conversation is over.

770
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:52,152
Okay, here we go.

771
00:52:52,225 --> 00:52:54,853
Two, you gotta do better.

772
00:52:54,928 --> 00:52:56,919
- Shit.
- You want your life back?

773
00:52:56,997 --> 00:53:00,228
I don't have
a life.

774
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,495
I'm in love
with a married man.

775
00:53:07,774 --> 00:53:10,299
Okay, I have 'em
on the bench.

776
00:53:10,377 --> 00:53:12,345
Rachel

777
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:16,178
I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do about that.

778
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:18,444
What makes you think
it's you?

779
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:23,716
It's not me?

780
00:53:25,058 --> 00:53:27,049
I j... I just as-assumed
from...

781
00:53:27,127 --> 00:53:31,791
- You're a moron, you know that?
- Yes. I know.

782
00:53:36,236 --> 00:53:38,602
Rachel you're gonna have
to tell me about Brill.

783
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,639
Let's get out of here.

784
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,304
All right.
They're on the move.

785
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:50,476
- Coming to three. - Stay
with 'em. - I got 40, 20...

786
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,509
- You're following through trees.
Two, can you track them?

787
00:53:54,588 --> 00:53:57,318
I have lost line-of-sight.
Repeat, I have lost line-of-sight.

788
00:53:57,391 --> 00:53:59,916
- Three, you've got nothing.
- I've lost line-of-sight. I'm out.

789
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:02,826
We've lost audio; it's gone. But we still
have his tracers. We can still follow 'em.

790
00:54:02,896 --> 00:54:05,364
When I need
to reach Brill,

791
00:54:05,432 --> 00:54:08,799
I chalk the mailbox
outside my house.

792
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:11,997
When he crosses the mark,
I make the drop.

793
00:54:12,072 --> 00:54:16,168
The locations always the same...
same time, same place.

794
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:18,734
3:00 p. m. Ferry
to Gibson Island.

795
00:54:18,812 --> 00:54:22,543
- You ever see him in person?
- He's the cautious type.

796
00:54:22,616 --> 00:54:24,777
He's not gonna like you
tracking him down.

797
00:54:27,287 --> 00:54:29,847
The drop is
behind seat 32.

798
00:54:29,923 --> 00:54:33,359
I leave something;
he picks it up later.

799
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:29,614
I'm sorry it took so long. I had to
make sure you weren't being followed.

800
00:55:30,617 --> 00:55:33,882
- Brill.
- Brill's dead.

801
00:55:33,954 --> 00:55:37,219
Died of smallpox when he was two.
Buried in a field in Kansas.

802
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,350
- What is that?
- It's a bug-sweeper.

803
00:55:42,062 --> 00:55:45,156
- Take off your left shoe.
- What does it mean when...

804
00:55:45,232 --> 00:55:49,032
Take off your shoe. I don't have time to
explain. Take off your shoe right now.

805
00:55:49,102 --> 00:55:51,400
Come on.

806
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,245
It's a beacon transmitter.
Thousand-yard range.

807
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:06,308
They're close.
Let's go.

808
00:56:06,386 --> 00:56:09,048
Who is "they"?

809
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:14,295
And why are they putting things
in my shoes?

810
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,201
No, get in the back,
like you're a customer.

811
00:56:28,108 --> 00:56:32,909
Everything's gone... the wife,
job, bank accounts, everything.

812
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,746
You said Zavitz was behind
an extortion scheme?

813
00:56:36,817 --> 00:56:39,547
- No, they said it.
- You were the last one that talked to him?

814
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,054
- Yeah.
- What did he say?

815
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:44,989
- He said, "Help me, Bobby. "
- Help me with what?

816
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:47,289
I don't know.
We never got around to that.

817
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:52,161
- What did he give you?
- Nothing. He didn't give me anything.

818
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,176
Listen, you gotta come clean.
If you bullshit me, I can't help you.

819
00:57:03,243 --> 00:57:06,610
- He didn't give me anything.
- A name? A phone number?

820
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,275
Nothing!
He didn't give me anything!

821
00:57:16,957 --> 00:57:19,858
- Who the hell is that?
- Just somebody trying to get our attention.

822
00:57:19,927 --> 00:57:22,896
Well, he's doing
a good job.

823
00:57:25,165 --> 00:57:28,532
Two-zero-nine to anybody.
I need help.

824
00:57:28,602 --> 00:57:31,935
- Who you calling? I thought you worked alone.
- Shut up a second.

825
00:57:39,213 --> 00:57:42,307
Tires Screeching]

826
00:57:48,555 --> 00:57:50,989
Stay exactly
where you are.

827
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:56,956
Look what you did
to my car!

828
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,430
Shit!

829
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,515
Okay, gentlemen, we have a subject
entering the structure...

830
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,949
on the northeast corner
of Chambers and Light.

831
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:23,353
- That's 105 Chambers Avenue.
- Run a check on all six tracers.

832
00:58:23,424 --> 00:58:25,790
All six tracers are operative.

833
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:27,918
- Call up geo-position.
- Yeah, I got it.

834
00:58:27,995 --> 00:58:33,627
- Task keyhole coordinates.
- LAT, 39 degrees, 14 minutes. LONG, 74 degrees, 39 minutes.

835
00:58:48,415 --> 00:58:51,441
- Hello.
- Carla, don't hang up on me.

836
00:58:51,518 --> 00:58:54,817
- Robert, do you know what I'm looking at right now?
- Carla, listen.

837
00:58:54,888 --> 00:58:58,790
Photographs of you and Rachel
taken today. Is this true?

838
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:02,522
Carla... Carla, how did
you get the pictures?

839
00:59:02,596 --> 00:59:04,860
By messenger, Robert!
By messenger.

840
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:08,060
- What does it matter?
- Look, all right, um...

841
00:59:08,168 --> 00:59:11,069
Something's going on.
I don't know who it is.

842
00:59:11,138 --> 00:59:13,732
Robert,
I went to the store today,

843
00:59:13,807 --> 00:59:16,571
and my A.T.M.
And my credit cards didn't work.

844
00:59:16,643 --> 00:59:19,407
- I know. Mine either.
- I couldn't buy food.

845
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:24,373
- I gotta go.
- What do you mean you gotta go?

846
00:59:24,451 --> 00:59:27,318
Carla... Carla,
I gotta... I gotta go.

847
00:59:27,387 --> 00:59:28,718
Wait a minute...

848
00:59:36,997 --> 00:59:39,227
Get on the fucking elevator.

849
00:59:45,138 --> 00:59:47,698
Oh, really?

850
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:55,178
Got vertical movement here.

851
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:59,375
Elevator.
He's in an elevator.

852
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:02,911
- We're losing our tracking. - Anybody
got a visual? - We need a better signal

853
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,617
- Are you guys there yet?
- Negative.

854
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,570
What the fuck
is going on?

855
01:00:21,775 --> 01:00:24,539
Shh.

856
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:26,408
Wait. They stopped.

857
01:00:31,718 --> 01:00:33,618
Hold it.

858
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:41,284
- I don't know what your problem...
- Shh.

859
01:01:00,914 --> 01:01:04,350
I'm getting high-frequency clutter.
We lost tracers one, two and six.

860
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:07,683
- Their signals are dead.
Something is wrong.

861
01:01:22,002 --> 01:01:24,334
Get up.

862
01:01:27,674 --> 01:01:31,633
- Tracers three, four and five are on their way up.
- He's getting help, boys.

863
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:35,307
We had an arrangement.
No contact. You broke the rules.

864
01:01:35,382 --> 01:01:38,146
Air One, we need
to establish visual on the rooftop,

865
01:01:38,218 --> 01:01:40,152
northeast corner,
Chambers and Light.

866
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,950
Copy that. Rooftop,
northeast corner, Chambers and Light.

867
01:01:43,023 --> 01:01:45,389
Do you know how many federal agents
you had following you on that ferry?

868
01:01:45,459 --> 01:01:47,984
- I don't...
- who are you working for?

869
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:51,224
- I'm not working...
- Is that about me? Am I a target here?

870
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:53,562
- Do they know me?
- Who is "they"?

871
01:01:53,634 --> 01:01:56,626
- Do they know me?
- I don't know what you're talking about!

872
01:01:58,271 --> 01:02:01,729
- You're either very smart
or incredibly stupid.

873
01:02:01,808 --> 01:02:04,208
Get off. Come on.

874
01:02:09,249 --> 01:02:12,650
- I got separating signals.
- Tracer three is on its way down.

875
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:13,879
Where did he go?

876
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,579
How did you find out about the ferry?

877
01:02:15,656 --> 01:02:18,819
- Who set that up for you?
- Rachel did. Who was that other guy?

878
01:02:18,892 --> 01:02:22,726
- What did he say, exactly?
- He said he was Brill.

879
01:02:22,796 --> 01:02:26,027
Did he say it or did you, and he
picked up on it? Come on. Think.

880
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:30,001
- Shit, I said it.
- Goddamn it. That's why I have rules.

881
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:33,198
- Is all this about Pintero?
- You think the mob uses devices like this?

882
01:02:38,979 --> 01:02:41,880
- Excuse me, sir. Where are your elevators?
- Right over there.

883
01:02:41,948 --> 01:02:45,440
In your phone was a G.P.S. Sat-tracker.
Pulse is at 24 gigahertz.

884
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:47,783
- I don't know what that means.
- It's like a Lo Jack.

885
01:02:47,854 --> 01:02:50,721
- Only two generations better than what the police have.
- What does that mean?

886
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:53,055
- You speak English?
- Obviously not that well.

887
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:55,526
You're kind of a jerk,
aren't you?

888
01:02:55,595 --> 01:02:59,087
- The N.S.A. Can read the time off your fucking wristwatch.
- Enough of this bullshit.

889
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:02,192
Either shoot me or tell me
what the fuck is going on!

890
01:03:03,837 --> 01:03:07,568
Jones, take the stairs. Krug,
hold the perimeter. Come on my signal

891
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:10,405
The National Security Agency
conducts worldwide surveillance.

892
01:03:10,477 --> 01:03:12,911
Fax, phones,
satellite communication.

893
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:16,710
They're the only ones in the country who
could possibly have anything like this.

894
01:03:16,783 --> 01:03:19,650
- Why are they after me?
- I don't know, and I don't wanna know.

895
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,486
Here they come. I thought these sat
dishes would scramble their signals.

896
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:25,787
Control this is Air One.
Repeat coordinates.

897
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:27,884
105 Chambers Avenue.

898
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:29,622
You're transmitting.

899
01:03:29,696 --> 01:03:32,927
They still have a signal on you.
Your collar, belt zipper.

900
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:35,331
- Get rid of your clothes.
- Then what am I supposed to do?

901
01:03:35,402 --> 01:03:38,303
Nothing. You live another day,
I'll be very impressed.

902
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:40,601
Two targets, rooftop,
north side.

903
01:03:40,674 --> 01:03:43,074
Two targets, rooftop.
Maintain visual please.

904
01:03:43,143 --> 01:03:45,907
- You have something they want.
- I don't have anything!

905
01:03:45,979 --> 01:03:49,972
Maybe you do and you don't know it.
Stay away from Rachel and me.

906
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:53,645
Come near either one of us, I'm gonna
kill you. Get rid of your watch.

907
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,984
- My wife gave me this for our anniversary.
- Then keep it.

908
01:03:56,056 --> 01:03:57,956
Stay off the phone.

909
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:09,266
- Either he just committed suicide here...
- Or he learned to fly.

910
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:12,168
- Air One, stay with him.
- Target's on the move.

911
01:04:12,238 --> 01:04:15,469
Satellite imagery
coming through.

912
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:19,102
One meter res layering wireframe
coming your way. Over.

913
01:04:19,178 --> 01:04:22,113
Okay, gentlemen,
we're back on-line.

914
01:04:22,181 --> 01:04:24,046
Wireframe download complete.

915
01:04:24,117 --> 01:04:28,178
We have a tracer in the stairwell
on 20 traveling down.

916
01:04:28,254 --> 01:04:30,313
Nineteen. Eighteen.

917
01:04:33,192 --> 01:04:36,525
- Seventeen.
- Moving up!

918
01:04:42,769 --> 01:04:45,329
He's out of the stairwell
on 17. Go to 17.

919
01:04:51,477 --> 01:04:53,707
Oh, shit.

920
01:05:05,091 --> 01:05:07,582
Shit.

921
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,093
Mr. Wu.

922
01:05:09,162 --> 01:05:11,995
- Target is holding on 17. Zoom three Mag.
- Zooming.

923
01:05:13,132 --> 01:05:14,565
Mr. Wu.

924
01:05:18,438 --> 01:05:21,134
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

925
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:23,971
Hi. I'm from
hotel hospitality and evaluation.

926
01:05:24,043 --> 01:05:26,739
No, no. No tip. I'm fine.
Thank you. No tip.

927
01:05:26,813 --> 01:05:28,747
- Hello.
- Hi.

928
01:05:28,815 --> 01:05:32,046
I wanna make sure you folks have everything
you need to be completely comfortable.

929
01:05:32,118 --> 01:05:34,416
I got something here.

930
01:05:34,487 --> 01:05:37,183
We got him.

931
01:05:37,256 --> 01:05:40,623
Krug, Jones, get your asses up here
to the 17th floor.

932
01:05:40,693 --> 01:05:42,957
That's really important
to us here.

933
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:45,088
Mr. Dean?

934
01:05:45,164 --> 01:05:47,291
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Aw, shit.

935
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:50,461
My clothes.

936
01:05:50,536 --> 01:05:52,936
- Shit!
- Yeah.

937
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:55,735
Mr. Dean?

938
01:05:58,845 --> 01:06:02,110
- Whoo!
- Mr. Dean?

939
01:06:02,181 --> 01:06:05,082
Come to the door,
and we can work this out.

940
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:08,946
I got rabies or something.
I can't do it.

941
01:06:09,021 --> 01:06:10,886
I can't do it.

942
01:06:23,636 --> 01:06:25,968
It'a a go.

943
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:37,812
- That's our last tracer.
- Mr. Dean!

944
01:06:37,884 --> 01:06:41,513
Let's not let this get out of hand.
Let's not involve the hotel guests.

945
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:46,984
Down, ma'am, sir.
Sit down. Thank you.

946
01:06:50,997 --> 01:06:54,455
- Door!
- Everything's gonna be all right, folks.

947
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:00,468
Krug, balcony!

948
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:04,203
Air One, we got him.
He's dropped to the 16th floor.

949
01:07:04,277 --> 01:07:07,838
Air One, visual support. Check
perimeter, south side of the building.

950
01:07:07,914 --> 01:07:10,712
Ten-four, Control
we have visual

951
01:07:17,356 --> 01:07:20,189
- He jumped to 15. Go to 15.
- Go!

952
01:07:22,728 --> 01:07:25,993
Grab his clothes.

953
01:07:26,065 --> 01:07:29,193
Let's go, gentlemen. Weapons away.

954
01:07:33,439 --> 01:07:36,465
Go!

955
01:07:37,543 --> 01:07:39,477
Move!

956
01:07:46,285 --> 01:07:48,845
Dean, open this door,
goddamn it!

957
01:08:01,634 --> 01:08:06,537
Dean, come on now!
We just wanna talk! Open the door!

958
01:08:18,184 --> 01:08:20,118
Open that door.

959
01:08:27,293 --> 01:08:29,853
D.C. Metro.
Our partner's trapped inside.

960
01:08:29,929 --> 01:08:32,591
We gotta evacuate
this building.

961
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:39,729
Control we have
approaching emergency vehicles.

962
01:08:39,805 --> 01:08:42,569
The show's going public,
and they're coming in the front door.

963
01:08:42,642 --> 01:08:45,236
- Stand down. Maintain visual perimeter.
- We're outta here.

964
01:08:50,383 --> 01:08:54,479
Chavez on the 15th floor. We got
one man trapped and possibly down.

965
01:08:54,554 --> 01:08:56,920
There's a guy
trapped in there.

966
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:09,500
You're going
to be okay, guy.

967
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,673

01:09:28,955 --> 01:09:31,822
Take it easy, guy.
You're going to be all right.

970
01:09:31,891 --> 01:09:34,086
Cal down. It's okay.

971
01:09:36,429 --> 01:09:39,990
- Easy, fella.
- I gotta go. Stop the ambulance.

972
01:09:40,066 --> 01:09:43,832
- Tell him to stop it now! - Pull
over, George. - Take it easy, fella.

973
01:09:46,005 --> 01:09:49,702
- He's getting out!
- Son of a bitch!

974
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:54,946
He's escaped the ambulance and he's
on foot. But our guys are in pursuit.

975
01:09:55,014 --> 01:09:58,575
- Task keyhole that coordinate.

976
01:09:58,651 --> 01:10:01,449
LONG, 74 degrees,

977
01:10:04,557 --> 01:10:09,324
- Move, guys.
- Go, go, go! Damn it! Go around!

978
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:19,905
- You're on. Go.
- Tunnel Control This is D.C. Metro.

979
01:10:19,972 --> 01:10:22,566
In pursuit armed felon in tunnel
Requesting video help.

980
01:10:24,744 --> 01:10:29,807
Metro, this is Tunnel Control we got a 20
on your suspect heading south in tunnel six.

981
01:10:29,882 --> 01:10:31,782
Copy that.

982
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:36,486
We got him. He's right
in front of us. Tunnel six.

983
01:10:36,555 --> 01:10:40,218
He's heading south down tunnel six.
He's got nowhere to go.

984
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:46,694
He's crossed over.
He's on the wrong side.

985
01:10:50,503 --> 01:10:52,733
Stop! Stop!

986
01:10:55,808 --> 01:10:58,868
We lost him. We lost him.
Son of a bitch! Pull over.

987
01:11:01,614 --> 01:11:05,243
- He's currently entering vertical stairwell five.
- Where does that lead?

988
01:11:05,317 --> 01:11:08,343
Five leads to main access
to sub-ventilation tunnel

989
01:11:08,421 --> 01:11:13,358
- Closest vehicular access?
- Adjacent utility entrance, south side.

990
01:11:13,426 --> 01:11:17,453
He's in the ventilation tunnel Proceed to the
adjacent utility entrance on the south side.

991
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:20,897
- There is no visual coverage.
- He's in a ventilation tunnel

992
01:11:20,966 --> 01:11:24,367
To the service entrance at
the south end! Come on! Let's go!

993
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:26,564
Come on! Go!

994
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:25,188
Normally,
I wouldn't do this.

995
01:12:25,264 --> 01:12:27,698
Do you guys have him?
Talk to me, people.

996
01:12:39,044 --> 01:12:42,365
- Shit!
- Shit!

997
01:12:48,087 --> 01:12:50,885
I don't understand
why this is so difficul

998
01:12:50,957 --> 01:12:53,824
He shed the sensors.
He's clever. And he's had help.

999
01:12:53,893 --> 01:12:58,159
- Maybe it's the real Brill.
- There's 23 Brills in the Baltimore/D.C. Area.

1000
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:00,858
None of them check out.
We're running it through EPIC now.

1001
01:13:00,933 --> 01:13:04,164
- Do you think we're being set up?
- Somebody in the agency?

1002
01:13:04,236 --> 01:13:06,636
I don't know.

1003
01:13:06,706 --> 01:13:10,836
It just tastes
a little off, doesn't it?

1004
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:14,505
- I know what you mean.
- Let's raise the stakes.

1005
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:17,811
Make things a bit more serious for Mr.
Dean. We'll both think about how, okay?

1006
01:13:17,883 --> 01:13:19,851
Okay. Good.

1007
01:13:25,257 --> 01:13:28,021
- Anything wrong?
- No.

1008
01:13:30,596 --> 01:13:35,226
You should have made deputy director
two years ago, maybe three.

1009
01:13:35,301 --> 01:13:38,737
But it'll happen now. Once this bill
passes, that'll be it for you.

1010
01:13:47,746 --> 01:13:49,680
Thanks, Marie.

1011
01:13:57,455 --> 01:14:00,549
Porsche, what are you
barking at, boy?

1012
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:14,404
Porsche?

1013
01:14:15,974 --> 01:14:19,102
- It's me.
- I know it's you. You scared the shit out of me.

1014
01:14:19,177 --> 01:14:23,273
The house is bugged. Everything
you say, they can hear and maybe see.

1015
01:14:23,348 --> 01:14:25,475
Listen to me.
Listen, listen.

1016
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:29,077
I never... I swear to God.
I never... This is the truth.

1017
01:14:29,154 --> 01:14:32,317
I never, ever since the problem,
touched Rachel like that.

1018
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:36,486
I never even looked at her
like that, honey. I love you.

1019
01:14:36,561 --> 01:14:39,655
I love you, and that is it.
That is it. Only you.

1020
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:41,961
What about Eric?

1021
01:14:42,033 --> 01:14:44,433
And Eric.

1022
01:14:44,502 --> 01:14:47,960
And I love your family.
Except for your dad.

1023
01:14:50,242 --> 01:14:53,905
I need you. I need you real bad.
I need you, okay?

1024
01:14:56,381 --> 01:14:58,178
Okay.

1025
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,017
I told you, Bobby.

1026
01:15:03,088 --> 01:15:05,420
I told you they had
this type of capability.

1027
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:09,085
And that goddamn privacy bill is just
another way for them to expand the power.

1028
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,094
- Shh.
- Don't you "shh" me.

1029
01:15:14,532 --> 01:15:18,593
You were right. I was wrong. But this is
not the time for the "I told you so" speech.

1030
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:22,401
That day when Daniel Zavitz got hit
by the fire truck, he was running.

1031
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:26,604
The people that were chasing him,
that's the people that are chasing me.

1032
01:15:26,678 --> 01:15:30,170
- Bobby, are you serious?
- Go to Philadelphia, stay with your family.

1033
01:15:30,248 --> 01:15:33,217
- Just give me time to work this out.
- I don't think so.

1034
01:15:33,285 --> 01:15:36,379
They're not chasing me
out of my house.

1035
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:40,823
- I picked those drapes.
- Shh, shh, shh. Nobody cares about the drapes.

1036
01:15:40,892 --> 01:15:43,986
Just one time can I make
some decisions around here?

1037
01:15:44,062 --> 01:15:46,963
Just go to Philadelphia.
I need you to do that for me, okay?

1038
01:15:47,032 --> 01:15:50,798
- Okay.
- I miss you.

1039
01:15:52,237 --> 01:15:54,034
Oh, God.

1040
01:16:00,645 --> 01:16:04,103
- You can't wear that. That's a Christmas present.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1041
01:16:04,182 --> 01:16:06,480
But, baby, I missed you.
I was lonely.

1042
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:09,019
How you just gonna go
through my stuff like that?

1043
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,317
Until I actually give it to you,
that's still mine.

1044
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:14,051
Yeah, but it looks better on me,
don't you think?

1045
01:16:15,627 --> 01:16:18,323
Baby, you're
as bad as Eric.

1046
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:21,661
I missed you so much.

1047
01:16:24,936 --> 01:16:27,427
- What?
- That was the night.

1048
01:16:27,505 --> 01:16:30,440
That was the night that
I came home with the presents.

1049
01:16:30,508 --> 01:16:32,806
- Where is Eric?
- He's at Dylars house.

1050
01:16:32,877 --> 01:16:35,573
He's probably on the way to school
what's going on?

1051
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:38,115
What are you doing with that?

1052
01:16:38,183 --> 01:16:41,675
- Shh, baby. Shh, shh.
- What do you want me to do with this?

1053
01:16:41,753 --> 01:16:45,120
Get me some money. I need some clothes.
Tell Maria we need her car.

1054
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:49,728
Chances are they wouldn't have
bugged it. Oh, shit. Eric.

1055
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,295
The nanny is leaving.

1056
01:17:01,372 --> 01:17:03,306
- Please advise.
- Stay put.

1057
01:17:03,374 --> 01:17:05,604
We have satellite tracking
and Bingham at the school

1058
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:16,946
Aw, man, let me follow
the nanny.

1059
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:22,317
She doesn't shave
her legs. Jesus!

1060
01:17:22,393 --> 01:17:24,224
Women like that
are so hot.

1061
01:17:24,295 --> 01:17:27,958
Is there anybody following us?
- No. No, Mr. Bobby.

1062
01:17:28,032 --> 01:17:30,830
Drive a little faster. I wanna catch 'em
before they get to school

1063
01:17:36,508 --> 01:17:40,308
- There they are.
- Pull up and tell them to get into the car.

1064
01:17:40,378 --> 01:17:42,312
Okay.

1065
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,645
Eric, Dylan,
get in the car, please.

1066
01:17:45,717 --> 01:17:48,777
- No, we're okay.
- Get in the car right now.

1067
01:17:48,853 --> 01:17:53,688
- But school's right down the block.
- You heard me. Now, get.

1068
01:18:04,202 --> 01:18:06,636
- What's up, fellas?
- Dad?

1069
01:18:06,704 --> 01:18:09,195
No. Turn around.
Sit down. Face forward.

1070
01:18:09,274 --> 01:18:12,107
- But, Dad...
- what did I say, Eric?

1071
01:18:12,177 --> 01:18:15,806
We're gonna play a game.
Pick a spot and look right at it.

1072
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,178
You can't let anyone know
I'm back here, okay?

1073
01:18:18,249 --> 01:18:21,184
How you been, E.?
I missed you, man.

1074
01:18:21,252 --> 01:18:23,777
I missed you, too, Dad.
Where did you go?

1075
01:18:23,855 --> 01:18:26,790
Oh, they've been keeping me
really busy on this case.

1076
01:18:26,858 --> 01:18:28,849
They're trying
to work me to death.

1077
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:32,021
- Are you and Mom getting a divorce?
- Face forward.

1078
01:18:32,096 --> 01:18:35,532
What are you talking about?
No, we're not getting a divorce.

1079
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,728
We had a little fight.
Sometimes married couples have fights.

1080
01:18:38,803 --> 01:18:42,000
- That's nothing for you to worry about.
- Who won the fight?

1081
01:18:42,073 --> 01:18:45,372
This is your dad, Eric.
When I put my foot down, that's it.

1082
01:18:45,443 --> 01:18:49,072
- My mom won.
- I have a question I need to ask you.

1083
01:18:49,147 --> 01:18:52,378
It is absolutely imperative
that you tell me the truth.

1084
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:56,352
Now, no matter what you say,
you are not going to get in trouble.

1085
01:18:56,421 --> 01:18:58,412
- All right? You ready?
- Yeah.

1086
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:01,356
You remember that night I came home
with those Christmas presents...

1087
01:19:01,426 --> 01:19:06,125
I just looked in the bag, Dad. I wouldn't
have taken it, except it was already open.

1088
01:19:06,197 --> 01:19:11,362
All right, so we're clear. But I need
it. I promise I'll get you another one.

1089
01:19:11,436 --> 01:19:14,496
- Dad. It's broken.
- What's the matter?

1090
01:19:14,572 --> 01:19:18,531
It's not Eric's fault Mr. Dean.
It was always broken.

1091
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:21,044
The screen just scrambles
when you turn it on.

1092
01:19:21,112 --> 01:19:25,708
- But I need it. Do you have it here?
- Yeah, we have it.

1093
01:19:25,783 --> 01:19:28,183
Eric, just pass it
around the side to me.

1094
01:19:48,506 --> 01:19:51,907
Yes. Hello. Hi.
My name is Leon Newman.

1095
01:19:51,976 --> 01:19:54,410
I'm sorry.
What's your name, ma'am?

1096
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:57,573
Sergeant Miller. Yes,
we live at 454 Beaumont Terrace.

1097
01:19:57,649 --> 01:20:00,413
Actually, my mother lives there.
I'm calling for her.

1098
01:20:00,485 --> 01:20:03,420
There's been a van
sitting outside all day.

1099
01:20:03,488 --> 01:20:05,922
I'm not trying
to get anyone in trouble,

1100
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:08,652
but I think they might be doing drugs
or something in there.

1101
01:20:08,726 --> 01:20:10,751
I was hoping you
could send a car by.

1102
01:20:10,828 --> 01:20:14,559
- Thirty-one Allison,
all available units.

1103
01:20:14,632 --> 01:20:19,695
Check out a white van at 454 Beaumont
for a possible 1031 narcotics violation.

1104
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:22,763
Oh, eat me. That's us.

1105
01:20:59,978 --> 01:21:04,414
Rachel

1106
01:22:22,927 --> 01:22:24,519
Oh, shit.

1107
01:22:54,893 --> 01:22:57,418
Open the door. Open the door!

1108
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:08,798
I thought I told you
to stay the fuck away from me.

1109
01:23:08,873 --> 01:23:11,171
Please, not now. Just drive.

1110
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:21,746
- All right, what happened?
- Rachel's dead.

1111
01:23:26,124 --> 01:23:30,788
I told you not
to contact her. I told you.

1112
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:38,325
Get out of the car.

1113
01:23:38,403 --> 01:23:43,431
- I think I found what they're looking for. My son had it.
- Get out of the fucking car.

1114
01:24:24,782 --> 01:24:26,716
Give me the toy.

1115
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:37,494
You know
why they killed her?

1116
01:24:37,562 --> 01:24:39,826
Trying to make it
look like it was me.

1117
01:24:39,897 --> 01:24:42,092
They had my stuff planted
all over her house.

1118
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:46,865
First, if you're a murder suspect,
you're gonna be easier to find,

1119
01:24:46,938 --> 01:24:50,601
and second, to discredit you,
in case you ever go public against them.

1120
01:24:50,675 --> 01:24:55,339
The N.S.A. Set you up.
It had nothing to do with Rachel

1121
01:24:55,413 --> 01:24:58,246
Absolutely nothing.

1122
01:25:04,589 --> 01:25:07,649
- What have we got?
- We got nothing.

1123
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:10,660
Pull up everything
we have on tape so far.

1124
01:25:10,728 --> 01:25:12,696
The square,
the house surveillance.

1125
01:25:12,764 --> 01:25:15,699
Van, give me the sat imagery
of the hotel roof.

1126
01:25:15,767 --> 01:25:21,034
Okay, here. These are the parametrics for
the space vehicle during data acquisition.

1127
01:25:21,105 --> 01:25:23,767
Can we take a look at this guy
who's helping him?

1128
01:25:26,444 --> 01:25:28,469
Can you get
a feature extraction?

1129
01:25:28,546 --> 01:25:31,310
Mm-mmm.
He never looks up.

1130
01:25:31,382 --> 01:25:33,942
- He's smart.
- Why does he have to look up?

1131
01:25:34,018 --> 01:25:38,114
The satellite's about 155 miles above
the earth. It can only look straight down.

1132
01:25:38,189 --> 01:25:41,124
- That's kind of limited.
- Maybe you can design a new one.

1133
01:25:41,192 --> 01:25:42,750
Maybe I will, idiot.

1134
01:25:45,563 --> 01:25:48,088
Stay put.
I need some food. I need to eat.

1135
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:52,227
? Rocking around
the Christmas tree?

1136
01:25:52,303 --> 01:25:56,034
? Let the Christmas
spirit ring?

1137
01:25:56,107 --> 01:25:59,008
? Later we'll have
some pumpkin pie?

1138
01:25:59,077 --> 01:26:02,274
? And we'll do
some caroling?

1139
01:26:02,346 --> 01:26:05,281
? You will get
a sentiment...?

1140
01:26:07,552 --> 01:26:10,453
- Hello.
- Yeah, it's me.

1141
01:26:10,521 --> 01:26:14,252
- Oh, it's you, asshole. What are you calling me for?
- Shut up and listen.

1142
01:26:14,325 --> 01:26:17,556
Go to the house. Go.
Do not call Carla.

1143
01:26:17,628 --> 01:26:20,597
Rachel Banks is dead. The papers
will make it sound like I killed her.

1144
01:26:20,665 --> 01:26:23,793
Tell her
that I didn't do it.

1145
01:26:23,868 --> 01:26:27,702
Make sure she goes. Get her
out of there. Tell 'em I love 'em.

1146
01:26:27,772 --> 01:26:33,506
The call is coming from 840 McClean,
Baltimore, between Hood and St. Anne's.

1147
01:26:33,578 --> 01:26:35,205
Copy that. Yes!

1148
01:26:54,398 --> 01:26:56,332
What's up, man?

1149
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,200
We're gonna have to look at your
surveillance tapes for the last 20 minutes.

1150
01:27:00,271 --> 01:27:05,004
- Hey, Larry!
- The surveillance footage is coming in now from Pratt.

1151
01:27:05,076 --> 01:27:07,476
Freeze it and process it
for face recognition.

1152
01:27:16,287 --> 01:27:19,654
Pratt, do we see
which way the car went?

1153
01:27:19,724 --> 01:27:23,319
No, sir. This kid here at the register
thinks that it might have went south.

1154
01:27:23,394 --> 01:27:25,555
Unfortunately,
the shot's too tight.

1155
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:28,827
I got make, model and color,
but the plates are phony.

1156
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:32,836
- Order satellite coverage on this sector.
- It's already done.

1157
01:27:46,384 --> 01:27:50,445
- You planning a quick getaway?
- Yeah, ever since I met you.

1158
01:28:12,844 --> 01:28:16,109
I hate to see the chicken
that lives in this coop.

1159
01:28:18,182 --> 01:28:22,585
This is where I work.
This has been my office for 15 years.

1160
01:28:22,654 --> 01:28:28,149
It's completely secure. Copper wire
mesh keeps the radio signals out.

1161
01:28:31,663 --> 01:28:35,224
This is the satellite
imagery of the convenience store.

1162
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:38,167
- They're in El Camino.
- Eighty-six.

1163
01:28:40,405 --> 01:28:45,934
- There it is.
- John, give us LAT 30, 64 minutes, LONG 72, 29 minutes.

1164
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:50,174
- That's affirmative.
- There they are.

1165
01:28:50,248 --> 01:28:52,182
Coming in from top left.

1166
01:28:55,019 --> 01:28:57,078
Let's get them.

1167
01:28:59,357 --> 01:29:01,917
I call it the jar.

1168
01:29:01,993 --> 01:29:04,655
No phone or utility lines
coming in.

1169
01:29:04,729 --> 01:29:07,527
Self -contained.
Unplugged from the world

1170
01:29:07,598 --> 01:29:10,761
Nothing for a wire bug
to piggyback in on.

1171
01:29:10,835 --> 01:29:14,464
That leaves transmitters. It's easy
enough to signal-sweep for those.

1172
01:29:14,539 --> 01:29:18,373
Signal-sweeping for transmitters.
You're just a party animal

1173
01:29:19,944 --> 01:29:22,640
The government's
been in bed...

1174
01:29:22,714 --> 01:29:24,841
with the entire telecommunications
industry since the '40s.

1175
01:29:24,916 --> 01:29:26,850
They've infected everything.

1176
01:29:26,918 --> 01:29:30,854
They can get into your bank statements,
your computer files, e-mail

1177
01:29:30,922 --> 01:29:32,856
listen
to your phone calls.

1178
01:29:32,924 --> 01:29:37,623
- My wife's been saying that for years.
- Every wire, every airwave.

1179
01:29:37,695 --> 01:29:42,496
The more technology you use, the easier
it is for them to keep tabs on you.

1180
01:29:42,567 --> 01:29:47,402
It's a brave new world out there.
At least it better be.

1181
01:30:04,122 --> 01:30:08,491
There it goes.
It's some kind of simple encryption.

1182
01:30:08,559 --> 01:30:12,017
Oh, conspiracy theorists
of the world, unite.

1183
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:15,122
It's more than a theory with me.
I'm a former conspirer.

1184
01:30:16,601 --> 01:30:20,594
I used to work for the N.S.A.
I was a communication analyst.

1185
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:23,105
Listen to international calls,
calls from foreign nationalists.

1186
01:30:23,174 --> 01:30:26,234
That G.P.S. Tracking device we found
in your cellular telephone?

1187
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:29,609
I designed one of the first models
in that series.

1188
01:30:37,088 --> 01:30:42,458
Fort Meade has 18 acres
of mainframe computers underground.

1189
01:30:42,527 --> 01:30:46,930
You're talking on the phone and you use
the word, "bomb," "president," "Allah,"

1190
01:30:46,998 --> 01:30:49,626
any of a hundred key words,
the computer recognizes it,

1191
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:53,602
automatically records it, red flags it
for analysis; that was 20 years ago.

1192
01:31:00,545 --> 01:31:03,207
You know the Hubble Telescope
that looks up to the stars?

1193
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:07,445
They've got over a hundred spy satellites
looking down at us. That's classified.

1194
01:31:07,518 --> 01:31:11,454
In the old days, we actually had
to tap a wire into your phone line.

1195
01:31:11,522 --> 01:31:14,047
Now calls bouncing around on satellite,
they snatch right out of the air.

1196
01:31:17,295 --> 01:31:19,058
What's this?

1197
01:31:24,068 --> 01:31:27,936
- That's Phil Hamersly.
- Jesus Christ.

1198
01:31:36,747 --> 01:31:40,183
Who's this guy? I'm gonna check
the executive N.S.A. Files.

1199
01:31:40,251 --> 01:31:42,310
Let's run
the photo ID. On him.

1200
01:31:53,931 --> 01:31:56,263
Reynolds, Thomas Brian.
Born 9-11-40.

1201
01:31:56,334 --> 01:32:00,327
Attended Episcopal School D.C.
B.A., Harvard, PhD, Princeton.

1202
01:32:00,404 --> 01:32:02,702
On loan from the State Department
since '95.

1203
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:06,265
This guy's not a professional
He's a politician.

1204
01:32:11,015 --> 01:32:14,451
Aw, shit! Take that.

1205
01:32:14,519 --> 01:32:17,784
- When was the last time you contacted somebody?
- When we stopped for food.

1206
01:32:17,855 --> 01:32:20,983
- Didn't I tell you not to use the telephone?
- I called from a pay phone.

1207
01:32:21,058 --> 01:32:24,550
- What did I tell you?
- You told me no calls.

1208
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:27,120
I told you no calls.

1209
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:31,225
- Get the cat. Get the cat.
- Hey, man...

1210
01:32:31,302 --> 01:32:33,566
- what's the cat's name?
- Babe.

1211
01:32:33,638 --> 01:32:37,802
Come here, baby. Come here, baby.
Baby, come, come. Come here!

1212
01:32:43,948 --> 01:32:46,041
Shit!

1213
01:32:50,454 --> 01:32:51,512
Goddamn it.

1214
01:33:02,266 --> 01:33:04,325
All right, baby,
what do we got?

1215
01:33:07,772 --> 01:33:10,332
What the...

1216
01:33:17,782 --> 01:33:23,015
- Subjects exiting.
- Williams, get the hell out of there.

1217
01:33:23,087 --> 01:33:25,419
This bitch is gonna blow!
Go, go, go!

1218
01:33:43,975 --> 01:33:46,739
Come on! Go!

1219
01:33:50,648 --> 01:33:52,377
Move! Move! Move!

1220
01:34:00,691 --> 01:34:02,556
Move! Move!

1221
01:34:13,304 --> 01:34:15,397
- What is happening?
- I blew up the building.

1222
01:34:15,473 --> 01:34:17,771
- Why?
- Because you made a phone call!

1223
01:34:27,885 --> 01:34:30,683
- Tell him to pull over!
- Pull the vehicle over now!

1224
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:38,158
Pull over now!

1225
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:55,975
Pump action!

1226
01:35:13,464 --> 01:35:14,658
Gosh damn!

1227
01:35:19,603 --> 01:35:21,662
Fuel line
must be broken.

1228
01:35:22,973 --> 01:35:25,965
- Get it out! Goddamn!
- Stop the car!

1229
01:35:34,819 --> 01:35:37,481
- Where's the disk?
- Shit!

1230
01:35:37,555 --> 01:35:41,924
No! Shit! Look,
is there any way to save it?

1231
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:44,256
- Ah, that's ruined.
- What do we do?

1232
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:47,828
- I'm leaving.
- Subjects heading west across the coal fields.

1233
01:35:47,898 --> 01:35:49,923
- You're leaving?
- The disk is gone.

1234
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:52,094
We've got nothing.
It's over.

1235
01:36:04,415 --> 01:36:07,350
We have control
Put down your weapons.

1236
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:18,789
You think I wanted that idiot
to put that goddamn disk...

1237
01:36:18,863 --> 01:36:21,024
who gives a fuck
what you wanted?

1238
01:36:21,098 --> 01:36:24,261
Since you've shown up, Rachel's dead
and the N.S.A.'s onto me.

1239
01:36:28,105 --> 01:36:31,438
Onto you? What do you mean
onto you? Onto you about what?

1240
01:36:31,509 --> 01:36:33,943
You're not the target.
I am.

1241
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:48,657
We got him.
He's right in front of us.

1242
01:36:50,728 --> 01:36:52,662
Come on, come on.

1243
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:58,498
We got him.
He's got nowhere to go.

1244
01:37:08,979 --> 01:37:11,607
Air One to ground, they're
somewhere between the trains.

1245
01:37:12,817 --> 01:37:15,342
Get the fuck
away from me.

1246
01:37:16,854 --> 01:37:18,481
Damn it!

1247
01:37:18,556 --> 01:37:20,615
We're coming back around.

1248
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:24,718
- You're blowing my whole life.
- What life? You live in a fucking jar...

1249
01:37:24,795 --> 01:37:26,729
so the world
can't touch you.

1250
01:37:26,797 --> 01:37:28,765
And you didn't give
a shit about Rachel!

1251
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:31,427
Just some package
under seat number 32.

1252
01:37:34,171 --> 01:37:38,073
- Come on! - Do you have
a problem? - Go on! Do it!

1253
01:37:39,276 --> 01:37:42,643
I'm all you've got!
And you're all I've got.

1254
01:37:50,588 --> 01:37:52,613
Heading west
towards the freeway.

1255
01:38:03,901 --> 01:38:06,495
- Get out of the fucking car!
- All right.

1256
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:08,470
- Come on. Get out.
- All right.

1257
01:38:08,539 --> 01:38:11,007
- Don't do this to me.
- Tell your story walking.

1258
01:38:11,075 --> 01:38:14,010
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't... Oh, for God sakes.

1259
01:38:14,078 --> 01:38:16,979
- Thanks for your help back at the train.
- Wait a minute.

1260
01:38:18,983 --> 01:38:20,974
Oh, for Jesus...

1261
01:38:21,051 --> 01:38:25,818
Air One to ground, I think we lost them.
They're somewhere beneath the overpass.

1262
01:38:34,398 --> 01:38:38,095
Well, you certainly carjacked
a really nice car.

1263
01:38:38,169 --> 01:38:42,128
This is a piece of shit.
What are you talking about?

1264
01:38:42,206 --> 01:38:46,472
I need sugar, you know.
I'm getting cranky.

1265
01:38:46,544 --> 01:38:48,478
Getting?

1266
01:38:48,546 --> 01:38:52,642
I'm hypoglycemic. My body
can't metabolize the sugar, so...

1267
01:38:52,716 --> 01:38:55,708
So you're a pain in the ass
when you don't eat.

1268
01:38:55,786 --> 01:38:57,720
Basically.

1269
01:38:57,788 --> 01:39:00,256
Yeah. Right.

1270
01:39:00,324 --> 01:39:03,384
- We should eat then.
- Let's do that.

1271
01:39:03,527 --> 01:39:05,927
His real name is Edward Lyle.

1272
01:39:05,996 --> 01:39:09,955
Graduated from Drexel University.
Enlisted in the army, 1953.

1273
01:39:10,034 --> 01:39:13,162
Rapid promotion, excelled
at intelligence and communications.

1274
01:39:13,237 --> 01:39:17,105
- Join N.S.A. In '65.
- Of course.

1275
01:39:17,174 --> 01:39:20,666
He was in the agency till 1980 when
he vanished and went underground.

1276
01:39:20,744 --> 01:39:24,077
- Hasn't been seen since.
- That's a long time.

1277
01:39:24,148 --> 01:39:26,708
Lots of black bags,
lots of deleteds.

1278
01:39:26,784 --> 01:39:29,617
He's familiar
with explosives, obviously.

1279
01:39:29,687 --> 01:39:33,851
His last assignment, he went into Iran,
late '78, after the Shah.

1280
01:39:33,924 --> 01:39:36,859
- This is our problem.
- This man.

1281
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:45,262
So, we were helping
the secret police supply weapons...

1282
01:39:45,336 --> 01:39:47,930
to the Afghani rebels
fighting the Soviets.

1283
01:39:48,005 --> 01:39:51,304
My partner and I were on the eastern border
monitoring Soviet military transmissions.

1284
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:54,071
It was kind of fun actually.
I liked the Iranians.

1285
01:39:54,144 --> 01:39:58,080
Back in Tehran, the hard-liners
seized the embassy,

1286
01:39:58,148 --> 01:40:00,844
and overnight,
the whole country changed.

1287
01:40:00,918 --> 01:40:04,410
People we'd been working with,
they turned on us. I got out.

1288
01:40:04,488 --> 01:40:06,422
My partner didn't.

1289
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:08,424
By the time I got home,

1290
01:40:08,492 --> 01:40:10,983
the whole mission had become
a press disaster waiting to happen.

1291
01:40:11,061 --> 01:40:13,427
Aiding and abetting
the new enemy.

1292
01:40:13,497 --> 01:40:16,762
The agency conveniently
forgot I existed.

1293
01:40:18,068 --> 01:40:22,698
I don't blame them.
It's what they had to do.

1294
01:40:22,773 --> 01:40:25,469
I loved the agency.

1295
01:40:25,542 --> 01:40:28,909
I loved the work.
I loved the people.

1296
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:31,004
It was my whole life.

1297
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:35,074
Your partner
was Rachel's father.

1298
01:40:35,152 --> 01:40:38,553
Yeah. The idea was...

1299
01:40:38,622 --> 01:40:43,457
The idea always was that if one of us got
out, he'd take care of the other's family.

1300
01:40:43,527 --> 01:40:46,018
Rachel was all he had.

1301
01:40:46,096 --> 01:40:48,587
So she became
my promise to him.

1302
01:40:48,666 --> 01:40:51,499
- Here you go, hon.
- Thank you.

1303
01:40:55,539 --> 01:40:58,337
Maybe we can still keep
that promise in a way.

1304
01:40:58,409 --> 01:41:01,003
You're a threat now,
just like I was.

1305
01:41:01,078 --> 01:41:03,342
Threat to whom? To them?

1306
01:41:03,414 --> 01:41:07,111
To your family, friends,
everyone you know, everyone you meet.

1307
01:41:07,184 --> 01:41:11,780
That's why I went away and didn't
come back. You gotta go away, Robert.

1308
01:41:11,855 --> 01:41:14,619
No, I don't think so.
This is my life.

1309
01:41:14,692 --> 01:41:17,126
I worked hard for it,
and I want it back.

1310
01:41:17,194 --> 01:41:19,992
I grew up without a father.
I know what that is.

1311
01:41:20,064 --> 01:41:22,726
And I will not allow
my family to go through that.

1312
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,859
Mommy,

1313
01:41:24,935 --> 01:41:27,062
I don't wanna go home.

1314
01:41:32,609 --> 01:41:35,203
Wanna take
a poke at me?

1315
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:39,213
- Come on.
- I don't hit senior citizens.

1316
01:41:41,885 --> 01:41:44,479
Oh, come here, Babe.

1317
01:41:44,555 --> 01:41:45,579
Come up here. Come on.

1318
01:41:46,757 --> 01:41:50,318
In guerilla warfare, you try
to use your weaknesses as strengths.

1319
01:41:50,394 --> 01:41:53,386
- Such as?
- Well,

1320
01:41:53,464 --> 01:41:58,959
if they're big and you're small,
then you're mobile and they're slow.

1321
01:41:59,036 --> 01:42:01,895
You're hidden
and they're exposed.

1322
01:42:01,972 --> 01:42:05,481
Only fight battles you know you can win.
That's the way the Vietcong did it.

1323
01:42:05,558 --> 01:42:09,942
You capture their weapons and you
use them against them the next time.

1324
01:42:10,011 --> 01:42:13,777
That way they're supplying you.
You grow stronger as they grow weaker.

1325
01:42:15,283 --> 01:42:18,081
- Hey, try these.
- Can I have something else, please?

1326
01:42:18,153 --> 01:42:20,519
- Yeah. Here.
- Never mind.

1327
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:26,550
- That's my best aloha shirt.
- Well, say "aloha" to it.

1328
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:39,304
- Steve, how you doing? Need some gear.
- Howdy. Help yourself.

1329
01:42:39,374 --> 01:42:42,537
- Hi, Bill. - Say hi to
Bill. - How you doing, Bill?

1330
01:42:42,611 --> 01:42:46,445
Steve, where's the two gigahertz
video transmitters?

1331
01:42:46,514 --> 01:42:49,005
Right behind you,
second shelf.

1332
01:42:49,084 --> 01:42:51,609
Steve? I thought you said
his name was Bill.

1333
01:42:51,686 --> 01:42:53,620
No. You're Bill.

1334
01:42:53,688 --> 01:42:57,784
- IF I'm Bill, let me know I'm Bill.
- I just did.

1335
01:42:57,859 --> 01:43:00,828
The president has not
committed himself,

1336
01:43:00,895 --> 01:43:05,298
but he does recognize that we
do need something in this area.

1337
01:43:05,367 --> 01:43:08,165
And I think he will come to see
that this bill will, in the end,

1338
01:43:08,236 --> 01:43:11,763
provide the kind
of security that this...

1339
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,139
- what security?
- The kind of security he's gonna need.

1340
01:43:18,647 --> 01:43:20,808
Ah, here we go.

1341
01:43:20,882 --> 01:43:24,579
Modified cell phone
interfaced with laptop computer.

1342
01:43:24,653 --> 01:43:27,781
- Creates an enormously powerful tool
- what is that?

1343
01:43:27,856 --> 01:43:32,759
This is Congressman Albert's
home address and his cellular E.S.N.

1344
01:43:32,827 --> 01:43:35,591
Now, we reprogram
our phone...

1345
01:43:35,664 --> 01:43:40,294
with Congressman Albert's E.S.N.,
and you know what we got?

1346
01:43:40,368 --> 01:43:43,303
Hi, sweetie.
We just landed. So, how are the kids?

1347
01:43:43,371 --> 01:43:45,805
- Melissa has a fever.
- She okay?

1348
01:43:45,874 --> 01:43:48,206
She's fine. When will you have
some time to talk?

1349
01:43:48,276 --> 01:43:51,507
About 30, 40 minutes.
I'll be in suite 59, Lincoln Hotel

1350
01:43:51,579 --> 01:43:54,066
You're a dangerous man.

1351
01:43:54,199 --> 01:43:55,632
Oh, shit.

1352
01:43:59,687 --> 01:44:01,655
Aw, shit.

1353
01:44:16,136 --> 01:44:18,366
- Say something.
- Excuse me?

1354
01:44:18,439 --> 01:44:20,737
- Louder.
- What are you talking about?

1355
01:44:20,808 --> 01:44:22,799
That's good.

1356
01:44:24,078 --> 01:44:26,911
- Wort they look in there?
- That's the idea.

1357
01:44:26,981 --> 01:44:29,176
Great plan.

1358
01:44:30,751 --> 01:44:33,185
I've been a law-abiding
citizen my whole life.

1359
01:44:33,254 --> 01:44:38,658
One day with you, I'm shooting and...
breaking... I have to go to the bathroom.

1360
01:44:38,726 --> 01:44:42,822
- Rest well.
- Thanks. Bye.

1361
01:44:44,231 --> 01:44:46,165
Good work, guys.

1362
01:44:53,574 --> 01:44:56,168
Hmm.

1363
01:45:04,251 --> 01:45:07,379
We got him.

1364
01:45:07,454 --> 01:45:09,388
Yeah, go for it,
Mr. Congressman.

1365
01:45:15,629 --> 01:45:19,190
- You're too young to watch this part here.
- Yeah, so is she.

1366
01:45:32,746 --> 01:45:35,476
Yeah, could you send somebody
up to my room, please?

1367
01:45:35,549 --> 01:45:38,541
Yes, this is Christa,
the congressmans aide.

1368
01:45:38,619 --> 01:45:42,214
- How the hell am I supposed
to know what it is?

1369
01:45:42,289 --> 01:45:44,883
I'm just a congressman,
for Christ's sake.

1370
01:45:44,959 --> 01:45:46,893
Security expert tells me...

1371
01:45:46,961 --> 01:45:51,057
it's like a PX-73 burst transmitter,
whatever the hell that is.

1372
01:45:51,131 --> 01:45:53,497
Except it's
much more sophisticated.

1373
01:45:53,567 --> 01:45:57,388
Of course I'm going to send it down.
That's not the...

1374
01:45:57,521 --> 01:46:01,013
Because I want to know
who in the hell put it there, Jim.

1375
01:46:12,636 --> 01:46:15,264
- Hi there.
- Hola. Si?

1376
01:46:19,609 --> 01:46:22,963
La electricidad? Oh, si.

1377
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:33,464
The category, Barbara.

1378
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:37,499
This is very irritating.
Get one channel and stay with it.

1379
01:46:40,113 --> 01:46:43,173
- Stop jumping...
- we're on TV!

1380
01:46:43,249 --> 01:46:45,376
- Stop jumping around.
- We're on TV!

1381
01:47:02,669 --> 01:47:05,661
Okay, these are the ones
they wanted us to find.

1382
01:47:05,739 --> 01:47:08,367
They're all ours.
We made 'em.

1383
01:47:08,441 --> 01:47:11,376
Thomas, could
I see you a second?

1384
01:47:17,317 --> 01:47:21,583
Look, there's $140,000 here.
I have no idea where it came from.

1385
01:47:21,654 --> 01:47:24,919
- What are you talking about? An extra 140?
- Yeah.

1386
01:47:24,991 --> 01:47:26,925
Look, it's right here.

1387
01:47:26,993 --> 01:47:30,895
Two separate $70,000 deposits
on the same day.

1388
01:47:30,964 --> 01:47:33,728
Yes, I see the deposits,
thank you.

1389
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:37,133
- I have no idea where they came from.
- Tom.

1390
01:47:37,203 --> 01:47:39,763
I'm sorry.
That was Shaffer.

1391
01:47:39,839 --> 01:47:42,603
He wants to see
all department heads at 0800.

1392
01:47:43,743 --> 01:47:46,678
You're going in
on Sunday.

1393
01:47:46,746 --> 01:47:49,510
- That's just great.
- Emily.

1394
01:47:49,582 --> 01:47:51,914
This is
your separate account.

1395
01:47:51,985 --> 01:47:55,512
- I have no idea...
- By the way, who is Christa?

1396
01:47:58,425 --> 01:48:00,916
"Eternally yours"?

1397
01:48:02,662 --> 01:48:05,722
I want
the entire history of this device,

1398
01:48:05,799 --> 01:48:07,799
from birth to abortion,
on my desk in two hours.

1399
01:48:07,834 --> 01:48:09,800
From birth to abortion,
on my desk in two hours.

1400
01:48:11,371 --> 01:48:14,534
I want the name
of the tech who made it.

1401
01:48:16,609 --> 01:48:20,045
I want to know
who authorized its use,

1402
01:48:20,113 --> 01:48:23,344
who checked it out
from inventory,

1403
01:48:23,416 --> 01:48:25,680
and for what purpose.

1404
01:48:29,122 --> 01:48:32,959
Most important,
how on God's green earth...

1405
01:48:33,092 --> 01:48:36,084
it got into Congressman
Albert's hotel room.

1406
01:48:36,162 --> 01:48:38,995
Listen, people, everyone here
knows where this is going.

1407
01:48:39,065 --> 01:48:43,593
Now, if this
was a legit op...

1408
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:49,904
If this was a legit op,

1409
01:48:49,976 --> 01:48:53,810
and I can't possibly see
how it could be, then so be it.

1410
01:48:56,148 --> 01:49:00,084
But if this was somebody's
unilateral wet dream,

1411
01:49:00,152 --> 01:49:03,485
then that somebody
is going to prison.

1412
01:49:05,624 --> 01:49:07,558
It's him.

1413
01:49:09,695 --> 01:49:12,391
- Yes?
- Thomas Reynols?

1414
01:49:12,465 --> 01:49:14,330
Who is this?

1415
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:17,198
I have that environmental study
you've been looking for.

1416
01:49:18,771 --> 01:49:20,705
Can we discuss this
in person?

1417
01:49:20,773 --> 01:49:23,503
Be at the corner
of Iowa and Third at 3:00.

1418
01:49:23,576 --> 01:49:28,639
I'll be there at 4:00.

1419
01:49:28,714 --> 01:49:33,617
We have to get a confession out of
this guy, on tape and fast, okay?

1420
01:49:36,389 --> 01:49:40,155
Oh, you shouldn't have. This thing
must've cost 12, 13 bucks easy.

1421
01:49:40,226 --> 01:49:43,627
Now, they expect me
to be wired, all right?

1422
01:49:43,696 --> 01:49:46,130
So what they'll do
is they'll sweep me.

1423
01:49:46,198 --> 01:49:49,964
But once they're done,
I'm gonna give you the signal

1424
01:49:50,036 --> 01:49:52,368
- and you turn the mike on.
- What's the signal?

1425
01:49:52,438 --> 01:49:54,565
Putting gum in my mouth.

1426
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:58,542
So after the signal
you turn the mike on. Turn it on now.

1427
01:49:58,611 --> 01:50:01,478
- Let's try it.
- Okay, off.

1428
01:50:01,547 --> 01:50:02,844
Good.

1429
01:50:02,915 --> 01:50:07,249
To be safe, they'll try to scan
all the frequencies...

1430
01:50:07,319 --> 01:50:09,253
to try to track you down.

1431
01:50:09,321 --> 01:50:13,052
If these guys are good, and they're
probably very good, in a location like this,

1432
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:15,150
they'll have you
in five, six minutes.

1433
01:50:15,227 --> 01:50:19,721
So in four minutes time, after you turn
that tape on, regardless of what's happening,

1434
01:50:19,799 --> 01:50:22,165
you get out that door.
You got that?

1435
01:50:23,302 --> 01:50:26,155
No.

1436
01:50:39,183 --> 01:50:42,880
Record. On-off.

1437
01:50:42,954 --> 01:50:45,684
All right,
let the games begin.

1438
01:50:47,291 --> 01:50:49,384
Hey there.

1439
01:50:51,329 --> 01:50:55,698
Edward Lyle. Policeman.

1440
01:50:55,767 --> 01:50:58,759
- Very clever.
- Why don't you call your friends over.

1441
01:50:58,836 --> 01:51:01,202
Pratt.

1442
01:51:07,311 --> 01:51:11,042
Step towards the fence for me.
This won't take a second.

1443
01:51:16,487 --> 01:51:19,456
He's clear, sir.

1444
01:51:19,524 --> 01:51:22,652
So, do you have the tape?

1445
01:51:22,727 --> 01:51:26,254
- Yes, I have.
- Here?

1446
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:28,798
- No.
- Then what is there to talk about?

1447
01:51:28,866 --> 01:51:31,164
- Money.
- Money?

1448
01:51:31,235 --> 01:51:35,433
I was wondering why I hadn't seen it
on CNN. Have you looked at the tape?

1449
01:51:37,375 --> 01:51:40,572
- What's on it?
- Your ugly -ass face is on it.

1450
01:51:40,645 --> 01:51:43,842
It shows the death
of Congressman Hamersly.

1451
01:51:43,915 --> 01:51:46,679
The needle
behind the ear.

1452
01:51:46,751 --> 01:51:50,346
- Three faces, readily identifiable.
- How much you want for it?

1453
01:51:50,421 --> 01:51:53,788
- 1.8 million dollars.
- What?

1454
01:51:53,858 --> 01:51:56,326
And my file cleared.
I want my life back.

1455
01:51:56,394 --> 01:52:00,330
My 1980 salary with cost of living
increases for the past 18 years.

1456
01:52:00,398 --> 01:52:01,990
- Plus interest.
- Oh, shit.

1457
01:52:02,066 --> 01:52:06,025
Plus the retirement package for
executive level E-16. Comes to 1.85.

1458
01:52:06,103 --> 01:52:10,301
- I rounded it down.
- And for this, I get the tape and Mr. Dean.

1459
01:52:10,374 --> 01:52:13,537
- Actually, it's Dean that has the tape.
- Aw, shit.

1460
01:52:13,611 --> 01:52:17,274
- What does he want?
- He wants to know why you killed the girl

1461
01:52:17,348 --> 01:52:22,012
- what girl you talking about?
- I tried to explain it to him, but I couldn't figure it out.

1462
01:52:22,086 --> 01:52:25,351
You're getting self -righteous on me?
Because I've seen your file.

1463
01:52:25,423 --> 01:52:28,187
- Not exactly a beacon of light.
- Yeah, I agree.

1464
01:52:28,259 --> 01:52:31,626
It's just that...
You kill Hamersly, okay.

1465
01:52:31,696 --> 01:52:33,857
I wouldn't have,
but I understand the argument.

1466
01:52:33,931 --> 01:52:35,865
But why the girl?

1467
01:52:35,933 --> 01:52:38,128
Just to get to some schmuck
that barely knows you're after him?

1468
01:52:38,202 --> 01:52:42,138
- Schmuck?
- We never dealt with domestic. With us, it was always war.

1469
01:52:42,206 --> 01:52:45,972
You won the war. Now we're fighting
the peace. It's a lot more volatile.

1470
01:52:46,043 --> 01:52:49,069
- Does he take this long
doing everything?

1471
01:52:49,146 --> 01:52:53,708
Now we've got ten million crackpots out
there with sniper scopes, sarin gas and C-4.

1472
01:52:53,784 --> 01:52:56,981
Ten-year-ols go on the Net, downloading
encryption we can barely break,

1473
01:52:57,054 --> 01:53:01,548
not to mention instructions on how
to make a low-yiel nuclear device.

1474
01:53:01,626 --> 01:53:05,027
Privacy's been dead for 30 years
because we can't risk it.

1475
01:53:05,096 --> 01:53:08,588
The only privacy that's left is the
inside of your head. Maybe that's enough.

1476
01:53:08,666 --> 01:53:12,329
- Get him to say something.
- We've located subject. Keep him talking.

1477
01:53:12,403 --> 01:53:16,430
You think we're the enemy of democracy,
you and I? We're democracy's last hope.

1478
01:53:16,507 --> 01:53:18,441
There's always
going to be power.

1479
01:53:18,509 --> 01:53:22,070
You shouldn't be there, Robert.
But if you are, get out.

1480
01:53:22,146 --> 01:53:24,114
Get out
and follow procedure.

1481
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:28,412
Get out now, Robert.
Get out!

1482
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:49,966
- You gonna shoot a policeman? You wouldn't get a block.
- Get in.

1483
01:53:54,679 --> 01:53:56,977
- Yeah?
- Tom?

1484
01:53:57,048 --> 01:54:00,040
- Emily, what is it?
- Tom, our Visa card's been canceled...

1485
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:02,780
- Did you try the American Express?
- Yeah, I tried that too.

1486
01:54:02,854 --> 01:54:06,551
- I can't deal with this now. I'll
call you back. - Listen, I- - No, Tom...

1487
01:54:06,624 --> 01:54:11,561
Credit cards not working? That can be
a real pain in the ass, can't it?

1488
01:54:20,738 --> 01:54:22,706
Come in.

1489
01:54:26,144 --> 01:54:28,237
- Asshole.
- Great plan.

1490
01:54:35,987 --> 01:54:39,479
Tell him to give me the tape.

1491
01:54:39,557 --> 01:54:42,219
- What guarantees do we have if...
- None.

1492
01:54:43,594 --> 01:54:45,528
None?

1493
01:54:45,596 --> 01:54:50,499
Does everybody here know that you
killed Phil Hamersly and Rachel Banks?

1494
01:54:50,568 --> 01:54:53,935
This guy is going down, and he's
going to take all of you with him.

1495
01:54:54,005 --> 01:54:59,602
Trust me on this. Aah! Goddamn!
Oh, you son of a bitch!

1496
01:54:59,677 --> 01:55:02,237
Rachel Banks is not the issue.
Hamersly is.

1497
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:04,713
He was killed for a purpose.
Where's the tape?

1498
01:55:06,484 --> 01:55:09,214
Oh, shit.

1499
01:55:09,287 --> 01:55:11,847
Where's the tape?

1500
01:55:13,658 --> 01:55:15,922
- Tom!
- All right.

1501
01:55:15,993 --> 01:55:18,723
- I'll give it to you.
- Thank you.

1502
01:55:18,796 --> 01:55:22,391
What are you doing, you moron?
That's our only leverage!

1503
01:55:22,467 --> 01:55:27,530
- For Christ's sake.
- I'm the moron? Me? No, you're the moron!

1504
01:55:27,605 --> 01:55:31,701
- Where is it? - Washington and
Fourth. - Washington and Fourth.

1505
01:55:39,283 --> 01:55:41,615
- That's my blender.
- So?

1506
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:45,218
Fourth and washington.

1507
01:55:51,561 --> 01:55:53,722
- Where is it?
- The restaurant.

1508
01:55:53,797 --> 01:55:57,597
11169 Fourth Street.
Stand by to enter.

1509
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:11,180
Wait a second.

1510
01:56:12,749 --> 01:56:18,449
- See if you can get the plate
on that van. - T-S-1-8-7-8-5.

1511
01:56:18,521 --> 01:56:22,981
- You go in with Pratt and bring it out.
- I don't think so.

1512
01:56:25,094 --> 01:56:30,555
- Oh, you don't think so?
- IF I go in there and I bring that tape out, I'm a dead man.

1513
01:56:30,633 --> 01:56:33,158
We go together,
you and me.

1514
01:56:33,236 --> 01:56:35,500
You view the tape,
you sign off on it.

1515
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:38,973
They let Brill go, you take the tape
home, everyone has a Merry Christmas.

1516
01:56:39,042 --> 01:56:42,409
What assurances do I have
that you haven't copied that tape?

1517
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:45,175
You think
I want copies?

1518
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:47,648
That tape has been
the bane of my existence.

1519
01:56:47,717 --> 01:56:50,880
I wish the one that we have
was at the bottom of the Chesapeake.

1520
01:56:50,954 --> 01:56:53,422
I wanna go home.

1521
01:56:59,162 --> 01:57:03,360
- Give me a piece.
- Yes, sir.

1522
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:07,229
All right, you and me.

1523
01:57:08,404 --> 01:57:11,771
And Pratt and Bingham.

1524
01:57:11,841 --> 01:57:16,175
Fiedler, get one of those
little cameras on Bingham.

1525
01:57:22,485 --> 01:57:26,581
Guess what. It's
a government vehicle. Shit!

1526
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:29,853
I'm going in col.
If I need you, Hicks will call it.

1527
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:36,624
You guys got some food
or something in here?

1528
01:57:36,699 --> 01:57:38,633
Oh, behind you.

1529
01:57:49,546 --> 01:57:54,245
You're either incredibly smart
or incredibly stupid.

1530
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:58,981
We'll see in a minute.
Watch out for the F.B. I

1531
01:58:05,795 --> 01:58:09,231
- I'll be back to get my blender.
- I'll have it gift wrapped.

1532
01:58:14,003 --> 01:58:16,995
It's your show.

1533
01:58:17,073 --> 01:58:20,474
- Isn't that the guy that was here last time?
- You're right.

1534
01:58:29,586 --> 01:58:31,076
No, no. Thank you.

1535
01:58:31,154 --> 01:58:33,520
- You guys like the food?
- Yeah. - It's good food.

1536
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:37,287
- It's good food, huh? I made it.
- Yeah, yeah, sure you made it.

1537
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:40,488
- Come on. Eat your food.
- I am.

1538
01:58:40,563 --> 01:58:44,659
- Boss, black guy's back with a couple creeps.
- Yeah, show him in.

1539
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:53,866
Hey, how you doing?

1540
01:58:53,943 --> 01:58:56,002
What's this, the F.B. I?

1541
01:58:57,580 --> 01:59:00,640
No, sir, Mr. Pintero. This is
the gentleman you wanted to meet.

1542
01:59:00,717 --> 01:59:03,515
- Oh, that's him?
- Yep, that's him.

1543
01:59:03,586 --> 01:59:06,953
- So you made the tape?
- What?

1544
01:59:07,023 --> 01:59:10,459
Did you make the videotape?

1545
01:59:10,526 --> 01:59:13,359
Look, he wants it back.

1546
01:59:13,429 --> 01:59:17,058
Really? I don't give
a shit what he wants.

1547
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:22,504
Could we have
some privacy, please?

1548
01:59:23,773 --> 01:59:26,970
Yeah, maybe we should.

1549
01:59:27,043 --> 01:59:30,012
- Get the kids out of here.
- Come on, boys.

1550
01:59:31,314 --> 01:59:34,010
Get 'em out of here.
Go on.

1551
01:59:34,083 --> 01:59:38,918
Come on! Uncle Paulie
will take you to the zoo later.

1552
01:59:40,990 --> 01:59:43,550
- Ooh, ooh, Hicks.
- What the hell's the matter with him?

1553
01:59:43,626 --> 01:59:47,392
- No, not on the equipment.
We gotta get him... Okay.

1554
01:59:56,673 --> 01:59:58,868
Check this out. Come here.

1555
02:00:00,243 --> 02:00:03,007
Tony, they just pulled
a guy out of the van.

1556
02:00:03,079 --> 02:00:05,604
He's puking and bleeding
all over himself.

1557
02:00:07,917 --> 02:00:11,409
Shit. It's a city cop.

1558
02:00:11,487 --> 02:00:13,421
Hey, Babe.

1559
02:00:16,325 --> 02:00:18,020
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1560
02:00:18,094 --> 02:00:22,224
- He's your friend. Persuade him to give us the tape.
- Hey, look.

1561
02:00:22,298 --> 02:00:25,756
Number one:
He's not my friend.

1562
02:00:25,835 --> 02:00:28,804
- And number two: It's not his tape.
- Whose is it?

1563
02:00:28,871 --> 02:00:32,307
It's mine, okay?
It's mine. I bought it.

1564
02:00:32,375 --> 02:00:34,969
You sol it to him?

1565
02:00:38,081 --> 02:00:40,641
Now, you listen to me.

1566
02:00:43,619 --> 02:00:46,816
Who are you? What the fuck
you trying to do to me?

1567
02:00:46,889 --> 02:00:49,881
- Oh, this looks bad.
- I'm with the federal government.

1568
02:00:49,959 --> 02:00:51,893
The federal government
made a videotape?

1569
02:00:51,961 --> 02:00:54,930
- You guys oughta get in there.
- Wait a minute. Listen.

1570
02:00:54,997 --> 02:00:58,660
Now, we can go get a warrant and come back
with the F.B. I, take anything we want,

1571
02:00:58,735 --> 02:01:01,966
arrest anybody that we want...
just give the man the videotape.

1572
02:01:02,038 --> 02:01:04,472
Only one gonna
get arrested here is you...

1573
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:07,668
for felonious cocksucking with
an attempt to swallow the evidence.

1574
02:01:07,744 --> 02:01:10,008
And you, get the fuck
out of here.

1575
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:12,639
Go get your warrant.
Until then, get out of my joint.

1576
02:01:12,715 --> 02:01:16,583
You gotta get in there! They're gonna
be dead bodies all over the place!

1577
02:01:16,652 --> 02:01:18,745
- Shut up!
- Get in there!

1578
02:01:18,821 --> 02:01:21,949
- Okay, let's go.
- This is it. This is it.

1579
02:01:22,024 --> 02:01:24,925
Krug, take the rear. Jones,
you're in the side entrance.

1580
02:01:26,229 --> 02:01:28,493
What are we waiting for?
Come on; let's go!

1581
02:01:28,564 --> 02:01:31,124
Tony says we wait
until they show up.

1582
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:33,430
- Put the guns away.
- You put your guns away.

1583
02:01:33,503 --> 02:01:36,199
Put it away.
Put it away.

1584
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:43,675
Put it away.
Put it away.

1585
02:01:47,717 --> 02:01:50,447
All right,
I'm putting it away.

1586
02:01:55,858 --> 02:02:00,295
- Now, what will it take for us to get that videotape?
- The end of the worl.

1587
02:02:04,267 --> 02:02:06,565
Let's go.
We're leaving.

1588
02:02:06,636 --> 02:02:09,799
- Put the guns down now.
- Drop your weapons! - No!

1589
02:02:42,638 --> 02:02:44,071
Go! Go! Go!

1590
02:02:52,448 --> 02:02:55,417
- Get your hands up.
- You get your hands up! Drop the gun!

1591
02:02:55,484 --> 02:02:58,351
- On your knees.
- Easy with this guy. He's not one of them.

1592
02:02:58,421 --> 02:03:01,356
Easy, easy. Get up.
Come on.

1593
02:03:01,424 --> 02:03:05,383
- Let's get this place cleaned up.
- Not too stupid after all.

1594
02:03:05,461 --> 02:03:07,861
Let's go.
Let's move it. Come on.

1595
02:03:07,930 --> 02:03:11,764
Right there.
Somebody get the paramedics.

1596
02:03:11,834 --> 02:03:14,598
We need some paramedics in here.
We have 13 bodies in here.

1597
02:03:27,049 --> 02:03:31,076
All right, listen up. Get some ID. S on
these guys. Get these guns out of here.

1598
02:04:01,484 --> 02:04:04,681
This guy is going down. He's
going to take all of you with him.

1599
02:04:04,754 --> 02:04:08,053
- Goddamn!
- Rachel Banks is not the issue.

1600
02:04:08,124 --> 02:04:11,958
Hamersly is the issue. He was killed
for a purpose. Now, where's the tape?

1601
02:04:15,264 --> 02:04:17,357
Why did you record it?

1602
02:04:17,433 --> 02:04:21,426
Okay, uh, first of all,
we were there for technical support.

1603
02:04:21,504 --> 02:04:25,133
- And, uh, we had no idea...
- Do they know that Reynols is dead?

1604
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:27,301
- Yeah. - They know
all that? - Right.

1605
02:04:27,377 --> 02:04:29,345
But they're
still stalling.

1606
02:04:29,412 --> 02:04:32,313
- A tape.
- A tape of it.

1607
02:04:32,382 --> 02:04:35,351
- What did you think was going on?
- I thought it was an S.T.O.

1608
02:04:35,418 --> 02:04:38,649
- S.T.O.?
- Standard Training Op.

1609
02:04:43,025 --> 02:04:46,961
Congressman! Does this mean
the privacy bill is dead, Congressman?

1610
02:04:47,029 --> 02:04:51,363
In its current form, yes, but the issue
is still very much alive, I can assure you,

1611
02:04:51,434 --> 02:04:54,631
unless, of course, no one worries
about national security anymore.

1612
02:05:03,946 --> 02:05:06,938
We knew that we had
to monitor our enemies.

1613
02:05:07,016 --> 02:05:08,950
We've also come
to realize...

1614
02:05:09,018 --> 02:05:12,647
that we need to monitor
the people who are monitoring them.

1615
02:05:12,722 --> 02:05:16,249
Well, who's going to monitor
the monitors of the monitors?

1616
02:05:16,325 --> 02:05:19,920
I wouldn't mind doing
a little, uh, monitoring myself.

1617
02:05:19,996 --> 02:05:24,023
Yeah, and you got lots
and lots of monitoring to do.

1618
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,728
Are you guys talking
about sex?

1619
02:05:26,803 --> 02:05:29,931
- Boy!
- Oh, no. It's time for dinner.

1620
02:05:30,006 --> 02:05:33,772
Get in there and eat your dinner.
No more hanging with Dylan.

1621
02:06:07,643 --> 02:06:10,737
Brill,
you are one sick man.

1622
02:06:13,783 --> 02:06:16,047
Yeah, me too.

1623
02:06:18,187 --> 02:06:21,714
Ooh, you're gonna need
to get a tan on those things.

1624
02:06:25,561 --> 02:06:29,122
Congressman Albert,
how do we draw the line...

1625
02:06:29,198 --> 02:06:32,258
between protection
of national security,

1626
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:35,793
obviously the government's need
to obtain intelligence data,

1627
02:06:35,872 --> 02:06:40,468
and the protection of civil liberties,
particularly the sanctity of my home?

1628
02:06:40,543 --> 02:06:44,104
You've got no right
to come into my home.
