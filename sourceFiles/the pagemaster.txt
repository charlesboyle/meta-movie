1
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,480
(roars)

2
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,830
(gasps)

3
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,540
(gasping)

4
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,050
(woman) Alan, every
ten-year-old is afraid
of something.

5
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,550
(Alan) The kid's afraid
of tuna-fish sandwiches.

6
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,550
Mercury levels
in the tuna.

7
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,550
Whatever.

8
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,060
Alan, the world is
a frightening place
to him right now.

9
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,060
I think we could be
a little more supportive.

10
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,060
Supportive? I'm the most
supportive father on earth,

11
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,060
but I'm running out of
supportive things to do.

12
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,070
I signed him up
for Little League,
he drove everybody crazy

13
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,070
with statistics about how you
can develop tumors from being
hit in the head with a ball.

14
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,580
Did you know that shin splints
can lead to blood clots
in the legs?

15
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,080
Claire, he brought in
a medical journal. Nobody
wanted to play after that.

16
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,450
And now I'm building him
a tree house, in a tree
he refuses to climb.

17
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,590
You know he hates heights.

18
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,590
I don't know. I just
want to be a good father.

19
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,090
But you are
a good father.

20
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,020
(thunder rumbles)

21
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,600
(gasps) I'm OK! I'm OK!

22
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,720
(thunder crashes)

23
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,110
Aah! No, I'm not!

24
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,120
Hey, Rich!

25
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,620
(laughs) Well?

26
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,070
You like it?

27
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,630
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.

28
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,130
Hey, how about bringing
me up that bag of nails?

29
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,630
No, come on up!

30
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,080
Look. Solid as a rock.

31
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,140
Dad, 8% of all household
accidents involve ladders.

32
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,090
Another 3% involve trees.

33
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,640
We're looking at
11% probability here.

34
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,650
Fine. Just put the bag
in the bucket, OK?

35
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,660
(resumes hammering)

36
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,660
Rich.
Huh?

37
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,030
Ow! (yells)

38
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,670
Oh! Oh!

39
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,170
Dad! Do you have feeling
in your toes?

40
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,170
Yes, I have feeling
in my toes.

41
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,670
Oh, Alan, honey,
are you OK?

42
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,170
Yeah, I'm fine.

43
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,680
Fine. Oh!

44
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,680
Can't argue with
statistics, Dad.

45
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,180
Statistics. Here's
something you can do:

46
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,690
go down to
Gutman's Hardware Store,
buy a pound of these.

47
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,690
But, Dad --

48
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,690
Son, you can't
live your life
based on statistics.

49
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,690
You've gotta
take some chances.

50
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,190
Now come on, buddy.

51
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,150
You can do this.

52
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,660
This is not good.
Definitely not good.

53
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,720
(lights chirp)

54
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,220
(warning device beeps)

55
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,730
(boy #1) All right!
(boy #2) Whoa!

56
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,240
Good one!

57
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,740
(boy #3) You went further
that time.

58
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,740
All right! Way to go, dude!

59
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:57,740
All right, line it up.

60
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,750
(warning beep stops)

61
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,750
Hey, guys, look,
it's Richie Tyler.

62
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,250
Hey, check out
his clothes.

63
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,250
Hey, Tyler, where
you going, the moon?

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,760
Get cable in
that thing, Tyler?

65
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,760
Hey, what's the matter,
you chicken?
(makes chicken noises)

66
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,260
What's the matter, wuss,
forgot your training wheels?

67
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,270
(laughter)

68
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,280
(gasps)

69
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,790
Uhh!

70
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,800
Uhh!

71
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,810
(thunder crashes)

72
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,810
(grunts)

73
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,330
(yells)

74
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,330
(gasps)

75
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,530
No cranial damage.

76
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,840
(warning beep stops)

77
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,300
Oh!
(roars)

78
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,860
(pants)

79
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,380
Hello?

80
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,380
(gasps)

81
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,880
(squeaking)

82
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,400
(wind howling)

83
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,370
Welcome to the library,
young man.

84
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,430
Don't tell me. You're here
for a special book.

85
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,430
Mister --

86
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,930
Stop, stop, stop.
Allow me to guess.

87
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,930
I have a talent for
guessing what people need.

88
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,440
You're in need of...

89
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,390
a fantasy.

90
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,440
Brave knights,

91
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,950
mythical fairies,
ferocious dragons.

92
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,900
Look, all I want is --

93
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,950
Adventure!

94
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,450
Of course. You're a boy
who loves adventure!

95
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,450
Brimming with
wicked demons,

96
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,960
cutthroat pirates --

97
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,960
No, no, that's not it.

98
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,040
Horror!

99
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,970
Ah, horror! Evil demons!

100
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,470
Wretched monsters!
Haunted houses!

101
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,470
Graveyards!

102
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,420
Yes.

103
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,980
It's horror for you, boy.

104
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,980
I'm sure of it.

105
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,480
Your library card, please.

106
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,990
I don't have one.

107
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,990
You do now.

108
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,490
Sign here.

109
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,500
Richard Tyler.

110
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,000
Consider this your passport

111
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:24,010
to the wonderful,
quite unpredictable
world of books.

112
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,510
But I don't
want any books.

113
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,010
Hmm?
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

114
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,510
I only came in here
'cause of the storm.

115
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,010
You mean you don't need...

116
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,460
Oh.

117
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,020
I see.

118
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,030
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?

119
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,530
Through there.

120
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,530
Proceed in a
northeasterly direction

121
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:57,540
until you get to the rotunda,
and from there head west
through the fiction section.

122
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,040
And you'll find it.
A public telephone.
You can't miss it.

123
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,050
(wind blows eerily)

124
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,560
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way,

125
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,560
merely direct yourself
back to the exit sign.

126
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,150
(thunder)

127
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,600
(shoes squeak)

128
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,600
Wow!

129
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Jeez!

130
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,150
(thunder)

131
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,650
Whoa! Oh!

132
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,170
Hello?!

133
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,620
(voice echoing)

134
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,120
(swordplay)

135
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,630
(horse gallops/neighs)

136
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,630
Uh-oh.

137
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,130
(falling droplets)

138
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,640
Huh?

139
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,660
Oh! Uhh!

140
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,670
(yells)

141
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,680
(roars)

142
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,680
(yells)

143
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,680
Uhh!

144
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,190
(yelling) Help!

145
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,690
Mister, mister,
where's the exit?!

146
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,190
(screams)

147
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,200
Help!

148
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,700
(yells)

149
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,210
(gasps)

150
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,710
Wha...? (gasps)

151
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,210
Huh?

152
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,190
I'm... I'm a cartoon!

153
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,720
You... are an illustration.

154
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,730
Who... who are you?

155
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,730
I am the Pagemaster,

156
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,700
keeper of the books
and guardian of
the written word.

157
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,240
(gasps) You're the guy
from up there!

158
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,240
Where are the others?

159
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:17,720
Why, they're here, of course!
And all around.

160
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,720
Maybe you can show me
the way out?

161
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,220
Follow me.

162
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,720
I-Is that the way?

163
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,730
Oh, the only way.

164
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,230
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!

165
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,690
Where a boy's imagination
can take root and grow
to incredible heights!

166
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,200
(grunting)

167
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,700
Where a boy's courage
is a wind that moves
him to discovery!

168
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,710
(men continue grunting)

169
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,710
And where
your journey begins!

170
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,710
Uhh! Whoa!

171
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,220
To find your way home,
you must face three tests:

172
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,720
horror, adventure
and fantasy.

173
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,230
And remember this:
when in doubt,

174
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,230
look to the books!

175
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,230
Aah! How do you
stop this thing?!

176
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,870
(man #1) I am the ghost
of Christmas past...

177
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,240
(man #2) All the pirates
shared a grave.

178
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,740
(crashing)

179
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,240
(phone off hook)

180
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,250
(moans)

181
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,250
(operator) Due to the storm,
all lines have been
temporarily disconnected.

182
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,250
Please try your
call again later.

183
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,250
(moaning) Oh! Ow!

184
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,760
(sighs) This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.

185
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,760
(grunts)
(yells)

186
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,270
Where's the son of a sea biscuit
knocked me from me crow's nest?

187
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,240
Where's he be?! Where's he be?

188
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:09,280
So here be the lubber who
knocked me on me poop deck
and with no apologies, too!

189
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,780
(growls)

190
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,280
You fiction
or nonfiction?

191
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,250
(gasps) Uh, Richard.
Richard Tyler.

192
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,290
What kind of a book
would that be?

193
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,290
Uh, I'm not a book.

194
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,790
Got any proof?
(grunts)

195
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,790
See? Here's my name!

196
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,300
(gasps)

197
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,300
A library card!

198
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,300
Oh, begging your pardon,
lad. I didn't know
you was a customer!

199
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,810
Uh, look, all I wanna do
is get outta here.

200
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,810
(laughing) Of course you do,
matey! We all do.

201
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,280
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.

202
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,280
(thunderclap)

203
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,620
(librarian) Look to the books.
Look to the books.

204
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,290
(gasps)

205
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,290
You... you said you knew
the way out?

206
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I know these waters like
the back of me hook!

207
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,300
(mutters)

208
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,800
Uh... Uh. This way.

209
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,800
I gotta get home.

210
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,760
My parents are probably
worried sick about me.

211
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,260
Well, I'm afeard I've been
dry-docked in this library

212
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,260
far longer than
I'd like to remember.

213
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,270
As I sees it, you with
your library card are
me ticket out of here!

214
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,770
Is it a deal, matey?

215
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,270
Ooh, I'm naked.

216
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,240
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

217
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,740
Ha ha ha ha ha!
That's the spirit, lad!

218
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,750
Can we get going now?

219
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,250
Aye aye!
Let's scale this mast
and get our bearings!

220
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,250
Mast? That's a ladder.
I kind of have this thing
about heights.

221
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,760
Huh. I'll take care of that.
(mutters)

222
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,260
Mysterious Island. Yes.

223
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,760
Kidnapped.

224
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,270
Ah, here we be!
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

225
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,270
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!

226
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
It's a giant squid!

227
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,780
(snarls)

228
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,280
Ah! Whoa!

229
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,280
Ooh! Jump, boy!

230
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,790
It's jump for your life!

231
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,290
(squid roars)

232
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,790
Ohh!

233
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,960
(gasping) Uhh!

234
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:26,300
(grunting)

235
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,800
(woman, muffled)
Let go of my face!
I can't breathe!

236
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,810
(muffled voice/gasps)

237
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,810
What are you doing,
grabbing me like that

238
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,810
and messing up
my pantyhose? Hmph.

239
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,320
Hmph. Now I gotta straighten
out my Little Mermaid underwear.

240
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,320
Who... who are you?

241
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,320
(grumpily) I'm Fantasy. Oh!

242
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,320
(clears throat)

243
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,330
(sweetly) I'm Fantasy!
What is this?

244
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,830
Hmm.

245
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,830
It's a library card.

246
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,830
(sarcastically) I'm a book,
honey, I can read.

247
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,830
(clears throat)
Now tell me,

248
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,840
what's the one thing
you wish for more than
anything in the world?

249
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,420
Anything in the world?

250
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,930
I-I'd like to get out of here.

251
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,930
I'll grant your wish, child.
But you must do me one small
kindness in return.

252
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,260
You gotta check me
outta here!

253
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,220
That's it? OK, let's go!

254
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,440
Do I have to click my heels
or something?

255
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,440
(laughs) Honey,
you in the wrong story.

256
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,940
That was a close one, lad. Lad?

257
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,950
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!

258
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,450
You know
that short story?

259
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,950
Yeah, he's adventure.

260
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,450
Honey, that's what they all say.

261
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,410
I heard that! I'll have
you know I'm a classic!

262
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,960
Mm-hmm. A classic... misprint.

263
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,470
Why, you old sea serpent!
I'll rip out your pages
and use them for... Oh, no!

264
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,970
Do something!

265
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,470
Hmm.

266
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,970
(Adventure yells)

267
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,980
Oops! (laughs) I forgot.
My wand doesn't always work
outside the fantasy section.

268
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,980
You mean you can't
wish us to the exit?

269
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,490
(groans) That overdue shrew's
never even seen the exit.

270
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,990
More than you have, shorty!

271
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,990
In fact, the exit's just beyond
my fantasy section. Hmph!

272
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,990
Then what are ye doing
in these parts?

273
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,500
There a witches' convention
around here, maybe?

274
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,500
Look, I was misshelved. (laughs)

275
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,010
But that's over, now that
young Prince Charming here
has come to check me out.

276
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,010
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!

277
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,010
Come on, boy, we're
wasting time chumming off
this dinghy.

278
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,010
It's on to
the exit for us!

279
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,520
If he thinks the exit's in
that direction, you know
it's got to be in this one!

280
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,520
Don't listen to her,
mate. She's not sailing
with a full crew!

281
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,520
Ah-ah-ah! (sneezes)

282
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,530
Fantasy!
She's a bloody nightmare.

283
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,030
Let's leave him. He doesn't
even know where we are now!

284
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Bilge water! Of course
I know where we are! We're...

285
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,540
Hound of the Baskervilles.
Ha! We're in Baskervilles.

286
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,040
Have a look-see!

287
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,540
Hmm. Huh?

288
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,660
(barks/growls)

289
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:16,330
(screams)

290
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,550
Hey, this way!
Through here!

291
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,050
Nice doggy! Good doggy!

292
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,060
Hurry!
(grunts)

293
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,560
(barks)

294
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,560
(all panting)

295
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,570
(sighs) Oh, baby.

296
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,570
Are we still in the library?

297
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,580
Aye, lad,
the horror section.

298
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,580
It looks pretty scary.

299
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,080
That it does.
Just stay close to me and...

300
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,080
and you got nothing
to worry about.

301
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,080
(sarcastically) Mm-hmm.

302
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,600
There it is! The exit! (pants)

303
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,110
(sighs)

304
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,610
Looks like the only way
to reach the exit is
through that there house.

305
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,620
No way I'm going in there.

306
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
It's your only chance, boy.

307
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,620
It's just a house.

308
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,120
Yeah, but 70%
of all accidents
are household-related.

309
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,080
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.

310
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,090
Whoa!

311
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,090
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.

312
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,090
(gasps)

313
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
Well? Ring the bell.

314
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,100
(pants)

315
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,100
(doorbell chimes)

316
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:03,110
Ohh!

317
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,610
Good catch!

318
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,080
Here, take it.

319
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,580
Isn't he sweet?
(makes kissing sounds)

320
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,080
Oh, I scared you.

321
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,580
I'm sorry!

322
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,090
You mustn't judge a book
by its cover.

323
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,090
Look, he's smiling!

324
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,090
(laughing)

325
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,590
That's a smile?

326
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,090
All right, teatime's over.

327
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,600
Let's start
navigating this house.

328
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,600
Huh? No, wait!
Don't go in there!

329
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,600
It's scary inside!

330
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,610
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!

331
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,060
I'm afraid.

332
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,110
Of what?

333
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,110
Of, of... (yells)

334
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,110
And... Aah!

335
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,110
And... (makes creepy noise)

336
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,570
And... (imitates
woman screaming)

337
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,570
Uh, I know how you feel.

338
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,570
Horror always has sad endings.

339
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,080
I come from a world
of happy endings.

340
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,080
Why don't you
come with us?

341
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,080
Yeah! And maybe you could
help us through the house.

342
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,590
Through the house? Hm. Uh.

343
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,590
You can do it.

344
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,590
'Kay.

345
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,590
Friend?

346
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,590
(gulps)

347
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,100
(gasps) Oops!

348
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,600
Come on!

349
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,600
(laughs)

350
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,600
(sings indistinctly)

351
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,610
(gasps)

352
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,610
Hmm?

353
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,610
(mutters indistinctly)

354
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,120
(shivers)

355
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,120
He-hello?

356
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,120
A-anybody home?

357
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,130
(door slams shut)

358
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
(all gasp)

359
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,640
What was that?

360
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,640
(screeches) Nevermore!

361
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,640
Get me out of here!

362
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,160
May I assist you
in some way?

363
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,160
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?

364
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,660
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.

365
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,170
Well, sir, we did
ring the bell.

366
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,170
It's all my fault.

367
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,170
I was trying to help them
find their way to
the other side of the house.

368
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,680
The other side?

369
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,680
My boy, I derive no pleasure
in telling you that
you are in extreme danger.

370
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,680
Danger?

371
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,150
Even as we speak.

372
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:52,690
Lurking in this very room,
waiting to strike,
are forces of evil.

373
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,160
(gasps)

374
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:59,200
(screams) Wait for me!
Wait for me!

375
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:10,210
Every man is possessed of
both good... and evil.

376
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,710
(suavely) Oh, yes.

377
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,720
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?

378
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,220
Hmm?

379
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,230
Ah.

380
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,730
I'll have a go
with you, doc.

381
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,230
Ooh!

382
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,230
Stay back!
This is a man's drink!

383
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,240
(laughs) Can I have the olive?

384
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,740
Oh!

385
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,740
Uh-oh.

386
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,740
Now look what you've done!

387
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,250
Whoa!

388
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,750
Ooh!

389
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,720
No! No, no!
Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!

390
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,720
(gasps)

391
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,510
(yelling)

392
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,230
(moaning)

393
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
(all gasp)

394
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:14,240
(moans)

395
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,740
(laughs)

396
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,750
(laughs maniacally)

397
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,750
Dr... Jekyll?

398
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Dr. J?

399
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,760
My name is... Mr. Hyde!

400
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,260
(all gasp/scream)

401
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,770
Easy, there!

402
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,780
(yelps)

403
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,280
The stairs, mateys,
the stairs!

404
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,790
Ahh!

405
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,790
Help, master!
Don't leave me!

406
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,290
This is no way to treat
a library book. Sanctuary!

407
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,300
Sanctuary!

408
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,300
(laughs maniacally)

409
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,800
Sanctuary!

410
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,810
Honey, you got to help him!

411
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,310
But I-I...

412
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,810
Oh!

413
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,310
At least this wand
is good for something.

414
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,820
Come on!

415
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,320
Which way?

416
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,830
Down.
Definitely down.

417
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,830
No, up, definitely up!
Up, up, up!

418
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,280
Come on!

419
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,840
(gasping)

420
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,850
What's going on?

421
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,300
Ghost stories.

422
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,860
(screaming)

423
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,360
Ha ha!

424
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,860
Get me outta here!

425
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,730
Aah!

426
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,730
Close the door!

427
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Whoa!

428
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,740
Down there? I-I can't.

429
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,740
Come on, boy!
Even books have spines.

430
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,250
Come, master!

431
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,750
I can do this.
I can do this.

432
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,580
Aah!

433
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,250
Uhh! Uhh!

434
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,760
(growls)

435
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,760
(Pagemaster's voice) Reach deep
within yourself, Richard.

436
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,260
Seize the courage.

437
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,760
Uhh! Uhh!

438
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,770
Whoa!

439
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,770
Yay! You did it!
You did it!

440
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,270
Grand, boy!

441
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,770
(laughing)

442
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,780
Hooray, hooray, hooray.

443
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,780
Wow.

444
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,780
(chuckles)

445
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,290
(breathes deeply)

446
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,260
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.

447
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,770
Ha ha! The land
of adventure!

448
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,770
Look! There's the exit!

449
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,770
(all chuckling)

450
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:48,290
(chuckling)

451
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,290
Hey! Wait for me!

452
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Ha ha ha!
Home, sweet home!

453
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,300
There's only room
for one up here.

454
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,310
From now on,
it'll be smooth sailin'!

455
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,810
(laughing)

456
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,760
What are ya laughin' at?

457
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,260
(laughing)

458
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,810
Whoa!

459
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,320
Uhh!

460
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,770
A boat!

461
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,270
Is it... safe?

462
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,270
I wrote the book on sailin'.

463
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,780
In fact, I am
the book on sailin'.

464
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,780
I'm impressed.

465
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,250
(laughing)

466
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,290
We're sinking.
We're going down!

467
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,790
Somebody do something!

468
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,790
(wailing)

469
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,290
Thank you.

470
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,800
Shove off, lads!

471
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,800
(dd accordion)

472
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,810
(Rich) Jeez, the water
looks kind of choppy.

473
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,310
Maybe we should've stayed
back there where it was safe.

474
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,320
(plays discordant note)

475
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,820
Whalin' men.

476
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,320
(men grunting)

477
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,320
(Adventure)
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!

478
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,800
Another guy with a peg leg.

479
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,800
Mm-hmm. Seems to be
a fashion statement
around here.

480
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,300
Did you see it?!
(Rich) See what?!

481
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,810
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.

482
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,310
Hmm?
Moby Dick!

483
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Thar she blows!

484
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,820
I grin at thee,
thou grinning whale!

485
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,330
(gasps) He's possessed!

486
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,830
He's insane!

487
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,830
He's my kind of guy!

488
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,830
(grunting)

489
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,330
Look!

490
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,830
It's headed
straight for them!

491
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,840
Thou damned whale!

492
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,840
Thus, I give up the spear!

493
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,840
(growls)

494
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,850
So, you think
I scared it?

495
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,850
He shouldn't swim
right after eating,
you know.

496
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,860
He'll get cramps.

497
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,360
Where did he go?

498
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,360
Aah!

499
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,360
Row! Row for your lives!

500
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:35,200
(screaming)

501
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:47,880
(coughing)

502
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,890
Guys! Where are you?!

503
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,390
(panting)

504
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,900
(screaming)

505
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,900
(sputtering)

506
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:09,400
Adventure? Boy, am I
ever glad to see you.

507
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,410
Huh?

508
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,410
All right, all right!

509
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,410
Where's Horror?

510
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,920
And Fantasy?

511
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,340
Where are they?

512
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,880
I searched for 'em
as much as I could, mate.

513
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,380
I'm afraid...
I'm afraid they've gone
below with Davy Jones.

514
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,880
No, it can't be.

515
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:49,390
You guys are the only
friends I've ever had.

516
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,900
(sniffling)

517
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,400
She's a cruel sea, lad.

518
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,910
They gotta be out there.

519
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,910
Horror!

520
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,910
Fantasy!

521
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,910
Sharks!

522
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,920
(gasping)

523
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,920
We may be joining them
other two sooner
than you think.

524
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,920
Hey, look!

525
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,430
Help, help! Over here!

526
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,930
Careful, mate. Not all sharks
are in the water.

527
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,930
Get us out of here!

528
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,930
(grunts)

529
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,940
This way! Help!

530
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,940
(chuckling evilly)

531
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,940
It's a good thing
you guys came along.

532
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,950
Ohh! We're missing
two others about his size.
Did you see 'em?

533
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,450
He's all the catch
we've had today.

534
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,450
(growls)

535
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,960
(laughing)

536
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,960
(blows whistle)

537
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,470
Huh?

538
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,470
(whistle blows in distance)

539
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,490
I knew it! It's him!

540
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,490
Who?

541
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,990
The meanest, black-hearted
pirate that ever sailed
the seven seas.

542
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Long John Silver!

543
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,000
(cackling)

544
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,000
(cocks gun)

545
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,000
Just set your keel down, mate.

546
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,010
John Silver's
expecting live company.

547
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,010
(cackling)

548
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,510
Uhh!

549
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,020
Give the word,
Cap'n Silver, sir,

550
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,520
and I'll show you
the color of his insides.

551
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,030
Red! Red! They're red!

552
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,030
Stow your cutlass,
Tom Morgan.

553
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,530
I want a better look
at his outsides first.

554
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,540
Long John Silver!

555
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,040
Aye, lad,

556
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,540
Well, seeing as how
me men plucked you
out of the water

557
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,540

field rat,

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,550
you'll be joinin'
our happy family

559
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,550
as our new cabin boy.

560
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,050
Thanks, but I already
have a family.

561
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
I really should be
getting home now.

562
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,560
Oh, I think
you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.

563
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:40,030
John Silver! Touch one hair
on that boy's head,
and you'll be answerin' to me!

564
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,070
(laughs)

565
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,040
Well, come aboard,
matey! Ha ha.

566
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,540
Uhh!

567
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,580
You wouldn't happen to be
going after me treasure,
would you, now?

568
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,080
You ain't got any treasure
worth goin' after!

569
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,080
No treasure?
No treasure?

570
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,340
He's lyin'! There's plenty
of treasure for all of ya!

571
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,590
Search him!

572
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,590
The boy, too.

573
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,180
(pirates laughing)

574
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,600
(dd accordion)

575
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:19,100
Hmm. Why, looky here.

576
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,110
Here he be, Cap'n.

577
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,610
What might this here be?

578
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,610
Money! It's yours! Keep it!

579
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,610
Money, he says!

580
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,610
Keep it, he says!

581
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,620
(laughing hysterically)

582
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,620
Hmm. Library card.

583
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,120
Library card?

584
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,120
A cabin boy don't need
no library card.

585
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,630
(laughs)
(screeches)

586
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,510
(gasping)

587
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,130
I'd like to get out of here!

588
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,640
Land ho!

589
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,140

590
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,140
There she be, mateys!

591
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,650
Treasure Island!

592
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,150
(cheering)

593
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,150
(laughing)

594
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,160
Stay on your toes, mate.

595
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,660
When they go for the gold,
we'll make our break.

596
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,170
Quit your squawkin'!

597
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,630
Look to the map.
What's it say?

598
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,640
It's, uh, in the middle
by the waterfall.

599
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:30,680
No, it's east
by some broccoli.

600
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,640
Give me that!
Broccoli.

601
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,150
You half-wits,
that's west by a tree!

602
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,650
(muttering)
Oh, east by broccoli.

603
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,650
(parrot) They're all idiots.

604
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,660
(gasps)

605
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,160
What sort of way is that
for bones to lie?

606
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,160
It ain't natural.

607
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,170
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!

608
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,670
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.

609
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,170
Open your eyes.
The bones is the compass

610
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,170
pointin' the way
to the doubloons.

611
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,170
(all gasp)

612
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,680
(laughing hysterically)

613
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,680
It's gone!

614
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,690
Dig deeper, boys!

615
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,190
(Long John) I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!

616
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,690
One gold piece. This is
your treasure, is it?

617
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,650
Let's kill him
and eat his parrot.

618
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,200
Stand by for trouble.

619
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,700
We mighta known
you'd double-cross us.

620
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,700
(parrot squawks)

621
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,210
Throw down your weapons,
John Silver!

622
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,210
Why, you pack of
back-bitin' dogs.

623
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,210
You'll be regrettin' this,
George Merry.

624
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,670
Save your speeches.
Dead men don't bite.

625

(Horror) dd 16 men on
a dead man's stomach dd

626
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,230

627

Sanctuary!

632
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,740
(shouting)

633
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,240
Ohh.

634
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,750
Horror! You're alive!

635
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:19,250
Not for long.
Hee hee hee hee hee!

636
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,250
Aah!

637
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,750
Ohh!

638
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,260
Ohh-ohh!

639
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,260
Ahchoo!

640
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,260
Fantasy!

641
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,880
Naturally. But who were
you expecting, honey,

642
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,270
the tooth fairy? (laughs)

643
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,270
Get them!

644
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,770
Ha ha! At last, a good fight!

645
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,780
Aah!

646
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,780
Uhh!

647
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,780
(muffled) Get me outta here!

648
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,780
(laughing)

649
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,290
(waggling tongue)

650
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,240
(laughing)

651
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,410
Hey!

652
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,790
Why, you...!

653
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,240
(grunting)

654
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,300
Hey!

Get the boat, boy.
We're gonna be shovin' off.

659
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,810
I'm not going
with you.

660
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,310
The sword, honey.
Get the sword.

661
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,820
Don't even think it, boy.
He ain't got the heart.

662
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,820
(shivering)

663
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,820

Avast there, laddie.

667
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,280
Somebody could get hurt
with that blade you got thar.

668
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,830
Be careful, master.

669
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,830
(squawks) In the boat.

670
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,340
Huh? Easy now, matey.
Easy. I'm goin'.

671
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,840
Right ye are.
Into the boat, aye aye.

00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,870
(laughing)

679
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,370
Whew. Oh, I wish
my dad coulda seen me.

680
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,870
Boy, I thought
you two were goners.

681
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
We almost were,

682
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,380
until this enchanting fellow
discovered he could float.

683
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,380
It's hollow.

684
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,390
(grunting)

685
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,890
Who's there?
Adventure!

686
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,390
Adventure who?

687
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,390
What do you mean,
Adventure who?!

688
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,890
Open the blasted door,
you dog-eared...

689
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,340
Aah!

690
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,350
(chuckles) Perfect timing.

691
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,900
I was just thanking
these guys for saving us.

692
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,400
(growls)

693
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,900
I coulda taken
the lot of 'em

694
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:56,410
with one hand
tied behind me back.

695
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,410
That's just his way
of saying thanks.

696
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,420
You're welcome!

697
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,920
Ahoy, matey!

698
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,920
Aye, we're lusty
adventurous men.

699
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,430
Go away. You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

700
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,880
I-I know I'm not
your favorite kind of book,

701
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,430
but I could be
just like you.

702
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,430
You'll never be Adventure!

703
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,940
Ye ain't got
the spine for it.

704
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,440
And take that
stupid thing off!

705
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,390
Sorry.

706
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,390
(muttering) Oh, he thinks
he can be a pirate.

707
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,950
(sighs)

708
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:47,460
(sighs)

709
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:53,960
(Pagemaster's voice)
Seize the courage, Richard,
then you will reach the exit.

710
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,970
I'll never get home.

711
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,970
You did good, honey.

712
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,970
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.

713
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,480
I'll never get
to the exit now.

714
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,480
Honey, never say "never"
around Fantasy,

715
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:13,980
because sometimes
you've got to fight
to make a wish come true.

716
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,990
So come on.
Don't quit on me now.

717
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,490
Yeah.

718
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,990
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.

719
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,500
You don't see me
pretending to be Horror.

720
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,500

721
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,010
(gasps/grunts)

722
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,510
Why are you sittin' around
like a bunch of ol' wenches
at teatime?!

723
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,510
Pick one.

724
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,510
Mmm...

725
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,020
That one.

726
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,520
(chuckles)

727
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,520
My library card!

728
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,020
I wrestled it away
from three sharks

729
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,520
who was eyein' it
for breakfast,

730
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,020
at no small threat
to me life, neither.

731
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,530
Mm-hmm.

732
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,030
Where's Horror?
Wasn't he with you?

733
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:03,030
He was, but he, uh...
I mean, I sort of, uh...
He, uh...

734
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,040
What did you say
to him now?!

735
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,040
Well, I, uh, I, uh,
I just, uh, uh...

736
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,540
I'll go find him.

737
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,990
Yeah, you better
go find him.
And be quick about it!

738
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,050
Horror!

739
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,050
Horror!

740
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,550
(gasps) Horror!

741
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,050
(Adventure) Horror.

742
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,510
(chattering)

743
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,070
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!

744
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,070
(shouting)

745
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,570
You're lucky I was published
with a thick hide!

746
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,580
Hmm?

747
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,580
(shouts)

748
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,580
(screaming)

749
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,080
Come back, ya jellyfish!

750
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,590
(sighing)

751
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,590
Speak to me, mate.

752
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,600
Ye had a good heart
and ye was braver
than ye knew.

753
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:13,100
I'd walk the plank
if I thought it would
bring him back.

754
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,110
That's beautiful.

755
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,610
Huh?

756
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,610
This is too cute.

757
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,610
Uhh!

758
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,610
Are you OK?

759
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,110
Thanks to my friend here.

760
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,620
Get off me!

761
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,620
Did you see that?

762
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,120
See what?

763
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,120
My wand! It's blinkin'!

764
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,120
That can only mean
one thing.

765
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,130
The exit!

766
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,330
The checkout!
A happy ending.

767
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,830
Ohh!

768
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,830
(Horror laughing)

769
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:48,840
(laughs) Let's go!
Come on!

770
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,840
Are you sure that
swizzle stick of yours
is workin' right?

771
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:57,350
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe we should test it.

772
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,360
You've gone overboard,
missis!

773
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,860
(crash)

774
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,860

Hey! Don't go up there!

800
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,480
What's the matter?
Is Adventure afraid
to go in?

801
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,490
What?! I live for
moments like this.

802
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,490

836
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:02,120

00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,130
We're almost there!

840
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,150
We made it!

841
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,150
Guys?

842
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,660
This dragon is history!

843
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:43,110
Don't try to stop me!

844
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:46,110
Be careful.

845
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,170
Huh? Hmm.

846
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,670
(giggles)

847
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,670
You really are a classic.

Mmm!
(sighs)

851
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,190
How would you like
to curl up with
a good book?

852

854
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,190
Me binding!

855
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,700
In your dreams!

856
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,700
Ooh!

857
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,200
Adventure, up here!

858
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:27,200
Go on, lad! Save yourself!

859
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,710
You think a bag of hot air
is enough to stop me?!

860
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,710
Dragon. He's more like
a dragonfly, he is!
And with big teeth!

861
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,210
Look out!

862
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,220

863
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:43,220

865
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,730
Uhh.

866
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,180
Happy birthday.

867
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,230
(sighs)

868
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,240
(growls)

869
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,250
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!

870
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,250
A sword.

871
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,270
Yes!

872
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,280
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!

873
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,290
Bite him, bite him!

874
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,790
(barks)

875
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,800
Aah!

876
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,300
Yah!

877
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,300
Watch out for his tail!

878
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,800
(Adventure) You've got
him on the run!

879
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,310
Aah!

880
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,310
(grunting)

881
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,320
I'm not scared of you!

882
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,320
Aah!

883
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,830
Aah!

884
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,830
Huh?

885
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,340
(coughing)

886
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,840
Aah!

887
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:42,340
(coughs)

888
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,840
I gotta get out of here.

889
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:47,840
(grunting)

890
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,850
Aah!

891
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,350
Fantasy's wand!

892
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,860
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.

893
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:02,860
Uh-oh.

894
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:06,360
(ghostly voice)
Look to the books.
Look to the books.

895
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,370
Look to the books.

896
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,370
Look to the books!

897
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,370
Alice in Wonderland.

898
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,870
Off with his head!

899
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,380
Sheesh!

900
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,380
Mnh-mnh.

901
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,880
Mnh-mnh.

902
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,380
Jack and the Beanstalk.

903
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,890
Yeah! This is it!

904
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,390
(gasping)

905
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:44,900
I hate heights!

906
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,910
Aah!

907
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,410
Matey!

908

909
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,910
Aah!

910
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,910
Come on, guys!

911
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,920
Uhh!

912
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,920

913
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:12,430

914
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,390
Whew.
Are you all right?

915
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,440
Wh-wha...?

916
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,940
Master, you saved us!

917
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,440
That ya did, matey.

918
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,950
(gasps)

919
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,450
Baby, you're the greatest.

920
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,950
Mmwah!

921
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,480
Who's there?

922
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:09,490
The Pagemaster.

923
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,490
Hey! How'd you get here?

924
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,690
Quit it! We're in
the presence of
the Pagemaster.

925
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,200
I know who he is!
He's the guy who did
all this to me!

926
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,200
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

927
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,700
Tell me.

928
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,710
I was nearly torn apart
by a crazy doctor.

929
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,710
I was made a slave by
a bunch of mangy pirates

930
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,710
and eaten -- got that?

931
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,210
Eaten by
a fire-breathing dragon.

932
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:41,680
He don't mean it,
my Pagemaster.
He don't mean it.

933
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:47,720
Not to mention being
tossed, squashed and scared
practically to death.

934
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,190
Yet you stand before me.

935
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,230
Well... yeah.

936
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,240
Think, boy! What kind of
an adventure would you have had

937
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:02,620
if I brought you here
with a turn of a page?

938
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,660
(cackling)

939
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,740

940

(laughing)

941
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,250
You prevailed over evil.

942
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,760
Ah, you looked Moby Dick
in the eye, boy.

943
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:28,260
Ah, you had pirates tough,
me lad, and don't no one
speak any different.

944
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,770
If I had brought you
here from the start,

945
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,770
you never would have
found the courage
to face your own fears.

946
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:43,780
(roars)

947
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:49,790
And in doing so,
you triumph here and always.

948
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,790
Hey, is that... That's me!

949
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,800
That was you.

950
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,300
I'm ready to go home now.

951
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,800
(sighs)

952
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:08,300
I mean, we're ready.

953
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,310
The world awaits.

954
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,810
Whoa!

955
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,810
Godspeed to you, boy!

956
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,320
Wait for me!

957
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,820
(yelling)

958
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,830
Aah!

959
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,360
(Pagemaster's voice)
You took quite a spill,
young man.

960
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:03,360
Huh?

961
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,860
Are you all right?

962
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,880
Careful!
You'll slip again!

963
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:25,880
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

964
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,380
Wait! Uh, I forgot
something.

965
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:30,890
Here.

966
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,890
I'm afraid you can
only check out two.

967
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,900
Horror? But I promised him.

968
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:45,400
You promised whom?

969
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,410
Look, I need...
Just this once?

970
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,910
Shh.

971
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,910
(whispering) I have
a talent for guessing
what people need.

972
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,920
Just this once.

973
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,920
Shh.

974
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:56,470
Yes!

975
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:05,480
Good. That was definitely good.

976
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,490
(Claire) I can't imagine
where he could be.

977
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,490
Maybe we should
call the police.

978
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,990
(gasps) Alan!

979
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,500
He's home.

980
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,000
Alan.

981
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:28,000
It's impossible.

982
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:31,510
(owl hooting)

983
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,510
Rich?

984
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,030
We probably should
put him in his bed.

985
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,530
Let's let him sleep
up here tonight.

986
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,550
Love you, Richie.

987
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,560
Good night, son.

988
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:45,080
(Horror) It's dark out here.
I wish there was a night-light.

989
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,080
(Fantasy) Honey,
wish granted.

990
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,590
(gasps) Ooh.

991

994
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,100
Breathe it in, mateys.

995
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:04,600
This be the land of adventure.
You can lay to that.

996
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:11,610
(crying)

997
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:14,610
Come here, handsome.
Why you cryin'?

998
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:19,110
Because I have friends.
(sniffles)

999
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,120
(chuckles)
That you do, matey.

1000
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:27,120
Aye, that you do.

1001
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:31,510
Ahem. You know what would
make this a happy ending?

1002
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,130
A kiss.

1003
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:38,130
OK. (smacks kiss)

1004
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,640
