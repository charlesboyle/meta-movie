19
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,695
Here you go.

20
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,948
Y'all go fuck
your selves now, okay?

21
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,490
Give me a smoke.

22
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,118
I don't got any.

23
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,580
What? You quit?

24
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,792
Shit. That ain't gonna last.

25
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,729
Daddy!

26
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,149
Hey, bug. How you doing?

27
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,234
Did you see our sign?
Grandma and me made it this morning.

28
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,320
Yeah. It's really nice.

29
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,698
Welcome home, son.

30
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,411
- Excited? Want some juice?
- Yup.

31
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,955
All right, then you
help me set the table.

32
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,207
I made you all a meat loaf.

33
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,251
Hope you'll stay for supper.

34
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,919
Oh, I don't know.

35
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,714
What time you gotta work?

36
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,549
Want me to warm
up the corn for you?

37
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,551
Yeah. That'd be great.

38
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,845
I ain't on tonight.

39
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,267
What?
Friday night, you ain't on?

40
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,353
What the hell is that?

41
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,271
Baby, why don't you go
bring out the chair, huh?

42
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,649
That cocksucker Mark better
be givin' you your time

43
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,234
or I'm gonna go over there
and bust in his teeth.

44
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,237
Why ain't there no beer?

45
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,866
I ain't dancing
no more, Sam.

46
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,535
Quit a couple of weeks ago.
Got a job over at Freemont.

47
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,331
Are you telling me the
truth or is this a joke?

48
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,334
Pick up a second shift every now
and then, weekends if I want 'em.

49
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,794
It's good money.

50
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,089
Good money?
What, are you stupid, woman?

51
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,592
You quit stripping?

52
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,928
To pack fucking
mushrooms at Freemont?

53
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,305
- Sam.
- Ma, keep your mouth shut!

54
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,933
They're good to me over there, Sam.
They got daycare for Paige...

55
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,601
- No.
- ...medical at the end of the year.

56
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,603
I'll tell you what
you're gonna do.

57
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,313
You're going back
to the Bunny Hop,

58
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,358
and you're gonna get that cocksucker
to give you your old slot back.

59
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,111
You wanna go outside
and ride your bike?

60
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,779
- No, Sam.
- The fuck you ain't.

61
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,031
You're gonna get your ass back
up there and make your tips.

62
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,659
- It ain't right.
- Fuck are you talking about?

63
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,413
I ain't dancing no more because it
ain't right in the eyes of God.

64
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,666
- He don't want me doing that no more.
- Oh, you've found God now?

65
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,042
- That's what this is?
- He found me.

66
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,254
- Don't give me that bullshit!
- He's there for you too, baby.

67
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,632
You're a fucking junkie
stripper and you know it.

68
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,012
Not no more. God helped me
change while you was away.

69
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,890
Get your hands off of me.

70
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,980
You can't keep going the
way you've been going!

71
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,312
Hey, Big Dave, how's
it going, buddy?

72
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,280
What the fuck?
Crazy horse, there he fucking is!

73
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,157
- Donnie.
- It's about time, man.

74
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,744
- Holy shit.
- Figured you must be rollin' out sometime soon.

75
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,872
- Man. How you doing, boy?
- Look at you.

76
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,416
- I'm doing.
- Yeah? I get you.

77
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,377
You look no worse for the wear.

78
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,004
- I'm all right.
- Yeah?

79
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,090
You make any new
friends in there?

80
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,926
Funny fucker.

81
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,889
Hey, your old lady ain't at the Bunny
Hop any more. What's going on?

82
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,849
- Bitch found Jesus.
- No way.

83
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,976
Better him than the
milkman, right?

84
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,147
- Not so sure about that.
- Ah, yeah, right?

85
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,067
Glad to have you back.

86
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,402
- That's sweet.
- That's Jackie. Let's go.

87
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,154
Hey, here's to you.

88
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,697
Quit fucking around.

89
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,827
What, you want a taste?

90
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,788
Fuck, yeah.

91
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,498
All right. Get moving.

92
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,375
Come on, let's go.

93
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,126
Careful.

94
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,007
- Crazy horse.
- Crazy horse!

95
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,093
Crazy horse.

96
00:11:56,257 --> 00:12:00,595
<i>♪ Down at the cross
where my Saviour died</i>

97
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,682

nature was satisfied</i>

98
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:09,145

00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,857

00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:44,138
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

104
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,816
Cold.

105
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,985
It's right up here.

106
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,571
Open up, man! You there?

107
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
Come on, man, open up.

108
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,252
Fuck are you, man?

109
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,587
It's just me, man. Come on, let me in.
It's fucking cold.

110
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,631
- I don't know you.
- Yeah, you do.

111
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,842
We were hanging out the other day.
I'm Bobby's friend.

112
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,719
Fuck is Bobby?
Man, get your crack ass...

113
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,804
Okay, have it your way.

114
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,392
Shit!

115
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,441
Fuck that.

116
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,484
Where you going?

117
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,534
What the fuck are you running
from, pussy? Huh? Huh?

118
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,370
Piece of fucking shit!
You wanna fuck with me?

119
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,248
- I'll smash your fucking skull in!
- I'll give you whatever you want!

120
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,959
- I'll smash your fucking skull in.
- I'll give you whatever you want, man.

121
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,502
Tell me where the
fucking shit is

122
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,422
or I'll blow your nigger brains
all over the fucking floor!

123
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,049
It's in there! It's in there!

124
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,551
Get it! Get a fucking move on!

125
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,261
Piece of shit!

126
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,889
- Get a fucking move on!
- All right. Okay.

127
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,475
- Hurry the fuck up!
- Be cool.

128
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,978
Fuck, here's...
here's the shit, man. Fuck.

129
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,563
Be cool, man. Be cool.

130
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,315
Oh, shit. Oh, that's nice.

131
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,318
Give me the cash.
Give me the fucking cash!

132
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,072
You piece of shit.

133
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,156
All right!

134
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,741
Fucking nigger bitch.

135
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,034
All right!

136
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,620
- Be cool, man!
- Piece of shit.

137
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,289
Whoo!

138
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,541
Yeah! That was some crazy shit.

139
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,712
- That was pretty fun, I have to admit.
- Where'd the fucking ashtray go?

140
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,882
Shit, Donnie. Your car is a mess.
You gotta clean this shit up.

141
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,675
Yes, stick me, baby.

142
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,511
I'm ready to take off.

143
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,096
Get a wake up?

144
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,807
I want to hit this.
I'm going 100 miles an hour.

145
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,268
- This is some good shit.
- Fucking levitate!

146
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,812
Okay. Be still now, baby.

147
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,023
I'm still.
I'm still as a cucumber.

148
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,526
Yup. Find it?

149
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,487
We good? Yeah?

150
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,614
- Get the wheel, get the wheel.
- Got the wheel.

151
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

152
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,956
You got it! You got it.

153
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,749
I feel the need.

154
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,253
The need for fucking speed.

155
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,258
Whoa, whoa.
Look at this sorry fucker over here.

156
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,759
I see him.

157
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,470
- Should we pick him up?
- Yeah.

158
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,102
This is my good
deed for the day, right'?

159
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,937
- Come on, bro!
- Come on.

160
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,023
Fucking cold as hell.

161
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,900
Shit.

162
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,486
Ah, fuck.
Cold enough for you out there, boy?

163
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,904
Yeah.

164
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,406
Where you going, man?

165
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,574
Dushore.

166
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,367
That's up there
past Muncy, right?

167
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,618
Yeah.

168
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,454
We can take you as
far as McClure.

169
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,373
Take me to Dushore.

170
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,961
We ain't going to Dushore.
We said we can take you as far as...

171
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,839
What the fuck!

172
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,299
Keep driving.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

173
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,884
Take that fucking blade off him!

174
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,094
Dushore or I cut his
fucking throat.

175
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,555
Take that fucking blade off him!

176
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,017
No! Shit!

177
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,953
What are you doing?

178
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,496
Pull over!

179
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,468
Help me.

180
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,893
Good. Wanna try it again?

181
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,521
Okay.
Let's try it one more time.

182
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,983
- I pledge allegiance to the flag...
- To the flag...

183
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,527
- of the United States of America.
- Of the United States of America,

184
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,238

185
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,199
<i>One nation...</i>

186
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,701
<i>One nation...</i>

187
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,411
...under God...

188
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,870
...under God,

189
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:04,166
<i>indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.</i>

190
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,508
He coming or ain't he?

191
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,885
I don't know.

192
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,937
Honey, you ready?

193
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,359
I don't got no good shoes, Lynn.

194
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,613
Oh, baby, He don't care what
kind of shoes you wearing.

195
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,827
<i>He breathes his
spirit into the darkness,</i>

196
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,829
<i>and He makes something</i> good.

197
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,166
He sees our shadow and He
says, "Let there be light."

198
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,003
The point of receiving
God's word is life.

199
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,923
Life upon life and to
accept the blood of Jesus

200
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,885
that is life upon
life upon life.

201
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,971
Praise be to God. Praise be to God.

202
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,978
In Mark it talks about John the Baptist,
how he went about baptizing the water.

203
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,651
I'm unworthy even to unlace
the thong of his sandal.

204
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,071
I baptize the water.

205
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,573
But he will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit.

206
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,203
Let us now proclaim
His saving Grace.

207
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,081
If there are sinners here
today, looking for God,

208
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,668
I want you to raise your hands.
Come on, raise them up high to heaven.

209
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,881
Raise your hands and stand up.

210
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,257
Come on, now. Stand up.

211
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,635
Receive Jesus Christ as your
light and your Saviour.

212
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:48,104
Brother, I see it.
I see that look of doubt in your eye.

213
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,481
I know you're thinking, "I'm
just too dirty a sinner.

214
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,525
"He can't forgive
me." Yes, He can.

215
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,945
Yes, He can. You just knock and be received.
Come on now, stand up.

216
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,489
Come on home to Jesus. Yes.

217
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,117
Stand up. All right. All right.

218
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,869
Hallelujah.
We're gonna wash away our sins

219
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,330
in the blood of the lamb.
We're gonna baptize right now.

220
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,875
Come on down. Come on down right now.
Come on down.

221
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,212
Everybody. Come on down.

222
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,881
Come on down, brother and son.

223
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,136
Praise be to God.
We're gonna save some folks tonight.

224
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,097
Yes, come on down now.
Come on, Brother.

225
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,933
We're gonna save you now.

226
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,936
Come on in. Yes, I want you
to cross your arms now.

227
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,313
Cross your arms. Yes.

228
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,233
Stand right here. Okay.

229
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,821
Upon your confession of faith and
your obedience to the word of God,

230
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,948
regarding His death,
burial and resurrection.

231
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,618
I do indeed baptize you in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ

232
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,079
for the remission of your sins.

233
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,545
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

234
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,592
Welcome home, Brother.
Welcome home. You're saved.

235
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,095
Hallelujah! Praise God.

Hey.

246
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,828
Here you go.
Thanks for the work.

247
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,915
Hey, you need me
to stay on, I can.

248
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,959
We're gonna be moving
inside next week.

249
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,962
I'll give you a call if something breaks.
You do good work.

250
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,173
Thanks.

251
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,051
And out of the houses
the rats came tumbling.

252
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,387
Brother rats, sister rats.

253
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,431
And husband rats followed
their little rat wives.

254
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,309
<i>Till they came to
the ragin' water,</i>

255
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,271
<i>where they drowned and
lost their lives.</i>

256
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:41,277
I don't deal bikes. You might have a
better shot if you take it over to Pitt,

257
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,987
or maybe down to Philly.

258
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,905
I gotta sell it today.

259
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,829
I got something in Pitt.

260
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,914
But you gotta have
some college for that.

261
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,078
Well, well, well.

262
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,457
I was wondering when I'd
see you again, man.

263
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,043
How you doing, my brother?

264
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,963
I'm doing.

265
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,299
Yeah.

266
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,842
I've missed you.

267
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,975
I heard you found Jesus.

268
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,145
Yeah, a little bit.

269
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,108
Hallelujah.

270
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,655
Hey, Jackie.
Give me a mash and a bud.

271
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,367
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Jackie.

272
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,785
You want something?

273
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,370
No. I'm good.

274
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,455
Uh-huh.

275
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:21,710
Hey, you know...
that old Indian didn't die that night.

276
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,170
What?

277
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,130
Yeah, saw it on the TV.

278
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,801
Somebody picked the poor bastard up.
Took him to the emergency room.

279
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,264
Can you believe that shit?

280
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,518
God was looking out for both
of us, I suppose, then.

281
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,816
Here's to Him.

282
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,610
Yeah.

283
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,949
I didn't hear you pull up.

284
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,700
No.

285
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,537
I got Lynn's car.

286
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,373
She broke down on you?

287
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,168
I sold her.

288
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,713
No fucking way, man.

289
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,592
Should have come and seen
your old buddy first.

290
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,261
I know. I know.

291
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,973
You want a taste?

292
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,996
I'm sorry I'm late.

293
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,720
Gave blood over in Pitt.

294
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,145
It's all I got.

295
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,616
<i>We're tracking what now
looks like a tornado outbreak.</i>

296
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,785
<i>We've now confirmed
two tornadoes</i>

297
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,996
<i>that have touched down
in the Harrisburg area.</i>

298
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,123
Two touched down
near Harrisburg.

299
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,585
<i>Moving northeast towards Allentown,
Reading and Lancaster.</i>

300
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,637
Paige.

301
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,890
Come on, Paige, you gotta get up.

302
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,644
Wake up.

303
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,604
Come on, come on, come on.

304
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,237
Baby?

305
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,239
Baby, what are you doing?

306
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,575
I know.

307
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,995
Hey.

308
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,497
Stand back.

309
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,137
Get in.

310
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,447
Bug.

311
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,992
You hear me? You hear me, bug?

312
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,827
We're going to play
the game, bug.

313
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,953
Whale!

314
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,455
I'm thinking of a snail, bug.

315
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,458
I'm thinking of a whale.

316
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,045
Good job, bug. Good job.

317
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,384
You said whale.
I'm thinking of a pail.

318
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,722
You said pail.
I'm thinking of a tail.

319
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,855
Good job, bug. Good job.

320
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,048
Sam!

321
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,926
Hey, Billy.

322
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,763
Tried ringing you, but
your phone's down.

323
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,683
That damn twister touched down eight
places between here and Noblesville.

324
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,102
Chewed up 600 homes in
Fulton County alone.

325
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,980
Got all the work you can
handle, if you're interested.

326
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,649
I'm interested.

327
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,193
But I'm putting my
own crew together.

328
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,820
We go 50-50 on the jobs.

329
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,323
You cover me and any
heavy machines I need.

330
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,034
60-40 till you pay me
back on the tools.

331
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,078
Then we go half and
you got a deal.

332
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,757
I can still see.

333
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,802
- Keep them closed.
- What are you doing, Sam Childers?

334
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,303
- Ready?
- Yes.

335
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,513
Yes.

336
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,973
Open them up.

337
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,060
Where are we?

338
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,729
We're home, Paige.

339
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,064
That's ours?

340
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,149
Go on, check it out.

341
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,697
Your room's upstairs.
It's the small one.

342
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,285
That's everything.

343
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,204
You get what's
in the trunk?

344
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,414
Yup.

345
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,668
Lord, you are filthy,
Sam Childers.

346
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,880
Who you calling filthy, woman?

347
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,090
You.

348
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,968
Now you're filthier than I am.

349
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,685
Come on, give me a little shake.

350
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,062
Mmm-mmm.
I don't do that no more.

351
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,605
<i>- Uh-huh?
- Mmm-mmm.</i>

352
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,482
Not even for your old man?

353
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,528
Maybe just a little bit.

354
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,029
There you go.

355
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,616
You're naughty.

356
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,577
Come here.

357

Today we have a special guest.

361
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,991
It is my pleasure to present
to you Pastor Relling

362
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:11,661
from the Kilangire Christian
Mission in Uganda, Africa.

363
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,413
Pastor Relling.

364
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,879
Thank you, Pastor
Krause, and thank you,

365
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,466
brothers and sisters, for inviting
me into this house of the Lord.

366
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,845
I'm here today to talk to you about
your Christian brothers and sisters,

367
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,809
families just like yours, half a world
away, that desperately need your help.

368
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,853
Though they might
appear to be strangers,

369
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,398
living a life very
different from our own,

370
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,652
in God's eyes, every
man is a brother,

371
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:49,199
and every soul is deserving
of your Christian charity.

372
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,414
Don't move.

373
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,127
Be cool.

374
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,554
What the fuck, man.
What are you doing here?

375
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,684
I'm here for that
boy right there.

376
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,437
You gonna get in
the way of that?

377
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,873
Oh, Sammy, I can't do it.
I can't. I can't.

378
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,375
God don't make trash, boy.

379
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,796
He ain't giving up on you so don't
you give up on Him, you hear me?

380
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,511
What was wrong with her anyway?

381
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,638
I don't know.
They called it thrombosis.

382
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,640
And she couldn't walk, she
couldn't drive any more.

383
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,185
But you know, I think that prayer circle
made all the difference in the world.

384
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,521
- And now she can get her hair done.
- That's right.

385
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,857
Babe, why don't you go grab
some more beans, will you?

386
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,736
You know, I was thinking
about that fella, Sunday.

387
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,154
What fella?

388
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,407
That Pastor Relling.

389
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,827
- The missionary fella.
A nice-looking man.

390
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,621
Oh, yeah, he talked funny.

391
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,123
He's just from a difference place
than us, baby, that's all.

392
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,125
I like what they're
doing down there.

393
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,586
- It's a good cause.
- Sure is.

394
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,798
I was thinking maybe I could
go over there. You know?

395
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,301
See what they got going on.

396
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,553
- Africa?
- Yeah.

397
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,681
- You mean like to help them?
- Yeah, why not?

398
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,975
Reckon they can do with all
the help they can get.

399
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,518
Especially in construction.

400
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,978
Oh, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

401
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,897
- Well, that's a good idea.
- Thought I'd go and do that.

402
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,899
What about the business?

403
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,610
What about that job you've
got going over in Boswell?

404
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,904
Job's gonna be
finished in five days.

405
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,490
I'll only be gone for
a few weeks though.

406
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,575
I'll be back before you know it.

407
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,954
It's not so
long, we'll be fine.

408
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,121
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

409
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,623
It's not so long.

410
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,458
- Yeah? Yeah?
- It's a nice idea, Sam.

411
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,286
What are you?

412
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,747
Ugandan Army or something?

413
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,501
SPLA. Sudanese People's
Liberation Army.

414
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,920
Yeah, I don't know that.
What's that?

415
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,506
We are freedom fighters.

416
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,887
Well, hello, freedom fighters.
I'm Sam.

417
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,431
My name is Deng.

418
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,935
Deng? Nice to meet you, Deng.
Sam.

419
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,314
- Marco.
- Hey, Marco.

420
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,067
So, you boys busy or...

421
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,612
Maybe you can give me a
hand with the rubble.

422
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,910
No. I didn't think so.
All right. Good.

423
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,914
Well, I'll let you guys get
back to what you were doing.

424
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,834
But I'll be seeing you around.

425
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,844
Childers.

426
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,221
Some of us are going into
Kampala tomorrow night.

427
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,058
Try to find a little fun this weekend.
You wanna come along?

428
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,978
Actually, I was thinking
of going up north.

429
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,732
You crazy? There's a civil
war going on up there.

430
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,525
I know.

431
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,446
Suit yourself.

432
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,791
Hey, Deng, want a Coke?

433
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,292
Yes.

434
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,922
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

435
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,173
Ooh.

436
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,884
You got a cool breeze blowing
through the shade here.

437
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,470
It's very hot today.

438
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,721
Yeah.

439
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,891
I got a question for you.

440
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,853
I wanna go into
Sudan this weekend.

441
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,648
I need someone to
show me around.

442
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,566
You interested?

443
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,195
The others are going to Kampala.

444
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,488
I know.

445
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,950
That ain't my speed no more.
I wanna see some country.

446
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,872
You want to see?

447
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,841
This thing go any faster?

448
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,467
I wish it could.

449
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,554
Travelling is the most
dangerous time in Sudan.

450
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,808
If the rebels find us on open
road, it will be very bad.

451
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,397
So where you from?

452
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,275
A little village called Aweil.

453
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,694
Many hours from here. And you?

454
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,696
Are you from New York City?

455
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,905
No.

456
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,907
I ain't no city boy.

457
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,702
I'm a hillbilly
from Pennsylvania.

458
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,413
Pennsylvania.

459
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,332
That's it. Pennsylvania.

460
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,835
Pennsylvania.

461
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,046
Is Aweil where your family is?

462
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,010
Not any more.
My family was killed by the IRA.

463
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,160
The Muslim north
has been killing

464
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,913
the Christians in the
south for over 30 years.

465
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,751
Two million of my people
lost their lives.

466
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,421
These people have been
driven from their villages.

467
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,466
But as you can see, these
camps are not much better.

468
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,847
Cholera and malaria
are everywhere.

469
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,227
Even here, they are afraid the
IRA will attack at night.

470
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,067
Sorry, I will be right back.

471
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,318
Course.

472
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,861
Do what you gotta do.

473
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,951
Excuse me, you.

474
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,620
Black shirt. Come over here.
Please help me.

475
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,831
I need to transfer this woman to the bed.
Grab her by her shoulders.

476
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,336
One, two, three.

477
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,298
- What do we have here?
- Trauma to the lips.

478
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,676
Can I have some gauze,
please, for direct pressure?

479
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,930
- What happened?
- Trauma to her lips.

480
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,682
What happened to her face?

481
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,518
She argued with the rebels
so they cut off her lips.

482
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,270
These are Kony's orders.

483
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,771
Who's Kony?

484
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,940
Who are you with?

485
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,152
I'm with Deng over there.

486
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,321
Which organization?

487
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,907
I'm with the Christian
group down in the south.

488
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,077
Just up here taking
a look around.

489
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,374
This isn't a tourist
destination; This is a war zone.

490
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,377
If you stay here, you're
going to get killed.

491
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,505
Thank you for your help.

492
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,719
Some people say Kony's a wizard.
A shape-shifter.

493
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,514
He calls himself a Christian,
but I say he's Satan,

494
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,766
who devours his own people.

495
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,520
So, Kony is the...
He's the leader of the IRA?

496
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,523
Yes, he's the one we've
been fighting for years.

497
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,151
But there's very
little we can do.

498
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,988
Our weapons are old, our
boots full of holes.

499
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,365
We've been forgotten
by the whole world.

500
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,245
What are you doing here?

501
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,831
Excuse me?

502
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,208
What are you looking
for in this place?

503
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,212
I ain't looking for nothing.

504
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,549
So, you get your picture taken?

505
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:31,637
Go back to your life and all this will
be stories you will tell your friends.

506
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,849
Yeah, maybe.

507
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,898
Hey, can I take a
look at that gun?

508
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,905
You say she's jamming on you?

509
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,990
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

510
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:56,371
Yeah. Yeah, that's cause
she's full of dirt.

511
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,373
Dirt and grit.

512
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,876
You gotta strip her down once a day.
Keep her well-oiled.

513
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,962
No wonder she's jamming on you.

514
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,923
Are you military?

515
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,257
Hell, no.

516
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,676
I just like my guns.

517
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,083
The night commuters.

518
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,961
They come from deep in the bush.

519
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,297
Their parents send them out
because it's safer to sleep here

520
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,425
than in their own homes.

521
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,136
Why?

522
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,265
Because death comes at
night in the villages.

523
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,351
These are the lucky ones so far.

524
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,687
The ones the rebels
haven't found yet.

525
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:10,987
<i>Sam.</i>

526
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,495
Come on! Get up, let's go.

527
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,665
Come on, get up.
Let's go. Get up.

528
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,626
Hey, get up. Let's go.

529
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,629
Get a move on. Get up.

530
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,673
- Hey, come on. Get up.
- What are you doing?

531
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,009
Let's go. Get up.
They ain't sleeping out here.

532
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:36,471
Tell them they're coming inside.
Come on, you all get up.

533
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,681
- Sam.
- Let's go.

534
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,017
Sam. There are too many.

535
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,060
You can't help them all.

536
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,357
Well, I can take
these ones here.

537
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,277
Yeah. Come on inside.

538
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,404
Come on. Hurry up.

539
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,576
Keep 'em coming.

540
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,162
Go on. Take a bed.

541
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,414
<i>Sam.</i>

542
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,168
<i>Sam.</i>

543
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,546
The IRA attacked a
village last night.

544
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,216
You said you wanted to see.

545
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,673
You see any tigers over there?

546
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,009
No, I didn't see no tigers.

547
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,054
Do they even have
tigers over there?

548
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,682
I don't think so.

549
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,352
You go on a safari?

550
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:58,691
No. I didn't go on no safari.
Come on. Let's go to bed.

551
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,571
- There we go.
- I'm thinking of a plane.

552
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:07,658
- No, no, come on. You gotta get to sleep.
- Come on, Dad, plane. I'm thinking of a plane.

553
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,206
You said plane, I'm
thinking of a train.

554
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,668
You said train, I'm
thinking of a brain.

555
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,380
You said brain, I'm
thinking of a...

556
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,799
- Gotcha. Okay.
- Okay, you got me.

557
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,178
You could have said drain or
mane, like a horse's mane.

558
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,888
Sweet dreams, bug.

559
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,181
Good night, Dad.

560
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,682
Good night.

561
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,727
I'm glad you're home.

562
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,692
Coming to bed?

563
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,155
Yeah, in a bit.

564
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,550
Baby...

565
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,595
Baby...

566
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,683
What you doing?

567
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,186
Making plans.

568
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,147
You been to bed yet?

569
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,315
No.

570
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,611
I had a vision last night, Lynn.

571
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:11,949
I know it sounds crazy,
but God spoke to me.

572
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,827
Here. Take a look at this.

573
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,705
You want to take a look?

574
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,458
I'm going to build a church.

575
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,585
A church?

576
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,004
Yeah. Right across the street.

577
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,216
But not a church like Faith United
or Calvary Fellowship, you know.

578
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,884
A place that ain't
gonna turn you away

579
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,596
if you're a prostitute or
drug addict or something.

580
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,933
A place for sinners just like me, but
who want to hear the word of God.

581
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,228
How you gonna pay for a church?

582
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,690
Well, we got money in the
bank, business is good.

583
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,192
Besides, I own a
construction company,

584
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,570
so I'm gonna give us one heck
of a good deal on the build.

585
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,488
You're crazy.

586
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,656
A little bit.

587
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,494
Now here, take a look at this.

588
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,376
What is that?

589
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,881
That's the orphanage
that I'm going to build.

590
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,050
In Sudan.

591
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,597
Frank, make sure
that siding's long.

592
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,182
All right, Sam.

593
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,402
♪ <i>I witness</i>

594
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:35,282

- Yup.

599
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,963
It's five till and
he still ain't here.

600
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,090
Call him?

601
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,966
Yeah, I called him.

602
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,386
Well, then, call him again.

603
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:00,099

611
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:47,730
Thank you, Tory. Now you folks are
sounding pretty good up here.

612
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,732
Gotta say.

613
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,444
Sam.

614
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,531
Sorry. There we go.

615
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,950
How's that? Good?

616
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,869
Good. Yeah.

617
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,164
Well, I'd like to thank you
all for coming out today,

618
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,459
for the first day of worship here
at Shekinah Fellowship Church.

619
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,676
Thank you.

620
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:21,472
Never really been too keen on
talking in front of people.

621
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,309
But the guest speaker we had
today, well, he didn't show up,

622
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,644
so I thought I would get
up and say a few words.

623
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,565
Okay, well, lot of youse
knows me pretty good.

624
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,152
Knows I ain't exactly the
best seed in the bunch.

625
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:39,490
Maybe you was wondering what made
me want to build this here church.

626
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,952
I gotta tell you that standing up here
right now, I ain't so sure myself.

627
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,666
But God don't only
call the good.

628
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,753
I reckon every now and again
he calls us sinners too,

629
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,880
and I was about as
bad as they come.

630
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,010
Bunch of years ago I
was in the woods.

631
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:04,431
I was running from some pretty bad fellas
in the woods over there by Cleary.

632
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,978
And those old boys, they was
coming after me pretty hard.

633
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:13,106
Well, I reached in my bag.
I was looking for my old shotgun.

634
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,818
Well, it was gone.

635
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,614
And my <i>momma</i> had took it
out when I wasn't looking...

636
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,868
and shoved this here Bible in there instead.
Yes, she did.

637
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:25,994
All right, Momma.

638
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:33,335
Well, I figured I was
pretty much done for,

639
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:37,422
so I sat down under an oak tree
with this useless book in my hand

640
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:38,549
and I just waited.

641
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,594
And then the strangest
thing happened.

642
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,932
Those boys, they just,
they ran right on past me.

643
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,060
They didn't even see
me sitting there.

644
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,774
Nowthe way I figure it, things would
have turned out pretty different

645
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:59,611
if I'd pulled out that shotgun
instead of this here Bible.

646
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,782
But you know, it
got me thinking.

647
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,538
God is looking out for each
and every one of you, too.

648
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,042
And all you gotta do
is just open the door,

649
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,836
and let Him right on in.

650
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,005
Amen! Amen!

651
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,392
It's okay, sweetie.
I'll be back before you know it.

652
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,811
You're gonna miss my play.

653
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,439
Well, Momma can
videotape it for me.

654
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,482
I gotta get.

655
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,694
You watch out for them while
I'm gone, buddy, okay?

656
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,487
That's done, man.

657
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,468
You came all the way here
to bring us some new boots?

658
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,643
Okay, okay, Okay...

659
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,191
Right here. Stop the car.
Stop the car.

660
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,826
<i>Sam.</i>

661
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,833
Sam, wait.

662
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,086
It's not safe here.

663
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,843
This is it.

664
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,181
This is not a good idea.

665
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,601
I think it's a heck
of a good idea.

666
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,438
It would be better a little
further south, towards Kampala.

667
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,276
Oh. If I wanted to be closer to
Kampala I'd be closer to Kampala.

668
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,153
But I want to be right here.

669
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:09,491
What are you saying?
What's he saying?

670
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,118
Said the north is
very dangerous.

671
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,663
Villages in this area are
very remote, Mr Childers.

672
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,206
There's nothing there.

673
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:19,334
Then I would think that them
people need help the most.

674
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,298
This is a war zone, Mr Childers.

675
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,551
The IRA will kill you.

676
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,097
Look, I don't think you
understand what I'm saying,

677
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,558
so let me make it
real clear to you.

678
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,020
I'm buying this land.

679
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,480
<i>This is what can unite us.</i>

680
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,025
<i>Arabism cannot unite us.</i>

681
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,862
<i>Africanism that is opposed
to Orba cannot unite us.</i>

682
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,489
<i>Islam cannot unite us.</i>

683
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:53,618
<i>But Sudanism, Sudanism
can unite us</i>

684
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:56,038
<i>because it is a common factor.</i>

685
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,827
I told you. Stay out of there.

686
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,747
You'll get all dirty.

687
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,626
- Sure you don't want to play someplace else?
- No.

688
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:44,419
No.

689
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,050
- Sam.
- Yeah.

690
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,719
This is Betty.
She's from Kotido.

691
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,387
Hey, Betty. How are ya?

692
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,139
I'm fine, how are you?

693
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,516
I'm okay.

694
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,185
She knows you need
someone to run the orphanage.

695
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,436
Yeah.

696
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,979
I said stay out of there.

697
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,233
I'm looking for somebody, help
me keep the place in order,

698
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,944
look after things
while I'm away.

699
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,529
She can do this.

700
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,656
And now, what about
the children?

701
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:16,201
Can she feed the children?
Fix them up when they're sick?

702
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,494
Can she do that?

703
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,252
She's hired.

704
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,546
Thank you.

705
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,687
You say your prayers
or something?

706
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,313
I already did.

707
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,360
All right. Sweet dreams.

708
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,987
Ain't you gonna read me a book?

709
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,739
No.

710
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,286
Then let's play a game.

711
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,537
Yeah.

712
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,749
I'm thinking of a dog.

713
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,544
What about it?

714
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,131
Never mind, Donnie.

715
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,383
All right.

716
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,679
My dad usually gives me a kiss on
the forehead before he leaves.

717
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,682
You can do that.

718
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,519
Yeah. Sure.

719
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,610
Night, Donnie.

720
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,154
Sweet dreams

721
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,578
<i>♪ Busy, busy everybody's busy</i>

722
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,163
<i>♪ Playing the game of life</i>

723
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,933
<i>♪ But now it's time
to say a rhyme</i>

724
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,184
♪ <i>Let's all have some fun</i> ♪

725
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,411
- How many are there?
- Around 20.

726
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,127
Where are your men?

727
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,462
Down there.

728
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,051
Get me a gun.

729
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:56,152
We've got to get everyone back to the church.
That's our best shot.

730
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,196
I'm going to get the kids.
Cover me.

731
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,668
Betty, Betty, bring them to the church!
Come on.

732
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,022
Come on.
Tell them to stay together.

733
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,024
Stay close.

734
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,526
Come on.

735
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,361
Get down!

736
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,948
Go on.

737
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,086
Get them in.

738
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,852
Okay, get in the corner.
Get in the corner.

739
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:17,901
Get in the corner!
Get in the corner!

740
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,027
All right, you'll be fine.

741
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,280
Come on, come on.

742
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,234
Hello?

743
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,902
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

744
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,904
You okay?

745
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,073
<i>It's all gone. All of it.</i>

746
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,077
They burnt it down.

747
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,662
Nothing left.

748
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:56,916
Where are you?

749
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,626
Nimule.

750
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,920
<i>It's a test, Sam.</i>

751
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:05,425
<i>I can't do it no more, Lynn.
It's over.</i>

752
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,303
<i>Sam.</i>

753
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,221
<i>Yeah.</i>

754
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,182
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

755
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,809
Yeah, I can hear you.

756
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,730
<i>Them kids have had their whole lives
burnt to the ground and worse.</i>

757
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,857
<i>How many of them you
see giving up?</i>

758
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,611
God gave you purpose,
Sam Childers.

759
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:29,157
<i>Now get off your butt, stop your
crying and build it again.</i>

760
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,701
You hear me?

761
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,313
Cut it all down.

762
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:04,526
<i>Till they got nowhere to hide.</i>

763
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:11,407
Up. Down.

764
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,790
All right, outfielders.
Stand nice and spread out.

765
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,583
Hey, what's this?

766
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,378
No patty cakes. None of that.

767
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,840
You're the short stop.
You're here. Don't move.

768
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,968
Poppy, you ready?

769
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,387
Remember what I said?

770
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,766
Put your right hand
there, left hand there.

771
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,227
Now you swing through.

772
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,812
There you go.

773
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,565
Yeah?

774
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,150
- You look great, Poppy.
- Yeah.

775
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,402
You look great.
Matak, pay attention.

776
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,322
- Ready to pitch? ls everybody ready?
- Yes.

777
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,575
Everybody ready, outfield?
All right.

778
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,287
Let's play baseball.
All right, Matak.

779
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,913
Nice and easy.

780
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,708
Give me a pitch.

781
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,752
What are you doing?

782
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,755
Don't kick the ball.
What are you doing?

783
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,466
It's supposed to be baseball.

784
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,527
What happened?

785
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,738
There was an attack
outside Adjumani.

786
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,633
What's she saying?

787
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,135
She's asking what she did wrong.

788
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,139
You didn't do nothing wrong.

789
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,354
She wants to know if
you are the preacher.

790
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,691
I'm the preacher.

791
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:55,071
You tell her she's
going to be okay.

792
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,311
- Where you going?
- Adjumani.

793
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,731
Sam. Sam, please wait.

794
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:33,734
No, I ain't waiting around
no more for this to happen.

795
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,403
See what waiting gets you?

796
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,350
Shit.

797
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,397
Marco, no! Marco!

798
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,775
Don't fire that thing!

799
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,194
There's kids behind the truck!

800
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,547
RPG!

801
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,245
You okay?

802
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,744
It's okay.

803
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:49,467
Hey, buddy.

804
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,806
Ain't you gonna say nothing?

805
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,102
I'll see you later.

806
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,484
I see you have a bodyguard.

807
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:07,735
Guess I do.

808
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,700
Take care of things
while I'm gone, okay?

809
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,535
- I will, Preacher.
- All right.

810
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,294
You can't come with me, buddy.

811
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,508
Come on.

812
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:49,151
In your actions, you give
service to the Lord.

813
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:54,114
He's not interested in your good intentions.
Your good thoughts.

814
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:59,787
No, He wants your backs.
Your hands. Your sweat.

815
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:05,376
Your blood to pour into the foundation
that will build up His kingdom!

816
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,127
- Amen!
- Amen!

817
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,967
- What do you think?
- I think it's great.

818
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,636
Started day care last month.

819
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,513
Monday through Friday
from 8:00 to 2:00.

820
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:21,100
Sundays after first worship for a
few hours if anybody needs it.

821
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:27,064
I'm thinking maybe we could
set up a playground...

822
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,484
some swings, some things
that kids can climb on.

823
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,653
No, we can't build any more.
Not for a while.

824
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:34,405
You said Sundays has been full.

825
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:38,659
Yeah, it's been full, but that doesn't
mean people are giving money like today.

826
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:43,455
You know, economy's slow, construction
business is slow. Times is tight.

827
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,252
- Be good for them kids, Lynn.
- Yeah, well, they got the playground

828
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:49,378
over at Cairnbrook,

829
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:51,380
and they can play at the school
on the weekends if they want.

830
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:54,425
No, no.
No, I'm talking about Africa.

831
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:59,179
I heard you built yourself one hell
of a church over there in Central City.

832
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,349
Yeah, we set it up pretty good,
but we still got a ways to go.

833
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:05,686
Anyways, Bill.
The reason I called you...

834
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,396
the reason I'm here is because

835
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:11,358
I wanted to talk to you...
a little bit more about our Outreach Programme.

836
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:13,485
You know, the thing we're
doing over there in Africa.

837
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,613
Of course, I know about what
you're doing over there.

838
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:19,909
I mean, hell of a thing, Sam, helping
out those kids. God bless you.

839
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,953
Thank you, Bill.
I appreciate that. I do.

840
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,665
But I gotta be straight with you.
We are hurting for money.

841
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:30,252
Now if we had the support of
good people like yourselves,

842
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,379
sure would help things go a
lot smoother over there.

843
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:35,215
Sam, everybody around here
is feeling the pinch.

844
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,259
I hear that, Bill. I do.

845
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,429
But if you once could just see
what it is we're doing down there.

846
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:44,642
I mean, it's about more than the money.
And I ain't asking for a lot.

847
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,312
- How much you looking for?
- $5,000 or something.

848
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,272
Jesus Christ, Sam. $5,000?

849
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,524
Come on, Bill. That ain't
hardly gonna put you out there

850
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,777
- on the street now, is it?
- Well, that's not the point.

851
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,113
And that's gonna keep them doors
open for another six months.

852
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,407
Look around here.

853
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,826
People are losing their
jobs left and right.

854
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,204
It's tough to go asking
for $5,000 for a bunch

855
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,456
of African children
halfway around the world.

856
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,625
Bill, I understand that -
we got problems right here,

857
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,211
- but this is a different kind of problem.
- Different, how?

858
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,713
That orphanage is the
last hope these kids got.

859
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,550
Now with that kind of money, we can
feed them kids, house them kids.

860
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,011
Buy me a new generator
which is sorely needed.

861
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:24,223
I gotta tell you, Bill, you would
be saving a hell of a lot of lives.

862
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,562
All right. Here's what I'll do.
I'll see what I can come up with.

863
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,107
- Okay.
- All right.

864
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:35,985
- Okay, Bill.
- Okay.

865
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:39,571
Hey, why don't you bring the
family over next Sunday.

866
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,198
We're having a little
bit of a barbeque.

867
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:47,371
Well, come on in.
You all must be the Childers, welcome.

868
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:50,290
I am Shannon, Bill's
ball and chain.

869
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:54,420
- I'm Lynn. This here is Paige.
- Good to meet you.

870
01:17:56,255 --> 01:18:00,092
There he is.
Hey, Sam, glad you all could make it.

871
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:03,053
- Oh, who's this lovely young lady?
- Paige.

872
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,889
I'll tell you what.
You come on in here and you meet some people.

873
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,767
This is the gentleman I
was telling you about.

874
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:32,833
Sam. There you are.

875
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:37,546
A little something for the kids out there.
What we were talking about earlier.

876
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,923
- Thank you.
- Yeah, don't mention it.

877
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:58,067
- Why are we leaving so soon?
- Get in the car.

878
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:01,111
- Is everything all right?
- Thank you.

879
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,613
What is wrong?

880
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:06,575
Son of a bitch is crying
poor-mouth to me,

881
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:09,369
and he's living in
a damn Taj Mahal.

882
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:16,251
I asked him for $5,000 to feed
a bunch of motherless babies.

883
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:20,172
And you know what he gave me?
150 bucks.

884
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:23,884
He spent more than that
on salsa for his party.

885
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,515
We are locked in a
fight with the devil.

886
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:35,604
Now I can't do this on my own.
I can't take the pressure

887
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,941
and the pain and the loneliness.

888
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,819
I need each one of
you to back me up.

889
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:46,240
And I need you all to bring your game.
And the Lord will raise you up!

890
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:47,616
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

891
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,159
Hallelujah!

892
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:53,872
If we have to cut back,
then the devil has won.

893
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,501
<i>And we don'!
Want the devil to win, do we?</i>

894
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,836
<i>No!</i>

895
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,139
I'm sorry, but 2,500 is the
best I can do for those guns.

896
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:13,016
Tell you what.
Throw in the car for five.

897
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:17,938
Almost there.

898
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:26,530
Hands over eyes.
Micrah, no cheating. No cheating.

899
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:31,118
Just a little bit more.
Okay, stop.

900
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,787
Open your eyes.

901
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:35,831
Yeah!

902
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:43,630
Come on.

903
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,179
Thank you.

904
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,471
It's all right.

905
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,908
It's good to see the kids laugh.

906
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,702
Amen to that.

907
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:20,167
Listen, I would like to add a few
more guards to you during the day.

908
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:21,418
Why?

909
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:24,254
Because Kony's offering
money for your head.

910
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:28,508
- Offering money for my head?
- Yes.

911
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,975
I must be doing something right.

912
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:47,486
Don't worry about it.
I can take care of myself.

913
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:54,743
He said anything yet?

914
01:21:55,661 --> 01:22:00,082
All we know is that him and his
brother were taken by the rebels.

915
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:02,542
- Where's his brother?
- We don't know.

916
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:14,763
You don't want to go play
with the other kids?

917
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:21,478
You know, sometimes it
helps to tell somebody

918
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:23,897
what you got locked up inside.

919
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:44,376
I've done a lot of things
that I ain't proud of.

920
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,796
Hurt a lot of people.

921
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:55,387
Truth is, helping you kids is about the only
good thing I've ever done in this life.

922
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,770
But I'm scared that...
one day I'll...

923
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:10,068
close my eyes to all this and
make it somebody else's problem.

924
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:20,329
You got no idea what
I'm saying, do you?

925
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,056
Who's that?

926
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,317
It's our leader.

927
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,445
John Garang?

928
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:06,666
So, they call you the White Preacher.
Is this what I should call you?

929
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,253
You can call me Sam.

930
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,508
I hear what you are doing for the
children of Sudan and I'm grateful.

931
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:16,343
I just wanted to see it myself.

932
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:21,056
Well, this is it.
We've got a couple hundred with us here.

933
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:25,394
Feed another thousand a
day, nearby villages.

934
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:29,022
And you do this.
And yet these are not your people.

935
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,982
The struggle is not your own.

936
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:34,528
Yeah, well, I've kinda
made it my struggle.

937
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:37,072
Till someone else starts fighting
the fight for these children,

938
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,032
then I'm the one
that's gonna do it.

939
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:41,201
- You're just stubborn, aren't you?
- As a mule.

940
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,831
I wish I had more men like you.

941
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:50,794
There are peace talks scheduled
for the end of August in Russia.

942
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,339
I would like you to
come as my guest.

943
01:24:56,091 --> 01:25:00,804
You know, talking about peace in a room
somewhere is a waste of time, if you ask me.

944
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:03,098
You gotta go out and make it.

945
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:06,059
You speak what is on your mind.
I heard this about you.

946
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,437
Really? What else did you hear?

947
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,148
Well, I heard that you
don't suffer fools.

948
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:14,443
And that you like a good fight.

949
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:16,820
I heard you were taller.

950
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:21,116
So you see, we're not
so dissimilar, Sam.

951
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:24,327
You made the fight for these
children your struggle.

952
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:27,998
And I made the freedom of
Southern Sudan my struggle.

953
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,625
But part of my struggle
happens in these rooms.

954
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,335
I hear you.

955
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,841
So you think maybe we could convince
you to come to peace talks one day?

956
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:40,427
Maybe.

957
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:50,729
Should be coming out soon.

958
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:55,275
Anybody see anything?

959
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,819
Marco! See something?

960
01:25:58,236 --> 01:25:59,529
Nothing. Nothing.

961
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:02,699
I don't know.

962
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:13,627
Should be around here.
You should pull over.

963
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:23,595
- The intel was very clear.
- I don't see nothing.

964
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,972
This is it.

965
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:30,227
No, wait, wait.
There. I got two.

966
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:32,938
Right there.

967
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:46,159
Come on.
Come on, it's okay. Come on.

968
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:51,706
Okay, they ain't moving.

969
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:54,084
AJ, Nineteen. Go get those kids.

970
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:58,046
Deng, call camp, tell them we're coming
back with two, possibly injured.

971
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,186
Be careful.

972
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:30,745
What'd he say?

973
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:33,665
What's he saying?

974
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:34,833
AJ is dead!

975
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,926
Tell him don't move. Okay?

976
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,219
Don't move!

977
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:49,723
Stay down!

978
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,683
Ask him if he saw the shooter.

979
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,148
Did not see him.

980
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:08,241
- You see him?
- He's on the ridge. Within the rocks.

981
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,744
Can you reach the Mauser?

982
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:23,590
When I say go, I want you to put all
you got into those rocks up there.

983
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:25,383
Ready?

984
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:27,510
Go!

985
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:31,032
- Hello?
- Sam, <i>it's</i> me, man.

986
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,288
Donnie.

987
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,502
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

988
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:48,133
<i>Yeah, everybody's great, man.
I'm just calling to say hey, that's all.</i>

989
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:51,261
Hey.

990
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:54,806
How are the girls?

991
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,349
<i>Oh, they're doing great, man.</i>

992
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:58,977
Yeah, Paige made us
dinner the other night.

993
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,603
Chocolate chip pancakes.

994
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:02,981
<i>By herself, huh?</i>

995
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:06,651
Yeah. All by herself.
I mean, I helped her with the stove.

996
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,487
But, you know, she
mixed it all up.

997
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,990
<i>They were real good,</i> too.

998
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:18,121
So, how's it going over there?

999
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:22,083
<i>It's going fine, buddy.</i>

1000
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:24,043
Yeah?

1001
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:27,630
Man, that must be wild. I'd like to come
over there sometime, check it out, you know?

1002
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:30,216
<i>Get the hell out of
here for a while.</i>

1003
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:32,844
<i>That'd be nice.
See what that's like.</i>

1004
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:36,055
Sounds good.

1005
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:40,393
<i>- Hey, Sam, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.</i>

1006
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:46,357
You really think... God's gonna
forgive us for everything we done?

1007
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,961
Is that all the
soy milks we got?

1008
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:18,932
They talk about you in the camps.
The children.

1009
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:23,186
They say there is a white
preacher who hunts the IRA.

1010
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,689
This place does not need
more guns, Mr Childers.

1011
01:31:26,773 --> 01:31:29,317
Just trying to help these people.
Same as you.

1012
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:35,365
Don't delude yourself. You're a mercenary...
not a humanitarian.

1013
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:38,117
I got 200 kids that are
gonna sleep safe tonight.

1014
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:41,955
Right or wrong, that's
all the reason I need.

1015
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:43,998
That's how it always starts.

1016
01:31:44,415 --> 01:31:47,252
With people thinking that they're
killing for the right reasons.

1017
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:50,755
Why don't you fight the evil
in this place your way,

1018
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:52,507
and let me fight it mine.

1019
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:56,386
They say you're doing good,
that you have special powers.

1020
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:59,889
You're protected by angels and
can't be killed by bullets.

1021
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,893
They said the same thing about
Kony in the beginning, too.

1022
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:58,489
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1023
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:13,963
Preacher.

1024
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,242
Let's get them out of here.

1025
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,163
Deng, tell them that we're
not going to hurt them.

1026
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:51,250
Okay, in the light.
That's good. That's good.

1027
01:33:54,837 --> 01:33:56,798
We don't have room
for all of them.

1028
01:33:57,090 --> 01:34:00,968
- How many can we fit in the truck?
- Twenty, 25 maximum.

1029
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,722
What have we got? Like 40?

1030
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:11,688
Okay. All right. You, you go.

1031
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,565
You. You go. You, go.

1032
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:16,025
What are you doing?

1033
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:20,279
You. You go. You. You.
We gotta take as many as we can.

1034
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:22,740
We gotta take the little ones,
and the ones that are sick,

1035
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,200
we'll come back for
the other ones later.

1036
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:27,453
Marco, Adeem.
Take these ones here on the truck.

1037
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:31,499
- We should call for backup.
- No, we got no time. We take the ones we can.

1038
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:37,755
You, you go. Yeah, you go. Go, go.
All right. You, stay, stay.

1039
01:34:39,298 --> 01:34:41,509
Okay, tell the other ones
we'll come back later.

1040
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,512
Tell them.

1041
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:58,860
Don't come back
until you see my face.

1042
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,445
Wait!

1043
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,782
- Hey, hey!
- Get in here.

1044
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:08,202
Tell them to hide.
Don't move till they see my face.

1045
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:12,957
Deng! Get in.
I don't have no more space.

1046
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,503
I'll be back in two hours.
Two hours.

1047
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:19,297
Two hours we'll be back.

1048
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,608
Marley, gas it up,
we're leaving in five.

1049
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:12,076
Sudan?
What are you doing over there?

1050
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:39,562
Hey, sorry, man. Sorry.

1051
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:42,648
Route 16 was all backed up.

1052
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:49,864
Welcome home, buddy. Yeah.

1053
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:55,119
You must be wiped out, man.
Yeah, I'm sorry, 16 was a fucking mess.

1054
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:57,038
All these assholes out
driving at night...

1055
01:37:57,246 --> 01:38:00,249
Shut up. Shut up.
Open your eyes, wake up.

1056
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:02,460
Wake up! Shut up!

1057
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:07,173
You call yourselves the children of God?
Well, you ain't.

1058
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:12,219
No, y'all just sheep following Him.
Deaf, dumb and blind.

1059
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:14,847
But God don't want sheep!

1060
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:17,224
Praise the Lord.

1061
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,936
He wants wolves to
fight his fight!

1062
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:21,938
<i>Amen! Amen!</i>

1063
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:27,944
Men and women with teeth to tear
at the evil that is out there!

1064
01:38:29,946 --> 01:38:34,241
The Lord's prophets are
not men in fancy clothes.

1065
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,536
They're warrior prophets!

1066
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:44,877
They're men of conviction, who ain't afraid
to pick up a sword and use it! Why not?

1067
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:50,841
Soldiers willing to fight against
His enemies, wherever they may be!

1068
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:57,139
<i>Soldiers willing to fight
till their last breath.</i>

1069
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:02,561
- Hallelujah! Wake up!
- Hallelujah!

1070
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:04,981
I want you to look at this.

1071
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:07,191
- It's a 10-year-old boy.
- Sam...

1072
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:11,737
- He had his arms cut off. Just hacked off.
- This is not necessary. It's not necessary.

1073
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:13,572
Could you come back
in a minute, please?

1074
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,826
- Please.
- Look, I only got one truck over there.

1075
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:22,248
I need the money to get another vehicle.
Now I found this one in Kampala that I can get.

1076
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:23,499
We already took out a
second on your home.

1077
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,001
I got a real good deal, I
just need you to get...

1078
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:27,753
Sam, we know what you're doing over
there in Africa, and we support it.

1079
01:39:27,837 --> 01:39:30,715
But I'm telling you, we cannot
give you any more money.

1080
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:34,635
- You hear what I'm saying? Look at this.
- Sam, you're completely leveraged.

1081
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,220
- See this?
- Yes.

1082
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:39,473
This girl watched her family being
killed and then they set her on fire.

1083
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:40,725
This is not necessary.

1084
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:43,310
No, no, no. John, just look at...
John. John, look at the picture.

1085
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:45,271
- I do see it. I'm looking, Sam.
- Look at the picture.

1086
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:48,816
Now, I ain't asking for money
for a hot tub or a vacation

1087
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:50,401
- or something like that.
- Company policy says...

1088
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:54,822
I'm asking for an extra vehicle so that
I can save some children, John, okay?

1089
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:57,116
- Do you understand that?
- I do, but I'm telling you...

1090
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,659
But nothing!

1091
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,247
But nothing! Now, I need you to
get in your little book there

1092
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,999
and do whatever it is you
gotta do to get me that car!

1093
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:07,251
- Sam, you need to calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

1094
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:10,129
Mary Strauss and them's
having dinner at the Chimney.

1095
01:40:10,212 --> 01:40:12,965
- Who's her date?
- Tony Wilkes.

1096
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:16,302
I thought Tony Wilkes was going
with Patty Hobbes' daughter?

1097
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:18,137
They broke up last month.

1098
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:21,766
Sudanese
opposition leader.

1099
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,977
<i>John Garang has been killed
in a helicopter crash.</i>

1100
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:28,939
<i>That's according to a statement released
by the Sudanese government in Khartoum.</i>

1101
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:31,609
<i>Garang was hailed as a
peacemaker in Sudan</i>

1102
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,320
<i>and was instrumental in
ending the 21-year civil war</i>

1103
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:35,738
<i>that has ravaged that country.</i>

1104
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:36,864
Dad.

1105
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:40,284
<i>Six of Garang's associates and seven
others also died in the crash</i>

1106
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,536
<i>which is being blamed
on bad weather.</i>

1107
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,498
What do you think about us
getting a limo for next weekend?

1108
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:48,084
Wouldn't be too expensive
since there'd be six of us.

1109
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,293
What do you think?

1110
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:55,716
Hello? Earth to Dad.

1111
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:57,593
Honey. You okay?

1112
01:40:58,636 --> 01:40:59,929
Oh, heck, I'll
just take you all.

1113
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:03,599
We ain't cramming in the
back of your Caprice.

1114
01:41:03,682 --> 01:41:05,226
Fit in there easy.
You're little.

1115
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:08,270
We got dresses, Donnie.
We'll get all wrinkled.

1116
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:10,397
Plus it smells in there.

1117
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:13,359
Yeah, I'll squirt some
perfume You'll be all right.

1118
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:17,571
Dad, what do you think?
Can we get a limo?

1119
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:23,410
Dad, please, Patty and
them's getting one.

1120
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:29,083
We could probably get a deal
through one of Tom Hickey's boys.

1121
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:31,502
Wouldn't cost too much
between six of them.

1122
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:34,171
You ain't spending money
on no freaking limousine.

1123
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,842
- But, Dad...
- What the hell did I just say?

1124
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:40,219
Honey, we're just
talking about it.

1125
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:43,139
Yeah, well there's too
much talk in this house.

1126
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:44,974
I got mouths to feed.

1127
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:47,768
You're talking about pissing
money away on a limo.

1128
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:51,939
But it's my formal, Dad.

1129
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:57,111
I don't give a shit what it is!
Okay? You ain't getting no limo.

1130
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:01,615
You love them black babies
more than you love me!

1131
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,827
- Watch your mouth, little girl! Before I slap it...
- Hey, hey, hey.

1132
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,288
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Take it easy, bro.

1133
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:10,291
Don't tell me to take it easy
in my own fucking house!

1134
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:12,459
All right?
Now that ain't your wife.

1135
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,128
And this ain't your family.

1136
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:17,882
You ain't nothing but a stray
fucking dog around here.

1137
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,551
You don't mean that.

1138
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:23,929
Like hell I don't.
Now get the fuck out of here.

1139
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,183
Before I put your face
through that fucking wall.

1140
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:02,593
You that preacher, ain't ya?

1141
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:04,511
Yeah, you him.

1142
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:07,473
I seen your face in the
papers a few years ago.

1143
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:14,021
- Yeah.
- Told you this is the guy.

1144
01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:19,151
God damn, I knew it.

1145
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:25,157
The papers were talking about you as some
kind of African Rambo or something, right?

1146
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:28,410
If you don't mind, I'd just
like to sit here right now.

1147
01:43:28,494 --> 01:43:31,372
You still helping them
niggers over there'?

1148
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:35,626
See, the way I figure it,

1149
01:43:36,543 --> 01:43:40,506
the reason you're so interested
in helping them porch monkeys

1150
01:43:40,589 --> 01:43:43,717
is probably 'cause you throwing it
in them nigger bitches, ain't ya?

1151
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:15,165
You're gonna sit there and
you're gonna let me talk.

1152
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:20,045
I've always believed in you.

1153
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:23,465
Trusted you, trusted the Lord.

1154
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:27,219
And do what I could so you
could follow your dream.

1155
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:31,598
But I ain't willing to lose you
to what you're doing over there.

1156
01:44:35,477 --> 01:44:39,189
Ain't just gonna sit back and
watch you get swallowed up by it.

1157
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:45,738
Now I know that you're all them kids got
over there, but you're all we got, too.

1158
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:48,949
Paige needs her father.

1159
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:52,786
Damn it, Sam, I need my husband.

1160
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:10,804
Shit, man,
where the hell are you?

1161
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:19,980
<i>This is Sam.
Leave a message.</i>

1162
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:23,192
<i>It's Donnie, man.</i>

1163
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:27,654
Shit, I was hoping
you'd be there.

1164
01:45:31,533 --> 01:45:33,702
I wanna talk to you.

1165
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:40,959
It's no big deal.

1166
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:46,131
I was just thinking about...
when we were kids.

1167
01:45:48,217 --> 01:45:52,763
And in the summertime we'd go over
to that quarry near Montrose.

1168
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:55,557
Remember that?

1169
01:45:56,975 --> 01:46:00,771
Yeah, we'd bring our ropes.

1170
01:46:03,524 --> 01:46:05,234
<i>Or go swimming.</i>

1171
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:10,864
<i>Climb around on the
walls all day.</i>

1172
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:22,042
I wish you was here
to pray with me.

1173
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:42,438
A lot of youse want me to stand up
here and make some sense out of this.

1174
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:49,445
Tell you there's some meaning.

1175
01:46:51,989 --> 01:46:56,368
You know, maybe there's a purpose
for what happened to Donnie.

1176
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:00,998
That's why you came here today.

1177
01:47:01,874 --> 01:47:07,045
You want me to tell you that God
has His plan for all of us and...

1178
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:09,423
when it's time to
call us on home...

1179
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:11,216
He's just gonna do it.

1180
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:17,097
That's what you want me to say.

1181
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:21,852
But that's not what
I'm gonna tell you.

1182
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:32,404
Mom, who are those men?

1183
01:47:35,073 --> 01:47:36,575
I don't know.

1184
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:39,411
- Hey, does this go?
- No, I don't think that goes.

1185
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:42,122
- Excuse me. What are you doing?
- Loading up.

1186
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:45,751
Sam! What is going on?
What is...

1187
01:47:45,834 --> 01:47:48,003
- This is the last of the tools.
- Where they taking our stuff?

1188
01:47:48,086 --> 01:47:49,338
Ain't ours no more.

1189
01:47:49,379 --> 01:47:52,174
You best go through it and make sure they
ain't taking anything that belongs...

1190
01:47:52,257 --> 01:47:53,926
Hey, don't you touch that.

1191
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:58,138
Baby, I know you're hurting.

1192
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:00,641
I know you're angry, but we
need to talk about this.

1193
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:03,310
It's all done.
So save your breath.

1194
01:48:07,272 --> 01:48:08,815
You sold the business?

1195
01:48:11,568 --> 01:48:12,653
You sold the business?

1196
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:15,572
- I need a new truck for the orphanage.
- A new truck?

1197
01:48:15,656 --> 01:48:20,994
You sold the business for a new truck?
That was our future, Paige's future, Sam.

1198
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,664
Everything that we have has
gone to those children.

1199
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:27,167
There's a point, baby, where
there ain't no more to give.

1200
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:29,878
What's the combination?

1201
01:48:31,964 --> 01:48:33,507
What's the combination?

1202
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:36,093
Paige's birthday.

1203
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:41,807
You don't know it, do you?

1204
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:44,476
You don't remember your
own daughter's birthday.

1205
01:48:46,979 --> 01:48:49,356
You fight for everyone, but us.

1206
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,692
That's all we got.

1207
01:48:58,156 --> 01:49:00,742
You can make it up
with the ministry.

1208
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:03,829
What ministry, Sam?

1209
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:06,540
They see how far gone you are,
they see what you've become.

1210
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:12,838
- You need to get quiet with the Lord.
- No, you know what? I'm done with the Lord.

1211
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:15,841
No, don't you say that.
Don't you turn your back on Him.

1212
01:49:15,924 --> 01:49:18,010
He turned His back on me.

1213
01:49:19,344 --> 01:49:22,931
Where is He, Lynn?
Where is the Lord now?

1214
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,393
'Cause I don't see Him around here.
Did He save Donnie?

1215
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:30,063
Did He save those kids?
I gotta save those kids.

1216
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,860
Please don't leave.

1217
01:49:48,081 --> 01:49:49,416
Welcome back.

1218
01:50:52,187 --> 01:50:53,939
Don't reverse. Don't reverse.

1219
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:55,649
- They are going to kill us.
- No, they won't.

1220
01:50:59,569 --> 01:51:01,696
If you move, they're
gonna shoot.

1221
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:03,907
Calm down, I'm going
to go talk to them.

1222
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:10,414
It's okay, we're a relief convoy.
Relief convoy.

1223
01:51:11,289 --> 01:51:13,750
We've only got medical
supplies, we're non-military.

1224
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:12,809
The men no longer trust you
to lead them into battle.

1225
01:52:14,311 --> 01:52:16,396
They say you have a wish to die.

1226
01:52:18,356 --> 01:52:20,025
I'm worried about my friend.

1227
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:31,578
I don't need your help.

1228
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:11,535
Yeah?

1229
01:54:02,711 --> 01:54:05,297
I remember my parents
when I sleep.

1230
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:11,261
My father was big like you.

1231
01:54:14,764 --> 01:54:16,308
They shot him.

1232
01:54:21,605 --> 01:54:23,940
The rebels gave me a club.

1233
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,192
And told me...

1234
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:32,073
if I did not kill my mother,

1235
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:37,871
they'll shoot my brother and me.

1236
01:54:46,504 --> 01:54:48,632
And so I killed my mother.

1237
01:54:58,350 --> 01:55:00,935
If we allow ourselves
to be full of hate...

1238
01:55:03,772 --> 01:55:05,106
then they've won.

1239
01:55:07,942 --> 01:55:10,111
We must not let them
take our hearts.

1240
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:09,272
Baby, can you get that?

1241
01:57:15,945 --> 01:57:19,407
- Hello?
- Bug? You there?

1242
01:57:21,701 --> 01:57:22,994
Dad?

1243
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:25,079
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

1244
01:57:26,414 --> 01:57:27,916
Are you okay?

1245
01:57:30,877 --> 01:57:32,462
I'm thinking of a tree.

1246
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,803
You said tree, I'm
thinking of a knee.

1247
01:57:39,886 --> 01:57:40,929
<i>You said knee.</i> ..

1248
01:57:42,514 --> 01:57:44,432
I'm thinking of a bee.

1249
01:57:47,852 --> 01:57:48,978
I love you, bug.

1250
01:57:51,898 --> 01:57:53,733
I love you too, Dad.

1259
01:58:24,472 --> 01:58:27,851
- What's going on?
- An IRA unit has been spotted.

1260
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:30,311
They are moving north
across the border.

1261
01:58:33,857 --> 01:58:37,110
What are we waiting for then?
Gotta go.

1262
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:54,043
The village outside of Akot says an
IRA caravan came through an hour ago.

1263
02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:09,911
Come on.

1264
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:15,416
Come on.

1265
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:58,376
- Come on. Come on.
- Push in, everybody.

1266
02:00:58,459 --> 02:01:00,003
There you go.

1267
02:01:00,086 --> 02:01:03,172
Sam. We cannot make them work.

1268
02:01:04,716 --> 02:01:07,010
This is the only one we have.

1269
02:01:15,935 --> 02:01:17,770
Okay, watch your hand.

1270
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,985
Keep your eyes peeled.
That road back there might still be hot.

1271
02:01:24,652 --> 02:01:26,154
So, be ready.

1272
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:28,114
What about you, Preacher?

1273
02:01:29,490 --> 02:01:30,783
We're staying.

1274
02:01:34,412 --> 02:01:35,747
Go on, get out of here.

1275
02:06:39,467 --> 02:06:43,012
For me to sit here and give all
kinds of excuses to make it right,

1276
02:06:43,095 --> 02:06:44,180
I can't do.

1277
02:06:44,263 --> 02:06:47,183
But what I wanna ask
everyone out there,

1278
02:06:47,558 --> 02:06:52,021
everyone that has a child, everyone
that has a brother or a sister,

1279
02:06:52,605 --> 02:06:56,984
if your child or your family
member was abducted today,

1280
02:06:57,068 --> 02:07:00,905
if a madman came in,
a terrorist came in,

1281
02:07:00,988 --> 02:07:04,658
abducted your family
member, or your child,

1282
02:07:04,742 --> 02:07:08,120
and if I said to you, "I can
bring your child home,"

1283
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:11,665
does it matter howl
bring him home?
