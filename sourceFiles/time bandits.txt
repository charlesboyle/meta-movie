1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,080
Yes, folks, Moderna Designs...

2
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,250
present the latest
in kitchen luxury.

3
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,410
The Moderna Wonder Major All-Automatic
Convenience Center-ette...

4
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,790
gives you all the time in the world
to do the things you really want to do.

5
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,790
An infrared
freezer/oven complex...

6
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,910
that can make you a meal
from packet to plate...

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,290
in 15 and a half seconds.

8
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:03,290
The Morrisons have got one that
can do that in eight seconds.

9
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,620
Block of ice to beef bourguignon
in eight seconds.

10
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,250
Lucky things.

11
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,790
Dad, did you know that
the ancient Greek warriors...

12
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,910
had to learn 44 different
ways of unarmed combat?

13
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,410
Well, at least we've got
a two-speed hedge cutter.

14
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,620
They were trying to kill people 26
different ways with their bare hands.

15
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,960
Bedtime for you, Kevin. It's 9:00.

16
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,210
And this King Agamemnon,
he once fought-

17
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,410
Go on, dear.
Your father said.

18
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,540
- Oh, all right.
- The man you all love, Kenny Lange.

19
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,540
Well, that's today's top prize.

20
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,460
Let's meet today's star guest
on Your Money Or Your Life.

21
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,080
Bring them on, girls.
Oh, don't they look gorgeous?

22
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,540
Oh, they get lovelier
every day.

23
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,460
Turn that light off!

24
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,460
It is off.

25
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,130
What the hell
is going on up here?

26
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,250
I told you to put that light out
and get to bed.

27
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,420
- But-
- And no more noise!

28
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,460
It came off just like that.
The whole thermostat.

29
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,590
That's the toaster, the spreader
and the slicer all gone.

30
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,170
- She's in a terrible state.
- Should've bought German.

31
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,050
- Mom?
- It would've matched her rotissomat.

32
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,960
- Mom, Dad, can I- - You're
going to bed in good time tonight.

33
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,260
- I was thinking of going to bed now.
- Now? Certainly not.

34
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,920
- You must wait for your food to go down.
- I haven't eaten any food.

35
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,050
Well, you must eat
your food.

36
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,260
And then wait for it
to go down.

37
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,630
Oh, no!
Not the carvery again.

38
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,420
Oh, dear me, Beryl.
Now, all I want to know...

39
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,550
is what famous film star
begins with "C"?

40
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,760
Do you understand
the question, my darling?

41
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,920
Come on, Beryl. Come on. Jumbo's
gonna end up in the souffle, Beryl.

42
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,920
You've got to answer it, Beryl.
Come on. Come on, Beryl.

43
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,420
- It's gone down now.
- Come on, Beryl. Come on.

44
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,170
- What?
- My supper. It's gone down.

45
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
I can feel it.
Can I go to bed now?

46
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,800
Yeah, all right.
Off you go. But no noise.

47
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,130
- What?
- No noise!

48
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,130
All right. Okay.

49
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,010
No, Beryl. Capetown is not a film star.

50
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,630
Oh, dear. Oh, well.
That's Your Money Or Your Life.

51
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,970
Well, it takes money.

52
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,470
With a kitchen like that?

53
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,010
Our kitchen's all right, isn't it?

54
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,390
Our kitchen is light-years behind.

55
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,810
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

56
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,430
- Well, look at the map.
- It's not on the map.

57
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,260
- Is he coming after us?
- I think we gave him the slip.

58
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,970
It's him!
Run for it!

59
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,770
- Which way?
- This way. Careful.

60
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,770
We can explain everything, sir.

61
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,270
It's not as bad as it looks.

62
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,770
We just borrowed the map.

63
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,220
Sort of got rather happy
about it, and, uh...

64
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,640
ran off in high spirits.

65
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,640
Yeah, we did.

66
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,270
Who are you?

67
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,480
That's not him.

68
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,810
It didn't sound
like him, did it?

69
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,600
It doesn't even
look like him.

70
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,430
- It isn't him.
- Let's get him!

71
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,980
Strutter, get his torch.
Shine it right in the face.

72
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,980
His face, dummy!

73
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,310
It's a kid!

74
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,850
Og, Fidgit,
check the door.

75
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,690
All clear.

76
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,140
Strutter, the light.

77
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,850
Just tell us how we get out of here,
keep quiet and you won't get hurt.

78
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,600
Wh-Why don't you get out
the way you came?

79
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,270
Don't try and be smart
with me, you little creep.

80
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,810
Yeah.

81
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,480
If you want to play it smart,
I'll introduce you to Vermin.

82
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,020
He eats anything,
you know.

83
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,140
I'm not trying to be smart.
I'm just trying to help.

84
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,140
- You know, don't you?
- I don't know anything.

85
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,270
You know, and you're
not going to tell us.

86
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,810
- I'm getting angry, and Vermin's getting hungry.
- I don't know!

87
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,600
- He's found it!
- What?

88
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,600
- The way out.
- It's never done that before.

89
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,270
Come on, you lot, push!

90
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,150
Oh, no!
Not like that!

91
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,980
Wait for me to give
the order, all right?

92
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,770
Ready? One-

93
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,810
Stop! Stop!
You never start on one.

94
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,150
Who ever heard of anybody
starting anything on one?

95
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,520
- What is it then, two or three?
- Three.

96
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,400
And push!

97
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,150
- It's him!
- He's found us!

98
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,480
Help us! Please!
Help us!

99
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,690
- Come on!
- Who is that?

100
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,150
Return what you
have stolen from me!

101
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,440
Return!
Return the map!

102
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,900
It will bring you
great danger!

103
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,320
Stop! Now!

104
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,690
- Where are we?
- I'm stuck!

105
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,190
Quick! The barn!

106
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,150
Get under here.
Hold him, Strutter.

107
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,570
Shut up!

108
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,320
All clear. Wally?

109
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
Yeah.

110
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,440
- Strutter?
- Yeah.

111
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,900
- Move it. Go.
- Okay.

112
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,070
- Fidgit?
- Yeah.

113
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,490
Where are we?
What happened to my bedroom?

114
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,490
Who was that man?

115
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,610
That was no man.
That was the Supreme Being.

116
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,280
You mean God?

117
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,820
We don't know him that well.
We only work for Him.

118
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,150
Shut up!
Now, are we all here?

119
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,990
- What?
- Og, are you here?

120
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,150
- Yeah, he's here.
- Vermin?

121
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,940
Vermin, will you stop eating!

122
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,740
It's too dangerous to stay here.
He's probably still after us.

123
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,400
So we better keep moving.
Hey, where are you going?

124
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,240
- Hey, where are you going?
- Get him! He'll give us away.

125
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,900
Help! Help!

126
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,990
Farmers!

127
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,660
Look what you've done, boy.

128
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,160
Sorry.
What town is that?

129
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,160
Castiglione, or what
Napoleon's left of it.

130
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,820
- Napoleon?
- Yes. It's his city now.

131
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,320
Come on, boy.
You come with us.

132
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,820
No, thanks.

133
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,320
Come with us
if you know what's good for you.

134
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,410
You're going the wrong way.

135
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,530
Napoleon?

136
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,160
- Get down!
- You nearly got us caught!

137
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,070
You silly fool.
You could've ruined everything.

138
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,490
- Do you know where we are?
- Shut up. Of course I do.

139
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,620
1796.
Battle of Castiglione.

140
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,160
See?

141
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,830
Are you sure we're not
in somebody's bedroom?

142
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,830
Look, do you want to be
leader of this gang?

143
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,080
- We agreed no leader.
- Right. So shut up and do as I say.

144
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,990
Now, we've got to get
into the city.

145
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,740
We can't.
The roads are too dangerous.

146
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,160
I've got an idea.
We can use the river.

147
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,910
Come on!

148
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,620
Aaaah!

149
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,120
What are we
going to do here?

150
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,990
- A robbery.
- Shhh.

151
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,330
- A robbery?
- Of course.

152
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,330
We're international
criminals. We do robberies.

153
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,330
Shut up back there.

154
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,200
Aim! Fire!

155
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,330
Take aim! Fire!

156
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,620
That's him.

157
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,460
You're not gonna rob him?

158
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah. Every single
penny he's got.

159
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,580
- But that's Napoleon.
- And he's rich.

160
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,080
Monsieur Commander...

161
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,790
I think that the mayor of
Castiglione and his council...

162
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,460
would like very much
to surrender now, please.

163
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,000
Look at that!
Look at the little fellow!

164
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,960
With the city, we have the whole area
of western Lombardy at our feet.

165
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,170
Oh, go away!

166
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,790
I never should've
married you!

167
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,420
Oh, stop it!

168
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,710
Yes! Yes!

169
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,170
Mon Commander,
they are very keen to surrender.

170
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,290
They have been here
eight hours.

171
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,630
Don't stand so close
to me, Neguy!

172
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,790
I've told you
about that before.

173
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,250
You on one side
and him on the other-

174
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,290
It's like being on the bottom
of a bloody well!

175
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,540
Just because
you think I'm small.

176
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,290
No, Commander, you are
not small at all.

177
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,750
No, not by any means.
Five-foot-one is not small.

178
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,290
Yeah, five-foot-one
and conqueror of Italy.

179
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,130
- Not bad, huh?
- Very, very good.

180
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,250
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- What just happened?

181
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,960
Where'd they- I just-

182
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,670
Bravo!

183
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,460
More! I want more!

184
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,300
- I- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Encore!

185
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,960
I wonder if you would like
to see some of our other items.

186
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,170
We have Zuzu and Benny.

187
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,500
Fun on a unicycle.

188
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,210
No?

189
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,460
How about
the Great Rumbozo?

190
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,130
He sing
and lift heavy things.

191
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,090
No. How about, uh-

192
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,920
Come on.

193
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,630
This I think you'll like.

194
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,710
It's very funny.

195
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,010
The Three Idiots...

196
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,380
uh, from Latvia.

197
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,050
It's a very funny act.
They swallow brushes.

198
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,800
No, no!
They're all freaks!

199
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,170
Not one of them
under five-foot-six.

200
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,170
What kind of theater
are you running, huh?

201
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,170
I'm sorry, sir, but-

202
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,720
No, no.
More of the funny show,

203
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,260
the little puppets
hitting each other.

204
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,470
That's what I like!
Little things hitting each other!

205
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,800
Come on.

206
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,050
Psst.

207
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,130
- Huh?
- Play something like this.

208
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,510
Tsk. Hmm.

209
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,680
# Like the wallpaper
sticks to the wall #

210
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,970
# Like the seashore
sticks to the sea #

211
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,800
# Like you never
get rid of your shadow #

212
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,300
# Boy, you didn't
get rid of me #

213
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,300
# Me #

214
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,180
# And my shadow #

215
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,680
# Strolling down the avenue #

216
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,800
# Avenue, avenue, avenue #

217
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,090
# Me #

218
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,140
# And my shadow #

219
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,140
- # Not a soul to tell our troubles to #
- Please let go!

220
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,180
# We stick together like glue #

221
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,090
# And when it's 12:00 #

222
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,640
# We climb the stair #

223
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,180
# We never, never knock #

224
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,930
# 'Cause nobody's there- #

225
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,510
# Me and my shadow #

226
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,930
# Feeling blue ##

227
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,140
Well, what do you think?

228
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,220
Marvelous show.

229
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:57,680
Young man, you stick with these boys,
you have a great future.

230
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,680
You know, you are
the best thing...

231
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,970
to happen to me
since this whole campaign.

232
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,140
You know, I come
to conquer Italy...

233
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,680
because I thought they
were all small, you know?

234
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,810
I heard they was
really tiny guys.

235
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,470
Sir, I really think there
are more important things-

236
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Shut up!

237
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,890
Don't you dare to tell me
my business.

238
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,640
You are dismissed, you hear?
You, Lucien, the rest of you.

239
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,680
Great streaks of misery.

240
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,810
- But sir-
- No!

241
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm going to have
some new generals for a bit.

242
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,850
Alexander the Great...

243
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,480
five feet exactly.

244
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,520
Isn't that incredible?

245
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,480
Alexander the Great, whose empire
stretched from India to Hungary-

246
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,600
One inch shorter than me.

247
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
Oliver Cromwell...

248
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,560
the only man with any guts
in British history-

249
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,690
Not a big man at all.

250
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,730
Louis IV, 5' 21/2".

251
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,270
Charlemagne...

252
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,190
a dumpy little five-footer.

253
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,980
Squatty little chap.

254
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,690
Attila the Hun, 5' 11/2".

255
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,520
Cyrano de Bergerac,
5' 31/2".

256
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,940
Tamburlaine the Great,
four-foot-nine...

257
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,860
and three quarters.

258
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,690
Wasn't he interesting?

259
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,860
Strutter, wake up.
Wake up.

260
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,980
According to this map, there's a time
hole outside. See if you can find it.

261
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,320
- Right.
- The rest of you, the hole disappears at 12:00, right?

262
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,440
So let's get moving.

263
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,110
Vermin, Fidgit,
the tapestry.

264
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,820
Hey, that's 16th century!
It's nice, isn't it?

265
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,860
Get it!

266
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,110
Okay.

267
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,270
We're rich!
We're rich!

268
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,020
Ten-hut!

269
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,690
- Come on. We've got 30 seconds left.
- You found the time hole?

270
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,900
- Yes.
- Let's go.

271
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,030
Come on, Kevin.

272
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,030
Ten-hut!

273
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,030
About turn!

274
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,490
- Stop!
- Go!

275
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,990
Thieves!
After them!

276
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,950
Follow them!

277
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,530
Oh, Sir Vincent,
you came for me!

278
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,660
Oh, Good Mistress Pansy,
I could not have ridden faster.

279
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,490
Four horses have I exhausted
this day from Nottingham.

280
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,160
Oh, the way you leapt to my chamber,
so full of... manliness.

281
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,990
I could scarce restrain
the rushing of my feet.

282
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,870
These 12 long years have been
like chains that bound me.

283
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,490
Oh. And the personal
problem?

284
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,320
- Much, much better.
- Ohhh.

285
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,780
And now we will ride full tilt to Dover,
and there embark for France.

286
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,370
Oh, you don't have
to wear the special-

287
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,490
No, no, I don't have to wear
the special- anymore.

288
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,740
Oh, Pansy.
No more worries now, Pansy.

289
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,870
- Oh.
- Oh.

290
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,490
No. No.

291
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,030
Hey!

292
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,660
- Quick! Quick!
- We did it!

293
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,080
- Your problem, Vincent.
- Forget the problem. Get me the money.

294
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,990
We did it! We did it!

295
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,830
I told you. You stick with me,
and you won't go far wrong.

296
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,990
Sometimes I almost
believe you, Randall.

297
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,830
- Hey, where are we?
- Where are we?

298
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,870
Why, it's obvious.
We're, um-

299
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,870
Vincent, don't
worry about a thing.

300
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,040
I'm not worrying.

301
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,040
- Exactly-
- In the Middle Ages.

302
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,410
Hmm... in
the Middle Ages.

303
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,870
Five-hundred years before the man
we just robbed was even born.

304
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,870
- Fantastic!
- Try that one in a court of law.

305
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,120
Vermin, that is not
meant to be eaten.

306
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,580
You never know
until you've eaten it.

307
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,040
Is it always like this
when you've done a raid?

308
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,540
I don't know.
We've never done one before.

309
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,000
But I thought you were
international criminals.

310
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,160
Going to be.
Going to be.

311
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,830
Yeah, going to be.
Aren't we? Going to be?

312
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,290
Especially now
that we've got you, Kevin.

313
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,120
Hang on. He's just a kid.
He's not one of us.

314
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,120
He knows an awful lot.

315
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,290
Yeah, and he's bigger
than any of us.

316
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,830
- Do you really want to join us?
- Can we really go anywhere?

317
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,210
You name it.
If it's down here.

318
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,120
I don't understand.
What's so special about that map?

319
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,000
This map used to belong
to the Supreme Being.

320
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,500
- You stole it?
- No. Well, sort of.

321
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,620
He used to be our employer.
He made all the big stuff,

322
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,250
like good and evil,
men and women, night and day.

323
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,420
And when He did trees and shrubs,
we helped make all this.

324
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,420
Whew, that's not bad.

325
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,170
Yeah, and did we get a thimble
full of credit for it?

326
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,830
No, all we got was the sack,
just for creating the Pink Bunkadoo.

327
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,960
- Pink Bunkadoo?
- Yeah. Beautiful tree that was.

328
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,960
Og designed it, didn't you? Yeah.

329
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,370
Six-hundred feet high,
bright red and smelled terrible.

330
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,370
As a disciplinary measure, we were
sent down to the repairs department.

331
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,330
What?

332
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,000
You see, to be quite frank, the fabric
of the universe is far from perfect.

333
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,000
It was a bit of a botched job.
We only had seven days to make it.

334
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,170
And that's where this comes in.
This is the only map of all the holes.

335
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,170
Well, why repair them?
Why not use them to get stinkin' rich?

336
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,540
Yeah, stinkin' rich!

337
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,380
Lads, here's to stinkin' rich!

338
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,170
Stinkin' rich.
Stinkin' rich.

339
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,210
- And to Kevin!
- Yeah, Kevin!

340
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,130
- Here's to Kevin!
- Stinkin' Kevin!

341
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,170
Hey, hold it there.

342
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,170
Smile.

343
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,420
- Hey, the map.
- Yeah, the map. Don't forget the map.

344
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,880
Hey, come on! Smile!

345
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,670
Help! Robbers!

346
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,710
- Hey, that's us!
- Someone's in trouble. Come on!

347
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,960
Grab the loot.

348
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,210
It's a bit tight.

349
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,960
- Now, those are our sort of people.
- Yeah!

350
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,000
Vincent! Oh!
Oh, dear!

351
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,340
- Help!
- Come on.

352
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,840
Oh, Vincent,
someone's coming.

353
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,250
Help! Help I say!

354
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,210
Oh, at last.
Oh, I say!

355
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,170
I say, my fiance and I would appreciate
a bit of assistance.

356
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,340
- Oh, no! The problem, Pansy!
- Oh! Oh!

357
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,170
- It's started again! Oh! Oh!
- Oh, don't worry, darling.

358
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,170
- I say!
- I must have fruit!

359
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,880
- Where are we?
- We've lost them.

360
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,510
Come on.
Don't be so wet.

361
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,380
Hey!

362
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,090
What do we do now,
Randall?

363
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,840
Just leave this to me, Wally.
We've just got to treat them right.

364
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,970
What do you want,
you tatty-faced old scumbag?

365
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,880
- What's your business, gob face?
- We're robbers!

366
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,880
- Villainous robbers?
- The worst.

367
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,920
- Stop at nothing?
- Nothing at all.

368
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,670
- Steal a cup outta a beggar's hands?
- Rather.

369
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,880
- The teeth from blind old ladies?
- Of course.

370
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,220
- Toys from children?
- Whenever we can.

371
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,380
Right.
Let 'em down!

372
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,010
They always crack
in the end.

373
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,630
Wow.

374
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,590
Listen, I've got a few ideas
for, uh, a linkup...

375
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,720
between your gang
and our gang,

376
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,050
but I only want
to talk to the boss.

377
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,050
The boss?

378
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,680
- The boss?
- That's right.

379
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,090
They serious?

380
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,090
Ohhh.

381
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,050
All right! Do it!

382
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,340
Anyone else wanna go?

383
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,890
Come on, you weasels.

384
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,510
What's this?

385
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,140
Lose yourself, leprechaun.

386
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,840
Move yourself, lad.

387
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,470
- That's disgusting!
- Wait here! I'll get him!

388
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,010
Hello. I-I'm Hood.

389
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,050
- It's Robin Hood.
- Yeah.

390
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,350
Say good morning, you scum.

391
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,720
Good morning, scum.

392
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,850
- Good morning. You're all robbers, then?
- The best, Mr. Hood.

393
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,510
Jolly good.
And you're a robber, are you?

394
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,890
Jolly good.

395
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,220
And do you enjoy
robbing, then?

396
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,810
Well, it helps
pay the rent, sir.

397
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,850
Jolly good.

398
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,970
And you're a robber too?
How long have you been a robber?

399
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,640
- Four-foot-one.
- Good Lord!

400
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,770
- Jolly good. Four-foot-one?
- Yes.

401
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,680
Well, th-th-th-that is
a long time, isn't it?

402
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Well now, I hear you've made
a pretty good haul.

403
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,720
Well, see for yourself, sir.

404
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,600
Gosh! I say!

405
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,970
Crikey! I mean,
I've been in robbing for years,

406
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,520
but I've never seen
anything like this.

407
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,720
Crumbs! And you acquired
all of this by yourselves?

408
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,850
Well, it was a good day,
Mr. Hood.

409
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,350
- Jolly good day!
- It's nice, isn't it?

410
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,140
Rather! Well, I mean,
what can I say? Thank you.

411
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,350
Thank you all
very, very much indeed.

412
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,770
Oh, don't ment- What?

413
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,180
Well, I mean,
it's frightfully kind of you.

414
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,180
The poor are going to be
absolutely thrilled.

415
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,560
- Have you met them?
- Who? The poor?

416
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,560
Oh, you must meet them.
I just know you'll like them.

417
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,270
Of course, they haven't
got two pennies to rub together.

418
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:43,560
But that's because they're poor.

419
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,520
Uh, Marion, would you be so kind
as to ask the poor to come in, please?

420
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,850
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.

421
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,020
- Right. Come on, you lot.
- Let's just see what we've got.

422
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,190
This is going to be
so much help in our work.

423
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,730
No, you don't understand.
All this stuff is ours. We stole it.

424
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,980
Oh, yes, I know, and believe you me the
poor are going to be not just thrilled,

425
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,980
but also considerably less poor,
aren't they, Redgrave?

426
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,060
You see? What did he say?

427
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,020
- He said, "Yeah, what with Christmas coming up and all. "
- Ah, jolly good.

428
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:25,150
Yes, well, there we are.
Congratulations. Well done.

429
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,850
There we are. Well done.
Congratulations.

430
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,020
Is that- Is that
absolutely necessary?

431
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,440
What did he say?

432
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,900
- He says, yeah, he's afraid it is.
- Ah, fine. Fine.

433
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,150
There we are, madam.
Congratulations.

434
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,230
- Congratulations. Jolly good.
- Thank you.

435
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,850
Incidentally, would any of you like
to stay on and help us with our work?

436
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,190
There's still so much wealth
to redistribute.

437
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,940
Oh, I'd like to stay.

438
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,730
Jolly good.
What's your name?

439
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,810
- Uh, Ke-
- Ke- What a jolly nice name.

440
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,400
- Let me go.
- Well, never mind.

441
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,150
Cheerio. Thank you very much.

442
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,110
Thank you very much.

443
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,360
Thank you very, very,
very, very much.

444
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,190
Awful people.

445
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,270
- This can't wait!
- I'll never get a chance to meet Robin Hood again.

446
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,020
- Any chance of a rescue?
- Stop moaning!

447
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,070
He's obviously a dangerous man.
Unbalanced, if you ask me.

448
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,690
Giving away
what isn't even his!

449
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,360
That's what Robin Hood
always did. Even I know that.

450
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,020
- Oh, of course. You know it all.
- He was one of my heroes.

451
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,860
Heroes! Heroes!
What do they know about a day's work?

452
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,900
- Leave him alone, Randall!
- Well, it makes me sick.

453
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,480
Anyone who's always right
makes me sick.

454
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,730
- That's why you get on with yourself!
- Watch it!

455
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,230
- Big mouth!
- Horseflesh wouldn't have got us into this.

456
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,730
- Horseflesh is dead.
- Then give me the map. I'm taking over!

457
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,860
Get off me! Get-

458
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,400
So... these are
the sort of people...

459
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,190
the Supreme Being
allows to steal His map?

460
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,110
Look at them.
Stunted little proles.

461
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,150
I wouldn't entrust them
to wipe their own noses.

462
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:38,360
Oh, no, sir. It's much
too difficult for them.

463
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,570
What sort of supreme being
created such riffraff?

464
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,070
Is it not the workings
of a complete incompetent?

465
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,320
But He created you,
Evil One.

466
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,570
What did you say?

467
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,610
Well, He created you,
so He can't be totally-

468
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,150
Never talk to me
like that again!

469
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,820
No one created me!
I am Evil!

470
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,320
Evil existed
long before good.

471
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,530
I made myself.
I cannot be unmade.

472
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,030
I am all-powerful!

473
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,400
Yeah.

474
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:32,530
But why,
if that's the case,

475
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,030
are you unable to escape
from this fortress?

476
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,820
That's a good question.

477
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,820
Why have I let the Supreme Being
keep me here...

478
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,820
in the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness?

479
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,860
- Because you- - Oh, shut
up. I'm speaking rhetorically.

480
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,450
- Of course.
- I let Him keep me here...

481
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,160
in order to lull Him
into a false sense of security.

482
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,780
Ah, clever, clever.

483
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,490
When I have the map,
I will be free...

484
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,990
and the world will be different
because I have understanding.

485
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,120
- Uh, understanding of what, master?
- Of digital watches.

486
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,240
Soon I shall have understanding of video
cassette recorders and car telephones.

487
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,740
And when I have understanding of them,
I shall have understanding of computers.

488
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,410
And when I have understanding of
computers, I shall be the Supreme Being.

489
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,240
God isn't interested
in technology.

490
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,700
He knows nothing of the potential of the
micro-chip or the silicon revolution.

491
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,320
Look how He spends His time.
Forty-three species of parrots!

492
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,240
- Nipples for men!
- Slugs.

493
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,820
Slugs! He created slugs.

494
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,660
They can't hear. They can't speak.
They can't operate machinery.

495
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,870
Are we not in the hands
of a lunatic?

496
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,200
Sir... look!

497
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,370
If I were creating a world, I wouldn't
mess about with butterflies and daffodils.

498
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,030
I would have started
with lasers, 8:00 day one.

499
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,490
Sorry.

500
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,700
I just can't wait for a new tech-
techno- technological dawn.

501
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,370
Sir... look!

502
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,910
What is it, Benson?

503
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,870
The map, sir. The map!
They've brought it with them!

504
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,870
- What?
- I saw the map, master, just now.

505
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,700
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, master.

506
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:31,580
Down there!
The little one has it.

507
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,580
The little one?

508
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,200
This is our chance.
This is what we've been waiting for!

509
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,540
- It will set us free.
- Shut up!

510
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,370
If you're wrong, Benson,
my revenge will be slow and unpleasant.

511
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:50,870
I will turn you inside out
over a very long period of time.

512
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,410
Oh, thank you, master.
Thank you.

513
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,620
Now we must bait the hook,
see if they bite...

514
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,120
and pull them in.

515
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:07,200
Stand by for mind control.

516
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,410
What about Babylon?

517
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,700
- Who?
- It's a city of legendary wealth.

518
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,500
Ahh.

519
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,500
I've got a better idea.

520
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,200
Who said that?

521
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:24,290
I've got an idea
forming in my head.

522
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,210
You haven't had an idea
for thousands of years.

523
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,910
There is a place where we could find
the greatest thing man could want,

524
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,830
the goal of everybody's
hopes and dreams.

525
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,370
What the hell
are you talking about?

526
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,910
The most fabulous
object in the world.

527
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,710
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.

528
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,540
They're hooked,
the greedy little fish.

529
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,660
- Why do you always have to go after money?
- Who's this?

530
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,830
I don't know, master.
I haven't seen him before.

531
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,370
He's stronger than the rest.
Who is he?

532
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,210
- I don't know.
- I'm losing them.

533
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,500
Something's going on down there.
We've lost them!

534
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,580
Randall, look, over there!

535
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,500
- We'd better move!
- Don't rush me.

536
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,500
The forest!
It's on fire!

537
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,500
It's raining,
pudding head!

538
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,080
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

539
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,870
- It's Him!
- It's Him!

540
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,710
Return the map.

541
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,040
- Make for the hole!
- Where is it?

542
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,500
It's over there.
Quick! Come on!

543
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,580
- Stop! Return!
- Hurry up!

544
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:36,080
Return what you
have stolen from me.

545
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,670
Return the map!

546
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,210
There are two holes, Randall.
Which one? Which one?

547
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,880
Go, Kevin!
Just get away!

548
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,670
Go! Not that one!

549
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,920
Where did you
come from? Huh?

550
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,220
I'm not quite sure.

551
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,550
Who sent you?
The gods?

552
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,760
Was it Zeus?
Apollo?

553
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,880
Athena?

554
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:10,220
Well, you're certainly a chatty
little fellow, aren't you?

555
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,840
I don't believe it!

556
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,300
You don't believe what?

557
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,760
I don't believe
the way you killed him.

558
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,260
Yes. But it
has to be done sometimes.

559
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,220
No. I mean it was
such a good shot.

560
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,970
I bet you've killed
lots of people.

561
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,180
Well, the gods must
have given you a name.

562
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,800
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

563
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,130
Kevin?

564
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,590
Well, Kevin,
here, it's yours.

565
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,590
- What?
- You don't want it?

566
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,380
Oh, yes, please.
You mean I can really have it?

567
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,470
Well, on condition that you
carry it back to the city for me.

568
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,050
Oh, great. But no,
I can't really.

569
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,090
I must wait. You see,
I'm with friends.

570
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,510
You see, if I lose them,
I may never be able to get back.

571
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,430
Get back? To where?

572
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,090
I'm not really sure.

573
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,760
Here, you better take this.
You'll need it. It's water.

574
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,340
There's enough there for your friends,
too, if they ever turn up.

575
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:25,220
Oh, and by the way,
thank you.

576
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,220
No. Please.
I'd like to come, really.

577
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,930
No, no, please.
I'd like to come.

578
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,220
Better? No.

579
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:13,270
You saved my life.
Remember?

580
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,770
The enemy of the people
is dead!

581
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,390
Hail King Agamemnon!

582
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,140
There's a man being
cut in half here.

583
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,890
It must have been a brilliant battle.
Choo! Choo!

584
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,480
All three are to receive
summary executions today.

585
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,890
If the queen wishes to see me,
I'll be in the courts all afternoon.

586
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,890
Remind the queen that
I still rule this city.

587
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,770
I wish I'd been
in the Trojan Wars.

588
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,350
Will you teach me
how to sword fight?

589
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,900
Come here. I'll teach you
something much more useful.

590
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,730
- Where is it?
- There.

591
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,610
That one.

592
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,230
Kings aren't supposed
to do things like that.

593
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,900
You know, I never, ever
want to go back.

594
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,400
Don't you want to see
all your friends again?

595
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,400
No, thanks.

596
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,110
To be in your own home, to be
with your own father and mother?

597
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,900
No.

598
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,270
Very well, then.

599
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,020
- I can stay?
- We'll decide that tomorrow.

600
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,780
I have decreed that this boy
shall remain here with us in our city.

601
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:14,400
Furthermore, he shall
from this day forward be my own son...

602
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,610
and heir to the throne
of Mycenae.

603
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,030
Let the banquet begin.

604
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,790
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

605
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:15,160
a mastery miracle of modern
magic before your very eyes.

606
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,290
Abracadee, abracadoo!

607
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:21,200
You're doing a great job.

608
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,410
If we can borrow this
for a moment, sir.

609
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:27,080
Please give generously
as my assistants pass amongst you.

610
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,660
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

611
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,950
Come on. Come on.

612
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,790
- Now all we need is a volunteer. Yes, young man, you'll do fine.
- No! Please!

613
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,870
No! Leave me!

614
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:51,370
Come on!
Come on!

615
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,500
- No way!
- May I? The crown?

616
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:57,580
Don't! Help me!

617
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,330
Kevin, let's get
out of here!

618
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:03,290
No! Please, no!

619
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:05,290
Thank you.

620
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:08,700
- No! Please!
- Watch this!

621
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,210
We make a great team,
don't we?

622
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:14,210
Now!

623
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,960
- Alone, at last.
- Isn't it glorious?

624
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,580
Yes. I love the ocean.

625
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:57,420
God, how I, how I love her.

626
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,670
- She's so, so damn-
- Wet?

627
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,670
Wet. Yes. Yes.

628
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:09,120
So damn... damn... wet.

629
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,210
Pansy.
Pansy, look at me.

630
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,960
- Yes, Vincent?
- Do you love me?

631
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,130
- Of course, I love you.
- You don't mind the, the thing on the end of my nose?

632
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,710
- Oh, you mean your- No, darling.
- Yes, my-

633
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,460
Don't be silly.

634
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,210
Could you share a house with a chap who has
a thing like this on the end of his nose?

635
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:37,210
Of course, my love.
Everyone has something odd about them.

636
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,960
- Why, I've got an enormous-
- Pansy!

637
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,290
Pansy, I'm so glad
you feel the way you do.

638
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,130
Because now I can ask you
what I've always wanted to ask you.

639
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,630
Oh, ask me.

640
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,540
Ask me!

641
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:55,040
Pansy, will you-

642
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,630
Will you-

643
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:06,670
Where the hell are we?

644
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,960
Someone hit me! Oh!

645
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,840
Pansy! Pansy!

646
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,750
Give me that!

647
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,040
You've ruined everything!
Pansy! Pansy, I can explain!

648
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:22,960
It's only the thing on my nose and the
hairpiece! Everything else is fine!

649
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,590
Fidgit, you're not supposed
to eat that.

650
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:34,710
- You're supposed to drink it.
- I like that. It's very nice.

651
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,710
Oh.

652
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,550
Six more plates
of caviar, please.

653
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,550
Anyone else want any?

654
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:46,050
No, none for me, thank you.
I'll stick with the quail's eyeballs.

655
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,380
The caviar makes me throw up,
you know.

656
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,880
- Waiter.
- Sorry, Randall. Sorry.

657
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,340
Cheer up, Kevin. Kings aren't
the only ones with money, you know.

658
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,800
The money wasn't important
to him.

659
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,420
He didn't have anything
to spend it on, did he?

660
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:05,800
Stuck out in Greece- lowest
standard of living in Europe.

661
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,760
You make me sick!

662
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:20,590
What?
Things are looking better all the time.

663
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,260
- I've got something to say to you.
- Go away!

664
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:28,420
It's about the map.

665
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,130
The map?
I don't understand you, Randall.

666
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,380
You've got something
really brilliant like that,

667
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,170
and you're just wasting it.

668
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,130
I wouldn't call this exactly...
wasting it.

669
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:43,260
Why couldn't you leave me
where I was happy?

670
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,630
Because when you hear
what I've got planned,

671
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,300
you're gonna be a lot happier.

672
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,920
I was havin' a close look at the map
last night. Do you know what I found?

673
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:59,090
Og was right.
The most fabulous object in the world.

674
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,130
It does exist.

675
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,260
Look.

676
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,760
- The time of legends- - The time
of legends! There's no such thing.

677
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,590
But there is.
You just gotta believe in it.

678
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,010
Otherwise, Horseflesh
wouldn't have put it on the map.

679
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:19,090
"In the middle of the time of legends
is a fortress of ultimate darkness,

680
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,340
and inside the fortress
of ultimate darkness,

681
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,590
the most fabulous object
in the world. "

682
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,260
Give it up, Randall.

683
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,800
Look.

684
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,590
You and me- we got a lot in common.

685
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,260
Not like that Og.

686
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,590
We like a risk.

687
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,140
We like adventure.

688
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,720
Well, this is it.

689
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,640
This is the big one.

690
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,340
No namby-pamby
time holes here.

691
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:54,140
We risk all.
We win everything.

692
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,760
Waiter, more champagne.

693
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,140
Yes, sir.

694
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,550
And plenty of ice.

695
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,350
Hello!

696
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,720
I want to go home!
I can't stand it!

697
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,720
You'll get us all killed,
Randall!

698
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,720
Stop whimpering, Fidgit!

699
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,640
How could I know we were gonna
run slap-bang into an iceberg?

700
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,760
It didn't say "Get off before
the iceberg" on the ticket.

701
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,760
Now- Now is the time...

702
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:47,140
to star- to start our quest for the-
for the most fabulous object, Randall.

703
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,640
- Og's right! I've got the map.
- No!

704
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,180
- Let's go!
- What?

705
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:58,430
Randall, we are in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean!

706
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:02,760
It doesn't matter where we are.
You just gotta believe in it!

707
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,310
You're crazy!

708
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:07,350
- We must try!
- No, don't!

709
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:09,760
- Abandon plank!
- No!

710
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:14,390
I can't swim!
I can't swim!

711
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:17,100
Help! Help!

712
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:22,770
- Don't worry, Fidgit! I'm coming!
- Help!

713
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:25,310
Help!

714
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:29,390
- Now we have them!
- Oh, well done. Well done, master.

715
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:41,220
Suddenly, I feel...
very, very good.

716
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,600
- I'm sorry, master.
- It'll pass. It'll pass.

717
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,430
- Shall I bring them in, master?
- Yes, Benson.

718
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,060
Bring them into the time of legends.

719
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,270
Hey!
Hey, I can swim!

720
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:31,270
Look.

721
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:34,310
Look!

722
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,310
Morning, dear.

723
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:52,940
Ooh!

724
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,440
- Help!
- Who's that?

725
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,150
- What, dear?
- Thought I heard a noise.

726
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:06,440
No. It's your nerves, dear.

727
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,480
Here we are, darling.

728
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,980
Come on.

729
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:20,310
And the ointment for the leg.

730
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,940
I grew too fast
when I was young.

731
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:27,270
- That was the problem.
- You've been overdoing it a bit, dear.

732
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:31,060
You try being beastly and terrifying
when you-

733
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:35,940
you can only get one hour's sleep
a night because your back hurts,

734
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,770
and you daren't cough
in case you pull a muscle.

735
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,440
But you are horrible, dear.

736
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,480
You're just sayin' that.

737
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,400
And gargle.

738
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,940
Come on, now. There's a good fellow.

739
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,110
- What's that?
- I don't know.

740
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,980
Wait for me!

741
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,770
Look at these bloody spots.

742
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,070
That's diet, that is.

743
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:17,820
- You'll outgrow them, dear.
- Look at all this bloody fish!

744
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,610
There used to be
a time when you could be sure...

745
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:24,480
of catchin'
old boots, cans,

746
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,520
hatracks, boxes.

747
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:29,610
Now it's prawns
all the bloody time!

748
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:34,150
Anti-pollution! Wife!

749
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,940
What d'you want, dear?
Do you want the foot powder?

750
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:42,780
No! Come out here
and help me!

751
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,070
- Quick!
- Dear.

752
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:52,230
- What's in there?
- I don't know, but it's not prawns.

753
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,440
Here.

754
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,980
Here, dear.
Leave that to me, please.

755
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:59,610
Yeah.

756
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,820
Aren't they lovely?
We can have them for breakfast.

757
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,110
Ah, you mean
eat their boots?

758
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:13,990
No, dear.
I mean, eat all of them.

759
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,070
Every little bit.

760
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,360
That means the big pot
and the large skewers.

761
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,610
What shall I do, dear?

762
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:26,990
Terrify them.

763
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:29,320
Oh, but what about me back?

764
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,110
Well, you don't have
to jump around.

765
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:34,650
Just shout horribly...

766
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,110
and leer at them.

767
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,650
You know,
the way you used to.

768
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:47,030
Right.

769
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:51,740
Oh, I'm so happy
'cause I'm bus-bus-bus-busy.

770
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,570
Right.

771
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,740
Go away!

772
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:08,490
Let's see.
What have we here?

773
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:10,740
Some tasty
little morsels, eh?

774
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,450
Help! Get off!

775
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,780
Hey! Put me down! Put me down!

776
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:22,490
Put me down!

777
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:29,450
# Yes, it's wonderful
to be making a fondue again #

778
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,990
Be quiet!

779
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,860
D- D-Does your back hurt?

780
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:43,570
- Huh?
- I know a cure for bad backs.

781
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:47,030
Bad back?
Me? An ogre?

782
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:56,410
- W-What you need i-is stretching.
- Stretching?

783
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:59,700
# To be melting the cheese
in the southerly breeze #

784
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:02,950
# To be sharpening
the skewer again #

785
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:06,280
Heave!

786
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,320
That's better!

787
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:12,070
That's better!
That's wonderful!

788
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,780
Heave again!

789
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,830
Are they in the pot, dear?

790
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:21,450
Yeah. Just about.

791
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:25,120
And one more for luck.
Heave!

792
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,660
- Two, three, left, right, left, right!
- Hey, what's going on?

793
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:32,660
Left, right!

794
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,280
Are you all right, dear?

795
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:42,160
- Oh! Quick! Into the pot!
- Yeah!

796
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,160
Winston?

797
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,830
Winston!

798
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,240
Is this part of the cure?

799
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:00,660
Winston.

800
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,660
What are you doing
in the water, dear?

801
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:14,790
Oh, my back is wonderful!

802
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:18,080
You've got to stop them, Winston!

803
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,330
I can cough!

804
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:25,200
At last,
I can really cough!

805
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,750
- Look out!
- We're going! We're saved!

806
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:36,500
- Yes! To that side! Quick!
- We're saved!

807
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,830
Catch all! Come on!

808
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:49,080
- Hold on!
- Hold on tight, Wally!

809
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,620
How're we doing now, Randall?

810
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,660
Just fine.

811
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,960
We're on the right course.

812
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,540
As long as this wind keeps up,
nothing can go wrong.

813
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,960
- Keep the rudder straight, Strutter.
- It is straight!

814
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:18,790
All hands on the tiller!

815
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:22,250
- Quick! Drop the sail!
- All right! Leave it to me!

816
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:27,080
One!

817
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,120
How about it? Eh?

818
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,250
I got it.

819
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:34,040
- That's it.
- That's better. We're out of that.

820
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:45,580
Randall! Randall?

821
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:48,080
I think there's something
that you should know.

822
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:04,830
Everybody below decks!

823
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,580
- Come on! Get in here!
- Quick! Get in!

824
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:31,130
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

825
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,340
Pull these boards out!

826
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,130
- You might sink the ship!
- Oh, shut up!

827
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,500
- Here's a hammer!
- That's it!

828
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:23,090
That's it! Now!

829
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:29,420
- Do it again!
- Harder! Really hard!

830
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:34,460
Oh, stop him!

831
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:41,630
Drugs! Hey!
I've got an idea!

832
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,550
Sleeping potion!

833
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:59,050
Strutter, take this!

834
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:03,340
Take the plug out!

835
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:12,170
Here!

836
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:15,920
Hey. Yeah!

837
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,170
- Hey.
- Yeah.

838
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:21,510
- Do it!
- And, heave!

839
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:25,300
Squeeze! Squeeze!

840
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,140
Hey! Oh!

841
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,300
Come on! Come!

842
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,430
Hey, what's out there?

843
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,180
Shh! Shh! Shh!

844
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:14,510
- Come on. Let's go. Run! Run!
- Quick!

845
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:37,310
The Fortress of Ultimate Darkness
is somewhere over there, I promise you!

846
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:40,260
Oh, you're joking, Randall.
There's nothing over there!

847
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:43,100
Look! We're so close!

848
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,390
Y- You've been saying that
for the last 40 miles!

849
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,600
Let's go back!
We'll all die out here!

850
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,600
- Yeah!
- You can't give up now.

851
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,140
- When can we give up?
- Come on. It's just a big further-

852
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,520
What is it?

853
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,600
I don't know,
but it hurts.

854
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:11,600
It's some kind
of invisible barrier.

855
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:15,850
Oh! So that's what
an invisible barrier looks like.

856
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,220
It's what this line
must be.

857
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:20,220
And just on the other side,

858
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:23,060
the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness.

859
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,310
We've made it, lads!
We're here!

860
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,810
You're mad, Randall!

861
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:32,980
Your brain's gone.
Do you know that?

862
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,180
I promise you,
this is it!

863
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,390
We are here!

864
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,180
- We're nowhere, Randall!
- Yeah!

865
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:44,020
- Look around! There's nothing!
- Yeah.

866
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,020
There's only one way
to go now.

867
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,600
- That's right. Back! Come on.
- Right!

868
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,640
- Come on. We're going back.
- No! Listen!

869
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,640
- No! Stop! Stop!
- No, you don't! Get out of the way!

870
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,310
- Listen to me!
- Get out of the way!

871
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:01,430
You'll never get back
without me.

872
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,640
Do you wanna bet?

873
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:09,140
- Wally, give that back.
- Get out of the way, Randall.

874
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:12,190
You give that back,
or I'll take your head off.

875
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,810
Randall! Don't do it!

876
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,400
We have found it!

877
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:45,650
Thank you.

878
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,110
Brilliant, Evil One.

879
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:17,860
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, master.

880
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,150
Fantastic.

881
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:40,690
Amazing.

882
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:43,480
Magnificent.

883
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:47,690
Look.

884
01:19:57,690 --> 01:19:59,650
- Move!
- Get out of the road!

885
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,980
Yes, folks. Moderno Designs present
the latest in kitchen luxury:

886
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:14,110
The Moderna Wonder Major
All-Automatic Convenience Center-ette.

887
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:19,030
And here they are- the winners of
the most fabulous object in the world.

888
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:22,480
The answer to all their
problems and yours...

889
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,530
is here for them tonight!

890
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,940
Hey!

891
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:32,530
- Don't go! Where are you going?
- We found it!

892
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,190
Wait! You're mad!

893
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,900
Come back!

894
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:44,690
- Let's go get it!
- Come on!

895
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:47,940
Here they come! So let's
give 'em a big welcome!

896
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:51,150
Trevor, Diane-
Oh, don't they look lovely!

897
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,990
Mom!

898
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,150
Dad!

899
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:05,990
Come on. Lead us in a big hand
for the lucky winners!

900
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,360
Come back!

901
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,690
- It's a trap!
- Fabulous.

902
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:23,990
Fabulous.

903
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:26,740
Here they are.
Congratulations.

904
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:31,240
But before they collect their prize, let's
just have a look at what made it possible...

905
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,450
for them to be here
with us tonight.

906
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,450
The map, please.

907
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:53,150
Let us out!

908
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:59,410
Let us out! Come back!

909
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:03,320
I have the map!
I have the map!

910
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:07,070
And the day after tomorrow,

911
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:09,280
the world!

912
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,490
Oh, no!

913
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:29,160
Rat, anybody?
Might be the last meal you get.

914
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,160
No. Leave off!

915
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:39,160
- That's it, then.
- It's all over.

916
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,950
We could've stayed at home
making trees.

917
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:46,320
- Oh, shut up.
- How could we have been so stupid?

918
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,490
I don't know.

919
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:08,830
Hey! Look, look!
Quick! Come on! Look!

920
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:11,200
Look at this.
Quickly!

921
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,620
- Look!
- Good one of Wally.

922
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,620
No! Look!

923
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,450
It's the map!

924
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:20,660
I can see it's the map.
What use is that to us now?

925
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,580
Look, closer.
The time of legends, see?

926
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,700
See the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness?

927
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,990
- That's a hole?
- Exactly!

928
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,160
- It could lead almost anywhere.
- Everywhere!

929
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,990
- What?
- We just found the biggest hole in the universe,

930
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,330
and it's practically below
our feet!

931
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,620
Kevin, you're a genius!

932
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:45,120
- Come on, you lot! Shift!
- We'll never get out of here!

933
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,120
Wanna bet?

934
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:52,540
No!

935
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:55,870
That's right, Og. Show 'em we can do
something right for a change.

936
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,790
That's it.

937
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,040
Let's have that.

938
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:53,330
Give us some more.

939
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,960
That's enough, Wally!

940
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,960
Okay, Strutter.

941
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:15,250
- Have you got the rope?
- Hold on!

942
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:17,330
Right.

943
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:20,000
Hold tight!
Keep straight!

944
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,040
- Watch your feet. Watch your feet.
- Easy.

945
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:35,330
Hold it.

946
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,620
Steady. Watch it.
Watch it.

947
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:47,380
Hold your fingers.

948
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,080
He's going!

949
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:07,080
- It's coming.
- Go now.

950
01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:09,880
Ready? And-

951
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,290
Again! Again!

952
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:49,710
- Ready, Wally!
- Okay, Strutter.

953
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:55,340
Here we go!
Geronimo!

954
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,460
Yeah!

955
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:03,300
Okay! Go, Strutter!

956
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:14,380
- Strutter!
- Hey! We've made it!

957
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,960
Okay, Wally.

958
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,300
Take up the slack.

959
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,710
Quick, Wally.

960
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,300
Go!

961
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:45,130
Come on!

962
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:47,510
Go, Vermin!

963
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:50,630
- Go, Fidgit!
- I don't wanna go! I don't wanna go!

964
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,880
- I'm going!
- Go!

965
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:02,300
Come on!

966
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,300
- Wally!
- Come on, Wally!

967
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:07,420
Right, lads!
Watch this!

968
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:24,220
Wally!

969
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,630
Pull the rope.

970
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:39,970
There he is!

971
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:41,970
- Wally!
- Wally!

972
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:47,130
Pull him up!
That's it!

973
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:52,680
- Well, we've done it.
- Yeah, we've done it.

974
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,630
- Now all we need is the map.
- What?

975
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:59,340
We don't need the map. We know where
the time hole is. Let's get out of here.

976
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:02,840
- But Evil's got the map, Randall!
- Oh, damn right, yes.

977
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,090
Last thing we want to do
is see him again. Come on.

978
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:08,340
But you can't leave it with him,
or he'll destroy the world!

979
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:15,010
Oh, Robert, Benson,

980
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:18,390
I feel the power of evil
coursing through my veins,

981
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:22,640
filling every corner of my being
with the desire to do wrong.

982
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,340
- I feel so bad, Benson.
- Good! Good!

983
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:30,840
Yes, it is good, for this is the worst
kind of badness that I'm feeling.

984
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:34,640
- Kill me, master! Kill me!
- Not now, Benson. We have work to do.

985
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:38,350
No less a work than the overthrowing
of creation itself.

986
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:42,680
We will remake man
in our image, not His.

987
01:29:43,930 --> 01:29:46,850
We will turn mountains
into sea,

988
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:50,300
and the skies into rivers,
and fjords into deserts.

989
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:53,350
- Come on! Come on!
- And deserts into quagmires.

990
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:56,220
The boy's insane.
We can't go in there.

991
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,260
Shh!

992
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:00,260
Oh!

993
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:02,720
- Let me see!
- And icebergs into fire!

994
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,930
And the fire into a mighty rushing wind
which will cover the face of the earth...

995
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:10,970
and wipe clean the scourge of woolly
thinking once and for all.

996
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:13,970
We can make beans
into peas!

997
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,390
Oh, Benson.

998
01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:22,010
Dear Benson, you are so mercifully free
of the ravages of intelligence.

999
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:26,640
- You say... such nice things, master.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

1000
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:33,970
Now, Benson, I shall have to turn you
into a dog for a while.

1001
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,970
Thank you, master.

1002
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:43,310
Stay, Benson.
Guard the map.

1003
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:48,140
Robert, we must plan
a new world together.

1004
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:50,140
This time
we'll start it properly.

1005
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,220
Tell me about computers.

1006
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:56,470
Uh, a computer
is an automatic electronic apparatus...

1007
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,140
for making calculations.

1008
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,970
Or controlling operations...

1009
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,180
that are expressible...

1010
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,970
in numerical
or logical terms.

1011
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:13,600
And fast breeder reactors?

1012
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,640
Ah, fast breeder reactors...

1013
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:20,520
use a fast fission process...

1014
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,020
for the generation
of fissile isotopes.

1015
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:33,850
Be quiet, Benson!

1016
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:36,390
Show me more, Robert.

1017
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,850
Show me-

1018
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:43,430
Show me...
subscriber trunk dialing.

1019
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,060
I must know everything.

1020
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:14,520
Come on! Throw!

1021
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,310
Throw it!

1022
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,190
Stop!

1023
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:38,230
Come on! Oh, no!

1024
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:41,230
Let's get out of here!

1025
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:43,400
Come on!

1026
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,690
Stop them by every means
in my power!

1027
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,610
It's coming this way!
Run for it!

1028
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:19,150
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

1029
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:37,650
We're trapped.

1030
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:41,190
- We've got to separate.
- What?

1031
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:44,400
Go down the time hole.
Go wherever you can and get help.

1032
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,360
- I'll divert them.
- But you can't do it on your own.

1033
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:51,940
No. I'll take one other.

1034
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:55,150
Well done, Og.

1035
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:57,730
Yes. Og and me'll stay.
Ready?

1036
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:03,150
Hey! Hey! This way!

1037
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,740
You are a very troublesome
little fellow.

1038
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:54,530
I think I should teach you
one of my special lessons.

1039
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:56,530
What do you think, Robert?

1040
01:34:56,570 --> 01:34:59,190
Benson, what would look nice?

1041
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,240
Half donkey?

1042
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,820
Half warthog?
Half oyster?

1043
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,820
Half carrot?

1044
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:13,030
Or the diseased left tonsil-

1045
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,990
Call off those, those creatures,
or I'll destroy the map forever.

1046
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:23,030
- Don't, don't be so stupid.
- Call them off!

1047
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:28,530
Very well.
I have no need of them.

1048
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:33,700
- Robert.
- Yes, master?

1049
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:35,820
Your time has come.

1050
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:40,030
Oh, wonderful, master! Wonderful!

1051
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:43,030
- Wonderful!
- Don't mention it.

1052
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:54,200
Benson.

1053
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:02,700
I'm a reasonable man.

1054
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:06,160
Give me the map,

1055
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:08,990
and you might at least walk out
of here on human feet.

1056
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:11,160
Og!

1057
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,700
No!

1058
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,660
No!

1059
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,740
No!

1060
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:13,910
This way, men.
Over there.

1061
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:29,910
Wally!

1062
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,660
- Where's the trouble, sonny?
- Down there!

1063
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:42,660
Aha!

1064
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:45,540
So... this is the best...

1065
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:49,160
the Supreme Being can do.

1066
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,870
I guess we'll have
a lynchin', eh? Yippee!

1067
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:56,700
Wait!

1068
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:08,660
Got him!

1069
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:12,500
See, sonny? No problem.

1070
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,160
Wait a minute!
Wait!

1071
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:21,580
Wait a minute!
Oh! Oh! Hey!

1072
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:24,540
Hold on! Hey! Hey!

1073
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:27,040
- Let me go!
- I don't feel so good!

1074
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,210
Fire!

1075
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,830
Look out!

1076
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:46,580
Charge!

1077
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,210
Strutter! Quick!

1078
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,210
Strutter!

1079
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:31,670
Next!

1080
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:36,550
Get him!

1081
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:43,210
Randall, go!

1082
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:46,590
Go!

1083
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:16,300
- I can't control it!
- Of course you can't, you silly man.

1084
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:18,880
I control them!

1085
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,670
Hurry! Help me!

1086
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,340
Get me down!

1087
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:53,010
Stay where you are!
Something's happening!

1088
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:08,050
Get out of the way, Fidgit!

1089
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:12,340
Get out of the way!

1090
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:28,930
- Fidgit!
- Hey! Hey, Fidgit!

1091
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:33,510
Fidgit!

1092
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:36,840
Quick! Push it off him!
Push it off. Quick.

1093
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:41,720
- He's dead.
- What?

1094
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,720
Fidgit's dead.

1095
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:46,970
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

1096
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:50,470
- It wasn't your fault, Wally.
- It was, it was his fault.

1097
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:52,760
- Get down, Wally!
- Get down!

1098
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,050
- Wally! Get down, Wally!
- Evil!

1099
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:58,390
Come on back!

1100
01:42:58,430 --> 01:43:01,640
Evil!
He killed my friend!

1101
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,340
I'll kill him!
Get off me!

1102
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:07,340
Get down!

1103
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:14,050
I'll kill him!

1104
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:56,850
Huh?

1105
01:43:56,930 --> 01:43:59,430
- Oh, no!
- He's found us!

1106
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:01,430
Quick! Ron for it!

1107
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:17,640
Oh! I hate
having to appear like that.

1108
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,970
Really,
it's the most tiresome way.

1109
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:21,970
Noisy manifestation.

1110
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:24,890
Still, rather expected
of one, I suppose.

1111
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:27,020
Get down! Get down!

1112
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:30,470
O Great One!
O Supreme Being!

1113
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,470
O Creator of all the universe,

1114
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,640
without whom we would be naught
but scarab beetles on the-

1115
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:39,180
What a dreadful mess!
Is the pig with you?

1116
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:44,720
Right.
Well, we'll sort him out first.

1117
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,180
Og!

1118
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:54,720
- Og, here! Quick! Out of the way!
- I was enjoying that.

1119
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:57,930
One thing I can't stand,
it's mess.

1120
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:00,430
I want all this stuff
picked up.

1121
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:03,730
Yes, sir.
Anything you say.

1122
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:08,180
- Anything you say, sir.
- Wally, tidy up!

1123
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:13,180
But, but he's dead, Randall.

1124
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:15,230
Fidgit, Fidgit's dead.

1125
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:18,850
Dead?
No excuse for laying off work.

1126
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:26,430
- Fidgit.
- Fidgit.

1127
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:30,020
Fidgit?

1128
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:33,690
- What happened?
- I'm sorry I killed you, Fidgit.

1129
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:36,020
He's okay!
He's okay!

1130
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:38,730
Oh, do hurry up.

1131
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:40,940
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1132
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:43,350
I'd like to explain everything.

1133
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:46,350
We didn't mean to steal the map.
We didn't mean to run away-

1134
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:49,640
What do you mean, you didn't
mean to steal the map?

1135
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:53,190
- It, it just sort of-
- Of course you didn't mean to steal it.

1136
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:57,980
I gave it to you.
You silly man. And that.

1137
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:03,640
- Do you really think I didn't know?
- Sir?

1138
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:07,310
I had to have some way
of testing my handiwork.

1139
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,560
I think it turned out
rather well.

1140
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:13,560
- Don't you?
- Hmm?

1141
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:18,350
Evil turned out rather well.
Mm-hmm.

1142
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:24,230
Whose are these?

1143
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:26,940
Mine, sir.

1144
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:29,560
They're mine, sir.

1145
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:32,480
You really are an untidy boy.

1146
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,350
Sign... here.

1147
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:41,480
Do you mean you knew
what was happening to us all the time?

1148
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:44,310
Well, of course.
I am the Supreme Being.

1149
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,770
- I'm not entirely dim.
- Oh, no, sir.

1150
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:48,770
We're not suggesting that, sir.
It's just-

1151
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:52,690
That I let you borrow
my map.

1152
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:58,560
Now I want every bit of Evil...

1153
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:00,730
placed in here.

1154
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:02,860
- Right away.
- Of course, sir.

1155
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,900
Come on.

1156
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:10,270
You mean you let all those people die,
just to test your creation?

1157
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:14,360
Yes.
You really are a clever boy.

1158
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:17,520
Why did they have to die?

1159
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:20,020
You might as well say,
"Why do we have to have evil?"

1160
01:47:20,110 --> 01:47:22,860
Oh, we wouldn't dream of asking
a question like that, sir.

1161
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:25,690
Yes. Why do we have
to have evil?

1162
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,690
Ah.

1163
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:32,570
- I think it's something
to do with freewill.

1164
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:36,070
Do be careful.

1165
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:38,070
You weren't watching.

1166
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:41,610
Don't lose any of that stuff.
That's concentrated evil.

1167
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:45,030
One drop of that could turn
you all into hermit crabs.

1168
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:47,980
I'm sorry, sir.

1169
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:50,980
I, I was just wondering
if there's, um,

1170
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:55,030
any chance we might
have our old jobs back, sir.

1171
01:47:55,110 --> 01:48:00,320
- Oh, you certainly were appallingly bad robbers.
- Yes, sir.

1172
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:04,230
I really should do something
very extrovert and vengeful with you.

1173
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,230
Honestly, I'm too tired.

1174
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:10,150
But I think I'll just transfer you
to the undergrowth department-

1175
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:13,070
yes, bracken, small shrubs-
that sort of thing-

1176
01:48:13,150 --> 01:48:18,240
with a 19% cut in salary
backdated to the beginning of time.

1177
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,360
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1178
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:24,070
Well, I am the nice one.

1179
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:26,740
Is it all ready? Right!

1180
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:30,360
Come on, then.
Back to creation.

1181
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,440
- I mustn't waste any more time.
- Bye, Kevin.

1182
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:38,030
They'll think I've lost control
again and put it all down to evolution.

1183
01:48:38,110 --> 01:48:40,070
- Come on.
- Sir?

1184
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:43,280
- Yes?
- What about my friend, sir? Can he come with us?

1185
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:46,940
No, of course not.
This isn't a school outing.

1186
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:48,940
But, sir,
he deserves something.

1187
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:52,570
- I mean, without him-
- Oh, don't go on about it.

1188
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:55,780
- He's got to stay here to carry on the fight.
- Fidgit!

1189
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:58,280
Come on. Fidgit!

1190
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:01,610
Hey! You can't go!

1191
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:04,780
- Hey, you can't leave me!
- Fidgit!

1192
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:06,450
- Fidgit, come on!
- Wait, please!

1193
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:10,200
- Come on, Fidgit!
- Hey! Stop!

1194
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:13,700
Hey!
Hey! Don't leave me!

1195
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:17,070
Hey! Help! Stop!

1196
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:20,700
Don't go! Help! Don't leave me!

1197
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:24,110
Hey! Don't go! Stop!

1198
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:27,700
Don't leave me! Please! Wait!

1199
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:31,110
Don't leave me! Please!

1200
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:42,910
Come on! Come on!

1201
01:49:45,070 --> 01:49:47,030
Let's go!

1202
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:58,160
- Let go! I've got to save it!
- Don't be a fool, Diane!

1203
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:01,070
- I'm going in for the toaster!
- No! No!

1204
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:04,200
- Oh, Trevor!
- Me super deluxe steamer!

1205
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,740
Oh!

1206
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:08,870
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1207
01:50:08,910 --> 01:50:10,870
I think so.

1208
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:14,070
You're a very lucky boy.

1209
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:17,450
Honestly, Trevor.
If you'd been half a man,

1210
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:19,910
you'd have gone in there
after the blender.

1211
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:34,240
- This is what started it.
- Eh?

1212
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,240
Left the Sunday joint
cookin' all night, didn't we?

1213
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:40,370
Sunday joint?
It's Thursday.

1214
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:42,410
I never touched it!

1215
01:50:42,450 --> 01:50:45,490
Well, someone put it on.

1216
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,490
Well, there was no meat
in there last night.

1217
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:50,030
Oh! Well, what do you
call this then?

1218
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:56,910
Mom! Dad!

1219
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:58,910
It's Evil!

1220
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:01,620
Don't touch it!

1221
01:51:30,370 --> 01:51:32,290
Mom?

1222
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,910
Dad?
