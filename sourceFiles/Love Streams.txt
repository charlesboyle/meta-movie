1
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,299
There was a bunch of pigs right here.

2
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:51,311
Gosh, this looks like a junkyard.

3
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,940
Well, there's your mother.

4
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:58,642
Robert, you're a coward.

5
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:00,688
You're disgusting.

6
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:04,688
And you make me sick the way
you're hiding behind my baby!

7
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:07,077
This is not a baby!
This is Renee, she's my friend...

8
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,828
Yeah and I'm not a maid!

9
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:13,706
They're taking over the house,
cigarettes,

10
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:15,912
all the booze.

11
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:19,170
They're using the silver.

12
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,133
Put me down you turkey sandwich.

13
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:35,898
- Thanks for bringing my car back.
- Oh, you're welcome.

14
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,185
I'm Robert Harmon.

15
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,603
Hi, I'm Laurie.

16
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:40,477
They're in your bathroom.

17
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:43,267
They've got the jewerly
all over, the makeup.

18
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:44,651
They take baths whenever they want to.

19
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:46,608
Hi, garbage lady!

20
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,450
I'm Phyllis.

21
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:52,372
- Stop trying to organize me, okay!
- I'm not trying to organize you, i'm...

22
00:01:56,376 --> 00:02:00,041
This place looks like it's going
to take three days to clean up.

23
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,378
- I'm Robert Harmon.
- Hi. Joanie.

24
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:06,251
You're a beautiful girl, Joanie.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,869
Do me a favor, will ya kids?
When you're finished

26
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,718
doing what you're doing,
just clean it up.

27
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,633
Because I only have a secretary,
and she's a little annoyed right now, okay.

28
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:18,852
I'm Robert Harmon.

29
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:24,487
You're drinking champagne, that's nice.
So, just finish it up, and...

30
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:40,867
Oh, Hi, you must be Mr. Harmon.

31
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:47,963
I'm sorry, just having fun,
just playing you know.

32
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,755
There wasn't enough hot water.

33
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:55,803
Joanie's gonna sing

34
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:58,145
or recite.

35
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,650
This is champagne, that's orange juice,
make a little marmosa.

36
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:10,073
Hurry up, like that,
cuz we don't want to hold her up.

37
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:13,195
Just pour yourself something.

38
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:17,323
Put a lil "Champs-Elysées" in it.

39
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:28,301
You sell?

40
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:29,965
What?

41
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,001
Anything.

42
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:35,175
You sell love,

43
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:39,386
you sell drugs,
you sell poetry,

44
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:42,061
whatever. What do you sell?

45
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,275
- How old are you?
- 18.

46
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,893
18, that's what you said.

47
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:50,988
18...

48
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,946
You dance?

49
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:59,120
Charlene tells me you sing.

50
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,159
Yeah, I try.

51
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,787
What do you sing?

52
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:05,751
I write poetry and I sing it.

53
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,587
Why don't you sing it?
I mean, you don't have to sing it.

54
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:14,219
You could recite it.

55
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:17,974
Just say it.

56
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:24,304
And don't look away, will you please,
because i'm going to record you.

57
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:29,060
What are you doing,
I don't know what you're doing?

58
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:30,816
See,

59
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,860
a beautiful woman,

60
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:39,907
has to offer a man her secrets.

61
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:45,294
I mean, that is so beautiful
I can't tell you.

62
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:52,711
You see, everyone in the world
is very screwed up.

63
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:55,759
Now I know that you're not screwed up

64
00:04:56,265 --> 00:05:00,393
And i'm not. And I know
the answer, and you know the answer.

65
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:02,555
But,

66
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:07,644
we can't tell them the answer
unless they ask us the question.

67
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,773
You see?

68
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:14,154
Tell me what a good time is.

69
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:15,860
A good time?

70
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,987
Yeah, you have to be with someone
to have a good time, don't ya?

71
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:22,032
Yeah, that helps.

72
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:29,082
Sex?

73
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:36,343
I think we do need that.

74
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:39,090
Yeah, for money.

75
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,063
You don't enjoy it?

76
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:57,193
You need someone to be with
to have a good time, don't ya?

77
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,318
Yeah, it helps.

78
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:02,695
Well, then tell me what a good time is.

79
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:11,624
Is it school?

80
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,545
Is it books, is it music, is it movies?

81
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,757
- What's the question?
- Good time, the best time, right?

82
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,629
Cooking.

83
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,725
I love to cook.

84
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,393
Cooking?

85
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:29,558
Cooking is the best time you've ever had?
Give me a break!

86
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,483
Give me another drink, over here.

87
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:33,361
I guess dreaming.

88
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:35,570
What do you dream?

89
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:24,593
Are you gay?

90
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:25,838
No.

91
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:27,720
Sorry.

92
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:29,763
No, I'm not.

93
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:35,388
It's okay. Don't worry.
You're safe here.

94
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:25,366
I'm Jill Dunbar.

95
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:27,113
The judge.

96
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,701
I'm Sarah Lawson.

97
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,243
This is my daughter Debbie.

98
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:49,216
Judge Dunbar?
Hi, I'm Milton Kravitz.

99
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:52,310
I represent Mrs. Lawson.
Have you two met?

100
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,562
Are you comfortable there?

101
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:56,935
Yeah, sure.

102
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:13,782
Sorry we're late.
Traffic was terrible.

103
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,705
You're beautiful.

104
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,959
Come over and sit here, please.

105
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:27,047
Why don't we have Debbie wait outside?

106
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:29,219
There is no reason for her to be here?

107
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:31,305
No, it's okay. I want to be here.

108
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:35,518
Sure, go outside Debbie. It'll just take
a minute and we'll call you right back in.

109
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,308
Jack, could she stay here, please?

110
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:40,563
I mean, she knows everything.

111
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:43,942
We don't want our baby
standing out in the hall.

112
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:55,536
We are in agreement on
the money settlement.

113
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,828
That is correct.

114
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:01,339
And Debbie has agreed to live with her
mother, there is no disagreement on that.

115
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,168
You sign these, we can finish quickly.

116
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:15,766
I have immediate plans to take Debbie
with me to Houston or New York.

117
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:18,553
I don't know when we'll be back.

118
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:21,143
New York?

119
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:23,151
Houston?
Where did that come in?

120
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:26,610
We're not gonna go to a funeral.
It's okay.

121
00:11:26,822 --> 00:11:30,321
What is the understanding that you've
come to on this visit?

122
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:33,910
You see, we go to
a lot of funerals.

123
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:38,286
I go to funerals, and hospitals

124
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,742
and some weddings.

125
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:45,923
You might say that's what I do:
I visit sick people.

126
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,876
Mothers, fathers,

127
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:50,885
sisters, brothers,

128
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:52,638
uncles,

129
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,722
nephews, aunts.

130
00:11:56,727 --> 00:12:00,855
I don't have any relatives myself,
but Jack does.

131
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:06,691
Some of these are in Houston,
and Jack's aunt is in New York.

132
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:11,697
Which I would feel very uncomfortable
going to if she wasn't there.

133
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:14,199
But nobody died this time.

134
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,119
Just sick, you know.

135
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:26,621
People like Debbie and me
to be with them

136
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,339
when they aren't feeling well,
because we're cheerful.

137
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:36,891
Says right here: "Visiting privileges
every other weekend.

138
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:40,221
From Saturday noon til Sunday at 7.

139
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:43,189
Mr. Lawson will be entitled to take
Debbie Lawson

140
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:47,182
to where he resides or any
other reasonable place."

141
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:50,650
Wasn't that what you had agreed to?

142
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,157
You see Judge

143
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:00,996
when someone is temporarily insane

144
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,580
like Jack here is...

145
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:07,124
And he's a wonderful guy, but...

146
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:10,957
You see,
when someone is like that,

147
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:15,045
they don't want to see the
people that they really love.

148
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,598
Okay, I understand that.

149
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:21,893
A person who is sick has to get well

150
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,773
before he can be normal, right?

151
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:31,352
So, when Jack finishes his...

152
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,741
sleeping around everywhere,

153
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,951
and he wants to assume
his responsibilities,

154
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:42,242
he wants to be a real father to Debbie,
he can see her.

155
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:47,578
If Debbie is a very old lady when
he makes up his mind,

156
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,836
that's when he'll see her.

157
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:57,172
I don't understand.

158
00:13:59,016 --> 00:14:01,092
You feel that your husband

159
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,562
should not see Debbie at all?
Ever?

160
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:12,274
Well, I object. I think Mrs. Lawson
is breaking the understanding.

161
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:15,113
I don't understand.

162
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:16,984
I don't understand.

163
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,242
He's the one that wants a divorce.

164
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,955
One of the reasons we're having difficulty

165
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:29,208
with something we've already agreed to,

166
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,627
is that my wife hasn't been cured.

167
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:34,042
I'm a very happy person.

168
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:37,218
My wife has been in and out of institutions
since our marriage.

169
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,179
That's one of the reasons
why we're having difficulty

170
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,471
with something that we've
already agreed to.

171
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,226
She hasn't been cured.

172
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:47,477
I have a problem. I...

173
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:53,066
I love my family. I love him,
and I love her. I love them, just them.

174
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:56,395
And,

175
00:14:57,032 --> 00:15:00,615
when I can't be cheerful...

176
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,207
When you get a headache, or

177
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:11,710
you feel really bad.

178
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:15,249
I go to the hospital.

179
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:20,629
And I stay there until I feel that I can
take care of things again.

180
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,845
Just stepping out of the way for awhile.

181
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:30,264
Until his little sex things are over...

182
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:34,728
Whatever it is that causes me
to get the headaches...

183
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,566
Something like that.

184
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:21,232
Could I have a glass of champagne
in a crystal glass, please?

185
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:23,443
I love crystal!

186
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,447
I'm Phyllis. That's my stage name.

187
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:28,448
Lovely nails you have.

188
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,875
You're a straight

189
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:33,459
and a marvelous writer.

190
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:39,335
I just love the way you
write about loneliness.

191
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:42,552
You make it sound so
exciting and romantic.

192
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:47,805
I saw you in here last month.
Are you working on a new book?

193
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:01,404
Are you doing something on us?

194
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:07,280
Yes, i'm writing a book on nightlife,
as a matter of fact.

195
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:16,584
Could I have your telephone number
please, your card, something?

196
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,161
Lucky boy!

197
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:21,715
Now is this for research or what?

198
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:23,338
It's uh...

199
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,924
She's beautiful.

200
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,391
You know her name?

201
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,723
Susan.

202
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:40,434
I think with all beautiful women,
they have a secret.

203
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:44,071
And the interesting thing,

204
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:46,735
is to get that secret out.

205
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:49,525
If they volunteer that secret to me.

206
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:52,957
Yeah, I guess.

207
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,203
I'm a writer,
that's why i'm saying that.

208
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:59,328
I know, I saw you on TV.

209
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:03,917
Haven't read any of your books, though,
don't have too much time.

210
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:08,765
- I did the cigarette trick...
- Watch the tablecloth.

211
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:10,385
Give me your glass.

212
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:14,138
What should we drink to?

213
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,318
I can't think of anything.

214
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:28,858
You're ambitious enough, I think.

215
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:33,790
When I came in here about a month ago,

216
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:39,375
there were these two
very cute little girls

217
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:43,586
that were singing along with you.
They were backup singers.

218
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,720
They're not here anymore.
And that bothers me.

219
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:58,721
- Does it bother you?
- No.

220
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,406
What time is it?

221
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,576
I want to write a book about you.

222
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:22,874
Why, you think I want to be a big star?

223
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,549
I've gotta go.

224
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:34,135
It was fun.

225
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:46,110
I like the way you move.

226
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,781
I really like the way you move.

227
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,642
I'm right here.

228
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,477
That's nice.

229
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,485
Give me your keys, give me your keys.

230
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:37,618
My dress!

231
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:42,160
You know what they say about
beautiful women. Their secrets.

232
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,124
They'll give 'em to you gladly, this is...

233
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,080
Where do you live?

234
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,120
Do you know where you live?

235
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:26,796
Get out, okay.

236
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:30,212
Get out of here!

237
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:34,293
Well then, move over.

238
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,767
Gotta get out of my car.

239
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:47,222
Get out!

240
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:49,186
Out of my car!

241
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,070
Enough, okay!

242
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:54,569
Come on! Let go!

243
00:21:55,742 --> 00:21:56,774
Get out of here.

244
00:21:56,994 --> 00:21:58,702
You're amazingly strong.

245
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:02,909
I'll drive, alright.

246
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,869
Where do you live?

247
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,083
I'll drive.

248
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:18,046
Make a right, at the corner.

249
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,282
Okay, this is fine,
this is fine, stop.

250
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:42,784
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys!

251
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,285
Turn off the lights.

252
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:49,998
Turn the radio off. Are you crazy?
Give me the keys.

253
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:10,997
Can you walk?
Come on, we gotta get off the street.

254
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:18,716
Put your arm around me.

255
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,218
You taking me to bed?

256
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,348
Where are we?

257
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:32,231
My house.

258
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:39,107
Perfect ending to a
lovely evening.

259
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:49,989
I'm alright.

260
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:52,282
I'm alright...

261
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:08,888
I'm usually a lot more fun,
i'll tell you that right now.

262
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:23,483
Come on darling, I want you
to eat some soup now.

263
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,660
Do the best you can.

264
00:25:26,912 --> 00:25:30,826
Cuz i've got to get you out of
this room so the child can play.

265
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:08,740
Hi, Robert.
I'll be right with you.

266
00:26:12,124 --> 00:26:13,369
Is that your mom?

267
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:30,800
I really should give you
a lot of money, but I...

268
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:33,176
A few thousand dollars will do.

269
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,151
I want to thank you very,
very much for what you've done.

270
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:49,944
You're very welcome. I was really
the one who did the most for you.

271
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:52,997
She wouldn't do anything.
I had to undress you.

272
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:56,285
You're the one that undressed me?
You took all my clothes off?

273
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,999
And you nursed me,
and you washed my shirt?

274
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:01,585
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

275
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:05,631
But I don't want you
to be a mother now.

276
00:27:06,178 --> 00:27:09,761
Because it confuses me when a beautiful
women like you becomes a mother.

277
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,093
I'm not a mother really.

278
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:14,012
Good bye, thank you.

279
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:42,754
Excuse me, please.

280
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:46,004
I'm really sorry to be late.

281
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:49,379
Well, you understand.

282
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:53,339
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me...

283
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:03,017
Okay. We can start.

284
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:06,359
Mother.

285
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:09,941
I want to go with my father.

286
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:17,495
I hate my life with you.

287
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:22,872
I hate going to see all
those dying people.

288
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:27,044
I hate being with those old people.

289
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:30,129
They smell.

290
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,478
Excuse me, could I sit there, please?

291
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:04,837
They smell?

292
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,014
When did you first decide
that they smell?

293
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:25,437
I want to go with my father.

294
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:28,607
I don't want to go with you anymore.

295
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,613
I don't want to be a slave.

296
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:39,282
Nice...

297
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,542
Nobody leave this room

298
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,758
until we find out what it means.

299
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:55,219
I can discuss it.
I have a lot of time.

300
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:01,968
What is it that you want to discuss?

301
00:30:03,438 --> 00:30:04,767
Love.

302
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:15,654
We're dealing with legal matters.

303
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,945
And as painful as it seems,

304
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,826
this is usual in divorce cases.

305
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:31,376
Please, Mrs. Lawson.
I must ask you to sit down, please.

306
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:53,485
Roll her over on her side.

307
00:30:57,743 --> 00:31:00,412
You're going to be okay, darling.
Just relax.

308
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,535
You're doing real good.
Just relax.

309
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:08,330
We love you. We love you.
Just relax.

310
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:12,545
So what do you think that is?

311
00:31:16,595 --> 00:31:17,758
Loss.

312
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:23,178
You don't own anything. So how can
you lose something that you don't own?

313
00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:38,691
Love is a stream.

314
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:43,534
It's continuous.
It doesn't stop.

315
00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:46,414
No, it does stop.

316
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:49,500
Oh no, it does not stop.

317
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:54,836
Your love is too strong for your family.

318
00:31:57,427 --> 00:32:00,428
I want you to describe your sexual life.

319
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:16,272
- I don't have a sexual life.
- You do.

320
00:32:18,282 --> 00:32:21,318
I don't need a sexual life.

321
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:32,710
What other interests do you have
besides your husband?

322
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,084
He doesn't love you.

323
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,584
That's not true.

324
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:42,338
And your daughter who
chose him over you.

325
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:55,189
If you don't let go, and if you
don't get some balance in your life,

326
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:59,355
something creative, some sex,
I don't care with whom,

327
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:04,154
then you're going to have to go back to
the bughouse where you don't belong.

328
00:33:13,086 --> 00:33:15,494
Go to Europe.
They don't know you there.

329
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:19,047
You have money, see something.

330
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:20,916
Be alone.

331
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,546
Meet someone, you're attractive.

332
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,682
Oh, thank god.
Will you help me, please?

333
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:20,850
I am American,
and I must have your help.

334
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:24,607
I have all of this luggage.

335
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,949
I'll give you $25 if you help me, please.

336
00:35:05,824 --> 00:35:07,983
Listen to me. Listen.

337
00:35:08,285 --> 00:35:10,324
You can understand me if you want to.

338
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:13,829
I have to get this baggage,
I have no one to help me.

339
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:17,659
Maybe you should get a carriage.
But I must get to track 9.

340
00:35:17,878 --> 00:35:20,748
And i'm already late.

341
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:25,925
You'll take it for me, right?

342
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:28,421
You're not going to go away, are you?

343
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,094
You're coming back, right?

344
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:37,060
I'm going to wait for you right here.

345
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,017
I'll be right here, okay.

346
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:46,440
That's good. You're just fine,
just go on ahead.

347
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:51,327
That's it. Over a little bit to
the right. That's it.

348
00:35:58,794 --> 00:36:00,169
Wait. Wait.

349
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:02,672
I've got it.

350
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:09,551
Are you taking a bus or
do you want a taxi?

351
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,210
No, I want a plane.

352
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:13,475
I'm going to go home.
I've got to get out of here.

353
00:36:13,642 --> 00:36:15,601
Well you can't take a plane
from here, love. This

354
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:17,442
is a train station, they
roll 'em out of here.

355
00:36:17,604 --> 00:36:20,724
I've got to get home.
Listen, would you do me a favor?

356
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:24,310
Would you make a call for me, please.
Would you telephone my husband.

357
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:27,280
I want to call him in
Chicago, Illinois.

358
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:34,990
I hate Europe.

359
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,829
Can I have the overseas operator, please.

360
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:47,381
- France was worse.
- I don't like that place much myself.

361
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:50,589
Yes, i'd like to place a personal call.

362
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,514
Couldn't talk to anybody there.

363
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,133
Who am I calling?

364
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:56,601
Mr. Jack Lawson.

365
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:01,349
In the United States.

366
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:04,556
What's his number, love?

367
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:12,318
Reverse the charges.

368
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:15,327
What's your name, love?

369
00:37:16,914 --> 00:37:17,945
Sarah.

370
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:27,967
Here you go, love. They're ringing
right through. Come on.

371
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:39,141
I'm almost not crazy now.

372
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,517
I just don't care.

373
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:34,437
You alright, love?

374
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:37,534
I'm fine, I'm fine.

375
00:38:40,455 --> 00:38:42,282
Hi, Robert.
How are you?

376
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,994
How have you been?

377
00:38:46,253 --> 00:38:47,628
What are you doing here?

378
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:50,543
Well, I happened to be
in the neighborhood...

379
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:57,170
Actually I hadn't heard from you
and I wondered how you were.

380
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:02,095
Actually, my mother was worried about you.
I think she misses you.

381
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:04,761
Everybody's always worried about me.

382
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:08,523
Actually i'm fine, you can see that.
And I can't let you in.

383
00:39:08,775 --> 00:39:12,607
It's okay, I don't want to come in.
Guess you have company.

384
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,275
You're right there.

385
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,487
I've got to go to work.

386
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:23,163
I wanted to ask you something.

387
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:28,246
Do you think we should see
each other again or what?

388
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:33,458
I'd like for us to be friends,
if you want a friend.

389
00:39:41,642 --> 00:39:43,515
Take care of yourself, Robert.

390
00:39:44,811 --> 00:39:46,436
Keep in touch, okay?

391
00:40:02,913 --> 00:40:04,704
Oh, geez, turn the light off.

392
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:10,461
I'm going to kill someone.

393
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:18,386
What's the matter?

394
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:20,671
I'm looking for my white shoes.

395
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:24,721
White shoes. Did you see
Phyllis' big white shoes?

396
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,061
Underneath the kitchen table.

397
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:58,091
Get that, please.

398
00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:09,093
So what?

399
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:13,012
Who was it?

400
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,187
There's a car coming
around to the front.

401
00:41:28,457 --> 00:41:32,122
There is some lady and a little boy here.
And he's carrying a whole bunch of flowers.

402
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:35,585
They're coming up to the
front door, Robert.

403
00:41:45,474 --> 00:41:46,885
This is your son.

404
00:41:55,817 --> 00:41:57,775
You owe him for four weeks.

405
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:01,060
You want this in one check,
or you want it in four checks?

406
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:02,484
One check.

407
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:04,324
Here is some flowers.

408
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:07,568
Thank you. But let me just get this...

409
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:10,742
Robert, I gotta ask you a favor.
Would you do it?

410
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,081
If it's for money, yes.

411
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:17,294
You asked me not to call,
so I wrote you 3 letters.

412
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,881
I just don't answer my mail.

413
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,886
My husband and I, we have a big chance to
raise some money in someone's big house.

414
00:42:26,348 --> 00:42:29,384
We'll stay overnight.
And they don't want kids.

415
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:32,768
- You want me to take the boy.
- Yeah, overnight.

416
00:42:37,651 --> 00:42:40,901
- Until when?
- We'll be home tomorrow at 2pm.

417
00:42:42,656 --> 00:42:43,771
Alright.

418
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:46,441
You haven't even seen your
son since he was born.

419
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,320
I said yes, didn't I?

420
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,080
I'll be home Sunday night.
Today's Saturday.

421
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:53,999
I even have Albie's suitcase in the car.

422
00:42:54,209 --> 00:42:57,958
Fine, let's get the suitcase and let's
get on with it. Come on, let's go.

423
00:43:02,009 --> 00:43:03,717
Wave goodbye to your mother.

424
00:43:19,985 --> 00:43:21,479
Flowers.

425
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,318
Really nice, wanna hold 'em?

426
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:32,580
Close the door.

427
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:47,091
I'm gonna introduce you to some people.

428
00:43:54,144 --> 00:43:56,101
This is my son Albie.

429
00:43:57,564 --> 00:43:59,889
I'd like to introduce you to Charlene,

430
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:02,564
who is my secretary,
my friend, my accountant

431
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:05,613
and her daughter Renee
who is also my friend.

432
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:09,655
- How old are you?
- 8.

433
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,280
Well, let's go.

434
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:22,207
Yeah, what do you want?

435
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:28,126
This is my son Albie.
He's going to spend the night with us.

436
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:31,345
Hi, Albie.

437
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:36,799
What's wrong?

438
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:56,956
Robert, go get him.

439
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:01,208
He's your son for god's sake!

440
00:46:37,683 --> 00:46:40,256
- Alright, come on. Let's go.
- Mr. Harmon?

441
00:46:40,477 --> 00:46:41,852
Don't call me Mr. Harmon.

442
00:46:42,062 --> 00:46:45,229
That's insulting.
I know it and you know it.

443
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,644
- I hate you.
- Yeah I know, that's cuz i'm your father.

444
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:00,116
The boy still asleep?

445
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,122
Yeah, he's upstairs in bed.

446
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:04,702
Here's your check.

447
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:05,997
Thank you, darling.

448
00:47:06,211 --> 00:47:07,955
Mary, Annette.

449
00:47:09,047 --> 00:47:10,292
Thank you, I love you.

450
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:12,215
Joanie.

451
00:47:13,093 --> 00:47:15,251
Joanie, i'm sorry Phyllis.

452
00:47:16,054 --> 00:47:18,012
Charlene, have your numbers?

453
00:47:42,748 --> 00:47:45,321
Take good care of these chickens, okay.

454
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:49,870
You take care, bye baby.

455
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,134
You're the man now, you take
care of these little children.

456
00:47:57,012 --> 00:47:59,585
Goodbye kids, good luck
in your new careers.

457
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:20,403
Bye bye, sweetheart.

458
00:49:33,442 --> 00:49:35,019
We'll be alright, Robert.

459
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:36,943
You better get back to the kid.

460
00:49:37,487 --> 00:49:39,112
You shouldn't leave him alone.

461
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,620
Are you awake?

462
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:49,964
Go to your right, then go right again.

463
00:50:51,812 --> 00:50:53,686
Can I use your toothbrush?

464
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:55,273
Use your finger.

465
00:50:57,693 --> 00:50:59,851
I want to have breakfast, but

466
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:03,649
I have to clean up first.

467
00:51:06,326 --> 00:51:09,244
If I have breakfast without
cleaning up I vomit.

468
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,992
You get through with
this, you can help me...

469
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,877
get these empty cigarette packs off here...

470
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:26,425
and this stuff here, then we can eat.

471
00:52:18,106 --> 00:52:19,304
All done.

472
00:52:27,366 --> 00:52:31,909
Want a drink? Would you like
a Coca-Cola, or a beer?

473
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:33,616
A beer.

474
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:03,481
Would you like a little toast?

475
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:41,852
Did you run away because I was born?

476
00:53:43,984 --> 00:53:47,483
No, I didn't even know you were coming.

477
00:53:56,538 --> 00:53:59,456
I don't like men a lot, you know.

478
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:03,122
I'm a writer. I don't make money on men.

479
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:06,244
No one's really interested.
They're kinda boring.

480
00:54:11,303 --> 00:54:13,592
When you're 14 I think you oughta...

481
00:54:19,144 --> 00:54:21,469
hitchhike across the country,

482
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:24,930
go into a truckstop, stop there.

483
00:54:26,735 --> 00:54:28,728
Have a cup of coffee,

484
00:54:30,197 --> 00:54:31,990
and see what men are really like, you know.

485
00:54:32,658 --> 00:54:36,821
Men. Not these people out here
with the suits and ties...

486
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:39,114
that kind of stuff, you know.

487
00:54:44,336 --> 00:54:46,293
I had a picture of you.

488
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:48,415
My father tore it up.

489
00:54:50,717 --> 00:54:52,509
My mother cried,

490
00:54:53,345 --> 00:54:55,801
they had a big fight, and he hit her.

491
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,554
And they changed my name to
Albie Swanson, like his.

492
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:04,729
And mother cries all the
time thinking about you.

493
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:07,649
Please come back to her.

494
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:19,444
She sleeps with another
man every night, you know.

495
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:21,323
You know what that means?

496
00:55:25,002 --> 00:55:27,493
She has had a baby by another man.

497
00:55:28,088 --> 00:55:29,831
So, that part of...

498
00:55:31,967 --> 00:55:33,710
that part of...

499
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,221
is over.

500
00:55:40,225 --> 00:55:44,437
I don't like women anyway, you know.
I really don't. I like kids.

501
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:50,227
And I like older people.

502
00:55:52,988 --> 00:55:55,823
Cuz they seem to have the secret...

503
00:55:57,868 --> 00:55:59,492
They don't need anything.

504
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:02,411
You don't need anything.

505
00:56:03,582 --> 00:56:06,203
They just want...
You're innocent.

506
00:56:06,418 --> 00:56:09,621
And so are old people, they're innocent.
That's what I like about them.

507
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:12,412
Drink your drink here.
Come on, drink it down.

508
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:38,527
Hey, dad!

509
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,794
What's wrong?

510
00:56:53,006 --> 00:56:56,874
Someone's here. There's a cab
outside. There's two cabs.

511
00:56:57,553 --> 00:57:00,423
You go out there and you tell them

512
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:04,260
to go away.

513
00:57:19,032 --> 00:57:20,859
I have a lady in the cab.

514
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:29,121
Paris.

515
00:57:42,347 --> 00:57:43,427
Dad?

516
00:57:49,897 --> 00:57:51,936
This is my son Albie,
from the second marriage.

517
00:57:52,149 --> 00:57:53,892
Albie, Sarah.

518
00:57:58,822 --> 00:58:02,606
Oh, my god.
I haven't seen you...

519
00:58:05,245 --> 00:58:08,780
I haven't seen him since he
was in the hospital being born.

520
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:14,496
I would've brought you a present, only I
didn't know I was going to be here...

521
00:58:14,713 --> 00:58:17,584
I didn't know you were going to...
I didn't know I was going to...

522
00:58:17,799 --> 00:58:18,914
Hi.

523
00:58:22,262 --> 00:58:24,967
- A load of trunks.
- Yeah, I see that.

524
00:58:25,224 --> 00:58:27,050
Well take them all into the house, alright.

525
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:29,551
Alright Jim, let's get these bags.

526
00:58:37,277 --> 00:58:38,558
Let's take it in.

527
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:53,162
I just can't believe it.

528
00:58:53,377 --> 00:58:56,496
I can't believe I got here, I can't
believe i'm actually here.

529
00:58:56,797 --> 00:58:59,335
I can't believe i'm seeing you.

530
00:59:02,678 --> 00:59:07,090
You're nuts. You're really nuttier
than fruitcake. I love you.

531
00:59:08,684 --> 00:59:10,094
Where do these bags go?

532
00:59:13,814 --> 00:59:17,099
Bags go-you can put 'em on
the first floor or the upstai...

533
00:59:17,317 --> 00:59:19,061
put 'em on the upstairs landing, alright?

534
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:22,447
Just, on the upstairs landing.
That'll be good.

535
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,153
How about a drink?

536
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:27,153
No, I really shouldn't.
Perhaps, well, one maybe.

537
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:30,655
One only, cuz I was flying
first class and...

538
00:59:30,873 --> 00:59:34,242
- Well, this is not going to hurt ya.
- Make it a weak one, please.

539
00:59:34,459 --> 00:59:37,911
Get a little ice. Need
a little ice for ya.

540
00:59:38,964 --> 00:59:41,716
Put it in this glass.
Sorry, excuse me.

541
00:59:53,228 --> 00:59:54,806
Do you like your father?

542
00:59:59,484 --> 01:00:03,613
Well he happens to be a wonderful
person, everybody likes him.

543
01:00:10,204 --> 01:00:14,581
- Will you have vodka, scotch?
- Yeah, just a small one really.

544
01:00:21,757 --> 01:00:23,465
Albie's mother brought him over here,

545
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:25,086
cuz I haven't seen him
since he was born either.

546
01:00:25,302 --> 01:00:28,801
We were just reminiscing,
going over old times.

547
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,338
Gettin' drunk.

548
01:00:32,851 --> 01:00:35,769
And i'm gonna take him to Las Vegas.

549
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:37,427
Las Vegas?

550
01:00:37,981 --> 01:00:38,847
You want to go?

551
01:00:43,028 --> 01:00:44,606
Do you want her to go?

552
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,275
No.

553
01:00:47,407 --> 01:00:49,447
- Okay, go get your bag.
- But dad.

554
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:51,445
Get your bad, let's go.

555
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:55,207
You want to see the rest of the house?

556
01:00:55,874 --> 01:00:57,368
Come on, i'll show you the house.

557
01:00:59,294 --> 01:01:01,203
This is the kitchen.

558
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:03,454
The kitchen.

559
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:06,500
- Can you drive?
- Sure I can drive.

560
01:01:06,718 --> 01:01:10,930
Here are the keys to my car,
and you go down to...

561
01:01:11,515 --> 01:01:13,342
you go down to...

562
01:01:13,642 --> 01:01:15,469
out of the driveway, turn right,

563
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:17,809
go down right again,
then you hit Ventura.

564
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:21,604
And there's a big shopping center
down there and you can't miss it.

565
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,982
I read all your books.

566
01:01:31,994 --> 01:01:34,117
Yeah, they're in the bookcase.

567
01:01:34,621 --> 01:01:37,291
- They're all about women.
- I know.

568
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:39,124
What took you so long?

569
01:01:45,257 --> 01:01:47,712
If anyone calls, just say I died.

570
01:01:47,926 --> 01:01:49,596
Yeah? How long are you going to be dead?

571
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:51,837
I don't know. Couple of days, just say.

572
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:23,206
Who was that?

573
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:26,871
- Sarah, you mean?
- Yeah, Sarah.

574
01:02:27,382 --> 01:02:28,663
Do you love her?

575
01:02:29,593 --> 01:02:31,502
Not the way you mean.

576
01:02:32,387 --> 01:02:33,716
Do you kiss her?

577
01:02:34,806 --> 01:02:37,095
Not the way you mean, I said.

578
01:02:48,779 --> 01:02:50,487
Imperial Palace.

579
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:54,443
Ah, Dean! How are ya?

580
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,533
Here for a little R&R, or ya gonna
make an assault on us this trip?

581
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:59,829
- Ah, I got my bodyguard with me.
- Your a computer expert, I know it.

582
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,958
Albie, This is Dean Shindel.
Say hello.

583
01:03:03,168 --> 01:03:06,703
Your suite's blocked and your
tux is pressed and on the way up.

584
01:03:11,343 --> 01:03:13,095
Where would you like your bag, Mr. Harmon?

585
01:03:13,178 --> 01:03:14,720
On the bed.

586
01:03:19,768 --> 01:03:21,096
That's fine.

587
01:03:22,354 --> 01:03:24,898
- Here ya are, my friend.
- Thank you, sir. There's your key.

588
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,953
- Your tuxedo.
- Oh good. Thank you.

589
01:03:50,632 --> 01:03:53,966
Put it right there on the chair.
You have the shoes?

590
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:58,256
The shirt, the tie, everything in there?

591
01:04:00,183 --> 01:04:02,639
- Anything else?
- No, no. Here.

592
01:04:06,231 --> 01:04:07,429
How do you feel?

593
01:04:09,067 --> 01:04:10,396
Okay.

594
01:04:14,072 --> 01:04:15,816
Still a little drunk?

595
01:04:17,743 --> 01:04:19,486
Stomach a little upset?

596
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:26,326
You oughta go to sleep.

597
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:32,961
Listen.

598
01:04:33,717 --> 01:04:35,176
I'm a man.

599
01:04:37,137 --> 01:04:40,423
And a man, is different
than a little kid.

600
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:45,601
I find it very hard
to go to sleep alone.

601
01:04:46,146 --> 01:04:47,688
You know what I mean, don't you?

602
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:50,982
- Do you?
- Yeah.

603
01:05:08,669 --> 01:05:10,079
Maid!

604
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:18,257
Can I turn down your bed?

605
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:21,222
Did you just get in?

606
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:22,546
Earlier.

607
01:05:22,766 --> 01:05:24,426
You're all by yourself, huh?

608
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:27,305
You hungry?

609
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:30,681
A big boy like you is not hungry?

610
01:05:30,899 --> 01:05:33,984
When did you eat last?
Where's your mom?

611
01:05:34,862 --> 01:05:36,486
In Los Angeles.

612
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:07,841
Not right now.

613
01:06:14,484 --> 01:06:16,228
Oh, I gotta give you checks.

614
01:06:25,287 --> 01:06:27,078
Carla Friedricks.

615
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:31,121
Spell it.

616
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:42,294
Gotta see my son, you know.

617
01:06:46,975 --> 01:06:48,635
Love is everything.

618
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:50,769
Love is everything.
Just remember that.

619
01:06:50,979 --> 01:06:53,766
- Go.
- I love you girls.

620
01:06:53,982 --> 01:06:57,019
Remember the Alamo.
Remember Smokey Joe.

621
01:07:40,028 --> 01:07:44,524
Take me home, please. I want to go home.
I want to see my mother, my mom.

622
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:49,445
I want to go. I want to see my mother.
I want my mom.

623
01:07:49,663 --> 01:07:53,910
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell
you I was gonna go out all night?

624
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:55,621
Didn't I?

625
01:07:56,753 --> 01:08:00,205
I told you I was going out all night,
I was gonna be with somebody, didn't I?

626
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:02,463
And you said okay, right?

627
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:06,962
You said you're gonna be a man
and i'm gonna be a man, right?

628
01:08:12,686 --> 01:08:14,228
No, don't do that!

629
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:21,404
- Didn't I say to you...
- I want to go.

630
01:08:21,486 --> 01:08:25,864
Didn't I say to you, didn't I
say to you that I was going...

631
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:29,609
Wait a minute now. Didn't I say
I was going out with somebody?

632
01:08:29,828 --> 01:08:32,319
Didn't I say I was gonna go find somebody?

633
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:36,614
I want to go.
I want to see my mother.

634
01:08:38,295 --> 01:08:41,130
I want to go home.
I want to go.

635
01:08:48,597 --> 01:08:51,882
- Get out. Where is your house?
- Right over there.

636
01:08:55,938 --> 01:08:59,520
Albie, I just want to say i'm
sorry the vacation didn't work out.

637
01:09:08,951 --> 01:09:10,279
Mom!

638
01:09:26,176 --> 01:09:30,126
Albie, what happened to yourself?
Come on, what happened?

639
01:09:30,722 --> 01:09:33,723
What happened, son. Did he do
this to you? What happened?

640
01:09:34,977 --> 01:09:36,685
What did he do to you?

641
01:09:54,162 --> 01:09:55,740
I'm Robert Harmon.

642
01:10:00,043 --> 01:10:02,451
Eddie, stop!
Stop it, Eddie!

643
01:10:09,094 --> 01:10:11,585
It's not your son, Eddie!

644
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,547
Your ass long enough...
Stay there!

645
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:21,810
Dad, I love you dad.

646
01:10:24,818 --> 01:10:26,229
I love you, dad.

647
01:10:26,445 --> 01:10:27,773
Come on.

648
01:10:33,035 --> 01:10:36,154
I love him.
He's my father, I love him.

649
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:41,750
Dad, I love you.

650
01:10:42,336 --> 01:10:43,878
I love you, dad.

651
01:11:37,391 --> 01:11:40,226
- He's your son, Robert.
- Too late.

652
01:11:42,104 --> 01:11:43,681
Robert, he's your son!

653
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:05,583
Here we are, pal. 28 dollars.

654
01:12:30,944 --> 01:12:31,975
G'night.

655
01:15:57,389 --> 01:15:58,931
Susan called.

656
01:15:59,433 --> 01:16:00,892
She called me?

657
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,886
That's your girlfriend, isn't it?

658
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:32,084
Uh, Robert Harmon here.

659
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:36,213
Yeah. You are Margarita.
You're the mother.

660
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:41,139
Well listen, i'm the guy that
got sick all over your house.

661
01:16:41,936 --> 01:16:45,850
I thought i'd come over and have
a drink with you and thank you.

662
01:16:48,527 --> 01:16:49,725
Don't argue with me.

663
01:16:49,944 --> 01:16:52,981
I won't take no for an answer.
Be there in 20 minutes.

664
01:16:57,452 --> 01:16:59,327
Fought with Albie, huh?

665
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:04,870
Yeah, well, life is a series
of suicides, divorces,

666
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:07,957
promises broken, children smashed,
whatever.

667
01:17:10,925 --> 01:17:12,040
You oughta go to sleep.

668
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:15,962
I'm not sleepy.
It's only about 9 o'clock.

669
01:17:22,312 --> 01:17:27,188
You look awful. Gotta get some rest, gotta
go out and get some sun, this is California.

670
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:33,361
Ya know, with kids I don't think
you can do the right thing.

671
01:17:33,574 --> 01:17:37,654
I mean, you always think you know
just what's suppose to be, and...

672
01:17:38,622 --> 01:17:41,706
You know what my shrink told me?
You know what this quack...

673
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:43,244
Watch your feet here.

674
01:17:43,459 --> 01:17:45,701
You know the guy in Chicago.

675
01:17:46,463 --> 01:17:49,748
He told me, his big advice
was to go to Europe,

676
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:53,667
to find some handsome guy,
to have a love affair,

677
01:17:53,887 --> 01:17:57,222
if that didn't work, I was
suppose to be creative, paint.

678
01:17:57,474 --> 01:17:59,550
Can we walk and talk?

679
01:18:03,022 --> 01:18:04,979
Hey, I don't want to go to bed.

680
01:18:05,857 --> 01:18:07,353
No more emotion now, let's go.

681
01:18:07,568 --> 01:18:11,269
I'm not being emotional.
I just, i'm tired.

682
01:18:12,949 --> 01:18:15,985
Oh, I wanna go-you're right.
I'm going to bed.

683
01:18:17,162 --> 01:18:18,705
Very tired.

684
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:55,733
Get out of here.

685
01:19:04,837 --> 01:19:08,586
I have to go. I have to see
this old lady about a house.

686
01:19:08,798 --> 01:19:11,717
And I have to have a drink with her,
and I have to change my clothes,

687
01:19:11,928 --> 01:19:15,261
and I have to take a shower, and I
have to be really neat, okay?

688
01:19:18,351 --> 01:19:20,640
I'll have breakfast with
you in the morning.

689
01:19:26,576 --> 01:19:27,785
I'm gonna turn off the light.

690
01:20:40,153 --> 01:20:42,110
What's all this, what are you doing?

691
01:20:42,322 --> 01:20:46,071
I need some crystal glasses,

692
01:20:46,535 --> 01:20:48,112
and some ice, and...

693
01:20:51,624 --> 01:20:54,115
- I've got everything.
- You do?

694
01:20:56,044 --> 01:20:57,208
Come on in.

695
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:48,619
Sarah.
Sarah, I need you.

696
01:22:49,372 --> 01:22:51,781
I know this doesn't
make any sense, but

697
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:54,961
this house is very,
very empty without you.

698
01:22:55,546 --> 01:22:57,871
I love you, you dumbo-head.

699
01:22:58,591 --> 01:23:02,090
We're divorced, Sarah.
That part of our life is over.

700
01:23:02,303 --> 01:23:03,880
I'm just saying that it's...

701
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:07,633
it's hard to...
tough to bring up a kid.

702
01:23:08,601 --> 01:23:11,887
I know it doesn't make any sense,
but that's what you should be doing.

703
01:23:17,486 --> 01:23:19,063
Goodbye, Sarah.

704
01:23:50,062 --> 01:23:54,806
I want you to be patient with me because
I don't know exactly where i'm going yet.

705
01:24:07,497 --> 01:24:08,825
How are you?

706
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,871
To tell you the truth, i'm...

707
01:24:25,849 --> 01:24:28,471
Tell you the truth i'm very
concerned about my daughter.

708
01:24:28,935 --> 01:24:30,680
Well, we're all concerned.

709
01:24:31,731 --> 01:24:33,688
Oh god, you too?

710
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:35,691
Oh, i'm sorry, well...

711
01:24:36,485 --> 01:24:38,110
You know all about
it too then, huh?

712
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:39,649
About it?

713
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,696
About the balance, and...

714
01:24:46,162 --> 01:24:49,247
Tell you the truth,
this is my first time, and I...

715
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:51,824
i'm looking for the sex.

716
01:24:52,044 --> 01:24:54,166
Well, you'll need bowling shoes.

717
01:24:54,379 --> 01:24:56,123
Oh thanks, I don't use 'em.

718
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:58,291
Well, you're on lane 13, mam.

719
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,529
Hey, honey.

720
01:25:24,245 --> 01:25:27,695
- You're gonna slip all over the place.
- Don't worry about it.

721
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,908
You want me to keep score?

722
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:33,576
You can if you want to, but it
isn't necessary. I don't keep score.

723
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:35,207
You don't keep score?

724
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,996
If I bowl a strike, I remember it.

725
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:41,634
Alright, give me one.
Give me one, come on.

726
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:44,882
Right down the middle.

727
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,300
Watch this.

728
01:25:50,647 --> 01:25:54,431
You're better than Al!
You're better than Al! He's a bum.

729
01:25:55,527 --> 01:26:00,023
My first husband-i mean, my only husband-
anyway, he loved to bowl.

730
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,571
Okay, lets see two in a row.
Five dollars, Al.

731
01:26:08,374 --> 01:26:10,166
Two in a row, okay?

732
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:12,250
Okay. Brace yourselves.

733
01:26:12,462 --> 01:26:15,297
She's doing better than you, Dottie,
i'll tell you that right now.

734
01:26:20,429 --> 01:26:21,971
Don't wait, honey.

735
01:26:23,347 --> 01:26:26,764
Don't wait. Just roll the ball,
ya gotta have a follow-through.

736
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:49,200
Just relax, just relax. What, Ken?

737
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:51,744
Let me tell you something, look.

738
01:26:53,797 --> 01:26:57,000
Let me tell ya. If you stand up...
Now wait a second.

739
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:00,668
If you stand up, I got the ball right here.
You got no pressure, right.

740
01:27:05,141 --> 01:27:07,099
No, wait a second now.

741
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:08,599
Now go ahead.

742
01:27:09,522 --> 01:27:11,811
Just relax, okay. Take a deep breath.

743
01:27:12,025 --> 01:27:15,607
Put the chalk, put the chalk on there.
Now watch this. Watch.

744
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:17,196
Pull it out.

745
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:19,193
It's alright.

746
01:27:21,118 --> 01:27:23,075
- There you go.
- It was easy.

747
01:27:24,663 --> 01:27:26,406
Isn't that crazy.

748
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,409
It doesn't hurt or anything.

749
01:27:30,794 --> 01:27:31,909
Thank you.

750
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:37,795
- That certainly never happened.
- I'm gonna put it back.

751
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:42,258
No, i'm not afraid.
I've got another one coming.

752
01:28:41,285 --> 01:28:42,910
Do you walk?

753
01:29:19,409 --> 01:29:22,030
You're a good dancer, you walk?

754
01:29:23,622 --> 01:29:26,029
I walk, I run, I do everything.

755
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:28,787
Okay you walk with me, ready?

756
01:29:39,597 --> 01:29:43,048
You dance by yourself,
let me see your stuff.

757
01:30:00,619 --> 01:30:03,655
I haven't done this for a long time.

758
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:20,763
Let's sit down like
ladies and gentlemen here.

759
01:30:21,683 --> 01:30:25,301
Let's sit down here like
ladies and gentlemen. Hold on.

760
01:30:25,562 --> 01:30:26,972
Let me seat you.

761
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,984
I'm sorry.

762
01:30:33,362 --> 01:30:35,852
Don't get embarrassed...

763
01:30:36,073 --> 01:30:37,402
asses.

764
01:30:44,915 --> 01:30:48,450
A beautiful light,
and a beautiful red dress.

765
01:30:48,878 --> 01:30:51,286
Honey, you're late

766
01:30:52,506 --> 01:30:57,086
Hello Frank, how are you?
Oh we were having such a party.

767
01:30:57,304 --> 01:31:00,839
I'm sorry you came in so late.
Come on over and meet Robert.

768
01:31:01,308 --> 01:31:03,715
We were having such a good time.

769
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:08,354
You asleep?

770
01:31:09,275 --> 01:31:10,685
Are you okay?

771
01:31:13,237 --> 01:31:14,815
Ya wanna glass of milk?

772
01:31:15,031 --> 01:31:17,107
Tomorrow morning.

773
01:31:17,658 --> 01:31:19,283
Give me a kiss.

774
01:31:19,911 --> 01:31:21,619
Go back to sleep.

775
01:31:34,509 --> 01:31:37,546
Honey, don't worry.
Billy is alright.

776
01:31:37,763 --> 01:31:41,049
We were having such a good time.

777
01:31:41,266 --> 01:31:44,184
I was showing Robert
how I used to dance,

778
01:31:44,395 --> 01:31:47,515
but I couldn't make up
a good enough costume.

779
01:31:47,732 --> 01:31:49,523
Mom, go to bed now, okay?

780
01:31:50,401 --> 01:31:51,943
You go home, okay?

781
01:31:52,487 --> 01:31:53,861
Party's over alright.

782
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,646
I gotta get up early tomorrow, that's why.

783
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,357
Goodnight, darling.

784
01:32:01,705 --> 01:32:03,946
She's a wonderful woman.

785
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:08,202
She doesn't get a chance to go out
and show off a lot, you know.

786
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,748
I know.

787
01:32:22,184 --> 01:32:24,510
Goodnight, teeth. I love you.
Goodnight.

788
01:32:42,499 --> 01:32:45,949
I had a wonderful time.
A wonderful time.

789
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,124
Thank you.

790
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:53,425
You are the cutest guy I ever met.

791
01:33:42,477 --> 01:33:43,758
You want some coffee?

792
01:33:43,979 --> 01:33:45,557
Nah, no thanks, babe.

793
01:33:57,076 --> 01:33:59,235
I had the most wonderful time tonight.

794
01:33:59,454 --> 01:34:01,446
Yeah, you look happy.

795
01:34:04,792 --> 01:34:07,000
What is creativity, Robert?

796
01:34:07,838 --> 01:34:09,332
What is creativity?

797
01:34:09,547 --> 01:34:13,415
No, I don't mean, you know, I know
you're a writer and you're creative.

798
01:34:15,262 --> 01:34:16,840
People paint.

799
01:34:18,057 --> 01:34:19,635
But I don't paint.

800
01:34:23,104 --> 01:34:27,646
Would you consider cooking...
an art?

801
01:34:28,485 --> 01:34:29,646
Cooking?

802
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,941
Yeah. I'm trying to find something.

803
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:37,904
You know, just something I could do.

804
01:34:38,537 --> 01:34:42,950
I don't mean i'm the only person in the
world that can do it, you know, but just...

805
01:34:43,167 --> 01:34:46,286
something that I could-something special.

806
01:34:46,503 --> 01:34:48,496
You know like cooking, or...

807
01:34:48,714 --> 01:34:52,166
Writing? You could do some poetry.
Write poetry.

808
01:34:52,551 --> 01:34:55,718
No. Poetry, I love it,
but it's just so depressing.

809
01:34:55,972 --> 01:35:00,101
I always get so low.
No, I don't think that's healthy.

810
01:35:05,148 --> 01:35:07,521
I don't even know what i'm talking about.

811
01:35:12,614 --> 01:35:14,822
Would love be considered an art?

812
01:35:16,827 --> 01:35:18,536
Well, some people think so.

813
01:35:18,745 --> 01:35:22,909
You're a writer, you're always
writing those books about sex.

814
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:27,379
Maybe you could write one about love,
I could help you with that.

815
01:35:28,798 --> 01:35:30,791
We'll see how that works out.

816
01:35:31,801 --> 01:35:33,130
I love you.

817
01:35:33,971 --> 01:35:35,596
I love you.

818
01:35:38,391 --> 01:35:41,726
I'm going to do this damned thing,
I really am.

819
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:44,352
I'm going to find balance.

820
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:47,942
And I think you should do it too.

821
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:52,230
I'm going to do something for you.

822
01:35:54,785 --> 01:35:56,528
I'm going to buy you a baby.

823
01:35:58,871 --> 01:36:00,282
Really.

824
01:36:00,873 --> 01:36:02,616
You really need some...

825
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:05,505
living thing that you can love, Robert.

826
01:36:05,712 --> 01:36:09,960
It could be just a little animal that you
could take care of and kiss and sleep with.

827
01:36:10,175 --> 01:36:11,586
Please don't.

828
01:36:12,385 --> 01:36:14,758
And you'd be balanced,
i'd be balanced.

829
01:36:20,061 --> 01:36:23,644
Then I can go back to being
obsessive about my family.

830
01:36:32,365 --> 01:36:33,860
You know what dad always said?

831
01:36:34,076 --> 01:36:36,115
No, what did dad always say?

832
01:36:37,746 --> 01:36:41,162
For every problem, there is an answer.

833
01:36:44,586 --> 01:36:46,959
I'm not gonna have coffee,
i'm gonna take a bath.

834
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:48,583
I'm gonna go right to bed.

835
01:36:48,799 --> 01:36:50,673
I'm gonna get up at dawn.

836
01:36:52,469 --> 01:36:53,668
Goodnight, honey.

837
01:37:27,006 --> 01:37:28,085
Mother?

838
01:37:29,926 --> 01:37:30,958
Are you alright?

839
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:34,008
How can you ask me if i'm alright?

840
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:38,095
Did you find your sex, mom?
Is that what you were looking for?

841
01:37:38,644 --> 01:37:40,517
Ask your father to come to the phone.

842
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:43,522
It's making me ill what
you're doing to dad.

843
01:37:43,732 --> 01:37:45,392
You wanted the divorce.

844
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:48,308
Please call your father to the phone.

845
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:51,438
- He's asleep.
- Wake him up.

846
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:55,785
You think i'm afraid to call him.
Mother please leave him alone.

847
01:37:56,912 --> 01:38:00,116
Listen to me. You do what I tell you,
and you do it right now.

848
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:01,626
Call your father to this phone.

849
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:05,292
Alright, alright. Fine, I will.
Just hold on.

850
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:26,477
You have no mercy.

851
01:38:27,653 --> 01:38:29,647
Alright, that's fine with me.

852
01:38:31,241 --> 01:38:34,407
But you leave our kid out of this.

853
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:38,657
This is our biggest and
it is our only problem.

854
01:38:38,874 --> 01:38:43,085
Hey, i'm 13. I'm not a child, honey.
I know more than you do.

855
01:38:48,133 --> 01:38:51,383
Jack, would you answer one question for me?

856
01:38:53,972 --> 01:38:57,722
Do you believe that love
is a continuous stream?

857
01:39:00,146 --> 01:39:03,894
Sarah, we have a little daughter
going through puberty right now.

858
01:39:04,109 --> 01:39:06,943
And she's more important
than you are right now.

859
01:39:07,154 --> 01:39:10,688
I'm not taking care of you anymore, Sarah.
We're divorced.

860
01:39:17,539 --> 01:39:20,116
Please have the grace not
to explain to my sister

861
01:39:20,117 --> 01:39:22,332
what a divorce is. And
stop lecturing her!

862
01:39:23,879 --> 01:39:28,351
Well then don't call her, and leave her alone!
You're the bitch!

863
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:42,436
- You alright?
- I'm washing my face.

864
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:44,775
Love is dead.

865
01:39:45,527 --> 01:39:48,018
Love is a fantasy little girls have.

866
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:50,237
I'm tired.
I just want to be by myself.

867
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:53,865
How old is she? 13?
I mean, is she 13 years old?

868
01:39:54,078 --> 01:39:57,364
She's hit puberty for god's sakes.
That's whats happened to her!

869
01:39:57,583 --> 01:39:59,954
You know absolutely nothing about children.

870
01:40:00,167 --> 01:40:02,128
I don't intend to discuss
my daughter with you.

871
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:04,335
You have a husband, right?
What's he in?

872
01:40:04,548 --> 01:40:07,963
Is he in architecture? Architect, right?
He's just like me.

873
01:40:08,176 --> 01:40:10,298
He's a guy. He's a man.
He loves women.

874
01:40:10,512 --> 01:40:13,552
- He goes out with women. He has a good time.
- You're talking about a guy...

875
01:40:13,555 --> 01:40:18,561
i've been with for 15 years, who's put food
on the table and clothes on her back.

876
01:40:18,562 --> 01:40:22,310
We've had experiences of the heart
you couldn't even imagine.

877
01:40:22,524 --> 01:40:25,941
You're talking about a guy who
held my hand in the hospital,

878
01:40:26,154 --> 01:40:29,772
who cried when his baby was born.
Where were you?

879
01:41:36,144 --> 01:41:38,895
Sarah, what are all these
flowers doing here?

880
01:41:39,105 --> 01:41:42,474
This looks like somebody died
and went to a wake.

881
01:41:44,194 --> 01:41:46,731
Those flowers are from the garden, dummy.

882
01:41:46,988 --> 01:41:48,698
I told you I was going to get you a baby.

883
01:41:48,866 --> 01:41:53,029
And i'm over here at animal shelter-
Kiners something-getting you one.

884
01:41:53,246 --> 01:41:55,783
I'm gonna change your
life around a little bit.

885
01:41:59,626 --> 01:42:01,086
You don't like me now, but

886
01:42:01,191 --> 01:42:05,792
when I get home with what i'm gonna get
home with, you're gonna be crazy about me.

887
01:42:07,677 --> 01:42:09,337
Was that your husband?

888
01:42:10,637 --> 01:42:11,967
Your fiance?

889
01:42:14,726 --> 01:42:17,893
Well I must say i'm very curious
as to know who it was.

890
01:42:18,521 --> 01:42:21,273
That was my closest and my dearest friend.

891
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:25,065
And he doesn't want me to buy a baby.

892
01:42:26,113 --> 01:42:29,150
- What does he want you to do?
- Oh, I don't know.

893
01:42:29,992 --> 01:42:33,491
Actually, we're both pretty screwed up.

894
01:42:34,413 --> 01:42:37,083
But I really think he's
in more trouble than I am.

895
01:42:37,626 --> 01:42:39,499
Is he a tall man or a short man?

896
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:44,251
Listen, I better get going. How much
do I owe you for that telephone call?

897
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:46,335
I have some bunny rabbits.

898
01:42:46,552 --> 01:42:50,549
I have a crow. A parrot.
I have a parakeet.

899
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:52,887
A parakeet is a wonderful pet for a man.

900
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:53,965
No thank you.

901
01:42:54,643 --> 01:42:59,803
Now, you ask, I do have the one billy goat,
which you can see he's a very handsome fellow.

902
01:43:00,566 --> 01:43:02,227
Then i've got the nanny goat,

903
01:43:02,443 --> 01:43:05,647
You like goat cheese, perfect opportunity.

904
01:43:05,864 --> 01:43:08,485
Then i've got these two ducks.

905
01:43:09,159 --> 01:43:12,159
- Sweet. And i've got the mallard over there.
- He's a handsome rooster.

906
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:15,574
The rooster-wake you up every morning,
keep you company.

907
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:19,835
I was thinking maybe,

908
01:43:20,045 --> 01:43:22,963
do you have any kittens, or dogs?

909
01:43:24,091 --> 01:43:26,214
I do have one dog.

910
01:43:28,179 --> 01:43:31,298
That's Lenny and that's Jim.
They are inseparable.

911
01:43:31,515 --> 01:43:33,804
They don't get much work done,
but they are the best of friends.

912
01:43:34,018 --> 01:43:36,010
And they seem to understand each other.

913
01:43:36,605 --> 01:43:40,982
No, that's a nasty dog.
I don't like that dog at all.

914
01:43:41,735 --> 01:43:44,023
Well, to look at him there isn't
too much in his favor.

915
01:43:44,236 --> 01:43:45,732
No, there really isn't.

916
01:43:45,947 --> 01:43:47,905
But he is a great dog for a man.

917
01:43:48,117 --> 01:43:50,654
No, thank you.
No on that dog.

918
01:43:50,869 --> 01:43:52,363
He is so much like a man.

919
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:58,241
And you admire, and you praise,
and the dog opens up,

920
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:02,708
And he's a warm, wonderful
and fine human being.

921
01:44:02,965 --> 01:44:05,172
You are so strong!

922
01:44:05,884 --> 01:44:07,165
Go ahead and try.

923
01:44:08,221 --> 01:44:11,008
No, he doesn't know me.
Maybe I shouldn't.

924
01:44:11,224 --> 01:44:15,352
Jim knows Mrs. Lawson loves him,
don't you Jim?

925
01:44:15,562 --> 01:44:17,804
Come on, just give it a shot.

926
01:44:18,523 --> 01:44:20,018
Don't be afraid.

927
01:44:21,235 --> 01:44:22,515
Hello, Jim.

928
01:44:23,404 --> 01:44:25,277
I'm Mrs. Lawson.

929
01:44:27,282 --> 01:44:29,441
Try again.
Just try slowly.

930
01:44:30,744 --> 01:44:32,155
Don't be afraid.

931
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:41,829
You don't want to scare me.

932
01:44:42,047 --> 01:44:45,215
You're so much bigger,
and you're so strong.

933
01:44:45,885 --> 01:44:47,712
And you're very handsome.

934
01:44:47,929 --> 01:44:51,015
You're very handsome.
You look just like somebody that I know.

935
01:44:51,224 --> 01:44:55,270
Yes you do.
Oh, look at that. Look at that.

936
01:44:57,898 --> 01:45:01,350
Oh, is that a good dog. Look at that.
Oh, good boy...

937
01:45:02,527 --> 01:45:05,482
He's terrific.
He's a wonderful dog.

938
01:45:05,697 --> 01:45:08,615
A wonderful dog, yes you are.
Yes you are.

939
01:45:08,826 --> 01:45:11,780
You look just like somebody I know,
yeah you do.

940
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:13,575
He is terrific.

941
01:45:13,789 --> 01:45:17,373
That's, i'm gonna take him.
That's won-I want to take him.

942
01:45:17,585 --> 01:45:20,372
And we've got the parakeet.
You know what I need now,

943
01:45:20,589 --> 01:45:24,207
a little something soft,
little and soft.

944
01:45:24,426 --> 01:45:25,505
Little and soft?

945
01:45:26,762 --> 01:45:28,256
Goodbye, Jim. Goodbye, Jim.

946
01:45:28,472 --> 01:45:31,592
Oh, this is terrific. This is just great.

947
01:45:32,685 --> 01:45:35,306
That's it now. Here we are home.

948
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,318
Wait a minute,
can you take this one?

949
01:45:42,529 --> 01:45:44,153
There you are, and this one.

950
01:45:44,364 --> 01:45:46,449
And then the-i'll get the-
Have you got the leash?

951
01:45:46,616 --> 01:45:49,108
I got it, I got it. Come on Rex.

952
01:45:51,497 --> 01:45:53,120
That's a wild one you got there.

953
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:55,325
You come on a little easier.

954
01:45:55,543 --> 01:45:58,793
Here we are.
Come on, we come home now.

955
01:46:02,091 --> 01:46:05,294
Okay, now I want to show him the horses.

956
01:46:05,719 --> 01:46:07,547
The chickens in the...

957
01:46:07,763 --> 01:46:09,389
Alright, can you hold the goat?

958
01:46:09,598 --> 01:46:12,636
No, i'll hold the goat,
and then you've got those still.

959
01:46:13,145 --> 01:46:16,763
What do you think, huh? Is this nice?
Is this a nice place to live?

960
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:20,985
Oh, you're such good boys, yeah.

961
01:46:22,112 --> 01:46:23,689
Alright, where's the duck now?

962
01:46:23,905 --> 01:46:25,448
The duck I don't know.

963
01:46:25,907 --> 01:46:27,734
Wait a minute.

964
01:46:28,911 --> 01:46:32,445
You take that, i'll take-here,
I got the chickens.

965
01:46:32,664 --> 01:46:35,416
Can you still get the
duck or shall I take...

966
01:46:35,918 --> 01:46:37,792
I'll have to come back for the duck.

967
01:46:38,004 --> 01:46:41,088
What do you think?
You like it.

968
01:46:43,718 --> 01:46:45,593
Are you good boys.

969
01:46:45,803 --> 01:46:48,129
Come on, let's go see Robert.

970
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:55,429
I know this sounds crazy,
but I just got carried away.

971
01:46:55,647 --> 01:46:58,317
I couldn't resist these...

972
01:46:58,566 --> 01:47:03,146
These are miniature horses.
Aren't they small? Aren't they?

973
01:47:03,364 --> 01:47:07,148
I was gonna only take one,
but then I figured they'd get lonely

974
01:47:07,368 --> 01:47:10,820
and if you have one,
you might as well have two.

975
01:47:12,706 --> 01:47:17,250
Anyway, the goat gives milk,
so that's not a waste.

976
01:47:17,462 --> 01:47:22,089
And the chickens and the duck
will have eggs eventually.

977
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:26,630
And we can eat those and we'll
all live here at the park.

978
01:47:30,016 --> 01:47:31,180
Well, we'll talk about it in a minute.

979
01:47:31,394 --> 01:47:35,438
I'm gonna take these in and give
them a little food and some water.

980
01:47:35,648 --> 01:47:38,353
It was really hot coming over.

981
01:47:43,823 --> 01:47:45,732
It's going to be alright, Robert.

982
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:50,153
I'll talk in just a minute, okay.

983
01:48:09,766 --> 01:48:12,602
- Have you got him?
- Yeah, I need a little hand with this one.

984
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:17,932
We're gonna stick you in the nice park.

985
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:26,989
Oh, you're gonna like this, you're gonna
like this, right in the shade.

986
01:48:38,172 --> 01:48:41,339
We're gonna give you nice, fresh water.

987
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,968
Have you got the chickens?

988
01:48:44,178 --> 01:48:45,838
Where's the duck?

989
01:48:47,349 --> 01:48:50,219
Come on, boys. Come on.
Over here.

990
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:56,649
There you go.

991
01:48:58,652 --> 01:49:00,480
Come on, chick-chick.
Come on, chickies.

992
01:49:00,822 --> 01:49:03,194
Come on, out you go.

993
01:49:04,866 --> 01:49:06,148
Can you get 'em?

994
01:49:15,169 --> 01:49:17,043
Come on, you little rascal.

995
01:49:25,889 --> 01:49:27,633
I don't know.

996
01:49:28,474 --> 01:49:31,012
I don't know if this
is such a hot idea?

997
01:49:32,604 --> 01:49:36,733
He didn't seem too
enthusiastic about my park.

998
01:49:38,694 --> 01:49:41,779
I'm sure he thinks i'm crazy as a bed-bug.

999
01:49:43,782 --> 01:49:45,278
What do you think?

1000
01:49:48,954 --> 01:49:53,664
I'm gonna get these little guys some water,
cool 'em off a little bit.

1001
01:49:59,883 --> 01:50:01,507
It's a plenty hot day.

1002
01:50:12,563 --> 01:50:16,182
Come on, oh i'm gonna show you
something nice, come on.

1003
01:50:20,197 --> 01:50:22,866
I'm gonna show you something
you haven't seen.

1004
01:50:23,075 --> 01:50:25,399
Gonna take you up to the high country.

1005
01:50:30,289 --> 01:50:33,076
You are such strong guys.

1006
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,204
So delicate.

1007
01:50:37,632 --> 01:50:41,167
Gee, I hope i'm doing the right
thing for you fellas too.

1008
01:50:44,848 --> 01:50:48,263
Okay, just run, run. Run free.

1009
01:51:21,887 --> 01:51:24,045
Come on, Jim. This is it.

1010
01:51:40,698 --> 01:51:43,735
This is Lenny and this is Jim.

1011
01:51:46,412 --> 01:51:48,571
I need a drink.

1012
01:51:49,166 --> 01:51:50,445
Excuse me.

1013
01:51:53,879 --> 01:51:55,124
I'll take him.

1014
01:52:21,366 --> 01:52:24,486
Don't give me any trouble now,
don't give me any trouble now.

1015
01:53:01,033 --> 01:53:02,408
Dr. Williams?

1016
01:53:02,618 --> 01:53:04,326
Hi, i'm Robert Harmon.

1017
01:53:04,746 --> 01:53:07,319
So tell me, who is the patient?

1018
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:13,627
Sarah had these two little
miniature horses,

1019
01:53:14,172 --> 01:53:15,250
and a goat,

1020
01:53:15,464 --> 01:53:19,332
and she didn't know that I was
going to respond so poorly

1021
01:53:19,552 --> 01:53:21,675
when she brought Lenny and Jim over,

1022
01:53:21,888 --> 01:53:25,588
so they couldn't find the duck and
the little chicks disappeared, so...

1023
01:53:26,226 --> 01:53:29,263
Excuse me, but where is she?

1024
01:53:31,231 --> 01:53:32,690
She's in here.

1025
01:54:18,029 --> 01:54:20,652
Don't be alarmed.
I'm Dr. Williams.

1026
01:54:30,085 --> 01:54:32,457
What seems to be the trouble?

1027
01:54:35,007 --> 01:54:37,130
I don't know who I am.

1028
01:54:38,802 --> 01:54:41,507
- Do you know where you are?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1029
01:54:41,764 --> 01:54:44,551
Who am I, who am I?

1030
01:54:44,767 --> 01:54:48,218
Just a minute, just a minute.
Who am I? Who am I?

1031
01:54:49,021 --> 01:54:51,513
Am I your brother?
Am I your mother?

1032
01:54:51,733 --> 01:54:54,354
Am I Jim? Who am I?

1033
01:54:54,778 --> 01:54:57,102
Could you please step outside for a moment?

1034
01:54:57,321 --> 01:54:59,281
Here, take your bag.
We don't need you, alright.

1035
01:54:59,449 --> 01:55:02,071
I'll pay you your bill.
I'm sorry, goodbye, thank you.

1036
01:55:02,369 --> 01:55:04,445
Now just go.
Here is your bag, here it is.

1037
01:55:06,666 --> 01:55:08,742
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

1038
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:10,623
Come here.

1039
01:55:13,714 --> 01:55:16,918
Mr. Harmon, I think Sarah is in trouble.

1040
01:55:17,677 --> 01:55:21,674
Her eyes are not responding the way i'd
like them to, and her neck is stiff.

1041
01:55:21,889 --> 01:55:26,967
Now, you can do what you want, but i'd like you
to get her to see somebody if it's not me.

1042
01:55:29,481 --> 01:55:31,770
She's fine... thank you.

1043
01:55:32,858 --> 01:55:35,979
You're very welcome.
I'll let myself out.

1044
01:55:53,923 --> 01:55:57,587
Sarah, you're one of the greatest
people that i've ever met in my life.

1045
01:55:58,094 --> 01:56:01,261
I fed the horses.
I fed the goat.

1046
01:56:08,521 --> 01:56:11,855
You gotta get well. You're not sick.

1047
01:56:12,859 --> 01:56:16,988
I got chicken soup on and I put okra in it,
and I know you hate okra.

1048
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:22,621
You're the best. You gotta fight it.

1049
01:56:23,245 --> 01:56:24,823
You're the best.

1050
01:56:39,054 --> 01:56:41,130
Nice hot cup of tea.

1051
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,142
Come on, try this now.

1052
01:56:48,564 --> 01:56:50,770
Nice hot cup of tea, smell it.

1053
01:57:01,786 --> 01:57:03,779
You're crazy as a bed-bug.

1054
01:57:23,767 --> 01:57:27,267
You're not gonna make me laugh,
I don't have a sense of humor.

1055
01:57:27,689 --> 01:57:29,064
We'll see.

1056
01:57:32,152 --> 01:57:34,447
This is the most ridiculous,
crazy idea i've ever heard.

1057
01:57:34,487 --> 01:57:36,776
- You're pitiful.
- That's enough.

1058
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:40,240
That is enough.
I want you to stand right there.

1059
01:57:40,744 --> 01:57:43,911
I want you to look right into my eyes.

1060
01:57:44,122 --> 01:57:47,289
You hear nothing but the sound of my voice.

1061
01:57:48,252 --> 01:57:51,337
Does my fox face mean anything to you?

1062
01:57:53,466 --> 01:57:54,248
Not funny.

1063
01:57:54,634 --> 01:57:56,543
Nevermind.

1064
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:04,806
In 30 seconds, you are going
to be laughing helplessly.

1065
01:58:06,562 --> 01:58:08,147
You don't believe, huh, you wanna bet?

1066
01:58:08,649 --> 01:58:10,273
What do you bet?

1067
01:58:10,483 --> 01:58:11,266
A dollar.

1068
01:58:11,944 --> 01:58:14,517
Oh, cheapskate. What do you bet?

1069
01:58:17,282 --> 01:58:20,782
I'm the highroller,
i'm gonna bet, i'm gonna bet...

1070
01:58:23,455 --> 01:58:26,493
Love. I'm gonna bet the ultimate, okay.

1071
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:30,829
First of all,

1072
01:58:31,506 --> 01:58:34,957
i'm going to give you a
drink of scotch and soda,

1073
01:58:35,468 --> 01:58:39,715
Want you to have a coca-cola.
Want you all to be in a very good mood.

1074
01:58:39,932 --> 01:58:43,515
But I don't care, I don't care.
I'm willing to take the chance.

1075
01:58:51,277 --> 01:58:55,144
Jack, what do you want?
Do you want mustard or ketchup?

1076
01:58:56,866 --> 01:59:01,326
Some people think that's my best joke, because
most people laugh just at the word ketchup.

1077
01:59:01,538 --> 01:59:04,658
Debbie, you open the
peanut brittle, please.

1078
01:59:04,875 --> 01:59:07,745
While I show daddy this flower.

1079
01:59:07,961 --> 01:59:10,119
And here, i'm gonna put this up here.

1080
01:59:10,338 --> 01:59:14,716
Well you don't have a lapel,
but it smells nice anyway.

1081
01:59:20,641 --> 01:59:23,428
Anyway, i'm sorry, that was a dirty trick,

1082
01:59:23,643 --> 01:59:25,602
i'm gonna do something nice for ya.

1083
01:59:25,813 --> 01:59:28,221
You want some popcorn, sweetheart?
You want some popcorn?

1084
01:59:32,154 --> 01:59:33,433
I've got the popcorn.

1085
01:59:34,072 --> 01:59:36,444
I mean, it's real popcorn on a string.

1086
01:59:45,501 --> 01:59:48,336
How about the anniversary present?

1087
01:59:48,545 --> 01:59:51,215
Would I forget our anniversary, sweetheart?

1088
01:59:51,423 --> 01:59:52,835
It's a fancy pen.

1089
01:59:57,137 --> 01:59:59,711
Debbie, you think I forgot you?
I didn't.

1090
02:00:01,309 --> 02:00:04,061
Don't think I forgot you, Debbie,
cuz I never forget you.

1091
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:06,596
And I know that the-
or at least last week,

1092
02:00:06,815 --> 02:00:08,558
it was your graduation,

1093
02:00:08,775 --> 02:00:12,855
and I know you like pearl earrings, don't you?
Come on, you like it?

1094
02:00:19,453 --> 02:00:23,320
I want to take a good look at both of you,
and I want to see what I see here.

1095
02:00:25,668 --> 02:00:27,826
I see twins, that's what I see. Twins.

1096
02:00:28,045 --> 02:00:32,921
You guys are a couple of-you really are.
A two of a pair.

1097
02:00:34,093 --> 02:00:36,050
This is for us.

1098
02:00:36,263 --> 02:00:38,635
Jack, this is for our old age.

1099
02:00:45,230 --> 02:00:47,438
Come over here and stand by daddy.

1100
02:00:47,649 --> 02:00:50,484
Over here, stand by dad.
I want to take your picture.

1101
02:00:51,028 --> 02:00:52,570
Mom, you're not funny.

1102
02:00:52,779 --> 02:00:57,193
Smile. Smile.
Hey Jack, look this way. Here you go.

1103
02:00:57,535 --> 02:00:59,658
That's it. Here we go.

1104
02:01:09,047 --> 02:01:11,454
Time is running up...

1105
02:01:15,136 --> 02:01:19,882
Are you ready? Here it goes.
Are you ready to laugh?

1106
02:01:36,284 --> 02:01:38,277
Just go inside.

1107
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:44,163
We gotta get to Sarah's bedroom.

1108
02:01:46,336 --> 02:01:48,210
Come on, duckies.

1109
02:02:53,491 --> 02:02:55,530
I got the horses in,

1110
02:02:56,117 --> 02:03:00,199
and I couldn't get the goat.
I mean, the goat is just impossible.

1111
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:04,615
You know, there are secrets women have.
A young girl...

1112
02:03:04,835 --> 02:03:08,002
And she comes up to you,
she's infatuated with you,

1113
02:03:08,215 --> 02:03:10,759
she always wants to tell you her secrets,
she volunteers them.

1114
02:03:10,884 --> 02:03:14,299
And she says: "I've done
some nude modeling",

1115
02:03:14,513 --> 02:03:19,090
you know, so the delicate balance
of that relationship won't break.

1116
02:03:21,603 --> 02:03:23,477
If you're in love with someone

1117
02:03:24,439 --> 02:03:27,476
and the woman keeps the secret,

1118
02:03:28,528 --> 02:03:31,197
doesn't give it to you,
doesn't offer it to you,

1119
02:03:31,406 --> 02:03:34,359
then that part of her
is always dead to you.

1120
02:03:38,746 --> 02:03:41,498
I'm gonna get that goat.
You alright?

1121
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,242
Oh good, you look wonderful.
You really do.

1122
02:03:46,462 --> 02:03:49,132
Wanna come out with me?
See the goat?

1123
02:04:47,736 --> 02:04:52,114
You promised me

1124
02:04:52,658 --> 02:04:57,283
that I would be the only one.

1125
02:05:11,803 --> 02:05:13,594
How I missed you.

1126
02:05:18,476 --> 02:05:19,971
Mama.

1127
02:05:26,652 --> 02:05:28,561
In love,

1128
02:05:29,863 --> 02:05:31,987
i'm not sure of...

1129
02:05:37,997 --> 02:05:39,788
of me.

1130
02:05:40,541 --> 02:05:45,203
And that, i'm not sure of...

1131
02:05:48,884 --> 02:05:50,378
of you.

1132
02:05:51,595 --> 02:05:54,133
I'm not sure of love.

1133
02:05:58,101 --> 02:06:00,390
I'm not sure of me,

1134
02:06:02,105 --> 02:06:03,565
of you.

1135
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,574
Mama.

1136
02:06:47,696 --> 02:06:49,106
Let me know.

1137
02:06:49,906 --> 02:06:51,982
No, Debbie, don't go.

1138
02:06:53,076 --> 02:06:55,069
Come back, baby.
I love you.

1139
02:06:55,996 --> 02:06:57,407
She's a killer.

1140
02:06:58,165 --> 02:07:00,537
You know she'll kill you.

1141
02:07:26,111 --> 02:07:29,611
I love that face.

1142
02:07:30,324 --> 02:07:35,449
And I will be the only one...

1143
02:07:35,664 --> 02:07:39,078
to love that face.

1144
02:07:39,793 --> 02:07:41,831
The only one.

1145
02:07:43,713 --> 02:07:46,203
You promised me.

1146
02:08:09,116 --> 02:08:13,860
So I love that face.

1147
02:08:35,976 --> 02:08:40,271
I love you...

1148
02:08:41,899 --> 02:08:42,420
both.

1149
02:09:02,213 --> 02:09:04,833
I had the most wonderful dream.

1150
02:09:07,009 --> 02:09:08,468
Where's Robert?

1151
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:46,379
Robert?

1152
02:09:59,064 --> 02:10:00,262
Are you out there?

1153
02:10:00,649 --> 02:10:04,148
I'll be right in! Don't come out here!

1154
02:10:43,945 --> 02:10:48,441
I've come to the most fantastic
new understanding with Jack.

1155
02:10:49,618 --> 02:10:53,116
I've made it up with him,
and with Debbie too.

1156
02:10:56,791 --> 02:10:59,912
Talked to him on the telephone,
or you dreamt this?

1157
02:11:04,383 --> 02:11:06,091
Look, i'm not kidding around.

1158
02:11:06,301 --> 02:11:10,797
I do not want you to go to some guy
that doesn't love you.

1159
02:11:11,014 --> 02:11:14,184
I love you. And I want you to stay here.
And I want you to stay here forever.

1160
02:11:14,352 --> 02:11:17,768
I'm taking care of the animals,
i'm taking care of everything.

1161
02:11:25,363 --> 02:11:27,771
- I'm gonna get a plane tonight.
- No.

1162
02:11:35,249 --> 02:11:36,708
I have to.

1163
02:11:42,965 --> 02:11:44,377
I have to.

1164
02:12:56,668 --> 02:12:58,542
Who the hell is that?

1165
02:13:40,632 --> 02:13:42,340
Who the fuck are you?

1166
02:14:26,721 --> 02:14:28,798
- Who are you?
- I'm Ken.

1167
02:14:37,691 --> 02:14:39,019
Hello, doggy.

1168
02:14:40,277 --> 02:14:42,353
How are ya? You're Robert?

1169
02:14:43,155 --> 02:14:45,397
- Want a drink?
- No, thank you.

1170
02:14:46,868 --> 02:14:49,156
Ken, hi, how are you?

1171
02:14:50,455 --> 02:14:51,782
Thank you for coming.

1172
02:14:51,997 --> 02:14:55,616
Could you help me upstairs.
I have a whole bunch of stuff up there.

1173
02:14:56,127 --> 02:14:57,669
I really appreciate you coming.

1174
02:14:57,879 --> 02:14:59,088
I know it's a terrible night,

1175
02:14:59,213 --> 02:15:01,788
I just have so much stuff,
I don't know what to do with it.

1176
02:15:14,063 --> 02:15:18,310
That's right. Get him.
Go upstairs. Come on with me.

1177
02:15:19,234 --> 02:15:20,646
Kill the big man.

1178
02:15:28,161 --> 02:15:30,202
Speak. Speak.

1179
02:15:30,413 --> 02:15:32,205
Get him. Get him.
Come on, Jim.

1180
02:15:37,171 --> 02:15:38,997
Get the big man. Come on.

1181
02:15:44,844 --> 02:15:46,221
Chicken shit.

1182
02:15:51,018 --> 02:15:52,643
Wanna listen to music?

1183
02:15:57,276 --> 02:15:58,899
Wanna listen to music?

1184
02:16:34,314 --> 02:16:35,975
I don't want you to go.

1185
02:16:36,733 --> 02:16:38,109
I love you.

1186
02:16:38,778 --> 02:16:40,569
You're the only one I love.

1187
02:16:41,404 --> 02:16:45,450
Don't you "shush" me. Who the hell
you think you are to "shush" me?

1188
02:16:46,828 --> 02:16:50,695
I don't want you to go.
You're gonna go out in all this rain?

1189
02:16:50,915 --> 02:16:53,406
I'm gonna stay the night with Ken, okay.

1190
02:17:44,013 --> 02:17:45,044
The trunk won't fit.

1191
02:17:45,264 --> 02:17:46,592
Leave it, just leave it.
