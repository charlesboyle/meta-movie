1
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:45,351
Ozzie. Come on in.

2
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,270
Palmer. What's up?

3
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:50,523
You know Peck and Olson.

4
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,110
Peck, yes, hiya.
Olson, by reputation.

5
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:58,489
I'm Osborne Cox.

6
00:01:58,573 --> 00:01:59,865
Yeah, hi.

7
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,451
Aren't you with...
Isn't he...

8
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:04,995
Yeah, that's right.
Have a seat.

9
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,374
Look, Oz, look.

10
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,668
There's no easy way to say this.

11
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,296
We're taking you off the Balkans desk.

12
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,466
What? Why?

13
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,719
In fact, we're moving you out
of SIGINT entirely.

14
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:24,974
Just... No discussion?
Just "You're out"?

15
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,977
Well, we're having the discussion now.

16
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:32,898
Look, Oz, this doesn't have
to be unpleasant.

17
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:36,735
Palmer, with all due respect,

18
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:40,364
what the fuck are you talking about?

19
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,533
And why is Olson here?

20
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,910
Ozzie, look...

21
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,162
What the fuck is this?

22
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:47,997
- I know it's not my work.
- Ozzie.

23
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:49,456
I'm a great fucking analyst.

24
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,833
Okay, Ozzie.

25
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:55,713
Ozzie, things have not been going well,
as you know.

26
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:58,090
You have a drinking problem.

27
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,016
I have a drinking problem?

28
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,643
This doesn't have to be unpleasant.

29
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:13,898
We found something for you in State.
It's a...

30
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:18,235
Well, it is a lower clearance level.
Yes.

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,490
But it's not...
Look, we're not terminating you.

32
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:24,909
Hmm.

33
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:27,411
This is an assault.

34
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,955
I have a drinking problem?

35
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,208
- Fuck you, Peck. You're a Mormon!
- Ozzie.

36
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:35,044
Next to you, we all have
a drinking problem!

37
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:40,466
What the fuck is this?
Whose ass didn't I kiss? Huh?

38
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,218
- Let's be honest!
- Okay...

39
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:45,346
I mean, let us be fucking honest.

40
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:49,850
This is a crucifixion!
This is political!

41
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,311
And don't tell me it's not!

42
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,648
I have a drinking problem!

43
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,454
You're home.

44
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:13,749
Honey, hang on to your hat.
I've got some news.

45
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,084
Did you pick up the cheeses?

46
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:16,335
Huh?

47
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:17,836
The cheeses?
Were they ready?

48
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:18,963
The cheeses?

49
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:21,298
I didn't realize you could
be home so early.

50
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:24,343
Yeah. I left a message for you
to stop by Arnaud's.

51
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:26,178
The Magruders and the Pfarrers
are coming this evening.

52
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:29,473
The Pfarrers...
What did Kathleen say?

53
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:31,267
What?

54
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:33,018
When you left the message?

55
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:35,354
That she would give you the message.

56
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,606
Well, I don't know,
I guess we had bigger news today.

57
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,441
My day didn't revolve around whether...

58
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:41,110
Do you mean that you didn't
pick up the cheeses?

59
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,611
Well, if I didn't get the message,

60
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:43,821
then I didn't pick up the cheeses.

61
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,572
- For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
- But, honey, hang on to your hat.

62
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,700
- What, now I have to go and pick them up?
- I have some news to...

63
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:49,618
Stay here and get dressed.

64
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:50,995
Honey, we have to talk.

65
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:55,249
Well, not now. I mean,
they're gonna be here in less than an hour.

66
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,627
Is that goat cheese?

67
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:01,422
Chèvre, yes,
that is a goat cheese.

68
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:04,425
'Cause I have a lactose reflux, and I can't...

69
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:06,135
You're lactose intolerant?

70
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:08,178
- Yeah, but I...
- Or you have acid reflux?

71
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:10,222
- They're different things.
- I know what they are.

72
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:11,598
So you misspoke.

73
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:13,475
Well, thank you for correcting me.

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,853
You should try the chèvre, Harry.
It's very good.

75
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:17,271
Yeah. I can eat goat cheese.

76
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,523
I was just telling your husband
that I have a condition

77
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,443
where I go into
anaphylactic shock when I...

78
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,695
- Harry works in the Marshals Service, Doug.
- And my throat...

79
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,697
Oh! I'm on the legislative side.

80
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:28,991
I work with Senator Hobby.

81
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,035
I was with Treasury,
dealing with Homeland Security.

82
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,369
I'm with the Marshals now.

83
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:34,913
If you want, he'll show you
his great big gun.

84
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:39,043
Very funny.
Gun's no big deal.

85
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,628
Twenty years of Marshals Service,
I never discharged my weapon.

86
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,215
That sounds like something you
should be telling your psychiatrist.

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,760
I don't have a psychiatrist.

88
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:51,221
Boy, I guess my job
is pretty undramatic.

89
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:53,432
I'm on the legislative side.

90
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:54,683
Mrs. Pfarrer, what do you do?

91
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:55,893
Do you also carry a big gun?

92
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,562
No, I write children's...

93
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:00,356
She writes children's books.

94
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,901
<i>Yeah. Oliver, The Cat
Who Lives In The Rotunda.</i>

95
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,194
- Those are wonderful!
- Thank you.

96
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,445
My nieces and nephews just love them.

97
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:07,946
Oh! Yeah, it's a beloved, beloved series.

98
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:09,490
Oh! Thank you.

99
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,283
You should see the fan mail she gets.

100
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,202
Are you sure this is goat cheese?

101
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:15,662
Why don't you let your wife tell them
about her own books, Harry?

102
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,539
- Come with me into the kitchen.
- I'm sorry. Was I dominating?

103
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:18,957
Help with the crudités.

104
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,131
God damn it. He knows, doesn't he?
These are nice floors.

105
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:29,051
- Knows what?
- About us, he knows about us.

106
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,594
- Little prick.
- Don't be such an ass.

107
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,429
He doesn't know a thing.

108
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,100
What is that, Forbo?

109
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,316
What a horse's ass.

110
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:46,068
I don't know why we see them.

111
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:47,861
Well, she's all right.

112
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:51,490
She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.

113
00:06:58,373 --> 00:06:59,456
You quit?

114
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,916
Uh-huh.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,251
Well, thank you for telling me.

116
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,585
Well, I tried to tell you this...

117
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:04,920
You tried? You tried?

118
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:06,922
And then what, aphasia kicked in?

119
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:09,007
No. Then our guests came and then...

120
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,885
- Why? For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
- I don't know.

121
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,971
I just got so tired.

122
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:15,222
You're tired?

123
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,724
Yes, of swimming against the current.

124
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,143
Uh-huh.

125
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,771
Independent thought is not valued there.

126
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:26,191
They resist it. They fight it.
The bureaucracy is...

127
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:29,236
So they gave you a pension
or severance or something?

128
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:33,073
I didn't retire. I quit.
I don't want their benefits.

129
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,492
But my benefits,
they will do you, right?

130
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:37,870
They'll see you through,
is that the idea?

131
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:40,956
It's not like that's the only way
to make money.

132
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,459
Yes? Yes?
Well, what're you gonna do?

133
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:45,961
I'll do some consulting.

134
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,546
Consulting.

135
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:53,719
Yes, to help out while...
I've always wanted to write.

136
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,681
Write. Write what?

137
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:03,479
I've been thinking about writing a book.

138
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:07,524
Or, you know, a sort of memoir.

139
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:22,915
You okay there, Dad?

140
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:35,928
Dad, I left my job at the Agency.

141
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,767
I'm sorry, Dad.

142
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:51,235
Government service is not the same
as when you were in State.

143
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,946
Things are different now.

144
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:59,243
I don't know, maybe it's
the Cold War ending.

145
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:05,916
Now it seems like it's all bureaucracy
and no mission.

146
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,128
I'm writing a memoir.

147
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:16,009
I think it can be pretty explosive.

148
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,512
But I don't think you would disapprove.

149
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:21,056
I don't think you would disapprove.

150
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,849
Katie's had trouble accepting it.

151
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:26,311
But sometimes there's
a higher patriotism, Dad.

152
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,164
I know this kind of man.
We've seen this.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,418
Mrs. Cox, you cannot let this man

154
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:52,337
take advantage of you,
and he will.

155
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:53,463
He will.

156
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:55,132
Yes. This is my fear.

157
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:57,342
Though he's trying...
Well, he says

158
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:59,136
he's trying to pull
himself together but...

159
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,933
Yeah. Look, sure, I'm obliged
to tell you to try to salvage things,

160
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:07,853
and you should.
It's not unheard of

161
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:10,814
that people turn themselves around,

162
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:15,986
but you haven't broached
the possibility of divorce yet.

163
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,988
- No.
- Well, that's good.

164
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:22,284
Because first you should get his financials
before he's forewarned.

165
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:24,369
Because here is a man...

166
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:27,706
Here is a man practiced in deceit.

167
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,250
This was almost, you could say,
it's his job,

168
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:32,878
and there is no reason it's not improper.

169
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:38,508
There is no reason you shouldn't get
a picture of the household finances.

170
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:43,221
Paper files, computer files, whatever.
That's your prerogative.

171
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:46,975
You can be a spy, too, madam.

172
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:50,687
Do this, before he's put on alert.

173
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:55,317
Before the turtle can draw in
his head and his...

174
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,278
- Feet.
- Feet.

175
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,781
And hopefully everything will work out.

176
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:02,532
He will reform.

177
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:04,910
But if not...

178
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,955
forewarned is forearmed.

179
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:21,510
We were young and committed
and there was nothing we could not do.

180
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:25,931
We thought of the Agency less...

181
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,602
Um...

182
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:36,608
The principles of George Kennan,

183
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:39,695
a personal hero of mine,

184
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:45,117
like the fabled Murrow's Boys,

185
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:50,789
at a time of...

186
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,135
<i>You have reached the Cox Group.</i>

187
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:05,762
<i>We can't answer your call right...</i>

188
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:07,556
Hello?

189
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:09,391
<i>I'm looking for Dr. Cox.
Is she there?</i>

190
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:14,271
No. She isn't.
Hers is the 5719 number.

191
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:16,273
This is the Cox Group,

192
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:20,026
but you can reach her on her portable
or at her office.

193
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:22,696
<i>She's married!</i>

194
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:24,573
<i>Number four.</i>

195
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,576
<i>Has a boyfriend!</i>

196
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,910
<i>And number six.</i>

197
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,872
<i>She's pregnant!</i>

198
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,125
I should try to get a run in.

199
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:28,553
Ozzie!

200
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:44,588
<i>Let all with one accord rejoice</i>

201
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:48,925
<i>In praise of Old Nassau</i>

202
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,720
<i>In praise of Old Nassau, my boys</i>

203
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:54,764
<i>Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>

204
00:14:54,849 --> 00:15:00,937
<i>Her sons will give
while they shall live</i>

205
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:03,857
<i>Three cheers for Old Nassau!</i>

206
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:11,823
We take all the chicken fat
off your buttocks, here.

207
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:13,491
Mmm-hmm.

208
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:18,955
- And the upper arms.
- Mmm-hmm.

209
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:22,500
- And a little off your tummy.
- Yeah. Great.

210
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:25,170
Now, we do breast augmentation...

211
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,590
with a tiny incision here...

212
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,133
That marker tickles.

213
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:31,593
and here.

214
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:34,596
And what about the upper leg,
the higher inside thigh area?

215
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,556
Well, we can do liposuction there,
as well,

216
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,558
but that area will respond to exercise.

217
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,479
The buttocks and upper arms
begin to store more fat

218
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:46,983
once you get up around 40.
The body just tells it to go there,

219
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:49,778
but the thighs will respond
to toning exercises.

220
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:52,197
Yeah, I can work on my arms
till the cows come home, but...

221
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:55,617
Well, also, there are of course
genetic factors.

222
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,160
The Litzkes have always been big.

223
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,286
Well, everyone's got...

224
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,747
My mother had an ass
that could pull a bus.

225
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:02,248
Wow! Well, that's a...

226
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,333
Father's side, too.

227
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:06,169
I mean, although Dad tended to carry
his weight out in front more,

228
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:07,879
in the gut area.
Derrière, not so much.

229
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:09,005
Okay.

230
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,384
And what about the face, you know,
the window to the soul?

231
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:13,718
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

232
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:15,512
Very well put.

233
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:20,266
Well, your eyes are one
of your best features,

234
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:24,813
but we can do something
about the incipient crow's feet.

235
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:26,815
Baby crow's feet.
Little chickling's feet.

236
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,650
I mean chicks.
Chickie, chickie, chickie.

237
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:31,027
Yes, again, well put.

238
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:33,029
You have a way with words.

239
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:36,408
We make a small incision
and then pull the skin tight,

240
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:38,576
like stretching the skin over a drum.

241
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:39,703
Not too tight, though.

242
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:41,871
We don't want that "worked-on" look.

243
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:44,416
You need sufficient slack for the face
to remain expressive.

244
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,751
Yeah, I don't wanna look
like Boris Karloff.

245
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,586
So you don't want a sex change!

246
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:50,422
No, I'm all woman!

247
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:55,593
So, Linda, what we're talking about here
is four different procedures.

248
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,431
The liposuction, the rhinoplasty,

249
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:03,309
the facial tuck, which I would
strongly recommend over the chemical peel.

250
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:04,936
Yeah, I don't wanna burn anything off.

251
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:07,397
And why should you,
with that lovely skin?

252
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,816
And lastly, the breast augmentation.

253
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:14,362
Now, we can also do something
about the vaccine scar.

254
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:18,283
I don't know if you wear
sleeveless dresses much...

255
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,868
Not with these ham hocks!

256
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:23,038
Yes, well, once they're nice
and svelte, post-op,

257
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:25,749
you may change your mind about that.

258
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,084
I wanna talk about this vaccine thing.

259
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,794
I mean, can you counsel me on this?

260
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,421
I mean, is it really that unsightly?

261
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,465
I see... I mean,
a bunch of people have them.

262
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:36,051
Absolutely!
Some women don't mind it.

263
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:38,386
It's personal taste.

264
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:46,061
Chad!

265
00:17:46,937 --> 00:17:48,938
Big breath. Exhale.

266
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:51,357
Hold it.

267
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,400
Hold and release!

268
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:53,568
Chad!

269
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,862
And release.

270
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,698
Too much?

271
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,077
I just felt a straining,
a tightness in the front of my ass.

272
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,204
Well, you are pretty tight down there.

273
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:05,330
You have to...

274
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:06,623
Yes, something snapped in my ass.

275
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:08,666
<i>Chad Feldheimer to the office, please.</i>

276
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:10,293
I'm gonna check with my office.
I'll be right back,

277
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:12,796
and we're gonna work
on opening those hips.

278
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,427
I just got a batch from BeWithMeDC. Com.

279
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:21,679
Oh, no. Anything good?

280
00:18:21,764 --> 00:18:23,431
I don't know. I'm just looking.
How do I open this?

281
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,141
Click on the...
Click on the... Yeah...

282
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:26,893
Okay. Oh, my God!

283
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:28,228
Okay. Loser.

284
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:31,689
Loser. Loser.

285
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:35,276
They should call this Mr. Loser. Com.

286
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:36,569
Did you have to send in a picture?

287
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:37,862
No, only the guys do.

288
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,364
I had to fill out a verbal profile,

289
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:40,990
what turns me on, what turns me off.

290
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:44,369
I'm really looking for a guy
with a sense of humor.

291
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,621
- That guy... Wait. That guy wasn't bad.
- Him?

292
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,456
- No, before.
- Him?

293
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,625
Yeah... He might not be a loser.

294
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:51,835
How can you tell?

295
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,711
- That's a Brioni suit.
- Yeah?

296
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:55,171
Shit, yeah.

297
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:57,507
Does he look like he would have
a sense of humor?

298
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:59,801
Looks like his optometrist
has a sense of humor.

299
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:01,302
What does he do?

300
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:03,138
State Department.

301
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,807
That's cool.

302
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,560
His hair is...
What is that?

303
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:13,398
Plugs?

304
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,652
This is our cardio area,
and we have a lot of machines,

305
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:19,237
so, believe me, there's never a wait.

306
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:21,489
I mean, what you see now
is like our busiest time,

307
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:23,241
and there's like a lot of machines open.

308
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:24,367
Hey, Chad.

309
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,161
Hey, Linda.
Did you call that guy?

310
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,205
No, not yet.
Chad Feldheimer, he's one of our trainers.

311
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,624
I've been doing this Internet dating thing,
and I...

312
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:32,917
What service?

313
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,419
BeWithMeDC. Com.

314
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:36,087
- Nice.
- Have you used them?

315
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:39,716
No. Two friends did, though,
and they both got hooked up...

316
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,551
with really special guys.

317
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:43,178
That's fantastic.

318
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:45,597
<i>If you're an English speaker,
please say, "Yes"...</i>

319
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:46,723
Yes!

320
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,683
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't understand what you said.</i>

321
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,768
<i>- If you're an English speaker...
- English.</i>

322
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:52,854
<i>Would you like to speak to the
billing department or to an agent?</i>

323
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:53,980
Agent.

324
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:55,607
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't understand what you said.</i>

325
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:58,109
Agent! Agent!

326
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,029
<i>Hello.
Can I help you?</i>

327
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:03,323
Yeah, hi.
This is Linda Litzke.

328
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:04,949
Shall I give you my account number?

329
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:07,493
<i>- You keyed it in. I have it here.
- You have it up? Okay.</i>

330
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:10,288
I was told that I needed
pre-approval for these surgeries...

331
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:13,041
<i>Yes, I'm showing that this procedure
was not approved.</i>

332
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,792
Yes, it was denied.

333
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:17,754
<i>This operation is an elective procedure.
It's not covered by...</i>

334
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:21,257
No, those are four different operations.
It's very complicated.

335
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:23,384
I'm reinventing myself.
This is a whole new look,

336
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:26,554
so it's not just one thing,
but they're all approved by my doctor.

337
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:28,640
<i>Your doctor's approval
is not the issue, ma'am.</i>

338
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:30,516
<i>- But this is not... Madam.
- Our guidelines specify</i>

339
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,227
<i>that elective surgeries are...</i>

340
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,896
My job involves public interface.

341
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,814
<i>- This is not...
- I'm afraid you don't understand...</i>

342
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,650
Oh! I understand.

343
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:40,985
Put your supervisor on, please.

344
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,987
<i>Hold the line.</i>

345
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:30,118
Alan?

346
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,203
Linda?

347
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:34,163
Yeah.

348
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:42,297
<i>We've been over and over
and over this.</i>

349
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:45,216
<i>First you say you can't commit,
and then...</i>

350
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:46,843
<i>Would you come down from there?</i>

351
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:34,992
We were married when I was in my,
what, mid-20s?

352
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:36,369
A kid.

353
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:39,163
We were kids, 20s.

354
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:41,666
You think it's forever.

355
00:23:43,127 --> 00:23:46,212
You get older,
you start to feel your mortality,

356
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:48,589
and you say,
"There's no more time for dishonesty,

357
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:52,343
"for subterfuge."
You say, "I'm not that person."

358
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:53,928
The choices you make...

359
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:55,847
I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.

360
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:03,855
Frankly, I'm thinking...

361
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,862
I guess that's what
I should be thinking, too.

362
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,780
With Sandy.

363
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:14,866
Well, that's what you were just saying.

364
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,035
Absolutely, yes.

365
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,911
And you're right.
You should dump that bozo.

366
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:21,205
No question about it.
I agree.

367
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,541
So if I were divorced...

368
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:28,254
Yes, I should settle things with Sandy

369
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:30,339
- because of you and me.
- Mmm-hmm.

370
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,219
It's just, you know...

371
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:39,724
It's hard to inflict that kind of pain,
you know.

372
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:43,144
Of course, that would be easier for you.

373
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:47,398
Why's that?
I don't see that.

374
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:49,817
Well, because he's such a dope,

375
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:53,946
and Sandy is a good lady.
She's a very special lady.

376
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:56,240
She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.

377
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:58,201
That's a little...

378
00:24:58,285 --> 00:25:00,036
You and I should get things sorted.

379
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,288
I've always told you
it's more than just frivolity.

380
00:25:02,372 --> 00:25:05,041
That's right. That's understood.
You've been very straight.

381
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,376
And I think I've been loud and clear.

382
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,003
Absolutely.

383
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:12,965
Not just fun and games.

384
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:17,845
Absolutely.

385
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,450
<i>- Agent!
- I'm sorry.</i>

386
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:41,077
<i>I didn't understand what you said.</i>

387
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:42,370
Agent!

388
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:47,750
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

389
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,461
<i>Please stay on the line
for the next available agent.</i>

390
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:03,849
Ted, can I talk to you
about our Mickey Mouse HMO?

391
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,017
Uh-huh! Hang on.

392
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:06,269
This is some heavy shit.

393
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:07,645
Is that my date list?

394
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,105
No, fuck.

395
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:11,315
You know, I'm trying to reinvent myself,
and these procedures,

396
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,651
which are so incredibly not cheap...
What is that?

397
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:14,902
I can't believe this.

398
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,988
This is like intelligence shit.

399
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:18,114
I'm not comfortable with this.

400
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:19,782
- This is like...
- What is it?

401
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:21,284
I can't believe this shit I'm seeing.

402
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:22,868
- Manolo found it.
- On the floor there.

403
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:25,496
Yeah. Manolo found like this CD
just lying in a locker,

404
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:27,415
- a locker floor, ladies' locker.
- Just lying there.

405
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:29,375
I'm like,
"What, someone's music or what?"

406
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:31,377
And I come in here,
and it's these files, man.

407
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:32,670
I'm not comfortable with this.

408
00:26:32,754 --> 00:26:36,841
Talking about SIGINT
and signals and shit and...

409
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:38,050
"Signals" means "code",
you know.

410
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:39,218
It was just lying there.

411
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,597
Talking here about department heads
and their names and shit.

412
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,850
And then there's these other files
that are just, like, numbers.

413
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:51,564
Arrayed. Numbers and dates
and numbers and numbers and dates.

414
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,691
And numbers and...

415
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:57,528
I think that's the shit, man.

416
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:01,032
The raw intelligence.

417
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,742
I'm not touching this.

418
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:04,076
I want this out of here.

419
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:06,037
- Just throw it out?
- No. You can't do that.

420
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:07,913
You should put up a note
in the ladies' locker room.

421
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,498
Put up a note?

422
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,917
"Highly classified shit found?"

423
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:14,920
"Signals intelligence shit?
CIA shit?"

424
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:18,090
"Hello! Did anybody lose their secret CIA shit?"
I don't think so.

425
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,383
I don't know, you figure it out,

426
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:20,843
but I'm not comfortable with this,

427
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,179
and I want this out of Hardbodies.

428
00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:25,598
We're running a gym here. God.

429
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:30,144
Manolo, you didn't find this.

430
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:32,563
I found it on the floor there.

431
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,065
Yeah, I know, but...

432
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:35,274
Right there on the floor there.

433
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,109
Just lying there.

434
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:04,845
Harry?

435
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,055
Yeah, it's me.

436
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:29,495
Absolut Saketini, please.

437
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:30,663
Just a Tab.

438
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:32,373
But if I could get an advance
on my salary,

439
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:33,958
I could at least
get the surgery ball rolling.

440
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:36,502
Whoa! There's a payroll company,
you know.

441
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,421
They don't just advance people money.

442
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:40,339
They just don't do that.

443
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:42,383
I mean, sure, I could say,
"Yes, I authorize it",

444
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:45,010
but that's not going to mean
anything to them.

445
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:47,263
Then why do they have us
on this cockamamie health plan?

446
00:28:47,347 --> 00:28:48,806
I need those surgeries, Ted.

447
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:50,391
You're a beautiful woman.
You don't...

448
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:52,977
I have gone just about as far
as I can go with this body.

449
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:55,229
I think it's a beautiful...

450
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:57,565
It's not a phony-baloney Hollywood body.

451
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:00,818
That's right, Ted.
I would be laughed out of Hollywood.

452
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:03,112
I have very limited breasts,
a ginormous ass,

453
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:04,530
and I've got this gut
that swings back and forth

454
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:07,658
in front of me like a shopping cart
with a bent wheel.

455
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,828
You know, there's a lot of guys
that like you just the way you are.

456
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:12,538
Yeah. Losers.

457
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,001
- I don't know. I mean, am I a loser?
- Ted.

458
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:19,044
You know, I wasn't always
a manager at Hardbodies.

459
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:20,838
Let me tell you...

460
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:26,343
Let me show you something.

461
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:33,768
Is that you?

462
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:39,106
Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest.
Congregation in Chevy Chase.

463
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:42,193
- That's a good job! What happened?
- Mmm-hmm.

464
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:45,863
It's a long story.

465
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:49,408
Anyway...

466
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:53,120
in many ways, I'm a lot happier now.

467
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:55,873
My point is...

468
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,833
My point is, it's a journey.

469
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:59,877
That's my point.
I don't want to stay where I am.

470
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:01,879
I want to find someone
to share my journey.

471
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:05,216
Well, you know, sometimes,
if you don't look in your own back yard...

472
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,968
I know. That's why I started
this Internet dating.

473
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:11,430
Uh-huh. But what I'm saying is maybe,
you know, you don't have to...

474
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:14,517
Look, Ted, I know that you can't authorize
an advance on my salary,

475
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:17,561
but you could put in a request,
can't you?

476
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:20,397
It's not going to do any good, Linda.

477
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:24,235
Ted, have you ever heard of the power
of positive thinking?

478
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:35,788
Harry?

479
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:39,166
It's Monica.

480
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:41,460
Well, hello.

481
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,929
Maybe I can get a run in.

482
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:02,898
<i>- Hello?
- Oh, my God.</i>

483
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:09,113
Oh, my God.

484
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,576
Oh, my God.

485
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:15,536
Oh, my God.

486
00:31:15,662 --> 00:31:16,871
Do you know what time it is?

487
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,206
Uh-huh. So, like,
I couldn't call you

488
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,583
on your totally unsecure phone,

489
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,835
but I know who the guy is.

490
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,170
The guy?

491
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:28,299
The guy, the secret guy.

492
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:30,885
So, is he high up?

493
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,303
I don't know if he's high up.

494
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:35,139
Probably. I mean,
I got his name, not his rank.

495
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:36,974
So what's his name?

496
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,435
Osborne Cox.

497
00:31:40,687 --> 00:31:42,104
Never heard of him.

498
00:31:42,188 --> 00:31:44,023
Like you're so plugged into

499
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:45,107
the intelligence community.

500
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:46,191
I'm just saying as a layperson...

501
00:31:46,276 --> 00:31:49,612
I think the quality of the intelligence
dictates how high up he is.

502
00:31:49,696 --> 00:31:51,155
Okay. Not what we know.

503
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:52,656
I also...

504
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:55,910
Do you have any water?
I gotta hydrate.

505
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:57,244
I got tap water.

506
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,579
Are you kidding?

507
00:31:58,663 --> 00:32:00,080
How do you know who he is?

508
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:01,582
Sources.

509
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,875
What do you mean sources?

510
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:06,295
You got like Gatorade or anything besides,
like, Maryland swamp water?

511
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:07,671
Do you know how far this is from my place?

512
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:09,214
How do you know his name?

513
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,091
I got this geek friend,
Eddie Gallegos.

514
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:13,427
He does computer stuff,
hooks up people's computers

515
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,804
and programs their VCRs and shit.

516
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:19,475
So he examines the files and pulls off
the digital watermark, which tells you

517
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,976
what computer it was created on.

518
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:22,478
Fucking child's play for Eddie.

519
00:32:22,562 --> 00:32:23,646
Uh-huh.

520
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,980
And...

521
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:28,859
<i>I got his number, I got his number</i>

522
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:29,985
Oh, my God.

523
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,071
That was a bit more difficult.

524
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:33,405
Shall we give him a tinkle?

525
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,865
Oh, my God.

526
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:36,867
Why?

527
00:32:36,993 --> 00:32:40,537
'Cause he's gonna wanna know
that his shit is secure.

528
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:43,290
He's gonna be relieved.

529
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:46,835
He might even be so relieved
that he gives us a reward.

530
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,046
I would be very fucking surprised
if he did not.

531
00:32:49,172 --> 00:32:50,881
- Wow.
- Very surprised.

532
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,258
Like, you know,
the Good Samaritan tax,

533
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:56,762
which is not even a tax, really,
since it's voluntary.

534
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:14,905
<i>Hello?</i>

535
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:20,160
Osborne?
Osborne Cox?

536
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,870
<i>Yes.</i>

537
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:23,914
<i>Who is this?</i>

538
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:30,671
This...
Is this Osborne Cox?

539
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:34,174
<i>Who is this? What time is it?
Who are you?</i>

540
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:35,342
Um...

541
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:37,386
I'm a Good Samaritan.

542
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,348
I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour,

543
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,643
but I thought you might be worried.

544
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,770
<i>Worried?</i>

545
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:50,983
About the security of your shit.

546
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:59,116
What on earth are you talking about?

547
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,785
Who am I speaking to?

548
00:34:02,662 --> 00:34:06,248
Your files. Your...
The documents.

549
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:11,712
I know these documents are sensitive.

550
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:16,633
But I am perfectly willing to give
back to you your sensitive shit,

551
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:20,220
you know, at a time of your choosing.

552
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:23,140
<i>What documents are you talking about?</i>

553
00:34:24,684 --> 00:34:25,684
Osborne Cox?

554
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:27,728
<i>Yes!
Yes, this is...</i>

555
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:31,023
Hello, it's Osborne Cox.
Who the fuck are you?

556
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:33,108
<i>What documents are you talking about?</i>

557
00:34:33,193 --> 00:34:34,234
<i>Who is that?</i>

558
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,611
Okay.

559
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,200
"The bureau chief in Belgrade we all call
Slovak the Butcher.

560
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:44,536
"He had very little rapport
with his staff and his dispatches..."

561
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:47,790
Rapport.
"Very little rapport

562
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:50,250
"with his staff", fucking moron!

563
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:51,668
<i>How did you get this?</i>

564
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:53,337
Don't blow a gasket, Osborne.

565
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:55,047
<i>Who the fuck are you?
Listen to me.</i>

566
00:34:55,548 --> 00:34:57,091
We have...
It's not important where...

567
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:58,759
<i>You are in way over your fucking head!</i>

568
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,344
I don't know who the fuck you are,

569
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:02,930
but you have no idea what you're doing!

570
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:06,475
Oh! Why so uptight, Osborne Cox?

571
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,770
I'm just a Good Samaritan,
a traveler on the road...

572
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,021
Tell him we're gonna give it back.

573
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:12,773
We just thought that he would like
to maybe know,

574
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:14,942
and tell him about
that Good Samaritan tax thing...

575
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:16,693
- Who is that? Hello?
- Ozzie, what's going on?

576
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,987
You tell him he's inconveniencing us.

577
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:20,697
<i>Hello!
Who the fuck is this?</i>

578
00:35:20,782 --> 00:35:22,116
<i>Ozzie, what's going on?</i>

579
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,786
You know, this is a major
inconvenience for us,

580
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,997
and we just thought a reward...

581
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:31,666
<i>So it's money! So it's money!</i>

582
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,085
<i>You want money?
Okay. Listen to me.</i>

583
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:34,628
Well, yeah, why not?

584
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,047
<i>- Am I out of line here?
- Let me...</i>

585
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:39,341
Listen to me, you two clowns.

586
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,677
Listen to me very, very carefully.

587
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:46,056
You have no idea what you're doing,
and I warn you...

588
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:47,850
You warn us?
You warn us? You warn us?

589
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:49,601
<i>Yes. Yes. I...</i>

590
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:52,312
<i>- Let me tell you something, Mr. Intelligence.
- Yes. Let me...</i>

591
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:53,981
<i>- We warn you!
- Listen!</i>

592
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:56,150
We will call you back
with our demands!

593
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:57,317
<i>Hello? Listen to me.</i>

594
00:35:57,443 --> 00:35:58,527
Chad! Don't you...

595
00:35:58,653 --> 00:36:01,155
<i>- No, Chad. Don't play his game!
- Let me explain</i>

596
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,906
<i>- how this will work.
- Sorry.</i>

597
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,411
Jeez.
The nerve of that guy!

598
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:14,001
I am very fucking surprised
he did not give us that reward.

599
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:16,670
What on earth is going on?

600
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:21,758
Some clown, or two clowns,
have gotten a hold of my memoirs.

601
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:23,343
Your what?

602
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,470
Stolen it, or...
I don't know how...

603
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:26,597
Your what?

604
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:29,099
My memoirs, the book that I'm writing.

605
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:33,770
Well, why in God's name would anyone think
that's worth anything?

606
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,527
It doesn't sound like he's gonna play ball.

607
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:42,154
He'll play ball!

608
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,864
We just have to show him who's boss.

609
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:45,574
Well, that's...

610
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,118
He sounds very senior.

611
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:49,786
I think this is some senior guy

612
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:51,538
who has screwed the pooch, big-time.

613
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,707
Yeah, that's why we got him, you know.

614
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,918
We caught him with his thing caught
in a big, fat wringer.

615
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,628
- Yeah.
- And us in the driver's seat.

616
00:36:57,754 --> 00:36:58,795
Uh-huh!

617
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,049
This is our opportunity.
You don't get many of these.

618
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:05,219
You slip on the ice outside of, you know,
a fancy restaurant,

619
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:07,054
- or something like this happens.
- Right.

620
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:09,723
And right now this has happened.

621
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,475
Yup.

622
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,101
It sure has.

623
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:19,399
This could put a big dent
in my surgeries.

624
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:21,109
Uh-huh.

625
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:23,237
Big time.

626
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,158
Honey! Honey!

627
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:30,077
Huh?

628
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:33,580
My car is here.
I'm off, mystery man.

629
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:35,916
What is that thing?

630
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:37,668
It's top secret, baby.

631
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:39,419
How many cities?

632
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:42,756
Seattle, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Chicago.

633
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,591
Why do they always send you to Seattle?

634
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:45,717
It's not a big market.

635
00:37:45,802 --> 00:37:47,761
I don't know.
Lots of independent bookstores.

636
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:49,930
Rains all the time.
What else are people gonna do?

637
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:51,181
I can think of a couple of things.

638
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:53,267
You can think of one thing.

639
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:54,393
Where are they putting you?

640
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:55,519
Christ, it better be the Peninsula,

641
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:57,521
the money I make for them.

642
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,564
Are you gonna be okay?

643
00:37:59,649 --> 00:38:00,941
I'll be sad, but I'll be okay.

644
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:02,276
Not too sad.

645
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,694
Just the right amount.

646
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:08,365
I am crazy about you, baby.

647
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:32,139
Hey!

648
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:47,237
Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison,

649
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,407
Zoe Caldwell.
It was marvelous.

650
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,161
First time I've ever attended
the Kennedy Honors.

651
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,829
Jane Alexander is a client,

652
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:58,165
an old friend of Zoe's.

653
00:38:58,249 --> 00:38:59,583
Anyway...

654
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,670
- Connie.
- Yes, sir.

655
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:07,257
<i>Would you bring in
your copy of the Cox financials?</i>

656
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:14,097
<i>Tony sang
The Best is Yet to Come.</i>

657
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:15,265
<i>Tony Bennett.</i>

658
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:20,812
I thought I had it here on a disk.

659
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:22,189
I don't know where the disk is.

660
00:39:22,273 --> 00:39:25,525
I'm sorry, I'll have to run another
off my hard drive.

661
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,860
All right. Okay.

662
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,112
So we've drawn up the papers,

663
00:39:29,238 --> 00:39:34,201
and we are prepared to execute service
on Osborne, if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.

664
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:37,454
But since we are at the point
of no return,

665
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:40,791
I always urge my clients
in this juncture

666
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:45,045
to give it one more day of reflection.

667
00:40:16,953 --> 00:40:18,245
Harry?

668
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:21,331
It's Linda.

669
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:24,334
Well, hello.

670
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:28,046
I did the whole bodyguard thing for years.

671
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:31,007
My guy was in State,
the Secretary as a matter of fact,

672
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,343
so I did a lot of traveling.

673
00:40:33,428 --> 00:40:36,471
"Ironside has left the building."
We called him Iron Ass.

674
00:40:36,556 --> 00:40:37,681
Not to his face, of course.

675
00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:39,057
Not to his ass, either!

676
00:40:40,393 --> 00:40:41,560
He was okay.

677
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:42,727
Personal protection's a young man's game.

678
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:44,020
These are really good.
You wanna try one?

679
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:46,773
Yeah? Does that have shell food in it?

680
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:49,234
- Shell food?
- I got a sensitivity.

681
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:50,735
I go into anaphylactic shock.

682
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,738
My larynx swells up and it closes...
What the hell.

683
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:55,490
Live dangerously, huh?

684
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:57,951
Can't always wear a condom, right?

685
00:40:58,077 --> 00:40:59,828
That's right! Not always!

686
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,708
Yeah. My job now is mostly administrative.

687
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,585
Not so much PP, personal protection.

688
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:07,711
I do still carry the gun.

689
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:09,004
Oh, my God.

690
00:41:09,088 --> 00:41:11,214
No big deal.
Never discharged it

691
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,467
in 20 years of service.
Security blanket now.

692
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:15,218
I don't even think about it.
Of course...

693
00:41:15,595 --> 00:41:17,095
you're not supposed
to think about it.

694
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,848
In a situation where your man is threatened,
the training kicks in.

695
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:22,809
It's muscle memory. Just like that.
It's reflexes. It's...

696
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,811
Those are outrageous.
You wanna swap?

697
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:26,396
No way!

698
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:28,231
- Go away. Go away.
- Let me touch.

699
00:41:28,316 --> 00:41:29,483
Okay. Saki?

700
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:33,153
There was a hell of a lot
of political infighting

701
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:35,655
and petty, petty shit,
and then basically

702
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,616
the old man stepped
on Geiberger's throat.

703
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,160
This is nice.
Is this wide-plank pine?

704
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:41,995
Yeah. I guess so.

705
00:41:42,663 --> 00:41:43,705
Yeah.

706
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:46,374
Listen, Linda,
full disclosure here.

707
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:48,960
Yes, I am not wearing a wedding ring,
but I am married.

708
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:50,086
Hmm.

709
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:53,590
I took the ring off about 18 months ago
when we agreed to separate,

710
00:41:53,674 --> 00:41:55,050
we agreed to disagree.

711
00:41:55,134 --> 00:41:56,843
That's about the only thing
we ever agreed on.

712
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:00,847
Well, thanks for telling me, Harry.
I really appreciate it.

713
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:03,642
You know, full transparency is my MO.

714
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:07,521
That's not gonna go off, is it?

715
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:10,565
Well, let's get in the other room
and find out.

716
00:42:22,245 --> 00:42:23,995
That's great.
That's exciting.

717
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:25,914
Yeah. He's very,
very communicative.

718
00:42:25,998 --> 00:42:28,333
Very accessible.
He has a sense of humor,

719
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:30,418
and he agrees 100% about my surgeries.

720
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:31,545
Well...

721
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:32,754
He agrees my ass could be smaller.

722
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:34,381
I mean, not in a mean way.

723
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:36,508
It comes from a place of humor.

724
00:42:36,592 --> 00:42:41,263
That's good, but, Linda,
what do you really know about this guy?

725
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:43,390
I told you, he's in
the Treasury Department.

726
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:45,642
But, no, I mean...

727
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:48,853
You know, he could be one of these guys
that cruises the Internet.

728
00:42:48,938 --> 00:42:50,522
Yeah, so am I.

729
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,401
What's wrong with this?

730
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,152
No, you cannot wear that.

731
00:42:56,237 --> 00:42:57,445
You have to wear a suit.

732
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,739
You mean, go home and change?

733
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:01,324
Yeah!

734
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:04,619
I was gonna ride my bike.

735
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:52,375
Osborne Cox.

736
00:43:55,087 --> 00:43:58,590
And you, I take it, are Mr. Black.

737
00:43:58,674 --> 00:44:00,884
Yes, I am.

738
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,428
You have the money?

739
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:06,389
$50,000.

740
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:10,935
That's what was agreed upon,
Osborne Cox.

741
00:44:12,605 --> 00:44:16,191
All right. Let me explain
something to you, Mr. Black.

742
00:44:16,776 --> 00:44:19,277
You know who I am,
I know who you are.

743
00:44:19,362 --> 00:44:20,612
Perhaps...

744
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,075
but appearances can be deceptive.

745
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:26,701
Yeah.

746
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:31,247
What you're engaged in is blackmail.
That is a felony.

747
00:44:31,332 --> 00:44:33,083
That's for starters.

748
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:34,959
Appearances can be deceptive.

749
00:44:36,128 --> 00:44:38,797
I am a mere Good Samaritan who...

750
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:42,300
Secondly, the unauthorized dissemination

751
00:44:42,385 --> 00:44:46,763
of classified material
is a federal crime.

752
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:49,474
If you ever carried out
your proposed threat,

753
00:44:49,558 --> 00:44:55,105
you would experience such
a shit storm of consequences, my friend,

754
00:44:55,189 --> 00:44:58,483
that your empty little head
would be spinning

755
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:02,028
faster than the wheels of your
Schwinn bicycle back there.

756
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:03,613
You think that's a Schwinn.

757
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:07,784
Now give me the fucking floppy
or the CD

758
00:45:07,868 --> 00:45:10,120
or whatever the fuck it is...

759
00:45:10,204 --> 00:45:13,331
As soon as you give us the money, dickwad!

760
00:45:19,338 --> 00:45:20,505
You fuck!

761
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:21,798
Give it to me, fuck!

762
00:45:21,882 --> 00:45:25,593
- You fucker.
- I know who you are, fucker!

763
00:45:25,678 --> 00:45:27,512
You're the fucker!

764
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:33,393
- Where's the money?
- He hit me!

765
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:35,145
Where's the money?

766
00:45:35,896 --> 00:45:37,021
He didn't give it to me.

767
00:45:37,106 --> 00:45:39,190
For... Get in the car.
Get in the car.

768
00:45:48,576 --> 00:45:51,828
What are you doing? Shit!

769
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:59,919
Fuck it!
Fuck! Fucking lunatic!

770
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:03,840
You fucking morons!

771
00:46:03,924 --> 00:46:05,008
Dick!

772
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,511
- That'll give him something to think about.
- Yeah.

773
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:09,721
I knew this would happen.

774
00:46:09,805 --> 00:46:10,847
Wait. Wait!
We gotta go back!

775
00:46:10,931 --> 00:46:11,931
My bike!

776
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:13,141
It's on to Plan B.

777
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,978
That's just a Kryptonite lock.
You can open those fuckers with a Bic pen!

778
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:18,855
Some people.

779
00:46:24,487 --> 00:46:25,528
What is this?

780
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:26,696
Russian Embassy.

781
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,243
I told Mr. Krapotkin I might be stopping by.

782
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:35,121
Is there a men's room?

783
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:46,049
Madam, you are mistaken.

784
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:49,219
I am assistant cultural attaché.

785
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:52,555
The organs of state security
are not allowed to function

786
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,265
within the borders of your country.

787
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:56,726
Organs?

788
00:46:57,686 --> 00:46:58,728
Yes.

789
00:47:00,773 --> 00:47:04,567
But what if I had, say,
secrets of a highly...

790
00:47:05,277 --> 00:47:08,321
Secrets that might interest
the organs of the...

791
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,241
Yes?

792
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:18,915
That's just a taste.

793
00:47:30,803 --> 00:47:32,428
May I ask the source of this material?

794
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:33,513
No, you may not.

795
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:35,598
- He's very high up.
- Chad!

796
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:37,725
What? I'm just saying he's high up.

797
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:45,149
PC or Mac?

798
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:46,317
- PC.
- PC.

799
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:49,112
Could you wait, please?

800
00:47:49,196 --> 00:47:50,405
I do have a date.

801
00:47:55,494 --> 00:47:56,536
Hey!

802
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:04,794
The fish has bitten.

803
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:06,296
Huh?

804
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:08,840
Yeah, he seems cool.

805
00:48:11,886 --> 00:48:12,927
<i>Chad.</i>

806
00:48:21,103 --> 00:48:23,438
Could you accompany me, please?

807
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:37,827
There is more material?

808
00:48:37,912 --> 00:48:39,287
There's a lot more.

809
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:41,414
But we want to be paid first.

810
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,043
You are not ideological?

811
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:48,922
I don't think so.

812
00:48:49,006 --> 00:48:51,507
Look, I have a date, so...

813
00:48:55,471 --> 00:48:56,512
Date.

814
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:00,975
Uh-oh.

815
00:49:02,102 --> 00:49:05,021
- A line to check in, towels piling up.
- I'm sorry, Ted.

816
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:07,315
And Manolo running around like crazy.

817
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:09,150
What happened to your nose?

818
00:49:09,234 --> 00:49:10,860
This is not acceptable at Hardbodies.

819
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:12,654
You two know better than that.

820
00:49:12,738 --> 00:49:14,364
Yes, we do, Ted.
I'm really sorry.

821
00:49:14,448 --> 00:49:15,531
This is no way...

822
00:49:15,616 --> 00:49:17,992
It was unavoidable, Ted.
It won't happen again.

823
00:49:18,077 --> 00:49:19,202
But you won't tell me what's going on.

824
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:20,578
No, we can't.

825
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:23,873
I know this is really terrible, Ted,

826
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:27,377
but I have to go.
I have a date.

827
00:49:30,255 --> 00:49:34,717
You're changing, Linda.
It's very sad.

828
00:49:44,895 --> 00:49:48,314
Which, to my mind, is all the more reason
to lower the boom on Ozzie.

829
00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:49,941
Mmm-hmm.

830
00:49:50,985 --> 00:49:52,735
Is that it? "Mmm-hmm"?

831
00:49:54,154 --> 00:49:56,739
I'm wondering if it's the right time and...

832
00:49:56,824 --> 00:49:58,241
Well, of course it's the right time.

833
00:49:58,325 --> 00:50:00,159
Why wouldn't it be the right time?

834
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:02,161
- Does this threaten you?
- No.

835
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:04,080
You and me, we're rock solid.

836
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:07,500
It's just, I think that's why
we can afford to be big.

837
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:10,378
We can think about Ozzie
and whether we give him a chance to

838
00:50:10,462 --> 00:50:11,671
get himself together a little bit,

839
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:12,880
before you hammer the hell out of him.

840
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:15,633
- Is that how you see me? Hammering him?
- Of course not...

841
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:17,051
- No, but that was your word.
- Yeah.

842
00:50:17,136 --> 00:50:19,804
- I don't hammer.
- No, of course not. Listen...

843
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,597
I'm no friend of the guy,
you know that.

844
00:50:21,724 --> 00:50:23,099
I think he's an arrogant little geek.

845
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:26,644
But, you know,
we have all the time in the world,

846
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,062
and he just lost his job.

847
00:50:28,147 --> 00:50:30,023
He didn't lose it.
He quit.

848
00:50:30,107 --> 00:50:33,317
Yeah, well, most of the people
in this town who quit, were fired.

849
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:35,611
I feel sorry for him...

850
00:50:35,946 --> 00:50:40,033
and I think he'll be a lot easier to deal with
if he doesn't feel cornered.

851
00:50:43,787 --> 00:50:47,415
Maybe. Just as long as we're talking
about Ozzie here, not you.

852
00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:49,125
Of course we're talking about Ozzie.

853
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:52,754
I'll do whatever you want, baby.
I adore you.

854
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:59,177
- You get the check.
- Okay.

855
00:50:59,261 --> 00:51:03,639
Yeah. Yes.
Is there blood in his stool?

856
00:51:04,683 --> 00:51:06,142
Later. I'm running home.

857
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,813
I love you, baby.

858
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:21,949
Ozzie?

859
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:27,538
God damn it, Ozzie,
what have you done to the car?

860
00:51:30,334 --> 00:51:33,169
All right. All right.

861
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:52,271
Oh, my God, am I really late?

862
00:51:52,356 --> 00:51:55,191
No, no.
It doesn't start for five minutes.

863
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:58,152
You haven't seen this yet, have you?

864
00:51:58,278 --> 00:51:59,737
This one, no.
No, I have not.

865
00:51:59,822 --> 00:52:00,822
I hear it's terrific.

866
00:52:00,948 --> 00:52:01,989
Great.

867
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:05,785
<i>We've been over
and over and over this.</i>

868
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:08,746
<i>First you say you can't commit,
and then...</i>

869
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,289
<i>Would you come down from there?</i>

870
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:22,552
Pardon our dust, the ex
is in the process of moving out.

871
00:52:23,137 --> 00:52:25,054
I told her to expedite things, but...

872
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:26,180
Yeah.

873
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:28,099
Yeah, you know,
you try to act like an adult.

874
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:29,517
Well, it's never easy.

875
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:30,726
Hmm.

876
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,980
You wanna come downstairs?
You like surprises?

877
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:36,440
Well, I'm always open to new experiences.

878
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:39,610
I gotta tell you, I saw an ad for this
in a gentleman's magazine,

879
00:52:39,695 --> 00:52:43,614
1,200 bucks. 1,200 bucks.
I'm looking at this thing and I think,

880
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:46,409
"Jesus, you gotta be kidding me.
I'm a hobbyist.

881
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:49,412
"This thing's basically nothing
but Speed-Rail."

882
00:52:49,496 --> 00:52:51,372
I figure I'd go down to Home Depot

883
00:52:51,456 --> 00:52:53,708
and whip this up myself for 100 bucks.

884
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:57,044
What is it?

885
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,382
You sit down there,
make yourself comfortable,

886
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:05,303
put your feet in the stirrups and...

887
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:12,310
Oh, my God!

888
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:18,941
That's fantastic!

889
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:20,693
Something, isn't it?
100 bucks all in.

890
00:53:20,777 --> 00:53:23,738
Not counting my labor
and the cost of the dildo.

891
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:25,531
- Those things aren't cheap.
- Uh-huh!

892
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:28,659
See, I lack that.
I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.

893
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:34,123
- The Russians? The Russians?
- Uh-huh.

894
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:35,499
Mmm-hmm.

895
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,460
The Russian Embassy, yeah.

896
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:39,295
Are you sure?

897
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:42,506
Hey, the guy was not hard to follow,
as you know.

898
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:47,762
Why the fuck would they go to the Russians?
Why the fuck?

899
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:52,808
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Hal.

900
00:53:53,352 --> 00:53:55,269
Hey. No problemo.

901
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:01,108
Look, Ozzie, I hate to be
the paranoid old spook,

902
00:54:01,193 --> 00:54:04,070
but those two guys seem
very interested in you.

903
00:54:07,616 --> 00:54:09,951
You haven't gone poofy on me,
have you, Oz?

904
00:54:13,455 --> 00:54:14,914
Can I help you?

905
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,540
I'm sorry if I was staring,

906
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:18,251
but your face looks familiar.

907
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:20,753
It's Princeton? '73?

908
00:54:20,837 --> 00:54:21,921
Yeah.

909
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:23,339
I can't remember your name.

910
00:54:23,423 --> 00:54:24,674
Osborne Cox.

911
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,050
I thought so.

912
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:28,177
Served and witnessed.

913
00:54:29,054 --> 00:54:30,763
You have a real nice evening.

914
00:54:33,517 --> 00:54:34,558
Ouch.

915
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,157
What the fuck?

916
00:54:56,415 --> 00:54:59,834
Fuck! What the fuck?

917
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:13,889
Fuck! Fucking...

918
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:21,564
Why did you tell him
we could get more stuff?

919
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:23,232
Well, maybe we can.

920
00:55:23,317 --> 00:55:26,068
That's all Manolo found.
That was everything.

921
00:55:26,153 --> 00:55:28,321
What, are we gonna tell Manolo

922
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:30,656
to scoop some more secret spy shit
off the locker floor?

923
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:31,824
- Hey!
- What?

924
00:55:31,908 --> 00:55:34,410
I don't like the snideness,
nor the negativity.

925
00:55:35,037 --> 00:55:37,246
- I'm sorry.
- I'm just trying to work this thing.

926
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:39,165
If I'm gonna reinvent myself,
I need these surgeries,

927
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:40,374
and these surgeries cost money.

928
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,460
- And this is not just fun and games.
- I'm sorry.

929
00:55:42,544 --> 00:55:44,337
So let's figure this thing out, okay?

930
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:46,505
<i>Chad, your Berry Blast is ready.</i>

931
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:48,257
We know who he is.

932
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:49,925
Right, Osborne Cox.

933
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,511
So we can find out where he lives, right?

934
00:55:52,596 --> 00:55:53,888
I guess.

935
00:55:54,014 --> 00:55:56,557
- You should change into a suit.
- Why?

936
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:58,309
So you don't stand out
in his neighborhood.

937
00:55:58,393 --> 00:55:59,435
There are certain elemental things, Chad.

938
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:00,519
His neighborhood?

939
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:03,439
Yes. We should take out the labels
and the laundry marks.

940
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:04,899
Laundry marks?

941
00:56:05,025 --> 00:56:06,400
Deniability.

942
00:56:09,654 --> 00:56:11,280
<i>Shake it down</i>

943
00:56:15,243 --> 00:56:16,911
<i>Shakes right</i>

944
00:58:37,928 --> 00:58:39,386
What's the odometer say?

945
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:41,388
Five.

946
00:58:41,473 --> 00:58:43,599
About five or approximately five?
I mean...

947
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:45,893
For fuck's sake, Harry,
it's five miles.

948
00:58:46,144 --> 00:58:47,520
5.2.

949
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:49,772
Okay. I gotta do at least five.

950
00:58:49,856 --> 00:58:51,440
Five and a deuce is okay.

951
00:58:51,525 --> 00:58:53,484
I'm amazed you have the energy.

952
00:58:53,568 --> 00:58:55,861
You kidding? Pull around the corner
and we'll do it in the back.

953
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:57,696
You're so coarse.

954
00:58:57,781 --> 00:59:00,115
No. Back of the car,
not a rear entry situation.

955
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,618
Fuck! I'm late.

956
01:03:17,582 --> 01:03:18,999
Hello?

957
01:04:09,717 --> 01:04:12,886
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

958
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:40,998
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

959
01:04:46,504 --> 01:04:48,046
What the fuck?

960
01:04:56,055 --> 01:04:59,391
What the fuck? Nothing?

961
01:05:00,977 --> 01:05:02,060
Oh!

962
01:05:02,145 --> 01:05:07,399
Oh, my fuck.
I killed a fucking spook.

963
01:05:09,193 --> 01:05:12,946
What the fuck are you doing here,
you fucker? You...

964
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,801
Olson, what's up?

965
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,691
Palmer, what's up?

966
01:05:49,776 --> 01:05:54,196
Not quite certain, sir,
but it's messy.

967
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:57,908
Kolyma Two tells us
they have computer files

968
01:05:57,992 --> 01:06:01,203
from an ex-analyst of mine, Osborne Cox.

969
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:02,412
Kolyma Two?

970
01:06:02,497 --> 01:06:03,497
Our man in the Russian Embassy.

971
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:04,581
Hmm.

972
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:07,084
They were brought in to them by a woman...

973
01:06:07,168 --> 01:06:08,335
The Russians?

974
01:06:08,419 --> 01:06:13,590
Yeah. It was brought in
by a woman named Linda Litzke,

975
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,801
an associate of a guy
named Harry Pfarrer.

976
01:06:15,927 --> 01:06:17,928
Picture's in the file,
with Pfarrer's.

977
01:06:18,012 --> 01:06:19,429
- The Russians?
- Yeah.

978
01:06:22,016 --> 01:06:23,392
And who's Pfarrer?

979
01:06:24,644 --> 01:06:29,898
Treasury guy who has been screwing Mrs. Cox.

980
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:31,650
That must be how they got the files.

981
01:06:31,776 --> 01:06:34,111
Or maybe Ozzie knows about them.

982
01:06:34,195 --> 01:06:35,821
They all seem to be sleeping with each other.

983
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:36,989
All right. Spare me.

984
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:39,658
Yes, sir, but this Treasury guy...

985
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:44,621
it's become complicated.

986
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:50,877
He just shot somebody in Ozzie's house.

987
01:06:51,963 --> 01:06:54,172
Shot your analyst?

988
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:55,966
No, Ozzie wasn't there.

989
01:06:56,175 --> 01:06:59,261
Our man surveilling hears a gunshot,

990
01:06:59,345 --> 01:07:01,138
sees the guy wrestle something

991
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:03,640
into his car. Follows him.

992
01:07:03,725 --> 01:07:06,184
He dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay.

993
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:08,478
Well, what'd he do that for?

994
01:07:08,563 --> 01:07:09,646
Don't know, sir.

995
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:11,189
For Christ sake,
did anyone fish the body out?

996
01:07:11,274 --> 01:07:12,315
Mmm-hmm.

997
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,734
And Russian? American?

998
01:07:13,818 --> 01:07:15,485
Don't know. Scrubbed of ID.

999
01:07:17,488 --> 01:07:18,780
And this Linda...

1000
01:07:18,865 --> 01:07:20,323
Linda Litzke.

1001
01:07:20,408 --> 01:07:21,783
Yeah, she's Treasury?

1002
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:23,285
No.

1003
01:07:23,369 --> 01:07:27,205
We're fuzzy on her.

1004
01:07:28,875 --> 01:07:31,835
So we don't really know
what anyone is after.

1005
01:07:32,336 --> 01:07:33,545
Not really, sir.

1006
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:37,466
And this analyst, ex-analyst...

1007
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,092
Cox.

1008
01:07:39,177 --> 01:07:41,720
Yeah. What's his clearance level?

1009
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:43,555
Three.

1010
01:07:44,015 --> 01:07:45,849
Okay, no biggie.

1011
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,895
Just, for now, just keep an eye on everyone,
see what they do.

1012
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:54,649
Yes, sir. And we'll interface
with the FBI on this dead body.

1013
01:07:54,734 --> 01:07:57,903
No! No. God, no. We don't want those idiots
bumbling around in this.

1014
01:07:57,987 --> 01:07:59,738
Burn the body.
Get rid of it.

1015
01:07:59,822 --> 01:08:03,617
And keep an eye on everyone,
see what they do.

1016
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:06,787
Report back to me when...

1017
01:08:08,915 --> 01:08:11,374
I don't know, when it makes sense.

1018
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:16,171
<i>Go!</i>

1019
01:08:16,547 --> 01:08:19,466
<i>And tap. Up, up and tap!</i>

1020
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:20,675
<i>Up, up and tap.</i>

1021
01:08:20,843 --> 01:08:22,010
I'm bigger.
I'm bigger.

1022
01:08:22,095 --> 01:08:23,720
<i>Now let's add the arms,
right here.</i>

1023
01:08:23,846 --> 01:08:25,514
I'm bigger than ever.

1024
01:08:25,598 --> 01:08:27,432
<i>Up, up, again.
And again.</i>

1025
01:08:27,558 --> 01:08:29,434
I'm bigger. I'm back.
I'm better. I'm back.

1026
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:31,394
<i>- Than ever. I'm back.
- Let's do it again. Come on.</i>

1027
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,521
You fuckers, I'm back.

1028
01:08:32,605 --> 01:08:33,688
<i>Up, up, down, down.</i>

1029
01:08:33,773 --> 01:08:34,856
You fuckers, I'm back.

1030
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:36,024
<i>Up, up, down, down, up!</i>

1031
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:38,193
<i>And last time...</i>

1032
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,871
Linda. You okay?

1033
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:52,082
Yeah, I'm fine, Ted.
I'm sorry.

1034
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:53,667
You don't look fine.

1035
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:54,876
No, no, I'm...

1036
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:58,046
But you won't tell me what's wrong.

1037
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:00,674
You never let me in, Linda.

1038
01:09:00,758 --> 01:09:03,093
I know you're trustworthy.
I just...

1039
01:09:03,177 --> 01:09:05,637
I don't want to endanger other people.
I mean...

1040
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:09,057
This is the path that I've chosen.
It's not...

1041
01:09:09,183 --> 01:09:12,561
You have to isolate,
you know, a firewall.

1042
01:09:14,355 --> 01:09:16,982
Well, I don't know what to think.

1043
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:18,525
You both go AWOL on Friday.

1044
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:20,527
And today Chad doesn't even bother
to come in at all.

1045
01:09:20,611 --> 01:09:22,612
- I know, Ted.
- I can't run a gym this way.

1046
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:24,489
- I know, Ted.
- I'm going to have to fire him.

1047
01:09:24,574 --> 01:09:25,907
No, no, no.
Ted, just...

1048
01:09:25,992 --> 01:09:27,367
What?

1049
01:09:27,493 --> 01:09:28,910
Give me 24 hours!

1050
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,581
- To what?
- I don't know. Just give me 24 hours!

1051
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:35,417
- Linda...
- Just give me 24 hours to solve this thing.

1052
01:09:38,254 --> 01:09:40,172
Linda, I have to tell you.

1053
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:42,799
A man was in here earlier,
asking about you.

1054
01:09:42,884 --> 01:09:45,177
Are you in some kind of trouble?

1055
01:09:45,261 --> 01:09:46,887
Is Chad running away from something?

1056
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:49,306
We know what we're doing, Ted.
Let me ask you this...

1057
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,433
did he know my name?

1058
01:09:51,809 --> 01:09:53,393
Well, yes, he was asking about you.

1059
01:09:53,477 --> 01:09:55,645
Employment history, etcetera.
Real jerk.

1060
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,938
I told him to get lost.

1061
01:09:57,023 --> 01:09:58,273
Thank you, Ted.

1062
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:04,487
Well, we just don't give that out
at Hardbodies.

1063
01:10:04,572 --> 01:10:06,281
<i>Linda, a Mr. Krapotkin on line two.</i>

1064
01:10:06,365 --> 01:10:07,407
Oh, my God.

1065
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:12,370
Mr. Krapotkin?

1066
01:10:12,496 --> 01:10:13,622
<i>This Linda?</i>

1067
01:10:13,706 --> 01:10:14,748
Yes?

1068
01:10:14,832 --> 01:10:18,543
<i>Yes, this is Ilan Krapotkin,
in the Russian Embassy, returning your call.</i>

1069
01:10:18,628 --> 01:10:21,588
Yes, yes! Hang on.
I'm sorry, Ted. This is private.

1070
01:10:28,846 --> 01:10:32,182
<i>- Mr. Krapotkin? Is this a secure line?
- Yes?</i>

1071
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,727
Mr. Krapotkin?
Is this a secure...

1072
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:36,853
<i>Are you joking?</i>

1073
01:10:36,938 --> 01:10:41,900
No! I'm very worried about my associate,
you know, Chad.

1074
01:10:43,194 --> 01:10:44,653
<i>- Do you have him?
- Do we have him?</i>

1075
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:47,906
Is he... Was he...
Well, I don't know what the term is.

1076
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,157
Did he go over?

1077
01:10:49,242 --> 01:10:53,036
<i>I don't understand.
Is he not at Hardbodies?</i>

1078
01:10:53,496 --> 01:10:59,209
No. Look, could I come in
and discuss this?

1079
01:11:01,254 --> 01:11:03,213
<i>I'm very busy at the moment.</i>

1080
01:11:03,297 --> 01:11:04,839
I'm coming anyway.

1081
01:11:21,065 --> 01:11:23,108
You seem distracted.

1082
01:11:24,527 --> 01:11:26,194
Do I?

1083
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:28,488
Very distracted.
The last few days.

1084
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:32,367
Work.

1085
01:11:34,245 --> 01:11:36,079
You think that might be enough carrots?

1086
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,208
What?

1087
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:41,501
For the salad.

1088
01:11:46,173 --> 01:11:48,883
You know, you really are a negative person.

1089
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:51,386
What?

1090
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:53,263
I've tried to ignore it,

1091
01:11:53,347 --> 01:11:55,056
to remain upbeat.

1092
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:57,392
Harry, stop the foolishness.

1093
01:11:57,476 --> 01:11:59,769
- Stop the foolishness?
- Yes, and behave.

1094
01:11:59,854 --> 01:12:03,481
You are not speaking to one
of your "shithole buddies."

1095
01:12:58,704 --> 01:12:59,871
<i>Hello?</i>

1096
01:13:00,331 --> 01:13:03,249
Honey, it's so good
to hear your voice.

1097
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:04,501
<i>Is something wrong, Harry?</i>

1098
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:10,507
No. Yeah. Can you come home?
Baby needs you.

1099
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:12,342
Can you please come home?

1100
01:13:12,426 --> 01:13:15,970
<i>Harry, you know I can't
just leave the book tour.</i>

1101
01:13:16,347 --> 01:13:18,014
I can show you your present.
It's finished.

1102
01:13:18,099 --> 01:13:21,684
<i>Harry, I can't just leave.
There are two days left.</i>

1103
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:23,603
<i>There's still Seattle.</i>

1104
01:13:25,773 --> 01:13:27,148
Yeah.

1105
01:13:27,316 --> 01:13:28,733
<i>I love you, Harry.</i>

1106
01:13:29,568 --> 01:13:33,071
Yeah. I love you, too.

1107
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:42,455
Hey! Fucker!

1108
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:51,965
Fucker!

1109
01:13:58,889 --> 01:13:59,931
Fucker!

1110
01:14:00,057 --> 01:14:02,267
Who do you work for?

1111
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:04,060
Who do you work for?

1112
01:14:08,899 --> 01:14:11,359
Who are you?
Who are you?

1113
01:14:11,485 --> 01:14:13,903
Who do you work for?
CIA? NSC?

1114
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:15,905
- Tuchman Marsh!
- What?

1115
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,365
- Tuchman Marsh.
- Tuchman Marsh?

1116
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,491
Yes.

1117
01:14:18,576 --> 01:14:19,617
Your name is Tuchman Marsh?

1118
01:14:19,702 --> 01:14:21,953
Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino!

1119
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:23,746
- I work for them!
- You work for Tuchman Marsh.

1120
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:24,956
Yes!

1121
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:26,833
Is that a law firm?

1122
01:14:26,917 --> 01:14:29,210
No, a rock band.
Yes, it's a law firm.

1123
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:31,004
Well, why are you following me?

1124
01:14:31,088 --> 01:14:32,839
Divorce action, numb nuts!

1125
01:14:36,343 --> 01:14:37,385
My wife hired you?

1126
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:40,388
No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
Tuchman Marsh hired me.

1127
01:14:40,473 --> 01:14:42,474
I work for Tuchman Marsh.

1128
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:55,403
Sandy.

1129
01:14:55,946 --> 01:14:58,781
Jesus. Grow up, man.
It happens to everybody.

1130
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:06,664
"And at midnight of the third day,

1131
01:15:06,749 --> 01:15:10,251
"even the sergeant at arms fell asleep.

1132
01:15:11,795 --> 01:15:18,301
"And it was just then, at that very moment,
that Oliver sneezed."

1133
01:15:18,636 --> 01:15:19,969
Can we just...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1134
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:22,472
You have to let the folks at home
see this illustration.

1135
01:15:22,556 --> 01:15:23,932
Can we just get a shot of that?

1136
01:15:24,099 --> 01:15:25,517
There, there it is.

1137
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:27,852
It's Oliver interrupting
the filibuster with...

1138
01:15:29,104 --> 01:15:30,980
- That's wonderful.
- It's wonderful.

1139
01:15:31,065 --> 01:15:33,274
<i>The book is Point of Order Oliver!</i>

1140
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:36,694
And the talented author is Sandra Pfarrer.

1141
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:38,363
She'll stay with us for our next segment

1142
01:15:38,447 --> 01:15:40,323
when we meet the Sultan of Salad.

1143
01:15:40,407 --> 01:15:44,035
And then it's part two of our very special
interview with Dermot Mulroney.

1144
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:45,578
So keep it where it is.

1145
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:50,667
That was way out of line.
We were so unbelievably clear with them,

1146
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:52,168
- "It's just an Oliver segment."
- That's fine.

1147
01:15:52,253 --> 01:15:53,253
Del and Connie are such putzes.

1148
01:15:53,337 --> 01:15:54,337
That's fine.
Thank you, we're done.

1149
01:15:54,421 --> 01:15:55,838
Well, okay, great.

1150
01:15:56,131 --> 01:15:58,424
I thought that would never end.

1151
01:15:59,843 --> 01:16:01,302
Me, too.

1152
01:16:04,348 --> 01:16:06,641
Let me get this crap off my face.

1153
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:29,372
What the fuck?

1154
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,924
Yes, madam.
Can we help you?

1155
01:16:40,175 --> 01:16:42,719
What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy
are you running, anyway?

1156
01:16:42,803 --> 01:16:44,512
I've been waiting for 45 minutes!

1157
01:16:44,597 --> 01:16:46,431
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
An urgent matter.

1158
01:16:46,515 --> 01:16:48,433
Well, maybe this is an urgent matter,

1159
01:16:48,517 --> 01:16:51,603
since, you know,
Chad's been missing for 48 hours.

1160
01:16:51,687 --> 01:16:54,689
I do not know the whereabouts
of Mr. Chad, madam.

1161
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:58,526
He was gathering information for you
when he was taken.

1162
01:16:59,612 --> 01:17:03,865
We're not interested in such information.
It was dribble.

1163
01:17:05,284 --> 01:17:07,285
Dribble?

1164
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:09,454
Would you like your disk back, madam?

1165
01:17:09,538 --> 01:17:10,538
Dribble?

1166
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,875
I will give you dribble.
You listen to me, Mr. Krapotkin.

1167
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:15,126
I am a US citizen,

1168
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:17,378
and I will not take
this kind of treatment.

1169
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:27,472
My check was returned
for insufficient funds.

1170
01:17:27,806 --> 01:17:29,682
No. No, no, ma'am. No.

1171
01:17:29,767 --> 01:17:32,560
There're over $40,000 in that account.

1172
01:17:32,645 --> 01:17:34,562
The account is not overdrawn.

1173
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:37,398
When?

1174
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:41,653
But how could she have access with...

1175
01:17:42,488 --> 01:17:44,530
What about our savings...

1176
01:17:44,615 --> 01:17:47,241
What about my savings account?

1177
01:17:47,326 --> 01:17:48,660
Mmm-hmm.

1178
01:17:48,744 --> 01:17:54,165
No. No, I'm sorry.
I don't know the number to my savings account,

1179
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:57,502
because believe it or not,
I don't spend my entire day

1180
01:17:57,586 --> 01:18:00,838
sitting around trying to memorize
the fucking numbers

1181
01:18:00,923 --> 01:18:04,217
to my fucking bank accounts! Moron!

1182
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:21,526
No way. No, no way. Whoa!
No way, Linda. No.

1183
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:22,944
Well, I can't do it, Ted.

1184
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:24,445
I don't know anything about computers.

1185
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,822
Linda, this whole thing is crazy.

1186
01:18:25,906 --> 01:18:28,199
It was crazy the first time,
and you want to do it again?

1187
01:18:28,283 --> 01:18:31,369
Break into the man's house?

1188
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:33,663
You said the Russians
didn't even want this stuff.

1189
01:18:33,747 --> 01:18:35,206
My world is bigger than that, Ted.

1190
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:36,457
There are other people.

1191
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:37,792
There are the Chinese.

1192
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:38,960
Linda, these surgeries...

1193
01:18:39,128 --> 01:18:40,211
No. It's not about the surgeries, Ted!

1194
01:18:40,295 --> 01:18:42,755
We can use this as leverage
to get Chad back.

1195
01:18:42,881 --> 01:18:43,881
What do you mean get him back?

1196
01:18:43,966 --> 01:18:45,550
Information is power, Ted.
Hello!

1197
01:18:45,634 --> 01:18:46,718
What do you mean get him back?

1198
01:18:46,802 --> 01:18:47,885
You don't know where he is?

1199
01:18:49,555 --> 01:18:51,639
Somebody has him, Ted.
We can use this to...

1200
01:18:51,765 --> 01:18:53,891
You call the police
if you wanna get back missing people.

1201
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:55,435
I can't take it! I can't take it!
I can't take it!

1202
01:18:55,519 --> 01:18:56,728
You know I can't do that.

1203
01:18:56,812 --> 01:18:58,563
We're operating off the map here, Ted.

1204
01:18:58,647 --> 01:19:00,565
This is higher than the police.
It is higher than them.

1205
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:02,734
- Linda, I...
- I need a can-do person, Ted!

1206
01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:05,069
I hate your negativity!
I hate your reasons why not!

1207
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:07,655
I hate you! I hate you!

1208
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:20,293
What will it be?

1209
01:19:21,211 --> 01:19:23,129
Seven and Seven.

1210
01:19:29,094 --> 01:19:30,845
<i>- Hello?
- It's Harry.</i>

1211
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:35,016
You think a marriage is...
And then it's...

1212
01:19:39,104 --> 01:19:41,689
But this has all been a long time coming.

1213
01:19:43,317 --> 01:19:46,986
Was it? Well, yeah, right.

1214
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:49,030
I'm just depressed.

1215
01:19:51,992 --> 01:19:54,368
I gotta exercise.
I haven't run in three days.

1216
01:19:54,453 --> 01:19:56,329
Butt crunches, anything.

1217
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,415
You think maybe I could stay here
for a little while?

1218
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,083
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.

1219
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:03,294
It can't always come from me.

1220
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:05,004
I'm not that strong!

1221
01:20:05,589 --> 01:20:07,507
You are not here for me, Harry.

1222
01:20:07,925 --> 01:20:11,636
I need a can-do person!
You're all defeated!

1223
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,471
Chad is the only can-do person I know,

1224
01:20:13,597 --> 01:20:15,640
- and now he's gone. He's gone.
- I'm sorry, baby.

1225
01:20:15,724 --> 01:20:17,558
I'll be good.
I'll be better.

1226
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:19,602
I just gotta exercise.

1227
01:20:19,686 --> 01:20:22,355
- Do you have a pedestrian path or something?
- Who the fuck is Chad?

1228
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:23,898
He's my friend from work.

1229
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:25,483
You can help me find him.

1230
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:26,651
You know law enforcement people.

1231
01:20:26,777 --> 01:20:27,819
You could make a call.

1232
01:20:27,903 --> 01:20:29,153
- Unofficially.
- Linda, hold on.

1233
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:30,321
What happened?
What's his name?

1234
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:31,447
Chad Feldheimer.

1235
01:20:31,573 --> 01:20:34,659
And he just disappeared.
He hasn't been at work or at home for two days!

1236
01:20:34,743 --> 01:20:36,369
Okay. You know his Social Security number?

1237
01:20:36,453 --> 01:20:38,663
- No! I...
- Okay.

1238
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:39,831
Where was the last place you saw him?

1239
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:41,666
No, I don't know.
He just disappeared.

1240
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:43,501
The Jamba Juice on K Street.

1241
01:20:43,585 --> 01:20:45,378
And now he's gone.

1242
01:20:45,504 --> 01:20:47,296
No. Okay.
Now, okay, okay.

1243
01:20:47,422 --> 01:20:50,633
We're gonna find your little buddy.
It's a piece of cake.

1244
01:20:50,759 --> 01:20:51,801
Okay.

1245
01:20:51,927 --> 01:20:55,429
- Piece of cake. Very easy.
- Okay.

1246
01:20:56,932 --> 01:21:00,768
Open your mouth, open it. Do as the doctor says.
Come on, open your mouth.

1247
01:21:00,894 --> 01:21:03,813
Come on. Open your mouth.
Now look here, young man.

1248
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:07,275
You do as I say, or I'm gonna ask your mother
to leave the doctor's room,

1249
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,819
and you and I are gonna
sort it out between us.

1250
01:21:14,658 --> 01:21:19,036
Hello?
I'm with a patient.

1251
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:23,124
And it's the same fucking patient
she's been with since yesterday?

1252
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:26,085
You tell Dr. Cox I have the new keys.

1253
01:21:43,687 --> 01:21:45,313
Hey, there, sunshine.

1254
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,815
You seem better.

1255
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:50,109
Yeah, well, I snuck in
a little gym time this morning.

1256
01:21:50,193 --> 01:21:51,777
And our exercise last night didn't hurt.

1257
01:21:51,904 --> 01:21:53,487
Why, Harry.

1258
01:21:53,614 --> 01:21:56,657
Boy, I tell you.
I'm through banging my head against the wall.

1259
01:21:56,783 --> 01:21:58,284
I'm gonna start doing what's right for me.

1260
01:21:58,368 --> 01:22:00,494
I believe that, also.
I think you have to do what's right for you.

1261
01:22:00,621 --> 01:22:02,413
Yeah. Hell, yeah.
You know, I had a shock recently,

1262
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:05,791
and I realized that life is not infinite
and that no one is immortal.

1263
01:22:05,876 --> 01:22:08,085
I think that it's very important
to maintain a positive attitude.

1264
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,545
Always up, always ebullient.

1265
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,213
Don't sweat the small stuff.

1266
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:13,215
- And it's all small stuff.
- And it's all small stuff.

1267
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:35,071
Just for starters.

1268
01:22:36,907 --> 01:22:38,366
Boy.

1269
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:42,662
Why, this is where we first met,
you remember?

1270
01:22:42,746 --> 01:22:44,538
Of course I do.

1271
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,709
And it's hard to know
what the important days are until you...

1272
01:22:50,837 --> 01:22:52,922
Now, I told myself that
I wasn't going to be paranoid,

1273
01:22:53,006 --> 01:22:55,049
but is that guy looking at us?

1274
01:22:57,928 --> 01:22:59,095
No. Uh-uh.

1275
01:23:00,013 --> 01:23:01,597
Have you found out anything about Chad?

1276
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:02,682
No, nothing yet.

1277
01:23:02,766 --> 01:23:04,809
I put in a couple of calls.
It shouldn't take too long.

1278
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:05,935
Really?

1279
01:23:06,603 --> 01:23:09,480
Yeah. There are so many databases now
it's a joke.

1280
01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:12,066
Back when I was in PP,
there was still an art

1281
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:13,693
to finding people.
But not anymore.

1282
01:23:13,777 --> 01:23:17,530
Now with cell phones?
I mean, pretty soon everybody's gonna know

1283
01:23:17,614 --> 01:23:19,573
where you are at any given moment,
any given moment.

1284
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,950
Mmm-hmm.

1285
01:23:21,743 --> 01:23:22,785
All right.

1286
01:23:23,245 --> 01:23:25,079
When you left Jamba Juice,

1287
01:23:25,163 --> 01:23:27,873
did Chad give you any idea
where he might be going?

1288
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,251
- I know where he was going.
- You do?

1289
01:23:30,335 --> 01:23:35,756
Georgetown. Olive Street.
160 Olive Street.

1290
01:23:36,591 --> 01:23:39,593
It's the residence of this guy,
Osborne Cox.

1291
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:49,478
Who are you?

1292
01:23:52,607 --> 01:23:53,649
What?

1293
01:23:54,651 --> 01:23:58,821
Who are you? You CIA? NSA?
You're military?

1294
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:03,826
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?

1295
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:06,829
Who are you?

1296
01:24:08,206 --> 01:24:12,209
I'm just Linda Litzke.

1297
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:29,560
Harry!

1298
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:18,335
For Pete's sake.

1299
01:26:51,161 --> 01:26:54,205
And you are my wife's lover?

1300
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:57,833
No.

1301
01:26:57,918 --> 01:26:58,959
Then what are you doing here?

1302
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:05,382
I know you.
You're the guy from the gym.

1303
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,552
I'm not here representing Hardbodies.

1304
01:27:08,637 --> 01:27:12,139
Yes. I know very well
what you represent.

1305
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:15,351
You represent the idiocy of today.

1306
01:27:17,646 --> 01:27:19,146
I don't represent that, either.

1307
01:27:19,231 --> 01:27:20,898
Yeah.
You're the guy at the gym

1308
01:27:20,982 --> 01:27:23,025
when I asked about that moronic woman.

1309
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:25,402
She's not a moron.

1310
01:27:25,528 --> 01:27:27,863
You're in league
with that moronic woman.

1311
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:30,324
You're part of a league of morons.

1312
01:27:30,408 --> 01:27:31,909
No. No.

1313
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:34,745
Yes. You see,
you're one of the morons

1314
01:27:34,829 --> 01:27:37,456
I've been fighting my whole life,

1315
01:27:37,624 --> 01:27:41,627
my whole fucking life.
But guess what.

1316
01:27:43,672 --> 01:27:45,547
Today, I win.

1317
01:27:55,642 --> 01:27:56,725
Stop!

1318
01:27:58,311 --> 01:27:59,687
Intruder!

1319
01:28:00,397 --> 01:28:03,983
Stop! Intruder! Stop!

1320
01:28:07,946 --> 01:28:10,072
Wait. Wait a minute.

1321
01:28:13,243 --> 01:28:15,869
Where is the Treasury guy?
Pfarrer?

1322
01:28:15,954 --> 01:28:17,830
- Right now?
- Right now.

1323
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,958
He is in a detention room
at Washington Dulles.

1324
01:28:21,042 --> 01:28:22,084
Why?

1325
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:24,795
He was trying to board
a flight to Venezuela.

1326
01:28:24,963 --> 01:28:28,424
We had his name on a hot list.
CBP pulled him in.

1327
01:28:30,135 --> 01:28:33,178
Don't know why he was trying
to go to Venezuela.

1328
01:28:33,263 --> 01:28:34,430
You don't know.

1329
01:28:34,514 --> 01:28:35,681
No, sir.

1330
01:28:36,641 --> 01:28:38,809
We have no extradition with Venezuela.

1331
01:28:39,394 --> 01:28:40,519
Oh!

1332
01:28:41,563 --> 01:28:43,188
So what should we do with him?

1333
01:28:43,273 --> 01:28:45,316
For fuck's sake,
put him on the next flight to Venezuela.

1334
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,234
Yes, sir. Okay.

1335
01:28:48,069 --> 01:28:51,322
- Okay. So the gym manager is dead.
- Yes, sir.

1336
01:28:51,406 --> 01:28:52,448
The body is...

1337
01:28:52,532 --> 01:28:53,907
That's gone, sir.

1338
01:28:55,577 --> 01:28:56,618
Okay.

1339
01:28:57,287 --> 01:29:00,956
But there was a snag.

1340
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:03,125
What?

1341
01:29:03,585 --> 01:29:04,918
Well...

1342
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:10,424
this analyst, Cox,
was attacking the gym guy.

1343
01:29:10,842 --> 01:29:12,843
It was in broad daylight,
on the street.

1344
01:29:12,927 --> 01:29:15,304
Our man did not know what to do.

1345
01:29:15,388 --> 01:29:16,597
Felt he had to step in.

1346
01:29:17,265 --> 01:29:18,474
Yes?

1347
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,434
He...

1348
01:29:22,354 --> 01:29:25,731
He shot the analyst.
He shot Cox.

1349
01:29:27,776 --> 01:29:30,694
Good. Great.
Is he dead?

1350
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:32,863
No, sir. He's in a coma.

1351
01:29:33,907 --> 01:29:36,450
They don't think he's gonna make it.
They don't think...

1352
01:29:36,534 --> 01:29:40,162
They're pretty sure that he has
no brain function.

1353
01:29:41,373 --> 01:29:46,335
Okay. Okay. If he wakes up, we'll worry
about it then. Jesus, what a clusterfuck.

1354
01:29:46,419 --> 01:29:48,712
So, that's it then?

1355
01:29:48,797 --> 01:29:51,757
No one else really knows anything.
Okay.

1356
01:29:51,841 --> 01:29:53,050
Um...

1357
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:55,719
Well, sir, there is...

1358
01:29:55,804 --> 01:29:59,640
What?

1359
01:29:59,724 --> 01:30:02,351
There is the woman, the gym woman,

1360
01:30:02,435 --> 01:30:03,685
Linda Litzke.

1361
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:06,688
Oh! Fuck, yeah.
God! Where is she?

1362
01:30:06,773 --> 01:30:08,732
We picked her up.
We have her.

1363
01:30:09,442 --> 01:30:11,193
We have her?
To do what with?

1364
01:30:11,277 --> 01:30:17,783
She says she'll play ball
if we pay for some,

1365
01:30:17,867 --> 01:30:21,328
I know this sounds odd,
some surgeries

1366
01:30:21,413 --> 01:30:24,498
that she wants, cosmetic surgery.

1367
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:27,459
She says she'll sit on everything.

1368
01:30:28,002 --> 01:30:29,211
How much?

1369
01:30:29,295 --> 01:30:30,671
There were several procedures.

1370
01:30:30,755 --> 01:30:31,880
- Altogether they...
- Pay it.

1371
01:30:31,965 --> 01:30:34,174
Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah.

1372
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:38,804
Jesus fucking Christ!

1373
01:30:38,888 --> 01:30:40,389
Yeah.

1374
01:30:41,933 --> 01:30:43,767
What do we learn, Palmer?

1375
01:30:43,852 --> 01:30:45,185
I don't know, sir.

1376
01:30:46,104 --> 01:30:47,855
I don't fucking know, either.

1377
01:30:49,232 --> 01:30:51,442
- I guess we learn not to do it again.
- Yes, sir.

1378
01:30:51,526 --> 01:30:53,652
I'm fucked if I know what we did.

1379
01:30:53,778 --> 01:30:55,946
Yes, sir, it's hard to say.

1380
01:30:57,532 --> 01:30:59,908
Jesus fucking Christ.
