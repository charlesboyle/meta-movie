1
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,385
You walk here?

2
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,143
Alright, good. Turn around.

3
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,310
Legs out.

4
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,790
The bag.

5
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,999
Gotta still hit the
farmers' market.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,479
- What time is it?
- 10:00-ish.

7
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,959
- It's 10:00?
- Mm-hm.

8
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,199
I gotta pick up the kid.
Where's Tony?

9
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,359
Tony and I were out late last night.
But don't worry, he's gonna be here.

10
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,839
- You got this?
- Yes.

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,830
He's not gonna flake. Neither am I.

12
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,399
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,079
- Yes, Chef.
- Wake up.

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,599
We got a critic coming today.

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,439
Why you think I slept
here for, bro?

16
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,839
Let's get going on the soup.
We're behind on the egg prep.

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,839
And get the mise on the steak.
You still shitfaced?

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,399
- No, I'm good. I'm good, Chef.
- Alright.

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,439
Help Martin with the pig.
We got the pig.

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,430
Lechon!

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,702
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,399
Buckle up, buddy. Sorry I'm late.

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,079
I'm used to it.

24
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,639
Listen, pal, I don't think we
have time to catch a movie today.

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,679
Is it 'cause you're
getting reviewed?

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,359
- Yeah, how'd you know about that?
- Mom told me.

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,919
What'd she say?

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,999
She said you might
be a little worried.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,919
- She said I was worried?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,359
Well, Mom doesn't know
me that well, OK?

31
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,719
- She's pretty spot-on about you.
- Oh, yeah?

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,559
You know what Mommy
thinks I should be doing?

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,159
- What?
- That I should get a food truck.

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,999
- I like food trucks.
- Yeah, I like food trucks.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,479
Who doesn't like food trucks?

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,719
Can you picture me driving
a food truck? I'm a chef.

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,839
- I work in a restaurant.
- OK.

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,559
Listen, I gotta go to the farmers'
market, pick up some ingredients.

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,999
OK. Can I come?

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,839
I thought I'd drop you
off at the restaurant.

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,439
- Molly's there.
- No, I wanna go with you.

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,359
- You're not gonna ask me
for everything you see?
- No.

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,279
It's not about you eating,
it's about me buying groceries.

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,719
- I know.
- OK. Good.

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,319
- You got the purple and white?
- Just orange.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,159
Just orange? Alright, give
me six bunches of those.

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,639
- Or eight of the small.
- Dad.

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,679
Hang on a second, buddy. And on the
radishes here, I use the tops, OK?

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,159
- I need consistent tops.
- Dad.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,559
Is that what's happening?
Six of these. Let's see what we got.

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,039
- Dad.
- What do you want, Percy?

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,239
- Can I please have kettle corn?
- Daddy's working, OK?

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,719
No, you're not gonna get kettle...

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,119
- Why don't you get a piece of fruit?
- I don't want fruit.

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,719
How can you even ask for kettle corn?
You know what it is?

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,239
- No.
- It's carbs covered with sugar, OK?

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,919
Look at this piece of fruit.

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,559
Huh? It's beautiful.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,039
How could you even want kettle corn

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
with gorgeous fruit like
this in front of you?

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,519
Why don't you have
a piece of fruit?

62
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,439
So apparently they're
sending a big reviewer

63
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,319
who's also some huge food blogger.

64
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,399
- You know what a food blogger is?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,759
A guy who writes about
food on the internet.

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,399
I know what a food blogger is.

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,799
Well, this guy's a big one,
and a lot of these big guys,

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,279
they don't like me.

69
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,319
They got it in for me because I got
good write-ups when I started out.

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,239
- They're haters.
- Exactly.

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,239
We didn't have that word
when I was growing up.

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,719
There was no word for hater.

73
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,959
The most you would say is that
somebody was, like, jealous,

74
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,439
which didn't really capture it.

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,639
The sausage guy's here.
You ever try andouille sausage?

76
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,119
- No.
- It's spicy.

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,559
- You like spicy?
- No.

78
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,505
It's not so spicy. Come on.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,759
That's from New Orleans.
You ever heard of New Orleans?

80
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,239
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,719
It's part of the United States.

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,359
It's part of the Louisiana
Purchase from Napoleon.

83
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,879
Yeah. Um, that was...

84
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,679
I mean, like, now. That
was a long time ago.

85
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,239
- 1803.
- Whatever.

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,319
Talking about the food,
the culture, you know?

87
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,679
Like this andouille sausage.

88
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,239
- Beignets. You ever hear of that?
- We can get it here.

89
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,719
Not the same.

90
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,119
When you have it here, it's
good because it reminds you of,

91
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,039
like, a whole world of memories
that you have of being there.

92
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,919
'Cause it's like... I'm telling you,
it's like a whole different world.

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,999
- We should go there sometime.
- Definitely.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,919
- For real?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,599
I mean, not now.

96
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,079
- But, like...
- When?

97
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,867
I don't know. I got...
Everything's very full for me.

98
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,959
- I got this reviewer coming.
- After the review?

99
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
Yeah, after review. That'd be good.

100
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,839
I'm off school next month.

101
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,959
Next month? Yeah.
We could go next month.

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,439
- Awesome.
- Or whatever. Or, like, if you're...

103
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,919
If it doesn't... I'll ask Mom.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,919
If it doesn't work out next
month, we'll go later.

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,071
- But we'll definitely check it out.
- I already did. She's cool with it.

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,599
- You asked her already?
- Mm-hm.

107
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,999
Where'd you get a phone? How
come you have a phone already?

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,519
Everybody your age have phones?

109
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,479
Yo, Popeye, get the
sauce on there, OK?

110
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,479
Whose bacon is this, huh?
I gotta watch this too?

111
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,519
When I find out who it is, grab your
ankles, 'cause here comes papi chulo.

112
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,959
Where we at? Talk to me,
people. How we doing?

113
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,959
The stock's simmering, the pig's
broken down, bacon are fine.

114
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,719
The stock is simmering.
That means reducing.

115
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,799
Good. Guys, big night tonight.
You all know what's happening?

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,799
Yeah? OK, let me know
as soon as he's here.

117
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,799
I want people having fun
at all the tables around.

118
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,599
Call your pretty friends, bring 'em in.
Tell 'em the tickets are on me.

119
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,199
The stemware looks crooked.
Let's get out there.

120
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,199
Don't make me get the fucking
ruler out. Thank you.

121
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,679
- Oh, Chef.
- I got the good shit.

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,679
- You see this, Martin?
- Look at that. That's a specimen.

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,519
- Baby carrots.
- I got you curry paste with...

124
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,279
- Copy that. Copy that.
- Carl.

125
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,759
Not right now, please.

126
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,599
Where the fuck did you get
these juicy-ass tomatoes?

127
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,943
- Riva's here.
- OK, you got it? Let's get...

128
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,159
What the hell's Riva doing here?

129
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,159
I don't know. He was
on his way back here.

130
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,319
I got him espresso, bought
you five minutes of time.

131
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,919
You should meet him
out on the floor.

132
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,319
Stall him for five minutes. Let
me get the staff going. Please.

133
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,559
OK. Fine. Expect him
to come back here.

134
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,039
Yeah, thank you.

135
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,039
How you gonna keep that
psychopath from coming back here?

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,279
- You gotta have a plan.
- You want me to pickle these?

137
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,879
Yeah, pickle these.
I want you to pickle...

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,359
- Is Carl in there?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,639
Hey, Carl!

140
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,479
Carl.

141
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,199
Are you, uh... are you
planning on altering the menu?

142
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,159
Yeah, I can't do this right
now. Please, just...

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,399
- You know a lot is on the line today.
- I know.

144
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,999
That's why the menu
has to be perfect.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,599
- But I can help you plan it.
- I can't do this right now.

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,159
Give me five minutes with my staff,
I'll walk you through the menu.

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,959
I've done this before.
I can help guide you.

148
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,111
I don't need guidance
right now. I need space.

149
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,119
OK?

150
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,110
Thank you.

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,946
Could we have a little
privacy, uh, guys?

152
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,559
Huh?

153
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,142
I ask you to leave,
you gotta look at Carl?

154
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,239
OK, everybody, tomen cinco.
Take five.

155
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,719
- You good?
- I got it. Go, go, go.

156
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,790
Grab a coffee.

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,039
- Let's get something straight.
- Yeah.

158
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,839
You don't fucking talk to my
staff like that. I talk to my staff.

159
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,079
That side of the pass is
you, this side is me.

160
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,719
That was the arrangement
when you hired me.

161
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,719
OK, now will you listen
to me for a minute?

162
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,559
Carl, I get ideas.
Sometimes my ideas work.

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,079
I really don't care what magazine
said that you're the next big thing.

164
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,519
The fact is, you work for me,
in my restaurant, right?

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,359
I've had chefs before
you in this kitchen.

166
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,799
- I'll have chefs after you. OK?
- Alright, good talk.

167
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,039
- Let me get back to work.
- You know who's coming tonight.

168
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,359
We're being reviewed by the most
important critic in the city.

169
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,999
- Yes. I'm aware.
- His online blog was sold to AOL...

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,519
- For $10 million.
- That's right.

171
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,159
- You knew that?
- Yes, I know.

172
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,679
- OK.
- He's a big deal.

173
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,799
- That's why I wanna cook a good menu.
- You wanna cook a good menu?

174
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,199
- I wanna cook him some good food.
- Yeah. Well, then...

175
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,479
And our place is in a
fucking creative rut.

176
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,479
- In a rut?
- In a creative rut.

177
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,879
You do know we're doing better than
any place in the neighbourhood?

178
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,719
I'm not talking about how
much money we're making,

179
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,559
I'm talking about creatively...
the food that we're serving.

180
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,159
We've served the same
food for five years.

181
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,199
Remember what happened when
you put guts on the menu?

182
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,559
Are you talking about my sweetbreads?
Is that what you mean?

183
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,279
Yeah. When you put that artsy shit
on the menu, people don't like it.

184
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,159
Not one person ordered
your sweetbreads.

185
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,679
Please listen to me.

186
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,039
I sank a fortune into the remodel
to get you the French cooking top,

187
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,519
whatever it is, that tabletop.

188
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,999
- French cooking suite.
- Right.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,199
Not every chef gets that.
You know why you get it?

190
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,639
- I appreciate it.
- Do you know why?

191
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,119
Because you deserve it.

192
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,159
See, you don't know that.
But I know it.

193
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,759
You deserve it.

194
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,719
So be smart just for tonight.

195
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,679
Look, if you bought Stones tickets

196
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,319
and Jagger didn't play
'Satisfaction', how would you feel?

197
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,039
Would you be happy?

198
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,519
- No.
- No!

199
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,341
You'd burn the place
to the fucking ground.

200
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,119
Your menu works.

201
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,304
People love it.

202
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,079
Carl, do what you want tonight.
OK? You're the chef.

203
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,959
You know what I think?

204
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,030
I think you should play your hits.

205
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,119
Alright, let's go. Pre-shift, guys.

206
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,919
Big night tonight.

207
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,959
Here's what we're doing.

208
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,279
We're gonna go with the favourites.

209
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,623
Starting with the caviar egg...

210
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,187
scallop, French onion soup...

211
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,670
frisée salad...

212
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,304
lobster risotto...

213
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,519
filet.

214
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,639
And we're gonna finish
strong with a crowd pleaser,

215
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,679
chocolate lava cake.

216
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,079
Talk to Molly about wine pairings.

217
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,319
Let me know when he gets here.
And let's have fun.

218
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,719
Put your heart in it, people,
big night. Let's have some fun.

219
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,710
Good, good.

220
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
<i>I'm so tired of being alone</i>

221
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,159
<i>I'm so tired of on-my-own</i>

222
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,279
<i>Won't you help me, girl,
just as soon as you can?</i>

223
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,159
<i>People say that I've found a way</i>

224
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,359
<i>To make you say that you love me</i>

225
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,039
<i>Hey, baby, you didn't go for that</i>

226
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,941
<i>It's a natural fact</i>

227
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,439
<i>That I wanna come back</i>

228
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,908
<i>Show me where it's at</i>

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,559
<i>Baby, yeah</i>

230
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,799
<i>I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired...</i>

231
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,679
Dad.

232
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,679
Dad.

233
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,467
Dad! Come on. Let's go.

234
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,079
Look! It's up, it's up. It's up,
it's up. The review's up.

235
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,639
To the review. Here we go.

236
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,239
- To you, baby, to you.
- Here we go.

237
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,310
- My culinary hero.
- To the team.

238
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,439
"Gauloises - eager to please."

239
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,999
- Whoo!
- Yes!

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,199
"10 years ago, I had the
good fortune to dine

241
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,279
"at Chef Casper's revelatory
Miami bistro, Marrow."

242
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,839
- Miami in the house!
- Marrow, baby!

243
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,319
That's your house!

244
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,519
"The sheer audacity of this fresh,
brave voice of the culinary scene

245
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,039
"reminded me why I write
about food as a vocation."

246
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,879
- Yeah!
- That's a lot of pressure.

247
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,119
"It is nearly impossible to separate
my glowing regard for Chef Casper

248
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,199
"and how much he inspired me from my
expectations as I sat down to dine

249
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,399
"at the recently remodelled
Brentwood Gallic staple, Gauloises."

250
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,824
- Yeah, this is good!
- "Oh, how times have changed.

251
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,199
"Over the last decade, Carl Casper has
somehow managed to transform himself

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,439

you $5 every time you see her

"in hopes that you will like her,

255
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,799
"but instead causes you to
shrink from her cloying embrace

"A shirred egg topped
with a dollop of caviar

"is an excuse for the
chef to overcharge us

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,144
Two stars.

274
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,599
I don't get it. I don't get it.

275
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,799
Everyone loved it.
He loved it, even.

276
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,119
Then Why'd he write all that mean
shit about me? About my food?

277
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,559
Who cares? Who cares?

278
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,159
I do. 'Cause I could
have done better.

279
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,159
I should have cooked the
shit I was gonna cook.

280
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,999
You're ignoring the fact
that everyone was happy

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,399
and you're making a problem
where there's no problem.

282
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,959
It's not hard to make people happy.

283
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,599
There's certain things you could put on
a menu that'll make everybody happy.

284
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,159
If you put ahi tuna on a
menu, it will sell out.

285
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,879
It's guaranteed. You know that.

286
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,399
But I cooked the beef cheek,
which is a better dish,

287
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,879
and nobody wants to even try it.

288
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,319
- It was good, though.
- Yeah, for family meal.

289
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,879
Well, who you cooking for, though?

290
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,719
That's my point.
Why do I have to pick?

291
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,639
Why do I have to choose?
Why can't I have both?

292
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,599
There are chefs that cook
food that they believe in

293
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,279
and people will try because
they're open to a new experience

294
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,799
and they'll end up liking it.

295
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,039
- What do you want me to say to you?
- The truth.

296
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,279
You want me to tell you
that you're the best chef

297
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,039
that I ever worked with.

298
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,839
And it's true, because you are.

299
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,239
You are, Carl. You are the best
chef I've ever worked with.

300
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,279
- OK.
- I mean it.

301
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,479
Well, thank you.

302
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,470
You're welcome.

303
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,999
- We both agreed not to do that.
- I know.

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,279
Why don't I just
cook you something?

305
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,759
Oh, OK. Fuck it. Let's go.

306
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,879
Mmm!

307
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,905
Mom wants to talk to you.

308
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,401
Inez?

309
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,799
Inez.

310
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,279
Are you OK?

311
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,839
I got two stars.

312
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,759
Getting two stars is good, right?

313
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,999
I mean, I don't read that
shit normally, but, you know,

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,239
then he starts writing all this
personal shit about me and...

315
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,479
How many people you got working?
You got, like, 50 people.

316
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,719
And Percy's 10 years old.
Does he still need a nanny?

317
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,359
He's in school all day. What does
she even do here? Hi, Flora.

318
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
- Hi, Mr Carl.
- I mean, what does he need...

319
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,146
- What's she doing here?
- You know that he's hurt, right?

320
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,719
Because I was late? I already
apologised to him. We're fine.

321
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,359
Late? He waited for you for
one hour alone outside.

322
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,959
Well, I didn't realise
it was that long.

323
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,064
It's just... that
was the day that...

324
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,159
You're right.

325
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,708
I didn't like what
they wrote about you.

326
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,390
I didn't like it either.

327
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,599
It hurt, alright?

328
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,989
You OK?

329
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,070
I'm alright.

330
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,199
Good.

331
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,279
I'm gonna make it up to him.

332
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,399
- That was fun, right?
- Yeah.

333
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,359
- Where you going?
- I gotta work on a menu.

334
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,239
It's still early. Can I watch?

335
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,759
Yeah, sorry, it's at work.

336
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,079
- I won't get in the way.
- Yeah, I gotta go work.

337
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,159
- OK. 'Bye.
- We'll have fun next week.

338
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,199
OK.

339
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,199
What the hell are you doing here,
man? What's this madness, huh?

340
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,719
- This is crazy.
- Yeah.

341
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,199
- You didn't go home, did you?
- No.

342
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,799
- Come here. Check it out.
- Go home, man.

343
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,639
- You've been here all night. Go home.
- Come here.

344
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,639
Get some sleep. Fuck Twitter.
Come on, get outta here.

345
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,479
"Fuck Twitter"? What are you
talking about, "Fuck Twitter"?

346
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,479
I mean, you know, fuck 'em.
That's what I mean.

347
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,319
- Who reads that shit anyhow?
- I'm not on Twitter.

348
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,799
I don't know what
you're talking about.

349
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,319
Nothing. Just classic bullshit.
What is that?

350
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,504
- That's carne asada. Check it out.
- Wow.

351
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,359
Wow!

352
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,319
- Good?
- It's fucking unbelievable, man.

353
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,359
- Is it?
- Holy shit!

354
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,359
- No, seriously.
- No, I'm serious.

355
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,199
- Tell me the truth.
- I'm telling you the truth.

356
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,839
- It's incredible.
- Is it good seasoning?

357
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,319
- The seasoning's perfect.
- Roll that shit!

358
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,199
Chef Big Dog up all night cooking!

359
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,679
- Come on in, buddy.
- Come here.

360
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,119
- Tony, check this out.
- Shut up and taste this, amuse douche.

361
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,110
- Come here.
- What we got?

362
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,399
- Wow.
- It's good?

363
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,359
Huh? Look at that.

364
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,159
- Too much heat?
- That's perfect, Chef.

365
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,679
- It's good? Seasoning?
- Oh, it's perfect.

366
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,159
- It's nice and spicy.
- You like it?

367
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,879
- Oh, man.
- Ha, jefe? Look at that.

368
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,039
- I do.
- Yeah?

369
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,559
- It's fucking great.
- Is it good?

370
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,159
- Don't fuck with me.
- But it's so good.

371
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,239
- See, jefe? I told you.
- It's flavourful as fuck, man.

372
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,839
- It's nice, right?
- Umm.

373
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,627
- Is it good?
- Yo, Big Dog, fuck Twitter.

374
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,799
"Fuck Twitter". Again
with the "Fuck Twitter".

375
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,279
Why should I fuck Twitter?

376
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,479
- You're not on Twitter?
- No.

377
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,279
You're getting too much pussy?
Is that the problem?

378
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,759
It's gotta be, right?

379
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,359
What does Twitter have
to do with pussy?

380
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,879
Have you not heard of the
term 'social networking'?

381
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,359
- Yeah.
- Well, that's what it is.

382
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,319
- It means pussy?
- Like, pussy.

383
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,479
Or, like, getting
tickets to something.

384
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,479
- Or finding about a new band.
- Flash mobs. That kind of stuff.

385
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,639
- Anything that requires a database.
- So pussy requires a database?

386
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,599
Yeah!

387
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,865
So show me what's on Twitter
that's so bad that I should see.

388
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,399
- Oh, shit, is that gochujang?
- Nothing. Nothing.

389
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,919
- Damn, you made fucking gochujang?
- Yeah, that's under the squab.

390
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,319
But he's gonna 86 it.
Riva's gonna 86 it, I know.

391
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,479
- Yo, this gochujang is good.
- Don't worry about fucking Riva.

392
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,319
He ain't gonna let you
serve that Korean shit.

393
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,599
Let me handle him. Don't
worry about that. I got it.

394
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,239
He says I can cook whatever I want.

395
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,079
- Alright. Alright.
- We're gonna cook like this.

396
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,799
- Did you try that? Oh, hey.
- Oh, man.

397
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,359
That's broccoli rabe
l'anchois. Check this out.

398
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,119
This is ridiculous.

399
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,384
- What you got over there?
- I got...

400
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,199
- Mom cuts off the crust.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

401
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,919
- It's good.
- You bet your ass it's good.

402
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,479
Can you turn that down, please?

403
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,279
Oh, sorry.

404
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,111
Arrgh!

405
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,439
You know about Twitter?

406
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,669
- Yeah, I have an account.
- Yeah?

407
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,559
- How's it work?
- It's cool.

408
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,399
It's cool? That's how
it works, it's cool?

409
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,639
- You tweet on it.
- Is that like texting?

410
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,279
No.

411
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,719
- Sign me up.
- OK.

412
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,839
So, what do you want
your username to be?

413
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,319
Carl.

414
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,919
You can't just put Carl.
It has to be 'at something'.

415
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,759
At Carl Casper.

416
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,706
@CarlCasper.

417
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,350
- Taken.
- Someone took my name?

418
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,959
@ChefCarlCasper? Is that cool?

419
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,639
Yeah, that's good.

420
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,871
At... Chef...

421
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,919
Carl... Casper.

422
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,639
So is this for sex?

423
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,479
Eww! Is that what
you're doing this for?

424
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,719
No, I'm not doing it for that.
Someone wrote something bad.

425
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,319
I wanna see what they wrote.

426
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,839
Good.

427
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,679
Oh, shit.

428
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,879
Hey. You can't talk like that.

429
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,679
I don't care if Mommy's not around.
I don't want you cursing around here.

430
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,919
- That review went viral.
- What does that mean?

431
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,999
It means it got picked up
and re-tweeted everywhere.

432
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,999
So all these people
have read the review?

433
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,759
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

434
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,879
- I think it's kinda cool.
- I don't.

435
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,319
- No, I mean, us doing this.
- Doing what?

436
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,839
You know, just hanging out.

437
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,319
We hang out all the time.

438
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,948
No, like, hanging out
and doing something.

439
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,119
Well, we do things.

440
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,479
No, not just, like, watching
something or doing something.

441
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,759
Like, hanging out and talking.

442
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,479
And learning things
from each other.

443
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,479
I figured, you know, with
you living at Mom's house

444
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,679
and me working all the time, when we
hung out, you liked to do fun things.

445
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,679
I think this is kinda fun.
You know, just figuring stuff out.

446
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,830
Like when you lived at home.

447
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,790
Yeah, I miss that too.

448
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,390
Then why don't you move back home?

449
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,070
Percy, I can't just...

450
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,279
You're not the reason that I'm not
living at home. You know that, right?

451
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,879
- Mm-hm.
- 'Cause it's true.

452
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,919
- Then why?
- Then why what?

453
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,502
Well, why don't you live home?

454
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,639
Well, Mommy and Daddy, you know,

455
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,559
we... we both grew apart,
in different directions.

456
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,679
But we're still
really good friends.

457
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,919
It's just better if we don't
live in the same house.

458
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,719
- And that we're not married.
- Oh.

459
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,759
- You understand?
- No.

460
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,944
It's hard to explain.

461
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,439
Hey, listen, could we twitter each other
when we're not in the same place?

462
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,319
- Yeah.
- Could you show me how to do that?

463
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,799
Yeah. OK.

464
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,622
So, first you click here and you
have to enter your username.

465
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,959
- Right.
- You could also log in on your iPhone.

466
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,439
Uh-huh.

467
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,279
You click this button here,

468
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,759
it posts your feed so all
your followers can read it.

469
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,310
OK.

470
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,999
- Dad?
- Yeah.

471
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,199
You got 1,653 followers
since last night.

472
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,279
- Oh, is that good?
- It's amazing.

473
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,119
Oh, good. What does it mean?

474
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,159
It means that 1,653 people are
reading your Twitter feed.

475
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,719
Mm-hm. I thought it
was like texting.

476
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,719
Did you post anything
since last night?

477
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,599
- No.
- Are you sure?

478
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,079
Yeah, I just sent a private
message to somebody.

479
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,999
- To who?
- To that A-hole food critic.

480
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,239
You could only send private messages
to people who are following you.

481
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,279
I think you might have
posted that publicly.

482
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,879
No, he wrote something nasty
about me and then I hit reply

483
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,719
and it let me send
a message to him.

484
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,639
Dad, replies are public.
Everybody can read them.

485
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,279
And it looks like he re-tweeted it

486
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:39,279
to all his 123,845 followers.

487
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,430
And he wrote back.

488
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,910
What did he say?

489
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,439
- I don't think I should read it.
- Just...

490
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,319
Can you read it to me, please?

491
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,549
Read the reply.

492
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,519
"@ChefCarlCasper...

He wrote it to everybody.

- Wow.

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,559
I'm up to 2,000 followers
since last night.

501
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,399
- You're trending, bro.
- They're sending me messages.

502
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,119
They're goading me into
responding to this prick.

503
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,359
- Don't do it. Don't do it, man.
- Don't do that, Chef.

504
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,959
- Don't respond. Take the high road.
- I know.

505
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
But half the people
are saying he's right.

506
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,399
Yeah, but half the people
are saying he's wrong.

507
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,199
- That's the fucking internet.
- That's right. Listen to him.

508
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,399
- That's social media. You on Twitter?
- Yeah, I'm Twitter.

509
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,079
- What's your name?
- Little Marty.

510
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,879
But all the people following me,
I don't wanna hang out during the day.

511
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,039
I avoid all... Oh, hey, hey,
hey, what are you doing?

512
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,519
- This guy.
- Don't. What are you writing?

513
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,999
Chef, don't... That's
not a good idea.

514
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,839
Just listen. I won't send it
until we all say it's OK.

515
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,559
"Why don't you come
by again tonight?

516
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,559
"I got a whole new menu
just for you, asshole."

517
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,799
- No, gimme the phone.
- That's not good. Not a good idea.

518
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,679
Don't do it!

519
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,519
- That's out there now, bro.
- It happened.

520
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,319
- Why'd you do that?
- You can't take that back.

521
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,359
You know what? I threw
down the gauntlet.

522
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,839
So get ready for a fight.

523
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,639
I'm gonna go drop Percy
off and come back

524
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,439
and cook the menu we
should've cooked last time.

525
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,119
- So where are we going today?
- I gotta drop you off, kid.

526
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,159
I gotta go shopping for
tonight. I'm sorry.

527
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,159
- Can I come with you?
- No, I'm sorry.

528
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,559
How come I'm, like, never
allowed to be in the kitchen?

529
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,359
Because it's hot and it's loud and
there's a lot of bad language.

530
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,159
So? I hear bad
language all the time.

531
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,319
- Where?
- Online.

532
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,959
What kind of website could a 10-year-old
get on that has bad language?

533
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,239
- YouTube.
- YouTube has bad language?

534
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,839
Could I at least come
shopping with you?

535
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,319
No.

536
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,505
I got a lot to do and
a lot on my mind.

537
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,707
Look who's waiting for us.
Hi, Mommy.

538
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,679
Come here. I miss you.
Give me a kiss.

539
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

540
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,879
So my publicist said that
she can talk to you.

541
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,639
- Why don't you talk to her?
- About what?

542
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,599
- About Twitter?
- Everybody's reading what you wrote.

543
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,919
- I don't think you get it.
- Get what?

544
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,582
Let's call her. Go inside
with me and we'll call her.

545
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,559
Yes, please, tell her
to call me immediately.

546
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,079
I have Carl with me.
I'm at home. Thank you.

547
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,399
- Alright, I'm gonna go.
- No, no, she's gonna call right back.

548
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,439
- She was on the other line.
- You're making more of this than it is.

549
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,279
I just don't like to
see you like this.

550
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,279
Like what? I'm fine.
I have to get to work.

551
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,279
You're never going to be happy
cooking for someone else.

552
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,919
Is this about the food truck?
I don't wanna talk about it again.

553
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,919
Why not? You can cook your own
food. You can be your own boss.

554
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,159
I can book you for all the
parties that I'm doing.

555
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,159
I appreciate the offer, but
I don't need any charity

556
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,639
from you or your ex-husband.

557
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,919
- Why are you being so proud?
- Because I'm working.

558
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,399
And despite what you might think,

559
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,559
I have complete freedom to
cook whatever I want now.

560
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,039
I like my life.

561
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,039
And as far as your publicist goes,
when she calls back, you let her know

562
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,239
that I understand I shouldn't
tweet any pictures of my dick

563
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,039
and any career advice
should be kept to oneself.

564
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,479
OK? I'll see you later. Thank you.

565
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,119
- I got all this shit in the trunk.
- Want me to do this?

566
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,559
- Is it on?
- Yeah. We're doing it.

567
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,559
- We're doing it, guys.
- Come on. Let's get everything out.

568
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,439
I want the Cambros, the delis
out so we can start plating, OK?

569
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,439
Carl, can you tell me what's
going on for tonight?

570
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,439
No, no, no, how many
covers do we have tonight?

571
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,159
How many? We are overbooked.
But I just printed out all the menus.

572
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,239
Good. It's not the menu you
got printed. It's different.

573
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,079
- That's what I understand.
- We're doing a tasting menu.

574
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,879
- Carl, I have to put the wine...
- A tasting menu for Ramsey Michel.

575
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,879
- I know, but we...
- He's coming. He knows about it.

576
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,439
- Did you see the 'Eater' article?
- I did.

577
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,319
- I'm so excited for you.
- It's all over the internet.

578
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,319
- I love it when you're like this.
- Taste the food.

579
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,319
Bring in the waitstaff,
have 'em taste the food.

580
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,759
Make them understand
what we're going for.

581
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,079
- OK.
- OK?

582
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,079
We're not pushing specials today.
The whole menu is special.

583
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,559
- I'm excited.
- I'm excited. I'm finally happy.

584
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,039
I'm happy, OK?

585
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,039
Am I allowed to be happy at work?

586
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,439
Carl. Carl. We're staying
with the same menu, right?

587
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,039
I have something really
good planned for tonight.

588
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,519
I'm gonna let you...
It's not sweetbreads.

589
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,679
- You're gonna be able to taste it.
- That may be true.

590
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,279
But we have the most reservations
on a work night since we opened.

591
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,119
- You realise that?
- I know. I was on Twitter.

592
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,959
- Yeah.
- I was promoting the restaurant.

593
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,999
- I was on Twitter.
- What? Yeah, that's another thing.

594
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,679
From now on, before you post
anything online, I OK it. Alright?

595
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,159
The whole reason
everybody's here tonight

596
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,759
is because I called out
Ramsey Michel online

597
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,159
and they're all coming to
watch me stick it in his ass.

598
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,999
Yeah, and you're gonna
twitter an apology

599
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,399
for calling the most respected
critic in Los Angeles an asshole.

600
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,599
- I'm not gonna fucking apologise.
- What do you mean, you're not...

601
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,079
- You see what he wrote about me?
- I don't give a fuck...

602
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,919
- He started it!
- ..what he wrote. I don't care.

603
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,839
You're a cook. You're a chef.

604
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,519
This is what you've been cooking
for years, and it works.

605
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,799
And either you cook the menu that
our customers have come to ex...

606
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,039
- You want me to cook the same food?
- The same exact...

607
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,279
The same food that he ripped apart?
The same guy who's coming tonight?

608
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,879
The restaurant isn't
filled with critics!

609
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,879
It's filled with people
that've been eating your food

610
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,159
for the last 10 years!

611
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,919
So now, suddenly, you're
gonna be an artist.

612
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,519
Well, be an artist
on your own time.

613
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,999
- Listen to me.
- No sweetbreads!

614
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,439
- Listen!
- No calves' brains.

615
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,919
I'm not cooking sweetbreads!
Listen to me.

616
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,039
The kitchen is my domain.
That was our deal.

617
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,879
I don't give a fuck
what the deal was!

618
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,439
The deal is now changed.
Either you stay or you go.

619
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,147
It's up to you. End of discussion.

620
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,239
- We got a full house of people... - Yeah.
- ..who are coming tonight... - Yeah.

621
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,559
- ..To eat my food.
- No, it's not your food, Carl.

622
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,559
It's not your food.

623
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,799
By definition, it's my food
because it's my restaurant.

624
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,119
I pay for the glasses.
I pay for the napkins.

625
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,759
I pay for the spoons.
I pay for Molly's salary.

626
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,239
I pay for your entire
staff's salary, OK?

627
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,519
So you either cook
my menu or Tony can.

628
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,519
Tony, you've been cooking
it half the time anyway.

629
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,704
Tell the truth. Right?

630
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,039
So you're threatening
to fire me now?

631
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,519
Am I threatening to fire you?

632
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,319
No, I'm telling you
what I'm prepared to do

633
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,999
if you don't cook my menu.

634
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,559
Subject closed.

635
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,279
Well, why don't you cook
the menu without a chef

636
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,319
and we see how it goes tonight?

637
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,824
Let's go, Tony. Fuck this.

638
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,064
Tony.

639
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,039
Good luck.

640
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,519
- Oh, no way.
- Good luck, Jack.

641
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,999
- No way, man!
- Martin, Martin.

642
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,719
- No. Hell, no. Come on.
- You stay. Stay.

643
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,799
Martin, come on. Let me
go, buddy. Don't do it.

644
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,799
Don't do it. Just stay.

645
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,189
- Call me. Call me.
- You'd better believe it, yeah.

646
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,541
Tony, you got a full house
tonight. Be a pro, OK?

647
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,559
Let's go! Get the leg on.
Coming up.

648
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,879
Get that lava cake out, table 22.

649
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,519
Bring that shit back.
Bring that shit back.

650
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,510
This is table 22.

651
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,470
Just a moment, please.

652
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,119
No, no, we gotta chiz this.
You didn't chiz it.

653
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,199
Welcome back.

654
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,239
Lovely to see you again,
Mr Michel. Right this way.

655
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,719
Thank you.

656
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,919
- I hope traffic wasn't too bad.
- No, it wasn't.

657
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,919
- 30, I got one.
- Table 30's still missing the risotto.

658
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,946
What's going on with all
these tickets, man?

659
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,199
Yes? How can I help you?

660
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,839
Isn't this, um...

661
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,799
Wasn't this on the menu
last time I... I... I visited?

662
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,959
I believe it was.

663
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,748
I was under the impression that
tonight was gonna somehow be...

664
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,959
be different, more of an event.

665
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,519
I understand.

666
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,959
Is there something we can do
to make you more comfortable?

667
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,959
Um... could I actually...

668
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,199
Could I speak with the chef?
With Chef Casper?

669
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,919
I have a wonderful '09 that I
just opened to let breathe.

670
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,439
- Um...
- If I may?

671
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,999
The last time I was in
Napa, at the vineyard,

672
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,079
they shipped me this
bottle as a gift,

673
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,679
and I've just been waiting
for the right occasion.

674
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,879
That... that's very
generous of you.

675
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,679
Is Chef Casper here?

676
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,182
Unfortunately, he was called away.

677
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,399
Is he coming back?

678
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,079
I'm afraid that was left ambiguous.

679
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,159
I need you out front. They're three
deep in the bar. Get off the phone.

680
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,359
- Please let me do my job.
- Please go to the bar.

681
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,599
- Tony!
- Carl, I can't talk right now.

682
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,039
- We are in deep weeds.
- This guy's tweeting me.

683
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,519
This guy's calling me out online.
What the fuck are you serving?

684
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,359
I don't know. They're
serving the same shit.

685
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,879
- What's he eating?
- I think he's...

686
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,759
- What course is he on?
- He's...

687
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,839
He's eating the chocolate
lava cake right now.

688
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,079
You just keep him right
where the fuck he is.

689
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,039
- What?!
- I'm parking the car.

690
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,319
- Carl, what?
- Don't let him leave.

691
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,629
Keep the motherfucker there!

692
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,239
Is he here? Is the
fucker still here?

693
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,559
- Oh, fuck.
- Let's go into the back of the house.

694
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,679
I just wanna say one thing. I just
wanna say one thing. Just one thing.

695
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,399
Let's go to the kitchen.

696
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,239
Stop it. Stop it for a second!

697
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,039
Let's just...

698
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,519
I've been waiting to talk to
this prick for a long time.

699
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,959
- OK.
- I am not cloying. I am not needy.

700
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,439
I don't care what you think.

701
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,546
You're not getting to me.
I'm not needy!

702
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,479
Chocolate lava cake is not just
undercooked chocolate cake.

703
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,982
That's not what makes
the centre molten.

704
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,239
You take a frozen cylinder of ganache
and you set it in the ramekin

705
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,079
so that as the outside cooks
fully, the inside becomes molten!

706
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,799
OK. OK.

707
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,907
It's fucking molten, see?
Its fucking molten, you asshole!

708
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,199
And you don't do anything.
What do you do?

709
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,830
You sit and you eat and you
vomit those words back.

710
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,959
To make people laugh.

711
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,279
You know how hard I
work for this shit?

712
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,828
Do you know how hard
my whole staff works?

713
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,479
What sacrifices I make
to make you happy

714
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,079
and then you just smugly just
fucking shit on my shit?

715
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,799
OK.

716
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,479
- It hurts!
- Yes.

717
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,119
It fucking hurts when
you write that shit!

718
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,159
- It hurt you.
- It does. It does.

719
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,279
He was... He thought you were gonna
close his fucking restaurant down!

720
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,509
You asshole!

721
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,719
And what do you? You just
write shit to make...

722
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,599
You just make shit up!
It was molten!

723
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,239
It's fucking molten!

724
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,719
Asshole!

725
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,519
- You're not getting to me.
- OK. OK.

726
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,559
- You're not getting to me!
- OK, Carl.

727
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,239
- He's not getting to me!
- No, he's not.

728
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,199
I know, but you're a publicist.
Don't you have relationships?

729
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,919
Isn't that what you're hired to do?
To take these things off the internet?

730
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,399
But it's out there.

731
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,199
Even if I could persuade one
site to pull down one clip,

732
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,039
there are a dozen others
from other cell phones.

733
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,919
What should we... should
we at least lawyer up

734
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,639
and threaten legal
action or something?

735
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,759
You threatening them with
lawyers builds on a story

736
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,239
that's already getting
a lot of play.

737
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,919
And then you get another
week of headlines.

738
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,079
And then you got this food critic
posting fresh blogs about you nonstop.

739
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,399
And they're all getting picked
up, and the picked-up headlines

740
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,959
are getting picked
up by each other.

741
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,679
You know, it's
absolutely unbelievable.

742
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,119
- So...
- I've never seen anything like...

743
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,119
Wait a second... you're saying
there's nothing I could do?

744
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,319
To get the footage down?
No, that lives forever.

745
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,799
Great. Awesome.

746
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,239
But there just might be
an opportunity here.

747
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,359
How can this possibly
be an opportunity?

748
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,559
Well, I was holding
off until we spoke,

749
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,799
but I'm fairly certain we have
a good shot at 'Hell's Kitchen'.

750
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,079
- Wait, what?
- The reality show.

751
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,119
I don't think you understand
what's going on here.

752
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,839
I'm a real chef with...

753
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,839
- You said you needed money, right?
- A job.

754
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,319
A job, not money.
I need a job, like I had.

755
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,439
Well, your Twitter account says
you've got 20,000 followers.

756
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,519
- That's pretty damn big.
- Yeah, I'm gonna cancel the account.

757
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,999
- Don't worry.
- Don't cancel it!

758
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,999
I can get you money to
mention a few products.

759
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,439
Are you listening? I don't wanna
get involved with any of that.

760
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,399
- I wanna cook food.
- You got two choices.

761
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,119
You can either lean into it
and work it for all it's worth...

762
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,839
Like Honey Boo Boo.
I don't want that.

763
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,799
You know how much she
pulls down? Or her mother?

764
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,719
I don't care what she makes.
Get to your point.

765
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,519
Or go underground and wait till the
storm passes. You got two choices.

766
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,319
I thought this shit
lives forever online.

767
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,439
It does, but there's so much
news out there and it's so fast

768
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,439
and there's so much white noise,
nobody remembers anything.

769
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,479
OK, thank you for taking the time
and walking me through everything.

770
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,959
It was very illuminating.

771
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,679
Oh, you're hanging up? OK, listen.

772
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,599
I want you to call any time.
I'm right here.

773
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,559
If you can't get me, I'm on a
cell phone and I've got a pager.

774
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,799
- OK. Thank you, and thank Inez for me.
- No, thank you.

775
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,399
- And what about 'Hell's Kitchen'?
- What about it?

776
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,199
- You still want me to pursue it, right?
- No, I don't want you to.

777
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,799
- OK, I won't call 'em, but I'll email.
- Are you not listening to...

778
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,119
I'm gonna go, OK?
I got a call coming in.

779
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,941
OK. Alright. I'll tell you
how 'Hell's Kitchen' goes.

780
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,919
Fucking idiot.

781
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,990
Oh, man.

782
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,999
- Hey, Inez.
- Hi.

783
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,999
- Did you talk to Jen?
- Yeah, I just got off with her.

784
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,159
- And?
- And, uh, you know, it's terrible.

785
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,039
What do you want me to
tell you? I just wanna cook.

786
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,079
Everything is going to work out.

787
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,719
Half-a-dozen places tried to poach
me when I was back at Gauloises.

788
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,719
I'm trying to line up some
interviews for next week.

789
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,839
That's good.

790
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,879
Yeah, so, listen, until this
whole job thing works out,

791
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,667
could you keep Percy for me?

792
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,063
But you're still taking him
with you to New Orleans, right?

793
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,870
Is he there?

794
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,439
I'll tell him.

795
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,559
Ah, let me... let me talk to him.

796
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,550
Put him on.

797
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,839
Hey, Dad. I understand if
we can't go to New Orleans.

798
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,279
Oh, man, thank you so
much for saying that.

799
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,799
Just Daddy's so busy with work
right now. You're the best.

800
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,759
Maybe some other time.

801
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,343
Yes, we will, for sure. Thank you.

802
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,268
'Bye.

803
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,479
Oh, jefecito.

804
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,399
What's up, man? Look,
everybody. Jefe's here.

805
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,439
Come on, give me some drinks.
Something premium.

806
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,783
Ketel One for the man.

807
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,199
Oh, dude. Oh, you're everywhere.

808
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,679
- You saw it?
- Ohh!

809
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,599
- It's bad. How bad is it?
- You saw it? You saw it?

810
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,079
- I saw it. It's everywhere.
- It's terrible.

811
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,879
- Is it bad?
- You're never gonna work again.

812
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,679
I am, though.

813
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,319
No, seriously, there are people...
there are people who are calling me.

814
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,719
- Dude. Oh, great. I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes. Yes.

815
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,719
I knew you would have
something bigger than this.

816
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,519
- You don't care about coming back here.
- Yeah.

817
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,119
So you came back to tell
me you got me a gig?

818
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,599
'Cause I'll leave Gauloises
like that, baby.

819
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,239
No. Trust me, the first phone call
as soon as something becomes real.

820
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,839
- Don't leave me behind again.
- I will not.

821
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,439
- Don't ever do that again.
- Don't hit me.

822
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,039
- This guy.
- Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.

823
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,959
I'm really sorry.
I was on the spot, bro.

824
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,759
I had been drinking that day. I...
I... I didn't know what to do.

825
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,759
- I'm a pussy, basically. I'm sorry.
- It's OK. It's over.

826
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,999
- I vouch for that.
- It's fine. What are you gonna do?

827
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,239
- It's a big opport...
- But then they put you on YouTube.

828
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,959
And I felt so responsible
for that shit.

829
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,319
- That shit was funny, by the way.
- What was funny about it?

830
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,039
- It's not funny for me.
- Just that everybody I know saw it.

831
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,919
- I know, I know.
- I kinda felt famous by knowing you.

832
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,279
Is it a little bit funny? Like... Like, is it...
they're laughing at me or with me?

833
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,319
A little bit of both.

834
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,999
They're laughing with you and
at you at the same time.

835
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,559
- It's so embarrassing.
- Oh, it is terrible. It is so bad.

836
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,159
But it's funny too
at the same time.

837
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,159
It makes you kind of
likeable in a weird way.

838
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,319
Yeah. That guy deserved it. Everybody
knows that guy deserved it.

839
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,239
- But, seriously, I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

840
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,839
You know, I'm gonna
land on my feet.

841
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,279
- Oh, you will.
- Yeah, good. I know.

842
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,239
- I'll get my next gig.
- I'll be there with you.

843
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,199
- Everything will be fine.
- I'm your sous-chef now and forever.

844
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,599
You're not my sous-chef anymore.
You are chef de cuisine.

845
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,519
- But I wouldn't even be there...
- It doesn't matter.

846
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,239
Riva's right about one thing.

847
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,879
You are ready to run your
own kitchen. So don't blow it.

848
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,359
It's a big opportunity for you.

849
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,799
- To Tony's big new opportunity.
- To Tony's big opportunity.

850
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,159
- To chef de cuisine.
- I don't like how it happened.

851
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,719
- But I'm happy it happened. OK?
- Two words, man.

852
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,348
You guys. I love you fucking guys.

853
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,439
- I love you, Tony. I love you.
- Thanks, Chef.

854
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,999
- Look at that.
- Mmm.

855
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,839
I love both of you.

856
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,319
We love you, man.

857
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,959
Let's have a three-way right here.
Come on. Come on.

858
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,559
- Hang on, hang on.
- I love you, man.

859
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,159
- I'm glad you made up with him.
- Thanks. Did you take the garbage out?

860
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,479
The truth of the matter
is nobody's calling me.

861
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,439
I got no job prospects whatsoever.

862
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,839
- What about those offers you got?
- No. It's all dried out.

863
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,239
- Why, from the online shit?
- It must be from the online thing.

864
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,119
- Come on.
- I'm like a fucking cat playing a piano.

865
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,639
I don't even know what that means.

866
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,319
I'm everywhere.

867
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,659
OK? Like, I'm, like...
I'm, like, a meme.

868
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,679
Know what a meme is?
I'm a meme. I'm a fucking meme.

869
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,719
Carl, you need to take a break.

870
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,079
I've been on a break.
I've had too much of a break.

871
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,079
- No, you need a real break.
- I need to work.

872
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,319
- I need to get back into a kitchen.
- You don't. Carl...

873
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,079
I wish I never... I should've cooked
the shit he wanted me to cook.

874
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,839
You gonna go work for another
Riva in some other restaurant?

875
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,559
You've been miserable here as
long as I've known you, Carl.

876
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,999
- That's not true. We've had a blast.
- Yes, we've had a blast.

877
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,343
And now it's time for you to go.

878
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,839
You don't belong here anymore.
You know it. Come on.

879
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,639
What's th... Who's this girl?

880
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,869
- Carl.
- What?

881
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,199
- Be real with me.
- I am.

882
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,199
You've been ignoring a lot
of things in your life

883
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,509
that need your
attention, like Percy.

884
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,919
I'm not dad material right
now, if you hadn't noticed.

885
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,119
I'm embarrassing.

886
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,359
He sees all this shit
on the computer.

887
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,679
- Well...
- His friends have...

888
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,479
Maybe it's important for you
to talk to him about it, then.

889
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,439
- I just...
- He needs you, Carl.

890
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,599
I'm... I don't know him, OK?
He's at a weird age.

891
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,421
Why don't you take this
time to get to know him?

892
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,189
I want you to be happy.

893
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,470
You're not happy.

894
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,110
You're never gonna be happy here.

895
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,710
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

896
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,599
I've never not known what I was
gonna do. I've always known.

897
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,199
There's always been
the next thing to do.

898
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,879
And now that it's all ended, and I'm,
like... I'm, like, fucking lost.

899
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,621
I think that's a
good place to start.

900
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,270
Come here.

901
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,549
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

902
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,719
- I'll hold down the fort. I promise.
- OK. You do that.

903
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,745
Thank you.

904
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,279
Hi, Flora. Percy here?

905
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,119
Percy aqui?

906
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,999
- He's inside.
- Can you tell him I'm here?

907
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,479
- Sure.
- Thanks.

908
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,159
- Hi.
- Why are you here?

909
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,399
I'm here to see...
here to see Percy.

910
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,879
- Oh.
- It's been a while.

911
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,919
I'm glad you're here, but why didn't
you call to say that you were coming?

912
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,479
- I don't know, because...
- He said he's sleeping.

913
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,879
- OK. I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, wait one second.

914
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,119
She said he says he's sleeping,
but if he was sleeping,

915
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,959
she'd just say he's sleeping,
so he's not sleeping.

916
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,319
- Let me talk to him.
- Can you talk to me for one second first?

917
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,902
Please? Come.

918
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,625
Percy and I are going to
Miami to see my father.

919
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,199
So why don't you come with us?

920
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,639
- What?
- Yeah, come with us.

921
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,439
You want me to go... I can't
come with you to Miami.

922
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,239
I don't... I got all...

923
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,919
I don't have any money.

924
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,719
I need to wait for another job,
for all this shit to blow over

925
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,199
with the internet,
Twitter, all that shit.

926
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,359
Yeah, but I could lend you
some money before you...

927
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,599
I don't want your money.
I can't take charity from you.

928
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,079
You know that he's really upset

929
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,106
because he couldn't go with
you to New Orleans, right?

930
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,140
He's hurt. He misses you.

931
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,119
OK. What do you want me to do?

932
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,559
You know that the nannies
can't get on the plane.

933
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,399
So why don't you come with us

934
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,346
and you take care of
him while I work?

935
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,079
So you need me to come
with you to watch Percy?

936
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,159
- Yeah.
- So I'm the nanny?

937
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,311
Yes, his nanny, in Miami.

938
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,399
It might be good. That's where
it all happened for you.

939
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,879
That's where Percy was born,

940
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,319
that's where you got your
first job as a chef.

941
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,039
Maybe it will just, like,
clear your mind out.

942
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,319
You think Percy would
be OK with that?

943
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,079
Percy would love it.

944
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,710
Hm?

945
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,710
What do you say?

946
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,599
I have to run out for
a quick meeting,

947
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,839
so make sure when you go upstairs
that everything is pressed,

948
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,239
order him some food, make sure
he takes a nap, a bath...

949
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,239
- Wait, wait, wait, a nap?
- Get him ready for tonight.

950
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,159
- I'm 10.
- It's gonna be a long night.

951
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,919
We're gonna see Abuelito play.

952
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,039
- Where? At Hoy Como Ayer?
- Mm-hm.

953
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,279
- Isn't he a little young for that?
- Too young for what?

954
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,759
He's not gonna perform forever.

955
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,759
He wants his grandson to see
him play at least once.

956
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,599
Alright, well, better
keep an eye on him.

957
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,599
- That place could get pretty crazy.
- Me keep an eye?

958
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,704
That's why you're going too.

959
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,159
- Where are we?
- This is Little Havana.

960
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,839
- Like in 'Grand Theft Auto'?
- No, this is where I grew up.

961
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,319
- You did?
- Yes.

962
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,599
And this is where
Abuelito lives and works.

963
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,999
Grandpa still works?
What does he do?

964
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,029
I can't see.

965
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,119
- Eh, no, Papa.
- What did he say?

966
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,359
No, he's asking if
we're back together.

967
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,519
No, no, we're friends. I'm
helping watch the baby.

968
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,599
Wait, what's he...
I don't understand.

969
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,159
He said that you look like
you've gained a couple of pounds

970
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,799
since he saw you last.

971
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,279
Maybe since last
time, I understand,

972
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,119
but, actually, recently,
I'm down 15 pounds.

973
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,079
- 20?
- He's saying that he lost 20 pounds.

974
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,079
- 20.
- I know what he said. But I'm down...

975
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,359
That is in two months. I'm down...
In two weeks, I've lost 15.

976
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,942
My suit doesn't even
fit me anymore.

977
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,639
He's saying his pants might fall.

978
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,119
20 pounds. 20.

979
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,759
Why does he have to say 20?
I say 15, he says 20.

980
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,479
I could... Alright.

981
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,239
These are really good. We should
wake up Percy so he can try one.

982
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,839
He say, "Just let him sleep. It's too late."

983
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,439
No, but he's never had a real Cuban
sandwich. I want him to try it.

984
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,479
He says you should make him one.

985
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,439
I want him to have a real one
from here, from Little Havana.

986
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,919
Abuelo... Everything OK?

987
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,359
This is really good, by the way.

988
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,464
Yours are way better.

989
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,181
You think people would like
this kind of food back home?

990
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,951
- You think people would like it?
- Yeah, it's real food. Why not?

991
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,479
- Maybe I'll talk to Marvin.
- Mm-hm.

992
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,199
Let me hear him out. You know?

993
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,702
See what he's got in
mind for the food truck.

994
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,199
Think he's in town?

995
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,943
I don't know, but, you know, I can
find out tomorrow... I call him.

996
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,319
You know he's here. Is this the
whole reason you brought me out?

997
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,470
I don't know what
you're talking about.

998
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,119
Try this. The yucca's amazing.

999
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,110
I love yucca.

1000
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,670
You're full of shit.

1001
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,479
Hi. I'm Carl Casper.
I'm here to see Marvin.

1002
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,189
- Booties?
- Excuse me?

1003
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,439
In case you don't want
to remove your shoes.

1004
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,624
Thank you.

1005
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,159
- Uh!
- Follow me, please.

1006
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,825
Uhh!

1007
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,959
- Casper's here.
- How ya doing?

1008
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,039
- Glad you're here. Look at you.
- How's it going?

1009
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,519
Come over here.
Candy, come over here.

1010
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,159
You're a sight for sore eyes.

1011
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,639
What you want to eat, something?
I want to see you eat something.

1012
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,079
Alright? I'm worried. Eat
some crackers or something.

1013
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,070
Thanks.

1014
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,639
Look at you.

1015
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,479
She's pregnant. Just found out.

1016
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,519
The... This one?

1017
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,183
Pissed on a stick, came in,
laid it on me five seconds ago.

1018
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,839
Is it... So it's yours?

1019
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,707
I don't know. That's
what she's saying.

1020
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,799
- You don't...
- I know.

1021
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,599
I got a problem, 'cause she's...
best receptionist I've ever had.

1022
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,439
- Yeah.
- Good news is I had my tubes tied in '08.

1023
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,039
So, clearly, she's
also a fucking liar.

1024
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,559
- Right. That's tough.
- What do you want?

1025
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,039
You want a coconut water?

1026
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,759
- Um...
- You OK?

1027
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,319
I'm alright. I'm alright.

1028
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,919
- Do you want a drink?
- I would... No.

1029
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,959
Let's make some decisions
together. Let's start right here.

1030
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,439
- Alright, so...
- Let's start off easy.

1031
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,559
We got shit to talk about. Look,
bang, you got four swatches, right?

1032
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,319
Let's start off easy and then we'll
get into the uncomfortable stuff.

1033
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,199
- Pick it.
- The... For the...

1034
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,959
For here? I don't know.

1035
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,439
Yeah, I'm putting a carpet down,

1036
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,559
'cause people keep slippin' around
like it's a fuckin' ice rink in here.

1037
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,079
You could always get 'em...
take the booties off and, uh...

1038
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,799
Can't do that.

1039
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,399
We'll go with,
I don't know, this one?

1040
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,999
- You like that one?
- I think...

1041
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,399
If I had to... But if you're
not gonna paint, I would...

1042
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,999
This just seems like
it goes with anything.

1043
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,679
People aren't walking
on the walls, Carl.

1044
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,279
Or I could keep it if I want.

1045
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,279
- The...
- Keep the kid.

1046
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,759
- Yeah.
- Knowing that it's not mine.

1047
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,911
- Yes.
- You know, for once, I'm a good guy.

1048
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,439
She stays on my desk and I
fucking got something on her.

1049
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,510
But you decide. What do you think?

1050
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,959
Are we... we're talking
about the carpet now

1051
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,559
or are we talking about
the, um... the...

1052
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,839
- We're talking about...
- I don't even know anymore.

1053
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,599
I think, um...

1054
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,359
I'd go with the brown.

1055
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,159
And as far as that goes,
that's a personal... that's...

1056
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,079
- I don't know.
- You're not a turd, OK?

1057
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,199
I don't want you to feel that way coming
in here with your hat in your hand.

1058
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,639
You went fucking crazy on the
internet. That was awesome.

1059
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,239
You lost respect, which I
love, 'cause it's passion.

1060
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,719
You know, you lost everything.

1061
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,919
You know, you're not a loser,
but you have lost, OK?

1062
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,599
You're not a turd.
A turd that lost.

1063
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,559
I don't know that I
feel like a turd.

1064
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,679
- Good.
- I feel like I had a bad week.

1065
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,919
I feel like I lost my job, I made
an ass of myself on the internet.

1066
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,079
I'm divorced, I'm
old, I got no money.

1067
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,679
I live in a shitty
apartment in Venice.

1068
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,679
But you know what makes
me feel like a turd?

1069
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,399
That I'm in my ex-wife's ex-husband's
office and asking for a fucking favour

1070
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,999
and all he's doing
is busting my balls.

1071
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,741
I like this humility. It's good.

1072
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,159
Truth be told, food trucks are a
great idea. You know what I mean?

1073
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,599
I think we take it back
to something simple.

1074
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,399
Let me see if I got something to
say anymore. I don't even know.

1075
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,879
- It's no problem.
- I'll pay you back.

1076
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,439
As long as it's not weird for you...
I don't want you to feel like

1077
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,079
because you were with Inez and
you guys were sleeping together

1078
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,359
and I was with her
and we had this...

1079
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,679
I was with her, then you were with her,
and then maybe I fucked her after.

1080
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,784
I don't even know what
happened with us.

1081
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,799
I came out to LA for
a Clippers game once

1082
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,599
and I think we had a couple of
drinks and we went to Islands.

1083
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,599
- And I think she had...
- What happened between you two?

1084
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,519
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Here's what happened.

1085
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,079
We're talking about a white-on-white
'88 Chevy Grumman food truck.

1086
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,319
It's a blank canvas
for your dreams.

1087
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,390
I'm gonna have 'em pull it around.

1088
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,799
Thank you.

1089
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,143
Don't thank me till you see it.

1090
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,439
Yeah. I'm in Miami now.

1091
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,359
What happened to those
interviews you had?

1092
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,999
None of the prospects panned out.

1093
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,150
- For real?
- Yeah.

1094
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,119
It sucks.

1095
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,199
I guess you'll have to stay
there for a while, bro.

1096
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,625
Hey, Carl. Hey, papi, mira, I don't
know if you heard or not, but...

1097
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,239
I got bumped up, man, to sous-chef.

1098
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,719
- Sous-chef?
- Yeah.

1099
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,279
No shit! That's excellent!

1100
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,399
Congratulations, man.
That's a big deal.

1101
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,839
Thank you, man. That means a
lot coming from you, seriously.

1102
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,319
Yeah, but enough about me.
So, what are you gonna do?

1103
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,424
You're gonna laugh.

1104
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,399
- I got a food truck.
- Get the hell out!

1105
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,799
No shit. You got a
fucking taco truck?

1106
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,839
Tony! Tony, Carl's got
a fucking taco truck.

1107
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,719
For real?

1108
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,079
- Jefe! Like with tacos and shit?
- I just...

1109
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,599
Yeah, I would assume.
What are you gonna cook?

1110
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,519
You know, Cuban sandwiches,
plátanos, arroz con pollo.

1111
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,519
Simple shit like we used
to do for family meal.

1112
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,959
Oh, yeah, I remember
those days, man.

1113
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,159
- Fuck he doing with a taco truck?
- Goddamn.

1114
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,119
- I'd love some of that shit now.
- What's he doing with a taco truck?

1115
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,999
- It's good, right? It could be cool.
- Yeah.

1116
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,839
Get the fuck off the
phone, bro. Let's go!

1117
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,439
Alright, alright, alright!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

1118
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,399
Attila the Hun is calling me.
I gotta go, man.

1119
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,311
Alright. Be good, man.

1120
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,959
- Is this the new truck?
- This is it. This is the truck.

1121
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,439
- Ahh!
- It's got good bones.

1122
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,039
It's gonna need a lot
of work, though.

1123
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,719
What doesn't?

1124
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,639
Wanna take a look around, champ?

1125
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,119
- Do I have to?
- Go!

1126
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,999
Go and look at your
dad's new truck.

1127
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,599
Can I ask you a question?

1128
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,319
Is something wrong?

1129
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,599
- Did you sleep with him?
- With who?

1130
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,359
With Marvin. Did you
sleep with Marvin?

1131
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,159
But of course I did.
He's my ex-husband.

1132
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,079
I mean, since we were
divorced. Have you slept...

1133
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,119
Who did you sleep
with last, him or me?

1134
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,519
I'm sorry, but this is none of
your business what I did...

1135
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,359
- I think it might be.
- ..after I divorce you.

1136
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,919
Second of all, I don't ask you what
you do with your hot little waitress.

1137
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,359
- That's completely different.
- OK, really.

1138
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,799
- And that's not fair.
- Yeah, yeah.

1139
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,839
This is somebody you loved
and shared a life with...

1140
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,839
Why do we have to talk
about this right now?

1141
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,679
Because I took a business
meeting with the guy.

1142
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,919
- This is not the moment.
- It is. I wanna know why.

1143
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,639
He's smiling like he's
got something on me.

1144
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,439
- I dunno what it is.
- Please, you know him.

1145
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,039
- I do know how him.
- You know how he is. So who cares?

1146
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,519
- I care!
- Why do you need to know?

1147
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,599
- I just would like to...
- OK.

1148
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,239
It doesn't bother me.
I just wanna know.

1149
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,999
Just listen. I was very sad.
I was very lonely.

1150
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,239
- And you, more than anyone, know...
- OK. That's it. That's enough.

1151
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,279
how I get after I have
a couple of drinks.

1152
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,119
- I don't want to know the details.
- I get...

1153
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,559
Please. I'm not one
of your girlfriends.

1154
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,359
- Don't tell me. Stop talking.
- He was my first.

1155
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,919
- OK, the kid's here.
- It came out like a natural, organic thing.

1156
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,343
- I don't want to know about this.
- We didn't...

1157
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,389
We didn't go through with it.

1158
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,351
Sat there and we realised
we're just good friends.

1159
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,679
I think there's something
dead in there.

1160
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,239
Uhh. OK, go and look for it.
Maybe it's a rat.

1161
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,039
- Let's go look for the rat.
- I have to work, and I'll be back.

1162
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,879
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- You're going? No, no, no.

1163
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,319
You can't leave.

1164
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,159
You said you were
going to help me, OK?

1165
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,599
Go work with your dad. It's fun.

1166
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,626
I'll be back later. 'Bye.

1167
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,639
Alright. Take that bucket, fill it.

1168
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,744
- See the hose?
- Mm-hm.

1169
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,279
Trash, trash, trash.

1170
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,839
Save that, save that.

1171
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,024
Save the metal ones.

1172
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,679
Ugh!

1173
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,826
Tip it over.

1174
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,150
Alright, buddy.

1175
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,879
I got some presents for you.

1176
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,870
Watch this.

1177
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,719
Steel wool, right?

1178
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,359
- Mm-hm.
- Scrub brush. Right?

1179
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,431
I want you to do that
on the whole truck.

1180
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,319
Hey, buddy, you don't have to
clean that. We're throwing it out.

1181
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,310
Alright? Clean something else.

1182
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,319
Alright, that looks good.
Clean out the lowboy now.

1183
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,799
- The what?
- The low...

1184
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,985
The reach-in fridge,
right here. Clean this out.

1185
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,559
Ohh! That's it.

1186
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,919
That's where the smell's
coming from. What is that?

1187
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,422
I don't know. Whatever
it is, clean it out.

1188
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,199
- Ohh...
- What the hell are you doing?

1189
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,959
- You told me to clean it out.
- Not throw it in the garbage.

1190
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,359
That's a perfectly good
hotel pan. Scrub it out.

1191
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,759
No, that's gross! I'm
not cleaning that out.

1192
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,919
- Pick it out of the garbage.
- Are you kidding?

1193
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,919
- It's disgusting.
- You don't throw it in the garbage.

1194
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,559
Like we saved the rest of
the stuff. Let's just clean it out.

1195
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,359
No.

1196
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,589
- Pick it out of the trash.
- No.

1197
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,784
Pick it out of the trash can.

1198
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,239
You wanted to work in a kitchen.

1199
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,359
This is what working
in a kitchen is, OK?

1200
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,759
- We don't throw shit out.
- Yeah, I wanted to come and cook.

1201
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,639
- Not clean it!
- Pick it out of the garbage!

1202
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,359
No! I cleaned your
whole stupid truck!

1203
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,464
Why are you so mean to me?!

1204
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,391
Hey, I can't get a
hold of your mom.

1205
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,719
But you... The truck looks great.

1206
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,719
You did a great job.
I'm sorry I was mean.

1207
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,949
That wasn't right of me.

1208
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,039
I gotta pick up some
equipment for the truck.

1209
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,719
You wanna come with me and help me
pick out a stove till Mom calls back?

1210
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,239
Fine.

1211
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,359
Alright. Let's go.

1212
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,959
You know what this is?

1213
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,999
- French fries?
- That's right, a fryer.

1214
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,399
This is the one we need right
here. Come on, let's go.

1215
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,879
Double convection oven underneath.
It's a real workhorse.

1216
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,919
60 inches. I think we could fit them
on the truck. What do you think?

1217
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,199
- Let's get it.
- Let's get this one. Good. Done.

1218
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,919
This is the... Ah,
here's what we need.

1219
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,919
This is the thing I was
looking for. Right there.

1220
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,959
- A George Foreman grill?
- That's not a George Foreman grill.

1221
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,959
It's called a plancha. We make
Cuban sandwiches on that.

1222
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,239
This is the key to our entire
livelihood. We need two of these.

1223
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,719
Looks good. You know what?

1224
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,839
Let's also get the 6-inch chef's
knife with the plastic handle.

1225
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,184
- Then you need also the holder.
- Yeah, let's get a cover as well.

1226
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,750
OK, you see this, Percy?

1227
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,919
That's a chef's knife.

1228
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,439
A real chef's knife.

1229
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,022
It's not a toy. You understand?

1230
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,439
This thing's sharp. It can send you
to the hospital if you're not careful.

1231
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,590
I'll teach you how
to use this thing.

1232
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,039
But a chef's knife, it belongs
to the chef, not to the kitchen.

1233
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,719
So it's your responsibility to keep
it sharp, clean, not to lose it.

1234
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,348
- Can you handle that?
- Yes.

1235
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,679
This is a good knife.

1236
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,079
It'll last you a long time
if you take care of it.

1237
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,079
Don't lose it.

1238
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,947
I won't. Thank you.

1239
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,990
You earned it.

1240
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,119
How are we gonna
get it in the truck?

1241
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,639
Well, Marvin said we could use
some of his guys to help out.

1242
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,439
Hey, guys! Hello?

1243
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,830
I'm Carl. This is my truck.

1244
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,919
I need some help moving
this equipment in.

1245
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,388
Marvin said that you
guys might help me.

1246
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,503
I got it. Mind if I borrow this?

1247
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,469
Get to the top floor.

1248
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,508
Maybe a little higher?

1249
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,719
The hard part was getting
it over to the truck,

1250
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,745
and now we just have to tip.

1251
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,759
If I can get one end
up on the tailgate.

1252
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,239
OK.

1253
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,839
Oh, hey, hey. Don't do that. You're
gonna rupture something, man.

1254
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,439
- Hey!
- Martin!

1255
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,999
Hey, killer, what's up? How you
doing, little gangster, huh?

1256
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,639
- What the hell you doing here?
- I warned you, man. I warned you.

1257
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,079
If you got another gig, I was gonna drop
everything to be your line cook. Didn't I?

1258
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,919
This is a food truck.
You're a sous-chef now.

1259
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,799
So? Food trucks don't
need a sous-chef?

1260
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,039
OK, fine. You're hired.
Pays nothing.

1261
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,519
- I'll take it.
- Nice!

1262
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,519
- You're not gonna scare me, buddy.
- Thank you so much.

1263
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,319
You must've jumped on a plane
as soon as we got off the phone.

1264
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,079
Dude, when I heard your voice,
I was like, "That's what I wanna do."

1265
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,799
- I'm so happy you're here.
- Me too, man.

1266
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,799
- We're trying to get this in the truck.
- Yeah?

1267
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,559
I need some sort of,
like, lever and fulcrum.

1268
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,039
Come on, everybody.
Everybody together. Come on.

1269
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,759
Holy sh... No, we can't do this.

1270
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,439
No way, not without one of us
hurting ourselves. No, no, no, don't.

1271
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,039
Stop. Stop. I got it, I got it.

1272
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,639
Carl, easy.

1273
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,999
- It's good to know Spanish.
- You gotta, man.

1274
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,709
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

1275
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,519
- Ah!
- OK, good.

1276
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,999
- Nice.
- Fryer next?

1277
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,479
No, no, forget the
freaking fryer, man.

1278
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,959
I'm gonna fill up
the propane tanks,

1279
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,839
you go to the market...
get cerveza, not beer.

1280
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,439
I can't go to the market. We gotta hook
up the fryer. Get rid of the steam pit.

1281
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,479
No, by the time you get back, I'll
have this all spotless and cleaned up.

1282
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,919
I got lots of marinating to do.

1283
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,919
I promised these people the
best sandwich of their lives.

1284
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,359
- OK. Good. So...
- Get me the mojo.

1285
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,199
OK, so, what do you need?
Oranges, onion, garlic.

1286
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,599
That's right. Why don't we
juice it up a little bit, huh?

1287
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,079
- Tomatillo.
- Some chillies, yeah. Cilantro.

1288
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,679
- Now get the hell outta here.
- Let's go.

1289
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,279
OK, look, the key is, you
gotta look for ingredients

1290
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,359
and then that gives you
ideas of what to cook.

1291
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,159
Like, this is yucca, right?

1292
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,919
Get some of that. Those
look great. See that?

1293
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,639
And... Oh, come here.

1294
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,399
You know what this is?

1295
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,959
Uh, bananas?

1296
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,079
That's called a plantain. Plátanos.

1297
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,759
These are maduros. Feel, soft?

1298
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,519
- Mm-hm.
- That's the sweet kind.

1299
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,199
But we want the green ones.
Here. Hang onto this.

1300
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,039
This is what you
make tostones with.

1301
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,919
That's Martin's favourite.

1302
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,799
- I got it. I got it.
- You got it? Too much?

1303
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,559
- I got it.
- OK.

1304
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,919
- Watch out for tarantulas. Come on.
- What?

1305
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,079
Ahh! That's good.

1306
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,559
Oh, look at that.

1307
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,959
Oh, yeah. My masterpiece, baby.

1308
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,679
- That's beautiful.
- Miami, I am back. Pow!

1309
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,502
You could have just bought this at
the store. I think they sold it there.

1310
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,239
- You sure that's your son, man?
- I don't know.

1311
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,719
You'd better get a paternity test.

1312
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,145
- Oh, that looks incred...
- Can I have some?

1313
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,919
Oh, Martin.

1314
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,799
- Please, just gimme some.
- It's not from the store.

1315
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,199
- You might not like it.
- It's fatty but not heavy, you know?

1316
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,999
- You don't want any of this.
- Yes, I do.

1317
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,959
- You're probably vegan. You can't eat it.
- I'm not vegan.

1318
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,559
- It's not from the store.
- Oh, my God.

1319
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,239
- Martin, come on. Can I have some?
- Hold on a second.

1320
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,599
- Can I give him a piece, Martin?
- Nah, man, he's not...

1321
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,501
- Alright. Let me think about it.
- Just a little piece. Let's see.

1322
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,079
- Pretty good.
- Pretty good?

1323
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,919
- Pretty good? Come on!
- Better than the store?

1324
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,439
One more. Just one more.

1325
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,799
The best shit you ever had
in your life. Come on, man.

1326
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,559
Oh, give me another one. If you're
gonna give him some, give me some.

1327
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,959
- Don't be cheap.
- I want more.

1328
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,399
You know what? Let's
make some sandwiches.

1329
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,141
- Yes, sir. Let's get to it.
- Alright. Ready to go?

1330
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,519
Hey, little man, is
the plancha red-hot?

1331
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,039
- Huh?
- Me?

1332
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,508
No, I'm talking to the grill.
Yeah, you.

1333
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,079
- Do I touch it?
- Well, what do you think?

1334
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,479
- No.
- That's right. No, genius.

1335
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,239
Hey, look. Come over here, look.

1336
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,799
- See this water?
- Mm-hm.

1337
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,279
- Bang. Is it hot?
- Yes.

1338
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,359
- Tell him it's hot.
- It's hot.

1339
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,479
- OK.
- Is it hot as your daddy's underwear?

1340
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,959
Good. Now, watch. Come over here.

1341
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,799
Here we go, papi.
Perfect. Perfecto.

1342
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,639
Now, watch me.
Watch what I'm doing.

1343
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,199
Two slices of ham, three of pork.

1344
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,999
- Now come over here.
- Now the maestro.

1345
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,639
Two slices of cheese... one, two.

1346
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,879
- Two pickles.
- Can I do pickles?

1347
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,759
Big pickles. Nice. One, two.

1348
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,519
Now, watch this. Take this...
mustard, from end to end.

1349
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,839
OK.

1350
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,679
You go side to side,
not forward and back.

1351
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,559
Now, this is the
most important part.

1352
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,719
- This is what makes it a Cubano.
- OK.

1353
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,519
- Take the butter. See that?
- Yeah.

1354
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,399
On top. Take a little bit.

1355
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,839
Butter the grill.

1356
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,839
In. Just like that.

1357
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,799
Now, watch.

1358
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,039
I want you to watch for
the bread to get golden.

1359
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,959
I want you to watch for
the cheese to melt.

1360
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,359
When that cheese is melted and that
bread's golden, but not burnt,

1361
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,759
you call me, you tell me it's
done and we'll check, OK?

1362
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,830
- OK.
- Keep an eye on it.

1363
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,559
I want you to watch
everything everybody's doing,

1364
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,719
because when we're hopping, you're
gonna have to jump in on the line

1365
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,199
and help out.

1366
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,101
- I think it's done.
- You think it's done?

1367
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,599
- Oh, look at that.
- See how golden that is?

1368
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,439
- That's how you want it every time.
- Nice job.

1369
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,679
You gotta be like a robot
when you're on a line.

1370
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,119
You're the shit, baby.
You're the shit.

1371
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,119
OK?

1372
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,199
Mmm! Three equal pieces.

1373
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,399
- Let's see what we got.
- Alright, here we go.

1374
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,799
- Oh, hot.
- Ah. Let me see.

1375
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,519
Look at that cheese.

1376
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,799
- Oh, my God, man.
- This is the shit.

1377
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,599
- This is it.
- Oh!

1378
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,159
- This is it.
- This is it.

1379
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:11,039
- It's incredible.
- This is empingao.

1380
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,519
- Oh, empingao!
- Empingao, man.

1381
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,279
- So, is it good?
- It's amazing.

1382
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,399
Then I guess we're open.

1383
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,982
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. We're open?

1384
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,159
I didn't get to finish my sandwich.

1385
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,319
- Here you go.
- What do I do?

1386
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,959
Cut the bread.

1387
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,439
There's cerveza down there.

1388
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,519
Little man, get me hazelnuts,
get me some more ham.

1389
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,039
OK.

1390
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,519
Alright, I got four right here.

1391
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,279
Hey, jefe, this sound
system sounds like ass.

1392
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,279
But my cousin knows a guy who'll hook
us up with all our musical necessities.

1393
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,919
My credit cards are maxed out and
we're not charging for food yet.

1394
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,679
- So we'll wait on the sound system.
- But you look happy, baby, don't you?

1395
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,919
- So happy. So happy.
- Yeah, that's what's champing it.

1396
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,399
Uh-huh!

1397
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,599
- I got one.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1398
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,119
- That's burnt.
- So?

1399
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,359
They're not paying for it.

1400
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,759
Come with me. Get off the truck.

1401
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,999
- You got this?
- Yeah, I got it. You get down.

1402
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,264
Slow down for a second.

1403
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,319
- Is this boring to you?
- No, I like it.

1404
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,799
Yeah, well, I love it.

1405
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,519
Everything good that's happened to
me in my life came because of that.

1406
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,359
I might not do everything
great in my life, OK?

1407
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,439
I'm not perfect. I'm
not the best husband.

1408
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,181
And I'm sorry if I
wasn't the best father.

1409
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,590
But I'm good at this.

1410
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,719
And I wanna share this with you.

1411
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,959
I wanna teach you what I learned.

1412
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,145
I get to touch people's
lives with what I do.

1413
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,182
And it keeps me
going, and I love it.

1414
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,479
And I think if you give it a
shot, you might love it too.

1415
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,470
Yes, Chef.

1416
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,959
Now, should we have
served that sandwich?

1417
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,189
No, Chef.

1418
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,399
That's my son. Get back in there.
We got some hungry people.

1419
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,390
He's ready to cook!

1420
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,199
- We did good, man.
- We did good.

1421
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,599
- We got something here.
- I say we stick with the traditional menu.

1422
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,599
- We don't get too fancy.
- We'll get some yucca fries.

1423
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,639
- We got the fryer.
- That's classic. Another beer, boss?

1424
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,744
- No, I'm good.
- Alright.

1425
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,719
Here you go, little man.

1426
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,710
You sure?

1427
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,919
Is this beer?

1428
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,919
No, of course not. I would
never hand you beer.

1429
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,639
- That's cerveza.
- I'm 10. I can't have beer.

1430
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,679
You're not 10. You're kitchen staff.
Kitchen staff doesn't have an age.

1431
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,759
Dad?

1432
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,750
You can have a sip.

1433
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,479
Huh?

1434
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,079
- Like piss, right?
- Worse.

1435
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,079
You remember that when your
friends offer you a beer.

1436
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,679
- I figure we go to South Beach...
- Mm-hm.

1437
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,959
stake out the truck a little
bit, get the menu straight.

1438
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,919
Then after we're really confident
we got something good,

1439
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,399
then we drive back to LA.

1440
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,279
And hit a few extra
cities on the way?

1441
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,759
Why not?

1442
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,879
- Can I come?
- Can you come?

1443
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,639
- Come where?
- On the trip.

1444
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,639
This isn't a trip. We're
just driving the truck back.

1445
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,119
You're flying first class with
Mommy with all the divorce money.

1446
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,079
Yeah, but you're
stopping in cities.

1447
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,628
- Yeah, but you got school.
- I'm on break.

1448
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,599
I don't know.

1449
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,439
Martin, I like your mojo.

1450
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,479
- Hey, don't work me.
- Oh, you hitting Martin?

1451
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,319
- You're working Martin?
- Working me like that.

1452
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,159
- He's ice-cold.
- He knows my soft spot, though.

1453
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,639
He likes your mojo.

1454
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,479
- He got me, man.
- We'll talk to your mom.

1455
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,159
- We'll see what she says.
- I already did.

1456
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,839
- She's cool with it.
- Look at that.

1457
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,439
He's not... He's 10,
he's got a phone.

1458
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,759
Good for you. Good for
you, man. Get things done.

1459
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,239
Why not? Why not? Bring him along.

1460
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,239
So I'm going?

1461
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,239
Yeah.

1462
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,479
- Yeah, you can come.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

1463
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,664
Go by the backhoe.

1464
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,639
You want me to take
a poop over there?

1465
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,119
Hey, Carl. Carl, check it out.

1466
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,719
I'll drop you guys
off at the hotel,

1467
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,119
and in the morning, you go get
the rest of the ingredients,

1468
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,719
stock up on stuff, and I'll
put a coat of paint on this.

1469
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,719
Don't bother painting. We'll
paint it when we get back.

1470
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,959
- It looks fine like this.
- No, man. This is on me.

1471
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,199
My cousin knows a guy. I'm
gonna hook it up. Alright?

1472
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,679
OK.

1473
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,279
Who's hungry? Huh?

1474
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,079
If you change your mind, you call
me and I'll go get you anywhere.

1475
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,344
Come on. Let's sell
sandwiches, baby!

1476
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,959
- OK, call me.
- Come on, buddy.

1477
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,119
Cuidado.

1478
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,224
- Call me.
- I will.

1479
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,439
Alright, buddy, I need
you to get me a crowd.

1480
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,239
- Yes, Chef. You know it.
- Alright.

1481
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,119
Step right up.

1482
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,839
Best Cuban food in
all of South Beach.

1483
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,479
Come on, don't be afraid. Step up!

1484
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:25,279
If you need it more authentic,
you can swim 90 miles that way.

1485
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,839
If you can pronounce
it, we can make it.

1486
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,959
Arroz con pollo, yuca frita.

1487
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,599
OK, four media noches coming up.

1488
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,319
Cubano.

1489
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,159
- You got it?
- I got four ready over here.

1490
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,719
- Yucca fries, plantas was you?
- Yeah.

1491
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,559
Here we go. Thank you.
Thanks for your patience.

1492
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,959
- Who needs a little bit more?
- We got four Cubano all day.

1493
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,959
- Four Cubano all day.
- Hey, this one's not ready, OK?

1494
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,959
- I'm buttering that one.
- I got it. I got it.

1495
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,439
- Crap!
- Yucca!

1496
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,039
- One frites for you.
- I burned my finger.

1497
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,519
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

1498
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,119
- You wanna keep going or stop?
- Keep going.

1499
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,759
- OK, keep going, keep going.
- Go, little man.

1500
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,639
Help him with that banana
ketchup and yucca fries.

1501
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,119
Go with the chile,
the chile vinegar.

1502
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,079
- Good job.
- Hold on one second.

1503
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,639
- It's coming.
- Is that enough?

1504
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,279
That's perfect. Here you go.

1505
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,987
- How's the yucca frita?
- It's perfect.

1506
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,679
Step aside, step aside.

1507
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,719
Thank you.

1508
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,199
Who's in charge here?

1509
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,719
Um, uh, me. What do you need, sir?

1510
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,719
- I need to talk to you on the side.
- OK.

1511
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,719
- On the side, please. Right away.
- I got you. I got it, I got it.

1512
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,679
Alright, alright. Relax, relax.
Keep it down. Keep it down.

1513
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,199
Hang on, guys. Come on.
Hang on, hang on.

1514
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,759
Hang on, hang on.

1515
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,501
- Need to see a permit.
- Permit, yeah, we got it.

1516
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,679
Should be good.

1517
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,519
Yeah, permit's good. You're just
not good to sell here right now.

1518
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,159
OK, alright. Thank you. So just,
what, a half-mile down the road?

1519
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,639
Yeah. As long as you're not right
on South Beach, you're OK.

1520
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,869
- No problem. Sorry about that.
- Hey...

1521
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,959
Aren't you the lava cake guy?

1522
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,159
- Uh, yeah, from the internet.
- Yeah.

1523
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,679
Yeah.

1524
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,119
My kid and I saw you on 'Tosh.0'.
You were hilarious.

1525
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,439
Thanks. OK, great.

1526
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,839
- That was hilarious.
- OK.

1527
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,879
Hey, can I get a quick
picture with you for my kid?

1528
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,479
- For my kid.
- Sure.

1529
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,159
- Yeah.
- Hey, you know how to work this?

1530
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,559
- Hey, Martin, help me out.
- What is that, a flat-screen TV?

1531
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,461
Hold on a second. Let me
unlock it for you real quick.

1532
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,879
Hang on. We're gonna
move it down the road.

1533
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,479
It's hard to use other
people's technology.

1534
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,479
- Big one.
- Arm around you? Is that good?

1535
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,519
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Alright, how do I... What do I press?

1536
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,359
Just touch the... Tap the
screen first. Hold on.

1537
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,199
- OK.
- Let me make sure it's not on video.

1538
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,999
It's on... Yeah, it's on. And then
put on camera. There we go. Yeah.

1539
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,399
Alright. Get together.

1540
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,239
You have to tap the
centre of the screen,

1541
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,039
and when you see a box, make
sure the box is around our head.

1542
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,519
- OK.
- Whatever you're shooting's in the box.

1543
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,359
- Just take the fucking picture, OK?
- I got it.

1544
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,999
- There we go.
- Thanks. Let's take the...

1545
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,839
Oh, and your finger's
in front of the camera.

1546
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,519
- Sorry, sorry!
- Good. Great.

1547
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,999
- I got it.
- OK. Thank you.

1548
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,479
- Alright. Thank you.
- Thank you, Officer.

1549
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,559
Hey, can I just take a picture
up there in the kitchen?

1550
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,759
- On the truck?
- That'd be great, yeah.

1551
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,159
- Got it.
- And good. OK.

1552
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,199
Can I take one pressing a
sandwich or something?

1553
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,919
- Got it.
- Good? OK.
- Alright.

1554
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,399
Can we do one more where...
with 'Lady and the Tramp'...

1555
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,479
you know, you're biting one
end, I'm biting the other?

1556
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,584
- Come on, you can do this.
- OK.

1557
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,862
You got it? You got it? Go.

1558
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,950
I think I missed the exit.

1559
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,825
Oww!

1560
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,679
What the hell are you doing?
You sending pictures to Mom?

1561
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,959
- I'm posting a Vine.
- A Vine? What's a Vine?

1562
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,319
It's a video. Look.

1563
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,319
Hey, come on, man!
Get that out of my face.

1564
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,639
- Seriously.
- Christ.

1565
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,359
- It's only six seconds.
- Who'd make a video six seconds?

1566
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,639
- A six-second video.
- Can you believe this generation?

1567
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,959
Unbelievable, man.
Little attention. ADHD.

1568
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,919
- ADHD is right.
- That's nothing.

1569
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,359
I've also been shooting these videos...
one second every day.

1570
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,159
One-second videos?
Now you're joking with me.

1571
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,839
No. You edit 'em all together.

1572
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,439
One second of every day.

1573
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,759
And then you cut 'em together
and watch it. It's cool.

1574
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,119
OK, enough with the virtual world.
How about something real?

1575
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,679
Who wants to stop at Disney World?

1576
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,679
- Oh, yeah, I do.
- Disney World? That's real?

1577
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,359
We shouldn't stop till
we hit New Orleans.

1578
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,399
- Hey! Hey, that is your son.
- That's my boy.

1579
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,639
A kid who'd rather go to New
Orleans than Disney World.

1580
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,079
Now I've seen everything.

1581
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,719
I can't wait to try
my first beignet.

1582
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,119
Every other person you say 'New
Orleans' to thinks jazz and voodoo.

1583
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,479
Yeah, he thinks...

1584
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,559
- Your kid thinks doughnuts.
- Doughnuts. Yeah, I know.

1585
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,506
I like that. Alright, New Orleans.

1586
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,439
What are you doing?

1587
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,319
Dude, I'm putting a little
cornstarch on my werewolves, man.

1588
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,839
It's too humid down here.

1589
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,999
Dad. Dad.

1590
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,399
- Wake up.
- What?

1591
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,902
Martin's putting
cornstarch on his balls.

1592
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,719
You putting cornstarch
on your balls?

1593
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,710
Yes, sir.

1594
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,350
Let me get some?

1595
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,799
Want some?

1596
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,790
Here.

1597
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,959
It's like baby powder.

1598
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,505
Put it on your nuts.

1599
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:18,119
- It's nice, right?
- Nice.

1600
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,719
What's good is in the morning,

1601
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,839
you could dip your nuts in
oil and make hushpuppies.

1602
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,719
Alright, come on. Come on.

1603
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,479
Out.

1604
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,679
Alright, backing up.

1605
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,148
Come on, come on.

1606
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,390
OK, watch out, baby-cakes.

1607
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,039
OK.

1608
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,065
Whoo!

1609
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,799
Nice driving skills, huh?

1610
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,799
- I'm getting the hang of this thing.
- I'm telling ya.

1611
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,639
- Alright, I'm taking my kid for a walk.
- Yeah.

1612
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,679
Oh, nice. I get
promoted to sous-chef.

1613
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,679
- But I gotta do all the hard work?
- Yeah. Thanks.

1614
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,359
- Thank you.
- Where are we, Bourbon Street?

1615
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,719
Nah, this is Frenchman Street.
Bourbon's for tourists.

1616
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,109
We're in the Marigny. Come with me.

1617
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,999
- Where we going?
- Just come.

1618
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,865
Come on. French Quarter.

1619
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,466
We're going to Café Du Monde.

1620
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,399
You ever heard of Café Du Monde?

1621
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,902
Is this the beignet place?

1622
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,951
You ready? We drove a
long way for these.

1623
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,559
Here we go.

1624
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,199
Eat it slow.

1625
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,319
You're never gonna have
your first beignet ever again.

1626
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,839
Pretty cool.

1627
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,519
- It's cool, right? You like it?
- Mm-hm.

1628
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,102
They don't taste like this
anywhere else in the world.

1629
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,039
- So, what else you gotta buy?
- Nothing.

1630
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,679
Not anything for work?

1631
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,359
Nope.

1632
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,319
- Really?
- Nah.

1633
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,279
Just wanted to get some
beignets with you.

1634
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,270
Cool.

1635
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,399
I like New Orleans.

1636
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,519
I like New Orleans too.

1637
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,999
- Somebody ate my body.
- I didn't brush my teeth.

1638
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,559
This is what happens to you when
you don't brush your teeth.

1639
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,119
- Dude, dude! Where were you, man?
- What? I went shopping.

1640
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,159
- You went shopping?
- I called you, man. I texted you.

1641
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,759
- We got beignets.
- Where the hell were you?

1642
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,359
- You got beignets? I've been calling.
- We got some beets for the truck.

1643
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,519
- Why didn't you answer your phone?
- My phone was on vibrate.

1644
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,679
- You put your phone on vibrate.
- Chill out. What's the big...

1645
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,439
- I'm sorry.
- Chill out? Just take a look.

1646
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,399
Take a look. Please take a look.

1647
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,159
- Is that for us?
- That's for us.

1648
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,999
- That whole line's for us?
- Can you believe that?

1649
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,479
Oh, my God!

1650
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,479
Alright, so, I guess we
gotta cook some food.

1651
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,719
- We gotta cook some food.
- Alright, so you good with prep?

1652
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,319
- Yes, sir.
- We're gonna get through this.

1653
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,759
- You ready?
- I'm ready, boss.

1654
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,199
- OK. Buy me five minutes.
- Yes, sir.

1655
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,199
Could you give us five minutes,
please? Five minutes.

1656
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,159
We'll be right there
in five more minutes.

1657
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,639
Got everything... Plancha's...
Everything's hot.

1658
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,359
- Oil's hot. You got everything ready.
- Yes, sir.

1659
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,839
You are a superstar!

1660
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,159
- You are a superstar.
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1661
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:21,359
Oh! And how'd you get that crowd?
You got a huge crowd outside.

1662
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,999
I didn't. I just came back from
shopping, there was this long line.

1663
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,359
- I thought it was a mistake.
- I tweeted it.

1664
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,589
- You what?
- What'd you do?

1665
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:32,759
I tweeted the picture on your account
and then geotagged it. Look.

1666
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,679
Wait, man, you did...
you did what? You geo...

1667
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,479
I tagged it so they can
mark us on their maps.

1668
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,599
Look at those pictures.

1669
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,079
How'd you... What'd you...

1670
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,559
- These pictures are from here.
- Mm-hm.

1671
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,999
How'd you get those
pictures from here?

1672
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,759
When I was going to Café Du Monde.

1673
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,679
- And you put it online?
- Mm-hm.

1674
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,559
You're a genius, kid.

1675
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,959
You're the reason everybody's
here. You know that?

1676
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,479
You're my new head of
marketing. Thank you.

1677
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,279
Alright, so, I'm gonna
hit the chalkboard.

1678
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,319
You walk him through the prep on the
po' boys and get the plancha going.

1679
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,399
Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef. Jefecito.

1680
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,599
You butter the
plancha, son, alright?

1681
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,199
I got this. Percy, look. Whoo!

1682
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,271
Yes, sir.

1683
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,439
Single file, y'all. Right here.

1684
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:17,319
0-8? There you go. Thank you
very much. Napkins are down there.

1685
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,519
- Another beignet coming up.
- Hang on a second.

1686
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,399
- Number seven.
- There you go, two more.

1687
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,879
Cubano coming up.

1688
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,119
Hang on, one second.
He's my kid. He's just learning.

1689
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,319
- Put you on the Twitter?
- Watch your back.

1690
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,719
That's my kid. He did all that.

1691
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,279
- More beignets.
- How's that po' boy coming?

1692
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,239
- It's coming up with shrimp.
- Alright.

1693
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:36,519
It's worth the wait, I promise.

1694
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,439
<i>Baby</i>

1695
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,079
<i>I'm hot just like an oven</i>

1696
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,719
<i>I need some lovin'</i>

1697
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,439
<i>And, baby</i>

1698
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,039
<i>I can't hold it much longer</i>

1699
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,999
<i>It's getting
stronger and stronger</i>

1700
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,319
<i>And when I get that feelin',
I want sexual healing</i>

1701
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:39,119
<i>Sexual healing is good for me</i>

1702
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,988
<i>Makes me feel so fine</i>

1703
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,679
<i>Helps to relieve my mind</i>

1704
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,839
<i>Yeah</i>

1705
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:52,199
<i>Sexual healing,
baby, is good for me</i>

1706
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,919
<i>Sexual healing is something
that's good for me</i>

1707
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:01,199
<i>Whenever blue
teardrops are falling</i>

1708
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:05,879
<i>And my emotional
stability is leaving me</i>

1709
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:09,119
<i>There is something I can do</i>

1710
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:14,159
<i>I can get on the telephone
and call you up, baby</i>

1711
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:19,119
<i>Honey, I know you'll
be there to relieve me</i>

1712
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,479
<i>The love you give to me will...</i>

1713
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,359
Jefe, jefe. It says
'sold out', man.

1714
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,340
We should be good. I think
they're holding for us.

1715
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,999
- Hey, Benji.
- Hey.

1716
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,399
- We got here as fast as we could.
- Hopefully we're still good.

1717
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,399
- You got anything for me?
- Gotta check with the man.

1718
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,879
- In the back.
- OK, thanks.

1719
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,870
What's up, killer?

1720
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,359
- Hey, Aaron.
- What's up, Carl?

1721
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,759
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

1722
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,239
Driving all night. Doing good.

1723
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,839
- You still got the stuff?
- Let's do it.

1724
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,439
Oh. He's got the stuff.

1725
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,039
- What is this place?
- This is Texas OG barbecue.

1726
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:56,862
These guys gotta stay up all night
and stoke those fires low and slow.

1727
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,464
Oh, man, that's gorgeous.

1728
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,559
- So how many can I get?
- I guess four.

1729
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,999
- I'll take it.
- Alright.

1730
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,025
Whoo!

1731
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,399
- Nice.
- Oh, yeah.

1732
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,187
Yeah. Oh, there we go.

1733
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,359
Oh, oh!

1734
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,519
- Oh, man.
- Mmm!

1735
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,879
Mmm. We should get some sliders.

1736
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,439
- Wow.
- We should do sliders, man.

1737
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,799
- Oh, my God.
- We get some King's Hawaiian bread.

1738
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,279
- Mm-hm.
- Pickle, barbecue sauce.

1739
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,919
What if we swapped this out for
the pork in the media noche?

1740
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,559
- What do you think about that?
- Swap this for the pork shoulder?

1741
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,159
- Make, like, an Austin Midnight.
- I like that.

1742
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,999
- That's hot. I like that.
- That is hot, baby.

1743
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,399
Let me get one more of these.
You should check this out.

1744
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,399
- Just let me cut right through.
- Mmm.

1745
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,239
- Save it, dog.
- I know. We're gonna save it.

1746
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,079
- Use it all up, man.
- I'll give you half.

1747
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:44,390
- Know you can't eat your own supply.
- Put it away after this.

1748
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,079
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1749
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:05,959
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1750
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:11,479
<i>Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1751
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,279
<i>Yeah</i>

1752
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:18,627
<i>Travis County took my picture
but, no, I didn't smile</i>

1753
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:24,639
<i>They told me I was gonna be
here for a pretty long while</i>

1754
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,119
<i>One day, I was
walking down the street</i>

1755
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,319
<i>When I should've been
walking down the hall...</i>

1756
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,919
- Six sliders all day.
- 69's coming up.

1757
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,946
Ah! One is coming up.

1758
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,919
Media noche, Texas.

1759
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,639
- Whoo!
- This is getting murdered.

1760
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,639
You got that three media
noches coming up?

1761
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:44,959
Alright.

1762
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,439
Order 65 and 66.

1763
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,959
- I got po' boy right here.
- One sec.

1764
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,439
- You got the transfer pan?
- Cubano.

1765
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,039
Thank you. Good. Hey, your
phone's ringing, Percy.

1766
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,304
Sorry.

1767
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,759
- Hey, Mom.
- Where are you?

1768
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,159
- I'm in Austin.
- Are you OK?

1769
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,999
- I'm great.
- How's your daddy?

1770
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,959
Here, talk to him.

1771
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,439
- Hi, Inez.
- Hi.

1772
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,119
- You want me to pick him up?
- No, you're a thousand miles away.

1773
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,759
It's OK. I can go get on
a plane and pick him up.

1774
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,599
- No, it's fine. He's doing great.
- "I miss him.

1775
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,719
"I want you to come home.
I love him."

1776
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,879
He's fine. He's got a couple of burns
and two stitches from a paring knife.

1777
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,919
Please, I'm serious.
Let me go and pick him up.

1778
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,719
You know your son's a cook now?

1779
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:26,919
- I'm a line cook.
- He's a line cook.

1780
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,399
Be careful!

1781
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,999
I'll have him home
in time for school.

1782
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,599
- And you? Are you OK?
- I'm amazing!

1783
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,559
"Oh, you're so sexy in that bandana.
I want your big platanos."

1784
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,119
Looks here like you guys
are having so much fun.

1785
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,919
Alright, give me one second. Did you
know your son could work a grill?

1786
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,399
- I had beer.
- What did he say?

1787
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,839
Stop. Stop, stop.
He says he misses you.

1788
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,679
Aww, tell him I love him.

1789
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,199
- Dad got me a knife.
- He says, "I love you."

1790
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,639
- What?
- "I love you!"

1791
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:54,869
I love you too!

1792
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,309
Tell... tell him,
"I love you too." OK?

1793
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,510
'Bye.

1794
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:08,159
Alright, 70!

1795
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:14,319
<i>Every day
and nothing seem to change</i>

1796
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:18,919
<i>Everywhere I go,
I keep seeing the same old thing</i>

1797
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,263
<i>And I</i>

1798
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,104
<i>I can't take it no more...</i>

1799
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,428
- Let's take a selfie.
- A selfie?

1800
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,708
Wait, let me do it with
the flash. Hold on.

1801
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,348
Oh, look at that.
Email that to me, alright?

1802
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,319
OK.

1803
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,839
Mind if I post this?

1804
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,959
- What is that, another Vine?
- No, it's 'One Second Every Day' video.

1805
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,439
Remember?

1806
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,639
- It's the trip all cut together?
- Oh, the little cuts of the thing?

1807
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,279
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, just email it to me.

1808
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,239
I'm sure it's fine.

1809
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:57,999
Listen, I, uh... I want to
talk to you about something.

1810
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,879
Yeah?

1811
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,479
I've had a really good time with
you these last couple of weeks.

1812
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,159
Me too.

1813
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,150
And...

1814
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:09,824
you've become a really good cook.

1815
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,799
- Thanks, Dad.
- Not just for a kid.

1816
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,959
I mean, you're really good.
You work really hard.

1817
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:15,879
It's a big deal.

1818
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:20,359
But we're gonna be home soon,
and we're gonna get back to our lives,

1819
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,199
and I'm gonna be really
busy with the truck

1820
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,319
and you're gonna be
really busy with school.

1821
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,239
But I can still work
on the truck, right?

1822
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,839
You said I was a good cook.

1823
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,519
I'm... I'm sorry, Percy.

1824
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,359
I... I just don't want
you to be disappointed

1825
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,359
when things go back to
the way that they were.

1826
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,783
I don't want it to go back to that.

1827
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,319
I could work after
school and on weekends.

1828
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,159
I just want to be
honest with you, OK?

1829
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,719
I feel like I've let you down so much,
and I didn't want to blindside you,

1830
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:47,799
but the summer's gonna end and we're
not gonna be doing this anymore.

1831
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,319
OK?

1832
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,629
OK.

1833
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,279
But we had a lot of fun, and
nobody could take away from us

1834
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,319
what we experienced
together, right?

1835
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,868
And I feel like I
really got to know you.

1836
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,466
Alright. Let's watch the music.

1837
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,747
<i>Well, if things don't
change around here</i>

1838
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:16,311
<i>There ain't no use
in me hanging right on</i>

1839
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,790
<i>Hang around</i>

1840
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:22,262
<i>But I'll be ready now</i>

1841
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:27,707
<i>I'll be ready when
my train pulls up</i>

1842
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,861
<i>Well, I'll be ready now
Yeah</i>

1843
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:37,989
<i>I'll be ready when
my train pulls in</i>

1844
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,559
<i>I know my time ain't
long around...</i>

1845
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,381
Alright, pal. Here we are.

1846
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,359
- Be nice to be home.
- Yep.

1847
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,639
See your turtle, see your
mommy, back to your room.

1848
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:03,108
I'm really gonna miss you.

1849
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,199
I'm gonna miss you too.

1850
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,039
OK, but you'll stay
with me in two weeks.

1851
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,319
- OK?
- Yeah.

1852
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,239
- Whole weekend.
- Did you post the video yet?

1853
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,639
- I didn't look at it yet. Sorry.
- Don't forget.

1854
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,119
- I won't.
- I'll resend it.

1855
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,110
OK.

1856
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,239
Come on. Mommy misses you.

1857
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,310
Go. Go to Mommy.

1858
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,870
Mwah!

1859
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,024
'Bye.

1860
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,039
Oh, shit.

1861
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,439
<i>- Wait a second.
- Gonna make...</i>

1862
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,359
- Right, Dad?
- See you next week.

1863
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,279
- Put that thing away.
- So I'm the nanny?

1864
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,942
Here we go.

1865
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,503
Hi.

1866
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,388
- Look out.
- Oh!

1867
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,719
- Empingao.
- Yeah!

1868
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,479
- Park over there.
- Miami!

1869
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,759
Come on, get in.

1870
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,079
Arroz con pollo.

1871
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:13,469
I think I missed the exit.

1872
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,383
Beignets.

1873
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,599
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

1874
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,719
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1875
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,639
What's up?

1876
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,839
Listen, I was... I was thinking,
about what we were talking about.

1877
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,319
Yeah?

1878
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,959
And it's gotta be OK with Mom.
Let me just say that first.

1879
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,985
What are you talking about?

1880
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,903
I could really use your
help on the truck.

1881
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,679
You there?

1882
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,159
Yeah.

1883
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,999
And it's only for the
weekends and after school

1884
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,479
after you're done
with your homework,

1885
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,079
and the money goes into
your college fund.

1886
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,599
OK. Does that sound good?

1887
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,559
That sounds pretty good.

1888
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,759
Mom! Dad wants me to
cook on his truck!

1889
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,839
No, really! He's on the phone.

1890
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:34,079
Mom wants to talk to you.
I think it's yes. Hang on.

1891
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,199
Order 16. 16.

1892
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,623
- 16. 16, here.
- Thank you.

1893
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,199
- 15.
- Order up. Order up. Next!

1894
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,439
Mole, two Cubanos,

1895
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:14,039
and order 21, slider.

1896
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,519
- Thank you.
- 21? Thank you.

1897
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,679
- There you go. I got yours coming.
- Perfect. 15.

1898
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,989
- Yes.
- OK. Thank you.

1899
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,239
There's no food for you here.

1900
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,479
Could I speak to the chef
for just a second, please?

1901
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,470
The hell you will.

1902
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,679
Can I talk to you?

1903
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:36,542
Next! Next!

1904
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,439
What exactly are you doing here?

1905
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,439
I'm, uh... eating the food.
I'm eating your food.

1906
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,439
I thought my food was
needy and cloying.

1907
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,719
Well, I didn't think
you'd want to serve me,

1908
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:52,119
so I sent somebody
else to pick it up.

1909
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:55,759
What happened between us,
that really knocked me for a loop.

1910
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,879
I mean, you robbed me of my pride
and my career and my dignity.

1911
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,839
And I know people like you don't
usually care about that kind of thing.

1912
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,319
That's not necessarily true.

1913
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,719
But you should know,
it hurts people like me.

1914
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:10,239
- 'Cause we're really trying.
- You started a flame war with me.

1915
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,479
Are you kidding me? I buy
ink by the barrel, buddy.

1916
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,359
What are you doing
picking a fight with me?

1917
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,039
I wouldn't challenge
you to a cook-off.

1918
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,879
I thought I was sending
you a private message.

1919
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,479
I didn't know that.
I thought we were having fun.

1920
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,799
It was theatre. By the way,
what the fuck were you cooking?

1921
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,599
You totally shat the bed, buddy.
How could I back that?

1922
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,239
You were one of my early boys.

1923
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:30,999
I had no control over the menu.

1924
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,479
Whatever the case, OK? You seem
to be cooking for yourself again.

1925
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,839
Because this shit is sensational.

1926
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,759
I mean, really, really good.

1927
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,239
Thank you.

1928
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,919
I'm not gonna write about it.

1929
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,919
Yeah. I understand.

1930
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,263
Because I'd like to back you.

1931
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,319
Excuse me?

1932
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,799
I wanna bankroll you,

1933
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,239
and I can't write about anything
I have a vested interest in.

1934
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,079
I'm not sure I get
what's going on here.

1935
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,119
I sold my website for
a whole lot of money

1936
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,559
and I've just put in a
bid on a place on Rose.

1937
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:02,839
It's zoned, it's permitted. You could
build it out however you like.

1938
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,439
And you can cook whatever you like.

1939
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,119
Take your time, think about it.

1940
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,119
I wouldn't blame you for
having a few trust issues,

1941
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,599
but I just thought that, you know,

1942
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,839
you and me burying the hatchet
might be a good story.

1943
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,599
Reservations out the door.

1944
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,879
More importantly, you know, you
just cook your ass off in there.

1945
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,599
In the meantime, you just
tweet me wherever you are

1946
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,079
and I'll come running.

1947
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,582
'Cause this shit's good. Alright?

1948
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:26,319
Delicious!

1949
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,310
Delicioso.

1950
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,799
Mucho goodo.

1951
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,239
- Hey, jefe.
- Yeah?

1952
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,439
That was a lot of talking
and you not punching him.

1953
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,430
So, what'd that asshole say, huh?

1954
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,399
I think that asshole might
be our new partner.

1955
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,150
Go, go, go, go

1956
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:34,959
Thank you!

1957
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:37,039
A mark. B mark.

1958
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,039
Looks good. It looks good already.

1959
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,907
The heat is right on.

1960
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,399
- That's olive oil?
- Yeah.

1961
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,119
What are you grabbing over there?

1962
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:48,110
You're grabbing all your cheese.

1963
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,919
Yeah.

1964
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,599
What are you doing there?
Spreading it around or finding...

1965
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,519
- Spreading it around.
- What are you looking for there?

1966
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,319
Heat. Heat.

1967
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:59,119
So it doesn't burn?

1968
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:02,399
- Where's the hottest spot?
- Right here is the hot spot.

1969
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:07,439
So you're controlling it all the time.
You're always controlling.

1970
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,159
And you're looking, you're looking.

1971
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:13,319
As soon as you get your good colour...
This is now where you start it.

1972
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:17,142
You start to really build
the sandwich itself.

1973
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:19,904
A light scrape.

1974
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:24,799
So you can see, the whole
sandwich starts to evolve.

1975
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,879
And, see, the cheese is
starting to evolve too.

1976
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,519
Yes, you can do it. There you go.

1977
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,510
Getting in there.

1978
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,199
You're almost...

1979
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,799
Even now, as you get further, Jon,

1980
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,599
you're getting in,
like, assertive now.

1981
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,239
You're changing...
Even your grip's here.

1982
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,039
- Mm-hm.
- Changing your positions.

1983
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:43,839
You're moving around.

1984
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,679
But you're not too
busy with it. You're...

1985
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:49,399
You're precise, but then
sometimes you step back.

1986
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,719
- Nothing else exists except this.
- Right.

1987
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:55,399
This is the only thing that
exists in this world right now.

1988
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:57,639
And if you fuck this up,
everything sucks in the world.
