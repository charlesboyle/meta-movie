00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,529
<i>[Ethan] So we met at</i> a <i>party,
and it was magic.</i>

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,565
<i>Within a half hour,</i>

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,246
<i>we were driving up into
this really nice neighborhood,</i>

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,201
<i>and we were
running down the stairs</i>

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,328
<i>of some stranger's backyard,</i>

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,363
<i>and then we were swimming
and we were in Jove.</i>

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,720
<i>What we didn't count on</i>

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,245
<i>was that even though
the lights were off,</i>

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,971
<i>the owner of the home
was there,</i>

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,122
<i>and he came out
screaming at us,</i>

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,282
<i>and it was the greatest
night of my life.</i>

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,600
[Whispers] Ready?

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,165
So my idea was, you know,

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,370
let's try
and re-create that moment.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,731
[whispers] Oh, it's freezing!

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,889
It's a little colder
than I remember it.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,360
[heavy breathing]

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,811
Do you think
he's coming out?

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,645
I'm sure. I'm sure he
heard us, right?

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,122
Hello? This is fun.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,321
Yeah.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,601
Where is he?

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,725
[whispers] Maybe he's not home.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,203
Happy anniversary anyway.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,884
Happy anniversary.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,727
<i>[Sophie] When we were in the
water and we were waiting</i>

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,531
<i>and no one came out,
no one was home,</i>

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,331
<i>and we were
just floating there,</i>

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,687
<i>I felt sad,</i>

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,249
and I felt like our happiness
used to be so easy

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,527
and there used to be
so much of it,

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,241
and now I feel like
happiness is something

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,448
that we have to re-create.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,281
Ah.

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,970
I'm sorry. I tried to make
a romantic moment.

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,644
I'll never take you
to a fucking pool again.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,808
Oh, come on.
Don't do that.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,401
Okay.

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,681
This could be fun.

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,491
We're going to do a
compatibility exercise.

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,531
I want you both to play a note
at the same time, okay?

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,761
Just any note?

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,842
Yep. Knock yourself out.

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,728
[chuckles]

45
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,451
Wow! You guys are not in sync,
are you?

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,721
We used to be great.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,165
We used to be
really irreverent and...

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,287
Yeah. There was teasing.

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,480
- Yeah.
- And stuff. Like I...

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,726
I mean no offense...

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,290
But I would call you
a bitch and it was funny.

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,447
Yeah, it was hilarious.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,600
I used to call you a bitch.

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,404
- You thought it was really funny.
- Yeah.

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,528
I just don't know how
we're going to move forward

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,728
if we keep having
this circular conversation

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,690
about me doing what I did

58
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,603
which I have
apologized for already,

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,331
and we are here because
we are trying to move on.

60
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,647
I don't see why we have to
keep revisiting that

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,927
because it's the same conversation
over and over again.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,446
Because you don't get
to decide that, Ethan.

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,722
You don't get to decide
when we move on, I do.

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,047
30, You guys having sex?

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,289
Now if you'd played
this one, Sophie...

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,044
[piano note]

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,645
...or that one...
...that's pretty, right?

68
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,724
But this...
...not so much.

69
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,405
Anyway, it's just an exercise.

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,284
I want to trust you again.

71
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,521
I want to forgive you.

72
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,761
I want
all of those things.

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,730
I want us
and I want us to work.

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,564
I don't know why you feel
like I don't want that.

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,211
Because we don't agree on
how we're going to get there.

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,291
Where are you?

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,887
Okay.

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,689
I have an idea.

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,966
This is a great place.

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,122
I think it will be
very helpful.

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,966
It's absolutely beautiful.

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,610
<i>It's about an hour and a half
north from here.</i>

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,365
<i>It's like a...
like a perfect retreat,</i>

84
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,851
<i>just the two of you.</i>

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,402
<i>Give you a chance
to reset the reset button.</i>

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,811
<i>I've sent
a lot of couples there,</i>

87
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,962
and they've all come back

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,280
renewed.

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,611
- What do you think?
- I mean, I'll try anything.

90
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,801
Sophie?

91
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,810
[keypad beeps]

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,361
Wow!

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,081
Hello?

94
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,930
And then when you
pour the wine, you do this.

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,360
This is what they do in
the restaurants. Watch this. Whoop.

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,005
So it doesn't drip.
Even though I kind of...

97
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,923
- It kind of dripped.
- I don't think you did it right.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,047
Cheers!

99
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,531
To me and my cooking.

100
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,080
There's a guest house
on the property

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,167
which is pretty cool.

102
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,241
- Really?
- Yeah.

103
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,850
I don't even know
if we're supposed to use it

104
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,524
or if someone else
is renting it.

105
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,443
Oh, God.
What's happening?

106
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,090
Come here.
Come here.

What's happening?

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,721
Whoa!

109
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,645
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,767
You've got to hold it.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,321
Hold it in, hold it in.

112
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,126
There you go.

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,931
- Geez.
- Wow, still got it.

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,371
Get the light going.

115
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,767
- Sweetie.
- Sorry, sorry.

116
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,365
Give me kiss.

Aw! You're so cute
without your glasses.

118
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,644
You shouldn't wear these.
I like you without them.

Do you like me
without the glasses?

You found me.

I found you.

Hey.

Hey there.

Hey, you know,
you were right.

- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

Do tell.

130
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,124
We need to try
more new things,

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,086
like weekends away
in places like this.

132
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,329
- You think so?
- Mmm-hmm.

133
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,687
It makes me excited
about us again.

134
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,841
Do you feel it?

135
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,041
- [whispers] I do.
- Yeah.

- Aw.
- Oh!

- Close!
- The bounce. It's okay.

Oh, you got it.
Oh, my God!

Do you want to
sleep here tonight?

Can we?

Sure. We can do
whatever we want.

Okay. Yep.

Let me just get some clothes.

161
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,606
I don't want to sleep
in my jeans.

- Okay.
- You want anything?

I'm good.

Very funny.

How did you get up here
so fast?

Did you find
a secret passageway?

Yeah, secret underground passage.

00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,491
[groans]

183
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,007
No, seriously.
How did you get here so fast?

184
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,286
You beat me.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,525
What?

186
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,729
How did you get here from
the guest house before me?

187
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,043
You mean, before dinner?

188
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,248
I was just walking outside
and I just walked over.

189
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,687
No, not before dinner,
just now.

190
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,765
Why are you so sweaty?

191
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
Did you go for a run
or something?

192
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,571
Oh, yeah.

193
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,286
Because... Is that the joke
that's happening now?

194
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,207
What?

195
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,123
The joke that you're
not going to remember

196
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,885
that we just had sex,
because that's really funny.

197
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,405
Wait!

198
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,245
We just had sex?

199
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,446
[exhales deeply]
Okay. That's not funny.

200
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,561
I'm not trying to be funny.

201
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,085
I thought you were
making a joke.

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,406
Why are you doing
this right now?

203
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,481
I'm not doing anything.

204
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,800
I've...

205
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,881
Huh?

206
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,727
You know what, Ethan?

207
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,847
You just had
a really nice night

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,286
and I don't know
why you would ruin it.

209
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,441
I'm not trying
to ruin our night.

210
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,567
I want to have a nice night.

211
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,721
Fine, we had sex.
It was great.

212
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,370
You were amazing.

213
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,566
You're an asshole.

214
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,680
Good night.

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,441
[groans]

216
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,121
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,045
[whispers] I love you.

218
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,645
I love you.

219
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,451
[clattering]

220
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,881
Hey.

221
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,250
Good morning, handsome.

222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,002
Oh! I'm hungover.

223
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,605
[giggles]

224
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,371
Well, it sounds like
you need some breakfast.

225
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,403
Not that we need to
get back into it. Um...

226
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,406
But that was a little
bit of a weird fight last night.

227
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,927
I know.

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,002
I don't really understand
what happened,

229
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,081
but I feel like

230
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
maybe we just chalk it up
to like some bad pot...

231
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,165
Alcohol combo,
put it behind us

232
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,526
and not let it
ruin the trip.

233
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,931
Agreed, totally.

234
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,241
Cool.

235
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,727
That being said,

236
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,047
it was one of the weirder
fights we've had. Like...

237
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,360
Oh my God, I know.

238
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,607
Crazy, right?

239
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,523
I mean, I still don't
fully understand

240
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,371
whether you were
so drunk and stoned

241
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,646
that you thought
we had sex

242
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,366
or were you just were making
a joke and it backfired.

243
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,240
Honestly, I think it was just
one of those things, you know?

244
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,688
One of those things...
No, I'm asking you

245
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,127
was it that you were
drunk and stoned

246
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,326
or was it playing a joke...

247
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,805
Because I'm still confused
what happened.

248
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,486
I think the important thing
is that, you know,

249
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,085
we fought,
we made up,

250
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,010
we had a nice cuddle,
beautiful day.

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,320
Sophie, what are you
talking about?

252
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,727
We had a fight
and you stormed out.

253
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,921
We didn't make up.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,365
Are you okay?

255
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,486
I'm fine, are you okay? I'm...

256
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,006
Okay, Mr. Hangover.

257
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,525
I think it's time
for some food. Huh?

258
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,648
Let's get something
in your stomach.

259
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,802
You're kind of freaking me out
a little bit, Sophie.

260
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,009
I've got to say...
Is that bacon?

261
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,521
Yeah.

262
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,687
You hate it
when I eat bacon.

263
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,010
[water running]

264
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
What?

265
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,325
What's going on?

266
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,408
That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

267
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,722
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

268
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,241
No.

269
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,731
No, no, no, no.

270
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,001
No what?

271
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,411
This was...
There were plates... Hello?

272
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,606
What are you
talking about plates?

273
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,841
Hello, hello?
What are you... Ethan?

274
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,450
- Where'd you go?
- Where'd who go?

275
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,046
Ethan?

276
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,641
Hello?

277
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,051
Ethan?

278
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,645
There was bacon right there
on those plates...

279
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,728
What are you talking about?
Ethan, answer me.

280
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,001
You can't...
The smell of bacon...

281
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,003
You can't get the smell of bacon
out in five minutes.

282
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,411
- There was bacon...
- What about bacon?

283
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,811
Right here.
There was bacon here.

284
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,491
Why are you acting like this?

285
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,489
Shit. Sophie, Sophie.

286
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,641
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

287
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,206
Sophie, Sophie...

288
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,407
- What?
- I'm sorry.

289
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,686
- What?
- I'm sorry, just wait.

290
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,250
I'm spazzing out
in there, I know,

291
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,004
but something
fucking weird

292
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,242
like Twilight Zone shit
is going on here,

293
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,522
and I'm trying to get
a handle on it, okay?

294
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,525
Last night
we had a nice dinner.

295
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,886
We had a blast together, right?

296
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,087
- Yes.
- Okay.

297
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,605
Then, we smoked some pot.

298
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,325
I fell asleep on the couch.

299
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,444
Next thing I know,
you woke me up

300
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,483
claiming that we had
just had sex together.

301
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,011
Because we did!

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,001
Okay. I came here.

303
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,121
Nobody was here.

304
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,361
I fell asleep on this couch

305
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,488
and I woke up
to you snuggling me.

306
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,880
What? What are you
talking about?

307
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,126
No, I didn't.

308
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,884
That's crazy to me
that you would deny that, okay?

309
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,564
- I didn't.
- Exactly.

310
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,529
Crazy just like me denying
that I had slept with you.

311
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,125
You know what I'm saying?

312
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,167
We had two completely separate
experiences with each other

313
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,130
that neither of us remembers, and...

314
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,768
Hang on a second. I'm going to
go in there by myself, okay?

315
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,927
Why?

316
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,331
You just stay here for like
30 seconds.

317
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,561
- Don't move.
- Ethan!

318
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,761
[water running]

319
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,926
Hello?

320
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,921
Hey, Babe.

321
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,769
Can you hand me a towel?

322
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,081
You're in that shower.

323
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,650
I just handed you a towel.

324
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,320
Okay, you know what,
I'm not even mad any more.

325
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,765
Now you're just scaring me,

326
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
and I don't understand
why you're doing this.

327
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,689
Go, go see for yourself, Sophie.

328
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,280
Be careful.

329
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,805
[groans]

330
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,564
Hey, where you been all morning?

331
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,211
Hello, Sophie.

332
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,290
I was just walking.

333
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,401
Oh, yeah.

334
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,209
It's really nice out, huh?

335
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,611
It's actually
a little bright in here.

336
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,444
Do you mind
if I close these?

337
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,521
Mmm-mmm.

338
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,809
The morning sun here
is insane.

339
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,604
Give me a hug.

340
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,165
Sorry. I'm a little sweaty.

341
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,771
That's okay.

342
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,360
Come on.

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,521
Sophie.

344
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,246
Soph?

345
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,926
Fuck this.

346
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,080
You're kidding me!

347
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,921
What the fuck?

348
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,161
Sophie?

349
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,529
Oh my God!
Hey, are you okay?

350
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,565
You're in there.
It's you.

351
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,571
You're exercising.

352
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,485
What is happening?

353
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,005
I don't know.

354
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,246
This is so crazy.

355
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,410
Did that really happen?

356
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,891
I mean, did that, was that...

357
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,650
I just don't...
I don't understand.

358
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,565
Is it another dimension,

359
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,290
like when you go
through the door,

360
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,046
is it another plane
of existence or...

361
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,326
I don't know.

362
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,481
I've no clue.

363
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,164
I think we need to just say

364
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,369
some weird shit happened.

365
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,720
We compartmentalize it.

366
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,286
There was a cosmic
aberration of some sort...

367
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,806
- Yeah, yeah. Move on.
- And we go home.

368
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
We don't talk
about this again,

369
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,406
and we just stop
thinking about it.

370
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,646
Okay.

371
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,447
- Yeah. We could move on.
- Done.

372
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,201
Oh my God, I can't
stop thinking about it.

373
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,366
Can you?

374
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
We're just going to
have to just...

375
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,764
I guess time, you know...

376
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,446
I'm not going to be able to
stop thinking about this, Ethan.

377
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,891
Well, what else can we do?

378
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,080
I mean what are we, what are
we going to do, you know?

379
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,481
Well, I mean, there's the...

380
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,643
There's the crazy thing
to do which is...

381
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,007
What?

382
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,291
Which is to, you know,
explore it further.

383
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,526
Explore it further?

384
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,125
I know you only had
a little bit of it...

385
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,800
Yeah. I was there for
like three seconds.

386
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,884
I know. And I,
but I had a whole evening...

387
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,526
In that house,
and I have to say,

388
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,008
I know I sound like
a crazy person right now,

389
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,964
but I have to say
it was kind of magical.

390
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,566
- Well...
- It was...

391
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,291
But don't go overboard
with the whole magic

392
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,601
of what happened there

393
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,125
because I know what you
did in there, okay?

394
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,725
All right. That's not
what I'm talking about.

395
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,211
I'm not talking about
that kind of magic.

396
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,731
There was a rush.

397
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,646
It was exciting.
I felt happy.

398
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,007
And it wasn't just that.

399
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,531
It wasn't just the time
in the guest house.

400
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,331
We had a great time
in the main house.

401
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,124
Yes, we did.
We had a good time.

402
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,571
It wasn't just the weed.

403
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,682
I mean we were connecting,
we were talking,

404
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,524
we were happy,
we were... Happy.

405
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,681
Yes.

406
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,287
We also had a fantastic time
when we did ecstasy at Lalapalooza,

407
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,124
but we're not going to do that
every day of our lives

408
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,247
because you die...

409
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,401
- Right.
- Okay?

410
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,891
There's a question
of our safety here.

411
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,486
Yeah. But I didn't feel
like it was dangerous.

412
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,967
I didn't feel...
I felt safe.

413
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,171
I didn't feel dangerous, either.

414
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,486
I felt like I was with you.

415
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,211
This is something that we've
been talking about in therapy...

416
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,649
Exploring new options,
creating a new relationship...

417
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,768
Not going back to the past

418
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,122
and re-creating
old things that happened

419
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,969
but starting
with new things.

420
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,491
Yeah. Point taken.

421
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,561
I know that this is...

422
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,045
I didn't imagine
this sort of...

423
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,246
...extreme.
- ...new thing.

424
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,321
Absolutely, but...

425
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,488
I imagined like
horseback riding

426
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,251
with a little satchel of wine,
you know?

427
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,044
Not exploring other dimensions

428
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,925
<i>in some weird version oi
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>

429
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,321
What if this is something
that I want to do?

430
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,330
You want to go back?

431
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,721
I want to help
our relationship.

432
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,602
So... A little weird
to say this,

433
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,485
but I'm struggling
a little bit with the fact

434
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,406
that you slept with
the other me last night.

435
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,485
Yeah, but I thought
it was you.

436
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,170
I know. I'm not mad
or blaming you.

437
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,449
I just like...
I'd be lying if I, you know,

438
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,523
didn't say I was a little jealous,
I guess.

439
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,210
All right.
I understand,

440
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,722
but obviously I would never
knowingly cheat on you.

441
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,605
So it seems like it only works
if we go in one at a time.

442
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,767
Correct.

443
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,525
So I guess we'll just figure out
who wants to go in there first.

444
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,608
[Sophie] I'll be out in a minute,
sweetheart.

445
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,446
Okay, I'm here.

446
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,201
That's good.

447
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,685
Hey, is that bacon okay?

448
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,564
It's been sitting out
for awhile.

449
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,161
It's good.

450
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,806
Good.

451
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,929
Where have you been
all morning?

452
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,041
Hanging out, you know.

453
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,286
Cool.

454
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,481
I missed you.

455
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,084
You missed me?

456
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,321
Of course.

457
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,966
Come sit with me.

458
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,850
Okay.

459
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,246
So...

460
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,446
So...

461
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,201
Isn't it crazy to think
that we're actually married?

462
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,009
[giggles]

463
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,206
I guess so.

464
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,440
We are husband and wife.

465
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,966
- I know.
- Yeah.

466
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,320
I love it.

467
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,002
How long have you been
here, by the way?

468
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,328
Since we came yesterday, silly.

469
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,484
No, I mean,
in the guest house.

470
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,409
Since we slept here
last night.

471
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Uh-oh. Someone's in detective mode.

472
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,646
Sorry. I didn't mean to be.

473
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,563
That's okay.
I don't mind.

474
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,083
Have you explored
the grounds very much?

475
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,403
I think I have
a pretty good sense of it.

476
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,804
It's so pretty here,
isn't it?

477
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,326
It is. Would you like to go on
a walk with me?

478
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,401
Not really right now,

479
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,329
but you're welcome
to go on a walk.

480
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,970
It's your vacation, too.

481
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,841
Okay.

482
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,169
I'll see you
in a little bit, Sophie.

483
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,362
Okay, Ethan.

484
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,441
Whoa!

485
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,846
- Fascinating.
- Tell me.

486
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,323
Okay. That being in there is
100% convinced that she is you.

487
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,447
- She is?
- Yeah.

488
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,050
I threw out
some soft challenges.

489
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,690
She is unflappable.

490
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,761
I think when
you go in there...

491
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,841
God, it's crazy.

492
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,691
Yeah, you throw out some
like very specific examples

493
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,444
from our past
and see how he reacts.

494
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,521
Oh, no, no, sweetie.

495
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,250
I don't think we're
supposed to challenge them.

496
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,164
What if they disappear
or something, you know?

497
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,169
What if they freak out?
I'm just saying what's the harm

498
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,931
in letting them think
that they're us?

499
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,128
Yeah, I mean, I...
All right.

500
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,931
There's no harm in it.

501
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,809
I just thought
part of the fun of this

502
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,042
was like the investigation
and trying to...

503
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,400
I know. Of course
you thought

504
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,010
the fun was in
the investigation.

505
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,246
Wait, hold on.

506
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,566
It's like at
the magic show in Vegas

507
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,006
when you told me
how the magician

508
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,406
did every single trick

509
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,528
and you ruined the entire show
for me and everyone around us.

510
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,649
Okay. You remember we talked
about the magic show

511
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,643
was three years ago
and we're moving past that?

512
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,245
- Okay.
- Yeah.

513
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,685
Let's go inside.

514
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,290
We'll make up
some ground rules together.

515
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,850
That way neither of us
feels like, you know,

516
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,081
there's any kind of...

517
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,201
Confusion.

518
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,851
- Or just being on the same page.
- Okay.

519
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,565
While we are
in the guest house

520
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,088
with the weird people,
no intimacy, no sex.

521
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,810
Yes. Absolutely agreed.

522
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,126
- No sex.
- Good.

523
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,241
What else?

524
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,084
Well, I would say that
would lead me to,

525
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,241
you know, no spying

526
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,050
and there has to be
trust involved,

527
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,003
and we'll be honest with each
other about what happens

528
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,326
in the guest house and...

529
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,601
Right. It's like a...

530
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,165
It's like a therapy exercise
in trust almost.

531
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,520
- It's a trust exercise.
- Okay, great.

532
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,761
- That's why we're here.
- Good.

533
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,841
Um...

534
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,085
Let's see.

535
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,447
I guess if there's
anything else...

536
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,489
Actually this is kind of
really important

537
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,891
now that I think about it.

538
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,651
We can have fun with this,
but if at any point either of us

539
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,848
becomes uncomfortable and
wants to stop,

540
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,367
we just cut it off,
pack our bags...

541
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,487
Absolutely.

542
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,846
Absolutely. Agreed.

543
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,410
That's a good one,
that's a really good one.

544
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,561
Yeah.

545
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,761
Anything else?

546
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,681
I think thats it.

547
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,125
Then we are done.
Those are good.

548
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,931
So since we're just kind of
like dipping our toes in here,

549
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,968
I think maybe we shouldn't
spend too much time in there

550
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,041
the first go-around.

551
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,168
Okay. How does
15 minutes sound?

552
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,484
Yeah, I think that's good.

553
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,730
Okay, but don't, you know,
stand outside waiting for me.

554
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,450
Wait, what?

555
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,329
Well, you know, I think
it's going to make me nervous

556
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,323
if I think you're waiting
right outside the door.

557
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,565
Yeah, okay.
That's fair.

558
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,085
Oh, you mean,
like right now?

559
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,049
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Yes, sorry.

560
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,571
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Okay.

561
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,640
Enjoy yourself,
but be safe.

562
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,961
Hey.

563
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,326
It's nice.

564
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,887
You could be honest.

565
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,325
I handle the criticism.

566
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,004
No, it's...

567
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,640
Okay.

568
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,522
I think I look
a little severe.

569
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,525
Is that how you see me?

570
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,567
No.

571
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,842
[both laughing]

572
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,002
I'm just not
a very good painter.

573
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,127
No.

574
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,687
I was trying to emulate Degas

575
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,966
who lights up his portrait faces
with all these wonderful colors.

576
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,121
Degas?

577
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,124
Unfortunately, it looks like
your face was lit on fire...

578
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
[giggles]

579
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,001
Which was not my intention.
I apologize.

580
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,082
But it yielded
a wonderful title, though.

581
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,650
- Uh-huh.
- I'm thinking of calling it

582
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,281
"Sophie My Love,
the Burn Victim."

583
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,160
Or the ultimate tittle
"Sophie My Love, the Full-On Bitch"

584
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,890
because l look
awfully bitchy.

585
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,166
- Well...
- Sorry.

586
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,607
Well, in all fairness,
sometimes you're a bitch.

587
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,366
Excuse me?

588
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,601
Yeah, but it's cool

589
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,603
because I'm an asshole
sometimes, you know?

590
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,801
Right.

591
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,530
We can say that, right?

592
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,329
No, I think it's good.

593
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,886
- Scoot over.
- Thanks.

594
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,804
[groans] Okay.

595
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,241
Cheers.

596
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,445
- Cheers.
- To a perfect weekend together.

597
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,641
Hmm.

598
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,845
That's very nice.

599
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,045
Where you going?

600
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,566
Nowhere but here.

601
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,490
Why are you nervous?

602
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,965
I'm not nervous.

603
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,765
[giggles]
Why do you think I'm nervous?

604
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,609
Give me your hand.

605
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,801
Hmm?

606
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,210
What? Don't you trust me?

607
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,281
What the fuck?

608
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,485
You were spying on me.

609
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,722
Well, yeah. You were
like over 20 minutes in there.

610
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,764
Over 20... We didn't agree it
would be exactly 15 minutes,

611
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,808
- five minutes over?
- Yeah, but you know,

612
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,167
we didn't agree on like
intimate massages either.

613
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,924
Wait, wait. Intimate,
intimate massages?

614
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,082
- Are you serious?
- You were into it.

615
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,486
I was not into...

616
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,606
I was rocking your body
in there.

617
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,045
All right. All right.

618
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,050
I'm sorry. I can see how that
might have made you uncomfortable,

619
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,764
and I apologize.

620
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,286
- It's a little confusing, Sorry.
- All right. It won't happen again.

621
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,361
- Okay.
- Understood.

622
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,091
- How was it in general though?
- Oh my God, it's so weird.

623
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,208
- It's so strange.
- It's really odd.

624
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,567
I mean, you were just...
You were wonderful.

625
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,051
You were funny and charming,

626
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,327
and you just kept telling me
all these great things

627
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,488
we should do
on the property and...

628
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,644
Does he feel like me to you?

629
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,843
He is you...
He's just a little...

630
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,724
A little what?

631
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,201
[sighs]

632
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,411
It's... How to describe it...
You know,

633
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,371
it's like you're funny,
you know.

634
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,165
You have a great sense of humor
and everyone likes you and...

635
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,241
Thanks.

636
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,004
And that's who you are...
In there,

637
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,083
but it's like a memory of it.

638
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,680
It's like I'm being
reminded of it or something,

639
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,121
but it's happening
right in front of me.

640
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,362
- Hmm.
- Does that make any sense?

641
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,328
You're not saying
that like it's like...

642
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,169
The better version
when you're in there, right?

643
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,924
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You're just...

644
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,360
Not at all.
That's the crazy thing.

645
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,607
It is you in there, you know?

646
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,806
What about the physicality...
Do you notice any differences?

647
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,806
No. No, not really.

648
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,041
Yeah.

649
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,250
You know what, the hair.

650
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,564
There's something
about the hair.

651
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,081
The hair?

652
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,400
Mmm-hmm. It's a little different.

653
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,769
It's like it's a little messier,
it's kind of beachy.

654
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,284
- Did you say beachy?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

655
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,680
Come here. Let me see.

656
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,531
It's like, like kind of... No.

657
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,523
Well, well, it's like really...

658
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,046
I don't know. I'm not doing it right
or something.

659
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,881
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

660
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,041
Don't worry about it.

661
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,525
Cool.

662
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,331
Oh, and you know what,
you don't wear glasses.

663
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,410
You don't wear glasses in there
and you seem totally fine with it.

664
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,606
Well.

665
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,681
[giggles]

666
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,441
In the guest house,
I'm a surfer with perfect vision.

667
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,681
We'll work on this.

668
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,889
It's not quite...
No, it's good.

669
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,371
We're getting there.

670
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,766
[giggles]

671
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,762
You've tried contacts, right?

672
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,920
Hey, Soph?

673
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,845
Hmm?

674
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,003
I'd like to take my session
at the guest house now if that's cool.

675
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,485
What time is it?

676
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,562
It's late,
but I just can't sleep.

677
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,084
Oh, okay, sweetie.

678
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,207
Okay. I love you.

679
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,766
I love you.

680
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,368
What are you talking about? There are
like six versions of the same doll.

681
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,083
They're completely
unique in every way.

682
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,043
There are six
different ladies here.

683
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,403
- I don't see it.
- Okay.

684
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,369
This one is the beautiful model
who is always talking about

685
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,727
how she was such a nerd
in high school,

686
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,728
and then oh, this one...
It definitely has two

687
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,451
tramp stamps underneath
that dress, for sure.

688
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,564
And then you've got...

689
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,530
This one is the coolest girl
in the world,

690
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,328
and she'd make
the most wonderful wife,

691
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,609
but no one's going to be able
to look past her chubby thighs.

692
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,486
Which one of these is your favorite?
Which one do you like the most?

693
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,601
Okay.

694
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,530
Ready for this?

695
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,005
Ooh, I dropped it.

696
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,203
How is that not the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

697
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,282
- It really is cute.
- It's so tiny.

698
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,725
It's adorable.

699
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,521
[Sophie] Hey.

700
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,006
Hi.

701
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,841
What you doing?

702
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,406
Nothing. What are you doing?

703
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,646
Nothing.

704
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,281
Have you...

705
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,326
Have I what?

706
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,721
Nothing.

707
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,200
Never mind.

708
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,088
So, what's on
the agenda for today?

709
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,761
I was going to maybe
go explore some more

710
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,727
and you know, just...
If that's okay.

711
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,569
- Of course.
- What about you?

712
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,889
I don't know. I thought I'd maybe
just hang out here, read.

713
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,042
Sounds nice.
Maybe I'll come by in a little bit

714
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,451
and we can spend some time.

715
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,846
Whatever you want.

716
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,126
Great.

717
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,445
Oh, I found your phone.

718
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,846
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

719
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,007
[static buzzing]

720
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,405
Come on.

721
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,006
Hello.

722
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,004
[Ethan] I'm up here.

723
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,685
Watch your head, okay?

724
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,291
Very cute up here.

725
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,800
It's a little small.

726
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,160
[giggles]

727
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,571
What are you doing up here?

728
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,686
I'm feeling very big.

729
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,204
I feel enormous.

730
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,281
[giggling]

731
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,010
Um, I'm glad you're here

732
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,401
because there is something
I want to talk to you about.

733
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,285
And it's a bit of
an elephant in the room,

734
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,882
and I think it's time
we discuss it.

735
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,764
- All right.
- Okay.

736
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,601
[giggles]

737
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,570
- This...
- Oh, that.

738
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,641
...is happening.

739
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,762
- Oh, Well.
- Ladies first.

740
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,121
In that case.

741
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,649
- Who the fuck starts with O?
- I know.

742
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,722
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- It's crazy.

743
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,041
Goddamn anarchist.

744
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,840
All right.
I'll just do an X in the middle.

745
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,211
That's a great move.

746
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,323
I think I see
where this is headed.

747
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,283
I'm not quite sure yet.

748
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,890
Yeah, I'm going to
block you there.

749
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,962
- Where do you think I should go?
- How's it going to end?

750
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,280
What do you think I
should do?

751
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,926
- Who's going to win?
- Oh, the suspense!

752
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,088
Oh, yes, and there it is.

753
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,247
What's your next game?

754
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,210
My next game is something
that is appropriate

755
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,810
for people
over the age of six.

756
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,967
I think that's a thing.

757
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,083
Why don't you kiss me any more?

758
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,327
Um, I've enjoyed
just hanging out

759
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,568
and reconnecting and...

760
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,880
I have, too.

761
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,602
I know, but I love kissing you
and I miss it.

762
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,926
Is there something I'm doing
that's bothering you or...

763
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,929
Oh my God, no, not at all.

764
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,760
Because I feel like
we're having a good time?

765
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,681
- We're having a great time.
- Yeah.

766
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,771
- Give me this.
- You're taking my chalk.

767
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,444
That's my...
That's my chalk.

768
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,124
I know it's your chalk.

769
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,126
Hey.

770
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,691
All right.
This is weird,

771
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,121
but I think
some of my shirts are missing.

772
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,170
- Really?
- Yeah.

773
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,203
Are you sure they're not
just hanging in the closet

774
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,129
and you didn't pack them
like you usually do?

775
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,090
No, no. Stuff that I packed
is not here.

776
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,366
- Well, that's weird.
- Yeah. That's weird.

777
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,209
[cellphone beeps]

778
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,363
[chuckles]

779
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,164
What's so funny?

780
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,004
Oh, nothing, I guess.

781
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,048
Just a funny text.

782
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,970
Oh yeah?
Who's texting you?

783
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,001
Um...

784
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,848
Wait, he's texting you?

785
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,126
Babe, it's nothing.

786
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,844
It's just a text, okay?

787
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,367
I'm not upset.
I just think it's weird.

788
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,202
They have cellphones?

789
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,844
What plan
do they even have?

790
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,650
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

791
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,250
So nice outside today.

792
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,889
[clears throat] Um...

793
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,122
Can I ask you a question?

794
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,006
Of course.

795
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,482
Why did you do it?

796
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,408
Why did you cheat on me?

797
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,967
I'm sorry.
That's probably...

798
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,490
- That's okay.
- Not something you want to...

799
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,891
No, that's okay.

800
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,847
I have been thinking
about that a bit this weekend,

801
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,441
and

802
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,370
I have no excuse.

803
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,364
Of course I was insecure

804
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,081
and of course we were
drifting apart at the time

805
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,120
and instead of trying
to communicate

806
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,244
I lashed out and I made
a terrible decision,

807
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,961
and

808
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,681
that's...

809
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,801
Right.

810
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,687
No, let me finish.

811
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,002
That's no excuse.

812
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,966
You had every right
to abandon me,

813
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,883
but you didn't,
and you stuck in there with me

814
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,726
and you went to see that stupid
therapist that we see,

815
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,646
even though we didn't want to,
and you kept going,

816
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,769
and you kept trying,
and you met me halfway

817
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:38,688
and I was defensive
and I'm sorry about that.

818
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,041
And I want to say thank you
for making those efforts for us,

819
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,405
and I promise you
I'm going to do my best

820
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,689
to meet you there, okay?

821
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,771
I promise.

822
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,680
Hello.

823
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,927
Hey.

824
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,169
I didn't hear you
get up this morning.

825
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,082
I just came down to see
if there was anything on TV.

826
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,204
What, do you think
I'm lying to you?

827
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,606
No.

828
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,691
No, I was...
Just seemed to...

829
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,409
ls there anything
you want to talk about?

830
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,246
No.

831
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,330
There anything
you want to talk about?

832
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,369
Look, this weekend
is super weird...

833
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,726
- That's okay, right?
- Yeah.

834
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,486
I mean, you know,
I think it can be confusing,

835
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,120
but I just...

836
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,284
You know it's not real, right?

837
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,524
I mean, I'm not that guy
out there doing sit-ups...

838
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:21,200
And I could never
be really interested

839
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,169
in some other version of you,

840
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,762
knowing that my real Sophie
is here...

841
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,048
- Right.
- And I just...

842
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,522
I want to make sure
you still agree.

843
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,766
Yeah.

844
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,881
Of course.

845
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,401
- Okay.
- Yeah.

846
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,561
Okay.

847
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,641
[giggles]

848
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,043
- Okay. We good?
- Yeah, we're good.

849
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,527
- Of course we're good.
- All right.

850
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,891
[cellphone beeps]

851
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,930
<i>Thanks a lot for calling me at two in
the morning. I really appreciate it.</i>

852
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,520
<i>[man] Like I don't have</i> a <i>job
to wake up for tomorrow.</i>

853
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,285
<i>Maybe next time you can't
remember where you live,</i>

854
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,890
<i>you should ask your wife.</i>

855
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,525
<i>I'm not sure
what you were doing</i>

856
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,927
<i>at two in the morning anyway, but...</i>

857
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,208
<i>[woman] Hey, Bunny.
It's mama.</i>

858
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,561
<i>I was just thinking about
our conversation yesterday.</i>

859
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,641
<i>I don't know.</i>

860
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,529
<i>You just didn't sound
like your usual self,</i>

861
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,807
<i>so I just wanted to be sure
you're okay...</i>

862
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,731
<i>[man] Hey, man. The street
you grew up on was Berkman.</i>

863
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,485
<i>Hope that clears things up.</i>

864
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,085
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

865
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,681
Hey.

866
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,201
- Hey.
- Um...

867
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,440
So something really weird
just happened.

868
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,565
I got a bunch of voice mails
from my mom and Doug and Dave

869
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,002
saying I had called them
asking really weird questions,

870
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,882
but I didn't call them.

871
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,762
- That is weird.
- Yeah.

872
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,208
Do you think
you pocket dialed them?

873
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,800
I don't think the pocket dial
makes as much sense

874
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,087
because I was talking
and asking questions.

875
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,481
- I would have...
- So what do you think it was?

876
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,526
Oh, you think
that he called them.

877
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,482
Yeah, and to me
that's a logical conclusion.

878
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,562
He looks like me.
He sounds like me.

879
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,641
He's got a cellphone.

880
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,530
I think he might be
impersonating me or something.

881
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,810
Right. I just don't think that
he would do that.

882
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,962
Do you think
you know him that well?

883
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,488
Well, I mean I know him
a little better than you do.

884
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,085
You've never met him.

885
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,247
But I mean it's weird.

886
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,800
I can totally
ask him if you want.

887
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,526
No, that's okay.

888
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,806
- It's just...
- Okay.

889
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,240
- It's just a weird thing.
- Okay.

890
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,520
It is weird.

891
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,886
I'm going to go to the store.
Do you want me to get you anything?

892
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,531
Uh, no. I'm good.

893
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,326
- Thanks.
- Well, you can come if you want.

894
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,450
Do you mind
if I just hang out here?

895
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,281
- Of course not.
- Okay.

896
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,720
Okay.

897
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,410
Hey, babe.

898
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,040
Uh, sorry.

899
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,726
Great.

900
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,366
Hey.

901
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,410
Is this a bad time?

902
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,801
No, no.

903
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,123
I was, doing some sit-ups.

904
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,771
I need to talk to you.

905
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,200
What do you want
to talk about?

906
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,129
What happened
the last time I was here.

907
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,965
Yeah, that was obviously
important. Yeah.

908
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,123
Ethan, you're so good
at articulating

909
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,363
exactly what it is
that I'm feeling

910
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,330
in a way
that I can't even do,

911
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,448
and it's everything
that I've been wanting to hear,

912
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,522
but now I don't know
what to do.

913
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,844
I can't get it
out of my head.

914
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,487
Well, I'm glad I said

915
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,927
what you wanted to hear,
you know.

916
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,690
Is there anything else
you wanted to see me about?

917
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,764
[heavy breathing]

918
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,440
[whispers] I've missed this.

919
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,325
Me too.

920
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,689
[breathing heavily]

921
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,601
Hi.

922
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,485
Where are the groceries?

923
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,406
What?

924
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,722
What about the store?
What happened?

925
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,768
- The store was closed.
- Oh.

926
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,766
Hey, how about I make us
a couple of mimosas?

927
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,804
I'm not really in the mood
for a mimosa right now, Sophie.

928
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,647
Aw, come on.
It'll be fun.

929
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,162
We'll have a drink.
We'll relax.

930
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,169
Start this day off right.

931
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,365
Then we can talk about
whatever is bothering you.

932
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,287
You know,
that's really good advice.

933
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,482
And I should probably
listen to it...

934
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,603
But you're not a real person.

935
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,604
You know you're not real.

936
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,846
Who the hell are you?

937
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,562
What the hell are you?
Are you a fucking robot?

938
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,043
Are you a...
Like a spirit?

939
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,443
Because I've got to say
it's bad enough

940
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,242
that I'm losing my wife
to a mirror image of me

941
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,288
who happens to be
like 20% cooler

942
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,125
and 20% more emotionally
evolved than me.

943
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,807
Now I have to sit
and look at a mirror image

944
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,167
of exactly who I'm losing.

945
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,170
So, no...

946
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,524
I'm having a hard time
enjoying this weekend

947
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,602
because this is the weekend
I lose my wife.

948
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,763
So, pardon me if I don't want
a fucking mimosa, okay?

949
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,928
It wasn't just this weekend.

950
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,920
How do you know?

951
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,960
Because as your wife,
I know these things.

952
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,365
[sighs]

953
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,766
Shit!

954
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,481
[humming]

955
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,688
Uh-oh. I can't stop it.
I can't stop it.

956
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,808
Look what you did.
Look what you did.

957
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,091
[giggles]

958
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,730
What? Souvenir?

959
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,245
Here comes the firehose.

960
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,525
I'm going to spray you down.
Are you on fire?

961
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,602
Why are you twirling a fire hose?

962
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,409
[Spraying sounds]

963
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,407
Where did you
get this sweater?

964
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,525
What?

965
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,929
Where'd you get this?

966
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,570
I don't know.
I've always had it.

967
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,768
- Really?
- Yeah, you just...

968
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,729
You don't notice
my clothes, I guess.

969
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,968
Do you remember
when you got it?

970
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,969
Do you want to
talk about clothes?

971
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,568
Or would you rather have the
full Chippendales experience?

972
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,971
What's the full experience?

973
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,087
Well...

974
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,049
I don't think
I have enough cash on me.

975
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,771
You just put that away.
You don't worry about that.

976
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,445
[giggling]

977
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,841
Sophie?

978
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,930
Sophie, open the door.

979
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,405
Come on. It's me.

980
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,721
[bangs on door]

981
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,450
I know you're in there
with him, Sophie.

982
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,171
Come on. Open up!

983
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,686
Will you just give me...
Hold on one second.

984
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,049
[Ethan] Sophie, come on.
Let me in.

985
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,681
Sophie.

986
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,967
I'm just going to
keep knocking.

987
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,361
I'm going to keep knocking.

988
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,646
I know what you're
doing in there.

989
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,846
I'm going to keep knocking.

990
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,490
Sophie, let me in.

991
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,130
Come on, Sophie.
Open up.

992
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,684
- Where is he?
- Ethan, what are you doing?

993
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,762
- Where are you?
- Ethan, come on.

994
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,841
Ethan, stop!

995
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,206
I'll beat his ass.
Where are you?

996
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,281
Where are you?

997
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,521
Goddamn it!

998
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,006
Good. He's gone.

999
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,605
What the hell
is going on in here?

1000
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,205
Where did he go?
Look what you did!

1001
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,566
What I did?
Are you insane?

1002
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,641
Yes, what you did.

1003
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,370
What if he never comes back?

1004
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,090
Sophie, come on.

1005
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,884
Sophie, get back here.

1006
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,201
Sophie.

1007
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,362
He is not real, okay?

1008
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,283
Sophie, how can you
accept something

1009
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,805
that you know
is a blatant lie?

1010
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,803
You keep saying
it's not real, it's not real,

1011
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,723
but I'm happy-

1012
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,768
I'm feeling that.
How is that fake?

1013
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,161
Do you hear
how insane you sound?

1014
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,642
You're not admitting that this
is just the least bit weird?

1015
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,683
It's not weird for me any more.

1016
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,521
So what's the endgame? Huh?

1017
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,011
How do you see
this playing out?

1018
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,320
Are you going to
write letters,

1019
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,930
come back and visit
after we leave this weekend?

1020
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,161
I'm not leaving.

1021
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,926
What do you mean,
you're not leaving?

1022
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,087
Sophie,

1023
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,571
what the hell
do you mean you're...

1024
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,007
This is...
Okay, all right.

1025
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,961
Sophie, come on.

1026
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,804
Let's just take
a breath here, okay?

1027
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,565
I know you're feeling
something that is magical

1028
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,005
and clearly exciting to you,

1029
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,368
but if you think about it logically,
literally for one second...

1030
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,966
Is this weird for you now?

1031
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,923
Does anybody remember any of
those fun icebreaker games

1032
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,611
that kids do at summer camp...

1033
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,681
[laughing]

1034
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,046
Spin the bottle

1035
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,124
or seven minutes
in heaven or something...

1036
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,448
Anyhow, we just thought
it was time

1037
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,369
that the four of us sit down

1038
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,249
and get to know each other
a little bit.

1039
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,089
You want to get to
know each other?

1040
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,764
Hi, Sophie.

1041
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,120
Hi.

1042
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,322
Okay. Um...

1043
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,243
Let's get to
know each other.

1044
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,800
Why don't you tell us the truth
of what's really going on?

1045
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,927
The truth?

1046
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,685
Yeah, that you basically
have been pretending to be me,

1047
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,290
acting like
I don't exist

1048
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,567
even though you knew
I was here the whole time.

1049
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,804
Ethan, I wasn't
pretending to be anyone.

1050
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,724
I was just being myself.

1051
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,050
You knew about me, right?

1052
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,169
Did he mention me to you
at any point?

1053
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,770
Not until this morning.

1054
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,490
All right.
Maybe all of us

1055
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,325
were doing a little pretending
this weekend.

1056
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,930
It's not a big deal.

1057
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,684
I really like your shoes.

1058
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,122
Oh, thank you.

1059
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,961
I really like your hair
pinned back like that.

1060
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,645
It's super cute.

1061
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,089
I'm sorry. I still am not
buying that you are real.

1062
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,841
[Ethan 2] Ethan, I'm sitting here,

1063
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,611
you're looking at me
sitting here.

1064
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,920
I'm real.

1065
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,764
You're sitting across
from me, right?

1066
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,245
I'm looking at you
sitting there,

1067
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,081
so by your logic
maybe you're not real.

1068
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,609
That doesn't make any sense.

1069
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,246
I'm starving.

1070
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,800
Ethan, why don't you
clean yourself up

1071
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,245
and we'll all have
a little dinner.

1072
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,441
There.

1073
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,841
So, anybody interested
in going on a hike tomorrow?

1074
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,888
I've been wanting to do that
ever since we got here.

1075
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,325
I would love that.

1076
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,885
All right.

1077
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,042
Tonight though,
I'm thinking game night.

1078
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,406
All right.

1079
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,131
Okay, maybe you're real,
but can we admit

1080
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,322
this isn't some normal
dinner party?

1081
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,050
Ethan, you're looking
a little uncomfortable.

1082
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,286
Can I help you with something?

1083
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,169
Okay, so according to you,

1084
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,288
this is just
some average weekend.

1085
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,805
We all go home tomorrow,

1086
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,208
and you don't need any
further explanation than that?

1087
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,088
Sometimes these things
just happen.

1088
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,242
Yeah, that's right.
They do.

1089
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,206
I don't buy it.

1090
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,841
[Ethan 2] All right.

1091
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,651
One time I read this article
on cosmic occurrences.

1092
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,722
I wish I still had it...
You would love it.

1093
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,366
And it basically says
that aberrations happen.

1094
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,483
You can drive yourself nuts
trying to derive meaning

1095
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,881
from things that have
no meaning to begin with.

1096
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,766
That's so interesting.

1097
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,006
[Ethan 2] It is, isn't it?

1098
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,966
It's not that interesting.

1099
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,605
Let me think
of an little example for you,

1100
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,843
something right up your alley.

1101
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,810
Um...

1102
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,609
Let's say you buy a gorilla.

1103
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,727
Excuse me?

1104
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,084
Let's say you buy
a gorilla, Ethan.

1105
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,283
You can't buy a gorilla.

1106
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,570
I know that,
it was for the story.

1107
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,325
But fine, let's say
you buy an aardvark, okay?

1108
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,926
You take that aardvark,
you put him in a dark room.

1109
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,360
A minute later
you flip that switch,

1110
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,566
the lights come on.

1111
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,290
Now we all know
how electricity works,

1112
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,051
but for him
it's a miracle.

1113
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,760
Magic happened...

1114
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,769
That previously dark room
is now illuminated

1115
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,729
with possibilities
he's never seen before...

1116
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,441
And what does he do?

1117
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,727
Does he ruin it
by questioning how or why?

1118
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,811
No. He enjoys it.

1119
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,281
Huh.

1120
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,409
Well, I'm not an aardvark.

1121
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,009
And I am not a gorilla.

1122
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,925
Don't worry about it.
I got it.

1123
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,281
[sighs]

1124
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,121
Hmm.

1125
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,766
There's a little bit left.

1126
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,607
Should we finish it?

1127
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,081
[sighs] This is quite the situation.

1128
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,646
You can say that again.

1129
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,282
Has Ethan...
I mean your Ethan...

1130
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,486
Have you guys
talked about anything

1131
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,807
or has he said
anything to you at all?

1132
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,087
Like What?

1133
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,490
Well, Ethan... My Ethan and I,
we've discussed it.

1134
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,611
Like he knew when I was
going to go in the house

1135
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,331
and I knew when he was
going to and...

1136
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,129
You shared your experiences.

1137
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,280
Yeah, for the most part.

1138
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,327
And you want to know
if we shared our experiences also.

1139
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,490
Guess I'm just curious.

1140
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,326
I can see that.

1141
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,243
You know what
I'm curious about?

1142
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,040
Are you more concerned
with the experiences

1143
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,202
that me and your Ethan shared

1144
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,728
or are you more concerned
with what I know

1145
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,360
about the experiences
that you and my Ethan shared?

1146
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,811
Seems to me
you care a lot more

1147
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,008
about one of those scenarios
than the other.

1148
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,005
Are you going
to give that back?

1149
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,329
[sighs]

1150
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,723
I say for the sake of
the super fun evening

1151
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,451
we're about to have,
let's keep it simple

1152
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,001
and keep our cheery dispositions

1153
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,567
and I'll keep complimenting
your shoes.

1154
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,760
And you can keep pretending

1155
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,609
that you like the way
I pin my hair back,

1156
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,411
and we'll just have a good time
and see what happens.

1157
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,487
On second thought, do you mind
taking care of those dishes?

1158
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,564
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

1159
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,570
Are we still doing this?

1160
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,723
Are we going to compare
lists of women, too?

1161
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,604
You know, I'm starting to
piece this all together

1162
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,966
and see it for what it is.

1163
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,649
You're trying to
sabotage my relationship.

1164
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,971
Ethan, from what I understand
about your relationships,

1165
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,249
you should be well versed
in the art of self-sabotage.

1166
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,050
The purpose of tonight
is not to engage

1167
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,889
in some warped competition
between us,

1168
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,885
at least not on my end.

1169
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,770
It wouldn't really be fair.

1170
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,010
Yeah? Why is that?

1171
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,205
Haven't you
figured it out yet?

1172
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,481
[Ethan 2] It's kings.

1173
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,801
It's kings or it's aces
is what's going on.

1174
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,609
There's something going on.

1175
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,047
[Sophie] Why don't you worry
about your own cards.

1176
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,769
I don't even know why
we're continuing right now.

1177
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,808
I basically know
every card you're holding.

1178
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,250
Are you saying
that I have a tell?

1179
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,805
You have big tells.

1180
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,048
[whispers indistinctly]

1181
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,650
You want to know
what your tell is?

1182
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,290
I want to know
what you think it is.

1183
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,886
You have a very consistent

1184
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,689
albeit very cute

1185
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,083
Sophie shoulder shrug

1186
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,605
that looks
a little bit like this.

1187
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,329
Oh! Do you do the shrug?

1188
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,320
Uh, excuse me.
Don't talk to her.

1189
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,521
She's dead.
She folded.

1190
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,011
It's just you and me now.

1191
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,160
You did the shoulder shrug.

1192
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,486
You obviously
have a good hand.

1193
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,921
It's like a high pair
or maybe even three of a kind.

1194
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,240
Fucking raise this shit, man.

1195
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,520
You only live once.

1196
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,371
Okay. I'll raise.

1197
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,560
Now I know
you have the confidence.

1198
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,647
I have a shit hand.

1199
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,921
I'm folding.
Look at that.

1200
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,201
Jesus, are you kidding me?

1201
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,521
- What?
- You're right.

1202
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,922
- Pair of aces.
- Ooh!

1203
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,565
Nailed it, nailed it.

1204
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,569
I knew you had the aces.

1205
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,842
Dude, by the way, you're getting
very good at this game...

1206
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,007
Almost too good.

1207
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,560
I'm beginning to think this is
like one long Sophie con.

1208
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,244
He clearly just let you win.

1209
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,288
Yes, Ethan.
Obviously he let me win.

1210
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,361
Come on, guys.

1211
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,160
This is supposed to just
be a friendly game.

1212
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,244
You're not being very fun
to play with.

1213
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,643
The reason he's not being fun
is because he's not even playing.

1214
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,000
Ethan, if you want to
win the game,

1215
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,570
you've got to play
some hands, okay?

1216
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,126
That's just how it works.

1217
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,570
All right.
Fine. I'll play.

1218
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,446
Deal me in.
You and me.

1219
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,607
Come on.

1220
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,170
You want to play one on...

1221
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,281
Okay. All right.
That's the spirit.

1222
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,880
Come on, buddy.
Let's get in the game.

1223
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,967
Let's go.

1224
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,481
Mmm-hmm.

1225
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,766
All right.

1226
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,604
How many cards do you want?

1227
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,320
I'm fine with what I have.

1228
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,646
Thank you very much.

1229
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,600
Sticking with what you have.

1230
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,125
All right. I'll stick
with what I have, too.

1231
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,281
What's your move?

1232
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,801
I'm all in.

1233
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,521
Oh!

1234
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,162
All in, bold move!

1235
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,561
But you've got to be impulsive
sometimes. I really like it.

1236
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,081
All right, so you're all in,

1237
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,642
and now I've got to figure out
what is your tell.

1238
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,844
You've got that restless
leg thing going on

1239
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,570
but I think it's just nerves.

1240
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,324
You've been chewing
on the lower lip a little bit,

1241
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,607
but I get ulcers in there, too,

1242
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,808
so maybe that's just
what that is.

1243
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,126
So weird lip...

1244
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,248
Oh!

1245
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,527
Oh, shit!
Of course. There it is.

1246
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,569
The guy who has nothing
and he knows it.

1247
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,007
Sorry, buddy, but I've got to
call you on this one.

1248
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,201
What you got?

1249
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,840
Whatever.

1250
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,487
You have nothing

1251
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,881
and I win with an ace high.

1252
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,800
Sorry about that, man.

1253
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,800
It's fun playing with you, but you've
got to work on your bluffing skills.

1254
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,807
You win.

1255
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,211
You're an amazing liar.

1256
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,442
Congratulations on being a shithead.

1257
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,040
- Whoa!
- Ethan, Jesus. Calm down.

1258
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,610
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1259
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,331
I don't want to take
all the credit here.

1260
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,846
You're a pretty decent liar
yourself, right?

1261
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,810
What are you talking about?

1262
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,520
Do you want to tell her
or should I?

1263
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,681
Is this necessary?

1264
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,842
I think it's important that
Sophie knows what's going on.

1265
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,007
We're all friends here, right?

1266
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,526
Uh, would everybody just tell me
what we're talking about?

1267
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,806
What happened?

1268
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,927
It's nothing.

1269
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,371
[Ethan 2] All right, look,

1270
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,568
Ethan was a little suspicious that
something was going on between us,

1271
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,211
so he decided to try
and figure it out for himself.

1272
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,289
It was actually kind of
a brilliant move.

1273
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,771
He didn't go
to the grocery store.

1274
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,366
He ended up sneaking
into the guest house,

1275
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,408
and in a strange
twist of events,

1276
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,962
he pretended to be me,

1277
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,641
so you actually slept with Ethan
instead of me.

1278
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,923
I can't fucking pretend
to be you... lam me.

1279
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,042
You... What the fuck
are you talking about?

1280
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,282
Just shut up!
Sophie, please.

1281
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,930
That was you yesterday?

1282
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,965
Sweetheart...

1283
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,129
[Ethan 2] Basically,
first he betrayed

1284
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,770
you by sleeping with someone else

1285
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,408
and then he kind of betrayed you
by sleeping with you.

1286
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,201
Sorry, guys. I didn't want to make
like a thing here.

1287
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,805
If you guys need
some space or something.

1288
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,809
If you want to like
take the guest house,

1289
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,046
you'd be welcome.

1290
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,360
I'm not going anywhere.

1291
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,848
No, I want you to leave.

1292
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,611
<i>[therapist] ...if not,
leave a detailed message</i>

1293
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,806
<i>and I will return your call.</i>

1294
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,211
[beeps]

1295
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,520
Hey. It's Ethan.

1296
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,523
Um, I'm really just calling
to thank you

1297
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,649
for your wonderful
recommendation this weekend.

1298
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,880
Maybe next session you can send us
to a fucking holocaust museum.

1299
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,200
Thank you very much.

1300
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,801
[groans]

1301
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,131
<i>[man] All right, so we have to hit
the keys at the exact same time.</i>

1302
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,406
<i>This is a strange exercise.</i>

1303
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,720
<i>On three, okay?</i>

1304
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,926
<i>One...</i>

1305
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,240
<i>[woman] All right.
[man] Two.</i>

1306
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,481
<i>Three.</i>

1307
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,967
<i>[therapist] You met in
Scottsdale, Arizona.</i>

1308
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,648
<i>We met in
Scottsdale, Arizona.</i>

1309
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,802
<i>Madison, you have
two sisters, right?</i>

1310
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,405
<i>[man] Yes, two sisters.</i>

1311
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,409
<i>I'm the middle child,
and my dad wasn't present.</i>

1312
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,527
Why are you here?

1313
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,080
<i>[therapist] You were raised in
a predominantly female household</i>

1314
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,849
<i>and you had serious...</i>

1315
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,728
Ethan and Sophie.

1316
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,646
Holy shit!

1317
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,491
<i>[therapist] All right.
Try it again.</i>

1318
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,241
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1319
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,920
<i>[woman] I</i> am <i>Sophie.</i>

1320
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,606
<i>[man] I am Ethan.</i>

1321
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,200
<i>[woman] I</i> am <i>Sophie.</i>

1322
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,251
<i>[man] I am Ethan.</i>

1323
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,045
<i>[woman] I</i> am <i>Sophie.</i>

1324
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,971
<i>[man] I am Ethan.</i>

1325
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,925
<i>[woman] I</i> am <i>Sophie.</i>

1326
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,885

01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,081
<i>[man] I am Ethan.</i>

1331
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,247
What the hell is this?

1332
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,321
<i>[woman] I</i> am <i>Sophie.</i>

1333
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,851
<i>[man] That's getting good.</i>

1334
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,564
<i>You're almost ready.</i>

1335
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,444
I never took that picture.

1336
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,522
No, no, no, no.

1337
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,371
No!

1338
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,681
What the...

1339
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,401
Shit!

1340
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,601
Somebody help!

1341
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,767
Help!

1342
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,444
Help! Sophie!

1343
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,931
Sophie, can you hear me?

1344
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,769
Sophie, I'm stuck.

1345
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,447
[Sophie] Hey.

1346
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,488
Sophie? Sophie, I'm in here.

1347
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,050
Sophie, I'm in here.

1348
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,963
Sophie! I'm stuck.

1349
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,367
[indistinct chatter]

1350
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,641
[door opens]

1351
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,370
- What the...
- We don't have much time.

1352
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,442
They think I'm out
picking fruit for breakfast.

1353
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,681
What?

1354
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,643
Okay. A lot happened
last night after you left.

1355
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,844
Do you know
that you're Sophie?

1356
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,921
Are you pretending?

1357
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,206
I don't know,
what's happening?

1358
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,321
I'm not your wife.

1359
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,729
Okay. What the fuck's going on,
and who are you?

1360
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,325
He fell in love with her.

1361
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,051
He's not supposed to
fall in love with her.

1362
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,764
She's supposed to fall
out of love with you.

1363
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,723
That's how this works.
That's how we get out.

1364
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,325
What the hell are you
talking about? I don't...

1365
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,091
- That's how we become you.
- You become us?

1366
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,004
Pitting you against each other
is the best way to break you down,

1367
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,491
and then
it's your turn to stay.

1368
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,846
What the fu...
What the fuck?

1369
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,007
Oh, my God.

1370
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,286
Did you try to
get out last night?

1371
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,486
- Yes.
- You couldn't.

1372
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,761
No.

1373
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,640
That's because the closer
we get to moving on,

1374
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,682
the closer you get
to not being able to.

1375
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,205
Do you remember
when you first got here?

1376
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,481
I was stuck here.

1377
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,164
You had to come see me.
Now look.

1378
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,567
Ethan.

1379
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,570
Ethan, it's not going to work.

1380
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,051
I have to be the one
to let you out.

1381
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,880
Well, what?
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

1382
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,604
I don't want to be trapped here.

1383
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,603
- What do you...
- You're not trapped yet.

1384
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,011
I can get you out.

1385
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,288
Listen, only two people
can leave today.

1386
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,891
I don't understand.
Why would you help me

1387
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,803
if you're trying to get
yourself out of here?

1388
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,001
Because I love him.

1389
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,320
And I'd rather be trapped here
than see him leave with her.

1390
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,763
So you have real feelings
like love and jealousy,

1391
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,171
like a real person?

1392
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,161
I am real.

1393
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,324
We should bring a couple
extra bottles of water.

1394
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,090
This hike can be
a little strenuous.

1395
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,648
How long is the hike?

1396
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,088
I was just thinking I should
probably check on Ethan.

1397
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,764
- See if he's okay.
- It's only like an hour.

1398
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,601
Plus, I think it's good if he cools
down in the guest house, you know.

1399
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,204
Hey, we're getting
ready to head out.

1400
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,441
You want to get changed?

1401
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,768
Well, all my clothes
are back at the guest house,

1402
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,841
and I agree.

1403
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,729
I think we should give
Ethan his space.

1404
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,931
I have an extra pair of shoes.

1405
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,883
We're probably the same size.

1406
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,602
Well, that's top's
really cute on you.

1407
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,051
Do you have anything
like that?

1408
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,807
I have another one.

1409
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,404
Come on, girls.
Let's go.

1410
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,011
They're just right in there,

1411
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,401
the bottom drawer,
and there are some extra shoes.

1412
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,086
Great. Thanks so much.

1413
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,527
Sure. Do you need
anything else?

1414
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,402
Um, well, my toothpaste
and toothbrush is over there.

1415
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,561
Do you have anything?

1416
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,285
Sure, I'll get you something.

1417
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,881
Just give me one minute, please.

1418
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,166
It's important.

1419
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,650
Did you find
some clothes for her?

1420
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,285
Yep. She'll be down
in a minute.

1421
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,767
Good.

1422
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,729
What? Do you understand how
insane you sound right now?

1423
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,406
Yes, I understand, but this whole
fucking weekend has been crazy.

1424
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,249
Think about it. Everything
they knew about us...

1425
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,365
The missing clothes and the
phone calls to my mom and my friends.

1426
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,361
This entire weekend has been
one planned trap, Sophie.

1427
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,971
I'm glad we have a second alone,

1428
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,724
because I wanted to talk to you.

1429
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,045
You do, really?

1430
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,050
I want to talk to you, too.

1431
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,005
What do you want to say?

1432
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,891
You go first.

1433
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,845
I've been thinking a lot
about things.

1434
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,329
I don't want to leave
with Ethan.

1435
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,203
I want to leave with you.

1436
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,448
I want to leave with you, too.

1437
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,924
I love you, Sophie.

1438
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,810
You're not Sophie.

1439
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,921
Where is she?

1440
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,881
Where is she?

1441
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,406
Sophie?

1442
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,366
Come here.

1443
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,081
Sophie?

1444
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,325
Here, come in here,
come in here.

1445
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,526
Sophie?

1446
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,681
Look, I don't have
a lot of time, okay?

1447
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,761
Sophie.

1448
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,683
And I'm not going
to get this right,

1449
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,091
but I don't want you to leave.

1450
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,366
I don't want you
to leave me, Sophie.

1451
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:28,088
Look, I know he is handsome
and smart and eloquent,

1452
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,845
and he makes cool
aardvark metaphors, okay?

1453
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,365
[Ethan 2] Sophie! You know I love you.

1454
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:36,001
And I'm difficult,
and I'm stubborn

1455
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,131
and I know
that I've been defensive,

1456
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,803
and I haven't been
what you needed...

1457
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,881
[Ethan 2] Sophie!

1458
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,162
And I take a big part of the
responsibility for why this happened.

1459
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,765
Okay? But listen to me,

1460
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,965
[pounds on door]

1461
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,765
I'm your husband,

1462
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,165
and you're my wife...

1463
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,924
And I am not letting you go.

1464
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,685
[Ethan 2] Sophie, unlock the door.

1465
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,365
We're a mess,
and I love that about us,

1466
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,171
and I don't want to be perfect.
I want to be us. So please...

1467
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,770
[Ethan 2] Sophie, he's lying.

1468
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,129
Just give me a chance
before he comes in here.

1469
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,041
I love you.

[pounds on door]

1471
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,168
Sophie, what is he
telling you?

1472
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,048
Sophie, Sophie, it's me.

1473
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,121
Come on. Sophie...

1474
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,531
We're leaving. Okay.

1475
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,807
Ethan, I need you to step out
of the way, please.

1476
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,881
Excuse me.

1477
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,001
Ethan.

1478
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,168
- Excuse me.
- Ethan!

1479
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,401
You son of a bitch.

1480
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,644
Ethan, stop!

1481
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,961
Stop it!

1482
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,484
Ethan, stop it!

1483
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,041
You guys, come on.

1484
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,884
This is ridiculous.

1485
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,086
Sophie.

1486
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,126
All right.

1487
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,563
That was a stupid fight.

1488
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,488
Sophie, come on.

1489
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,088

1490
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,411
Sophie!

1491
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,401
Fine.

1492
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,928
I'm going to fuck
all you guys.

1493
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,883
What happens if
he can't catch him?

1494
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,007
I have no idea.

1495
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,241
Ethan!

We've got to get out of here.

It was a full-on
grand theft covers.

1508
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,487
I need a visual.

1509
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,800
Look at this.
Come see.

1510
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,241
You were basically a tootsie roll,

1511
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,051
wrapped up, rolled over
onto your side,

1512
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,044
and you abandoned me
on the other side of the bed

1513
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,202
and I froze my titties off
all night.

1514
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,691
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

1515
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,205
That's what you did to me,
your husband.

1516
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,805
- That's horrible.
- It really is.

1517
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,928
- What kind of a wife is that?
- I don't know. You're awful.

1518
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,047
You owe me big time.

1519
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,485
Why didn't you just
take the covers back?

1520
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,722
Because you looked really cute
and I didn't want to wake you up.

1521
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,609
Right. No, that makes sense...

1522
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,569
I must have been pretty cute.

1523
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,001
That was...
That was pretty good,

1524
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,929
but you're going to have to do
a little more than that.

1525
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,525
- More?
- I need something else.

1526
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,720
- Something else?
- Mmm-hmm.

Uh, what would you say
if I made you breakfast?

1528
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,885
I'm not going to say
anything more.

let this happen.
