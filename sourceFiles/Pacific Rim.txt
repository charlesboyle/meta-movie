1
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,041
<i>When I was a kid,
whenever I 'd feel small or lonely...</i>

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,045
<i>...I'd look up at the stars.</i>

3
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,007
<i>Wondered if there was life
up there.</i>

4
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,924
<i>Turns out I was looking
in the wrong direction.</i>

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,527
<i>When alien life entered our world it was
from deep beneath the Pacific Ocean.</i>

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,923
<i>A fissure between two tectonic plates.</i>

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,411
<i>A portal between dimensions.</i>

8
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,970
<i>The Breach.</i>

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,885
<i>I was 15 when the first Kaiju
made land in San Francisco.</i>

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,569
<i>By the time tanks,
jets and missiles took it down...</i>

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,280
<i>...six days and 35 miles later...</i>

14
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,687
<i>...three cities...</i>

15
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,688
<i>...were destroyed.</i>

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,320
<i>Tens of thousands...</i>

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,005
<i>...of lives were lost.</i>

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,203
<i>We mourned...</i>

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,202
<i>...our dead...</i>

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,600
<i>...memorialized the attack...</i>

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,641
<i>...and moved on.</i>

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
<i>And then, only six months</i> later...

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,161
<i>...the second attack...</i>

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,965
<i>...hit Manila.</i>

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,929
<i>The acid factor of the Kaiju blood...</i>

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,401
<i>...creates a toxic phenomenon
named Kaiju Blue.</i>

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,723
<i>And then the third one hit Cabo.</i>

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,290
<i>And then the fourth.</i>

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,407
<i>And then we learned...</i>

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,764
<i>...this was not gonna stop.</i>

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,201
<i>This was just the beginning.</i>

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,288
<i>We needed...</i>

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,282
<i>...a new weapon.</i>

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,120
<i>The world came together...</i>

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,448
<i>...pooling its resources
and throwing aside...</i>

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,841
<i>...old rivalries...</i>

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,525
<i>...for the sake of the greater good.</i>

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,923
<i>To fight monsters...</i>

44
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,242
<i>...we created monsters of our own.</i>

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,242
<i>The Jaeger program...</i>

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,760
<i>...was born.</i>

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,442
<i>There were setbacks at first.</i>

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,649
<i>The neural load to interface...</i>

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,690
<i>...with a Jaeger proved too much
for a single pilot.</i>

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,882
<i>A two-pilot system
was implemented.</i>

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,920
<i>Left-hemisphere, right-hemisphere
pilot control.</i>

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,690
<i>We started winning.</i>

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,084
<i>Jaegers stopping Kaijus
everywhere.</i>

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,482
<i>But the Jaegers were only as good
as their pilots.</i>

57
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,680
<i>So Jaeger pilots...</i>

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,126
<i>...turned into rock stars.</i>

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,122
Danger...

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,600
<i>...turned into propaganda.</i>

61
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,323
Kaijus...

62
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,322
<i>...into toys.</i>

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,885
<i>We got really good at it.</i>

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,723
<i>Winning.</i>

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,526
Then...

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,723
<i>Then it all...</i>

68
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,041
<i>...changed.</i>

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,048
<i>Gipsy Danger report to Bay 08,
level A-42.</i>

71
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,041
<i>Kaiju. Code name: Knifehead.
Category 3. 8700 metric tons.</i>

72
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,209
Yo, Yancy, wake up! Movement...

73
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,441
...in the Breach.

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,401
- Hey, come on! We're being deployed.
- Great.

75
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,802
- Good morning.
- Morning.

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,370
Kaiju's a Category 3, biggest one yet.

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,206
Code name: Knifehead.

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,608
- What time is it?
- Two.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,081
A.M.?

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,367
Yep.

81
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,769
What do you say?
Fifth notch on the belt?

83
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,086
<i>Come on, Baskets.</i>

84
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,606
Time for the drop.

85
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,842
Hey, kid.

86
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,808
Yeah?

87
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,810
Don't get cocky.

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,686
<i>Years before...</i>

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,367
<i>...you wouldn't have picked my
brother Yancy and I for heroes.</i>

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,204
<i>No chance.</i>

91
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,046
All right, let's suit up and kick some ass!

92
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,088
<i>We were never star athletes.</i>

93
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,163
<i>Never at the head of the class.</i>

94
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,650
<i>But we could hold our own
in a fight.</i>

95
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,206
<i>And it turned out we had...</i>

96
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,601
<i>...a unique skill:</i>

97
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,928
<i>We were Drift compatible.</i>

99
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,371
<i>Data on helmet.</i>

100
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,924
<i>Data relay gel
dispersing in circuitry suit.</i>

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,890
<i>Good morning, Becket boys!</i>

102
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,124
- Tendo, what's happening, my man?
- How'd that date with Alison...

103
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,606
<i>...go last night, Mr. Choi?</i>

104
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,888
Oh, she loved me.
Her boyfriend? Not so much.

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,009
You're gonna get your ass kicked.

106
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,601
<i>Ha, ha. A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, brother.</i>

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,285
Engage drop, Mr. Choi.

108
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,851
Engaging drop, sir.

109
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,129
Marshal Pentecost on deck.

110
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,247
Securing the Conn Pod.

111
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,528
Getting ready to drop.

112
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,929
Conn Pod door lock secure.

113
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,891
- Release for drop.
- Gipsy Danger...

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,160
...ready for the big drop.

115
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,041
- Here we go.
- Yeah!

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,645
Here we go!

117
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,760
Coupling confirmed, sir.

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,882
Engage pilot-to-pilot protocol.

119
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,084
- Engaging now.
<i>- Pilot to-pilot connection...</i>

120

Gipsy Danger...

123
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,761
- ...ready and aligned, sir.
- Rangers, this is Marshal...

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,526
...Stacker Pentecost.
Prepare for neural handshake.

125
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,046
Starting in 15 seconds.

126
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,320
Fourteen...

<i>...twelve, eleven, ten.</i>

129
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,963
Ready to step into my head, kid?

130
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,168
Please, after you. Age...

131
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,004
- ...before beauty, old man.
<i>- Pilot-to-pilot connection...</i>

<i>Gentlemen, your orders...</i>

149

...are to hold the miracle mile
off Anchorage. Copy?

150
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,760
<i>Copy that, sir.</i>

151
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,645
Sir, there's still a civilian vessel
in the Gulf...

152
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,370
You're protecting a city
of two million people.

153
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,841
You will not risk those lives
for a boat that holds ten.

154
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,000
<i>- Am I clear?</i>
- Yes...

155
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,327
- ...sir.
- Man, that's cold.

156
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,886
You know what I'm thinking.

157
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,360
I'm in your brain.

158
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,011
- I know.
- Then let's go fishing.

159
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,603
Here we go!

160
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,320
Come on, bro!
Put some muscle to it!

161
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,201
Worry about yourself, kiddo!

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,966
<i>You can win.</i>

169
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,006
Get them tied down...

170
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,045
...and go down below! Now!

171
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,446
How far to the mainland?

172
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,205
Seven miles off Anchorage, sir.

173
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,408
But we won't even make it
past the shallows.

174
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,607
No, we won't!

175
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,320
What about that island
three miles east?

176
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,449
No! It's two miles, sir.

177
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,885
One mile, sir!

178
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,724
It's getting closer.

179
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,481
How the hell...

180
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,125
...can it be getting closer?

182
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,126
Kaiju.

184
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,930
Harder starboard!

185
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,968
Turn her around!

186
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
Now!

188
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,963
- Oh, God!
- What the hell?

190
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,608
Hang on!

191
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,001
<i>Ship secure.</i>

192
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,964

<i>- Shoot him.
- I'm on it! I'm on it!</i>

198

Discharge reading, sir.

199
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,561
Plasma cannon in the shallow shelves...

200
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,001
- ...seven miles off the coastal line.
- Gipsy...

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,402
<i>- ...what the hell is going on?</i>
- Job's done, sir.

202
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,047
Lit it up twice. Bagged our fifth kill.

203
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,170
- You disobeyed a direct order!
<i>- Respectfully,</i> sir...

204
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,169
...we intercepted a Kaiju...

205
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,407
...and saved everyone...

206
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,520
- ...on that boat.
- Get back to your post. Now!

207
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,723
Yes, sir.

208
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,882
Kaiju signature rising!

209
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,969
That thing's still alive, sir.

210
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,208
Gipsy!

211
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,805
<i>We're still getting a signature!</i>

212
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,448
<i>That Kaiju is still alive!</i>

213
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,163
<i>Grab the boat and get out of there.</i>

214
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,403
<i>You copy?</i>

215
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,160
<i>Grab the boat
and get out of there now!</i>

217
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,369
Take it, Raleigh!

218
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,402
I got this!

220
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,320
Loccent, we're hit!

222
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,688
Left arm's...

223
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,126
...gone cold, sir.

224
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,480
The hull! It went through the hull!

225
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,720
Raleigh, listen to me!

226
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,762
You need... Aah!

227
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,650
No!

228
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,927
No!

230
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,165
<i>Loading.</i>

232
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,720
Second discharge fried all the comms,
sir. I'm not getting any signals.

233
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,605
No signatures, sir.

234
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,084
What do we do now, sir?

235
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,009
Now, I want you to keep your eye
on that gauge there.

236
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,763
Now, you know what I'd like to find?

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,447
I'd like to find a whole ship.
That's what I'd like to find.

238
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,251
Wait, wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Wait!

239
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,363
Right there, right there! Dig!

240
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,605
Hey, what is it?

241
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,523
It's just an old toy.

242
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,281
We never find anything good.

243
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,651
Listen.

245
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,849
Oh, my God.

248
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,205
Stay here!

250
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,280
Mister?

251
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,485
Can I help?

252
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,006
Yancy.

253
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,406
Yancy.

254
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,521
Run! Get help, fast!

255
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,806
It's gonna be all right.

257
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,246
<i>The Kaiju are learning our defenses.</i>

258
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,165
<i>They're adapting. Evolving.</i>

259
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,245
<i>And we're losing Jaegers faster
than we can build them.</i>

260
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,361
<i>Lima.</i>

261
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,205
<i>Seattle.</i>

262
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,171
<i>Vladivostok.</i>

263
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,211
<i>Category 4 Kaijus...</i>

264
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,930
<i>...are now coming through the Breach.</i>

265
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,925
<i>I think even you can see,
marshal, this is no longer...</i>

266
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,286
<i>...a sound strategy.</i>

267
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,528
<i>The frequency of the attacks
has increased.</i>

268
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,890
<i>The Jaegers are not the most viable
line of defense anymore.</i>

269
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,121
I am aware.

270
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,009
Those are my rangers that die...

271
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,611
...every time a Jaeger falls...

272
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,285
...which is why I'm asking you...

273
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,363
- ...for one last chance.
<i>- Excuse me, marshal.</i>

274
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,251
One final assault
with everything we've got.

275
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,244
<i>The Jaeger program is dead, marshal.</i>

276
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,244
<i>On the other hand, the coastal wall...</i>

277
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,323
<i>...program is a promising option.</i>

278
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,531
<i>The world appreciates
all that you and your men have done...</i>

279
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,687
<i>...but it's over.</i>

280
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,161
<i>We will authorize you to take
all remaining Jaegers...</i>

281
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,721
<i>...to the last battle station: Hong Kong.</i>

282
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,526
<i>We're prepared to fund you...</i>

283
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,410
<i>...for the next eight months
while the coastal wall...</i>

284
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,806
<i>...is completed.</i>

285
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,805
<i>After that, you will receive
no further support.</i>

286
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,929
<i>You have your answer, marshal.</i>

287
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,688
So that's it?

288
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,601
It's over?

289
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,124
Suits and ties, flashy smiles.

290
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,806
That's all they are, Stacker.

291
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,165
We don't need them.

293
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,567
Eight hundred more beams.

294
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,890
Ration cards, guys! Come on, come on!

295
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,246
Let's go!

296
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,246
Now, I got good news and I got
bad news, fellas. Which one...

297
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,209
- ...you wanna hear first?
- Bad news!

298
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,920
Bad news:

299
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,325
Three guys died yesterday
working the top of the wall.

300
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,165
- What's the good news?
- The good news is...

301
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,202
...I got three new job openings.

302
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,044
Top of the wall.

303
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,200
Okay, who wants to work?
Who wants to eat?

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,365
<i>Come on!</i>

305
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,088
<i>I am here in Sydney, where earlier today...</i>

306
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,891
<i>...yet another Kaiju attack took place.</i>

307
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,726
<i>The Kaiju, an enormous Category 4...</i>

308
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,644
<i>...broke through the coastal wall...</i>

309
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,291
<i>...in less than an hour.</i>

311
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,449
<i>The Wall of Life had been deemed
unbreachable by its builders.</i>

312
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,520
Why the hell...

313
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,170
...are we even building this thing?

314
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,770
That thing went through the wall
like it was nothing.

315
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,927
<i>Ironically, it was...</i>

316
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,726
 <i>...the recently decommissioned Jaeger,
Striker Eureka...</i>

317
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,842
<i>...piloted by Herc...</i>

318
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,770
<i>...and Chuck Hansen that finally...</i>

319
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,041
<i>...took the beast down.</i>

323
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,411
<i>Look, they decommissioned
the Jaeger program...</i>

324
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,529
<i>...because of mediocre pilots.
It's that simple.</i>

325
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,082
<i>That's Striker Eureka's tenth kill
to date. It's a new record.</i>

326
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,963
<i>And you're still going to Hong Kong,
even at a time like this?</i>

327
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,931
<i>Well, orders are orders.
What else am I supposed to do?</i>

328
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,002
<i>Chuck Hansen, one of the pilots...</i>

329
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,207
...of Striker Eureka...

330
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,761
<i>...the Jaeger that took down the Kaiju.</i>

331
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,811
Mr. Becket.

332
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,723
Marshal.

333
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,691
Looking sharp.

334
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,160
Long time.

335
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,364
Five years, four months.

336
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,720
Can I have a word?

337
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,482
Step into my office, marshal.

338
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,523
Took me a while to find you.

339
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,569
Anchorage, Sheldon Point, Nome...

340
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,006
Yeah, a man in my position...

341
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,164
...travels with the wall,
chasing shifts to make a living.

342
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,731
What do you want?

343
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,085
I've spent the last six months activating
everything I can get my hands on.

344
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,970
There's an old Jaeger, a Mark 3.

345
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,567
You may know it. It needs a pilot.

346
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,609
I'm guessing I wasn't your first choice.

347
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,409
You are my first choice.

348
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,325
All the other Mark 3 pilots are dead.

349
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,040
Look...

350
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,089
...I can't have anyone else
in my head again.

351
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,406
I'm done.

352
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,450
I was still connected to my brother
when he died.

353
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,445
I can't go through that again, man,
I'm sorry.

354
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,362
Haven't you heard, Mr. Becket?

355
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,683
The world is coming to an end.

356
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,762
So where would you...

357
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,967
...rather die?

358
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,283
Here, or in a Jaeger?

360
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,246
Mr. Becket...

361
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,811
...this is Mako Mori.

362
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,405
One of our brightest.

363
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,688
Also in charge of the Mark 3
restoration program.

364
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,281
She personally handpicked
your copilot candidates.

366
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,161
Hey.

368
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,166
At ease.

369
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,165
We will tour the facility first...

370
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,607
...and then Miss Mori will show you
to your Jaeger, Mr. Becket.

371
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,602
- Wait for us, please!
- Hold the door...

372
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,211
- ...please!
- Thank you.

373
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,204
Thank you. Thank you.

374
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,449
Stay back. Kaiju specimens
are extremely rare...

375
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,687
...so look but don't touch, please.

376
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,207
Mr. Becket, this is our research team.

377
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,442
Dr. Gottlieb and Dr. Geiszler.

378
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,767
Oh, no, call me Newt.

379
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,968
Only my mother calls me Doctor.

380
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,201
Hermann, these are human beings.
Why don't you say hello?

381
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,001
I have asked you not to refer to me
by my first name around others.

382
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,400
I am a doctor with over 10 years
of decorated experience...

383
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,726
Ten years! I'm very sorry.

384
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,241
- Oh, please.
- Who is that...

385
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,282
...Yamarashi?

386
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,205
Oh, this little Kaiju?
Yeah, you got a good eye.

387
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,330
My brother and I took him down in 2017.

388
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,600
You know he was one of the biggest
Category 3s ever?

389
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,161
He was 2500 tons of awesome.

390
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,043
Or awful. You know,
whatever you wanna call it.

391
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,442
Please excuse him. He's a Kaiju
groupie. He loves them.

392
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,485
Shut up, Hermann, I don't love them,
okay? I study them.

393
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,650
And unlike most people, I wanna see
one alive and up close one day.

394
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,682
Trust me...

395
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,921
...you don't want to.

396
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,888
So that's your Research Division?

397
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,884
Things have changed.

398
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
We're not an army anymore, Mr. Becket.

399
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,649
We're the resistance.

400
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,204
Welcome to the Shatterdome.

401
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,442
War clock. We reset it after every
Kaiju attack. Keeps everyone focused.

402
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,569
The frequency of attacks
is accelerating.

403
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,131
How long till the next reset?

404
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,402
A week, if we're lucky.

405
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,200
My experts believe
there'll be a Kaiju attack...

406
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,640
...even before that.

407
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,041
This complex used to lodge...

408
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,369
...30 Jaegers in five bays
just like this one.

409
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,681
Now we only have four Jaegers left.

410
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,410
I didn't know it was this bad.

411
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,210
It is that bad.

412
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,603
Crimson Typhoon, China.
One of the greatest.

413
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,123
Assembled in Changzhou.
Full titanium core, no alloys.

414
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,966
Fifty diesel engines
per muscle strand.

415
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,440
Deadly, precise fighter.

416
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,929
She's piloted by the Wei Tang
brothers. Triplets.

417
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,321
Local lads.

418
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,604
They've successfully defended
Hong Kong port seven times.

419
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,569
They use the Thundercloud formation.

420
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,882
Hell, yeah. Triple-arm technique.

421
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
Very effective.

422
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,130
That tank, last of the T-90s.
Chemo Alpha.

423
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,081
First generation Mark 1. The heaviest
and oldest Jaeger in the service.

424
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,403
But make no mistake, Mr. Becket,
it's a brutal war machine.

425
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,527
And those two:

426
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,489
Sasha and Aleksis Kaidanovsky.

427
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,008
Yeah, I've heard of them.
Perimeter patrol, Siberian wall.

428
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,162
On their watch it stayed
unbreached for six years. Six years.

430
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,007
Herc! Chuck!

431
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,171
Gentlemen, welcome to Hong Kong!

432
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,761
Wait here.

433
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,090
Max! Come here!

434
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,241
- Remember me?
- Don't drool...

435
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,402
...over Miss Mori. Sees a pretty girl...

436
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,766
...and he gets all wound up.

437
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,567
Raleigh, this is Hercules Hansen,
an old friend from the Mark 1 glory days.

438
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,480
I know you, mate.
We rode together before.

439
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,682
We did, sir. Six years ago.
My brother and I.

440
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,888
- It was a three Jaeger team drop.
- That's right. Manila.

441
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,246
Sorry about your brother.

442
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,211
Thank you, sir.

443
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,250
Herc and his son Chuck'll be running
point using Striker Eureka.

444
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,562
Fastest Jaeger...

445
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,883
...in the world.
First and last of the Mark 5s.

446
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
Australia decommissioned it
a day before the Sydney attack.

447
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,922
- Yeah, it was lucky we were still around.
- Yep.

448
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,606
- Now it's running point for us.
- Wait, running point on what?

449
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,207
You haven't told me
what I'm doing here yet.

450
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,804
We're going for the Breach, Mr. Becket.

451
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,369
We're gonna strap a 2400 pound
thermonuclear warhead to Striker's back.

452
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,204
Detonate an equivalent of 1.2...

453
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,090
...million tons of TNT.

454
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,890
And you and two other Jaegers...

455
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,487
- ...will be running defense for them.
- Thought we were the resistance.

456
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,365
Where'd you get something that big?

457
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,208
See the Russians back there?
They can get us anything.

458
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,407
Herc, shall we?

459
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,409
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you, sir.

460
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,887
- I'll show you to your Jaeger now.
- Miss Mori...

461
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,680
...will you give me a minute?

462
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,001
Marshal!

463
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,767
Sir, we've hit the Breach before.
It doesn't work. Nothing goes through.

464
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,967
What's changed?

465
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,803
I've got a plan. I need you ready.
That's all.

466
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,530
Let's go, Herc!

467
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,886
Max, come here!

468
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,002
<i>Crew 17...</i>

469
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,969
<i>...please report to the fifth floor.</i>

470
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,005
Zero minus two.

471
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,244
XY minus two. R-E-Q...

472
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,847
In the beginning, the Kaiju attacks
were spaced by 24 weeks.

473
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,206
Then twelve, then six,
then every two weeks.

474
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,444
The last one in Sydney was a week.

475
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,327
In four days...

476
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,011
...we could be seeing
a Kaiju every eight hours...

477
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,049
...until they are coming
every four minutes.

478
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,329
Marshal, we should witness a double
event within seven days.

479
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,489
Mr. Gottlieb, I'm to drop a 2400 pound
thermonuclear bomb...

480
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,607
...I need more than...

481
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,444
- ...a prediction.
- Well, uh...

482
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,806
...that's a problem, then...

483
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,050
...because see, he actually can't give
you anything more than a prediction.

484
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,124
No Kaiju entrails over my side
of the room. You know the rules.

485
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,523
- Every bloody day. It's incessant.
- Gents! On point.

486
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,924
Numbers do not lie.

487
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,209
Politics and poetry, promises,
these are lies.

488
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,330
Numbers are as close as we get
to the handwriting of God.

489
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,040
- What?
- Would you give me a moment?

490
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,691
There will be a double event.

491
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,731
And then, shortly thereafter,
three. And then four...

492
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,530
And then we're dead.

493
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,762
- I get it.
- Alas.

494
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,002
This is where the good news comes.

495
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,367
Here is our universe...

496
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,521
...and here is theirs.

497
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,800
And this is what we call "The Throat,"
the passage between the Breach and us.

498
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,405
We know that it's atomic in nature.

499
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,246
I predict that the increased traffic...

500
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,801
...will force the Breach to stabilize...

501
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,411
...and remain open long enough...

502
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,642
...to get the device through...

503
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,844
...and collapse its structure.

504
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,520
Yeah, and that's...

505
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,682
...where I gotta chime in because,
really...

506
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,760
...I wouldn't wanna go in there with
that limited amount of information.

507
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,643
Newton, don't embarrass yourself.

508
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,961
Just hear me out for a second.
Give me a second.

509
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,122
Please.

510
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,488
Why do we judge the Kaiju
on a category system?

511
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,721
It's because each one...

512
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,840
...is completely different
from the next, right?

513
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,406
You see what I'm saying? Like, one looks
like a shark and one looks like a fish...

514
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,529
Dr. Geiszler. Just get to the point.

515
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,841
- Yes.
- The point is...

516
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,008
...I don't think they're all
completely different after all.

517
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,081
These are some samples
I collected, all right?

518
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,322
Now, this one here
was harvested in Sydney.

519
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,767
And this was harvested in Manila.

520
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,007
Six years ago.

521
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,809
They have the same exact DNA.

522
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,090
They're clones.

523
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,003
And this is...

524
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,323
...the point where he goes
completely crazy.

525
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,641
NEWT: There's so much more
to the Kaiju than we understand.

526
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,962
And we've really only scratched
the surface.

527
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,561
This is a piece of a Kaiju's brain.

528
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,929
Now, unfortunately, it's damaged.
It's a little bit weak.

529
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,208
But it's still alive. Now, I think...

530
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,561
...I can tap into it...

531
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,371
...using the same technology
that allows the two Jaeger pilots...

532
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,726
...to share a neural bridge.

533
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,450
Now, think about that.

534
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,569
I could tell you exactly...

535
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,520
...how to get through
the Breach yourselves.

536
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,007
You're suggesting that we initiate
a Drift with a Kaiju?

537
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,881
No, no. No, no. Not like a whole Kaiju,
you know, just a tiny piece of its brain.

538
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,043
The neural surge would be too much...

539
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,361
- ...for the human brain.
- I agree.

540
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,921
- I don't agree.
- Gottlieb...

541
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,162
...I'd like your data on my desk ASAP.

542
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,083
Sir.

543
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,482
- No, but his is so...
- Thank you, Newt.

544
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,842
Guys, now, this is the most amazing
thing...

545
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,162
Newton, I know that
you're desperate to be right...

546
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,846
...so you've not wasted your life
being a Kaiju groupie...

547
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,286
...but it's not going to work.

548
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,528
It is going to work, Hermann.
And I'll tell you...

549
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,807
...something else.

550
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,088
- Fortune favors the brave, dude.
- You heard them.

551
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,011
They won't give you the equipment
and even if they did...

552
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,241
...you'd kill yourself.

553
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,568
Or I'd be a rock star.

554
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,445
There she is.

556
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,290
Oh, my God.

557
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,281
Look at her.

558
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,088
<i>Gipsy Danger.</i>

559
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,006
God, it's so beautiful.

560
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,446
She looks like new.

561
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,562
Better than new.

562
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,201
She has a double-core
nuclear reactor.

563
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,082
She's one of a kind now.

564
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,084
She always was.

565
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,648
How do you like your ride, Becket boy?

566
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,805
Solid iron hull, no alloys.
Forty engine blocks per muscle strand.

567
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,281
Hyper-torque driver for every limb
and a new fluid...

568
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,760
...synapse system.

569
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,481
Come here.

570
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,326
Tendo. It's good to see you, buddy.

571
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,726
It's good to see you too, brother.
It's just like old times.

572
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,889
So, what's your story?

573
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,363
Restoring old Jaegers,
showing has-beans like me around.

574
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,525
That can't be it.

575
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,047
You a pilot?

576
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,044
No. Not yet.

577
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,081
But I wanna be one...

578
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,446
...more than anything.

579
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,684
What's your simulator score?

580
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,924
Fifty-one drops, 51 kills.

581
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,446
Wow, that's amazing.

582
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,848
But you're not
one of the candidates tomorrow?

583
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,251
I am not.

584
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,244
The marshal has his reasons.

585
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,525
Yeah, he always does, doesn't he?

586
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,570
But with 51 kills,
I can't imagine what they could be.

587
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,520
I hope you approve of my choices.

588
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,206
I've studied your fighting techniques
and strategy.

589
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,206
Even Alaska.

590
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,930
And what do you think?

591
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,281
I think you're unpredictable.

592
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,526
You have a habit of deviating
from standard combat techniques.

593
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,401
You take risks that endanger
yourself and your crew.

594
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,371
I don't think you're the right man
for this mission.

595
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,730
Wow.

596
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,722
Thank you for your honesty.
You might be right.

597
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,444
But one day, when you're a pilot,
you're gonna see that in combat...

598
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,009
...you make decisions.

599
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,688
And you have to live
with the consequences.

600
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,042
That's what I'm trying to do.

601
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,720
The candidates are ready.

602
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,002
We will commence
the trials immediately, sir.

603
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,810
- Good.
- But there is one thing.

604
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,611
Mako, we have talked about this.

605
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,247
We will not be talking about it again.

606
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,004
You promised me.

608
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,450
Mako.

609
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,449
Vengeance is like an open wound.

610
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,121
You cannot take that level of emotion
into the Drift.

611
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,322
For my family, I need...

614
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,406
Raleigh.

615
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,411
Come sit with us.

616
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,130
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

617
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,931
Ah, come on,
there's plenty of room at our table.

618
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,129
I haven't seen bread in a while.

619
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,725
Hong Kong.

620
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,849
Beauty of an open port, no rationing.

621
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,051
We've got potatoes, peas,
sweet beans, decent meat loaf.

622
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,486
Pass the potatoes.

623
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,320
Raleigh, this is my son...

624
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,324
...Chuck. He's my copilot now.

625
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,800
He's more my copilot.

626
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,530
Right, Dad?

627
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,444
So you're the guy, eh?

628
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,284
You're the guy who's gonna run defense
for me...

629
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,126
- ...in that old rust bucket of yours?
- That's the plan.

630
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,327
Good.

631
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,801
So when was the last time
you jockeyed, Ray?

632
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,169
About five years ago.

633
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,768
What have you been doing for five years?
Something pretty important, I reckon.

634
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,966
I was in construction.

635
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,328
Oh, wow, that's great.

636
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,210
I mean, that's really useful.

637
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,886
We get into a fight, you can build
our way out of it, eh, Ray?

638
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,006
It's Raleigh.

639
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,721
Whatever.

640
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,607
Look, you're Pentecost's bright idea.

641
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,524
And my old man, he seems to like you.

642
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,082
But it's guys like you who brought
down the Jaeger program. To me...

643
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,327
...you're dead weight.

644
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,607
You slow me down...

645
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,842
...I'm gonna drop you
like a sack of Kaiju shit.

647
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,206
I'll see you around, Raleigh.
Come on, Max.

648
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,526
You can blame me for that one.
I've raised him on my own.

649
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,445
He's a smart kid, but I never knew
whether to give him a hug...

650
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,205
...or a kick in the ass.

651
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,930
With respect, sir...

652
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,082
...I'm pretty sure which one he needs.

655
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,971
Four points to 0.

657
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,246
Four points to 1.

659
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,328
Four points...

660
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,402
...to 2.

661
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,247
Okay, what?

662
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,968
You don't like them?

663
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,042
I thought you selected them...

664
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,202
...personally.

665
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,327
Excuse me?

666
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,491
Every time a match ends
you make this little gesture...

667
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,520
...like you're critical
of their performance.

668
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,405
It's not their performance,
it's yours. Your gambit.

669
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,130
You could have taken...

670
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,731
...all of them two moves earlier.

671
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,923
You think so?

672
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,122
I know so.

673
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,209
Can we change this up?

674
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,448
How about we give...

675
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,727
...her a shot.

676
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,807
No. We stick to
the cadet list we have, ranger.

677
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,969
Only candidates with Drift
compatibility...

678
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,406
Which I have, marshal.

679
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,244
Mako, this is not only
about a neural connection.

680
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,448
It's also about a physical compatibility.

681
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,761
What's the matter, marshal?

682
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,041
Don't think your brightest
can cut it in the ring with me?

683
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,206
Go.

684
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,721
Four strikes marks a win.

685
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,481
Remember, it's about compatibility.

686
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,361
It's a dialogue, not a fight.

687
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,080
But I'm not gonna dial down my moves.

688
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,562
Okay.

689
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,484
Then neither will I.

690
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,762
One-zero.

692
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,802
One-one.

693
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,329
Two-one. Concentrate.

695
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,722
Two-two.

696
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,007
Better watch it.

697
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,486
Oh.

698
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,365
Three-two.

700
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,803
Enough.

702
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,560
I've seen what I need to see.

703
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,406
Me too.

704
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,404
She's my copilot.

705
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,563
That's not going to work.

706
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,963
Why not?

707
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,725
Because I said so, Mr. Becket.

708
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,604
I made my decision. Report to...

709
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,009
...the Shatterdome in two hours
and find out who your copilot will be.

710
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,680
Mako.

711
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,090
What was all that about?

712
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,763
I mean...

713
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,684
...I'm not crazy. You felt it, right?

714
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,681
We are Drift compatible.

715
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,570
Thank you for standing up for me.

716
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,569
But there is nothing to talk about.

718
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,890
That's my room.

719
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,006
Excuse me.

720
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,120
I mean, come on.
I thought you wanted to be a pilot.

721
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,043
Mako...

722
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,123
...this is worth fighting for.

723
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,765
We don't have to just obey him.

724
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,204
It's not obedience, Mr. Becket.

725
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,525
It's respect.

726
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,286
Would you at least tell me...

727
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,760
...what his problem is?

728
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,440
<i>In the wake...</i>

729
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,690
<i>...of the Sydney incident
which showed the ineffective nature...</i>

730
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,969
<i>...of the Wall of Life program,
many are questioning...</i>

731
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,080
<i>...the government's motives
and wondering why...</i>

732
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,851
<i>...the Jaeger program
has been discontinued.</i>

733
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,651
<i>Riots have erupted
along the coastlines of several...</i>

734
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,802
<i>...Pan Pacific...</i>

735
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,768
<i>...cities.</i>

736
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,483
<i>We have now relocated
millions of civilians and supplies...</i>

737
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,121
<i>...300 miles inland
to the safe zones.</i>

738
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,126
<i>Safe zones? For the rich and powerful?
What about the rest of us?</i>

739
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,560
<i>Yeah, answer the question.</i>

740
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,843
<i>I believe the Wall of Life
is still our best option at this time.</i>

741
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,200
<i>And that's all I'm gonna say
on the matter. Thank you.</i>

742
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,800
Kaiju/Human...

743
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,928
...Drift experiment, take one.

744
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,365
The, uh...

745
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,325
The brain segment is the frontal lobe.

746
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,166
Um, chances are...

747
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,727
...the segment's far too damaged
to Drift with.

748
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,328
Unscientific aside:

749
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,006
Hermann,
if you're listening to this...

750
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,807
...well, I'm either alive and
I've proven what I've just done works...

751
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,650
...in which case, ha, ha, I won...

752
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,451
...or I'm dead and I'd like you to know
that it's all your fault.

753
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,125
It really is. You know,
you drove me to this.

754
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,327
In which case...

755
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,050
...ha, I also won.

756
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,280
Sort of.

757
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,243
I'm going in in three...

758
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,565
...two...

759
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,242
...one.

764
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,964
Newton. Newton!

765
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,885
What have you done?

766
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,767
<i>Gipsy Danger neural test commencing...</i>

767
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,001
<i>...in 20 minutes.</i>

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,088
<i>Gipsy Danger...</i>

00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,800
<i>...neural test commencing...</i>

770
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,610
<i>...in 20 minutes.</i>

771
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,647
<i>Gipsy Danger neural test...</i>

774
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,129
May I come in, Mako?

775
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,605
A long time ago...

776
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,365
...I made you a promise.

778
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,684
These transmitters are non-operative.
I need them replaced.

779
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,685
<i>Setting harness for test mode.</i>

780
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,365
Waiting for second pilot.

781
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,925
<i>Two pilots on board.</i>

782
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,364
I'm gonna take this side if you don't
mind. My left arm's kind of shot.

783
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,647
Sure.

784
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,363
Are you gonna say anything?

785
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,961
No point. In five minutes
you're gonna be...

786
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,565
...inside my head.

787
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,326
You look good.

788
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,803
<i>Pilots on board and ready to connect.</i>

789
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,400
- Prepare for neural handshake.
- Initiating...

790
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,607
...neural handshake.

791
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,327
Okay.
We're not in the simulator now, Mako.

792
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,211
Remember, don't chase the rabbit.

793
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,283
Random Access Brain Impulse
Triggers. Memories.

794
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,363
Just let them flow, don't latch on.

795
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,523
Tune them out. Stay in the Drift.

796
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,761
The Drift is silence.

797
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,281
<i>Neural interface Drift initiated.</i>

798
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,090
<i>Raleigh!</i>

801
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,250
<i>Mama!</i>

802
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,288
<i>Raleigh, listen to me!
Raleigh, listen to me!</i>

804
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,401
<i>Right hemisphere calibrated.</i>

805
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,484
<i>Left hemisphere calibrated.</i>

806
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,249
<i>Ready to activate...</i>

807
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,686
<i>...the Jaeger.</i>

808
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,964
Okay, Gipsy. Lining up nicely.

809
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,811
Better get ready.

810
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,809
<i>Pilot to Jaeger connection complete.</i>

811
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,969
Marshal! Marshal!

812
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,247
I need to talk to you.

813
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,647
Not now, Mr. Gottlieb.

814
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,400
I'm sure you can appreciate
how important this moment is to me.

815
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,048
Newton created a neural bridge from
garbage and Drifted with a Kaiju.

816
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,210
I found him prone...

817
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,051
...and he's sort of dazed.

818
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,329
I don't exactly know what to do.

819
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,046
I told you it would work.

820
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,880
Yes, you did.
Well, what'd you see?

821
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,722
It was only a fragment of a brain, so
really all I was able to get was, like...

822
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,769
...a series of, uh, images...

823
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,087
...or impressions.

824
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,051
Like when you blink your eyes over and
over and over again all you really see...

825
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,930
...are, like, frames. It was emotion.

826
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,082
Newton, Newton.

827
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,324
Okay, Newton. Newton, look at me.

828
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,730
Now I want you to take your time
and be very specific.

829
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,766
Okay. Okay.

830
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,121
Well, I don't feel like they're just
following some sort of animalistic urge...

831
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,841
...you know, just hunting and gathering.

832
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,803
And I think they're attacking us
under orders.

833
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,121
That's impossible.

834
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,961
- Is that impossible?
- It's impossible.

835
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,888
Why don't you...

836
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,723
...Drift with a Kaiju?

837
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,450
You! Shut up!

838
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,520
You, keep talking.

839
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,809
These beings, these masters,
they're colonists.

840
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,969
They overtake worlds.
They just consume them...

841
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,884
...and then they move on to the next.

842
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,244
And they've been here before
in sort of a trial run.

843
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,122
It was the dinosaurs.

844
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,044
But the atmosphere
wasn't conducive, right?

845
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,169
So they waited it out.
And they waited it out.

846
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,244
And now with ozone depletion,
and carbon monoxide, polluted waters...

847
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,767
...well, we've practically
terraformed it for them.

848
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,241
Because now they're coming back,
and it's perfect.

849
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,321
See, the first wave,
that was just the hounds.

850
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,080
Categories 1 through 4,
it was nothing.

851
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,009
Their sole purpose was to aim
for the populated areas...

852
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,287
...and to take out the vermin: Us!

853
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,046
The second wave,
that is the exterminators.

854
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,368
And they will finish the job. And then...

855
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,567
...the new tenants...

856
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,926
...will take possession.

857
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,921
See, the reason that I found the identical
DNA in the two separate Kaiju organs...

858
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,810
...is because they are grown!

859
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,441
Newton, I need you to do it again.

860
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,768
I need more information.

861
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,248
I can't do it again.

862
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,962
I mean, not unless you have
a fresh Kaiju brain...

863
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,247
...lying around.

864
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,481
Do you?

865
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,242
Pretty impressive.

866
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,045
Yeah, he remembers how to turn it on.

867
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,890
Oi, show some respect.

868
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,726
When his brother died, he got
the Jaeger back to shore on his own.

869
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,121
I've known one other pilot
that's been able to do that.

870
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,246
Now, there are certain individuals
whose business is the preservation...

871
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,323
...and exploitation of Kaiju remains.

872
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,767
Uh, yeah, right, um,
black market dealers, right?

873
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,963
Yep. They're in and out
in a matter of hours.

874
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,123
They neutralize the acidic factor
of the blood...

875
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,930
...and they harvest what they need.

876
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,970
Now, this guy, this is Hannibal Chau.

877
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,851
He runs the Kaiju black market...

878
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,525
...here in Asia.
When our funding ran out...

879
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,245
...we turned to him for help
and in return...

880
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,767
...I gave him exclusive rights
to all Kaiju remains in the region.

881
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,967
You did that?

882
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,804
Last days of war, gentlemen.

883
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,486
Go to the corner of Pong...

884
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,165
...and Tull. Show them that card.

885
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,646
Look for that symbol.

886
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,486
And a word to the wise, do not trust him.

887
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,321
<i>Calibration...</i>

888
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,005

00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,523
<i>The hull!
Went through the hull!</i>

890
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,410
Raleigh, listen to me! You need...

892
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,723
<i>Pilot...</i>

00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,566
- Both out of alignment.
- Both of them?

896
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,320
Both of them.

897
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,482
Gipsy, Gipsy! You're out of alignment!

898
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,967
<i>- You are both out of alignment.</i>
- I'm okay. Just let me control it.

899
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,443
<i>- Out of alignment. Code red: TENDO.
- You're stabilizing. But Mako is way out.</i>

900
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,449
<i>She's starting to chase the rabbit!</i>

901
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,961
Mako, don't get stuck in a memory.

902
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,441
Stay with me. Stay in the now.

903
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,921
Don't engage in a memory.

904
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,730
Mako.

905
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,645
Mako! Listen to me.

906
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,405
Mako?

907
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,726
<i>Mama!</i>

908
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,327

00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,600
Mako.

915
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,362
This is just a memory.

916
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,250
None of this is real.

Oh, no.

925

Weapon system engaged!

926
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,967
Go to fail-safe!

927
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,921
Fail-safe not responding. There's
a problem with the neural blocker!

928
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,680

<i>- Fully charged.</i>

930
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,409

00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,410
Take them offline!

937
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,408
Take them offline!

938
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,361

Hello.

00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,807
Pss, pss.

- ...bone powder?
- Some...? Some bone...?

954

Some bone powder?

955
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,362
Uh, no, why would I want that?

956
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,726
Male potency.

958
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,802
I take it myself.

959
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,801
I see. Uh, no, thank you.

960
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,882

962
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,726
Come.

You want Chau, huh?

964
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,085
Good luck.

966
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,050
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
this place is heaven!

967
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,046
That's a lymph gland from a Category 2!
And what are you working on here?

968
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,806
Is this a cuticle? In mint condition?

969
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,367
Is that a Kaiju skin parasite?
I've never seen them alive before!

970
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,001
They usually die
as soon as the Kaiju falls!

971
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,640
- I thought you couldn't keep them alive!
- You can if you soak them in ammonia.

972
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,887
What do you want?

973
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,880
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.
I was told...

974
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,201
...he was here.

975
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,080
Who wants to know?

976
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,081
I really can't say.

978
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,240
Stacker Pentecost sent me!

980
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,451
Oh, that's great. That's real great.

981
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,762
So I take it you're Hannibal Chau, right?

982
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,082
You like the name? I took it...

983
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,850
...from my favorite historical character...

984
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,361
...and my second-favorite
Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn.

985
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,091
Now tell me what you want...

986
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,011
...before I gut you like a pig
and feed you to the skin louse.

987
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,088
<i>She can't control...</i>

988
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,290
<i>- ...her Drift, and he went out of phase first!
- We all know what happened.</i>

989
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,889
<i>We can't afford mistakes. The Kaiju
keep evolving, they keep kicking our asses!</i>

990
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,122
<i>He's a has-been, she's a rookie.</i>

991
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,443
<i>I don't want them protecting
my bomb run, sir.</i>

992
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,485
You need to watch your tone,
Mr. Hansen.

993
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,848
Hey, stay there.

994
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,090
Give me a moment.

995
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,807
You two are a goddamn disgrace.

996
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,443
You're gonna get us all killed,
and here's the thing, Raleigh:

997
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,883
I want to come back
from this mission...

998
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,327
...because I quite like my life.

999
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,650
So why don't you just do us all
a favor and disappear?

1000
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,280
It's the only thing you're good at.

1001
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,481
Stop! Now!

1002
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,605
Yeah, that's right.

1003
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,690
You just hold back
your little girlfriend.

1004
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,882
One of you bitches needs a leash.

1005
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,083
Apologize to her.

1006
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,282
Screw you.

1008
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,242
I said apologize to her.

1009
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,287
Hey, hey! Enough!

1010
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,042
What's going on?

1011
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,723
On your feet, both of you!

1012
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,402
Becket...

1013
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,489
- ...Mori, into my office.
- No, we aren't finished!

1014
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,886
This is over!

1015
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,520
You're a ranger, for chrissake.
Why don't you start acting...

1016
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,602
...like one?

1017
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,724
<i>I went out of phase first.</i>

1018
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,088
- It was my mistake.
- No.

1019
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,041
It was my mistake.

1020
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,800
I should have never let you two
in the same machine.

1021
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,120
So, what...

1022
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,486
...you're grounding us?

1023
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,085
Not you.

1024
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,400
Permission to be dismissed, sir.

1025
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,001
Permission granted, Miss Mori.

1026
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,722
Mako.

1027
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,851
Sir, what are you doing?

1028
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,686
She is the strongest candidate by far.

1029
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,049
What other options do we have?
Huh? Tell me!

1030
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,483
Do not let my calm demeanor fool you...

1031
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,960
. . ranger!

1032
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,163
Now is not a good moment...

1033
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,050
...for your insubordination!

1034
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,564
Mako is too inexperienced to rein in
her memories during combat.

1035
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,206
That's not why...

1036
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,726
...you grounded her.

1037
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,689
I was in her memories.
I saw everything.

1038
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,208
I don't care what you think you saw.

1042
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,689
I know what she means to you. I saw it!

1043
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,201
Hey! Hey!

1044
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,204
This conversation is over.

1045
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,848
Marshal. Marshal,
can we just talk about this...

1046
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,161
...for one second?

1047
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,161
You rescued her.

1048
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,844
You raised her.

1049
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,048
You're not protecting her now.

1050
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,924
You are holding her back.

1051
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,491
One:

1052
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,802
Don't you ever touch me again.

1053
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,087
Two:

1054
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,681
Don't you ever touch me again.

1055
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:41,045
Now, you have no idea who the hell
I am or where I've come from...

1056
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,681
...and I'm not about to tell you
my whole life story.

1057
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,566
All I need to be to you
and everybody on this dome...

1058
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,888
...is a fixed point.

1059
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,122
The last man standing.

1060
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,720
I do not need your sympathy
or your admiration.

1061
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,965
All I need is your compliance
and your fighting skills.

1062
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,360
And if I can't get that...

1063
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:05,281
...then you can go back to the wall
that I found you crawling on.

1064
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,847
Do I make myself clear?

1065
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,562
Yes, sir.

1066
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,526
Good.

1069
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,160
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1070
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,689
<i>I should've warned you.</i>

1071
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,568
<i>First Drifts are rough.</i>

1072
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,680
But you weren't just tapping
into my memories...

1073
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,484
...you were tapping into my brother's...

1074
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,642
...too.

1075
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,763
When Yancy was taken,
we were still connected.

1076
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,885
I felt his fear, his pain,
his helplessness...

1077
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,201
...and then...

1078
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,046
...he was gone.

1079
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,001
I felt it. I know.

1080
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,806
You know, you live in someone else's
head for so long...

1081
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,122
...the hardest part to deal with
is the silence.

1082
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,883
To let someone else in,
to really connect...

1083
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,368
...you have to trust them.

1084
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,685
And today the Drift was strong.

1085
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,561
Her heart.

1086
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,362
When's the last time you saw it?

1087
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,480
Not in a long time.

1088
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,288
<i>Movement in the Breach.</i>

1089
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,362
<i>Double event.</i>

1090
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,204
<i>Two signatures.</i>

1091
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,405
<i>Dilation indicator, Category 4.</i>

1093
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,920
- Excuse me.
- Breach was exposed...

1094
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:20,881
...at 2300 hours.

1095
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,881
We have two signatures...

1096
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:23,961
...both Category 4s.

1097
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,009
Code names:
Otachi and Leatherback.

1098
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,571
They'll reach Hong Kong
within the hour.

1099
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,882
Evacuate the city.
Shut down the bridges.

1100
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,566
I want every single civilian
in a refuge right now.

1101
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,560
<i>Crimson Typhoon...</i>

1102
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,687
Chemo Alpha...

1103
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,564
...I want you to frontline the harbor.

1104
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,046
Stay on the miracle mile.

1105
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,204
Striker, I want you to stay back,
look after the coastline.

1106
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,047
We cannot afford to lose you,
so only engage as a final option.

1107
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,247
Yes, sir!

1108
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,248
You two.

1109
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,285
You stay put.

1110
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,401
Let's go!

1111
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,048
<i>Loccent, Striker's got the ball...</i>

1112
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,486
...and we're on the roll.

1113
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,206
Loccent...

1114
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,687
...near positions...

1115
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,530
...and awaiting your orders.

1116
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,209
<i>Remain in the miracle mile.
Engage at your discretion.</i>

1117
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,646
<i>Guys, keep your eyes open.</i>

1118
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,963
<i>These Category 4s are the biggest
we've ever seen, both in size and weight.</i>

1119
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,365
<i>Chemo Alpha reaching target zone.</i>

1120
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,165
Disengaging transport.

1122
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,686
<i>Chemo Alpha in position. Miracle mile.</i>

1123
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,928
Chemo Alpha holding the coastline.

1124
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,491
<i>Beacon is on.</i>

1126
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,606
Look at them.

1127
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,763
They believe the Kaiju
were sent from heaven.

1128
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,049
That the gods are expressing their
displeasure with our behavior.

1129
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,725
The silly bastards.

1130
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,371
And what do you believe?

1131
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,567
Well...

1132
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,688
...I believe that Kaiju bone powder
is 500 bucks a pound.

1133
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,604
- What do you want?
- I need to access...

1134
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,730
...a Kaiju brain. Completely intact.

1135
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,840
No, no. The skull plate is so dense
that by the time you drill into it...

1136
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,445
The brain's rotted away.
But I'm talking...

1137
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,966
...about the secondary brain.

1138
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,521
Now we both know
that the Kaiju are so large...

1139
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,967
...they need two brains to move
around, like a dinosaur.

1140
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,440
I want to get my hands on that.

1141
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,931
Mm. What the hell do you want
a secondary brain for, anyway?

1142
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,401
I mean, every part of the Kaiju sells.

1143
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,330
Cartilage, spleen, liver.

1144
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,681
Even the crap!

1145
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,651
One cubic meter of crap
has enough phosphorous in it...

1146
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,211
...to fertilize a whole field!

1147
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,811
But the brain...

1148
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,964
Too much ammonia.

1149
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,325
So, what's the deal, little fella?

1150
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,210
Well, that's classified.

1151
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,966
So I couldn't tell you.
Even if I wanted to.

1152
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,289
- Mm.
- But it is pretty cool.

1153
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,490
So I might tell you.

1154
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,885
I'm gonna tell you.

1155
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,208
I figured out how to Drift
with a Kaiju.

1156
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,647
Are you funning me, son?

1157
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,729
It's fascinating how their minds work.

1158
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,161
Every single Kaiju...

1159
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,606
...his mind's connected.

1160
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:24,881
The species has, like...

1161
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,770
Like a hive mind.

1163
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,529
Holy jeez.

1164
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,770
You've gone and done it, haven't you?

1165
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,484
I did it a little bit, yeah.

1166
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,808
You goddamn moron.

1174
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,120
Loccent! Typhoon...

1175
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,531
...and Alpha are in trouble.

1176
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,443
<i>We're moving in!</i>

1177
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,967
You are to hold your ground.
Do not engage.

1178
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,611
<i>We need you to carry that bomb.</i>

1179
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,927
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1181
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,520
Jesus, we can't just sit here...

1182
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,880
...and watch them die. Come on!

1183
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:38,723
Screw this.

1184
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,768
Loccent, we're moving in...

1185
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,411
<i>...now!</i>

1189
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,841
Chemo Alpha,
we've been hit with some type of acid!

1190
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,365
- Come on!
- Hull has been compromised.

1191
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,525
We need backup immediately!

1192
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,760
Just hold on, Chemo!

1193
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,245
<i>We're on our way!</i>

1196
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,369
Our power move! Yeah!

1199
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,280
We just lost Chemo, sir.

1201
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,007
Engaging...

1202
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:50,923
...air missiles!

1205
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,846
What's going on? What happened?

1206
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,447
The blast. It jumbled all the Jaegers'
electrical circuits.

1207
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,046
What the hell was that?

1208
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,401
I've never seen that before.

1209
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,681
- Loccent!
- They're adapting.

1210
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,127
This isn't a defense mechanism,
it's a weapon!

1211
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,287
Get me Striker.

1212
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,280
Nothing, sir. The Mark 5's digital's fried.

1213
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,922
It'll take me two hours to reroute the auxiliary.
All the Jaegers, they're digital!

1214
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,884
Not all of them, marshal.

1215
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,408
Gipsy's analog. Nuclear.

1216
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,845
We got two Kaijus.
We gotta get out. This way.

1217
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,969
Hang on a second. Excuse me.
What's going on?

1218
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,680
There are two goddamn Kaiju
headed straight for Hong Kong City.

1219
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,762
No, that's not possible.

1220
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,922
There's never been two before.

1221
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:09,563
Well, maybe that's because nobody ever
Drifted with one before, eh? Genius!

1222
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,690
When Jaeger pilots Drift,
it's a two-way street.

1223
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,002
A bridge, right?
It sets up a connection.

1224
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,770
Both ways!

1225
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,569
"A hive mentality," you said!

1226
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,246
Maybe those Kaiju are trying to find you.

1227
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,085
What're we gonna do?

1228
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,051
I'm gonna wait out this shitstorm
in my own private Kaiju bunker.

1229
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,931
But you are going to a public refuge.

1230
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,161
I tried it once.

1231
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,771
Once.

1232
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,280
Now get the hell out of here.

1239
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,962
Move! Move! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor!

1240
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,171
Okay, hold on. Let me in.

1241
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,568
Okay, I'm a doctor. Okay, let me in,
I'm a doctor.

1242
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,041
- There's no emergency power.
- We gotta bail.

1243
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,248
- I'm gonna try something else.
- No!

1244
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,642
<i>Don't disengage!</i>

1246
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:11,922
My arm!

1247
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,571
Come on! Get on your feet, old man!

1248
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,048
Don't call me that!

1249
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,281
<i>He's right outside.
We gotta get out of here now!</i>

1250
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,050
<i>We're not going anywhere!</i>

1251
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,081
Now you and I are the only thing
standing between that ugly bastard...

1252
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,680
...and a city of 10 million people.

1253
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,808
Now we have a choice here.
We either sit and wait...

1254
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:36,880
...or we take these flare guns
and do something really stupid.

1256
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,920
- How's your arm?
- Ah, just give me the gun.

1257
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:54,928
Hey, you!

1259
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,370
I think we just pissed it off!

1261
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,562
All right, Mako.

1262
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,609
Get ready, this is for real!

1263
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,961
- Yeah!
- Come on, Gipsy!

1264
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,846
Kick his ass!

1266
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,283
Come on!

1267
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,567
Let's do this! Together!

1268
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,362
<i>Elbow rocket!</i>

1269
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,448
<i>Elbow rocket...</i>

1270
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,408
...engaged.

1271
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,086
Now!

1273
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,847
Hang on, Mako!

1274
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,849
<i>Plasma cannon, now!</i>

1275
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,889
<i>Plasma cannon engaged.</i>

1276
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,086
Empty the clip!

1277
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,130
<i>Empty the clip!</i>

1279
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,965
<i>Wait.</i>

1280
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,161
I think this guy's dead.

1281
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,402
But let's check for a pulse.

1282
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,363
Okay.

1283
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,046
No pulse.

1289
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,090
He stopped right above us.

1290
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,041
Oh, my God.

1291
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,964
Oh, my God. This isn't a refuge.

1292
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,326
This is a buffet line!

1294
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,006
He knows I'm here.

1295
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,408
- He knows I'm here!
- Shh. He knows we're all here.

1296
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,484
No, you don't understand, he's trying
to get me! He knows I'm here!

1298
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,408
What was she saying?
I gotta get out of here!

1299
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,566
Let me out of here!

1300
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,290
Oh, come on!

1301
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,246
Those were expensive glasses.

1302
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,886
This is the worst.

1306
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,247
<i>Torque...</i>

1307
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,641
<i>...engaged.</i>

1310
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,171
I can't pinpoint it.

1311
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,971
It's moving quick. Keep your eyes open.

1312
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,650
<i>Choppers, do you have
a visual? Over.</i>

1314
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,566
Come on!

1315
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,241
I'll hold it!

1316
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,165
- Vent the coolant on the left flank!
- Coolant venting.

1317
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,121
Venting coolant.

1320
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,728
<i>Atmosphere loss in progress.</i>

1321
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,881
Temperature's dropping!

1322
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,967
We're losing oxygen!

1323
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:54,889
Both plasma...

1324
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:55,961
...cannons are shot.

1325
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,684
We're out of options, Mako.

1327
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,845
<i>Sword deployment.</i>

1329
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,644
<i>Altitude actuation off-balance.</i>

1330
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,287
<i>50,000 feet to ground contact.</i>

1331
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:35,680
Look, there!

1332
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,682
<i>Altitude loss...</i>

1333
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,410
<i>...critical.</i>

1334
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,326
<i>40,000 feet.</i>

1335
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,601
<i>Gipsy, listen to me!</i>

1336
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,167
<i>Loosen all the shock
absorbers, use your gyroscope...</i>

1337
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,561
<i>...as balance and ball up!</i>

1338
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,490
<i>It's your only chance!</i>

1339
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,886
<i>20, 000...</i>

1340
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,531
<i>...feet.</i>

1341
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:56,882
Fuel purge!

1342
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:58,961
<i>Now!</i>

1343
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,803
<i>Impact alert.</i>

1344
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,485
<i>We're coming in too fast.</i>

1345
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,489
<i>We're coming in too fast!
Brace for it, Mako!</i>

1349
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:39,000
Mako, talk to me.

1350
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,771
Mako, you okay?

1351
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:44,922
Yeah.

1352
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,128
You?

1354
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,367
- Go to Dr. Geiszler now!
- Yes, sir!

1355
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,365
I want the two remaining Jaegers back
to 100 percent functionality.

1356
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,840
Yes, sir!

1357
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,402
We're gonna harvest...

1358
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,688
...the skin, the talons and the wing.

1359
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,323
Germans are gonna go nuts
for that stuff.

1360
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,164
Let me see that map.

1361
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,281
Here is where the Kaiju fell, here's
where we concentrate our efforts.

1362
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,766
- We'll get it, boss.
- Right.

1363
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,001
Hey!

1364
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:29,443
Okay.

1365
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,411
Guess who's back,
you one-eyed bitch?

1366
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,162
And you owe me a Kaiju brain.

1368
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,808
Raleigh!

1369
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,283
My kid'd never admit it...

1370
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,600
...but he's grateful.

1371
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,606
We both are.

1373
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,442
Mr. Becket!

1374
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:08,886
Miss Mori!

1375
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,210
In all of my years fighting...

1376
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,125
...I've never...

1377
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,085
...seen anything like that.

1378
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:21,960
Well done.

1379
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,407
Proud of you.

1380
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,765
Proud of us all.

1381
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,326
But...

1382
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,087
...as harsh as it sounds...

1383
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,086
...there is no time to celebrate.

1384
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,682
We lost two crews.

1385
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,089
No time to grieve.

1386
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,651
Reset that clock.

1388
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,001
Reset the clock.

1391
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,723
I still can't believe what you did to me.
I mean, I could have been eaten.

1392
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,644
Well, that was definitely the plan.

1393
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,803
Lucky for you, that didn't
become necessary, huh?

1394
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,091
Thank you so much, you're so kind.
I really appreciate all of this.

1395
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,368
But now do you mind telling me
exactly what is taking so long...

1396
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,080
...for your
workers to get that brain?

1397
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,680
Well, they pump the cavity
full of CO2...

1398
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,801
...just like in any other
laparoscopic surgery.

1399
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,080
Okay, yes, obviously.

1400
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,242
The CO2's gonna delay
the acidic reaction, yes.

1401
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,369
And it allows us to harvest.

1402
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,171
But our boys need oxygen
pumped into their suits.

1403
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,447
They move slow.

1404
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,650
What's going on in there, boys?

1405
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:09,291
<i>We've reach...</i>

1406
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,562
...the upper pelvic area. Uh.

1407
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,326
Moving to the 25th vertebra.

1408
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:16,441
Shit.

1409
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:21,049
Even through the suit, boss,
it smells like dead catfish in here.

1410
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,321
Boss.

1411
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,768
The secondary brain...

1412
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,447
<i>- ...is damage.</i>
- Aw.

1413
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:31,727
<i>- It's ruin.</i>
- Bitch!

1414
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,286
How could they screw that up?

1415
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,646
Wait. Wait.

1416
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,723
What was that?

1417
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,764
Did he say "wait"? Why wait?

1418
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:41,566
Do you hear that?

1419
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,970
It's like a heartbeat.

1420
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,410
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, this can't be.
Hold on a second.

1421
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:49,966
Hey! Let me have that!

1422
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,521
Shh, shh! Listen, listen!

1423
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,485
Listen to this.

1425
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,570
It's pregnant.

1432
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,402
No, no! Please.

1434
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:23,760
- I knew it.
- Uh.

1435
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,442
Gone.

1436
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,610
His lungs weren't fully formed.

1437
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,801
Umbilical cord tied around his neck.

1438
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:37,281
No way he could survive outside
the womb for more than a minute.

1439
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,043
One look, that's all I needed.
I knew he wouldn't make it.

1443
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:52,722
Ugly little bastard.

1444
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,242
Anyway, I would...

1449
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,124
How sick are you?

1450
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,809
And why didn't you tell me?

1451
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,687
Uh...

1452
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,763
What's to tell?

1453
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:58,725
You know, them Mark 1s, we scraped
them bad boys together in 14 months.

1454
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:04,927
Last thing we were thinking about
was radiation shielding.

1455
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,600
I ran nearly a dozen missions.

1456
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,361
I stayed under the medical radar
for a while...

1457
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,681
...but the last time I jockeyed
was in Tokyo.

1458
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,365
I finished the fight solo...

1459
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,165
...but for three hours...

1460
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,201
...I burned.

1461
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:23,369
They warned me if I ever stepped foot...

1462
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,688
...into a Jaeger again,
the toll would be too much.

1463
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,450
You and I are the only two
that ever ran solo combat.

1464
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,124
That's why I brought you here.

1466
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,764
- What is it?
<i>- Sir, it's happening.</i>

1467
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:49,681
<i>I just got two signatures with
unprecedented dilation, 40-meter spikes.</i>

1468
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:50,882
What category?

1469
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,645
<i>Checking the ratios, Category 4.</i>

1470
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:53,842
Where're they headed?

1471
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:55,969
<i>That's the thing, they're not heading
anywhere. They're hovering...</i>

1472
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,771
<i>...just above the Breach.
It's like they're protecting it...</i>

1473
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,846
<i>- ...or something.</i>
- All right, Gipsy, Striker on deck.

1474
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,242
Sir, Herc cannot ride. His arm...

1475
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,806
You heard me.

1476
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,321
Two signatures. Two?

1477
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:16,047
There are two Kaiju signatures in
the Breach, not three like I predicted!

1478
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,926
Hermann! I haven't exactly
had a very good day, okay?

1479
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,964
I got about 5 minutes...

1480
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,241
Should be three Kaijus.

1481
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,324
...before brain death occurs here!
I don't wanna spend it talking...

1482
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,361
- ...about your theories!
- This is all wrong!

1483
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,761
There should be three Kaijus
coming through, not two!

1484
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,520
There should be three and there's two?
I'm sorry, it hurts to be wrong.

1485
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,007
I am not wrong, but there is something
here we don't understand.

1486
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,320
Hopefully we can argue about
any mistakes you made...

1487
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,449
...in your predictive model in the future!
But in the meantime, the neural interface...

1488
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,688
...is way off the charts!
If you want to help, help with that!

1489
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,200
Newton, I am not wrong.

1490
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,689
There is only one way
to make sure...

1491
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,049
...and that is to do this...

1492
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:50,967
...together.

1493
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,526
I'll go with you.

1494
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,283
That's what the Jaeger pilots do,
share the neural load.

1495
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,005
You're serious?

1496
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,562
You would do that for me?

1497
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,690
Or you would do that with me?

1498
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,288
Well, with worldwide destruction
a certain alternative...

1499
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,085
...do I really have a choice?

1500
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,561
Then say it with me, my man:
"We're gonna own...

1501
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:13,682
...this bad boy!"

1502
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:18,329
By Jove, we are going to own
this thing for sure!

1504
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,128
Oi, Tendo. Tendo!

1505
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:28,801
You're not suited up.

1506
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,520
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Elvis.
I need to know what's going on.

1507
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,091
He said suit up, so suit up.

1508
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,603
Tendo, I can't pilot Striker
on my own, now, can I?

1509
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,241
Dad's hurt,
so who's gonna be my copilot?

1511
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,727
I don't remember it being so tight.

1512
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,531
Getting back into that Jaeger
will kill you.

1513
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,248
Not getting into one would kill us all.

1514
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,881
Listen...

1515
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,050
...you are a brave girl.

1516
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,920
I'm so lucky to have seen you grow.

1517
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,802
But if I'm going to do this...

1518
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,087
...I need you to protect me.

1519
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,365
Can you do that?

1520
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,402
Right.

1521
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,091
Everyone...

1522
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,286
...listen up!

1523
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,126
Today...

1524
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,086
...today...

1525
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,889
...at the edge of our hope...

1526
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,961
...at the end of our time...

1527
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:15,405
...we have chosen not only to believe
in ourselves, but in each other.

1528
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,168
Today there's not...

1529
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,971
...a man nor woman in here
that shall stand alone.

1530
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,765
Not today.

1531
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:29,362
Today we face the monsters
that are at our door...

1532
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,722
...and bring the fight to them!

1533
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,643
Today we are canceling the apocalypse!

1535
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,521
Hey, marshal!

1536
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,205
You know, that was a great speech...

1537
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,761
...but how exactly are you and I
supposed to match up...

1538
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:02,967
...in there?

1539
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,328
I carry nothing into the Drift.

1540
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,041
No memories, no fear.

1541
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,441
No rank.

1542
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,324
And as for you...

1543
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,125
...well, you're easy.

1544
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,930
You're an egotistical jerk...

1545
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:16,002
...with daddy issues.

1546
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,720
A simple puzzle I solved on day one.

1548
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,129
But you are your father's son...

1549
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,851
...so we'll Drift just fine.

1550
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,011
Works for me.

1551
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,401
Hey, now.

1552
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:51,725
<i>When you Drift with someone...</i>

1553
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,006
<i>...you feel like there's nothing
to talk about.</i>

1554
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:00,520
I just don't want to regret...

1555
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,881
- ...all the things that I never said out loud.
- Don't.

1557
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,444
You don't need to.

1558
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,090
I know them all.

1559
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,325
I always have.

1561
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:21,449
Hey. Hey, handsome.

1563
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,363
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

1564
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,564
You look after him for me.

1565
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:37,601
Stacker.

1566
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,883
That's my son you got there.

1567
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,005
My son.

1568
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:56,363
You know, Mako, all those years
I spent living in the past...

1569
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,571
...I never really thought
about the future.

1570
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,726
Until now.

1571
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,441
I never did have very good timing.

1573
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,566
You ready for this?

1574
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:31,964
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Initiating neural handshake in five...

1575
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,162
...four...

1576
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,208
...three...

1577
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:35,562
...two...

1578
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:36,483
...one.

1583
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,650
Are you okay?

1584
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:03,730
Yes, of course.

1585
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,529
I'm completely fine.

1588
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,323
- The Drift. You saw it?
- Yeah.

1589
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,528
- Did you?
- Listen, we have to warn them.

1590
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:21,843
The Jaegers... The Breach... The plan...

1591
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:24,364
It's not going to work.

1592
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,329
<i>Disengaging transport.</i>

1593
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,524
<i>Loccent, all ports sealed.
Ready to submerge.</i>

1594
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,171
<i>All ports sealed.</i>

1595
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,890
<i>Ready to submerge.</i>

1596
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:52,923
<i>Both neural handshakes at
100 percent.</i>

1597
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,484
Neural handshake confirmed, sir.

1598
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,451
Two actives still in circle formation
in the Guam quadrant.

1599
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,168
<i>Code names: Scunner, Raiju.
Both Category 4.</i>

1600
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,242
<i>Roger that.</i>

1601
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,808
Half a mile to the ocean cliff...

1602
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,002
...we jump!

1603
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,083
It's 3000 meters to the Breach.

1604
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:10,924
Half a mile? I can't even see...

1605
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:11,763
...a damn inch ahead!

1606
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,480
<i>How are we supposed
to deliver the bomb?</i>

1607
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,091
Visibility's zero.

1608
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,651
Switching to instruments now.

1609
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,166
Sir!

1610
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,122
<i>Gipsy, you have movement on your right.
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!</i>

1611
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,209
<i>100-feet radius...</i>

1612
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,044
<i>- ...clear.</i>
- Right flank's clear.

1613
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,207
I got nothing.

1614
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:41,250
Left now! And moving fast!
Fastest Kaiju on record!

1616
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,647
I don't see anything.
It's moving too fast!

1617
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,925
<i>Eyes on the prize, Gipsy.
600 meters from the drop.</i>

1618
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,685
<i>400 meters and closing.</i>

1619
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,801
Bogeys are stopping.

1620
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,083
<i>Striker! Bogeys are stopping.
One o'clock.</i>

1621
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:32,208
Marshal, what are you doing?

1622
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,282
They're stopping.

1623
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,329
- Why the hell are they stopping?
- I don't give a damn, sir!

1624
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:36,971
We're 300 meters from the jump!

1625
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,008
- Something's not right!
- Striker...

1626
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:39,207
<i>...the bogeys aren't following.</i>

1627
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,283
Take the leap now.

1628
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,851
Don't do it! Don't do it!

1629
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:43,881
It's not gonna work!

1630
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,360
Move, you fascist! Blowing up
the Breach, it's not gonna work!

1631
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:47,607
What do you mean?
What's not gonna work?

1632
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,886
Just because the Breach is open does not
mean you're able to get a bomb through.

1633
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:52,770
<i>The Breach genetically reads the Kaiju...</i>

1634
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,923
...like a barcode at the supermarket
and then lets them pass.

1635
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,845
You're gonna have to fool the Breach into
thinking that you have the same code!

1636
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,640
- And how are we supposed to do that?
<i>- By making it</i> think...

1637
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:01,767
...you are a Kaiju.

1638
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,604
You have to lock onto the Kaiju,
ride it into the Breach.

1639
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:04,727
The Throat will then read...

1640
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,802
...the Kaiju's genetic code...

1641
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,048
<i>- ...and let you pass.</i>
<i>- If you don't do it...</i>

1642
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,167
<i>...the bomb will deflect off the Breach...</i>

1643
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,401
<i>...like it always has...</i>

1644
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:11,800
...and the mission will fail.

1645
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:12,689
All right.

1646
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,485
Now that you've heard all that,
Striker, take the leap!

1647
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,245
Sir! I have a third signature...

1648
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,811
- ...emerging from the Breach!
- Third signature...

1649
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:19,565
...emerging from the Breach.

1650
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,887
It's a triple event.

1651
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,451
Oh, God, I was right.

1652
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:23,882
How big is it?

1653
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,242
<i>- What category?</i>
- Category 5

1654
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:29,368
<i>Striker...</i>

1655
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,244
<i>...it's a Category 5.</i>

1656
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,250
<i>The first ever.</i>

1659
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:59,841
<i>Striker, we see him.
We're right behind you...</i>

1660
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:01,007
<i>...about 100 meters.</i>

1661
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:03,925
<i>We're gonna come around
your 3 o'clock, try to flank him.</i>

1662
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,969
<i>Standard two-team formation.</i>

1663
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:07,440
<i>Just keep him busy for a few...</i>

1665
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,927
Brace for impact!

1666
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:29,561
<i>Chain sword...</i>

1667
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:30,323
<i>...deployed.</i>

1669
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,407
<i>Let's get this son of a bitch!</i>

1671
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:19,682
<i>Gipsy, coming up...</i>

1672
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,847
<i>...on your 12 o'clock!</i>

1673
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:23,003
<i>Full speed!</i>

1674
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,730
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

1676
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,720
The release is jammed!
We can't deliver...

1677
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:48,165
<i>...the payload, sir!</i>

1678
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,245
<i>We're still armed.</i>

1679
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,209
But the hull is compromised!

1680
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,801
Half our systems are offline, sir.

1681
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:55,246
We need to override the...

1684
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:44,163
Both Kaijus...

1685
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,600
...converging on Striker fast!

1687
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:50,009
<i>Hang on, Striker!</i>

1688
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:52,083
<i>- We're coming to you!
- No!</i>

1689
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,004
<i>Gipsy! Do not come to our aid!</i>

1690
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,002
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1691
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:57,481
<i>- Hang on!
- Stay as far back as you can!</i>

1692
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:00,007
We can still reach you.
We're coming for you.

1693
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,484
No, Raleigh, listen to me.

1694
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:04,404
You know exactly what you have to do!

1695
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:05,766
<i>Gipsy is nuclear!</i>

1696
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,525
<i>Take her to the Breach!</i>

1697
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,000
I hear you, sir.

1698
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,691
Heading for the Breach.

1699
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,041
<i>- Structural damage...</i>
- Now.

1700
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:13,247
<i>- ...eighty percent.</i>
- Uh.

1701
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,168
Mako.

1702
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:16,283
<i>Listen.</i>

1703
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:20,283
You can finish this.

1704
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,961
I'll always be here for you.

1705
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:27,091
You can always find me in the Drift.

1706
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,647
We're a walking...

1707
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,245
...nuclear reactor.

1708
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:37,449
We can destroy the Breach.

1711
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:52,923
<i>What can we do, sir?</i>

1712
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:55,248
We can clear a path!

1713
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,405
For the lady!

1714
01:52:58,200 --> 01:52:59,770
They're gonna detonate the payload.

1715
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,488
<i>Well, my father always said:</i>

1716
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,961
If you have the shot, you take it!

1717
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:07,330
<i>So let's do this!</i>

1718
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,005
It was a pleasure, sir.

1721
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:13,124
<i>All systems critical. Fluid loss.</i>

1722
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,689
Systems are critical!

1723
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:17,604
Fuel is leaking!

1724
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:18,840
Our right leg's crippled!

1725
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:20,570
<i>Code red.</i>

1726
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,564
- Let's finish this.
<i>- All systems critical.</i>

1727
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,245
What are they doing?

1728
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,370
Finishing the mission.

1729
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,965
Loccent. We have...

1730
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:29,361
<i>...the Kaiju carcass.</i>

1731
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,806
<i>We're heading for the Breach.</i>

1732
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:35,690
<i>You guys better be right.</i>

1733
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:37,888
<i>Because one way or another...</i>

1734
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,481
<i>...we're getting this thing done.</i>

1736
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,890
On my count, rear jets!

1737
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:56,121
Three...

1738
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,481
...two...

1739
01:54:57,720 --> 01:54:58,482
...one.

1740
01:54:58,720 --> 01:54:59,243
Now!

1742
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:09,760
Hold on.

1744
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:25,127
Mako's oxygen is down. Half capacity!

1745
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:28,169
- Can you reroute it?
- I'm trying, sir.

1746
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:29,327
Hold on, Mako.

1747
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:31,491
<i>- Heat shaft purge.</i>
- I'm gonna burn...

1748
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:32,926
<i>...this son of a bitch.</i>

1750
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:52,208
They're in.

1751
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:54,363
- They're in!
- It worked.

1752
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:10,006
<i>Oxygen main...</i>

<i>Five percent.</i>

1758

He's giving her his oxygen.

1760
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:28,807
It's okay now, Mako.

1761
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,525
We did it.

1762
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:34,129
I can finish this alone.

1763
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,724
All I have to do is fall.

1764
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,485
Anyone can fall.

1765
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:40,723
Raleigh...

1766
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:41,927
<i>...your oxygen levels...</i>

1767
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:44,640
<i>...are critical now.
You don't have much time.</i>

1768
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:48,647
<i>Start the core meltdown and
get out of there. Do you hear me?</i>

1769
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,086
<i>Get out of there now!</i>

1770
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:01,243
One pod is ejected. No detonation, sir.

1771

<i>Loccent, if you can still hear me...</i>

1772
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,047

01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:11,523
What's going on?

1778
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,649
Trigger's offline!
He has to do it by hand.

1779
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,721
He's out of time.
He has to self-destruct now.

1780
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:21,290
<i>Manual activation required.</i>

1781
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,164
No!

1783
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:54,202
Manual override initiated.

1784
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,966
Core meltdown in T-minus 60.

1785
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:00,488
<i>Reactor meltdown in 55 seconds.</i>

1786
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,124
<i>Fifty seconds.</i>

1788
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,325
<i>E-vac pod engaged.</i>

1789
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:47,846
<i>Five...</i>

1790
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,242
<i>...four, three...</i>

1791
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:53,563
<i>...two, one.</i>

1792
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,131
<i>Reactor meltdown.</i>

1793
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,965
Direct hit! The Breach has collapsed!

1795
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:11,201
To the choppers! To the choppers now!

1796
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:29,969
Visuals on first pod.

1797
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:33,283
<i>Tracking solid. Vital signs are good.</i>

1798
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:40,244
Okay, where's the second pod?

1799
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,566
I'm tracking it,
but I'm getting no vital signs.

1800
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:12,849
<i>I can't find his pulse.</i>

1801
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,651
<i>I don't think he's breathing.</i>

1802
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:17,326
Can you read his pulse?
Does he have a pulse?

1803
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:18,681
<i>Raleigh?</i>

1804
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,651
<i>Mako, listen to me.</i>

1805
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,481
<i>It could be the sensors
are not working.</i>

1806
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:24,726
<i>We can't be sure.</i>

1807
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:25,927
No.

1808
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,767
No. Don't go.

1809
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:30,971
- Please.
- Mako.

1810
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:32,921
Don't go.

1811
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:34,406
Mako.

1812
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,881
No.

1813
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,562
Don't go. Please.

1814
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,360
You're squeezing me too tight.

1816
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,843
I couldn't breathe.

1819
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:11,528
This is Marshal Hercules Hansen.

1820
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,129
<i>The Breach is sealed.</i>

1821
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,566
Stop the clock!

1824
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:45,601
<i>Mako, Raleigh.</i>

1825
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,161
<i>We have your position.
The choppers are on their way.</i>

1826
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:49,566
<i>Just hang on.</i>

1828
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:54,451
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1829
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:57,005
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1830
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:00,647
<i>Uh, guys?</i>

1834
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:03,203
Where is my goddamn shoe?
