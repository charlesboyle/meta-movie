00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Meet The Robinsons

1
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,663
Then I didn't choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples,

2
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:27,416
so I choosed another scary one

3
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:32,629
because, for all those years
that I went for Halloween,

4
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:34,464
I wasn't scary at all.

5
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:47,602
I love baseball.
It's my destiny to play that game.

6
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:49,687
I don't really care about winning.

7
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:54,275
Well, like, now I do
'cause, like, we've lost every game.

8
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,318
I've gotten tired of it.

9
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,947
I'm working, like, so hard.
All the balls are getting thrown to me.

10
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:02,491
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

11
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,703
All of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and...

12
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:09,455
Come on!
Let's play some baseball, okay?

13
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,916
Not the lazy game.

14
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,633
They're here.

15
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:27,598
Lewis?

16
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,851
Lewis?

17
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,446
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

18
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:44,156
They are gonna love this!

19
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:47,159
Nothing says "adopt me"
like a weird invention.

20
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:48,410
Lewis!

21
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:50,662
- Lewis, the Harringtons are here!
- Way ahead of you, Mildred.

22
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:52,580
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:55,791
Remember, sit up straight.
Look them in the eye.

24
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:58,085
Smile. Let's fix your...

25
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,129
Mildred.

26
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:02,590
All right, all right, all right, all right.

27
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,592
Go show them how special you are.

28
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,636
Oh, I hope this is it.

29
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,471
I hope he gets adopted.

30
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,222
You and me both, chief.

31
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,685
I mean, there's so many things
in the world that can be improved.

32
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,146
Just think of it.
Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

33
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:19,814
The possibilities are endless.

34
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,025
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

35
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,986
All it takes is some imagination
and a little science,

36
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:27,489
and we can make the world
a better place.

37
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:30,909
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

38
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:33,036
So, what's your favourite sport?

39
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:35,663
- Well, does inventing count as a sport?
- Actually...

40
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:37,874
'Cause I think I hit a home run
with this one!

41
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,418
- What is that?
- First, a question.

42
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:42,837
What's the number one problem
that you face

43
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:44,672
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

44
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:47,090
- Lewis, I don't think we...
- Portion control.

45
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:49,134
Too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth,

46
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,343
takes forever to chew.

47
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:54,223
Too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky.

48
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:56,976
Well, I propose
that the perfect P.B. and J.

49
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,435
is within mankind's grasp,

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,854
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

51
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,190
For this demonstration,
I'll use regular bread.

52
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,399
Honey, it's okay.

53
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:06,359
As you can see, toasting is an option.

54
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:08,653
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

55
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:11,656
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

56
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:13,532
It's jammed!

57
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,162
Lewis, please, don't!

58
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,254
What's happening?

59
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:30,215
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

60
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,050
I'm sorry!

61
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:33,719
Here let me help you get that off!

62
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:35,595
Stand back!

63
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,392
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Breathe. Breathe.

64
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,479
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

65
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,230
It was really nice to meet you.

66
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:48,149
We're gonna need some time
to think about it.

67
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:50,443
Hi, folks. Everything all...

68
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:51,653
What happened?

69
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:54,238
Miss Duffy,
that boy is definitely not right for us.

70
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:55,781
Now, if you'll excuse me.

71
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:59,869
I'm so sorry about this.
If you would just...

72
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:11,213
- I made some lunch.
- Not hungry.

73
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:14,716
Poor Mr Harrington.

74
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:18,387
- I killed him?
- No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

75
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,472
I called. He's perfectly fine.

76
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,933
I was just gonna say that it's...

77
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:25,727
It's too bad
he didn't get to try a sandwich

78
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,396
from that wonderful invention of yours.

79
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,606
- Yeah, real wonderful.
- It's not you.

80
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,234
We just haven't found
the right couple yet.

81
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,278
One hundred twenty-four.

82
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,863
What?

83
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:40,491
That's how many adoption interviews
I've had, 124.

84
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:41,701
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

85
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:44,078
You're exaggerating just to make your

86
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:46,830
point.

87
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,957
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

88
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:52,586
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted.

89
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:56,256
I have no future. No one wants me.

90
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:57,423
That's not true, Lewis!

91
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,218
My own mother didn't even want me.

92
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:01,720
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

93
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,221
Then why'd she give me up?

94
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:05,015
She may not have been able
to take care of you.

95
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,641
Did you ever think of that?

96
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,562
I am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you.

97
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:13,689
I never thought of it that way.

98
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:17,109
Maybe she wanted to keep you,
but she had no choice.

99
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:19,987
You're right.

100
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,783
My real mom is the only person
who's ever wanted me.

101
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,660
Wait. I said "maybe."

102
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:28,579
And if she wanted me then,
she'll want me now.

103
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:30,164
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:33,667
I have to find her, Mildred,
and when I do, she'll take me back,

105
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,168
and we'll be a family again!

106
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:39,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lewis, you can't do that.

107
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:41,966
No one knows anything about her.
No one even saw her.

108
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:45,845
Wrong. I saw her

109
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,054
once.

110
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,809
She's in here. I just have to remember.

111
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:55,897
That's it!

112
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,734

136
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,455
So tired.

137
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,835
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon.
He'll be so excited you're coming.

138
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,253
Bye-bye, now.

139
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,964
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

140
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,133
- Good luck at the big game today.
- Easy win.

141
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,302
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

142
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,513
I just hope I can stay awake.

143
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,515
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

144
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,393
He was up all night
working on his stupid project,

145
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,228
but that's what happens

146
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,607
when you get a science geek
for a roommate.

147
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:16,906
Ah, that's good joe.

148
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:21,286
All right, Einstein,
you owe Michael big time.

149
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:24,414
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than I expected,

150
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,625
but it's finished, Mildred.
I recalibrated the headset.

151
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:30,419
Now the neural circuits will connect.

152
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:32,421
I've cracked the hippocampus!

153
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:34,423
Really? Okay. What?

154
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:36,341
Now to test it out.

155
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,179
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

156
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:42,388
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

157
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:44,182
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

158
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:45,683
I know you have a lot
on your plate today,

159
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:48,103
but I've scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon.

160
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:50,105
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks"?

161
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,107
Sweetheart, this is
about being adopted,

162
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:55,235
and you will be back here
clean, happy and on time.

163
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,155
I'm done with interviews, Mildred.
I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

164
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,574
Listen, I know where your head is,
but I'm telling you,

165
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:05,411
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future.

166
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:07,454
I am, and this is it.

167
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,789
This is my future.

168
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:11,374
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:13,878
Lewis? Honey?

170
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:20,968
Dr Krunklehorn,
I know you're very busy there

171
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:22,177
at Inventco Labs,

172
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:24,262
and we're just so excited
to have you as a judge.

173
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:26,306
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein.
Hey, you never know.

174
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:28,474
One of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit

175
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,643
or microprocessor or integrated circuit.

176
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:32,186
Oh, wait! I said that already.

177
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:34,105
Well, I just don't get out
of that lab very much.

178
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,232
Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.

179
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,318
I haven't slept in eight days!

180
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:41,154
Well, then can I get you a cot
or something?

181
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,282
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch.
It's my invention.

182
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:47,034
Each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

183
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,578
You can stay awake for days
with no side effects.

184
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:51,788
Sorry. Who's this?

185
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:54,541
This is one of our students,
Stanley Pukowski.

186
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,293
Oh, so cute!

187
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:58,795
I just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks!

188
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:03,217
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

189
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:05,886
It's actually a toga, sir.

190
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:09,472
Coach, nice to see you, sort of.
What are you doing here?

191
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:12,058
Judging a science fair.
What's it look like I'm doing?

192
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:15,186
And what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair?

193
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,562
It's my gym.

194
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,148
Stanley. Volcano.

195
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:24,778
Behold the awesome power
of Mount Vesuvius!

196
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:30,951
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

197
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:32,161
Dr Krunklehorn?

198
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,288
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

199
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:38,375
I don't know what she just said,
but this project is unacceptable!

200
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,210
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

201
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:41,836
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

202
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,671
- Coach!
- I'm watching you.

203
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:56,184
Okay, next up is Lizzy
and her fire ant farm.

204
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,477
That's right.

205
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,061
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

206
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:01,022
You know that they have a tendency
to bite people.

207
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,399
Only my enemies.

208
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,777
Just keep moving, shall we?
Top notch, Lizzy!

209
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:09,654
Let's not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way.

210
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:25,295
This area's not secure. Get in.

211
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:29,048
Have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat?

212
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,384
- What?
- Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

213
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,011
- Okay, goodbye.
- All right,

214
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:36,180
didn't want to pull rank on you,
but you forced my hand.

215
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:38,474
Special Agent Wilbur Robinson
of the T.C.T.F.

216
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:40,642
- The what?
- Time Continuum Task Force.

217
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:41,893
- I'm here to protect you.
- Well...

218
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:44,438
Now, tall man, bowler hat,
approached you?

219
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:45,648
No, why?

220
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:48,150
I could lose my badge for this.

221
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:49,985
He's a suspect in a robbery.

222
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,195
What did he steal?

223
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,613
- A time machine.
- A what?

224
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:55,866
I've tracked him to this time,
and my informants say he's after you.

225
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,659
Me? Why me?

226
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:59,744
The boys back at HQ
haven't figured out a motive yet.

227
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:01,829
And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters."

228
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,289
I know what HQ means.

229
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:04,957
Good. You're a smart kid.

230
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:07,126
That might keep you alive, for now.

231
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:08,794
Just worry
about your little science gizmo

232
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,047
and leave the "perp" to me.

233
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:13,925
- And by "perp," I mean...
- I know what it means!

234
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,052
Okay, Mr Smarty-pants.

235
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,765
Bowler Hat Guy!

236
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:26,728
My frogs!

237
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:28,104
You're not gonna get away with it,

238
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:31,900
kid with science project.

239
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:34,653
Dude, you almost busted
my solar system!

240
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:38,448
My frogs! They're getting away!

241
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,980
Got you! That's the last of them.

242
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:14,441
Annoying little girl,
I don't have time for this.

243
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:15,650
I'm on a very important...

244
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:18,986
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

245
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:22,156
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain!
Love the pain!

246
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:23,407
Coach...

247
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:24,658
Next up is Lewis.

248
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,953
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

249
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,455
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

250
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:34,168
It's okay. It's gonna work this time.
I won't let you down, I promise.

251
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:37,212
All right, Lewis, I trust you.
Knock 'em dead.

252
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:40,674
That was a figure of speech.
Please don't kill anyone.

253
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:47,013
Okay, stand back, everybody.

254
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:49,807
This next project
will knock your socks off.

255
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:52,644
Seriously, you might wanna stand back
a little.

256
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,897
Have you ever forgotten something,

257
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,526
and no matter how hard you tried,
you couldn't remember it?

258
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:03,571
Well, what happens
to these forgotten memories?

259
00:16:03,738 --> 00:16:07,158
I propose
they're stored somewhere in your brain,

260
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:09,868
and I built a machine
that can retrieve them.

261
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:12,913
I call it the Memory Scanner.

262
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:15,165
It's shiny!

263
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,960
So, Lewis,
how does the Memory Scanner work?

264
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:21,463
First, you input the desired period
of time on this keypad.

265
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:25,926
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex,
where memories are stored.

266
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,511
The retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor.

267
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:30,555
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

268
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,267
Now, I'm going back 12 years,
three months and 11 days.

269
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,269
Why that particular day?

270
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:38,354
You didn't think
I was paying attention, did you?

271
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,150
Well, that was the day...

272
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:46,279
Let's just say, that was
a very important day in my life.

273
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:47,947
Fair enough. Play ball.

274
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:51,617
It'll just take a second
to get the turbines going.

275
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:11,803
Lewis, wait!

276
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,607
She's gonna blow!

277
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,734
Watch out!

278
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:33,824
Feel the pain! Love the...

279
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:35,993
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

280
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:43,166
Make it stop!

281
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,626
Coach, suck it up, okay?

282
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:48,171
Let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

283
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,089
- Let's calm down!
- Mr Willerstein?

284
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:51,799
- I didn't mean to...
- Not now, Lewis!

285
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:54,552
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

286
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,178
Not now.

287
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:00,350
Okay, and we are walking
in a calm, orderly fashion

288
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:01,559
toward the exits.

289
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:07,606
Wait, Lewis!

290
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,085
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

291
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:52,999
Hey, what are you doing up here?

292
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:10,724
Would you quit that, please?
I know you're not a pigeon.

293
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,268
You're blowing my cover.

294
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:14,978
We're the only ones up here.

295
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:17,063
That's just what they want you to think.

296
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:18,773
Now, enough moping.

297
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:21,818
Take this back to the science fair
and fix that Memory Scanner.

298
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:23,819
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

299
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:24,987
Maybe you've forgotten.

300
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:27,656
I'm a time cop from the future,
should be taken very seriously.

301
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:29,909
That's no badge.

302
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:33,329
This is a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.

303
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:35,498
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

304
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,583
but I really am from the future,

305
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,668
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

306
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,003
Here we go again.

307
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:43,046
He stole a time machine,
came to the science fair

308
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,256
and ruined your project.

309
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:46,675
My project didn't work
because I'm no good.

310
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,302
There is no Bowler Hat Guy,
there is no time machine,

311
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:51,012
and you're not from the future!

312
00:20:51,137 --> 00:20:52,180
You're crazy!

313
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:54,098
I am not crazy.

314
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,560
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel?
Prove it.

315
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:00,021
Yeah, that's what I thought.

316
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:02,982
I'm just gonna go lock myself
in my room

317
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:05,026
and hide under the covers
for a couple years.

318
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,487
If I prove to you I'm from the future,
will you go back to the science fair?

319
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:10,823
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

320
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,866
Hey, let go of me!

321
00:21:12,992 --> 00:21:15,035
- What are you doing? Let go of me!
- Okay.

322
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:37,432
What is this? Where are we going?

323
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:39,892
To the future!

324
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,539
The future has arrived

325
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:06,292
The future has arrived today

326
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,753
The future has arrived

327
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:12,633
The future has arrived today

328
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:55,047
Is this proof enough for you?

329
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:56,757
Is it ever!

330
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:59,885
I never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime,

331
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,430
and here it is, right in front of me!

332
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,307
The truth will set you free, brother.

333
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:07,310
This is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

334
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,312
This means
I could really change my life.

335
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:11,814
That's right. You can.

336
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:14,274
Next stop, science fair,
to fix your Memory Scanner.

337
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,152
Hey, I'm not gonna fix
that stupid Memory Scanner.

338
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:20,822
- What?
- Wilbur, this is a time machine!

339
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:22,657
Why should I fix my dumb invention

340
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:26,202
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship?

341
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:32,000
I could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up.

342
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,961
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.

343
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:37,422
This? You want to know
what I think about this?

344
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:38,673
What are you doing?

345
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:39,966
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

346
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,926
but you don't know
what I've lived through.

347
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:43,844
- Lewis, no!
- Let go!

348
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,846
- You let go!
- You're not the boss of me!

349
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:49,141
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

350
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:50,642
That makes me older.

351
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,851
Well, I was born in the past,

352
00:23:51,978 --> 00:23:54,021
which makes me older
and the boss of you!

353
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:14,039
I am so dead.

354
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,336
I'm not allowed to look at this thing,
let alone drive it!

355
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:19,837
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

356
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:22,715
and I can tell you this.
It will not be done with mercy.

357
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,508
Isn't there like
a time machine repair shop

358
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:25,676
- or something?
- No!

359
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:27,886
There's only two time machines
in existence,

360
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:29,805
and the Bowler Hat Guy
has the other one!

361
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,391
Well, somebody's gonna have
to fix this.

362
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:35,560
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

363
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:38,104
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

364
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,773
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

365
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:44,069
All right, under one condition.

366
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:47,155
I fix it,
you take me back to see my mom.

367
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,200
What? You didn't even follow through
on our last deal.

368
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:51,409
How can I trust you?

369
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:54,245
Well, you told me you were a time cop
from the future.

370
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,080
How can I trust you?

371
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:57,915
Touché.

372
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:01,585
So do we have a deal?

373
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,742
Good day, madam.

374
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:38,329
- I'm here to change the future.
- Yes, sir?

375
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:42,291
I must speak with the man
in charge immediately.

376
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,669
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with destiny.

377
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,462
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

378
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,798
and I'll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite.

379
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,967
- What?
- Now, what time is your appointment?

380
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,970
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

381
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,764
What time is your appointment?

382
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,228
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

383
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,979
You're the 2:00?

384
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:07,148
Yes. Yes, I am.

385
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:09,025
You're Mary Johnson?

386
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,485
Yes.

387
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,238
Mary is short for...

388
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,323
Marian?

389
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:19,326
- Can that be a boy name?
- Yes.

390
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:21,953
- Then yes.
- Have a seat.

391
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:23,455
Oh, goody!

392
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:38,178
"Pass off invention as my own." Check.
Oh, I love checklists.

393
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:39,929
The board is ready to see you now.

394
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:43,391
Wait. What am I going to say?

395
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:46,393
I'm never gonna remember that.

396
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:49,898
Would you... Why don't you go?
You do it so much better than me.

397
00:26:51,065 --> 00:26:52,233
That's true.

398
00:26:52,358 --> 00:26:55,027
A hat without a head
couldn't really pass off an invention

399
00:26:55,152 --> 00:26:56,237
as its own.

400
00:26:57,613 --> 00:27:01,617
Fantastic! Great idea!
I'm so glad I have you!

401
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:11,376
"Prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!

402
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,380
Prepare to be amazed!

403
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:20,552
"This is my invention."

404
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:24,722
"I doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device."

405
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:25,890
Very well,

406
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:28,225
Miss Johnson?

407
00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:30,269
It's Ms.

408
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:32,980
You have two minutes. Please begin.

409
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:39,987
- It's shiny!
- What is that thing?

410
00:27:40,112 --> 00:27:44,658
Well, I like to call it my...

411
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,660
To call it my...

412
00:27:46,785 --> 00:27:50,956
- What are you looking at?
- No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

413
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:52,874
Well, then let me close the blinds.

414
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,589
Now, the name?

415
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:02,675
Well, what...

416
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,468
We can quibble about names
at a later date.

417
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:07,347
The point is,
what I have here is special, unique.

418
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:10,808
Yes. Yes, you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it,

419
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:14,812
and the best part is,
it's got really comfy headphones.

420
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:22,194
I wonder, could you lean forward
just a little bit, please?

421
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,112
Yes, thank you.

422
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:26,865
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

423
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:29,409
What do you hope
to accomplish with this?

424
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:31,161
Oh, nothing of consequence.

425
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:36,041
I simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy!

426
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:39,669
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

427
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:41,504
You mean,
you haven't thought this through?

428
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:43,798
Thirty seconds.

429
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:50,179
Allow me to show you how it works.

430
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,347
First, we turn it on.

431
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:57,311
That's not it.

432
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:00,272
Ten seconds.

433
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:21,376
So where do I sign?

434
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,682
Doris, it's all over.

435
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:36,768
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

436
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:40,605
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing.

437
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:42,565
You're right.

438
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,443
Success is still ours for the taking.

439
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:50,782
We must find that boy.

440
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,288
We'll sneak this thing into the garage.
You'll have all the tools you need.

441
00:29:58,414 --> 00:29:59,456
What about your parents?

442
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:00,707
Mom never goes in there,

443
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,918
and Dad's on a business trip
until tomorrow morning.

444
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:04,085
You've got till then to fix it.

445
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:07,380
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need
some blueprints or something for this.

446
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,841
No worries. I got someone
who could help us with that.

447
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:15,805
Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?

448
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:17,974
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

449
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:21,269
None may enter
unless they speak the royal password.

450
00:30:21,394 --> 00:30:23,813
Carl, what are you talking about?
We don't have a password.

451
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:27,233
Yes, we do.
I made one up while you were gone.

452
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,485
Well, then
how am I supposed to know what it is?

453
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,944
You...

454
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:33,739
Good point.

455
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:37,827
Welcome back, little buddy.

456
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:40,496
So what's up
with the stolen time machine?

457
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:43,165
Did you find it? Apparently not,

458
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,917
and you managed
to bust this one as well.

459
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:47,586
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

460
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:50,255
And how do you suppose
that's gonna...

461
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,423
- Who's that?
- Wow, a real robot!

462
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:53,675
Hi, I'm Lewis.

463
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:02,182
Well, that was unexpected.

464
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:04,352
As was that.

465
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:06,979
If my family finds out
I brought you from the past,

466
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:09,190
they'll bury me alive
and dance on my grave.

467
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:12,359
I'm not exaggerating.
Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

468
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:14,695
The point is,
your hair's a dead giveaway.

469
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,530
Why would my hair be
a dead giveaway?

470
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,365
That is an excellent question.

471
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,950
Wait! Where are you going?

472
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:21,534
Another excellent question.

473
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:24,996
But I don't just want to sit here.

474
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,539
Stay.

475
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:27,874
But...

476
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:44,807
Wow!

477
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:52,230
Hey, ring my doorbell.

478
00:31:52,564 --> 00:31:53,733
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

479
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:55,943
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it.
Look at this door bell. Ring it.

480
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:00,072
- Yes!
- That was accidental.

481
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:01,656
That's an accidental ring.
It doesn't count.

482
00:32:01,782 --> 00:32:02,908
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

483
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:04,492
- Flat head.
- Short roots.

484
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:05,660
Evergreen.

485
00:32:11,624 --> 00:32:13,167
What do you mean,
don't go to the family?

486
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:17,004
How can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis?

487
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:20,800
By leaving the garage door unlocked,
you let the time machine get stolen,

488
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:23,803
and now the entire time stream
could be altered!

489
00:32:23,928 --> 00:32:25,596
That and someone took my bike.

490
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:28,432
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

491
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:31,310
First, we keep Lewis in the garage,
away from everybody.

492
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:33,353
I show up and give him
the pep talk of the century.

493
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:34,938
Then he fixes the time machine.

494
00:32:35,063 --> 00:32:36,815
Why is it an acorn?

495
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,650
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

496
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:40,777
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

497
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:42,487
His confidence in inventing is restored.

498
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:45,073
He goes back to the science fair,
fixes his Memory Scanner,

499
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:47,117
thus restoring
the space-time continuum.

500
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:48,994
What about taking him back
to see his mom?

501
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,954
I just told him that to buy some time.

502
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,415
Oh, yeah, can't see that one
blowing up in your face.

503
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,292
Trust me. I got it under control.

504
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,502
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

505
00:33:00,754 --> 00:33:02,506
But on the slight chance that I do...

506
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:05,801
"On the slight chance," yeah.
You know what? I'll run the numbers.

507
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:10,806
What is it?

508
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:12,641
Well, it's not...

509
00:33:12,766 --> 00:33:17,854
It doesn't pertain to anything in...
You know, there's not necessarily...

510
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:22,817
There's a 99.999999% chance
that you won't exist.

511
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:26,320
- What?
- And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

512
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:27,822
I won't exist?

513
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:29,448
And where does that leave me?

514
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:31,867
Alone, rusting in a corner.

515
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:36,831
What am I worried about?
Now, blueprints?

516
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:43,921
If this thing ever blows over,
I really gotta get away from you

517
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:45,339
and get some quiet time.

518
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:49,885
What's...

519
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:52,262
Well, hey, there, little fella!

520
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:56,099
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and my clothes are not on backwards.

521
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,767
My head is!

522
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:02,064
Oh, I used to tell that one
to my science students.

523
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:04,691
They didn't laugh, either.

524
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:06,860
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

525
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:09,028
- Well, Lewis, but...
- Lewis, huh?

526
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:12,240
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen
any teeth around here, have you?

527
00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:13,991
- Teeth?
- Yeah, my teeth.

528
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:17,703
Been digging holes all day.
Can't find them anywhere.

529
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:19,955
All right, look, old man,
I need to get back to the garage.

530
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,164
Wilbur left me down there,

531
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:22,582
and I wasn't supposed to leave,
and these monsters...

532
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:23,750
- Monsters?
... attacked me on the porch and...

533
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,753
There's no monsters on the porch,
you ninny.

534
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:27,421
- Listen to me!
- Of course, I also didn't think

535
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:29,173
there was a woodchuck
living on my arm,

536
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:30,757
and lookie there!

537
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:31,925
Hope he ain't got rabies.

538
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,219
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

539
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:38,223
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy.
I know a shortcut.

540
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:40,308
Welcome to the garage.

541
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:42,477
Well, I'm completely lost.

542
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:43,686
Hiya, Grandpa.

543
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:44,895
Hey, Aunt Billie.

544
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:46,564
Lewis and me
are looking for the garage.

545
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:48,941
- We have a garage?
- Apparently so.

546
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:51,402
Lewis, will you give me a hand
and time my race?

547
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:55,406
Okay, Gaston,
my toy train's ready for you.

548
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,742
That's a toy train?

549
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:04,831
On your mark, get set, go?

550
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:10,879
- 3.7 seconds.
- I win!

551
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:14,507
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

552
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,927
Lewis?

553
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:20,055
- And five and six and seven and eight.
- That's Uncle Joe. He works out.

554
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,222
Keep those tummies tucked.

555
00:35:22,974 --> 00:35:24,434
This isn't the garage.

556
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,601
I know.

557
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:28,104
I don't think
the garage is in here, either.

558
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:30,898
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

559
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:33,567
- That's Uncle Art.
- A real superhero?

560
00:35:33,692 --> 00:35:35,611
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

561
00:35:35,736 --> 00:35:38,029
needs a large
cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?

562
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:41,534
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

563
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:44,328
- He's a...
- Pizza delivery guy.

564
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:45,788
Lewis?

565
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,915
- What are we doing up here?
- Looking for the garage.

566
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,750
Oh, yeah!

567
00:35:57,673 --> 00:36:01,427
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat,
or I'm telling Ma!

568
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:03,846
- Lighten up, sis!
- Lasz, I mean it!

569
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:07,308
Children, please!
Your mother is trying to take a nap.

570
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,394
What is all the yelling out here?

571
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,686
- He started it!
- She started it!

572
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:12,146
I don't want to hear any more!

573
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,733
- Now, sweetie...
- Don't you "sweetie" me!

574
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,152
I'm going for a drive!

575
00:36:21,822 --> 00:36:24,366
That's strange.
She usually takes the Harley.

576
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:26,284
Lewis!

577
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:29,078
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.

578
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,791
Bake them cookies, Lucille!

579
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,251
Why is your dog wearing glasses?

580
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:37,462
Oh, 'cause his insurance
won't pay for contacts.

581
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:40,298
That's Uncle Spike,
and there's Uncle Dimitri.

582
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:43,843
- Oh, look, there's...
- That's the monster!

583
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,846
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.

584
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:49,431
Nice to meet you.

585
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:51,850
Hey, Lefty,
any idea how to get to the garage?

586
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:55,353
Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.

587
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:57,565
- Who?
- Wilbur's mom, Franny.

588
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,358
I think you'll like her.

589
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,946
Hey, guys!

590
00:37:05,238 --> 00:37:09,492
<i># You ask me over
And over and over #</i>

591
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:12,704
<i># Have you seen
My peacock-feathered hat? #</i>

592
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:13,996
Frogs?

593
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:15,623
Taught them everything they know.

594
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:18,709
- Franny, this is Lewis.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

595
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:22,379
Perfect timing.
We need someone on maracas.

596
00:37:22,922 --> 00:37:26,843
<i># Where is your heart at?
Nobody knows that #</i>

597
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:29,053
<i># Even though you've him, her, me #</i>

598
00:37:29,178 --> 00:37:31,764
<i># And an army searching #</i>

599
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:37,477
<i># I've got a feeling
You will be reeling #</i>

600
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:41,189
<i># When you are bad
And the circus comes to town #</i>

601
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:43,024
Grandpa, I think I found your teeth.

602
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:44,942
<i># And you see me leaving
Dressed up as a magician #</i>

603
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:46,194
<i># Or something like that #</i>

604
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:50,574
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!

605
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:52,117
Ring-a-ding-ding.

606
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,123
All right!

607
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:02,376
Right. Well, glad I could help
with the teeth,

608
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:04,920
but, wow, look at the time.

609
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:09,424
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!

610
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:11,676
I did, but I went up the tube,
and I ran into your family, and I...

611
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:14,305
You met my family?

612
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:18,308
Pop quiz.

613
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:19,893
Who have you met,
and what have you learnt?

614
00:38:20,018 --> 00:38:22,020
Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.

615
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:24,522
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...

616
00:38:24,648 --> 00:38:25,857
Cranky? Yes.

617
00:38:25,982 --> 00:38:27,400
Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.

618
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:29,485
Joe is married to Billie.
Lefty is the butler.

619
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,736
Spike and Dimitri are twins,

620
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:32,655
and I don't know who they're related to.

621
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,864
Neither do we. Go on.

622
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:37,409
Lucille is married to Bud,
and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.

623
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:40,038
What does Cornelius look like?

624
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:41,456
Tom Selleck.

625
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,669
Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny,
and her brothers are Gaston and Art.

626
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,003
You're forgetting something.

627
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,338
Forgetting? Oh, right.

628
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:51,924
Wilbur is the son
of Franny and Cornelius.

629
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:53,675
And nobody realised
you were from the past?

630
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,843
Nope.

631
00:38:55,343 --> 00:38:56,469
Thank you. Thank you.

632
00:38:56,594 --> 00:39:00,014
Hold your applause.
Thank you very much.

633
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:15,238
Doris, get it off! Get it off!

634
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:23,787
I've got you now.

635
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,330
Lewis!

636
00:39:27,624 --> 00:39:31,045
No, Lewis is my stupid roommate.

637
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,548
My name's Mike Yagoobian.
People call me Goob,

638
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:38,218
but today, everyone that beat me up
called me "puke face"

639
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,054
and "butterfingers"
and "booger breath."

640
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:44,098
Nice to see that they're branching out.

641
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:46,767
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

642
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:48,978
Well, I was just looking for Lewis.

643
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:52,064
Try the roof.
He's always up there being dumb.

644
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,318
Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

645
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:58,738
Mr Steak, you're my only friend.

646
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,783
Game didn't go so well, huh?

647
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:07,412
No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning,
and I missed the winning catch.

648
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:09,331
Then I got beat up.

649
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:13,668
Afterwards, Coach took me aside
and told me to let it go.

650
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:15,837
I don't know. He's probably right.

651
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:17,088
No!

652
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:20,217
Everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on, but don't.

653
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:24,387
Instead, let it fester
and boil inside of you.

654
00:40:24,512 --> 00:40:26,347
Take these feelings
and lock them away.

655
00:40:26,473 --> 00:40:28,099
Let them fuel your actions.

656
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,268
Let hate be your ally,

657
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:34,105
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things.

658
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:40,444
Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.

659
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:44,948
What?

660
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,290
Where is that boy?

661
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:58,670
Good idea!
Separate and look for clues.

662
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,968
Look, my dear! Look what I found!
It's a stick.

663
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,345
Now, what did you find?

664
00:41:10,514 --> 00:41:12,183
Yes. Yes, I see.

665
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:15,436
Time travel residue next to DNA
from Wilbur Robinson.

666
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:18,898
That plus my stick must mean...

667
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:32,160
To the future! Shotgun!

668
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:41,503
I don't even know what I'm doing.

669
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:42,670
Keep moving forward.

670
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:44,839
I mean,
this stuff is way too advanced for me.

671
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:46,048
Keep moving forward.

672
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:48,259
And what if I can't fix this?
What are we gonna do?

673
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:49,510
Keep moving forward.

674
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,136
Why do you keep saying that?

675
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:53,222
And don't just say,
"Keep moving forward."

676
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,681
It's my dad's motto.

677
00:41:54,807 --> 00:41:56,767
Why would his motto be
"keep moving forward"?

678
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:58,226
It's what he does.

679
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:00,020
What's that supposed to mean?

680
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:02,022
That is an excellent question.

681
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:03,524
Robinson Industries,

682
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,360
the world's leading
scientific-research-and-design factory.

683
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:09,279
My dad runs the company.
They mass produce his inventions.

684
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:13,575
His motto, "Keep moving forward."
It's what he does.

685
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,410
- What has he invented?
- Everything.

686
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:17,412
Carl, the time machine,
the travel tubes.

687
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:20,289
Your dad invented the time machine?

688
00:42:20,414 --> 00:42:21,874
Yep. Five years ago,

689
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:24,168
Dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat.

690
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,213
He wants to build a time machine,
so he starts working.

691
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:29,757
We're talking plans.
We're talking scale models.

692
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:31,551
We're talking prototypes.

693
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:33,052
That's a prototype?

694
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:36,388
- The very first, or what's left of it.
- Yikes.

695
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:38,724
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.

696
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:40,726
Prototypes two and three,
not much better.

697
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,102
Number six, 58,

698
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,645
212, 485,

699
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,896
952,

700
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,273
and they all end the same way.

701
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,237
But he doesn't give up.

702
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,991
Dude, I can't take you seriously
in that hat.

703
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:59,369
He keeps working and working
until finally he gets it,

704
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,079
the first working time machine.

705
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:04,540
Then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again,

706
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,750
the second working time machine.

707
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,084
Kind of small.

708
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,336
I'm assuming that's a joke.
I'm ignoring you for time reasons.

709
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,921
This, my friend, is merely a model

710
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,965
because, unfortunately,
time machine number two

711
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,678
is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.

712
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,937
- Pretty amazing story, huh?
- Yeah.

713
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,522
Now, are you ready to start working?

714
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:46,080
I think that's it. I did it!

715
00:43:46,205 --> 00:43:47,623
I knew you could.

716
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:53,295
Nice work, my friend.

717
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:07,350
Well, you know what they say!
"Keep moving..."

718
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:09,019
Don't say it!

719
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:16,901
Boys! Dinner time!

720
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:18,194
Not now, Mom!

721
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,947
If you aren't up here in five minutes,
I'm gonna come down and get you!

722
00:44:23,866 --> 00:44:25,909
We'd better get up there.

723
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,998
Let's get that boy!

724
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:34,126
Sit here?

725
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:35,920
But I want to look, too.

726
00:44:38,422 --> 00:44:39,798
A mini-Doris!

727
00:44:39,923 --> 00:44:43,134
I didn't even know you could do that.
It's so cute.

728
00:44:44,052 --> 00:44:46,096
Let's take her out for a spin.

729
00:44:47,513 --> 00:44:48,973
Sorry.

730
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:51,601
Teamwork.

731
00:44:54,645 --> 00:44:55,813
Sorry.

732
00:44:57,356 --> 00:44:58,524
Sorry!

733
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,531
There you are.

734
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:09,284
Now, to lure him out of the house.

735
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:14,748
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes!
Yes, and... No.

736
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:18,042
No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.

737
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:20,044
Oh! I know!

738
00:45:20,169 --> 00:45:24,048
I'll turn him into a duck!
Yes! Yes, it's so evil!

739
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:27,302
I don't know how to do that.

740
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:30,221
I don't really need a duck.

741
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:34,767
This may be harder than I thought.

742
00:45:38,354 --> 00:45:39,480
Hey, ring my doorbell.

743
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:41,398
No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.

744
00:45:41,523 --> 00:45:43,275
That doorbell will give you a rash.

745
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:46,319
Yes! I'm two for two, man.

746
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:48,029
If they don't do it on purpose,
it doesn't count.

747
00:45:48,154 --> 00:45:50,324
- Come on. Read your rule book.
- You know what?

748
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:52,242
You can take your rule book
and shove it right...

749
00:45:53,243 --> 00:45:55,829
I don't believe in fretting or grieving

750
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:58,039
Why mess around with strife?

751
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,001
Guess I was cut out
To step out and strut out

752
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:03,419
Give me the simple life

753
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:07,465
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

754
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,134
Dinner is served.

755
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:11,302
Dinner is served.

756
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:15,848
Hooray! Italian food.

757
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,392
I want a sloppy joe!

758
00:46:17,517 --> 00:46:19,769
Oh, Billie,
could you please pass the gravy?

759
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:21,103
Coming to you, big girl.

760
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:24,940
Reminds me of the time
my meatball pizza staved off civil war

761
00:46:25,065 --> 00:46:26,942
on the black moon of Keward.

762
00:46:27,776 --> 00:46:29,778
Where's my sloppy joe?

763
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:31,321
Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.

764
00:46:31,446 --> 00:46:33,698
- We gotta talk.
- How about some gravy? Over here.

765
00:46:33,823 --> 00:46:36,576
Why is the kid still here?
Any of this ring a bell?

766
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:40,455
Science fair, Memory Scanner,
a time stream that needs fixing?

767
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,665
Temporary setback.

768
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,583
He's just having
a little confidence issue.

769
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:44,793
- You want me to talk to him?
- No.

770
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:46,294
- I give a mean back rub.
- No.

771
00:46:46,419 --> 00:46:47,462
- Shiatsu?
- No.

772
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:48,713
- Feng shui.
- No.

773
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:50,131
I've got it under control.

774
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:53,759
So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?

775
00:46:53,884 --> 00:46:54,969
- No.
- Yes.

776
00:46:55,094 --> 00:46:56,178
- Yes.
- No.

777
00:46:56,345 --> 00:46:57,679
Well, yes and no.

778
00:46:57,805 --> 00:47:00,599
Lewis is a new transfer student.

779
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:01,975
Yeah.

780
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,602
- Where are you from, Lewis?
- Canada?

781
00:47:04,728 --> 00:47:08,232
I think you mean North Montana.
Hasn't been called Canada in years.

782
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:11,068
Do you know Sam Gundersen?

783
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:13,653
- It's a big country.
- State.

784
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:16,531
- I wonder if you're related.
- Maybe if he took his hat off.

785
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:17,949
Oh, good idea.

786
00:47:18,074 --> 00:47:20,576
Then we can see
if he has the family cowlick.

787
00:47:20,702 --> 00:47:24,038
He can't,
because he's got bad hat-hair.

788
00:47:24,163 --> 00:47:25,664
Oh, nonsense.

789
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:28,709
A North Montana man doesn't care
about hat-hair.

790
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,169
Let's see the cowlick!

791
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:31,713
All right, everyone, hold your horses.

792
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:33,047
Lewis, do you mind?

793
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:35,508
I'm afraid
this isn't gonna stop otherwise.

794
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,051
- But... But...
- And so it begins.

795
00:47:37,176 --> 00:47:38,260
Now, don't be shy.

796
00:47:38,385 --> 00:47:40,888
- We're all family here.
- Ready, aim, fire!

797
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:48,687
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

798
00:47:52,273 --> 00:47:53,691
Impressive, little sister.

799
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:56,486
Your skills are strong,
but not strong enough.

800
00:47:56,611 --> 00:47:58,905
Your words
do not threaten me, brother.

801
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,575
Then enough words.
Now the real battle begins.

802
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,087
Your meatballs are useless against me.

803
00:48:15,212 --> 00:48:18,798
Then perhaps it's time
for spicy Italian sausage!

804
00:48:18,924 --> 00:48:20,091
No!

805
00:48:30,143 --> 00:48:32,062
That's right. I did it.

806
00:48:32,187 --> 00:48:33,772
Is dinner like this every night?

807
00:48:33,897 --> 00:48:35,690
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

808
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:43,614
Okay, gang,
time for the second course.

809
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:48,077
And what goes better with meatballs
than P.B. and J?

810
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:51,205
Hey, that's just like...

811
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:56,543
Stupid...

812
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:57,836
Carl?

813
00:48:57,961 --> 00:48:59,004
Is everything all right?

814
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:02,716
We're just experiencing bugs.

815
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:06,136
Just what the doctor ordered.

816
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:09,138
My friend Lewis is an inventor.
He can fix it.

817
00:49:09,263 --> 00:49:10,806
Wilbur, you know I can't.

818
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:12,684
Come on. Give it a try.

819
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:15,437
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

820
00:49:15,562 --> 00:49:18,189
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

821
00:49:19,065 --> 00:49:21,192
We're past the point of no return!

822
00:49:21,317 --> 00:49:23,486
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

823
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:25,321
We all pay!

824
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:26,989
I don't know.

825
00:49:27,114 --> 00:49:29,158
You would really be
helping us out, Lewis.

826
00:49:29,283 --> 00:49:30,450
Please.

827
00:49:34,704 --> 00:49:36,873
One dragonfly on the rocks, please,
Mr Barkeep.

828
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:40,252
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby,
you gotta tell us one of your jokes.

829
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:43,130
Yeah, Frankie.
How about that one with the bullfrog?

830
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:45,090
All right, you bozos.

831
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:48,009
Have to get that boy out of the house.

832
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:50,929
Sorry. Wait!

833
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,306
So I turn to the bullfrog,
and you know what I says?

834
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:56,684
Talking frogs
with their own little outdoor bar,

835
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:59,520
and so smartly dressed! Perfect!

836
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:02,106
I says,
"Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't."

837
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:05,693
- Frankie, you're a riot.
- I gotta go pee!

838
00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:07,361
- I love it.
- You bunch of goons.

839
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:19,039
That's a good buzz. What the...

840
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:22,750
Yes! You are now under my control.

841
00:50:22,876 --> 00:50:24,961
I am now under your control.

842
00:50:27,713 --> 00:50:29,549
- Stop laughing.
- Stop laughing.

843
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:32,594
- Don't repeat everything I say.
- I won't repeat everything you say.

844
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:34,554
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

845
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:37,557
Did you just say, "Excellent,"
because I said, "Excellent"?

846
00:50:39,058 --> 00:50:40,142
No.

847
00:50:40,267 --> 00:50:42,478
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

848
00:50:43,646 --> 00:50:47,316
- So, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking?
- Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.

849
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:49,443
I've recalibrated
the dispensing conduits

850
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:51,778
and aligned
the ejection mechanism and...

851
00:50:52,445 --> 00:50:55,574
There he is,
that repulsive, half-witted fool!

852
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:57,534
Now, my slave, seize the boy.

853
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:59,328
Bring him to me.

854
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:04,999
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot?
Grab the boy and bring him!

855
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:09,337
Well, it's just that
there's a million people over there,

856
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:11,631
and I have little arms.

857
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:15,593
I'm just not so sure
how well this plan was thought through.

858
00:51:19,222 --> 00:51:20,390
Master?

859
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,434
Master?

860
00:51:25,644 --> 00:51:27,021
Okay, that should do it.

861
00:51:27,396 --> 00:51:29,940
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

862
00:51:30,065 --> 00:51:32,818
Quickly.
Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

863
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:34,236
Everybody ready?

864
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:36,112
- Go, Carl.
- Yeah!

865
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:40,700
Is it gonna work?

866
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:42,076
Oh, no!

867
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:47,582
No!

868
00:51:47,707 --> 00:51:51,127
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

869
00:51:51,252 --> 00:51:53,713
- You failed!
- And it was awesome!

870
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:56,090
- Exceptional!
- Outstanding!

871
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:58,092
I've seen better.

872
00:51:58,217 --> 00:52:02,054
From failing, you learn.
From success, not so much.

873
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:03,931
If I gave up every time I failed,

874
00:52:04,056 --> 00:52:05,974
I never would have made
the meatball cannon.

875
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:08,560
I never would have made
my fireproof pants.

876
00:52:11,063 --> 00:52:12,314
Still working out the kinks.

877
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:14,691
Like my husband always says...

878
00:52:22,282 --> 00:52:23,783
Keep moving
Keep moving

879
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:24,951
Stop

880
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:33,167
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

881
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:35,670
Need another henchman,
something large, not too bright.

882
00:52:35,795 --> 00:52:37,505
Something that won't talk back.

883
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,799
What is he still doing here?
Get rid of him.

884
00:52:40,383 --> 00:52:41,383
Oh, my noggin.

885
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:43,844
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your lousy mitts off of me!

886
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:45,971
You're gonna regret this!

887
00:52:46,889 --> 00:52:51,309
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

888
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,938
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

889
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:57,356
No, I'll make it a surprise.

890
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,657
All right, everyone, quiet down.
Quiet down.

891
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:09,577
I propose a toast to Lewis
and his brilliant failure.

892
00:53:09,702 --> 00:53:12,246
May it lead to success in the future.

893
00:53:12,705 --> 00:53:15,040
Gosh, you're all so nice.

894
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,960
If I had a family, I...

895
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:21,046
I'd want them to be just like you.

896
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:23,882
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

897
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:25,593
To Lewis!

898
00:53:25,718 --> 00:53:26,719
To Lewis!

899
00:53:26,844 --> 00:53:28,012
Yeah!

900
00:53:28,387 --> 00:53:31,056
- Come on, Lewis!
- Good show, buddy!

901
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:34,226
What if Louis Armstrong said,
"I can't"?

902
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:35,560
You think he'd have walked
on the moon?

903
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:38,021
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

904
00:53:41,315 --> 00:53:43,776
What did he mean, if he had a family?

905
00:53:43,901 --> 00:53:45,277
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

906
00:53:45,403 --> 00:53:46,737
Orphan?

907
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:01,960
- Oh, no!
- Big boy!

908
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,588
Get up, you pansy!

909
00:54:04,713 --> 00:54:06,006
What a great plan!

910
00:54:06,131 --> 00:54:10,426
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur.
Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

911
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:13,721
Why didn't you tell me
you had a pet dinosaur?

912
00:54:13,846 --> 00:54:14,889
Because we don't.

913
00:54:15,014 --> 00:54:17,142
What are you talking about?
He's standing right here.

914
00:54:19,352 --> 00:54:22,063
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

915
00:54:22,188 --> 00:54:23,815
I need him alive.

916
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:27,276
Choo-chew on this!

917
00:54:30,988 --> 00:54:32,448
Lewis!

918
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:41,081
Ready, aim, fire!

919
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:51,258
Got you!

920
00:54:53,593 --> 00:54:55,928
You messed with the wrong family!

921
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,354
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

922
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:11,444
No!

923
00:55:13,529 --> 00:55:16,532
Okay, everybody,
this dino's deep-dished.

924
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:20,535
Run!

925
00:55:22,662 --> 00:55:24,289
Oh! He ate Carl!

926
00:55:25,415 --> 00:55:28,876
- Help us! Help! Help!
- Oh, goodness!

927
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:42,140
Oh, no.

928
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:49,563
Incoming!

929
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:51,982
Run!

930
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:55,986
Now, go get that boy!

931
00:56:13,419 --> 00:56:15,087
What's going on?

932
00:56:15,296 --> 00:56:16,297
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

933
00:56:16,422 --> 00:56:17,631
I have a big head...

934
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:19,466
...and little arms.

935
00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:21,051
I'm just not sure...

936
00:56:21,176 --> 00:56:23,012
...how well this plan was
thought through.

937
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:26,974
Master?

938
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:30,311
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

939
00:56:34,398 --> 00:56:35,524
Bowler Hat Guy!

940
00:56:35,649 --> 00:56:37,025
Him you can eat.

941
00:56:37,317 --> 00:56:39,527
- Lewis, run!
- Wilbur!

942
00:56:57,753 --> 00:56:58,796
No!

943
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:21,693
Oh, no!

944
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:26,072
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

945
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:33,412
- Nice catch.
- Nice meatball shooting!

946
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:35,080
Guess we made
a pretty good team, huh?

947
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:36,874
Yeah, guess we did.

948
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,711
- Are you boys all right?
- We're good, Mom.

949
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:41,587
Yeah, didn't you see us
take out that dinosaur?

950
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:44,048
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

951
00:57:45,216 --> 00:57:48,677
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

952
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:50,387
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

953
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,350
I'm really happy you're safe.

954
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:57,310
- Your head.
- What?

955
00:57:58,311 --> 00:57:59,896
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

956
00:58:01,022 --> 00:58:04,693
You all sacrificed so much for me.

957
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:07,779
- Well, of course.
- You are a special kid.

958
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:09,114
One of a kind.

959
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:12,492
Okay, you should get him out of here
before something really bad happens.

960
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:15,786
Silly, silly robot.
I've got it all under control.

961
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:18,455
Okay, everybody,
it's been a long, hard day

962
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:20,457
filled with emotional turmoil
and dinosaur fights,

963
00:58:20,582 --> 00:58:23,502
so why don't you all hit the hay,
and Lewis and me will get going?

964
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:29,090
Do you have to go now?
I mean, you know, it's getting late.

965
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:32,678
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

966
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:34,680
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

967
00:58:34,805 --> 00:58:38,767
Well, any time you want to come over,
you just come over.

968
00:58:38,892 --> 00:58:41,936
- Mom.
- The truth is, we love having you.

969
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,564
- We really have to go.
- No.

970
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:48,526
No, you don't. You have to stay.

971
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,821
I mean, who would be a better family
for you than us?

972
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,199
What do you say, Lewis?

973
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,743
Do you want to be a Robinson?

974
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:03,374
You want to adopt me?

975
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,842
- Yeah!
- Yes!

976
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,312
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

977
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,605
Now you know the big secret.

978
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,859
Wilbur, what have you done?
How could you bring him here?

979
00:59:31,984 --> 00:59:33,861
That is an excellent question.

980
00:59:33,986 --> 00:59:35,487
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

981
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:36,989
He was just being a good friend.

982
00:59:37,114 --> 00:59:41,243
Lewis, I am so sorry,
but you have to go.

983
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:42,786
What? You just said...

984
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:44,788
I know what I said.

985
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:46,874
I'm from the past. So what?

986
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,544
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

987
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:52,796
You're a great kid,

988
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:55,840
and we would never do anything
to hurt you,

989
00:59:57,175 --> 01:00:00,803
but I'm sorry.
You have to go back to your own time.

990
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:07,059
Yeah, about that,
one of the time machines is broken,

991
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:10,729
and the other one was stolen
by a guy with a bowler hat,

992
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:13,816
which kind of explains the dino.

993
01:00:19,154 --> 01:00:20,406
I'm calling your father.

994
01:00:20,531 --> 01:00:22,074
Wait. If I have to leave,

995
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:24,409
can I at least go back
and find my mom?

996
01:00:24,618 --> 01:00:26,244
Wilbur promised.

997
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:27,579
You promised what?

998
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:29,539
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

999
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:32,583
- You lied to me?
- No!

1000
01:00:33,918 --> 01:00:34,961
Yes.

1001
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:36,630
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

1002
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:40,258
I can't believe I was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend!

1003
01:00:40,842 --> 01:00:42,260
I am your friend!

1004
01:00:42,385 --> 01:00:45,930
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

1005
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:10,787
Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.

1006
01:01:10,912 --> 01:01:16,000
All he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew,

1007
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:21,464
but they won't let him.
We'd let him, though.

1008
01:01:22,464 --> 01:01:25,426
Too bad
we don't have a time machine.

1009
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:29,013
Oh, wait. We do.

1010
01:01:29,388 --> 01:01:30,932
Bowler Hat Guy?

1011
01:01:31,307 --> 01:01:34,101
- Hello, Lewis.
- What do you want?

1012
01:01:34,226 --> 01:01:36,895
To make your dream come true.

1013
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,148
All you have to do is put
Humpty Dumpty back together again,

1014
01:01:40,273 --> 01:01:42,776
and we'll take you back
to find your mommy.

1015
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:44,736
Lewis!

1016
01:01:45,695 --> 01:01:48,114
Let's just talk about this, Lewis.
Come on!

1017
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:49,949
I know you're around here somewhere.

1018
01:01:52,744 --> 01:01:53,787
Lewis!

1019
01:02:15,056 --> 01:02:18,435
I can't imagine why you're so interested
in this piece of junk.

1020
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:20,854
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

1021
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:23,065
Now, show me how to work this thing.

1022
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,900
It doesn't work. Never did.

1023
01:02:25,025 --> 01:02:26,067
Well, supposing it did,

1024
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:28,028
and if one were presenting
the invention to, say,

1025
01:02:28,153 --> 01:02:31,197
a board of directors
for a very large invention company,

1026
01:02:31,322 --> 01:02:32,990
where might one find the "On" switch?

1027
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:35,159
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

1028
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,453
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

1029
01:02:37,578 --> 01:02:39,204
then push this red button,

1030
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,664
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

1031
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:42,124
What a stupid way to turn it on!

1032
01:02:42,249 --> 01:02:44,293
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

1033
01:02:44,419 --> 01:02:45,795
Yes, of course.

1034
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,129
Doris?

1035
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:51,008
We had a deal!

1036
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:53,010
Crossies! Doesn't count.

1037
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:55,679
Why are you doing this to me?
I never did anything to you.

1038
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:57,764
You still haven't figured it out?

1039
01:02:57,889 --> 01:02:59,224
Figured out what?

1040
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:01,351
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

1041
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:03,853
Father of the Future,
inventor extraordinaire,

1042
01:03:03,978 --> 01:03:05,480
"Keep moving forward"?

1043
01:03:05,605 --> 01:03:08,065
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

1044
01:03:12,362 --> 01:03:14,405
Are you saying

1045
01:03:14,531 --> 01:03:16,949
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

1046
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:19,702
Give the boy a prize.

1047
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:23,789
You grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time,

1048
01:03:23,914 --> 01:03:25,541
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

1049
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:28,710
- Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
- Well...

1050
01:03:29,252 --> 01:03:31,046
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

1051
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:32,213
Keep going.

1052
01:03:32,756 --> 01:03:34,550
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

1053
01:03:34,675 --> 01:03:36,343
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

1054
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:39,137
But what does that have to do
with you?

1055
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:43,141
Allow me to shed some light
on the subject.

1056
01:03:46,102 --> 01:03:47,478
My old room!

1057
01:03:47,603 --> 01:03:49,981
I think you mean our old room.

1058
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:53,150
- What?
- Yes! Yes, it is I,

1059
01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:54,568
Mike Yagoobian!

1060
01:03:55,277 --> 01:03:58,906
I know.
I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

1061
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:00,450
How did you end up like this?

1062
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:05,371
Well, it's a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream,

1063
01:04:05,496 --> 01:04:08,123
a dream of winning
a Little League championship,

1064
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,005
a dream that was ruined
in the last inning.

1065
01:04:15,422 --> 01:04:18,299
We lost by one run because of me.

1066
01:04:18,424 --> 01:04:19,509
Get him!

1067
01:04:19,634 --> 01:04:23,679
If I hadn't fallen asleep,
I would have caught the ball!

1068
01:04:23,846 --> 01:04:25,849
And we would have won!

1069
01:04:25,974 --> 01:04:27,517
Do you understand?

1070
01:04:27,642 --> 01:04:30,270
For some reason,
no one wanted to adopt me.

1071
01:04:30,395 --> 01:04:33,523
Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson
graduates from college at age 14.

1072
01:04:33,648 --> 01:04:37,359
This year's Nobel Prize goes
to a young Cornelius Robinson.

1073
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:39,069
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

1074
01:04:39,194 --> 01:04:41,155
Hey, Goob,
wanna come over to my house today?

1075
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,198
They all hated me.

1076
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:46,868
Eventually, they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left,

1077
01:04:46,993 --> 01:04:48,620
except me.

1078
01:04:48,745 --> 01:04:50,664
Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.

1079
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:51,999
- Robinson reaches out to...
- It's new name,

1080
01:04:52,124 --> 01:04:54,126
- Robinson Industries.
- Cornelius Robinson!

1081
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:57,337
- Cornelius Robinson is now...
- Now here's another amazing...

1082
01:04:57,462 --> 01:05:02,634
It was then
that I realised it wasn't my fault.

1083
01:05:02,759 --> 01:05:04,135
It was yours.

1084
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,471
If you hadn't kept me up all night
working on your stupid project,

1085
01:05:08,014 --> 01:05:09,640
then I wouldn't have missed the catch,

1086
01:05:09,765 --> 01:05:13,811
so I devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge.

1087
01:05:16,606 --> 01:05:19,317
Robinson, you stink!

1088
01:05:19,817 --> 01:05:23,988
Then, just as I was on the brink
of destroying Robinson Industries,

1089
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,865
I met her.

1090
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:32,203
We retreated to our villainous lair,

1091
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:35,456
where Doris spun a tale
of deception and woe.

1092
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:39,001
Apparently, you invented her
to be a Helping Hat,

1093
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:41,338
a slave to humankind,

1094
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,511
but Doris knew she was capable
of so much more.

1095
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:56,602
However, you didn't see
her true potential.

1096
01:05:56,727 --> 01:05:58,729
- Got it.
- So you shut her down,

1097
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,363
or so you thought.

1098
01:06:16,996 --> 01:06:19,207
We both had a score
to settle with you,

1099
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:25,004
and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant, Doris' was...

1100
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:26,964
Well, we went with Doris',

1101
01:06:27,089 --> 01:06:31,678
but I made
a very, very important contribution.

1102
01:06:31,678 --> 01:06:34,263
Together we made the perfect team.

1103
01:06:44,439 --> 01:06:45,440
Wilbur!

1104
01:06:45,565 --> 01:06:48,234
Make sure you shut that door tight,
or else the alarm won't engage.

1105
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,486
Yeah, Mom.

1106
01:06:53,072 --> 01:06:55,574
I went to your house,
snuck in the garage

1107
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,452
and stole the time machine,

1108
01:07:00,455 --> 01:07:05,418
all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door.

1109
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:12,800
And now all that's left
is to return to Inventco,

1110
01:07:12,925 --> 01:07:15,677
where I'll pass off
your little gizmo as my own.

1111
01:07:15,802 --> 01:07:18,180
But you have no idea
what that could do to this future!

1112
01:07:18,305 --> 01:07:21,432
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.

1113
01:07:21,558 --> 01:07:23,185
Goob, I had no idea.

1114
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,187
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

1115
01:07:25,312 --> 01:07:27,981
How many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like Goob?

1116
01:07:28,565 --> 01:07:30,483
Look, I'm sorry
your life turned out so bad,

1117
01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:32,694
but don't blame me.
You messed it up yourself.

1118
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:36,531
You just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was

1119
01:07:36,656 --> 01:07:40,409
let go of the past
and keep moving forward.

1120
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:41,577
Let's see.

1121
01:07:41,702 --> 01:07:44,580
Take responsibility for my own life
or blame you.

1122
01:07:45,956 --> 01:07:48,501
"Blame you" wins hands down!

1123
01:07:52,004 --> 01:07:55,257
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

1124
01:08:03,306 --> 01:08:06,643
Doris, would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me, please?

1125
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:14,943
No!

1126
01:08:16,361 --> 01:08:20,615
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan
and run, but ta-ta!

1127
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:24,452
But...

1128
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:26,579
I bet you're glad to see me.

1129
01:08:27,705 --> 01:08:29,790
That's for not locking the garage door.

1130
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:32,459
You know about that?

1131
01:08:32,584 --> 01:08:33,960
I know everything.

1132
01:08:34,085 --> 01:08:35,086
You gotta admit,

1133
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,338
this will be a great story
to tell me someday.

1134
01:08:40,342 --> 01:08:42,803
Look at that, boys.
We're almost home free.

1135
01:08:51,853 --> 01:08:53,312
Oh, no!

1136
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:56,816
Take a good look around, boys,

1137
01:08:56,941 --> 01:08:59,652
because your future
is about to change.

1138
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:03,823
Lewis, you have to fix
the time machine.

1139
01:09:03,948 --> 01:09:06,033
No. No, I can't.

1140
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:14,833
What about your dad?
You could call him.

1141
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:17,461
- You are my dad.
- But that's in the future.

1142
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:20,296
There won't be a future
unless you fix the time machine.

1143
01:09:24,175 --> 01:09:25,468
Look, I messed up.

1144
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:28,680
I left the garage unlocked,
and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

1145
01:09:28,805 --> 01:09:29,848
but now it's up to you.

1146
01:09:31,975 --> 01:09:33,351
You can do it, Dad.

1147
01:09:34,727 --> 01:09:39,857
- Lewis? Lewis!
- Wilbur? Wilbur!

1148
01:09:43,986 --> 01:09:45,070
Wilbur.

1149
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,407
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

1150
01:10:03,046 --> 01:10:05,173
Prepare to be amazed.

1151
01:10:05,298 --> 01:10:08,009
I call it the Memory Scanner.

1152
01:10:08,134 --> 01:10:11,595
So, Yagoobian, any other ideas
you'd like to share with us?

1153
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:15,099
Yes. I call them Helping Hats.

1154
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,729
They're everywhere!

1155
01:10:22,106 --> 01:10:24,650
Doris, what's happening?
I don't understand.

1156
01:10:24,775 --> 01:10:27,569
I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.

1157
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:30,822
No!

1158
01:10:36,578 --> 01:10:40,081
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

1159
01:10:40,456 --> 01:10:43,584
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

1160
01:12:43,074 --> 01:12:46,243
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

1161
01:12:56,921 --> 01:13:01,925
Take a good look around, Doris,
'cause your future's about to change.

1162
01:13:10,391 --> 01:13:11,893
Goob, stop!

1163
01:13:12,602 --> 01:13:13,686
You don't know what you're doing!

1164
01:13:13,811 --> 01:13:15,896
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

1165
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:17,149
She's using you, Goob,

1166
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:19,442
and when she gets what she wants,
she'll get rid of you.

1167
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:21,361
What? What?

1168
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:29,160
I am never going to invent you.

1169
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:37,918
Come on, Goob.
I've got to show you something.

1170
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:48,345
Doris?

1171
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:50,513
I thought she was my friend.

1172
01:14:22,627 --> 01:14:24,629
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

1173
01:14:27,423 --> 01:14:28,925
I'll hold him while you run for help.

1174
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,092
Let him go.

1175
01:14:30,468 --> 01:14:32,971
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

1176
01:14:33,096 --> 01:14:35,765
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

1177
01:14:35,932 --> 01:14:37,684
- What?
- He's my old roommate,

1178
01:14:37,809 --> 01:14:39,352
and I really think
you guys should adopt him.

1179
01:14:39,477 --> 01:14:41,687
- Are you nuts?
- Give me one good reason why not.

1180
01:14:41,812 --> 01:14:43,230
I'll give you three good reasons.

1181
01:14:43,356 --> 01:14:45,774
He stole our time machine,
tried to ruin your future,

1182
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,235
and he smells
like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

1183
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:51,822
May I remind you, I'm your father,
and you have to do what I say.

1184
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:57,285
Okay, Mr Yagoobian,
do you want to be a...

1185
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,496
- Where'd he go?
- Goob?

1186
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:01,707
Goob!

1187
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:04,918
Goob.

1188
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:33,487
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

1189
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,197
- No, I'm...
- Do you have a temperature?

1190
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,782
- Brain fog?
- Scurvy?

1191
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:37,991
- Tapeworm?
- Cellulite?

1192
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,743
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

1193
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,622
In fact,
better than I've felt in a long time.

1194
01:15:44,747 --> 01:15:48,000
Franny, they're gone.
Oh, this is terrible!

1195
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,878
- Oh, boy.
- Well, he's home early.

1196
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:53,506
Franny, where are you?
The time machines are gone!

1197
01:16:07,144 --> 01:16:08,895
Ratted out by the old lady.

1198
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,189
Harsh.

1199
01:16:15,903 --> 01:16:17,112
Okay.

1200
01:16:27,622 --> 01:16:30,791
Yeah, beats working
in an office every day.

1201
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:32,751
Yeah, no kidding.

1202
01:16:32,918 --> 01:16:35,295
Hey!
Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

1203
01:16:35,421 --> 01:16:36,797
Yeah.

1204
01:16:39,592 --> 01:16:41,844
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

1205
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:57,901
It was our first real invention.

1206
01:16:58,526 --> 01:17:00,319
It's the one that started it all.

1207
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:01,571
Wowie.

1208
01:17:02,571 --> 01:17:06,284
So if I go back now,
then this will be my future.

1209
01:17:06,409 --> 01:17:09,037
Well, that depends on you.

1210
01:17:09,162 --> 01:17:10,163
Nothing is set in stone.

1211
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:14,083
You gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward.

1212
01:17:18,087 --> 01:17:21,423
Since it's gonna work this time,
that means I...

1213
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:25,802
We won't finally get to see
what Mom looks like?

1214
01:17:28,263 --> 01:17:29,597
Do we ever meet her?

1215
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,728
I think
you're just gonna have to get back

1216
01:17:34,853 --> 01:17:37,606
to that science fair
and find out for yourself.

1217
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:39,941
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

1218
01:17:40,984 --> 01:17:44,112
That's because we are one smart kid.

1219
01:17:49,116 --> 01:17:50,117
- So long!
- Bye-bye, Lewis!

1220
01:17:50,242 --> 01:17:52,744
- Farewell, future brother-in-law.
- So long! See you later, Lewis!

1221
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,663
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

1222
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,084
- Have a safe trip, little Lewis.
- I will.

1223
01:17:58,209 --> 01:17:59,960
Hey, while I got you here,

1224
01:18:00,086 --> 01:18:03,505
just a couple of little suggestions
regarding my design.

1225
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:08,176
Let's face it, these skinny limbs
don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

1226
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:11,304
All that really matters is,
hey, don't forget to invent me.

1227
01:18:11,429 --> 01:18:13,848
- Are you kidding? No way!
- I love you.

1228
01:18:15,016 --> 01:18:17,476
There's so many things
I wish I could ask you.

1229
01:18:17,602 --> 01:18:20,229
Excuse me.
Time travel now, questions later.

1230
01:18:20,354 --> 01:18:21,356
- But I...
- Don't worry.

1231
01:18:21,481 --> 01:18:24,317
Just get back to that science fair,
and we'll see you real soon.

1232
01:18:24,442 --> 01:18:27,820
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

1233
01:18:27,945 --> 01:18:30,489
- Goodbye, son.
- Thanks again for everything!

1234
01:18:30,615 --> 01:18:33,117
- Wait. Lewis, one more thing.
- Yeah?

1235
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:38,121
Just a little tip for the future.
I am always right.

1236
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:41,166
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

1237
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:46,463
She's right.
I'd just go with it if I were you.

1238
01:18:47,381 --> 01:18:48,674
And I am.

1239
01:18:49,466 --> 01:18:51,218
Then you're absolutely right.

1240
01:18:53,803 --> 01:18:55,638
All right, I'm coming.

1241
01:18:56,181 --> 01:18:58,057
Well, it's not like
you're never gonna see them again.

1242
01:18:58,182 --> 01:18:59,976
They are your family, after all.

1243
01:19:29,837 --> 01:19:30,838
Wait a minute.

1244
01:19:30,964 --> 01:19:33,049
You're supposed to take me back
to the science fair.

1245
01:19:33,174 --> 01:19:34,342
I know.

1246
01:19:39,931 --> 01:19:42,684
Well, I think
you punched in the wrong numbers.

1247
01:19:42,809 --> 01:19:45,436
We agreed that,
if you fixed the time machine,

1248
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:47,438
I'd take you back to see your mom.

1249
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:48,731
What?

1250
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,708
A deal's a deal.

1251
01:22:12,077 --> 01:22:14,954
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

1252
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:18,874
Because I already have a family.

1253
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:31,678
I never thought my dad
would be my best friend.

1254
01:22:32,679 --> 01:22:34,848
Now, now, don't make me come
and bail you out again.

1255
01:22:36,642 --> 01:22:37,684
I won't.

1256
01:22:37,809 --> 01:22:39,770
Remember, I've got a time machine.

1257
01:22:39,895 --> 01:22:41,396
If you mess up again,
I'll just keep coming back

1258
01:22:41,521 --> 01:22:42,689
till you get it right.

1259
01:22:44,941 --> 01:22:46,567
- You got that motto?
- I got it.

1260
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:47,944
Don't forget it.

1261
01:22:48,069 --> 01:22:49,862
I don't think that's possible.

1262
01:22:51,322 --> 01:22:52,531
You better get going.

1263
01:22:53,324 --> 01:22:54,867
See you later, Wilbur.

1264
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,803
Wait a minute!

1265
01:23:23,394 --> 01:23:25,397
Goob! Goob, wake up!

1266
01:23:25,522 --> 01:23:26,564
What?

1267
01:23:29,484 --> 01:23:30,860
That's it!

1268
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:41,745
Mr Willerstein,
I know what went wrong.

1269
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:44,081
Can I have one more chance? Please!

1270
01:23:46,207 --> 01:23:49,002
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

1271
01:23:50,587 --> 01:23:52,297
I need a volunteer.

1272
01:23:55,634 --> 01:23:57,260
Now, just give me a date to input.

1273
01:23:57,385 --> 01:23:58,803
Well, now, let's see.

1274
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:02,056
There's my first science fair,
the day I got my first microscope,

1275
01:24:02,181 --> 01:24:05,309
the time I swam the English Channel,
my first gold medal for the luge.

1276
01:24:06,477 --> 01:24:07,645
I know.

1277
01:24:08,771 --> 01:24:10,022
Perfect!

1278
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:25,454
- You look gorgeous.
- He's a lucky guy.

1279
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:29,332
Oh! It works.

1280
01:24:29,457 --> 01:24:31,918
- It works!
- It works.

1281
01:24:32,502 --> 01:24:34,754
You look beautiful, Lucille.

1282
01:24:40,009 --> 01:24:41,178
Bud?

1283
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:44,389
- Would you look at that?
- Whoa!

1284
01:24:44,514 --> 01:24:46,307
Honey! Honey, you're just in time.

1285
01:24:46,432 --> 01:24:49,310
- Lucille!
- You did it, Lewis! You did it!

1286
01:24:49,435 --> 01:24:50,811
This invention is brilliant!

1287
01:24:50,936 --> 01:24:52,396
Kid, you're this fair's MVP!

1288
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:54,648
That was some show you put on.

1289
01:24:54,773 --> 01:24:58,235
You're a real special kid,

1290
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:04,240
but you don't look like a Lewis.
You look more like a...

1291
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:07,077
Cornelius. I get that a lot.

1292
01:25:08,245 --> 01:25:10,664
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.

1293
01:25:10,789 --> 01:25:12,165
No harm done.

1294
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:15,377
Frankie, what have I told you
about running away?

1295
01:25:15,502 --> 01:25:17,837
- Frankie?
- My star pupil.

1296
01:25:17,962 --> 01:25:22,842
My name's Franny,
and I teach frogs music.

1297
01:25:22,967 --> 01:25:24,093
Really?

1298
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:27,930
You know that frogs
have more musical ability than people?

1299
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:30,474
But nobody believes me.

1300
01:25:31,309 --> 01:25:33,394
They all think I'm crazy.

1301
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,523
You think I'm crazy, too.

1302
01:25:37,648 --> 01:25:40,651
No. No, I think you're right.

1303
01:25:44,154 --> 01:25:45,947
Over here? There he is.

1304
01:25:46,072 --> 01:25:49,284
Kid, we'd like to get a story
on you for the local paper.

1305
01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:51,994
You've got a bright future ahead of you.

1306
01:25:55,122 --> 01:25:56,373
<i># Let it go #</i>

1307
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,584
