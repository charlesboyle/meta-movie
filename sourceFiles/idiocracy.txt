1
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:40,949
<i>As the 21st century began...</i>

2
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:44,434
<i>human evolution was</i>
<i>at a turning point.</i>

3
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,274
<i>Natural selection, the process by which</i>
<i>the strongest, the smartest...</i>

4
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:52,787
<i>the fastest reproduced</i>
<i>in greater numbers than the rest...</i>

5
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:56,568
<i>a process which had once</i>
<i>favored the noblest traits of man...</i>

6
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,969
<i>now began to favor</i>
<i>different traits.</i>

7
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:00,890
<i>The Joey Buttafuoco case--</i>

8
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:04,632
<i>Most science fiction of the day</i>
<i>predicted a future that was more civilized...</i>

9
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,739
<i>and more intelligent.</i>

10
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:10,706
<i>But as time went on, things seemed</i>
<i>to be heading in the opposite direction.</i>

11
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:12,699
<i>A dumbing down.</i>

12
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:14,737
<i>How did this happen?</i>

13
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:17,975
<i>Evolution does not necessarily</i>
<i>reward intelligence.</i>

14
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:20,497
<i>With no natural predators</i>
<i>to thin the herd...</i>

15
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:23,768
<i>it began to simply reward those</i>
<i>who reproduced the most...</i>

16
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:27,828
<i>and left the intelligent</i>
<i>to become an endangered species.</i>

17
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,233
Having kids is such
an important decision.

18
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,714
We're just waiting
for the right time.

19
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:37,048
It's not something you want
to rush into, obviously.

20
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:38,970
No way.

21
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,369
<i>Oh, shit,</i>
<i>I'm pregnant again!</i>

22
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,435
Shit!
I got too many damn kids!

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,638
- I thought you was on the pill or some shit!
- Hell, no!

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,627
Shit! I must've been
thinkin' of Brittany.

25
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:51,763
Brittany?
No, you didn't!

26
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:54,802
- There's no way we could have a child now.
- Mm-mm.

27
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:56,795
Not with the market
the way it is, no.

28
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,128
God, no. That just
wouldn't make any sense.

29
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:02,042
Come on over here, bitch!
He don't care about you!

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,693
Yeah? Well, there must be
somethin' he likes over here.

31
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:07,927
- She don't mean nothin' to me, baby!
- Clevon!

32
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,962
Oh, shit.
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

33
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,232
Well, we finally decided
to have children...

34
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:18,193
and I'm not pointing fingers,
but it's not going well.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,122
And this is helping.

36
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,187
I'm just saying that before I have in vitro,
maybe you should be willing to--

37
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:25,114
It's always me, right?

38
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,441
Well, it's not
my sperm count.

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,995
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm gonna fuck all y'all!

40
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,790
That's my boy!

41
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:35,096
Whoo! Whoo!

42
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,746
Clevon is lucky
to be alive.

43
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:41,080
He attempted to jump
a Jet Ski from a lake...

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,278
into a swimming pool
and impaled his crotch on an iron gate.

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,355
But thanks to recent advances
in stem cell research...

46
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,307
and the fine work of Doctors Krinski
and Altschuler...

47
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,509
Clevon should regain
full reproductive function.

48
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:53,433
Get your hands
off my junk!

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,467
Unfortunately, Trevor passed away
from a heart attack...

50
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,579
while masturbating...

51
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,651
to produce sperm
for artificial insemination.

52
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:07,577
But I have
some eggs frozen...

53
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:11,221
so just as soon as the right guy
comes along, you know--

54
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:17,681
<i>And so it went for generations...</i>

55
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:20,471
<i>although few, if any,</i>
<i>seemed to notice.</i>

56
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:26,103
<i>But in the year 2005, in a military base</i>
<i>just outside of Washington, D.C...</i>

57
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:29,979
<i>a simple army librarian</i>
<i>was unknowingly...</i>

58
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:33,818
<i>about to change the entire course</i>
<i>of human history.</i>

59
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,606
Come on, asshole!
Go on! Take him to jail!

60
00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:41,267
Hey, Bauers.

61
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:43,761
This is Peterson,
your new replacement.

62
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:47,577
- My what? I'm gettin' replaced?
- Yeah, they didn't tell you?

63
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:49,683
- No.
- Some new assignment.

64
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:51,991
They're being all weird
and hush-hush about it.

65
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,808
I don't want a new assignment.
I tell Sergeant Metsler that every time.

66
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:58,520
- I'm good at this.
- Good at what? Sittin' on ass?

67
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:01,107
<i>No one ever comes in here.</i>

68
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:04,310
Yeah, I know. It's perfect for me.
No one bothers me. I can't screw up.

69
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,347
<i>If I can just stay in here another eight years,</i>
<i>I get my pension.</i>

70
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,451
I'm all set. Can you just
get me out of this?

71
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:13,174
No way. Not this time.
It's coming from high up.

72
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:17,465
Jesus. I don't understand.
Why me?

73
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:21,044
Every time Metsler says, "Lead, follow,
or get out of the way," I get out of the way.

74
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:24,628
When he says that, you're not supposed
to choose "get out of the way."

75
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,626
It's supposed to embarrass you
into leading or at least following.

76
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:30,520
That doesn't
embarrass me.

77
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,442
Look, Joe.
You don't have a choice.

78
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,296
You're just gonna
have to follow.

79
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,762
Like, follow me upstairs,
like, now.

80
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,471
Right now?
Shouldn't I train this guy?

81
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,598
I think he can figure out how to sit on his ass
and watch TV all day. Let's go.

82
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:54,322
<i>Gentlemen, meet Joe Bauers...</i>

83
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,428
our first subject for the Human
Hibernation Experiment.

84
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,386
Now, as you know,
throughout the years...

85
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,851
many of our best pilots,
soldiers and military leaders...

86
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:04,053
often go their entire careers
without ever seeing battle.

87
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:08,695
<i>With the Human Hibernation Project,</i>
<i>we will be able to save our best men...</i>

88
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:11,610
frozen in their prime,
for use when they are needed most.

89
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,286
<i>Joe, here, is not</i>
<i>one of our best men.</i>

90
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:19,828
Mr. Bauers was chosen primarily
for how remarkably average he is.

91
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:24,405
<i>Extremely average in every</i>
<i>category. Remarkable, truly.</i>

92
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:27,158
The most average person
in our entire armed forces.

93
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,681
Additionally, he has no family,
is unmarried...

94
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,992
is an only child,
and both parents are deceased...

95
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:35,604
making him an ideal candidate,
with no one to ask any nosy questions...

96
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,683
should something go wrong
with the experiment.

97
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:42,162
<i>We had a little less luck in finding a female</i>
<i>researcher's dream within our ranks...</i>

98
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:46,162
and were forced to look
into the private sector.

99
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:49,584
<i>This is Rita. Like Joe,</i>
<i>she has no immediate family.</i>

100
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:52,310
<i>Rita agreed to participate</i>
<i>in this experiment...</i>

101
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:56,306
in exchange for dropping
of certain criminal charges and a small fee.

102
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:59,957
<i>We did, however, have to come</i>
<i>to an arrangement with her pimp...</i>

103
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,922
<i>a gentleman who goes by the name</i>
<i>Upgrayedd, which he spells thusly--</i>

104
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:09,461
<i>With two D's, as he says,</i>
<i>for a double dose of this pimping.</i>

105
00:06:09,564 --> 00:06:11,703
Upgrayedd agreed
to loan us Rita for exactly one year...

106
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:15,000
<i>and keep quiet on the matter,</i>
<i>in exchange for certain leeways...</i>

107
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,198
<i>with the local authorities</i>
<i>in running his pimp game.</i>

108
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,293
<i>First, however, there was</i>
<i>the difficult challenge of gaining his trust.</i>

109
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:26,068
<i>Collins, could we skip</i>
<i>to the technicals, please?</i>

110
00:06:26,172 --> 00:06:28,376
Sure.
Let me just finish here.

111
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:32,599
You see, a pimp's love is very different
from that of a square.

112
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,642
Collins!

113
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,266
Fine. We'll move on.

114
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,047
It is a fascinating
world though.

115
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,441
Jesus, Collins.

116
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,665
Yeah, that's--

117
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,573
Anyway, the experiment
in which these two subjects...

118
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,585
are to be placed
into a dry freeze...

119
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,928
for exactly one year
is set to begin tomorrow.

120
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,132
As you know,
this is highly classified.

121
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:15,157
<i>However, if successful, we believe humans</i>
<i>can be stored indefinitely.</i>

122
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,976
So this is kinda crazy, huh?

123
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:28,466
- What unit are you with?
- Oh, I ain't in the service.

124
00:07:28,572 --> 00:07:31,321
Oh, private sector.
Okay.

125
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,730
- So, uh, what do you do?
- A little of this, a little of that.

126
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:37,941
Wow, that's great.

127
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:40,760
You know, I really envy people
that can make a living that way--

128
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,802
<i>doing a little of this</i>
<i>and a little of that.</i>

129
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:47,512
I, uh, had a neighbor, Glen.
He used to make chainsaw sculptures...

130
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,434
and then he'd sell 'em
at the flea market.

131
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:51,354
Yeah.

132
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:56,026
So, uh, you an artist
or somethin'?

133
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,058
- Uh, yeah.
- You do paintings or--

134
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:02,523
- Yeah, paintings.
- Okay, great.

135
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,613
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you paint mostly?

136
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:12,530
I don't know, just...
people and fruit and shit.

137
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:17,589
Wow. Well, must be great to be able
to make a living doing something you love.

138
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:20,212
Yeah. It's not all it's cracked up to be.

139
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:21,909
<i>Who wants to go first?</i>

140
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,400
Me.

141
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:32,121
What the f-- Oh, hell, no. Uh-uh.

142
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,765
Hey, no. You probably don't want to do that
with the I.V.s attached and all.

143
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:38,835
- What's the matter?
- Man, Upgrayedd didn't tell me
they'd be putting me...

144
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:40,947
in no damn coffin
with tubes and shit!

145
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,921
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
It'll be safe. Trust me.

146
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:45,521
Who's Upgrayedd?

147
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:47,515
He's my boyfriend.

148
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,683
Man, how do you know
this shit's safe?

149
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,602
These guys know what they're doing.
Don't worry.

150
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,350
They've tested it on dogs
and everything.

151
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,201
What happens is, the drugs will kick in,
we drift off to sleep...

152
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,209
we wake up in a year,
you'll be paintin' again.

153
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:02,225
- <i>It'll be fine.</i>
- All right.

154
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:06,074
Upgrayedd. That's an interesting name.
Is he Dutch?

155
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:10,552
See, 'cause I knew this,
uh, Dutch exchange student.

156
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:12,114
His name was Untgrad.

157
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,162
Okay, my niggas,
we're almost set here.

158
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:16,951
Just go ahead
and lie down. Relax.

159
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:27,575
See you in a year.

160
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:30,229
<i>The Human Hibernation Project...</i>

161
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:33,234
<i>was one of the army's most</i>
<i>ambitious experiments...</i>

162
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,057
<i>and one of its most secretive.</i>

163
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:38,490
<i>But it was not immune</i>
<i>from human error.</i>

164
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,034
Freeze!

165
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,902
<i>Soon after Collins's arrest</i>
<i>and the massive scandal that followed...</i>

166
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,655
<i>the base was closed.</i>

167
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:02,262
<i>It hadn't even been a year,</i>
<i>and the entire project was simply forgotten.</i>

168
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,151
<i>Things looked bleak for Joe,</i>
<i>but they were even worse for mankind.</i>

169
00:10:08,252 --> 00:10:11,383
<i>As Joe and Rita lay dormant,</i>
<i>the years passed...</i>

170
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:15,346
<i>and mankind became stupider</i>
<i>at a frightening rate.</i>

171
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:27,320
<i>Some had high hopes</i>
<i>that genetic engineering...</i>

172
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,329
<i>would correct this</i>
<i>trend in evolution.</i>

173
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:32,469
<i>But sadly, the greatest minds</i>
<i>and resources...</i>

174
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:37,241
<i>were focused on conquering hair loss</i>
<i>and prolonging erections.</i>

175
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:44,923
<i>Meanwhile, the population exploded,</i>
<i>and intelligence continued to decline...</i>

176
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,427
<i>until humanity was incapable</i>
<i>of solving even its most basic problems.</i>

177
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:54,321
<i>Like garbage, which had been stacked</i>
<i>for centuries with no plan whatsoever...</i>

178
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:59,097
<i>leading to the Great Garbage</i>
<i>Avalanche of 2505...</i>

179
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:04,313
<i>which would set in motion the events</i>
<i>that would change the world forever.</i>

180
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:39,606
- Hold on.
- <i>Next, on The Violence Channel...</i>

181
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,846
an all-new <i>Ow! My Balls</i>!

182
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:57,529
All right.

183
00:12:04,252 --> 00:12:06,641
<i>That guy got hit in the balls.</i>

184
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:09,169
Ow, my balls!

185
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,810
Huh?

186
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:24,625
- <i>Where's--</i>
- Hold on. Shut up!

187
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:38,775
- Where's Officer Collins?
- Shut up!

188
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,355
<i>Next week on</i> Ow! My Balls!
<i>Hormel goes to Paris!</i>

189
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,999
- Are we on base?
- I'm gonna base your ass on my fist.

190
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,395
In your face, ass!
Shut up.

191
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:52,532
<i>I'm sorry. It's just--</i>
<i>Where am I?</i>

192
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,741
Shut up!
I told you already!

193
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,693
Yeah! Wouldn't shut up!

194
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,388
<i>Come in here</i>
<i>and not shut up.</i>

195
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:09,907
<i>Yeah, you were like,</i>
<i>"I'm not shuttin' up," and I was like--</i>

196
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:26,777
<i>Unaware of what year it was...</i>

197
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,745
<i>Joe wandered the streets,</i>
<i>desperate for help.</i>

198
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,121
<i>But the English language</i>
<i>had deteriorated...</i>

199
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,108
<i>into a hybrid of hillbilly, valley girl,</i>
<i>inner-city slang and various grunts.</i>

200
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:40,507
<i>Joe was able to understand</i> them...

201
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:43,833
<i>but when he spoke</i>
<i>in an ordinary voice...</i>

202
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:46,419
<i>he sounded pompous</i>
<i>and faggy to them.</i>

203
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,209
<i>Paging Doc--</i>

204
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,482
<i>Report to, uh--</i>

205
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,802
<i>Dr. Lueboo...</i>

206
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,077
<i>uh, report.</i>

207
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,929
Your floor-Your floor is now clean.

208
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,166
Your floor--
Your floor is now clean.

209
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:24,536
<i>Your floor--</i>
<i>Your floor is now clean.</i>

210
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:29,556
Hi, uh, I was in an army experiment,
and I'm not feeling so well.

211
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,147
I think it might have been
the drugs they had me on.

212
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:34,292
I've been hallucinating.

213
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,762
<i>My head is just killin' me.</i>

214
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,761
<i>My-My-My joints</i>
<i>are all achy and I--</i>

215
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:43,258
<i>Is this a hospital or--</i>

216
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:47,317
<i>Actually, I don't even know where I am.</i>

217
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,558
<i>Please proceed</i>
<i>to the diagnostic area on the right...</i>

218
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,816
- <i>and have a healthy day!</i>
- Oh. Thanks.

219
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,607
<i>Thank you!</i>

220
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:10,195
Uh, 'scuse me. I think this
might be Gatorade or somethin'.

221
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,082
- I was just looking for some regular water.
- Water?

222
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,082
- Yeah.
- You mean like in the toilet? What for?

223
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:18,970
You know, just to drink.

224
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:28,600
<i>You've got hepatitis!</i>

225
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,350
<i>Oh, is someone not</i>
<i>feeling well?</i>

226
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,867
<i>Your illness</i>
<i>is very important to us.</i>

227
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:37,721
- <i>Next.</i>
- <i>Welcome</i>
<i>to the Healthmaster Inferno...</i>

228
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,762
- <i>powered by Jormi Technology.</i>
- Uh, this goes in your mouth.

229
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:45,082
This one goes in your ear.
And this one goes in your butt.

230
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,885
Come on.

231
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:51,770
- <i>Hurry up, asshole!</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>

232
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,639
Shit. Hang on a second.

233
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,674
This one-- No.

234
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,527
- Hey, come on.
- Uh--

235
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,694
- Hurry up!
- This one. This one goes in your mouth.

236
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:08,794
Come on!

237
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:17,010
<i>Thank you for waiting.</i>
<i>Dr. Lexus will be with you shortly.</i>

238
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:25,015
<i>That's a weird misprint.</i>

239
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:30,009
Hey.
How's it hang, <i>ese</i>?

240
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:33,653
Yeah. Right.
Well, not so good, you know.

241
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:36,625
I don't really know what's going on,
but I'm seein' things.

242
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,514
I think it might be because of
these drugs the army put me on.

243
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:43,157
<i>But, if you could, uh, just get me</i>
<i>well enough to get back to base--</i>

244
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,813
Right. Kick ass.

245
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:48,915
<i>Well, don't wanna sound</i>
<i>like a dick or nothin'...</i>

246
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,737
but, uh, it says on your chart
that you're fucked up.

247
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:55,185
<i>You talk like a fag,</i>
<i>and your shit's all retarded.</i>

248
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:59,482
What I'd do is just like,
like, you know...

249
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,875
<i>like, you know what I mean? Like--</i>

250
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:07,063
- No, I'm serious here.
- Don't worry, scrot.

251
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:10,066
Now there are plenty of 'tards
out there living really kick-ass lives.

252
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:13,401
<i>My first wife was 'tarded.</i>
<i>She's a pilot now.</i>

253
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:17,209
I need for you to be serious
for a second here, okay? I need help.

254
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:18,999
There's that fag talk
we talked about.

255
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:22,776
<i>All right, so that'll be...</i>
<i>this many dollars.</i>

256
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,771
<i>And if you could just go ahead and,</i>
<i>like, put your tattoo in that shit.</i>

257
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,650
That's weird. This thing has the same
misprint as that magazine.

258
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:34,642
- What are the odds of--
- Where's your tattoo? Tattoo?

259
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:37,399
<i>Why don't you have this?</i>

260
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:41,818
Oh, God.

261
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,768
- <i>Where's your tattoo?</i>
- Oh, my God.

262
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:49,243
<i>Why come you don't</i>
<i>have a tattoo?</i>

263
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,714
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- <i>You're not unscannable, are you?</i>

264
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,013
Oh, my God!

265
00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:00,411
You're unscannable.

266
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:03,191
- Unscannable!
- No! No, you don't understand!

267
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,747
<i>You gotta let me talk</i>
<i>to someone in the army! Wait a second.</i>

268
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,568
They're all dead.
Everybody I know's dead!

269
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,325
Oh, my God! Oh!

270
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:15,349
- No! Stop! Calm down!
- Calm down! Calm down!

271
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:17,524
- How'd this happen?
- How did it happen?

272
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:20,726
<i>Your floor is now clean.</i>

273
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:22,999
Your floor is now clean.

274
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:46,331
<i>Joe had awakened to a world in crisis.</i>

275
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:49,526
<i>The economy was</i>
<i>in a state of deep neglect.</i>

276
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,944
<i>A great dust bowl</i>
<i>had ravaged food supplies.</i>

277
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:57,689
<i>And the number one movie</i>
<i>in the country was called</i> Ass.

278
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,420
<i>And that's all it was</i>
<i>for 90 minutes.</i>

279
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:09,396
<i>It won eight Oscars that year,</i>
<i>including best screenplay.</i>

280
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:16,275
Enjoy your Extra Big-Ass Fries.

281
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:19,249
You didn't gimme no fries.
I got an empty box.

282
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,072
Would you like another
Extra Big-Ass Fries?

283
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,798
I said I didn't get any.

284
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:25,688
<i>Thank you. Your account has been charged.</i>

285
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:27,610

- Please come back when you

287
00:19:31,164 --> 00:19:32,986
I'm sorry you're having trouble.

288
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,506
- Come on! My kids are starvin'.
- I'm sorry you're having trouble.

289
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,305
This should

290
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,162
Please come back when you

291
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:48,245
Your kids are starving. Carl's Jr. believes

<i>You are an unfit mother. Your children</i>

"Fuck you. I'm eating."

294
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:59,159
Welcome to Carl's Jr.

295
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,708
Would you like to try
our Extra Big-Ass Taco...

296
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:05,266
now with more molecules?

297
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,241
<i>Hey! Is this particular</i>
<i>individual the unfit mother?</i>

298
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:12,123
- Me? No.
- Okay. This particular individual is unscannable.

299
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:17,527
Listen, I can explain, okay?
I was in an army experiment.

300
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:22,803
<i>Wait a second. There's the other pod</i>
<i>from the army experiment.</i>

301
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:25,078
<i>There was a girl.</i>
<i>She was from the same experiment.</i>

302
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,409
Yeah, that's enough of your bullshit, sir.

303
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:30,450
<i>Joe was arrested for not</i>
<i>paying his hospital bill...</i>

304
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:33,851
<i>and not having</i>
<i>his U.P.C. tattoo.</i>

305
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:39,032
<i>He would soon discover that</i>
<i>in the future, justice was not only blind...</i>

306
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:42,776
<i>but had become</i>
<i>rather retarded as well.</i>

307
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,723
You shut up! Now--

308
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:49,974
I'm fixin' to commensurate
this trial here.

309
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:54,516
<i>We gonna see if we can't</i>
<i>come up with a verdict up in here.</i>

310
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,613
<i>Now, since y'all</i>
<i>say you ain't got no money...</i>

311
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,912

<i>So, put your hands together</i>

314
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:12,373
You're my lawyer?

315
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:16,632
Says here you, uh,
robbed a hospital?

316
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:19,033
- Why'd you do that?
- Yeah. I'm not guilty.

317
00:21:19,132 --> 00:21:21,815
- That's not what the other lawyer said.
- What do you mean what the--

318
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,803
Listen, you gotta get me
on the stand, okay?

319
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:26,769
I can explain everything. We can take 'em
to your house, show 'em the pod.

320
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,046
<i>Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!</i>

321
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:32,442
<i>Now, prosecutor,</i>
<i>why you think he done it?</i>

322
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:35,441
Okay, number one, Your Honor,
just look at him.

323
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,849
He talks like a fag too.

324
00:21:40,956 --> 00:21:44,501
And "B," we've got all this,
like, evidence...

325
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,419
of how, like, this guy didn't
even pay at the hospital.

326
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,330
<i>And I heard that he doesn't</i>
<i>even have his tattoo.</i>

327
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:52,599
I know!

328
00:21:52,699 --> 00:21:56,082
And I'm all, "You've gotta be shittin' me."
But check this out, man.

329
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:58,969
Judge should be like, "Guilty."
Peace.

330
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:07,031
- Objection!
- What are you objectifyin' on?

331
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:09,303
- Come on. Just get me on the stand.
- Okay.

332
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,918
- Um, Your Honor?
- Hmm?

333
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,775
I object...

334
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,705
that this guy also broke
my apartment to shit.

335
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:20,721
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- What?

336
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:25,170
And you know what else? I object that
he's not gonna have any money to pay me...

337
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:28,276
<i>after he pays back all the money</i>
<i>he stole from the hospital!</i>

338
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,289
Don't say I stole.
You're my lawyer.

339
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,250
And I object.

340
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:36,057
<i>I object that he interrupted me</i>
<i>while I was watching</i> Ow! My Balls!

341
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:40,433
That is not okay! And I rest my case!

342
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,842
Your Honor, I'm pretty sure
we have a mistrial here, sir.

343
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,169
- I'm gonna mistrial my foot up
your ass, you don't shut up.

344
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,634
- Please, listen.
- "Please, listen."

345
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:50,389
I didn't steal anything.

346
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:52,314
I was part of an army

348
00:22:55,388 --> 00:23:00,276
<i>but his perceived effeminate voice</i>
<i>only drew big gales of stupid laughter.</i>

349
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,973
Guilty!

350
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:06,516
<i>Without adequate legal representation,</i>

351
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:11,126

Uh, yeah, I don't see you in here.
So, you're gonna have to, uh, stay in prison.

I was definitely in prison, okay?

414
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:58,842

So? Shut up,
'cause you broke my house.

Yeah, really. Now, look.
Okay, here's the deal.

433
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,401
I've been thinking.
It's been 500 years.

434
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:23,354
Someone has to have invented a way
to travel back in time by now.

435
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,234
You know, I think they were pretty close
even in my day. You know?

436
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,154
- With Einstein and guys like that?
- Uh-huh.

437
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:30,706
- You know, scientists? You know?
- Uh.

438
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:33,818
A time machine,
for time travel.

439
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:36,436
- <i>Do they have one?</i>
- What?

440
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:44,313
Jesus. I knew that was
too much to hope for.

441
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:47,411
No, no, they got
a time machine.

442
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:49,338
- They do?
- Yeah.

443
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,258
- Are-Are-Are you sure?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

444
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:55,033
- Can it get me back to 2005?
- Oh, yeah, but it's, like, really expensive.

445
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:58,230
And it breaks all the time 'cause
some smart guy made it a long time ago.

446
00:29:58,332 --> 00:30:00,404
I don't care.
Just get me there, okay?

447
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:01,915
- Well--
- Please!

448
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:05,110
Listen, I-- I--
I "supersize" with you...

449
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:07,863
<i>but didn't you go to jail</i>
<i>for not havin' enough money?</i>

450
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:11,924
Okay, how about this? You get me
to the time machine, and when I get back...

451
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:13,937
I open a savings account
in your name.

452
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,465
That way, 500 years later,
it'll be worth billions.

453
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:18,033
- <i>Billions!</i>
- 'Cause?

454
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,857
'Cause of the interest,
it'll be worth billions of dollars.

455
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:23,411
- Oh, I-- I like money.
- Yeah.

456
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:26,385
- How many billions?
- Like, 10.

457
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,525
Yeah, suck one.
Time machine costs, like, 20.

458
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,310
Yeah? Okay.
Uh, 30, Frito.

459
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:35,445
<i>Thirty billion dollars.</i>

460
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:39,802
Thirty billion.
So if you gave me 30 billion...

461
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,809
<i>and the time machine's 20--</i>

462
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:43,770
What's the minus
of 30 and 20?

463
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:46,486
Uh, it's, uh--
it's 80, Frito.

464
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:49,009
<i>It's $80 billion.</i>
<i>That's a mighty big minus, isn't it?</i>

465
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:52,694
- Yeah. I like money though.
- <i>Police! Open the door!</i>

466
00:30:52,796 --> 00:30:54,868
<i>We're looking for an "excaped" individual.</i>

467
00:30:54,972 --> 00:30:58,419
- <i>This particular individual's name is Not Sure.</i>
- Eighty billion.

468
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:02,353
Oh, um, he--
He's... somewhere else.

469
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,616
- You got something I can wear?
- Yeah. There's Pro-Wear on the top,
assorted in the middle.

470
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:08,755
<i>A Coke machine in the vicinity caught his tattoo.</i>

471
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,510
<i>Seemed to be heading</i>

472
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:13,914
<i>Okay, sir, we're comin' in.</i>

473
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:16,215
- No, you can't come in.
- <i>Can too!</i>

474
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:18,290
- Come on!
- All right, let's go get my billions.

475
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:24,402
Oh, okay, one more thing. We gotta go find
this girl, Rita, first, okay?

476
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,158
- Is she bangin'?
- Yeah, sure, she is.

477
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,082
That wasn't really
part of the deal.

478
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,922
- Okay, I'll, uh, throw in another
couple billion, all right?
- I like money.

479
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,954
Okay, her pod's up here on the right.
She shouldn't be far away, I hope.

480
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,632
<i>Mmm, girl. Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>So when we gonna do it?</i>

481
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:43,928
'Cause you been chargin' me by the hour,
and it's been, like, three days.

482
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:47,857
Oh, yeah. Soon, baby, soon.
Hey, you know what?

483
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:50,484
Why don't you
come back tomorrow?

484
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:53,108
- Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah!
- Yeah?

485
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,245
When I finally utilize you,
you gonna be paying me.

486
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,664
That's right.
Whatever you say, sir.

487
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,138
- Hey, you still on the clock!
- Yeah, girl.

488
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:05,236
- Thank you!
- Rita!

489
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:09,049
Rita! It's me, Joe, from the experiment.
Get in the car! Come on.

490
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:11,352
Oh, yeah!
What the hell, man?

491
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:13,274
Just get in the car.
I'll explain everything.

492
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:15,760
- Where we going?
- Just get in the car.

493
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:17,940
- Trust me.
- <i>What happened to those army guys?</i>

494
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:23,088
Wait a minute. You got cops after you?

495
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:26,676
- Yeah.
- And you made me get in the car?
I got two strikes, asshole!

496
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,147
Frito, take a right here.
Right, right!

497
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:31,131
<i>Into that dust storm,</i>
<i>Frito.</i>

498
00:32:37,052 --> 00:32:39,027
<i>They must have just forgotten about us.</i>

499
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:42,393
<i>It's been 500 years? Oh, hell, no!</i>

500
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:46,518
Upgrayedd is gonna kill me! He gets mad
when I'm a day late with his money!

501
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,627
So, you owe
your boyfriend money?

502
00:32:48,731 --> 00:32:51,120
Well, yeah,
he's sort of my manager too.

503
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:54,872
<i>You know, he helps me sell</i>
<i>the paintings and shit.</i>

504
00:32:54,972 --> 00:33:00,089
Look, Rita, you gotta understand that
Upgrayedd's been dead for a long time now.

505
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:02,871
- Yeah, man, but you said there
was a time machine, right?
- Yeah.

506
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:06,355
Yeah, there's a time machine
now that can take us back to the past...

507
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,762
but there was no
time machine back then, so--

508
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,674
Upgrayedd don't care where
the time machine is. Now, then, last week--

509
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:14,619
He will find a way
to come get his money!

510
00:33:14,715 --> 00:33:17,683
- All I'm saying is you don't have to worry about it--
- You know what?

511
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,242
<i>Last time you told me not to worry</i>
<i>was 500 goddamn years ago...</i>

512
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:22,617
when you were trying to tell me
to get into some coffin.

513
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:24,625
Look, Rita, I don't know
how this happened, okay?

514
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:27,896
But I'm doing everything I can
to get us back there, okay? I promise you.

515
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:31,410
<i>You are harboring</i>
<i>a fugitive by the name of Not Sure.</i>

516
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:34,996
Please, pull over and wait for the police
to incarcerate your passenger.

517
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,882
- Hell, no. You know what? Let me outta here.
- <i>Thank you for your help.</i>

518
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,119
If you don't have one of these,
they're gonna throw you in jail.

519
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:43,089
You don't want to get thrown in the jails here.
I've been in them.

520
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,813
They're bad. You're better off being with us,
as bad as that sounds.

521
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:49,745
- What are you doing? Why are we slowing down?
- Turned off my battery.

522
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:57,328
Look, how far is it?
Can we just take a cab or something?

523
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,230
Oh, shit.

524
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:12,372
Oh! Oh, shit!

525
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:14,614
Yeah!

526
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:17,880
<i>What the hell's wrong</i>
<i>with you? That's your car.</i>

527
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:22,614
<i>Oh, hell, yeah! He's on fire!</i>

528
00:34:22,715 --> 00:34:24,439
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

529
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,441
<i>Hey, how much farther is it?</i>

530
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,417
Uh, it's, like, far.

531
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:42,811
Man, I could really
go for a Starbucks, you know?

532
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:46,323
Yeah, well, I really don't think we have time
for a hand job, Joe.

533
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:54,737
<i>Man, he don't seem too bright.</i>
<i>You sure he knows where he's going?</i>

534
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,948
I sure hope so.
He's our only chance.

535
00:34:57,052 --> 00:35:00,434
How'd you hook up with this guy, anyway?

536
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,631
He's my lawyer.
And he's not a very good one either.

537
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:07,187
<i>He's a goddamned idiot.</i>

538
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:11,896
There's a shuttle down in the Costco.
It'll drop us right by the time machine.

539
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:32,981
Jesus Christ.
Oh, look. One more thing.

540
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:36,346
He thinks he's gonna get billions of dollars
if he takes us there.

541
00:35:36,443 --> 00:35:40,404
So if he mentions anything about
a savings account, just play along, okay?

542
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:42,330
Yeah, what if this
time machine don't work?

543
00:35:42,428 --> 00:35:45,592
Then I'll spend
the rest of my life trying to fix it.

544
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:55,474
Welcome to Costco. I love you.
Welcome to Costco. I love you.

545
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,808
Welcome to Costco.
I love you.

546
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:04,471
Shuttle's down there in electronics,
about an hour from here.

547
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:14,328
We've been walking forever.
You sure you know where you're going?

548
00:36:14,427 --> 00:36:17,776
Yeah, I know this place pretty good.
I went to law school here.

549
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,738
In Costco?

550
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:22,137
<i>Yeah. I couldn't</i>
<i>believe it myself.</i>

551
00:36:22,236 --> 00:36:25,749
<i>Luckily, my dad was an alumnus</i>
<i>and pulled some strings.</i>

552
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:29,815
<i>Hey, come on, Joe.</i>
<i>I already told you...</i>

553
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:32,883
<i>we'd all like a hand job,</i>
<i>but we don't have time for it.</i>

554
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:44,058
<i>Hey, baby, wanna go out?</i>

555
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:46,611
<i>Wanna go out, honey?</i>

556
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:55,572
Shuttle comes every few minutes.
Shouldn't be long.

557
00:36:55,676 --> 00:36:59,254
Do I got time to use the bathroom?

558
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:03,957
- <i>Uh, the toilet.</i>
- Be right back.

559
00:37:04,828 --> 00:37:07,195
Yeah,
back that thing up.

560
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,495
- Hey, you mind if I pound on that, Joe?
- What?

561
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,351
- I like having sex with chicks.
- Yeah?

562
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:13,274
- Yeah.
- I think everybody does, Frito.

563
00:37:13,372 --> 00:37:16,601
Not like I do. Like when you
get it like this, sideways.

564
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,121
Then you just, like,
back it up. And then you--

565
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:21,333
- <i>That's real good.</i>
- <i>Then you-- Oh, yeah!</i>

566
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:23,443
Stop! You're gonna
get us caught, okay?

567
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:25,369
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

568
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,889
<i>Costco has detected a dangerous</i>
<i>fugitive in aisle 16,702.</i>

569
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,330
Hey! What about Rita?
We can't just leave her here.

570
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:32,566
I don't care.
Come on!

571
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:36,858
Oh, shit. Wait a second. What are we gonna do?

572
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:38,810
Wait, okay, I know.
Here's what we do.

573
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:41,558
We go to the time machine,
then when I get back to the past...

574
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,514
I tell her not
to do the experiment.

575
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:45,716
- Then she won't even be here. That'll work, right?
- Uh--

576
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,707
- No, wait.
- <i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

577
00:37:47,803 --> 00:37:50,487
She already is here. That must mean
I didn't go back in time, right?

578
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:53,653
- Uh--
- No, wait, hold on. It just
means I haven't done it yet.

579
00:37:53,755 --> 00:37:56,439
Okay, so I go back and I tell
her not to do the experiment.

580
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:58,994
Then I won't have to do it either
because she won't be here.

581
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,402
- Then I won't have to
come back and save her, right?
- I--

582
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:04,052
- But then, wait. Why am I still here?
- Uh--

583
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,043
Goddamn, how does
this time travel work?

584
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:09,849
- <i>Please stand clear.</i>
- Freeze! Hands up! Don't move!

585
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:12,533
- Put your hands up!
- Don't move! Freeze!

586
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:25,202
Look, if you guys are
taking me back to that jail...

587
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,926
<i>just go ahead and shoot me,</i>
<i>'cause there's no way--</i>

588
00:38:28,027 --> 00:38:31,159
Ow! Fuck! Ow! Ow!

589
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:35,569
- What?
- Ow! Ow. Ow. Ow.

590
00:38:35,676 --> 00:38:37,531
<i>What?</i>

591
00:38:37,627 --> 00:38:39,766
- <i>Ow! God! Hey, stop!</i>
- Damn it.

592
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:45,173
- <i>What is this?</i>
- <i>Okay, sir, this is the White House.</i>

593
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:47,480
- <i>What are we doing at the White House?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

594
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,783
<i>Ow! Ow! Goddamn!</i>

595
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:53,200
<i>It turned out the results</i>
<i>of Joe's I.Q. test...</i>

596
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:57,236
<i>had caught the attention</i>
<i>of the highest levels of government.</i>

597
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,333
Okay, wait a minute. I'm the smartest guy
in the world? Says who?

598
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:03,443
The I.Q. test you
took in prison.

599
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:06,198
You got the highest score in history.
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

600
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,082
<i>Yeah, dumb ass, you're even smarter</i>
<i>than President Camacho.</i>

601
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,831
That's how come he's making
you secretary of interior.

602
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:13,819
Okay, so who are you?

603
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,574
I'm the secretary of energy.

604
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:18,228
He won a contest.
Got to be a cabinet member.

605
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:21,976
I'm the secretary of state.
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

606
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:25,206
- Why do you keep saying that?
- 'Cause they pay me every time I do.

607
00:39:25,307 --> 00:39:29,017
It's a really good way to make money.
You're so smart, why don't you know that?

608
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:33,170
- He's the secretary of defense.
- Hi.

609
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:36,123
And, uh, funbags over there
is the attorney general.

610
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,456
Hi.

611
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,628
And that's
the secretary of education.

612
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,849
<i>He's kinda stupid, but he's</i>
<i>President Camacho's stepbrother.</i>

613
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,086
<i>Still, he does</i>
<i>a pretty good job, eh?</i>

614
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:51,603
You know, I think there's been
some kind of mistake...

615
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:55,024
'cause the test I took
was real, real easy.

616
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:58,961
I'm not the smartest guy
in the world. Okay?

617
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,897
Okay, even if that were true,
I can't be the secretary of the interior.

618
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:10,320
- I don't even know what it is.
- <i>You better find out.</i>

619
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:13,177
- Sit down. It's President Camacho.
- Hey, hey, hey, yo...

620
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:17,072
<i>I gotta take care of some "bidness," baby,</i>
<i>so I need y'all to wait outside.</i>

621
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,914
<i>Dwayne Elizondo Camacho,</i>
<i>five-time Ultimate Smackdown Champion...</i>

<i>porn superstar, and president</i>

<i>had called a special summit</i>
<i>with the smartest man in the world.</i>

624
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:31,795
- So you smart, huh?
- No, no.

625
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,133
I thought your head would be bigger.

626
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:43,028
Goddamn.

627
00:40:43,131 --> 00:40:45,400
It look like a peanut.

628
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:47,354
Let's get you sworn in.

629
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:04,856
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president of America!</i>

630
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,683
<i>President Camacho!</i>

631
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:14,326
Shut up.

632
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:18,322
Shut up. Sit your monkey ass down.

633
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:19,922
Chill out.

634
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:25,369
Shit.

635
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,613
<i>I know shit's bad right now</i>
<i>with all that starvin' bullshit.</i>

636
00:41:30,715 --> 00:41:32,380
And the dust storms. And we runnin'
out of French fries and burrito coverings.

637
00:41:32,414 --> 00:41:35,097
And the dust storms. And we runnin'
out of French fries and burrito coverings.

638
00:41:35,196 --> 00:41:36,756
Yeah!

639
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,642
- But I got a solution.
- That's what you said last time, dipshit!

640
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,562
<i>I got a solution.</i>
<i>You're a dick!</i>

641
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,147
South Carolina, "whassup?"

642
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:54,390
That's what I thought!

643
00:41:57,084 --> 00:42:00,215
Now, I understand everyone's
shit's emotional right now...

644
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,737
but listen up.

645
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:05,495
I got a three-point plan
to fix everything.

646
00:42:05,595 --> 00:42:07,024
<i>Break it down, Camacho!</i>

647
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:12,118
Number one,
we got this guy, Not Sure.

648
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,856
- <i>Number two, he's got a higher</i>
<i>I.Q. than any man alive.</i>

649
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:21,079
<i>And number three, he's gonna fix everything.</i>

650
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,279
<i>I give you my word</i>
<i>as president.</i>

651
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:26,801
He'll fix the problems
with all the dead crops.

652
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:29,209
He's gonna
make 'em grow again.

653
00:42:29,308 --> 00:42:34,065
- Crops?
- <i>And that ain't all. I give you my word.</i>

654
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:38,994
He's gonna fix
the dust storms too.

655
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:43,155
I give you my word.

656
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,642
He's gonna
fix the "ecomony."

657
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:51,319
And he's so smart...

658
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:56,405
he's gonna do it all in one week.

659
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,922
<i>President Camacho stood before</i>
<i>the world and promised everyone...</i>

660
00:43:00,028 --> 00:43:03,475
<i>that Joe would solve</i>
<i>all their problems.</i>

661
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,573
<i>He would not only end the dust bowl</i>
<i>and heal the economy...</i>

662
00:43:07,675 --> 00:43:10,195
<i>but he would cure acne</i>
<i>and carsickness as well.</i>

663
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,471
<i>And if he didn't...</i>

664
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:14,961
<i>President Camacho</i>
<i>made another promise.</i>

665
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:18,548
<i>He would kick Joe's smart balls</i>
<i>all the way up to the roof of his smart mouth.</i>

666
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:22,645
- <i>And then, he would throw</i>
<i>his brainy ass back in jail.</i>

667
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,980
I should, uh, be honest
with you, Mr. President.

668
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,124
I don't know how to be
secretary of anything.

669
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:32,634
I mean, I've never
even voted, actually.

670
00:43:32,732 --> 00:43:35,415
I don't know what the secretary
of the interior even is.

671
00:43:35,515 --> 00:43:39,988
Come on, scrot. Don't be a pussy.
It beats jail, don't it?

672
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:44,248
Besides,
you do a kick-ass job...

673
00:43:44,348 --> 00:43:46,487
you get a full
presidential pardon.

674
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:48,409
- No jail time.
- Yeah?

675
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:51,988
Fuck, yeah!
Now gimme a beer.

676
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:54,066
<i>And get you one too.</i>

677
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,650
Shit!

678
00:44:01,755 --> 00:44:04,122
Hold on, <i>vato</i>!

679
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:05,877
<i>Whoo!</i>

680
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:27,668
- Do somethin' smart.
- Yeah.

681
00:44:28,987 --> 00:44:32,468
Uh, okay.
Uh--

682
00:44:32,571 --> 00:44:35,506
<i>I'll, uh--</i>

683
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:39,027
- Hey, we found that lawyer you wanted.
- Oh, okay. Great, thanks.

684
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:43,921
<i>Uh, right now, I'm going to, uh, you know,</i>
<i>confer with my counsel.</i>

685
00:44:44,027 --> 00:44:45,816
<i>You understand?</i>
<i>So I'll be right back.</i>

686
00:44:45,915 --> 00:44:49,145
Gotta go, uh, work on some crop stuff,
get that taken care of.

687
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:53,716
- Hopefully get it worked out
by the time we get back here.
- Sounds pretty smart.

688
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,707
Wait here, okay?
Wait there.

689
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:58,520
Dude, this is trepidatious.
You got me a room at the White House.

690
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,507
Everyone gets laid at the White House.
Everyone.

691
00:45:00,603 --> 00:45:02,163
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

692
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:05,562
I'm real glad you're happy to be here, Frito,
but I brought you here to help me.

693
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:08,212
<i>I don't know the first thing</i>
<i>about growin' crops...</i>

694
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:10,454
much less
the goddamn "ecomony."

695
00:45:10,555 --> 00:45:12,410
Econ-Economy.

696
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:15,322
Let's see.
Growin' crops--

697
00:45:15,419 --> 00:45:18,932
No, I just need you to tell me
how to get to the time machine.

698
00:45:19,036 --> 00:45:23,029
Oh, that's easy.
You go down by the museum and stuff.

699
00:45:23,132 --> 00:45:25,074
It's, like--
It's, like, by the museum...

700
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,667
sort of, but, well,
actually, not really.

701
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:32,114
More like-- But on the street. You go, um--
Wait. Let me start over.

702
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,008
Okay, you know
where the time machine is?

703
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,955
Hey. Just draw me
a map, okay?

704
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:39,572
You still want the money?

705
00:45:39,675 --> 00:45:42,392
Oh. If I had some money
and a room at the White House...

706
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:47,193
- I would be like, "It's mine, all night!"
- Listen. Cut it out!

707
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,975
Listen, I told these people
that you were smart, okay?

708
00:45:50,075 --> 00:45:52,214
- So act smart!
- Smart like you?

709
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,665
<i>"Oh, I gotta go</i>
<i>to the time machine. I wanna go home."</i>

710
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:58,455
- I don't talk like that.
- "I don't talk like that."

711
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,410
Shit, I thought
there was two of you.

712
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,231
See?

713
00:46:02,332 --> 00:46:04,787
<i>Doesn't look that big, is it?</i>

714
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:07,891
Okay. Let's go take a look
at those crops.

715
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:11,825
Especially the ones, uh, you know,
out around the museum area.

716
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,957
All right?
Hey, come on!

717
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:22,195
Now, you either lead, follow,
or get out of the way. All right?

718
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,496
Whoa.
Did you just make that up?

719
00:46:25,595 --> 00:46:28,410
Yes, I did.
Now look...

720
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:30,996
I also need help finding this girl named Rita,
like, immediately...

721
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:33,401
- and Frito will give you a hand with it.
- Why?

722
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:39,989
Well, because, uh, you know,
she'd be an essential... integral... asset...

723
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:44,696
<i>you know, for our team,</i>
<i>for us to, you know, utilize.</i>

724
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:53,850
Utilize her!
Utilize her!

725
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:55,955
<i>Utilize!</i>

726
00:46:56,059 --> 00:46:58,994
Hey, uh, but you're gonna bring her here, right?

727
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,685
Oh, yeah.
Butt first!

728
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:06,331
- <i>Utilize her!</i>
- Okay.

729
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,969
Dang! May I approach
your benches?

730
00:47:20,348 --> 00:47:22,868
Uh, yeah.
This sucks pretty bad.

731
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,689
<i>Frito, why don't you come over here and,</i>
<i>uh, take a look at this?</i>

732
00:47:25,788 --> 00:47:29,083
<i>Come on. Hustle over here, buddy.</i>
<i>I wanna figure this out.</i>

733
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,824
See, uh, just not a lot of moisture.
Have you got the map?

734
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:34,811
- Oh, yeah.
- Discreetly.

735
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:41,622
- It's right there.
- I see it. I see it.

736
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:44,179
<i>Stand up with me.</i>

737
00:47:44,284 --> 00:47:47,993
Yo, Mr. Secretary Not Sure.
They found that whore you wanted.

738
00:47:48,092 --> 00:47:50,961
Hey, that may be how you refer
to women in the future, but come on.

739
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:55,159
No, sir. Turns out she charged some guy
a lotta money and didn't put out.

740
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,169
<i>Don't worry though.</i>
<i>We'll get her out...</i>

741
00:47:57,276 --> 00:48:00,440
on a work-release whorin' license
as long as you're doin' her.

742
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:03,605
Get your hands off me. What do you think
I'm gonna do, run through the field?

743
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:05,944
What the fuck
are you all starin' at?

744
00:48:06,043 --> 00:48:07,985
- Joe?
- That's Not Sure, ma'am.

745
00:48:08,092 --> 00:48:11,834
- Secretary Not Sure.
- Secretary? Secretary of what?

746
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:16,340
Say, would you guys mind if we had
a little moment together? Alone?

747
00:48:16,443 --> 00:48:20,666
<i>You know,</i>
<i>in the bushes?</i>

748
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,186
Oh, man.

749
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:35,826
- Fuck her, Joe!
- Hey, you want us to come along,
make sure she puts out?

750
00:48:35,932 --> 00:48:37,874
No, thanks.
I can handle it. Yeah.

751
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:41,078
I thought you was in jail.
How'd you get to be the secretary of interior?

752
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,384
Just keep walking.
I'll explain everything.

753
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,691
Okay.
Get ready to run.

754
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:58,580
- <i>What?</i>
- Oh, goddamn it.

755
00:48:58,683 --> 00:49:01,367
Way to go, Frito. You know what?
Just make a run for it anyways.

756
00:49:01,467 --> 00:49:03,322
We'll ask for directions
on the way.

757
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,453
No way. I spent the last two days
looking for it. It ain't easy to find.

758
00:49:06,556 --> 00:49:09,403
Damn it. I can't go back to jail,
and I sure can't solve these problems.

759
00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:12,499
All's I know is I better find Upgrayedd
before he finds me.

760
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:15,833
Listen to me. Upgrayedd
cannot find you, okay? It's impossible!

761
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:18,550
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah! And even if Upgrayedd...

762
00:49:18,651 --> 00:49:20,561
could somehow magically
travel through time...

763
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,962
we got secret service guys with huge guns
protecting us, okay?

764
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:25,882
So don't worry.
You're safe.

765
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:29,013
And you know what? It's none of my business,
but when we get back...

766
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:31,636
you and Upgrayedd should seriously think
about couples counseling, okay?

767
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:35,995
And you should also think about maybe finding
an art manager who's not also your boyfriend.

768
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:40,020
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>She's not puttin' out?</i>

769
00:49:40,123 --> 00:49:44,084
Uh, no, she is.
We, uh-We already did it.

770
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:46,577
<i>Yeah. He was great.</i>

771
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,213
Okay. Hey, a couple of us guys
were wonderin', uh...

772
00:49:52,316 --> 00:49:54,203
if we'd go family-style
on her.

773
00:49:56,635 --> 00:49:59,951
Uh, yeah,
probably not right now.

774
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,376
<i>We should focus on the crops.</i>
<i>So let's get back to work. Maybe later.</i>

775
00:50:10,204 --> 00:50:11,829
What the hell is this?

776
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,330
- Tastes like Gatorade.
- <i>Is that that Brawndo stuff?</i>

777
00:50:18,427 --> 00:50:22,006
<i>They're watering crops</i>
<i>with a sports drink?</i>

778
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:26,230
<i>Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator</i>
<i>had come to replace water...</i>

779
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:28,404
<i>virtually everywhere.</i>

780
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:30,613
<i>Water, the basic component</i>
<i>of all life...</i>

781
00:50:30,716 --> 00:50:33,585
<i>had been deemed a threat</i>
<i>to Brawndo's profit margin.</i>

782
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:37,040
<i>The solution came during</i>
<i>the budget crisis of 2330...</i>

783
00:50:37,148 --> 00:50:41,785
<i>when the Brawndo Corporation</i>
<i>simply bought the F.D.A...</i>

784
00:50:41,884 --> 00:50:43,291
<i>and the F.C.C...</i>

785
00:50:43,387 --> 00:50:45,526
<i>enabling them to say,</i>
<i>do and sell...</i>

786
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:47,450
<i>anything they wanted.</i>

787
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,804
<i>Joe didn't know</i>
<i>any of this...</i>

788
00:50:54,907 --> 00:50:58,737
<i>but he did see a problem</i>
<i>that he might actually be able to solve.</i>

789
00:50:58,843 --> 00:51:03,218
- <i>With his options running out,</i>
<i>Joe took a bold step.</i>

790
00:51:03,324 --> 00:51:05,364
<i>He would not</i>
<i>get out of the way.</i>

791
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:08,217
<i>This time, he would lead.</i>

792
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,258
For the last time,
I'm pretty sure...

793
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:13,211
what's killing the crops
is this Brawndo stuff.

794
00:51:13,308 --> 00:51:15,958
But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
It's got electrolytes.

795
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,035
<i>So wait a minute.</i>
<i>What you're saying...</i>

796
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:21,784
is that you want us
to put water on the crops.

797
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:24,785
- Yes.
- Water. Like out the toilet?

798
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:28,721
Well, I mean, it doesn't have to be
out of the toilet, but, yeah, that's the idea.

799
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:32,024
- But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
- It's got electrolytes.

800
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:34,011
Okay, look.

801
00:51:34,107 --> 00:51:37,456
The plants aren't growing, so I'm pretty sure
that the Brawndo's not working.

802
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:42,037
Now, I'm no botanist, but I do know
that if you put water on plants, they grow.

803
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:45,685
Well, I've never seen no plants
grow out of no toilet.

804
00:51:45,787 --> 00:51:48,919
Hey, that's good. You sure you ain't
the smartest guy in the world?

805
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:52,816
- You wanna solve this problem.
I wanna get my pardon.

806
00:51:52,924 --> 00:51:56,720
So why don't we just try it, okay,
and not worry about what plants crave?

807
00:51:56,828 --> 00:51:59,195
Brawndo's got
what plants crave.

808
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:01,713
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, it's got electrolytes.

809
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,154
What are electrolytes?
Do you even know?

810
00:52:04,252 --> 00:52:06,903
It's what they use
to make Brawndo.

811
00:52:07,003 --> 00:52:09,524
Yeah, but why do they
use them to make Brawndo?

812
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,082
'Cause Brawndo's
got electrolytes.

813
00:52:14,972 --> 00:52:19,227
<i>After several hours,</i>
<i>Joe finally gave up on logic and reason...</i>

814
00:52:19,323 --> 00:52:22,258
<i>and simply told the cabinet</i>
<i>that he could talk to plants...</i>

815
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:24,884
<i>and that they wanted water.</i>

816
00:52:25,947 --> 00:52:28,184
<i>He made believers</i>
<i>out of everyone.</i>

817
00:52:28,283 --> 00:52:31,699
<i>Joe didn't know it,</i>
<i>but the beloved electrolytes...</i>

818
00:52:31,803 --> 00:52:35,600
<i>were salts that had been</i>
<i>building up in the topsoil over the decades...</i>

819
00:52:35,707 --> 00:52:38,326
<i>killing plants</i>
<i>and leading to the dust bowl.</i>

820
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:43,926
<i>As secretary of the interior,</i>
<i>Joe ordered all crops to be switched to water...</i>

821
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:48,948
<i>promising that, over time, plants would grow</i>
<i>and the dust bowl would end.</i>

822
00:52:49,051 --> 00:52:52,914
<i>He was on the fast track</i>
<i>to a full presidential pardon.</i>

823
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,020
<i>Or so it seemed.</i>

824
00:52:57,083 --> 00:53:00,826
Man, I hope somethin'
grows fast.

825
00:53:00,923 --> 00:53:02,833
Yeah. So we can haul
our ass back home.

826
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:06,387
Man. You really think those people
would have starved to death?

827
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:12,308
I don't know. I mean, how did the world
ever get like this?

828
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:16,121
You know things are bad
when they're comin' to me for answers.

829
00:53:16,219 --> 00:53:18,870
- It's a weird feeling being smarter than everyone.
- Mm-hmm.

830
00:53:18,972 --> 00:53:21,110
- I'm not used to it.
- Yeah. Me neither.

831
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,318
You think Einstein walked around thinkin'
everyone was a bunch of dumb shits?

832
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,875
Yeah.
Hadn't thought of that.

833
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,940
- Now you know why he built that bomb.
- Yeah.

834
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:38,357
Hey, Joe, listen.
Those cops--

835
00:53:38,459 --> 00:53:40,631
- Oh, hey. I'm sorry about that.
- <i>No. No.</i>

836
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:43,633
They said that
you got me a pardon.

837
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,642
You know, if you hadn't done that,
I'd still be in jail right now, so...

838
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:50,420
I guess I owe you one.

839
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,955
You know, you don't have to sleep
on the floor if you don't want to.

840
00:53:57,307 --> 00:54:01,301
Oh. No. I'm--
I'm all right. Yeah.

841
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:05,298
Besides, you know, I don't think Upgrayedd
would be too happy about that.

842
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:06,997
You in bed with a stranger.

843
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:10,839
Yeah.

844
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,383
I know. I know.

845
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:22,193
<i>Yeah. Oh, boy.</i>

846
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,275
Oh, shit.
It's Upgrayedd.

847
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,714
<i>Oh, shit. It's not Upgrayedd.</i>

848
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:37,016
<i>Given enough time,</i>
<i>Joe's plan might have worked.</i>

849
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:39,352
<i>But when the Brawndo stock</i>
<i>suddenly dropped to zero...</i>

850
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:41,786
<i>leaving half the population</i>
<i>unemployed...</i>

851
00:54:41,884 --> 00:54:45,429
<i>dumb, angry mobs took to the streets,</i>
<i>rioting and looting...</i>

852
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,387
<i>and screaming</i>
<i>for Joe's head.</i>

853
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:50,069
<i>An emergency cabinet meeting</i>
<i>was called...</i>

854
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:52,408
<i>with the C.E.O.</i>
<i>of the Brawndo Corporation.</i>

855
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:54,875
How come nobody's buying
Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator?

856
00:54:54,972 --> 00:54:57,241
Aw, shit. Half the country
works for Brawndo.

857
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,990
<i>Not anymore!</i>
<i>The stock has dropped to zero...</i>

858
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:02,164
<i>and the computer did</i>
<i>that auto-layoff thing to everybody.</i>

859
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:04,722
- We're all unemployed!
- You think that makes the "ecomony" suck?

860
00:55:04,828 --> 00:55:08,722
- Why is this happening?
- I think it's because we switched to water, but--

861
00:55:08,828 --> 00:55:11,217
- You mean this is all your fault?
- What?

862
00:55:11,323 --> 00:55:15,000
Yeah, this is your fault. This shit started
happening when we switched to water!

863
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,842
Brought to you by Carl's Jr. Brought to you
by Carl's Jr. Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

864
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:23,190
<i>Fox News.</i>

865
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,234
He tried taking water
from toilets...

866
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,115
but it's Secretary Not Sure
who finds himself in the toilet now.

867
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:35,034
And as history
pulls down its pants...

868
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:38,263
and prepares to lower its ass
on Not Sure's head...

869
00:55:38,363 --> 00:55:42,193
it will be Daddy Justice
who will be crapping on him this time.

870
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:46,325
We now go live to Violence Channel
correspondent Formica Davis...

871
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:50,137
at the Extreme Court
with highlights on today's trial.

872
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,566
Thank you, Velveeta.
Well, it started off boring and slow...

873
00:55:56,668 --> 00:56:00,083
with Not Sure trying to bullshit everyone
with a bunch of smart talk.

874
00:56:00,187 --> 00:56:04,116
<i>Blah, blah, blah. You gotta believe me!</i>

875
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:06,129
<i>That part of the trial sucked.</i>

876
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:08,788
<i>But then, the chief "J"</i>
<i>just went off.</i>

877
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:10,834
<i>He said, "Man, whatever.</i>

878
00:56:10,939 --> 00:56:13,427
<i>The guy's guilty as shit.</i>
<i>We all know that."</i>

879
00:56:13,531 --> 00:56:17,143
<i>And he sentenced his ass</i>
<i>to one night of</i> Rehabilitation.

880
00:56:17,244 --> 00:56:19,699
Hey, rehabilitation?
One night?

881
00:56:19,804 --> 00:56:21,626
Doesn't sound so bad.

882
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:23,512
Not so bad, huh?

883
00:56:23,612 --> 00:56:26,743
Here's some highlights
from last week's <i>Rehabilitation</i>.

884
00:56:37,275 --> 00:56:40,243
<i>And who could forget that wonderful finish...</i>

885
00:56:40,347 --> 00:56:42,736
<i>by Rehab Officer Tylenol Jones?</i>

886
00:56:42,844 --> 00:56:46,389
And tomorrow night looks even more better.

887
00:56:46,492 --> 00:56:50,714
Word is that Beef Supreme himself
might come out of retirement.

888
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:53,397
Wow. Thank you, Formica.

889
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:57,681
So you think you can escape again
like you did last time?

890
00:56:57,787 --> 00:57:00,471
- No. They pretty much fixed that.
- How?

891
00:57:00,571 --> 00:57:02,743
They chained me
to a big rock.

892
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:05,913
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Yeah.

893
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:08,116
Look, Rita, get Frito.

894
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,220
Get him to take you back to the time machine
without me. Don't wait.

895
00:57:11,323 --> 00:57:15,185
No. You could have split on me before,
but you didn't.

896
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:18,554
Look, you wanna pay me back?
Just go back, okay?

897
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:21,106
Tell people to read books.

898
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:23,219
Tell people to stay in school,
you know.

899
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:26,706
Tell people to just
use their brains or something.

900
00:57:26,812 --> 00:57:29,878
<i>I think maybe the world got like this</i>
<i>because of people like me.</i>

901
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,387
I never did anything with my life.
At least you were an artist, you know?

902
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,947
- <i>So just go back and--</i>
- <i>Visit's over!</i>

903
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:43,120
And Rita, whatever you do,
keep painting, okay?

904
00:57:44,604 --> 00:57:46,491
Good luck, Joe.

905
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:56,153
<i>Okay, that's five down and one more to go.</i>

906
00:57:56,251 --> 00:57:59,797
<i>Are you ready for a monster-truck duel</i>
<i>to the death?</i>

907
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,282
<i>Yeah! Let's give it up</i>
<i>for the Guitar Army.</i>

908
00:58:05,308 --> 00:58:07,195
<i>Okay, we're gonna do this shit.</i>

909
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:10,325
<i>But first, to lead us</i>
<i>in our Natural Anthem...</i>

910
00:58:10,427 --> 00:58:14,999
<i>the star of</i> Ow! My Balls!
<i>Hormel Chavez!</i>

911
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,914
Thank you. Thank you.

912
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:22,801
<i>Hey! Come here!</i>

913
00:58:22,907 --> 00:58:26,322
Come here!

914
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:28,250
<i>Right in the balls!</i>

915
00:58:28,348 --> 00:58:32,952
That's just how that shit went on TV!

916
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:37,110
This execution is brought to you
by Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator.

917
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:39,033
<i>After you've killed someone...</i>

918
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:40,986
- <i>your body needs electrolytes.</i>
- Yeah.

919
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:44,248
So, my car's out front...

920
00:58:44,347 --> 00:58:46,519
whenever you want me
to take you...

921
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:48,758
to the time machine.

922
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,714
Thanks, Frito.

923
00:58:50,811 --> 00:58:52,819
- Yeah.
- <i>I can't hear you!</i>

924
00:58:52,923 --> 00:58:55,989
That's a real bummer
about Joe, huh?

925
00:58:56,092 --> 00:58:58,580
- <i>I can't hear you!</i>
- Yeah.

926
00:58:58,683 --> 00:59:03,920
<i>Oh! Can you turn this up?</i>
<i>I love</i> Rehabilitation.

927
00:59:14,971 --> 00:59:19,249
<i>Okay. Let's meet</i>
<i>our rehabilitation officers for tonight.</i>

928
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,519
<i>With a combined record</i>
<i>of 62 kills...</i>

929
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:27,257
<i>please welcome Vinny Mawumba</i>
<i>in the Dildozer!</i>

930
00:59:32,828 --> 00:59:38,360
<i>And his brother Bobby Mawumba</i>
<i>in the Ass Blaster!</i>

931
00:59:38,459 --> 00:59:40,347
I get a truck too, right?

932
00:59:40,444 --> 00:59:43,062
Yeah.
Here it comes.

933
00:59:52,316 --> 00:59:54,203
Get in.

934
00:59:58,523 --> 01:00:00,793
You still got
the chain attached.

935
01:00:02,907 --> 01:00:05,362
- <i>Door won't shut.</i>
- What about the chain?

936
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,355
- We could break it.
- No. He could escape.

937
01:00:07,451 --> 01:00:10,866
- I got an idea. Let's put it in the trunk.
- Yeah. That'll work.

938
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,715
- <i>Who's smart now?</i>
- <i>Let's bring out our criminal.</i>

939
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:20,819
<i>He tried to ruin the country</i>
<i>by pouring toilet water on crops.</i>

940
01:00:20,924 --> 01:00:23,225
<i>He cost millions of people</i>
<i>their jobs.</i>

941
01:00:23,323 --> 01:00:26,520
<i>Let's get ready</i>
<i>to rehabilitate Not Sure!</i>

942
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:40,313
Never would have guessed
this is how I was gonna die.

943
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:43,194
<i>Are you ready for some car-on-car action?</i>

944
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:45,179
Yes.

945
01:00:46,236 --> 01:00:48,953
- I can't watch this.
- This is--

946
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:53,361
<i>This is gonna be so sad.</i>
<i>I hope I don't cry.</i>

947
01:00:55,099 --> 01:00:58,841
Holy shit!
Frito, come here! Look!

948
01:00:58,939 --> 01:01:01,306
He was right.
The water-- it worked.

949
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,924
Frito, can you
get me over there?

950
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:06,682
Yes.

951
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:09,649
No, you fuckin' moron.
To the <i>Rehabilitation</i> place.

952
01:01:09,755 --> 01:01:11,697
- Uh, this way.
- Yeah!

953
01:01:16,092 --> 01:01:17,914
Come on, Frito.
Hurry!

954
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:20,914
<i>And now the dude that</i>
<i>everybody came here to see...</i>

955
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:24,467
- Yeah!
- <i>the only undefeated officer ever in history...</i>

956
01:01:24,571 --> 01:01:27,954
<i>coming out of retirement</i>
<i>just to pound Not Sure's ass...</i>

957
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,816
<i>driving the biggest, hugest correctional</i>
<i>vehicle ever built in history--</i>

958
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:36,633
<i>bigger than the Dildozer,</i>
<i>bigger than the Ass Blaster...</i>

959
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:40,593
<i>bigger and huger than everything</i>
<i>ever before in history--</i>

960
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,514
<i>the brand-new Assdozer!</i>

961
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:46,197
<i>Give it up for Beef Supreme!</i>

962
01:01:49,627 --> 01:01:51,450
Oh!

963
01:01:57,211 --> 01:01:59,066
Oh!

964
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:15,990
<i>Oh, shit. I think it was too big, huh?</i>

965
01:02:16,091 --> 01:02:18,480
<i>We seem to be</i>
<i>"experimenting"...</i>

966
01:02:18,588 --> 01:02:21,751
<i>some "techmological"</i>
<i>differences...</i>

967
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:23,673
<i>so, uh, shit.</i>

968
01:02:23,771 --> 01:02:27,000
Frito, look!

969
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,205
- It's working everywhere!
- Huh.

970
01:02:29,308 --> 01:02:33,202
<i>Well, shit. That's a big pile of rocks.</i>

971
01:02:33,308 --> 01:02:36,308
- <i>Kinda reminds me of this one time that I was--</i>
- Man.

972
01:02:36,411 --> 01:02:38,353
- Hey!
- <i>Oh, oh, okay.</i>

973
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,565
- Get this shit started!
- <i>We're gonna start without Beef Supreme.</i>

974
01:02:40,668 --> 01:02:44,246
<i>Let the rehabilitation begin!</i>

975
01:02:53,404 --> 01:02:55,859
Oh, shit.

976
01:02:55,963 --> 01:02:58,745
Come on. Come on.

977
01:02:58,843 --> 01:03:01,210
<i>Come on, Frito. Hurry!</i>

978
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,325
Oh!

979
01:03:10,844 --> 01:03:12,305
Goddamn it.

980
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:18,329
- Yeah!
- Jesus, that was close.

981
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:23,514
Mr. President! Mr. President,
I need to talk to you.

982
01:03:23,611 --> 01:03:25,717
<i>You gotta stop this thing.</i>
<i>He was right about the water.</i>

983
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:28,601
<i>We passed some crops</i>
<i>on the way here. They're growing.</i>

984
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:30,521
I didn't see no crops.

985
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:33,237
<i>They're circling around.</i>

986
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,762
<i>They're gonna do</i>
<i>the Malachi Crunch on him!</i>

987
01:03:38,299 --> 01:03:41,561
- <i>This is an illegal move, okay? So don't tell nobody.</i>
- Oh!

988
01:04:01,532 --> 01:04:04,401
<i>So, uh-So the winner is, uh--</i>

989
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:09,205
- <i>You gotta be shittin' me.</i>
- Did he win?

990
01:04:11,963 --> 01:04:14,069
Uh-oh. Look.

991
01:04:15,868 --> 01:04:19,446
<i>Holy shit! It's Beef Supreme!</i>

992
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:28,183
<i>Beef Supreme! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

993
01:04:28,283 --> 01:04:32,375
Hey, Frito. Frito, you remember
those crops we saw off the road...

994
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:34,996
- right by the Starbucks?
- Uh-huh.

995
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:39,028
- Hey. Wanna make some money?
- I like money.

996
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:56,791
Hey, um, the, uh-- the main
screen is malfunctioning...

997
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:59,313
and they gonna need you
outside immediately.

998
01:05:02,396 --> 01:05:05,298
There's a bunch of whores
in the hallway.

999
01:05:08,347 --> 01:05:10,736
Come on, Frito.
Hurry.

1000
01:05:11,771 --> 01:05:13,778
Can't believe
you like money too.

1001
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:16,273
- We should hang out.
- Totally.

1002
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:42,513
<i>He's behind the truck!</i>

1003
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,190
Yes! Yes!

1004
01:05:48,507 --> 01:05:50,482
- He's behind the fucking truck!
- He's over there!

1005
01:05:50,587 --> 01:05:52,562
<i>Behind the truck, stupid!</i>

1006
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,986
Look!

1007
01:06:06,108 --> 01:06:09,523
Shit.
That's a good deal.

1008
01:06:09,627 --> 01:06:13,937
- <i>Extra foam.</i>
- I got a bunch of money too.

1009
01:06:14,044 --> 01:06:16,564
- Forgot what it was for.
- Huh.

1010
01:06:17,788 --> 01:06:21,432
- You think it was for lattes?
- Yeah. Probably.

1011
01:06:21,532 --> 01:06:25,623
- <i>You like money and sex?</i>
<i>You're trippin' me out.</i>
- What the fuck?

1012
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:29,910
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1013
01:06:39,164 --> 01:06:42,873
- Just hold on, okay?
Everyone just take it easy, okay?

1014
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,793
Can I just
say something here?

1015
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,915
I don't even know
what I'm guilty of here.

1016
01:06:50,011 --> 01:06:53,754
I never said that I was the smartest person
on earth. You people did.

1017
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:57,364
I didn't know that you'd lose your jobs
and all your money...

1018
01:06:57,467 --> 01:06:59,507
and I'm very sorry
that that happened.

1019
01:06:59,611 --> 01:07:01,554
<i>But I'm tellin' you...</i>

1020
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,929
if you put water on the crops,
it might actually--

1021
01:07:04,028 --> 01:07:06,897
No, it will work.
I promise you!

1022
01:07:07,004 --> 01:07:11,226
<i>You just have to believe me.</i>
<i>I just wanted to help you. That's all.</i>

1023
01:07:11,323 --> 01:07:15,960
<i>So you can try and shoot me.</i>
<i>You can try and run me over, whatever.</i>

1024
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,376
But I just want you to ask yourselves
one question first.

1025
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,961
Do you really want to live
in a world...

1026
01:07:23,068 --> 01:07:26,417
where you try to blow up the one person
that's tryin' to help you?

1027
01:07:36,827 --> 01:07:38,966
Hold on. Just hold on.

1028
01:07:59,483 --> 01:08:01,589
Oh, man.
That was great.

1029
01:08:01,691 --> 01:08:05,204
Hey, was I wearing pants
when we went in there?

1030
01:08:05,308 --> 01:08:08,569
Shit. What do I look like,
a pants goblin?

1031
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,864
Wait.
This reminds me of something.

1032
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:14,713
<i>Uh, "Rehabil-Rehabilate--</i>

1033
01:08:14,812 --> 01:08:17,878
- Rehabilation."
- Why do you keep trying to read that word?

1034
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:21,362
- You a fag?
- I'll fag your face!

1035
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,562
- Come on, Frito.
- Yeah. I don't think so.

1036
01:08:33,883 --> 01:08:36,250
Oh, yeah.

1037
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:20,337
This guy just got
his ass a pardon!

1038
01:09:28,028 --> 01:09:29,719
Yeah!

1039
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,715
Man, Rita. I mean,
I don't know what to say.

1040
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:49,943
You saved my life.
No one's ever done anything like that for me.

1041
01:09:50,044 --> 01:09:51,866
Yeah, well...

1042
01:09:51,964 --> 01:09:54,866
you were looking out for the whole world so,
you know...

1043
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:58,517
- I thought someone should look out for you too.
- Thanks.

1044
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,329
I can't believe I'm even
saying this, but...

1045
01:10:02,428 --> 01:10:04,337
<i>even though these people</i>
<i>tried to kill me...</i>

1046
01:10:04,444 --> 01:10:07,760
- you know, I think I'm actually gonna
kinda miss 'em.
- Yeah.

1047
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:10,584
Frito-- he's gonna give us
a ride back to the time machine.

1048
01:10:10,683 --> 01:10:13,782
I just, uh--
I hope he's okay to drive.

1049
01:10:15,164 --> 01:10:18,164
It's you. Oh, man,
I really love your show.

1050
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:20,471
Thank you so much.

1051
01:10:20,572 --> 01:10:25,525
- <i>Uh, Joe, I'm not going.</i>
- What?

1052
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:30,969
I had some pretty bad habits back there
that I don't want to fall into again.

1053
01:10:31,068 --> 01:10:32,955
Maybe it's time
I got a new start.

1054
01:10:33,052 --> 01:10:37,013
<i>Besides, they offered me</i>
<i>a pretty good job at Starbucks here.</i>

1055
01:10:37,115 --> 01:10:39,668
- I'm gonna be a C.E.O.
- At Starbucks?

1056
01:10:39,772 --> 01:10:42,489
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You're still gonna paint though, right?

1057
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:47,353
Yeah. Sure.

1058
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:49,208
I guess this is
good-bye then.

1059
01:10:51,003 --> 01:10:53,142
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

1060
01:10:53,243 --> 01:10:55,611
I got a couple
presidential decrees to make!

1061
01:10:55,645 --> 01:10:57,237
I got a couple
presidential decrees to make!

1062
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:01,398
Not Sure, get your ass up here,
wherever you is.

1063
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:06,038
Let me get that little
peanut head up here.

1064
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,790
Yo. Yo.

1065
01:11:08,891 --> 01:11:10,746
I have decided...

1066
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:13,265
to make this man--

1067
01:11:13,372 --> 01:11:16,187
the man who solved
all our problems--

1068
01:11:17,468 --> 01:11:20,021
<i>I have decided to make him...</i>

1069
01:11:20,123 --> 01:11:22,327
my new vice president.

1070
01:11:24,763 --> 01:11:27,862
Mr. President, thanks.
That's real cool of you, sir...

1071
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:31,673
- but I can't accept it, sir.
- What? Why?

1072
01:11:31,772 --> 01:11:36,311
- You know, I gotta get home.
- But we still got all these problems.

1073
01:11:36,412 --> 01:11:39,281
Look, you know, you're just gonna
have to solve 'em yourselves.

1074
01:11:39,388 --> 01:11:41,755
- How?
- Think about it, you know?

1075
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:44,786
You're just gonna have to figure it out
like we did with the crops.

1076
01:11:44,892 --> 01:11:49,234
<i>But how are we gonna figure out about</i>
<i>the garbage "ambulanches" and the "comony"?</i>

1077
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:54,937
<i>And what about the nuc--</i>
<i>"nucular" reactor in Florida?</i>

1078
01:11:55,035 --> 01:11:57,402
It's broke and leaky
and something's happening.

1079
01:11:57,499 --> 01:12:02,649
- I thought it was in Georgia.
- Georgia's in Florida, dumb ass.

1080
01:12:02,747 --> 01:12:05,682
Hey. Hey, I know.
Let's put toilet water on it. Huh?

1081
01:12:05,787 --> 01:12:08,722
- Yeah!
- Good, good. That's a good idea.

1082
01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:11,413
- <i>Like we did on the crops.</i>
- Come on, <i>vato.</i>

1083
01:12:11,516 --> 01:12:13,719
Hey, you can't leave.

1084
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:19,515
Whatever happened to all that "lead, follow,
or get outta the way" shit, huh?

1085
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:34,074
I guess I just can't get outta the way anymore,
can I? You know what?

1086
01:12:34,172 --> 01:12:36,954
- Forget about the time machine.
- Yeah!

1087
01:12:40,828 --> 01:12:44,089
That ride sucks anyways.

1088
01:12:44,187 --> 01:12:46,227
Ride?

1089
01:12:49,564 --> 01:12:51,931
<i>Welcome to the Time Masheen.</i>

1090
01:12:52,027 --> 01:12:56,337
<i>We are going to take you back,</i>
<i>first to the year 1939...</i>

1091
01:12:56,444 --> 01:12:58,833
<i>when Charlie Chaplin</i>
<i>and his evil Nazi regime...</i>

1092
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:01,874
<i>enslaved Europe and tried</i>
<i>to take over the world.</i>

1093
01:13:01,979 --> 01:13:04,467
<i>So you knew this thing</i>
<i>was just a ride the whole time?</i>

1094
01:13:04,572 --> 01:13:07,921
Yeah. You thought you could really
travel through time, huh?

1095
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:10,296
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- Yeah.

1096
01:13:10,396 --> 01:13:13,211
For the smartest guy in the world,
you're pretty dumb sometimes.

1097
01:13:13,308 --> 01:13:18,010
- So why didn't you tell us?
- 'Cause I like money. I'm sorry.

1098
01:13:18,108 --> 01:13:21,752
But if it's not a real time machine,
there wouldn't have been any money.

1099
01:13:21,852 --> 01:13:25,201
You know, 'cause I can't go back in time
and open a savings account.

1100
01:13:25,307 --> 01:13:28,122
Uh, uh, uh--

1101
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,870
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

1102
01:13:32,347 --> 01:13:34,202
Well,
I guess we're stuck here.

1103
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:39,188
<i>But then an even</i>
<i>greater force emerged-- the "UN."</i>

1104
01:13:39,292 --> 01:13:43,163
<i>And the "UN"</i>
<i>un-nazied the world forever.</i>

1105
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:43,414
<i>And the "UN"</i>
<i>un-nazied the world forever.</i>

1106
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:46,929
<i>And so, after serving a short</i>
<i>term as vice president...</i>

1107
01:13:47,035 --> 01:13:50,199
<i>Joe was elected</i>
<i>the president of America.</i>

1108
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,372
<i>Frito became vice president...</i>

1109
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:55,509
<i>and Rita, the former prostitute,</i>
<i>became first lady.</i>

1110
01:13:55,612 --> 01:13:58,961
Today I step into the shoes
of a great man...

1111
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:03,028
a man by the name
of Dwayne Elizondo...

1112
01:14:03,132 --> 01:14:06,961
Mountain Dew
Herbert Camacho.

1113
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:11,028
<i>Under President Not Sure's</i>
<i>leadership, a new era dawned.</i>

1114
01:14:11,132 --> 01:14:14,809
You know, there was a time
in this country...

1115
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:18,999
when smart people
were considered cool.

1116
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,914
Well, maybe not cool,
but smart people did things...

1117
01:14:22,011 --> 01:14:25,906
like build ships and pyramids,
and they even went to the moon.

1118
01:14:26,011 --> 01:14:27,473
Yeah!

1119
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:33,557
And there was a time
in this country, a long time ago...

1120
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,962
when reading wasn't
just for fags...

1121
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:38,231
<i>and neither was writing.</i>

1122
01:14:38,331 --> 01:14:42,260
<i>People wrote books and movies,</i>
<i>movies that had stories...</i>

1123
01:14:42,363 --> 01:14:46,487
so you cared whose ass it was
and why it was farting.

1124
01:14:46,588 --> 01:14:49,904
And I believe that time
can come again!

1125
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:04,787
Not Sure, Not Sure, Not Sure!

1126
01:15:08,476 --> 01:15:10,363
<i>Joe and Rita had three children...</i>

1127
01:15:10,459 --> 01:15:13,143
<i>the three smartest kids</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

1128
01:15:14,236 --> 01:15:16,625
<i>Vice President Frito</i>
<i>took eight wives...</i>

1129
01:15:16,731 --> 01:15:19,066
<i>and had a total of 32 kids--</i>

1130
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:22,262
<i>thirty-two of the dumbest kids</i>
<i>ever to walk the earth.</i>

1131
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:30,325
<i>Okay, so maybe Joe</i>
<i>didn't save mankind...</i>

1132
01:15:30,427 --> 01:15:32,762
<i>but he got the ball rolling...</i>

1133
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:36,504
<i>and that's pretty good</i>
<i>for an average guy.</i>

1134
01:20:24,123 --> 01:20:26,709
I'm gonna go find this ho.
