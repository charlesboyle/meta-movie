East Berlin,

Whatever happened to us,

709
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,748
it seemed to me
we would be free.

Aren't you tired of lying?

712
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,639
If you had found him, isn't
that what you would have done?

713
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:21,730
Maybe.

714
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,026
Twenty years ago.

715
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:26,531
But now?

716
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:30,702
Anyway, it isn't
just us, there's Sarah.

717
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,663
She hasn't done
anything wrong.

718
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:37,034
She wrote a book.
Did you know that?

719
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,289
Yes.

720
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:41,831
If the truth were to come out
now, it would destroy her.

721
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:47,799
So no. I would not
have told the truth.

722
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,552
But you never found him.

723
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,432
No, I never did.

724
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,613
The book launch
is tomorrow.

725
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,442
Could you come?
I don't know if Stephan...

726
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:12,656
What if we could go back?

727
01:32:13,737 --> 01:32:17,287
If I had waited for you.
If you had come.

728
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,119
Would it be different?

729
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,830
We can't go back.

It isn't him.

who's heard about him.

afraid the story might come out.

746
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:40,100
When he came to see me,
he was asking for something.

What?

748
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,321
My permission.

749
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,067
And I didn't give it.

750

tell the truth,
