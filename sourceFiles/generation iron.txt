1
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,599
I'm fragile.

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,119
I feel pain, I hurt.

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,065
I open my eyes.

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,719
I create.

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,039
I conquer.

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,559
I hold power.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,919
I'm a thinker.

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,399
I crave victory.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,759
I do not give up.

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,439
I feel no fear.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,799
I fear no man.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,919
I'm an athlete, a warrior.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,421
An artist.

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,399
If it was easy, everybody
would be good at it.

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,839
I was told that long
time ago by a coach.

16
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,159
If you want something
you never had before,

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,279
you gotta be willing
to do something

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,199
you've never done before.

19
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,319
That's what I live by.

20
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,599
I want to be two-time Mr. Olympia.

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,159
I have to be willing
to do whatever it takes.

22
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,119
You know, the record is
eight Mr. Olympia titles

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,639
held by Lee Haney
and Ronnie Colman.

24
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,239
Arnold Schwarzenegger won seven,

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,759
Jay Cutler won four.

26
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,839
I think for me it's just, I'm
already the best at what I do.

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,639
I had to ask myself a serious
question, which was, can I get better

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,279
than what I just did?

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,959
And it was like, the next
day at a photo shoot, I knew.

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,599
I don't like the way
I look right there.

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,319
People would say, "Are you
crazy? You just beat everybody!

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,999
You won with a perfect score."

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,799
But in my heart,
I knew, I was like,

34
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,199
"Phil, this is just the beginning."

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,959
Your legacy is not gonna to be
dictated on winning one Olympia,

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,383
it's going to be
dictated on how many.

37
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,159
For all bodybuilders,
the experience is similar.

38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,239
They are an oddity,
stares, pointed fingers.

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,479
They're in a freak show

40
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,559
with no circus tent
to hide away in.

41
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,559
For the 32-year-old
champ, it's an honor,

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,439
an honor that fuels his
drive to secure position

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,319
as the greatest
bodybuilder of his day,

44
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,239
to prove that his win was no fluke.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,439
- All right, take care.
- Thank you!

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,799
There's a lot of people out there
wondering, "Can he do it again?"

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,319
So it's my job to remind them

48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,159
and the world that
I am the champion.

49
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,150

Please take the first-place award,

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,599
the Olympia Gold Metal,

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,319
the Sandow Bronze
Award, and the title

89
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,879
of 2011 Mr. Olympia

90
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,279
to our winner tonight...

91
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,639
Phil Heath!

92
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,679
Bodybuilding falls into
this unique category

93
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,039
of, you know, being a sport,

94
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,479
being entertainment,

95
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,959
being a way of life,
and being also art.

96
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,679
So you have to really have a sense

97
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,519
of a sculptor to really
sculpt, to mold your body.

98
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,079
The only difference is
that we in bodybuilding

99
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,479
use a certain machine to
train the front deltoid,

100
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,759
if it's missing, or a
certain machines to train

101
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,159
the serratus or the intercostals,

102
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,079
and an artist or a sculptor

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,879
uses a chisel and a hammer.

104
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,119
But it's all about what
is your vision about

105
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,599
the way you should look
like as a finished product

106
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,239
and how do you get it there.

107
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,759
You're trying to take your body

108
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,439
and sculpt it to where
everything is in proportion,

109
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,039
everything from right side
to the left side is equal,

110
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,399
and just being a true work of art.

111
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,039
I think the main motivation for me

112
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,279
with this whole
bodybuilding experience is

113
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,839
knowing that there's no such
thing as "the perfect body."

114
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,879
But I'm gonna chase
it as hard as I can.

115
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,439
Joe Weider was really
the father of fitness.

116
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,919
He created the Mr. Olympia
contest, and created

117
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,239
the International
Federation of Bodybuilders,

118
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,039
and the Mr. Olympia became

119
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,719
the Super Bowl of bodybuilding.

120
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,799
What does it mean
to be Mr. Olympia?

121
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,439
It means to be the
best of the best.

122
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,679
A great champion
is a lot of things.

123
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,799
You have to be a role
model to a lot of people.

124
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,239
You have to carry yourself as
a professional all the time.

125
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,039
You have to go in and have
to train at 100 percent.

126
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,319
You have to go to bed
every night and say,

127
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,839
"Am I fulfilling the task

128
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,519
of being the best at what I do?"

129
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,159
Like in any sport,

130
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,599
you can win it and
relax a little bit,

131
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,279
or you can win it and stay hungry.

132
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,879
Do you really want to, you
know, win it more that once?

133
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,599
But there's never a guarantee.

134
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,479
It comes down to the mind,

135
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,159
the will, the determination,

136
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,159
the discipline and the motivation.

137
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,319
And you have that fierce drive
that nothing's gonna stop you.

138
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,639
That's what makes you a champion.

139
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,439
When you are a champion, you
never think you're gonna lose.

140
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,279
This is you life,
and this is your job.

141
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,239
This is your number-one
responsibility,

142
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,319
your number-one priority in life.

143
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,359
All you gotta do is continue
to do what you done before.

144
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,479
Let them follow you.

145
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,039
You don't have to follow them.

146
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,519
So, if I try to change
up my training system...

147
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,639
Why?

148
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,439
Why would I change?

149
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,959
I am who I am.

150
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,519
They are who they are.

151
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,919
They may try to change
to do what I'm doing,

152
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,999
because I have
proven that it worked.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,359
I'm the leader, I'm the man.

154
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,959
Not you, me, and it's
okay, because I look good.

155
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,879
I think that Phil has the look,

156
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,399
the physique, the mindset.

157
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,519
I think he has the fire in
the belly to be a champion,

158
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,559
which is something he wants to
do for the next several years.

159
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,359
So I think we'll have
the next Ronnie Coleman.

160
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,319
Phil Heath, also
known as "The Gift,"

161
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,559
is the image of confidence.

162
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,119
The Olympia competition
is still weeks away.

163
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,679
Some of his contenders
have yet to qualify,

164
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,959
yet he has no qualms about
having a suit tailored

165
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,599
for his victory.

166
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,239
I'm not gonna lie, I
mean, I kinda like knowing

167
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,719
that when I win,

168
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,079
not only I outshine them on stage,

169
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,679
but then off stage.

170
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,719
Because I know that
I'm covering every angle

171
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,399
to be better than them.

172
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,319
If I go out on the
town with the missus,

173
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,839
or if I'm going out with the guys,

174
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,479
I'm wearing
button-downs, you know,

175
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,639
I'm wearing the same stuff,
the guy would be like,

176
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,879
"How did you fit in that?"

177
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,559
I say, "Well I got a tailor, bro."

178
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,064
There are always
contenders waiting to rise.

179
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,399
Waiting for the perfect moment

180
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,267
to take advantage of a misstep...

181
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,479
an unseen weakness.

182
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,719
This is Kai Greene, his nemesis,

183
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,119
his enemy, studying every pose.

184
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,463
He has 11 weeks to prepare.

185
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,199
For me, winning the Olympia

186
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,359
is a celebration
for a lot of people

187
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,959
that at least can share in the idea

188
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,879
that well, you know,
maybe I wasn't born

189
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,519
with the best genetics,
or maybe I wasn't born

190
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,919
with the most dashing good looks,

191
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,799
but there's something
to be said for hard work.

192
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,879
So, you know, we can
say, "Keep your gifts."

193
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,439
I work hard.

194
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,879
I know how to work real hard.

195
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,039
Even if I tear a bicep,

196
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,079
I'm still gonna stay
on my discipline.

197
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,759
Look at me from every angle,

198
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,959
and you're not gonna
see one piece of my body

199
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,959
that's undeveloped.

200
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,199
I'm gonna develop
symmetry, conditioning,

201
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,399
and I am going to
whup the ass of anyone

202
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,959
that stands there believing

203
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,159
that all it takes is genetics.

204
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,119
Hard work beats
talent all the time.

205
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,519
Well, that's what he's thinking.

206
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,719
He thinks that hard work
is gonna beat talent.

207
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,479
When talent actually
works hard, it's over.

208
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,039
There's nothing that that
other person can do about it.

209
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,359
That confidence has led
Phil to achieve a greatness

210
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,079
few can dream of.

211
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,919
But pride and arrogance
have been the downfall

212
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,559
of many great men.

213
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,959
Kai never had a family.

214
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,079
His mother abandoned him
when he was a teenager.

215
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,759
And from that point
on, he was raised

216
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,079
by various foster parents,
moving from home to home.

217
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,879
Kai grew angry and
aggressive over time.

218
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,159
Before long, he found himself

219
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,399
in a juvenile detention facility.

220
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,879
His story would have ended there

221
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,759
if he hadn't
discovered bodybuilding.

222
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,959
The feelings of being
unsafe, feeling unsafe,

223
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,439
constantly under threat.

224
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,839
I remember I was in the process

225
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,079
of being restrained while fighting,

226
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,799
my shirt had gotten torn

227
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,119
in the midst of the
whole demonstration,

228
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,079
I'm taking the rest of the
shirt and throwin' it off.

229
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,879
"Fuck that, what?"

230
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,319
You know, you go through
this whole display

231
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,319
of "I'm powerful, I'm
angry, I don't care!"

232
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,439
You do this thing, and it
was some time after that

233
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,759
the teacher, I had bumped
into him again maybe

234
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,719
a week or so, back in population.

235
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,519
He had said, "Hey, you know,
you got a physique on you!

236
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,639
How you'd like to
think about competing

237
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,399
against teenagers your own age?"

238
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,999
I thought it was a joke.

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,839
Back then, I never even
used to think that I would

240
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,239
probably ever even get out of being

241
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,079
in institutional placement.

242
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,719
It's a lot easier for me

243
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,639
to have been
identified as an animal.

244
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,319
Going to the gym and
training, it was probably

245
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,399
the single most important
therapeutic choice

246
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,479
I could make on my own.

247
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,319
And the people that were in my life

248
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,199
have long since moved on.

249
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,919
The one thing that's
remained consistent

250
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,519
is still, you know, your focus

251
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,502
towards achieving
this ultimate goal.

252
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,199
Texas.

253
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,879
Wide plains.

254
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,759
Open spaces.

255
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,519
Scorching heat.

256
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,159
Branch Warren leads a simple life

257
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,345
away from the hustle
and bustle of the city.

258
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
I tore my quadriceps tendon,
and it completely detached.

259
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,159
No one's ever come
back from injury,

260
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,959
you know, that injury,
especially that fast.

261
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,479
Most people, it ends their career.

262
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,879
I did it in six months.

263
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
And that was an accident, right?

264
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,839
I was walking in the parking lot...

265
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,319
in a thunderstorm.

266
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,919
And...

267
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,559
I slipped and fell.

268
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,679
So, you never know
what kind of curve ball

269
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,519
life's gonna throw at you, right?

270
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,559
Some people cry and bitch
about it like little girls,

271
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,439
you know, and be babies about it.

272
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,079
A man, he has issues.

273
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,039
He sets it aside, he
focuses on what he...

274
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,759
what his job is and gets it done.

275
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,279
I put my faith in God.

276
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,159
You know, I learned
from a very young age

277
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,919
that no one owes you anything,

278
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,039
and there ain't nobody
gonna give you a damn thing.

279
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,639
But you can have anything you want

280
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,029
if you work hard enough for it.

281
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,711
What's up?

282
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,759
Gotta take care of
business in the gym.

283
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,039
You're with the boys, so you
gotta do what you gotta do.

284
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,879
And when you come home, you don't
bring that home to your family.

285
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,879
Metroflex Gym.

286
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,119
Built inside an old warehouse.

287
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,439
Produced many of Texas'
greatest bodybuilders,

288
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,319
including the great Ronnie Coleman,

289
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,799
eight-time Mr. Olympia.

290
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,559
Now it serves as a training
camp for Branch Warren

291
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,239
and his training
partner, Johnnie Jackson.

292
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,479
Yeah, baby!

293
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,664
One more, go!

294
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,199
Yeah!

295
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,906
Come on, get some.

296
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,639
Nobody beats you.

297
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,948
Huh?

298
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,799
I grew up in that gym.

299
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,119
I mean, from learning how to
fight, to learn how to train,

300
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,429
to learn how to be a man.

301
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,399
I don't think there's one bodybuilder
on this planet that's competed...

302
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,919
or even dreamed of competing

303
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,479
that hasn't dreamed
of being Mr. Olympia.

304
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,839
For 20 years, man,
I go to bed at night

305
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,199
thinkin' about it, and I wake up

306
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,559
in the morning thinkin' about it.

307
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,959
I think about it when I train.

308
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,679
I've accomplished everything in
this sport I set out to accomplish.

309
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,239
I've got one contest left to win.

310
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,079
I'll eat dirt if I have to
eat dirt to win this, so...

311
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,679
I don't care.

312
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,919
You know, you're
goin' against the 15-20

313
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,439
best bodybuilders on the planet.

314
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,799
We all wanna win.

315
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,479
And I'm doing
everything in my power

316
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,311
to make sure I win.

317
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,879
Get out, move.

318
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,719
Out of my face.

319
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,039
Let's go.

320
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,439
Branch is one of
those guys who just,

321
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,079
I've never seen him
do anything right,

322
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,519
or efficiently, he just
works hard at everything.

323
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,159
You look at him train, you're like,

324
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,799
"Man, I don't know how you
still have any joints left."

325
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,599
And that's why it's
easy to pick on him.

326
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,279
There's just no intelligence.

327
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,319
There's no, like, it's pure work
ethic, man, which is great.

328
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,519
And that's probably nine of the
top tens of guys in the IFBB,

329
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,559
is they're doing the same
crap, day in, day out,

330
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,999
year in, year out, not gettin' any
better, but then they think the result

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,359
is gonna be better.

332
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,679
Well, news flash for ya,
it's not gonna happen.

333
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,879
Take a smarter approach,
take a different approach,

334
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,159
you know, get better at
it, which is why I need...

335
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,559
if I wanna compete with these guys

336
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,079
and beat these guys, I need to take

337
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,039
the most precise,
educated, scientific

338
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,319
approach possible.

339
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,799
The great thing about this machine

340
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,559
it's gonna give us, you know,

341
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,639
any ounce of fat that he loses,

342
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,439
any ounce of muscle that he gains,

343
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,599
it's gonna track it.

344
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,999
It's extremely sensitive.

345
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,399
Ben's faith in his scientific
approach to bodybuilding

346
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,799
is complete and unquestioning.

347
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,919
He has no shame in
comparing the failure

348
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,519
of his opponents'
training philosophies

349
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,079
to the efficiency of his own.

350
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,839
You ask him to push
himself to a certain level,

351
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,999
and he finds a way
to push past that.

352
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,159
And we're tryin' to
kill him in the gym,

353
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,639
you know, we're really
trying to push him mentally.

354
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,919
That's perfect.

355
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,359
That's perfect, right there.

356
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,639
Squeeze harder.

357
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,399
That's it, squeeze harder.

358
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,799
That's it, perfect!

359
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,679
That's exactly what we want, man.

360
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,279
That... those last
three, four reps,

361
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,439
you were activating
maximal amount of muscle.

362
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,319
That's exactly what
we need for growth.

363
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,359
Bodybuilding is the
most fascinating sport

364
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,799
there is in the world.

365
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,839
And in fact, this whole
laboratory is dedicated

366
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,079
to studying bodybuilding.

367
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,759
Even NFL linemen, they get big.

368
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,399
And they get a lot of muscle.

369
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,199
But how in the world
can you get massive

370
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,559
and get shredded at the same time?

371
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,599
This is completely counterintuitive

372
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,919
to even science.

373
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,799
So, to study how do you do that

374
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,439
is phenomenal.

375
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,399
I remember it clear
as day, Flex Magazine,

376
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,679
I was 15 years old at
the YMCA in Toronto.

377
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,079
And the guy sitting at the
front desk brought one in.

378
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,479
I looked at the cover
of it, and I was like,

379
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,639
"Man, that's
disgusting, that's gross.

380
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,439
Man, I never wanna look like that."

381
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,479
For me, it was more
along the lines of,

382
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,279
well, I achieved my
goal, now, what's next?

383
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,679
And I achieved my
goal, and what's next?

384
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,839
So, first I wanna be
190 pounds with abs.

385
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,919
Did it.

386
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,879
Wanna be 210 with abs, did it.

387
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,519
And I just keep pushin',
and pushin', and pushin' it.

388
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,519
I guess I was just never content,
never happy with my body.

389
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,799
That's really, you know,
where it started for me.

390
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,799
Myself as a bodybuilder,
should be someone

391
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,399
constantly striving to be
one percent better every day,

392
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,919
you know, whether it
be in your workouts,

393
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,399
in your approach to life,

394
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,639
in your mentality,
in your nutrition,

395
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,919
how meticulous you
are with nutrition.

396
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,999
Just being better and better.

397
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,559
Pushing your... every
aspect of your life.

398
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,039
Like, I've always
known that Mr. Olympia

399
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,279
was something I could do.

400
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,919
If I want it, and
I set my mind to it,

401
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,479
there's nothing that
can stand in my way.

402
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,759
There you go, man, no pain.

403
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,119
Come on, hit it, there you go!

404
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,199
Drive it!

405
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,039
You think this is fancy,
let's go, hurry up!

406
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,919
Man, there's always somebody
trying to reinvent the wheel.

407
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,599
I don't care what kind
of scientific formulas,

408
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,399
or whatever it is you come up with,

409
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,359
or nutrition or whatever.

410
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,399
There's no substitute
for hard, hard work.

411
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,199
And the pain and the
sacrifice, the sweat,

412
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,639
all the hard work, man,

413
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,119
when they announce you winner,

414
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,719
it's all worth it.

415
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,239
Heavy clouds loom
over Tampa, Florida.

416
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,519
Roelly Winklaar arrives
from Rotterdam, Holland,

417
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,399
with his trainer, Sibil Peeters.

418
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,239
In the industry,
she's known as Grandma.

419
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,591
But those who've trained with her
know her as the trainer from hell.

420
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,065
Ah, rattlesnakes.

421
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,919
I like snakes because I like

422
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,519
how they eat the food, you know?

423
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,839
Kill them.

424
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,519
And then eat them, you know?

425
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,559
The body's like this and
they eat like this, you know?

426
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,319
That's the way I like it.

427
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,079
They ask, "Where do you come from?"

428
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,959
And I say, Curaçao.

429
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,359
In the face, you can see that

430
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,759
they don't know where
that is, you know?

431
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,919
And I say, the Caribbean.

432
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,548
Then everybody knows the Caribbean.

433
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,199
The two always share a
bedroom during their travels,

434
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,799
the mobile kitchen
and key ingredients

435
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,304
traveling along with
them everywhere they go.

436
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,199
Sibil herself used to be
a professional bodybuilder.

437
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,959
Put the fish on it.

438
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,279
But after the tragic
death of her husband,

439
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,999
she dedicated her life
to training others.

440
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,919
Grandma, is my food finished?

441
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,679
Is my food finished?

442
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,439
Your food is finished.

443
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,479
In the Netherlands,
I trained like a week

444
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,559
with the guys.

445
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,039
My body grows fast, you know?

446
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,759
The owner asked me if
I want to do a contest...

447
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,439
I say, "No, I don't
want to do that because

448
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,199
I don't like the
string in your ass!

449
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,119
It's not my style.

450
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,399
And he says,

451
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,999
"it's not string in your ass.

452
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,719
The name is posing
trunks, you know?"

453
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,039
I say, "No, I don't like it."

454
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,359
And he says, "I got
one option for you.

455
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,319
You go on stage, and you win,

456
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,119
you can train for
nothing, and I'll give you

457
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,559
food and supplements."

458
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,519
I say, "But I got one problem.

459
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,959
I got nobody, you know?"

460
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,919
Everybody told me to go
to that woman over there.

461
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,039
Grandma.

462
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,159
I say "Grandma?

463
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,599
Are you crazy, man?

464
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,799
Don't let me train
with a woman, man!"

465
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,359
"Really, she's good, she's good.

466
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,999
"She's one of the best, you know?"

467
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,919
I give her hand, but I say,

468
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,119
"Wow, you're a trainer?"

469
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,959
I say, "Hey come on,
you can talk to me

470
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,559
straight away, come on."

471
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,199
And then, I find out that
he was very, very shy.

472
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,039
In Holland, there was
an ugly word for him.

473
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,519
"Look out, he's lazy.

474
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,679
Lazy negro."

475
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,102
I say, "Come on, guys!"

476
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,319
I trained with him, he's
not lazy, the guy is...

477
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,119
Go, go, go, go!

478
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,799
He's like a machine.

479
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,959
In the gym, he's a machine,
nobody can stop him.

480
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,999
He is "The Beast."

481
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,639
My dream is to make
a house for my mother.

482
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,079
Before my father died,
my father wanted to buy

483
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,039
a big house for her.

484
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,199
But that's not happened.

485
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,079
What my father promised
her, I make her.

486
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,359
Tomorrow, in accordance
with the IFBB point system,

487
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,679
Roelly must place first or second

488
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,239
in order to qualify
for the Olympia stage.

489
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,959
So Winklaar...

490
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,159
Are you nervous
for the competition?

491
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,639
No.

492
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,599
You're always nervous
before a contest.

493
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,879
It has to be you're nervous,
otherwise on stage, you're...

494
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,919
No, I'm not nervous because...

495
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,999
I know I'm gonna win, you know?

496
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,159
Okay.

497
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,399
Put down the telephone.

498
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,799
You want to put it down?

499
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,879
Put it down.

500
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,959
You sure?

501
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,639
Come on, we have to go to sleep!

502
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,666
For a long time, I
have been tired, OK?

503
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,039
Hidetada Yamagishi has
also yet to qualify.

504
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,319
Hide must place in the top two

505
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,519
in order to advance.

506
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,119
If he didn't have a
tan, you wouldn't see

507
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,639
his definition on stage,

508
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,479
you wouldn't see his striations,
his vascularity, anything.

509
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,799
He would just wash out
under the bright lights.

510
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,239
You really gotta be dark
when you get on that stage.

511
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,079
When the guys have to go on stage,

512
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,999
and they go white on stage,

513
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,679
their muscles look small.

514
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,479
When you're painting up,

515
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,919
you can see

516
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,839
the muscles look very, very good.

517
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,501
OK, bend over.

518
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,181
When we are finished,
we are all brown.

519
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,319
Seven.

520
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,239
I got nine, Jason.

521
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,679
Ten, Todd's here.

522
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,279
I got 11, I got 12, I got 13.

523
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,399
I got 14, I got 15.

524
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,790
I'm missing 16, Shawn?

525
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,999
The bodybuilder
takes the human form

526
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,639
to its utmost visual extreme.

527
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,119
The development of muscles

528
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,079
isn't just a game of measurements.

529
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,787
Perfect symmetry is
equally important.

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,599

fourth-place award.

546
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,359
The check for $1,000...

547
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,439
to our fourth-place finisher.

548
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,679
Roelly Winklaar!

549
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,679
The road to success

550
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,279
isn't always straight
or clear in this sport.

551
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,599
Another loss like Tampa
would mean months and years

552
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,511
of training have been wasted.

553
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,479
This means the loss of prize money

554
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,199
and perhaps even a sponsor,

555
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,941
the support line
for any bodybuilder.

556
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,839
Lonely nights,
familiar hotel rooms,

557
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,679
long-distance calls
are the only way

558
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,545
to keep in touch with loved ones.

559
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,679
At times when the
family can't be reached,

560
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,639
the trainer is the
only person to talk to.

561
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,159
Hey, bro, congratulations!

562
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,999
Second place, and
Olympia qualification.

563
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,999
I'm happy, and I'm
relieved, you know?

564
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,759
Yeah, me too.

565
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,359
I knew you were gonna do
it, but now it's official.

566
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,399
So, we got six weeks to train hard.

567
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,719
Alright.

568
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,985
Okay, bro, keep in touch,
and thanks for calling.

569
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,639
Roelly has trouble
sleeping most nights.

570
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,959
Moments ago, he was told that he
has one more chance to qualify,

571
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,959
but he'll have to travel back to
Europe to compete at the Nordic Pro.

572
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,479
Winklaar.

573
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,319
You OK?

574
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,026
Yeah, Grandma.

575
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,319
It's time for your food.

576
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,707
Yes.

577
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,879
Unless he places first,
his journey will end

578
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,587
before it begins.

579
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,399
Victor Martinez wasn't
always an inmate.

580
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,239
He was a star,

581
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,759
a star bodybuilder on his way
to conquer the Olympia title.

582
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,559
He was incarcerated for
an immigration charge

583
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,879
as a result of his arrest

584
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,639
for a controlled
substance years ago.

585
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,879
To actually be in
jail and want to live

586
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,679
or think of outside, it
just makes it all difficult.

587
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,919
I had to shut down,

588
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,079
there's no making up,
it's lost time, that's it.

589
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,264
I was disappearing.

590
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,879
His stint in jail has left
him far behind his competitors.

591
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,519
And mounting emotional
and financial problems

592
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,399
won't make his return any easier.

593
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,879
A six-month sentence is a
lifetime for a bodybuilder.

594
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,639
You're at war right now,
with other competitors.

595
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,119
And when you do what you have to do

596
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,559
from now to the Mr. Olympia,

597
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,919
you do what you have to do to win.

598
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,439
And as long as you know you
did what you had to do to win,

599
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,559
nobody can ever say anything
bad about you ever, ever.

600
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,159
Because you know in your heart,

601
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,639
you gave it your all.

602
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,119
Coming back now, preparing
for the Olympia is...

603
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,719
I don't have that
feeling like I'm ready.

604
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,359
I can't say I walked in
and had the best workout.

605
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,159
The first time I went
in, it was horrible.

606
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,919
I'm touching the
weights, and it's...

607
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,319
there's no connection, I
didn't really eat in there.

608
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,119
Seven, 800 calories, most
of it was through bread

609
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,679
and you know, junk
food, Snickers bars.

610
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,079
I'd say right now,

611
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,679
every workout I do is important.

612
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,119
Between meals and training,

613
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,839
between court-ordered
appointments,

614
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,279
between his separation
from his girlfriend,

615
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,359
between all these things, he
tries to maintain his sanity.

616
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,839
He tries to find time to be
a father to his four children.

617
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,639
Two boys, which are
autistic, and two young girls,

618
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,599
all from different mothers

619
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,839
I'm backed up on child support,
I still take care of my kids,

620
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,799
but, they freeze your bank account,

621
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,199
they suspend your license

622
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,599
and yes, I'm driving
illegally right now.

623
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,879
So what, what can you do, you know?

624
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,985
Let's warm up, after
this, we gotta pick it up.

625
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,959
I'm not mentally ready, it's...

626
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,439
it's bothersome every single day.

627
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,919
It's bothering because I'm
working on it every day,

628
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,279
you know, preparing myself.

629
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,399
Pick up your spirit, let's go.

630
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,999
Come on, man!

631
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,990
We gotta do this.

632
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,547
Come on!

633
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,119
Great set.

634
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,559
I can't keep going like this.

635
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,519
I gotta try to pick it up, man.

636
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,959
I'm playing with the big boys, man.

637
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,599
That's why we gotta push.

638
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,784
You'll get back there again.

639
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,799
Push it.

640
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,559
That's it.

641
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,199
Come on!

642
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,667
You can do this.

643
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,679
You're gonna do this, man.

644
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,679
You gotta stay focused.

645
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,399
I mean...

646
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,839
You want to be on that
stage again, right?

647
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,759
Yeah, of course.

648
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,239
I strive on fear.

649
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,359
If something scares
me, if I'm afraid of it,

650
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,559
I always want to face it.

651
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,439
My entire life is the
fricking stock market, man!

652
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,511

Dennis Wolf wanders through

660
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,959
This is a dream come
true for the bodybuilder

661
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,919
from Germany.

662
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,679
A moment of classic
American celebrity,

663
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,919
an interview on the
nationalized television show.

664
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,359
This is his time,

665
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,199
his moment to grasp a hold of fame.

666
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,119
Welcome back to
"The Morning Blend."

667
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,039
They're fit, they're strong,
but there can only be one!

668
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,119
The world's top
bodybuilders are competing

669
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,759
to bring home the coveted
title of Mr. Olympia.

670
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,599
I was a big fan of
Arnold Schwarzenegger,

671
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,639
and bodybuilding, I
fell in love right away,

672
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,319
when I walk out... you know,

673
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,879
walk in for the first
time into the gym

674
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,839
and that was my thing.

675
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,679
People are going to
America to have success,

676
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,439
the first six months was
hard because people are,

677
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,239
"Oh, look at this
guy, he's probably just

678
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,119
lifting weights and that's it.

679
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,639
Dumb, stupid," because
people have no idea

680
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,142
what is bodybuilding.

681
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,119
You need someone who can push you,

682
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,719
and it's not easy to find
someone who can push me,

683
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,439
that's why I have Dennis.

684
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,559
Your know, every time
we train together,

685
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,039
he finish me, he's finishing me,

686
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,239
and, you know, I'm sore for days.

687
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,319
Come on, one more, come on!

688
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,279
- Too big pump!
- Come on!

689
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,239
That's what we're here for!

690
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,999
We gonna pump the iron, come on!

691
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,119
Slow, Dennis, slow, slow, slow.

692
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,639
Slow!

693
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,679
That's good and three...

694
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,199
Let's go!

695
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,319
Hup, hup, hup!

696
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,159
Stand up and move around a little.

697
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,027
You have to lose that
one, I'm really dizzy.

698
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,224
Anybody ready to break dance?

699
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,279
Almost drowned!

700
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,999
Germany, with its cold
and oppressive rain

701
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,679
stands in stark contrast
to Vegas' glaring sunshine.

702
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,519
To him, America is the chance

703
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,759
to become one of the greats.

704
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,639
To become an Arnold.

705
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,359
To become a star.

706
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,119
Wolf's stepdaughter visits
him as often as she can.

707
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,959
Their relationship
is as strong as iron,

708
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,799
despite the lack of blood ties.

709
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,559
I saw him every day.

710
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,159
It's... yeah.

711
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,799
I didn't think he's
big, it's normal for me,

712
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,639
every day I saw him.

713
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,479
Everybody should place
where they deserve.

714
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,119
It's hard when you
have so many judges

715
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,639
and you have so
many great athletes,

716
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,079
where the standard is so close,

717
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,599
you could throw a coin.

718
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,599
You know, apples or
oranges, what do you like?

719
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,159
You know, it is
that close sometimes,

720
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,959
"He was great, wow, wow, wow."

721
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,479
How do you judge?

722
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,279
He has a better smile,
he has green eyes,

723
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,279
he has blue eyes,
he has brown eyes.

724
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,319
You know what I mean...
it's hard, it's not easy.

725
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,359
Every muscle part must
be completely perfect.

726
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,319
No weak points, we get
judged by weak points.

727
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,399
If you don't have
the better symmetry,

728
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,319
the better muscle
maturity, muscle quality,

729
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,519
as Mr. Olympia, you don't win.

730
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,119
Do the double biceps.

731
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,839
Try to open up, pull up, pull up...

732
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,025
And bend the wrists
back a little bit.

733
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,199
"Oh, his hairstyle.

734
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,799
He's gotta be gay,
there's something wrong.

735
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,279
I just... somethings
wrong with that guy,

736
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,639
he's just so different!

737
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,319
You'll never be a champion.

738
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,599
You might win a show but...

739
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,079
you'll never be Mr. Olympia!"

740
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,119
While others will
celebrate, you know,

741
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,703
achieving master's and Ph.D.s...

742
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,959
I won bodybuilding competitions.

743
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,759
And now I stand here, at
the top of this experience,

744
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,919
looking at winning the highest...

745
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,026
title in the bodybuilding world.

746
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,279
Turn your wrist in, pull it tight!

747
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,639
Flex your hamstrings, pull tight!

748
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,079
Pull.

749
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,479
Pull.

750
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,679
Pull it.

751
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,839
Pull it!

752
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,399
Roll it over a little more, Kai.

753
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,039
There we go, pop
your hamstring out.

754
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,479
Squeeze... all the way down!

755
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,959
Bring this up... pull
tight, hamstring up a little.

756
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,999
Posing is a very valuable
tool to build a physique,

757
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,959
to build a physique
that is historically

758
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,239
the physique that is bodybuilding.

759
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,999
It's not just enough
to go to the gym,

760
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,719
and just train, and lift weights.

761
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,399
There's an internal connection

762
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,479
with the contractions
that your muscles make.

763
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,799
What I'm really talking about

764
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,159
is the presence of
the artistic mind

765
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,745
that ultimately
sculpts the physique.

766
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,999
Lower your shoulders,
you're doing it wrong.

767
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,479
Let's do it again.

768
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,948
No, do it again.

769
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,582
Suck it in...

770
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,959
Legs, legs, legs.

771
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,639
You're forgetting about your legs.

772
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,919
People always tell me,
"Hey, he's looking tired.

773
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,079
You let him do too much."

774
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,679
But he's always up
late on the internet,

775
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,159
coming in the gym
with a face like this.

776
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,399
That makes me angry!

777
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,679
It's not allowed.

778
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,919
I respect you, you
have to respect me.

779
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,679
Don't come with a face like this

780
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,519
because you didn't sleep.

781
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,719
Go to your bed, you have to rest.

782
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,119
Let me know when you're finished.

783
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,959
You need your energy on the stage,

784
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,799
when you don't have
it on the stage,

785
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,199
you can lose everything.

786
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,759
- I know.
- In the off-season,

787
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,150
do what you want, don't
do it in the competition!

788
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,559
- What's up, champ?
- Dennis James,

789
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,039
a retired bodybuilder, and mentor

790
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,439
in the eyes of most athletes,

791
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,679
doesn't sugarcoat criticism.

792
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,319
From posing, to diet, to training,

793
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,519
his astute eye can
identify any problem.

794
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,719
So this time you have to
really, really go out there,

795
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,679
and you have to nail it...
and I talked to a judge

796
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,159
who said that you lose
two spots on his sheets

797
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,559
because of the way you
pose, you know what I mean?

798
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,919
So this is something
you can control.

799
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,359
You can work on that.

800
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,919
- You can show him.
- Yeah, of course.

801
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,479
You're here, please help.

802
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,439
Now pull it down, like
you do a lat pulldown,

803
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,359
and now open up... there you go.

804
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,679
See, now he has some
movement going on.

805
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,599
The judge told me this
was not coming out,

806
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,999
and that's why.

807
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,279
You know how you bring that out?

808
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,799
Just try this one time.

809
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,959
Instead of going right
into something like this,

810
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,719
try to go up, pull it down,

811
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,199
then open up, 'cause
you create music.

812
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,559
This is again what I'm saying,

813
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,028
you move, eyes on you.

814
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,079
Always start from the bottom,
legs, hamstrings, glutes.

815
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,119
Now arms, all the way, straight up.

816
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,679
Just like... that's
it, just like that!

817
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,319
That's what I want him
to do, see the difference?

818
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,919
- You see that?
- Yeah.

819
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,159
Our third-place finalist,

820
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,119
representing Germany, number two,

821
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,239
Ronny Rockel.

822
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,919
Let's take the
first runner-up award

823
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,959
and present that to...

824
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,519
by way of Poland, number eight,

825
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,079
Robert Piotrkowicz.

826
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,319
The first-place prize,

827
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,959
and moving on to the
Mr. Olympia contest...

828
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,279
Roelly Winklaar!

829
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,439
- Finally!
- Finally!

830
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,399
Nice job!

831
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,559
This what we worked so hard for!

832
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,599
Hey, finally...

833
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,079
Finally, we made it through.

834
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,159
Yes, finally.

835
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,639
We are...

836
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,079
up to the...

837
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,309
- Mr. O.
- O, nice!

838
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,039
The Martinez family moved

839
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,559
to Washington Heights, New York,

840
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,719
from the Dominican Republic
when Victor was six years old.

841
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,559
He grew up in a house
with seven sisters,

842
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,839
two brothers, an
overbearing mother,

843
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,639
and a strict, unsupportive father.

844
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,559
That lack of support
and understanding

845
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,639
has plagued Victor's
ambitions his entire career.

846
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,799
Getting smaller, man!

847
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,599
What's up... you're
not working out, man!

848
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,399
Trying to, I'm gonna
get to the gym, man.

849
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,039
Good, good, good.

850
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,199
Get me a ticket or
something, I'll go!

851
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,863
Yeah, all right.

852
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,439
In 2009, Victor's sister,
Iridania, was murdered.

853
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,559
Iridania always
cooked meals for Victor

854
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,519
before his competitions.

855
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,944
Her absence affects
him to this day.

856
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,679
You say "Daddy"?

857
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,319
No... So you want ice cream?

858
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,799
No?

859
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,719
I know you want...

860
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,799
Oh!

861
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,839
What was that kiss for?

862
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,639
That was all for me?

863
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,519
Victor loves returning
to his old neighborhood,

864
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,279
where everything seems so familiar.

865
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,199
Familiar faces, familiar places.

866
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,679
This is a place he will
always call home in his heart,

867
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,399
mostly because of his daughter,

868
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,759
who still resides
here with her mother.

869
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,679
Quitting has not been a choice,

870
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,999
only because I cannot see myself

871
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,279
explaining this to my kids.

872
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,639
Right now, I have to
provide for my family.

873
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,030
I need bodybuilding to survive.

874
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,479
- Goddamn!
- All right, bro.

875
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,919
How are you doin', bro?

876
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,279
Fast!

877
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,839
Killing yourself
down here, already?

878
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,159
Yeah, I have to, man.

879
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,822
- The only way to go, bro!
- No doubt!

880
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,079
I'm very proud of you, you hear me?

881
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,199
God bless you, bro!

882
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,719
My judgment day will be
seeing Steve Weinberger.

883
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,159
Seeing the judge,
and him telling me

884
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,959
if I'm ready for the
Olympia stage or not.

885
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,959
Yeah, look at your hamstrings.

886
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,879
I'm telling you, Victor,

887
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,587
you have a lot of work to
do before you see Steve.

888
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,439
Can I get two pounds?

889
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,146
- Two pounds?
- Yes, sir.

890
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,999
It's pretty intense.

891
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,519
It's always intense.

892
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,559
Somebody may ask you,
"Is it that serious?"

893
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,239
It's always that serious.

894
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,559
I'm a professional at what I do.

895
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,599
I'm not a fan, I'm not a spectator,

896
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,999
I'm not the person at home,
I'm the man living this.

897
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,119
If I don't eat like this,

898
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,079
I don't make conscious food choices

899
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,079
when it's time to make them,

900
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,919
every day, all day,

901
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,359
then the goods won't be
there when I need them to be.

902
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,719
This is the easy part.

903
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,279
If you can't do the easy stuff,

904
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,799
then what do you do
when life happens?

905
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,439
Things will come and test you.

906
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,919
A loved one goes to the hospital.

907
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,879
It's abrupt.

908
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,359
You feel obligated or compelled

909
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,719
to want to be there.

910
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,199
You still gotta be in the gym
at six o'clock in the morning.

911
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,919
You still gotta start your meals,

912
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,879
so for you to stay focused,

913
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,159
it's not a sacrifice,
it has to be a lifestyle.

914
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,279
When you're training
for the competition,

915
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,519
it consumes your whole day...

916
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,919
bodybuilders, by
definition, most of 'em

917
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,639
will tell you are very
self-centered and selfish.

918
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,439
Even if you're not that type of person,
you become that kind of person,

919
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,799
because you never get away from it,

920
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,399
because your nutrition,
when you're dieting,

921
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,239
for Mr. Olympia, you can't eat out,

922
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,839
because you have
to weigh your food,

923
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,039
you have to have so many carbs,
so much protein, so much water...

924
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,559
you have to control
what's in the food.

925
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,639
- What you got?
- We got beef, chicken,

926
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,279
turkey, beans,

927
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,999
potato salad and coleslaw.

928
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,039
Like a bunch of marinade
and things on it?

929
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,399
Not it's just...

930
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,599
salt.

931
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,319
Cool, man.

932
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,879
Damn, ain't gonna be
getting none of that today.

933
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,679
You can eat seven, eight
times a day, like some people.

934
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,879
I'm like, "Yeah, you gotta
eat a lot of clean food."

935
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,679
And then the mom will
say, "Yeah, my son eats,

936
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,799
he eats everything..."
yeah, he's eating everything.

937
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,199
That's why he's not lean.

938
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,759
Suppose to mix this in a drink,

939
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,759
but goes down fine just
like this, so why not?

940
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,319
Most other people,
they go to the store,

941
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,679
they'll buy some product.

942
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,359
They just...

943
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,519
and hoping for the best.

944
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,319
They don't know how
that actually works.

945
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,239
They don't know the science
behind those supplements.

946
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,039
They don't care, and
they're not supposed to,

947
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,439
I get that... but, yeah,
we're the dumb-dumbs.

948
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,039
We're the people that
don't know anything,

949
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,999
but just bein' a box
of rocks with weights,

950
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,759
and all this other stuff,
we're the meatheads,

951
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,319
we're the idiots...
we're able to do something

952
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,679
that 99.8 percent of the
people on the Earth can do,

953
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,079
which is lose fat

954
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,879
and gain muscle, at the same time.

955
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,679
They don't know that
we eat seven, eight,

956
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,279
nine thousand calories a day.

957
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,679
They don't know
that we're in the gym

958
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,079
two, three times a
day, six days a week.

959
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,279
Right away, they want to
just diminish your work.

960
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,119
By going to that one little
thing and brush it off,

961
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,145
they're saying, "You know what, it's
because they're taking steroids."

962
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,679
The overall perception
of steroids, obviously,

963
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,799
is something that
cheaters only use.

964
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,759
We are realizing now that
the truth of the matter

965
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,759
is any athlete at the professional

966
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,679
or world-class level...

967
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,599
is likely using some form

968
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,439
of performance-enhancing drugs.

969
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,559
Anabolic steroids don't make

970
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,959
what professional
bodybuilders do easier.

971
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,759
It simply allows them to
take it to that extreme level.

972
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,239
Anabolic steroids are
basically testosterone,

973
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,759
or testosterone derivatives.

974
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,399
So in the body, when you
take a synthetic form,

975
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,359
it basically gets
into the muscle cell,

976
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,479
attaches to receptors
that are in that cell,

977
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,519
and then that turns on
genes in the muscle cell

978
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,039
that produce more protein.

979
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,639
That's the way it
enhances muscle size.

980
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,039
Many of the athletes simply
refuse to talk on the subject.

981
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,639
It's taboo.

982
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,079
Others are willing to
engage in the conversation.

983
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,264
Because people...

984
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,599
take too much of this stuff,

985
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,919
and don't know how to use it,

986
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,359
that gives bodybuilding
a bad, bad name.

987
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,319
The media likes to portray
it as being very sensational

988
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,559
but steroids aren't addictive,
steroids never killed anybody.

989
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,839
There's no physiological
proof, it's never been shown,

990
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,759
it's all what the
media wants you to see.

991
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,399
Society's reaction to steroids

992
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,239
is often hypocritical
and judgmental.

993
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,079
I think it's a
contradiction, to be honest,

994
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,079
'cause most
bodybuilders that I know

995
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,959
and that I've met are on steroids,

996
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,959
or have done steroids,
and for somebody who wants

997
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,719
to portray themselves as
a fit and healthy person,

998
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,679
that's not at all healthy.

999
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,799
People go, "Ahh, steroids," man...

1000
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,879
Nobody can do that.

1001
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,679
Like, it's not easy to do.

1002
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,159
People don't respect it,
they go, "Oh, I can do that

1003
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,639
with steroids," no, you couldn't.

1004
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,119
You couldn't do what I do!

1005
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,039
They come to the gym,
never did a workout,

1006
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,719
and then they find
on the internet...

1007
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,199
steroids... they sell
steroids on the internet.

1008
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,943
Children, 15, 16 years
old, they order it...

1009
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,639
That's what I hate... it's
dangerous, very dangerous.

1010
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,439
If you do something extreme,

1011
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,879
you can't be healthy,
you gotta take some risks.

1012
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,159
So it's like, you
know, like racing...

1013
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,199
if you go Formula
One, you take the risk.

1014
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,199
Any time that you're using
performance enhancers,

1015
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,839
particularly when we haven't
studied them in the lab,

1016
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,839
to the level that they can be used,

1017
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,159
certainly, there can be
negative side effects.

1018
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,239
There is issues with kidney damage,

1019
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,079
there is, what we do know,

1020
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,039
is that the heart size increases

1021
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,279
because the heart is a
muscle, there's liver issues,

1022
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,639
it's quite toxic,
especially the oral drugs,

1023
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,959
that's why injectables are
one of the preferred drugs

1024
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,759
for minimizing health risks.

1025
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,039
I think the best answer
is to allow the athletes

1026
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,279
to use the drugs, but
provide medical treatment.

1027
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,519
Get a group of very
competitive athletes together,

1028
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,919
everyone wants to win,
you've got large sums of money

1029
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,679
up for grabs, guys are going to do

1030
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,159
whatever it takes to win.

1031
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,079
The bodybuilders and
the professional sport

1032
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,999
of bodybuilding has
gone the next step.

1033
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,599
Where all of a sudden,
the body does not look

1034
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,279
as acceptable, simply
because it's too big,

1035
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,599
and it doesn't have
any talent behind it.

1036
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,479
And the neck is 23 inches
and the calves are 18.

1037
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,439
The proportion is gone.

1038
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,839
The audience wants
to see a spectacle.

1039
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,959
When they go to see a
show, they don't want to see

1040
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,719
someone that looks like them,

1041
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,799
they want to see something extreme.

1042
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,119
So we have to get huge.

1043
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,639
We have to go to the next level.

1044
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,519
You know, is there
a limit to growth?

1045
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,639
Certainly, there's a limit,

1046
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,639
but I don't know that we found it.

1047
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,039
They ask the Olympic athletes,
if you could take a drug,

1048
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,759
right now, that would
kill you in five years,

1049
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,319
but guarantee you a gold
medal, would you take it?

1050
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,159
More than 50 percent said "Yes!"

1051
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,959
They would take it, even knowing it
would kill them five years later.

1052
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,199
This is what these athletes do.

1053
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,919
This this their lives.

1054
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,239
This is their livelihood,
this is how they make money.

1055
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,879
This is everything they know.

1056
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,839
Do you really think you're
gonna convince them to stop?

1057
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,239
As time progresses, the
science of bodybuilding

1058
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,999
advances faster and
faster, and with it,

1059
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,628
the size of the muscles.

1060
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,628
One more major title this year.

1061
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,079
One down.

1062
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,559
One to go!

1063
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,799
Three, four, five, six...

1064
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,039
Come on, one way!

1065
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,839
Eight, nine...

1066
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,639
Ten!

1067
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,279
Every rep count!

1068
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,999
Every rep, come on!

1069
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,119
Bring the pain!

1070
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,908
- Six, seven, eight, nine...
- Fight it!

1071
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,279
My physique that I bring
to the Olympia this year...

1072
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,959
it's not the product of
three months of hard work,

1073
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,191
it's the product of over
20 years of hard work.

1074
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,519
I thought I'd be retired
by now, originally.

1075
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,759
I thought by 36, 35-36, I'd be...

1076
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,319
I'd be retired, but...

1077
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,839
You know, I think I've
had so many injuries,

1078
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,279
I've had four significant injuries,

1079
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,719
since I've been pro,

1080
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,079
and I think that set me back.

1081
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,719
When you work out, do you
feel sore the next day?

1082
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,119
You rebuild pretty
quickly, right, I mean...

1083
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,039
Yeah, man, I get sore as fuck.

1084
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,559
I think when people say
they don't get sore, man,

1085
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,399
that's 'cause they're
not continually

1086
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,239
pushing their limits, you know?

1087
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,319
If you push it as hard as
you can push it every day,

1088
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,439
and you don't go to failure
and go beyond what you've done,

1089
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,079
then you're gonna get sore.

1090
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,839
Guys like Ronnie, they
got bigger every year.

1091
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,439
Dorian, you know, all
those guys that are trained

1092
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,079
to annihilate the muscle, you know,

1093
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,639
they came in bigger
and better every year.

1094
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,347
So, that's the difference.

1095
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,199
Due to injuries, Branch had to skip

1096
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,159
the 2010 and 2011 Olympias.

1097
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,187
Despite this, he continues to
live his life to the fullest.

1098
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,999
Branch, a few competitors said
that, "if you're gonna keep

1099
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,639
working out the way
you're doing at the gym,

1100
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,959
you're going to get injured
before the big competition."

1101
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,119
What do you think about that?

1102
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,879
They're entitled to their opinion.

1103
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,799
But, you know, I can
imagine who that was,

1104
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,639
and they ain't gonna
beat me anyway, so...

1105
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,239
they don't really matter.

1106
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,399
And the thing is, the
past two injuries I've had

1107
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,599
weren't in the gym, they
were outside the gym.

1108
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,279
So, I haven't been
hurt in the gym since...

1109
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,879
2003.

1110
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,461
C'mon.

1111
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,950
Let's go!

1112
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,879
Oh!

1113
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,079
Goddamn!

1114
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,279
Ouch!

1115
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,862
Son of a bitch!

1116
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,679
Goddamn, guys.

1117
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,159
The filming stops.

1118
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,119
Branch's hamstring is injured.

1119
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,987
His future at the
Olympia is now uncertain.

1120
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,759
I just know that the end
of a bodybuilding career

1121
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,439
is one injury away... one
major injury and you're toast.

1122
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,199
No matter how hard you work,
and how perfect you are,

1123
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,159
one injury and you're done.

1124
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,559
The days of being in the dungeon,

1125
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,959
training with your hoodie on,

1126
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,319
you know, "grunt and
cuss" bodybuilder,

1127
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,359
that eats, sleeps and trains...
that's all he does... are over.

1128
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,039
You have to be able
to do other things.

1129
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,279
I'm more focused now on my career,

1130
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,999
but of course I think
about the years after it

1131
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,719
because, I don't want to be like,

1132
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,559
"Okay, now it is over,
so let's think about

1133
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,119
what I can do now."

1134
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,919
Of course, it would be
nice if I could get some

1135
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,279
roles in the movies,
things like this.

1136
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,759
I just got a call
for a casting tomorrow

1137
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,279
for an action film, so we'll see...

1138
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,719
They're gonna fly me in...

1139
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,359
The movie star!

1140
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,559
...with a private jet.

1141
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,959
I don't want to waste my time

1142
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,959
trying to be an actor or something,

1143
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,759
if I don't have
the talent for this.

1144
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,359
There some that
have the personality.

1145
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,159
When I started doing
interviews in the '70s,

1146
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,799
the media always said,
"Finally there's someone

1147
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,839
that loves to talk
about the sport,"

1148
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,639
because for years we
tried to get interviews

1149
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,359
and everyone just said,
"No, I'm not going to talk,"

1150
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,999
because they were
always shy characters,

1151
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,919
and they'd rather live
in a dungeon and work out,

1152
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,519
and were very impressive,
but they didn't want to talk,

1153
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,719
they felt too shy about it.

1154
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,199
All these guys say they
want to be like Arnold,

1155
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,199
and be in the movies,
and stuff like that.

1156
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,559
Sometimes, it's like pulling teeth

1157
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,679
to get these guys to talk.

1158
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,439
So, imagine giving them a script

1159
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,351
they actually have to read.

1160
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,079
- Hi.
- Hi.

1161
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,159
How you doing... oh!

1162
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,959
Dennis, nice to meet you.

1163
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,919
So, Emilio Ferrari is
directing this movie,

1164
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,239
and we're gonna start
shooting it in October,

1165
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,039
but it is a comedy,
and it's kinda like

1166
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,199
"Private Benjamin"
meets "Legally Blonde."

1167
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,839
So we can have fun with this,

1168
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,399
and if you want to
try something new,

1169
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,719
or have improv or anything,

1170
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,861
don't feel that you
can't do that, okay?

1171
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,319
- So, you are reading for Robert.
- Robert, right.

1172
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,359
Hello, I'm Robert...

1173
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,919
Hello, I'm Robert Starkey.

1174
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,742
Wow, you really love this country.

1175
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,679
- So, here's what...
- Uh... the United States.

1176
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,919
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1177
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,639
Let's try it again,
now there are some parts

1178
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,279
where you are
coughing and mumbling,

1179
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,279
you know like, you're...

1180
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,999
So play that a little bit.

1181
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,879
Hello, I'm Robert Starkey.

1182
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,079
If you sign this right
now, I can't guarantee it...

1183
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,159
I can't guarantee,
by this time tomorrow

1184
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,679
you will be in sunny Puerto Rico.

1185
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,759
That was really good and
we're probably gonna have

1186
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,159
callbacks, which I'm
gonna bring you back

1187
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,759
to the director,
and that was funny.

1188
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,639
So just take it and work on it,

1189
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,279
and we'll see each other later.

1190
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,279
Thank you very much, it was great.

1191
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,519
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1192
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,465
- Thank you.
- All right, take care.

1193
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,799
While playing
basketball in college,

1194
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,079
Phil realized that he would
never play professionally,

1195
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,839
but there was
potential in his genes,

1196
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,079
potential that led
him to another sport.

1197
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,319
That's right.

1198
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,799
I would say quitting
basketball, I mean...

1199
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,839
It wasn't really
quitting, I'll be honest,

1200
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,119
I just wasn't good enough
to play at the next level.

1201
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,399
Those dreams, as far as
like, playing in the NBA,

1202
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,159
were just... they were squashed.

1203
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,159
- This is Phil Heath.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

1204
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,025
Good to meet you.

1205
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,639
At times, nostalgia kicks in.

1206
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,079
He loved to play ball just as much

1207
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,039
as he loves bodybuilding now.

1208
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,719
When the opportunity
presents itself,

1209
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,439
Phil enjoys to return to the court

1210
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,159
to shoot some hoops.

1211
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,039
When I decided to be a
bodybuilder and quit basketball,

1212
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,439
I actually marked down the date,

1213
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,359
it was October 8th, 2002,

1214
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,679
and then the rest is history...
I got bit by that bug,

1215
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,159
and it was an amazing
feeling to know that,

1216
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,359
coming from a team sport...

1217
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,959
You know, you're
being more concerned

1218
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,239
with not just yourself, but
your teammates all the time,

1219
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,999
and going against a
different type of opposition.

1220
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,559
Playing basketball, as
opposed to bodybuilding,

1221
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,142
where it's really
all about my effort.

1222
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,799
Pittsburgh, a city
with more than blood

1223
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,679
running through its veins.

1224
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:37,599
Sweat, steel, and hard work
pulse at its heart as well.

1225
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,839
It's home to Jim
Manion, the president

1226
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,479
of the International Federation
of Bodybuilding & Fitness Pro.

1227
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,879
The chairman of the
National Physique Committee,

1228
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,799
Jim acts as a father
of sorts to many

1229
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,319
of the greatest bodybuilders,
Phil Heath among them.

1230
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,919
You're on the road so much
because you're so popular,

1231
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,839
where the other guys
that are chasing you,

1232
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,679
they're not getting as
many guest appearances,

1233
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,079
store appearances from
the sponsors, et cetera.

1234
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,439
So they're at home training
where they're comfortable.

1235
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,679
Different priorities take
over in your life too.

1236
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,119
Your family, you want to spend
more time with your family.

1237
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,599
You know, they're ticked off.

1238
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,519
I don't have any children
of my own, you know,

1239
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,319
but like, my wife and I, we talk about
it and it's like, what's gonna happen?

1240
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,359
You know, I have a
stepson, but he's old enough

1241
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,759
to fend for himself.

1242
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,439
But I can already tell,
just by having two dogs

1243
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:28,239
that the minute I'm gone,
they tear everything up.

1244
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,079
See this?

1245
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,559
Touch this.

1246
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,919
Whoa!

1247
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,199
Say, "I'm bigger than you."

1248
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,399
Show him yours.

1249
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,639
All right, Phil, I'm not gonna give you
any advice you don't already know.

1250
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,079
We talked already about bringing the
same condition you did last year.

1251
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,519
Everybody's gonna be chasing you

1252
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,359
so you don't have to
worry about getting bigger

1253
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,679
than this guy or
smaller than that guy.

1254
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,719
So, just kinda go back
and do what you do.

1255
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,079
Yeah, I don't have
to reinvent the wheel.

1256
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,999
Bring it again and
hope for the best.

1257
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,119
For me, as Mr. Olympia,
it's not about beating

1258
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,879
your competition, it's
about crushing those dreams

1259
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,839
of those other guys... and
that's what I've got to do,

1260
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,944
I've gotta crush their dreams.

1261
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,439
It's a gloomy afternoon.

1262
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,799
Victor travels to the
Bev Francis Powerhouse Gym

1263
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,879
in Syosset, New
York, to see a legend,

1264
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,799
his mentor, Steve Weinberger.

1265
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,999
Today is his judgment day.

1266
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,639
- Hey, what's goin' on, brother?
- 'Sup, Steve?

1267
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,439
- How you doin'?
- Good, good, how you doin'?

1268
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,639
I'm okay, how you feel?

1269
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,919
I'm okay, I've felt better.

1270
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,319
Yeah... how's it coming along?

1271
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,399
I don't feel confident.

1272
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,879
Let me close the door...
too much noise out there.

1273
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,599
As soon as I got out,
I started training,

1274
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,039
and getting back on my regimen...
the training's been good,

1275
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,519
everything's been good, no
injuries, you know, and, uh...

1276
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,399
Everything's good, it's
just, is it "Olympia good"?

1277
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,279
Is it "Olympia ready"?

1278
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,942
- Let's see what you look like.
- All right.

1279
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,519
For Rikers Island,
you look great, Vic,

1280
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,719
but for the Olympia...

1281
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,399
I don't think you'll have enough
time, honestly, I'm sorry.

1282
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,999
If I was you, I would shut it down,

1283
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,359
and just concentrate on next year.

1284
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,346
I don't think there's
enough time, I'm sorry.

1285
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,479
How you feelin', Victor?

1286
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,039
I just don't want
to talk, right now.

1287
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,319
Please, c'mon.

1288
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,599
Hey, V.

1289
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,199
Yeah, I just saw Steve.

1290
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,919
Yeah, I decided I'm
not doing the show.

1291
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,639
He's a guy that's gotten no breaks, with
his sister getting murdered, and...

1292
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,439
this is his second
time in jail, and...

1293
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,799
just all these problems,
it just seems that...

1294
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,919
You never know why some good people

1295
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,999
never get breaks,

1296
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,679
and some bad people get breaks.

1297
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,799
And Victor is one of those good
guys that never get a break,

1298
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,144
and I feel bad for
him, I really do.

1299
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,159
Hide lives a solitary
life in Venice, California,

1300
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,999
near the beach.

1301
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,519
When he looks across the water,

1302
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,439
he sometimes imagines
he can see home.

1303
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,239
Though he is married, he
spends most of his time

1304
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,439
separate from his wife,
who often travels to Japan

1305
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,839
to take care of his family...
a family that has never fully

1306
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:43,159
accepted his life path,
nor fully understood it.

1307
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,719
They don't watch my shows,

1308
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,599
but they call me and I call them.

1309
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,919
It's a really hard sport.

1310
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:58,187
For me, my thinking is that
they can't enjoy their life.

1311
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,879
I was born, born to be bodybuilder.

1312
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,439
I'm a bodybuilder until I die.

1313
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,279
I hope that one day
my family understands.

1314
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,199
People thought that
it's just impossible

1315
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,039
for Japanese or Asian people

1316
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,907
to step on Olympia stage...

1317
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,399
Because of their structure
or genetics, I don't know...

1318
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,599
I wouldn't say I'm
small 'cause I'm 5'5".

1319
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,399
But I weigh 220,
which is pretty heavy.

1320
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,519
Olympia.

1321
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,119
Nice... are you gonna win?

1322
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,879
- Say yes.
- Yeah, I will.

1323
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,079
Yeah, say "I'm gonna
win the Olympia!"

1324
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,866
Yes I will.

1325
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,479
Come on.

1326
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,359
- You do a couple negative?

1327
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,879
Do a couple negative,
hold it, resist me, resist.

1328
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,079
Resist, let's go.

1329
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,479
Let's go, come on, man!

1330
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,079
Good job, Hide, come on, come on!

1331
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,319
All the way down, all the way down.

1332
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,759
All the way down, and up.

1333
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,959
One more.

1334
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,799
Hold it. Resist me.

1335
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,879
Resist!

1336
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,079
Come on!

1337
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,519
Let's go.

1338
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,559
All the way down.

1339
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,439
I mean, the whole
game is about quality.

1340
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,271
This is the way you are.

1341
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,519
Most of them, no
disrespect, but some of 'em,

1342
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,199
they don't follow that elegance.

1343
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,119
I see your moves
are really artistic

1344
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,279
and I think that's what
bodybuilding is all about,

1345
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,159
being an artist.

1346
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,547
Let's see.

1347
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,799
Unreal, just keep it like...

1348
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,439
careful.

1349
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,239
Beautiful.

1350
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,319
Exhale.

1351
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,799
When you hit it, exhale.

1352
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,039
Then all that detail
right in the middle.

1353
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,639
Right, good.

1354
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,919
See?

1355
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,919
Looks like the base is good

1356
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,959
and everything flows.

1357
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,119
If you don't see
it in your mind eye,

1358
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,199
you can just forget it.

1359
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,479
You got to believe.

1360
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,279
I know for sure that
Hide does believe.

1361
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,799
And I mean, we're not pretending.

1362
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,399
I mean, look at this guy.

1363
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,919
He's just amazing.

1364
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,519
So, I really used
to dream about this.

1365
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,599
When I came out here, I mean,
I had some people saying,

1366
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,039
like, "You're not gonna win
the Olympia, are you crazy?

1367
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,839
No way, this is impossible."

1368
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,599
It's not impossible.
Everything is possible.

1369
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,759
Here you got a guy from
the Middle East region,

1370
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,599
and not to brag about
it, I'm the only one

1371
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,559
from that part of the
world to win the title,

1372
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,239
and you got Hide from the Far East.

1373
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,759
I tell you, he's this
close, he's this close.

1374
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,039
I challenge you to
win the Olympia, man.

1375
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,599
Come on.

1376
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,119
I'm still, you know,
challenging the title.

1377
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,228
If I'm a champion, I would say
there will be a lot of pressure.

1378
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,519
There's always that pressure...
you gotta be your best,

1379
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,119
'cause you're only as good as your
last contest, in our sport...

1380
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,279
No matter how well you placed at the
last show, if you do poorly at this one,

1381
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,839
this is the one
everybody remembers...

1382
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,439
I think that's why
a lot of guys fail,

1383
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,039
is because there's
so much pressure.

1384
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,319
Sponsors drop you.

1385
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,439
I better be ready, you know.
I better be ready to bring it.

1386
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,519
Here we go!

1387
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,599
Fight!

1388
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,679
Perfect!

1389
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,799
Make 'em grow!

1390
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,159
Here we go.

1391
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,439
No pain, no pain.

1392
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,519
Fight!

1393
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,719
That's it!

1394
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,479
You got this, man, no pain!

1395
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,199
As a competition looms
in the near future,

1396
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,959
the pressure builds.

1397
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,959
Training and rigorous routines
take a toll on the body,

1398
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,519
as well on the mind.

1399
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,719
Each bodybuilder seeks
out different ways

1400
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,382
to alleviate the stress.

1401
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,159
You know what you're getting?

1402
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,839
I'm gonna get a sushi
and sashimi combo.

1403
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,279
I need no avocado,
and no fake crab.

1404
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,839
I'm gonna do the
spicy teriyaki chicken.

1405
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,159
And can I add extra chicken
to that, or double chicken?

1406
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,879
And then I wanna do the TWT roll

1407
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,319
and plus the titty roll.

1408
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,199
Okay, thank you very much.

1409
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,279
The what roll?

1410
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,439
Titty.

1411
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,399
- Titi.
- Oh, titi, sorry.

1412
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,999
I'll take this outta your way.

1413
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,399
So how clean you... we gotta
keep it real tight tonight.

1414
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,359
Oh yeah, oh yeah, man.

1415
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,999
That's one of the
things I find separates

1416
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,319
the good bodybuilders from the
great bodybuilders is an appetite.

1417
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,759
I'm not sure why, I
haven't figured it out,

1418
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,599
maybe it's just the sheer
amount of calories they get in,

1419
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,439
but the best
bodybuilders in the world

1420
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,279
eat a lot of food.

1421
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,479
Right now, I'm about 4,000,

1422
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,279
off season I try to get in 7,000.

1423
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,559
Like, if you wanna just
grow, you can go up eight

1424
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,039
to ten thousand, as long as
you're training hard enough.

1425
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,879
I think a lot of bodybuilders
are apt to getting discouraged

1426
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,639
and what not 'cause I
think a lot of us have

1427
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,479
a little bit of muscle dysmorphia.

1428
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:47,719
You know, never big enough,

1429
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,439
you're never lean enough.

1430
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,479
Think about the people that
are drawn to bodybuilding.

1431
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,839
You always got some type of...
either you're really skinny

1432
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,359
as a kid or you got picked on.

1433
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,959
You got some type
of body image issues.

1434
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,639
Yeah, great point.

1435
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,759
What day you coming to Vegas?

1436
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,119
Thursday.

1437
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,359
If you need me to bring anything out
there, if you need anything on my end,

1438
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,359
you know, especially during
the two days before the show

1439
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,839
or the day of the show.

1440
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,159
I'm actually expecting
to probably have

1441
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:19,519
at least 50, probably 70 of
my close friends at the show.

1442
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,079
Like, people who have
been my biggest supports

1443
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,919
since I even started competing.

1444
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,679
I think the place is gonna go nuts for me,
man, and that just lifts you on stage.

1445
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,079
Just stay relentless, bro, rig ht?

1446
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,159
Stay hungry.

1447
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,719
As long as you keep focused.

1448
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,439
Like, right now, never
been so focused in my life.

1449
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,279
If I can continue with
this for the next...

1450
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,679
until the Olympia, I'm
gonna be, by far, my best.

1451
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,439
And then if I can continue
with this type of focus

1452
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,159
until next year, I'll
be unbeatable, man.

1453
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,839
I really believe that
I'll bring a package

1454
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,990
that nobody can touch.

1455
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,119
Is there anybody
that you're worried

1456
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,799
about competing against?

1457
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,279
There's probably two guys
in the world who, I think,

1458
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,559
if they bring their best, and I
bring my best, they can beat me.

1459
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,239
Other than that,
nobody's gonna beat me,

1460
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,639
so I just gotta come with my best.

1461
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,559
I want everybody to
bring their A game,

1462
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,479
and if somebody beats
me, I'll shake his hand,

1463
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,790
'cause he outworked me, but
I don't see it happening.

1464
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,839
I met Phil at a mutual
friend's restaurant

1465
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,759
after his second
bodybuilding competition,

1466
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,759
that he won his class, but
he didn't take the overall.

1467
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,879
And I just knew,
like, I just saw the...

1468
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,759
what he was working for, that
he was gonna become great,

1469
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,559
and that everything
was gonna go for him.

1470
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,279
And he's like "Really...
you really think I'm gonna

1471
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,999
make it that big?" and
I said, "Absolutely,

1472
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,719
I think you're gonna
go all the way."

1473
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,639
I'm glad I have a
family that can go

1474
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,679
on this journey with me, I'm not going at
this separate, and them just watching.

1475
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,159
They're there.

1476
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,119
They'll be there.

1477
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,439
I'll have the list for
tickets for you by tomorrow.

1478
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,759
Did you spell my name right?

1479
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,959
I'm just kidding.

1480
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,799
So here's the thing
with Phil and I,

1481
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,519
we always got along, man...
I've never had a problem

1482
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,359
with him... I was
in Denver last year,

1483
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,279
we went out to dinner,
and then I leave,

1484
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,799
and I hear he was talking
shit... and I was like,

1485
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,039
"Okay, you're a scumbag...
you say one thing in my face

1486
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,919
and something else to
my back," that's fine.

1487
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,719
And to me, that says he's
insecure and he's scared.

1488
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,599
I don't respect his work ethic.

1489
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,839
I don't respect him as a
person, with his attitude.

1490
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,199
But he's become an
excellent bodybuilder.

1491
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,399
He's not a very good
role model for the sport.

1492
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,039
Is he as dominant as
everybody thinks he is?

1493
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,719
No, he's not... but I've
seen him train and I'm like,

1494
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,079
"Man, his back sucks,
his calves suck,

1495
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,079
his hamstrings suck,"
man, that stuff,

1496
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,279
you fix it like this, like, I can't build
muscle nearly as easily as that guy,

1497
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,639
and yet I'm doing it, you know?

1498
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,541
It ain't all talk when
you're on that stage, man.

1499
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,319
Phil Heath has had a lot of gifts.

1500
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,679
He's a gift, he's "The Gift."

1501
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:59,959
I don't represent
gifts, I really don't.

1502
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,759
He's had a lot of
help, a lot of help.

1503
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,639
It's not like I had people
handing me money and stuff.

1504
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,639
When I first came into this sport,
I was working two jobs, unlike him.

1505
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,279
I don't even know
if he has a resume...

1506
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,999
I don't even know if
he knows what that is.

1507
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,279
Easy, easy.

1508
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,239
Guess what, Kai?

1509
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,559
You've been bodybuilding
for 20 years.

1510
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,079
I'm already better than you.

1511
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:30,639
You know it, but now you're making an
excuse, saying, "He got this, he got that."

1512
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,199
Each man's body
will represent years

1513
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,068
of focus and concentration.

1514
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,503
It'll be a great event.

1515
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,999
You're one injury away
from your career being over.

1516
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,919
I've fought too hard
to get where I'm at,

1517
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,599
to slide back down.

1518
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,519
I'm not one to lay
down and cry about it.

1519
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,679
I'm gonna take this
thing by the horns,

1520
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,639
I'm gonna overcome it... I'm
doing everything I can do,

1521
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,666
man, I'm 100 percent.

1522
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,559
Have a dream.

1523
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,559
Everybody need to have a dream.

1524
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,347
Have a dream and go after
it with everything you got.

1525
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,319
Time to make Phil look
small, bro. Come on!

1526
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,439
Make 'em all look small.

1527
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,862
Yup.

1528
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,759
They're gonna announce my
name, crowd's gonna go crazy,

1529
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,999
I'm gonna hit my front
double bicep, this and that.

1530
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,519
Crowd's gonna go,

1531
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,039
"Whoa!"

1532
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,919
And I'm gonna just...

1533
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,839
I'm gonna feel...

1534
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,439
like a true Adonis,
man, like a god.

1535
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,868
But this trophy is mine.

1536
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,119
Come on, take your shirt off.

1537
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,519
Yo, who do you think
was the best ever?

1538
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,599
Best ever?

1539
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,679
Arnold or Lee?

1540
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,759
Arnold.

1541
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,959
Arnold was better than Lee Haney?

1542
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,399
Of course.

1543
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,519
That's a big statement
to say on camera!

1544
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,319
How many, how many
Olympias has Arnold got?

1545
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,399
Seven.

1546
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,479
How many Lee got?

1547
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,719
- Eight.
- Eight.

1548
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,039
So who will be better?

1549
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,119
Arnold, still Arnold!

1550
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,839
Hold on, wait a
minute, so we go back...

1551
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,719
Then you gotta go with what
century you was in or what...

1552
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,199
It doesn't matter how
many Olympias he won.

1553
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,279
It doesn't matter?

1554
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,359
Doesn't matter.

1555
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,799
Who's had the best, what year...

1556
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,319
Who had the best chill body ever?

1557
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,439
Ronnie Coleman.

1558
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,759
Ronnie Coleman?

1559
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,519
He was a good one.

1560
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,719
All right, big...
hold on, one thing!

1561
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,799
Let's arm wrestle.

1562
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,119
You lost!

1563
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,399
Oh!

1564
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,959
Olympia, a plain in Greece
in the western Peloponnese.

1565
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,159
The ancient Olympic Games
were said to be played

1566
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,399
on this stretch of ground,

1567
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,999
and it held the chief sanctuary
of the supreme god, Zeus.

1568
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,159
Now on a stage in
Vegas, the supreme man,

1569
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,185
Mr. Olympia, will be crowned.

1570
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,399
When I go back and I
think of the Olympia,

1571
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,679
I go back and I think
of Arnold Schwarzenegger,

1572
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:06,439
when the first prize
money was $1,000.

1573
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:09,079
And then today, in
the 48th Olympia,

1574
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,599
we're hoping to
give out prize money

1575
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,159
of one million dollars.

1576
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,319
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1577
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,359
Welcome to Joe
Weider's Olympia fitness

1578
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,989
and performance weekend 2012!

1579
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,999
Just before the competition,

1580
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,639
the contenders begin their
pre-show preparations.

1581
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,639
The most agonizing is
dropping their water weight.

1582
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,879
We always need to lose
a little bit of water

1583
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,799
in the last couple of
hours before the show

1584
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,319
because on stage,
with all those lights

1585
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,959
and the tan and the oil, you
still look a little watery.

1586
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,079
If you lose the water,
it makes you look

1587
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,639
on stage much, much dryer
because all the cuts,

1588
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,599
all the separation, coming through

1589
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,239
more and more, you know?

1590
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,759
Now I'll introduce
the 19 competitors here

1591
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:02,399
to vie for the
title of Mr. Olympia.

1592
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,479
Before Olympia, a
press conference is held

1593
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,199
for the contenders.

1594
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,399
For the first time,
but not the last,

1595
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,265
they are on stage together.

1596
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:27,599
What do you think about people
saying Phil can't be beat

1597
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,559
at this year's
Olympia tomorrow night?

1598
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,399
I don't give a damn
about what people say.

1599
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,639
I think I'm a better
poser than Branch.

1600
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:46,519
Well, I think I'm a better
bodybuilder than Dennis.

1601
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,159
This is a bodybuilding contest,
not a dance contest, baby.

1602
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,719
Going into tomorrow night,

1603
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:57,799
I'm crossing my
fingers, praying to God

1604
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,959
that I can be at my
best, because my best

1605
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,159
will be good enough
to win another Sandow.

1606
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,359
No question.

1607
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,799
I'm happy I'm here,
I worked hard for it.

1608
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,279
You'll see the best package
you've ever seen tomorrow night.

1609
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,439
If you and Phil Heath are
100 percent on game day,

1610
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,079
who wins?

1611
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,759
I expect to be the last
man standing this year.

1612
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:42,199
A fallen warrior
arrives in Las Vegas.

1613
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,039
It pains him to be a spectator,

1614
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,319
for this sport and its contenders

1615
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,439
have been his most constant family.

1616
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,959
My phone used to ring
off the hook, you know?

1617
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:55,799
Now it's a little quiet
and it's... damn, you know?

1618
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,359
Am I taking it personal?

1619
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,039
It's like you really
can't, you know?

1620
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,239
It's what it is.

1621
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,959
Remember, it's... it's a business

1622
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,919
and if you're not producing,

1623
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,199
they could just drop
you, and that's something

1624
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,759
I might have to do as
well, go into my next show

1625
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,799
without a sponsor,
and that's gonna be

1626
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,479
one of the biggest
challenges of my life,

1627
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,319
not just coming back from injury

1628
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,439
or coming back from seven
months of being incarcerated,

1629
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,359
it's gonna be competing
as a free agent.

1630
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,519
That goes into the
whole question of,

1631
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,039
"Does politics exist
in bodybuilding?"

1632
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,399
It's alive and well.

1633
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,959
The hypocrisy is
part of the business,

1634
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,302
it's part of it.

1635
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,279
The makings of a
champion are elusive.

1636
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,439
Is it in the genes?

1637
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,199
Are some destined for greatness

1638
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:53,119
while others doomed to mediocrity?

1639
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,399
Or is a warrior made,
forged out of steel,

1640
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,319
honed from oak and
chiseled from the stone

1641
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,479
of his skilled hands?

1642
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,959
The Mr. Olympia Competition

1643
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,039
has been sanctioned
by the IFBB since 1965.

1644
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,399
It alone decides who is
the best in the world.

1645
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,479
Come on, Branch.

1646
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,879
I didn't even get to pump up!

1647
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,679
Can someone bring me some
dumbbells or something?

1648
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,439
We're back at the 2012 Mr. Olympia.

1649
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,999
I'm Lane Norton with
my co-host, Larry Pepe,

1650
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,239
and Larry, we talked about...

1651
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,359
is this the beginning
of a run for Phil?

1652
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,479
If he hits it tonight,
do you think he starts

1653
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,719
to put these guys
more in his rear view,

1654
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,359
and start to build on that momentum

1655
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:37,919
and maybe get three, four,
five, six Mr. Olympias?

1656
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,919
I think coming in, we thought
the question for Phil is:

1657
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,479
Is this gonna be that
type of performance

1658
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,799
where you just look
up there, you see him

1659
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,359
and you say, "it's him,"

1660
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,239
and everybody else kinda
battling out for second?

1661
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:55,279
I think we now feel that
it's him and Kai Greene.

1662
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,799
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know,

1663
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,559
the Mr. Olympia final
results will be based

1664
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,199
on a combination of both tonight's

1665
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,839
and tomorrow's scores.

1666
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,119
The lights flash.

1667
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,985
The pre-judging begins.

1668
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,199
There's just something
to be said for the dude

1669
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,959
that can...

1670
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,839
Man, he can...

1671
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,319
He can run up in there with an arm

1672
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,959
tied behind his back and still...

1673
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,144
he's still a deadly dude.

1674
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,984
Man, you still gotta
watch out for him!

1675
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,999
And even with that,

1676
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,879
this dude is still
fighting for his life.

1677
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,959
And then...

1678
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:50,359
slowly...

1679
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,830
persuade the masses
to start to favor him.

1680
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,759
When you line up the
best in the world,

1681
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,559
it's so easy to judge.

1682
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,159
When you're right there in person,

1683
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,759
you see everything.

1684
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,559
Sometimes a photographer
will take a picture

1685
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,599
and Phil's looking great,
Jay doesn't look great,

1686
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,319
or Kai or Branch,

1687
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,199
you need to see it all together

1688
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,399
and also, it's not the clearest
of quality on the internet,

1689
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,999
not like in living color.

1690
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,867
Being there and seeing
it, it's pretty easy.

1691
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,359
Phil Heath and Kai
Greene, right off the bat,

1692
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,639
seem to separate
themselves from the pack.

1693
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,639
Those two clearly,
Number One and Number Two.

1694
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:40,319
If there was any question,

1695
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,599
we answered that in
the final call-out

1696
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,399
when they were the only two
brought back, center stage.

1697
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,359
I think there's a lot of
support out there for Kai Greene,

1698
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,719
there's a lot of people who think

1699
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,599
that he's winning this contest.

1700
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,919
Listen to me, you beat
him every freakin' shot.

1701
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,239
Hands down.

1702
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:01,679
Hands down, okay?

1703
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:04,439
And the feeling
was, he was terrible.

1704
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,599
He was picking your best shots too,

1705
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,279
side triceps,

1706
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,919
Back double biceps, you
frickin' creamed him.

1707
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,879
Do you really think that, George?

1708
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:17,319
You have the frickin'
edge, would I lie to you?

1709
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,159
It's Mr. Olympia,
the best of the best.

1710
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,759
You saw it.

1711
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,879
Once you start, you know?

1712
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,959
That was getting close

1713
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,399
with the whole Kai thing and...

1714
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:26,799
Kai starts good,

1715
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,439
he started getting better

1716
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,959
until he becomes great and then,

1717
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,279
and then you shave it
down to the top guys

1718
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,439
and those top guys
were Phil and Kai.

1719
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,279
The drama came in there,
'cause first you go,

1720
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,079
"Okay, yeah, you know, Phil's
walking away with this,"

1721
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,639
then you look, you go,

1722
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,759
"Wait a minute, this is
getting closer than I think."

1723
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,719
The more you look,
the closer it got.

1724
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,399
I mean, I don't know how
much tighter I can get.

1725
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,439
I wouldn't try to get
fuller if I was you.

1726
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,319
Thank you.

1727
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,199
I mean, really.

1728
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:03,639
There's no way I could
be any tighter than I was.

1729
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,839
I mean, I lose room all
the way up past my hip.

1730
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,479
What else can I do?

1731
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,189
I mean, you tell me
where I can be tighter.

1732
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,279
I think I was tighter
than last year,

1733
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:20,279
easily, easily but...

1734
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:24,519
I think what I presented
was good enough for the win.

1735
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,119
But we'll wait and see.

1736
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,782
- Want some water, champ?
- No, I'm good.

1737
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,864
Not always gonna
hear what you want.

1738
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,639
So that's when you exit.

1739
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,347
Because you don't need to
hear negativity right now.

1740
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,279
If anything, I like to be the guy

1741
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:52,479
that smiles, plays
nicely, you know?

1742
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,319
But I'm trying to
take your head off

1743
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,599
just like anybody else.

1744
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,759
Don't sleep!

1745
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,999
Okay, now I am starting
to get irritated,

1746
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,519
like, I can't deal with
that shit right now.

1747
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,119
You know what I'm saying?

1748
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,959
I can't think like that right now.

1749
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,319
That shit has no
importance whatsoever

1750
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,039
to me winning this show.

1751
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,519
We won last year
with a perfect score.

1752
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,559
It'd be nice to try to do it again.

1753
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,759
It would be nice, I mean,

1754
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,639
I don't know if that's Hany's goal.

1755
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,079
That's mine.

1756
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,639
It's always a goal to try to win.

1757
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,319
To win, perfect score.

1758
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,519
I mean, this is definitely
a hard focus right now,

1759
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,919
there's no soft focus at all.

1760
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,279
Like, this is
definitely very serious.

1761
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,159
When you start stressing,
your body starts changing.

1762
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,839
And just... and a lot of people

1763
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,279
who've done competitions have
looked absolutely amazing,

1764
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,639
and then, all of a sudden,
the stress hormone kicks in,

1765
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,119
and their bodies
just kinda fade away

1766
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:02,439
and they don't
understand what happened.

1767
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:05,719
This is not where you
let off the gas, either.

1768
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,381
I'm gonna have to get going.

1769
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,919
Catch your breath, that's right.

1770
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,039
- Huh?
- Catch your breath.

1771
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,119
Come on!

1772
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,599
That's right.

1773
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,261
Yeah, if you want.

1774
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,719
I know I'm the champ.

1775
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:35,319
I don't have to keep saying it.

1776
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,719
They know I'm the champ, too.

1777
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,559
My title is Mr. Olympia.

1778
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,879
Theirs isn't.

1779
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,879
And they're trying to get there?

1780
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,919
They've gotta fight me all day.

1781
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:49,184
There's no way I'm gonna lose.

1782
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,839
The champ takes a moment to drive

1783
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,959
through the streets of
Vegas to clear his head.

1784
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,639
The most important
battle of his life

1785
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:14,119
lies here moments away.

1786
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,305
The battle that will define
him as a competitor forever.

1787
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,839
As you know, it's Olympia weekend.

1788
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,839
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

1789
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,919
bodybuilding fans
from around the world,

1790
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:02,679
welcome to the 48th
edition of the fall classic,

1791
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,439
the Mr. Olympia!

1792
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,319
For those that was here last night,

1793
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,199
you saw one of the most
exciting pre-judgings

1794
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,879
in Olympia history.

1795
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,399
Because once again, folks, only one person
can hold the Sandow and only one man

1796
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,301
will be crowned Mr. Olympia.

1797
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,119
Mr. Olympia is my
dream, my life dream.

1798
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,399
I can't think of anything else

1799
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,359
that will ever happen to me again in
my life that will mean as much to me,

1800
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,039
because it was
nothing but sheer will,

1801
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:09,464
determination, and stubbornness.

1802
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,719
I knew from the time I was 18

1803
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,559
what I wanted to do in life.

1804
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:16,279
I set goals for myself.

1805
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,519
I've accomplished every
goal I set out for myself,

1806
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,479
except for one, and
that's win the Mr. Olympia.

1807
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,719
I'm training for this title,
I want to win this title.

1808
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,079
My daughter is my biggest fan,

1809
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,879
she's always at the Olympia,

1810
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,199
she always wants to be there

1811
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,279
and I won my first show

1812
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,679
where my wife and my daughter

1813
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,159
were together there watching us,

1814
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:44,039
and that was amazing,
you see the girls crying,

1815
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:46,781
because they are so
happy, it's amazing.

1816
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,359
You know, in Japan,

1817
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,639
nobody really
challenged it before me.

1818
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:59,839
I thought I was going to
be the first one really

1819
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,999
to challenge the top.

1820
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,839
I want to prove that bodybuilding

1821
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,785
is not all about size.

1822
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,119
It's a dream for every bodybuilder

1823
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:19,559
to stand on the
stage for Mr. Olympia.

1824
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,359
It was my dream.

1825
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,359
It was my dream,
and I make it true.

1826
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,942
Everybody can make it
true if you want it.

1827
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:35,479
From Brooklyn, New
York, comes a predator.

1828
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:38,239
Ladies and gentlemen, Kai Greene!

1829
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,199
When I was younger

1830
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:44,799
I'd leave the cold
institutional facility,

1831
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,319
go to a bodybuilding show,

1832
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,959
and I'd stand there on stage

1833
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:52,679
with athletes, teenagers,
that had people at home

1834
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,959
invested in seeing them succeed.

1835
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:58,559
You'd hear a very proud mom or pop,

1836
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,279
sitting in the third or fourth row

1837
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,199
and then there was
you, no mom, no dad,

1838
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,999
there's nobody gonna be
sitting in the audience,

1839
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,359
proud of you, but you were proud.

1840
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:17,900
You took pleasure in
beating those guys that did.

1841
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,639
He's your reigning and
current Mr. Olympia,

1842
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,919
"The Gift," Phil Heath!

1843
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,319
They only nitpick the best.

1844
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,919
They only criticize the best.

1845
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,039
They do!

1846
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,479
In all sports, they do.

1847
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,319
Because it's hard for someone
to say, "He's just perfect

1848
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,999
and we'll never talk about him".

1849
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,786
They have to say something!

1850
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,879
Did they announce it?

1851
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,781
- Did they announce the Top 10?
- No.

1852
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,867
I'm just gonna go.

1853
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:06,119
As I call you out, that
means you're in the Top 10,

1854
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:10,119
if you need to go see
Pro Tan, get greased up,

1855
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,039
go down and do it, then
we'll get you up there.

1856
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,279
In numeric order,
please, gentlemen.

1857
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:16,519
Can I have Branch Warren,

1858
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,279
Tony Freeman,

1859
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,039
Johnnie Jackson,

1860
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,319
Evan Centopani,

1861
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,279
Lionel Beyeke,

1862
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,359
Dexter Jackson,

1863
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,119
Shawn Rhoden,

1864
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,799
Dennis Wolf,

1865
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,199
Kai Greene,

1866
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,239
and Phil Heath.

1867
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,199
Once again, Branch, Tony,
Johnnie, Evan, Lionel,

1868
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:41,039
Dexter, Shawn,
Dennis, Kai and Phil.

1869
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,599
That's our Top 10,
thank you, gentlemen,

1870
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:45,159
we should have you on
stage in roughly 20 minutes.

1871
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,199
Roelly, sorry, brother.

1872
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,599
Fuel for next year, baby!

1873
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,067
Come back next year.

1874
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,079
All right, let's bring out
our Top 10 back on stage.

1875
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,479
Gentlemen!

1876
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:09,959
Hey, we've got one more call.

1877
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,079
I need Phil and Kai back.

1878
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,021
That's gonna be it, group.

1879
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:28,262
Okay, now.

1880
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,319
Quarter-turn to... no,
wait, hold on, stop it.

1881
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:38,279
No, wait, stay back on
the line both of yous.

1882
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:42,307
And do me a favor, take
two steps to your right.

1883
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,199
Do me a favor, take a
step apart from each other,

1884
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:55,039
there's plenty of room.

1885
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,599
Gotta stay on the
same side, come on,

1886
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,399
a little bit of room between yous.

1887
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,559
Come on, Phil, take one
more... yup, thank you!

1888
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,079
Okay, now, front.

1889
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,025
Front double bicep.

1890
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,150
Come on now, front double bicep.

1891
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,239
And relax.

1892
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,663
Relax, front lat spread.

1893
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,105
Okay, both, front lat spread.

1894
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:34,959
And relax.

1895
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,269

1896
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,399
And relax.

1897
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,901
Back double bicep.

1898
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,839
And relax.

1899
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,102
Face forward.

1900
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,424
Your favorite most muscular.

1901
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:25,559
And relax... and relax.

1902
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:28,319
Okay, thank yous very much.

1903
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:31,187
This concludes our
confirmation round.

1904
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,799
All right folks, here we go.

1905
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:41,679
Are we ready for the awards?

1906
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,879
Aileen, please take
the sixth-place award

1907
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,950
to our sixth-place finisher.

1908
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,639
Dennis "Big Bad" Wolf!

1909
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,639
The fifth-place award,

1910
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,471
Branch Warren!

1911
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,919
The fourth-place award,

1912
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,759
"The Blade," Dexter Jackson!

1913
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,599
The third-place award,

1914
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,944
"Flexatron," Shawn Rhoden.

1915
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,759
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
in Olympia tradition,

1916
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:21,991
Kai Greene, Phil Heath,
center stage, please.

1917
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:38,660
Ladies and gentlemen, we
had a one-point decision.

1918
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,959
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next name I announce

1919
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:50,719
will be the winner of
the 2012 Mr. Olympia!

1920
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,028
Come on, baby!

1921
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:59,439
When I did find myself in
institutional placement,

1922
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,547
the cold, oppressive
feeling of, like...

1923
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:12,199
Like you don't matter
and you may never,

1924
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:16,879
ever, ever matter again.

1925
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:21,159
I began to talk about competing
in the Olympia one day.

1926
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:25,221
I really did not develop Plan B.

1927
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:31,199
But I didn't, I didn't.

1928
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:36,719
I didn't just talk
about it, it's like...

1929
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,951
I really believed that
it was gonna happen.

1930
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:46,559
Phil Heath!

1931
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:23,669
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Olympia, Phil Heath!

1932
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,839
I didn't get any sleep, trust me,

1933
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,359
over the past 48
hours, because I knew

1934
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,839
that these guys were all champions

1935
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:36,359
and I knew they were bringing it.

1936
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:39,519
Man, it feels freakin' good
to be king up in here, man.

1937
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,639
I can't even lie.

1938
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,999
Did you feel nervous for a
second, like it was close?

1939
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,239
Did you feel at any point nervous?

1940
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,679
I think I was more
nervous yesterday.

1941
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,559
'Cause I felt that
after the first round,

1942
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,719
I thought it was lights
out, and I kinda eased up

1943
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:54,359
off the gas, and that
kind of allowed Kai

1944
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,639
to get more confidence
and to start making up

1945
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,959
ground on me, and it showed.

1946
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,759
I mean, I could tell.

1947
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:03,639
And it was like the
power was going to him.

1948
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:06,759
Well, today I realized
what his game plan was,

1949
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:09,999
and I just figured, I
gotta let it all hang out.

1950
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,679
This is my town, this is my show,

1951
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:14,199
this is my title,
this is my throne.

1952
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,919
And I refuse to give it to anybody.

1953
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:17,839
They're gonna have
to fight me for it.

1954
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,239
I know that I pushed
him to his best look,

1955
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:24,279
and I knew I'm gonna go
against their biggest punch,

1956
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:27,319
but like I said, wait
till I punch back.

1957
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:28,399
What's next for Phil Heath?

1958
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,639
What are you gonna do?

1959
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,199
We're gonna party tonight, man.

1960
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,271
We're gonna party.

1961
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:27,159
The title was within his grasp.

1962
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,399
A point away.

1963
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:32,824
The smell of victory
teased his nostrils.

1964
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:08,839
You know, no one's
gonna give you anything.

1965
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,468
You gonna have to work for it.

1966
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:16,879
I didn't come there
expecting gifts.

1967
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,269
I came there willing
to work for it.

1968
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:27,639
And I believe that any man

1969
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:31,279
that is willing to
work hard and labor long

1970
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:34,959
can attain the goal, as
long as it's realistic.

1971
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,479
I've seen enough
feedback that lets me know

1972
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:42,144
that this is not unrealistic,
it's not impossible.

1973
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,239
We got a chance to
see the champ bleed.

1974
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:50,639
And he bled.

1975
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,983
He's still bleeding.

1976
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:59,679
Whatever can be forced to
bleed against its own will

1977
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:04,039
can be killed, it can
die, it can be beaten

1978
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:07,271
and you know, um...

1979
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:16,959
We got more work to do, you know?

1980
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,985
