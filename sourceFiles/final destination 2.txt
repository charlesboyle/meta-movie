1
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:18,133
<i>Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary</i>

2
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:20,969
since Velez Sir Flight 180
exploded and crashed

3
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,305
shortly after takeoff
from JFK airport.

4
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:25,473
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

5
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:28,310
None more so than
Mt. Abraham High School,

6
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:32,480
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,316
But it was the events
after the crash

8
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,151
<i>that has turned
this tragic story</i>

9
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:38,286
<i>into something even
stranger.</i>

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,023
<i>The survivors who managed to get
off the plane before it crashed</i>

11
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:44,125
<i>died soon thereafter
in a series</i>

12
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,661
<i>of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.</i>

13
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:50,098
<i>Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,</i>

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,167
<i>but to others,
they're an indication</i>

15
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,802
<i>that there are more
sinister events taking place.</i>

16
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,838
<i>That's the contention
of tonight's guest.</i>

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,007
<i>Thank you for joining us
this evening.</i>

18
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,475
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

19
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,577
<i>And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.</i>

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,247
<i>Most people say supernatural
because they think I'm talking</i>

21
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:08,549
<i>about ghosts and witches
and stuff like that.</i>

22
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:11,286
<i>Here's your chance
to set the record straight.</i>

23
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,788
<i>Great. Okay.</i>

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,458
<i>I believe that there's
a sort of force,</i>

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,462
<i>an unseen malevolent
presence...</i>

26
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,464
<i>That's all around us
every day.</i>

27
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:26,902
<i>And it determines
when we live and die.</i>

28
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:31,472
<i>And some people call
this force the devil,</i>

29
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:34,142
<i>but I think that
whole religious thing is--</i>

30
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:37,478
<i>so I prefer to call it
death itself.</i>

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,148
<i>So I'm surrounded by death?</i>

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,317
<i>Absolutely. Absolutely.</i>

33
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,820
<i>Every day, everywhere,
all the time.</i>

34
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,489
<i>And that's what I want people
to understand--</i>

35
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,491
<i>that death
has this grand design</i>

36
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,660
<i>that we all fit into.</i>

37
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:55,496
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

38
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,665
and took the other
survivors with him,

39
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,268
he basically screwed up
death's plan.

40
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,104
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

41
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:06,274
<i>And the fact that all
of the survivors have died</i>

42
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:08,410
<i>is your evidence of this?</i>

43
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:13,114
<i>Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,</i>

44
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,216
<i>but it's the way
that they died.</i>

45
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,786
<i>I mean, there were
so many weird,</i>

46
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:21,656
<i>seemingly random things
about the way they died.</i>

47
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:25,460
<i>It just didn't
make sense.</i>

48
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,463
<i>And that's the proof
there's something out there--</i>

49
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:32,200
<i>Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation</i>

50
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:35,337
<i>of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.</i>

51
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:37,472
<i>Kimberly.</i>

52
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,807
<i>You should be more
open-minded about--</i>

53
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,677
<i>What happened after
that was just coincidence.</i>

54
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,612
<i>May I finish?</i>

55
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:47,815
<i>Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.</i>

56
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:50,151
<i>But not all of them
including their teachers.</i>

57
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:52,653
<i>Yes, but
people die all the time,</i>

58
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:55,190
<i>so why should this be
any different?</i>

59
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:57,658
It forced people
to question

60
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,261
these so-called
everyday coincidences.

61
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,263
What if they
were something more?

62
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,432
What if you could do
something about it?

63
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,302
Please, are you listening
to yourself? This is crazy.

64
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:10,671
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

65
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:13,441
<i>That's exactly
what I'm saying.</i>

66
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,776
Exactly it.

67
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,678
And in order to survive--

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,181
<i>the only way to survive</i>

69
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:22,517
<i>is to look beneath
the visible world.</i>

70
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,521
Because in the end no one
can escape death.

71
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:29,090
And today may be your day
to die.

72
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,471
Okay, I'll call you.

73
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,640
Kimberly, are you sure
you've got everything?

74
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,808
Credit card,
cell phone, triple-a card?

75
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,311
Dad, it's Daytona,
not Somalia.

76
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:54,149

flares, sunblock, mace?

77
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,584
Condoms, whips, chains.

78
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,320

79
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,256

I'll keep an eye on her.

80
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:03,858

a lot better, thanks.

81
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,328
- Okay.

82
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,698

83
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,769

00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,696
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-o is coming.

173
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,798
- Let's fucking roll.
- What?

174
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,220
Oh my God.

175
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,900
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me?

176
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,802
- Huh?
- Dano, just shut up!

177
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:43,237
Just stay cool.

178
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,514
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.

179
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:08,929
What's going on here?

180
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,331
I think there's going
to be a huge pileup.

181
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,433
I saw it.

182
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,435
There were bodies
everywhere.

183
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,437
There were logs--
I saw it.

184
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,106
It just happened.

185
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,409
All right, miss, I'd like you to
please step out of the vehicle.

186
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,489
Just pull over!

187
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:37,892
I know,
mommy's hungry, too.

188
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:43,630
Come on.

189
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,100
Come on!

190
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:48,135
Oh, fuck this.

191
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,405
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

192
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,152
Fuck.

193
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,521
What the hell
is going on up there?

194
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,056
<i>Excuse me!</i>

195
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:11,726
Is there any way
that we could drive around?

196
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:12,698
- I have a delivery--

197
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:14,729
- You need to get back
into your vehicles.

198
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,530
- Just move it--
- now!

199
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,537
That's it!

200
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,174
That's the truck that's
going to kill everybody.

201
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,976
<i>You need to stop
that truck!</i>

202
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,911
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

203
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:33,513
<i>- Why won't you listen to me?!</i>

204
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,352
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

205
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:48,129
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance

206
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:50,798
and backup for a major
traffic accident...

207
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Kimberly, what's going on?

208
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,195
No!

209
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,615
Listen, sir, this girl
is really freaked out.

210
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:44,419
In fact, all of them are
scared as you can imagine.

211
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:45,119
Scared?!

212
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:48,455
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

213
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:49,957
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis--

214
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,792
yesterday the kid wins
the lotto.

215
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,794
Today, some loony bitch
blocks traffic

216
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,796
and he avoids the worst
pileup in years.

217
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,631
I should be
so damn "unlucky."

218
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,133
Go babysit the rest
of them.

219
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,901
I'll be done with Lewis
in a minute.

220
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:04,071
Hey, excuse me--

221
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,906
We're trying to do
the best we can.

222
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,575
We're going to get you out
of here as soon as possible.

223
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,178
<i>I just think it's
a bunch of bullshit.</i>

224
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,086
Listen, I know
you've gone over all this

225
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:20,855
with detective Suby...

226
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,359
But would you mind
telling me what happened?

227
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,029
It was like
I was there.

228
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,202
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

229
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,406
I just felt wrong,
just like...

230
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:40,774
Just like what?

231
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,282
Look, I know
this sounds crazy but...

232
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,650
You guys all heard
about flight 180, right?

233
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,652
<i>The kid who got off
the plane?</i>

234
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,922
Well, it happened
a year ago, today.

235
00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:00,127
My premonition
was just like his.

236
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,134
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Come on.</i>

237
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,903
You must have read
about the kid

238
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:10,905
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

239
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:12,907
so he got all his buddies
off the plane

240
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:15,642
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

241
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:18,145
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?

242
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,581
So a month goes by,
right?

243
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,617
Everything seems cool.

244
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,721
But then all the survivors
start to die one-by-one.

245
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:30,357
'Cause when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

246
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:37,431
You know, some people even say that
death itself was stalking them,

247
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,766
hunting each one down

248
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:43,370
until they were all...
Dead.

249
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:48,909
Please.

250
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:52,712
<i>There was one survivor.</i>

251
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:56,616
Clear Rivers is in
a padded room

252
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:59,420
at the Stonybrook
Institution.

253
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:01,021
Well, that's encouraging.

254
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:06,560
<i>Okay, you want me
to believe this is true,</i>

255
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,396
<i>that this is happening
all over again?</i>

256
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,498
I don't know
why we're even here.

257
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,734
What do you want from me?

258
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,604
But if I was never meant
to pull over,

259
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:20,140
we all should have died
in that pileup.

260
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,409
Which means death
could be coming for us.

261
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,311
<i>Yeah, like...</i>

262
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:27,781
What if we're all getting that
"different strokes" curse or something?

263
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:30,584
I think you're all
are certifiable.

264
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,786
I can't believe I've been
listening to this crap.

265
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:35,589
<i>Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.</i>

266
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,359
Mrs. Carpenter,
please.

267
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,032
Kimberly!

268
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,302
Oh baby!

269
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:52,106
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

270
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,673
Shh, shh.

271
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:56,110
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.

272
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,632
Could I ask you something?

273
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,135
Anything.

274
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,970
Did mom ever have any...

275
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,574
I don't know, weird
feelings about anything?

276
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,377
What do you mean?

277
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,583
Like visions
or premonitions.

278
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:40,154
Sweetie, are you sure
you're okay?

279
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,989
Dad, I know
this sounds crazy,

280
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,325
but I'm really scared
for the others.

281
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,096
I don't know, I have
this really bad feeling.

282
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:51,932
What?

283
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,602
It's not over yet.

284
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:20,794
Jesus Christ!

285
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,729
Shit!

286
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:56,156
<i>Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.</i>

287
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:58,158
<i>Sorry I haven't called.</i>

288
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,927
<i>Hey, listen, I heard
about your lottery win.</i>

289
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,630
<i>Let's hook up.
Call me.</i>

290
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,099
<i>Yeah.</i>

291
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,934
<i>Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.</i>

292
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:10,170
<i>We met at Tucker's party
last year?</i>

293
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,939
<i>I know it's been awhile, but
I've been thinking about you.</i>

294
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,609
<i>I just wanted to say congratulations.</i>

295
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,644
<i>- So give me a call.</i>

296
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,879
<i>555-0123. Bye.</i>

297
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,517
You little bastard.

298
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,151
Shit.

299
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,892
Come on.
Come on.

300
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:42,269
Fuck. Fuck.

301
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,381
Come on!

302
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:56,149
Come on.

303
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,090
Fuck!

304
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,425
Jesus!

305
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:14,568
Oh!

306
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,510
<i>Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.</i>

307
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:26,112
<i>If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,</i>

308
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:28,948
<i>and I don't know
when he's coming back. Thanks.</i>

309
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,886
<i>Evan, call me when you
get in, you lucky fuck!</i>

310
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,684
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

311
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:05,385
Aah!

312
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,317
Jesus!

313
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:43,557
Come on.

314
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:53,266
Aah!

315
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,871
<i>Shit, I'm lucky.</i>

316
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,175
Aah!

317
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,213
Jesus Christ!

318
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,234
No, mother,

319
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,438
just turn on any station.

320
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,274
Well, I don't know how you
missed it, it's been on all day.

321
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:43,944
Yes, mother,
channel 4 is fine.

322
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:47,113
Okay-- here it is!
I got to go, okay?

323
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:48,982
I got to go!

324
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:51,952
To recap our top story,

325
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:55,622
route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.

326
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:58,792
A record-breaking pileup
killed an estimated 18 people.

327
00:27:58,794 --> 00:28:01,895
Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage

328
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:05,064
<i>hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.</i>

329
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:08,134
<i>So far police are refusing to
release the names of the victims</i>

330
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:09,903
<i>until the families
are notified.</i>

331
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,638
<i>The camera
of a highway patrol car</i>

332
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,607
<i>managed to catch
this shocking footage.</i>

333
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,742
<i>- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.</i>

334
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,911
<i>And smashes
into a red SUV.</i>

335
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:21,581
<i>- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um...</i>

336
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,082
Leave it.

337
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,584
<i>...may have
saved her life.</i>

338
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:26,520
<i>He pulled her back
at the last second</i>

339
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:28,421
<i>just as the semi plowed
into the vehicle.</i>

340
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:30,256
<i>The passengers inside
the SUV...</i>

341
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,359
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!

342
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:37,397
In other news, a freak accident
took the life of a lotto winner.

343
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,265
<i>- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.</i>

344
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:43,102
<i>Was on top of the world after
recently winning $250,000.</i>

345
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:45,872
<i>But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today</i>

346
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:48,542
<i>while trying to escape a fire
in his apartment.</i>

347
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:50,376
He managed to make it out
of the building,

348
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,612
<i>but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape</i>

349
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:54,614
<i>slipped and impaled him.</i>

350
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:57,116
<i>Investigators believe Lewis
died instantly.</i>

351
00:29:04,391 --> 00:29:07,326
<i>Come in.</i>

352
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:10,664
Hey, buddy.

353
00:29:12,232 --> 00:29:15,001
I want you to take this
so you can get some sleep.

354
00:29:16,904 --> 00:29:20,173
And then tomorrow it's off to the
dentist, which I know you love.

355
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:23,677
Now, get some rest.

356
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:30,917
- Mom.
- Yeah?

357
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:33,019
You think those guys
were bsing us today?

358
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,888
Yeah.

359
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,256
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

360
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,193
Lights out.

361
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,813
<i>At the request
of the patient,</i>

362
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,915
you'll relinquish
any sharp objects

363
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:45,318
such as: Nail files,
pencils, pens,

364
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,321
safety pins, bobby pins,
your necklace,

365
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,990
matches, lighters,
belts, belt buckles,

366
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,160
earrings, hair clips,
glasses, shoelaces,

367
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,297
paper clips, watches, money
clip, pocket knives,

368
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,999
food, drinks, keys,
cell phone--

369
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,268
you have a cell phone
on you?

370
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,271
--poisons, pills,
medications.

371
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,940
Great. And let me see
your nails.

372
00:32:07,942 --> 00:32:10,610
Good. Then I think
we're all done.

373
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:12,612
Wait.

374
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:14,614
Is she dangerous
or something?

375
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,549
No, honey,
she expects you are.

376
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:25,625
<i>Get him off me.
Get him off me!</i>

377
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,901
How long are they gonna keep
her locked up like this?

378
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:37,903
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

379
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:09,034
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.

380
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:19,245
They told me
you had something to do

381
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,946
with the crash on route 23.

382
00:33:20,948 --> 00:33:23,949
Look, I don't know how
to explain it,

383
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:27,219
but I saw the pileup
before it happened.

384
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,890
And I saved some people.

385
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:33,192
And now you think death
is after you.

386
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:37,163
Nice work.

387
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:40,366
Maybe if you're real lucky,
you'll wind up in here with me.

388
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:43,736
Anything else?

389
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:46,306
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

390
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:48,474
What if the other people
are in danger, too?

391
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:50,910
If you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

392
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:53,279
List? What list?

393
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,448
Death's list.

394
00:33:57,984 --> 00:34:00,252
The survivors of flight 180

395
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:02,588
died in the exact order

396
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,358
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

397
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:08,528
That was death's
original design.

398
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:11,631
The list.

399
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,200
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

400
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:15,935
So you're telling me
that I'm next?

401
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:18,204
You said someone else died
last night.

402
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,306
That means someone must
have intervened.

403
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,644
Officer Burke pulled me away from
the crash that killed my friends.

404
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,612
Congratulations.

405
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,281
You'll be the last to go.

406
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:31,951
But don't worry,
once the others are dead,

407
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:33,553
it'll come back for you.

408
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:36,956
It always does.

409
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,959
This doesn't make sense.

410
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:44,397
You said that you die in the order
you're originally meant to.

411
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,334
<i>But my friends died last
in my premonition, not first.</i>

412
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,269
Wait.

413
00:34:51,472 --> 00:34:53,740
Dead last?

414
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:57,744
Backwards.

415
00:34:57,746 --> 00:34:59,746
Are you sure?

416
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:03,583
<i>In my premonition</i>

417
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:05,585
<i>that Nora woman
and her kid died.</i>

418
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:08,688
<i>Then Evan,
then me and my friends.</i>

419
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:13,860
Why is this even
happening to me?

420
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:20,700
That's what Alex used
to ask himself.

421
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:24,771
So, what am I
supposed to do?

422
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,706
Clear.

423
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:30,276
Watch out for the signs.

424
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:31,944
What?

425
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:37,950
Have you ever seen anything
creepy or ominous?

426
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:40,219
An in-your-face irony
kind of thing?

427
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:45,124
The songs on the radio.

428
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:48,461
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

429
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,396
<i>Well, don't ignore it.</i>

430
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,164
Recognizing those signs
usually means

431
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,199
the difference between
life and death.

432
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:56,736
You got to help me.

433
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,471
I don't have
to do anything.

434
00:35:58,473 --> 00:36:00,239
<i>But you beat it.</i>

435
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,074
Take a look around.

436
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,009
What did I beat, Kimberly?

437
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:08,280
If you were smart,
you'd save yourself

438
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:09,715
and just forget
about the others.

439
00:36:09,717 --> 00:36:12,384
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

440
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:14,587
My friends are dead.

441
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,522
That's how I can say that.

442
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:21,761
This is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

443
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,931
Get out.

444
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,866
Before you hurt me
or yourself.

445
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:34,173
- All right, you know what?
- What?

446
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:35,641
I think you're a coward.

447
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,343
<i>You hide out in here
because you're</i>

448
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:40,613
too damn bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

449
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,515
In my opinion,
you're already dead.

450
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:22,688
<i>I tried calling
you last night,</i>

451
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,757
but your father said
you were sleeping.

452
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:26,425
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.

453
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:29,929
I've been getting calls all morning
from everyone who was on the on-ramp.

454
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:32,131
We're meeting tonight
at my apartment.

455
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:36,602
Wait, so... You believe
all this death stuff?

456
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:39,271
Well, at first,
no, I didn't.

457
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:41,440
Until last year
when I was dispatched

458
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:43,809
to clean up one of the
flight 180 survivors.

459
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:45,545
Clean up, I don't--

460
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,718
- did you see that?
- See what?

461
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,287
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?

462
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:57,289
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

463
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,124
If Clear's right about
the order,

464
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:02,361
then Nora and Tim are going
to be attacked by pigeons.

465
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,963
I'm not following you.

466
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,731
They're next
on death's list.

467
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:08,167
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

468
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,984
<i>The doctor's ready
for you, now.</i>

469
00:38:57,986 --> 00:38:59,885
If he gives me the gas

470
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:02,054
and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned...

471
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:05,591
- We ain't paying.
- Tim.

472
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:15,067
There you are.

473
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:17,069
What happened
to you yesterday, Tim?

474
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:18,141
We missed you in here.

475
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,572
We got hung up by that
accident on route 23.

476
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,175
Good lord.
How lucky that you're okay.

477
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,113
Your mom says you've been
having some pain lately.

478
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,314
Not really.

479
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:56,608
I'm a bit
disappointed, Tim.

480
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,893
Does your mom know
you've been smoking?

481
00:39:58,919 --> 00:39:59,578
Uh-huh.

482
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,280
Ow.

483
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:03,515
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

484
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,318
Damn those pigeons.

485
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,089
How many times am I going to have
to replace those goddamn windows?

486
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:15,460
<i>We can't
do it, boss, we can't do it!</i>

487
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:18,164
This will only sting
for a moment.

488
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,465
Open big.

489
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:22,134
Little bit wider.

490
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:24,136
Wider.

491
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:26,572
Okay.

492
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:29,975
<i>Oh God.</i>

493
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,911
How do they
expect me to...

494
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:34,580
Would you rather just have
the laughing gas?

495
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,916
- Yeah.
- Okay.

496
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:38,718
Jean, I'm going
to need you in here.

497
00:40:41,354 --> 00:40:43,522
You're have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

498
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:48,660
<i>What?! I can't hear you!</i>

499
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:50,730
<i>Excuse me, what?!</i>

500
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:54,834
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

501
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:57,669
Jean! Let me
get this started.

502
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,573
<i>Tim, you'll be awake
and a little groggy,</i>

503
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:03,675
<i>but you're not going
to be able to move much.</i>

504
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:31,303
Okay, great, thanks.
All right, turn around.

505
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:34,506
The cleaning lady said they're at the
Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

506
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:41,247
<i>Goddamn it anyway.</i>

507
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:50,823
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!

508
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:54,559
Not again. Careful.

509
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:37,602
There we go.

510
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,914
<i>Jean, how is
Tim doing in there?</i>

511
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:55,821
What did he say
about your tooth?

512
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,224
- Did he say--
- I can't remember.

513
00:42:58,226 --> 00:42:59,959
- Nora!
- The pigeons!

514
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:02,194
What? Pigeons?

515
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,998
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!

516
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:09,902
- No-oo!
- Tim!

517
00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:11,070
<i>Look out!</i>

518
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:15,241
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!

519
00:43:33,626 --> 00:43:35,961
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

520
00:43:35,963 --> 00:43:39,899
- No, but she's next--
- Right now I don't think she cares.

521
00:43:58,985 --> 00:44:01,186
This is really happening
again, isn't it?

522
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:05,590
I hoped we'd get there

523
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:07,592
and they'd be fine,

524
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:09,929
and Clear Rivers
was just full of shit,

525
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:13,698
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

526
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:17,869
But we're all going
to die, aren't we?

527
00:44:22,275 --> 00:44:24,209
I'm so scared.

528
00:44:25,645 --> 00:44:28,147
I know you didn't ask
for any of this...

529
00:44:29,582 --> 00:44:31,917
But I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

530
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,294
A second one just died.

531
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:44,029
A 15-year-old kid.

532
00:44:46,132 --> 00:44:48,200
I hope you're ready
for this.

533
00:44:59,913 --> 00:45:01,346
It's this way.

534
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:06,251
How is this guy
going to help us anyway?

535
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:08,753
He seemed to know
a hell of a lot more

536
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:10,689
about death
than he ever told us.

537
00:45:14,928 --> 00:45:16,929
Shouldn't we knock first?

538
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,198
He probably already knows
we're coming.

539
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:08,513
Hello, Clear.

540
00:46:14,587 --> 00:46:16,355
I've been expecting you.

541
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,290
Oh my God.

542
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:22,727
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?

543
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:25,864
Just a simple question and we'll leave
you alone with your new friend.

544
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,601
Dead...

545
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:32,371
Yet still fresh.

546
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,941
Look, we drove
a long way to get here,

547
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:38,043
so if you happen to know
how to stop death,

548
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,778
it would be really great
if you told us.

549
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:42,614
You can't cheat death.

550
00:46:42,616 --> 00:46:45,450
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.

551
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:48,387
You told me death
has a distinct design.

552
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,888
<i>But Alex
and I cheated death,</i>

553
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,790
<i>not once but dozens
of times.</i>

554
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:54,326
The design is flawed,
it can be beaten.

555
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:57,129
Such fire in you now.

556
00:46:57,131 --> 00:46:59,798
People are always
most alive

557
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,566
<i>just before they die.</i>

558
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,302
Don't you think?

559
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:21,453
Look, please...

560
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:31,263
If you know of anything
that could help us,

561
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,333
what harm could it do?

562
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:37,869
Only new life
can defeat death.

563
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:39,972
What the hell
does that mean?

564
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:44,376
Some people say there's a
balance to everything.

565
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:47,446
For every life
there's a death,

566
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,781
and for every death
there is a life.

567
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,650
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

568
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:55,087
<i>that can
invalidate the list,</i>

569
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:58,357
force death
to start anew.

570
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,900
You have to follow
the signs...

571
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:10,702
Kimberly.

572
00:48:13,072 --> 00:48:15,007
How do you know my name?

573
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:31,356
<i>- Whoa!
- Wait a second.</i>

574
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,426
"New life defeats death"?
"Follow the signs"?

575
00:48:34,428 --> 00:48:36,428
Where did you
find that guy?

576
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,263
I thought he was
supposed to help us,

577
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:39,664
not freak us out.

578
00:48:44,937 --> 00:48:46,604
What the fuck
are you thinking?!

579
00:48:48,608 --> 00:48:51,943
I'm thinking suck
on my junk, bee-atch.

580
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:53,711
Little punk.

581
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:07,692
What is it?

582
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,062
<i>- What did you see?</i>

583
00:49:23,642 --> 00:49:25,810
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

584
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:28,080
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.

585
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:30,182
What did you see?!

586
00:49:33,419 --> 00:49:35,253
I was driving a white van.

587
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:37,655
I don't know,
I must have lost control,

588
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:39,591
because I crashed
into a lake.

589
00:49:39,593 --> 00:49:41,793
- And I drowned.
- You were there?

590
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:44,662
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

591
00:49:47,933 --> 00:49:49,767
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

592
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:52,504
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

593
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:55,807
He said only new life
can defeat death.

594
00:49:57,443 --> 00:49:58,977
If she gives birth
to a baby

595
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,012
<i>that would've died
in that car crash--</i>

596
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:03,715
a brand new soul that was never
part of death's design--

597
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:05,383
it throws the whole list
out of whack

598
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:07,419
and we start over
with a clean slate.

599
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,536
It seems like a bit of a
reach, don't you think?

600
00:50:09,562 --> 00:50:10,788
What else could it mean?

601
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,924
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

602
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,093
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

603
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,663
We have to find her and warn her about the
lake so she can stay alive to have the baby.

604
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:21,866
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?

605
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:24,736
- There could be thousands of
white vans in the state. - Hey!

606
00:50:25,904 --> 00:50:27,639
I'm a cop, remember?

607
00:50:31,177 --> 00:50:32,677
Wait, that's it.

608
00:50:35,748 --> 00:50:37,482
Got it.

609
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:42,154
With the plate number
I can put out an apb.

610
00:50:42,156 --> 00:50:44,322
Here we go.

611
00:50:44,324 --> 00:50:46,324
The vehicle
is a delivery van

612
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:48,693
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

613
00:50:49,995 --> 00:50:52,164
<i>We should pick them up
pretty quickly.</i>

614
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,965
<i>Come on, let's get
to the meeting.</i>

615
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:10,549
Hey, hold the door!

616
00:51:11,984 --> 00:51:13,985
<i>Hey, let go of my shoe!</i>

617
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,720
Give me my shoe!

618
00:51:21,794 --> 00:51:24,762
I wrote to management two weeks
ago about these friggin' bumpers.

619
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:28,900
Is that dogshit, dude?

620
00:51:32,137 --> 00:51:33,838
Eww.

621
00:51:39,144 --> 00:51:41,246
Oh, you got something
on your...

622
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,586
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.

623
00:51:48,787 --> 00:51:50,622
No, it's all right.

624
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:54,759
I'll do it
if you want me to do it.

625
00:51:58,265 --> 00:51:59,964
Just let-- I'll--
let me do it.

626
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:03,868
What?

627
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,004
Hey, man,
how you doing?

628
00:52:07,006 --> 00:52:09,207
Listen, any word
on that white van yet?

629
00:52:10,943 --> 00:52:12,877
Okay, keep checking.

630
00:52:23,122 --> 00:52:24,956
Does anybody have a valium?

631
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,958
Oh, yeah.

632
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,793
Here.

633
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,296
You're just going to want
to take half of that.

634
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:32,764
Keep 'em coming.

635
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:37,302
If what you're saying
is true,

636
00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:38,970
that means I'm next.

637
00:52:38,972 --> 00:52:41,640
This is crazy, people,
come on.

638
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:43,808
First death
is stalking us,

639
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,244
and now premonitions?
What?

640
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,012
You're not next, Nora.

641
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:51,349
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

642
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:54,586
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

643
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,321
This cannot be happening.

644
00:52:56,323 --> 00:52:58,156
See, because my career
is at a peak

645
00:52:58,158 --> 00:53:00,258
and I finally met
a quality guy.

646
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,926
I just bought a house.

647
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,961
Maybe if you shut the
fuck up, you'll live.

648
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:07,499
Like I'm going
to take advice from you.

649
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:10,268
Okay, look,
if you know what to look for,

650
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,936
you have a fighting chance.

651
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:15,440
If I call and say,
I don't know-- subway--

652
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,709
get to a high-rise fast.

653
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,947
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

654
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,882
Get it?

655
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,455
<i>Okay, you guys, listen--</i>

656
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,624
just because Kimberly
has these visions,

657
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,459
it doesn't mean
we're not all capable

658
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,294
of seeing signs
to some extent.

659
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,095
<i>Okay, okay, look.</i>

660
00:53:38,097 --> 00:53:39,631
I gotta call bullshit.

661
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,466
I mean, I've sat here
and listened

662
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,468
to all your theories
and all your stories,

663
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,603
and I think it's just
all bullshit.

664
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:47,238
Call it what you want!

665
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,342
- It'll keep your ass alive.
- Darlin', my ass is alive!

666
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:52,210
Has been all day.

667
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:55,814
There is nobody after us
but you,

668
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,015
trying to make us all crazy.

669
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:13,998
I should have seen
that coming.

670
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,633
Yeah.

671
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:17,969
If death is out
to get you,

672
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:20,104
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

673
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:22,306
She's the only one that's
dealt with this before.

674
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:24,442
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

675
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:26,077
<i>Sleep in shifts.</i>

676
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,413
We need to safe-proof
this deathtrap.

677
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:40,124
Get you to step out
of the van, miss?

678
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:42,193
Are you kidding me?

679
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:45,296
<i>- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.</i>

680
00:54:47,466 --> 00:54:49,634
Ohh!

681
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:51,969
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

682
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:54,639
No, no, no,
it's not safe out there.

683
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:57,308
So, Nora's got to bite it
before me anyhow, huh?

684
00:54:58,412 --> 00:55:00,278
Oh, you people have
no sense of humor.

685
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:09,353
Nora, you okay?

686
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:13,691
Four years ago
my husband died.

687
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,928
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.

688
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,930
Don't say that,
okay?

689
00:55:18,932 --> 00:55:21,599
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

690
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,268
With my family,
I can accept that.

691
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:28,105
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.

692
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:30,107
If we just stick
together long enough

693
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:31,776
for her
to have her baby--

694
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:34,211
if you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

695
00:55:35,448 --> 00:55:37,048
Nora.

696
00:55:39,952 --> 00:55:41,786
What do you think
you're doing?

697
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:44,456
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.

698
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,458
Look, look.

699
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,560
I control my life,
all right?

700
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:52,797
Not some crazy list
death has put together.

701
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,999
I'll be sure to carve
that into your tombstone.

702
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:57,669
<i>Whatever. You may be
able to scare these people,</i>

703
00:55:57,671 --> 00:56:00,071
<i>- but I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.</i>

704
00:56:00,073 --> 00:56:01,739
- Hey.
- What?

705
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:04,843
Even if you don't believe,
give this to Nora.

706
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:17,689
I'm just going
to put this in the...

707
00:56:18,924 --> 00:56:20,558
Closet.

708
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:51,689
Sorry.

709
00:57:08,106 --> 00:57:10,008
Whoa.

710
00:57:20,085 --> 00:57:22,020
Man with hooks?

711
00:57:23,255 --> 00:57:25,089
Man with hooks.

712
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:27,458
Hey, I think I see
a man with hooks.

713
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:30,862
Is that...

714
00:57:32,431 --> 00:57:34,331
<i>- A sign?
- Oh my God.</i>

715
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,100
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.

716
00:57:36,102 --> 00:57:37,468
- The phone.
- Shit.

717
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,704
- Hello?
- Nora!

718
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:15,707
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!

719
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:18,509
Officer Burke,
I can't--

720
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:20,211
I can't hear you!
What?!

721
00:58:20,213 --> 00:58:21,445
What does he--
what?!

722
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:23,715
A man with hooks
is going to kill you.

723
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:25,249
<i>- What, what?
- Oh...</i>

724
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,918
What is it, Nora?

725
00:58:29,554 --> 00:58:31,055
No!

726
00:58:31,057 --> 00:58:33,457
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!

727
00:58:33,459 --> 00:58:35,392
Wait, wait, Nora!

728
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:37,495
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!

729
00:58:37,497 --> 00:58:38,896
Let me help!

730
00:58:38,898 --> 00:58:40,264
Let me go!

731
00:58:47,673 --> 00:58:49,807
Let go of me!

732
00:58:56,782 --> 00:58:58,650
Kat!

733
00:59:09,895 --> 00:59:11,863
Help me!

734
00:59:11,865 --> 00:59:14,398
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!

735
00:59:27,245 --> 00:59:29,147
Aah!

736
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:33,417
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.

737
00:59:33,419 --> 00:59:36,420
Isabella's being held at the
Greenwood Lake Sheriff's station.

738
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:38,756
<i>I'm in control of my life!</i>

739
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:41,092
- Kiss my ass!
- Eugene, what is it?

740
00:59:41,094 --> 00:59:43,127
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?

741
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:45,930
<i>- You hear me, you reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.</i>

742
00:59:45,932 --> 00:59:48,332
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!

743
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:51,302
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!

744
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:53,871
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.

745
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:55,973
<i>All right, give
me the gun, Eugene.</i>

746
00:59:55,975 --> 00:59:58,275
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!

747
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:01,445
Eugene, you just got
to relax, bro', okay?

748
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:03,581
You just got
to calm down, man.

749
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:05,482
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

750
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:08,485
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

751
01:00:08,487 --> 01:00:10,654
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!

752
01:00:10,656 --> 01:00:13,457
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!

753
01:00:13,459 --> 01:00:15,392
You hear me!

754
01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:18,329
<i>- God!</i>

755
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,207
Oh!

756
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,608
You don't keep it loaded?

757
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:34,779
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?

758
01:00:36,148 --> 01:00:38,149
Never.
That's impossible.

759
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:40,417
It wasn't his turn to die.

760
01:00:41,987 --> 01:00:44,588
Can we find the pregnant
woman, now, please?

761
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:53,898
<i>Is this safe, guys?</i>

762
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,467
I mean, someone in this car
is about to get whacked.

763
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:59,003
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

764
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:00,872
Or her?

765
01:01:02,274 --> 01:01:03,841
Hopefully her.

766
01:01:05,177 --> 01:01:07,078
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

767
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,982
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?

768
01:01:10,984 --> 01:01:13,284
You said she was going
to drive into a lake.

769
01:01:13,286 --> 01:01:16,087
How can she if she's
in protective custody?

770
01:01:23,796 --> 01:01:25,396
Look at me.

771
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:27,498
<i>Come on.</i>

772
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,633
Does it look like
I'm in the condition

773
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:32,136
to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.

774
01:01:32,138 --> 01:01:34,138
Look, hopefully
the district judge

775
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,008
will have it all sorted out
by Monday morning, okay?

776
01:01:43,648 --> 01:01:45,649
Marcus.

777
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:48,319
Marcus, Marcus.

778
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:50,654
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his--

779
01:01:52,658 --> 01:01:55,592
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?

780
01:01:55,594 --> 01:01:57,628
My water just broke.

781
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,663
<i>- What?
- My water, it just broke.</i>

782
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:02,433
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.

783
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:05,436
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!

784
01:02:05,438 --> 01:02:08,605
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!

785
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:11,943
I am not going to have my baby
in a jail cell!

786
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:13,711
Get me to the hospital!

787
01:02:13,713 --> 01:02:15,679
Okay, okay!

788
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:18,716
Sheriff Perry, this is
Deputy Adams, come back.

789
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:22,720
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

790
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:24,889
My van! My van!
Take my van!

791
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:28,960
Okay. Okay.

792
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:31,128
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.

793
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,064
Yeah, we'll go.

794
01:02:36,801 --> 01:02:38,502
Come on,
come on!

795
01:02:43,308 --> 01:02:45,843
<i>Y'all want to
hear something crazy?</i>

796
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,912
It's not the first time
I cheated death.

797
01:02:50,482 --> 01:02:53,484
A kid came to school
with a knife--

798
01:02:53,486 --> 01:02:55,253
killed his teacher.

799
01:02:57,155 --> 01:02:59,323
Teacher would have
been me,

800
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:03,094
but I was transferred to another
school two days before.

801
01:03:03,096 --> 01:03:05,296
That's fucking weird, man.

802
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:06,697
You want weird?

803
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,866
Last year my partner and I
were heading out

804
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,068
when a call came in
about a train wreck.

805
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,271
Frank decided
to let me handle it alone.

806
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,474
He died that night
in a shootout.

807
01:03:18,777 --> 01:03:21,946
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

808
01:03:21,948 --> 01:03:23,714
I'd be dead, too.

809
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,950
Oh my God.

810
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:27,952
I'm sorry.

811
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:29,653
It's just I got one, too.

812
01:03:29,655 --> 01:03:31,855
Okay, so last may
I'm supposed to go and stay

813
01:03:31,857 --> 01:03:34,625
at this cheesy little bed
and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

814
01:03:34,627 --> 01:03:37,628
Anyhow, there's this major
gas leak no one knows about,

815
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:40,131
and all the guests suffocated
during the night.

816
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:42,466
- So what happened?
- I don't know.

817
01:03:42,468 --> 01:03:43,257
I never made it.

818
01:03:43,283 --> 01:03:45,970
The bus I was on splattered
some girl over the road.

819
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:47,471
Was that in Mt. Abraham?

820
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:50,975
Yes. How did you know?

821
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:53,577
That bus you were on killed
Terry chaney.

822
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,248
She was supposed to die
on flight 180.

823
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:03,254
Hey, do you guys remember
that theater in Paris

824
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,023
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

825
01:04:07,926 --> 01:04:10,261
Well, I had tickets to go.

826
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,763
But one night I'm in Paris

827
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:16,100
and I'm just
tripping on acid

828
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,436
and sipping lattes
and such.

829
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,371
And then all of a sudden

830
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:23,607
this dude out of nowhere

831
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:26,110
just gets whacked
by this falling sign.

832
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,946
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

833
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,615
The teacher I replaced,
her name was Val Lewton.

834
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,618
She was from Mt. Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

835
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,621
Shit. The call about
the train wreck

836
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,290
that saved my life...

837
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,792
That was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

838
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:44,261
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

839
01:04:45,797 --> 01:04:47,731
The people who got off
of flight 180.

840
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,568
<i>They were my friends.</i>

841
01:04:55,107 --> 01:04:57,341
<i>Kimberly, tell us
what happened.</i>

842
01:05:00,578 --> 01:05:03,747
About a year ago my mom and I
were at the mall.

843
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:05,749
I was supposed
to meet her outside,

844
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:08,419
but I got caught up watching
this news report

845
01:05:08,421 --> 01:05:10,287
about some kid
that committed suicide.

846
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:13,590
I kept thinking,

847
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:15,926
"how can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

848
01:05:15,928 --> 01:05:17,861
That's stupid."

849
01:05:20,598 --> 01:05:22,599
It felt wrong.

850
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:24,368
And yet...

851
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:30,674
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

852
01:05:32,777 --> 01:05:35,446
Some kids were trying
to steal my mom's car.

853
01:05:35,448 --> 01:05:38,115
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

854
01:05:38,117 --> 01:05:40,184
and they killed her.

855
01:05:41,786 --> 01:05:44,088
<i>After the funeral
I kept thinking</i>

856
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:45,423
<i>that it should
have been me.</i>

857
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,892
I guess everyone must
think that.

858
01:05:50,795 --> 01:05:52,563
But I guess I was right.

859
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:03,006
Get there.

860
01:06:03,008 --> 01:06:04,875
Could you drive
a little faster maybe?!

861
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,610
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!

862
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,048
<i>When we got
off flight 180,</i>

863
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,085
it didn't just change
our lives.

864
01:06:14,087 --> 01:06:16,587
It affected everyone
and everything

865
01:06:16,589 --> 01:06:18,922
we've come
into contact with since.

866
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:20,891
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.

867
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:23,427
Being alive after
we were supposed to die,

868
01:06:23,429 --> 01:06:25,563
<i>it caused an outward ripple.</i>

869
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,531
A rift in death's design.

870
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:30,534
So if you had never
gotten off the plane...

871
01:06:32,104 --> 01:06:34,238
We wouldn't be alive
in the first place.

872
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,873
Yes, that's why death
is working backwards!

873
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:39,076
It's tying up
all the loose ends,

874
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,345
sealing the rift once
and for all.

875
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:04,768
Oh, shit!

876
01:07:06,904 --> 01:07:08,472
Jesus Christ!

877
01:07:11,176 --> 01:07:13,043
Hang on! Hang on!

878
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:35,533
- Is everybody all right?
- Oh God.

879
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:39,703
God, Eugene!

880
01:07:39,705 --> 01:07:42,806
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!

881
01:07:45,777 --> 01:07:47,444
No, please.

882
01:07:47,446 --> 01:07:50,347
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.

883
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:52,516
Do you want to deliver
this baby?

884
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:56,953
<i>Those people can help.
Let's go.</i>

885
01:07:58,623 --> 01:08:01,058
Officer Adams reporting
a vehicle collision

886
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,227
off 9-a
at the 180 mile-marker.

887
01:08:03,229 --> 01:08:05,128
Send all emergency vehicles
to the scene.

888
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:08,265
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

889
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:10,901
Just-- okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!

890
01:08:12,737 --> 01:08:15,673
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.

891
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,974
I think he has
a collapsed lung.

892
01:08:17,976 --> 01:08:20,511
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!

893
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:28,018
<i>Stay with us.</i>

894
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,486
Hey, hey you!

895
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:33,591
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.

896
01:08:33,593 --> 01:08:37,127
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, okay?

897
01:08:40,098 --> 01:08:41,565
I think it's okay.

898
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:43,934
I don't smell any gas
and nothing's dripping.

899
01:08:43,936 --> 01:08:46,770
All right, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.

900
01:08:46,772 --> 01:08:48,872
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?

901
01:08:50,442 --> 01:08:53,444
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!

902
01:08:53,446 --> 01:08:55,779
I got to be able to use
my legs when I'm done.

903
01:08:55,781 --> 01:08:57,814
I'm so-- dad!

904
01:09:04,055 --> 01:09:05,723
Eugene, everything's
going to be okay.

905
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,559
If he doesn't get a respirator,
he's not going to make it!

906
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,562
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!

907
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,330
Check the gauges
on the regulator,

908
01:09:13,332 --> 01:09:15,332
and watch out
for overdoses!

909
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:18,168
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.

910
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:22,105
And watch out
for power lines!

911
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:25,509
Watch it!

912
01:09:31,082 --> 01:09:33,584
You trying to get yourself
killed, little boy?

913
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,852
You got to use
your head, man.

914
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,323
Thanks.

915
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:48,732
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

916
01:10:05,082 --> 01:10:07,518
How is she doing?

917
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,553
I think she's going
to be okay.

918
01:10:12,457 --> 01:10:15,058
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

919
01:10:17,128 --> 01:10:19,129
When I die...

920
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,897
Is it going to hurt?

921
01:10:22,467 --> 01:10:24,234
I don't know.

922
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,571
You're going to die after me,
right?

923
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:30,574
Yeah, I guess so.

924
01:10:32,644 --> 01:10:34,578
Would you take these?

925
01:10:40,485 --> 01:10:42,085
And if I die...

926
01:10:45,156 --> 01:10:46,990
Will you throw out
all my drugs

927
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:50,927
and my paraphernalia
and my porno?

928
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:54,998
You know...

929
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,434
Anything that's going
to break my mom's heart.

930
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,371
Please?

931
01:11:03,775 --> 01:11:05,376
Thank you.

932
01:11:09,781 --> 01:11:11,615
<i>This is Cheyenne Jacobson</i>

933
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:13,617
<i>reporting live
from the Gibbons Farm.</i>

934
01:11:13,619 --> 01:11:15,452
Sheriff Perry,
officer Burke here.

935
01:11:15,454 --> 01:11:18,121
I'm trying to get some
information on Isabella--

936
01:11:18,123 --> 01:11:20,123
she did?

937
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:24,094
Okay. Thanks.
Great. Kimberly!

938
01:11:24,096 --> 01:11:27,063
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.

939
01:11:27,065 --> 01:11:29,032
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?

940
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:30,401
I'll go talk to her.

941
01:11:30,403 --> 01:11:33,303
Hi.

942
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:35,939
Just find Isabella and get
this thing over with, okay?

943
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:37,674
Go on, I'll be fine.

944
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:46,583
- Where's Rory?
- I don't know.

945
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,624
Could you be a little quieter
with that thing, please?

946
01:11:53,626 --> 01:11:56,593
Yeah, sure. I'll just
put it on quiet mode.

947
01:11:56,595 --> 01:11:57,928
That would be good.

948
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,324
Rory.

949
01:12:43,341 --> 01:12:46,076
<i>Oh my God!</i>

950
01:12:46,078 --> 01:12:47,744
<i>Somebody get out there!</i>

951
01:12:47,746 --> 01:12:50,814
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!

952
01:12:50,816 --> 01:12:52,248
The keys are in it.

953
01:12:56,153 --> 01:12:58,421
Kimberly!

954
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,067
<i>Kimberly!</i>

955
01:13:11,069 --> 01:13:13,269
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?

956
01:13:13,271 --> 01:13:15,706
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.

957
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:19,610
This one was different.

958
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:22,679
It was like the van crashing
into the lake.

959
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:24,781
I was in a hospital,
there was screaming

960
01:13:24,783 --> 01:13:26,583
and a nurse was trying
to choke me.

961
01:13:26,585 --> 01:13:29,252
I couldn't see her, but I
could see her name tag.

962
01:13:29,254 --> 01:13:32,956
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.

963
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:36,126
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is
going to try and kill Isabella.

964
01:13:40,197 --> 01:13:43,133
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!

965
01:13:43,135 --> 01:13:44,735
What's wrong?
Is my baby all right?

966
01:13:44,737 --> 01:13:47,203
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.

967
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:50,140
<i>A bizarre accident
has left two people dead,</i>

968
01:13:50,142 --> 01:13:53,076
<i>one of them killed by a safety
device meant to protect us.</i>

969
01:13:53,078 --> 01:13:55,646
<i>Ironically, the woman
was impaled through the head</i>

970
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:58,048
<i>after her emergency
airbag deployed.</i>

971
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:01,685
She was trapped in her vehicle after it
crashed into a field near greenwood lake.

972
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,087
<i>Suddenly the airbag
went off...</i>

973
01:14:38,623 --> 01:14:40,757
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?

974
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:42,926
We may need to do
a stat caesarean!

975
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:44,828
Get Dr. Kalarjian
up here now!

976
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:47,598
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

977
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,066
I'm just going
to wait outside,

978
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,134
'cause I'm just really
in the way here.

979
01:14:51,136 --> 01:14:53,136
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.

980
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:54,972
You guys, get to Isabella!

981
01:14:54,974 --> 01:14:56,840
I'm going to find Eugene!

982
01:14:56,842 --> 01:15:00,077
<i>Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.</i>

983
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,013
<i>Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.</i>

984
01:15:18,763 --> 01:15:21,031
Dr. Kalarjian,
in here, hurry!

985
01:15:22,299 --> 01:15:24,334
That's her.

986
01:15:25,436 --> 01:15:26,970
<i>Wait, wait, wait!</i>

987
01:16:04,275 --> 01:16:06,677
Contractions have stopped.

988
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:09,245
Arrest in descent halfway
through the birth canal.

989
01:16:09,247 --> 01:16:11,414
<i>Bad tracing,
it's losing oxygen.</i>

990
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:13,583
The cord's compressed!

991
01:16:13,585 --> 01:16:16,953
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!

992
01:16:16,955 --> 01:16:18,755
<i>Where's Kalarjian?!</i>

993
01:16:18,757 --> 01:16:21,491
Dr. Kalarjian!

994
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,760
- Dr. Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.

995
01:16:23,762 --> 01:16:26,963
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.

996
01:16:36,273 --> 01:16:38,909
Just push a little more.

997
01:16:38,911 --> 01:16:41,311
Oh, no.

998
01:16:41,313 --> 01:16:43,046
<i>Isabella, is the baby okay?</i>

999
01:16:44,281 --> 01:16:45,949
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.

1000
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,618
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know--

1001
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:51,487
I need to know if the baby's all right!

1002
01:16:53,124 --> 01:16:54,891
It's a boy.

1003
01:17:15,747 --> 01:17:17,748
Thank you.
Congratulations!

1004
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:19,783
Who the hell are they?

1005
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:22,119
Oh my God!

1006
01:17:25,923 --> 01:17:27,824
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.

1007
01:17:27,826 --> 01:17:30,593
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.

1008
01:17:30,595 --> 01:17:32,528
It's over.
It's okay.

1009
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,544
<i>- Kimberly.
- What did you see?</i>

1010
01:17:48,546 --> 01:17:51,948
I don't think Isabella was ever
supposed to die in that pileup.

1011
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,813
Then what's the premonition
of the lake supposed to be?

1012
01:17:54,839 --> 01:17:55,911
Try to remember.

1013
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:16,840
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.

1014
01:18:17,909 --> 01:18:19,276
Eugene.

1015
01:18:23,815 --> 01:18:26,917
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?

1016
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:28,685
You saw an ecg machine
and what else?

1017
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:32,856
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?

1018
01:18:33,925 --> 01:18:35,358
Wait.

1019
01:18:37,394 --> 01:18:39,162
Eugene.

1020
01:18:59,383 --> 01:19:01,218
Oh God, no!

1021
01:19:11,562 --> 01:19:13,196
Bloody hands.

1022
01:19:15,066 --> 01:19:17,234
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.

1023
01:19:17,236 --> 01:19:19,402
- What?
- Crash cart.

1024
01:19:19,404 --> 01:19:20,837
Let's go! Move it!

1025
01:19:23,207 --> 01:19:25,175
<i>Dr. Kalarjian.</i>

1026
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,943

<i>The lake.</i>

1028
01:19:33,252 --> 01:19:35,085
<i>The white van.</i>

1029

What are you talking about?

1030
01:19:44,428 --> 01:19:46,196
<i>Kimberly:
New life.</i>

1031
01:19:48,799 --> 01:19:50,600
What is it?

1032
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:52,869
I know what I have
to do to save us.

1033
01:19:54,438 --> 01:19:57,440
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.

1034
01:19:57,442 --> 01:20:00,543
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.

1035
01:20:05,283 --> 01:20:07,217
Get Kalarjian.

1036
01:22:32,796 --> 01:22:35,932
<i>Only new life can defeat death.</i>

1037
01:22:35,934 --> 01:22:38,768
<i>If it is my time to
go and be in heaven...</i>

1038
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:41,171
<i>With my family.
I can accept that.</i>

1039
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,674
<i>Flight 180...</i>

1040
01:22:44,676 --> 01:22:46,809
<i>I know what I
have to do to save us.</i>

1041
01:22:46,811 --> 01:22:48,978
<i>There are no known survivors.</i>

1042
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,913
<i>I have to die.</i>

1043
01:23:00,258 --> 01:23:02,358
Ready and clear.

1044
01:23:03,927 --> 01:23:05,695
<i>Nothing.</i>

1045
01:23:07,098 --> 01:23:09,599
<i>- Come on.
- Ready, clear.</i>

1046
01:23:09,601 --> 01:23:12,702
<i>She's back!</i>

1047
01:23:12,704 --> 01:23:15,105
Epinephrine. Two milligrams,
IV push.

1048
01:23:15,107 --> 01:23:17,907
<i>I want her prepped
and stabilized for ICU.</i>

1049
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:23,679
Welcome back.

1050
01:23:24,948 --> 01:23:26,949
They lost you
for a minute there.

1051
01:23:33,124 --> 01:23:37,460
Hey. We did it.

1052
01:23:37,462 --> 01:23:39,395
Thanks to you,
we cheated death.

1053
01:24:12,531 --> 01:24:15,898
<i>- Would you like some wine?
- I think I'll stick to our beer, thanks.</i>

1054
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,333
All right.

1055
01:24:17,335 --> 01:24:19,835
This is really great,
Mrs. Gibbons.

1056
01:24:19,837 --> 01:24:22,071
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

1057
01:24:22,073 --> 01:24:23,973
It's our pleasure.

1058
01:24:25,276 --> 01:24:29,245
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.

1059
01:24:29,247 --> 01:24:30,980
I had a fun summer.

1060
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:34,284
I don't know, I guess things are
pretty much getting back to normal.

1061
01:24:37,087 --> 01:24:40,190
Brian, I think you better
go check that barbecue.

1062
01:24:40,192 --> 01:24:42,892
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.

1063
01:24:42,894 --> 01:24:45,195
Trust me. I think I've
been through closer calls.

1064
01:24:45,197 --> 01:24:45,817
Yeah, me too.

1065
01:24:45,843 --> 01:24:48,298
Dad, you should tell them
about the news van thing.

1066
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,832
What's that?

1067
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:53,469
Brian was almost hit by that
news van that day in the field.

1068
01:24:53,471 --> 01:24:56,239
And your friend Rory, he pulled
him back at the last second.

1069
01:24:56,241 --> 01:24:57,064
<i>Saved his life.</i>

1070
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:59,809
<i>You never
told me that, Peter.</i>

1071
01:24:59,811 --> 01:25:01,344
<i>Boy, that was lucky.</i>

1072
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:08,518
