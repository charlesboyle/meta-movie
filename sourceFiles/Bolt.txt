1
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,827
That one.

2
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,958
Here, boy.

3
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,547
You're heavy.

4
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,968
And slobbery.

5
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,684
There.

6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,354
You're a good boy.

7
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,024
You're my good boy.

8
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,158
Hello?

9
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,663
Penny,
I don't have much time.

10
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,541
Daddy?
Are you okay?

11
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,336
Something's come
up at work, honey.

12
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,047
Daddy's not gonna be
home for a while.

13
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,175
I don't understand.

14
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,178
You can't go back
to the house, Penny. Okay?

15
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,098
What's happening?

16
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,936
It's all right. You
won't be alone. You have Bolt.

17
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,439
I've altered him.

18
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:35,006
He can protect you now.

19
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,736
The doctor has been taken care of,
which, of course, is wonderful news.

20
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,780
Everything is
positioning nicely.

21
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:03,492
There he is. Dr Calico.

22
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,914
Any luck getting our
guest to spill his guts?

23
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:14,837
Oh! His guts will spill,
one way or another.

24
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,839
Never! I'll never talk.

25
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,092
Daddy!

26
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:25,681
You're beginning to irk me, Professor.
I am irked, and that will not do.

27
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,267
Has the package arrived?

28
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:33,689
I think it might make our dear
friend a bit more communicative.

29
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,025
I'm sending an agent
to pick it up.

30
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:41,030
Gorgeous! Have him bring it
to me on the first flight.

31
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,379
Bolt, let's go.

32
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,991
We only need the girl.

33
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,193
What?

34
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,530
- Where's Calico?
- I'm not talking to you.

35
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,785
Bolivia! Bolivia!
Calico's in Bolivia!

36
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,787
Near Lake Rogaguado!

37
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,541
Lake Rogaguado! I
should've known.

38
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,884
- Come on, Bolt. Let's go!
- No!

39
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,328
Bolivia. There's a flight
leaving in 10 minutes.

40
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,176
Bolt! Zoom, zoom.

41
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,480
Bolt, fetch.

42
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,749
Puppy!

43
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,082
Good boy.

44
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,501
Airport.

45
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,338
Uh-oh!

46
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,470
Bolt, speak.

47
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,221
Okay, okay. Good job, buddy.

48
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,891
Mission accomplished.

49
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,146
That's a keeper.

50
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,400
It's all right, tough guy.
You got them all.

51
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,574
Don't worry, Bolt. You
saved the day again.

52
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,079
All right. Good job.
Let's strike the set.

53
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,835
We're gonna need a cable guard
on set for that move tomorrow.

54
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,545
Yeah. All right.

55
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,008
Good boy.

56
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,427
Airport.

57
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,431
Uh-oh!

58
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,270
Bolt, speak.

59
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,025
- Boom Mike.
- We got a boom Mike.

60
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,776
It's a boom Mike.

61
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,280
That's sloppy.

62
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,117
The dog could've seen that.
He could've seen that.

63
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,621
Uh... Who cares if
the dog sees a boom Mike?

64
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,956
What? Who's that?

65
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,668
Forgive me for answering a
question with a question,

66
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,880
but who are you?

67
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,759
- Mindy Parker, from the network.
- Of course.

68
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,971
Let me ask you, Mindy
from the network,

69
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,973
what do you see here?

70
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,558
Uh...

71
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,770
- The dog.
- "The dog," she says.

72
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,983
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor, Mindy.

73
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,653
Am I missing something?

74
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,572
You're missing
everything, Mindy.

75
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,574
You see a dog.

76
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:28,914
I see an animal who believes with every
fibre of his being, every fibre,

77
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,667
that the girl he loves
is in mortal danger.

78
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,835
I see a depth of emotion
on the face of that canine

79
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,173
the likes of which has never
been captured on screen before!

80
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,009
Never, Mindy from the network!

81
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,010
Hmm.

82
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:47,182
We jump through hoops to make sure
that Bolt believes everything is real.

83
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,602
It's why we don't miss marks.
It's why we don't reshoot,

84
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:55,691
and it's why we most certainly do
not let the dog see boom Mikes!

85
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,196
Because, Mindy from the network,

86
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:09,329
if the dog believes it,
the audience believes it.

87
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,375
Wow. Okay.

88
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,546
You want reality? Here you go, chief.
The show's too predictable.

89
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,049
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her
from the creepy English guy, we get it.

90
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,467
There's always a happy ending.

91
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,971
And our focus groups tell us
18-to-35-year-olds are unhappy.

92
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,723
They're not happy with happy.

93
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,725
So maybe you should,
I don't know,

94
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,561
spend a little less time worrying
about the dog's Method acting

95
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,729
and more time figuring out

96
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,315
how to stop 20-year-olds in
Topeka from changing the channel.

97
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,234
Because if you lose so much
as half a rating point,

98
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,572
so help me, I will fire everyone
in this room, starting with you.

99
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,241
How's that for real?

100
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,496
There. Perfect.

101
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,083
You saved me again, Bolt.

102
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,423
It's okay. It's nothing.
No more bad guys.

103
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,093
Do you want some food, Bolty?
Are you hungry?

104
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,435
You got them, Bolt. No
one's gonna hurt me.

105
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,773
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

106
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,110
Come here, buddy. Come here.

107
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,781
Go get it, Bolt. Go get it.

108
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,785
Yeah, that one's no fun either.

109
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,288
Well, what do we have here?

110
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,459
Your old buddy, Mr. Carrot.

111
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,774
Bolt. You know I have to go.

112
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,125
Yeah, you're my good boy.

113
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,261
There she is. My
little superstar.

114
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,513
Let's get to that Teen
Vogue cover shoot.

115
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,683
Mom, I wanna take Bolt
home this weekend.

116
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,184
Well, I...

117
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,186
- That would be...
- That'd be nice. That'd be great.

118
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:43,108
That would. A little girl and her dog.
Nothing better than that.

119
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,655
So I can bring Bolt home?

120
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,492
As your friend I say,
"Yes, absolutely,"

121
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:57,289
but as your agent, I have to
remind you this is Bolt's world.

122
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,959
He has to stay right here.
Okay, let's go.

123
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,211
But he never gets
to be a real dog,

124
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,297
and it would only be for the
weekend, and I just want...

125
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,966
Well, you know what?
It's a fair question.

126
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,303
Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.
Boop! Pin in.

127
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,555
There you go. Now, let's
let that hang there a bit,

128
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,640
and then we'll address that when
we've thought things through.

129
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,309
Okay? Good enough for everybody?

130
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,478
Smiles all around? Let's
get out of here. Come on.

131
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,064
I don't need to think it through.
I wanna take Bolt home.

132
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,817
Look at this face.

133
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,320
I have a little girl at
home, love of my life.

134
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,739
I would do anything for her,

135
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,742
and I would trade her
for you in a heartbeat.

136
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,911
True story.

137
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,580
That reminds me, we need to
be getting over to wardrobe.

138
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,915
- Clip-clip, let's go.
- But...

139
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,000
- I need her in hair.
- I just...

140
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,752
Can I get her for
five minutes in makeup?

141
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,588
I wanna go for something
more natural.

142
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,930
So the dog
thinks this is all real?

143
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,765
Oh, yeah, you're new.

144
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,518
Guy never leaves the set.
It's unbelievable.

145
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:03,438
Whenever I get the chance, this
is the perfect way to unwind.

146
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,859
I like to start
with an evil laugh.

147
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,698
Hello, hairballs.

148
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,785
You may have won today, Bolt,

149
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,122
but in the end, we will
get your little Penny.

150
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,793
Not likely, cat, for you've chosen
to follow the path of evil.

151
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:29,297
Ultimately, it will destroy you, along
with your fiendish puppet master!

152
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,759
- Wow!
- I know, right? Okay, watch this.

153
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,471
She's a goner, dog.

154
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,725
The Green-Eyed Man has a plan,
and soon, he will execute it.

155
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:48,733
- Yeah, and then he will execute her.
- Nice.

156
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,320
I would superbark you both back
into the hole you crawled out of,

157
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,823
but I need you alive because
I've got a little message

158
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,325
for you to take back to
your Green-Eyed Man.

159
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,744
You tell him his old friend
Bolt said he better...

160
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,162
Is it long?

161
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,999
- Is what long?
- The message.

162
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,669
Is it a long message? Because
I have a horrible memory.

163
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,005
Yeah, I'll make it brief, all right?
You tell him I said I'm gonna...

164
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,173
You know what? Why
don't we do this?

165
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,509
You remember the first
half of the message,

166
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,344
and then I'll
remember the second,

167
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,513
and then we can pass it on to
the Green-Eyed Man together.

168
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,433
Now, I don't care how the message
is translated, all right?

169
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,934
Just do it, okay.

170
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,353
Tell the Green-Eyed Man
that I will not sleep,

171
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,274
I will not rest until my Penny
is safe from his evil clutches.

172
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,525
You tell the Green-Eyed
Man that reckoning...

173
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,943
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

174
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,612
Way too many words.

175
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,032
I was, like, "What?" And
then I was, like, "Huh?"

176
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:41,369
And then, well, I got a little bored and...
Something about clutches?

177
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,538
Anyway, I'll do my best. Ciao.

178
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:47,042
By the way, huge fan. Love it, love you.
Gotta go. Thank you.

179
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:52,297
Get back here, you sick,
revolting, loathsome little...

180
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,303
Dogs.

181
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,722
Cats.

182
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,982
I'll never let them
get you, Penny.

183
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,752
Are you ready, Bolt?

184
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:39,761
Let's widen out camera three.
Ready four. Go four!

185
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,845
And driver.

186
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,107
Thanks, Larry.

187
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,775
All right, Scooter.

188
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,444
Find the grate. Ready
on the rubber bars.

189
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,867
And track with them.

190
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,789
The Calico supercomputer.

191
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,961
If we can access it, we'll finally
learn where they're keeping my father.

192
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,440
The weapon's hot.

193
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,609
Heat vision time.

194
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,571
Bolt, stare.

195
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,822
Now!

196
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,503
Nice move.

197
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,132
Come on. Come on.

198
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:06,598
Such devotion. It
brings tears to my eyes.

199
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,016
Calico.

200
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:14,355
Your father's discoveries could be
of great use to our organisation.

201
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:21,613
I'm sure he'll be more accommodating
now that I've got his lucky Penny!

202
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,199
Bolt!

203
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,454
World domination is
within my grasp!

204
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,552
How did your focus groups
feel about cliffhangers?

205
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,555
You ask for unhappy
18-to-35-year-olds,

206
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:52,727
I give you unhappy
18-to-35-year-olds.

207
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,647
Bolt! It's okay, Bolt.
I'm fine.

208
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,815
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

209
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,233
Guards, stop her!

210
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,652
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
- Bolt!

211
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,404
Listen to him. He needs
to know I'm okay.

212
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,573
Nope, you're not okay.

213
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,660
You've been kidnapped by
the fiendish Dr Calico,

214
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,745
at least that's what the
dog needs to think,

215
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,331
but just imagine, close
your eyes and imagine

216
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,418
how excited he'll be when he
saves you tomorrow. Okay?

217
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,671
But he's gonna be
freaking out all night.

218
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,589
- Please, just let me...
- What...

219
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,925
Wait a second, what's
that behind your ear?

220
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,385
Is that a...

221
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,763
Yes, it is.
It's a pin. Let's do this.

222
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,600
Let's take the pin and put it
in this conversation. Boop!

223
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,352
And we will not take
it down, no, ma'am,

224
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,104
until this matter is resolved.

225
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,356
- But I just...
- Do you know what that reminds me of?

226
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,776
The DVD release junket. Let's get going.
It's a big push.

227
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,612
I want to go with a modern
look, something that says,

228
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,781
"I'm 13, and I'm
fine with that."

229
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:51,119
All right, okay. Let's give her some air.
Let's not crowd the talent.

230
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,213
I've been working
on my evil laugh.

231
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,659
'Cause everybody
has an evil laugh.

232
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,301
Like that.

233
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,636
Okay, here's the thing. You're
not ready for the evil laugh.

234
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,389
You could do a chuckle, like
a mildly upset chuckle,

235
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,974
after my evil laugh.

236
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,058
Listen to mine.

237
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,394
Hey, Bolt.

238
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,438
Big fan!

239
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,274
Bolt! Come back!

240
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,404
I'm too late.

241
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,449
- Bolt! Help!
- I'm coming, Penny!

242
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,993
Bolt! Help!

243
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,664
Hold on, Penny! Hold on!

244
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,836
Bolt! Help! Bolt! Help!

245
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,098
Penny!

246
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,697
Bolt! Here, Bolt!

247
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,890
Huh?

248
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,813
Whoa!

249
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,232
Okay! Hey! Hey!

250
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,576
Okay, Bolty. Okay. Stay cool.
You're cool, Bolty.

251
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,748
Oh!

252
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,211
The Green-Eyed Man.

253
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,436
Hmm.

254
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,522
Huh?

255
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,782
Penny! Penny!

256
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,963
Ow!

257
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,306
Penny!

258
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,809
Target acquired.

259
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,074
It ends here.

260
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,003
Penny!

261
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,006
Penny? They moved her.

262
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,180
There's no time for
formalities, brothers.

263
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,598
My person's in danger, and I...

264
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,435
- Whoa! What are you doing?
- Oh! I'm sorry.

265
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,770
You wanna sniff mine first?

266
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,938
What?

267
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,182
Not from around here,
are you?

268
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,650
Hey, stop it! This is serious!

269
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,821
Hey there. Are you
lost, sweetie?

270
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,531
Hey! Wait!

271
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:22,056
Why can't I bend
these stupid bars?

272
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,226
Oh, buddy.

273
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,731
You got your head stuck
pretty good, huh, guy?

274
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,650
Hey, guys, come here.

275
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,570
Check this out. He's
got his melon stuck.

276
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,407
Yup, that is one stuck melon.

277
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,912
Hey, hey, buddy. Take it easy.
Slow down.

278
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,583
I will not take it easy, pheasant.
I'm missing my person.

279
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:56,215
Hey, buddy, relax. Like this. Turn and pull.
Turn and pull.

280
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,343
Forget about it. You'll
be out, no time.

281
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,026
What are these things?
They've weakened me.

282
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:23,284
- Those are Styrofoam packing peanuts.
- Styrofoam?

283
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,953
This has the Green-Eyed
Man written all over it.

284
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,039
Have you seen the man
with the green eye?

285
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,042
You know,
I gotta say something,

286
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,877
if I could say something here.

287
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,380
You look familiar. Joey,
look at this guy's mug.

288
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:40,134
Yeah. You know, I could've sworn
I've seen this guy before.

289
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,218
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,889
- I gotta tell you, I never forget a face.
- He never does.

291
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,057
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Never.

292
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,559
Yeah, he's real good
with the faces and such.

293
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:49,644
Listen, listen!

294
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,314
The man with the green eye,
tell me what you know, birds.

295
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,735
- I know this dog.
- Yeah, yeah, me, too.

296
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,821
I gotta remember. It's gonna kill me.
Hold on.

297
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,163
No, I don't know.
I thought I knew.

298
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,000
Hey, you ever hang out down on 14th
Street with a stray named Kelvin?

299
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,085
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,587
- Kelvin, the Labradoodle.
- What?

301
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,216
You gotta give me something here,
'cause this is ridiculous.

302
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,842
Absolutely ridiculous.

303
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,768
Capisce, ridiculous. You
know what that means?

304
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,681
You pigeons are useless.

305
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:30,935
I need someone on the inside, someone
close to the Green-Eyed Man.

306
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,812
A cat.

307
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,272
Ooh. A cat?

308
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,024
Yeah, a cat.

309
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,610
And when I find him,
when I find him,

310
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,780
I'm gonna make that cat
wish he were never born.

311
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,369
I think we know just the cat.

312
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,043
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

313
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,880
Okay, Saul, nice work.

314
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,882
Let's find some mustard next time.
Okay, babe?

315
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,719
Yes, Mittens. Thank
you, Mittens.

316
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,558
Is that an everything bagel, Ted?
Attaboy.

317
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,351
Good day, Mittens.

318
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,062
Louie?

319
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,523
What is this?

320
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,153
It was a slow week.
That's half of what I got.

321
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,199
You hear this, Louie?
I'm starving here.

322
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,827
And when the old stomach
starts talking,

323
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,498
it ain't talking to me.
It's talking to the claws.

324
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,500
Not the claws! Please.

325
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,919
I'm holding these bad
boys back, best I can,

326
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,089
but, thing is,
it's not up to me.

327
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,675
The stomach's got a direct
line to these babies

328
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,095
and I'm picking up
a lot of chatter.

329
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,765
So, I'll talk to the claws,

330
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,935
but in exchange, next week
all your food comes to me.

331
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,354
But that's not our deal.

332
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,108
I bring you half, you give me protection.
That's our deal.

333
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,779
Yeah, well, the deal just expired.
Now get lost.

334
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,448
Mark my words, Mittens.

335
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,951
One day someone's gonna
stand up to you.

336
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,621
Someone's gonna
teach you a lesson.

337
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,289
Yeah. I'm really scared now.

338
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,958
You should be!

339
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,460
Okay! Yeah!

340
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,628
Where is she?

341
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,796
Uh...

342
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,132
- Who?
- You know why I'm here.

343
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,301
- Where is she?
- Okay, okay.

344
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,637
Look, buddy, I don't know what
you're getting at, but...

345
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,975
Come on, Mittens. Just
tell the guy where she is.

346
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,644
Tell the dog, make him happy.

347
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,313
Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens.
Tell him!

348
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,652
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

349
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,823
Would you tell the crazy canine
that he's got the wrong cat?

350
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,826
- You got her, pal.
- That's her.

351
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,246
- She's the one.
- That is definitely the right cat.

352
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,500
Looks like we're gonna
do this the hard way.

353
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,669
Whoa!

354
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,754
Hey, you're crazy, man!

355
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,259
Hey, Joey. Did we
go too far in this?

356
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,263
You kidding? This is the
best day of my life.

357
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,848
You work for the men in black,

358
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,599
who work for the man
with the green eye.

359
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:19,270
- They've taken Penny. Where is she?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

360
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:23,858
This is becoming tiresome, cat.
In fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

361
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,944
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay, I'll talk!
I'll talk!

362
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,614
I know where Penny is. Yeah.
They have her. Yes!

363
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,618
The men in black and the guy,
the guy with the blue eyes!

364
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,036
Blue eyes?

365
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,288
Um... Oh!

366
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,957
Green! Yes, green!
The one green eye!

367
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:44,962
You just can't stop lying, can you, cat?
It's in the genes. It's just gross.

368
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,383
I know. It's disgusting.
I disgust myself.

369
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,136
Hollywood.

370
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,724
But if you put me down,
I'll show you where she is.

371
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,059
Hmm.

372
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,322
You know, I hope you
appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

373
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,075
Every bone in my evil
cat body is telling me

374
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:18,204
not to betray the trust
of the Green-Eyed Man.

375
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:25,586
Okay. This is a top, top secret
map of the entire Earth.

376
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:31,342
Now we're over here, by the
green lady with the big torch,

377
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,844
and my boss has
Penny locked up...

378
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,054
Uh...

379
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:40,768
Right... Right over... Here, here!
By the waffle with the sunglasses.

380
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,938
Now all you need to do is
get from here to there.

381
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,022
Hmm.

382
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:50,694
Well, I told you where to find her so if
you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

383
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,447
I'll release you, cat,
when we find Penny.

384
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,534
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal.
We had a deal!

385
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,536
Your deal just expired.

386
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,040
She said that to me
not 10 minutes ago.

387
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,959
The irony.

388
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,131
Ooh!

389
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,466
Perfect.

390
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,389
Hmm.

391
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,807
Padlocked.

392
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,897
Listen, Cujo, I got some pretty
wicked claws under these mitts.

393
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:31,151
Do not, I beg of you, do not make
me bring out these bad boys.

394
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,987
It gets ugly.

395
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,408
- What are you doing?
- Stay back!

396
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,745
If I stare at the lock really hard,
it'll burst into flames and melt.

397
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,248
Now I'm concerned on
a number of levels.

398
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,416
- Easy, watch.
- I'm good.

399
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,583
- Watch it, though.
- You got it?

400
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,919
- Intruders!
- Slow down!

401
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,672
You're scraping
the fur off my...

402
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,510
Oh, boy. This
thing is heavy.

403
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,930
Hey, hey. Put it down.
I forgot the keys.

404
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,642
I'll be right back.

405
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,691
Oh!

406
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,944
Hey, lucky penny!

407
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,864
Thanks! Now move your butt.

408
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,033
Okay. Up on your end. MAN
All right, just a little bit.

409
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,117
Like that? A little bit more.

410
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,535
Yeah. I got...
No, I got mine.

411
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,953
You got it?

412
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:35,466
It's on the tip of my tongue. I know that dog.
I'm telling you, Joey.

413
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,302
Bobby, you guys are looking
at me like, "He don't know."

414
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,555
Telling you, I know this dog.
I seen him somewheres.

415
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,391
Hey, you'll remember it
tonight when you're preening.

416
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,727
Right, that's
what'll happen.

417
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,921
I have got some good news.

418
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,672
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

419
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,843
I just booked you on The
Tonight Show, lead guest.

420
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,011
That's right.

421
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:27,267
Which means just absolutely
nothing if Bolt is still missing.

422
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,686
It's not even good news,
like, "Whatever," "So what?"

423
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,606
The Tonight Show, who cares?
I don't care.

424
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,774
Aw.

425
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,442
It's okay, baby.

426
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,279
- He must be so scared.
- Scared?

427
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:43,617
Well, this is Bolt we're talking about.
He's not scared of anything.

428
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,122
I bet Bolt would want you
to do The Tonight Show.

429
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,293
Or maybe not.

430
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,633
Bolt loves you very much,
sweetie, and you're here.

431
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,137
He couldn't have gone far.

432
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,230
So, if you
got superpowers,

433
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,067
I guess that would make you, what,
like, some kind of superdog?

434
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,485
That information's classified.

435
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,321
Come on. Like, what's
your best power?

436
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,158
Your go-to move. How about flying?
Can you fly?

437
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:29,163
- Don't be silly. I can't fly.
- Okay, okay, fine.

438
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,665
If you don't have any powers,
you don't have any powers.

439
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,333
What's it to me?

440
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,170
I have a superbark.

441
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,922
A superbark? Wow!
You're kidding me.

442
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,345
What exactly does one
do with a superbark?

443
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,849
I really can't talk about it.
It's classified.

444
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,685
So I suggest you pipe down
and take me to Penny.

445
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,939
You're awfully attached to this
Penny character, huh, Wags?

446
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,526
- She's my person.
- Oh, please. She's a person.

447
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,947
And if you ask me, the
only good person is a...

448
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,330
Styrofoam! Tuck and roll!

449
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,708
Tuck and what?

450
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,723
Ow!

451
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:31,892
What?

452
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,562
What is this red liquid
coming from my paw?

453
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,648
It's called blood, hero.

454
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,068
- Do I need it?
- Yes!

455
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,488
So if you wanna keep it inside
your body, where it belongs,

456
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,242
you should stop jumping off trucks
doing 80 on the interstate!

457
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,245
Yeah, well, normally, I'm a
tad more indestructible.

458
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,412
Must've been the...

459
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:56,250
Styrofoam!
That stuff, it weakens me.

460
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,751
Ah-ha!

461
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,002
What are you doing?
Put that down!

462
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,922
All right, that's it. I've had it with you.
Untie me, pooch.

463
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,926
Or I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna seriously wound you!

464
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,595
I'm gonna seriously wound
you with this Styrofoam.

465
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,682
Are you mad? You don't know
the power of Styrofoam.

466
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,433
Oh, you bet I'm mad, baby,

467
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,104
and I'm about to unleash it.
The power of the Styrofoam.

468
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,188
Whoa!

469
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:21,733
All right, cat! Okay. You win.
I'll untie you.

470
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,739
That's a weird place
to put a piano.

471
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,619
Are we gonna have any
more problems, cat?

472
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,290
No! No, no. No more problems.
I'll take you to Penny.

473
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,796
- What is that?
- What?

474
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,548
That! Okay.

475
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,467
You have two seconds to tell me
what you've implanted in me, cat!

476
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,886
Poison? A parasite? Poison?

477
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,139
Oh, no, I just said that, didn't I?
See, I'm all discombobulated.

478
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,223
I can't think straight.

479
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,892
I don't believe this.
You're hungry.

480
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,397
- Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay! All right.

481
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,403
There's your antidote.

482
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,405
Food.

483
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,240
All right,
who wants burgers?

484
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,075
- I'll take one.
- Me, too!

485
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,660
What's this?

486
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,997
Go on, use the dog face.
This is gonna be beautiful.

487
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,666
You know, beg.

488
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,170
Do the dog face.

489
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,256
What... The dog face?
What does that mean?

490
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,229
Figures I'm tied to the one dog on
Earth who doesn't know how to beg.

491
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,848
Okay, if you want the...
The antidote,

492
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,684
you're gonna have to
do exactly what I say.

493
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,437
No. Not likely.

494
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,190
You're a degenerate
creature of darkness.

495
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,525
Yeah, yeah. Granted.
But, that said,

496
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,944
all I'm asking you to do is
just tilt your head a little.

497
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,530
You can do that, can't you?
Come on.

498
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,867
More. More.

499
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,554
- This is stupid.
- No, no, no, come on.

500
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,704
Work with me on this, please.
You're almost there.

501
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,039
Oh, boy.

502
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,709
Okay. Try it the other way.

503
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,212
There you go. Tilt up. Down.

504
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:11,051
Now a little smile. Lose the smile.
Drop your left ear. Your other left.

505
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,387
Okay, the other way was better.
Now drop them both.

506
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:18,392
Hold it. Right there. And
ever so slightly, look up.

507
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,395
Soup is on, baby!

508
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,989
Aw!

509
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,074
Oh!

510
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,575
Here you go!

511
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:37,702
Yes!

512
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,666
Aw!

513
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,668
Look at the little guy.

514
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,087
Aw!

515
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,924
Beat it, stupid cat!

516
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,183
Why do you care?

517
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,602
I want to know
what really happened...

518
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,020
And why does
that matter to you?

519
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,522
Because I'm involved!

520
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,357
- With Ridge?
- With James!

521
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,882
If you and James were
romantic, I wanna know about it.

522
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,111
What, so you can...

523
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,737
Come on down!

524
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,531
Gilligan, why
don't you stop that.

525
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,367
Come on, no Whammies! No Whammies!
No Whammies! Stop!

526
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,703
For weather on
the ones, here's Lester.

527
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,954
It
Really does help,

528
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,540
and it really releases
the serotonin, and...

529
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,543
Hey, man, this
time we'll do it my way.

530
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,711
Ooh!

531
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,385
Well, hello, puppy.

532
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,722
Did you come for some of
Grandma's butter bean dumplings?

533
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,890
Mmm-mmm.

534
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,224
You wait right there.

535
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,894
One of these days, I'm
gonna pound y'all to the ground.

536
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,979
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

537
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,903
Look at you. You are quite
the little actor, huh?

538
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,405
I haven't eaten
like this in ages.

539
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,575
Hey, look, my stomach's distended!
How great is that?

540
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,578
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.
We gotta keep moving.

541
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,581
But this place is a gold mine.
What's wrong with you?

542
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:09,252
Every week new RVs bring us new
suckers who bring us new food.

543
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,671
Look around! It's perfect.

544
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,095
Do my eyes deceive me?

545
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,140
Is this some apparition
I see before me?

546
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,436
Or could it be my hero?

547
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,438
Oh, my gosh, oh, my
gosh, oh, my gosh!

548
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:35,445
You're Bolt, the Superdog!
You're fully awesome!

549
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:42,285
- Wait a minute. You know this dog?
- I do. He is fully awesome.

550
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,038
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've established that.
Who are you?

551
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,375
- I'm Rhino.
- Rhino the hamster.

552
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,961
Well, you know, my ancestry
isn't all hamster.

553
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,965
I'm one-sixteenth wolf with, you know,
a little Wolverine in there somewhere,

554
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,800
but that's besides the point.

555
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,721
We have before us a legend,
Bolt, the Superdog.

556
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,057
He can outrun speeding missiles

557
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,477
and burn through solid metal
with his heat vision.

558
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:12,899
Oh! And best of all, he can obliterate
large structures with his superbark!

559
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,902
Wait a minute. You've
seen the superbark?

560
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,071
Have you been observing me?

561
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:22,492
- Oh, yeah! I watch you all the time.
- That's incredible.

562
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,994
Oh, it's nothing, really.

563
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,996
But I'm always so vigilant.

564
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,916
No one can evade my detection.
You're a phantom.

565
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,501
Uh...

566
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,254
If you say so.
Hey, check it out.

567
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:41,761
Take a gander at this Bolt action. Scary, huh?
It's like we're twins.

568
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,764
Yeah. Scary.

569
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,517
So, where's Penny?

570
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,769
She was kidnapped by
the Green-Eyed Man.

571
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:54,274
Kidnapped? This is terrible!
She could be in grave...

572
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,611
Grave danger. I know. But
I've captured this cat.

573
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,281
An agent of the Green-Eyed
Man, I presume?

574
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,451
You presume correctly.
She's taking me to Penny.

575
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:10,123
You, you are vile vermin.
How do you sleep at night?

576
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:14,961
Penny's the most wonderful
person ever, and she loves Bolt.

577
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:18,798
And he's awesome, and
you're a monster!

578
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:23,053
How dare you disrupt their
relationship with your evil!

579
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,472
- Die! Die!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

580
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:28,058
I can take her, Bolty.
Let me at them. Die!

581
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,603
- Die!
- Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy.

582
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,814
You're right. We need her alive.

583
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,149
Uh...

584
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,901
- "We"?
- Yes!

585
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,488
Bolt, I can be a valuable
addition to your team.

586
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,573
- I'm listening.
- I'm lightning-quick.

587
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:48,328
I have razor-sharp reflexes,
and I'm a master of stealth.

588
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,165
Plus, I'll keep
the cat in check.

589
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,834
The road'll be rough.

590
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,086
I have a ball.

591
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,504
There's no turning back.

592
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,589
Guess I'll have to
roll with the punches.

593
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,508
Easy won't be part
of the equation.

594
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,592
Promise?

595
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,261
I gotta warn you. Going into
the belly of the beast,

596
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,680
danger at every turn.

597
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,015
I eat danger for breakfast.

598
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,350
You hungry?

599
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,852
Starving!

600
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:13,937
Welcome aboard!

601
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,108
Hey. Can we talk for a second?

602
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,027
I don't know what's
going on here,

603
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:25,782
but I'm just a little bit concerned about
the number of lunatics on this trip.

604
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,534
My limit is one.

605
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,702
He's coming with us.

606
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,036
But I... Huh?

607
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,371
Hey!

608
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,623
Move it, prisoner.
We're losing daylight.

609
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,669
I agree. Now, we need to
find a fast set of wheels.

610
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,506
I've got a better idea.
Follow me.

611
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:57,397
Okay. So what we do here is we
give the target a quick flyover,

612
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,233
we adjust the trajectory
and then land dead centre.

613
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,985
Am I missing anything, Rhino?

614
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,446
Just the knowledge that every
minute spent in your company

615
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,865
becomes the new greatest
minute of my life.

616
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,659
No! Forget it!
How do you say.

617
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,036
"No way I'm doing
this" in crazy?

618
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,788
Calm down, cat. You're with me.

619
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,123
That's the problem!

620
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,418
Would you relax?

621
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:22,338
Every time he did this on the
magic box it was awesome.

622
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:26,718
Magic what?

623
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,554
You know, the magic
box people stare at.

624
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,599
Wait a minute. Does this magic
box have moving pictures on it?

625
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,185
Yeah, and Bolt's
pictures are the best.

626
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:39,355
Bolt's pictures. Of course!
He's from a... Oh, no!

627
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,649
Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
Bolt, dog, hear me out.

628
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,486
Let it begin. Let it begin.
Let it begin!

629
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,279
Wait! You are not a superhero...

630
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,119
Whoa!

631
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,165
What are you doing?

632
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,557
Mittens!

633
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:17,018
Mittens, take my paw!
I need you alive!

634
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,813
You're crazy! Stay away from me!

635
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,023
Take my paw. I'll save you.

636
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,776
No, you won't! You're
not really a...

637
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,127
Bolt!

638
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,048
Saboteur.

639
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,717
Ow!

640
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,136
Ouch! You moron, stop it.
I'm trying to help him.

641
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:54,639
Help him? Yeah, right.

642
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,685
Don't worry, Bolt.
I'll stop her!

643
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,572
I can't hold it.

644
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:16,619
Let go, you monster!

645
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,912
Bolt!

646
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,267
Ow!

647
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,273
Ow! Ow! Ow!

648
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,612
The real world
hurts, doesn't it?

649
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:53,281
But you wouldn't know
about that, would you?

650
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,075
Get down here, cat. We
don't have time for this.

651
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,785
I'll get a ladder.

652
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:03,666
Look, genius, you're part of a TV show.
You know what that is? Television?

653
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:09,714
It's entertainment for people. It's fake.
Nothing you think is real is real!

654
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,132
That's preposterous.

655
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,300
Think about it, Bolt.

656
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,969
Since you got lost, none of your
powers are working, are they?

657
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,972
For the first time, you're
hungry, you're bleeding.

658
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,059
I mean, do you really think that
you were born with a birthmark

659
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,896
in the exact shape
of a lightning bolt?

660
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,315
It's my Mark of power, cat.

661
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,525
It's the Mark of a
makeup artist, dog.

662
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,236
You're ridiculous.
Now get down here.

663
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,114
No.

664
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,993
Mittens, so help me, I will
superbark you out of that tree.

665
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,330
Yeah. Go nuts. Let's see how
that works out for you.

666
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,499
You leave me no choice.

667
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,680
Oh, the superbark. Scary, scary.
Yeah, that's really, really super.

668
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,518
It's not true. It's
just not true.

669
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,483
Wow. That one felt really super.

670
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,694
Wait. No, it didn't.

671
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:18,533
Okay, okay. Mmm-hmm. I get the idea.
You could stop now.

672
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:24,831
That's enough. Seriously, dog, stop. I'm not kidding.
Would you stop? It's...

673
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,878
Okay, fine! You're a superdog.

674
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:34,841
Bolt, be quiet, please!
Bolt, we gotta run!

675
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:36,801
Bolt!

676
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,219
Come here!

677
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:14,338
Look who we found, young lady.
It's Bolt! They found him.

678
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,465
Bolt!

679
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,426
Yeah, that's right.
The little puppy dog.

680
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,391
That is not Bolt.

681
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:29,854
Well, that depends on
how you look at it.

682
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:34,400
You know, when I was little, I
wanted a bicycle for my birthday,

683
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,153
but my parents got
me a baseball glove.

684
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,322
So, you know what I did?

685
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,951
I pretended that baseball
glove was a bicycle,

686
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,038
and I rode it to
school every day.

687
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,748
True story.

688
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,125
It's not him.

689
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,086
I think it's him. I do.

690
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,841
Thank you. Look, kid. It's
time we were honest with you.

691
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:02,011
If we don't get back into production,
people are going to lose their jobs.

692
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,805
Good people, with families.

693
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,306
But Bolt's still
out there, and...

694
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,058
Now, we feel for you,

695
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,310
and the last thing we wanna
do is ask a little girl

696
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,772
to make a grown-up decision,
but it's come to that.

697
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,816
We need you to move on.

698
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,444
We need you to let Bolt go.

699
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,004
Huh?

700
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:48,182
Must be made of Styrofoam.

701
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,436
No, no! No, no, no, please,
please, it can't end like this!

702
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,565
Stop worrying, cat! I'll
get us out of here.

703
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,986
You can't, Bolt! You got nothing!
No super strength, no superbark...

704
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,447
And no heat vision.

705
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,032
Listen to me, okay?

706
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:09,078
We are being taken to a place where
humans go animal shopping, all right?

707
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:12,373
And this is what humans do.
They always pick the cute ones.

708
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:17,086
The ones that look like you, Bolt. But
the rest of us never come back out.

709
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,006
I said I'll get us out
of here, all right?

710
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,219
Ohhh!

711
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,017
My hero.

712
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,036
Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny?

713
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,915
I've been expecting your call.

714
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:29,909
Ow!

715
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,619
Would you
give it up already?

716
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,872
You're liquefying whatever
brains you have left.

717
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:41,462
I cannot be contained in any container.
You quitter. Watch this.

718
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,098
I did it! I'm back!

719
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,434
That Styrofoam is wicked stuff.

720
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,561
Fully awesome!

721
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:01,607
There's no truck that I know
that can keep in Bolt and Rhino!

722
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,777
Rhino? What are you doing here?

723
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,488
Oh, nothing. I was
enjoying an evening stroll

724
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,492
and thought I'd just pop the
hatch on that containment unit.

725
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,121
You opened the door?

726
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:16,956
Yes, I did!

727
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:23,337
That's great, Rhino. Yeah,
that's really good.

728
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,632
All right.
Let's go get the prisoner back.

729
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,317
I can't do it.

730
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,988
What did you say?

731
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,781
I can't.

732
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,992
Who are you?

733
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,202
Rhino, you just don't under...

734
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,788
- You are Bolt.
- But I'm not a...

735
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,916
Who singlehandedly destroyed the
Green-Eyed Man's undersea labs?

736
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,043
Me, but...

737
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:07,298
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate
the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

738
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,967
- Who, Bolt, who? Who?
- Me, but none of it was...

739
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:13,054
You! You can, Bolt,

740
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,139
because all over this planet,

741
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,225
there are animals who
feel like they can't.

742
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:24,899
Like a little hamster who once
spent his days in an RV park,

743
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,528
dreaming of the day when he, too,
would save a little girl from danger

744
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:35,743
and be told, "You did it. You did it, Rhino.
You saved the day."

745
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,579
They need a hero, Bolt.

746
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,875
Someone who, no matter what the
odds, will do what's right.

747
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:47,254
They need a hero to tell them
that sometimes the impossible

748
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:51,842
can become possible
if you're awesome!

749
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,764
Well, you're right about
one thing, Rhino.

750
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,683
Mittens does need a hero,

751
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,187
and I guess I'll have to do.

752
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:08,192
Such modesty! Now, who's
going to save that cat?

753
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,277
- Me.
- Who? Tell me who!

754
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,445
Me.

755
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:15,616
I'll get my ball.

756
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,716
Over there.

757
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,929
There it is.

758
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:46,605
This'll be just like the time you
infiltrated Calico's Arctic hover-base!

759
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,234
But it's not gonna be
exactly like that, Rhino.

760
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,612
We're gonna have to do
things a little differently.

761
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,324
Stealth mode.

762
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,164
Good night, Ester.

763
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,915
Good night, Lloyd.

764
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,673
Lloyd?

765
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,053
Lloyd Spoon, you jump
out and scare me,

766
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,806
and I'm gonna
pepper-spray you again!

767
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,813
I swear, it's like I
work with toddlers.

768
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,028
Threat nullified.

769
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,783
I feel alive.

770
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:40,993
Shh!

771
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,166
There's a guard.

772
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,834
I'll snap his neck.

773
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,878
We need to get him
away from that door.

774
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,004
Oh!

775
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,430
- Ball?
- Ball?

776
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:05,351
- Ball? Ball? Ball?
- Ball! Ball! Ball!

777
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,232
I'm just... I'm read... I'm just...
Just pipe down!

778
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,037
Mittens?

779
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:30,417
Bolt? What are you doing here?

780
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,336
I'm busting you out.

781
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,882
You... You came all the
way back here for me?

782
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,092
Yeah.

783
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:41,262
But how'd you... I mean, you
don't have any superpowers.

784
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:42,930
- I know.
- Really?

785
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,183
- Yeah.
- Wow. Crazy day for you, huh?

786
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:49,728
It's been a lot. Yes, it has.
Are you ready for this?

787
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,689
- No.
- Me neither.

788
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:58,654
Hey, hey, hey! What is
twisting your giblets?

789
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,282
Hey, wait. Where'd you
get that hamster?

790
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,117
Give it. Give it.

791
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,411
Hey, wait!

792
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,204
Initiating escape.

793
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,292
Ow!

794
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,043
What the... Hey!

795
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,921
Lloyd! Block the door!

796
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,923
Block the door, block the
door, block the door!

797
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,967
Superbark. Superbark!

798
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:48,495
Sweet Sister Frances! What
did you do to my new truck?

799
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:49,622
You hold on right there!

800
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,708
Golly, Ester!

801
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,795
Both you boys need serious help!

802
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,047
Spicy eyes!

803
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,093
We need a ride.

804
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:06,096
Ooh! I've got a big one.
You're welcome.

805
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,947
I can't believe it.

806
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:28,160
My whole life I've wanted to
see a real live superbark.

807
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,998
You are legendary.

808
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:48,180
Mittens? If...

809
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,643
If I don't chase bad
guys, then what am I?

810
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,312
I mean, what...

811
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,109
Ah, don't worry about it.

812
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:04,321
Being a regular dog is, like, the
greatest gig in the world. Okay?

813
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,700
Look. I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

814
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,077
A little-known cat secret.

815
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,912
You know why we hate dogs?

816
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,207
'Cause we wanna be dogs.
We have dog complexes.

817
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,294
But what do dogs do?

818
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:22,047
Slobber, sleep, chase
tails, chew shoes.

819
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,425
You don't exactly need
a master's degree.

820
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,219
You know, most dogs live
in a place like this,

821
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,222
and, well, I don't know.
They do things like...

822
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,891
Out of this? But... But...

823
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,893
And this is your dog bowl.

824
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,980
- What is?
- This. The entire floor.

825
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,274
"It hits the ground,
it goes to the hound."

826
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,608
How cool is that?

827
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,363
And on cold nights,
this and a ball of yarn...

828
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:49,533
It doesn't get better than that.

829
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:53,162
You... You seem to know a
lot about these places.

830
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,289
Yeah, I did my time
in one of these,

831
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,624
but I'm more of an alley
cat at heart, you know?

832
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:00,919
Sprung out first chance I got.
Never looked back.

833
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,087
Hmm.

834
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:08,302
Rhino is awesome! He's so awesome!

835
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,804
He's... He's beyond awesome!

836
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,599
He... He's be-awesome!

837
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,059
He's...

838
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:19,938
I... I am be-awesome.

839
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,109
Mmm.

840
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:25,569
Hmm!

841
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:30,908
I think it's about time I introduced you
to the regular dog piece de résistance.

842
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,536
Go ahead. Stick your head out.

843
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,455
- Why?
- Just do it.

844
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,130
This... This is awesome!

845
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,759
And stick your tongue out.

846
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:56,308
This is totally awesome!
Why don't you try it?

847
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,019
No, thanks. It's
really a dog thing.

848

<i>♪ I have got so much to give</i>

849

884
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,177
Hey. Hey, Bolt. Wake up.

885
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,390
Come on. I've got a
surprise for you.

886
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:30,188
Okay, okay. No peeking. All
right, now, open them.

887
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:36,069
- Bask in the glow, baby.
- I...

888
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:38,947
Just let me give you the grand tour.
Okay?

889
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:43,869
This one, this one's mine,
and this one is all yours.

890
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,579
Mittens, I...

891
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,914
I found this really soft
pillow thing for you.

892
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,251
And get this. I found some
Styrofoam, and I stuffed it inside,

893
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,170
which I thought was both
kind of creative and ironic.

894
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,337
You know what I mean?

895
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,672
- Mittens, I don't think that...
- Ooh! Ooh!

896
01:08:55,757 --> 01:09:01,094
Check it out. Total privacy,
and completely soundproof.

897
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,429
Yeah, well, I don't
think that I...

898
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,598
Okay, I lied. It's
not soundproof.

899
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,601
- But you know...
- Mittens, I can't stay here.

900
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,146
What?

901
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,732
We're one waffle
away from Penny.

902
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,402
You're still going back to her?

903
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,739
Mittens, she's my person.

904
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,534
Ow! Ow! Ow!

905
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:25,911
Ear, ear.

906
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,416
Look at me, Bolt. I'm real.

907
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,419
Now, how about this?
Is that real?

908
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:39,299
Does this look real to you? Or that?
Is that real? Or that?

909
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,845
How about that, Bolt?
She's an actress.

910
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,473
She's just pretending.

911
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,141
Not Penny.

912
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:52,062
There is no Penny. She's fake.

913
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,647
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

914
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:57,359
No, no, Bolt. That's
what they do, okay?

915
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,862
They act like they love you. They
act like they'll be there forever,

916
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,907
and then one day they'll pack up
all their stuff and move away

917
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,159
and take their love with them,

918
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,830
and leave their declawed cat
behind to fend for herself!

919
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:21,800
They leave her wondering
what she did wrong.

920
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,679
I...

921
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,975
I'm sorry, Mittens,

922
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,062
but Penny is different.

923
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,024
Then go.

924
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,863
- Mittens, I...
- Get out of here, Bolt.

925
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:46,241
I never should've
taken pity on you.

926
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,995
- Mittens...
- Just get out of here, Bolt!

927
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,006
You take care, Mittens.

928
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,588
That meat lover's pizza is
not loving me back at all.

929
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,799
Hey there, Rhino.

930
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,468
Morning, cat.

931
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,262
Where's Bolt?

932
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,056
He's...

933
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,351
He's gone.

934
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:56,227
Bolt left?

935
01:11:56,938 --> 01:12:01,107
Yeah, but he instructed
me to tell you

936
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:05,737
that he had to face the
Green-Eyed Man alone.

937
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,617
Whoa!

938
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,203
- Where are you going?
- To Bolt.

939
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,622
But he doesn't need us any more.

940
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,584
Trust me, I've seen it a
million times before.

941
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,795
In the cold, dark night
before the battle,

942
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:26,299
when the steely fangs of evil are
sharpened and poised to strike,

943
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,928
the hero must go and face his
greatest challenge alone.

944
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,473
But if Bolt's
taught me anything,

945
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:37,352
it's that you never abandon
a friend in a time of need.

946
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:41,022
When your teammate's
in trouble, you go.

947
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,900
Whether they ask or not, you go,

948
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,027
not knowing if you're coming
back dead or alive...

949
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:48,196
He went the other way.

950
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,322
You go!

951
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:53,451
Knowing how deep the shrapnel's
going to Pierce your hide, you go.

952
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:18,476
Penny.

953
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,941
No way. Wow. Bolt. I'm a
really big fan of yours, brother.

954
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,706
I'm Blake. This is my
writing partner, Tom.

955
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,194
- Tom, say what's up.
- What's up?

956
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,821
- Wow!
- Oh, no.

957
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,865
Oh. And this is our
personal assistant, Billy,

958
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,700
who was supposed to
wait up on the wire.

959
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,243
Bolt, I've admired you
for such a long time,

960
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,786
and there's something I've
always wanted to tell you

961
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,204
if I ever got a chance to
meet you, and now it's...

962
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,040
Okay, Billy, that was
horrifying, what you just did.

963
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,207
Why don't you make
yourself useful.

964
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,376
Go get me some breadcrumbs,
whole grain. Go.

965
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,378
Whole wheat is not the same
thing as whole grain, Billy!

966
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,213
- Not the same, Billy.
- Do not come at me with whole wheat!

967
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:48,590
Or pumpernickel, Billy!

968
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,967
Okay, guys, but I
really gotta get going.

969
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,178
I know. I know you're a busy
dog, but if you've got a second,

970
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,055
we'd love to pitch you
an idea for your show.

971
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,307
Tom's better at pitching. I'll
let him take it from here.

972
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,225
Tommy's got the spotlight.

973
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,688
Wait for it.

974
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:07,776
- Aliens.
- Oh, snap!

975
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,945
- Aliens?
- Audiences love aliens.

976
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,323
- Holler back!
- It'll be huge, man. Huge.

977
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,116
You can't touch us.

978
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,993
Uh...

979
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,287
I love it. But I'll
tell you what.

980
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:23,625
If you guys can help me find Penny,
that girl from the television show,

981
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:27,962
well, I'd love to hear more about
this aliens idea, but on the way.

982
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,089
We got a nibble.

983
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:32,300
Don't freak out. This is
how you blew it with Nemo.

984
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:35,887
We open, exterior, outer
space, late morning...

985
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:39,057
...a fiery comet
to reveal Penny...

986
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,726
...faced by a man-eating squid!

987
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:54,280
And as the tractor beam is pulling
Penny towards the alien mother ship,

988
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:55,782
we fade to black.

989
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,243
And we have a great pop
song for the end credits.

990
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,787
Talk to your people. We're
ready to move on this.

991
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,497
He's so on board!

992
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,757
There it is!

993
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:19,264
The most terrifying
place on Earth.

994
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,655
Hello. How are
you doing today?

995
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,991
Hi. I'm here
to see Joe Mateo.

996
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:44,497
At long last, we've arrived
at the belly of the beast.

997
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:48,501
The lair of the Green-Eyed Man!

998
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,128
Rhino! Hold up!

999
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,047
Hold up!

1000
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,842
Why? What's the problem?
I'm pumped!

1001
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:01,431
Listen, this may be
really hard for you to understand,

1002
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,517
but, you see, sometimes things
aren't what they seem to be.

1003
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,353
I mean, sometimes, sometimes you
think something's really real

1004
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:08,855
and it's not. And sometimes...

1005
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:12,317
All of my training has
prepared me for this moment.

1006
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,610
This is complicated.

1007
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,695
Die! Die!

1008
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,700
Prepare yourself,
foul man-beast,

1009
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,703
for I will beat your
pancreas with your spleen,

1010
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,997
and then I will rip your
liver out of your...

1011
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,544
You're so cute with
your little whiskers.

1012
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:34,756
I had a hamster just like
you when I was a kid.

1013
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,425
His name was Mr. Sparkles.

1014
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,245
Bolt?

1015
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,750
Bolt! You're okay!

1016
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,128
You came back.

1017
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,640
Bolt, I thought I lost you.

1018
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,571
You're my good boy.

1019
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,223
Good boy.

1020
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:11,144
Okay, people. Let's move it to
stage seven and do it for real.

1021
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:19,986
I miss him.

1022
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:23,614
I know, honey. I do, too.

1023
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,953
First positions, please.

1024
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:42,383
Okay, hold still
for me, sweetie.

1025
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,814
Fifteen, take one. Mark.

1026
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,816
And action.

1027
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:10,078
Ah!

1028
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:15,124
Professor, I'd like to thank
you for granting us access

1029
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:19,378
to that labyrinthian
mind of yours.

1030
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,090
You know I'd never
do such a thing.

1031
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:28,638
Unless it was the only way to
save your little girl's life!

1032
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:29,889
Penny!

1033
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:33,309
Daddy! Bolt! Here, Bolt!

1034
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:36,187
Your dog is nowhere near...

1035
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,069
Get that dog!

1036
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:51,702
Go. Go. Go. It's okay, boy.
Come here.

1037
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:01,045
Fire. Fire, fire! There's fire!

1038
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,053
Hey, Wags.

1039
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:13,808
Mittens? What are
you doing here?

1040
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,101
Long story short,

1041
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:19,105
I was tied to a delusional dog
and dragged across the country.

1042
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,857
But that is not important now.

1043
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,527
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

1044
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:27,238
And why aren't you in there?

1045
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,658
You were right about
her, Mittens.

1046
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:35,621
She... Well, it wasn't real.

1047
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:39,458
No, Bolt. It is real. I
was in there just now.

1048
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:43,296
I saw her face after you left.
She's brokenhearted.

1049
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,967
She doesn't want just any dog.
She loves you.

1050
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:54,432
She's your person, Bolt,
and you are her dog.

1051
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,646
Bolt, you're just gonna
have to trust me on this.

1052
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:02,690
Mittens, be quiet.

1053
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:04,108
No. You need to hear this.

1054
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,277
No, no seriously. Be quiet.

1055
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,030
What is it?

1056
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:11,824
Penny.

1057
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:15,161
Help! Please, help! Help!

1058
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,495
Hold on!

1059
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,790
Please! Help!

1060
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:36,724
Oh, my gosh, the stage!

1061
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,893
Yeah. You better run.

1062
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,648
I'm on your six.

1063
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:44,774
What do we do?

1064
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,568
Just make sure I get
inside that building.

1065
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,072
Bolt?

1066
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:54,742
Is anyone still in there?

1067
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:56,369
I don't know.

1068
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:00,873
Coming through.

1069
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:07,505
It's a good day to die!

1070
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:09,548
Not on my watch, rodent.

1071
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:39,870
Bolt!

1072
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,803
I knew you'd come back.

1073
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,410
Bolt. Zoom, zoom.

1074
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,197
Bolt.

1075
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,452
Bolt, just go on out.

1076
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:04,622
Go.

1077
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:08,167
It'll be okay.

1078
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,719
You're my good boy.

1079
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:21,806
I love you.

1080
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:35,653
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?

1081
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,976
Hey, did you hear that?

1082
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,102
- Yeah.
- What is that?

1083
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,229
Quiet. Everyone be quiet.

1084
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,488
It's the superbark!

1085
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:23,284
- It's coming from over there!
- Go, go, go!

1086
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,411
Come on, let's go!

1087
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:41,302
Over here! We found them.
They're here. We found them!

1088
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:49,226
All right, we got an RT
coming through, people. Make a hole!

1089
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,644
For your own safety,

1090
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:53,105
keep moving away
from the building.

1091
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:01,614
- Bolt.
- I gotta get through. Sweetie!

1092
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:06,744
You're okay. You gotta be okay.
You're gonna be just fine.

1093
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:11,123
She's stable, but we're gonna take
her to the hospital just to be safe.

1094
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,092
I'm so sorry this happened.

1095
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,303
I can't imagine what
you must be feeling.

1096
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:28,015
No mother should ever have to
go through something like this,

1097
01:26:28,099 --> 01:26:33,687
but I promise you we're going
to make this work for us.

1098
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:38,150
I'm talking cover stories, production
deals, executive producer credit.

1099
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,194
This is so great!

1100
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:42,321
Ow!

1101
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,991
We quit.

1102
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:49,370
No, no! Wait! Let's not
make any rash decisions.

1103
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:52,122
Let's put a pin in it.

1104
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:07,263
I'm afraid your
injuries were more severe

1105
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,765
than we had previously
thought, my dear.

1106
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:13,394
We had to completely
reconstruct your face.

1107
01:27:15,855 --> 01:27:17,314
Have a look.

1108
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:24,822
Well, at least Calico won't
be able to recognise me.

1109
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:30,661
Calico!

1110
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,091
Bolt!

1111
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:06,405
Aliens.

1112
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,287
That is totally unrealistic.

1113
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,290
Absolutely ridiculous.

1114
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:19,710
You could say that again. Oh, yeah.
Right there, right there.

1115
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,714
Over. Yeah, that's the spot.

1116
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,476
Hey, silly doggy.

1117
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:44,902
That's a keeper. You
wanna go play outside?

1118
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:48,030
You wanna go play outside?
Let's go!

1119
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,337
Does that dog look familiar?

1120
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:07,299
Nope. I never seen him
before in my life.

1121
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,681
Come on.

1122
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,976
Bolt! Come on, buddy!

1123
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:22,356
There is no home Like
the one you've got.

1124
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:29,279
