1
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:50,292
Fo Shan's citizens were well off and practiced kung fu as a hobby.

2
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:55,542
Martial clubs became popular,
turning Fo Shan into a province renowned for martial arts.

3
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:00,625
Martial Arts Street in Fo Shan, 1935

4
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,250
Another competitor

5
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,417
Okay, let's start practicing

6
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,292
Come on, ready...

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,167
One...

8
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,375
Two...

9
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,958
One... two...

10
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,583
Sir, a Master Liu is looking for you

11
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:19,500
May l know who you are?

12
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,375
I'm  the patriarch of the Liu Fist Sect

13
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,625
l just started a martial club in Fo Shan

14
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:24,917
Congratulations

15
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,958
l hear that Master Ip is a Wing Chun expert
16
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,750
l'd love to practice with you today

16
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,042
Can we do it some other day?

17
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,542
It's not convenient right now

18
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,375
Since I'm  already here,

19
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,000
let's just play around for a bit

20
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,417
It's all private. No one else shall know who wins

21
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,417
It's not a matter of winning. I'm  having dinner

22
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,375
In that case... I'll wait for you

23
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,375
Master Liu

24
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,250
Have you eaten yet?

25
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,000
Please join me

26
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,750
You want one?

27
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,417
No, thanks

28
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,542
ls the food all right tonight?

29
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,292
Very good indeed

30
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,000
That's good

31
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,250
Very quick

32
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,583
Leave it, Uncle
34
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:39,875
Master Liu

33
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,375
Please!

34
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,167
Please!

35
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you okay?

36
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,333
I'm  fine...

37
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's start again!

38
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,208
Okay, here l come

39
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,375
Touch
42
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,292
Touch
43
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:44,958
All touch
44
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,500
Thanks for being lenient, Master Liu

40
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,958
Thanks for teaching me. I've learnt a lot

41
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,500
The pleasure was all mine

42
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,625
Regarding this private duel, Master lp...

43
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,333
l won't tell anyone. Don't worry

44
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,625
Thanks so much. I'm  totally grateful

45
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,750
Goodbye

46
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,375
Farewell

47
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,750
So long

48
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,625


49
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,125
lp pushed Master Liu's whole body away

50
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,167
Isn't "Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels" Tai Chi?

51
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,250
l thought Master Ip practiced
57
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,458
Anyway, he pushed him away with one hand

52
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,042
Liu refused to admit de
59
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,792
lp kept chasing after him fiercely!

53
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,167
But Liu remained indignant after being hit

54
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,500
He jumped at Ip like a hungry dog

55
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,792
These tea leaves are pretty good and cheap

56
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,875
Thank you

57
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,500
Got to go Farewell

58
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,750
Goodbye Goodbye, see you next time

59
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:16,500
Who put these here, Uncle Ping?

60
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,083
Your brother

61
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,042
l thought Liu was good but he's so bad at defense
69
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,417
and was beaten up like a pighead

62
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,958
He co-owns his dad's restaurant. He's always idle

63
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,042
Ask that kid to serve the customers
72
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,000
Good morning

64
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:31,917
Brother lp!

65
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,000
Morning, Master lp

66
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:33,833
ls Quan here yet?

67
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,417
He's waiting for you upstairs

68
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,125
Been here long, Quan?

69
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,042
You're always late

70
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,042
I'm  busy

71
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,417
Busy with what?

72
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,500
Drinking tea, eating, practicing

73
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,750
What else?

74
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,292
This tea smells nice

75
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,292
I'm  talking about you

76
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,333
Have you ordered yet?

77
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,375
l got something to discuss with you

78
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,917
Let's eat first and then we'll talk

79
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,208
This just came out of the oven! Try it...

80
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,792
Heard that you had a duel with Master Liu

81
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,542
and had beaten him quickly. ls that true?

82
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,583
Who told you that, Lin?

83
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,542
My brother

84
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:22,125
Should've told me earlier. I'm  his disciple now!

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,708
But you've been a disciple of every master

86
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,125
Was the duel private, Brother lp?

87
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,500
We have things to discuss. Leave us for now

88
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,875
Then l won't disturb your private conversation

89
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,125
Good!

90
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,750
Morning, Master! Morning

91
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:54,500
Morning

92
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,250
Master

93
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,458
Heard that you were beaten by Ip Man

94
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:58,875
Everyone in Fo Shan knows about it now

95
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,292
Nonsense!

96
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,042
Yuan at the restaurant

97
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,667
Everything is costly in Fo Shan these days

98
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:07,833
So what?

99
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,417
That means the economy is good in Fo Shan

100
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,750
Everybody can afford to spend money
110
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,625
ls that so?

101
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:20,167
Clothing is the most important in our daily lives

102
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,708
There will be lots of demand forfuture clothing

103
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,833
I'll open a cotton mill to provide cotton for them

104
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,000
l want you to be my partner

105
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,667
l don't know anything about business

106
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,417
But l do

107
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,958
I'm  not in need of money

108
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,583
Who's Yuan? Show yourself!

109
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,000
l am

110
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,875
You rascal. You ruined my reputation

111
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,750
l must teach you a lesson!

112
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,292
Master...

113
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,667
He's my brother. Let's talk

114
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:00,333
Calm down. Okay, Master?

115
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,667
Your brother? He ruined my reputation

116
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,042
He said l was beaten by Ip Man

117
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,167
What's gonna happen to my martial club?

118
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,042
Who will want to be my disciples?

119
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:11,292
Apologize!

120
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,417
l didn't do anything wrong. l told the truth!

121
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,375
You're bullshitting again! You... Master...

122
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,458
Master Ip is upstairs. Seek him out if you have guts!

123
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,125
What? Go!

124
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,333
Take it easy, Master...

125
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,708
Master...

126
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,625
Don't be angry, Master

127
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,708
I've been wronged, Master lp

128
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,167
Master...

129
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,000
Please tell everybody

130
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,417
you've defeated Master Liu in a duel

131
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:48,708
Master lp...

132
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,542
You got to clear my name

133
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,333
You liar, why're you bothering Brother lp?

134
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,792
I'm  no liar

135
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,167
l sawthe duel when l was picking up my kite

136
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,417
Your kite was cut and fell into Brother Ip's house

137
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:08,667
You saw the whole duel between the two masters

138
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,583
lsn't that too much of a coincidence?

139
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,875
That's exactly what happened

140
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,167
Even if it's true, you shouldn't have told everyone

141
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,500
You're not supposed to admit to certain things

142
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,708
What's wrong with admitting to the truth?

143
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,042
That might cause embarrassment for others

144
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,042
What embarrassment? I don't know so much

145
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,583
This is embarrassment!

146
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,042
You don't need to do that, Lin

147
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,292
Why're you laughing? You think I'm invisible?

148
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,333
Captain... it's no big deal

149
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,167
What no big deal?

150
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,250
Leave! Don't you leave!

151
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,417
Captain, it's no big deal

152
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,958
l saw everything. I'm  warning you...

153
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,875
I'll nab whoever that causes trouble on my turf

154
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,208
l didn't cause any trouble

155
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,542
Someone ruined my name. I'm  here to claim justice

156
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,833
What justice? I am justice

157
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,125
You hooligans are fighting all the time

158
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,833
What age are we in now.

159
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,375
Still talking about martial arts?

160
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,500
We're talking about arms and guns!

161
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,750
Guns. Got it?

162
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,542
You know, Captain Li...

163
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,792
We martial artists are energetic

164
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,250
Sometimes we might be a bit too loud

165
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,042
But that doesn't mean we're not civilized

166
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:45,042
We're civilized folks. Please don't pull the gun

167
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,792
Cut me some slack

168
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,500
Lin, set a table for Captain Li. It's on me

169
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,958
Yes... Captain Li, this way please

170
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,042
What you looking at? Get lost

171
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,667
Don't look Don't look... Get out of the way

172
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:57,833
Please

173
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:02,792
Master Liu

174
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,083
As you please

175
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,417
Why so secretive?

176
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:15,583
I'm  really not good at business

177
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,583
Take this to set up the mill.
Pay me back if you make a profit

178
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,833
lt'll be a while before l can repay you

179
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,708
Take your time

180
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,958
Another request: take my son as your disciple

181
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,167
There're so many martial club masters. Ask them

182
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,167
None of them is better than you

183
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,667
We're similar

184
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,375
Brother lp

185
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,583
Lin

186
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,125
Brother Quan

187
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,125
l learnt some new moves. Practice with me

188
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,875
You got so much time. You found your brother?

189
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,167
Let him be

190
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,292
He'll come back once he spent all his money

191
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:57,875
Let's try

192
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,542
Dad, did Uncle Ip agree?

193
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,917
Let's go watch over there

194
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,208
You draw very well, Zhun

195
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,083
What new moves have you learnt? Let's see

196
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,167
Brother lp, my master says

197
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,083
this move is offense and defense all in one

198
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,667
Attack while defending. Defend while attacking

199
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,292
Aren't they the same?

200
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Go away, ignorant kid

201
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,833
Here l come

202
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,333
This move attacks the midrib

203
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,125
Stop reciting mantra. Hit your target

204
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,250
Mom, I'm  done with my drawing

205
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,958
So beautiful. Show it to Dad

206
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,042
Hit to disperse. Disperse while hitting

207
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,708
My last move was "disperse while hitting"...

208
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:54,792
Dad, look

209
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,125
Wait. I'm not free at the moment

210
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:57,625
You don't get it? No

211
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,792
Come again if you don't get it

212
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,917
Try again

213
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,500
Dad doesn't want to see it

214
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,417
There you go What?

215
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,000
That was "disperse while hitting" Once more, Master lp

216
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,333
l couldn't see clearly

217
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,917
See?

218
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,542
You guys fight every day. Aren't you tired?

219
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,583
You okay, Brother lp?

220
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,625
Sorry, Mrs lp

221
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,750
Goodbye, Mrs lp

222
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,625
l wasn't talking about you

223
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,708
No, there're things to take care of at the mill

224
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,167
Yao

225
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,583
l gotta go, Uncle lp

226
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,417
Okay, see you next time

227
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,667
Bye, lp

228
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,042
Talk to me if you're not happy

229
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,208
No need to throw a tantrum

230
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,958
Okay, please take a look at your son's drawing

231
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,917
Spend more time with him instead of your pals

232
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:19,792
Let's go inside, okay?

233
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,500
Go

234
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Brother

235
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,875
Where's the martial club street?

236
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:52,792
Martial club!

237
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,667
Go straight ahead

238
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:28,167
One, two...
249
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,333
Which martial club should be challenge first, Bro?

239
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,750
One... two!
251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,083
One...

240
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,208
Back!

241
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,250
You teach martial arts here?

242
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,250
Come in if you wanna learn

243
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,083
Who's the patriarch?

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,667
l am

245
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,375
My name is Jin

246
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,333
l come here as Fo Shan is famous for martial arts

247
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,750
l'd like to practice with Fo Shan's martial artists

248
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,125
Practice?

249
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,333
Yes!

250
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,708
Provocation rather?

251
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm  obliged

252
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:07,500
Okay!

253
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,083
Stand aside

254
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,167
See how I'll beat these out-of-towners!

255
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,417
Not here. Stand over there

256
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,417
What about it?

257
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,583
Wait and see!

258
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,417
Very good!

259
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,167
Where's your master?

260
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,000
Here!

261
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,333
You wanna hack me to death?

262
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,375
Our master is not here

263
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,167
Weather is so treacherous in Fo Shan these days

264
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,375
Let me

265
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,875
What are you drawing, Zhun?

266
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,792
He's ignoring you. Spend more time with him

267
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,667
Okay

268
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,042
So early, Lin?

269
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,250
Yes

270
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,042
I'm  not here to fight. Just a few words

271
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,167
What's the matter?

272
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:49,125
Some out-of-towners are provoking all the clubs

273
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,875
Their kung fu is too good for all the masters

274
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,583
Can you look into that if you can?

275
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,000
That good?

276
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,167
Yes

277
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,375
l gotta go, Mrs lp

278
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,292
Hang in there, Master Liu!

279
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,542
We depend on you, Master Liu!

280
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,583
Damn it

281
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,333
No one in Fo Shan knows martial arts at all

282
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,208
l thought everyone was

283
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,667
lt turns out you are just bums

284
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,833
You can't even fight, let alone defend yourselves

285
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,583
Brothers, our efforts have not been wasted

286
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,792
Nobody in Fo Shan knows martial arts

287
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,583
We'll be rich this time

288
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,292
Brothers, let's keep it up

289
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,875
We open a club here to showthem our might

290
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,500
We will be No.1 in Fo Shan!

291
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:54,750
You think you're good by beating a few nitwits

292
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,500
Wait till you beat the best

293
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,417
Who's the best in Fo Shan?

294
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:01,958
lp Man, of course!

295
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:10,583
Go!

296
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,042
Come with us!

297
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,333
See how we shall defeat Ip Man

298
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,792
Dad, there're lots of people outside

299
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,875
What can I help you?

300
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Sir...they...

301
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,833
Are you Ip Man?

302
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm Jin. Heard that Fo Shan's famous for kung fu

303
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,875
l understand, Master Jin. I understand

304
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,917
You bring a crowd here to challenge me to a duel?

305
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,125
Of course

306
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,792
We're opening a club here to show our might

307
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,167
To open a martial club...

308
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:09,542
you need a good site. No need to fight with me

309
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,417
Please leave!

310
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,958
Uncle

311
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,417
lp Man!

312
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:24,292
Don't dillydally. Are you scared?

313
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,375
You think our house is a martial club?

314
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,375
Who's going to fight with you? Get lost!

315
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,792
You heard that. l won't fight with you

316
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,542
Please leave immediately

317
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:38,958
l heard Wing Chun was invented by a woman

318
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:41,000
That suits you just right

319
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,958
Are you afraid of your wife, lp?

320
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,167
No men are afraid of their wives

321
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:49,583
There're only men who respect their wives

322
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,500
Don't worry, Mrs lp. l won't beat him to death

323
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,917
If you fear he'll lose, I'll use only one hand

324
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,292
lf that's not enough, l can use no hands at all

325
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,875
Fight with him, Master lp! Beat him up!

326
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,792
I'm  too disappointed by Fo Shan. Damn it!

327
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:10,917
So many martial artists but none of them good

328
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,667
Shut up!

329
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,708
Don't break my things

330
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,875
Get out of my way!

331
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:35,458
You rascals

332
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:36,625
You come at the right time

333
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,875
This place is small. Please get outside

334
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,250
and close the door on your way out

335
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,000
You have to redeem our honor

336
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,583
Ask them to leave. Hurry up!

337
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,667
Can l just watch?

338
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,583
Get out

339
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,958
Hurry up! Get out!

340
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,125
Get out! Get out!

341
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,083
Wing Chun, Ip Man

342
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,458
l really wanna see...

343
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:24,500
how a man can fight like a woman

344
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:30,833
Good kung fu does not depend on age or sex

345
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,000
but on how well you fight. You will know later

346
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,083
I'll pay!

347
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:15,458
Good!

348
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:34,292
I'll pay!

349
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,708
Dad, Mom said if you don't start fighting

350
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,833
everything in the house will be broken

351
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,208
Okay

352
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,000
Little rogue

353
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,917
Mind you language

354
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:32,625
Bro...

355
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:33,958
Bro...

356
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,667
You all right, Master

357
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:43,417
I'm  fine!

358
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:12,542
How about that, Master

359
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,542
My kung fu isn't too bad, eh?

360
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,708
That's enough

361
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:20,500
My northern boxing has lost to your southern one

362

00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,750
No, it's not a matter of northern or southern style

363
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,500
The problem is you

364
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:35,583
So who won?

365
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,833
Look how depressed he is. He must have lost

366
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,542
Get lost! Go back to your hometown!

367
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,708
Get lost, you out-of-towners!

368
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:50,958
Master! You fought very well, lp!

Don't be modest. You are Canton's treasure!

378
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,542
How can that be?

379
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:14,833
You're running a business

380
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,000

00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,833
Yes, this is the best in our shop

393
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:36,875
Really?

394
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,333
It's our honor if it can be placed in your house

Thank you

396
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,417
What's the occasion?

397
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,333
Uncle Man. Auntie

398
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,958
You plan on opening a martial club...

399
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,958
why didn't you inform me first?

400
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,000
When did I say that?

401
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,917
Everybody in Fo Shan knows about it

402
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,292
Everybody in Fo Shan but me

403
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,167
Let me help you, Uncle Man

404
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,542
Please accept me as your disciple, Master lp

405
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,583
Master. Madam

406
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:09,625
Bro

407
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,417
You must be the one spreading the rumor

408
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,292
Keep order for me

409
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:16,542
Come. Go yourself

410
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,500
l don't care. Yao has to be your first disciple

411
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,167
Come on. You've known me long enough

412
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,750
l don't like having disciples

413
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,500
Be quiet

414
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:29,042
Stay in order

415
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:33,750
Stay in order and hail: Master lp! Master lp...

416
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:49,583
Master lp! Master lp...

417
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,542
On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Incident broke out.
Japan invaded China

418
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:04,500
robbing its people of their livelihood and causing
rampant starvation all over the country.

419
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,958
In October, 193
Fo Shan was occupied by the Japanese army

420
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:02,625
...who destroyed factories, infrastructures and
buildings.

421
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:07,333
The population of Fo Shan shrunk
from more than 300,000 to just over 70,000.

422
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:12,250
Only a dozen factories in the whole city
remained in operation still.

423
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:25,583
 Ip's residence was also confiscated and
turned into the headquarters the Japanese army.

424
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:29,500
 Ip's family was rendered homeless,
living an abject existence.

425
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,750
Cheng, I'll step out for a sec. Will be right back

426
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,125
Wait

427
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,792
It's cold outside. Wear a jacket

428
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,958
Hurry up. Me this side, you that side

429
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,792
Be careful, Zhun. Don't hurt others

430
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,125
I'll give you more, Master lp

431
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,583
Thank you

432
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,417
Don't push! One by one

433
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:39,542
Don't push

434
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:41,458
One by one

435
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,625
You get out of the way!

436
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:07,000
The mill may be old but it's still productive

437
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,167
Fo Shan is very chaotic these days

438
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,875
You left already. Why did you come back?

439
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:19,792
Who's going to feed the workers otherwise?

440
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,625
All my money is invested in this mill

441
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,375
l can't pay you back for now

442
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,708
Don't worry. l almost forgot

443
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,500
No, I'll consider you a shareholder then

444
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,708
Let me calculate...

445
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,917
you should have ten percent shares

446
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,333
It's really unnecessary

447
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:41,708
Stay and help out, now that you own it too

448
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:44,958
Uncle lp

449
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,125
Yao

450
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,958
You'll be helping out? That's great!

451
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:49,958
Everyone will be lively under your leadership

452
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,250
And l can watch you practice

453
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,583
lp, stay for lunch. It's lunchtime for the workers

454
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,750
Yes, let's have lunch together

455
00:39:58,542 --> 00:39:59,417
No, thanks

456
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,958
I'm  not free. Next time

457
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:04,292
Goodbye

458
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,375
Dad, why didn't you ask Uncle Ip to stay?

459
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,333
He doesn't like to owe people favors

460
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:31,208
Dad, you used to practice martial arts, right?

461
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:33,208
Why did you stop?

462
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,917
l get hungry when l exercise

463
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,042
So l need to exercise less, okay?

464
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:42,125
Got it. l won't play outside from now on

465
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:46,167
You'll only stop playing today. Go eat

466
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,167
Hurry up and eat

467
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,333
This congee is a bit too thick

468
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,375
But you need to eat some

469
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,458
Be careful it's hot

470
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,042
How much rice is left at home?

471
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,333
Don't worry

472
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:31,375
I've pawned everything worth pawning

473
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:36,417
l am strong. l can look for a job

474
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:37,750
It's not the end of the world

475
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,833
You look for a job?

476
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,417
l didn't need to work. But it's different now

477
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,750
There's always a first time

478
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,583
We have enough people here

479
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:56,292
We don't need to hire more. Sorry

480
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,167
Boss, are you hiring?

481
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,500
No

482
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:03,750
Thank you

483
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:09,792
You want to hire me, Boss...

484
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,125
Boss...

485
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,917
You, you, you... Come up here...

486
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,167
You want to hire me, Boss...

487
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:16,667
Here

488
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,167
You're looking for a job, Master lp?

489
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,375
Come, come up...

490
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,125
Thank you

491
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,167
Brother lp!

492
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:04,750
You can't dress like that to work

493
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,292
l didn't expect to pour coals here

494
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,625
How are you, Master lp?

495
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:11,958
How are you?

496
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,792
How are you, Master lp?

497
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,000
So many martial club masters here?

498
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,500
The boss here used to practice martial arts too

499
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:27,083
That's why he likes to employ martial artists

500
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,792
By the way, are you still practicing?

501
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:34,000
l'd rather used my time to scrape a living

502
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:55,333
l can't finish it all. Help me, okay?

503
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,625
Eat some

504
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,083
How're your wife and son?

505
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:08,333
They're fine. Thank you

506
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:13,250
Did you find your brother?

507
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,625
l couldn't locate him since he left

508
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:17,000
Don't know if he's still alive

509
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,583
l don't even have the chance to say sorry

510
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:29,625
What have you lost?

511
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,625
l lost an iron box

512
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:32,875
What iron box?

513
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:34,958
Japanese solders are coming!

514
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,250
Dear workers

515
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:58,875
This is Colonel Sato

516
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:02,125
He appreciates Chinese martial arts

517
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,667
He knows Fo Shan is famous for martial arts

518
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,208
He wants to find Chinese martial artists
to fight with the Japanese

519
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,667
Would anyone want to go?

520
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:13,458
Would anyone want to go?

521
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:19,000
Would anyone want to go?

522
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:26,792
Master?

523
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,792
You want us to be sandbags?

524
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:36,042
There's no door, l tell you!

525
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:38,875
Airhead

526
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:41,542
Whoever that wins will get one sack of rice

527
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:48,083
Whoever that wins will get one sack of rice

528
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,458
I'll go!

529
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,417
Lin...

530
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,083
Don't get into trouble

531
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,417
I'm  going too! Me too!

532
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,208
They took all our rice. Now l can get them back

533
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:00,917
The world is fair

534
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,167
Forget it

535
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,125
Help me find the iron box

536
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:14,500
Let's go. It's okay. Come

537
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:16,458
Be careful

538
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,917
Come, let's line up

539
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,167
Come, come, come...

540
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,667
Anything else?

541
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,042
No, let's go Yes!

542

00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,167
Master?

543
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:58,458
General

544
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:32,208
Thank you, General!

545
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,292
Got to beat them all

546
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:50,833
Let me join in the fun

547
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:56,042
They're not good enough for General Miura

548
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,833
I'll show the Chinese what Japanese kung fu's like

549
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:04,667
Find three men to fight with me

550
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:08,583
Give them rice even if they lose

551
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:10,542
Yes, sir!

552
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:15,292
I've done you a favor again

553
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:18,792
General Miura will fight with three of you

554
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:23,000
You can get rice whether you win or not

555
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,625
The rice is not important. l just wanna beat them

556
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:27,417
Who will be going?

557
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,042
l will...

558
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,167
Let go of me... Stop shouting!

559
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,000
Lin, you and you... The three of you

560
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,958
Okay!

561
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:36,042
You've spit blood. Stop fighting

562
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:38,708
We've lost

563
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:42,458
General, they admitted defeat

564
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,042
Your really wanna die?

565
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,875
You asshole!

566
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,625
Lin, how are you? Lin...

567
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,583
Lin...

568
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,292
Were you tired today?

569
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,417
Pouring coal is not tiring at all

570
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,125
l saw Lin today

571
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:05,333
Really? How is he?

572
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:06,667
Not bad

573
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:09,917
l didn't expect to see him again

574
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,458
Master Li, Master Hong

575
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:37,500
Master lp

576
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,083
Did you see Lin?

577
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,167
Lin? No

578
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:42,667
No, l didn't

579
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,292
Let's eat first

580
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,667
Lots of us received rice yesterday

581
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,500
General Miura was very satisfied.
Anybody wants to go today?

582
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:11,542
Anybody? Li...

583
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,250
Li...

584
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,792
Where's Lin?

585
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,250
Anybody wants to go?

586
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,250
I'm  asking you.
599
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:22,083
l don't know

587
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,333
Of course you do. You took him away

588
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:27,458
Anybody wants to go?

589
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,458
You'll get rice if you win

590
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,417
Me!

591
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:32,333
lf Master Ip is going, I'll go too!

592
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,667
Me too!

593
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,792
l wanna have a good fight with the Japanese

594
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,458
Anything else l can do?

595
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:42,042
No, you can go

596
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:12,292
Thanks

597
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,958
Can l fight three more people?

598
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:22,583
He said he wanted to fight three more people

599
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,875
That's it for me...

600
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,708
Why did you open fire?

601
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,125
Li! Why did you open fire?

602
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:09,083
Li! Why did you open fire?

603
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:11,542
Who let you open fire?

604
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:18,708
He took the rice even though he's lost

605
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:21,625
so... l wanted to teach him a lesson

606
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,625
This place is for tournaments only

607
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:41,708
Never open fire here anymore

608
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:44,750
Got it!

609
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,667
Please calm down, General Miura

610
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,833
I'll arrange the next tournament for you

611
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,167
Continue!

612
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:17,250
Who else wants to fight?

613
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,292
Me!

614
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,208
Li! Open the gate!

615
00:56:25,667 --> 00:56:27,417
Master... Open the gate!

616
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,875
Tell me, was Lin beaten to death?

617
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,500
Open the gate

618
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:39,625
Master...

619
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:40,500
Open the gate!

620
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,208
Please open the gate

621
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,000
l wanna fight ten people!

622
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,167
You crazy? Please don't

623
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:04,625
l wanna fight ten people!

624
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:14,958
He said he wanted to fight ten people

625
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:23,750
Ten?

626
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,250
Yes

627
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:30,333
Let's see how good he is

628
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,042
Unit 5!

629
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:39,583
Unit 1, Unit 3, Unit 5

630
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,500
Start!

631
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,417
Be careful

632
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,208
Stay back!

633
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,375
Come back again

634
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:47,500
He wants you to come back again

635
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,042
I'm  not here for the rice

636
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,875
He said... he would come back

637
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:02,875
What's your name?

638
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:04,417
He wants to know your name

639
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:13,625
I'm  just a Chinese

640
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:19,000
His name is Ip Man

641
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:52,958
Be careful in the future

642
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,833
l don't know what Miura might do

643
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:01,708
Lackey!

644
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:04,542
Why am I a lackey?

645
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:09,125
Their deaths got nothing to do with me.
I'm  just an interpreter

646
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:11,750
l need to scrape a living too!

647
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:13,292
Scrape a living?

648
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:17,333
You watch your countrymen get beaten to death.

649
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:22,708
l don't have any

650
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,458
You do. You have lots of it

651
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:27,125
lf you have the guts, go beat them up!

652
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:29,292
Beat as many as you can!

653
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:32,667
I'm  an interpreter, not a lackey...

654
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,625
I'm  a Chinese!

655
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,250
I'm  back

656
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,458
Daddy

657
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:35,500
You're back?

658
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:38,333
Have you been good?

659
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:39,125
Yes

660
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:40,667
Good boy

661
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,333
Are you tired today?

662
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,375
Go wash your face first

663
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,000
You're so good

664
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,375
l realize today I'm  useless

665
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:29,500
l can't do anything

666
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,125
l practiced marital arts before

667
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:39,958
But so what?

668
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:47,833
This world...

669
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,750
is minuscule

670
01:05:58,417 --> 01:05:59,708
I'm  so useless

671
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,042
l don't care what the world is like

672
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:08,375
l only know I'm  very happy now

673
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:14,708
As long as you, me, and Zhun...

674
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:19,083
can stay together, everything will be okay

675
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:24,917
It's essential for a family to stay together

676
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:58,208
Get off! Get off!

677
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,458
Get off...

678
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,500
Stand over there! On the side!

679
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,667
Stand over there...

680
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:30,083
Who's the boss? Come out!

681
01:07:34,792 --> 01:07:35,750
l am

682
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,125
l just took your goods. You can buy them back

683
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,500
ls that okay?

684
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,667
l don't have money

685
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:56,083
Don't beat my dad anymore!

686
01:07:58,625 --> 01:07:59,583
Wing Chun?

687
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:05,917
Damn it! Wing Chun?

688
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:07,417
Don't beat him!

689
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:11,958
Do you have money?

690
01:08:12,792 --> 01:08:13,375
l don't

691
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:14,125
Do you?

692
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,042
No...

693
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,292
I'll keep beating you till you have!

694
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:26,042
The goods haven't been sold...

695
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:28,792
l don't have money

696
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:35,375
Uncle lp! Uncle lp...

697
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:38,458
Please save my dad. He's almost beaten to death

698
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:39,917
What's the matter, Yao?

699
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:40,583
Auntie

700
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,375
Let me go see what happens. It's okay

701
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:55,625
I'm  very reasonable

702
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,875
It's fine if you don't have money now

703
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,292
I'll give you some time to raise it

704
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,167
As for the goods, I'll keep them for now

705
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,792
Master lp

706
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:26,208
Dad, are you okay?

707
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,958
I'm  fine. Go help Uncle Fu

708
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,208
How can l help?

709
01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:53,958
l thought your martial arts were impractical

710
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:56,000
Now l know it's very useful

711
01:09:57,542 --> 01:10:00,167
l should've learnt some martial arts from you

712
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:01,875
At least l can de

713
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:06,125
Uncle lp, please stay and teach us martial arts

714
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:09,208
so thatwe can defend myself

715
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:11,750
Master lp

716
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,000
You're such an expert. Please teach us

717
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:20,208
Yes, Master lp. Please teach us

718
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,542
I'm  a businessman

719
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:28,750
l know nothing other than running a business

720
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:32,250
l can't protect them, but you can

721
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:36,875
In peaceful days, it's okay if you refused to teach

722
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:41,708
But in bad times now, shouldn't you do something?

723
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:46,625
Teaching martial arts is very costly

724
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,917
Are you paying their fees? You owe me again?

725
01:10:57,417 --> 01:10:59,917
Uncle lp, I'll be your first disciple

726
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,333
Dad, l wanna be taller

727
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,000
Taller?

728
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,333
Why hasn't Ip Man come back?

729
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:40,750
l... l don't know...

730
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,083
Find him

731
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:50,333
l don't know where he is

732
01:12:50,542 --> 01:12:51,833
l don't know how to find him

733
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,417
How big is Fo Shan?

734
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,833
How difficult can it be to find him?

735
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:01,208
Fo Shan is indeed very big

736
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:07,917
No...

737
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:10,208
Please don't...

738
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,333

739
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,625
Useless thing! Enough!

740
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:29,417
Asshole!

741
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:31,375
Paper, stone, scissors!

742
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,000
You lost You colluded?

743
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:37,333
Hide well

744
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:41,208
10, 9, 8, 7...

745
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,250
Zhun

746
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:43,750
That way

747
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:45,750

749
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:53,292
Master

750
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,417
What're you here for?

751
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,292
Miura wants you to go back and fight him

752
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:02,542
Go away

753
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,458

754
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:22,042

Why not? What do you want?

756
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,417
What do you want?

757
01:14:33,042 --> 01:14:34,208
How pretty!

758
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,875
Shit

You're a piece of shit!

763
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,875
How could you let Ip run away?

764
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,583
I'm  sorry...

765
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:01,708
Even Colonel Sato could not stop him...

766
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:09,125
I've tried my best already...

767
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,417
Sorry

768
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,542
Shut up!

769
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:15,583
Utterly useless!

770
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:18,417
Tell them...

771
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:23,958

772
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:25,792
Yes, sir

773
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,375
Little Sis

Brother, eat something

775
01:16:56,958 --> 01:16:57,708
How's the master?

776
01:16:58,208 --> 01:16:59,792
Okay. They are all fine

777
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:07,458
Master

778
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:08,792
Coming

779
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:13,708

01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:20,375
So are you well adapted here?

782
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:22,125

l really don't know what to say

788
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:38,542
Thank you

789
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:40,958
It's okay

790
01:18:04,542 --> 01:18:06,167
We better leave Fo Shan as soon as possible

791
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,958
Quan is trying to find a solution for us

792
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:11,292
Where shall we go?

793
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,750
Hong Kong

794
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,792
In fact, it doesn't matter where

795
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,583
l still have some friends in Hong Fong

796
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:26,042
lf something happens to me...

797
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,083
What can happen to you?

798
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,792
Nothing will happen to you

799
01:18:35,542 --> 01:18:37,292
They are here again! Let's scram!

800
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,458
They are here! They are here!

801
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:05,333
ls the money ready?

802
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,167
We won't give you money!

803
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,250
What did you say?

804
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:14,875
I'm  not afraid of you! You can't bully us!

805
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,333
You want me to beat you up?

806
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,542
Damn it!

807
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,083
just beat him up!

808
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,542
Stop it!

809
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:32,417
No wonder they dare to resist

810
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,875
They've found a bodyguard

811
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:38,458
You spurned me for opening a club in Fo Shan

812
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:42,208
And today, you wanna mess with me again?

813
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:45,500
You wanna chase me away?

814
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,125
No one wanna chase you away

815
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:51,375
lp, have you ever been hungry every day?

816
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:55,417
Everybody is hungry nowadays

817
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,833
The first day l came to Fo Shan, l told myself...

818
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,583
l would never be hungry again

819
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,125
l will never be hungry again!

820
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:06,542
Feep beating!

821
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:15,625
Beat them!

822
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,458
Yuan, why you still idling here? Go!

823
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:26,208
Fill them!

824
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:29,833
Fill them!

825
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:42,792
Go

826
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,792
How can we get near him?

827
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:39,958
Let's go!

828
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:45,125
Master, you were so good!

829
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:55,917
Yuan

830
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,125
Stop there!

831
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,125
You know what you're doing?

832
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:12,083
l know. I'm  a robber

833
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,375
You're robbing the Chinese

834
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:16,833
l'd rather be the bully than the bullied

835
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,083
l want everyone to be scared of me!

836
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:24,000
Your brother asked me to give this...
Don't talk about him!

837
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:30,292
You know your brother is dead?

838
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:32,667
He's beaten to death by the Japanese

839
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:44,083
He looked for you everywhere but couldn't find you

840
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:51,042
Everyone needs to choose his own path

841
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:02,958
Master

842
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:07,125
That guy told Miura you're at the cotton mill

843
01:26:07,208 --> 01:26:08,667
Don't go back, ok?

844
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:12,000
l gotta go. Remember, don't go back

845
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:49,500
Scram! Hurry up!

846
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,458


847
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,042


848
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,333
Don't say a word

849
01:27:02,167 --> 01:27:03,708
You, come here

850
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:07,875
Where's Ip Man?

851
01:27:08,667 --> 01:27:10,583
Tell me!

852
01:27:11,667 --> 01:27:13,167
I'm  asking you!

853
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:14,917
Hang in there. I'll figure out something

854
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:16,958
Speak!

855
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,042
Speak! Speak up...

856
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:22,125
I'm  here! I'm  Ip Man...

857
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:24,333
I'm  here... Li!

858
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:27,208
Wait! Wait!

859
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:29,083
Please wait!

860
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:32,458
Li, tell Miura the workers are innocent

861
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:34,750
Ask Miura to release them

862
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,333
l told you not to come back.
876
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,333
Tell him!

863
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:38,833
Shit!

864
01:27:43,083 --> 01:27:44,000
Sato!

865
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:51,417
He dares to hit me... Can't we put him to death?

866
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,792
l know what I'm  doing

867
01:27:53,583 --> 01:27:54,708
Li Yes

868
01:27:56,458 --> 01:28:00,875
Since the day you resisted the Japanese army

869
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:04,208
you've already been a dead man

870
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:10,125
But you're talented, you can be useful to us

871
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:20,000
So I'll give you one chance to be loyal
to the Japanese Emperor

872
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:24,167
Teach our army Chinese kung fu

873
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:28,667
That way, we might still spare your life

874
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:34,083
He wanted you to teach the Japanese kung fu

875
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:37,917
l won't teach the Japanese

876
01:28:38,917 --> 01:28:42,750
You wanna see me fight? I'll fight with you

877
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:54,083
He said he would think about it

878
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:59,958
He wants to have a duel with General Miura

879
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,417
Take him away!

880
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:05,708
Take him away!

881
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:14,875
Quan, take my wife and kid away from Fo Shan

882
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:20,750
Master lp...

883
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:28,708
General, you really wanna fight with lp?

884
01:29:29,167 --> 01:29:30,208
Of course

885
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:32,917
He's an expert

886
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:34,958
But he doesn't look like...

887
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:38,333
he wants to teach the Imperial Army

888
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:42,167
He must have other motives trying to fight with you

889
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:46,333
General, don't fight with him

890
01:29:47,042 --> 01:29:49,792
Let me simply shoot him dead

891
01:29:54,250 --> 01:30:00,500
He challenges me to a fight

892
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:04,083
because he thinks he's better than me

893
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:08,500
lf l refuse to accept the challenge

894
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:15,708
but shoot him instead...

895
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:24,083
isn't that the same as admitting defeat?

896
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:27,333
Fighting with a Chinese

897
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:31,208
is not just a matter of personal honor for you

898
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:35,458
lt has to do with the national honor of our Empire

899
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:37,708
Are you saying l will lose?

900
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:41,458
l only fear for the worst

901
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,333
l will win for sure

902
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,500
I'll let the whole China know I've won

903
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:50,083
Yes! l understand!

904
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:32,667
l want you to teach us instead of killing you

905
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,792
because l appreciate your talent

906
01:31:35,917 --> 01:31:42,333
But l don't think Chinese kung fu
is better than Japanese

907
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,375
We will fight in front of everybody

908
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,417
That's why we need a fair tournament

909
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:57,667
You invaded our country and killed our people

910
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,542
Stop being hypocritical

911
01:32:07,458 --> 01:32:08,500
Excuse me

912
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,458
Let go of me! Let me go back! Let go of my mom...

913
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:30,750
l promised Ip nothing would happen to you

914
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:32,542
It's too dangerous to go back

915
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:41,417
I heard the Japanese are fighting the Chinese

916
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,792
Who's fighting? Lp Man

917
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,500
Look, the whole place is sealed up now

918
01:32:51,917 --> 01:32:52,833
In the past...

919
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:56,375
l wished he could be with me every day

920
01:32:58,375 --> 01:33:00,667
So l always complained about his practice

921
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:05,417
Every time he had a duel with someone...

922
01:33:06,708 --> 01:33:08,083
l would throw a tantrum

923
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:14,583
l never truly supported him

924
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
doing what he liked

925
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:19,333
Now...

926
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:23,417
This could be his last duel

927
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:29,292
I fear there won't be another chance

928
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:32,958
Why don't you give me this chance?

929
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,125
Why?

930
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:44,542
General Miura says...

931
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:47,958
For the sake of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange

932
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:51,375
he is having a fair tournament with Master Ip today

933
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:55,375
to share their knowledge in a friendly manner,

934
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,750
and to bring true peace between the two countries

935
01:33:58,583 --> 01:34:00,792
Fair tournament? ls it possible?

936
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:05,583
That traitor will surely be killed by the Japanese

937
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:07,042
That's right

938
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:09,417
Shut up!

939
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:16,500
Here comes Master lp!

940
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:31,833
General Miura talked about a tournament

941
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:33,958
But l don't give a damn!

942
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:35,625
Listen up

943
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,083
lf you win

944
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:43,583
l will kill you

945
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:44,583
Remember this!

946
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:45,375
Yes!

947
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,000
You better let Miura win later

948
01:34:50,792 --> 01:34:52,250
Or he won't let you live

949
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:56,333
It's more important to stay alive

950
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:01,792
Although martial arts involves armed forces

951
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:05,542
Chinese martial arts is Confucian in spirit

952
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:08,833
The virtue of martial arts is benevolence

953
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:12,792
You Japanese will never understand the principle
of treating other people as you would yourselves

954
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,250
Because you abuse military power

955
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,292
You turned it into violence to oppress others

956
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,542
You don't deserve to learn Chinese martial arts

957
01:38:51,333 --> 01:39:14,292
lp Man! Ip Man!

958
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:41,792
lp Man refused to be subjugated by the Japanese army...

959
01:41:42,042 --> 01:41:47,375
...and used his fists to call forth
the unity ofthe Chinese people.

960
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,667
Assisted by his good friend Zhou Qingquan,

961
01:41:54,917 --> 01:42:00,250
the wounded Ip Man successfully
fled Fo Shan with his wife and son.

962
01:42:06,125 --> 01:42:09,292
On August 15, 1945

963
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:13,583
Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced
that Japan would surrender unconditionally.

964
01:42:13,667 --> 01:42:19,292
The Chinese finally won and
ended a war that lasted eight long years.

965
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:25,917
In 1949, the Grandmaster Ip Man settled in Hong Kong.

966
01:42:26,417 --> 01:42:31,750
He started his first Wing Chun class at
Kowloon Hotel's Staff Association Headquarters

967
01:42:31,917 --> 01:42:35,375
turning a new leaf in his life.

968
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:38,917
In 1967, Grandmaster Ip Man started
the Wing Chun Athletic Association to foster...

969
01:42:39,167 --> 01:42:41,625
...the spirit of Wing Chun
with a group of like-minded enthusiasts,

970
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:46,292

01:42:48,417 --> 01:42:53,417
Until now,
renowned branch of Chinese martial arts.

972
