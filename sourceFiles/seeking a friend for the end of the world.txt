1
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,725
Okay, what
we're getting now is, yes,

2
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,263
they're saying it was, in
fact, a fire that erupted

3
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,263
inside the external tank
of the ship

4
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,358
exactly 98 seconds after it
entered the asteroid field.

5
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,131
No one is sure
what caused the fire

6
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,830
which led to
the massive explosion

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,999
killing all 12
crew members and scientists

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,906
aboard the space
shuttle Deliverance,

9
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,638
taking with them our
last and only hope.

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,441
Once again,
if you're just tuning in,

11
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,209
the CSA space shuttle
Deliverance

12
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,341
has been destroyed.

13
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,249
The final mission to
save mankind has failed.

14
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,517
The 70-mile-wide asteroid
known commonly as “Matilda”

15
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,855
is set to collide with Earth
in exactly three weeks' time,

16
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,917
and we'll be bringing you
up-to-the-minute coverage

17
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,156
of our countdown
to the end of days,

18
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,063
along with all your
classic rock favorites.

19
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,795
This is Q 107. 2

20
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,433
I think we missed
the exit.

21
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,547
...they say the damage
to the tower has rendered

22
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,243
all cellular
telephones useless.

23
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,444
No word yet on how long
before water and power

24
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,885
will be shut off altogether.

25
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,013
But we'll be bringing you
all the information you need

26
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,580
just as long as
we have a live feed.

27
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,684
And be sure to stay tuned at 9:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time

28
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,251
for the End of the World
Awareness Concert.

29
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,831
The human
migration continues...

30
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,939
Sorry, dude!
It's okay.

31
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,171
What are you doing?

32
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,909
Hey, up yours, pal!

33
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,374
I'm sorry, sir,

34
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,966
that's not covered
under your current policy.

35
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm afraid the Armageddon
package is extra, yes.

36
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,909
Well, that protects you
and your family

37
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,454
against any sort of
apocalyptic disaster.

38
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,855
Asteroids, obviously,
plague, famine, locusts...

39
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,055
Drawbacks? Um...

40
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,593
The premiums are high...

41
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,468
I'm sorry... Can you just hold
on for one moment? Thank you.

42
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,966
So feel free to wear

43
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,638
your casual Friday clothing
pretty much any day of the week.

44
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:01,009
And since Ted in Human Resources
is no longer with us,

45
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:09,350
I thought I'd let you all know of a
few positions in upper management

46
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,827
that have been
made available.

47
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:17,592
So, if anyone wants to be
Chief Financial Officer...

48
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,860
CFO? Anyone?

49
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,004
Life has no meaning.

50
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,201
Anyone?

51
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,802
I really think I'm coming
down with something.

52
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,746
On your right!

53
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,606
On your right, buddy.

54
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,741
On your right!

55
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,081
You could have
told me that yesterday!

56
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,965
Linda?

57
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,068
Oh, hi, Elsa.

58
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,303
Hi, Mr. Dodge.

59
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,840
Okay, I finish.
Okay.

60
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,302
Me estoy volviendo vieja, Mr. Dodge.
I getting older.

61
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,281
I didn't mean to rush
you off or anything.

62
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,516
Do you have
someplace to be?

63
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,587
I mean, if you want,
you could...

64
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,628
I don't know,
you could watch TV here,

65
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,166
or something,
whatever you like.

66
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,358
Oh, my kids are waiting.

67
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,630
Oh, right. Of course.
You have kids.

68
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,971
Listen, Elsa, you don't
have to come next week.

69
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:09,272
Or, you know, ever, if you
don't want to It's okay.

70
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,543
You firing me?

71
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,379
No, no, no. No, l just...

72
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,076
Is this because I don't
watch TV with you?

73
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,054
No. No. I, uh...

74
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,553
I just thought
considering..

75
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,188
There's just no need to...

76
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,196
Nothing.
Forget it. It's fine.

77
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,331
You're out of windose.

78
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,535
More Windose, got it.

79
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,640
See you next week, Mr. Dodge.

80
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,942
Okay.

81
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,711
I regret my entire life.

82
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,013
Okay-
Okay-

83
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,382
Bye!
Bye, now.

84
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,388
Well, it's no
longer just the postal service.

85
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,619
Commercial airlines have
discontinued altogether today.

86
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,491
After much delay, the final flight,
piloted by Delta Airlines,

87
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,259
left Chicago Midway
at 3:45 Central Time,

88
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,391
touching down in
Seattle at 6:15 Pacific.

89
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,629
Private charters have been
given military clearance

90
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,672
to use intercontinental
airspace at their own risk.

91
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,697
And now
the traffic report. Amy?

92
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,900
We're fucked, Bob.

93
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,375
Thank you, Amy.

94
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,716
Oh, shit.

95
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,836
...they have yet to
make a statement regarding rumors

96
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,849
of a classified space launch for
high-ranking government officials,

97
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,010
religious figureheads,
and important contributors

98
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,350
to athletics
and entertainment.

99
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,347
They have predicted
the exact location of impact,

100
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,519
but the government is refusing to
release this information to the public

101
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,291
to avoid creating an even
greater sense of panic.

102
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,754
Oh! You're early!
Hi.

103
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,189
Aw. Warren told me
about Linda.

104
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,248
Oh, yeah...

105
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,920
I am so surprised
she didn't do it sooner.

106
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,920
She never really
looked happy,

107
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,591
especially when
she was with you.

108
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,566
That's new information.

109
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,069
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

110
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,729
Why do you think she
didn't want to have kids?

111
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,702
Karen Amalfi is
coming alone tonight.

112
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,242
Don't. Do not.

113
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,800
Do not what?

114
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,510
Please, Warren. Can we just have
a few sober moments tonight?

115
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,845
This is the
Last Supper, Diane.

116
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,684
You think Jesus was sober
for his last supper?

117
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,519
You think he turned
water into lemonade?

118
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,025
Dodge,
a little help, please.

119
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,357
Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no.
Dodge is my friend.

120
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,829
My friend.
Look at this, my friend.

121
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,458
This is a Don Ramon cigar.

122
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,231
This is the hardest
cigar in the world...

123
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,274
Can you chop those
a little louder, please?

124
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,942
This is the hardest cigar
in the world to find.

125
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,173
And tonight, I'm going to share
one of my last 13 with you.

126
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,505
How's that sit?

127
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,209
Hi, Danny.

128
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,084
Hey, can I fix you
a drink, son?

129
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,181
Quit ruining my life.

130
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,319
Good for you, sweetie.
Express yourself.

131
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,452
Go fuck yourself!

132
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,496
I was thinking
maybe we should set up

133
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,429
Dodge with Karen.
Don't you think?

134
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,994
Oh, my God,
will you stop it?

135
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,658
What?

136
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,569
He doesn't want to get set up
with one of your gross friends.

137
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,130
He needs to
meet somebody!

138
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,300
No, he doesn't!

139
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,139
Leave him alone. He is
alone, look at him.

140
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,906
I'm fine. No, honey,
you're not fine.

141
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,346
You're gonna die alone.
Doesn't that bother you?

142
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,110
He's not gonna die alone.
Yes, he is.

143
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,312
He's not gonna die alone. He's
gonna die with everybody else!

144
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,855
There's just no need
to cling to who's closest.

145
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,517
This isn't
the fucking Ark, Diane.

146
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,586
This is the Titanic!

147
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:22,457
And there is
not a life raft in sight.

148
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,871
Welcome aboard.

149
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,566
Dodge, you remember
Karen Amalfi.

150
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,232
Hello, good to see you.

151
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,710
Hi.

152
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,182
It's everything
I never wore.

153
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,051
Ta-da!
Mmm!

154
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,655
It's very nice,
very shiny.

155
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,788
You're funny.

156
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,662
Hmm.

157
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,303
So...

158
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,101
Well...

159
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,813
We decided that we would use
this time to be with family.

160
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,979
First we're gonna go to West
Virginia, see my sister

161
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,149
and her husband
and the two boys.

162
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,488
Even though
we just saw them.

163
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,288
We just saw them.

164
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,857
And then Lacey wants to go
to her stepfather's in Aspen

165
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,562
so that she can
tell him to fuck off.

166
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,962
And also ski!

167
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,631
And ski.

168
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,437
- Great!
- Yeah.

169
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,203
Karen?

170
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,436
Oh.

171
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,138
Um... Hmm.

172
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,212
Okay, well, I think I'm finally
gonna take that pottery class.

173
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,688
And... Well, I'm gonna
eat whatever I want,

174
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,624
and totally
not even care. Just...

175
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,261
Go, girl.

176
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,622
And maybe I'll, um,

177
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,195
be spending a little time
with someone special.

178
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,103
Yeah.

179
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,544
Oh, me? Let's see...

180
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:19,741
What was the question?

181
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,151
Qué sera, sera!

182
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,219
We're gonna ski first,
and then she's gonna tell...

183
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:35,163
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

184
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,996
Fight through the burn, fight through the burn!
Fight through the burn!

185
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,279
Yes!

186
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,218
Yes!

187
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,416
Winner's wine!

188
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,160
Hey, Dodge!
Hey, Roache.

189
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:08,722
Dodger! I'm gonna miss you, man.
Gonna miss you...

190
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,768
Oh, boy. It's the fucking
Wild West, you know?

191
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,168
Is it?
Come on.

192
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,698
Single guys like us, I mean, we
gotta grab this thing, you know?

193
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,870
Because it is
a different world now.

194
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,277
It's a different world.

195
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,144
Okay.
We gotta... You know?

196
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,706
No, I don't. I don't...

197
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,774
I don't...
You don't? Dude,

198
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,020
the sky is falling.

199
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,213
The sky is falling.

200
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,889
And it's raining pussy!

201
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,662
It's raining pussy

202
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,222
Dude, ever since
Deliverance, man,

203
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,202
I've been with a different
girl every day.

204
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,363
And they don't care
about getting pregnant.

205
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,203
They don't care
about diseases,

206
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,401
or are you gonna
call them back,

207
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,841
or can you
provide for them,

208
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,039
or do you have
a small dick,

209
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:00,140
or are you related.
All right?

210
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,585
And it's like
the apocalypse...

211
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:07,055
The apocalypse has
leveled the field, man.

212
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:11,151
Oh, my God. Do you want to
double-stuff that cookie?

213
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,891
Do you want to
double-stuff that cookie with me?

214
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,798
Two chefs in the kitchen

215
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,269
We're double-stuffing the
cookie Dodge and Roache

216
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,571
You guys, look! Sarah and
Dave brought heroin.

217
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,407
It's time.
Bucket list! Bucket list!

218
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,311
Wait, where's Lacey? Let Lacey
do it, she's a dental assistant.

219
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,747
I'll do it.
Yeah, you do it, Lace.

220
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,079
Here we go.

221
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,482
Oh,
don't grab, Roache.

222
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,178
Let's watch her, let's
everyone watch her do it.

223
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,382
Put some
Radiohead on.

224
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,083
I want to do heroin
to Radiohead.

225
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,087
Yeah! Yeah!

226
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,993
This is dynamite!
Everybody, run!

227
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,094
I'm kidding! It's not.

228
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,966
It can't hurt you unless you
get about this close to it.

229
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,382
Are you hiding?

230
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,377
Yes.

231
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,814
You don't have to do heroin
if you don't want to, sweetie.

232
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,416
Look, I tried.

233
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,429
I just can't spend the last month
of my life getting to know someone.

234
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,486
It's ridiculous.

235
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,493
You don't like Karen?

236
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,300
I couldn't
possibly give a shit.

237
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,808
I'm not gonna sit across from
someone and hear all their stories,

238
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,470
even if she was someone I
could be interested in,

239
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,570
because I just...

240
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,646
I'm not sure that the month
between my wife leaving me

241
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,415
and the end of the world sounds
like good timing Do you?

242
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,355
What... Hey... What are you doing?
What are you doing?

243
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,017
What?

244
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,788
What?
What?

245
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,954
You're Warren's.

246
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,424
No, I'm not.

247
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,162
Nobody's anybody's
anything anymore.

248
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,111
Why did Linda
get to disappear?

249
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,979
Why does everybody else
get to do what they want?

250
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,846
I don't know
what I want.

251
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,730
You can't run
from this, Dodge.

252
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,277
Hello?

253
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,952
You okay?

254
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,249
No.

255
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,551
How could I be so stupid?

256
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,192
I don't know.
I don't know you very well.

257
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,292
I'm never gonna
see my family again.

258
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,735
I missed the planes,
all of them.

259
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:20,670
I mean, God, it's the end of the
world and I'm still 15 minutes late.

260
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,007
I can hear my father say it now.
I can hear him say,

261
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,845
"Flaky and irresponsible,"
and he's right.

262
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,148
How could I do this? I put my
energy in the wrong places,

263
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,780
I give my time to
the wrong people.

264
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,188
I mean,
when I think of all the...

265
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,749
All the holidays I didn't
spend with my mum and dad

266
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,261
to be with some guy
I used to know.

267
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,834
Would you like to come in?

268
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,103
I won't steal anything
if you don't rape me.

269
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,211
Agreed.

270
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,151
My name's Penny.

271
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,250
I'm Dodge.

272
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,096
How long have you
lived here?

273
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,132
Three years. You?

274
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,363
I just broke up
with someone.

275
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,905
Oh, I'm sorry.

276
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,133
No, I mean...

277
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,005
You know,
it was building to this.

278
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,409
He's just taking the night
to clear out his stuff.

279
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,875
I mean, it's always better
to sleep on the fire escape

280
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,076
than have pity sex,
I always say.

281
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,140
Mmm.

282
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,921
What's that?

283
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,359
What? Oh, that is cough
syrup with codeine.

284
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,826
Splash of vodka.
Can I have a sip?

285
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,658
Actually, I'm
feeling a little...

286
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,822
Mmm.

287
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,058
You want some weed?

288
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,156
Hmm?

289
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,701
Oh, no, thank you.

290
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,436
It's the only thing
that sends me to sleep

291
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,336
and the only thing
that wakes me up again.

292
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,840
I mean, seriously,

293
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,466
I've got a wicked
case of hypersomnia.

294
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,942
I mean, I could sleep
through the apocalypse.

295
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,945
Who's the girl?
Who?

296
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,617
Oh. That's Olivia.

297
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,289
Is she the one
that got away?

298
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,528
Well, they all got away,
but she was the first, yeah.

299
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,729
Are you gonna go
and get her back?

300
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,030
I'm sure she has
enough on her plate.

301
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,040
And what is it about
the end of the world

302
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,768
that brings them
all out of the woodwork?

303
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,623
...there he's got it.

304
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,533
Yeah.
He changed his mind, as he...

305
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,600
...doing a terrific
job of cutting him off.

306
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,566
Now coming from behind,

307
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,477
he's got him around the
shoulders, and down goes...

308
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,979
Oh.

309
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,856
I'm ready to go
downstairs now.

310
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,624
Oh?

311
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,969
Wait here a tick.

312
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,205
Okay.

313
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,680
He's gone. Took my Pet Sounds with him.
I should've seen that coming.

314
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,113
Mmm.

315
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,324
So...

316
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,564
So...

317
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,834
What are you doing
with the rest of your life?

318
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,257
Oh, um...

319
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,104
Little of this,
little of that.

320
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,164
Probably catching
up on some "me" time.

321
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,675
Find God.

322
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,610
Maybe move around
some chairs.

323
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,216
Well, maybe I'll run into
you at a support group

324
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,376
or an orgy or something.

325
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,919
Yeah, that sounds nice.

326
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:58,910
Uh...

327
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,445
What's that?

328
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,684
That's your mail.

329
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,551
Why do you have it?

330
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,357
Oh, you know how the mailman
would sometimes put the mail

331
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,726
in the wrong box?
Uh-huh.

332
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,960
Well, overtime, say like... Well,
three years, I mean, it...

333
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,968
God, it really
adds up, doesn't it?

334
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,267
Isn't it funny?
I mean, how we've lived

335
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,205
so close and
we've never said hi.

336
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,470
Oh, but I did meet
your roommate a few times.

337
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,205
My roommate?
You mean Linda?

338
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,441
Linda. Linda, right. And her
boyfriend, what was his name?

339
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,246
Oh, God, they seemed so happy together.
What was his name?

340
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,286
I haven't seen them in awhile.
Are they all right?

341
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,878
What was his name again?

342
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,248
I forget.

343
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,781
$8.50.

344
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,966
Come on.

345
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,240
Give it to me!
I'll hit it!

346
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,743
Fuck, yeah! Hit it!

347
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,102
What started as a few
individuals acting out

348
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,436
has quickly escalated
into a massive riot

349
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,669
sweeping through
the streets of downtown

350
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,938
If we could show
the live footage, Dory?

351
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,370
Dory?

352
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,042
You see people using
every available weapon,

353
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,107
looting, smashing windows,

354
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,915
setting fires, and in some
cases, attacking one another.

355
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,218
With the lack of
police presence,

356
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,919
we are seeing people
with nothing left to lose.

357
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,864
They appear to be
moving off Main Street

358
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,660
and heading to wards
Division Avenue,

359
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,463
where residences and
businesses are more at risk.

360
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,565
And perhaps
it's only a matter of time

361
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,107
before the city is
too dangerous to inhabit.

362
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,446
Oh, my God.

363
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,953
Oh, God.

364
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,535
Oh, God.

365
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,663
Okay. Okay.

366
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:17,109
Oh, Sorry. Okay.
Good, Sorry. Here we go.

367
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,514
Come on.

368
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,855
Penny?

369
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,692
Penny! Penny?

370
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,730
Penny!
Who the fuck are you?

371
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,291
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

372
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,563
I'm sorry. I'm Dodge,
I live upstairs.

373
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,002
I've never
seen you before.

374
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,630
We've run into each other a
few times, but that's not...

375
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,868
I'm pretty good with faces.

376
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,338
Anyway... Obviously,
there's a riot going on.

377
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,180
Maybe you heard the screaming,
smelled the burning.

378
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,444
If you could
just wake up Penny

379
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,508
I think we should get out of the
building as soon as possible.

380
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,951
Jesus.

381
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,288
You're fucking her,
aren't you?

382
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,849
What? No... What?
No, I'm...

383
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:04,985
No. I'm not.

384
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,120
Oh, I knew it!

385
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,990
I knew it.

386
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,732
Fuck! I knew it!

387
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,966
Ow! Ow! Ow!

388
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,197
Shit!

389
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,671
Okay, all right.

390
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,799
Penny! Come on,
here we go. Wake up.

391
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,933
There you go.

392
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:20,999
Hey! I decide
when Penny wakes up!

393
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,511
This isn't what
it looks like.

394
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,671
I broke my hand, baby.

395
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,840
I hope you're happy. It's my guitar hand.

396
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,440
Aren't they both
your guitar hands?

397
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,644
Penny, there's a small riot brewing
and we need to go, right now!

398
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,085
She's not going
anywhere with you...

399
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,485
Would you
please just stop?

400
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,684
We all need to go! Come on! Here we go!
Here we go, guys! Come on!

401
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,785
My hand! My gift. Will you
just look at it? I broke it.

402
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,919
This is the guy?

403
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,692
I can't believe you want
this creep instead of me.

404
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,030
Hey! Hey! I'm not kidding!
Let's do it!

405
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,569
Oh, he's old!

406
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,194
He's not even good-looking.
What, do you have a job?

407
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,864
Mister Job?
Owen!

408
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,773
I told you there wasn't anybody
else Oh, shit, my records.

409
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,302
So you broke up
with me for nobody?

410
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,006
Do you not see
how that's worse?

411
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,674
We don't have time for this.

412
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,946
Scott Walker, Wilco...
John Cale!

413
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,145
Hey, that's my Cale.

414
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,950
We don't have time
for any of this, guys!

415
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,086
Goodbye, friends!

416
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,386
Come on.

417
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,721
Give me that Cale.

418
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,920
Okay, here we go.

419
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:12,984
I'll drive.

420
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,962
- All right, all right.
- Hey!

421
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,831
Watch out for my hand.

422
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,265
Here we go.

423
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,070
I can't believe you're
breaking up with me now.

424
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,572
It's the worst timing
for me, ever!

425
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:24,834
We didn't
get back together.

426
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,603
What do you call last night?
Nothing happened!

427
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,337
Since when is
snuggling nothing?

428
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,106
Shit. I thought
it was right there.

429
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,272
You don't remember
where you parked?

430
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,406
No, it was...
It was on...

431
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,882
It was on 1st and 9th. Fuck,
maybe it was 10th and 2nd?

432
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,247
This way.
It could have been 3rd...

433
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,480
It was definitely one
of those combinations.

434
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,613
I'm the asshole, right?
Everything's my fault?

435
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,123
Can we just concentrate
on finding the car?

436
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,750
No, Owen,
it's not about that.

437
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,021
I'm just saying
that we're not a match.

438
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,154
I mean, isn't it better we find
out now, rather than later?

439
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:48,720
No!

440
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,733
What do you mean,
not soul mates?

441
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,666
I love you. I want
to take care of you.

442
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,000
Just get...

443
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,199
Penny, let's go,
come on!

444
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,167
Owen?
Come on!

445
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,648
You okay?
Come on! Go for the car.

446
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,013
There it is!

447
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,390
Is this because
you pay my rent?

448
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,463
Because I had to swallow a lot
of pride to let you do that.

449
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,997
Get in the car, Owen.

450
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,292
I'm not leaving the city.

451
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,391
Well, it's my car.

452
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,437
Oh, that's right,
I don't have a car.

453
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,938
Throw that in my face
while you're at it.

454
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,132
They're right on top of us!

455
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,266
"They're right on top of us!"

456
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,276
Would you get out and help?
I'll do it!

457
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,107
No, no, no.
No, no, no. I'll do it.

458
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,168
Just...

459
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,772
Oh, God, there's a guy.
There's a guy right there!

460
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,840
Cut the wheel! Cut it!

461
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,013
What are you doing?
Cut the wheel!

462
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,816
I'm...
Cut the wheel!

463
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,879
Fire! Fire!
There's fire!

464
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:48,947
You're not
cutting at all!

465
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,459
Are you freaking blind?

466
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,551
God, here they come!

467
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,755
What is wrong with you?

468
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,423
Hey! Hey!
I know a guy with a plane.

469
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,731
If you drive me to where I need to
go, I can get you to your family.

470
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,066
Hello? Cut the wheel!

471
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,401
That's it. Now come
forward a little bit.

472
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,339
Ah, he'll be fine!

473
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,082
Hey!

474
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,676
So tell me
about this plane.

475
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,898
You know, hybrid cars
don't need as much gas.

476
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,963
Yes. They still need
a little gas, don't they?

477
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,738
No, I'm just saying, you don't
have to fill them up as much.

478
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,244
Does this mean we're not
going to the plane?

479
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,547
Look, maybe you should just
forget about the plane.

480
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,251
I left Owen in
the middle of a riot.

481
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,085
He used you as
a human shield, Penny.

482
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,216
You don't even know him.

483
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,185
Look, you're the one who woke me
up in the middle of the night

484
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,786
dragged me out of bed...
You're right.

485
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,924
I don't know why I bothered saving
your life, after you ruined mine.

486
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,934
What is that
supposed to mean?

487
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,367
What? What is that?

488
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,841
Well, you know how
sometimes the mailman

489
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,741
would put the mail
in the wrong box?

490
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,440
Well, sometimes, the girl
that you never got over

491
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,573
sends you a letter.

492
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,639
- That's from the girl?
-  My God.

493
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,879
Oh, my God!
That's great, right?

494
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,387
Yeah, it's pretty good.

495
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,981
What would be great is if l could
call her from a regular phone,

496
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,425
or I could just hop
on a train to wherever,

497
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,462
or not die in
the outer suburbs.

498
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,055
But instead,
I am on the scenic route

499
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,930
to the guillotine
with you, and you.

500
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,205
She could be at the
fucking pyramids by now.

501
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,003
She could have blown her head
off, and I wouldn't know,

502
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,067
because I didn't get this

503
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,703
three annoying months ago!

504
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,037
Oh.

505
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,880
Now I feel bad.

506
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,984
Fuck. Look,
guilt isn't a feeling

507
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,284
that I'm comfortable with.

508
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,658
Well, fortunately you won't
have long to live with it.

509
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,226
What are you doing?

510
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,793
Penny, this really
doesn't involve you.

511
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,100
I said I was gonna get you there,
I'm gonna get you there, so...

512
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,663
Where was the last place
you saw her?

513
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,334
Where was she
18 years ago?

514
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,008
Look, you don't need to spend
the last few days of your life

515
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,102
with a total stranger.

516
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,478
You're not a total stranger,
and these aren't my last days.

517
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,777
Oh, you're a survivalist.

518
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,716
No, I'm not a survivalist.
I'm an optimist.

519
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,619
Hello!
You having some trouble?

520
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,711
Do you know where the
nearest gas station is?

521
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,258
Yeah, but diesel is all they got left.
Where you headed?

522
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,387
Where we headed, Dodge?

523
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,791
Somerset.

524
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,194
Somerset. Wherever that is.

525
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,926
I think Huntsville
might be as far as I'm going.

526
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,028
Great! Thank you!

527
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,118
So,
what's your pilgrimage?

528
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,985
Because everybody's
headed somewhere.

529
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,924
Well, I'm going to see
my family, and he's...

530
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,455
He's looking for someone.

531
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,160
Who is it
you're looking for?

532
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,488
His high school
sweetheart.

533
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,124
Is that right?

534
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,667
Well, there's no
greater search

535
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,601
than that of lost love,
I'll give you that.

536
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,469
You married?
No, darling,

537
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,906
I never did walk the plank
There was a special lady.

538
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,177
My Rita passed
seven years back.

539
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,212
You know, it's all about
who you lay down with

540
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,341
when the lights go out.

541
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,045
Takes longer than it should
to figure that part.

542
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:42,182
Truth is, it's nice to have
some company for a change.

543
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,384
Even strangers.

544
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,757
Why don't you
tell us your life story?

545
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,422
Then we won't be
strangers anymore.

546
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,487
Yeah?

547
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:53,297
Well, sure. Let's see
I was born in...

548
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:58,767
Wait a minute. I should probably
tell Daddy's life story first,

549
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,774
so there's some context.
Okay.

550
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,137
Uptime?
Groovy!

551
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,911
Yeah. Daddy was born
in Skokie, Illinois.

552
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,778
And his dad was born in Okie.
Used to catch bass.

553
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,155
So they run
a bunch of tests

554
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,191
and they all come back
with the same bad news.

555
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,487
Doctors give me
six months to live.

556
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,995
Then I go home, turn on the
TV, and they say three weeks.

557
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,225
If you ask me, a man is not supposed
to know when his time is up,

558
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,960
it's not natural.

559
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,696
That's when you find yourself
renting a gun and buying a bullet.

560
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,570
But that ain't
no way into heaven.

561
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,534
Isn't that right, Dodge?

562
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:33,898
Hmm?

563
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,344
No, I guess not.

564
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,808
I'm gonna go
drain the snake.

565
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,214
You wanna join me?

566
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,743
No, thanks, I'm good.

567
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,028
Okay, what a fucking weirdo.

568
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,033
I think he's soulful.

569
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,627
Who drives around with shovels?
I don't trust him.

570
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,537
Glen? What?
He told us his life story.

571
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,974
Yes, and thank you
for that, by the way.

572
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,774
Do you know, if you actually
listened, you might learn something.

573
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,039
Sorry needs to go out.

574
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,708
I'll go. I will take him.

575
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,844
I'm gonna take him for a sniff.
Don't go anywhere.

576
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,690
I knew it
as soon as I saw you.

577
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:35,828
That detached look in your eyes.
That vague way about you.

578
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,737
You almost had me
fooled with that line

579
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:40,901
about your
high school girlfriend.

580
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:43,871
I'm sorry, I don't...

581
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,312
Don't be sorry, son.

582
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,143
Just kill me quickly.

583
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,552
What?

584
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,282
Well, l thought we could
do it in that nice field,

585
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,688
but if you're gonna shoot me in the
back, then let's get it over with.

586
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,784
Shoot you? I don't... Are we
still speaking metaphorically?

587
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:03,127
Well, what's it gonna be, then?
Knife? Piano wire?

588
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,189
Okay, you know what? She's
gonna be back any second.

589
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,293
Don't tell me they sent a
girl to do a man's job.

590
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,133
I specifically
requested a male!

591
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,505
Unless you're some sort of team!
Is that how this works?

592
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,839
Okay, you know what? I don't
think I am who you think I am.

593
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,715
Well, that's a relief.

594
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:29,223
Because I was afraid
I could fight you off!

595
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,221
You know, Dodge,
when a man...

596
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,596
Dodge? Glen?

597
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,068
Oh, my God.

598
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,108
Glen's dead.

599
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,580
Are you okay?
Did you get the plates?

600
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,180
"When a man..."

601
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,516
"When a man..." What do you
think he was trying to say?

602
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,320
I don't know, Penny.

603
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,985
"When a man..."

604
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,162
Loves a woman?

605
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,363
"When a man..."
ls a trucker?

606
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,264
The man...

607
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,633
The man committed
suicide via homicide

608
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,933
two weeks before
the apocalypse.

609
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,031
I'm not really concerned
with any Road Warrior wisdom

610
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,906
I may have
missed out on. Okay?

611
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,012
All right.

612
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,343
I'll drive.
Do you have the keys?

613
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,809
Oh...

614
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,254
Okay.

615
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,623
Okay.

616
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,894
You'd think a lifetime of
waiting for the worst to happen

617
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,959
would have
prepared me for this.

618
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,198
How could anyone
prepare for this?

619
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,775
I always knew. I always
knew it'd be over too soon.

620
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,279
I never saw myself
as an old man.

621
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,843
Really?

622
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:06,778
I thought I was gonna live forever.
Was totally gonna peak at 40.

623
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,294
Well, I hear 30
is the new 40.

624
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,898
Luckily, I'm getting my mid-life
crisis in just under the wire.

625
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,739
She must be really special,
huh? Olivia?

626
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,872
To want to find her
after so much time.

627
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,343
She was, yeah.

628
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,408
So why did you break up?

629
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:37,184
We were young. We were not
fully formed beings yet.

630
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,382
Life just took us
in different directions.

631
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,980
She dumped you?

632
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,859
Yes.

633
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,326
What about you?

634
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,794
What about me?

635
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,389
Who's the one that got away?

636
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,296
I am, thank God.

637
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,729
I don't mean I'm anything
special, l just...

638
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:59,036
I'm glad that part of my life's
over with, you know? Relationships.

639
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,443
I thought
you weren't cynical.

640
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,044
I'm not cynical. I'm...

641
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,205
I'm clinical.

642
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,845
I am a recovering
serial monogamist.

643
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,649
Sounds very serious.

644
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,982
Very serious.

645
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,715
I went to this
therapist who told me

646
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,689
that I had problems
being alone.

647
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,220
But then, I mean, she wanted
to see me five times a week,

648
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,193
so you tell me
who had the real problem.

649
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,795
You know, if the end of the
world has taught me anything

650
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,164
it's that I'm finally
getting my...

651
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,725
Oh, my God.

652
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,506
Is that a Friendsy's?

653
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,635
I would kill for a pint.

654
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:45,210
Hi, welcome to Friendsy's,
where everyone's your friend!

655
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,211
Hi!
Hi!

656
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,420
Two for dinner? Yeah!

657
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,586
Look at this little guy.

658
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,685
Is this okay?

659
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,526
Oh, yeah!
Everyone's welcome, yeah.

660
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,260
Dude brought in a wolf
last week. It's crazy!

661
00:40:58,322 --> 00:40:59,323
Come on in!

662
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,492
Okay.

663
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,163
Taquitos!

664
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,296
Yeah, three orders.

665
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,964
I can't believe
you guys are still open.

666
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,804
Yeah, we thought about
closing up shop,

667
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:10,539
but then we realized this is
really our family, you know?

668
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,946
In fact, the tragedy has brought us closer.
Some of us too close.

669
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,381
That's impossible.

670
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,385
And under new management,
it's a lot less corporate.

671
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,476
Right, Steven?

672
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,613
Right. I hope
a booth is okay.

673
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,680
Yeah, it's...

674
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,248
We burned all the
chairs in a bonfire.

675
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,021
I'm gonna pass you
off to Katie, okay?

676
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,997
You're in warm hands with her.
My skin feels great!

677
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,364
Thanks, Darcy.
Isn't he incredible?

678
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,061
Hi, I'm Katie.

679
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,432
Can you
slide over, please?

680
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,733
Yeah.

681
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,774
Can I touch your hair?
Yeah.

682
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,469
Oh, it's so soft.
Thank you.

683
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,445
Can I get you guys something
to wet your whistle?

684
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,674
Everything's awesome!

685
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,682
How are your mudslides?
Fucking awesome!

686
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,615
Can we get two mudslides?
Yes.

687
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,674
Thank you.

688
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,516
Do you guys wanna
know the specials?

689
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,283
Because these guys are
getting really creative.

690
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,347
No, just the mudslides.

691
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:02,931
Okay! Gotcha. Guys, I'm rolling
pretty hard right now,

692
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,024
but if you two
keep it super positive,

693
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,898
I will bring you
those M-slides.

694
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,938
And maybe an order of
spin-dip for the table.

695
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,407
That is amazing! And you know
what, it's his birthday today.

696
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,445
Why didn't you tell me that?
Happy birthday!

697
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,538
Thank you.

698
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,084
Wow.

699
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,551
I really hope you're
having a good time.

700
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,712
Yeah, I am having fun.

701
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:29,053
I think that this place
is some sort of cult

702
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,421
and we probably
shouldn't eat anything.

703
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,256
Oh, you're crazy.
This is amazing.

704
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,229
Look, people are sitting down
together, everybody's happy. Hey!

705
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,288
There's a conga line.
Just like...

706
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:41,063
This is a piece of American history.
It's a human landmark.

707
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,503
It's a shout-out to
the man upstairs to say... Oh!

708
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,732
I smell weed.
Excuse me! I smell weed.

709
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,778
Yeah, it's right this way Conga
your way to a great time!

710
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:04,958
Is it good?

711
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,527
This bun is a donut.

712
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,623
It's exactly what
you think a burger

713
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,101
with a donut bun
would taste like.

714
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:15,693
Mmm!

715
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,868
What did you do?

716
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:19,964
When?

717
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,408
You know, before,
like, as a living.

718
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,338
I sold insurance.

719
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,206
That's...

720
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,051
Oh.
Oh!

721
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,877
Oh, you're serious.
Yes, I am.

722
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,943
Oh.
Oh!

723
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:37,648
Okay. How does... How does
somebody get into that field?

724
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,161
You dare to dream, Penny.

725
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:42,197
I don't know, you...

726
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,063
I guess you start with all
of your childhood fantasies

727
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,000
of being a fireman

728
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,629
or an athlete or whatever.

729
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,503
And then eventually
reality hits,

730
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,271
and you realize that,
really, all you want

731
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:59,280
is to have a desk somewhere
with your name on it.

732
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,440
But why insurance?

733
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,574
I didn't like law,

734
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,347
and the economy was
headed in one direction.

735
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,012
I'm the type of person,
I just...

736
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,454
I feel more comfortable
with a safety net.

737
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,720
Whoops.
Mmm-hmm.

738
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,852
Yeah.

739
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:17,091
So, go on. How do you
know a man with a plane?

740
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,228
I don't know him.
I said I knew him.

741
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,463
I know, I know. I'm not getting
my hopes up. I'm just...

742
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,767
I'm just really excited.

743
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,169
Obviously.

744
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,472
...with
the Friendsy's family

745
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,843
It's your very
last birthday

746
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,381
Happy birthday!

747
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,408
There?! never be another

748
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,580
So tell all your
sisters and brothers

749
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,112
It's your very
last birthday

750
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,814
Happy birthday! Ooh!

751
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,652
Oh!

752
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,394
Okay...

753
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,326
That's... All right.

754
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,771
Hi, buddy.
Hi, there.

755
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,501
Can I join in?

756
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,338
Look, I don't
wanna be rude, but...

757
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,433
Oh, God!

758
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,001
Yeah, we should go.
We should go.

759
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,005
Okay. Sorry.

760
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,140
Here's some money.

761
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,145
Oh! All right.
Come on, let's go.

762
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,017
All right, see you soon!
Okay, have a good night.

763
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,591
Let's get these off.

764
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,407
They were...

765
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,440
Oh, God.

766
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:56,389
Dodge,
I want you to be my last.

767
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,802
That's a lot of pressure.

768
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,247
Listen, I...

769
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,451
Sorry, you go first.

770
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,892
I wasn't saying anything.

771
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,417
It's just...

772
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,589
I think I got a little
carried away before with

773
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,065
the mudslides and the orgy,

774
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:41,041
and, you know, obviously, things
are very complicated right now.

775
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,540
What are you doing?

776
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,011
I just want you
to know that I..

777
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,808
I wasn't trying
to take advantage.

778
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:53,344
Obviously, you're very young.
What are you, like 30? 31?

779
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,880
Twenty-eight.
Oh, God. Oh!

780
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,486
God, you try to be
a good person...

781
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,189
Relax, Dodge. It was...

782
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,790
It was end-of-the-world sex.
It was creature comfort.

783
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,233
Well... If anything,
it was my fault.

784
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,292
You didn't do anything.

785
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,564
I think I did some things.

786
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,907
It isn't gonna happen
again, I promise.

787
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,340
You've got Olivia,
I've got my family.

788
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,674
You know, we both have more
important places to be.

789
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,371
Just... A little sex.
It was bound to happen,

790
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,142
let's not make
a big deal out of it.

791
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:22,947
I dated someone
from Camden.

792
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,087
Listen, Penny, it...

793
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,085
I don't understand.

794
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,287
What is he doing?

795
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,589
I guess he's... Is he
trying to pull us over?

796
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,097
Oh, come on.
He can't be serious.

797
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,360
How fast are you going?

798
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,492
Who gives a shit?

799
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,557
Why aren't you
slowing down?

800
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:41,659
I think we can take him.

801
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,796
Oh. Hey! Hey! Hey!
Slow down!

802
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,636
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

803
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,175
Slow down! Pull the car over.
Come on.

804
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,006
Don't you think that he must
have better things to do?

805
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,204
Penny, pull the car over.

806
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,678
Jesus, what's he
gonna do, shoot us?

807
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,113
There's a very real possibility
he could shoot us, yes!

808
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,411
All right! All right!
Let's pull it over.

809
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,884
All right! God, but...

810
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,182
But I should warn you,
my dad's ex-military

811
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,781
and he says I have a really
serious problem with authority.

812
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,122
Put that away, please.
Give that. Mmm, mmm.

813
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,525
No, it's all
I've got left

814
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,187
and I'm trying to ration it.
Come on.

815
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:09,756
What do I do with it?

816
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,299
Oh, just...
Just put it in your mouth.

817
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,629
That was still lit.

818
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,811
Hello, Officer, what
seems to be the problem?

819
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,676
Well, for starters,

820
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,740
you're driving about 15 miles
an hour over the speed limit.

821
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,876
Really? Huh.

822
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,648
I thought I was making
better time than that.

823
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,115
And you know,
you got a tail light out.

824
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,853
No.
Yeah.

825
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,291
Also, your plates
expired about a month ago.

826
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,358
Goon.

827
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,535
Um, that's it.
That's everything.

828
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,265
Those three things.

829
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,932
Well, why don't you
write us out

830
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,499
any number of expensive,
time-sensitive tickets,

831
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,545
and we'll be on our way?

832
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,139
I need some identification.

833
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,945
Of course.
My name is Penny,

834
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,178
and this is Dodge.

835
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,242
Hi.

836
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,149
Okay.
License and registration.

837
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,690
Well, you see, that's where
we've got a problem,

838
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:13,250
because I didn't get a chance
to retrieve my identification

839
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,490
before fleeing my home
during a deadly riot.

840
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,463
However, we were
fortunate enough

841
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,592
to hitch a ride with
a very nice trucker,

842
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:23,001
who, turns out, had hired a hit
man to assist him in a suicide,

843
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,630
thus bestowing us with this...

844
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,333
This beautiful mode
of transportation.

845
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:31,812
So, the answer is no, no
license or registration here.

846
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:36,039
However, given the current
situation with the...

847
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,282
Couldn't you find it
in your heart

848
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,154
to set aside the law
just this once

849
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:46,217
and let us on our way so that
I can give my friend here

850
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,524
a fighting chance of being
with the one he loves

851
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:51,566
before we all reach
our untimely conclusion?

852
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,502
No.

853
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:04,978
All right.

854
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,342
Oh, excuse me,
do we get a phone call?

855
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,406
No, phones are dead.

856
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:10,474
Okay.

857
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,985
Have fun.

858
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:17,220
Oh! Hello?
What are you in for?

859
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,116
Disturbing the peace.

860
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,684
Brilliant.

861
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,659
Well, might as well
get comfortable.

862
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,393
This is as good
a place to die as any.

863
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,434
I ruined your life.

864
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,604
No, you didn't.

865
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,741
Oh, yes, I did.

866
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:38,002
I ruined my life,
and I took you down with me.

867
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:41,447
I was a terrible neighbor,
and I'm a...

868
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,812
I'm an awful daughter.

869
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,249
Hey. Hey.

870
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,546
Shh.

871
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,928
Look at him.

872
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,800
Sound asleep in his sandwich board.
You know why?

873
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,432
'Cause he always knew
the end was near.

874
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,940
And he's currently
not surprised.

875
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,038
You are looking at
a vindicated man.

876
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,944
How come you're not
with your family?

877
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,745
I don't really have any.

878
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,484
What do you mean?

879
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,624
My mother passed away,

880
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:32,127
and my father drove away
a long time ago.

881
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:37,033
My wife recently ran away, as
fast as any human woman could.

882
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,805
It only took Armageddon
to give her the courage.

883
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:43,071
Which is ironic, because

884
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:50,082
being afraid of dying alone is why
I got married in the first place.

885
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,253
Your roommate
was your wife.

886
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:56,756
My wife was my roommate.

887
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,827
Should have listened
to my mother.

888
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,988
Even after she got sick, she
always made the most sense.

889
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,057
You would have liked her.

890
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,933
She would have
liked you, too.

891
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,373
You think so?

892
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,135
She died alone.

893
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,107
Guess it doesn't
matter now.

894
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:23,041
How long since
you've seen your dad?

895
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,480
Um...

896
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,418
Twenty-five years?

897
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,980
Twenty-five years? Wow.

898
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,591
Well, don't you have
anything to say to him?

899
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,129
Nothing good.

900
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,293
Well, what about Olivia?

901
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,559
We were together
on and off for ten years.

902
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,072
She wanted to get married.
I didn't pull the trigger.

903
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,264
Somebody else did.

904
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,574
And then I met Linda, and
the rest is almost history.

905
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:55,173
What did she say,
Olivia, in her letter?

906
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,582
She said she and her husband
had gotten divorced,

907
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,588
and that she had a
6-year-old son named Marcus,

908
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,351
and she asked
about my parents,

909
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:04,816
and she said she missed me.

910
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:09,862
You know, garden-variety "end
of the world" mumbo jumbo.

911
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,225
I did ruin your life.

912
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,826
No, you didn't.

913
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,596
I had a really
long head start.

914
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,103
Oh, man,
I don't feel good.

915
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,274
Is that the weed
kicking in?

916
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,818
What does it feel like?

917
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,251
Feels like
I'm falling off a cliff

918
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,788
with a bomb
strapped to my chest.

919
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,289
Well, that could be anything.

920
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,353
Damn it, Wally!

921
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,063
There you go. Look who's here.
Look who's here.

922
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,361
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here.

923
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,595
There you go.

924
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,271
Well, sorry, folks,

925
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,831
but Wally's been taking the quota
pretty serious these days,

926
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,537
and I'm afraid that...

927
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,910
Well, your truck
was impounded.

928
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,946
Is there some place
I can drop you folks?

929
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,243
Uh, Delaware.

930
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,118
Yeah... No.

931
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,059
How far is it to Camden?

932
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,562
No matter
where the impact occurs,

933
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,894
it will create a firestorm
that will wipe out all life.

934
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,577
Thank you!

935
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,512
So how long
were you with this guy?

936
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,913
Total?

937
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,215
Nine months,
plus six more.

938
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,189
How do you know
he's going to be here?

939
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:18,958
He's always here.

940
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,570
There he is.

941
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,807
Penny.

942
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,141
Hey, Speck.

943
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:44,482
Oh, my goodness.

944
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,419
I knew
you'd come back.

945
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,390
No, I'm not back. I...

946
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:52,927
We were just
in the neighborhood.

947
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,528
I haven't seen
this girl in 12 months

948
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,860
and she's just
in the neighborhood.

949
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,228
Lance Corporal James Speck.

950
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,698
Speck, this is Dodge...

951
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,598
Lieutenant Colonel
Dodge Petersen.

952
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,535
Look, we're in
a bit of a pickle,

953
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,163
and I was hoping that
you could help us out.

954
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,943
Helping you out of a pickle
should be my middle name.

955
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,300
Na-hah!

956
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,647
Come on.
Bring your little amigo.

957
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,815
You have to leave
the dog up top.

958
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,718
Mom just vacuumed
the bomb shelter.

959
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,657
Come on,
I'll show you the digs.

960
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:25,619
Fellas.

961
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:26,887
Hey.

962
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,188
That's Entertainment.

963
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,167
Sports and Recreation.

964
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,098
And if nature calls...

965
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,561
Hey.

966
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,639
Wow.

967
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,801
As you can see,
we have enough rations

968
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,505
to live down here comfortably
for a good six months.

969
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,913
These walls are 12
inches of pure titanium.

970
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,509
Yeah, I was going to say 11.

971
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,884
Resurfacing
won't be that easy.

972
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,853
The world will need
a strong leader.

973
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,315
Is that a satellite phone?

974
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,418
It is. You want to
call your folks?

975
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,286
What?

976
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,958
Yeah, I was talking
to your dad the other day.

977
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:07,365
What time is it
across the pond, 1600?

978
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:08,961
I don't know.

979
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,349
Mum?

980
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:25,509
It's me.

981
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:28,249
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.
I'm fine. We got out.

982
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,490
Uh, me and a friend.

983
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,088
Yeah, he is.

984
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,368
Hi, Dad.

985
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,570
I miss you like crazy.

986
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:55,210
Tell me everything. How's the garden?
ls everyone there?

987
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,950
Is that Benny?
Yeah, yeah. Put him on.

988
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:07,592
Oh, you twat.

989
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,057
No. You're mental.

990
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,134
Oh, my God.

991
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,100
Oh, I hear the baby.

992
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,635
Is that my niece?

993
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,813
Yeah.

994
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,912
She sounds beautiful.

995
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,017
What did you name her?

996
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:48,399
You have a lot of guns
and a lot of potato chips.

997
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,806
Yeah, gotta be safe.

998
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,937
So how long
you known our Penny?

999
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,446
About a week.

1000
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,573
Give or take.

1001
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,243
So what's your pitch?

1002
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,547
My pitch?

1003
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,451
'Cause let me tell you
something about that girl.

1004
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,116
She may be a romantic
on the outside,

1005
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,591
but on the inside
she's all survivor.

1006
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:17,021
And she knows her
best chance of survival

1007
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,464
is sitting right here,
and I'm talking about me.

1008
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,929
Can we restart
civilization without her?

1009
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,437
Sure.

1010
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:28,165
But she deserves to be one of the
top quality females in contention.

1011
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,944
There's no room
for you, dude.

1012
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,781
That's okay.

1013
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,745
Got a pretty good lead
on a school desk.

1014
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,679
There she is.

1015
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,779
Uh, we should go.

1016
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,419
I thought
you were staying.

1017
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,794
I promised I'd take him
somewhere. Can we...

1018
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:50,296
Can we borrow one
from the fleet?

1019
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:58,002
Are you sure you don't want a
fallout tablet for the road?

1020
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,836
That's okay, thanks.

1021
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,878
The car's
a loan, Penny.

1022
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:08,244
I want to see it back
here with you in it.

1023
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:20,754
Thank you.

1024
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,187
For everything.

1025
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,227
I should have
married you.

1026
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,430
When?

1027
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,166
When you would've said yes.

1028
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:42,873
Dodgy-Dodge.

1029
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,584
Keep her out of trouble.

1030
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,693
You okay?

1031
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,224
They sounded good.

1032
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,702
They sounded really good.

1033
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,915
My dry cleaner.

1034
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,085
Meatball subs
at Zuzu's. Mmm.

1035
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,492
Mmm... Mmm-hmm.
Uh...

1036
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,762
Ducks pond
in the summertime.

1037
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,068
Mmm, riding the subway.

1038
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,162
Oh, you lost me there.
Nobody misses the subway.

1039
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,707
No, I did some of my best
people-watching on the subway.

1040
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,436
Huh.

1041
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,535
How about things that
we are not going to miss?

1042
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,240
Like going to the dentist.

1043
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,048
Oh! Dr. Hoberman.

1044
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,517
Oh, my God. Oh.

1045
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,487
Dr. Hoberman.

1046
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,691
That's it.
Wow.

1047
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,327
I cannot tell you how many
hours I spent out here

1048
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,057
obsessing
over that window.

1049
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,155
Which window?

1050
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,222
Right there.

1051
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,499
That's a good window.

1052
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,599
I don't think
anybody's home.

1053
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,206
Oh, come on,
we have to try.

1054
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,801
I'll be right here if you need me..

1055
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:17,694
Nobody's home.

1056
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:18,862
Try the knob.

1057
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,680
You know what,
she's definitely not here.

1058
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:33,209
Well, we've driven
all this way

1059
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,550
and it has definitely
not been in vain.

1060
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:39,388
You know what? l think
there's a hide-a-key.

1061
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,054
Okay, here we...

1062
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,424
Go.

1063
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,430
You are insane.

1064
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,165
Come on.

1065
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,086
Looks the same.
Smells the same.

1066
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,981
So what are we looking for?

1067
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,150
Something with
an address, I guess.

1068
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,163
Oh. my God!

1069
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:22,430
What? What?

1070
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:25,700
We have exactly the same
wallpaper in our kitchen!

1071
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,263
Don't do that, please.

1072
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,832
Isn't that wild?

1073
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:30,499
Aw!

1074
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,975
Oh! Wow.
Okay.

1075
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,615
Oh. Oh, I love this house.

1076
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,557
Wow. And I can make
something with this.

1077
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,792
I'll go check
the bedrooms.

1078
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,960
Yeah, we used to break into
people's houses when we were kids,

1079
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,401
me and my brothers.

1080
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,530
I mean, we wouldn't
steal anything.

1081
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:01,598
We'd just eat their ice
cream and watch cable.

1082
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,576
Then this one time, Benny,

1083
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,713
who must've been
about, like, seven,

1084
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,450
he took off
all his clothes

1085
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,116
and he got onto this old
man's exercise bike...

1086
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,716
Um, Penny?

1087
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:57,364
Oh, wow.
How long was I out?

1088
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,525
Couple of hours.
Think you needed it.

1089
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,026
Well, I've lost a third
of my life to sleep,

1090
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,469
what's another
couple of hours?

1091
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:05,631
Can you grab the wine?

1092
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:06,899
Yeah.

1093
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,972
Okay, so explain this to me.
Mmm-hmm.

1094
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,812
You picked the tomatoes,
you made the sauce.

1095
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,347
You went out and
harvested the wheat.

1096
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,445
Yes, I harvested the wheat.

1097
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,353
That was actually good.

1098
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,619
I don't know.
It was the best I could do,

1099
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:29,993
but just imagine a big juicy ham
instead of the canned beets.

1100
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,722
Mmm. Perfect.

1101
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:32,888
Aw.

1102
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:35,996
How could anyone
abandon this face?

1103
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:37,867
Look at that little face.

1104
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:41,397
Look, look, he's got
bits of gray in his beard.

1105
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,670
Highlights.

1106
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:48,178
What'd you do? Before.

1107
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:49,944
I think you could
say that I dabbled.

1108
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,112
How did you learn
to cook like this?

1109
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,175
Mmm.

1110
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,146
I watched everything my mum did
and did the exact opposite.

1111
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,355
My dad had
the real talent,

1112
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,326
and my mum was
sort of a cheerleader.

1113
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:06,396
You've never seen
two people more in love.

1114
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,625
I think that's the reason
I can never settle

1115
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,999
for anything
less than amazing.

1116
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,905
You know?
They made it look so easy.

1117
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,640
There's a reason that opposites
are supposed to attract.

1118
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,372
I'm the result of two
romantics getting together.

1119
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,007
I'm totally screwed.

1120
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:27,954
Mmm. I love this song.

1121
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:34,052
I can't believe I nearly
never heard it again.

1122
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,861
You know, this was the
first record lever got.

1123
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:40,059
I stole it from my dad's collection.
Pretended that he didn't know,

1124
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:42,466
and then I'd hear him
whistling it the whole time.

1125
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:44,402
Just to torture me.

1126
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,905
Is that how you
got into records?

1127
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,100
Yeah, he started it, but...

1128
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:53,777
I don't know, l just...
I love records.

1129
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:56,476
I mean, they're not
for everyone, you know?

1130
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,746
You really have to
take care of vinyl.

1131
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:01,755
It's very delicate,
it can get wrecked so easily.

1132
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,483
You really have to love it.

1133
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,360
Do you hear
how full it sounds?

1134
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:14,734
Now, what you want to buy is a thicker record.
They're more stable.

1135
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,293
The grooves in them are
sort of deeper and wider.

1136
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,736
You get more detail.

1137
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:22,298
I mean, they're harder to carry
around 'cause they're heavier,

1138
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,173
but they're worth it.

1139
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,312
You know,
my parents have this...

1140
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:31,818
It's an amazing turntable. It's
vintage, cherry wood Victor 45.

1141
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:35,117
Oh! Perfect tone.
All the original parts.

1142
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,887
I can't wait
to hear it again.

1143
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:48,194
So, what else are you going
to do when you go home?

1144
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,765
I'm going to...

1145
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:56,309
I'm going to listen
to my mum play piano.

1146
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:59,505
I'm gonna sit
in my dad's garden.

1147
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,878
He grows the most ridiculous sunflowers.
They're like 10 feet tall.

1148
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,879
I'm going to hang out
with my brothers.

1149
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,922
I'm gonna play with
my niece and my nephews.

1150
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:13,560
I'm gonna do all the things
I missed out on for so long.

1151
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,220
That sounds great.

1152
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:16,729
It is.

1153
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,566
I'm not gonna waste my time
on the wrong person.

1154
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,196
I'm not gonna
waste my parents' time

1155
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:28,242
introducing them to
some future stranger.

1156
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,877
And no more days spent picking
out what you're gonna wear

1157
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,777
for nights that
don't mean anything.

1158
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:37,247
No more wondering whether
you're with the right person,

1159
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:40,810
or if this is the guy that
you're meant to have kids with.

1160
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,890
All those
ridiculous questions.

1161
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,752
It's liberating. That's what it is.

1162
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,432
Maybe you just haven't
met the right guy.

1163
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:08,307
You're a really nice person.

1164
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,748
You are an awful
judge of character.

1165
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:33,565
I'm gonna fix that.

1166
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,109
Okay.

1167
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,984
What do you think
Sorry would like to do?

1168
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,783
I don't know.
Lay in the sun somewhere.

1169
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:50,118
We could look
for a Frisbee.

1170
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,988
Or I could set up
a squirrel hunt.

1171
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,253
Do you think he's horny?

1172
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:56,159
Oh, yes, I think he is
definitely girl-crazy.

1173
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:03,198
Maybe he wants
to find his owner.

1174
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,738
You know,
abandonment issues?

1175
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:09,272
You know what? Maybe
we're enough for him.

1176
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,834
I don't know,
he seems comfortable.

1177
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:20,612
What is it?

1178
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,619
It has a return address.

1179
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,897
Is it close?

1180
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,691
Yeah, it's pretty close.

1181
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,835
That's great.

1182
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:43,638
So, uh...

1183
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:45,144
We'll go
first thing tomorrow.

1184
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,645
Okay.

1185
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,615
Okay.

1186
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,353
Uh, should I, um...

1187
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,990
Should I disappear?

1188
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,052
No, stay here in the car.

1189
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,856
What happened?

1190
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:24,028
What's happening?

1191
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:28,505
Was she home?

1192
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,675
Yeah, I think so.

1193
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:35,946
Did you knock?
Why are we driving away?

1194
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:40,350
I wrote her a letter. I put it on her door.
She should get it soon.

1195
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:44,320
You wrote her a letter?
Well, what did it say?

1196
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,887
It just...
It doesn't matter.

1197
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:50,093
I don't understand. Why don't you
want to see her? What's happened?

1198
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,631
We really can't
talk about this, Penny.

1199
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:52,688
Why not?

1200
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,233
Because I don't want it
to change anything.

1201
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:55,461
Change what?

1202
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,168
You have somewhere
you need to be.

1203
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,206
And what about you?
What's changed?

1204
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:03,475
Dodge!

1205
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:17,344
You're not taking
this very seriously.

1206
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,408
No, it's very good.

1207
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,555
Wait. Keep practicing.

1208
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:30,795
Hey!

1209
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,475
Where are we?

1210
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,477
Come on.

1211
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:12,458
Who's there?

1212
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:17,269
Frank?

1213
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,941
Hi, Frank.

1214
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,340
Dodge.

1215
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:32,909
Is it a bad time?

1216
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:39,086
Why, no. No, of course not.
Come in. Please, come in.

1217
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,123
Thank you.

1218
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:48,196
Dodger!

1219
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:49,997
I can't believe it.
You're here,

1220
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:51,731
you're really here.
Who's your friend?

1221
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:53,696
This is Penny.

1222
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,139
Penny, this is Frank.
Hi.

1223
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:56,972
Hi. I'm his father.

1224
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:00,770
Oh! Oh, it's lovely
to meet you.

1225
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,315
You, too!

1226
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:06,516
Welcome. Well, you must
be hungry or something.

1227
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:09,078
Actually, I was hoping that I
could talk to you for a minute.

1228
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,624
Sure. Uh, go right
in there. Go ahead.

1229
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,750
Is there a restroom?

1230
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:15,226
Yeah, right at the top
of the stairs. Here.

1231
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:16,762
There you are.
Thank you.

1232
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:19,059
Top of the steps on your left.
There you go.

1233
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,725
What's the dog's name?
Sorry.

1234
01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:22,564
What?
Sorry?

1235
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:31,075
She your girlfriend?

1236
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,001
I don't know.

1237
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:34,436
She should be.

1238
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:43,349
Did we get old or what?

1239
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,957
So you're here to tell me
all the things I did wrong?

1240
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,697
No, you know all the
things you did wrong.

1241
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,200
I came here to
ask you something.

1242
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,263
I know I could have handled
things differently.

1243
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:00,135
I don't want
to talk about it.

1244
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,538
You know, your mother didn't
make it any easier...

1245
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,101
Don't. Don't say
another word about her.

1246
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,050
We were so young
when you were born...

1247
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:13,677
And now you're not,
and neither am I.

1248
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,752
And we had our whole
lives to figure it out.

1249
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,454
I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry.

1250
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:21,926
Well, just say it, then.

1251
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:25,863
I'm sorry.

1252
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:35,038
Now what?

1253
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:39,175
I don't know. You were the
one with the question.

1254
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:43,811
I guess l just
couldn't believe

1255
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,283
you didn't wanna see
your old man again.

1256
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:48,314
Your mother wouldn't
take my calls,

1257
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,289
she ripped up all my cards
and letters to you,

1258
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:52,825
but, you know, I figured
when you got older...

1259
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,293
Not that it was
on you, no, no.

1260
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,886
No, I did that.

1261
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:01,600
I know I lost all my
privileges when I left.

1262
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:09,637
You know,
when you were a baby,

1263
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,304
she used to hold you
so tight sometimes,

1264
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,847
l thought you
couldn't breathe.

1265
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:16,710
Um...

1266
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,477
Maybe that was just me.

1267
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,289
I really am sorry.

1268
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:32,128
It doesn't matter anymore.

1269
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,930
We're in the same place now.

1270
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,963
Well, I know l wasn't
there for you back then.

1271
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,205
It's not too late.

1272
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:17,803
May I propose a toast?

1273
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:18,936
Please.

1274
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:23,377
To the beginning
of the world.

1275
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,111
To the beginning
of the world.

1276
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:30,814
It's a good one, that.

1277
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:31,983
Such a good
cheap wine.

1278
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,177
You are the love of my life.

1279
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:09,032
Elsa, what are you
doing here?

1280
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,371
It is Thursday.

1281
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:17,312
Are you
shitting me, Elsa? Seriously?

1282
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:23,111
Go home. Just be with your
family, or do anything else.

1283
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,826
I'm serious.
You... Leave. Please.

1284
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,867
lt's just that...
You don't... It's not...

1285
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:41,735
I'm sorry.
I just... I'm not trying...

1286
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:45,610
Never mind.

1287
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:50,274
See you next week,
Mr. Dodge?

1288
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,310
Okay.

1289
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,375
Ah!

1290
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,950
Bye, Elsa.

1291
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,224
More Windose!

1292
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:06,430
More Windose.

1293
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,164
...once again,
CSA's latest report reveals

1294
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:14,696
Matilda will be arriving one
week ahead of schedule.

1295
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:18,209
The point of contact
is 16 hours, 26 minutes away,

1296
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:19,870
so be sure to
mark your calendars.

1297
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:21,540
Also, a friendly reminder

1298
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:24,550
to set your clocks ahead
for daylight savings time.

1299
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:26,882
Spring forward.
That's one hour ahead.

1300
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:31,449
On a personal note,
this is my final broadcast.

1301
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,654
Our final broadcast.

1302
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:37,161
On behalf of myself,
producer Bruce Hammond,

1303
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:38,891
and everyone here
at the network,

1304
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:40,899
we bid you all
a fond farewell.

1305
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:45,093
It has been my pleasure to bring you
the news for the past 27 years.

1306
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:49,564
Tonight, I'll be sitting across the
dinner table from my wife, Helen,

1307
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:52,976
and we'll be talking about
our sons, Henry and Paul.

1308
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:57,109
And we'll be saying our prayers
for each and every one of you.

1309
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:02,418
Good night, good luck,
and God bless.

1310
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,929
Hey, what is it?

1311
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:06,901
How could you let me go?

1312
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:11,944
I don't know.
It was so stupid.

1313
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:17,775
Iwoke up.

1314
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,020
I made him turn around.

1315
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:29,487
I don't want to
fall asleep, okay?

1316
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:32,628
Don't let me fall asleep.
Promise.

1317
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:33,961
I promise.

1318
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:38,227
What about
your parents?

1319
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:41,732
They're romantics,
they understand.

1320
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,534
Besides,
they've got each other.

1321
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:48,174
I just want to be with you.

1322
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:50,940
And I want to be with you.

1323
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:56,578
I couldn't live without you.
No matter how long.

1324
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:03,757
What do we do now?

1325
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:09,295
I just want to lay here with you.
Just want to talk to you.

1326
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:16,535
What are we gonna talk about?

1327
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:19,442
Where'd you grow up?

1328
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:22,974
Well, I was born in Surrey.

1329
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:24,141
I know.

1330
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,707
My whole family
are from there.

1331
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:26,774
Mmm.

1332
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:30,221
My mum was a journalist
before she married my dad.

1333
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:33,782
They never fought. Or at least
we never heard them fight.

1334
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:37,987
Charlie's the oldest,
then Benny, then me.

1335
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:41,427
We had a sister, but she
died when she was born.

1336
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:43,492
I still think about her.

1337
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,104
Oh, God!

1338
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:49,500
What was her name? What
was your sister's name?

1339
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:52,007
Um... Patricia.

1340
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:54,042
Patricia Hope Lockhart.

1341
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:56,479
That's beautiful.
That's a beautiful name.

1342
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:59,108
I wish I'd met you
a long time ago.

1343
01:33:00,207 --> 01:33:01,686
When we were kids.

1344
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:05,212
It couldn't have happened any other way.
It had to happen now.

1345
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:08,625
But it isn't enough time.

1346
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,826
It never would have been.

1347
01:33:14,822 --> 01:33:16,392
I'm scared.
I...

1348
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:19,632
Am madly in love
with you, Penny.

1349
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:22,934
You're my favorite,
favorite thing.

1350
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:27,803
I thought that somehow
we'd save each other.

1351
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:30,916
We did.

1352
01:33:33,574 --> 01:33:34,985
Penny...

1353
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:39,423
I'm really glad
I got to know you.
