which would put us
somewhere about here.

395
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,034

398
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,166
Well you see, the British...

399
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:26,146
they thought about building
a railway that would run

400
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,423
all the way from where we are here
in Thailand into Burma.

401
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,218
It would complete a line running
all the way from China to India.

402
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,971
If they'd managed it, it would have
taken it's place alongside

403
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,223
the great railway
journeys of the world.

404
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,018
Canadian Pacific.

405
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,853
Trans-Siberian.
The Orient Express.

406
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,146
Yeah?

407
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,814
Well why didn't they build it?

408
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,193
Well...

409
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,365
building a railway,

410
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,993
is a hard, miserable job.

411
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,456
It's usually done by poor
immigrant workers.

412
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,836
The great American railways
were built by Chinese peasants.

413
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,630
And even the British railways,

414
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,176
they were built by Irish
navvies fleeing from famine.

415
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,304
But sometimes,

416
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,808
a railway is simply too
difficult to build.

417
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,610
Well it's hundred of Miles
to Burma...

418
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,945
through mountains and jungle.

419
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,574
The British decided,

420
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,202
that to build such a railway,

421
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,996
it would be an act
not of engineering,

422
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,415
but of extreme barbarity...

423
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,709
and cruelty.

424
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,880
The conditions
would be such that...

425
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,840
those who did not die,

426
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,552
might well wish that they had.

427
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,892
To build such a railway you would need
more than just poor immigrants.

428
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,228
You'd need an army...

429
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,022

430
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,901
