1
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,150
Hey, Jacobi!

2
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,494
Fatso.

3
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,694
Hold it down, will you?

4
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,530
People are trying
to work up here.

5
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,778
Screw you!

6
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,924
No respect for the press.

7
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,016
You in or out?

8
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,356
I'm in. I'm in.

9
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,523
Ante up.

10
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,566
All right.

11
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,534
Why the hell don't we chip in
and get some new cards?

12
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,163
Don't look at me, I haven't won a hand
since Leopold and Lobe.

13
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,467
Jack bets.

14
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,007
A nickel.
Call.

15
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,874
Possible straight.
Possible flush.

16
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,447
Jack-eight,
pair of sevens.

17
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,575
Possible shit.

18
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,551
Pair of sevens
bet a nickel.

19
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,655
A nickel, a schtickel.
I raise you a dime.

20
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,283
Gaylord Schwartz,
Riverboat gambler, I raise you a dime.

21
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,486
It's a quarter to me, right?

22
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,493
I'll stick.

23
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,859
I'll call.

24
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,225
Why doesn't somebody
answer the phone?

25
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,062
It's the
<i>Examiner</i> phone.

26
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,064
Flush.

27
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,800
Criminal Courts, pressroom.

28
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,569
No, Hildy Johnson
isn't here.

29
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,666
Queen.

30
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,267
Oh, hello, Mr. Burns.

31
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,336
No, Hildy hasn't come in yet.

32
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,280
Sure thing, Mr. Burns,
I'll tell him the minute he shows up.

33
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,014
That's the third time
Walter Burns has called.

34
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,522
Where do you
suppose Hildy is?

35
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,615
Probably had a big night
at Madame Chow's.

36
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,160
I hear she's got some new broads in
from San Francisco.

37
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,958
I could go for a little
of that sweet and sour pork right now.

38
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,396
Come on, cut the gab.
Jacks bet.

39
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,559
I check to
the Chinese gourmet.

40
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,029
Two bits.

41
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,093
Call me a sucker.

42
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,139
<i>El foldo.</i>

43
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,504
This place smells
like the city dump.

44
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,634
How can you breathe
in here?

45
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,611
Hey, Bensinger,
any news on the hanging?

46
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,116
Did you talk
to the Sheriff?

47
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,585
Why don't you guys
get your own stories?

48
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,280
Who's been
using my towel?

49
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,025
And where is
my toilet paper?

50
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,525
How many times
have I told you--

51
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,891
Temper. Temper.

52
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,193
For Christ's sake, why don't you bring
your own toilet paper?

53
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,755
Or use those rags
you work for?

54
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,029
Two pair, jacks high.

55
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,070
Read them and weep,
three treys.

56
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,127
Beats me.

57
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,730
Here you are, Bensinger.

58
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,001
Hey, blushing pink.

59
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,064
Whoa, whoa.

60
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,508
I only used four sheets.

61
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,909
You better count 'em.

62
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,379
Bunch of goddamn gypsies.

63
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,950
This is Bensinger,
give me a rewrite man.

64
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,717
Take your time.
Take your time.

65
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,349
Oh, Marty, is that you?

66
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,790
"New lead
on the Earl Williams hanging."

67
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,093
Yes, the execution
is still set for 7:00 in the morning.

68
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,462
"The authorities
are prepared

69
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,967
for a general uprising
of radicals at that time."

70
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,267
Murphy here.
Get me rewrite.

71
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,499
"Extra guards have just been thrown
around the jail,

72
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,665
"the municipal building,

73
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,039
railroad terminals,
elevated stations."

74
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,438
Update on
the Williams hanging.

75
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,072
Sheriff Hartman's just put
200 more relatives on the payroll

76
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,979
to protect the city
against the Red Army,

77
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,143
which is leaving Moscow
in a couple of minutes.

78
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,311
Bet a dime.

79
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,023
Now, this is what the condemned man
ordered for his final meal:

80
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,321
Shrimp cocktail
with Thousand Island dressing,

81
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,054
rare roast beef,
Brussels sprouts,

82
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,720
apple pie a la mode,
Ovaltine.

83
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,457
"For his last meal
Williams is getting

84
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,967
a 95-cent blue plate special from
the greasy spoon across the street."

85
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:46,062
"At 9:00 tonight, Williams will be
examined by still another psychologist

86
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,731
"Dr. Max J. Eggelhofer,

87
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,004
at the request of the
Friends of American Liberty."

88
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,036
Eggelhofer.
Yes, he's from Vienna.

89
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,173
It's in my story
this morning.

90
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,650
He wrote that book
<i>Self Abuse and Antisocial Behavior.</i>

91
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,448
Poor bastard's gonna swing
in the morning

92
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,513
and this brain wants to ask if he played
with himself when he was five.

93
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,649
Pair of bullets.

94
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,623
More later.

95
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,785
Half a buck.

96
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,762
Wait a minute.
Don't I get a card?

97
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,888
Call.

98
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,497
Pressroom.

99
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,001
No, Mr. Burns,
Hildy hasn't shown yet.

100
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,332
No, we haven't heard a word--

101
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,272
That dumb
son-of-a-bitch bastard!

102
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,039
Who does he think he is?

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,976
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

104
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,014
Well, look,
if Hildy shows up,

105
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,314
will you be kind enough

106
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:38,346
to tell that dumb son-of-a-bitch bastard
to get his ass over here?

107
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:39,718
Thank you.

108
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,487
Any luck?

109
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,926
I've tried every speakeasy,
every gamblin' joint.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,264
I've tried the Turkish bath.
No Hildy.

111
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,701
Call
the Sanitation Department,

112
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,795
maybe they've picked
him up in some gutter.

113
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,602
I guess I better
check the hospitals or the morgue.

114
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:59,338
Be just like that clown
to die on me on the eve of a hanging.

115
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,308
How about those headlines?

116
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,421
Which one do you like?

117
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,122
They all stink.

118
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,227
Trouble is, there's not much
you can do with a hanging.

119
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,559
Now, if we had the electric chair
in this state,

120
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,693
that's something
you can really sink your teeth into.

121
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,036
"Williams gets the hot seat!"

122
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,637
"Williams Fries."

123
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,200
"Williams Roasted Alive."

124
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,443
# Step right up
Shake my hand #

125
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,485
# My baby told me
that she loves me #

126
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,144
Mr. Johnson,
I'm so glad.

127
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,849
Mr. Burns has been
looking for you all over.

128
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,489
# Congratulate me,
step right up #

129
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,722
# Shake my hand #

130
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:51,923
Hi, Hildy.

131
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,227
Is it a holiday
or something?

132
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,402
Hey, look at him.
Prince of Wales.

133
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,568
# Congratulate me
I'm in love ##

134
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,638
Where the hell
have you been?

135
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,374
Well, let's see.
I had a haircut,

136
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,382
I got a manicure,
I did a little shoppin'.

137
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,917
Hi, Duffy.
Yeah.

138
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,044
What the hell are you
dressed up for?

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,519
You're not covering
a polo match,

140
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,680
you're covering a hanging.

141
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,587
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

142
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,819
Tomorrow you and I
are gonna stand this town on its ear.

143
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,826
Oh, yeah.

144
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,762
Every damn paper is gonna have
the same damn story on that execution.

145
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,298
But we're going
to scoop them all.

146
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,924
Because you know
what goes in there?

147
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,435
A picture of Williams
swinging by the neck.

148
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,733
A picture?
A photograph, the first time anywhere.

149
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,034
Exclusive in the <i>Examiner.</i>

150
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,199
What are you
talkin' about?

151
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,573
That's against the law.
You can't bring a camera in there.

152
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,134
Who's gonna know?

153
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,671
Here, I had this
specially rigged up.

154
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,246
You clip it to your ankle,
you run the tube up your pants leg.

155
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,177
Make a hole in your pocket.

156
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,553
The minute Williams drops
through that trap door

157
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,650
you lift your pants leg
and squeeze the bulb. Clever?

158
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,194
You sure come up
with some doozies.

159
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,662
At 7:00, the guy kicks off,

160
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,824
at 7:03 you're out
of the jail yard,

161
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,424
there's an ambulance
waiting for you

162
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,299
with a darkroom
and a typewriter inside.

163
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,997
You take off
with the sirens going.

164
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,767
While you're
batting out the story,

165
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,240
they're developing
the negative.

166
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,743
At 7:22, the picture
gets to the engraver,

167
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,278
and we start
setting up your copy.

168
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,746
At 7:56,
we re-plate the front page.

169
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,544
At 8:12,
the presses start rolling

170
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,144
and at 8:47, you're out in the street
with an extra. How's that?

171
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,157
Walter, you'll either get the
Pulitzer Prize or a year in the clink.

172
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,022
You and me both,
we're in this together.

173
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,027
Now, what I want
is about 1,200 words.

174
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,323
You know,
lots of atmosphere.

175
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,556
With the cold, gray dawn,

176
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,361
and a voice from the death house singing
<i>Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,</i>

177
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,131
and the body twisting slowly,
slowly in the wind.

178
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,035
I don't have to tell you.
Anything else?

179
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,131
Yeah. We'll need
some last words from Williams

180
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,732
as he walks up
those 13 steps.

181
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,970
Something with a punch
to it.

182
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,511
If necessary
make 'em up yourself.

183
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,137
Last words?
You want some last words?

184
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,943
I'll give you
some last words. I quit.

185
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,574
A guy about to be hung? No.

186
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,675
He wouldn't say that.

187
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,980
Not Williams, me. I quit.

188
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:54,951
What?

189
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,682
I'm resigning.
Effective immediately.

190
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,189
It's the <i>Tribune,</i> right?

191
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,123
They've been trying
to steal you for years.

192
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,888
I won't work
for the <i>Tribune...</i>

193
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,986
Damn right.
Nobody walks out on Walter Burns.

194
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,623
...or any newspaper.
Walter, I'm getting married.

195
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,731
Getting married?
What the hell for?

196
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,995
You've already
been married.

197
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,264
Some marriage that was.
I never even got to Niagara Falls

198
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,102
'cause you made me get off the train
to cover the torch murder.

199
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,075
That's what makes you
a first-class reporter.

200
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,134
You're always in the right place
at the right time.

201
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,543
But never at home, Walter.

202
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,604
Not for Christmas,
not for our anniversary.

203
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,707
When she was sick
in the hospital and nearly died,

204
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,412
I was stuck in Tennessee
covering that goddamn Monkey Trial.

205
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,921
It's not gonna happen again, Walter.
Not this time.

206
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,513
Okay, Hildy.
You want to take

207
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,183
the plunge again,
all right.

208
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,283
Tell you what we do.

209
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,624
First you cover the hanging,
then you can get married.

210
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,958
Take the
whole weekend off.

211
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,692
Don't come into the office
till Monday.

212
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:40,994
Monday I'll be
in Philadelphia.

213
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,035
Philadelphia?
We're taking the midnight train,

214
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,467
tomorrow afternoon
we get married

215
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,505
with her family and everything
and everybody.

216
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,599
Monday I start working for her uncle
in the advertising business.

217
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,802
The advertising business?

218
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,243
You heard me. I'm goin' straight.
I'm quittin' this racket.

219
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,508
You mean you're going to be
writing crap like,

220
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,847
"I'd walk a mile for a Camel"
or "Quick, Henry, the Flit"?

221
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,546
You bet.
For $150 a week.

222
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,021
Jesus, Hildy.
You're a newspaperman,

223
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,183
not some faggot
writing poetry

224
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,284
about brassieres
and laxatives.

225
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,489
It's all set. We got 300 extra newsboys
for tomorrow morning.

226
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,089
St. Paul's Parochial School
is gonna be playin' hooky.

227
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,658
We'll cover Chicago
like a blizzard.

228
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,068
Goodbye, Duffy.
Watch the diabetes.

229
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,964
Walter, it's been fun.

230
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,333
What does he mean
by that?

231
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,808
He's leavin' us.
Gettin' married.

232
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,809
Yeah?

233
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,470
That hostess
at the Hotsy Totsy Club?

234
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,741
You're not even close.

235
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:29,975
This is
a very classy dame.

236
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,210
Philadelphia. Studied to be
a concert pianist.

237
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,584
Where the hell would you meet
a concert pianist?

238
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,720
Well, actually,
she's a widow.

239
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,655
Husband cracked up
in a brand-new Packard.

240
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,092
Only had 18 miles on it.
So, to support herself

241
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,062
she's playing the organ
at the Balaban & Katz Theatre.

242
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,155
The one in the Loop?

243
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,097
Yeah. We've been
dating three months.

244
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,828
Jeez, why didn't you
tell me?

245
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,893
I would've thrown you
a little farewell party.

246
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,802
Oh, no, no.
I know your farewell parties.

247
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,636
When Ben Hecht was
leaving for Hollywood,

248
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,266
you slipped a Mickey
in his gin fizz.

249
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,538
It took four of us to get him
on the California Limited.

250
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,410
Well, look at him now.
Sitting under those goddamn palm trees,

251
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,007
writing dialogue
for Rin Tin Tin.

252
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,045
What's the matter
with you guys?

253
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,986
You're traitors,
all of you.

254
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,923
If it isn't Hollywood,
it's Broadway or Paris.

255
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,619
Write the great
American novel.

256
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,821
Be Scott Fitzgerald. Christ!

257
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,924
And now,
you're gonna sell out.

258
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,865
The last real newspaperman
I got on this sheet.

259
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,232
Don't give me
that Vaseline, Jocko.

260
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,102
When you did that interview
with Earl Williams in the death house,

261
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,733
our circulation
went up 75,000.

262
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,902
It's been your story
right from the beginning.

263
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,036
You can't run out now.

264
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,101
Can't I? Watch me.

265
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,807
Because, hot or cold,
rain or shine,

266
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,180
I'm gonna be on the midnight train
to Philadelphia.

267
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,446
Okay, you ungrateful
son of a bitch.

268
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,215
I picked you up
when you were a nothing,

269
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,279
covering Polack weddings
on the South side.

270
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,654
I taught you
everything I knew.

271
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,387
And now when I need you,
you stab me in the back.

272
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,725
Well, I can take
the greenest cub out there

273
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,698
and turn him into
a better reporter than you ever were.

274
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,324
Fix him another Bromo.

275
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,404
Get out of here, you lousy,
double-crossing heel.

276
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,508
Well, as long as
there's no hard feelings.

277
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,784
You really gonna
let him go?

278
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,217
In a pig's eye.

279
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,416
Marrying some dame
that plays the organ

280
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,186
from Philadelphia,
for Christ's sake.

281

# Be careful

290
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,889
# Ooh, ooh, don't eat meats #

291
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,593
# Ooh, ooh, cut out sweets #

00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,728
# Ooh, ooh, you'll get a pain
and ruin your tum-tum #

00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,463

Yes?

304
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,387
Can I have a word
with you?

305
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,453
My name is Fishbein,
Otto Fishbein.

306
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,465
Oh, if you're a booking agent,
don't bother.

307
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,000
I am getting out
of show business.

308
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,467
Well, nothing like that.

309
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,231
I'm a probation officer.

310
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,437
Probation officer?

311
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,941
What's this all about?

312
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,374
Well, it's come
to our attention

313
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,708
that you're planning
to marry one Hildebrand Johnson

314
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,644
also known
as Hildy Johnson.

315
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:56,773
So?

316
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,645
Well, that's okay.
But we understand

317
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,515
you're planning
to move to Philadelphia.

318
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,076
Is there anything
wrong with that?

319
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,781
Plenty.
He can't leave Chicago.

320
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,346
He has to report
to us every week.

321
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,356
Why?

322
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,756
Because
he's on probation.

323
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:08,885
For what?

324
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,990
You mean
he didn't tell you?

325
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,496
Well, I can
hardly blame him.

326
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,964
What are you
talking about?

327
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,091
Now don't get panicky.

328
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,294
He's not really a criminal,
he's just sick.

329
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,302
Sick?

330
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,360
Well, not all the time.

331
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,963
But every so often
he gets this crazy urge.

332
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,938
Mr. Fishbein,
I'm not a naive young thing.

333
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,740
I've been married before.

334
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,871
Now, just what did
Hildy do?

335
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,307
As long as he was
doing it in dark alleys

336
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,284
and deserted parks, well,

337
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,320
we in the department
have some compassion.

338
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,948
But this last time,
it happened in broad daylight

339
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,855
in the
Chicago Art Institute.

340
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,826
For God's sake,
what happened?

341
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,796
Well, there were
those 16 high-school girls on a tour

342
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,060
and there he was at the top
of the staircase

343
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,329
wearing a raincoat,
and it wasn't even raining.

344
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,893
Is that
some sort of a crime?

345
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,201
You know what he was wearing underneath?
Shoes and socks.

346
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,467
And?
That's it.

347
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,840
We get those exhibitionists
all the time. "Hey, lady, look!"

348
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,540
I-- I don't believe it.

349
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,875
We got a file
on him this thick.

350
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:09,814
Poor Hildy.

351
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:10,878
Poor Hildy.

352
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,556
He'd be in jail
right now,

353
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,991
if it weren't for that editor of his,
that Walter something.

354
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,153
Walter Burns?

355
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,252
That's it.

356
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,163
Pulled a lot of strings
with the state's attorney and the judge.

357
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,029
That's what I call
a real friend.

358
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,601
That'll be Hildy.

359
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,669
What can I say
to him?

360
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,731
Save your breath.

361
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,277
He'll just deny
everything, anyway.

362
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,439
If I were you,I'd go back to
Philadelphia and forget all about him.

363
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,505
And not even say goodbye?

364
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,218
Hello?

365
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,276
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

366
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,119
This is your dream lover,
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

367
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,351
I just thought
I'd check in.

368
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,052
Boy, have I had
a busy afternoon.

369
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,457
Where were you?
At the Art Museum?

370
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,629
Art Museum?
What Art Museum?

371
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,689
I went to the office

372
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,793
and told Walter Burns
he could take his job and...

373
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,839
Then I picked up the rings,
the train tickets,

374
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,305
and I've almost
finished packin'.

375
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,502
Did you remember
to pack your raincoat?

376
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,737
Well, who packs a raincoat?

377
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,779
I'm gonna carry it
over my arm, just in case.

378
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,275
Just in case?

379
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,342
Oh, Hildy, You don't need
a wife, you need a doctor.

380
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,181
Look, I feel
very sorry for you,

381
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,847
but I just couldn't live
with that kind of a problem.

382
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,685
That's tellin' him.
Now, just hang up.

383
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,888
Uh, honey,
w-w-what's the matter?

384
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,894
I-- I don't understand you.
What have I done?

385
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,560
Your probation officer
is right here with me.

386
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,764
Probation officer?
I don't know any probation...

387
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,500
He said what?

388
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,130
Me? Oh, now wait a minute,
honey. Well...

389
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,138
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

390
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,700
What does this guy look like?

391
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,371
Never mind.
I'll describe him to you.

392
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,075
About 6'3", huge feet,
mean little eyes,

393
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,481
and a nose like a pickle.
Right?

394
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,246
You want to know who that is?

395
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,013
<i>Honey, you're not</i>
<i>gonna believe this.</i>

396
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,557
<i>Walter Burns,</i>
<i>that conniving son of a...</i>

397
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,823
Well, I better be
running along now.

398
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,829
I have a couple of
other cases to look into.

399
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:58,921
Uh, just a minute.

400
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,397
Hildy would like
to speak to you.

401
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,367
Not now.
I have to check up on the candy man.

402
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,667
We call him that
because he hangs around schoolyards.

403
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,761
Here.

404
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,645
Hello. Fishbein speaking.

405
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,312
Fishbein, huh? Listen,
you lousy baboon.

406
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,145
You better start
wearing cast-iron shorts

407
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,582
because the next time
I see you,

408
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,142
I'm gonna bury my shoe
up your ass.

409
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,378
Come on, Hildy.
You used to be able to take a joke

410
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,447
before you went into
the advertising business.

411
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,759
Of all of the lowdown,
stinking...

412
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,556
You'd wreck my marriage
just to keep me

413
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,856
on that crummy paper
of yours?

414
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:35,224
Hildy, all I'm asking
is that you postpone it for 24 hours.

415
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,825
Just cover this hanging
for me.

416
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,534
Mr. Burns, I wouldn't cover
the last supper for you

417
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,733
if they held it in the pump room
of the Ambassador East.

418
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,470
Now, you get the hell off the phone
and let me speak to my girl.

419
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,377
All right. All right.
The flasher wants to talk to you.

420
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,582
That was a rotten thing
to do.

421
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,208
It was for your own good,
believe me.

422
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,344
Marry an undertaker,
marry a blackjack dealer,

423
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,413
marry a pickpocket,
but never marry a newspaperman.

424
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,958
That's why
I'm making him quit.

425
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,890
You can't make a leopard
change its spots,

426
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,588
or hitch a fire horse
to a milk wagon.

427
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,095
He'll be like a fish
out of water.

428
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,155
We'll take our chances.
Now, if you don't mind.

429
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,031
Just a friendly warning.
That's my wedding present to you.

430
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,070
Darling, I'm sorry.
I should've known better,

431
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,935
but he just sounded
so convincing.

432
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,474
I finish my last show at 9:15.
Will you pick me up?

433
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,033
Tell Hildy I wish him
all the luck in the world and I mean it

434
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,306
or my name
isn't Otto Fishbein.

435
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:22,911
A dime.

436
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:23,971
Make it two bits.

437
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,073
I'm shy a quarter.

438
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,311
Too rich for me.

439
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,553
Can I clean up
in here?

440
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,554
Yes.

441
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,783
No!

442
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,123
Queen.

443
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,852
Ace.

444
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,898
Hey, listen.
I'm the big loser here.

445
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,432
Somebody must be winning.

446
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,728
Crack it for a dime.

447
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,127
By me.

448
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,094
I'm in.

449
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,901
A deuce, I can't read it.

450
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,962
Pair of fours.

451
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,668
Pair of kings,
bets a quarter.

452
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:51,869
Oh, I'm out.

453
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,070
Good evening.

454
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,237
That's your light.

455
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,302
Give me a card.

456
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,370
Excuse me, gentlemen.

457
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,417
Sorry to interrupt,
but which is the <i>Examiner</i> desk?

458
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,886
The what?

459
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,352
This is the pressroom,
isn't it?

460
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,513
So?

461
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,948
I'm Rudy Keppler.

462
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,025
I'm here to cover
the execution for the <i>Examiner.</i>

463
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,652
The <i>Examiner?</i>
How come?

464
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,787
What happened to Hildy?

465
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,627
Mr. Johnson is no longer
with the paper.

466
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,859
What do you mean?

467
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,596
He resigned.
Is this my place?

468
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,327
Resigned?

469
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,430
You're joking.

470
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,340
From what I heard, he's getting married
and moving to Philadelphia.

471
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,570
Come on, not Hildy.

472
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,441
I thought he was married
to Walter Burns.

473
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,810
He'll never
give him a divorce.

474
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,849
This place won't be the same
without Hildy.

475
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,247
Well, I would hope so.

476
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,344
I've always found him rowdy,
ill-mannered, and irresponsible.

477
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,718
But a hell of a reporter.

478
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,120
No contest.

479
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,756
That's why
I'm so nervous.

480
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,691
Following in his footsteps.

481
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,127
Being here
with all of you old pros.

482
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,994
Hey, I'll bet
you went to college.

483
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,590
School of Journalism?

484
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,725
How'd you guess?

485
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,066
University of Wisconsin,
Class of '27.

486
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,468
Oh, that was a good year.

487
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,734
We could sure use
some new blood around here.

488
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,105
That's for sure.

489
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,404
Hey, you play poker?

490
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,603
Cribbage is my game.

491
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,111
And a little auction bridge.

492
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,579
Don't worry.
We'll break you in.

493
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,173
That's very kind of you.
But right now,

494
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,510
is there any paper
around here?

495
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,214
Hey, Bensinger, why don't you give him
some of that pink stuff?

496
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,854
I think you're all being perfectly
beastly  to this nice young man.

497
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,859
I've been lookin'
for you bums.

498
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,264
Hello, sweetheart.

499
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,328
Well, if it isn't
Miss Mollie Malloy.

500
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,464
Nooky-nooky.

501
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,598
How's the
old tomato can?

502
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,871
Go on, laugh,
damn you.

503
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,345
Hey, Mollie, those were pretty roses
you sent Earl Williams.

504
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,439
What do you want
done with them when he checks out?

505
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,881
He left
a 7:00 a.m. call.

506
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,885
Bunch of wisenheimers,
ain't you?

507
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,443
Well, you know
what I think of you.

508
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,250
You gonna pay a call
on your boyfriend?

509
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,052
He's right across
the courtyard, Mollie.

510
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,116
I'm sure he'd rather
spend his last night with you

511
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,455
than with the chaplain.

512
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,519
If you was worth
breaking my fingernails on,

513
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,656
I'd tear your puss
wide open.

514
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,132
Would someone mind
introducing me to the lady?

515
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,659
Lady? Huh. Just get a whiff
of that perfume, Fleur de Floozy.

516
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,171
Bastards. All of you.

517
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,468
What are you
sore about, huh?

518
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,304
Wasn't that a swell write-up
we gave you?

519
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,367
I never said
I loved Earl Williams

520
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,504
and was willing to marry him
on the gallows.

521
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,569
You made that up.

522
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,673
Come on, you've been sucking
around that cuckoo

523
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,479
ever since he's been
in the death house.

524
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,144
Everybody knows
you're his soul mate.

525
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,448
That's a lot of bunk.

526
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,422
Like all that other stuff
you been writin'.

527
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,185
Calling me an Angel
of the Pavement,

528
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,920
a Midnight Madonna.
Who're you kidding?

529
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,758
I'm a $2 whore from Division Street,
and you know it.

530
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,821
That's right.
She shouldn't be allowed in here.

531
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,924
And that love nest
you had with Williams?

532
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,401
That's a lie. He never even
laid a hand on me.

533
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,030
You had that red in your bed
for three days and nights.

534
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,334
Did he have
that kind of money?

535
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,272
Or did you make him
a special price?

536
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,834
The poor guy
didn't have enough for a cup of coffee.

537
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,539
He used to hang
around Division Street

538
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,376
every night,
handin' out leaflets.

539
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,178
Tellin' us how
we were being exploited

540
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,810
by capitalism
and that we should organize.

541
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,314
So the pimps came around
and beat him up.

542
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,017
And there he was,
lyin' on the sidewalk, bleedin'.

543
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,787
With his glasses broken.

544
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:58,322
So I took him up to my place,
like any human being would.

545
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,431
That was a very
charitable thing to do.

546
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,160
Yeah. Meet
Florence Nightingale.

547
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,567
Sure, I took care of him.
And for three days and three nights

548
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,195
he just talked to me.

549
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,604
Treated me decent.
Not like an animal.

550
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,809
Now, you guys are trying
to make a fool out of me.

551
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,106
Why didn't you adopt him

552
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,306
instead of letting him
run around shooting policemen?

553
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,612
I told him to stay away
from that corner.

554
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,675
When they sent a cop
to chase him away,

555
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,221
he said it was
his constitutional right.

556
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,184
So the cop pulled a gun on him
and he panicked.

557
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,616
He just grabbed for the gun
and it went off.

558
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,854
He didn't mean to kill him.

559
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,486
Aw, put it
on a Victrola record.

560
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,622
Suppose that cop
had been your own brother?

561
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:37,328
I wish to God it had been one of you,
you lousy punks.

562
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:40,663
What's that?

563
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,967
Just testing.

564
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,468
Testing what?

565
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,942
They're fixing up
a pain in the neck for your boyfriend.

566
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,353
Maybe we ought to put
a little talcum on the noose,

567
00:25:58,424 --> 00:25:59,982
make it slide easier.

568
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,621
Oh, my God!

569
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,266
You gonna
claim the body, Mollie?

570
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,427
Or scatter his ashes
over Division Street?

571
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,494
I suppose all the hookers
will go into mourning.

572
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,437
Yeah,
wear black underwear.

573
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,434
Shame on you. Shame.

574
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,639
A poor little crazy fellow's
sitting there alone

575
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,305
with the
Angel of Death beside him

576
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,009
and you crackin' jokes.

577
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,545
It's a wonder a bolt
of lightning don't come

578
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,849
through the ceiling
and strike you all dead.

579
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,793
That's enough of that.
Just go cry somewhere else.

580
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,693
Yeah, Mollie,
get your keister out of here.

581
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:39,788
This is the pressroom.

582
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:40,923
I'm $4 behind.

583
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,523
Come on, let's go.
Let go of me.

584
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,693
Shut up! Come on.

585
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,566
Hey, lady,
I'm on your side.

586
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,038
You liars.

587
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,095
Beat it, you tramp.

588
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,401
You hoodlums.

589
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,938
Gentlemen of the press?

590
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,108
Hey, Mollie, what do you know?
What do you say?

591
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,153
Oh, get lost.
You're like all the rest of them bums.

592
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,984
# Is that a break now
Am I awake now? #

593
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,820
# or am I dreaming? ##

594
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,400
Jennie, old girl, did anybody ever tell
you you've got a terrific behind?

595
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,458
Not lately.

596
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,334
Well, a thing of beauty
is a joy forever.

597
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,669
Cut the blarney,
Mr. Johnson. What do you want now?

598
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,232
I could use some ice,
some club soda,

599
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,039
maybe a couple of bottles
of ginger ale.

600
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,545
Coming up.
Right.

601
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,878
King, seven, five,
three, seven,

602
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,814
nine, six, five,
and a 10. Bet the king.

603
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:35,319
All right, you guys,
on your feet and reach for the ceiling.

604
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,411
This joint's raided, see?

605
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,455
Hey, Hildy.

606
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,423
What's all this we hear?
Is it on the level?

607
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,516
You really quitting?
Get a load of that outfit.

608
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,458
What the well-dressed
bridegroom will wear.

609
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:46,498
Nobody moves to Philadelphia for
Christ's sake! Say it isn't so, Hildy.

610
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,589
It's all true, fellows.

611
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,692
Two tickets to Philly,
and two wedding hoops. 18 carats.

612
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,067
You're looking at
Hildebrand Johnson, Esq.,

613
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,298
care of Waterbury and Adams,

614
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,705
Advertising and
Public Relations, Philadelphia, PA.

615
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,799
No shit.

616
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,707
Nobody but fairies
goes into advertising.

617
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,745
Sour grapes.

618
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,302
How did Burns
take the news?

619
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,405
That conniving son...

620
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,541
You know what he tried...
Ah, the hell with it.

621
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,675
Get some paper cups.

622
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:09,084
Hey, look at the hooch.
It's the real stuff.

623
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,587
Just my farewell
to the troops.

624
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,715
Hildy, baby, when you go,
you go first class.

625
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,851
It's worth it. I'll never have to look
at your ugly mugs again.

626
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,828
Let's get rid of
some of this crap.

627
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,488
Yeah. It's about time.

628
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,964
Mr. Johnson?
Huh?

629
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,500
You probably
don't remember me,

630
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,661
but we once met
in the men's room.

631
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,896
The men's room? Where?

632
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,063
At the <i>Examiner.</i>

633
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,972
I'm Rudy Keppler,
Mr. Duffy sent me to take over for you.

634
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,169
Is that so?
And what were you doing before this?

635
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,212
Oh, a little bit of everything.
Social notes,

636
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,213
book reviews,
covered a couple of fires.

637
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,078
But this is
my first hanging.

638
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,515
Yeah. It's okay, kid.

639
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,883
It's Williams'
first hanging, too.

640
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,589
I snitched the ice
from the morgue.

641
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,215
Over here.

642
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,953
What will you have,
Jennie?

643
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,654
Uh, maybe
a little straight gin.

644
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,321
Careful.
You're getting the cards wet.

645
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,024
It's about time
somebody washed them.

646
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,361
I could go for
some ginger ale.

647
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,163
Hey, slick,
join us.

648
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,533
Rock & Rye, please.

649
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,128
Here you are, kid.

650
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,402
Well, Hildy,
here's to you.

651
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,669
You lucky bastard.

652
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,732
Godspeed, Hildy.

653
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,836
And may the wind at your back
never be your own.

654
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,146
All right. Ahem.

655
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,476
You sentimental slobs, before
everybody gets falling down drunk,

656
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,953
I got a few markers here.

657
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,250
McHugh, you owe me $5.

658
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,449
I'll give it to you
tomorrow.

659
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,321
I won't be here.
I'll send it to you.

660
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,826
I'll bet it gets lost
in the mail.

661
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:23,861
No bet.

662
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,328
Schwartz, $6.75.
For what?

663
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,422
For being a lousy poker player.
That's for what's.

664
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,797
Hildy, about that $30.
You'll have to wait,

665
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,268
it wasn't just my kid taking sick,
my old lady isn't--

666
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,736
What $30?
Forget it.

667
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,467
I might've known I couldn't collect
from you deadbeats, anyway.

668
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,838
Big time Charlie, huh?

669
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,035
How much
they payin' you?

670
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,408
Oh, you wouldn't
want to know.

671
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,946
It'd just make you
green with envy.

672
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,675
Are you gonna have
one of those offices

673
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:46,013
with a rug on the floor,
and the stenographer on your lap?

674
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,346
Oh, my wife
won't go for that.

675
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,080
Bet you get Saturdays
and Sundays off.

676
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,348
And Christmas.

677
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,947
You're gonna join the Country Club,
golf and Mah Jongg,

678
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,653
silk pajamas with a monogram
right across your chest...

679
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,423
Hold it.
Now, look who's talking. Journalists.

680
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,522
Bunch of crazy buttinskies
with dandruff

681
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,567
on their shoulders
and holes in their pants.

682
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,569
Peeking through keyholes, waking people
up in the middle of the night

683
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,504
to ask them what they think
about Aimee Semple McPherson.

684
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,532
Stealing pictures
off old ladies

685
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,770
of their daughters
that get raped in Oak Park.

686
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,744
And for what?
So a million shop girls

687
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,373
and motormen's wives
can get their jollies.

688
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,916
And the next day,
somebody wraps

689
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,975
the front page
around a dead mackerel.

690
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,350
Don't knock it, Hildy.

691
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,821
How long do you think
you'll last on that fancy job?

692
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,450
Yeah, six months from now
you may be out on your ass.

693
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,393
Never happen. You know why?
Because, my girl's uncle,

694
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,556
he owns that advertising agency.
Now, tie that.

695
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:34,758
What do you know?

696
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,926
Our Hildy going into
the nephew business.

697
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:37,900
A gigolo.

698
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,834
Where's your pride,
your integrity?

699
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:42,100
What's the newspaper business
ever done for me?

700
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,199
See, I don't want to end up
like you guys will,

701
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,766
on a copy desk.

702
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,741
Gray-haired, humpbacked,
half blind,

703
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:50,008
bummin' cigarettes
from office boys.

704
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,842
I think I'll have
a little more gin.

705
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,221
Uh, what's the idea,
fellas?

706
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,692
You know better than that.
This is a government building.

707
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:03,750
Ah, hi, Sheriff.

708
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,853
What'll you have?

709
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,455
I've got a good mind
to have you all locked up.

710
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,090
The state's attorney
wouldn't like it

711
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,192
because I bought that stuff
from his brother.

712
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,535
If you gentlemen
need more ice...

713
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,333
Here are your tickets
for the hanging.

714
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,968
<i>Tribune.</i>
<i>Journal of Commerce.</i>

715
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:20,645
<i>Post.</i>

716
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,644
Only two?

717
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,238
I promised a couple of the guys
in the Circulation Department.

718
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:27,217
What do you think we're putting on here,
the World Series?

719
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,083
<i>Daily News. Examiner.</i>

720
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,716
Here you are, Rudy.
The new man.

721
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,950
Oh, what happened?
They finally fire you?

722
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,359
I'm retiring to my country estate
outside Philadelphia.

723
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,557
Well, in that case
I will have a drink.

724
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,065
No, you won't.
Not my liquor.

725
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,930
What should I do
with the second ticket?

726
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,834
Sell it to a scalper
like the Sheriff does.

727
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,769
I've had it
with you, Johnson.

728
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,206
When I think of
all that malarkey

729
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,073
you and Walter Burns
printed about me,

730
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:56,410
full of hearsay, innuendo,
and character assassination--

731
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,142
What do you mean?
Don't we always refer

732
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,547
to you as
"Honest" Pete Hartman?

733
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:03,486
Oh, yeah. And what about those things
you always put around "Honest"?

734
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,013
<i>Journal.</i>

735
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,354
Why can't you move
the hanging from 7:00 to 5:00

736
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,018
so we can make
the city edition?

737
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,585
Oh, come on, Murph.
You can't hang a fella in his sleep

738
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,062
just to please
the newspapers.

739
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,393
It ain't nice.
No.

740
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,763
But you can
reprieve him twice,

741
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,632
so that the hanging comes
just before the election. Huh?

742
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,001
With you and the Mayor running
on a law and order ticket.

743
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,164
That is nice.

744
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,708
I had nothin' to do with it.
That was the Governor.

745
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,437
What if there's
another reprieve?

746
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,535
No chance.

747
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,775
Suppose this Dr. Eggelhofer
finds out Williams is insane?

748
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,511
Come on, boys, you know
that's just a formality

749
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,883
to shut up those
pinko troublemakers.

750
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,320
He's gonna examine him
in my office in a few minutes.

751
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,019
But I can tell you right now,
Williams is as sane as I am.

752
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,151
Saner.

753
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,889
Oh, c-come on, fellas.

754
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:49,332
He shot that cop as part
of a Bolshevik-anarchist conspiracy

755
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,699
to subvert our
democratic institution.

756
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,203
Baloney.

757
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,901
Williams isn't a Red
and you know it.

758
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,874
He's just a screwball
who had the lousy luck

759
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,468
to shoot a colored cop
in an election year.

760
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,810
Now I want you fellas
to tell it loud and clear

761
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,850
that the death warrant
for Earl Williams

762
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,045
is a death warrant for
all the radical elements in this town.

763
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,109
Not again, Pete.

764
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,850
I say reform the Reds
with a rope.

765
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,892
Can I quote you
on that, Sheriff?

766
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,188
Certainly, my boy.

767
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:19,492
Sheriff Hartman
pledges to reform the Reds with a rope.

768
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,657
That's worth
a good 600,000 votes.

769
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,496
Plus a couple of 100,000
colored votes,

770
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,230
so when that baby drops through the trap,
you guys are a shoo-in.

771
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,397
Are you implying
that the Mayor and I

772
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,100
are playing politics
with a man's life?

773
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,837
Oh, am I glad to get out
of this friggin' town.

774
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:36,244
That cuts both ways, Johnson.
Both ways.

775
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,676
<i>American. City Press.</i>

776
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,576
See you around, fellas.

777
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:46,146
Goodbye, Sheriff.
Gonna miss you. "Honest."

778
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,788
Well, chums,
I got to pick up my girl.

779
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,852
We're gonna have dinner
before we get on that train.

780
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,761
Let's have one
for the road.

781
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,757
Mr. Johnson.

782
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,992
If you have any advice
to give me...

783
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,499
Sure, kid.

784
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,597
Never end a sentence
with a preposition,

785
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,665
never draw
to an inside straight,

786
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,904
and never, never get caught
in the can with Bensinger.

787
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:10,737
So long, Hildy.

788
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:11,804
Take care of yourself.

789
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,680
Drop us a postcard,
you stewbum.

790
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,242
Any of you ever
get to Philadelphia,

791
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,787
for Christ's sake,
don't look me up

792
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,085
because from now on
I'm not associating with riffraff.

793
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,283
Cheers!

794
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,826
# Not a soul down
on the corner #

795
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,658
# That's a pretty
certain sign #

796
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,163
# That wedding bells
are breaking up #

797
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:33,261
# That old gang of mine #

798
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,966
# All the boys are
singing love songs #

799
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:41,803
# They forgot sweet Adeline #

800
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:45,676
# Those wedding bells
are breaking up #

801
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:50,383
# That old gang of mine ##

802
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,867
Could you help
me again, please?

803
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,174
I just can't seem
to shake this cold.

804
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,710
Yeah, summer colds.
They're the worst.

805
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,920
All right,
unlock the handcuffs.

806
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,085
Was your dinner okay?

807
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,150
It was fine,
but they forgot the ketchup.

808
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,423
That's just too bad.
In here.

809
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,628
Earl, this is Dr. Eggelhofer.

810
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,965
He's going to examine you.

811
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,471
Oh, oh, hi, Doc.

812
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,903
Good evening, sir.
Sit down, please.

813
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,548
You gonna stick
some pins into me

814
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,106
and hit my knees
with a hammer?

815
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,651
That is very old-fashioned.

816
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,653
I'm merely going to
ask you a few questions.

817
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,745
Oh, thank you.

818
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,483
Now, Mr. Williams,
are you aware

819
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,422
of what's going to happen
to you tomorrow?

820
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,517
They're gonna hang me.

821
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,027
And how do you
feel about that?

822
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,392
Well, to tell the truth,

823
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,523
I'll be glad to get out of that cell.
It's so drafty.

824
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,828
See? I told you.
He's 100 percent sane.

825
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,202
It says here that you are,
by profession, a baker.

826
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,867
That's right.
I'm-- I'm a specialty baker.

827
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,740
You know, uh, pretzels
and breadsticks and bagels.

828
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,144
You know, I worked
for the same place for five years,

829
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,875
and then one day
they just fired me.

830
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,938
What was the reason?

831
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,008
'Cause I put those things
in the fortune cookies.

832
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,018
What things?

833
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:30,748
Free Sacco and Vanzetti.

834
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,414
Pretty sneaky,
those Bolsheviks.

835
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,514
Who's a Bolshevik?

836
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,990
According to this,

837
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,891
you were arrested
in 1925

838
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,895
for illegal possession
of explosives.

839
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,521
Oh, yes. Well,
I don't know

840
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,862
how you feel
about Wall Street, Doctor,

841
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,698
but I mailed this shoebox
to JPMorgan

842
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,101
with a time bomb in it.

843
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:51,006
And it came back because of
insufficient postage.

844
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:53,772
Blew the whole roof
off my boarding house.

845
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,006
We should send them all back
where they came from.

846
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,277
I come from Fargo,
North Dakota.

847
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:05,452
Tell me, Mr. Williams,
were you unhappy as a child?

848
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,547
Not really.

849
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,615
I had a perfectly
normal childhood.

850
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,558
I see. You wanted
to kill your father

851
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,255
and sleep with your mother.

852
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,987
If he's gonna
talk dirty--

853
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,862
When you were
in grammar school,

854
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,027
did you
practice self-abuse?

855
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,798
No, sir.
I don't believe in it.

856
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,567
I would never abuse
myself or anybody else.

857
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,074
I love people,
I love all people.

858
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,611
I suppose that cop
committed suicide.

859
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,042
Let us get back
to masturbation.

860
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,983
Did your father ever
catch you in the act?

861
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,250
Oh, my father
was-- was never home.

862
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:39,085
He was a conductor
on the Chicago-Northwestern.

863
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,355
Very significant.

864
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,156
Your father wore a uniform
just like that policeman.

865
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,856
And when he
pulled out the gun,

866
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,329
an obvious phallic symbol,

867
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,797
you thought
he was your father

868
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,631
and was going to use it
to hurt your mother.

869
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,667
He's crazy.

870
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,605
Let us then try
to reconstruct your thought process

871
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,574
at the time
of the crime.

872
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,044
May I borrow
your gun, please?

873
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,773
Oh, sure thing.

874
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,812
Get up, Mr. Williams.

875
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,318
All right, you are standing
on that corner with those leaflets,

876
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,651
I am the policeman. I come up to you
and tell you to move along.

877
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,191
You refuse,
I draw my gun.

878
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:18,923
Now, I want you to tell me exactly
what you thought

879
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,361
and show me exactly
what you did.

880
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,297
Exactly?

881
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:30,266
# Gee, I get
that lonesome feeling #

882
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,902
# When I hear
those church bells chime #

883
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,004
# Those wedding bells
are breaking up ##

884
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,214
What the hell is that?

885
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,344
Maybe somebody else
is throwing a party.

886
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,851
Must be a riot
or a jailbreak.

887
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:53,858
Hey, Jacobi,
what's the matter?

888
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,524
What's going on
down there?

889
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,624
Somebody get away?

890
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,690
Who was it?

891
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,794
Hey fatso,
what happened?

892
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:03,307
Go screw! All right,
spread out, you guys.

893
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,841
Watch the gate.

894
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,376
Somebody cover
the west wall.

895
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,503
And the rest of you,
follow me.

896
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,839
Get away
from those windows.

897
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:12,940
What's the excitement?

898
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,609
Earl Williams escaped.

899
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,585
Williams?

900
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,746
Jesus!

901
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,785
Earl Williams just busted out
of the County jail.

902
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,626
Got clean away.
Cops all over the place.

903
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,756
Lots of shooting.

904
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,801
Don't know if it's
from Williams or at Williams.

905
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,267
No, I don't know
how it happened.

906
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,735
Careful, you roughnecks.

907
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,036
Watch where you're shooting.

908
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,508
Stand by.
Call you later.

909
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,442
You bet.
The minute I get anything.

910
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,410
Hang on.

911
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,538
I'm off and running.

912
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,289
Hey, Keppler.

913
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,793
Sir?

914
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,201
Aren't you gonna call
into the office?

915
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:08,896
You think it's safe?

916
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,032
Those guys
couldn't hit anything.

917
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,468
I'm afraid
I did something bad.

918
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,139
When the shooting started.
In my pants.

919
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,084
I hope the negative
didn't get wet.

920
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,448
Uh, Rudy, the phone.

921
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,548
Oh, yes.

922
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,687
What's our number?

923
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,195
You've got
a direct line there.

924
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,389
Really?

925
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,088
Hello?

926
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,095
Hello, Mr. Duffy.
This is Keppler.

927
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,329
Rudy Keppler.

928
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,670
Yes, I'm in
the Criminal Courts building,

929
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,972
but it looks like there's going to be
no hanging tomorrow.

930
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,942
No. No reprieve from the Governor
as far as I know.

931
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,107
I can't hear you, Mr. Duffy,
with all the shooting and the sirens.

932
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,413
Oh, shit!

933
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,020
Duffy, it's Hildy Johnson.
Get me Walter, quick.

934
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,291
Switch that call in here,
will you? It's Hildy.

935
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:10,527
What'd I tell you?

936
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,592
I knew the minute
he saw we were replacing him

937
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,037
with that snot-nosed kid,
it would be such a blow to his ego...

938
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,973
Look, Hildy, if you want your job back,
it's too late.

939
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,273
I got a first-class guy
coverin' that story.

940
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:23,337
Yeah, just met him.
Full of piss and vinegar.

941
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,472
Now get this, Walter.

942
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,210
Earl Williams just
lammed out of jail.

943
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,512
That's right.
You heard me.

944
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,577
Holy smoke! Hold everything in
the composing room.

945
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,855
Well, thanks
for the call, Hildy.

946
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,154
I know you're in a hurry
to catch that train.

947
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,130
Christ, when I think what
you could have done with this story.

948
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,997
Don't worry, Walter.
I'm right on top of it.

949
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,300
Anything I can do
for you, Mr. Johnson?

950
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,398
Yeah. Change your diapers.

951
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:52,939
What happened?

952
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,036
How did he get out
of your rubber jail?

953
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,842
Any clue
to his whereabouts?

954
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,711
We got to
have a statement, Pete.

955
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,772
Come on, Pete.

956
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,718
If you'll just shut up
I'll give you a statement.

957
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,550
Mad Dog Williams
shot his way out.

958
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,180
My men chased him up
to the top floor,

959
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,747
but he got out
through the skylight.

960
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,292
We've searched the roof,
nothing.

961
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,124
We figured he must've slid down
the rain pipe to the street.

962
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,221
Still not straight
on what happened in your office.

963
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,357
I told you Dr. Eggelhofer

964
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:18,368
was asking him
some questions, very polite.

965
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,700
All of a sudden,
Williams started firing.

966
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:24,208
One bullet hit the doctor
in the groin, the second one went wild,

967
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,470
and the third shot
just grazed my ear.

968
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,603
One more inch and...
Oh, boy.

969
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,705
What we want to know is,
where did Williams get the gun?

970
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,217
Yeah, well, tha-that's what
I'd like to know, myself.

971
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,616
Was it smuggled
into his cell?

972
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,984
Maybe under the roast beef
and Brussels sprouts?

973
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,524
You sure that
Chaplain's a Methodist, not a Communist?

974
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,582
Is this the work
of outside agitators?

975
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,221
Boys, boys, I assure you
I'll follow up every single lead.

976
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,790
Right now, my entire force
plus 200 special deputies--

977
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:55,564
Make way. Make way.
Make way!

978
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,798
What happened in there,
Doc?

979
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,467
Care to give us your version?

980
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:00,738
Is Williams sane
or insane?

981
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,246
Please, gentlemen,
no statements, no questions.

982
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,043
I'm in terrible pain

983
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,983
after what he did to me,
that fruitcake.

984
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,542
Stand back, let him through.

985
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,212
Where are they taking me?

986
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,519
Passavant hospital.
Just 5 minutes from here.

987
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,388
No. No. No. No.

988
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,429
I want to go to
the Allgemeines Krankenhaus

989
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:20,123
on Alserstrasse.

990
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,256
Where is that?

991
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,664
In Vienna. I do not
trust American doctors.

992
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,099
You'll never make it
to Vienna.

993
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:29,105
In this case, I want a big mirror
and some instruments.

994
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,107
I shall operate on myself.

995
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,268
Is this your first trip
to the United States?

996
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,675
How do you like Chicago?

997
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,042
<i>Sprechen sie Yiddish?</i>

998
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,674
Where'd he get you, Doc?
Right in the old love bells?

999
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,544
Pete, if you don't mind,
there's a couple of things

1000
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,019
about that story
that bother me.

1001
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,181
Is that so?
Well, you're bothering me.

1002
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:47,815
You don't work
here anymore, Johnson.

1003
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,951
I don't have to
talk to you.

1004
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,461
Jennie, will you mop
up my floor, please?

1005
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,861
There's blood
all over it.

1006
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,365
Right away, Sheriff.
As soon as I get a new bucket.

1007
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:58,265
I've got my own ideas
about the escape.

1008
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:59,268
You do?

1009
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:01,464
Oh, yeah. I think you let
Earl Williams out yourself,

1010
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,268
so he could vote
for you next Tuesday.

1011
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,740
Very funny.

1012
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,721
What happened
to your bucket, Jennie?

1013
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:27,786
He shot it.

1014
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:28,797
Who shot it?

1015
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,855
That Earl Williams.

1016
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:32,926
I was cleaning the office next door
when it all happened.

1017
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:33,936
You saw it?

1018
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,905
No. But I could hear
what was going on.

1019
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,031
What?

1020
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:39,872
I better keep my mouth shut,
'cause he wouldn't like it.

1021
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:40,842
Who?

1022
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:42,607
The Sheriff. He'd fire me.

1023
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,114
Jennie, we've been friends
for a long time.

1024
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,778
You told me that your husband could play
his dentures with a teaspoon,

1025
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,320
who got him
on the Amateur Hour?

1026
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,618
Well, I really shouldn't,
but I-- I...

1027
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,335
<i>Attention all cars,</i>
<i>attention.</i>

1028
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,205
<i>A man answering Earl Williams'</i>
<i>description has been seen boarding</i>

1029
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,767

00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:15,869
<i>Please investigate.</i>

1031
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:22,980
<i>Earl Williams</i>
<i>has been reported</i>

1032
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,453
<i>in vicinity of</i>
<i>Wrigley building.</i>

1033
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:25,648
<i>Proceed there immediately.</i>

1034
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,490
<i>Here's a late report.</i>

1035
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,724
<i>Earl Williams has just</i>
<i>been spotted in a rowboat</i>

1036
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,029
<i>on Lake Michigan</i>
<i>disguised as a nun.</i>

1037
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,567
Fruitcake!

1038
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,367
Fruitcake!

1039
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,609
Fruitcake!

1040
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,269
Dr. Eggelhofer is on his way
to Passavant Hospital

1041
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,643
to operate on himself.

1042
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:24,976
You heard me.

1043
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,676
Tightest dragnet
in Chicago's history

1044
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,150
is happening
in the North side.

1045
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,086
Sheriff Hartman expects Williams
to be recaptured any moment now.

1046
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,487
Which means they don't
have the slightest idea where he is.

1047
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,048
Here's a cute little sideline,
I just spoke to the hangman.

1048
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,652
Whether they get
Williams back or not, he gets his $50.

1049
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:39,821
It's play or pay.

1050
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,455
Hold on,
I have something coming up.

1051
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,022
This is Schwartz.
Give me rewrite.

1052
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,625
Mr. Schwartz, your wife
left this for you. Stuffed cabbage.

1053
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:46,692
Ugh.

1054
00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:49,501
A tear-gas bomb went off accidentally
in one of the Sheriff's cars.

1055
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,564
The following deputies
needed emergency treatment:

1056
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,234
Ted Kowalski,
Philip Lustgarten--

1057
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,007
She said to be sure
to bring home the pot.

1058
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,742
Joe Matsburg, Wally Coogan,
William Gilhooley.

1059
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,875
The Crime Commission
has offered $1,000

1060
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,145
for the capture of Williams.

1061
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,709
No one knows about the gun.

1062
00:47:03,788 --> 00:47:05,483
Maybe the Reds dropped it
by parachute.

1063
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,956
How're we doing?
Any flashes, any scoops?

1064
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:09,549
It's almost deadline time,
you know.

1065
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:10,651
You still here?

1066
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:13,788
Showing the kid the ropes.
Listen, Rudy, the Mayor's car drove up.

1067
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,661
See if you can get
a statement from him.

1068
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,223
The Mayor
just showed up. More later.

1069
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,030
There's gonna
be fireworks.

1070
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:29,875
This is Hildy,
get me Walter.

1071
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,108
I forgot to tell you,
Miss Peggy Grant called.

1072
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,583
Peggy? Oh, my God,
I forgot. Walter?

1073
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:36,142
Will you
get out of here?

1074
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,653
Walter, I got the story.

1075
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:39,212
It's a pip,
and I got it exclusive.

1076
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,354
That's my Hildy.
You see why I love you?

1077
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,053
Okay, let's have it.

1078
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,756
It's the jailbreak
of your dreams.

1079
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,595
No. No Bolshevik plot.
The whole thing was an inside job.

1080
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,067
And guess
where he got the gun?

1081
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,933
All loaded and ready to fire?

1082
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,938
Damn it, hang on, will you?

1083
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:02,007
Yeah? Peggy. Hi, baby. Hi.

1084
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,244
I'm sorry. I know
I'm late, darling. But--

1085
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:07,045
No, I'm not
getting drunk.

1086
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,745
The party's already over.
It's just--

1087
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,048
For God's sake,
wait a minute, Walter.

1088
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:14,614
We could save time, love.
Instead of me coming downtown,

1089
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:17,957
why don't you grab a cab and pick me up
on the way. How about that?

1090
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,359
You're a sweetheart.

1091
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,864
Okay, Walter, here we go.

1092
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:25,493
That profound thinker
from Vienna, Dr. Max J. Eggelhofer

1093
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,037
in order to prove
some cockamamie theory

1094
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,505
decides to reenact the crime.

1095
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,337
Naturally, he needs
a gun, huh.

1096
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,071
Who do you think supplied it?

1097
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,744
Don't tell me.
Sheriff Peter B. Hartman?

1098
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:39,044
That's right. "B" for brains.

1099
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,913
That idiot hands his gun
to the Professor,

1100
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:42,509
the Professor
points it at Williams,

1101
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,781
Williams takes the gun
from the Professor and shoots him,

1102
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:45,913
right where the money is.

1103
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:49,021
That's beautiful.
Where's Eggelhofer now?

1104
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,627
Okay, here's what
I want you to do.

1105
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,027
Get to the hospital
and get ahold of that bullet.

1106
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,032
So, if the Sheriff
tries to deny the story--

1107
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,899
Hold it. Walter, I'm not going to
any hospital, not stealing any bullets.

1108
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,597
There may be
further developments.

1109
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,902
In the meantime,
bat me out a lead.

1110
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:07,102
You know, "Sheriff Hartman:
Stooge of Stalin or simply stupid?"

1111
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:09,169
If we move fast, we can make
the early edition.

1112
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:12,241
You don't understand, Walter.
I've quit.

1113
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,511
I gave you that story
as a personal favor

1114
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:17,554
because you're such a warm,
loveable human being but that's it.

1115
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,590
My girl's picking me up
in 15 minutes, it's goodbye Chicago,

1116
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,922
goodbye <i>Examiner,</i>
goodbye to you.

1117
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,289
You maniac.

1118
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:48,479
<i>Listen, you...</i>

1119
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,722
<i>...not even their wives.</i>

1120
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,362
<i>Now you want to throw it</i>
<i>all away for a dame?</i>

1121
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:02,922
<i>You got the brains</i>
<i>of a pancake.</i>

1122
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,930
Same to you, buster.

1123
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,739
How is this going to affect
the election, Your Honor?

1124
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,298
Will it cost you
the colored vote?

1125
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,900
The law and order vote?
No comments.

1126
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,536
You're gonna stand there
all night

1127
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,012
giving us that
"no comment" crap?

1128
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:18,013
No comment.

1129
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:20,550
The way we see it, you've got
your ass in a sling, Your Honor.

1130
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:21,812
Rubbish.

1131
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:24,320
The voters of Chicago
will not let themselves be swayed

1132
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,151
by this
unfortunate incident.

1133
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,783
They have complete confidence
in their Mayor,

1134
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,555
just as I have complete faith
in Sheriff Hartman.

1135
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,496
And I'm sure you boys
share that faith and confidence.

1136
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:35,623
No comment.

1137
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,792
Sorry to break in
but we've located Williams.

1138
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,892
This time, for real.

1139
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,197
Where?
On North Wabash,

1140
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,330
at the offices of the Friends
of American Liberty.

1141
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,306
One of our patrols
spotted him in the alley.

1142
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,036
All right.
Get every available man.

1143
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,441
Seal off the whole area.

1144
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,605
But remember, God damn it,
I want him taken alive.

1145
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:51,579
Check.

1146
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:53,014
There's your story, boys.

1147
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,550
Wait for us, Fatso.

1148
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,053
Okay, Pete.
Now, suppose you explain it to me.

1149
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:07,120
How the hell can a guy escape
with a double guard

1150
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,461
around the jail
and 200 extra deputies?

1151
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,057
Well, it could happen
to anybody.

1152
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:12,966
It wouldn't have happened
to Prohaska.

1153
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:15,904
I knew I should've
put him on the ticket instead of you.

1154
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,270
You-- you-- you piss-brain.

1155
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,866
Please, Herbie,

1156
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:22,811
I've always been a good party man.
A team player.

1157
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,781
Jesus, we're having that
fund-raising dinner at the Palmer House.

1158
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,180
All the big money is there.

1159
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,446
I'm about to make a pitch
for campaign contributions,

1160
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,613
and then I get news
like this.

1161
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,488
Calm down, Herbie.
It's all over now.

1162
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:35,718
You've heard the latest.

1163
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,988
They've got Williams.
He can't get away.

1164
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:40,929
What do you mean, he can't get away?
He got away, didn't he?

1165
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,192
Herbie, I personally--

1166
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,494
Don't call me
Herbie any more.

1167
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,467
From now on,
it's Your Honor.

1168
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:46,730
Yes.

1169
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:48,305
Your Honor?

1170
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:49,634
I'm warning you, Pete,

1171
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,470
if you don't have Williams
on the gallows

1172
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,373
by 7:00 a.m.,
then God help you.

1173
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:56,504
Because you might
just as well go ahead and hang yourself.

1174
00:51:58,716 --> 00:51:59,876
# Am I awake now? #

1175
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:01,780
# Or am I dreaming? #

1176
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,517
# Congratulate me,
step right up #

1177
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,680
# Shake my hand #

1178
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:08,589
Uh, excuse me.
Which way is the Sheriff's office?

1179
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:09,887
That way.

1180
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,367
Uh, Sheriff Hartman?

1181
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,532
In here.

1182
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:26,408
Oh, my name is Plunkett.

1183
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,910
I just came up
from Springfield.

1184
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,377
I got somethin' for you.
What?

1185
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:30,538
From the Governor.

1186
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:31,638
What's from the Governor?

1187
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,182
It's a reprieve
for Earl Williams.

1188
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,182
For who?

1189
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,240
Earl Williams.

1190
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,344
What a hassle getting over here
from the station.

1191
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:39,651
All those police cars
on the wrong side of the street

1192
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:40,951
and runnin'
the red lights.

1193
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,492
Is this a joke
or something?

1194
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,424
The Governor has
a commission to consider

1195
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,292
last-minute appeals
for clemency.

1196
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,694
He can't do that
to us.

1197
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,699
Oh, there was a stack
of mail this high

1198
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:52,031
and a telegram this long
with 4,000 signatures.

1199
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,433
How do we know
this is not fake?

1200
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,529
Yeah. Could be some sort
of a Communist trick.

1201
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:58,131
Oh, no. I was right there
with the Governor when he signed it.

1202
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,335
Get the Governor on the phone.
Oh, you can't.

1203
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,208
We can't?
He's gone fishing.

1204
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,372
Just him, an Indian guide,
and a canoe.

1205
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:05,642
No phone, no nothin'.

1206
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,650
He sure picked a hell of a time
to go fishing.

1207
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,411
Excuse me.

1208
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,455
Uh, just between us,
it's not really fishing.

1209
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:15,219
Because that Indian guide
is really a girl.

1210
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,159
She isn't even Indian.
She's from New Jersey.

1211
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,752
Yes, Jacobi.

1212
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,656
What? You do?

1213
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,798
Are you sure?
Herbie. Your Honor!

1214
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:28,765
Hold on a minute.

1215
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,641
It's Jacobi.
They've got him trapped.

1216
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,041
They've surrounded
the building.

1217
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,612
Tell him to stay
on the line.

1218
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,738
Stay on the line.

1219
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:39,806
Don't make a move
till I say so.

1220
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,153
Look, Mr. Plunkett,
about this reprieve, we can't accept it.

1221
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,210
But why not?

1222
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:46,347
It wouldn't be legal.

1223
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,516
We don't have Earl Williams
in our custody.

1224
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,684
You don't?
Where is he?

1225
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,692
He escaped.

1226
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:51,955
You saw
those police cars.

1227
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:53,223
We're looking for him.

1228
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:54,628
Oh, dear. That is a problem.

1229
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,222
I think I better phone
the Governor.

1230
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,632
You can't. He's off fishing.
Remember?

1231
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:01,398
So, why don't you
come back tomorrow morning?

1232
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:04,305
I'm sure by then,
we'll have him back in our jurisdiction.

1233
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,069
You mean,
spend the night in Chicago?

1234
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:07,667
Any objections?

1235
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,178
Well, no, sirree, Bob.

1236
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,407
Trouble is,
I don't know anybody here.

1237
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,211
Do you like Chinese food?

1238
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,877
Well, I'm not really hungry,
I had a sandwich on the train.

1239
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:18,183
But you didn't have
a Chinese sandwich.

1240
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,347
I never heard of it.

1241
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,981
You'll never forget it.

1242
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:22,821
Ask for Madame Chow.

1243
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,151
Tell her the Green Hornet
sent you.

1244
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:26,287
The Green Hornet?

1245
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,797
And just put everything
on my tab.

1246
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,330
Well, that's
very kind of you.

1247
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,697
Not at all.
Not at all.

1248
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,236
And you can use
my chopsticks.

1249
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,292
Oh, thank you.

1250
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,202
Uh, goodbye, Sheriff.

1251
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,578
He's waiting for instructions.
What are we gonna do?

1252
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,113
Tell him to shoot
to kill.

1253
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:45,113
What?

1254
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:46,706
Shoot to kill,
I said.

1255
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,014
I-- I don't know, Herbie.
What about that reprieve?

1256
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:50,212
l-lf it ever comes out.

1257
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,982
Nobody reprieved
that policeman he shot.

1258
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,613
There was no clemency,
either.

1259
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,419
Do what I tell you!

1260
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:59,862
Jacobi, you there?
Listen. Shoot to kill!

1261
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:01,288
You heard me.

1262
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,162
Okay, okay, Sheriff.

1263
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,791
Only, I thought
you wanted him alive.

1264
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,495
Anything you say,
Sheriff.

1265
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,266
<i>We know you're up there,</i>
<i>Williams.</i>

1266
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,608
<i>Now, this is</i>
<i>your last chance.</i>

1267
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,143
<i>Throw the gun</i>
<i>out the window</i>

1268
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:23,209
<i>and come out</i>
<i>with your hands up.</i>

1269
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,850
<i>Or we'll smoke you out.</i>

1270
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:29,723
New instructions.
No bullhorn, no tear gas.

1271
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,521
We go in there,
and we go in shooting.

1272
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:42,032
All set!
Let's go, men!

1273
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,433
Give us a break, fellas,
we're Press.

1274
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,410
Christ, we're gonna miss
the whole thing. Come on, will you?

1275
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:49,467
Stand back.

1276
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,775
Do you suppose there's a bathroom
around here?

1277
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,317
Ah.

1278
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:47,627
The future Mrs. Johnson,
I presume?

1279
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,103
Been waiting long,
darling?

1280
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,505
Only my whole life.
I'm sorry I was tied up.

1281
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:57,103
Oh, like all the orchids
in the Bahamas.

1282
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,241
What do you say we pick up
the bags first then eat at the station?

1283
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,787
Let's. Have you
got the tickets?

1284
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:07,346
Have I got the tickets.
A lower for you and an upper for me.

1285
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,358
Oh, no, darling.
You take the lower.

1286
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,485
Tell you what?
Why don't we both take the lower?

1287
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,060
What about
the conductor?

1288
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:15,723
He can have the upper.

1289
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,090
Where to, Mac?

1290
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:19,335
Huh?

1291
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,530
Uh-oh. Oh.

1292
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,938
Uh, no place, huh?
Just stay here. God damned idiot.

1293
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,134
Who?
Me.

1294
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,040
I left the wedding rings
in the pressroom.

1295
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,703
I hope the bums
haven't stolen them.

1296
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,008
I'll be back.

1297
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,554
You don't mind waiting,
do you?

1298
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,321
What's there to mind?

1299
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,486
The night's young,

1300
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:48,224
the orchids are smelling,
the meter is running.

1301
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,663
Just made another nickel.

1302
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,647
Jesus Christ Almighty.

1303
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,050
Shut the door.

1304
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,221
Okay, okay, Earl.
Hey, just put the gun down.

1305
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:24,267
I said, shut the door!

1306
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,163
How in the hell
did you--

1307
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,298
I've been hanging
in the airshaft,

1308
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,366
but I couldn't
hold on any longer.

1309
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,435
They-- They got me
in the arm. Don't move!

1310
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,874
You realize they're looking for you
all over Chicago?

1311
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:42,517
You cops.

1312
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,851
You're all so dumb.

1313
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,718
I'm not a cop, Earl.
You know me. Hildy Johnson.

1314
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:52,057
I interviewed you
in your cell.

1315
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:58,364
Oh, yeah. I remember.
Yeah. I read every word.

1316
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:03,098
"An outraged minnow battling

1317
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:06,006
against the tides
of injustice."

1318
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:08,039
I liked that.

1319
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:12,608
Earl?

1320
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,511
Earl?

1321
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,514
Oh, oh-- oh.

1322
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:31,763
Hello. Yeah, Duffy.
This is Hildy. Get me Walter.

1323
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:34,895
Well, I don't give a damn!
Just get him. This is urgent.

1324
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:47,006
Walter? W-Walter, listen.

1325
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:49,745
Will you for Christ's sake listen?
Now get this.

1326
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,983
I'm only going to say it once,
I've got Earl Williams.

1327
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:56,249
What's the gag?
You got him where?

1328
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:01,058
Honest to God? You swear?

1329
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,824
Jesus!

1330
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,301
<i>Examiner</i> captures
Earl Williams.

1331
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:08,965
I'll be right over.

1332
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,735
You better. Because I don't know
how long I can keep him sewed up.

1333
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:15,436
Damn it,
there's someone at the door.

1334
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,471
Just a minute.

1335
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,357
Coming.

1336
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:35,789
Mollie.
Where is he?

1337
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:38,061
Who? Who?
Earl. I hear they got him trapped.

1338
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,363
For God's sake,
tell me where.

1339
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:41,461
I don't know. Ask down
in the Sheriff's office.

1340
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:43,403
They wouldn't give me
the time of day.

1341
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,873
There's nothing you can do here.
Go home and wait.

1342
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,933
Wait for what?
The morning papers,

1343
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:50,138
so I can read how they
shot him down like a dog,

1344
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,373
the yellow murderers?

1345
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,382
And who's gonna give a damn?
Not you guys.

1346
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,475
'Cause all you care about
is a stinking headline.

1347
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:57,076
Hello, Mollie.

1348
01:00:58,421 --> 01:00:59,581
Earl.

1349
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,291
Thank you for the roses.

1350
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,583
Earl, what have they
done to you?

1351
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,425
They were after me with searchlights,
but I fooled them.

1352
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,964
We gotta get him
to a doctor.

1353
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:09,964
A doctor?

1354
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,763
He'd just turn him over to the cops.
And we don't want that, do we?

1355
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,428
So I'll fool them again.

1356
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,529
I'll bleed to death
before they can hang me.

1357
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:18,403
No, Earl. You mustn't
talk like that.

1358
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,306
Hold the towel,
stick your arm out.

1359
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:22,140
Hey, hey, this
isn't my suit, you know.

1360
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:23,873
It's government property.

1361
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:25,676
They'll be very sore.

1362
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:30,617
Who's that?

1363
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,881
It's me, Peggy.

1364
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:34,389
Peggy who?
I'll be right with you.

1365
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,315
Keep him quiet.

1366
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,330
Peggy! What's on your mind?

1367
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:43,861
Oh, nothing in particular.

1368
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:45,697
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

1369
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,862
I didn't forget.
The taxi, downstairs.

1370
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:50,964
You might be interested to know,
the cab driver just proposed to me.

1371
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,373
And as soon as the meter hits $10,
I'm accepting.

1372
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:54,603
Don't worry.
I got the rings.

1373
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,976
I need a few minutes.
I'm waiting for Walter to show up.

1374
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,174
You're not getting involved
with Burns again?

1375
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:00,648
Of course not.
God forbid.

1376
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,378
Things are breaking
around here,

1377
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:05,751
this hot potato dropped right in my lap.
As soon as Walter gets here--

1378
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:06,914
Hildy, what is that?

1379
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,514
Nothing.
Is that a gun?

1380
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:13,029
Don't be silly. Now, you just take
the cab and you pick up all the bags,

1381
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,656
yours and mine, come back here.
I'll meet you downstairs.

1382
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,994
What are you doing
with a gun?

1383
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,365
I'll explain it later, honey.
On the train.

1384
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,199
In that lower berth,
hmm? Hmm?

1385
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:22,427
Okay?

1386
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:24,804
I can't wait.

1387
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:31,105
You don't have to
answer this, Mollie,

1388
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,081
but is it true
what they said in the papers?

1389
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:34,377
What'd they say?

1390
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:38,512
That you were willing to marry me
on the gallows.

1391
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:43,724
Well, if it's in the papers,
it must be true.

1392
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,951
They wouldn't print a lie.

1393
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:49,260
The funny thing is, the last night in
your place, I was gonna propose to you

1394
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,323
but I couldn't
go through with it.

1395
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:52,925
Of course you couldn't.

1396
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:54,971
Because you know
how I earn my living.

1397
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:56,300
No. It's not you, Mollie.

1398
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:57,931
You're the best person
I know.

1399
01:02:58,008 --> 01:03:00,442
It's me.
I just had nothing to offer you.

1400
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,738
Earl, hold still.

1401
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,972
I wrote out a will
and I gave it to the warden.

1402
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:06,277
I'm leaving everything
to you.

1403
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:08,679
A pile of books.

1404
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:11,846
Maybe you can get something
for them second hand.

1405
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:16,324
And a picture of my mother,
in a silver frame

1406
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,490
and a souvenir pillow
from Atlantic City.

1407
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,535
Hey, who locked the door?

1408
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,169
Anybody in there?

1409
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,502
Uh, just a minute.

1410
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:33,041
Open up, will you?

1411
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,270
In here. No, that's no good.

1412
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:38,778
You better climb out on...
No, not with that arm.

1413
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,281
What the hell's going on?

1414
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,476
Oh, my God!

1415
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:43,047
The desk!

1416
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:50,519
For Christ's sake,
we gotta get to the phones.

1417
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:51,617
What's the trouble?

1418
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:53,424
Hildy's in there
and won't open the door.

1419
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,487
Hey, Hildy.
What's the big idea?

1420
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,065
Hold your water. I'm coming.

1421
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,964
Dead quiet.
Don't even breathe.

1422
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,367
I'll be right here, Earl.
I won't leave you.

1423
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,235
Gee, Mollie,
you're swell.

1424
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:08,340
What are you trying to do,
kick down the building?

1425
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:09,537
This some kind of game?

1426
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:10,704
You don't own
this office.

1427
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,008
Shit, man,
we got work to do.

1428
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:13,879
Watch your language.

1429
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:19,946
Oh, I beg your pardon,
ma'am.

1430
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,923
Kinda cozy,
with the shades down.

1431
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,788
Are you practicing
for your honeymoon?

1432
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,885
City desk.
What happened? Did they get Williams?

1433
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,827
They couldn't catch
a fart in a rain barrel.

1434
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:30,559
Halloween going on out there.
Murphy. You ready?

1435
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,328
Sheriff's rifle squad
stormed offices

1436
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:33,960
of Friends
of American Liberty,

1437
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,766
fired off 800 rounds
of ammunition.

1438
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,500
Casualties included
a water cooler,

1439
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:40,873
two mimeograph machines
and Rufus McBride, a deaf janitor.

1440
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:43,310
During the shootout,
Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, aged 33,

1441
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,177
watching from a window
across the street

1442
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,944
gave premature birth
to a five-and-a-half-pound baby boy.

1443
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:51,248
Sheriff's deputies examined the infant
to make sure it wasn't Earl Williams,

1444
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,084
who they knew was
hiding somewhere.

1445
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:54,282
What a screw-up.

1446
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:57,588
Right now my boss is throwing
a costume ball in San Simeon

1447
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,925
with Marion Davies
and Ronald Coleman and Vilma Banky.

1448
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,191
Okay. Here goes.

1449
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:05,063
Special Deputy Herman Shulty,
the Sheriff's brother-in-law,

1450
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:07,569
who was leading a search party
through the Wrigley Building

1451
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,298
has sent out a call
for immediate help.

1452
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,203
Somebody stole
his police car.

1453
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,298
City desk.

1454
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:13,433
Give me rewrite.

1455
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,910
The wounded janitor was taken
to Passavant Hospital

1456
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:19,176
where he joins Dr. Eggelhofer and
the six deputies injured by tear gas.

1457
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,716
They're opening up
a special wing.

1458
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:23,753
Yeah. There's no point
in talking to the Sheriff.

1459
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,481
He doesn't know shit
from Shineola.

1460
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:27,921
Roadblocks have been set up
at main intersections.

1461
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:30,221
So far, three police cars
have smashed into them.

1462
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,351
Here's the latest.

1463
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,861
Police launch,
acting on a hot tip,

1464
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,226
sank a rowboat
in Lake Michigan.

1465
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:37,164
The suspect turned out to be
Sister Theresa of lmmaculate Heart.

1466
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,497
She is resting comfortably
in Jewish Community Hospital.

1467
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,129
You should've been there.
You missed all the excitement.

1468
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,137
Did I?

1469
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:44,673
Everybody's been
so nice to me.

1470
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,834
Coming back here,
they let me pay for the taxi.

1471
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,207
Ah, you're
on your way, slick.

1472
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:51,111
I should've stayed here
with the stuffed cabbage.

1473
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:54,740
What are you doing in my chair?
Go flop somewhere else.

1474
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:56,809
Lay off her.
She's not hurting anything.

1475
01:05:56,886 --> 01:06:00,151
Out, out. Go peddle
your goodies on Division Street.

1476
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:03,551
If all men were like you,
I'd starve to death.

1477
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,885
If you don't mind,
I'd like to call my office.

1478
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,897
You got something good?

1479
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,728
An exclusive interview

1480
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,062
with that janitor
who was shot.

1481
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,865
If I were you, I wouldn't use
this phone. I'd go down the hall.

1482
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:15,996
Why?

1483
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,370
Because you're the only legitimate
newspaperman here.

1484
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:19,772
All these bums
steal your stuff.

1485
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:23,438
Oh, let them. They don't have my style.
The Bensinger touch.

1486
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:27,343
Hold it!
Don't move.

1487
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,975
What's the matter?
Uh-huh, nose bleed.

1488
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:30,417
Put your head back.

1489
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,954
Oh, must be
my blood pressure.

1490
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,750
Or menopause or something.
Hey, slick.

1491
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,484
He needs help.
Take him in there.

1492
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,025
There's a towel
in my desk.

1493
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,288
Never mind. Put that ice on
the back of his neck.

1494
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:40,727
Oh, thank you,
dear boy.

1495
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:43,789
Look, I'm pretending there
ain't no Earl Williams. So, goodbye.

1496
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:45,164
He's been seen where?

1497
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:47,499
Bullshit. I'm not going
on a wild goose chase.

1498
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,130
One more guy in Chicago
with a gun, who's gonna notice?

1499
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,970
Let's get back to work.
Deal the cards.

1500
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,339
Who pulled down the shades?

1501
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,399
Hildy.

1502
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,207
They were shooting
at the window again.

1503
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,770
I thought you had
to catch a train.

1504
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,611
Yeah. You were in
such a goddamn hurry.

1505
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,877
Slight change
of plans.

1506
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,111
I'm being picked up here.

1507
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,245
You know, fellas,

1508
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:09,413
I got a whole different theory
about where Williams is.

1509
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,854
You do?

1510
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:12,986
I don't think

1511
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,155
he's in any of those places
they've been looking.

1512
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:16,698
Well, that's obvious.

1513
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:20,099
There's no way he could've gotten out
with all those guards around.

1514
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,568
What are you driving at?

1515
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,663
If he was coming down
the rain pipe,

1516
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,436
he could've climbed into
any of those windows along the way.

1517
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,409
My hunch is he's somewhere
in this building.

1518
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:30,105
Oh, sure.
He's hanging around

1519
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,578
like a duck
in a shooting gallery.

1520
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,741
The mastermind at work.
Hawkshaw.

1521
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:36,182
What correspondence school
did you graduate from?

1522
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,083
All right. All right.

1523
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:39,946
But maybe it isn't
all that meshuga.

1524
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:42,924
Maybe he climbed back into his cell
and is hiding under his bed.

1525
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:45,153
Yeah, maybe he's stashed away
in some filing cabinet

1526
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,217
under "F" for fruitcake.

1527
01:07:46,296 --> 01:07:47,820
He's probably waiting
until morning,

1528
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,730
then he'll come tap dancing down the
stairs singing <i>I Surrender Dear.</i>

1529
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:54,302
Hey, wait a minute, fellas.
Maybe Schwartz has got something.

1530
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,701
We ought to search
the building.

1531
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:57,103
Us? Search the building?

1532
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:58,162
Remember he's got
a gun.

1533
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,265
Let the cops do it.

1534
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,435
Jesus. You got the story
right under your noses.

1535
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:04,309
Let's spread out. Everybody
take a floor. I'll cover for you.

1536
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,472
Oh, you will?
Sure.

1537
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,072
That's white of you.
Glad to do it.

1538
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,981
You wouldn't be
trying to throw us a curve?

1539
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:10,110
Where'd you get
that idea?

1540
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,244
Something funny's
going on.

1541
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,118
We found him
and Mollie alone.

1542
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:14,679
Door locked
and shades down.

1543
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,452
What the hell
were you doing?

1544
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,153
What do you think
we were doin'?

1545
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,024
Playing Parcheesi?

1546
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:23,592
Okay, fans, so now you know.

1547
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,463
Guy's entitled to have
a little fun, hmm?

1548
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,196
The night before
you get married?

1549
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,362
Don't give us that crap.

1550
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,339
I don't know about you guys,
but with the sirens wailing,

1551
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,103
the bullets flying,
all hell breaking loose

1552
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:36,470
I find that sort
of stimulating.

1553
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,207
Sexually,
if you know what I mean.

1554
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,373
You and Mollie?

1555
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,610
Come on. You got
better taste than that.

1556
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,278
Take that back,
or I'll belt you one.

1557
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,950
You weren't screwing Mollie.
You were trying to screw us.

1558
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:51,357
Like you did on that
St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

1559
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,224
Yeah. Sending us
to the wrong garage.

1560
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,729
You think we forgot that?

1561
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,128
That's the business.
Dog eat dog.

1562
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:57,461
What're you
trying to pull now?

1563
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,465
Me? I've quit.

1564
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:00,126
One last stunt
to make us look stupid.

1565
01:09:00,203 --> 01:09:01,363
That wouldn't be too hard.

1566
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,597
Give us the lowdown.

1567
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:04,105
You're on to something.

1568
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:05,970
You wouldn't hold out
on your pals.

1569
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,236
You shan't
scoop us this time.

1570
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,676
All right, fellas.
I was lyin'.

1571
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:11,179
But I'm gonna
level with you now.

1572
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,339
You better.

1573
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:14,713
The address of that garage
is 2122 North Clark Street.

1574
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,183
You miserable bastard!

1575
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,984
What are they doing
to Mr. Johnson?

1576
01:09:20,056 --> 01:09:21,546
What are they doing
to my desk?

1577
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:22,886
Gentlemen, please.

1578
01:09:25,862 --> 01:09:27,693
You won't get away with it,
Hildy.

1579
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:28,924
What about Williams?

1580
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:29,396
Where is he?

1581
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,561
We'll kick your balls in.

1582
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,966
Leave him alone!
He doesn't know anything!

1583
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:35,095
Says who?

1584
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,138
Says me!

1585
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,696
I'm the only one who knows
where Earl Williams is.

1586
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,208
Yeah? Where?

1587
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:44,241
Why should I tell you anything,
you lousy crumbs?

1588
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,406
Don't let her out.
Somebody close the door.

1589
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:47,540
You ain't going anywhere.

1590
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:48,641
Where is he?

1591
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,812
I never squealed on anybody in my life,
and I ain't squealing now.

1592
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:53,913
Come on, you tart,
or we'll slap it out of you.

1593
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,515
We'll turn you over to the cops.
They'll make you talk.

1594
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,719
Get your hands
off of me, you...

1595
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:03,626
Put that chair down.

1596
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,565
Somebody get behind her.
Oh, no, you don't.

1597
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:08,160
You just keep away
from me, you shit-heels!

1598
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:10,703
Let go of me, you...

1599
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,309
Six big guys
ganging up on a girl.

1600
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,844
Let me know
if you need any help.

1601
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:17,038
You stay out of it,
Hildy.

1602
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:18,205
Somebody grab her.

1603
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:21,182
You try it and I'll break
your goddamn heads!

1604
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,912
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

1605
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:26,352
If you ask me,
you're going about this the wrong way.

1606
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:27,582
Well, who asked you?

1607
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,421
Mollie, if you have any information,
we'll pay you for it.

1608
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:31,892
Sure. We'll all
chip in.

1609
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,189
We'll give you $20.

1610
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,924
Yeah? I'm a whore, ain't I?
I'll do anything for money.

1611
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:37,955
We'll make it $50.

1612
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:39,865
You know how many
customers that is?

1613
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:41,733
Save a lot of wear and tear
on your ass.

1614
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,294
Why don't you all
drop dead?

1615
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,634
All right, you slut...

1616
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,641
Want us to get
rough with you?

1617
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,700
Take that chair away from her.

1618
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:50,973
Watch out for those
goddamn heels.

1619
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,946
Oh, dear.
Must be my editor.

1620
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,540
You bitch! Come on, talk.

1621
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,643
I'll see you
in hell first.

1622
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,249
All right.

1623
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:05,658
You want to know
where Earl Williams is?

1624
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,930
I'll tell you where he is.

1625
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:13,631
Just follow me.

1626
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,665
Mollie!

1627
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,205
Jesus.

1628
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,107
Holy God.

1629
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:28,946
She's killed herself for sure.

1630
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,009
That's terrible.
You drove her to it.

1631
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:32,611
I never thought
she'd do that.

1632
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:33,780
What'd you expect?

1633
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:35,824
All whores are
a little goofy.

1634
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,484
Hey, she's not dead!

1635
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,994
Look, look. She's moving.

1636
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,290
Come on, let's go.

1637
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:42,558
What a story.

1638
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:45,766
Shady lady leaps for love!

1639
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:55,536
Walter, did you see that?
She jumped.

1640
01:11:58,214 --> 01:11:59,374
Yeah.

1641
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:03,850
Where is he?

1642
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,579
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1643
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,523
Come on, come on. There's no time
for that. Where have you got Williams?

1644
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:11,925
Pull those shades.

1645
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,495
Hi, Earl. How you doing?
Don't worry, I'm your friend.

1646
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:16,759
Where's Mollie?
What happened?

1647
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,266
What did they do to her?

1648
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,995
She's gonna be
all right.

1649
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,798
Let me out!
I can't stand it!

1650
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:24,567
Just stay where you are.
You're sitting pretty.

1651
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,373
Now, then,
let's get organized.

1652
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:31,243
Hello.
Burns here, get me Duffy.

1653
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,346
I don't hear
that typewriter, Hildy.

1654
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:35,816
Get your ass over there.

1655
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,046
I want some of that
old Johnson word magic.

1656
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,282
What're you waiting for?

1657
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,587
I'm waiting for my girl, that's what
I'm waitin' for. She's gonna pick me up.

1658
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,719
Your girl? What are you,
some puking college boy?

1659
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:49,264
This is the hottest story
since the Chicago fire!

1660
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:51,459
We'll make monkeys
out of all the other papers.

1661
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:53,468
We'll kick City Hall over
like an applecart.

1662
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:54,560
Expose the bastards, huh?

1663
01:12:54,637 --> 01:12:56,571
Expose them?
We'll crucify 'em!

1664
01:12:56,639 --> 01:12:58,197
You and I will be
running this town.

1665
01:12:58,274 --> 01:12:59,764
They'll be naming streets
after us.

1666
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,901
Johnson Street.
Burns Boulevard.

1667
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:04,811
How come you're a boulevard,
I'm only a street?

1668
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,179
Duffy?
Where the hell is Duffy?

1669
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:10,046
Somebody answer me!

1670
01:13:11,354 --> 01:13:12,446
Y-Y-Yes?

1671
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:15,615
Get your head back in there,
you goddamn turtle.

1672
01:13:18,027 --> 01:13:19,289
Quit stalling, Hildy.

1673
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:21,159
Get that machine
and tear into it.

1674
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,131
Now, listen, Earl,
when I rap three times,

1675
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:28,167
that means the coast is clear.
Understand?

1676
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:31,034
Attaboy.

1677
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,637
How long do you think
you can hide him in there?

1678
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:36,269
No problem. We take him to the <i>Examiner,</i>
keep him under wraps

1679
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,006
until we can break
the story exclusive.

1680
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,810
How're you gonna get him outta here?
The cops will see him.

1681
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,214
Not if he's inside
the desk.

1682
01:13:42,285 --> 01:13:43,877
You're gonna move
the whole desk? How?

1683
01:13:43,953 --> 01:13:46,353
We'll lower it out of the window
if necessary.

1684
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,718
Duffy?

1685
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,191
Duffy!
Where the hell have you been?

1686
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,524
Screw your diabetes.
Here's what I want you to do.

1687
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,826
Send over one of
our delivery trucks right away

1688
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,422
with six gorillas
from circulation.

1689
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,331
And tell them to bring
a block and tackle.

1690
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:00,699
Who is it?

1691
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,635
Rudy Keppler. <i>Examiner.</i>

1692
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:03,797
Piss and vinegar.

1693
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:08,033
Duffy, keep this line open.
Don't you leave the phone again.

1694
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:15,307
It's a miracle. She only has
a concussion and a broken leg.

1695
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:16,351
Thank God.

1696
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:17,852
She's going to
Passavant Hospital.

1697
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,945
All the reporters have gone.
Should I go, too?

1698
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:21,319
No, we need you here.

1699
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,652
Oh, hello, Mr. Burns.

1700
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:23,783
You got that camera?

1701
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:24,848
Yes, sir, right here.

1702
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:25,916
Let's have it.

1703
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,019
Yes, sir.

1704
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,159
Earl, I need
a picture of you.

1705
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,067
Uh, I don't have one
on me.

1706
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,332
Oh, we're
gonna take it now.

1707
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:40,375
It's for the <i>Examiner</i>
tomorrow. Front page. Huh?

1708
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:41,603
Oh, really?

1709
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:42,666
Hey.

1710
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:44,438
You know who that is?

1711
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,777
Oh, shut up. And let's have
your collar, too.

1712
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:47,781
My collar?

1713
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,579
It's celluloid,
isn't it?

1714
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:52,519
Ha.

1715
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,259
I'm calling the Sheriff a hyena.
What do you like with it?

1716
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,855
Vile, corrupt,
unscrupulous, depraved?

1717
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,798
Yeah. And in that order.

1718
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,063
He can sue the paper
for a million dollars.

1719
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:10,628
Let him. We'll take
it out of your salary.

1720
01:15:10,773 --> 01:15:14,368
Here. When I say "now,"
drop this in there.

1721
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:15,501
Got it?

1722
01:15:15,578 --> 01:15:17,546
All right, Earl.
Ready?

1723
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,244
No, Earl. No smile.

1724
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:22,807
Give me that hunted look.

1725
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,944
Cowering,
fearful of every sound,

1726
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,683
of every footstep,
like an animal at bay.

1727
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:29,619
Hold it.

1728
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:32,652
Now!

1729
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:35,260
That's it.

1730
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:39,193
Take this over to the paper,
develop it immediately.

1731
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,702
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Mr. Williams.

1732
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:43,930
How're we coming?

1733
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:44,995
Beat it.

1734
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,376
What are you
gonna do with me now?

1735
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:50,844
Just trust me.

1736
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:55,613
Duffy, listen.

1737
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:57,481
We're gonna rip out
the whole front page.

1738
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,214
The kid's on his way
with a photograph.

1739
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:00,346
Wait till you see it.

1740
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,186
Hildy's knocking out
the story now.

1741
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:03,816
Yes, I said Hildy.

1742
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:15,061
He said
he'd be waiting.

1743
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:16,434
You want me to get him?

1744
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,406
Would you, please?
Third floor, pressroom.

1745
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,767
A newspaperman?
Don't tell me.

1746
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:25,177
Those guys, you pick them up
late at night,

1747
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,080
they pass out in the cab.
You schlep them upstairs,

1748
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,050
you undress them,
you put them to bed.

1749
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:32,178
When you go through
their pockets for the fare,

1750
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,119
they start yelling
for the cops.

1751
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,021
I schenk you newspapermen.

1752
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,219
Never mind.
I'll go myself.

1753
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,866
To hell with
the Nicaraguan earthquake.

1754
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,234
I don't care
if there's 100,000 dead.

1755
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:51,797
The League of Nations?
Spike it.

1756
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:54,604
No, no, no. Don't touch
Cdr. Byrd and the penguins,

1757
01:16:54,677 --> 01:16:55,974
that's human interest.

1758
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:59,173
Can I mention the Mayor's half interest
in that Chinese whorehouse?

1759
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:02,274
Pour it on, kiddo.
Below the belt, every punch.

1760
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:05,582
Duffy, has that delivery truck
left yet with the block and tackle?

1761
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:08,748
Well, goose them up.
God damn it, every minute counts!

1762
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:11,415
Hildy.

1763
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,451
Hildy.

1764
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,959
Jesus! People walk in
and out of here

1765
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,160
like it was
a Greyhound terminal.

1766
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,829
Uh, Peggy, I thought
you were picking up the bags.

1767
01:17:23,906 --> 01:17:25,464
I did. They're downstairs
in the cab.

1768
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:28,032
Oh, yeah? Well, we got plenty of time.
Sit down, honey.

1769
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,304
The Hoover speech?

1770
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:32,176
Shove it between the want ads
and the obituaries.

1771
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:35,479
Oh, this is the greatest thing
that ever happened to me in my life.

1772
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:37,075
Oh, I thought I was.

1773
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,485
I didn't mean it that way,
honey. Honey...

1774
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,885
What is this,
The Student Prince?

1775
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,448
We're working
against a deadline.

1776
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:45,926
So are we.

1777
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:47,426
Let's hear what you got.

1778
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,522
"While hundreds of Sheriff Hartman's
paid gunmen stalked through Chicago

1779
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,964
"shooting innocent bystanders,

1780
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,433
"spreading their reign
of terror,

1781
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,198
Earl Williams was lurking
less than 200 feet from the Sheriff's--"

1782
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:58,263
Hold it!
Aren't you gonna mention the <i>Examiner?</i>

1783
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,364
Don't we take any credit?

1784
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:00,601
It's in
the second paragraph.

1785
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,701
Who the hell's gonna read
the second paragraph?

1786
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,474
For 15 years I've been trying
to teach you how to write a lead.

1787
01:18:05,548 --> 01:18:07,038
Do I have to do
everything myself?

1788
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:08,378
Get the story? Write it?

1789
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:11,078
Listen, saphead,
I can blow a better story out of my...

1790
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:12,586
My nose
than you can write.

1791
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:15,283
Goddamn dilettante.
Maybe Philadelphia's where you belong,

1792
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,257
making up jingles
for Burma-shave.

1793
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:20,818
Oh, really? Well, who wrote the deathbed
confession of "Three-Finger" Banducci?

1794
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:22,523
Who wrote
Roxie Hart's diary, huh?

1795
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:23,997
What-- what about
the Dayton flood?

1796
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:25,693
Even the telegraph operator
was crying.

1797
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:27,235
All right, make me cry now.

1798
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:28,827
Someday you're
gonna do that, Walter,

1799
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,701
and I'm gonna sock you
right in the schnoz.

1800
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:32,866
You're beautiful
when you're angry.

1801
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:35,274
Duffy. Duffy?

1802
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:37,639
Duffy!

1803
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:41,080
That's what I get for hiring
somebody with a disease.

1804
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:45,319
I'm beginning to think
all newspapermen have a disease.

1805
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,333
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Now the moon is out.

1806
01:19:03,706 --> 01:19:06,436
This the sort of thing
you had in mind?

1807
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:09,734
<i>"The Chicago Examiner</i>
once again

1808
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:11,643
"rode to the rescue of
the city last night

1809
01:19:11,714 --> 01:19:13,238

Now you're cooking!

1814
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:22,523
How many words?
Give me everything you got.

1815
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,582
Because, with this,
you're stepping into a new class.

1816
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,821
Heywood Bruin. H.L. Mencken.

1817
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,900
Grafters and gangsters.

1818
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:37,661
Sin City:
Blood in the gutters.

1819
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,034
A rhapsody in red.

1820
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:41,972
Red. That's what we'll do.

1821
01:19:42,044 --> 01:19:43,409
The headline in red ink.

1822
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,810
180 point type?

1823
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,609
180 nothing, 360.

1824
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:49,610
It's like Lindbergh
landing in Paris.

1825
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,194
Cigarette me.

1826
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,849
Hildy, you don't really
want to give this up, do you?

1827
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:31,017
Deep down--

1828
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:33,823
Honey, please, not now.
I-I'm going good.

1829
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,562
Darling,
where are the tickets?

1830
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:45,436
Uh, right in there.

1831
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:51,774
I'm taking mine.
There's no use my sticking around.

1832
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,611
All righty. Go on down to the station.
Check the bags in.

1833
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,117
I-I'll get there.
Don't you worry.

1834
01:20:58,087 --> 01:20:59,645
Goodbye, Hildy.

1835
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:01,884
See you.

1836
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:12,657
I hope he saved the sales slip
for the wedding rings.

1837
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:15,533
No big deal.
They'll make nice cufflinks.

1838
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:33,845
Got enough air?

1839
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,085
Duffy? That kid show up yet
with the photo?

1840
01:21:41,163 --> 01:21:43,358
Well, I want it made up
into a four-column cut.

1841
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:45,525
Tell Max in circulation,
we're going for a million.

1842
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:50,371
Hey, open up in there.

1843
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,229
Oh, shit!

1844
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:53,331
Who's that?

1845
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,071
Bensinger. <i>Tribune.</i>
That's his desk.

1846
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:58,306
I'll handle this.
What did you say his name was?

1847
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,540
Bensinger.

1848
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:03,508
Kind of exclusive
aren't you, Johnson?

1849
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,916
Hello, Bensinger.

1850
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:06,477
Oh, Mr. Burns.

1851
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:09,513
It's quite an honor
having you here.

1852
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,819
You know my name?

1853
01:22:10,893 --> 01:22:12,258
Do I know his name?

1854
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,420
Hildy and I were
just talking about you.

1855
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:17,192
That was one swell story
you had in the <i>Tribune</i> this morning.

1856
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,064
Oh, thank you, Mr. Burns.
Did you care for the poem?

1857
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,330
The poem?
That's what made it.

1858
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,429
I'm rather proud
of the ending:

1859
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:26,940
"And all is well
outside his cell

1860
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:29,067
"But in his heart he hears

1861
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:31,806
"The hangman calling
And the gallows falling

1862
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,508
And his
white-haired mother's tears"

1863
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:39,251
A classic.

1864
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:42,349
Bensinger,
how would you like to work for me?

1865
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:43,448
You mean that, Mr. Burns?

1866
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:45,493
I'm not just
whistling Dixie.

1867
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:47,722
Duffy, I'm sending
Bensinger over to see you.

1868
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:48,922
Marvin, isn't it?

1869
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,624
Oh, no, no. Roy. Roy V.

1870
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,634
You sure?
Roy Bensinger, the poet.

1871
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:54,930
Put him right
on the staff.

1872
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,527
How much you getting
at the <i>Tribune?</i>

1873
01:22:56,605 --> 01:22:57,697
$75.

1874
01:22:57,773 --> 01:23:00,003
Give him $100
and a by-line.

1875
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,338
Is that truck on
the way over yet? Good.

1876
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:05,539
They're coming to pick up your desk.
My desk?

1877
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:08,708
Ah, you shouldn't be working a police
beat. I want you right at my elbow.

1878
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:10,843
Now, get over to the office
and report to Duffy.

1879
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:12,045
You mean, right now?

1880
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,213
Oh, I couldn't quit
the <i>Tribune</i> just like that.

1881
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,551
It wouldn't be ethical.

1882
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:17,615
You don't owe them
a damn thing.

1883
01:23:17,693 --> 01:23:19,820
Well, they have been
treating me rather shabbily.

1884
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:22,591
The way they edit my copy.
They just butcher it.

1885
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,531
On the <i>Examiner,</i>
your copy will be sacred.

1886
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:29,827
Sacred. Sacred.

1887
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:32,370
Roy, here's
your first assignment.

1888
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:35,239
I want you to make up
a prayer for the city of Chicago.

1889
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,278
We'll carry it
on the editorial page.

1890
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,678
"Our Father,
who art in Heaven,

1891
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:43,878
last year there were
421 unsolved murders..."

1892
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:45,519
All set up
in boldface Gothic.

1893
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:47,418
Okay. I'll just get
my rhyming dictionary.

1894
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,514
It doesn't
have to rhyme.

1895
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:53,558
Just give me the Goddamndest prayer
anybody ever heard.

1896
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:55,426
You want it Old Testament
or New Testament?

1897
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:57,431
Let's have it between
the Sermon on the Mount

1898
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:58,830
and the 23rd Psalm.

1899
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:00,801
That's easy.

1900
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:07,308
Duffy, that <i>Tribune</i> sneak
is on the way over.

1901
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:08,365
Yeah, Bensinger.

1902
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:11,071
Wait till he hands in his copy,
then tell him his prayer stinks,

1903
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,671
and kick him down the stairs.

1904
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:17,782
"His white-haired mother's tears,"
for Christ's sake.

1905
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:22,113
Where do you want these,
Mr. Johnson?

1906
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,418
Any place.

1907
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:24,959
The lady said--
All right.

1908
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:26,961
Those are my bags.
What are they doing here?

1909
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:29,190
The lady sent them up.
Peggy?

1910
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:30,288
Oh, I don't know her name,

1911
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:32,595
but she sure was crying
when that taxi drove off.

1912
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:33,635
Okay. Okay.

1913
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:34,896
Crying?
What did I do wrong?

1914
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,632
Nothing. Those were
tears of happiness.

1915
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:39,833
She had a narrow escape
and so did you.

1916
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,500
Well, I don't
want to escape.

1917
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,272
I'm nuts about her.
I want to marry her.

1918
01:24:43,345 --> 01:24:45,836
But I wouldn't expect you
to understand a thing like that.

1919
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,575
Don't tell me about women.

1920
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:50,117
That dame in Waukegan
chopped up her husband

1921
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:52,278
and flushed him down the drain
on their honeymoon.

1922
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:53,878
He was nuts about her, too.

1923
01:24:53,956 --> 01:24:55,218
And that Mrs. Haggerty.

1924
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:58,487
Knocked off six husbands by sprinkling
arsenic on their prune whip.

1925
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,118
That's marriage for you.

1926
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,095
You think
you got it made?

1927
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,331
No home, no family,
no friends.

1928
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,094
Eating cold beans
outta tin cans,

1929
01:25:06,168 --> 01:25:08,398
sleepin' on your office couch
five nights a week.

1930
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:11,371
The only time you ever get it up
is when you put the paper to bed.

1931
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,873
All right,
you've had a nice rest.

1932
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,307
Now put down that fairy wand
and get back to work.

1933
01:25:15,377 --> 01:25:16,469
Goodbye, Walter.

1934
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:18,103
Hildy, this is desertion.

1935
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,375
If you were in the Army,
you could be shot for this.

1936
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,848
Get out of my way!

1937
01:25:23,185 --> 01:25:26,052
Not so fast, Johnson.
Where do you think you're going?

1938
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,180
To the station,
to meet my fiancee.

1939
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,656
Your fiancee, huh?
What's her name, Earl Williams?

1940
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:31,818
Earl Williams?
You're crazy.

1941
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:32,882
Hang onto him.

1942
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,155
He and Mollie
are in cahoots.

1943
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,389
Now his boss shows up.

1944
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,091
There's something
fishy going on here.

1945
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:39,963
Okay, Johnson.
What are you two cooking up?

1946
01:25:40,035 --> 01:25:42,936
Hartman,
you've got any questions,

1947
01:25:43,005 --> 01:25:44,768
address them directly to me.

1948
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:48,535
All right, Burns.
What are you doing here?

1949
01:25:48,677 --> 01:25:51,874
None of your
goddamn business.

1950
01:25:51,947 --> 01:25:53,744
Ever hear
of the First Amendment?

1951
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,342
Guarantees freedom
of the press and the pressroom.

1952
01:25:57,419 --> 01:25:59,319
I must ask you to leave.

1953
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:00,655
You what?

1954
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,155
Or I'll have you arrested.

1955
01:26:02,224 --> 01:26:03,282
Don't let him
bluff you.

1956
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:04,382
Show him
who's in charge.

1957
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:06,154
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm in charge here.

1958
01:26:06,228 --> 01:26:08,628
I don't care what kind
of a hotshot editor you are, Burns,

1959
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:10,494
I can have you
barred from this building.

1960
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:11,589
That's right.
You can.

1961
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,601
Why don't you throw us out?
Both of us.

1962
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:15,500
Oh, no. Nobody's leaving

1963
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,162
until I get to
the bottom of this.

1964
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:20,265
Will you give me a break?
My girl's gonna leave without me.

1965
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,276
Now let go of me,
God damn it.

1966
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:25,177
Watch out. Watch out,
he's got a gun.

1967
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,440
I'll take it.

1968
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:30,178
Hopalong Johnson.
The Drugstore Cowboy.

1969
01:26:30,252 --> 01:26:31,276
Where'd you get this?

1970
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:33,321
I got a right to carry a gun
if I want to.

1971
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:34,787
Not this gun.

1972
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,346
I can explain that.

1973
01:26:36,425 --> 01:26:38,825
He was doing a piece
on the Abadaba gang,

1974
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:40,794
and I gave it to him
for self-protection.

1975
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,956
Oh, yeah?
That's very interesting.

1976
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:45,463
This happens to be the gun

1977
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,525
that Earl Williams
shot his way out with.

1978
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,661
Are you trying to
make me out a liar?

1979
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:52,036
I know my own gun
when I see it!

1980
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:57,708
Your gun?
So that's it.

1981
01:26:57,779 --> 01:26:59,508
I knew something stunk here.
How come?

1982
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,549
What's the story?
Never mind that.

1983
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,846
Where's Earl Williams.
Where have you got him?

1984
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:06,911
Are you implying that the <i>Examiner</i>
would aid and abet a criminal?

1985
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,615
You're darn tootin'.

1986
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:11,090
Don't you know what it says
on our masthead,

1987
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,820
right under the eagle?

1988
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,488
"The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."

1989
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,690
Don't listen to that.

1990
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:18,027
They're playin' us
for suckers.

1991
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,158
Give them
the third degree.

1992
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,099
Leave it to me, boys.

1993
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:26,138
Johnson, if you're in such
a goddamn hurry, I'll make you a deal.

1994
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,768
You tell me where Williams is
and I'll let you go.

1995
01:27:28,844 --> 01:27:29,833
Okay, it's a deal.

1996
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:30,843
Where is he?

1997
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,903
He went to the hospital
to see Dr. Eggelhofer.

1998
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:34,676
What?
With a bag of marshmallows.

1999
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,342
Oh, for Christ's sake.

2000
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:38,817
Wise guy.

2001
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:42,256
Hartman, you're a disgrace
to your badge.

2002
01:27:42,324 --> 01:27:43,552
There's a killer on the loose,

2003
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,252
and you're harassing
innocent citizens.

2004
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,793
Excuse me.

2005
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:50,626
Don't touch that!

2006
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,756
I'll answer it.

2007
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:55,800
It may be Earl Williams.

2008
01:27:55,871 --> 01:27:58,032
I'll lay you
6-to-5 on that.

2009
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,674
Hello? Who?

2010
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:04,071
Yes,
this is Walter Burns.

2011
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:07,144
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Burns, but I have some bad news.

2012
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:09,809
The photograph,
I'm afraid it didn't come out.

2013
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:12,149
Maybe the film was
a little damp.

2014
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:14,114
What photograph?

2015
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:16,283
Of Earl Williams?

2016
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,615
The one I took?

2017
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:20,187
Where?

2018
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:22,660
God damn it, don't tell me
I should know.

2019
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:24,460
Just remind me.

2020
01:28:27,102 --> 01:28:28,399
That does it, Burns.

2021
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,961
It's against the law
to impersonate a managing editor.

2022
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,132
I'll give you 10 seconds
to hand over Earl Williams.

2023
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:34,470
You can't even
count to 10.

2024
01:28:34,543 --> 01:28:35,669
Damn it!

2025
01:28:35,744 --> 01:28:37,837
I know he's
around here someplace.

2026
01:28:39,948 --> 01:28:41,142
Aha!

2027
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:45,712
Where did this
come from?

2028
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:46,845
How the hell
would I know?

2029
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:48,412
Does it belong
to Earl Williams?

2030
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,321
Why don't you put
an ad in the classifieds?

2031
01:28:50,392 --> 01:28:52,553
Maybe he'll come around
to claim it.

2032
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:55,189
By God!
I'll find him,

2033
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:58,460
if I have to tear
this place apart brick by brick.

2034
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:13,904
Hi, Mr. Burns,
we got the truck here.

2035
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:15,844
Not now, Butch.
Go away.

2036
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:17,407
Wait a minute.

2037
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,377
What are you fellas
here for?

2038
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:21,388
We're supposed to
pick up somethin'.

2039
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:22,354
Is that so?

2040
01:29:23,425 --> 01:29:25,086
Well, now we're
getting someplace.

2041
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,651
What were you
supposed to pick up?

2042
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:30,391
I don't know.
Mr. Burns was gonna tell us.

2043
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,491
All right, Mr. Burns.
Go ahead, tell him.

2044
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:38,403
Sure. Boys,
take those two suitcases

2045
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:40,907
down to the truck
and wait for me.

2046
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:42,737
Here you are, fellas.

2047
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:44,540
Who are you kiddin', Burns?

2048
01:29:44,613 --> 01:29:47,480
Five guys and a truck
to pick up two suitcases?

2049
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,881
Go fight
the Teamsters' Union.

2050
01:29:50,352 --> 01:29:52,513
Forget it, Moe!
We won't need it.

2051
01:29:56,925 --> 01:30:00,656
God damn it to hell. I want to know
what's going on around here,

2052
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:03,323
if I have to beat it
out of you with a rubber hose!

2053
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,390
Hartman, you're through.
You're all washed up.

2054
01:30:07,202 --> 01:30:08,134
Who says so?

2055
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:09,135
The voters.

2056
01:30:09,204 --> 01:30:12,605
Come Tuesday, they're gonna kick you out
on your big fat can.

2057
01:30:12,674 --> 01:30:15,734
You'll be sellin' pencils
at the corner of State and Lake

2058
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:18,244
if you can get a permit
from the new sheriff.

2059
01:30:18,847 --> 01:30:21,247
Why is everybody
ganging up on me?

2060
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,517
The Mayor wants to
take me off the ticket.

2061
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:25,450
My wife isn't
speaking to me.

2062
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,715
I got a gallows out there
going to waste.

2063
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:29,757
I haven't eaten a thing
all day.

2064
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:31,257
It's just not fair.

2065
01:30:31,326 --> 01:30:34,420
Please. Please tell me
where Earl Williams is.

2066
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:37,293
I'm the law. You gotta
have a little respect.

2067
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:38,923
Pull yourself together,
Hartman.

2068
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,126
Don't you understand?

2069
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:41,793
The Bolsheviks
are everywhere!

2070
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:43,394
They're taking over!

2071
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:45,803
They're coming out
of the sewers like rats.

2072
01:30:45,874 --> 01:30:47,637
Climbing up our flagpole

2073
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:51,406
and gnawing away
at our Stars and Stripes!

2074
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:54,047
Better get him
a straightjacket.

2075
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:55,673
What'd you say?

2076
01:30:56,251 --> 01:30:58,048
You ought to be
put away, Hartman,

2077
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:00,314
'cause you're sick,
sick, sick.

2078
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,218
You'll be sorry
when I'm gone.

2079
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,486
And you won't have anybody
to kick around anymore.

2080
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,327
What's that?

2081
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:09,294
What's what?

2082
01:31:09,364 --> 01:31:10,422
Holy God!
He's in there.

2083
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:11,487
It's Williams.

2084
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:12,590
He's in the desk.

2085
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:15,727
Stand back, everybody!
Get your guns!

2086
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:17,203
Dumb commie schmuck.

2087
01:31:17,272 --> 01:31:19,069
City desk.
Don't take any chances.

2088
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,129
Hurry it up.

2089
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,505
We're dealing
with a wild animal.

2090
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:22,804
Shoot right through
the desk!

2091
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:25,072
For God's sake, he's harmless.
You've got his gun.

2092
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:26,443
Aim right
at the center!

2093
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:27,674
That's cold-blooded murder.

2094
01:31:27,749 --> 01:31:30,684
Pete, I'm warning you.
There's witnesses here.

2095
01:31:30,752 --> 01:31:32,549
Williams,
we got you covered.

2096
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,349
I'm gonna count
to three.

2097
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:37,585
Open up or we'll blast you!
One...

2098
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,251
Stand by.
Any second now.

2099
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,692
Two...
Hold on.

2100
01:31:40,762 --> 01:31:41,922
Coming right up.

2101
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,225
Three!

2102
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,338
All right, Williams.
No funny business.

2103
01:31:55,477 --> 01:31:57,138
Just come on out.

2104
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:04,379
I can't. I can't.
My legs are asleep.

2105
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:05,885
Grab him, boys!

2106
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:07,989
Hey, hey, easy.
Easy, now.

2107
01:32:08,056 --> 01:32:11,082
Earl Williams was captured in
the Criminal Courts Building

2108
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:12,183
hiding in a desk.

2109
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,820
He put up a desperate struggle,
but he was overpowered.

2110
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:17,330
He tried to shoot it out with the cops,
but his gun jammed.

2111
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:19,424
Williams was betrayed
by an old sweetheart,

2112
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:21,696
who then attempted suicide.

2113
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,795
Duffy, take this down.
The <i>Examiner,</i>

2114
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,863
guardian and conscience
of Chicago

2115
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:28,340
having single-handedly
captured Earl Williams

2116
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:31,675
has just handed him over
to Sheriff what's-his-name.

2117
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:39,180
Now then,
the hanging will go on as scheduled,

2118
01:32:39,254 --> 01:32:41,381
7:00 a.m. sharp.

2119
01:32:41,456 --> 01:32:43,219
Take him away, boys.

2120
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:44,751
Goodbye, Earl.

2121
01:32:44,826 --> 01:32:45,918
Tell Mollie not to cry.

2122
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:49,259
Those 13 steps,
they don't lead up to the gallows.

2123
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,093
They lead up to the stars.

2124
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,796
That's it, Hildy!

2125
01:32:57,939 --> 01:33:00,032
Not to the gallows,
but up to the stars.

2126
01:33:00,108 --> 01:33:02,042
There's your last words.

2127
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:04,704
And on the front page,
we'll have a composite picture.

2128
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:08,146
The stars, the steps, and at the top
of the steps, Marx and Lenin

2129
01:33:08,216 --> 01:33:10,616
waiting for Earl Williams.
How's that?

2130
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:12,084
Just dandy.

2131
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:14,483
Put the handcuffs on them.

2132
01:33:14,823 --> 01:33:15,812
My pleasure.

2133
01:33:16,858 --> 01:33:18,018
What's the charge?

2134
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:20,027
Conspiracy
to obstruct justice,

2135
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:23,087
harboring a fugitive,
possession of a stolen weapon

2136
01:33:23,164 --> 01:33:25,496
adds up to about
10 years apiece for you birds.

2137
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:27,467
Operator,
get me Clarence Darrow.

2138
01:33:29,504 --> 01:33:32,268
Not even Houdini
can get you out of this.

2139
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:34,736
Now, listen,
you pimple head,

2140
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:36,970
when I finish with you,
you'll wish you were never born.

2141
01:33:37,045 --> 01:33:38,672
We'll butter the town
with your brains.

2142
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:40,145
Whistling
in the dark, huh?

2143
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:41,944
We've been in
tighter spots than this.

2144
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:44,246
Remember that minister
who had us thrown into jail?

2145
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:45,786
Rev. Godolphin.
Because we printed

2146
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:47,788
he conducted sex orgies
in the organ loft.

2147
01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:50,188
Well, on the day of the trial,
he was on his way to court

2148
01:33:50,258 --> 01:33:52,624
with all his lawyers
and witnesses.

2149
01:33:52,694 --> 01:33:55,288
Drowned, by God,
drowned in the river.

2150
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:58,799
With their automobile and their law books
and their goddamn affidavits.

2151
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:00,562
And I have
the same feeling right now

2152
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,296
that I had
before that accident.

2153
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:05,066
You don't scare me, Burns.
Lock them up.

2154
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:07,070
Well, I--

2155
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:09,601
Honey, get me extension 361.

2156
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:12,441
I tell you, Hartman,
there's a divine providence

2157
01:34:12,514 --> 01:34:14,243
that watches over
the <i>Examiner.</i>

2158
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:15,748
An unseen power.

2159
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:16,943
Out!

2160
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:19,618
What did you say, honey?

2161
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,018
That's impossible.

2162
01:34:21,089 --> 01:34:22,920
There's gotta be
somebody there.

2163
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,049
It's the jail.

2164
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:27,387
# Swing low, sweet chariot #

2165
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:30,954
# Coming for
to carry me home #

2166
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:34,932
# Swing low, sweet chariot #

2167
01:34:35,737 --> 01:34:38,262
# Coming for
to carry me home #

2168
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:40,739
# I looked over Jordan #

2169
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:42,503
# And what did I see #

2170
01:34:42,577 --> 01:34:45,410
# Coming for
to carry me home ##

2171
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:49,272
Hey, knock it off,
will you?

2172
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,578
What time have you got?

2173
01:34:50,652 --> 01:34:51,778
11:40.

2174
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:53,445
Where the hell's Duffy
with the bail?

2175
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:56,354
You have mixed up my whole life,
that's what you've done.

2176
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:58,551
Who me?
What a horse's ass I turned out to be.

2177
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,253
Falling for a song
and dance like that.

2178
01:35:00,328 --> 01:35:02,455
They'll be namin' streets
after me.

2179
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:05,890
I'll never meet another girl like that.
She was one in a million.

2180
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:07,958
I didn't know
it was anything that serious.

2181
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,094
Why didn't you tell me?

2182
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,330
Why didn't I tell you?

2183
01:35:10,405 --> 01:35:12,396
I'd be the last person
in the world

2184
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:14,168
to stand in the way
of your happiness.

2185
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:15,607
Oh, you hypocritical,
dirty...

2186
01:35:15,677 --> 01:35:17,008
Now that it's too late.

2187
01:35:17,078 --> 01:35:19,444
It's never too late, kid,
because somebody up there--

2188
01:35:19,514 --> 01:35:22,540
Don't give me that
unseen power crap!

2189
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:50,544
You're making
a big mistake, officer.

2190
01:35:50,612 --> 01:35:53,137
The Mayor is
a personal friend of mine.

2191
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:54,146
Sure he is.

2192
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:56,740
He's even let me
use his chopsticks.

2193
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:58,848
Get in there.

2194
01:36:00,822 --> 01:36:02,722
It was my one chance

2195
01:36:02,824 --> 01:36:05,315
to get out of this rat race
and lead a normal life.

2196
01:36:05,393 --> 01:36:07,793
By this time tomorrow,
I could've been a gentleman.

2197
01:36:07,862 --> 01:36:10,126
Now, instead of Philadelphia,
I'm going to Joliet.

2198
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:13,031
What Joliet? In the first place,
they'll never indict us.

2199
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:15,194
In the second place,
no jury'll ever convict us.

2200
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:18,364
In the third place, we can always
get a reprieve from the governor.

2201
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,498
With all the dirt
I've got on every big shot--

2202
01:36:20,575 --> 01:36:21,803
Funny you should
mention that.

2203
01:36:21,876 --> 01:36:22,843
Mention what?

2204
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,207
A reprieve
from the governor.

2205
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:26,679
I just happen
to have one on me.

2206
01:36:26,748 --> 01:36:28,613
Get out of here,
you're drunk.

2207
01:36:28,683 --> 01:36:31,379
Oh, I'll say. I was at this
Chinese place.

2208
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:32,612
The Mayor
sent me there.

2209
01:36:32,687 --> 01:36:33,984
You know the Mayor, too?

2210
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:35,716
Oh, sure.
And the sheriff.

2211
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,554
Of course, I don't know them
as well as I know the governor.

2212
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:41,720
Wait a minute. If you've got a reprieve,
how come you're in jail?

2213
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,388
Oh, it's not for me.

2214
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,431
It isn't?

2215
01:36:44,499 --> 01:36:46,797
You see, I came down
from Springfield.

2216
01:36:46,868 --> 01:36:48,665
Plunkett's the name.

2217
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,133
Proud of you, Pete.
You did a terrific job.

2218
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:55,971
All in a night's work,
Your Honor.

2219
01:36:56,044 --> 01:36:57,944
You can call me Herbie,
again.

2220
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,511
Hey, look who's here.

2221
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:00,808
The Green Hornet.

2222
01:37:00,882 --> 01:37:02,213
Hi, Horny.

2223
01:37:04,552 --> 01:37:06,213
What are those girls
doing here?

2224
01:37:06,287 --> 01:37:07,914
The Chink broads?
We just raided them.

2225
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:09,013
On whose orders?

2226
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:11,558
We always knock over
a few cathouses before election.

2227
01:37:11,626 --> 01:37:14,288
You know that.
To get the family vote.

2228
01:37:14,462 --> 01:37:15,588
Nice work.

2229
01:37:15,697 --> 01:37:17,392
Thank you, Herbie.

2230
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:25,602
Here they are. Look kinda natural,
don't they, behind bars?

2231
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,607
A sight for sore eyes.

2232
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,165
I reckon you boys
are gonna be

2233
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:31,040
away from Chicago
for a long time.

2234
01:37:31,112 --> 01:37:33,672
Yeah. Making brooms
and license plates.

2235
01:37:35,383 --> 01:37:39,376
Maybe I can fix it for you
to work on a prison paper as copyboys.

2236
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:42,679
Hot in here,
isn't it, Hildy?

2237
01:37:42,757 --> 01:37:45,988
Yeah. Why don't you
put in some fans or ventilators?

2238
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,687
How about
an air-conditioning system?

2239
01:37:47,762 --> 01:37:49,855
Scented with pine needles.

2240
01:37:49,931 --> 01:37:51,057
Suit yourself.

2241
01:37:51,132 --> 01:37:53,828
Because tomorrow,
you guys are gonna be in this cell.

2242
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:55,095
Big joke.

2243
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,296
Yeah. We were just laughing
about it,

2244
01:37:57,372 --> 01:37:59,602
with our friend,
Mr. Plunkett.

2245
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:01,372
Plunkett?

2246
01:38:01,509 --> 01:38:03,841
Hiya, Mayor.
Hiya, Sheriff.

2247
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,640
Who is this man?

2248
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,341
Never saw him before
in my life.

2249
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:10,350
I suppose you never
saw this before, either?

2250
01:38:10,418 --> 01:38:11,442
What is it?

2251
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:12,679
A reprieve
for Earl Williams.

2252
01:38:12,754 --> 01:38:15,587
Hangin' a man
just to win an election, huh?

2253
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:17,284
Why, that's absurd.

2254
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:20,293
I don't know what you're
talking about. Do we, Herbie?

2255
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:22,261
Oh, such big liars.

2256
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:23,695
Let me see that.

2257
01:38:23,765 --> 01:38:25,665
If Williams has
been reprieved,

2258
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,098
I personally am
tickled to death.

2259
01:38:27,168 --> 01:38:30,604
Go on. You'd hang your own mother
for a couple of lousy votes.

2260
01:38:30,671 --> 01:38:33,401
That's a terrible thing
to say, Burns, about anybody.

2261
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:35,999
Sheriff, this document
is authentic.

2262
01:38:36,477 --> 01:38:38,570
Earl Williams, thank God,
has been reprieved.

2263
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:40,580
The commonwealth
of Chicago has been spared

2264
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:42,411
the necessity
of taking a human life.

2265
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:43,882
Save that for the <i>Tribune.</i>

2266
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,816
Pete, I want you
to release my friends,

2267
01:38:45,887 --> 01:38:47,718
Walter Burns
and Hildy Johnson.

2268
01:38:47,789 --> 01:38:50,189
I was about to.
They're my friends, too.

2269
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:51,486
Jacobi.

2270
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:53,554
Open up.

2271
01:38:54,796 --> 01:38:56,559
Don't be too hard
on Pete, boys.

2272
01:38:56,631 --> 01:38:58,326
He gets a little
over zealous sometimes.

2273
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:00,424
You goddamn hoodoo.

2274
01:39:00,735 --> 01:39:02,965
What did I tell you?
An unseen power.

2275
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:05,096
Oh, yeah. Except by now,
I've missed the train.

2276
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:06,902
No. Mayor, here's
what I want you to do.

2277
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:07,906
Anything.

2278
01:39:07,975 --> 01:39:10,273
There's a train leaving
at midnight for Philadelphia.

2279
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,312
Have them hold it for 10 minutes.
Got it.

2280
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:13,904
As for you, Sheriff.
You've got it.

2281
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:16,142
We need a police escort
to take Hildy to Union Station.

2282
01:39:16,217 --> 01:39:18,549
How many do you want?
I have 200 men.

2283
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,052
Hey, what about me?

2284
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,214
Shut up,
you goddamn hoodoo!

2285
01:39:23,491 --> 01:39:24,515
Hoodoo?

2286
01:40:04,799 --> 01:40:07,131
Hildy. Hildy, you can't
walk out on us.

2287
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:08,896
You can't leave
your family. I need you.

2288
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:10,164
The children need you.

2289
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:11,364
Daddy! Daddy!

2290
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:12,633
What the hell?

2291
01:40:12,707 --> 01:40:15,005
All right, Myrtle.
That's enough. Can it.

2292
01:40:15,076 --> 01:40:17,567
What's the matter, Mr. Burns?
Didn't I do it right?

2293
01:40:17,645 --> 01:40:19,340
You were perfect.
Here's $5.

2294
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,404
Split it between you.
Bye.

2295
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:24,041
What was that
all about?

2296
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:25,949
Just a little somethin'
I had up my sleeve

2297
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,147
in case of a tie,
but it's not necessary now.

2298
01:40:28,222 --> 01:40:29,450
Aha.

2299
01:40:59,353 --> 01:41:01,082
Well, goodbye,
Johnson.

2300
01:41:01,155 --> 01:41:02,622
Take good care of him,
Peggy.

2301
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:04,089
You're getting
a great guy.

2302
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:05,819
Never mind the Valentine.

2303
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:07,793
You may not like
what I'm going to say

2304
01:41:07,862 --> 01:41:10,456
but I don't believe you're as tough as
you pretend to be.

2305
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:12,556
Underneath it all,
I think you're a real softie.

2306
01:41:13,768 --> 01:41:15,429
Well, don't let it
get around.

2307
01:41:15,503 --> 01:41:17,403
You crazy bastard.

2308
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:18,995
We'll sure miss you
on the paper.

2309
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:21,940
Well, if I ever come back
to the business, which I won't,

2310
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:24,477
there's only one man I'd ever work for.
You know that.

2311
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:26,809
I'd kill you if you ever worked
for anybody else.

2312
01:41:26,881 --> 01:41:28,815
Hear that, Peggy?
That's my diploma.

2313
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:30,544
All aboard!

2314
01:41:32,987 --> 01:41:36,388
Wish I had time to get you
a wedding present. I know!

2315
01:41:36,857 --> 01:41:38,654
What? Walter,
I couldn't take it.

2316
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:39,658
I insist.

2317
01:41:39,727 --> 01:41:42,594
It was a present from
the big chief himself.

2318
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:44,563
And if you look
on the inside

2319
01:41:44,632 --> 01:41:46,497
you'll find
a little inscription:

2320
01:41:46,567 --> 01:41:48,865
"To the best newspaperman
I know."

2321
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:50,096
When you get to
Philadelphia,

2322
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:53,197
you can have my name scratched out
and put yours in its place.

2323
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:54,798
You know
I wouldn't do that.

2324
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,365
Goodbye, Mr. Burns.

2325
01:41:57,645 --> 01:41:59,613
Best of luck,
you love birds!

2326
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,580
Goodbye, you big palooka.

2327
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:31,275
That train that just left.

2328
01:42:31,412 --> 01:42:33,312
What's the first stop?

2329
01:42:33,381 --> 01:42:35,144
Gary, Indiana.

2330
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:39,514
All right. Send a message
to the police chief of Gary, Indiana.

2331
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:43,056
Tell them to meet
the midnight train to Philadelphia

2332
01:42:43,124 --> 01:42:45,319
and arrest one Hildy Johnson.

2333
01:42:46,027 --> 01:42:47,153
Hildy Johnson?

2334
01:42:47,228 --> 01:42:48,320
Yeah.

2335
01:42:48,396 --> 01:42:50,660
Son of a bitch
stole my watch.
