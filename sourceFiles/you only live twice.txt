1
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,625
Calling Cape Cod. Cape Cod?

2
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:49,544
This is Jupiter 16.

3
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:51,587
Can you give a go for fourth orbit?

4
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:53,506
Cape Cod to Jupiter 16.

5
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,509
Can you confirm 02 pressure
is within limit?

6
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:59,971
Roger. It all looks good
in the environmental control system.

7
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:03,516
OK.
Everything looks good from here.

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,935
You have a go for fourth orbit.

9
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,104
Jupiter 16. Roger.

10
00:01:08,897 --> 00:01:11,441
You're stowing all loose gear.
Ready for the EVA.

11
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:13,109
Jupiter 16, this is Cape Cod.

12
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:15,027
Start your EVA when you're ready.

13
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:17,780
You have time in the other EVAs
for experiments.

14
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:20,199
So don't stay out too long, Chris.

15
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:21,409
OK, flight.

16
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:24,662
- Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.
- Roger.

17
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:29,292
Cape Cod to Jupiter 16. On my mark
it will be four plus three seven.

18
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:32,378
Four, three, two,

19
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,714
one, mark.

20
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:44,348
Cape Cod, this is Chris.

21
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:45,558
I'm out.

22
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:47,977
Everything looks OK.

23
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:49,270
Good.

24
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:51,397
The manoeuvring unit
works this time.

25
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:54,066
I used it to get out.
It makes things a lot easier.

26
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:57,695
Cape Cod to Hawaii,
this is flight control, come in.

27
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:59,238
Hawaii, roger.

28
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:03,075
Hawaii, we expect to start EVA
over your station on this pass.

29
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,827
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

30
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:08,581
An unidentified object is closing on you
fast from astern.

31
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:10,041
Can you see it?

32
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:14,462
Hawaii, we have nothing here.
Hold while we check the space track.

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,173
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

34
00:02:17,424 --> 00:02:20,801
Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

35
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:23,095
An unidentified object is on our scope.

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,306
We see nothing.

37
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:28,434
Can you give me a bearing?

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,186
Appears to be coming up fast

39
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,812
from astern.

40
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:34,273
Hey, now I see it.

41
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:37,777
It's another spacecraft!

42
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,862
Repeat, it's another spacecraft!

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,740
Does it looks like a close pass?

44
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,700
You're breaking up. Say again.

45
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:47,870
- Does it look like a close pass?
- Chris, what's happening?

46
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:51,332
It's coming right at us.
The front is opening up!

47
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,335
I repeat, the front is opening up!

48
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:59,549
- It's coming right at us.
- Chris, get back in, get back in!

49
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,635
Do you read me? You're breaking up.

50
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,470
- Repeat, you're breaking up.
- What's happening?

51
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,848
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

52
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,476
Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Are you receiving?

53
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:13,479
You're breaking up. Come in, please.
Jupiter 16!

54
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:15,273
You're breaking up...

55
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,824
My lead line! It's cu...

56
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:30,079
Hawaii to Jupiter 16, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.

57
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:33,249
Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.

58
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,500
Hello, Houston.

59
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:37,962
We've lost radio contact.
We've also lost him on the scope.

60
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,590
Unidentified object is still orbiting.

61
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,967
Alert all stations and track him closely.

62
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,439
It is ridiculous for the Soviet government
to deny responsibility.

63
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:59,817
The Soviet government denies
all knowledge of this affair.

64
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:02,695
The world knows
we are a peace-loving people.

65
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,615
I hereby give notice that in 20 days

66
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,909
the United States
will launch her next spaceship.

67
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:11,454
My government has instructed me
to inform you

68
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:15,791
that any interference with it
will be regarded as an act of war.

69
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,543
May I ask what motive

70
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:19,962
our Russian friends would have

71
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:22,340
for wishing to destroy
American spacecraft?

72
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:25,885
My government sees this
as a blatant attempt

73
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:30,473
to gain complete and absolute control
of space itself for military purposes.

74
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:32,224
We don't agree.

75
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,311
Her Majesty's Government
is not convinced

76
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:38,648
that this intruder missile
originated from Soviet Russia.

77
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,858
Our tracking station in Singapore

78
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:45,154
reported faint echoes of this craft
coming down in the Sea of Japan area.

79
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:48,532
Might I suggest
that this is where you should

80
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:50,785
concentrate your intelligence forces?

81
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:55,206
The prime minister asked me to assure
you this is what we propose to do.

82
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,459
As a matter of fact, our man in Hong Kong
is working on it now.

83
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,388
Why do Chinese girls taste different
from all other girls?

84
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:12,473
You think we better, huh?

85
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:14,517
No, just different.

86
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,435
Like Peking duck is different from

87
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,688
Russian caviar, but I love 'em both.

88
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:21,023
Darling, I give you very best duck.

89
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:23,275
That would be lovely.

90
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:27,279
We've had some interesting times
together, Ling. I'll be sorry to go.

91
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,971
Take that door.

92
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:54,056
The bed!

93
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:04,650
- We're too late.
- Well, at least he died on the job.

94
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,027
He'd have wanted it this way.

95
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:37,683
You only live twice

96
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:43,189
Or so it seems

97
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,942
One life for yourself

98
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:54,074
And one for your dreams

99
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:59,455
You drift through the years

100
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:05,795
And life seems tame

101
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,631
Till one dream appears

102
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:14,303
And love is its name

103
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:20,893
And love is a stranger

104
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:27,149
Who'll beckon you on

105
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:31,070
Don't think of the danger

106
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:36,575
Or the stranger is gone

107
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:42,081
This dream is for you

108
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:47,419
So pay the price

109
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:51,131
Make one dream come true

110
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:56,303
You only live twice

111
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:03,018
And love is a stranger

112
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,107
Who'll beckon you on

113
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:12,862
Don't think of the danger

114
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:18,576
Or the stranger is gone

115
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,831
This dream is for you

116
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:28,878
So pay the price

117
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:32,715
Make one dream come true

118
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,804
You only live twice

119
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:19,845
We shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed

120
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,806
in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye,

121
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,642
at the last trump.

122
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:28,228
For the trumpet shall sound and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible,

123
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:30,314
and we shall all be changed.

124
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:34,276
We therefore commit his body to the deep
to be turned into corruption,

125
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:38,781
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead.

126
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:41,533
Present!

127
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:50,876
Fire!

128
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,366
- Carry on.
- Aye aye, sir.

129
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,929
Permission to come aboard?

130
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:28,182
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.

131
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,978
- Take this officer aft.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:41,528
Number One, take her up to 90ft.
Course zero four five.

133
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:43,614
Aye aye, sir.

134
00:11:49,162 --> 00:11:51,830
- Hello, Penny.
- You'd better go right in.

135
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:54,541
You're late as usual,
even from your own funeral.

136
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,585
We corpses have no sense of timing.

137
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:00,464
In you go... sir.

138
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:02,549
Thank you... ma'am.

139
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:15,979
- Oh, sit down, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

140
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,191
- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.

141
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:24,279
Now you're dead, perhaps some of your
old friends will pay less attention to you.

142
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:28,450
Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it, too.

143
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:32,996
This is the big one, 007. That's why
I'm out here. You're fully briefed?

144
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,083
Yes, but there's one thing
I don't understand.

145
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,293
If our Singapore tracking
station is correct

146
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:41,755
about the rocket not landing
in Russia, where did it land?

147
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,801
We assume it's Japan.
All this is guesswork,

148
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:47,970
but the PM wants us to
play it with everything we've got.

149
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:51,890
- And the aerial reconnaissance?
- All photographed. Nothing.

150
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:54,768
Are the Japanese equipped
to launch such a rocket?

151
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:57,146
- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?

152
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,231
That's what you've got to
find out, and fast.

153
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,191
Before the real shooting starts.

154
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:04,570
This damn thing could blow up
into a full-scale war.

155
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:09,408
When you get to Tokyo,
go to that name and address.

156
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:12,244
Our man Henderson
will contact you there.

157
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:14,997
- Henderson.
- Captain here. Full ahead.

158
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:16,832
Right.

159
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:21,753
- Well, that's all.
- Thank you, sir.

160
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,255
- 007.
- Sir?

161
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:26,341
We've only three weeks
to the next American launch.

162
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:27,843
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

163
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:31,763
My sources tell me the Russians
are planning one even earlier.

164
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:34,933
- So move fast, 007.
- Yes, sir.

165
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,109
Oh, by the way, how was the girl?

166
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:46,653
Which girl?

167
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:49,406
Er, the Chinese one we fixed you up with.

168
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,700
Another five minutes, I'd have found out.

169
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:54,369
Hmm, she'll never know what she missed.

170
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:58,707
Miss Moneypenny,
give 007 the password we've agreed

171
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,626
- with Japanese SIS.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:05,047
We tried to think of something
you wouldn't forget.

173
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:06,173
Yes?

174
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:09,635
I... love... you.

175
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:12,512
Repeat it, please,
to make sure you get it.

176
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:14,473
Don't worry, I get it.

177
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:16,225
Sayonara.

178
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,143
James... good luck.

179
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:22,397
Instant Japanese. You may need it.

180
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:27,319
You forget, I took a first
in oriental languages at Cambridge.

181
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:34,826
Stand by to load.

182
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,497
Lift to the launch!

183
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:44,962
Tube loaded.

184
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:46,505
Hubcap open.

185
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:51,677
Fire.

186
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,993
This is your ticket.

187
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,540
Thank you.

188
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:47,459
Dozo.

189
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:25,182
I love you.

190
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:28,477
I have a car nearby.

191
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:31,855
- Oh, where do you suggest we go?
- I know a quiet hotel.

192
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:37,944
- And?
- Where your friend is waiting.

193
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:41,573
Mr Henderson.

194
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:48,163
Wasn't Mr Henderson
able to come himself?

195
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,874
- I suppose not.
- Why?

196
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,876
He didn't say.

197
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:10,769
Well, I think it's about hotel-time.

198
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,548
How long have you
worked for Henderson?

199
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:43,593
Long enough to learn not to discuss
such matters with strangers.

200
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:07,242
- Mr Henderson's waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?

201
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:10,036
Mr Henderson would like
to see you alone.

202
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:21,798
Do come in.

203
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:25,343
Mr Henderson?

204
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,263
At your service.

205
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:47,741
I believe, um... you wanted to
ask me some questions.

206
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:50,201
Yes. Excuse me.

207
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,043
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.

208
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,254
I lost that in Singapore in '42.

209
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:05,717
You must excuse
this rather odd mixture of styles,

210
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,511
but I refuse to go entirely Japanese.

211
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:11,473
Very fond of some of these old things.

212
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:16,353
- You've never been to Japan before?
- No, never.

213
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:19,481
I myself have lived here for, er...

214
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:22,317
...28 years.

215
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,527
And I'm just beginning
to know my way about.

216
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:28,573
- Your most vital contact will be Tanaka.
- Tanaka?

217
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:31,368
He's head of the Japanese secret service.

218
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:35,622
And his identity is the most
closely guarded secret in Japan.

219
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,499
When can I see him?

220
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,252
- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?

221
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:45,048
His closest friends
are permitted to call him that.

222
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,884
- Do you have any leads of your own?
- Yes, I do.

223
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:50,970
Oh, that's stirred not shaken.
That was right?

224
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:52,806
Perfect.

225
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:54,641
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

226
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:58,353
Russian vodka. Well done.

227
00:21:58,437 --> 00:22:01,898
Yes, I get it from the doorman
at the Russian embassy.

228
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,693
Amongst certain other things.

229
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:08,279
Now, look. I think London's theory

230
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:11,199
about the missile being fired
from this country is right.

231
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:13,159
I don't know how or where.

232
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:15,954
And don't ask me who's doing it either.

233
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:22,711
But I have a fairly shrewd idea
that a major foreign power is behind it all.

234
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:24,587
You mean, apart from Russia and Japan?

235
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:27,465
Oh, it's not Russia, old boy,
I'm sure of that.

236
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:30,510
It's not Japan either.

237
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,889
Although a large Japanese
industrial concern is...

238
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:37,220
Good evening.

239
00:26:03,557 --> 00:26:04,766
Cheers.

240
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:11,356
Siamese vodka?

241
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,202
There he is!

242
00:27:49,997 --> 00:27:51,330
Freeze!

243
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:09,474
Get in, quick!

244
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:19,317
Now, what the hell's the score?

245
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:22,153
What do you mean?
My job is to help you.

246
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:24,030
Like you helped Henderson?

247
00:28:24,114 --> 00:28:26,491
I'm taking you to a place of safety.

248
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:29,869
No, this time I'm taking you.
I want some information now.

249
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:33,956
- I have no information to give you.
- We'll see about that. Slow down.

250
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:27,885
Welcome.

251
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:33,724
Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond.

252
00:29:35,227 --> 00:29:38,146
It is a great pleasure to meet you at last.

253
00:29:39,189 --> 00:29:41,899
And how do you like our country so far?

254
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:49,240
I am a trifle disappointed at the ease
with which I could pull you in.

255
00:29:49,908 --> 00:29:53,327
The one thing my honourable mother
taught me long ago

256
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:56,330
was never to get into a car
with a strange girl.

257
00:29:56,415 --> 00:30:00,084
But you, I'm afraid,
will get into anything with any girl!

258
00:30:04,882 --> 00:30:08,676
I must say, you have a lot of energy
for a dead man, Mr Bond.

259
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:16,809
You are James Bond, aren't you?

260
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:24,025
I am so very pleased to meet you,
Bond-san. I really am.

261
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:27,195
Permit me to introduce myself.

262
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,031
My name is Tanaka. Please call me Tiger.

263
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:33,618
If you're Tanaka,
how do you feel about me?

264
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:36,746
I... love you.

265
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:40,333
I'm glad we got that out of the way.

266
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:42,627
I'd like you to examine these
as soon as possible.

267
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:45,504
They're from Osato's safe.

268
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:51,177
This is an order for naval stores.

269
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:54,388
500 kilos of butter, 50 containers of lox.

270
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:56,724
What is lox?

271
00:30:56,808 --> 00:30:59,310
An American name for smoked salmon.

272
00:31:01,897 --> 00:31:04,982
But it's also the technical name
for liquid oxygen.

273
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:06,234
Which makes rocket fuel.

274
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:08,027
- Very interesting.
- Yes.

275
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:09,487
We must go.

276
00:31:10,072 --> 00:31:13,157
The journey out will be more dignified
than the journey in.

277
00:31:13,242 --> 00:31:15,326
That wouldn't be difficult.

278
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:17,912
Oh, I'd like that negative enlarged.

279
00:31:17,996 --> 00:31:19,038
OK.

280
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:27,421
My private train.

281
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:29,966
I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.

282
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,219
In my position, it would be most unwise.

283
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,474
Very convenient.

284
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,436
I imagine that your Mr M in London
has a similar arrangement.

285
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,522
M? Oh yes, but of course.

286
00:31:45,524 --> 00:31:47,650
Then the girl in the white
sports car's one of us.

287
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:50,194
- Aki? Yes.
- Very competent.

288
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:51,862
- Domo arigato.
- Dozo.

289
00:31:51,947 --> 00:31:55,491
Do you like Japanese sake,
or would you prefer vodka martini?

290
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:57,368
Oh, no. I like sake.

291
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:02,581
Especially when it's served
at the correct temperature.

292
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,959
98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is.

293
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:07,795
For a European,
you are exceptionally cultivated.

294
00:32:10,507 --> 00:32:13,092
- We'll see the photograph you found.
- Good.

295
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,476
A ship and a strip of land.
It could be anywhere.

296
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,645
My men found a microdot on the paper.

297
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,980
Enlarge!

298
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:31,902
It says, 'Photograph taken by female
American tourist from coastal vessel.'

299
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:35,197
'The woman has been liquidated
as a routine precaution.'

300
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:38,743
- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.

301
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,413
So, they killed an innocent tourist
for taking this?

302
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:44,957
Can you make it bigger?

303
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:46,751
Ning-Po.

304
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:49,670
Check motor vessel Ning-Po. Full details.

305
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:51,797
All recent movements
and present whereabouts.

306
00:32:54,426 --> 00:32:57,428
- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left!

307
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:00,306
Aha! Ama. Diving girls.

308
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,183
Can you identify that coastline?

309
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,893
Given time, yes.

310
00:33:10,275 --> 00:33:13,444
- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?
- Mr Osato.

311
00:33:13,612 --> 00:33:15,654
Can you arrange an appointment
with him tomorrow?

312
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:17,031
Of course.

313
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:19,700
But tonight, consider my house yours.

314
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:22,119
Including all of my possessions,
naturally.

315
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:34,465
My friend, now you take
your first civilised bath.

316
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,967
Really? Well, I like the plumbing.

317
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:40,805
Place yourself entirely in their hands,
my dear Bond-san.

318
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:44,475
Rule number one,
is never do anything for yourself

319
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:46,769
when someone else can do it for you.

320
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:49,146
- And number two?
- Rule number two,

321
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:52,983
in Japan, men always come first.
Women come second.

322
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:55,528
I might just retire to here.

323
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:04,620
Your English girls would never perform
this simple service.

324
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,581
I know one or two
who might get round to it.

325
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:10,000
Miss Moneypenny, perhaps?

326
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:12,503
We have our sources,
Bond-san, just like you.

327
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,465
Don't get the soap in my eye, will you?

328
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,100
I suppose you know what it is about you
that fascinates them.

329
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:30,688
It's the hair on your chest.
Japanese men have beautiful bare skin.

330
00:34:31,022 --> 00:34:32,982
Japanese proverb say,

331
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:36,652
'Bird never make nest in bare tree.'

332
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,784
If Henderson's theory is right,

333
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:47,496
why would a foreign power
want to launch missiles from Japan?

334
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:50,791
Because if they were discovered,
they could deny responsibility.

335
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:54,462
Especially if some private organisation's
doing the work.

336
00:34:54,546 --> 00:34:56,380
- Osato?
- Perhaps.

337
00:34:57,132 --> 00:35:00,176
Mr Osato is one of
our greatest industrialists.

338
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,219
No, he's merely a front.

339
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:04,054
- Who is big enough?
- SPECTRE.

340
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:05,681
Could be.

341
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:08,726
Now, massage. Which girl do you select?

342
00:35:14,983 --> 00:35:16,775
I'll settle for this little old lady here.

343
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,235
Good choice.

344
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,070
She's very sexyful.

345
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:31,415
The last time someone gave me
a massage was in Hong Kong.

346
00:35:33,251 --> 00:35:36,962
But unfortunately...
we had to cut it short.

347
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:40,508
We were rudely interrupted
by a couple of gunmen.

348
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:44,094
So, we never got around to finishing it.

349
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,973
This time, you shall finish it.

350
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:52,019
Aki.

351
00:35:59,236 --> 00:36:01,570
No one will disturb you tonight.

352
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:09,537
I think I will enjoy very much
serving under you.

353
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:37,439
- Mr Fisher?
- Yes.

354
00:36:37,524 --> 00:36:39,275
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

355
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,909
Please come in, Mr Fisher.

356
00:36:48,994 --> 00:36:51,120
- Mr Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.

357
00:36:51,663 --> 00:36:53,914
You are three and a half minutes early.

358
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:55,624
Please be seated.

359
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:24,755
- How do you do, Mr Fisher?
- How do you do?

360
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:28,008
Miss Grant, my confidential secretary.

361
00:38:28,343 --> 00:38:29,843
- Hello.
- Hello.

362
00:38:29,928 --> 00:38:33,931
- May we offer you some champagne?
- No, thank you, it's too early for me.

363
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,100
- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.

364
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:38,852
I always take
a glass in the morning.

365
00:38:38,937 --> 00:38:41,689
- You should try it.
- It's bad for your liver.

366
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:45,776
- Nonsense, it adds a sparkle to the day.
- I'm sure it does.

367
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:54,952
A Dom Pérignon '59, Mr Fisher.

368
00:38:55,662 --> 00:38:59,540
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- Well, if you insist.

369
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,626
- Please be seated, Mr Fisher.
- Thank you.

370
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:10,300
So, you are the new managing director

371
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:12,344
- of Empire Chemicals?
- Yes.

372
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,680
- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?

373
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,516
Ah, yes, he died rather suddenly,
poor chap.

374
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:19,643
Ah, so. From what?

375
00:39:20,145 --> 00:39:22,229
He fell into a pulveriser at the works.

376
00:39:22,313 --> 00:39:23,522
Ah, so.

377
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:25,733
How shocking.

378
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:30,404
- A very honourable death, all the same.
- Very.

379
00:39:30,822 --> 00:39:32,823
He gained great face with the company.

380
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:37,536
I hope you are not taking
any risks yourself, Mr Fisher.

381
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:40,289
Me? I never take any risks.

382
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:43,417
You forgive me for saying so, but, er

383
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:46,670
I think you are taking one now.

384
00:39:47,172 --> 00:39:48,172
I am?

385
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:50,382
Mm-hm. You should give up smoking.

386
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:52,384
Cigarettes are very bad for your chest.

387
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:55,721
Mr Osato believes in a healthy chest.

388
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:57,514
Really?

389
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,934
Now then, you must tell me
what I can do for you.

390
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:04,146
We're interested in the bulk-buying
of fermentation chemicals.

391
00:40:04,606 --> 00:40:07,941
Monosodium glutamate
and ascorbic acid.

392
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:11,111
- Would you like a manufacturing licence?
- Yes, very much.

393
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:15,365
So, I'll have my sales manager
get the quotations

394
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,535
and delivery dates for you
as soon as possible.

395
00:40:18,661 --> 00:40:21,538
We'll contact you later today
at your hotel.

396
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,958
- Which hotel are you staying at?
- The Hilton.

397
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:28,670
Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

398
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:30,756
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you, too.

399
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:36,470
- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr Fisher.

400
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:41,225
Kill him.

401
00:40:58,743 --> 00:40:59,827
Get down!

402
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,205
294 here. Tiger, immediate.

403
00:41:45,832 --> 00:41:47,291
Come in, 294.

404
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:52,546
Zero-zero is with me. We are being
chased by gunmen, in black sedan.

405
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,590
I'm heading south for Highway Two.

406
00:41:54,674 --> 00:41:57,009
Arrange usual reception, please.

407
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:35,482
- How's that for Japanese efficiency?
- Just a drop in the ocean.

408
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:40,487
- Zero-zero?
- Yes, Tiger.

409
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:43,824
Ning-Po is owned by Osato Chemicals.

410
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:47,536
- That fits. Go on.
- Vessel now loading in Kobe docks.

411
00:43:47,745 --> 00:43:50,747
Sailing for Shanghai
at 5pm this afternoon.

412
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:55,252
Suggest you proceed Kobe immediately
to look her over.

413
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,088
- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.

414
00:43:58,423 --> 00:44:00,549
Proceeding immediately, Kobe docks.

415
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:02,259
Tiger, contact M.

416
00:44:03,386 --> 00:44:05,303
Tell him to send Little Nellie.

417
00:44:05,388 --> 00:44:07,264
Repeat, Little Nellie.

418
00:44:08,016 --> 00:44:10,684
Suggest she be accompanied
by her father.

419
00:44:10,768 --> 00:44:12,352
Most urgent. Understood?

420
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:13,770
Understood.

421
00:44:40,465 --> 00:44:43,091
Condensation, ice-cold. Liquid oxygen.

422
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:13,246
Aaargh!

423
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,583
Get out of here. Contact Tanaka.

424
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,418
I'm not leaving you.

425
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:21,379
Tell him to keep that ship shadowed.

426
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:23,465
Go now.

427
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:55,056
Take him to Number 11.

428
00:46:57,518 --> 00:47:00,353
- Wake him up.
- Are you finished?

429
00:47:02,273 --> 00:47:03,607
Where am I?

430
00:47:03,983 --> 00:47:06,359
You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po.

431
00:47:06,444 --> 00:47:09,905
Leave him to me now. Wait in there.
And shut the door.

432
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:12,449
I've got you now.

433
00:47:13,492 --> 00:47:15,452
Well, enjoy yourself.

434
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:20,165
- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals, you know that.

435
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:23,793
- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.

436
00:47:23,878 --> 00:47:26,713
And why were you
snooping around the docks?

437
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,091
I like ships. And I used to be a sailor.

438
00:47:30,718 --> 00:47:32,260
You are a liar.

439
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:41,311
- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.

440
00:47:41,437 --> 00:47:44,022
Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.

441
00:47:44,732 --> 00:47:46,983
They use it to slice off skin.

442
00:47:50,238 --> 00:47:52,781
I hope you won't force me to use it.

443
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:04,584
Now, what's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

444
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:16,972
I have a confession to make.

445
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:18,390
What?

446
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:21,393
Actually, I'm a spy.

447
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:23,395
I know that.

448
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:32,279
I suppose you know that
industrial secrets are big business?

449
00:48:32,363 --> 00:48:33,530
Mm-hm.

450
00:48:34,365 --> 00:48:38,994
Well, I've stolen Osato's new process
for making monosodium glutamate.

451
00:48:39,996 --> 00:48:41,329
And, er...

452
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:43,164
Well, it's worth

453
00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:45,333
$300,000.

454
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:47,043
So?

455
00:48:47,253 --> 00:48:51,756
Well, I'll split it with you if you'll get me
out of here and back to Tokyo.

456
00:48:52,216 --> 00:48:53,967
That's a nice offer.

457
00:48:54,677 --> 00:48:58,013
- How about it?
- I'm afraid not.

458
00:48:58,431 --> 00:48:59,514
Why?

459
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:07,063
Osato would kill me.

460
00:49:11,402 --> 00:49:14,237
We could fly to Europe tomorrow,
you and I.

461
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:27,876
Er...

462
00:49:39,764 --> 00:49:42,098
Oh, the things I do for England.

463
00:49:52,777 --> 00:49:56,571
Now, you are going to need some
very close... protection tonight in Tokyo

464
00:49:56,655 --> 00:50:00,575
because... well, that's when
they'll try and get at you.

465
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:02,619
You'll need the best man we've got.

466
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:04,954
And, er... who do you suggest?

467
00:50:05,748 --> 00:50:06,915
Well,

468
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:08,124
me.

469
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:11,294
I'm afraid I have another appointment
tonight, Mr Fisher.

470
00:50:13,672 --> 00:50:16,633
I'm awfully sorry to leave you,
but I have to get off.

471
00:51:14,567 --> 00:51:18,153
Chasing girls will be the end of you,
Bond-san, I have told you before.

472
00:51:18,237 --> 00:51:21,239
He didn't chase her.
He did it so I could get away.

473
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:23,908
He wouldn't touch that horrible girl.

474
00:51:24,034 --> 00:51:26,369
- Would you?
- Oh, heaven forbid.

475
00:51:26,662 --> 00:51:27,662
Any progress?

476
00:51:27,746 --> 00:51:30,707
Yes. We identified
the coastline in the photograph.

477
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:35,795
It is an island called Matsu, on the direct
route between Kobe and Shanghai.

478
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,465
We shadowed the Ning-Po in a helicopter.

479
00:51:38,549 --> 00:51:39,924
- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.

480
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:43,636
It was a very dark night.
Impossible to see her all the time.

481
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:46,181
But we know she stopped somewhere.
Look at these.

482
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:49,642
That one we took last night.

483
00:51:50,895 --> 00:51:53,271
And that one, early this morning.

484
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:57,442
- Notice, please, the water line.
- You're right.

485
00:51:58,235 --> 00:52:00,570
Fully laden here and empty here.

486
00:52:02,072 --> 00:52:04,115
I want to take a fast look
at the island now.

487
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,660
- Has Little Nellie arrived yet?
- Yes, and her father.

488
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:12,165
Ah, welcome to Japan, Dad.
Is my little girl hot and ready?

489
00:52:12,249 --> 00:52:16,211
Look, 007, I've had a long and tiring
journey, probably to no purpose.

490
00:52:16,295 --> 00:52:19,005
I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips.

491
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:38,858
I have much curiosity, Bond-san.

492
00:52:38,943 --> 00:52:40,527
What is Little Nellie?

493
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:44,280
Oh, she's a wonderful girl.
Very small, quite fast.

494
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:47,116
Can do anything. Just your type.

495
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:49,369
A toy helicopter?

496
00:52:49,453 --> 00:52:52,288
No, it's certainly not a toy! You'll see.

497
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:55,166
We've made some improvements
since you used her last.

498
00:52:55,459 --> 00:52:59,128
- I'll give you the drill.
- This is only for children. Don't use it!

499
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:01,297
Take my helicopter instead.

500
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:04,759
Right. Now pay attention.

501
00:53:04,843 --> 00:53:07,804
- Two machine guns, fixed.
- Synchronised to what?

502
00:53:07,888 --> 00:53:10,765
100 yards, using incendiaries
and high explosives.

503
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:12,725
Two rocket launchers,

504
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,645
- forward-firing on either side.
- Fine.

505
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:20,233
Now, these fire heat-seeking
air-to-air missiles. 60 a minute.

506
00:53:20,317 --> 00:53:21,401
Good.

507
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:24,362
Flame guns. Two of 'em. Firing astern.

508
00:53:24,488 --> 00:53:27,949
- What range?
- 80 yards. Two smoke ejectors next door.

509
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:31,828
Aerial mines. Now remember,

510
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:34,664
use them only
when directly above target.

511
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:37,917
- That's about the lot. You know the rest.
- Yes.

512
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:40,503
Cine camera.

513
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:44,966
- Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles.
- Good luck!

514
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,759
I'll contact you when I get over the island.

515
00:53:46,844 --> 00:53:48,678
Be careful, Bond-san!

516
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,491
Hello, Base One.

517
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:55,578
I'm over the island and the fishing village.
Nothing to report.

518
00:54:55,871 --> 00:54:58,206
We'll keep listening.

519
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:29,445
Hello, Base One.
There's nothing here but volcanoes.

520
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,322
Understood. Carry on.

521
00:58:29,585 --> 00:58:31,043
- Hello, Base One.
- Listening.

522
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:32,670
Little Nellie got a hot reception.

523
00:58:32,754 --> 00:58:35,590
Four big-shots made
improper advances,

524
00:58:35,674 --> 00:58:38,384
but she defended her honour
with great success.

525
00:58:38,468 --> 00:58:41,095
- Heading for home.
- Do not come home.

526
00:58:41,722 --> 00:58:43,556
Russian space shot imminent.

527
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,517
Proceed vector 4-6 degrees
and await instructions.

528
00:58:46,602 --> 00:58:48,269
- Understood?
- Roger and out.

529
00:58:55,652 --> 00:58:56,819
Tri,

530
00:58:57,237 --> 00:58:58,487
dva,

531
00:58:58,572 --> 00:59:00,615
edin. Shiganya!

532
01:02:04,174 --> 01:02:07,176
Clear the area. Clear the area.

533
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:22,566
Prepare for reception.

534
01:02:23,151 --> 01:02:30,699
Radar blackout is now complete.

535
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:50,845
Moscow radio's already saying we did it.

536
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:54,348
The president's called
a press conference for 2pm.

537
01:02:54,432 --> 01:02:56,392
He'll deny emphatically we were involved.

538
01:02:56,476 --> 01:02:58,686
- But can we prove it?
- Of course not.

539
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:01,438
No one will believe the Russians did it.

540
01:03:01,523 --> 01:03:04,650
Now they'll use the excuse
to shoot down our next Jupiter.

541
01:03:04,734 --> 01:03:08,487
Houston to Washington. We followed him
for one orbit, now he's off the screen.

542
01:03:08,572 --> 01:03:10,739
That means he's coming down.

543
01:03:10,824 --> 01:03:14,743
- Yeah, but where?
- Some place in Russia. It has to be.

544
01:03:15,495 --> 01:03:18,330
The British theory about Japan
is nonsense.

545
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,041
- Forget Japan.
- I agree.

546
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,378
We've re-photographed
every square inch.

547
01:03:59,497 --> 01:04:02,291
Ventilator fans to full power.

548
01:04:02,542 --> 01:04:04,460
Open all air ducts.

549
01:04:04,961 --> 01:04:06,712
Area safe to enter.

550
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:08,839
All crews to stations.

551
01:04:09,549 --> 01:04:11,508
All air ducts to normal.

552
01:04:13,428 --> 01:04:14,887
Air ducts opened.

553
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:17,306
- Close crater.
- Closing crater.

554
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:20,184
Fire guards to station.

555
01:04:31,613 --> 01:04:34,823
Ventilator fans to normal. Open shutters.

556
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:39,286
Reception complete.

557
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,083
Withdraw captive spaceship.

558
01:04:47,212 --> 01:04:49,088
Guards to stations.

559
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:22,871
- Remove the prisoners.
- Remove the prisoners.

560
01:05:44,644 --> 01:05:47,062
I shall be in my apartment.

561
01:05:48,732 --> 01:05:50,733
I may send for you later.

562
01:06:18,595 --> 01:06:22,598
I must congratulate you, gentlemen,
upon your superb equipment.

563
01:06:23,433 --> 01:06:25,517
We congratulate you, sir,
upon the way you handle it.

564
01:06:25,852 --> 01:06:28,729
Our clients are satisfied
with the progress so far?

565
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:31,732
- My government is quite satisfied.
- Good.

566
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:33,275
Hans!

567
01:06:38,573 --> 01:06:41,867
You will see that my piranha fish
get very hungry.

568
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:46,497
They can strip a man to the bone
in 30 seconds.

569
01:06:58,885 --> 01:07:02,179
I have decided to ask for
a little money in advance.

570
01:07:02,555 --> 01:07:06,767
I want the sum of 100 million dollars,
in gold bullion,

571
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:09,144
deposited in our account
in Buenos Aires.

572
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:12,189
Our agreement states
no money should be paid

573
01:07:12,273 --> 01:07:15,859
until war has broken out
between Russia and the United States.

574
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:19,405
- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.

575
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:22,324
Go and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy.

576
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:26,662
Osato and Number 11, report now.

577
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:44,930
An unknown Englishman
was in your office the other day.

578
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:46,765
Correct, Number One.

579
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:49,852
- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.

580
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:53,939
Only one person we know
uses this sort of gun.

581
01:07:55,316 --> 01:07:57,192
James Bond.

582
01:07:58,111 --> 01:08:01,196
- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.

583
01:08:01,281 --> 01:08:02,531
Rubbish.

584
01:08:02,866 --> 01:08:04,366
Bond is alive.

585
01:08:05,034 --> 01:08:07,369
Unless you killed him, Mr Osato?

586
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:10,706
Don't tell me you let him go.

587
01:08:11,374 --> 01:08:14,168
I gave Number 11
the strictest orders to eliminate him.

588
01:08:15,128 --> 01:08:16,211
And did she?

589
01:08:17,213 --> 01:08:18,547
She failed.

590
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:21,925
You should have killed him.
You had plenty of opportunity.

591
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:25,262
This organisation
does not tolerate failure.

592
01:08:25,346 --> 01:08:27,681
- I know, but you see, I...
- Go!

593
01:08:30,727 --> 01:08:31,810
Well?

594
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:38,025
Aagghh!

595
01:08:39,736 --> 01:08:41,361
Osato!

596
01:08:51,915 --> 01:08:54,041
Kill Bond! Now!

597
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:57,544
Yes, Number One. Yes. Yes, yes.

598
01:09:37,877 --> 01:09:40,546
- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.

599
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:44,216
Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians
are accusing the Americans.

600
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,426
Next time it will be war.

601
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:49,346
- We'll have to get down to the volcanoes.
- I agree.

602
01:09:49,472 --> 01:09:52,349
We'll also need
a company of first-rate men.

603
01:09:53,101 --> 01:09:55,018
Do you have any commandos here?

604
01:09:55,103 --> 01:09:57,104
I have much, much better.

605
01:09:57,772 --> 01:09:59,982
Ninjas. Top-secret, Bond-san.

606
01:10:01,442 --> 01:10:03,026
This is my ninja training school.

607
01:10:10,076 --> 01:10:13,245
- Ninjas?
- The art of concealment and surprise.

608
01:10:49,282 --> 01:10:52,034
This must develop
very fast reflex actions.

609
01:10:52,118 --> 01:10:53,535
And spiritual strength.

610
01:11:26,736 --> 01:11:29,488
Now, we will see some modern ninjas.

611
01:11:33,368 --> 01:11:34,951
My plan is this.

612
01:11:35,536 --> 01:11:37,496
I make a base on the Ama island.

613
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,207
100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen.

614
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,335
They will be workers and fishermen.

615
01:11:43,419 --> 01:11:45,170
- What about me?
- Later.

616
01:11:45,296 --> 01:11:48,757
But for the moment,
these will interest you. Rocket guns.

617
01:11:49,008 --> 01:11:50,425
Very powerful.

618
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:53,011
See the holes in the back
for jet propulsion.

619
01:11:56,933 --> 01:11:59,434
- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.

620
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:03,605
This is our special baby rocket.

621
01:12:04,232 --> 01:12:08,110
Very useful for people who smoke
too many cigarettes, like you.

622
01:12:15,618 --> 01:12:18,286
- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.

623
01:12:18,621 --> 01:12:21,832
- It can save your life.
- You sound like a commercial.

624
01:12:23,501 --> 01:12:26,962
- What's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.

625
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,756
Second, you train hard and quickly

626
01:12:30,216 --> 01:12:32,342
to become a ninja like us.

627
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,721
And third, to give you
extra-special cover,

628
01:12:36,431 --> 01:12:38,014
you take a wife.

629
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,067
Regretfully impossible.

630
01:12:49,527 --> 01:12:50,652
You must marry Ama girl.

631
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:52,821
One who is known on the island.

632
01:12:53,322 --> 01:12:56,491
- Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.

633
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,870
- To hell with that idea.
- But this is duty.

634
01:12:59,954 --> 01:13:01,163
Hmph!

635
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:05,125
The girl I have chosen
is an agent of mine.

636
01:13:05,209 --> 01:13:07,169
But first, you must become Japanese.

637
01:13:12,717 --> 01:13:15,135
- Eyepieces to Hera.
- Eyepieces to Hera.

638
01:13:21,559 --> 01:13:23,143
Why don't you just
dye the parts that show?

639
01:13:33,237 --> 01:13:35,947
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.

640
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:45,207
Tiger said, from now on,

641
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:48,043
you must do everything Japanese-style.

642
01:13:48,252 --> 01:13:49,795
Everything?

643
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:52,464
Good for Tiger.

644
01:15:57,965 --> 01:15:59,132
I'm...

645
01:16:01,594 --> 01:16:02,844
I... I...

646
01:16:04,013 --> 01:16:05,096
Aki!

647
01:16:05,181 --> 01:16:06,806
I'm...

648
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:16,858
She's dead.

649
01:16:18,653 --> 01:16:19,903
Poisoned.

650
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:26,826
Tiger, we must get to that island.

651
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:30,372
You're almost ready.
Just two more days' training.

652
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,082
- You killed him.
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.

653
01:17:18,337 --> 01:17:20,880
This man is a stranger from outside.

654
01:17:21,924 --> 01:17:23,508
It's lucky we're getting out of here.

655
01:17:23,592 --> 01:17:28,013
Tomorrow you will be a poor Japanese
worker, with humble Japanese wife.

656
01:17:28,097 --> 01:17:30,181
Yeah, with a face like a pig.

657
01:21:03,103 --> 01:21:05,021
My men are already ashore.

658
01:21:05,105 --> 01:21:06,856
All over the island.

659
01:21:07,149 --> 01:21:10,151
We have four days left.
It is not much time.

660
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,549
This is my house.

661
01:22:17,136 --> 01:22:19,470
My friend has made us some food.

662
01:22:22,391 --> 01:22:23,975
Do you live here alone?

663
01:22:24,059 --> 01:22:26,477
Yes. My parents are dead.

664
01:22:26,937 --> 01:22:28,563
Sit down, please.

665
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,151
Oysters.

666
01:22:34,236 --> 01:22:35,486
Is this the only room there is?

667
01:22:35,571 --> 01:22:36,612
Yes.

668
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:38,906
That is your bed.

669
01:22:39,575 --> 01:22:41,576
I shall sleep over there.

670
01:22:43,287 --> 01:22:46,748
- We're supposed to be married.
- Think again, please.

671
01:22:46,874 --> 01:22:48,374
You gave false name to priest.

672
01:22:48,917 --> 01:22:51,794
But we must keep up appearances!
We're on our honeymoon.

673
01:22:52,046 --> 01:22:54,422
No honeymoon. This is business.

674
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,721
Well, I won't need these.

675
01:23:31,877 --> 01:23:33,920
- Bond-san.
- What's wrong?

676
01:23:34,463 --> 01:23:37,006
The Americans have changed
the launching date.

677
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:38,800
The countdown has already started.

678
01:23:38,884 --> 01:23:42,387
The president has given
a last warning to the Russians.

679
01:23:42,471 --> 01:23:44,972
- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight. Our time.

680
01:23:45,265 --> 01:23:49,352
- Did your men search the island?
- Yes. There is nothing but volcanoes.

681
01:23:49,436 --> 01:23:51,396
Everything is so normal around here.

682
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,689
- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.

683
01:23:53,774 --> 01:23:56,651
Yesterday an Ama girl
rowed her boat into Ryuzaki.

684
01:23:56,985 --> 01:23:59,862
- Ryuzaki?
- It is a big cave on the mainland.

685
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:01,989
And when her boat floated out again,

686
01:24:03,158 --> 01:24:04,617
she was dead.

687
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:08,621
- Was that the funeral we saw yesterday?
- Yes.

688
01:24:09,123 --> 01:24:11,499
- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.

689
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,586
- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.

690
01:24:15,671 --> 01:24:18,381
We'll slip away from the fishing fleet
in the morning.

691
01:24:59,798 --> 01:25:01,299
All right?

692
01:25:02,009 --> 01:25:03,968
Now, where is this cave?

693
01:25:04,553 --> 01:25:05,928
It's straight across.

694
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:07,889
The cave is over there.

695
01:25:37,669 --> 01:25:38,836
Gas. Get over the side.

696
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:40,087
Quick!

697
01:26:05,614 --> 01:26:08,366
Phosgene gas, to keep the visitors away.

698
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:12,370
Did you notice the sulphur on the walls?

699
01:26:12,454 --> 01:26:13,913
- The yellow?
- Yes.

700
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:16,999
It was once an underground outlet
for the volcanic lava.

701
01:26:17,292 --> 01:26:20,586
- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.

702
01:26:21,463 --> 01:26:22,922
It leads all the way,

703
01:26:23,006 --> 01:26:24,882
right up to the top.

704
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:27,260
That's where we have to go.
Can you make it?

705
01:26:27,553 --> 01:26:30,012
Of course. It's business.

706
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,305
Good.

707
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,909
May I rest a moment?

708
01:26:51,994 --> 01:26:53,244
Surely.

709
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,542
- It's hard work.
- Mm.

710
01:27:00,877 --> 01:27:02,420
Some honeymoon!

711
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:33,576
It's going down! Into the volcano!

712
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:41,751
Heliport to position.

713
01:27:43,712 --> 01:27:45,921
The honeymoon's over. Come on.

714
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,418
This volcano isn't active, is it?

715
01:28:24,586 --> 01:28:27,213
It never has been. Not in my lifetime.

716
01:28:27,714 --> 01:28:29,840
There's been some
terrific heat here recently.

717
01:28:30,258 --> 01:28:32,593
What happened to the helicopter?

718
01:28:32,886 --> 01:28:34,929
It's down there somewhere.

719
01:28:35,263 --> 01:28:36,514
Come on.

720
01:28:39,851 --> 01:28:41,519
Stand by. Mark.

721
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:44,105
Stand by for ten-second countdown.

722
01:28:44,314 --> 01:28:46,357
10, 9, 8...

723
01:28:46,441 --> 01:28:49,110
All units worldwide
will remain at readiness

724
01:28:49,194 --> 01:28:51,028
so long as the spacecraft is in orbit.

725
01:28:51,113 --> 01:28:53,614
...3, 2, 1.

726
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:56,200
Ignition.

727
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:10,965
This is it, gentlemen.
All we can do now is wait and pray.

728
01:29:33,071 --> 01:29:34,155
Is that deep?

729
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,490
They usually are - very.

730
01:29:41,788 --> 01:29:42,997
It's metal!

731
01:29:43,331 --> 01:29:44,665
Wait here.

732
01:29:59,556 --> 01:30:02,016
Heliport to takeoff position.

733
01:30:09,149 --> 01:30:10,608
Open crater.

734
01:30:29,044 --> 01:30:31,295
Emergency crews to stations.

735
01:30:34,049 --> 01:30:36,467
Go to Tanaka.
Tell him to come with every man he's got.

736
01:30:36,551 --> 01:30:37,593
Yes.

737
01:31:11,878 --> 01:31:14,380
Heliport to standby position.

738
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:02,469
Astronauts to dressing rooms.

739
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:15,190
Attention, attention.

740
01:32:15,275 --> 01:32:18,402
American target vehicle is now in orbit.

741
01:32:18,528 --> 01:32:21,864
Interception will take place
in two hours' time.

742
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:39,381
Washington, this is Houston.

743
01:32:40,175 --> 01:32:41,967
Houston to Washington.

744
01:32:42,052 --> 01:32:46,430
Our vehicle is now
120 nautical miles altitude,

745
01:32:46,514 --> 01:32:48,891
170 miles downrange.

746
01:32:53,229 --> 01:32:55,731
Jupiterto Houston,
we now have second phase.

747
01:32:55,815 --> 01:32:57,232
Roger, Jupiter.

748
01:32:57,317 --> 01:33:01,320
Four hours
36 minutes into the mission.

749
01:33:01,404 --> 01:33:03,656
- Can you give us a time?
- Roger.

750
01:33:08,036 --> 01:33:13,082
Connect igniter cable.

751
01:33:38,984 --> 01:33:46,740
Radar technicians, report to control room.

752
01:34:05,427 --> 01:34:08,846
T minus 100 minutes and counting.

753
01:34:09,389 --> 01:34:12,516
Did you volunteer for astronaut training?

754
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,936
In our country, we say cosmonaut.
Yes, both of us...

755
01:34:18,815 --> 01:34:21,650
Yes, since six months we started training.

756
01:34:23,028 --> 01:34:24,486
Good evening.

757
01:34:25,822 --> 01:34:27,573
Who the hell are you?

758
01:34:27,657 --> 01:34:29,825
Stand back, I'm gonna blow the lock.

759
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,083
Stand back.

760
01:34:48,178 --> 01:34:50,137
Get into their uniforms.

761
01:35:52,867 --> 01:35:55,077
Astronauts have two minutes.

762
01:35:55,829 --> 01:35:57,830
Repeat, two minutes.

763
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:07,131
Reserve astronaut to stand by.

764
01:36:10,051 --> 01:36:13,011
- Lock on target.
- Lock on target vehicle.

765
01:36:13,388 --> 01:36:15,639
Check secondary guidance.

766
01:36:15,723 --> 01:36:19,935
Launch time is now
T minus 90 minutes and counting.

767
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,604
Astronauts to launching pad.

768
01:36:22,689 --> 01:36:24,815
Astronauts to launching pad.

769
01:36:26,067 --> 01:36:29,736
Repeat, astronauts
to launching pad immediately.

770
01:37:09,611 --> 01:37:15,073
Crews, stand by on gantry.

771
01:37:49,734 --> 01:37:53,362
- Stop that astronaut. Bring him to me.
- Stop that astronaut!

772
01:37:53,446 --> 01:37:57,157
- Summon the reserve astronaut!
- Reserve astronaut!

773
01:37:57,992 --> 01:38:01,078
Reserve astronaut
to launching pad, immediately.

774
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:12,798
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

775
01:38:13,258 --> 01:38:14,466
A new update

776
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:18,845
with target vehicle
has been received from computers.

777
01:38:20,181 --> 01:38:24,226
We now have T minus seven minutes
and counting.

778
01:38:24,727 --> 01:38:26,520
You made a mistake, my friend.

779
01:38:26,604 --> 01:38:30,565
No astronaut enters the capsule
with his air conditioner.

780
01:38:31,526 --> 01:38:33,193
Remove his helmet!

781
01:38:39,367 --> 01:38:40,909
James Bond.

782
01:38:41,286 --> 01:38:43,745
Allow me to introduce myself.

783
01:38:45,581 --> 01:38:48,875
I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

784
01:38:50,253 --> 01:38:52,462
They told me
you were assassinated in Hong Kong.

785
01:38:53,715 --> 01:38:55,215
Yes, this is my second life.

786
01:38:57,677 --> 01:38:59,344
You only live twice, Mr Bond.

787
01:38:59,429 --> 01:39:02,264
Target vehicle
passing over central Russia.

788
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:04,766
Approaching Mongolia.

789
01:39:05,059 --> 01:39:07,686
Track is as predicted. All computers...

790
01:39:08,021 --> 01:39:10,939
As you see,
I am about to inaugurate a little war.

791
01:39:11,482 --> 01:39:15,986
In a matter of hours, when America
and Russia have annihilated each other,

792
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:18,655
we shall see a new power
dominating the world.

793
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:22,909
- Target vehicle on scope.
- Brief check on target vehicle.

794
01:39:23,369 --> 01:39:25,746
Remove his suit and search him.

795
01:39:25,872 --> 01:39:29,124
Reserve astronaut ready on Bird 1.

796
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:40,677
- Prepare for firing.
- Prepare for firing.

797
01:39:40,845 --> 01:39:44,681
Clear the area.

798
01:39:47,602 --> 01:39:50,228
Emergency services to stand by.

799
01:39:51,647 --> 01:39:53,190
Area now clear.

800
01:39:56,110 --> 01:40:00,280
T minus one minute,
30 seconds and counting.

801
01:40:01,157 --> 01:40:03,909
Re-coordinate with target vehicle.

802
01:40:04,202 --> 01:40:06,787
Bird 1 now in readiness.

803
01:40:06,954 --> 01:40:10,207
Astronauts ready on Bird.
All systems are go.

804
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:13,919
- Close shutters.
- Close shutters.

805
01:40:14,295 --> 01:40:17,839
- Radar blackout commence.
- Radar blackout in operation.

806
01:40:21,344 --> 01:40:23,762
Effective range, kilometres 800.

807
01:40:24,222 --> 01:40:26,515
- Open crater.
- Opening crater.

808
01:40:29,852 --> 01:40:31,478
Crater opening.

809
01:40:32,313 --> 01:40:34,731
Bird 1 to liftoff position.

810
01:40:53,042 --> 01:40:57,254
Gimbal the engines.
Pressurised tanks open.

811
01:40:58,172 --> 01:41:00,590
Ventilator fans to full power.

812
01:41:00,967 --> 01:41:02,050
10 seconds.

813
01:41:02,135 --> 01:41:03,718
9, 8,

814
01:41:03,845 --> 01:41:05,554
7, 6,

815
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:07,722
5, 4,

816
01:41:08,182 --> 01:41:09,683
3, 2,

817
01:41:10,184 --> 01:41:11,726
1, 0.

818
01:41:11,853 --> 01:41:13,186
Ignition.

819
01:41:40,756 --> 01:41:41,798
Close crater!

820
01:41:42,258 --> 01:41:43,800
Closing crater.

821
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:48,221
Open shutters!

822
01:42:29,388 --> 01:42:31,765
Bird 1 to base. Separation complete.

823
01:42:31,849 --> 01:42:33,600
Confirm acquisition.

824
01:42:33,684 --> 01:42:34,809
Calling Bird 1.

825
01:42:34,894 --> 01:42:39,606
You are 70 nautical miles downrange.
200 miles altitude.

826
01:42:39,690 --> 01:42:42,943
Hans, our job will soon be done.

827
01:42:43,569 --> 01:42:47,239
Blow them up as soon as they have
captured the Americans. Here is the key

828
01:42:48,407 --> 01:42:50,575
to operate the exploder button.

829
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,077
There are men in the crater!

830
01:42:52,161 --> 01:42:55,956
Crater guns, fire.

831
01:42:56,374 --> 01:42:58,124
Crater guns, open fire.

832
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:22,899
The firing power inside my crater

833
01:43:22,984 --> 01:43:25,694
is enough to annihilate a small army.

834
01:43:26,028 --> 01:43:28,154
You can watch it all on TV.

835
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:31,366
It's the last programme
you're likely to see.

836
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:35,161
If I'm going to be forced
to watch television, may I smoke?

837
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:38,415
Yes. Give him his cigarettes.

838
01:43:38,499 --> 01:43:41,668
It won't be the nicotine
that kills you, Mr Bond.

839
01:43:59,979 --> 01:44:01,605
Armed guards to control room.

840
01:44:17,163 --> 01:44:19,205
- Close the crater.
- Close crater!

841
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:22,834
I shall look forward personally
to exterminating you, Mr Bond.

842
01:45:21,018 --> 01:45:22,602
Close the shutters.

843
01:45:30,736 --> 01:45:32,612
We are now impregnable.

844
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:36,950
Interception takes place in eight minutes.
Nothing can prevent that.

845
01:47:05,873 --> 01:47:08,666
Impregnable?

846
01:47:08,959 --> 01:47:12,086
- Come with me, Mr Bond.
- Bird 1 to base. Locked on target.

847
01:47:12,171 --> 01:47:13,880
- Osato?
- Yes, Number One?

848
01:47:15,716 --> 01:47:17,467
Base calling Bird 1.

849
01:47:18,052 --> 01:47:21,596
You are to assume full control
of operation from now on.

850
01:47:22,056 --> 01:47:24,057
Seven minutes to interception.

851
01:47:24,141 --> 01:47:25,725
Roger, Base One.

852
01:47:26,936 --> 01:47:28,561
Houston, this is Hawaii.

853
01:47:28,646 --> 01:47:30,688
We have an unidentified object on scope.

854
01:47:30,773 --> 01:47:33,274
Order first alert. Arm all weapons.

855
01:47:33,734 --> 01:47:35,735
Interception will occur in six minutes.

856
01:47:42,827 --> 01:47:45,829
This is the price of failure, Mr Bond.

857
01:47:51,877 --> 01:47:53,127
Come on.

858
01:48:04,431 --> 01:48:06,224
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

859
01:48:18,028 --> 01:48:20,947
There's an exploder button in the
control room. We've got to get up there.

860
01:48:21,031 --> 01:48:23,199
Impossible. Too well defended.

861
01:48:29,957 --> 01:48:33,585
Evacuate the control!

862
01:48:53,397 --> 01:48:56,149
Control room technicians.
There must be another way up there.

863
01:49:09,038 --> 01:49:11,122
Give me cover till I get to the staircase.

864
01:50:56,812 --> 01:50:58,229
Bon appétit.

865
01:51:14,163 --> 01:51:17,206
Closing fast on our vehicle.
Orbit identical.

866
01:51:17,791 --> 01:51:21,044
All units stand by for codeword.
Codeword is imminent.

867
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:23,796
I repeat, closing fast on our vehicle.

868
01:51:54,328 --> 01:51:56,287
It's blown up! The enemy!

869
01:51:56,371 --> 01:51:58,790
I repeat, the enemy has blown up.

870
01:51:59,333 --> 01:52:01,626
All units will return to first alert.

871
01:52:01,710 --> 01:52:04,712
Codeword is not,
I say again, not imminent.

872
01:52:08,175 --> 01:52:09,467
Tiger...

873
01:52:10,844 --> 01:52:12,345
We've done it.

874
01:52:31,115 --> 01:52:32,698
Down the tunnel!

875
01:53:55,115 --> 01:53:56,282
Steady.

876
01:54:12,758 --> 01:54:14,926
Now... about that honeymoon.

877
01:54:16,386 --> 01:54:17,637
Why not?

878
01:54:17,846 --> 01:54:20,139
But they'll never let you stay.

879
01:54:20,933 --> 01:54:22,975
But they'll never find us.

880
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:53,256
- Dinghy's on board, sir.
- Tell him to come below and report.

881
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:55,341
It'll be a pleasure, sir.

882
01:55:07,771 --> 01:55:13,276
You only live twice

883
01:55:13,694 --> 01:55:18,739
Or so it seems

884
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:22,535
One life for yourself

885
01:55:22,619 --> 01:55:29,500
And one for your dreams

886
01:55:29,626 --> 01:55:34,797
You drift through the years

887
01:55:35,132 --> 01:55:40,428
And life seems tame

888
01:55:41,555 --> 01:55:44,223
Till one dream appears

889
01:55:44,308 --> 01:55:49,645
And love is its name

890
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:56,402
And love is a stranger

891
01:55:56,903 --> 01:56:01,574
Who'll beckon you on

892
01:56:02,576 --> 01:56:06,078
Don't think of the danger

893
01:56:06,163 --> 01:56:11,584
Or the stranger is gone

894
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:17,131
This dream is for you

895
01:56:17,591 --> 01:56:22,261
So pay the price

896
01:56:23,388 --> 01:56:25,931
Make one dream come true

897
01:56:26,016 --> 01:56:31,520
You only live twice

898
01:56:52,918 --> 01:56:53,918
