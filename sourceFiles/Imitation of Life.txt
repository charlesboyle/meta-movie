1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,500
What is love

2
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
Without the giving

3
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,100
Without love

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,300
You're only living

5
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,100
An imitation

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
An imitation

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,700
Of life

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,700
Skies above

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,300
In flaming color

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,000
Without love

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,100
They're so much duller

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
A false creation

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,100
An imitation

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,100
Of life

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,700
Would the song of the lark

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,300
Sound just as sweet

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,900
Would the moon
be as bright above

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,800
Every day would be gray

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,400
And incomplete

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,800
Without the one

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,000
You love

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,300
Lips that kiss

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,900
Can tell you clearly

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,100
Without this

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,500
Our lives are merely

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,500
An imitation

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,600
An imitation

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Of life

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,700
Susie! Susie!

30
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Susie!

31
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,600
The most sensational...

32
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
Susie!

33
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,500
Pardon me. Have you seen a little
girl in a blue sunsuit?

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,500
Oh!

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,900
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
No harm done.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm looking for my daughter.
Have you seen a little girl
all by herself?

37
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,200
No, but if you'll...
She's lost and l...
Susie!

38
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
Relax, lady.
Take it easy.
Susie!

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,300
The easiest way
to find Susie
is to go to the police.

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Well, where are the police?

41
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,600
Right there.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,400
Right where?
Right down there under the pier.

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,500
You're it!

44
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Come, children.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,900
You hear me, Sarah Jane?
Hot dogs!

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,900
Oh, boy!
Come on! Boy!
Hot dogs!

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,600
It might be the noise of
that old ocean, but it seems
to me I didn't hear thank you.

48
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,200
I was too hungry.
Thank you!
Thank you!

49
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
Honey, you gonna be all right.
I reported you.

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,100
Come on, Sarah Jane!
No, you're gonna stay
right here.

51
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,900
Oh!
Else how your mama gonna find you?

52
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,400
Susie! Oh, Susie!

53
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,100
Oh, my baby! Oh,
I thought you were lost.

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,500
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you very much.

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,000
And thank you for being
so kind, Mrs... .
Johnson.

56
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,800
I'm Lora Meredith.
I've never been
so frightened in my life.

57
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,100
One moment I had her,
and the next moment
she was gone.

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Thank Mrs. Johnson
for being so nice.
Thank you!

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,400
And say good-bye
to the little girl.
Good-bye? Now?

60
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,900
But, darling, we have
to go back to the city.
But we wanna play!

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,200
Please?
Please, Mommy,
please!

62
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,500
Oh, all right.
But only for a little while.

63
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,600
Come on, Sarah Jane!

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
You're it!
You're it!

65
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,700
You're it!
You're it!

66
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,900
Susie doesn't have many
children to play with
where we live.

67
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,300
I guess Sarah Jane's
kind of lonesome too.

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,900
They got along fine
right off.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sarah Jane's a lovely child.
How long have you
taken care of her?

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
All her life.

71
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,700
Oh, I wish I had someone
to look after Susie.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,000
A maid to live in?
Someone to take care
of your little girl?

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,400
A strong, healthy,
settled-down woman...

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,400
who eats like a bird
and doesn't care
if she gets no time off...

75
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,600
and will work real cheap?

76
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,800
Well, yes, if one exists.
Oh, someday.

77
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Why not today?
I'm available.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,700
You?
Me. Annie Johnson.

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,400
You mean you'd
consider leaving that
lovely little girl?

80
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, I wouldn't be leaving her.
My baby goes where I go.

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,100
Sarah Jane
is your child?

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,500
Yes, ma'am.
It surprises most people.

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Sarah Jane favors her daddy.
He was practically white.

84
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,800
He left before she was born.

85
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,400
Seems to me, Miss Meredith,
I'm just right for you.

86
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,400
You wouldn't have to pay
no wages. Just let me come
and do for you.

87
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,000
I couldn't do that.
I'd have to pay you,
and I... can't now.

88
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,800
Susie!

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,500
I ought to knock
your blocks off.

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,500
I'll take care of it,
mister. I'll wham
the hides off both of them.

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,700
Susie! What are
you doing?
About time you showed up!

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,700
If your husband can't keep
these brats in line...

93
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,700
No use talking to her.
She not only spoils them,
she goes around losing them.

94
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I don't know what
this is all about.

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Mommy, look at his stomach.
It went up and down.
It was so funny.

96
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,000
He took our picture.
Will you send me one?

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,000
Me too.
Sure. Where?

98
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,200
Send it to Susan Meredith,
450 Prescott Place,
Apartment 32.

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,600
Never mind, dear.
See? I remembered.

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,900
Thank you.
And send her one too.
Where do you live, Sarah Jane?

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,400
Where do I live...
No place.

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,200
We'll find a place
come night, honey.

103
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,400
Come on, darling, we have
to go. Say good-bye to
Sarah Jane and Mrs. Johnson.

104
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,100
Good-bye.
It was very nice
meeting you.

105
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,100
Same here.
And good luck,
Miss Meredith.

106
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,700
Mommy, I'm tired.
I know, baby.

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,400
I know.
I wanna go home too!

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,300
Come on, honey.

109
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,900
Thank you.
Mrs. Johnson.

110
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,100
Oh. Oh, come on.

111
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
First.

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,500
I don't like
to mention it again, but
you must understand that...

113
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,500
this arrangement
can only be for tonight.

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,700
Oh, I understand,
Miss Lora.

115
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
There must be plenty of jobs
for a woman like you.

116
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,100
But people won't take in
a woman with a child.

117
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,300
And no matter what, I won't
be separated from my baby.

118
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,900
Hurry up, Mother.
I want to show Sarah Jane
my dolls!

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,900
Well, all right.

120
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,100
There's a little place
off the kitchen.

121
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,700
But you could, uh,
hardly call it a room.

122
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,200
Oh, it'll do
for Sarah Jane and me.

123
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,600
And the kitchen,
we can make use of that too.

124
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,500
I'll get you some
pillows and blankets.
Thank you.

125
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,500
Here, Sarah Jane,
you can have Nancy.

126
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,200
It's a present.
Mommy just got it for me.
I want that one.

127
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,500
Frieda's my friend.
I've had her all my life.

128
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Mommy!
Mommy!
Yes?

129
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,300
She took my doll!
Oh.

130
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Sarah Jane.
Where are your manners?
Now give it back.

131
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,300
I don't want the black one.
I'll take those.

132
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,400
It's been a long day
and they're both tired
and cranky.

133
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,800
Yes, Miss Lora.
Everything will be all right.

134
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Come on, come on.

135
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,900
Come on.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,300
I don't wanna
live in the back.

137
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,100
Why do we always have
to live in the back?
Shh, honey.

138
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,900
Thank you, Mr. McKinney.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Shh. Good-bye.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Shh!

141
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,100
Good morning, darling.

142
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,500
Good morning,
Sarah Jane.
I want a kiss too.

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,900
Well, of course.

144
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,100
Annie said we had to be quiet
until you got up.

145
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Now we can talk out loud.
Now we can even scream.

146
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,700
Children!

147
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,200
Children! What...

148
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Oh, good morning,
Miss Lora.
Good morning.

149
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,300
How are you
this morning?
Just fine.

150
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,100
I'd love some coffee.

151
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,300
Well, Annie, you shouldn't
have done my laundry.

152
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,600
I like taking care
of pretty things.

153
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,700
Thank you.

154
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,500
Eggs?
Where did they come from?

155
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,900
The milkman was here
a minute ago.

156
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
I told him to leave
your regular order.

157
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,400
Oh, no. He didn't come
to leave my order. He stopped
doing that two weeks ago.

158
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,400
May I?
Thank you.

159
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
He wanted to collect
something on his bill.

160
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,900
Didn't say anything
about a bill to me.
He was very polite.

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,900
Gave me the order and said,
looked like things
were picking up.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,900
He thought you were my maid.
Now he thinks I'm prosperous.

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,900
No sin in lookin' prosperous.
Just a way of showin'
your trust in the lord.

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,400
Telling him you're ready
whenever he is.

165
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,700
I'll get it, Miss Lora.

166
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,600
Miss Meredith's
residence.

167
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,200
I'll see if it's convenient
for Miss Meredith
to come to the phone.

168
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,400
Is it the landlord
Mr. Berwitt?

169
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,400
Pretty sure he said
the A-Acme Model Agency.

170
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Hello?

171
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes, this is Miss Meredith.

172
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Yes. Yes, I can be there
by then.

173
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,100
Fine. Thank you.

174
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh, Annie, I've got
a job modeling.

175
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,900
A job?

176
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,400
I've registered everywhere.
But this is the first call.

177
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,500
Now, isn't that fine?

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Annie, if you have
no other plans, will you stay
with Susie until I come back?

179
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
Why, certainly.

180
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,100
Do you know this will be
the first money I've earned
since I came to New York?

181
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,500
Except for those envelopes.

182
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,300
I was wondering what they were.
I address them
for a mail-order house.

183
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,200
By hand.
It gives them a personal touch,
and I can do them at home.

184
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,900
They should have been
finished yesterday.
Well, can't be helped.

185
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,900
If I get a job modeling,
at least I'll be seen.

186
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,600
Good boy.

187
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,600
Yes, that's fine.
That's what I want.
Hold it. Beautiful.

188
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Just a minute.
Hold it.

189
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,900
How could you sneeze?
I had it.

190
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,100
I'm sorry, but it must be
this flea powder.

191
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,000
No, no, no. Don't move.
You'll unfocus me.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,500
Art they want
and I get sneezes.

193
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Now, don't move a hair.
Not one hair.

194
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,500
Hold it, hold it.

195
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,600
Okay.

196
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,300
Got it. Perfect.

197
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,500
You were
wonderful, Henry.
I never sneeze. Really...

198
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,500
Your check will be
in the mail.

199
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,800
It would be so much
more convenient...
Checks are mailed on Thursday.

200
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,300
We don't want to confuse
the bookkeeper.

201
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,400
Don't forget to leave
the wardrobe.

202
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,700
But wouldn't you like
to have a bite to eat?

203
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Later. Thanks.

204
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
You can keep the money
from this batch, Annie.

205
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
It'll pay you for staying
today and cooking and...

206
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,600
Uh-uh. That money
goes into our kitty.

207
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,300
"Our"?

208
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Seems as if
you intend to stay.

209
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,800
Seems like I do,
if, if you want it.

210
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,200
You know I do.
But you can see
how bad things are.

211
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,400
Miss Lora, we just come
from a place where,

212
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,600
where my color
deviled my baby.

213
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,100
Now, anything happens here
has gotta be better.

214
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,900
Oh, Annie.
Oh.

215
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Susie? Susie?
I'm home...

216
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Oh, baby.
Mmm. Hi, dear.

217
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,800
Hello, Miss Lora.
Hello, Annie.

218
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,000
Mommy, we had such fun today.
Annie took us to the park
and we caught a squirrel.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,700
No, we didn't.
Well, we nearly did.

220
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,200
Tomorrow I'll take you
both to the park and
we'll really catch one.

221
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,600
How'd it go?
Oh, Annie.

222
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,600
It didn't.

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,200
And I'm exhausted.

224
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,600
Walked my feet off
trying to see every
agent on Broadway.

225
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,500
And some off Broadway.
Way off.

226
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll get it.

227
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,300
The children have eaten.

228
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes?
Hello, this is
Steve Archer.

229
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
- Steve Archer?
- I brought the pictures.

230
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,000
You brought the pictures?
The ones of the children
on the beach.

231
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,300
- Oh, the man on the beach.
- The man on the beach?

232
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,700
The man on the beach!
It's our picture
with the fat man!

233
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,600
Mommy, tell him
to come up.
Yes, please!

234
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, all right. Will
you come up, Mr. Archer?

235
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,700
Come on. Let's see.
Did you bring the pictures?
Hi, Susie, Sarah Jane.

236
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Where is it?
Aren't you kids
supposed to be in bed?

237
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
No, we waited for you!

238
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,600
Hello.
Good evening.

239
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,700
If it's that funny,
let me see it.

240
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,300
Don't you think
it's funny, Annie?

241
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't know who's funnier,
you or that man.

242
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,600
All I got to say is,
it's lucky I didn't catch
Sarah Jane playing such pranks.

243
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,200
It just ain't
seemly, Miss Lora.
Now, off to bed.

244
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Good night.
Good night.

245
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,600
Good night, Mr. Archer.
Good night, ladies.

246
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Good night.
Won't you sit down?

247
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
It was very nice of you
to remember the children.

248
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,300
I like what you did...
for Sarah Jane and Annie.

249
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, they didn't have a place
and since I live here alone...

250
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,900
I'm a widow.
Oh, you... are.

251
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,100
What do you think of this?

252
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,300
Mother in distress.

253
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,900
Well, that's good.
Very good.

254
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,800
Who are you anyway?
Well, you don't look
like a photographer.

255
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,200
Apparently the army
thought I did.

256
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,200
Anyhow, they made me one.

257
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,200
Now all I wanna do is
get pictures like this
in The Museum of Modern Art.

258
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,600
Oh, you're aiming high.

259
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,000
Why not?
It doesn't cost anymore.

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,300
Don't you believe
in chasing rainbows?

261
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, if I didn't,
I wouldn't be here.
I'm an actress.

262
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,900
What's the matter?
Your bones.

263
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,700
What about my bones?

264
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,200
They're perfect.

265
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,500
My camera could easily
have a love affair with you.

266
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,700
Don't you think it's
getting a little late?

267
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,900
I don't suppose you'd like
to have dinner with me.

268
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,600
Maybe. Sometime.

269
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't mean right away.
How about tomorrow?

270
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm sorry, but I don't like
to miss having dinner with the
children two nights in a row.

271
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,600
I can understand that.
How about lunch?

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Lunch?

273
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,900
Would you mind taking me
to Rodney's?

274
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,800
It's a little place
on 45th and 8th.

275
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
Unemployed actors
can afford it.

276
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,500
Sort of a poor man's 21.

277
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,100
All right, I'll meet you
there at noon.

278
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Oh, by the way,
the name's Steve.

279
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,100
Everybody in here an actor?
Just about.

280
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,900
So far you're the only one
I really believe.

281
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,500
Thank you. Only so far,
you're the only one
in New York who does.

282
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
But someday I'm going to
make them all feel that way.

283
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,200
Aren't you a little late
getting started?
I mean, it's...

284
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,500
Yes, five years late.
That's why every day counts.

285
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,100
Why the five-year lapse?
My husband was
in the theater too.

286
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
A director.
A good director.

287
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,100
Everything I know
I owe to him.

288
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,100
It was a small town,
a little theater,
but professional.

289
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,400
When he died,
I had to make a living
doing something else.

290
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I never really wanted
anything but the stage.

291
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Oh, except Susie.

292
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,100
So, it took me five years
to save enough money
to come to New York.

293
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
But you did it.
Mm-hmm.

294
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
- And I'm going to be an actress, an important one...
-  Lora?

295
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,300
Lora.
Oh, excuse me.

296
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,700
Nothing in it for me,
honey,

297
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,100
but they're
beginning to cast a new
Tennessee Williams play.

298
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,100
Oh, what agent?
Allen Loomis... today.

299
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,000
So put on
your roller skates.
Oh, thanks, Fay.

300
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,100
Coffee?
I'm sorry,
but I've got to go.

301
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,100
You haven't eaten.
You go ahead.
Good-bye.

302
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,100
How about dinner?
Tonight?
We'll take Susie.

303
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Fine.
Where?

304
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Come and have
dinner with us.
All right.

305
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,200
Good luck.
Thanks, Fay.

306
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,000
But when can I have
an appointment?

307
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,900
How about a week
from today? Thursday.

308
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,500
Put me down.
It's Iris Dawn.
Don't forget it.

309
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Tsk.

310
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,900
I'm sorry to add
to your troubles, but...

311
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm afraid I'm a little late
for my appointment.

312
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,900
Name, please.
Miss Meredith.

313
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Mered...
Meredith.

314
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Well, I don't seem
to have you down.

315
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,500
Never mind.
Just tell Mr. Loomis
that Robert Hayes sent me.

316
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,900
Robert Hayes?
From International
Studio.

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,400
It's probably just a slipup
from the coast, but, uh,

318
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,400
Mr. Hayes won't
like it at all.

319
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,100
I hope you didn't
slip up.
Me?

320
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,800
Well, if you say
there's no appointment,
um, good-bye.

321
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, just a second.

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Why don't you sit down
and I'll see if I can
straighten this out?

323
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,700
Thank you.

324
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Mr. Loomis?
Yes?

325
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,900
There's a Miss Meredith here
from Hollywood.

326
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,500
Yes, quite lovely.

327
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,000
Think we should
send her away?
No. I think
you ought to see her.

328
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,700
Fine.
Okay.

329
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,100
Miss Meredith?
You can go in now.

330
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,500
Um, just right in.

331
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,600
Robert sends
his warmest greetings.

332
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Well, thanks.
And how is he?
Marvelous.

333
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,600
He's lost 15 pounds.
You know what an effort
that is for him.

334
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,100
And, uh, what can
I do for you?

335
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,300
Robert thought I shouldn't
do any more pictures before
I did a show on Broadway.

336
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,500
Very sensible.
I'm glad
you think so too.

337
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,900
That's why Robert
sent me to you.
He thought I'd get more...

338
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,800
personal attention
from you.

339
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,100
He could be right there.
You mind?
No.

340
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,800
Incidentally, how's the new
Tennessee Williams play?

341
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,300
Bound to be a blockbuster,
but all cast.

342
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,100
Hello? Oh, Lillian!
What?

343
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,300
Oh, well,
can't you break it?

344
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,900
Oh. No, I don't mind.

345
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,100
I don't mind you
standing me up. I'm fine.
I'll just kill myself.

346
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,100
Yeah.

347
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,400
Never be a bachelor.
There's no security.
I know how you feel.

348
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,900
Yeah? Say, how'd you like
to go with me tonight?

349
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,400
I'm afraid I can't.

350
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,600
Big party.
Lots of important people.

351
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,400
Well, I could see if I could
break a couple of engagements.

352
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,400
I'll call my place.

353
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,700
I'll call.
What's the number?

354
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,500
Montgomery,

355
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,500
76120.

356
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,700
...One, two, oh.

357
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,100
Miss Meredith's residence.

358
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,900
Oh, this is
Miss Meredith's residence?

359
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,700
That'll be Annie, my maid.
I'll talk to her.

360
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,700
Annie, uh, call
the Waldorf and tell, um,

361
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,100
you-know-who I cannot have
cocktails and dinner with him.

362
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,800
Uh, I know who?
Oh, yes, Miss Lora,
I'll do that.

363
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,300
Thank you.

364
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Well, Mr. Loomis,
it looks like I'm free.

365
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,700
That'll be just fine.
Should be an interesting
evening for me.

366
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,700
Hollywood actress and...
Oh, that reminds me.
Excuse me.

367
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,700
Yes, Mr. Loomis?

368
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,400
Annette, get me Hollywood,
Mr. Robert Hayes.

369
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,400
International Studios,
right? International...
Um.

370
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,800
Maybe you better not
go through with that call.

371
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,000
You don't think so?
Why not?

372
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Because Robert Hayes
doesn't exist.

373
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,800
I understand.
Annette, cancel the call.

374
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,800
Yes, Mr. Loomis.
I was desperate.

375
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,800
You were pretty good.
You lied. All actresses lie.
I know that.

376
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
But I believed you.
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,300
Don't leave.
You took me in.

378
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,300
For all of 20 seconds,
you took me in,
but I don't mind.

379
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,700
It was a good acting job,
and you're very pretty.

380
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,300
Now, about tonight.
Shall I pick you up?

381
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,900
Um, no, it'll be easier
for me to meet you here.

382
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,100
8:00?
You'll find me
very prompt, Mr. Loomis.

383
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Come on in.

384
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Sit down. I just have
a few letters to sign.

385
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,100
Oh, drink?
No, thank you.

386
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,500
But aren't we going
to be late to the party?
Plenty of time, plenty.

387
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,200
And I need a drink.
So relax.

388
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,300
Say, you're not allergic
to mink, are you?

389
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,100
Mink? No,
I don't think so.
Good.

390
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,100
Try this on for size.

391
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,700
But whose is it?
Mine. And I only loan it
to very special clients.

392
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,900
I want you to wear it
tonight.
You want me to wear...

393
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Please. Got to think
of my reputation.

394
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I haven't been seen
with a girl without a mink
since the heat wave of'39.

395
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
Come on.

396
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,800
We should spend
a little time talking
about our future.

397
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,200
You can act. Well,
that's of no importance
at the moment.

398
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,100
The main thing is,
you're a beaut.

399
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,300
Please, don't.
Oh, and you're decent too.

400
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
No doubt possess
some fine principles.

401
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,600
Well, me, I'm a man
of very few principles,

402
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,200
and they're all open
to revision.

403
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,700
But I'm in a position
to do something for you.

404
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,800
You'll get 10% of everything
I make. Isn't that enough?

405
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,400
No. Now,
sit down and listen.

406
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,100
Here it is, short and clear.
You're not a chicken.

407
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
You're no high-hearted kid
out of some drama school,

408
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
wanting to do or die
for dear old Thespis.

409
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
And you're beginning
under a handicap.

410
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,300
I know I'm starting late.
So time isn't on your side.

411
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,800
But you do have
some qualifications.

412
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,200
Your face will pass.
You've good, nice, long
silky legs. I like them.

413
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,800
You have a chest full
of quality and quantity.
I like it.

414
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,100
Aren't you taking
a few things for granted?
Me? I don't count.

415
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,100
But there are certain
people who do, and you're
going to meet all of them.

416
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,100
That is, if you're really
serious about your career.

417
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,700
I am, but...
Good, then you're going
every place with me.

418
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,500
Every party, opening night,
every saloon in town.

419
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
With a complete new
wardrobe at my expense.

420
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,500
Oh, it's tax deductible.

421
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,200
This is a tough,
competitive racket.

422
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Although it's a lot
more than any agent
is supposed to do,

423
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,500
I'd do it.

424
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
What's this got
to do with acting?
Nothing.

425
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,500
But I'll show you how to
realize your ambitions,
if you do as I say.

426
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,200
If the dramatists' club wants
to eat and sleep with you,
you eat and sleep with them.

427
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,400
If some producer with a hand
as cold as a toad wants to do
a painting of you in the nude,

428
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,400
you'll accommodate him
for a very small part.

429
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,800
It's disgusting!
It pays off.

430
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,800
You're disgusting.
Maybe I am.

431
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,800
But let me assure you,
once you get it made,

432
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,700
you can be idealistic
all of ten seconds
before you die.

433
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,700
You're trying to cheapen me.
But you won't. Not me.

434
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,100
Oh, I'll make it, Mr. Loomis,
but it'll be my way.

435
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,900
You have a wonderful
handwriting, Annie.

436
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,800
Oh, thank you, Mr. Steve.
But my spellin'
won't take no prizes.

437
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't think Lora
has anything to worry about
as long as you're with her.

438
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,800
Oh, we'll get by.
I made an agreement
with the landlord.

439
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,000
He's really
a nice person.
Oh?

440
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,500
Just for doin'
the staircases twice a week,
we get $10 off our rent.

441
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,500
Is that a fact?

442
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,500
I answered an ad
and got a job while
the kids are at school.

443
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,200
Doing what?
Doing shirts
for a gentleman.

444
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,700
He's real persnickety
about his shirts.

445
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,900
Oh, Steve.
Hello.

446
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,100
I'm sorry. It's just
that I got so involved.

447
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,500
We're having
a wonderful time.
How'd everything go?

448
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,500
Oh, just fine. I went
to the 21 with Mr. Loomis.

449
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,300
Everybody there
was somebody exciting.

450
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,100
For the first time,
I felt that I was somebody too.

451
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,200
Is Mr. Loomis gonna
find you a job?

452
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,500
Well, he, uh,

453
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,800
he wanted to represent me,
but...

454
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,800
But l...
Oh, Annie.

455
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,800
What's wrong, Miss Lora?

456
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,400
Everything. Everything.

457
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,900
Now, you just rest.
Everything will work out.

458
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,300
I'll go get you
a glass of hot milk, huh?

459
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,400
Can I help in any way?
No.

460
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,400
No one can.

461
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,900
No one.

462
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm so ashamed.

463
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,100
It was horrible.

464
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,200
He tried to make me
feel so cheap.

465
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,200
You could never
be cheap.

466
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,700
You don't know
what I mean.
Yes, I do.

467
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,200
It happens all the time.
Not just in the theater.

468
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,100
I love the theater.
It's what I want.

469
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,500
Then hold onto your dreams.
Forget tonight.

470
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,800
But they seem so stale
after tonight.

471
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,900
So stale I can't believe
in them anymore.

472
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,300
M-Maybe I'm a fool.

473
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,900
Maybe I should see things
as they really are...

474
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,800
and not as
I want them to be.

475
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,600
If I know you,
they'll have to be
the way you want them.

476
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,200
Thanks, Steve.

477
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,500
You're so, so good
for what ails me.

478
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,400
It's all part of
the Archer service...
day or night.

479
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,800
I'll call you soon,
Lora.

480
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Tomorrow.

481
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
Yes, please, tomorrow.

482
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,700
Annie, what's happened
to Susie's wrist?

483
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,900
Oh, nothin' serious.
Just a little experiment.

484
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,200
Experiment?
Sarah Jane's fault.

485
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,800
After class, one of the kids
said that Negro blood
was different.

486
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,900
So later this evenin',
Sarah Jane wanted to compare
her blood with Susie's.

487
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,600
Well, I spanked her good.

488
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,300
Oh, well, you know
how children are.

489
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,100
They were only playing.

490
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,100
I hope so, Miss Lora.
I hope so.

491
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,700
Santa Claus has many names
in many different countries.

492
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,200
In Holland, he is
called Sinter Klaas.

493
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,300
In France,
Saint Nicolas.

494
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,800
In Sweden, he is
known as Jul Tomte.

495
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,300
In Germany, he is...

496
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,700
Oh, can I do something
for you?

497
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,100
Sorry to trouble you,
but I brought these
for my little girl.

498
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,200
I'm afraid you've
made a mistake.

499
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,200
I don't have any little
colored girl in my class.

500
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,000
But they said 3-B.
This is 3-B, isn't...

501
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,600
Why, there's Sarah Jane.

502
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,600
There's my baby.
You mean Sarah Jane
Johnson?

503
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,400
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Mrs. Johnson.

504
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,100
Sarah Jane, baby,
I brought you your...

505
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,100
Sarah Jane!
We didn't know.

506
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,000
Sarah Jane?
Wait.

507
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,600
Sarah Jane?

508
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,300
Baby? Wait.

509
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,700
Sarah Jane?

510
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,500
Sarah Jane, wait.

511
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Wait. Now, now,
let me do it.

512
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,200
Now, put your coat on.
What do you want to do,
catch pneumonia?

513
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,400
I hope I do!
I hope I die!

514
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Honey, nothing's hurt.
You shouldn't
have let them...

515
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,900
They didn't ask me.
Why should I tell them?

516
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,600
Because that's what you
are, and it's nothin'
to be ashamed of.

517
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Why do you have to be
my mother? Why?

518
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,500
Why, you're
practically normal.

519
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,000
You two are soaking wet.
Get out of those things
and I'll make some tea.

520
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,300
I'll be fine.
You better get ready.
Mr. Steve's comin'.

521
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,300
Serve him right to wait.
He was due here
over an hour ago.

522
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,200
I just don't want
everybody having colds.
Cups and...

523
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,500
What's wrong?

524
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,100
Sarah Jane's been
passing at school,

525
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
pretending she's white.

526
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,400
But I am white!
I'm as white as Susie.

527
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:55,600
Oh, honey,
don't you see it doesn't
make any difference to us?

528
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,400
Because we all love you.

529
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,400
I'll take you back
to school myself.

530
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm never going back
to that school!

531
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,200
Never as long as I live!

532
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,100
Sarah Jane!
Don't cry!

533
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,000
Annie, don't be upset.
Children are always pretending.

534
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,500
You know that.

535
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,400
No, it's a sin to be
ashamed of what you are.

536
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,800
It's even worse to pretend,

537
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,100
to lie.

538
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,700
Sarah Jane has to learn
that the Lord must
have had his reasons...

539
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,000
for making some
of us white...

540
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
and some of us black.

541
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Sarah Jane Doesn't
want me with her.

542
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,800
She says I'm not her friend.
She says nobody's
her friend.

543
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,500
Darling, she's upset right now.
But she'll be better soon.

544
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,900
So will you if you get
back in bed. Come on.

545
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,100
Don't worry, Annie.
I'm sure you'll be able
to explain things to her.

546
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,300
I don't know.

547
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,500
How do you explain to your child
she was born to be hurt?

548
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,900
Hello.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

549
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,300
That's all right.
I'm ready. I thought
you'd never get here.

550
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Why, Steve, you sold it!

551
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,600
More than that, they gave me
a job, a steady one
on the advertising staff.

552
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,000
Oh, that's wonderful.

553
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,900
But, darling, is it really
what you want?

554
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,300
Well, it's not
The Museum of Modern Art.

555
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,000
But they pay you
in the nicest-looking
green folding money.

556
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,000
Which reminds me,
this is the season
for spending it.

557
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,500
Let's go.

558
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,200
We have to get a tree,
and I have a list of gifts
for the kids and Annie.

559
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,200
And I hope you like
what I picked out for you.

560
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,600
Oh, Steve, you...
You have to have something
to put under a tree, don't you?

561
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,800
Well, I know, but...
This way, ma'am.

562
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,200
Oh, I feel awful.

563
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,500
I haven't been able to buy
you anything really nice.

564
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,300
It's been five months
without a job...

565
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,200
Then I guess you'll
have to marry me.

566
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,800
It's the least you can do
for me for Christmas.

567
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,000
I love you.

568
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,700
But, darling, you're...

569
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,900
You're just
getting started and...

570
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
It would be foolish.

571
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,400
At least we'd
be foolish together.

572
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,400
But marriage
is such a big step.

573
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,100
I want us to be together.
Well, we are,
most of the time.

574
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,800
Most of the time
you're out fighting
to get somewhere.

575
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Breaking your heart,
trying to do for
yourself and Susie...

576
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,500
what I want to do for you,
what I finally
can do for you.

577
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,000
Pardon me. I'm sorry.
Pardon me.
Oh!

578
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,500
Well, wait a minute.

579
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,700
I want to give you a home,
take care of you, love you.

580
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,100
Oh, Steve, you
don't know me at all.

581
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,400
I still love the theater.

582
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,200
You tried it
and it's only hurt you.

583
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Realize that
and you'll get over it.

584
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,000
I want to be honest
with you, darling.

585
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,700
I want more.

586
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,100
Everything.

587
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,100
Maybe too much.

588
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,800
Don't think I want any less.

589
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,500
So let's settle something
right now. Do you love me?

590
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,900
I think I do,
but...

591
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900
Come here.

592
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,200
I want to kiss you
so badly.

593
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,000
But if you did,
the way things are right now,

594
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,600
I might say something
I wouldn't really mean.

595
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,800
That's why
I want to kiss you.

596
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,300
That's my phone.

597
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,100
Hello?
Miss Meredith's residence.

598
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,100
- Who, Mr. Loomis?
- She's not in.

599
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,100
She isn't in, Mr. Loomis.
No, not even if it's important.

600
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
What? A job?

601
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,600
l... I have to find out.
It could be something.

602
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Yes, Mr. Loomis?

603
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,100
You look good with
a St. Bernard dog.
The St. Bernard dog?

604
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Yes. Uh-huh.

605
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,100
Well, that's you
in the picture, isn't it?

606
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,600
Sprinkling flea powder?

607
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,100
All right, well, I'm here
with David Edwards.

608
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,000
David...
Edwards, yes.

609
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,400
You know,
the prize-winning playwright.

610
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,900
He saw that picture
in a magazine.

611
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,900
He's looking for a girl with
that certain "je ne sais quoi"
for his new play.

612
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,300
That certain something
you managed to get
with the dog.

613
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,200
It's not a big part, I know...
If this is one of
your jokes, Mr. Loomis...

614
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,200
Jokes? So help me,
I'm only thinking
percentage-wise.

615
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,800
The part calls for
about...
Two and a half.

616
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,300
Two-fifty a week.

617
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,700
I left the script with
my secretary. Can you
pick it up immediately?

618
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,200
Uh, yes.
Yes, Mr. Loomis.

619
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,200
Yes.

620
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,200
He wants me
to pick up a script;
I'm to audition tomorrow.

621
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,200
And you're going
down there?
Of course.

622
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,700
Even after what happened last time?
This has nothing to do with Loomis.

623
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,200
I'm to audition for David Edwards.
How do you know that?

624
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,200
I know. I just know.

625
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,200
But do you know if he's gonna be
any different than Loomis?
No, I don't.

626
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,800
I don't want you to go.
Don't you realize what
this could mean to me?

627
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,300
I'm not asking you
not to go down there,
I'm telling you.

628
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,800
What makes you think
you have that right?
Because I love you.

629
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,800
Isn't that enough?
No, Steve, I'm sorry.
Good night.

630
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,100
Lora, wait.

631
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,600
I didn't mean to sound dictatorial or
to try to run your life,

632
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,100
but you have to understand how I feel.
And what about the way I feel?

633
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,500
Oh, stop acting.
I'm not acting.

634
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,500
I want to achieve something,
something you'll never
understand.

635
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,100
What you're after isn't real.
At least
I'm after something!

636
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,600
Not the snapshot of
a disgusting old man with
a beer can on his belly.

637
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,100
Is that your idea
of achieving something?
Is a beer can "real"?

638
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,100
Going up and down,
up and down.

639
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,600
Well, I'm going up and up
and up, and nobody's
going to pull me down!

640
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,900
Lora, listen, please.

641
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,400
I've been trying to do
something with my pictures.
It's meant everything to me.

642
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Every minute,
for a long time now.
No, it hasn't.

643
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,600
Or you wouldn't
give it up to sell beer.

644
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
I gave it up for
something much better,
You.

645
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,100
But you're asking me
to give up something
I've wanted all my life,

646
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,100
ever since I was a child,
and I can't do it!

647
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,100
If you grew up,
you could.

648
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,400
What do you mean?

649
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
You're not
a child anymore,

650
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,600
and I might not be around
to pick up the pieces
this time.

651
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Good.

652
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,400
I'd like it that way.
Forever.

653
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,100
Joseph and Mary couldn't
find no place at the inn,

654
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,600
so they had to go to the
stable among the animals.

655
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,600
The animals?
Mm-hmm.

656
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,600
And in the manger
Jesus was born.

657
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,300
And the heavenly hosts
sang, "Hallelujah. "

658
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,300
There was a shining bright
star in the sky,

659
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,300
and it was
a beautiful time.

660
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,800
That'll be
Mr. Steve again.

661
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,300
Hello?
Hello, Annie.

662
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,500
- Oh, hello, Mr. Steve.
- Has she come in yet?

663
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,700
I'm sorry.

664
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,700
I see.

665
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Well, Merry Christmas,
Annie.

666
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,100
Merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Steve.

667
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,200
Mommy, isn't Steve
coming here tonight?

668
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I think you'd better
go to bed, both of you.

669
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,600
But Annie was
telling us a story.

670
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,600
Oh, all right,
Annie can finish it.
Where were we?

671
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,900
- Jesus was almost borned.
- That's right.

672
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,200
As soon as the holy infant
was born, three wise men saw
a beautiful star in the sky.

673
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,200
The star
of Bethlehem...
Was Jesus white or black?

674
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,200
It doesn't matter.
He's the way
you imagine him.

675
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,900
But Annie said
he was a real man.

676
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
He's not a pretend man.

677
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,100
He was real.
He is real.

678
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,100
Then what color was he?

679
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,600
He was like me...
White.

680
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,700
Now, the closet door
is over here.

681
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,900
The clothes closet door
is over there.

682
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,900
The door to your bedroom
is over here.

683
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,400
And you trip over
the vacuum cleaner
over there.

684
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,300
All right,
come on, let's have
your offstage line.

685
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,200
Is anybody home?

686
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,200
Marjorie?
Oh, Marjorie!

687
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,700
Colonel, what are you
doing in there?

688
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,900
Why, Mr. Obermeyer,
why aren't you in Duluth?

689
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, Herbert, you too?

690
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,700
No! No, no,
Miss Meredith.

691
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,000
David, David.
She can do it, David.
I guarantee it.

692
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,100
She's just
a little nervous.
Miss Meredith.

693
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,300
Yes, sir?

694
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,000
This scene is supposed to
be played for high comedy,
with delicate reactions,

695
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,000
not loud,
goggle-eyed takes.

696
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards.

697
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,700
But I'm an actress,
and a good one.

698
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,400
But I couldn't play
this part for high comedy.
Nobody could.

699
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,200
Nobody.
I think that's all,
Miss Meredith.

700
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,200
And if you'll forgive me
for saying it,

701
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,200
you're too good a writer
to have such a scene
in your play.

702
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,100
Okay, sister,
this way out.

703
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,700
I might as well confess...
She's not really my client.
Tell her to wait a minute.

704
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,200
Lora!
Lora, wait a minute.

705
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,200
I think we've still
got a chance.
No, I don't...

706
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,200
Miss Meredith.

707
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,700
It's been a long time
since anyone told me off.

708
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,200
Tell me, what would you do
with that scene?

709
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'd cut it out.
Drop it entirely.

710
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,200
That's not a bad idea.
Let me think.

711
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,100
Yes, but the scene
has a couple of lines
that are important.

712
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,100
Give them to Amy.

713
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
Yes, it would work.

714
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,800
Ha!
Think you could play Amy?

715
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,300
Amy?

716
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,800
Of course we'll have to
work very hard together.
I'd love it.

717
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,300
So would I. Tom?
Yes, Mr. Edwards.

718
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,400
Call off auditions
for the day. I'm busy.

719
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,400
You know, I always
believed in that girl.

720
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,200
- Lora Meredith!
- Lora Meredith!

721
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,600
Lora Meredith!
Lora Meredith!

722
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,900
Thank you, David.

723
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,700
They applauded me.
Did you hear them?
Why not? You were great!

724
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,400
Author! Author!
Your turn, Mr. Edwards.

725
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,900
Tom, may I borrow
a dime?
Sure.

726
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,100
I'll pay you back.
Don't rush. You'll be
around a long time.

727
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,100
I'll be right back.

728
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
Yes?

729
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,600
Oh, Miss Lora!

730
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,400
- And they liked me too.
- They did? Ohh!

731
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,900
Now, isn't that wonderful?

732
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,600
Do you want Susie?
Yes, please.

733
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,600
Congratulations,
mommy.

734
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,500
Congratulations, Mommy.
Did you remember your lines?

735
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,000
Yes, I remembered
all my lines.

736
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,000
Did they clap for you?
Yes, they did.

737
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,800
I'll be home very soon.
I'll only stay
a little while.

738
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,800
Then I'll come
right home.

739
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,100
Here's a kiss,
mommy.
Ohh.

740
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,600
And here's one
for you too. Mmm!

741
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,600
Let's go. The paper's
will be out soon,
and the party's waiting.

742
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,100
"This should be
a Pulitzer prize play
for David Edwards,

743
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,000
"for tonight we saw
the ranking comedy
of the season,

744
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,000
marvelously performed
by Geraldine Moore
and Preston Mitchell."

745
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,700
Listen
to the Times.

746
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,200
Atkinson says,
"A new star was born.

747
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,800
"Lora Meredith, an actress
who heretofore has been
hiding her light...

748
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
"somewhere
in the hinterlands,

749
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,300
gave a great performance
in a small part last night."

750
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,800
Congratulations,
baby.
Thank you, Allen.

751
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,800
- Congratulations.
- That was really...

752
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,000
Lora, this is
a great night for us.
For us?

753
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,200
Oh. Oh!

754
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,800
Well, I for one can't keep
my beady eyes open anymore.

755
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,300
- I'm going home.
- Well, good night, David.

756
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,300
Good night,
all you lucky people.

757
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,200
Good night.
Good night, dear.

758
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Good night.
Good night, David.

759
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Good night, Gerry.
Good night, David.

760
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
See you tomorrow.
Good night,
David!

761
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,200
- Good night, all!
- Good night.

762
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,200
Congratulations again, baby.
We did it, all right.

763
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,700
I'll see you first thing
in the morning,
in my office.

764
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,900
Agents.

765
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,400
By morning it'll be all over
town that he wrote your part,
directed you personally...

766
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,800
and was your lover
before you met me.

767
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,700
Well, lady,
there's your new empire.

768
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,000
Not big, just stretches
from 42nd to 52nd street.

769
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,500
But it's
the heart of the world.

770
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,000
You happy?
Oh, yes.

771
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,200
Yes.

772
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,500
I can't thank you...
I can't begin to
thank you for,

773
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
for giving me the chance.

774
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
No thanks.

775
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,600
It's something
we did together.

776
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,200
Yes.

777
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,100
We'll have more evenings
like this.

778
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,700
More plays.
I promise that.

779
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,900
Please.

780
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,200
And with you,
David.

781
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,200
Always with you.

782
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,900
You are good for me.

783
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,400
You mean that?

784
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,900
Well, you must be,
because l...

785
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,900
I've never felt
this way before.

786
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,900
Never so...
So complete...

787
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,400
and so happy.

788
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,400
I don't think
I could be happier
with anyone else either.

789
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,900
I'm in love
with you, Lora.

790
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,900
Though I must hasten to add,
I always fall in love
with my leading ladies.

791
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,400
Maybe that's all it is.

792
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,600
But I don't care,

793
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,400
because
I'm loving you now.

794
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,100
You and tonight.

795
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,100
Thank you.

796
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,400
Marvelous performance,
darling.

797
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,300
Just as fresh as it was
seven months ago.
Hmm.

798
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,100
Now hurry up
and get ready.
David.

799
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,100
Can't I beg off tonight?
I am so...
Beg off?
Impossible, darling.

800
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,100
Some nice, untouched money
out there from Cincinnati.

801
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,600
Hardware. They want to
meet you to invest in your
success and my next play.

802
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,100
She oughta go to bed now.
Annie, you're much too pretty
to be a watchdog.

803
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,600
And I can bite
sometimes.
Five minutes.

804
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,200
But darling...
While I keep Cincinnati
and the money happy.

805
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,700
Doesn't he ever stop?

806
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,700
He can't, Annie.

807
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,200
If he did
he'd be sure to find out
how sad he really is.

808
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,700
And I know that feeling.

809
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,000
Funny, isn't it?

810
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,800
After all this time,
the struggling and heartache,

811
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,300
and you make it.

812
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,300
Then you find out
it doesn't seem worth it.

813
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,300
Something is missing.

814
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,200
Now David
wants to marry me.

815
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,000
I don't know.
Do you love him?

816
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,000
No.

817
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,200
But he's good for me
in many ways.

818
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,700
At least I'm trying to
make myself think he is.

819
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,200
And of course it...
It would be better
for Susie.

820
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,700
This ain't no time
to make decisions.

821
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,700
You're tired, and you don't
know what you want.

822
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,200
Maybe I don't want
so much anymore.

823
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:38,200
But what would you do
if you gave it all up?

824
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,700
Well, I could spend
more time with Susie.

825
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,700
And you could stay home
with Sarah Jane.

826
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,700
Do you know,

827
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,200
I haven't been up to see
my baby at school in weeks.

828
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,200
Susie knows you love her.

829
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,200
And you need show business
as much as it needs you.

830
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,000
Oh, Annie, what would
I do without you?

831
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,900
Well. Beautiful.

832
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,900
Do you really
like it?

833
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,000
You're more beautiful
than I could ever
possibly remember.

834
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,000
And we're late.

835
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,100
Good night, Annie.
You see she gets home
at a decent hour.

836
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,900
Annie, I think
we'll try these,
uh, over here.

837
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,400
Miss Lora, we been
spending an awful lot
of money up here.

838
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:40,000
Do you think we can really
afford to have this place?
We can't afford not to.

839
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,000
Ma'am? Ma'am?
Oh, um...

840
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:46,500
Would you put it
over there, please?
In front of the window.

841
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,700
Oh, that's fine.

842
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,400
Would you
sign this, ma'am?
Mm-hmm.

843
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,900
Thank you very much.

844
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,900
Come on, let's go, Joe.

845
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,500
Did you see the bills
from Susie's new school?
Mm-hmm.

846
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,500
And it doesn't matter.
But Miss Lora...

847
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,000
No matter what it costs,
Susie's going to have
everything that I missed.

848
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,500
From her letters
she misses you more than
she'd ever miss Latin.

849
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,000
She just wrote
and told me...
Annie.

850
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,500
You still haven't told me what
the doctor said about those
spells you've been getting.

851
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,500
What do doctors always say
when they can't find nothin'
wrong? "Take it easy."

852
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,000
Well, do.
And I mean it.
Oh, Miss Lora...

853
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,000
You can have anyone
you want in here
to help you.

854
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,300
Be more work gettin' 'em
out of my way.

855
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,300
I'll get it.

856
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,400
Hello, Mr. Edwards.
Hello, Sarah Jane.

857
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,400
How are you?
Fine, thanks.

858
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,700
I'm going to The Village.
I'll be back by 3:00.

859
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,200
Annie,
that daughter of yours
gets prettier every day.

860
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,200
And so
sophisticated.

861
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,200
Darling.
Hello, dear.

862
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,700
Oh. Nice.
Yes. It's new.

863
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,700
Didn't you get
my messages yesterday?

864
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,200
Or have you given up
telephones?

865
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,700
Uh, well, we've been so busy
getting the house in order.

866
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,700
Come sit down.

867
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,800
Would you like a drink?
A long one. It's quite
a trek from Manhattan.

868
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,800
Your usual?
Uh-huh.

869
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,300
I'll get it.
All right,
enough chitchat.

870
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,500
Have you read
my new play?

871
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,900
Great, isn't it?
Yes, it's very good.

872
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
But David...

873
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Darling, I don't think
I should do another comedy.

874
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
No, no, wait a minute.

875
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,200
I've decided to do
the new Stewart play.
That? What part?

876
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,200
Not the dull social worker
with the high dreams
and low heels.

877
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,400
Yes.
It's drama.
No clothes, no sex.

878
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,600
No fun!
I know.

879
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,700
But it's a great chance for...
For good acting.

880
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,700
And that colored angle
in it, it's absolutely
controversial.

881
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,200
- What do you know
about controversy?
- Nothing.

882
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,300
And I don't want to know.

883
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,300
I only know it's a good script,
and they're not easy to find.

884
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,200
Besides, l, I feel I need
something different,
a new experience.

885
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,700
All right,
if you want a flop,
have it on your own time.

886
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,200
I wrote my play for you.
I tailored it
to your every mood.

887
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,200
I never wrote
better laughs
in my life!

888
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,200
And you tell me
you want controversy.
Hmph!

889
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,200
It may sound ungrateful,
after all you've done for me.

890
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,200
You're right.
It is ungrateful.

891
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,200
But then I never
expected gratitude.

892
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,600
Personally,
I couldn't stand it.

893
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,100
May I have
my property back?

894
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,400
Of course.

895
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,200
Good luck, David.

896
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,700
I know
it will be a hit.

897
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,700
It won't without you.

898
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,300
It'll never be done.

899
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Under the circumstances
I think it's best
if I destroy this.

900
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,500
- What?
- But Mr. Edwards...

901
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,500
There goes my pride,
up in ashes.

902
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,900
Well, good-bye.

903
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,800
What...

904
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,300
Just a theatrical
gesture.

905
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,300
He never makes less
than six copies.

906
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,500
Wasn't she great?

907
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,500
You're going to join us,
aren't you?
No.

908
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,800
Just wish her all the luck
in the world for me.

909
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,800
Tell her
I was wrong.

910
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,000
Oh, Annie,
wasn't Mother
just wonderful?

911
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,800
Susie! Susie, wait!
I've got to hurry.
Mama's bringing them all home.

912
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,000
Sarah Jane!

913
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh, yes!
Thank you.

914
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,000
Oh, that's very sweet.
Darling,
you were wonderful.

915
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:07,800
How sweet.
Wasn't it... Steve!

916
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,600
Hello, Lora.
And congratulations.

917
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,200
Oh, Steve,
I can't believe it.

918
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,200
Oh, Lora, I'd... I'd like you
to know Louise Morton.
How do you do?

919
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,200
How do you do,
Miss Meredith?
I loved your performance.

920
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,200
Thank you very much.

921
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,300
Um, Steve Archer,
everybody.

922
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,800
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

923
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,300
A very old
and dear friend.

924
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,600
Oh, and, uh,
Miss Morton.

925
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,100
- Hi. Hello.
- Nice meeting you.

926
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,300
Oh, Steve,
it's been so long.

927
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,300
Ten years.
Oh, and you haven't
changed a bit.

928
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,300
How are Annie
and the kids?
Oh, Annie's fine.

929
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,300
You'd never know
the children, they're
so grown-up and lovely.

930
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,300
Uh, look, we're
all going to my house
to wait for the reviews.

931
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,800
- Why don't you join us?
- Well, let's get going.

932
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,300
You mind us
riding with you folks?
Fine. We have plenty of room.

933
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,300
That'd be nice.
All right.

934
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,400
Mmm. I'm glad
the opening's over.

935
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Now I hope Mother will
have some time for me
before my graduation.

936
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,400
I have a lot of subjects
I wanna discuss with her.
I don't want to forget any.

937
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Annie, do you wanna
hear them?
Sure, honey.

938
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,200
The most important
is Jane Beeler's party.
There are gonna be boys.

939
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,700
And under that
I have an "A" and a "B"
I wanna discuss with Mother.

940
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,700
A... How do I make
a boy like me, and B...
Should I let him kiss me.

941
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,700
Isn't that subject
comin' up a little soon?

942
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,900
The girls in school
discuss it all the time.

943
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
My goodness!
They're here already!

944
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,800
Honey, will you run upstairs
and get Sarah Jane?
All right.

945
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,700
All right, ma'am?
It's wonderful.

946
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,700
Thank you.

947
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,400
Annie, are you ready
for a surprise?

948
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Wait till you see
who's here.

949
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,500
Hello, Annie.

950
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,500
Why, Mr. Steve!

951
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,600
Oh, my goodness!
I'll get you
a drink.

952
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,600
You certainly
look fine!

953
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,200
You too, Annie.
How's everything been?

954
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,700
Each day
I count my blessings.

955
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,200
You call doing this
at 1:00 in the morning
a blessing?
Yes, sir.

956
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,700
I can remember when plenty
of ham and eggs was more
than a blessing.

957
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,700
It was a miracle.

958
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,200
Here you are.
Scotch and water.
I remembered.

959
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,200
Thanks, but I'd better
get back to Louise.

960
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
She won't even
know you're there.

961
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,700
She's being mesmerized
by Allen Loomis.

962
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,200
Oh, Steve, it's good
to have you here.
I mean it.

963
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,700
Now that we
finally have you back,
we will not let you go.

964
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,200
No, sir, you're
gonna stay with us.
Listen.

965
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,900
I have this Sunday off,
the first Sunday I've had
in weeks.

966
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,800
We're going to drive into
the country for a picnic,
Susie, Sarah Jane and Annie.

967
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,700
How does that sound?
Wonderful.

968
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,800
Steve!
I heard your voice!

969
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,800
Ohh!

970
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,600
This can't be Susie.
So pretty, and not
little anymore.

971
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,600
Little?
Why, I'm graduating
in two weeks!

972
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,800
You'll come, won't you?
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

973
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,800
Sarah Jane,
look who's here.

974
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,100
Sarah Jane?
Hello, Steve.

975
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,700
It can't be.
Why, you were all legs.

976
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,900
I still have them.
Yes, but they
came up to here.

977
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,400
Steve, don't ever
go away from us again.
Will you promise?

978
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,500
Well, are we holding
the party in here?
Hi, Annie, Sarah Jane.

979
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,500
No, Allen,
we're coming right out.

980
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,700
What a surprise
to see you.
Wonderful
to see you again.

981
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,700
You have an open invitation
to come here any time you can
get away from Madison avenue.

982
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,800
Oh, yes, not just anytime,
but all the time.
Come on.

983
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,400
Even though it is
a long drive.

984
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:07,500
You forget I used to walk up
three flights of stairs to
see you in the old days.

985
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,400
Oh, Mama, look!
A falling star!

986
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,100
The food's on.

987
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,300
Excuse me.

988
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,400
Did you wish on it?
Mm-hmm.

989
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,100
I wish it could always
be like tonight.

990
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,100
All of us together.
Don't you?

991
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,300
Yes, my darling.

992
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,100
And I'm going to
do something about it.

993
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:50,300
I will not do another play
for a long, long time.

994
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,700
Ohh, Mama!
Come in.

995
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,600
We're goin' now,
honey.

996
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,600
If that headache ain't gone
in an hour's time,
you take another aspirin.

997
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,800
You hear?
Yes, Mama.
Have a good time.

998
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,300
Mama.
Yes, baby?

999
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,400
Tell 'em I'm... I'm sorry
I had to miss the picnic.

1000
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,400
Okay. Okay.

1001
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,000
But by the time I find Steve
the fire'll be just perfect.

1002
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
You let them alone.
Maybe they got things
to talk about.

1003
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,000
This is
a fine picnic.

1004
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:58,000
Sarah Jane announces
she's getting the flu.
Mom and Steve just go off.

1005
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:02,500
Oh, well, if this is the way
it's gonna be, I might as
well get on with my list.

1006
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:07,500
I can cross off pink sweater
for Elizabeth and yellow
sweater for Sarah Jane.

1007
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,500
Then we skip ahead
to algebra.

1008
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,500
Do you think another year of
that stuff is a good idea?
I sure do.

1009
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,000
It's gonna come in
mighty handy with prices
always goin' up.

1010
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,500
Which brings us
back to boys.

1011
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,500
What do you think
about kissing, Annie?

1012
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,300
Well, there's kissin'
and kissin'.

1013
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,300
I still take pictures
every chance I get.

1014
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,800
Still trying
to get them exhibited.
Stop hedging.

1015
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,800
What is your job,
really?

1016
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,800
I'm Vice President
in Charge of Advertising
for P.C. Beer.

1017
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,800
Don't tell anybody.
Why not?
I think it's wonderful.

1018
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,600
'Cause I'm quitting
just as soon as I can
wind things up.
But why?

1019
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:48,100
You ever get the feeling
that you're tired of
what you're doing,

1020
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,600
that it isn't all
you really wanted?

1021
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:54,600
Did you ever get the urge
not to do what you don't
want to do?

1022
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:58,600
To let yourself go
and follow the wind
or a star,

1023
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,100
maybe even
a dusty old rainbow?

1024
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,100
Yes.

1025
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,100
Well, that's why
I'm going.

1026
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,100
Where to?

1027
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,500
I don't know.
Around the world,
I guess, for a start.

1028
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,500
You going alone?

1029
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:17,200
I'm afraid so, l...
I went through my entire
little black book.

1030
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,200
Well, you shouldn't have
skipped my name.

1031
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,100
l... I don't know why
I said that, Steve,

1032
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,600
except that
I haven't been this happy
with anyone for years.

1033
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:33,300
You know I still have you
in my blood, don't you?
Oh, Steve, do you really?

1034
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,300
I never got over you,
Lora.

1035
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,400
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't.

1036
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,800
There's a kind of kissin'
that's not careless
and doesn't lead to harm,

1037
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,800
when the two people kissin'
are nice and right.

1038
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,800
Kissin' is part of
fallin' in love.

1039
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,300
The Lord
wants his children
to fall in love,

1040
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,800
when they're old enough
and got sense enough.

1041
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,800
Then kissin' is like
yeast is to bread...

1042
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,500
Pardon me, Annie,
but I'm starving.
Can't I please find Steve?

1043
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,500
Don't think
you'll have to.

1044
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,400
Steve! It's time
to cook the steaks!
Even Annie says so!

1045
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,400
Telling them
will be wonderful,
but Loomis, ohh.

1046
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,400
Why tell him at all?
He has a lot of commitments
he'll have to get me out of.

1047
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,700
Susie, will you go see
how Sarah Jane is?

1048
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,600
Tell her
I'll be right up.
Okay.

1049
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,400
Let me help you
with that.
Thank you, honey.

1050
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,000
Hello, Allen?
l...

1051
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,000
You've been trying
to call me?

1052
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,500
I'm sorry.
We've been out all day.

1053
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,100
When?

1054
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,600
Oh. Well, that sounds
simply marvelous, but...

1055
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,600
Uh, no, not for dinner.
I'm having guests.

1056
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,900
Why don't you bring him
for cocktails.

1057
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,400
Yes. All right.

1058
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,400
Steve!
Amerigo Felluci!

1059
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,900
The Italian
movie director.
Yes.

1060
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,500
Oh, he wants me
for the part of Rena
in No More Laughter.

1061
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:13,900
His agent is in New York
now to talk to me about it.
I see.

1062
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:17,400
- That means you'd
have to go to Italy.
- Mmm. Of course.

1063
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,500
Oh.

1064
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,700
Well, I'll have to
give a two-week notice
to the play.

1065
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,100
Yes.

1066
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,300
Well,
don't be so calm.

1067
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,300
They want me
for Rena!

1068
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,800
Well, who is she?
Only the best part
since Scarlett O'Hara.

1069
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,900
Sarah Jane?

1070
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,200
Sarah Jane!
Where have you been?

1071
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:11,200
I've been looking all over
for you! You're supposed
to be in bed...
Shh!

1072
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,300
Uh...

1073
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,300
Sit down.

1074
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,100
Cross your heart.

1075
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,600
You won't tell my mama?
No, I won't
tell Annie.

1076
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,100
W-Well, what is it?

1077
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I've been out.

1078
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,400
With my boyfriend.

1079
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:43,500
Boyfriend?
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend!

1080
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,700
- Where's he from?
- The Village.

1081
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:50,200
Oh. Did you meet him
in school?
School?

1082
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,200
No.

1083
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,200
There's an ice cream
parlor in The Village
with a jukebox.

1084
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,400
Yeah?
And he used to
stand outside,

1085
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,700
and every time I'd walk by,
he'd whistle!
No kidding!

1086
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,700
- But first I pretended he wasn't on earth.
-  Yeah?

1087
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,700
But finally I had to laugh,
and he followed me.

1088
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,300
And we started to talk.

1089
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,700
He's cute.
Really cute.

1090
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,700
Is he a colored boy?

1091
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,000
Why did you ask that?
Well, I don't know.

1092
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,000
It just slipped out.
It was the first thing
you thought of.

1093
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,000
I told you,
it just slipped out!
Well, he's white.

1094
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:33,000
And if he ever finds out
about me, I'll kill myself.
But why?

1095
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,800
Because I'm white too.
And if I have to be colored,
then I want to die.

1096
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,800
What are you saying?
I wanna have
a chance in life.

1097
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,500
I don't wanna have to
come through back doors,
feel lower than other people,

1098
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,500
or apologize
for my mother's color.
Don't say that!

1099
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,700
She can't help her color,
but I can.

1100
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,800
And I will.

1101
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,300
But we've always
talked things over.

1102
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,000
You never told me
this before.

1103
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Because I've never had
a boyfriend before.

1104
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,400
Because he wants to
marry me someday.

1105
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,800
A white boy.
Me.

1106
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:17,600
But how do you think
he'd feel, or his folks,
with a black in-law?

1107
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,700
What do you think people
would say where we lived
if they knew my mother...

1108
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,900
They'd spit at me.
And my children.

1109
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,900
Sarah Jane,
you know that's not true!
It is.

1110
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,400
That's why
he mustn't know her.

1111
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,900
I don't want anybody
to know her.

1112
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,900
What if he comes here?
He doesn't even know
where I live.

1113
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,400
I pretend I'm a...
I'm a rich girl
with strict parents.

1114
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,100
Well, he's bound
to find out...
How?

1115
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,400
I'm going to be everything
he thinks I am.

1116
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,700
I look it, and that's
all that matters.

1117
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,200
And you're not to say
anything either.
I won't. You know I won't.

1118
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,200
I never did, but...

1119
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,900
Sarah Jane,
if Mama ever found out
she'd never stand for it.

1120
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,900
I don't care.

1121
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,800
Your mother
doesn't own me.

1122
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,200
I won't be seeing you
before you leave,
so good luck in Italy.

1123
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,200
You make that sound
like good-bye.

1124
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,200
Why couldn't
we meet in Italy?
What for?

1125
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,500
You'll have a film.
You won't need me.

1126
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,500
But Steve, wait.

1127
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,800
You tell Susie I'll
be at her graduation.
Good-bye, Lora.

1128
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,600
Oh, Sarah Jane.
Yes, Miss Lora?

1129
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,600
I'm having
some people come
for a business meeting.

1130
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:54,600
Later the dinner guests
will arrive. Could you
help your mother a bit?

1131
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:57,600
Miss Lora,
l... l-I'd like to,
but I have a...

1132
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,000
A date?
Is it the Hawkins boy?

1133
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,000
Hawkins?

1134
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,800
Well, the Miller's chauffeur
down the road.
Why do you say that?

1135
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:10,400
I met him at the station
the other day
and he asked about you.

1136
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,400
No.
It's with someone else.

1137
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,400
Oh.

1138
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,900
- All right, you run along.
- I'll try to manage here.

1139
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,900
Oh, there they are.

1140
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,900
Look, honey, why don't you
go over to the party
at the church?

1141
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,900
They bore me.

1142
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,900
You're makin' a big mistake.
You're young. You shouldn't
be sittin' around.

1143
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,900
Miss Lora
feels the same way.

1144
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,900
She'll lend you
her car.
Oh, she will?
How nice of her.

1145
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,900
I'd be happy knowin'
you're meetin'
nice young folks.

1146
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,900
Busboys, cooks,
chauffeurs!

1147
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,900
Hmph.
Like Hawkins.

1148
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,400
No, thank you.
I've seen your
"nice young folks."

1149
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,500
I don't wanna fight
with you, honey.

1150
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,400
Not tonight.

1151
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,400
I don't feel too good.

1152
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,000
While I get started
on the anchovies,

1153
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
will you take this tray
into Miss Lora
and her friends?

1154
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Why, certainly.

1155
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Anything at all
for Miss Lora
and her friends.

1156
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:27,200
But signor Romano, why should
she need rehearsals?
Ma scusa, signor.

1157
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
You know her work.

1158
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,900
Felluci always insists
on two weeks' rehearsal.

1159
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,600
Pictures are a different
medium than the stage.
She will need rehearsal...

1160
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:42,300
Fetched y'all a mess
of crawdads, Miss Lora,
for you and yo' friends.

1161
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,400
That's quite a trick,
Sarah Jane.
Where did you learn it?

1162
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,900
Oh, no trick to totin',
Miss Lora.

1163
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,900
I learned it
from my mammy,

1164
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,900
and she learned it
from old massa 'fore
she belonged to you.

1165
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
Well...
Excuse me.

1166
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,700
Another drink,
Sr. Romano?

1167
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,000
Sarah Jane,
why did you do that?

1168
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,500
What's the matter
with you?

1169
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,800
Annie, did you see
what she did?
I heard her.

1170
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,400
You and my mother
are so anxious for me
to be colored.

1171
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,900
I was going to show you
I could be.

1172
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,200
You weren't being
colored.

1173
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,200
You were being
childish.

1174
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,200
I don't understand why
you would want to hurt
your mother or me.

1175
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,200
I told her
she has to be patient.

1176
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,200
Things will work out.
How?

1177
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,600
Miss Lora, you don't know
what it means to be...

1178
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,600
different.

1179
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:57,300
Have I ever treated you
as if you were different?
Has Susie? Has anyone here?

1180
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,600
No.

1181
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,600
You've been wonderful,
but...

1182
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,600
Then don't ever do this
to us again.

1183
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,500
Or to yourself.

1184
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,700
It won't solve anything,
Sarah Jane.

1185
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,000
Mama?

1186
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,200
Oh, please.

1187
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,500
Try to understand.

1188
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,900
l-I didn't mean
to hurt you.

1189
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,900
I love you.

1190
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,500
Oh, I know, baby.

1191
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,700
You're just like
a puppy that's been
cooped up too much.

1192
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,800
That's why I wanted you
to go to the party.

1193
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,700
Oh, Mama.

1194
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,200
Don't you see
that won't help?

1195
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,100
Lora, wait a minute.

1196
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,100
I didn't mean the whole thing.
I said...

1197
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,100
Sr. Romano, she won't
need rehearsal.

1198
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,400
Frankie, you're late.

1199
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,900
I thought
you'd never get here.

1200
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,500
Let's walk down
by the river.

1201
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,700
I wanna talk to you.

1202
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,700
We can talk here.

1203
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,600
Frankie, I'm...

1204
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,600
I'm having
trouble at home.

1205
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,500
Your mother?
Yes.

1206
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,400
Frankie, you said
you wanted to take
a job in Jersey.

1207
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,400
Couldn't we run away?

1208
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,800
I'd do anything
to be with you,
anything.

1209
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,300
That's not a bad idea.

1210
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,300
That's not
a bad idea at all.

1211
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,500
Just tell me
one thing.
Yes?

1212
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,500
Is it true?

1213
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,500
Is what true?

1214
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,000
Is your mother
a nigger?

1215
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,300
Tell me.

1216
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,800
Tell me!
What difference
does it make?
You love me!

1217
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,800
All the kids talking
behind my back!
Is it true?

1218
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,900
No!
Are you black?

1219
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,900
I'm as white as you!
You're lying!

1220
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,900
No, I'm not!
You're lying!

1221
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,100
No, I'm not!
I'm not!
You are! You're lying!

1222
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,400
Don't hit me!

1223
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,400
I'm not.

1224
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,000
Mmm.

1225
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,500
Oh, that felt so good.

1226
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,500
And I'm glad
the guests have gone.

1227
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,500
I'm glad you're not
going to Italy.
So am I.

1228
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,500
Felluci wanted me
in Rome in one week.

1229
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,000
But I won't miss
Susie's graduation,
not for anything.

1230
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,200
You know,
I can't believe it.

1231
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,200
Susie and Sarah Jane
all grown up.

1232
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:43,200
You and I have gone
through a lot together,
haven't we?

1233
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,700
The years are flyin'.
I'm getting old.

1234
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,100
You never sounded
so solemn before.

1235
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,300
Don't you feel well,
Annie?
Oh, just
a little tired.

1236
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,300
Well, do you need anything?
Any money?

1237
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,300
No, Miss Lora.
Thanks to you,
I'm well fixed.

1238
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,300
I've plenty to send
Sarah Jane to college,

1239
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,300
something set aside for her,
and enough for my funeral.
Oh, Annie.

1240
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,800
That funeral again.
Well, I'm gettin' on.

1241
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,800
That's the one thing
I've always wanted
to splurge on.

1242
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
I really want it elegant.

1243
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,800
Got it written down the way I
want it to be, all the friends
I'd like to have there.

1244
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,800
It never occurred to me
that you had many friends.

1245
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:27,300
You never have any visit you.
I know lots of people.
Oh, hundreds.

1246
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:30,300
Really?
I belong to
the baptist church.

1247
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,600
And I belong
to several lodges too.
I didn't know.

1248
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,700
Miss Lora,
you never asked.

1249
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,300
Mama, Annie, quick!
It's Sarah Jane!

1250
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,300
Oh!

1251
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,200
Sarah Jane!
Oh, my baby!

1252
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,400
Get some water and towels.
What happened, baby?
What happened?

1253
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,500
Leave me alone.
Honey, who did this
to you?

1254
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,600
Tell me!
Leave me alone!

1255
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,600
You've got to
tell me!
Who was it?

1256
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,400
It was her boyfriend.
Boyfriend?

1257
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,000
Yes. He found out
I'm not white,

1258
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,100
because you keep telling
the world I'm your daughter.

1259
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,900
Anything you can spoil,
you spoil!

1260
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,300
Stop that.
Stop it!

1261
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,500
Don't you talk
to your mother like that.

1262
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,000
I told you.
Lies don't help none.

1263
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,000
This always happens
when you lie.

1264
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,500
It wouldn't if you
weren't always around!

1265
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,700
Thank you.

1266
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,700
Are you sure Annie
will make it in time?
Honey, you know Annie.

1267
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,200
If she says she will,
she will.

1268
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,500
Oh, Mama, I'm so happy.

1269
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,500
You know, I never really
believed you'd be here.

1270
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,500
Are you sorry
about the picture?

1271
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,300
I'm only sorry I couldn't
bring your present with me,
but he's a little bit too big.

1272
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,300
He? Who's he?
Who's too big?

1273
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,000
That thoroughbred
you told me about,
the one you love so?
Yeah?

1274
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,700
Well, he's waiting
for you at home.
You mean he's mine?

1275
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,700
Yes!
Oh, Mama, thank you!

1276
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,000
Happy graduation, angel.

1277
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,300
Oh, Mama, look!
It's Annie.

1278
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,700
And Steve!

1279
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,900
Steve!

1280
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,500
Hi!
Susie!

1281
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,200
Oh, and Annie,
I'm so glad you've made it.

1282
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,200
Steve, you're such
a darling to come.

1283
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:35,600
I meant it when I said
I wouldn't miss it for the...
Lora!

1284
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,900
Hello, Steve.
I thought you were
in Italy.

1285
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Annie, why didn't
you tell me?
Slipped my mind, I'm afraid.

1286
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,300
This came for you
this mornin'.
Oh.

1287
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,800
Honey, Sarah Jane's
much better.
I'm glad.

1288
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,300
She's sorry
she couldn't come,
but she sends her love.

1289
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:53,700
I think I'm gonna faint.
This is the most exciting
day of my entire life.

1290
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,900
I never expected
you'd all be here.

1291
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,800
Oh, it's...
It's from Felluci.

1292
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,300
He still wants me
for the part, and he'll
wait after all.

1293
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,800
He's even made
my plane reservations.
I'm to leave in two weeks.

1294
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:08,500
Two weeks?
Oh, Mama.

1295
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,900
Oh! At least that time
will be ours together.

1296
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,900
Oh, don't look like that.
Felluci agreed to my terms.

1297
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,500
I can't turn him down now.
I know, Mother,
I know.

1298
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,900
Look, honey, your mama
feels worse than you.

1299
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,800
Girls, the exercises
are beginning. Come on!

1300
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,800
Darling.

1301
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,500
When do you leave, Steve?

1302
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,900
I don't know when I'll
be able to get away now.
Oh.

1303
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,100
Would you do me a favor?

1304
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:48,400
Will you look after my child
for me while I'm gone?
Please?

1305
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,700
I can think of nothing
I'd like better.

1306
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,800
All right?
Fine. Let's ride
down to the river.

1307
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,600
Thank you.

1308
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,900
Isn't this fun?

1309
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,600
I wrote Mother last week
and told her you were riding
like Audie Murphy.

1310
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,900
I'll wear my six-shooters
tomorrow morning.

1311
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,000
And your black tie
tomorrow night at Bocce's.

1312
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:45,500
Did we make it
definitely tomorrow?
You said Monday night.

1313
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,000
I hope you won't
be disappointed.
It's nothing glamorous.

1314
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,900
Disappointed with you, Steve?
Never. Come on, I'll race you
back to the old mill.

1315
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,800
I hope you won't
be disappointed.

1316
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,100
Oh, no. I think
it's romantic.

1317
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,600
Good evening.
A table for two?
Please.

1318
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,000
What a wonderful place
to end a perfect evening.
I'll have cognac and...

1319
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:24,100
Could I have one too?
Just once?
Mm-mmm.

1320
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,300
Maybe a little wine?
No.

1321
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:30,200
Coke. You don't want them
to lose their license,
do you?

1322
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,000
No, of course not,
but...
Shall we dance?

1323
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,500
Dance?
Oh, I'd love to, Steve.

1324
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:43,500
You know,
you're the only one that
I can talk seriously with.

1325
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,900
What about Annie?
I thought she was everybody's
Rock of Gibraltar.

1326
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,100
She still treats me
like I was a child, as if
I were just out of rompers.

1327
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,200
You don't.
Well, you're
almost a woman.

1328
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,400
Almost?

1329
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:01,000
Anytime you have anything
serious on your mind,
you try it out on me.

1330
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:05,700
Well, l...
I do have a problem
that's been bothering me.

1331
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,900
Let's have it.

1332
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,700
No. Maybe I shouldn't.

1333
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,800
I'll bet I know
what it's about.

1334
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,800
You do?

1335
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,400
Boys.
Oh, no.

1336
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,700
You were teasing me.
Yes.

1337
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:25,300
Steve, what's the proper
age for people to...

1338
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,400
Well, to get married?

1339
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,800
That is a problem.
I'm no authority.

1340
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,900
Isn't being in love enough?

1341
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,800
As long as it's
on both sides.

1342
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,400
But then at your age,
there's always
the possibility of...

1343
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,800
being in love with love.
No.

1344
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,400
No, it's real.
I am.

1345
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,400
In love?
Mm-hmm.

1346
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,200
Wanna talk about it?
Well, l...

1347
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,200
No. Not yet.

1348
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:00,600
Sometimes though, l...
I feel awfully lonely.

1349
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:03,700
Love is always a little
lonely in the beginning,

1350
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,200
especially when you're
not sure the other party
feels as you do.

1351
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,200
But it's heavenly, though.
Don't you agree?
I do.

1352
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:12,700
Marvelous.
No substitute for it.

1353
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,200
Oh, I'm so glad I'm alive.
I've never been so glad before.

1354
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,700
Every time we've been together,
it's been just perfect!

1355
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:24,300
You ought to go out more
with friends your own age.
Than go out with Steve?

1356
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:29,200
Annie, you can't believe
how much we have in common.

1357
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,900
Oh, it's Steve!
Now, you're not going out
without a coat.

1358
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I was going to
borrow one of Mother's.
Steve's seen all of mine.

1359
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Sarah Jane bought
herself a new one.
You can wear hers.

1360
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Oh, I'll be right down!

1361
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,000
Annie, I haven't seen
Sarah Jane in weeks.

1362
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,700
Does she like that new job
in New York?

1363
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,700
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

1364
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,400
The Head Librarian
thinks she's so good,

1365
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,700
why, she even gave her
a raise.
That's wonderful!

1366
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:00,400
She just wrote me the other
day and she said that...

1367
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,400
Oh, don't wait up for me.
I'm going to be terribly late.

1368
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,400
Good night, sweetie.

1369
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,200
Harry's Club?

1370
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,400
Hope I didn't keep you
waiting too long, Steve.

1371
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:26,400
Hello?
Is this the Manhattan
Public Library?

1372
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:30,000
Yes, it is.
May I speak to Miss Sarah Jane Johnson, please?

1373
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I'm sorry.
The library's closed.

1374
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,700
Yes, I know, but she's
on a late shift.

1375
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,100
Reclassifying books
after hours, she said.

1376
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,400
There's no one here
by that name.

1377
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,500
You have no one there
by that name?
No.

1378
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,800
Are you sure?
Absolutely sure?

1379
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,500
Yes, I'm sure.
No one.

1380
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,700
I see.

1381
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,900
Well, thank you very much.

1382
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,900
Thank you.

1383
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,100
Can I help you, lady?

1384
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:31,200
Is there a girl named
Sarah Jane Johnson
working here?

1385
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,800
Never heard of her.
Two?

1386
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:50,000
The loneliest word
I've heard of is empty

1387
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:55,000
Anything empty is sad

1388
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,700
An empty purse
can make a good girl bad

1389
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,100
You hear me, Dad

1390
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,800
The loneliest word

1391
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,100
I've heard of is empty

1392
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:13,100
Empty things
make me so mad

1393
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:18,600
So fill me up
with what I formerly had

1394
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,600
Now, Venus, you know

1395
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,800
Was loaded with charms

1396
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:31,300
And look at
what happened to her

1397
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:36,100
Waitin' around
she's minus two arms

1398
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,800
Could happen to me
no, sir

1399
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,300
Now is the time
to fill what is empty

1400
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:49,900
Fill my life
brim full of charms

1401
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,500
Help me refill
these empty

1402
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,600
Empty, empty arms

1403
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,900
I thought you were great
tonight, really great.
Thank you.

1404
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,300
Where do you go
when you run out of here
every night?

1405
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,600
You got a boyfriend?
Could be.

1406
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:25,600
If you weren't such a cute...
Sarah Jane Johnson!

1407
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:30,600
- You put your clothes on
and get out of this place.
- Say, who is this character?

1408
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,800
I don't know.
I've never seen her
before in my life.

1409
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:39,900
Quit lyin'. You told me
you had a respectable job
in the library.

1410
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,800
Hey, what's going on here?

1411
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,200
Well, she must be crazy.

1412
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,300
Tell her
my name's Judy Brand.
Make her go away.

1413
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,500
Look, lady,
why don't you blow?

1414
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,900
You'd better keep out
of this. This girl here
is my daughter.

1415
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,600
And if you don't tell her
to go home with me,
her mother,

1416
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:00,600
I'll have the law on you.
Your mother?

1417
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,600
Well, I'll be.

1418
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,000
Go on, beat it.

1419
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,000
She's through, anyway.

1420
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,900
Sarah Jane.

1421
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,900
What did you
expect me to do...

1422
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,300
when I find you dancing
in that lowdown dive?

1423
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,500
If it ever got back
to the teachers' college...

1424
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,900
that you were mixed up
in such a place,
they would never let you in.

1425
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,100
I wouldn't be
found dead in a colored
teachers' college.

1426
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:47,300
Please, come home!

1427
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,000
We'll have some coffee
and we'll talk about this.

1428
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,200
Honey, nobody's all right
about anything,

1429
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,200
and nobody's all wrong.

1430
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,800
If you don't want to
be a teacher, all right.

1431
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,300
We'll talk about
what you want to be.

1432
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:04,300
Honey, Miss Lora gets home
from Italy in the mornin'
and I'm sure...

1433
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,300
Sarah Jane.

1434
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,000
Sarah Jane!

1435
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,800
Oh. Ooh, dear.

1436
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:34,300
Oh, Susie, darling!

1437
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,200
All the flowers!

1438
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,400
Oh, it's wonderful.

1439
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,200
I was never so glad
to be home.

1440
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,300
Annie was up
at the crack of dawn.

1441
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,200
Where is she?

1442
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,300
Well, I don't know.
Annie!

1443
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,900
Annie!
That's funny. She was
so anxious to see you.

1444
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,100
Annie?

1445
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,400
Annie, what's the matter?

1446
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,400
What happened?

1447
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,400
Is it Sarah Jane?

1448
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,500
"Mama, if you really
want to be kind,

1449
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,200
"really a mother,
don't try to find me.

1450
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:19,800
"Just pretend that I died
or was never born.

1451
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:23,300
"This is my life and I'm going
to live it my way.

1452
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,200
Sarah Jane."

1453
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,300
Darling, I'm sorry.

1454
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,500
We'll find her
and bring her back.

1455
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,100
No, Miss Lora.

1456
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:37,100
It's her life and I'm done
with interfering.

1457
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,200
All I'd like to know somehow
is where she is,

1458
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,300
so if she should ever need
anything, I can help her.

1459
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,900
Do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1460
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:49,200
No, ma'am.
I'll bet Steve will know
what to do. I'll call him.

1461
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,300
All right.

1462
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,900
You lie down for a while.

1463
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,900
We're going to take care
of you for a change.

1464
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,100
Hello, Steve?
Yes.

1465
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,600
Susie.
Let me have it.

1466
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,400
Hello?
No, this isn't Susie.

1467
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:17,000
That's right.
Oh, a few moments ago.

1468
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,900
Oh, it was wonderful.
Yes.

1469
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,400
And thank you for taking
such good care of my child.

1470
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,400
Yes, she is.

1471
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:29,600
What's he saying about me?
He thinks you're as cute
as a button, and you are.

1472
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,900
Only, Steve,

1473
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,200
something dreadful
has happened.

1474
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,800
When?

1475
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:40,200
No, I'll put a detective
agency on it...

1476
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:43,000
and I'll report
the moment I hear anything.

1477
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Good-bye.

1478
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:51,300
Then under the name
of Linda Carroll,
she got herself a job...

1479
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,100
in the chorus line
at the Moulin Rouge
in Hollywood.

1480
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,200
Where is she living?
At a motel nearby.

1481
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,900
Thanks, Mr. Steve.
I'm going out there.

1482
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,800
No, Annie, you can't.
You're not well enough.

1483
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,900
I'll go get her myself.
No.

1484
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,500
Miss Lora, I have to go.

1485
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,900
I've just got to see
my baby once more.

1486
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,500
All right, Annie.
I'll have my office make
your train reservations.

1487
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,600
Thanks, but I'm not
going by train.

1488
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,800
I'm going to fly.

1489
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,800
I'm in a hurry.

1490
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,400
What's up, honey?

1491
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:59,100
Oh. I don't know.
Just a funny feeling.

1492
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,800
Don't forget the guys
are picking us up at 12:30.

1493
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,800
I'll rush to the motel
and change. See you there.

1494
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:22,400
Door's open.

1495
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,100
I'll be ready
in a minute.

1496
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,700
I hope they're not here...

1497
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,400
Now, don't be mad, honey.
Nobody saw me.

1498
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,100
It was you.

1499
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:41,100
You were there tonight.

1500
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,100
Why can't you leave me alone?

1501
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:46,400
I tried, Sarah Jane.

1502
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,500
You'll never know
how hard I tried.

1503
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,100
Well,

1504
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,200
I might as well pack.

1505
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:59,200
Look, baby...
I suppose you've been
to the boss,

1506
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:01,800
Iost me my job,
my friends...

1507
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,500
I've been no place.
I didn't come to bother you.

1508
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,900
Well, you won't.
Not ever again.

1509
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,600
Spoil things for me here
and I'll go somewhere else.

1510
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,600
And I'll keep on going
until you're so tired...

1511
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,200
Baby, I am tired.

1512
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:18,600
I'm as tired
as I ever want to be.

1513
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:22,900
You mind if I sit down?
Yes, I do.

1514
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,300
Somebody's coming.
That's why the door
was unlocked.

1515
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,700
I'll only stay a minute.

1516
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:35,000
I just want to look at you.
That's why I came.

1517
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,000
Are you happy here, honey?
Are you finding what
you really want?

1518
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:41,800
I'm somebody else.

1519
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:44,900
I'm white. White!

1520
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:48,900
White!

1521
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,100
Does that answer you?

1522
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,100
I guess so.

1523
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,700
Then please, Mama,
will you go...

1524
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,900
and never do this again?

1525
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,900
And if by accident,
if we should ever pass
on the street,

1526
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,900
please don't recognize me.

1527
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:12,600
I won't, Sarah Jane.
I promise.

1528
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:15,700
I settled all that
in my mind.

1529
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:18,700
There's just one thing
I wish from you.
What?

1530
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,300
If you're ever in trouble,

1531
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,000
if you ever need
anything at all,

1532
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
if you ever want
to come home...

1533
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:29,000
and you shouldn't be able
to get in touch with me,

1534
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:32,200
will you let
Miss Lora know?
Yes.

1535
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,900
Yes, anything.
Now will you go?

1536
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,600
That wasn't all I wanted,
honey.

1537
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,800
That was only part of it.

1538
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,900
What's the rest?

1539
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,800
I'd like to hold you
in my arms once more...

1540
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,800
like you were
still my baby.

1541
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,200
All right, Mama.
All right.

1542
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,500
Oh, Sarah Jane.

1543
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,000
Oh, my baby!

1544
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:00,300
My beautiful,
beautiful baby!

1545
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,900
Oh!

1546
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,400
I love you so much.
Nothin' you ever do
can stop that.

1547
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,900
Oh, Mama!

1548
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,500
Oh, my baby.
Mama. Mama.

1549
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,300
Oh, my baby.

1550
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:23,000
Come on, Linda,
they're waiting.

1551
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:29,200
Listen, if you're the new maid,
I want to report that my shower
is full of ants.

1552
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:33,100
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
That must be very uncomfortable.

1553
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:37,700
But I just happened to be
in town and dropped in
to see Miss Linda.

1554
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:40,000
I used to take care of her.

1555
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:45,900
Well, I guess I'll
be running along.

1556
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:49,400
My plane's leaving
in a little while,
Miss Linda.

1557
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,600
Good-bye, honey.

1558
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,100
You take good care
of yourself.

1559
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,300
Good-bye.

1560
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,300
Mama.

1561
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:10,500
Well! Get you.

1562
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:14,500
So, honey child,
you had a mammy.

1563
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,500
Yes.

1564
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:19,600
All my life.

1565
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:31,800
Hello, Steve.

1566
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,800
Hello, Lora.

1567
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:38,000
Some of my girlfriends
get embarrassed
when their mothers...

1568
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,700
wear shorts or capri pants,
things like that.

1569
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,800
I really don't mind.
That's very big of you.

1570
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:47,300
I mixed you a highball,
but you only get one
before lunch.

1571
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:50,000
Yes, ma'am.
I just had a call
from Loomis.

1572
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:53,400
Don't say a word.
He's got a new role for you.
No, no.

1573
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,400
Highball?
Yes.

1574
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,800
No, they've flown over a print
of the Italian picture.

1575
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:01,700
He's arranged
a special showing tonight,
and a party afterwards.

1576
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,000
Darling, I'd like you
to see it too,

1577
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,400
but I'm worried
about Annie.

1578
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:09,600
Ever since she came
back from Los Angeles,
she's changed.

1579
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,900
Dr. Miller's quite concerned
about her condition.

1580
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,900
I think someone should stay
in the house with her tonight.
Do you mind?

1581
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,100
No, of course not, Mama.
I'll see you tomorrow, Steve?

1582
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,700
Sure.

1583
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,800
What can we do
to help Annie, Steve?

1584
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,400
There's no answer, Lora,
never has been.

1585
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,400
Not for a broken heart.

1586
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,900
Mmm, and I know Mother
didn't understand.

1587
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,300
Oh, it was so embarrassing.
And poor Steve.

1588
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,000
I mean, what could he do?
She just swept over him
like a tidal wave.

1589
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,100
Honey, it's only natural
he'd like to go out
with your mother.

1590
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:47,800
He always enjoyed her company.
You remember that.

1591
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:49,800
But it's different now.

1592
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:52,100
All summer long
it's been Steve and me.

1593
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:57,000
- Annie, you know, don't you?
- Know what?

1594
01:44:57,100 --> 01:45:01,900
That I'm in love with Steve.
I've always been in love
with him and always will be.

1595
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,700
Sure, Susie,

1596
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:07,100
but like a little girl.

1597
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:10,400
No. I don't think
it even started like that.

1598
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,700
In a funny way,
I always knew.

1599
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:17,700
Every time I thought
I liked a boy, it was because
he reminded me of Steve.

1600
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:21,300
And then I'd stop
liking him because...

1601
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:23,400
Because he wasn't Steve.

1602
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,800
Susie?
Are you up, darling?

1603
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,900
Yes.

1604
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,500
I just had to tell you.
I have the most wonderful news.

1605
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,500
You're going to do
another picture.
No.

1606
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:58,700
Not a picture,
not a play,
never again.

1607
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,800
Oh, I know you
don't believe me.
I can't blame you.

1608
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:06,500
Steve didn't either.
He probably won't until
our tenth anniversary.

1609
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,000
A-Anniversary?

1610
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:13,500
Oh, Steve and I have
always been in love.

1611
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:18,000
But it seems I've never
had time for anything
but my work.

1612
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,100
So I just up and proposed
that we get married.

1613
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:27,400
Well, Susie,
what's the matter?
Are you all right?

1614
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:31,200
Yes, I'm fine.
I hope you'll be very happy.

1615
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,100
Oh, we will be,
all of us.

1616
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:38,700
What is it, darling?
Tell me.

1617
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,300
I'm very tired.
Good night, Mother.

1618
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,800
Good night, dear.

1619
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:08,900
You know, Annie,
last night when I told
Susie the news,

1620
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,700
she was like ice.

1621
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,700
It's strange.
l... I thought she
would be ecstatic.

1622
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,700
She always seemed to...
To adore Steve.

1623
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,800
Something's wrong
with her, Annie.

1624
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,800
Do you know what it is?

1625
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,900
Miss Lora, you've got
to be very careful
the way you handle Susie.

1626
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,900
She's got
a real problem.
Problem?

1627
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,400
Why don't I know about it?
Why didn't she come to me?

1628
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:48,100
Maybe because
you weren't around.

1629
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:52,100
You mean, l...

1630
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,100
I haven't been
a good mother.

1631
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,100
I know you meant
to be a good mother,

1632
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,400
the best kind of mother,

1633
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:04,200
but look, I meant to
be a good one too,
and I failed.

1634
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:07,600
But you couldn't have been
a better mother to Sarah Jane.

1635
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:12,000
- Then where's
my little girl?
- But Annie, that's different.

1636
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,400
Hers is
a very real problem.

1637
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,500
What's complicated
Susie's life?

1638
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:19,900
We made a home for her;
the prettiest clothes;
the best schools.

1639
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
- Susie's in love.
- Oh, Annie.

1640
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:27,000
Is that all?
Why didn't you say so?

1641
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:30,200
It's not unusual for a girl
Susie's age to be in love.

1642
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:33,800
It's who she's in love with
that's causing all the trouble.

1643
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:37,500
Why? Who is it?

1644
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,500
Mr. Steve.

1645
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:45,000
What?

1646
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:47,500
That's impossible.

1647
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:50,300
How did it happen?
Why did he let it happen?

1648
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,700
I don't think he knows.

1649
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,200
Annie, it can't
be serious!

1650
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:58,200
It is, Miss Lora.
Plenty serious.

1651
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:01,300
I better have a talk
with Susie right now.

1652
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:03,400
Wait, wait.

1653
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:08,800
Susie.

1654
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:11,000
I've just spoken
to Annie.
Have you?

1655
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:14,400
Now I know why you were
so upset last night.
So Annie told you.

1656
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:18,000
That's how you usually
find things out about me.
That's not true!

1657
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,900
Let's face it, Mama.
Annie's always been more
like a real mother.

1658
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,400
You never had time for me.
By the way, is this
worded correctly?

1659
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,400
An application
to college?
Uh-huh.

1660
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:33,000
But you're going
to study in New York.

1661
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:35,400
Denver...
It's 1,500 miles away.

1662
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,600
1,628, to be exact.
That's quite a distance.

1663
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:40,900
I don't think
I'll be missed.
Don't be unfair, Susie.

1664
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,800
You know I'd miss you.
I'm sure you'd be too busy
to miss anyone.

1665
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,800
Much too busy.

1666
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:48,200
You give me credit
for nothing.

1667
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:51,000
Yes, I'm ambitious,
perhaps too ambitious,

1668
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:53,600
but it's been for your sake
as well as mine.

1669
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:56,600
Isn't this house
just a little bit nicer
than a cold-water flat?

1670
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:59,100
And your new horse.
Aren't you crazy about it?
Yes, but l...

1671
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:02,400
And that closet of yours...
Has all the dresses fit for
the daughter of a famous star.

1672
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,400
Now, just a moment,
young lady.

1673
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:07,700
It's only because
of my ambition that you've
had the best of everything.

1674
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:11,000
That's a solid achievement
that any mother can be proud of.

1675
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,000
How about a mother's love?

1676
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:16,300
Love? But you've
always had that!

1677
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,100
Yes, by telephone, postcard,
magazine interviews.

1678
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:22,300
You've given me everything
but yourself.

1679
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:27,000
No wonder I went to Annie
last night when I told her
about Steve.

1680
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:29,000
Oh, Susie.

1681
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,700
If Steve is going
to come between us,

1682
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,200
I'll give him up.

1683
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,400
I'll never see him again.

1684
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:44,200
Oh, Mama, stop acting!

1685
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:47,600
Stop trying to shift people
around as if they were pawns
on a stage.

1686
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:50,100
But, Susie, l...
Don't worry,
I'll get over Steve,

1687
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,600
but please,
don't play the martyr.

1688
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:01,700
Oh, Mama, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to hurt you.

1689
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:05,600
But last night
I was so unhappy!

1690
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:09,100
Oh, darling.

1691
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,600
l... I don't know.

1692
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:16,300
Maybe it was all
to the good because...

1693
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:20,300
this morning I felt
strangely independent and...

1694
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,800
Well, I like the feeling.

1695
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:25,900
That's why I think I'd...
I'd like to go away,

1696
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:28,000
at least for a while.

1697
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,700
Oh, Mama, please try
to understand.

1698
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,700
I'm very sincere
about it.

1699
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:39,500
Ah, it's funny
the way things turn out.

1700
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,500
Thank you.

1701
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,900
I still can't get over Susie
at the station yesterday.

1702
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,600
She looked so... grown-up
when she said good-bye.

1703
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:01,600
Yes, she did.

1704
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,400
It does seem awfully
quiet here without her.

1705
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,900
Annie and I were talking
about that last night.

1706
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:15,400
With both the girls gone,
we felt so alone
in this big house.

1707
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:18,000
When did this idea
of college come up?

1708
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:20,600
Susie never once
mentioned it to me.

1709
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:23,600
She decided suddenly.

1710
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:26,700
And why Colorado?
So far away.

1711
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,500
It's what she wanted.

1712
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:32,500
Miss Meredith, it's Annie.
She's terribly sick.

1713
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:35,100
Did you call
the doctor?
Yes, he'll
be right over.

1714
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:37,400
And she wants
the minister too.

1715
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,900
Oh, God, no!

1716
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:03,500
I hate to dispute you,
Miss Lora.

1717
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,500
Oh, Annie, don't talk.

1718
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,300
I've got to talk.
I've got to.
Oh, please.

1719
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:13,300
Please, not now.

1720
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:15,300
You stop crying.
But l...

1721
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:19,100
No, listen to me.
All right.
I'm listening.

1722
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:22,200
When my bills
are all paid,

1723
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:25,700
I want everything
that's left to go to...

1724
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,300
Sarah Jane.
Of course.

1725
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:32,300
Mr. Steve?
Yes, Annie?

1726
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:36,000
Find her, Mr. Steve.
Find her.

1727
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,700
I will.
You may be sure.

1728
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,500
I will.
Thank you.

1729
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,500
Miss Lora,
just tell her...

1730
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,000
Tell her I know
I was selfish,

1731
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,700
and if I loved her too much,
I'm sorry.

1732
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:55,700
But I didn't mean
to cause her any trouble.

1733
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,800
She was all I had.

1734
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:00,500
Tell her, Miss Lora.
Oh, please, Annie!

1735
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:04,000
Promise me?
Promise me?
I promise.

1736
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:06,400
Ohh.

1737
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,300
My pearl necklace.
Yes?

1738
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:13,600
I want you to give it
to Susie...

1739
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:15,600
for her weddin'.

1740
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:19,800
Give her a real
bridey wedding...

1741
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,800
with all the fixin's.

1742
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:26,300
Our weddin' day...

1743
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:30,100
and the day we die...

1744
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,100
are the great events...

1745
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:35,500
of life.

1746
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,600
Oh, Annie!

1747
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,800
Annie, darling.

1748
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,100
There's no cause to cry.

1749
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,100
- Reverend?
- Yes, Annie?

1750
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:54,200
I'd like for your wife
to have my fur scarf.

1751
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:58,000
She always admired
that fur.

1752
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,800
She never believed me when
I said it was genuine mink.

1753
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:05,600
She did, Annie,
she did.

1754
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:08,000
Oh, please,
you don't have to...

1755
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,300
And I want Mr. McKinney...

1756
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:14,200
to have a nice, clean
50-dollar bill.

1757
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:16,600
M-Mr. McKinney?

1758
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:20,700
The milkman at the old
cold-water flat.
Oh.

1759
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,900
He was so nice
and understanding
about the bill.

1760
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:28,000
I always send him
a little something
at Christmas time,

1761
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
in both our names.

1762
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,500
You've been so good.

1763
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:37,700
Sure hope you're right,
Miss Lora.

1764
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,800
I'd like to be standin'
with the lambs...

1765
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,900
and not with the goats...

1766
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,800
on judgment day.

1767
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:49,300
And my funeral...

1768
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:52,000
Mr. Steve,

1769
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:56,600
you'll find what I want
in the drawer...

1770
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,600
over there.

1771
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,200
I've got it, Annie.

1772
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:08,900
I want to go...

1773
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,800
the way I planned,

1774
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:15,500
especially
the four white horses...

1775
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:18,500
and a band playin'.

1776
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:20,800
No mourning,

1777
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:24,800
but proud
and high-steppin',

1778
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:28,200
like I was goin'
to glory.

1779
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:31,100
No. I won't listen.

1780
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:34,600
There isn't going
to be any funeral,
not for a long, long time.

1781
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:37,700
You can't leave me.
I won't let you.

1782
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:41,700
I'm just tired, Miss Lora.

1783
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:47,400
Awfully... tired.

1784
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:53,800
Annie!

1785
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,800
Annie!

1786
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,800
No!

1787
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:08,500
Soon I will be done

1788
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:12,900
Trouble of the world
Lord

1789
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:17,400
Trouble of the world

1790
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:21,300
Trouble, Lord
of the world

1791
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:26,500
I soon will be done

1792
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:30,600
Trouble, Lord
of the world

1793
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:36,000
I'm going home
to live

1794
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:41,300
With God

1795
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:46,100
No more

1796
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:50,800
Weepin'and wailin'

1797
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:55,600
No more

1798
01:58:55,700 --> 01:59:00,300
Weepin'or wailin'

1799
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:04,300
No more

1800
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:08,500
Weepin' and wailin'

1801
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,800
I'm going home

1802
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:17,400
To live with my Lord

1803
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:19,800
Lord

1804
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:24,000
Soon I will be done

1805
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:26,000
My trouble

1806
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:28,500
Of this world

1807
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:32,300
Oh, my trouble
in this world

1808
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:37,600
Lord, the trouble
in this world

1809
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:40,400
Lord, I soon

1810
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:43,000
Will be done

1811
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:47,600
The trouble
of this world

1812
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,600
I'm going home

1813
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:56,100
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh

1814
01:59:56,100 --> 02:00:03,600
To live

1815
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:12,400
With my Lord

1816
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:19,200
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

1817
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:23,600
"I will lift up mine eyes
unto the hills from whence
cometh my help.

1818
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:27,800
"My help cometh from the Lord
which made heaven and earth.

1819
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:30,800
"He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

1820
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:34,200
"He that keepeth thee
will not slumber.

1821
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:38,700
"Behold, he that keepeth Israel
shall neither slumber
nor sleep.

1822
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:41,700
"The Lord is thy keeper.

1823
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:44,800
"The Lord is the shade
upon thy right hand.

1824
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,100
"The sun shall not
smite thee by day...

1825
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:50,100
"nor the moon by night.

1826
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:54,100
"The Lord shall preserve thee
from all evil.

1827
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,300
"He shall preserve thy soul.

1828
02:00:56,400 --> 02:01:00,500
The Lord shall preserve
thy going out
and thy coming in. "

1829
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:03,300
Let me through!
Please!

1830
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,300
Please, let me through!

1831
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,900
Hey, stand back, miss.

1832
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,200
But it's my mother!
Stand back.

1833
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:18,400
I'm telling you,
it's my mother!

1834
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:21,200
Please.

1835
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:25,000
Mama!

1836
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:28,300
Mama!

1837
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:32,700
I didn't mean it.

1838
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,800
I didn't mean it.

1839
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,600
Mama, do you hear me?

1840
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:41,500
I'm sorry.

1841
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:44,600
I'm sorry, Mama.

1842
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:47,800
Mama, I did love you.

1843
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:52,500
Sarah Jane.
Sarah Jane, don't!

1844
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,300
Miss Lora.

1845
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:00,500
Miss Lora,
I killed my mother.

1846
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:02,500
I killed her.

1847
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:05,400
I wanted to come home.
Shh.

1848
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:09,200
Now she'll never know how much
I wanted to come home.
Come with us.
