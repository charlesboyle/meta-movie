1
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,323
January 11th at 2:30 p. m....

2
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:41,035
You'll do your statement separately.
This one's ours.

3
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:44,705
...following a verbal dispute
in Brooklyn Bridge Park...

4
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:49,460
...Zachary Cowan, age 11,
and armed with a stick...

5
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,798
...struck our son, Ethan Longstreet,
in the face.

6
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,427
Ln addition to the swelling and bruising
of Ethan's upper lip...

7
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,557
...this act also resulted in
two broken incisors...

8
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,686
...including nerve damage
to the right incisor.

9
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,437
"Armed"?

10
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,774
Armed. What...?
You don't like "armed"?

11
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,610
Michael, what could we say?
"Carrying"? "Holding"?

12
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,904
- Carrying a stick? All right?
- Carrying, yeah.

13
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,240
- Carrying a stick.
- Carrying.

14
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,910
It's ironic.

15
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,664
I always thought Brooklyn Bridge Park
was so safe compared to Hillside.

16
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,125
True. We always said,
"Brooklyn Bridge Park, fine.

17
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,252
Hillside, no way."

18
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,630
- It just goes to show you.
- Thank you.

19
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,757
Hey, thank you so much for coming.

20
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:42,221
It's so much better than getting
caught up in that adversarial mind-set.

21
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,557
Well, we thank you. Really.

22
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,476
I don't think there's any reason
for us to thank each other.

23
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,855
Luckily, some of us still have
a sense of community. Right?

24
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,441
Though the kids haven't got
that notion straight yet.

25
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,110
- Right.
- I mean our kid.

26
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,988
Right, our kid.

27
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,577
Thank you.

28
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,621
Those tulips are gorgeous.

29
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,207
Oh, it's the florist up by Henry.
You know the one? All the way up.

30
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,459
Oh, right.

31
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,794
Yeah. They fly the bulbs
right in from Holland.

32
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,672
- Twenty dollars for a whole bunch.
- Ls that a fact?

33
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,966
Yeah. Do you know it?
All the way up.

34
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,177
Right. Right.

35
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:25,181
Well.... So, what about the tooth
with the damaged nerve?

36
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,391
Well, we don't know yet.

37
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:31,062
There's some question
about the prognosis. Apparently....

38
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,023
Well, apparently the nerve
is not completely exposed.

39
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,026
- Only part of it is exposed.
- There's a part that's exposed...

40
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,528
...and then there's a part
that's still protected.

41
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,572
For now,
they're not gonna devitalize it.

42
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,407
They wanna give the tooth
a chance.

43
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,493
Yeah. We'd so love
to avoid a root canal.

44
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:46,786
Oh, of course.

45
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,331
There's an observation period while
they give the nerve a chance to heal.

46
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,666
He's gonna need caps.

47
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,210
- You can't have implants till you're 18.
- You can't.

48
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,380
Yeah, so.... They can only do implants
once they're done growing.

49
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,714
Naturally.

50
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,968
Well, we hope
it all turns out all right.

51
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,928
One can only hope.

52
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,763
Listen....

53
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,308
He didn't wanna tell on Zachary.

54
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,227
No, he didn't wanna tell.

55
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:17,942
It was incredible to see this child
with no face left, no teeth.

56
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,278
- He just wouldn't talk.
- I can just imagine.

57
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,782
He didn't wanna tell on the kid.
His friends would say he's a snitch.

58
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,451
Let's face it, Penny,
it wasn't just a sense of honor.

59
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,621
Well, you could say that.
Honor requires a social context.

60
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,791
So how did you finally get
Zachary's name?

61
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,210
Well, because
we explained to Ethan...

62
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,130
...that protecting this child
was not gonna help him.

63
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,009
We told him if this kid thinks he can get
away with hitting, why should he stop?

64
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,429
We told him if we were this child's
parents, we would wanna know.

65
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,849
- Of course.
- Yeah. Excuse me one second.

66
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,100
- Yes, Walter.
- Alan.

67
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,602
Well, thanks for getting back to me.

68
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,189
It's in this morning's Journal.
I'll read it to you.

69
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,443
"According to a study published
by British journal Lancet..."

70
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,530
...two Australian researchers have
identified neurological side effects...

71
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,742
...of TW Pharma's
anti-hypertension medication Antril...

72
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,661
"...including impaired hearing
and ataxia."

73
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,538
How come nobody
told me about this?

74
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,749
Who does your press monitoring
over there?

75
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,251
- This is gonna mean trouble.
- You're in deep shit.

76
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,503
What do we do?
Do we move on this right away?

77
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,505
No, no. My problem is the ASM.

78
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,341
You got an annual stockholders'
meeting in two weeks.

79
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,677
Did you schedule a contingency
for litigation?

80
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,971
I'm not sure. I have to check.

81
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,890
- Walter. Walter.
- Yeah?

82
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,393
Talk to PR. Find out if it was picked up
anywhere else and call me back.

83
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,562
- Right.
- Okay.

84
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,565
- Sorry.
- So you're, like, a....

85
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,275
An attorney.

86
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,278
- And yourself?
- Housewares supply.

87
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,864
Penny's a writer.
She works part-time in a bookstore.

88
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,742
- Mostly art books and history books.
- A writer?

89
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,412
Well, I cowrote a volume
on Sabaean civilization...

90
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,748
...working with artifacts
that were retrieved...

91
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,917
...after the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict.

92
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,504
But right now I'm working on
a book about the Darfur tragedy.

93
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,672
Do you specialize in Africa?

94
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,258
I'm interested
in that part of the world, yes.

95
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,260
And do you have
any other children?

96
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,845
There's Courtney. She's 9.

97
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,306
She's very angry
with her father right now...

98
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,351
...because he got rid of the hamster
last night.

99
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,396
- You got rid of the hamster?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,565
The thing was making
such a racket at night.

101
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,194
They sleep during the day.
It was driving Ethan crazy, so...

102
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,115
You know, he couldn't take the racket
that thing was making. Yeah.

103
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,534
I don't mind telling you,
I've been wanting to...

104
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,744
...get rid of the thing
for the longest time.

105
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,872
Finally I said, "That's it!"
Took it out, left it on the street.

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,290
You left it on the street?

107
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,334
I figured it was
a gutter-sewer animal...

108
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,712
...but the thing was scared out
of its wits out there on the sidewalk.

109
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,673
They're not pets
and they're not wild.

110
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,925
You drop them in the forest,
still not happy.

111
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,302
I don't know where
you're supposed to put them.

112
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,179
So you just left him outside?

113
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,806
Yeah, he did.

114
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,684
He tried to convince Courtney
that the hamster ran away...

115
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,686
...which of course,
she was not buying.

116
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,729
And this morning
the hamster was gone?

117
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,314
Gone.

118
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,859
What about you?
What do you do for a living?

119
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,319
Oh, I'm an investment broker.

120
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,993
Let me...
I'm just gonna ask this directly.

121
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,829
Could Zachary apologize to Ethan?

122
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,915
Sure. It would be good
if they talked.

123
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,042
No, he's got to apologize, Alan.

124
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,211
He has to actually say he's sorry.

125
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,172
- Yeah, probably.
- Well, is he sorry?

126
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,132
He doesn't realize
how serious it was.

127
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,259
He's 11 years old.

128
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,094
Well, 11's not a baby.

129
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,096
Well, it's not an adult either.

130
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,849
We forgot to ask you guys,
you want some coffee or tea?

131
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,728
Ls there any of that cobbler left,
Penny? She makes a mean cobbler.

132
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,813
- You got espresso?
- We do.

133
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,649
- I wouldn't mind a cup.
- Glass of water.

134
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,320
Yeah. I'll take an espresso too, babe.
And bring the cobbler. Come on in.

135
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,119
Please. Please, have a seat.
Have a seat.

136
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,247
I didn't mean to rush you out.
Here. Here.

137
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,041
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

138
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,543
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,676
You gotta taste this cobbler.

140
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,137
Where's the cobbler?

141
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,687
She put the cobbler
in the fridge again.

142
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,899
I don't know what language I'm
supposed to speak to that woman in.

143
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,069
Nice couple.

144
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,904
Very.

145
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,448
They're nice, right?

146
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,659
Do you tell everybody I'm a writer?

147
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,994
You are a writer. You wrote a book.

148
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,542
Good cobbler is not easy to make.

149
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,255
What do you sell?

150
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,926
Decorative hardware. Door locks,
handles, copper fittings and...

151
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,302
That's... Thank you.

152
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,931
And kitchen equipment.
Pots and pans. Yeah.

153
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,724
Ls that a good living?

154
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,186
You know, it's not like we had
any banner years or anything.

155
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,813
It was tough starting out.

156
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,816
As long as I'm out there
every morning with my sample case...

157
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,526
...and my catalog, it's a living.

158
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:14,571
Although the cast-iron roasting pans
do pick up around the holidays.

159
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,864
Yeah.

160
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,617
When you saw that a hamster
was terrified...

161
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,452
...why didn't you bring it home?

162
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,913
Because I don't touch those things.

163
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,957
You put it on the sidewalk.

164
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,251
It was in a cage,
so I flipped it on its side.

165
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,420
There's no way
I'm touching those things.

166
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,505
- Sugar?
- No sugar.

167
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,882
What kind of cobbler
did you make?

168
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,801
Apple and pear.

169
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,386
Apple and pear?

170
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,681
Yeah. It's, you know...
It's a little recipe of mine.

171
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,891
But it's a shame it's cold.

172
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,186
Apple and pear. That's new to me.

173
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,732
Apple and pear is a classic.
Of course, there's a twist to it.

174
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,941
Oh, really?

175
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,570
You have to cut the pears thicker than
the apples because they cook faster.

176
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,196
Oh, right.

177
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,199
- She's not telling you the real secret.
- Let them taste it.

178
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,119
Very good. Very good.

179
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,372
- Delicious.
- Gingerbread crumbs.

180
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,291
Oh, my God.

181
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,336
Well, it's really just a souped-up
old-school recipe.

182
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,837
His mother gave me the idea.

183
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,257
Gingerbread. Fantastic.

184
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,677
At least we get a new recipe
out of this, right?

185
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,514
I wish my son didn't have to
lose two teeth in the process.

186
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,099
Right. That's what I meant.

187
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,976
You have a novel way
of expressing it.

188
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,771
No, hey, I... Excuse me.

189
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,440
Yeah, Walter.

190
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,737
No. No, no. No letters to the editor.

191
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,116
You'll just fan the flames.

192
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,828
- Well, was it scheduled?
- No.

193
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,538
We decided to let it go.

194
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,541
What are these disorders anyway?
What is ataxia?

195
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,212
It's lack of balance
and unsteady or jerky gait.

196
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,715
- ln normal doses?
- Ln normal doses, rarely.

197
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,843
- How long have you known this?
- Two years, two and a half years.

198
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,137
And in all that time,
you haven't recalled it?

199
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,472
You're joking, right?

200
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,100
What are we talking about
in revenues?

201
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,520
Oh, I see.

202
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,689
Okay.

203
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,444
Al. We're all waiting for you.

204
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,656
Yeah, right. One second.

205
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,742
- Dennis?
- Did you talk to him?

206
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,412
They've known about the risks
for two and a half years.

207
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,705
- Jesus!
- Yeah.

208
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,250
An internal report.

209
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,504
But the undesirable side effects
are not established.

210
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,756
No precautionary measures.

211
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,759
They didn't schedule a reserve.
Nothing in the annual report.

212
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,554
I can't believe it.
What are the symptoms?

213
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,640
Lack of balance, jerky gait.
The works.

214
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,518
Basically, you look like you're drunk.

215
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,567
Roughly half a billion in revenues.

216
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,654
- You there?
- Yeah. What'd you advise him to do?

217
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,282
- Well, deny.
- Of course.

218
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,201
That dumb shit wanted us
to write a letter to the editor.

219
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,744
No way we're writing a letter.

220
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,373
On the other hand,
if we see this is getting picked up...

221
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,417
...we could do a press release...

222
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,128
...like "somebody's spreading
false rumors two weeks..."

223
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,754
"...from the ASM" kind of thing.

224
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,424
- Want me to broach it with him?
- No, he's calling back.

225
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,634
We'll talk and then work
on a press release.

226
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,136
Okay.

227
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,266
I've been so busy,
I hardly had time for lunch.

228
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,853
Help yourself. Help yourself. Here.

229
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,439
- Here.
- Thanks.

230
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,275
No, no. Go on. Go on.

231
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,903
I know I have no manners.

232
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,446
Where were we?

233
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,907
We were saying it would
have been so much nicer...

234
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,075
...if we'd met some other way.

235
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,285
This cobbler, right.

236
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,037
- So your mother, huh?
- His mother.

237
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,247
It's my mother's recipe.
Pen made it.

238
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,833
Your mother doesn't use
apples and pears.

239
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,126
No.

240
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,587
She's about to have an operation.
Poor thing.

241
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,797
- Oh, really? What for?
- Her knee.

242
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,843
She's gonna get a
polyethylene and metallic prosthesis.

243
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,805
And she's all worried about what's
gonna be left of it after the cremation.

244
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,599
Michael, don't be mean.

245
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,935
She doesn't wanna be buried
next to my father.

246
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,103
She wants to be cremated
and put upstate...

247
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,231
...next to her mother who's all alone.

248
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,360
Couple of urns jabbering away
on the shores of Lake Sebago.

249
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,450
We're very touched
by how generous you're being.

250
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,286
We realize how you're trying
to smooth things out here...

251
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,789
...instead of making them worse.

252
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,666
Please. It's the least we can do.

253
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,376
Yeah.

254
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,964
No, come on. I mean, so many parents
just take their kid's side...

255
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,466
...acting like children themselves.

256
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,677
If Ethan had broken
two of Zachary's teeth...

257
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,513
...Alan and I might have had
more of a knee-jerk reaction.

258
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,765
I'm not sure we would
see the big picture.

259
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,308
Sure you would.

260
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,602
- She's right. I'm not so sure.
- You would.

261
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,064
We all know this could have happened
the other way around.

262
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,608
What does Zachary say about this?

263
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,570
How is he experiencing it?

264
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,656
He doesn't talk much.
A little overwhelmed, I guess.

265
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,117
But he realizes that
he disfigured his schoolmate?

266
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:14,580
No. No, he doesn't realize
that he disfigured his schoolmate.

267
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,415
Why do you say that?

268
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,208
Of course Zachary realizes.

269
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,128
He realizes that this violent behavior
is unacceptable...

270
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,213
...not that he disfigured
his schoolmate.

271
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,841
You don't like the word,
but the word is appropriate.

272
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,218
My son did not disfigure your son.

273
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,845
Your son disfigured our son.

274
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,681
Come back after school.
Look at his mouth, his teeth.

275
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,099
Momentarily disfigured.

276
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,602
His mouth will be fine
when the swelling goes down.

277
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,022
As for the teeth, we'd be willing
to chip in for the best dental care.

278
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,231
We've got insurance.

279
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,567
What we want
is for the boys to patch it up...

280
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,861
...make sure nothing like this
happens again.

281
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,321
Let's set up a meeting.

282
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,823
- Yeah, exactly.
- Should we be there?

283
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,576
They don't need coaching.
Let them work it out like men.

284
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,578
Like men. Alan, don't be ridiculous.

285
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,080
On the other hand,
maybe we don't need to be there.

286
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,333
Maybe it's better
if we weren't there, right?

287
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,461
The issue is not whether we're there
or whether we're not there.

288
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,796
The issue is,
do they wanna talk about this?

289
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,298
Do they wanna work this out?

290
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,924
- Ethan does.
- Does Zachary?

291
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,094
- We won't give him a choice.
- It has to come from him.

292
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,429
Zachary acts like a thug.

293
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,140
We're not gonna wait around
for him to see the light.

294
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:19,895
If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive
context because he's forced to...

295
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,065
...I just don't see anything positive
coming out of that.

296
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,525
Mrs. Longstreet,
our son is a maniac.

297
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,779
If you hope he'll suddenly
and spontaneously get all apologetic...

298
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,946
...you're dreaming.

299
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,200
Look, I'm sorry. I really do have
to get back to the office.

300
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,119
Nancy, you'll stay.
You'll let me know what was decided.

301
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,788
I'm no use to anyone anyway.

302
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,582
Women always think you need
the man, you need the father.

303
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,167
Like it would do any good.

304
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,836
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I can't stay either.

305
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,382
My husband has never been much
of an "I'll push the stroller" -type daddy.

306
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,717
Well, it's too bad. It goes by so fast.

307
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,886
Michael, you loved
taking care of the kids.

308
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,056
- He had a ball pushing that stroller.
- Yeah, sure.

309
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,975
So, what did we decide?

310
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,229
Could you come over to our place
at about 7:30 with Ethan?

311
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,690
Seven-thirty all right?

312
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,775
Well, if you want my opinion....

313
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,318
Yes, please.

314
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,195
I think Zachary
should come over here.

315
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,365
- Yeah, I agree.
- The victim shouldn't make the trip.

316
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,783
- Yeah, that's right.
- Okay.

317
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,785
Well, I can't be anywhere at 7:30.

318
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,746
Who needs you?
You're useless, right?

319
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:23,291
Seriously, I think it's important
for his father to come.

320
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,502
Not tonight. Hello.

321
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,046
- Tomorrow?
- Hello? I'm sorry.

322
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,215
Can you hear me now?

323
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,554
There's not a word
in the annual report.

324
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,182
But the risk wasn't officially
established. There's no proof.

325
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,893
- Okay.
- Yeah, have him call me back.

326
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,353
Tomorrow?

327
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,981
Tomorrow I'm in Washington.

328
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,900
- You have business in Washington?
- The Pentagon.

329
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,528
Look, the main thing
is to get the kids to talk.

330
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,573
So I'll come over to your place
at 7:30 with Zachary...

331
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,992
...and we'll just let them
talk it through.

332
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,202
What? You don't seem convinced.

333
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,664
If Zachary hasn't acquired
any accountability skills...

334
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,417
...they'll glare at each other,
and it'll be a disaster.

335
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,545
Accountability skills?
What are you talking about?

336
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:13,133
- I'm sure your son is not a maniac.
- Zachary is not a maniac.

337
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,802
- Yes, he is.
- Alan, don't be an idiot.

338
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,929
- Why are you saying that?
- He's a maniac.

339
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,598
How does he explain what he did?

340
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,601
- He won't talk about it.
- He should. He should talk about it.

341
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,269
That's a lot of "shoulds."

342
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,606
He should come here. He should
talk about it. He should feel sorry.

343
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm sure you're much more evolved
than we are.

344
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,986
We're trying to get up to speed.
Ln the meantime, indulge us.

345
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,113
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

346
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,365
Come on. What happened here?

347
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,326
This isn't what we're all about.

348
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,369
I was talking about Zachary,
about him.

349
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,080
- Got that. Right.
- Alan.

350
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,751
You want some more coffee?
Some real coffee?

351
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,669
Coffee.

352
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,589
Thank you.

353
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,591
Coffee. All right.

354
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,803
It's okay, Pen. I'll get it.

355
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,635
I see you're an art enthusiast.

356
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,554
Yes.

357
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,182
Bacon.

358
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,518
Yeah, it's Bacon.

359
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,538
Cruelty and splendor.

360
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,708
Chaos. Balance.

361
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,588
Ls Zachary interested in art?

362
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,591
Not as much as he should be.
Your children are?

363
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,927
Well, we try to make up for what's
lacking in the school curriculum.

364
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,721
Right.

365
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,515
We try to take them
to concerts and to galleries.

366
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:30,812
We really believe that culture can be
such a powerful force for peace.

367
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,732
- You're so right.
- Ls cobbler a cake or a pie?

368
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,233
Here's an important question.

369
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,945
I was in the kitchen. I was thinking,
"Why should pizza be a pie?"

370
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,781
Oh, here, here.
Don't leave this miserable little piece.

371
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,408
Go ahead. Go ahead. Here.

372
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,619
Go on, you have that.

373
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,829
Cobbler's a cake.
No crust on the bottom.

374
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,539
It can't be a pie.

375
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,334
- You're a gourmet chef.
- I like to cook.

376
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,046
It's something you have to do
out of love or not at all.

377
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,592
The way I see it, if there's no
crust on the bottom, it's not a pie.

378
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,261
So how about you guys?
You have other kids?

379
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,473
I have another son
by a former marriage.

380
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,395
You know, I was wondering,
and I know this is not important...

381
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,023
...but do you know
what they were arguing about?

382
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,858
Because Ethan won't say a word.

383
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,277
Ethan wouldn't let Zachary
be a part of his gang.

384
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,530
- Ethan has a gang?
- And he called him a snitch.

385
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,866
Did you know that Ethan
had a gang?

386
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,036
No. But I'm thrilled to hear it.

387
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,580
- Why are you thrilled?
- Because I had one.

388
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,332
- I was the leader.
- So was I.

389
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,292
What does the leader of a gang do?

390
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,045
You know.
You got five or six guys who like you...

391
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,965
...are willing to sacrifice themselves
for you.

392
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,468
- Like in Ivanhoe.
- Exactly. Like in Ivanhoe.

393
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,303
Who even knows
about Ivanhoe anymore?

394
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,306
It's another role model,
like Spider-Man or whoever.

395
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,642
Apparently, you know more
about this than we do.

396
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,145
I guess Zachary wasn't
quite as silent as you first said.

397
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,524
So why did he call him a snitch?

398
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,944
Forget it. Silly question, right?

399
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,612
What's the point? We don't care.

400
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,281
We're not going to get into
these children's quarrels.

401
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,033
- It's none of our business.
- Right.

402
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,536
What is our business
is this unfortunate incident.

403
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,454
And violence is our business.

404
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:15,583
When I was the leader,
I beat up Jimmy Leach in a fair fight...

405
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,627
...and he was bigger than me.

406
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,505
What does that have to do
with anything, Michael?

407
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:21,840
No, nothing.

408
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,426
This isn't a fair fight.
These boys weren't fighting.

409
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,554
Right. I was just
remembering something.

410
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,681
It's not very different.

411
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,808
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, there's a difference.

412
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,144
- There is a difference.
- What's the difference?

413
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,438
Me and Jimmy Leach
agreed to fight.

414
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,398
- Did you mess him up?
- A little.

415
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,400
Enough about Jimmy Leach.

416
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,779
Look, do you mind
if I talk to Zachary?

417
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,114
Of course not.

418
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,575
I would never do it
without your permission.

419
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,952
No, talk to him.
That's completely fine with us.

420
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,662
And good luck with that.

421
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,664
Stop it, Alan.

422
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,291
Why do you say that?

423
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,126
- Mrs. Longstreet...
- Penelope.

424
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,920
I think we'll do better
on a first-name basis. Don't you?

425
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,841
Right. Penelope, you're acting
on the desire to educate...

426
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,635
I don't have to talk to him
if you don't want me to.

427
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,305
Go. Lecture him, talk to him.
Do whatever you want.

428
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,767
I don't understand
how you feel so uninvolved here.

429
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,269
- Oh, Mrs. Longstreet...
- Penelope.

430
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,938
Penelope, I'm very involved here.

431
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,775
- My son injured another child.
- Deliberately.

432
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,902
See, that's the kind of thing
that irks me.

433
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,278
We know deliberately.

434
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,864
- That makes the difference.
- Between what and what?

435
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,657
We're talking about one thing here.

436
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,659
Our kid picked up a stick,
hit your kid.

437
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,453
- That's why we're here.
- Fruitless.

438
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,581
Right. She's right, guys.
This kind of talk is fruitless.

439
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,667
So why do you feel you need
to slip in the word "deliberately"?

440
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,336
What lesson are you teaching me?

441
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,172
All right, this is getting silly.

442
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,758
My husband is all stressed out
over work stuff.

443
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,136
I'll come back tonight with Zachary,
and we'll let them work it out.

444
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,056
- I'm not stressed out in the least.
- Well, I am.

445
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:56,309
- There's no reason to be stressed out.
- Yes. There is.

446
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,019
Yeah?

447
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,692
Well, no comment. No comment.

448
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,570
No comment.

449
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,281
Well, what if I say that we were
awaiting confirmation?

450
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,701
What? If you recall it,
you're admitting liability.

451
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,037
Yeah, but that embolism thing
is weighing on me.

452
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,917
Recalling Antril
would be admitting your liability.

453
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:25,213
At Christmastime, in the school play,
what did Zachary play?

454
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,674
- Zachary played....
- Ebenezer Scrooge.

455
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,885
...accounting irregularities.
- Ebenezer Scrooge. That's right.

456
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,679
...in handcuffs two weeks
from now....

457
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,598
Michael, do you remember
when he played Scrooge?

458
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,225
Sure. Yeah, sure.

459
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,602
Yeah, he was wonderful.

460
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,479
He had that nightcap on.
He was funny.

461
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,357
Talk about the victims
after the stockholders' meeting.

462
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,652
- What did Ethan play?
- He played one of the kids.

463
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,488
- One of the Cratchits.
- The Cratchit kids. That's right.

464
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,868
We can't recall the drug because
three guys can't walk a straight line.

465
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,077
Right.

466
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,371
So for the time being,
don't make a move.

467
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,415
All right, all right.
I won't say anything.

468
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,751
All right. Okay, call you right back.

469
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,342
Hello, Alan?

470
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,637
They're in panic mode. They got
the media breathing down their necks.

471
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,347
All right.

472
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,893
I want a press release
that doesn't sound defensive at all.

473
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,645
Just the opposite. Go for the jugular.

474
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,357
Something like:
"TW Pharma is a target."

475
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,735
Attempt at manipulation
of the stock price...

476
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,321
...two weeks before
the stockholders' meeting.

477
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,573
And where does this study
come from anyway?

478
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,577
"How does this suddenly drop out of
a clear blue sky?" Et cetera, et cetera.

479
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,454
Not one word about the health issue.

480
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:43,374
Just one question:
Who's behind the study? Who?

481
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,711
- Got it.
- Fine.

482
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,464
Pharmaceutical companies.
The worst, right?

483
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,424
Profit, profit, profit.

484
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,553
Nobody said you should listen
to my conversation.

485
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,181
Nobody said you should
have it under my nose.

486
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,975
Wrong.
I'm totally forced to have it here.

487
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,852
Against my will, believe me.

488
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,981
Yeah. They just peddle the shit, right?
No one's responsible.

489
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,235
Ln any therapeutic advance,
there are benefits and there are risks.

490
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,820
Yeah, sure, I know. Still...

491
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,907
...you got some funny line of work.

492
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,619
- What does that mean?
- Michael, it's none of our business.

493
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,579
Just funny line of work.

494
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,666
- What about you? What do you do?
- I got a normal job.

495
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,167
What's a normal job?

496
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,253
I told you, I sell pots and pans.

497
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,629
And door handles.

498
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,590
And flush mechanisms
and a lot of other stuff.

499
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,718
"Flush mechanisms."
I like that. That's interesting.

500
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,345
Alan.

501
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:40,640
I find that interesting.
Flush toilets are interesting.

502
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,808
Why not?

503
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,643
How many different kinds
do you have?

504
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,144
There's two basic kinds.

505
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,605
You got your push button
and your handle-operated.

506
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,023
Yeah, right.

507
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,317
- Depends where your water line is.
- I see.

508
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,528
Either comes from the side
or from the bottom.

509
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,822
- Right.
- One of my managers is an expert.

510
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,573
I could introduce you if you want.

511
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,742
You'll have to hump it out
to Jamaica, Queens, though.

512
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,161
You seem like you know
your business pretty well.

513
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,123
Are you planning on sanctioning
Zachary in any way?

514
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,710
You two can have your plumbing
discussion some other time.

515
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,671
- I don't feel well.
- What's the matter? Are you all right?

516
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,798
You do look pale, honey.

517
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,509
You're all white, yeah.

518
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,973
- I'm nauseous.
- Some Reglan.

519
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,226
- We got some Reglan, right?
- No. No, no. I'll be fine.

520
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,146
A Coke. What you need is a Coke.

521
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,080
It's not cold.

522
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,583
- Mr. Cowan.
- It's not cold.

523
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,876
Thank you.

524
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,378
- Are you sure?
- Little sips.

525
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,255
The Coke wasn't in the fridge.

526
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,966
All right. Have him call me back.
Tell him right away.

527
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,594
- Okay, Mr. Cowan.
- Okay.

528
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,805
Ls Coke good for that?
It's more for diarrhea, isn't it?

529
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,724
No, not only.

530
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,642
Better?

531
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,398
I think so.

532
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,859
Mrs. Longstreet.

533
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,322
If we decide to reprimand
our child...

534
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,909
...we'll do it in our own way
and on our own terms.

535
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,370
- Absolutely.
- What, absolutely?

536
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,413
They're free to do as they see fit.

537
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,749
- I don't agree.
- You don't agree about what?

538
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,043
- They're not free.
- Ls that right?

539
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,920
Go on. Sorry.

540
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,380
Yeah?

541
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,174
- Great.
- We're writing the statement now.

542
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,051
Yeah, but don't forget.

543
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,012
Nothing's been proven here.
Nothing's certain.

544
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,640
Don't fuck this up.
If we don't get this right...

545
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,643
...Walter will be out on his ass
in two weeks, and so will we.

546
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,270
Enough, Alan!
Enough with the cell phone already!

547
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,107
The here and now, goddamn it.

548
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,943
- Call me back and read it to me.
- I'll call you back.

549
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:59,362
What's wrong with you,
screaming at me like that?

550
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,988
- Dennis heard every word.
- Good.

551
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,283
I am sick of that fucking cell phone,
every minute of every day.

552
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,620
Listen, Nancy. You should be thanking
me for agreeing to come here.

553
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,622
- Really?
- Oh, God.

554
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,582
- I'm gonna throw up.
- No, you're not.

555
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,626
- I am.
- You wanna use the bathroom?

556
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,670
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

557
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,755
She's right.
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

558
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,090
I feel dizzy.

559
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,093
Stare at a point in space.
Stare at a point in space, Doodle.

560
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,429
Hey, you can see
part of the el from here. Cool.

561
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,765
- Get away from me. Leave me alone.
- Shouldn't she go to the bathroom?

562
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,601
Go to the bathroom
if you have to throw up.

563
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,769
Give her some Reglan.

564
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,355
- It can't be the cobbler?
- No. I made it yesterday.

565
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,816
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy, Doodle.

566
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,944
Yeah, come on. Don't get
all bent out of shape over nothing.

567
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,613
My husband feels that
anything to do with the house...

568
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,450
...the school, the backyard,
is my domain.

569
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,660
- I do not.
- You do so.

570
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,372
And I can understand why.
It's all so excruciatingly boring.

571
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,999
It's excruciating.

572
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,002
If it's so excruciating,
why have children in the first place?

573
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,880
Maybe Zachary's picking up
on that lack of interest.

574
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:03,009
- What lack of interest?
- You just said yourself.

575
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,138
Go get a bucket. Go get a bucket!

576
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,773
Stupid bitch.

577
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,609
You should have gone
to the bathroom.

578
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,943
This is ridiculous.

579
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,987
- Your suit took a hit.
- What?

580
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,822
Couldn't be the cobbler,
that I know.

581
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,200
It's not the cobbler.
This is just nerves.

582
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,869
Do you wanna clean up
in the bathroom or...?

583
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,457
My Kokoschka.

584
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,543
Here.

585
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,421
Give her some Reglan.

586
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,256
She can't keep anything down.

587
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,634
Where's the bathroom?

588
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,845
I'll show you.

589
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:56,270
This is nerves. Just nerves.

590
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,742
Thank you.

591
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:13,955
It's like I always say, you can't get
over something while you're under it.

592
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,333
With me, it's the back of my neck.
I get all blocked up back there.

593
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,751
All right.

594
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,170
What do we do with the Kokoschka?

595
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,507
We can clean it. Maybe Lysol.

596
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,259
The problem is gonna be drying it.

597
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,219
Maybe plain water
and some cologne.

598
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,428
Cologne?

599
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,014
I got some of that Kronos stuff
I never use.

600
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,308
The paper will warp.

601
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:38,145
Then we'll blow-dry it and put some
books on top of it after to flatten it out.

602
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,315
Or maybe iron it, like dollar bills.

603
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,692
God.

604
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,152
- I'll buy you another one.
- There is no other one.

605
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,863
- It's been out of print for years.
- I'm so sorry.

606
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,616
We can save it. Pen, let me do this.

607
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,494
It's a reprint from the catalog
of the 1957 show in London.

608
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,581
Get the blow-dryer and the cologne
in the bathroom cabinet.

609
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,126
- Her husband's in the bathroom.
- He's not on the can.

610
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,921
Look, I got most of it off.
There's just a little left on the Dolgans.

611
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,641
Excuse me.

612
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,708
Are you feeling better?

613
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:41,917
Yeah.

614
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,586
What, should I spray or...?

615
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,004
Where's the blow-dryer?

616
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,256
He's drying his pants.

617
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,925
We'll wait. We should put the Kronos
on there last.

618
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,135
Okay.

619
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,928
Can I use the bathroom too?

620
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,431
Yes. Of course. Of course.

621
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,648
I don't know what to say.

622
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,776
I am so sorry.

623
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,286
Bring the blow-dryer
when you're done.

624
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,454
So sorry.

625
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,998
God.

626
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,126
Unbelievable.

627
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,213
Un-fucking-believable.

628
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,758
Her cobbler's horrible.

629
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,803
You stuffed your face.

630
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,641
Look at my day.
I gotta get some food in me sometime.

631
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:51,487
Oh, God.

632
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,699
Freaking nightmare.

633
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,285
He better watch it.
He's got me right on the edge.

634
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,663
- She's horrible.
- Less.

635
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,082
She's so fake.

636
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,875
She doesn't bother me as much.

637
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,127
They're both horrible.

638
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,714
Why do you take their side
all the time? Sorry.

639
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,757
I don't.
What's that supposed to mean?

640
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,552
What the hell are we doing here?

641
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,931
- I hope you're kidding.
- Why do you argue with her?

642
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,142
We'd have been out of here
a long time ago...

643
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,728
...if you didn't bicker
over every word.

644
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,189
Would you rather I was a sheep
like her husband?

645
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,316
Do you think it was the cobbler?

646
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,694
Of course it was.

647
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,865
A little warm Coke and:

648
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,243
Oh, fuck.

649
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,663
You're always mitigating.
You're trying to reconcile everything.

650
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,582
- I am not.
- You are.

651
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,542
You had a gang
and you were the leader.

652
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,836
They can do whatever they want
with their son.

653
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,338
Well, their son is a threat
to homeland security.

654
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,674
Kid like that,
when he's a menace to society...

655
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,176
...it's everybody's business.

656
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,512
And I can't believe
that she barfed all over my books.

657
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,182
When you know that
you're gonna toss your cookies...

658
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,018
...you take some precautions.

659
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,729
The Foujita.

660
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,773
Now it's disgusting.

661
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,525
I was right on the edge
with that toilet-flushing shit.

662
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,860
You were incredible.

663
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,654
- I held my own, right?
- Incredible.

664
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,823
Jamaica, Queens.
Now that was genius.

665
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,284
Little piece of shit.
What does he call her again?

666
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,496
- Doodle.
- Yeah, right. Doodle.

667
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:27,416
- Doodle.
- Yeah, I call her Doodle.

668
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,378
I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything.

669
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:36,258
You know, it's so easy to make fun
of other people's pet names.

670
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,512
Michael, what do we call each other?
I'm sure it's worse, right?

671
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,430
You wanted the blow-dryer.

672
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,681
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

673
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,936
We call each other "Darjeeling,"
like the tea.

674
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,273
It's a lot more embarrassing
if you ask me.

675
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,984
How is she feeling?
Ls she feeling better?

676
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,402
Yeah, better.

677
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,531
Yeah. I reacted badly.

678
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,867
- I'm ashamed. I really am.
- Here.

679
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:07,915
You know, I made a big deal
about the catalog, and I....

680
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,458
I don't even know why.

681
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,877
You get so absurdly attached
to these things...

682
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,672
- ...and you don't even know why.
- Pull it taut though.

683
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,841
- But hold onto the other side.
- I got it.

684
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,385
You gotta pull it
because there's wrinkles on that.

685
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,846
- The corners are wet.
- I'll get the corners.

686
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,224
- It's gonna tear.
- He's right. It's gonna tear.

687
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,059
- Okay. Well, here...
- It's dry enough.

688
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:30,938
Okay. Put cologne on those,
and I'll finish this one.

689
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,235
- So where does "Doodle" come from?
- Sorry.

690
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,612
Yankee Doodle
or Cheez Doodle or...?

691
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,990
It's from a song
from Guys and Dolls that goes:

692
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,410
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know that one.

693
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,878
- Yeah.
- Ours is from our honeymoon in India.

694
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,006
We called each other "Darjeeling"
instead of "darling."

695
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,133
It's so stupid.

696
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,385
Maybe I should check on her.

697
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,013
Yeah. Yeah, you do that, Darjeeling.

698
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,390
Oh, Nancy. Hey.

699
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,602
Well, I was worried about you.
Are you feeling better?

700
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,521
Yeah. Better. I think so.

701
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:16,275
If you're not sure,
stay away from the coffee table.

702
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:22,281
I left a towel in the bathtub.
I didn't know where to put it.

703
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,199
Perfect.

704
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,161
You cleaned up.

705
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,038
I am so sorry.

706
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,789
Everything's fine. All is well.

707
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:35,169
I'm sorry. I wasn't there for you.
I was so focused on the Kokoschka.

708
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,421
- That's all right.
- No. I...

709
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:41,008
- I behaved poorly.
- Please.

710
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:52,978
Ln the bathroom, I was thinking.

711
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,688
Yes?

712
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:58,567
Yeah, maybe we glossed over the....

713
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,402
The....

714
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,279
Well, I mean....

715
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,615
What? What is it?

716
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:09,536
Well, name-calling
is a kind of abuse.

717
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,789
- Sure.
- It depends.

718
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,415
Right. It depends.

719
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,709
Zachary has never been
a violent child.

720
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,670
He must have had his reasons.

721
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,797
Like getting called a snitch.

722
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,757
Excuse me.

723
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,385
Yeah, Walter.

724
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,514
Alan, CNN has invited me
for a panel discussion.

725
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,184
Well, as long as there are
no victims on the panel.

726
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,688
No victims. I don't want you
sitting down with victims.

727
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,314
Deny, deny, deny.

728
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,400
If we have to, we'll sue the Journal.

729
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,529
Well, we'll e-mail you the draft
of the press release.

730
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,657
Walter, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

731
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,368
Call me a snitch,
it gets a rise out of me.

732
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,078
- Unless it's true.
- What?

733
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,330
You know, if the shoe fits.

734
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:56,208
- You think my son is a snitch?
- Come on. I'm joking around.

735
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,085
So is yours anyway.

736
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,879
- What do you mean, so is ours?
- He snitched on Zachary.

737
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,882
- We coaxed it out of him.
- We're getting completely off point.

738
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,343
Maybe you coaxed,
but he did snitch on him.

739
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,262
- Nancy.
- "Nancy" what?

740
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,807
- You think my son is a snitch?
- I don't think anything.

741
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,518
Well, if you don't think anything,
don't say anything.

742
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,729
- Don't make insinuations.
- Nancy...

743
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,897
...there's no reason
to lose our cool here.

744
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,568
Michael and I have gone out of our way
to be fair-minded and conciliating.

745
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,778
Not so fair-minded.

746
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,740
- Really?
- Superficially fair-minded.

747
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,408
Doodle, I have to go.

748
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,369
So go. Coward.

749
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,623
Nancy, right now I'm in danger
of losing my most important client.

750
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,960
This "caring parent" crap and
the bickering that goes along with it...

751
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,421
Yeah, well, my son lost two teeth.
Two incisors.

752
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,923
- We got that, right.
- One of them permanently.

753
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,761
He'll get new teeth. Better ones.
No one chewed his ear off.

754
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,431
It was a mistake not to consider
the source of the problem.

755
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,599
There is no source.

756
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,351
There's an 11-year-old kid
who hits people with a stick!

757
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,520
- Armed with a stick.
- We took that word out.

758
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,355
Took it out
because we asked you to.

759
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,066
We took it out without argument.

760
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,401
A word which deliberately
establishes intent...

761
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,570
...without any hint
of a misunderstanding...

762
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,197
...which excludes childhood.

763
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,532
I don't think I can
stand this tone anymore.

764
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,328
We're not quite on the same page,
you and I, right from the start.

765
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,913
Mr. Cowan...

766
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,792
...it is incredibly frustrating
to be continually upbraided...

767
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,711
...for something that we, ourselves,
admitted was a mistake.

768
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,297
The word "armed" wasn't right.
We took it out.

769
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,050
Though, strictly speaking,
it certainly applies.

770
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,552
Zachary was verbally abused
and he reacted.

771
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,763
Now, if I'm attacked,
I defend myself...

772
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,557
...especially when I'm all alone
against a whole gang.

773
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,811
Well, you certainly perked up
since you tossed your cookies.

774
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,604
Do you realize how crude that is?

775
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,315
Look, we're all decent people,
all four of us.

776
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,110
I don't know how we got carried away,
losing our tempers.

777
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,113
- This is totally unnecessary.
- Stop it. Stop mitigating.

778
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,574
We're only superficially fair-minded.
Why should we be fair-minded at all?

779
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,785
No. No, I'm not gonna be led
down that path.

780
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:55,953
What path?

781
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,163
The path these two little shits
led us down.

782
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,541
- Pen doesn't see things that way.
- "Penelope."

783
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,502
- Sorry.
- So Ethan's a shit now.

784
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,629
That really takes the cake.

785
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,382
Look, that's it.
I really have to leave now.

786
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,175
Yeah. So do I.

787
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,804
Go. Go. I give up.

788
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,017
- Hello.
- It's me, Mikey.

789
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,436
- Oh, hi, Ma.
- Ls this a bad time?

790
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,273
No. No, we got some friends over,
but go ahead.

791
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,109
The surgeon told me to stop taking
my medication before the operation.

792
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,321
Yes. Yes, you just do whatever
the doctors tell you to do.

793
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,614
Yes.

794
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,700
The surgeon told me
to stop all of them...

795
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,537
...but Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.

796
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,539
- The what?
- The Antril.

797
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,875
Should I stop taking the Antril too?

798
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,962
Antril? You're taking Antril?

799
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,340
Wait, hold on a second, Ma. Antril?

800
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,342
That crap of yours is Antril?

801
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,804
- My mother's taking it.
- Thousands of people take it.

802
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,223
Mom. You gotta stop
taking that one right away.

803
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,225
- You hear me? Right now.
- Why?

804
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:04,521
Just do what I tell you. All right?
I'm gonna explain later.

805
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,566
No. Dr. Perlstein said
I could keep taking the Antril.

806
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:11,778
Mom, you tell Dr. Perlstein
that I said you can't take it.

807
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,947
I won't touch it, Michael.

808
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,532
Good.

809
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,827
- Why red?
- So they can see me.

810
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,705
- So who can see you?
- The cars. They all drive like crazy.

811
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,125
Mom, that's ridiculous. Okay.
Mom. Mom.

812
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,546
Mom. I have to call you back.
I told you we have company.

813
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,798
- Okay. I love you.
- I hope so.

814
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,926
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

815
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,472
She got red crutches
in case she gets hit by a truck...

816
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,933
...because she wanders out
in the street at night.

817
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,352
They're giving her Antril
for her blood pressure.

818
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,939
If she's taking it and she looks normal,
I'll take her deposition.

819
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,690
Didn't I have a scarf?

820
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,151
You know,
I don't like that attitude of yours.

821
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,487
If my mother shows
even the slightest symptom...

822
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,989
...my name will be on the top
of a class-action suit.

823
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,408
- We'll have one anyway.
- Well, I should hope so.

824
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,954
Doing the right thing is just futile.
Honesty's just stupidity.

825
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,331
It just weakens you.
You let your guard down.

826
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,709
Let's go, Nancy. That's enough
sermons and lectures for one day.

827
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,379
Yeah, go ahead.
But let me tell you this:

828
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,132
Now that I know you two,
I'm not surprised what's-his-name...

829
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,970
Zachary may have
some behavioral issues.

830
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,472
- When you killed that hamster...
- Killed?

831
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,349
- Killed.
- I killed the hamster?

832
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,310
Yes. You do everything you can
to make us feel guilty.

833
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,771
You stake out the moral high ground
as your own...

834
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,232
...but you, yourself, are a murderer.

835
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,442
I definitely did not kill that hamster.

836
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,652
- Worse.
- Worse!

837
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,781
You left it out there, trembling with fear
in a hostile environment.

838
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,118
That poor critter was probably eaten
by a dog or a rat.

839
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,620
- She's right.
- What do you mean, "she's right"?

840
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,955
I mean, come on. Michael.

841
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,791
It's horrible what must have happened
to that poor animal.

842
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,626
I thought the hamster
would be happy.

843
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,045
I thought he'd go running around
happy as a clam.

844
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,423
- Well, he didn't.
- And you just left him there.

845
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,800
Because I can't touch
those things, okay?

846
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,761
I can't touch anything of that family.
Penny, you know that.

847
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:03,724
- He's afraid of rodents.
- Yes. I have a fear of rodents.

848
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:07,769
And a fear of reptiles. Anything down
close to the ground. That's it. All right?

849
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:11,315
What about you? How come
you didn't go downstairs and get it?

850
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,066
Because I didn't know.

851
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,610
Michael said this morning
that the hamster ran away.

852
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,447
I went right out the door,
I went right down the block.

853
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,741
I mean, I went to the basement!

854
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,827
Penelope. It is completely unfair
that all of a sudden...

855
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,414
...I'm in the hot seat about this hamster
that you had to tell them about.

856
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,375
That is a family issue
that doesn't concern anybody but us.

857
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,502
It's got nothing to do
with this situation.

858
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,422
I can't believe I'm being called
a murderer in my own house.

859
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,216
What does your house
have to do with tea in China?

860
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,135
It's my house. I opened the door.

861
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:43,055
The door is wide open
in a spirit of reconciliation...

862
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,932
...to a couple people
who should be a little more grateful.

863
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,727
Keep right on stroking your own ego.
It's beautiful.

864
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,397
- So you have no remorse?
- No. I have no remorse.

865
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,025
That animal was disgusting,
and I'm glad it's gone.

866
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,361
- Michael, that's ridiculous.
- What's ridiculous?

867
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,488
What, have you
lost your mind now too?

868
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:03,158
Their son beats the shit out of Ethan,
and you're in my face over a hamster?

869
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,577
What you did was wrong.
You can't deny that.

870
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,537
I don't give a shit about the hamster!

871
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,623
You're gonna when your daughter
gets home!

872
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,210
Bring her on. I'm not gonna be told
how to act by some 9-year-old brat.

873
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,338
I agree with him there 100 percent.

874
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,673
And see? It's pathetic.

875
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,426
Watch it, Penelope. Watch it!

876
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:24,763
I've kept my shirt on till now,
but you are pushing me over the line.

877
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,515
- And Ethan?
- What about Ethan?

878
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,517
Well, is he sad too?

879
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,186
Ethan's got other things
on his plate if you ask me.

880
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,188
Ethan wasn't attached to Nibbles.

881
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,439
Nibbles!

882
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,983
What the hell kind of
pussy-ass name is that anyway?

883
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,862
So if you feel no remorse,
why should our son?

884
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,908
You know what? All this consultation
and consideration shit...

885
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,368
...I'm sick to death of it.

886
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,453
We were nice to you.
We bought tulips.

887
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,790
My wife dressed me up as a liberal,
but the fact of the matter is...

888
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,751
...I got no patience
for this touchy-feely bullshit.

889
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:58,338
I am a short-tempered
son of a bitch, okay?

890
00:45:58,506 --> 00:45:59,798
We all are.

891
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,758
No, I'm sorry. We are not.

892
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,052
We are not all
short-tempered sons of bitches.

893
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,430
- Not you, of course.
- No, not me. Thank God.

894
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,182
No, not you, Darjeeling. Not you.

895
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,560
You're so evolved.
You never go off half-cocked.

896
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,270
Why are you being so aggressive?

897
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,606
- I'm not, I'm being honest.
- No, you are. You're being aggressive.

898
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,110
Know what? You put this little bash
together, and I let you recruit me...

899
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,903
- You let me recruit you?
- Yes.

900
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,574
- That is so disgusting.
- No, it's not.

901
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,660
You're an advocate for civilized
behavior. That's fine with me.

902
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,246
I'm an advocate for civilized behavior,
you bet I am.

903
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,081
At least somebody around here is.

904
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,876
You think it's better to be
a tempered son of a bitch?

905
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,295
Nobody said that.
Nobody criticized you for that.

906
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,297
- You did.
- We did not.

907
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,883
What was I supposed to do?
Was I supposed to sue you?

908
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,843
Was I supposed to
never speak to you?

909
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,095
Tear you apart through
the insurance company?

910
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,513
- Stop it, Penny.
- Stop what?

911
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,515
You're blowing this out of proportion!

912
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:53,268
Well, I don't care.

913
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,812
You do everything you can
to escape the pettiness...

914
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,983
...and you just end up humiliated
and completely alone.

915
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,693
Yes. Walter.

916
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,154
It's out everywhere.

917
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,823
- Well, let them prove it.
- Yeah, right.

918
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,826
- Let them prove it.
- Without some kind of response....

919
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,453
No way.

920
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,247
From where I sit,
the best thing for us to do is nothing.

921
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,458
We're born alone and we die alone,
that's it.

922
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,793
Who wants a little Scotch?

923
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,714
Walter, I'm in a meeting right now.

924
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,799
- I'll call you when I get back.
- Damn it.

925
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,302
I'm living
with this totally negative person.

926
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,638
- Who's negative?
- Me.

927
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:33,558
This was the worst possible idea.
We should've never had this meeting.

928
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,144
- I told you so. Yeah.
- You told me so?

929
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,355
You told me we should've
never had this?

930
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,107
- I didn't think it was a good idea.
- It was a good idea.

931
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,360
Oh, come on. Who wants a little?

932
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,820
You told me you didn't think
this was a good idea?

933
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,739
- As I recall.
- As you recall.

934
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:51,117
- Maybe just a little sip.
- Don't you have to go?

935
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,204
At this point of the game,
I might as well have a little drink.

936
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:58,291
You look me in the eye and you tell me
that we didn't both agree on this.

937
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:01,253
Oh, God. Calm down, Penelope.
This is going nowhere.

938
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,172
And who said not to touch
the cobbler this morning?

939
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,092
Who said we should leave some
for the Cowans? Who said that?

940
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,718
That was very nice of you.

941
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,720
What does that
have to do with anything?

942
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,639
What do you mean?

943
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:16,476
- Guests are guests.
- You're lying. You're lying.

944
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:17,727
He's lying.

945
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,064
You know, my wife actually
had to drag me here today.

946
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:24,109
When you grow up with a certain
John Wayne idea of manhood...

947
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:28,029
...the impulse in this kind of situation
is not to talk it through.

948
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,574
I thought the role model
was Ivanhoe.

949
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,659
Same basic concept.

950
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,327
Another aspect.

951
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,288
Another aspect. Really?

952
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,790
How much are you gonna
humiliate yourself, Michael?

953
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,167
I can see I dragged him here
for nothing.

954
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,378
What did you expect, Doodle?

955
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,171
That is a ridiculous nickname.

956
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,841
Some revelation
about universal values?

957
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,718
This Scotch is unbelievable.

958
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:53,138
Right? You see that?
Eighteen years old, single malt...

959
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:55,974
...from a place in Scotland
still grows their own barley.

960
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,019
What about the tulips?
Who got them?

961
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,772
All I said was, "It's too bad we didn't
get any of those tulips this week."

962
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,275
I didn't say anything about going
to Henry Street.

963
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,820
Don't get all bent out of shape
over this. Penelope, it's not worth it.

964
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,240
He got the tulips. Him and only him.

965
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,452
What, we don't get a drink?

966
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:19,539
Penelope and I would like a drink too.

967
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,929
It's pretty funny
when you think about it.

968
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,557
A devotee of Ivanhoe
and John Wayne...

969
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,018
...but he's scared to pick up
an itty-bitty mouse.

970
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,936
Stop it with the hamster.

971
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,313
- Stop.
- She's right.

972
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,606
It's laughable.

973
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,692
- And hers?
- I don't think that'll be necessary.

974
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,653
- Pour me a drink, Michael.
- No.

975
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,945
- Michael.
- No.

976
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,614
What is wrong with you, Michael?

977
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,370
Fine. Fine.

978
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,331
Drink. Drink. What does it matter?

979
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,877
- ls drinking bad for you or something?
- No, it's great for me.

980
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,676
Now I don't know.

981
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,722
Mr. Cowan?

982
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,557
"Alan."

983
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:25,480
Alan. You see, you and I
didn't exactly hit it off...

984
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,150
...but I live with a man
who has decided, once and for all...

985
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:32,362
...that life is synonymous
with mediocrity.

986
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,781
You know, it's very hard
to live with a man...

987
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,075
...who's walled himself
inside that idea...

988
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:41,121
...who doesn't wanna change anything,
who doesn't get excited about anything.

989
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,582
What are you telling him this for?
He could care less.

990
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,584
We have to believe.

991
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,713
We have to believe
in some possible correction.

992
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,507
He's the last guy on earth
you should be telling this to.

993
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,260
I'll talk to anybody
I damn well please.

994
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,139
Who the fuck is that now?

995
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,856
- Hi, Ma.
- Mikey, it's me again.

996
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,441
I forgot to ask how Ethan is.

997
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,736
He's fine. He got his teeth
knocked out, but he's fine.

998
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,529
- ls he in pain?
- Yeah, he's in pain.

999
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,448
It hurts, but it'll pass.

1000
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,784
Ma, I told you we have company.
I gotta call you back, remember?

1001
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,579
- Okay, Mikey.
- Yeah. Bye.

1002
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,540
- He's still in pain?
- No.

1003
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,625
Then why do you worry
your mother?

1004
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,170
He has to worry her.
He can't help himself.

1005
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,548
All right, Penelope. That's enough.
What is this drama-queen bullshit?

1006
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:37,552
Penelope, nobody cares
about anything outside himself.

1007
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,805
Sure, we'd all like to believe
in some possible correction...

1008
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,016
...one we could author ourselves...

1009
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,352
...completely free
of selfish consideration.

1010
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,313
Like your writing this book
on Darfur.

1011
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,815
No. Which I think is great.

1012
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,276
You know.
I understand how you might say:

1013
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,987
"Okay, I'll pick a massacre.
History's full of them.

1014
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,405
I'm gonna write a book."

1015
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,616
Everybody has to save himself
somehow.

1016
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:02,118
I'm not writing this book
to save myself.

1017
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:05,163
You haven't read it.
You don't even know what's in it.

1018
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:07,248
Whatever.

1019
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:11,044
My God, that odor of Kronos
is killing me.

1020
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:14,005
- It fucking reeks.
- Well, you didn't exactly skimp.

1021
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,465
I am so sorry.

1022
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,259
No, it was my fault.
I sprayed like a madwoman.

1023
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,428
I don't know. Why...?

1024
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,765
Why can't things be easier,
you know?

1025
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:29,062
Why does everything
have to be so exhausting?

1026
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,730
You think too much.

1027
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,858
- Women think too much.
- There's an original response.

1028
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,194
I don't know what that means,
to think too much.

1029
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,863
You know, I don't know
how you can just go on living...

1030
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,991
...with absolutely no moral sense
of the world.

1031
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,536
- Look at me, I'm living.
- Oh, Michael, shut up.

1032
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,456
Your miserable complicity
just disgusts me.

1033
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,542
What happened
to your sense of humor?

1034
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,502
I don't have one
and I don't want one.

1035
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,003
If you ask me...

1036
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,090
...the couple is the worst ordeal
God has ever inflicted on us.

1037
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,385
- Marvelous.
- The couple and the family.

1038
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:03,388
No one's forcing you to air this out
in front of us, Michael.

1039
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:06,891
- And I might add, it's a little indecent.
- That doesn't bother him.

1040
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,394
You agree with me, don't you?

1041
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:12,730
This is all beside the point.

1042
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,400
Alan. Say something.

1043
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,443
He has a right to his ideas.

1044
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,320
Doesn't mean
he has to advertise them.

1045
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,197
Yeah, right. Maybe.

1046
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,199
We don't care about their marriage.

1047
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,202
We're here about the kids.
We don't care about their marriage.

1048
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,704
- Yeah, except...
- Except what?

1049
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,414
- It's related.
- It's related.

1050
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,332
Of course it's related.

1051
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,168
Ethan getting teeth busted out
is related to our marriage?

1052
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,546
- Of course it is.
- Sorry, I don't follow you.

1053
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:40,216
Look, take a step back
and look at the situation we're in.

1054
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,595
Children suck the life out of you
and leave you old and empty.

1055
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,638
That's the law of nature.

1056
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,641
You see these young couples
laughing all the way to the altar.

1057
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,020
You think, "They don't know.
Poor fuckers have no idea."

1058
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,481
They're happy. Nobody tells you
about this stuff in the beginning.

1059
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,816
I got this army buddy.

1060
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,277
He's gonna have a kid
with his new girlfriend.

1061
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:03,489
I said to him, "A kid? At our age?
What, are you stupid?"

1062
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,533
You got maybe
10, 15 good years left...

1063
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,702
...before you get cancer
or have a stroke...

1064
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,121
"...and you're gonna saddle yourself
with a kid?"

1065
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,624
- That's not really what you think.
- Yes, it is.

1066
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,918
- Of course it is. I think even worse.
- Yep.

1067
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,295
You're debasing yourself, Michael.

1068
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,297
Ls that right?

1069
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:23,843
Stop crying, Penelope.
It only makes it worse.

1070
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,345
Here.

1071
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,430
Of course, of course.

1072
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,266
- It's excellent, isn't it?
- It's excellent.

1073
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,185
Could I interest you in a cigar?

1074
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,812
- No cigars in the house.
- Too bad.

1075
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,148
Were you gonna smoke
a cigar now, Alan?

1076
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,735
I do what I want, Nancy. If I wanna
smoke a cigar, I smoke a cigar.

1077
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:43,613
I won't smoke it because
I don't wanna upset Penelope...

1078
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:47,241
...who's already on edge,
to put it mildly.

1079
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:51,245
Oh, quit sniffling like that.
She's right.

1080
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,958
You know, when women cry,
men are pushed to a breaking point.

1081
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,001
Although, unfortunately...

1082
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,880
...I must say, Michael's point of view
is completely justified.

1083
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,091
- Yeah.
- Yeah, can I read it to you?

1084
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,259
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

1085
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,097
Yeah, put "New York"
and a specific time of day.

1086
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,683
- It's unbearable.
- What time of day?

1087
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:15,728
The time you send it.
It has to be hot off the press.

1088
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,941
Not "questions." "Deplores."
"Questions" is wishy-washy.

1089
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,318
I live with this night and day.

1090
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,528
One second.

1091
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,655
Our lives are chopped up
by the cell phone.

1092
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,156
This is very important.

1093
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,826
- It's always more important.
- Go ahead.

1094
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,870
What's happening somewhere else
is always more important.

1095
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,082
No. No, not "strategy." "Scheme."

1096
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:40,586
"A scheme surfacing two weeks from
the company's posting," et cetera.

1097
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,005
Ln the street.

1098
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,049
The dinner table. Everywhere.

1099
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,636
And "study" in quotes.

1100
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,763
Put the word "study" in quotes.

1101
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,349
I don't even protest anymore.

1102
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,060
Unconditional surrender.

1103
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,563
I feel like I'm gonna vomit again.

1104
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,315
- Where's that bucket?
- How am I supposed to know?

1105
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:10,241
Well, then just quote me. You know:
"This is a barefaced attempt"....

1106
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,160
Can you stand
over the bucket, please?

1107
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,037
- Pen.
- What?

1108
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,081
I mean, we're already set up
to handle this now.

1109
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:20,626
"... according to TW Pharma
attorney Alan Cowan."

1110
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,379
Okay, I'll make these corrections
and put it out there.

1111
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,924
AP, Reuters, newspapers,
trade journals.

1112
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,801
You know, the whole shebang.

1113
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,806
- What's wrong?
- She's gonna throw up again.

1114
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,475
You're so caring. It's touching.

1115
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,727
- Well, I'm worried.
- I didn't get that.

1116
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,272
- My mistake.
- Oh, come on, Nancy, will you?

1117
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,483
You and I don't have to do this.

1118
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,778
Their marriage is going downhill.
We don't have to try to compete.

1119
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,864
What gives you the right to say
our marriage is going downhill?

1120
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,824
What gives you the right?

1121
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,870
- Yeah. Walter.
- Alan, is the press release ready?

1122
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:59,624
Yeah, I just had it read back to me.
They'll send it over to you.

1123
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,542
Did you say this is an attempt to...?

1124
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,836
Manipulation.
Manipulation of the stock price.

1125
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:07,131
Listen, Walter,
I'll call you back in a minute, yeah.

1126
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:10,009
- I didn't say it. Steven did.
- "Michael."

1127
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,388
- I will not let you judge our family.
- Michael. Sorry.

1128
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,182
Don't judge our son either.

1129
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,435
That's different.
Your son brutalized our son.

1130
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,479
They're young. They're kids.

1131
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,941
Kids roughhouse in the playground.
Always have, always will.

1132
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,984
- It's a rule of nature.
- No, it isn't.

1133
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,194
Sure it is.

1134
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,739
It takes a little education to substitute
the rule of law for violence.

1135
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:35,993
The origin of law,
as you of course know, is brute force.

1136
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,745
Maybe if you're a caveman...

1137
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,456
- ...but not in this world.
- Tell me about this world.

1138
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,376
You're boring.
This whole conversation is boring.

1139
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:47,296
Penelope, I believe in
the god of carnage...

1140
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,424
...the god whose rule's been
unchallenged since time immemorial.

1141
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,386
You're interested in Africa, right?

1142
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,305
- What's the matter?
- Don't worry about me.

1143
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,432
- Nancy.
- I'm just fine.

1144
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,184
All right.

1145
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,770
See, I just got back from the Congo.

1146
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,439
They got kids there
trained to kill at the age of 8.

1147
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,776
Ln the course of their childhood,
they might kill hundreds of people.

1148
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:13,573
They kill with a machete,
a shotgun, a Kalash, a thumper.

1149
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,076
So obviously, when my kid
busts some other kid's tooth...

1150
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,496
...even two teeth with a bamboo switch
by the sandbox...

1151
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,708
...I'm not quite as shocked
and indignant as you are.

1152
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:25,001
Well, you should be.

1153
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,794
Thumper.

1154
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:30,339
- What they call a grenade launcher.
- That's what I called it.

1155
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,467
- You all right?
- I'm just fine.

1156
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,554
What's wrong with her?
What's the matter?

1157
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,723
Bile. It's nothing.

1158
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,392
Don't you tell me about Africa.

1159
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,811
I know all about suffering in Africa.

1160
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,354
I don't doubt it.

1161
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,690
That's all I've been thinking about
for months.

1162
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,319
Don't get her started on this, please.

1163
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,906
You know,
I'm actually starting to like you.

1164
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,199
Shut up.

1165
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,701
Talk about commitment
to world peace and stability.

1166
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,953
Shut the fuck up, Michael.

1167
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,247
Are you sure about that?

1168
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,583
Very sure.
This will do me some good.

1169
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,460
We live in New York.

1170
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,795
We don't live in Kinshasa.

1171
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,464
We live in New York City...

1172
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,800
...and with the customs
of Western society.

1173
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,845
So, what happens
at the Brooklyn Bridge playground...

1174
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:20,181
...that has to do
with Western values...

1175
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:25,102
...to which, whether you like it or not,
I happen to subscribe to.

1176
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,772
Beating your husband must be
one of those customs then.

1177
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,315
I'm warning you, Michael.

1178
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:33,069
She was all over you
like a bad rash.

1179
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,363
If I were you, it would melt my heart.

1180
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,407
He's making fun of you.
Do you believe it?

1181
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,409
- I could care less.
- No, really.

1182
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,995
Morally, you're supposed
to overcome your impulses...

1183
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:46,040
...but there are times
you don't wanna overcome them.

1184
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,710
I mean, who wants to say a Hail Mary
when you're having sex?

1185
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,297
- Can you buy this Scotch around here?
- No, this one, not very likely. No.

1186
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,509
Thumper.

1187
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,761
Thumper. Really.

1188
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,305
- Yeah, Thumper.
- That's what it's called.

1189
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,559
Why don't you just say
"grenade launcher"?

1190
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,936
Because that's a term.

1191
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:10,982
It's just like they say "Kalash"
and not "Kalashnikov" or "AK-47."

1192
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,651
- Who is "they"?
- That's enough, Nancy. That's enough.

1193
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:17,613
Hotshot firebrands like my husband,
you gotta understand...

1194
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:21,158
...it's hard for them to get excited
about what happens down the block.

1195
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,537
- Exactly.
- I don't see why.

1196
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:27,957
I don't see why.
We're all citizens of the world.

1197
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:32,628
I don't see why we can't have
some sense of community.

1198
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:36,799
Penelope.
Enough with the highfalutin claptrap.

1199
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,385
I'm gonna kill him.

1200
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:43,014
- Yeah.
- There's a problem with "barefaced."

1201
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,558
- Well, take out "barefaced."
- She's right.

1202
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,311
It's unbearable after a while.

1203
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,813
- A brazen attempt to...
- Manipulate the stock price.

1204
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,440
There you go.

1205
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,776
- Did he sign off on the rest?
- Yeah.

1206
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:57,945
That's fine. Good.

1207
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:01,324
What were we talking about?
Thumpers?

1208
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,284
We were saying...

1209
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:06,203
...that, despite what
my husband thinks...

1210
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,332
...whether it happens here
or on the other side of the world...

1211
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:13,085
...we all have to be
collectively concerned.

1212
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:16,756
"Collectively concerned."

1213
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,925
Nancy, it's absurd to drink
in your condition.

1214
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,762
What condition? I'm perfect.

1215
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,599
Now, that's an interesting idea.

1216
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:28,351
Yeah.

1217
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:32,521
No. No interviews
before we get this release out.

1218
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,023
Mr. Cowan...

1219
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,360
...can you please put an end
to this nerve-racking conversation?

1220
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,739
Just remind him the stockholders
won't give a shit.

1221
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:45,826
The stockholders won't... Nancy.
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1222
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,412
- Hello! What's going on?
- There.

1223
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,123
Shit!

1224
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,918
- Oh, my God.
- Way to go!

1225
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,427
The blow-dryer. The blow-dryer.

1226
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,472
You should be put in a home, dear.

1227
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:11,227
I got everything in there.

1228
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:13,646
It was brand-new.
I spent hours setting this up.

1229
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:15,231
I can't believe you did that.

1230
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,483
That was a really
irresponsible thing to do.

1231
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,318
I got everything in there.

1232
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,404
My whole life was in there.

1233
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,991
- His whole life.
- Here.

1234
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:31,330
I wanna get the SIM card and
the battery out. How do you do that?

1235
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:36,085
- I just got it. I don't know.
- Let me see. Let me see.

1236
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,337
It's stuck.

1237
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,257
And they think it's funny.
They think it's funny!

1238
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,930
- Penelope.
- Penelope. This is not funny.

1239
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,976
My husband has spent
the entire afternoon drying things.

1240
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,770
No, no. This way.

1241
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,903
Forget it. It's over.

1242
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,905
- You gotta wait.
- Forget it. It's over.

1243
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,578
You wanna use the phone?

1244
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,500
I must say....

1245
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,547
What must you say, Michael?

1246
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:24,800
No. I don't even know what to say.

1247
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,304
I'd say it feels better like this.

1248
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:32,224
I'd say it feels better like this.
Wouldn't you?

1249
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,395
Men get so attached to their toys.

1250
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,481
It diminishes them.

1251
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,357
They lose their credibility.

1252
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,193
Oh, God.

1253
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,820
I dated this guy once...

1254
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,156
...and then I saw him
carrying this bag...

1255
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,783
...this rectangular bag
with a shoulder strap.

1256
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,828
It's a man's bag
with a shoulder strap.

1257
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,580
It was over.

1258
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,458
A bag with a shoulder strap,
that's the worst.

1259
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:00,336
But the cell phone
always at his fingertips...

1260
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,838
...that's the worst too.

1261
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,966
Men should have both hands free.

1262
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,594
They should have both hands free.

1263
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,805
I've got a John Wayne idea
of manhood too.

1264
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,807
What was it he had? A Colt .45.

1265
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,976
Something that empties a room.

1266
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,479
Any man that doesn't give off
those loner vibes...

1267
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:22,942
...just doesn't come off
as having any substance.

1268
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:27,696
So, Michael, Michael.
I guess you're happy now.

1269
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:31,367
Our little touchy-feely, whatever you
said, is coming apart at the seams.

1270
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,369
But, hey, you know what?

1271
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:37,831
This almost feels good,
in my opinion.

1272
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:42,294
Ln my opinion, some people can
handle their liquor better than others.

1273
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,922
- I'm as normal as can be.
- Yeah, right.

1274
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:49,510
Yeah. I'm beginning to see things
with a pleasant serenity.

1275
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:52,888
That's good. A pleasant serenity.

1276
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,225
I don't know why you're wasting
yourself out in the open, Darjeeling.

1277
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,601
Shut the hell up.

1278
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,478
Here. Alan.

1279
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,314
- Relax.
- No cigars in the house.

1280
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,066
You got your Hoyo de Monterro.

1281
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,402
You got your Partagas D,
number 4.

1282
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,445
You got your Hoyo Coronacion.

1283
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,905
Where did you get these?

1284
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:12,324
- You don't wanna know.
- Seriously.

1285
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,451
The Spanish connection.

1286
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,037
My cookware guy is going out
with a flight attendant.

1287
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,915
She brings home, like,
two boxes a week.

1288
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,168
You can't smoke in a house
with an asthmatic child.

1289
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,713
And why are you telling him
your whole life story?

1290
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,464
- Who has asthma?
- Our son.

1291
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,466
We had a goddamn hamster,
didn't we?

1292
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,261
That's true. Pets aren't good
when you're asthmatic.

1293
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,638
No. Not good at all.

1294
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,558
Even goldfish aren't
necessarily recommended.

1295
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:40,269
Do I have to listen to this crap?

1296
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:45,441
I guess I'm the only one that doesn't
see things with a pleasant serenity.

1297
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,526
The truth is...

1298
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,278
...I've never been so unhappy.

1299
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,280
This is the unhappiest day
of my life.

1300
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,407
You're an unhappy drunk.

1301
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,534
Michael...

1302
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,705
...every word out of your mouth
just slays me.

1303
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,457
I don't get drunk.

1304
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:05,628
I had a couple of sips
of your shitty 18-year-old single malt...

1305
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:09,673
...that you trot out like it's
the 18th Wonder of the World.

1306
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,508
I don't get drunk.

1307
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,636
I wish I could.
Believe me, I wish I could.

1308
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:19,224
I wish I could just drown
every last sorrow in a good, stiff drink.

1309
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:24,021
My husband is unhappy too.

1310
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:28,108
Look at him all hunched over
like he was left on the side of the road.

1311
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:32,446
I think this is the unhappiest day
of his life too.

1312
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:35,908
- It is.
- I'm sorry, Doodle.

1313
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,253
Hello.

1314
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,507
- Hello.
- Mikey.

1315
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:55,260
Mom. I told you we have company.
You remember?

1316
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:58,597
Why do you want me
to stop taking my Antril?

1317
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,100
Because it's medication
that can kill you.

1318
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,726
- It's poison.
- It is not.

1319
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:04,561
Now, Mom, Mom.

1320
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,356
There's someone here
who can explain.

1321
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:10,275
- Here. Tell her.
- Tell her what?

1322
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,779
Tell her what you know
about that poisonous shit of yours.

1323
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:18,117
What can he tell her?
He doesn't know anything.

1324
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:20,911
Hello, ma'am.

1325
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,539
- How are you?
- I'm all right for now.

1326
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:26,583
They want to take me off my Antril.

1327
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,377
My operation is a week away.

1328
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,212
Yeah. Are you in pain?

1329
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,964
I can't be on my feet, doctor.

1330
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:35,467
Yeah. Well, the operation
will fix that.

1331
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,849
- The other leg too?
- Are you an orthopedist?

1332
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,268
No, I'm not an orthopedist.

1333
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,770
She keeps calling me "doctor."

1334
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:49,064
Doctor. What a laugh.

1335
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,066
- Hang up.
- Hello.

1336
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,152
- Yeah.
- What about my Antril?

1337
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:57,114
Well, do you have
any balance issues?

1338
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,407
No....

1339
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,617
- Yeah.
- Will it kill me?

1340
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:05,372
No, of course not. Not at all.
It can't kill you.

1341
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,207
Don't listen to what people say.

1342
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,878
Still, yeah, it might be a good idea
not to take it for a while.

1343
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,171
For how long?

1344
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,631
Just until this operation
is behind you.

1345
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,467
They're gonna ruin me.

1346
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:19,595
If you could see me, you'd be
surprised how well-preserved I am.

1347
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:23,223
Yeah, sounds like
you're in excellent shape.

1348
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:25,100
All right. You got that, Ma?

1349
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,478
You stop taking that medication.

1350
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,396
- Just do as you're told!
- Okay, okay.

1351
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:32,649
- All right? I love you.
- Love you too.

1352
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,278
I can't take her anymore.

1353
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:37,821
The shit I put up with.

1354
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,074
All right. Should we wrap this up?

1355
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,119
Should I come back here tonight
with Zachary? Let's decide.

1356
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,705
This is getting to be, like,
who cares?

1357
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:49,082
That is what we're here for after all.

1358
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,836
Now I'm gonna be sick.
Where's that bucket?

1359
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,465
That's enough. That's enough.

1360
01:08:56,633 --> 01:09:01,470
- That's enough.
- I’d say both sides share the blame.

1361
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:02,888
So....

1362
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:06,475
There you are.
Both sides share the blame.

1363
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:10,062
- Are you serious?
- Excuse me?

1364
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,772
That's what you really think?

1365
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,399
It's what I think, yes.

1366
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,945
My son, Ethan, who had to take
two codeine at 3 in the morning...

1367
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:21,990
- ...he shares the blame?
- He's not necessarily innocent.

1368
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,493
Get out of my house.
You get the fuck out.

1369
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,745
Get the fuck out of my house!

1370
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:30,249
My bag! My bag! My...

1371
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,000
- Alan.
- What is going on here?

1372
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,585
They've totally lost it.

1373
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,296
Alan! Do something.

1374
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,258
- "Alan, do something."
- Shut your mouth.

1375
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:43,804
She broke my makeup mirror
and my perfume.

1376
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,514
Stand up for me.

1377
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,851
Why don't you stand up for me?

1378
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,436
Let's go, Nancy.

1379
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,773
- It's not like I'm strangling her.
- What did I do to you?

1380
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,942
The blame is not shared.

1381
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:00,654
The victim and the criminal
are not the same.

1382
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:04,032
- The criminal?
- Give it a fucking rest, Penelope.

1383
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,702
Enough with
this politically correct bullshit!

1384
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,997
- Which I believe in.
- That you believe. You believe.

1385
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,083
This crush you got
on these Sudan sambos...

1386
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,085
...is spilling over
into everything now!

1387
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:16,461
I'm horrified.

1388
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,548
How could you be
so openly despicable?

1389
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:24,136
Because I feel like it.
I feel like being openly despicable.

1390
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,638
One day you will understand
the sheer horror...

1391
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:29,141
...of what's happening
in that part of the world...

1392
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:33,437
...and you will be ashamed
of your contemptibly nihilistic attitude.

1393
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:37,816
Yes, Darjeeling,
you're so wonderful.

1394
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,943
You're the best and the brightest.

1395
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:43,071
Yes, I am! Yes, I am!

1396
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,907
Let's get out of here, Alan.

1397
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,868
These people are monsters.

1398
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:50,579
- Stop it, Nancy.
- No, no. No.

1399
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:55,334
I wanna drink some more.
I wanna get drunk off my ass.

1400
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,421
This bitch throws my bag against
the ceiling, nobody lifts a finger.

1401
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:02,507
- I wanna be blind drunk.
- You're drunk enough.

1402
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,844
How can you let her
call our son a criminal?

1403
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:10,849
We come over here to work things out
with them, and they insult us...

1404
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,142
...they browbeat us...

1405
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:15,270
...they lecture us about being
good citizens of the planet.

1406
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:19,650
I am glad our son
kicked the shit out of your son...

1407
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:23,236
...and I wipe my ass
with your human rights.

1408
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,451
Get a couple of drinks in her and,
bam, her true self comes out.

1409
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:33,288
What happened to that gracious,
demure woman with the soft eyes?

1410
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,874
I told you. I told you!

1411
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:38,126
- What did you tell him?
- That she's a fake.

1412
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,587
That woman is totally fake.
I'm sorry.

1413
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,632
- When did you say that?
- When you were drying your pants.

1414
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,802
You'd known her 15 minutes,
and you already knew she was fake?

1415
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,721
Yeah. Well, I pick up on these things
pretty quickly.

1416
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,556
- She does.
- I got a nose for them.

1417
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,850
Fake. What does that mean?

1418
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,602
I don't wanna listen to this.

1419
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,980
Why do you put me through this,
Alan?

1420
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,815
Relax, Nancy.

1421
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,818
She's a phony. She doesn't care
any more than you do.

1422
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:06,196
- It's true. That's true.
- It's true. He said it's true.

1423
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,365
They don't give a shit.

1424
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:12,119
It's so obvious right from
the beginning. They don't give a shit.

1425
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,413
She doesn't give a shit either.
It's true.

1426
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,164
- Like you do?
- Well...

1427
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,958
No, let him talk, honey.

1428
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,919
Explain to me, Michael,
exactly how you care.

1429
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,671
What does that mean anyway?

1430
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:25,632
You're more credible
when you're being openly despicable.

1431
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,011
Truth is, nobody here cares
except maybe Penelope.

1432
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,804
One must acknowledge
her integrity.

1433
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:33,223
I don't need your acknowledgment.

1434
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:35,392
I don't need your acknowledgment!

1435
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,728
But I do care. I really do care.

1436
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:41,523
Yes, Doodle,
we care in a hysterical way.

1437
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,860
Not like heroic figures
of a social movement.

1438
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:49,156
I saw your friend Jane Fonda
on TV the other day.

1439
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:52,659
Made me wanna run out
and buy a Ku Klux Klan poster.

1440
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,412
My friend Jane Fonda?

1441
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,206
What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1442
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:03,503
You're the same breed, the same kind
of involved, problem-solver woman.

1443
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,255
Those are not the women we like.

1444
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:09,342
The women we like are sensual,
crazy, shot full of hormones.

1445
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,386
The gatekeepers of the world...

1446
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,723
...the ones who wanna show off
how perceptive they are?

1447
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,683
Huge turnoff.

1448
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:20,729
Even poor Michael,
your own husband, is turned off.

1449
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,189
Don't you speak for me.

1450
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:25,817
We don't give a shit
what women you like.

1451
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,278
Where do you get off
just spouting these opinions?

1452
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:31,698
You are the one man whose opinion
we don't give a shit about!

1453
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:34,409
She's screaming.

1454
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,370
Quartermaster on a slave ship.

1455
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,331
She doesn't scream?

1456
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:42,125
She didn't just scream
that your little asshole...

1457
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,294
...was right to beat up ours?

1458
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,545
He was right.

1459
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:49,424
At least our kid
isn't a little wimpy-ass faggot.

1460
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:53,345
Yours is a fucking snitch!

1461
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:55,639
Let's go, Alan.

1462
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:58,225
Why are we still in this house?

1463
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,435
Exactly.

1464
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:02,896
Here.

1465
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:06,817
This is what I think
of your stupid tulips.

1466
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,778
Your hideous flowers.

1467
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:15,450
This is the worst day of my life too.
