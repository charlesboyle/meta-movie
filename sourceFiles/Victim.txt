A letter from
the Lord Chancellor's office.

329
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:58,280
don't tell me
we've been turned down.

330
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:01,837
0 Chuckles l Hardly, sir. our friends think
you should have taken silk some time ago.

331
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:04,437
being a Q C. can be
a risky business, william.

332
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:07,446
Many a good junior practice
has failed in the front row.

333
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,446
I'm not worried about that, sir.

334
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:12,139
I'm sure we shall be quite at home there.

335
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:14,714
well, I'm glad you think so.

336
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:23,739
- these have been in water.
- Yes.

337
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:27,941
the boy tried desperately to get rid of them.
we had to have the drain up.

338
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:32,310
Newspaper cuttings,
pictures carefully preserved in a scrapbook...

339
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:35,313
and all pertaining
to you and your career, sir.

340
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:37,904
do you know barrett?

341
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:40,311
Yes, I met him some time ago.

342
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:43,006
He, uh - He thumbed a lift one night.

343
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:48,275
Said he'd missed the last bus to Fulham.
It was on my way home, so I dropped him off.

344
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,940
- did you see him again?
- Yes.

345
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,776
He was working on a building site
quite near my chambers.

346
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:56,780
I often used to see him standing
down there at the traffic lights -

347
00:25:56,882 --> 00:25:58,848
the Strand-waterloo intersection.

348
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:02,972
It seemed churlish not to give him
a lift now and again, so...

349
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,547
I did.

350
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:08,006
- then I stopped.
- oh?

351
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:11,411
why did you do that, sir?

352
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:13,913
I came to the conclusion
that he was waiting for me.

353
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:16,311
wet or fine, he was always there.

354
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:18,574
I see.

355
00:26:18,682 --> 00:26:20,648
So that was the end of it?

356
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:24,004
No. He, uh, started writing.

357
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,104
telephoning.

358
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,374
I destroyed his letters...

359
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:30,004
warned him not to call.

360
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:33,081
we believe that barrett
was being blackmailed, sir.

361
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:39,069
He's been stealing from his firm
for months - over €2,000 -

362
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,841
with nothing to show for it.

363
00:26:40,948 --> 00:26:44,937
Had less than half a dollar in his pocket
when we picked him up.

364
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:49,140
did he give you any hint, any impression
that he was being blackmailed?

365
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,314
No.

366
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:55,040
then it started
after you finished seeing him?

367
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,808
It would seem that way.

368
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:59,813
Have you any idea what barrett
might have been paying to keep quiet?

369
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:01,710
No idea at all.

370
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:03,838
You knew, of course,
he was a homosexual.

371
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:07,307
I had formed that impression.

372
00:27:07,415 --> 00:27:11,677
You know also, sir, that as many as 90%%
of all blackmail cases have a homosexual origin.

373
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,113
I follow your train of thought, Inspector...

374
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:17,807
but I wouldn't know if it applied
in this particular instance.

375
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:21,369
- You can't hazard a guess, sir?
- No.

376
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:24,879
well, there's no doubt that a law
which sends homosexuals to prison...

377
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:28,311
offers unlimited opportunities
for blackmail.

378
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,438
well, thank you, sir.
You've been extremely helpful.

379
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,173
thank you.

380
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:37,181
do you, um - do you have any line
on the blackmailer?

381
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,974
No, sir. we couldn't get a word
out of barrett, which is a pity.

382
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:44,047
blackmail is the simplest of crimes
when we have the cooperation of the victim.

383
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:45,943
Almost impossible when we haven't.

384
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:51,206
Can I, uh - Can I see barrett?

385
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:54,509
- I'd like to talk to him.
- that's not possible, sir.

386
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:57,274
barrett hanged himself
in his cell this afternoon.

387
00:27:58,382 --> 00:27:59,904
He's dead.

388
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:13,937
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting,
Mr. Stone.

389
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:16,776
the inspector's free now.
I'll take you up in a moment.

390
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,279
thanks.

391
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:20,007
this way, Mr. Farr.

392
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,278
that was Eddy Stone, sir.

393
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:32,904
we fetched him to identify the body.

394
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,504
Stone?

395
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:37,740
He works as a ticket clerk
at twofosters tube station.

396
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:39,905
- Friend of barrett's.
- oh.

397
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:43,247
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

398
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:22,977
did you know your friend
was being blackmailed?

399
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:25,639
No. I just thought
he was brassed off.

400
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:29,408
How well did barrett know
Mr. Melville Farr?

401
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:30,741
who?

402
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:33,280
the gentleman I was with
when I saw you in the hall.

403
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:36,542
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

404
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:39,738
boy didn't mention
anyone called Farr to me.

405
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:42,110
I see.

406
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:45,147
Your friend was very secretive.

407
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:47,578
didn't he confide in you?

408
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:50,170
No. why should he?

409
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:55,503
- Uh, look, can I go now?
- I don't see why not.

410
00:29:57,848 --> 00:30:01,645
If you do decide to remember
anything Barrett said, let us know.

411
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,774
blackmail's a serious business.

412
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,041
So's murder.

413
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:13,274
He's right. this blackmailer
as good as murdered barrett.

414
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:16,143
I want him before he does
any more damage.

415
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:19,408
- did Farr recognize him downstairs?
- No, sir.

416
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:23,447
Nevertheless, whatever the blackmailer had
on barrett concerned Farr. of that I'm certain.

417
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:25,945
but Mr. Farr's married, sir.

418
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,014
those are famous last words, bridie.

419
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:32,674
He took barrett into his car.

420
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:35,941
- No harm in giving the boy a lift.
- Maybe not.

421
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:38,912
It's the subsequent lifts
that worry me.

422
00:30:39,015 --> 00:30:42,004
Check on barrett's background,
find out if there are any relations.

423
00:30:42,115 --> 00:30:45,047
- And tell Sgt. Hoey to get out his Sunday suit.
- Very good, sir.

424
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:48,046
If only these unfortunate devils
had come to us in the first place.

425
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:51,171
If only they led normal lives
they wouldn't need to come at all.

426
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:55,611
If the law punished every abnormality,
we'd be kept pretty busy, Sergeant.

427
00:30:55,714 --> 00:30:58,771
Even so, sir, this law was made
for a very good reason.

428
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:01,847
If it were changed,
other ''weaknesses'' would follow.

429
00:31:01,948 --> 00:31:04,812
I can see you're a true puritan,
bridie, huh?

430
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:07,142
well, there's nothing wrong with that, sir.

431
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:11,146
of course not. but there was a time
when that was against the law, you know.

432
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:13,713
Uh, very good, sir.

433
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:18,314
- oh, hello, darling.
- Hello, darling.

434
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:22,480
Sorry I'm late. did, uh - 0 Clears throat l
did william telephone you?

435
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:24,979
Yes. He said you had
some marvelous news.

436
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,979
He could hardly contain himself.

437
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:28,808
0 Mel l
Marvelous news?

438
00:31:28,914 --> 00:31:32,676
oh, yes. the Lord Chancellor
accepted my application.

439
00:31:32,781 --> 00:31:34,906
that's wonderful!

440
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:37,038
we must celebrate.

441
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:40,046
I-I don't feel very much like
celebrating tonight, if you don't mind.

442
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,546
Mel, are you all right.
Is something wrong?

443
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:45,943
william said you were so pleased.
what happened on the way home?

444
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,774
He said you had to go
to Fulham Police Station.

445
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:53,847
- were you in an accident or something?
- No, no.

446
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:56,346
I'm all right.

447
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,471
I'm sorry.

448
00:32:00,115 --> 00:32:02,240
I'll go and run your bath.

449
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:20,179
[ Woman ]
Is that you, Eddy?

450
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:22,247
who else?

451
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:26,071
- Here's your milk.
- Thanks.

452
00:32:26,181 --> 00:32:28,374
oh, there's some letters
by the phone for you.

453
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:30,572
- when did they come?
- Monday or Tuesday.

454
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:33,011
Took 'em in with mine.
I forgot.

455
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:17,547
0 Chattering, Indistinct l

456
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:20,938
Good-bye.

457
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:24,277
- I hear Farr's taking silk.
- that's right.

458
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:27,280
Q C. at 40.
there's no stopping the blighter.

459
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,280
we'll see him on the bench yet.

460
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,973
well, he's got a big enough practice.
He'll be able to afford it.

461
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:41,007
Mr. Farr.

462
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,504
- what do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

463
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:48,274
- I only see people by appointment.
- I think you ought to see this photograph.

464
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:58,272
That's what Boy was paying to keep quiet-
you and him.

465
00:33:58,382 --> 00:34:00,439
I just found it.

466
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:07,738
You'd better come upstairs.

467
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:13,679
- Morning, Mr. Farr.
- Morning, william.

468
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:16,441
If there are any calls, you take them.
I don't want to be disturbed.

469
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:19,513
- Yes, sir. we're in court this morning, sir.
- Yes, I know we are.

470
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:25,679
It's clear enough now. boy stole
all that money to pay for the negative.

471
00:34:25,781 --> 00:34:29,179
but the bastards never sent it.
Just another print as a reminder.

472
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:32,470
How, uh -

473
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:35,674
How could they have taken this?

474
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:38,941
they were obviously trailing boy.

475
00:34:39,048 --> 00:34:41,445
telephoto lens.
It's an old dodge.

476
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,843
You were in the car.
You would never see them.

477
00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:48,812
Have you shown this to the police?

478
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,880
well, of course I haven't.

479
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:55,777
that's what he was trying to prevent.
don't you see?

480
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:57,279
Yes, I see.

481
00:34:58,614 --> 00:35:00,137
I see.

482
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:04,542
why did he have to go and -

483
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:06,476
Hang himself?

484
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:09,479
He knew the priest
would get it out of him in the end.

485
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:11,740
He didn't want to involve you.

486
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:13,746
You'll be all right?

487
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:15,814
- Yes.
- He should have come to you.

488
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,669
wasn't big enough to be on his own like that.
He should have come to you.

489
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:27,013
He did.

490
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:32,376
I thought he was trying
to blackmail me.

491
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,470
I wouldn't even talk to him.

492
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:37,806
Jesus.

493
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:41,037
Poor old boy.

494
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:46,613
He didn't stand much of a chance
between you and the blacky, did he?

495
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,373
No.

496
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:57,209
well, I'd better go.
I just thought you'd want to know.

497
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:59,281
No, Stone, wait a minute.

498
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:03,613
do you know
who was blackmailing him?

499
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:05,271
No.

500
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:08,836
well, I'm going to find out,
and you're going to help me.

501
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:11,778
What for?
They'll pack it in now.

502
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:14,779
Now that he's dead.
I mean, they're scared of tackling you.

503
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,779
otherwise they would have
done it in the first place.

504
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:19,779
why go looking for trouble?

505
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:24,779
If I hadn't been trying so bloody hard to
avoid trouble, this might never have happened.

506
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,813
but it has, and they're not
going to get away with it.

507
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:31,402
well, if you dig this over
it could end in one hell of a scandal.

508
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:33,912
And it wouldn't only be you
who came down.

509
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:36,038
I know that.

510
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:39,046
I-I can't help you.
I don't know anything.

511
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:41,137
You don't have to know anything.

512
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:44,873
All you have to do is to watch -
watch for fear.

513
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:47,776
Fear is the oxygen of blackmail.

514
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,847
If barrett was paying, others are.
Find me one.

515
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:53,244
You're crazy, Mr. Farr.

516
00:36:53,347 --> 00:36:56,313
- You're not thinking properly.
- Stone, are you going to help me or not?

517
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,607
okay, I'll listen around.

518
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:01,875
I'd like to get 'em too.

519
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:04,640
Just remember,
if you do run 'em down...

520
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:07,180
you'll bring yourself down as well.

521
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,837
Call me here.

522
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:11,676
I'll call ya.

523

first thing in the morning, P.H.

525
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,442
Good.

Homing pigeons.

527
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:39,638
Hope they come back
with their little beaks bulging.

528
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:42,509
Let's have a sherry at the Chequers.
I'd love to hear the chat.

529
00:37:42,614 --> 00:37:44,512
they'll all be talking
about boy barrett.

530
00:37:44,614 --> 00:37:47,239
- who'd have thought he'd do a thing like that?
- who would?

531
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:50,245
It's shaken me, P.H.
I wish we could go back to Cheltenham.

532
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:52,870
Just a while longer, Mickey.
we'll wind it up soon.

boy is dead.

539
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:23,842
He hanged himself.

540
00:38:25,148 --> 00:38:26,773
It's in the paper.

541
00:38:30,414 --> 00:38:33,040

00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,412
No.

544
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:39,707
Close the shop.

00:38:39,814 --> 00:38:41,439
Pull down the blinds.

546
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:49,037
Miss benham, if anyone comes
asking questions about boy-

547
00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:54,103
I'm not interested in your affairs, Mr. doe.
I'm just here for the salary on Friday.

548
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:58,007
I only meant to teach him a lesson.

549
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,680
I thought he'd come back.

550
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:05,342

the troll's speaking.

557
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:24,544
She said, ''barrett never had a penny to bless
himself with. what happened to the money?''

558
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:27,079
I could answer that in one.

- bye, Henry.

574

For a man sitting on a gold mine,
Henry looks pretty miserable.

575
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,445
Henry sold his gold mine.

576
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:19,172

He's the estate agent who did the sale.

I don't know.

00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:53,773
Used to come in the wheatsheaf

- Yeah. Cheers.

- who?

588
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:07,009
Eddy and Phip and the rest of them.
All the same, the whole blooming lot.

oh, they're good for a laugh, all right.
Very witty at times.

591
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:15,273
Generous too.
And I hate their bloody guts.

592
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:17,870

- well, don't look at me like that.

what's it matter to you?

594
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:25,480
If they had gamy legs or something,
you'd be sorry for them.

595
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:28,069
Sorry for 'em? Not me.

596
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,374

too little love as kids.

598
00:41:35,814 --> 00:41:38,279
they can't help it. Part of nature.

599
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:41,541
well, to my mind
it's the weak, rotten part of nature...

600
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:45,044
and if they ever make it legal
they may as well license every other perversion.

00:41:51,614 --> 00:41:55,944

608
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:17,172
- Sold your shop?
- who told you that?

609
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,371
Fred at the Chequers.
He heard from the estate agent.

610
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:23,003
- why? Is it a secret?
- No, of course not.

611
00:42:23,114 --> 00:42:25,842
but I wish people would mind
their own business, that's all.

612

A chap I know, he's got
a good hairdressing business...

624
00:43:57,347 --> 00:43:59,438
and he's been acting jumpy lately.

625
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:02,570
well, now he's suddenly
decided to sell out.

626
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,647
Yeah, but it could be
he's being squeezed as well.

what's his address?

628
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:13,509

- this won't take very long.

00:44:51,947 --> 00:44:53,379
It's a private matter.

637

- I'll be off then, Mr. Henry.
- that's all right, George. I'll close up.

- who told you that?

- You're being blackmailed, aren't you?
- what are you talking about?

- I don't know what you're talking about.
- but you are selling this place, aren't you?

I haven't told anyone where I'm going.
who are you?

I don't know!

645

- You're from the police?
- No.

647
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:29,143
I'm a friend of someone
you used to know - boy barrett.

648

I want to know who killed him.

649

You can help me.

650
00:45:36,714 --> 00:45:40,669
- How do you pay the money?
- I don't remember. I'm not saying anything.

651
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:45,972
I can't help the way I am,
but the law says I'm a criminal.

652
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,205
I've been to prison four times.

653
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:53,113
I couldn't go through that again,
not at my age.

654
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,009
I'm going to Canada.

655
00:45:57,114 --> 00:46:01,069
I've made up my mind to be sensible,
as the prison doctor used to say.

656
00:46:02,147 --> 00:46:05,113
I don't care how lonely, but sensible.

657
00:46:06,614 --> 00:46:09,011
I can't stand any more trouble.

658
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,937

00:56:54,047 --> 00:56:56,342
Answer me.

828
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,207
I want to know the truth.

829
00:56:59,313 --> 00:57:01,939
I want to know why he hanged himself.

830
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:03,512
He was being blackmailed.

831
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:06,602
- that's why he stole?
- Yes.

832
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:09,873
Someone found out he was
a homosexual and blackmailed him?

833
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,445
that's it.

834
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,377
takes two to make
a reason for blackmail.

835
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,708
were you the other man?

836
00:57:23,813 --> 00:57:25,676
were you?

837
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,268
tell me everything.
I want to know.

838
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,779
I don't want you to.

839
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,107
I'd rather know than guess.

840
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,107
He'd been paying for months...

841
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:47,736
to stop copies of this...

842
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,472
going round the temple.

843
00:57:50,513 --> 00:57:52,002
why is he crying?

844
00:57:52,113 --> 00:57:54,102
I'd just told him I couldn't see him anymore.

845
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:56,406
So he knew it was the end?

846
00:57:57,713 --> 00:57:59,406
So did you.

847
00:58:01,847 --> 00:58:04,108
Look at the picture.

848
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:07,509
there's as much pain
in your face as there is in his.

849
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:09,078
You haven't changed.

850
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:13,043
In spite of our marriage,
in your inmost feelings you're still the same.

851
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:15,078
that's why you stopped seeing him.

852
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:18,043
- You felt for him what you felt for Stainer.
- that's not true!

853
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:21,340
You were attracted to that boy
as a man would be to a girl.

854
00:58:21,446 --> 00:58:25,344
0 Exhales l Laura, Laura. don't go on.
For God's sake, stop! Stop now!

855
00:58:25,446 --> 00:58:28,935
I can't stop.
I love you too much to stop.

856
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:31,012
I thought you loved me.

857
00:58:31,113 --> 00:58:34,602
If you do, what did you feel for him?
I have a right to know.

858
00:58:34,713 --> 00:58:37,702
All right. You want to know.
I shall tell you.

859
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:39,574
You won't be content
until you know, will you?

860
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,111
till you've ripped it out of me!

861
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:45,611
I stopped seeing him
because I wanted him.

862
00:58:45,713 --> 00:58:48,338
do you understand?
because I wanted him!

863
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:54,605
Now what good has that done you?

864
00:59:08,446 --> 00:59:10,412
when did it begin?

865
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:12,411
From the moment I saw him.

866
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,903
You don't call that love?

867
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,104
No.

868
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,505
If it was love,
why should I want to stamp it out?

869
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:27,568
why would I do that if it was love?

870
00:59:28,747 --> 00:59:31,212
His feeling for you?
what was that?

871
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,345
I don't know.

872
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,011
Yes, I - I think perhaps for him -

873
00:59:40,913 --> 00:59:42,811
perhaps for him it was love.

874
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,703
the only kind of love he could feel.

875
00:59:48,813 --> 00:59:51,074
He died for it to protect me.

876
00:59:58,013 --> 01:00:01,070
that thought will remain with you
for the rest of your life.

877
01:00:02,513 --> 01:00:05,445
I don't think there's
going to be room for me as well.

878
01:00:21,213 --> 01:00:23,736
[ Bells ealing ]

879
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:54,008
oh, yes, milord.
oh!Just one moment, please.

880
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:55,874
Lord Fullbrook, sir.

881
01:00:58,313 --> 01:00:59,779
thank you, Mrs. brooks.

882
01:01:00,813 --> 01:01:02,574
Yes, Charles.

883
01:01:04,813 --> 01:01:06,403
well, can't it wait till Monday?

884
01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:11,676
I must say you make it sound very dramatic.

885
01:01:13,846 --> 01:01:15,642
Very well...

886
01:01:15,747 --> 01:01:17,905
if you put it on a personal basis.

887
01:01:18,013 --> 01:01:19,479
what address?

888
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:23,442
1 8 Nightingale Mews.

889
01:01:48,013 --> 01:01:50,206
Come in.
Fullbrook's waiting inside.

890
01:01:53,546 --> 01:01:55,807
oh, hello, Farr.
Good of you to come.

891
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:59,140
- You said it was a matter of life and death.
- It is to me.

892
01:01:59,246 --> 01:02:02,076
- You two know each other.
- Come to cases, teddy. Come to cases.

893
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:05,703
I'm afraid you upset tiny
at the theater last night.

894
01:02:05,812 --> 01:02:07,642
Ask him who he's working for, Teddy.

895
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:12,645
You seem set on stirring up a lot of trouble.
I want you to stop.

896
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:19,135
- what exactly has it to do with you, Charles?
- well, the demands addressed to Calloway...

897
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:21,235
cover the three of us.

898
01:02:36,213 --> 01:02:37,679
I see.

899
01:02:39,413 --> 01:02:40,878
- Frankly, I'm surprised.
- Why?

900
01:02:40,979 --> 01:02:44,412
You're a sophisticated man.
You know the invert is part of nature.

901
01:02:44,513 --> 01:02:47,740
- Sherry?
- but I've known you for years, Charles.

902
01:02:47,846 --> 01:02:50,574
one is discreet about these things.

903
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,839
- what do you want?
- I want you to persuade your client to join us.

904
01:02:53,946 --> 01:02:58,276
we'll pay the blackmailer off
in one nice big sum. Hmm?

905
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,471
- Any idea who it is?
- No.

906
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,278
It's a filthy thing, extortion.

907
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:08,039
- where'd you leave the money?
- At the -

908
01:03:08,146 --> 01:03:09,873
0 Exhales l
there you are, teddy.

909
01:03:09,979 --> 01:03:12,309
- You haven't done a damn bit of good.
- Steady, tiny.

910
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:17,209
Listen. our apparently calm acceptance of this
blackmail must seem very extraordinary to you.

911
01:03:17,313 --> 01:03:21,075
but do you ever wonder about the law
that makes us all victims of any cheap thug...

912
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:23,270
who finds out about our natural instincts?

913
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,210
Paying blackmail won't alter the law.
It'll only encourage the blackmailer.

914
01:03:26,313 --> 01:03:28,074
we've got to pay.

915
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,168
tell him, teddy. Explain.

916
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:33,643
If we don't pay, 1 0-to-1 we land in jail.

917
01:03:33,746 --> 01:03:37,803
with our crime - so-called -
damn nearly parallel with robbery with violence.

918
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,738
Man-made laws are never perfect.

919
01:03:40,846 --> 01:03:44,938
I'm a born odd-man-out, Farr,
but I've never corrupted the normal.

920
01:03:45,046 --> 01:03:47,638
why should I be forced
to live outside the law...

921
01:03:47,746 --> 01:03:51,372
because I find love in the only way I can?

922
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,945
You're a star, Calloway.
People like you set a fashion.

923
01:03:54,046 --> 01:03:57,501
If the young people knew how you lived,
mightn't they think that an example to follow?

924
01:03:57,613 --> 01:04:00,908
of course youth must be protected.
we all agree about that.

925
01:04:01,013 --> 01:04:05,877
but that doesn't mean that consenting males in
private should be pilloried by an antiquated law.

926
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:07,468
And made meat for blackmail.

927
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:11,103
If you're old enough to vote,
you're old enough to choose your own way of life.

928
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:15,804
Many of us reach the grave
without arriving at that stage of responsibility.

929
01:04:15,912 --> 01:04:18,071
do you support the law?

930
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:19,644
I am a lawyer.

931
01:04:20,946 --> 01:04:23,003
do you ever hear from the Stainers, Farr?

932
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:28,878
I was the old man's secretary.
That's how I knew young Stainer killed himself.

933
01:04:28,979 --> 01:04:32,241
while you stayed alive.
Shrouded yourself in virtue...

934
01:04:32,346 --> 01:04:34,312
and married Judge Hankin's daughter.

935
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,970
Like an alcoholic takes a cure.

936
01:04:40,645 --> 01:04:43,077
I thought you were unconscionably put out.

937
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:47,475
Now I see it's the rage of Caliban
on seeing his own refection in the glass.

938
01:04:50,013 --> 01:04:52,377
I may share your instincts,
but I've always resisted them.

939
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,672
that's what cost young Stainer his life.

940
01:04:54,779 --> 01:04:57,109
He was a neurotic and an hysteric!

941
01:04:57,213 --> 01:04:59,372
''deny me and I'll kill myself.''
He was always crying wolf.

942
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:03,379
what did happen to Stainer?

943
01:05:05,513 --> 01:05:08,001
when we were up at Cambridge together...

944
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,806
we became very good friends for a while.

945
01:05:10,912 --> 01:05:13,105
He was clever and amusing.

946
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:17,344
but quite unstable
and completely possessive.

947
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:21,738
one night he telephoned to say
he was going to kill himself.

948
01:05:22,846 --> 01:05:25,869
I didn't believe him.
He had said it before.

949
01:05:27,612 --> 01:05:29,340
but apparently this time he meant it.

950
01:05:30,979 --> 01:05:32,445
And that's all there was to it.

951
01:05:32,546 --> 01:05:34,841
All this ancient history
isn't getting us anywhere.

952
01:05:34,946 --> 01:05:37,037
did you or didn't you? who cares?

953
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:41,135
what you've got to do now is to forget any
ideas you've got about exposing these people.

954
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:43,575
bring them down and we come with them.

955
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,407
-Just pay.
- You pay, Calloway.

956
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:50,769
I shall make my own decision.

957
01:06:33,046 --> 01:06:34,511
darling.

958
01:06:35,612 --> 01:06:37,272
darling, come home. It's cold.

959
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:44,245
- been awake all night?
- Yes, I've been awake.

960
01:06:44,346 --> 01:06:46,335
Looking at myself.

961
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:55,474
when you told me about Phil Stainer,
it was over, in the past.

962
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,208
I was young and conceited,
I suppose.

963
01:07:00,246 --> 01:07:02,575
I thought marriage would make you content.

964
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:06,378
I was wrong.

965
01:07:08,213 --> 01:07:10,576
that impulse is still there.

966
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:13,077
there hasn't been a day
that I haven't thanked God for you.

967
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:15,610
Mel, I'm not a life belt
for you to cling to.

968
01:07:15,712 --> 01:07:18,701
I'm a woman,
and I want to be loved for myself.

969
01:07:19,545 --> 01:07:21,273
I do love you.

970
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:27,500
If he was alive and standing beside me,
who would you choose?

971
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:32,805
You've had your answer to that.

972
01:07:36,113 --> 01:07:37,840
but he's still in your heart.

973
01:07:43,479 --> 01:07:46,105
I feel completely destroyed.

974
01:07:57,313 --> 01:07:58,778
Have coffee tonight?

975
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:03,375
0 Chattering l

976
01:08:08,912 --> 01:08:12,367
there's a real charnel house atmosphere
in this place today, Mickey.

977
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:15,378
Ghastly. I shall be glad
when we can get back to Cheltenham.

978
01:08:15,479 --> 01:08:18,037
we'll go home after we've made
the last collection.

979
01:08:18,146 --> 01:08:21,203
Shh! Eddy's on his soapbox again.

980
01:08:21,313 --> 01:08:24,676
Henry paid rates and taxes at his shop
the same as everybody else.

981
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:26,938
but they knew he couldn't
go out and call the cops...

982
01:08:27,046 --> 01:08:29,978
so he just stood there watching
while these bastards broke up the shop.

983
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,874
You don't know
it happened that way.

984
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:33,911
It couldn't have happened
any other way.

985
01:08:34,013 --> 01:08:35,535
Eh, Phip?

986
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:39,043
I don't like to think about it, old mate.
No joy there.

987
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:41,169
- Call for you, Mr. Mortimer.
- Who is it?

988
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,268
Some bloke.
Said, ''tell him Sandy.''

989
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:53,769
- Madge.
- what?

990
01:08:55,946 --> 01:08:58,935
- oh, what are you drinking?
- 0 Chuckles l oh, no more for me, dear.

991
01:08:59,046 --> 01:09:00,511
I'm working today.

992
01:09:00,612 --> 01:09:03,010
Modeling corsets at Hobday and Rouse's.

993
01:09:03,113 --> 01:09:06,238
Hope they've got the studio warm.

''Contact your wife''?

1162
01:20:39,512 --> 01:20:41,239
Has someone been to the house?

1163
01:20:42,012 --> 01:20:43,308
No.

1164
01:20:43,412 --> 01:20:44,877
what does it mean?

1165
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,406
there was something on the garage door.

1166
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:55,135
big letters in paint.

1167
01:20:56,212 --> 01:20:57,677

1168

I don't want to tell you.

1169
01:21:01,312 --> 01:21:02,937

1170
01:21:07,012 --> 01:21:09,274
''Farr is queer.''

1171
01:21:39,845 --> 01:21:42,073

All these instructions?

and how to pay it.

1174

the dirty words on the garage door

1175
01:21:50,212 --> 01:21:54,508

be included in the sphere of operations too.

A man who is paying blackmail...

1179
01:22:06,978 --> 01:22:10,069

He's a perfect barometer of public morality.

1183
01:22:23,278 --> 01:22:25,107
In any case, he's right.

1184
01:22:26,578 --> 01:22:29,772
but if I hand the blackmailer
over to the police...

1185
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:31,776

I shan't expect to find you there.

for a bit of a shock.

how this is all going to end, and I -

I don't want it to burst in your face.

1206
01:24:18,478 --> 01:24:20,740
I see the implication, sir.

1207
01:24:20,845 --> 01:24:23,311
but this couldn't be
the basis of any charge.

1208
01:24:25,711 --> 01:24:27,177

Yes.

1217
01:24:57,212 --> 01:25:00,042

Ha! You hear that, Phip?
You're a victim.

1325
01:33:41,277 --> 01:33:43,675
I'm afraid you're barking up
the wrong tree there, mister.

1326
01:33:43,778 --> 01:33:46,971
It's a question of dog eat dog,
isn't it, Phip?

1327
01:33:48,177 --> 01:33:51,803
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't pay them any more money.

1328
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:55,033
then they said...

1329
01:33:55,144 --> 01:33:57,372
if I gave the names of my friends...

1330
01:33:58,111 --> 01:34:00,543
they'd give me back
a letter every time.

1331
01:34:00,644 --> 01:34:02,905
what do you think of our littleJudas?

1332
01:34:03,011 --> 01:34:05,477
- Revolting spectacle, isn't he?
- Come on.

1333
01:34:05,578 --> 01:34:07,544
one moment, please. Shoes.

1334
01:34:15,578 --> 01:34:17,043
Coat.

1335
01:34:20,977 --> 01:34:22,102
Ready.

1336
01:34:24,044 --> 01:34:26,908
It's the ungodly in great power, all right.

1337
01:34:27,011 --> 01:34:30,307
And fourishing like the green bay tree.

1338
01:34:30,411 --> 01:34:32,377
but we'll have our say in court though.

1339
01:34:32,478 --> 01:34:33,943
tsk, tsk, tsk.

1340
01:34:35,444 --> 01:34:37,672
on your feet. Move.

1341
01:34:37,778 --> 01:34:41,335
don't charge me under my real name. I've got
money coming to me, quite a bit of money.

1342
01:34:41,444 --> 01:34:43,808
I wouldn't mind sharing it.
I'm not greedy. I'd sign a note.

1343
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:46,399
I'll walk him downstairs, sir.

1344
01:34:49,977 --> 01:34:52,875
They're gonna be very vicious
when they do get into court, sir.

1345
01:34:52,977 --> 01:34:55,170
don't worry, Harris.
I shan't let you down.

1346
01:34:55,277 --> 01:34:56,709
No, sir.

1347
01:34:58,678 --> 01:35:00,143
what do you think they'll get?

1348
01:35:01,378 --> 01:35:03,207
with your evidence, the limit.

1349
01:35:03,311 --> 01:35:07,505
barrett's death, and that little hairdresser
fellow Henry are bound to weigh against them.

1350
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:09,076
well, I'm glad we've got them.

1351
01:35:09,177 --> 01:35:12,234
but it seems tragic that your career
has to go west in the getting.

1352
01:35:12,344 --> 01:35:16,037
Somebody once called this law
against homosexuals the blackmailers'charter.

1353
01:35:17,944 --> 01:35:20,137
Is that how you feel about it?

1354
01:35:20,244 --> 01:35:23,005
I'm a policeman, sir.
I don't have feelings.

1355
01:35:23,777 --> 01:35:27,540
well, if you come with me now, sir. It'll be
helpful if we can have your statement right away.

1356
01:35:27,644 --> 01:35:29,200
Yes.

1357
01:35:55,678 --> 01:35:57,143
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1358
01:35:57,244 --> 01:35:59,710
You've just missed Mr. Patterson.

1359
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,276
Mr. Patterson?

1360
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:03,876
Mel?

1361
01:36:05,011 --> 01:36:06,477
Mel, I -

1362
01:36:09,144 --> 01:36:11,042
I didn't expect to see you here.

1363
01:36:12,844 --> 01:36:14,572
what did william want?

1364
01:36:14,678 --> 01:36:16,939
He came to tell me
you'd been to the police.

1365
01:36:19,411 --> 01:36:21,570
I see.

1366
01:36:21,678 --> 01:36:23,973
How long before
the case becomes public?

1367
01:36:25,211 --> 01:36:27,404
there'll be a remand
at the magistrate's hearing tomorrow.

1368
01:36:27,511 --> 01:36:30,102
I've got about, uh, three weeks.

1369
01:36:30,877 --> 01:36:32,366
three days, you mean.

1370
01:36:33,611 --> 01:36:36,008
You can't hope to keep this
out of the press.

1371
01:36:36,111 --> 01:36:39,669
It's not as though you can go into court as Mr. X.
You're -You're too well known.

1372
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:41,843
I don't want to.

1373
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:45,909
I believe that if I go into court as myself...

1374
01:36:46,011 --> 01:36:49,171
I can draw attention
to the fault in the existing law.

1375
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:53,835
- Knowing it will destroy you utterly.
- Yes.

1376
01:36:58,378 --> 01:37:00,707
we're going to need each other
very much, aren't we?

1377
01:37:03,944 --> 01:37:05,069
No. No.

1378
01:37:05,177 --> 01:37:07,405
I'm going to go through this alone.

1379
01:37:07,511 --> 01:37:10,443
I don't want you here when it happens.

1380
01:37:10,544 --> 01:37:14,101
I started this thing.
I've hurt you terribly, I know that.

1381
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:19,672
but I can just get through it to the end
if you are not here to face the final humiliations.

1382
01:37:22,277 --> 01:37:24,505
they're going to call me filthy names.

1383
01:37:26,177 --> 01:37:30,109
My friends are going to lower their eyes,
and my enemies say they always guessed.

1384
01:37:31,677 --> 01:37:34,542
I don't want you a part
of that Roman holiday.

1385
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,970
I love you too deeply for that.

1386
01:37:39,077 --> 01:37:40,770
Shall I come back?

1387
01:37:43,844 --> 01:37:45,071
You, um -

1388
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:49,069
You must have time to -

1389
01:37:49,177 --> 01:37:51,665
0 Clears throat l
You must have time to decide that for yourself.

1390
01:37:51,777 --> 01:37:53,505
0 Clearing throat l

1391
01:37:55,378 --> 01:37:57,105
If you can -

1392
01:38:00,643 --> 01:38:02,473
If you can bear to...

1393
01:38:04,677 --> 01:38:08,803
afterwards, when it's all over
and the shouting's stopped.

1394
01:38:11,977 --> 01:38:14,170
because it's then
that I'm going to need you.

1395
01:38:16,211 --> 01:38:18,006
I'm going to need you so desperately.

1396
01:38:20,744 --> 01:38:21,869
''Need''?

1397
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:25,301
It's a bigger word than ''love.''

1398
01:38:29,244 --> 01:38:30,869
Suddenly I feel very strong.

1399
01:38:35,944 --> 01:38:37,842
Strong enough?

1400
01:38:40,011 --> 01:38:41,909
I think so.
