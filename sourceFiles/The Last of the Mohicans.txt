we have enough here
to fill the county levy,

from this General
Marquis de Montcalm

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,170
and therefore scant need
of a colonial militia
in the second,

120
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,960
because the French
haven't the nature for war.

Their Latinate
voluptuousness

122

their Gallic laziness.
And the result is,
