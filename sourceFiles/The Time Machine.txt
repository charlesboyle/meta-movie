3
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,920
-But Professor
-No.The answers are all there in the test.

4
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,660

5
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,804
Aren't you
forgetting something?

6
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:23,036
I know. It's something to do with
the third differential coefficient.

7
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,577
- Not that. Tonight.
- What?

8
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,136
Emma?

9
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,308
-What time is it?
-Almost 5:00

10
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,875
Oh,God.

11
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,994
My proposal for utilizing
solarpower, rejected.

12
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,057
My concepts for harnessing
micro-energy waves, rejected.

13
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:53,128
The dean suggests that I focus on something that
might actually help mankind.

14
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,265
Like his study on the benefits
of tobacco consumption.

15
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,004
Alex, the problem is
your ideas are a bit too... radical.

16
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,876
The problem is with
the faculty. They're dinosaurs.

17
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,178
They're already extinct,
they just don't know it.

18
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,277
They'll be discovered by some future 
archaeologist, and he won't know what to make of them.

19
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,652
Their dim little eyes,
de void of any curiosity--

20
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,089
Alex, it's your first year
as associate professor.

21
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,390
You might want to play things
a little more conservatively.

22
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,862
You sound just like my father.

23
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,732
Look at them, Philby. All alike.
All in identical bowler hats.

24
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,032
Do you want your students
to turn out like that?

25
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,972
I want my students prepared
for the realities of the world
they're about to greet.

26
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,445
Well, I don't. I want them to run along this 
street and knock off every bowler they see.

27
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,474
Mrs. Watchit!

28
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,849
Oh, huzzah, the master's home.

29
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,820
-Did you get it?
-Hello, Mr. Philby.

30
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,551
Hello, Mrs.Watchit.
You're looking in the pink.

31
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,026
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up
and down these stairs like a wee lad.

32
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,086
-Don't torture me. Did you get it?
-I got it.

33
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,598
-Good. Let me see.
-But don'tyou think for one moment...

34
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,328
I'm going to let you go out
in that filthy jacket.

35
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,963
Now, go in there and change.

36
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:09,346
And you've got another letter
from that annoying little man.

37
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,816
Well, go ahead.
Switch it on.

38
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:17,413
- It'll help people keep
their teeth well into their 40s.

39
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,256
-You might think about having that cleaned.
-Oh, who has the time?

40
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,660
-How did you know with Molly?
-Know what?

41
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,895
-You were meant to be together.
-She made the best shepherd's pie I ever tasted.

42
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,936
Don't you have a single
romantic bone in your body?

43
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,872
No. I'm all bowler hat.

45
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,876
Why doy ou waste your time
on that crackpot?

46
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,415
Because he has some
very interesting ideas.

47
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,442
A professor at Columbia should not be 
corresponding with a crazy German bookkeeper.

48
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,681
He's a patent clerk,
not a bookkeeper.

49
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,590
I think Mr. Einstein deserves
all the support I can give him.

50
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,652
I wonder if we'll ever
go too far?

51
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,697
-With what?
-With this.

52
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,825
With all of this.

53
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,028
No such thing.

54
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,333
All right. How do I look?

55
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,310
Practically decent. Really, Alex.
Good luck tonight.

56
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,541
She's a fine girl. She's done
wonderful things for you.

57
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,415
Don't worry. You still have that
alluring smell of chalk.

58
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,579
Oh, gotta hurry.

59
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,819
Now, that's more like it.
You look a proper gentleman for once.

60
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,418
Well, you better hope so. If Emma
turns me down, you'll be next.

61
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,726
-Oh, I'm already swooning.


62
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,132
All right. Wish me luck.

63
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,941
Thank you.

64
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:55,249
Fresh flowers. Fresh flowers.

65
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,749
-Have some flowers, sir.
-Not tonight, thanks.

66
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,127
No. I promised her flowers.

68
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,007
Spectacular.

69
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,909
Spectacular waste of money.
Damn thing's always breaking down.

70
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,573
Do you need a lift?
-Yes, yes.

71
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,015
-How do you keep the water temperature stable?
- There's a cantilevered gasket...

72
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,383
- on the fuel regulator--

73
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,480
Oh, God. Uh


74
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,550
Much obliged.
I'm always forgetting the damn brake.

75
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,462
Hop in. I'll give you a perambulation
before it breaks down again.

76
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,695
Oh, uh, I'm afraid
I have a prior engagement.

77
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,431
Well, another time then.
We perambulate here most every night.

78
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,166
Certainly.

79
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:53,668
-Get a horse!

80
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,737
Yes.

81
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,545
Alexander?

82
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,710

83
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,327
-Oh! Whoa.


84
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:47,992
-You're late, Professor.
-I got here as soon as I could.

85
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:52,504
Well, they say it's all the rage
in Paris. But I just picked it up--

86
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:57,908
- Five dollars at Macy's.
Silly, isn't it?
- Very silly. I like it.

87
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,572
Well, where are they?

88
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,911
-What?
-The flowers.

89
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,349
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?

90
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,718
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, I was distracted.

91
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,121
Well, there's something new.

92
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,820
-Uh, Emma, I need to talk to you.

94
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,932
-Oh, uh, shall we walk through the park?
-Yes.

95
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:36,238
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
you're not coming down with something.

96
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,812
Well, I'm afraid I am.

97
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:45,790
I'm not sleeping very well, and even
when I'm awake, I'm not much use.

98
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,851
I can't eat or think
or do much of anything anymore.

99
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,195
And the worst part is,
I don't know that I'll ever be well.

100
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,797
I think there's only one remedy,
and that's foryou to marry me...

101
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,708
- and spend the rest of your life with me.


102
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,444
Oh, Emma, I know it's right.
I know we're meant to be together.

103
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,614
It's the only thing in my entire life
I've never had to think about.

104
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,782
Oh, Alex.

105
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,394
Uh-Uh, wait.
I have something foryou.

106
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:33,632
You know, the moment is rather dying here.

107
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,539
I know.
Hold on. Oh.

108
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,586
-I know it's not a diamond.
-A moonstone.

109
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,625
Well, it's your birthstone.
I thought--

110
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,526
You thought right.

112
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:10,398
I just might cry.

113
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:14,469
I couldn't help but overhear.

114
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:20,383
Two fine young people starting out
on the road oflife.

115
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,819
-I wish you the very best.

116
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,449
-Well, thankyou.
-And as much as I hate to do this

117
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:31,189
moved as I am by your...
protestations of love

118
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,528
I'll be needing your money now.

119
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,728
-Sir?
-And your jewelry too.

120
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:42,399
I guess we could call this your first little 
bump on the road to marital bliss.

121
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,138
-I don't understand
-Don't make a scene.There's no cause for that.

122
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,545
-Just give me your wallet, will you?
- Hmm?

123
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,051
Did you hear me, lad?

124
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,987
Uh, all right, all right.
Here. That's everything.

125
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,292
And your watch.

126
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,426
And the gloves.

127
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:16,330
-And the ring.
-No.

128
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,344
I'm afraid so, darling.

129
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:24,509
-And maybe he'll buy you a diamond now.
-Please, please. Not that.

130
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,108
Don't!

132
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:41,395
Why did you do that?
It's only a ring.

134
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,900
Emma?

135
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,545
Emma?

136
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,610
Oh!

138
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:43,021
- What?

139
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:55,501
Oh. Oh, sir,
Mr. Philby's here.

140
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,873
- Here?
- Yes, sir. He insisted on coming

141
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,438
-Tell him to go away. I'm busy.
-I won't go away, Alex.

142
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,450
My God.
What's happened toyou?

143
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,154
I've been
I've been working.

144
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,888
You remember that?
You used to care about your work.

145
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,625
I care more about my life.
And yours.

146
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,190
I came by the house every day
after the funeral...

147
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,170
and every week
and every other month.

148
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:30,402
Then I stopped coming.
Did you even notice?

149
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:35,209
-It hurt me, Alex... very much.
-Then why are you here now?

150
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,739
- There are some things I have to say you 
may not like hearing. I know. I know.

151
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,777
You're concerned. I know.
I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.

152
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,552
But really...
I need you to go.

153
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,458
- I won't leave. Not with you hiding down here.
- I'm not hiding.

154
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:53,020
You know that's what it is.Mrs.Watchit
says you're in here all hours,day and night.

155
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,931
Alex, will you please
stand still and look at me!

156
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,935
It wasn't your fault.

157
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:09,912
No. It wasn't my fault.

158
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:15,545
Maybe we should blame Mrs. Watchit for
picking up the ring from the jeweler.

159
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,886
Or the jeweler for making it.

160
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,952
Or the poor bastard who tore
the stone from the earth.

161
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,398
Maybe I should blame you for introducing 
me to Emma in the first place. Yes.

162
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:33,234
Alexander, nothing will ever 
change what happened.

163
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:38,641
No, you're wrong,
because I will change it.

164
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,875
David, I appreciate
your concern. I do.

165
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,076
But I ask you to have faith in me.

166
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,314
Well, I want to have
faith in you, Alex, but

167
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,620
Wha What are
What are you doing here?

168
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:58,686
I'll tell you what.Why don't you come by
for dinner in a week, and I'll show you?

169
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:03,133
-Why don't you come home with me now? Molly
-Did you not hear me, David?

170
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,906
I can't leave when I'm so close.

171
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,642
All right. We'll continue
this conversation in a week.

172
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,884
In a week, we'll never even
have had this conversation.

179
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,408
Ah. Thank you, my good man.

181
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,966
You're early.
That's a first.

182
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:09,070
I wanted to see you.

183
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,548
Well, where are they?

184
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:16,020
-What?
-The flowers.

185
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,922
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?

187
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,669
You never cease
to surprise me.

188
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,142
Emma, I need to talk toyou.

189
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,618
-Shall we walk through the park?
-No!

190
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,053
No.

191
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:56,558
No. Let's go into the city.

192
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,290
-Alex, what is it?
-Nothing. Let'sjust hurry.

193
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:04,324
Running along is all very well for you.
You're not wearing a corset.

195
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,465
-Bleecker Street, and be quick about it.

196
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,592
Now you're all gallant.

197
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:51,179
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
you're not coming down with something.

198
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,812
No, no. I'm fine.

199
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:00,654
I'm wonderful. I'm walking down
the street with you again.

200
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,559
But we took a walk
three days ago.

201
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:08,328
Well, not like this.
Never like this.

202
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,837
-Heavens, look at that car.
-Oh, I've seen it.

203
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:17,773
Now I know you're ill. You're passing up
the chance to explore some new gadget.

204
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:22,678
-It's only a machine.
-Alexander, tell me what's going on.

205
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,616
-Is something wrong?
-No.

206
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,677
No.
Emma, listen to me.

207
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,156
I need to leave you now, but I want you
to go straight home and stay there.

208
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:38,060
I promise you I'll come by sometime later tonight,
and I won't make any sense.

209
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,463
I'll be all upset thatyou didn't meet
me in the park, butyou must trust me.

210
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,525
Everything will be all right.

211
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,839
Just know how much I love you,
how much I'll always love you.

212
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,107
All right.

213
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,621
But first, where are my flowers?

214
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,391
-Flowers it is.

215
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,796
Wait right there.
Don't move.

217
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,201
-Oh, can I help you, sir?
-Yes, a dozen roses. White.

218
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,214
-No, no. Red.
-Look out!

221
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:55,370
- Easy. Easy.

222
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,388
I'm looking for Professor Hart degen.

223
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:32,370
Alex, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

224
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,875
-This was not supposed to happen.
-Ofcourse not.

225
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:43,811
-I know there's nothing I can say.
-We were out ofthe park, Philby.

226
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,221
We were safe.

227
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,019
Why can't I change it?

228
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,000
I could come back a thousand times.

229
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,062
See her die a thousand ways.

230
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,539
I don't--
I don't understand.

231
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,945
I can't find the answer here.

232
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,309
Not here.

233
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,288
Not now.

238
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,267

Thank you.

256

That thing.

00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,484
I didn't seeyou there.

270
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,521
I always seem to have that effect.
How may I helpyou, sir?

271
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,650
-What is that thing?
-That is my photonic memory core,

272
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,025
or P.M.C.,as we say in the trade.

273
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,844
Over here, sir.

274
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,414
What are you?

275
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:56,510
I'm the Fifth Avenue Public Library 
information unit, Vox registration NY-1 1 4.

276
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,852
How may I help you?

277
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:04,361
- A stereopticon of some sort.
- Stereopticon? Oh, no, sir.

278
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,590
I am a third-generation,
fusion-powered photonic,

279
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,656
with verbal and visual link capabilities
connected to every database...

280
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:13,397
on the planet.

281
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,598
Photonic?

282
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:20,042
A compendium of all human knowledge.

283
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:24,639
-Oh.
-Area of inquiry?

284
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,208
-Do you know anything about physics?
-Ah, accessing physics.

285
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,153
Mechanical engineering.

286
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,123
Dimensional optics.
Chronography.

287
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:38,856
Temporal causality,
temporal paradox.

288
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,125
-Time travel?
-Yes.

289
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,827
Accessing science fiction.

290
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:48,839
No, no. Practical application.
My question is why can't one change the past?

291
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:54,676
Because one cannot travel
into the past.

292
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,575
-Wh-What if one could?
-One cannot.

293
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,487
Excuse me, this is something
you should trust me on.

294
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,548
Accessing the writings
of Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells,

295
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,821
Harlan Ellison,
Alexander Hartdegen--

296
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:14,991
-Tell me about him.
-Alexander Hartdegen, 1869 to 1903.

297
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,967
American scientist
given to eccentric postulation.

298
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,335
Found writings include treatise
on the creation ofa time machine.

299
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,172
-Tell me about the time machine.
-Time Machine was written by H.G. Wells in 1894.

300
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,179
It was a motion picture by George Pal and
a stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber--

301
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,478
-That's not what I mean.
-Would you like to hear selections from the score?

302
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,316
- No.
- There's a place called tomorrow

303
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,823
A place of joy
not of sorrow

304
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,860
Can't you see
it's a place for you and--

305
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,487
Thank you.
That's quite enough.

306
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,725
Will there be anything else?

307
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,134
Uh, no. No, I think I'll have better
luck in a few hundred years.

308
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:56,196
Live long and prosper.

311
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:47,188
Sir, where is your
designated evacuation center?

312
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,283
Sir, you are subject
to arrest under martial law--

313
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
Please putyour hands out,
palms together.

314
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,457
You will be held in detention until your 
evacuation center clears you for transport.

315
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,092
-Wait, wait!
-Just take it easy.

316
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:01,002
- Hey, we got to get out of here!
- Wait. How did this happen?

317
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,905
The moon. Come on.
Move it.

318
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:09,311
-That's impossible. What happened?
-You been living under a rock?

319
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,611
Yes, I've been living under a rock.
Now, tell me.

321
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,750
The demolitions for the lunar colonies
screwed up the orbit, okay?

322
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,781
The moon's breaking up.
All right? Come on.

323
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,898
- Hey! Forget him! Come on!

327
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,850
Emma?

330
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,382
Shh!

334
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,717
Hello?

335
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,889
Hello.

336
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:54,453
- Don't be afraid.

337
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,765
Oh, wait.
Don't-- Don't go.

341
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,596
Wait. I just want to talk toyou.

345
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,103
- Hello.

346
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:12,006
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't understand you.

347
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,476
-Do you know my words?
-Yes.

350
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:23,112
The lex.
The stone language.

351
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,918
The stone language? But do you
understand me? Do you understand me?

352
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,983
We all learn it when we're young.

353
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,791
They tor'jen.
Forget. They forget it.

354
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,594
- But I teach.

356
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:50,536
-What is he saying? They're trying to decide
if we should throw you in the river.

357
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:55,176
Tell me quickly, and tell me the truth.
Where do you come from?

358
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,982
Well, actually, I'm from here.
Uh,just not from now.

359
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:06,462
You see, I built a machine that allows
me to travel through time.

360
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,328
I'm from the past.

361
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,231
Oh.

363
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,752
I told them you hit your head...

364
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,588
and you are a wandering idiot.

366
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,740
-What areyou doing?
-Getting ready for the mor.

367
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:59,044
-The night.
-Oh. I'll come with you.

368
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,803
-Eloi?
-What are your people named?

369
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,208
Well, I-I guess
you'd call us New Yorkers.

370
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,715
New Yorkers.
Are they friendly?

371
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,945
Until you talk to them.

372
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:41,822
-Tell me about your village.
-It's a very busy place.

373
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,623
Everyone seems to be in a hurry.
And they all wear identical bowler hats.

374
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,591
Little black round things
on their heads.

375
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:54,604
-What do you do there?
-Well, I was a teacher like Mara.

376
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,800
-And I make things.
-Me also.

377
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:03,040
I made a sess'quin'tan with my father.
We still use it.

378
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,910
A sess'quin'tan?

379
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,645
Mara, der'enjen'wenlen?

380
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:13,520
Sess'quin'tan.
Steps of rope.

381
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,719
Oh, a rope ladder.

382
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,955
We can make one.
I will teach you.

384
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:25,332
Will you tell me more lon'el
on the next day?

385
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,599
Tomorrow?
Yes, I will.

386
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:32,164
Why don't you take care
ofthis for me tonight?

387
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,643
-Thank you.

388
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,021
-Good night.
-Good night.

389
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:02,262
Kalen will tire you if you let him.
He's always been questioning.

390
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,831
Our parents were firm,
but it is his way.

391
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:16,551
-Where are your parents?
-They've gone from this place.

392
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,987
Oh, I'm sorry.

393
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:46,009
You were right,Philby. I did go too far.

394
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,743
Sit with me.

395
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,356
Mara, why do you 
pull the boats up at night?

396
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,422
Afraid they'll be stolen?

397
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,367
Stolen?
I do not know that word.

398
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:09,201
Well, are you afraid that
someone will take them?

399
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,709
-It is just more safe this way.
-Oh.

400
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:17,270
-You must do things to be safe where
you come from? Offcourse.

401
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,917
Or when you come from.

402
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:27,150
Ah, so I'm not just a wandering idiot.

404
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:40,268
Col'mar.

405
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,237
Maybe we could find some tomorrow.

406
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,007
Flowers?

408
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,903
Alexander. Alexander.

411
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:45,629
Ah!Morlock!

414
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,781
-Is he all right?
-He had a dream.

415
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,841
Oh. So did I.

416
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,049
I was moving through a jungle--

417
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,094
And you saw a shape a head of you.

418
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:49,826
Well, a face that...
called my name.

419
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,960
We all have that dream.

420
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,938
-All of you?
-Yes. Now go back asleep.

421
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:02,672
You're still not well.

422
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:06,079
What does that mean,
'' Morlock''?

423
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:11,109
A child's dream.
No more.

424
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:14,021
Goback asleep.


426
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:40,109
We keep these stones in many places.

427
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:44,176
This is the room where my parents
taught me for the first time.

428
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:57,165
Why do you learn this language
ifyou don't use it?

429
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,761
It's a tradition we hand down.

430
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,796
It meant something once.
Must be here for a reason.

431
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:10,877
''One generation passeth away,
and another cometh.

432
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,179
But the earth abideth forever.''

433
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:21,858
Why have you come here?

434
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:24,393
Why have you traveled
through time?

435
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,453
To have a question answered.

436
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,056
Question?

437
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,966
Yes. Why can't I change the past?

438
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,334
Why would you want to?

439
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:44,643
You've lost someone.

440
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,808
Someone you loved very much.

441
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,231
-Mara, why are there no older people here?
-What do you mean?

442
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,465
Older people, your parents' age
or grandparents' age.

443
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,507
They've gone from this place.

444
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,873
You mean, they're dead?

445
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:16,879
Yes.

446
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:21,407
All of them?
How is that possible?

447
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,682
There are things
better left not said.

448
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:29,522
We don't dwell
on the past, Alexander.

449
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,426
-We do something else.
-What?

450
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:36,125
We remember them...

451
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,690
with these.

452
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,484
Alexander!

453
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,825
Alexander.

454
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,467
-Are you coming to work now? Come with me
-No.

455
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,508
Alexander's not well enough.
We're going to see his machine.

456
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:24,980
- Now?
-Stay with Toren.

457
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:29,951
-Go the next day, tomorrow.
-I need to see that it's all right.

458
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,547
-This way.

459
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,993
Will you tell me more about
New York tonight?

460
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,393
I will.

461
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:29,435
Oh, good.
It seems fine.

462
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,505
We had quite a ride together.

463
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,417
-It's ready?
-Appears so.

464
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:41,150
Will you use it now?
Go back toyour own time?

465
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:46,451
Well, I  I guess I could.

466
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,866
Uh...

467
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,536
it seems so long ago.

468
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,765
No. You should go.

469
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,868
And I need to ask,
will you take Kalen with you?

470
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:06,746
- Why? Alexander, take him away,
back to your time. Will you?

471
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:10,308
-Mara, why?
-Please. You don't know.

472
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,584
-Take him away from here.

473
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,592
Kalen!

474
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,066
Mara, what's going on?

475
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,697
They're early!
We must get Kalen!

481
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,847
Kalen!

482
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,623
Kalen! Kalen!

488
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,250
Mara!

489
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,922
-Kalen!
-No, stay here.

490
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:45,467
Stay in the group!

491
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,241
Run!

493
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,675
Mara!

496
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,122
Mara!

497
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:42,303
Where did they take them?

498
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:46,109
- We have to follow them.We have to find them.
- We do not. Col'quin tor.

499
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:50,551
- Why not?
- This is nem Eloi'tas, our life here.

500
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,956
- How can you just do nothing?
- How can tor'tasal'mor.

501
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,393
- It is the day and the night.
- The day and the night.

502
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:04,229
-This is the world.


503
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,600
-Why don't you fight back?


504
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:12,232
Fight back. Why not?

505
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:17,940
Those who farquil'pax...
fight--

506
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,744
are taken first.

508
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:28,587
- Kalen, do you know where they're taken?
- No.

509
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,592
-Do they ever come back?
-No.

510
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,855
-Has anyone ever followed them?
-I don't know.

511
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,295
-Well, what about the Morlocks? There must be 
a leader. We're not supposed to talk.

512
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,526
Kalen, listen to me.
Listen.

513
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,626
Sometimes we need to accept what's happening
to us even if we don't want to.

514
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:45,299
And other times we have to fight,
even ifwe're afraid.

515
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:49,277
Now, it's difficult
to understand, I know.

516
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:52,974
Believe me, I know.
Now, they're afraid,

517
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:56,314
and I'm asking you not to be.

518
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:59,287
So will you tell me
whatyou know?

519
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:03,121
We can save her.
Please.

520
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:09,791
When they go,
we're not supposed to talk about it.

521
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:16,504
-But we all know the place.
-What place?

522
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:21,271
Where the ghosts are.

524
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,934
Here it is.

527
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:26,067
Welcome to VOXsystem.
How may I help you?

528
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:30,340
-It's all right.
-How may I serve you?

529
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,780
What can I get you?
Oh, let's see.

530
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,785
Um, Henry James.
Oh, no. Yes?

531
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:42,052
No, no, no. Too depressing. Hemingway,
perhaps? No. Too sweaty.

532
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,390
Plato, Proust, Pinter,
Poe, Pound?

533
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:48,328
No. Complete Works of Martha Stewart?

534
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:53,835
Ah, I have it!
Jules Verne.

535
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:57,100
- Right up your alley, I would think.
- Photonic, right?

536
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:00,870
Or what's left of one.
What's left of all of them.

537
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:06,074
I am the last, and "these fragments
I have shored against my ruins."

538
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,117
T.S. Eliot.

539
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:12,746
You wouldn't know him yet,
but he is so depressing, yet so divine.

540
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:19,685
Oh, I'm sorry. The lending library
is temporarily out ofservice.

541
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:24,756
Not to worry. I have them all right
here-- every page of every volume.

542
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,860
Can you tell me
what's happening here?

543
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:31,100
Well, my sources are
no longer fully annotated,

544
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:35,611
and my information is somewhat anecdotal, 
but I believe what was once one race...

545
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,908
is now two.

546
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,472
One above and one below.

547
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,714
Two distinct species that have evolved.

548
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:48,883
-And how do those below survive?
-Thatis therealquestion, isn'tit?

550
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,863
-I don't believe it.
-Well,

551
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:04,100
if you don't like the answers,
you should avoid asking the questions.

552
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:11,005
Look at them.
They have no knowledge ofthe past,

553
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,743
noambition forthe future.

554
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:19,151
-So lucky.
-Why would you say something like that?

555
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:26,818
Can you even imagine what it's like
to remember everything?

556
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:31,265
I remember a six-year-old girl who asked me
about dinosaurs 800,000 years ago.

557
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:36,704
I remember the last book I recommended:
Look Homeward,Angel, byThomas Wolfe.

558
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:41,175
And yes, I even remember you.

559
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:50,349
Time travel:practical application.

560
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:54,617
How do you know about the Morlocks
if you can't leave this place?

561
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:59,423
There was one Eloi who managed
to escape. He told me everything.

562
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:08,499
We spent years together, just talking.

563
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:14,534
The conversation's a little spotty now,
but I do remember.

564
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:19,638
-It's good to have a friend.
-Then you can help us find the Morlocks,

565
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,683
find Mara.

566
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,654
And if the truth is so horrible,
and will haunt your dreams for all time?

567
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:34,093
Well, I think I'm used to that.

568
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:44,003
My friend said he came from the east,
from thejungle.

569
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:49,210
-Will you describe it?
-I don't have to.

570
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:55,144
Just follow the breathing.

574
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:33,312
In the dream, we're moving toward it,
but I think it was meant to keep us away.

575
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:41,886
-I might just go in by myself.
-No.

576
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:46,901
Mara would be very cross with me
if you got hurt. Now, I'll find her,

577
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:51,065
but I need you to go back
to the village and light a fire
so we can find ourway home.

578
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,132
-All right? Will you do that for me?
-I lost your pocket watch.

579
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:58,408
They took it from my room.

580
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,915
I'm sorry.

581
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,256
Why would they take it?


585
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:04,579
Oh. Stupid.

595
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,301
Mara?

604
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,827
Mara?

605
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,954
Mara.

606
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,866
Mara?

607
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:57,608
Come a little closer.
I don't bite.

608
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,763
Do I surprise you?

609
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:19,232
-A little. Yes.
-Hmm.

610
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:25,171
We weren't always like this.
After the moon fell from the sky,

611
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,336
the Earth could no longer
sustain the species.

612
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:32,380
Some managed to stay above.

613
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:35,975
The rest of us escaped underground.

614
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:41,489
Then centuries later,when we tried to re-emerge
into the sun again, we couldn't.

615
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:47,291
So we bred ourselves into castes.

616
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,924
Some to be our eyes and ears.

617
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:55,333
-Some to be our muscles and sinews.
-You mean, your hunters.

618
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:03,107
Yes. Bred to be predators,
but bred also to be controlled.

619
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:07,239
You see,my caste concentrated...

620
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:10,615
on expanding our cerebral abilities.

621
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:16,022
-You control their thoughts.
-Notj ust theirs.

622
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,991
The Eloi.

623
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:25,432
So it's not enough that you hunt
them down like animals.

624
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,494
-That's their role here.
-To beyour food?

625
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,567
Yes.

626
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:38,011
And for those who are suitable,
to be breeding vessels...

627
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,243
for our other colonies.

628
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:45,616
You see,
I'm just one of many.

629
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:49,987
I don't understand how you can sit there
and speak so coldly about this.

630
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:57,456
Have you not considered the human
cost of-- of what it is you're doing?

631
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,696
We all pay a price...

632
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,438
Alexander.

634
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,113
Don't worry.You're safe.

635
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:22,514
I control them.

636
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:26,027
Without that control,

637
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:29,791
they would exhaust the food supply...

638
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,732
in a matter of months.

639
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:36,794
Food supply?
They're human beings!

640
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:39,033
Who are you...

641
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:43,009
to question 800,000 years...

642
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,680
of evolution?

643
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,652
-This is-- This is a perversion
of every natural law.


644
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:58,626
And what is time travel but your pathetic
attempt to control the world around you,

645
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:03,825
-your futile effort to have 
a question answered?


646
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:07,426
Do you think I don't know you,
Alexander?

647
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:13,270
I can look inside your memories,

648
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,574
your nightmares, your dreams.

649
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:23,050
You're a man haunted by
those two most terrible words:

650
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:27,077
What if?

654
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:17,105
Look at you!

655
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:20,300
-Daddy!

656
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:24,903
-Who's that? Is it Daddy?
-Daddy!


657
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:29,440
And we're still having lots of fun.

658
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:33,010
-Right. Right.

660
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:49,128
Da-da! Daddy.

661
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:54,773
You built your time machine
because of Emma's death.

662
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:58,370
If she had lived,
it would never have existed.

663
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:02,247
So how could you use your machine
to go back to save her?

664
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:06,947
You are the inescapable result...

665
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:09,820
of your tragedy,

666
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:12,416
just as I...

667
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:17,830
am the inescapable result...
of you.

670
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,305
You have your answer.
Now go.

672
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:39,138
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

673
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:49,715
-We all have our time machines,don't we?

674
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:55,324
Those that take us back
are memories...

675
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,765
and those that carry us forward...

676
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,905
are dreams.

677
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:13,675
-You're forgetting one thing.
-Huh?

678
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:21,549
-What if?

694
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:53,191
- What are you doing with it?
- Changing the future.

695
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,067
Come on.

698
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:40,676
Wait. Wait here.

704
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,175
Go.

706
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,919
- Hurry!

708
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,765
Huh?

709
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:53,373
Alexander!

711
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:44,197
I'm sorry you lost your machine.

712
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:51,099
Oh, it's all right. It was only a machine.

713
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:16,459
"The congregation rose and stared...

714
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:20,661
'"while the three dead boys
came marching up thea isle..

715
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:23,863
"Tom in their lead, Joe next,

716
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:27,931
"and Huck,a ruin of drooping rags,

717
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:31,342
"sneaking sheepishly in the rear.

718
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:36,748
"They had hid in an unused gallery,
listening to their own funeral sermon.

719
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:40,151
Aunt Polly, Mary and the Harpers
threw themselves upon them--''

720
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:43,315
This is the place.

721
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:46,087
So it is.

722
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:55,629
-But there's nothing here.
-Well, it was different then.

723
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:58,831
My laboratory
was all around here.

724
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:02,865
The kitchen was up there
where that tree is.

725
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:08,113
Not that Mrs. Watchit
ever let me go in there.

726
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:15,779
I don't know what to tell you, sir.

727
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:18,792
He's been gone this whole week.

728
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,954
And you've no idea where he went?

729
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,999
-No, sir.
-This would be my greenhouse.

730
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:28,524
There was a garden outside.

731
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:31,697
Gren 'tormar'tas?

732
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:33,866
Yes.

733
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:37,570
-I'm glad.
-Sir?

734
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:40,307
I'm glad he's gone.

735
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:44,511
Maybe he's finally found someplace
where he can be happy.

736
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,656
-This was my home.
-His home.

737
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:52,158
Long ago.

738
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:58,793
You know, Molly and I were talking
about engaging a housekeeper,

739
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:01,994
someone to live with us
and help take care ofJamie.

740
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,937
Would you be interested?

741
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:11,702
-Perhaps just until the master returns.
-Ofcourse.

742
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,806
But there'd be some changes made.
I run a tight house.


743
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:20,843
Oh, I have no doubt of that. I'll call
by in the morning, and we'll arrange it.

744
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:24,881
-Good night, Mrs. Watchit.
-Good night, Mr. Philby.

745
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:44,801
-Godspeed, my fine lad.

746
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,813
Godspeed.
