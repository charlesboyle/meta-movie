1
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,103
? Hah

2
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,261
? Ooh

3
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:49,255
? Hey

4
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,166
? Hah

5
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:53,088
? Huh

6
00:00:56,153 --> 00:00:57,113
? Uh

7
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:00,919
? Time is truly wastin'

8
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,891
? There's no guarantee, yeah

9
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:08,126
? Smile is in the makin'

10
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:12,597
? We got to fight
the powers that be ?

11
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:17,637
? Got so many voices

12
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:21,339
? Saying all the same, yeah

13
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:25,478
? Killing up all around me

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,714
? Faces full of pain

15
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,716
? I tried to play my music

16
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:32,553
? They say my music's too loud

17
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:34,254
? I tried talking about it

18
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:35,988
? I got the big runaround

19
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,324
? And when I rolled
with the punches ?

20
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:40,526
? I got knocked on the ground

21
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:44,598
? By all this bullshit
going down, hey ?

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,602
? Time is truly wastin'

23
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:51,171
? There's no guarantee, yeah

24
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:55,542
? Smile is in the makin'

25
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:57,845
? We got to fight the powers
that be ?

26
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:02,217
? Yeah
? Fight, fight the powers

27
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,384
? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

28
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:06,253
Okay...

29
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:07,621
Huh?

30
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:09,757
Oh, my God, it means:
"Cover me, go left. "

31
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,926
Read the manual,
why don't you?

32
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,797
Wait for my three count.

33
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,966
And one, two...

34
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,635
Unbelievable.

35
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:21,302
 FBI! Freeze!  FBI!
 Hands on top of your head!

36
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:23,371
Don't move! Get 'em up!
 Okay, calm down, okay, man?

37
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,374
On your head!
 Hey, calm down, tough guy.

38
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,210
Surprise.

39
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:29,845
We've checked everywhere.

40
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,113
There's nothing.

41
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:32,648
Well, place is clean, Ashburn.

42
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,384
Looks like your theory
has a few holes in it.

43
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,651
Let's roll, boys.

44
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,354
So you think it's clean, huh?

45
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,222
Oh, here we go.
 Yeah, that's what they...

46
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:41,590
that's what they said last year

47
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:42,992
right before I arrested
the Red Falls Killer.

48
00:02:42,994 --> 00:02:44,627
What are those?

49
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,529
Barbecue spareribs?

50
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:48,231
Is that what that is?

51
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,733
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

52
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:50,966
Or...

53
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,137
...maybe I'm not.

54
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,840
Yeah. Airtight.

55
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,041
Dipped in wax.

56
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,543
I respect that.

57
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:02,279
I especially like the meat
to distract the dog.

58
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,980
And while that may have fooled

59
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,750
the loudest breather
in the world,

60
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,284
it did not fool me.

61
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:10,287
And, unfortunately,
it's not what I'm looking for.

62
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,189
So why don't we
just cut to the chase?

63
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,623
Are there guns
in this house?

64
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,359
I don't know anything
about any guns.

65
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,528
Interesting.

66
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,363
Maybe I'm wrong. You know?

67
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,698
Mm, wait for it.

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,566
Maybe these guys are...
are right for a change.

69
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,835
Stranger things have
happened, right, guys?

70
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,971
Mm, that's a trap.
Meteors, comets.

71
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,539
Somebody married Pete,
and he can't even

72
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,907
count to three.
 Uhuh.

73
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,841
See? Right there?

74
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,443
So frustrating.

75
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,413
You know,
they loved these houses

76
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,881
during the Prohibition Era.

77
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,516
You guys know what
prohibition is, don't you?

78
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,219
Yeah, selling
your ass for money?

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,322
Really?
 Really?

80
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,957
No. No, it was, uh, alcohol.

81
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,326
People loved to drink it, even
though they weren't supposed to,

82
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,827
and these houses
had all these little

83
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,929
nooks and crannies
where they could hide it.

84
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,631
Like this one.

85
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Is there something behind me?

86
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,035
There is, isn't there?

87
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,537
Fuck.

88
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,205
Now you can roll.

89
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,909
Gentlemen.

90
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,812
Nice work, dick.

91
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,854
Jesus.

92
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:22,295
Let's go. Ooh...

93
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,501
Hard to believe she's single.

94
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:34,174
Oh!

95
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,649
Immediately below that,
you feel a little crease...

96
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:43,817
Wow, that's pretty
impressive, huh?

97
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,919
Do you see that?
Look at that.

98
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:47,921
We'd want to make an incision
right through there.

99
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:49,624
That's pretty amazing, huh?

100
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,458
Pretty amazing.

101
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,660
Pumpkin!

102
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,561
Here, kitty, kitty.

103
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:57,064
Are you at the
neighbor's again?

104
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,366
Pumpkin!

105
00:04:58,368 --> 00:05:00,568
Here, kitty, kitty.

106
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,270
Go on home.

107
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:03,772
I'll see you tomorrow.

108
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:05,807
There you go.

109
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:10,345
Pumpkin, I told you

110
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,213
to stay away from
that weird lady.

111
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,467
Yo, taxi!

112
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:42,545
Mmhmm.

113
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:44,580
<i>No, no, no,
o  lo  lo... lo siento.</i>

114
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,183
<i>No, hay a poder
llegar temprano,</i>

115
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,218
<i>llamar de los vecinos
y diles que...</i>

116
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,187
<i>Lo siento. Perd√≥n.</i>

117
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,587
Oh, boy.

118
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,422
Wife doesn't like you
working late, huh?

119
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:55,292
What do you want?

120
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,526
Oh, just, uh, letting you know

121
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:57,961
that I have been
observing the agents,

122
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,363
overseeing what
they've been up to,

123
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:01,264
you know,
keeping an eye on them.

124
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,733
Yeah. Supervising.

125
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:04,369
Supervising. Yes, sir.

126
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,970
Look, Ashburn...

127
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:08,205
I haven't made
any decisions yet.

128
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:09,639
Oh... of course not.

129
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:11,541
Every...
everyone deserves a shot.

130
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:14,345
I don't know if you are the
right person for this position.

131
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm s... I'm sorry, what?

132
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,781
What? I'm confused.

133
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:18,516
Walk with me.

134
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:19,884
Sir, I don't...
I don't understand.

135
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:21,685
I've closed more cases
than any agent here.

136
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,154
Should I not have
done that?

137
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:24,389
You are a solid agent.

138
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:26,290
There are many other
solid agents.

139
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,859
Well, none of them
have closed

140
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,627
the Red Falls Killer case.

141
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,962
Ashburn, it's no secret

142
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:33,031
that none of the other agents
like you.

143
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,767
What?

144
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,934
I've gotten countless
complaints of arrogance

145
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:38,770
and competitiveness,
showmanship.

146
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,338
Just give it a rest.

147
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,774
All right.

148
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,109
We've got a situation in Boston.

149
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:47,646
The Feds picked up chatter
on a guy moving in.

150
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:48,947
Simon Larkin.

151
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,717
We don't know
what he looks like,

152
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,318
where he comes
from, nothing.

153
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,854
We believe this guy is doing
the legwork for him.

154
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,689
Julian Vincent,
nasty son of a bitch.

155
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:01,127
Murder, extortion.

156
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,595
This is his M.O.

157
00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:04,964
The problem with guys
like that is that

158
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,765
everyone's too scared to talk.

159
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,001
Pack your bags.
I'm sending you to Boston.

160
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,004
You know how to get
inside people's heads.

161
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,106
You want to find Larkin,
get to Julian.

162
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:16,209
You do well with this,
we can talk about the job.

163
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:20,781
? Whoo!

164
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:22,482
? She's got stickers
on her locker ?

165
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,719
? And the boy's number's there
in Magic Marker ?

166
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,723
? I'm hungry
and the hunger will linger ?

167
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:32,460
? I eat 16 saltine crackers

168
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:35,663
? Then I lick my fingers

169
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,898
? Well, every morning
I deliver the news ?

170
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,366
? Black hat, white shoes...

171
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,835
Hey, Rojas sent me over.

172
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,102
He said you were really nice.

173
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:43,838
Yeah, baby,
what are you looking for?

174
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,140
What's your name?
 Champaz. What's yours?

175
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:48,643
Champaz?
Did your mom give you that name?

176
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:50,045
Not exactly.

177
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,745
Hey, Mullins.

178
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:54,281
Captain wants to know
when you're coming in.

179
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,616
Hey, you know what?

180
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,452
Tell him I'll be there
sharply at, uh,

181
00:07:57,454 --> 00:07:58,787
gofuckyourself o'clock.

182
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:00,355
Okay? If there's no traffic.

183
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:01,990
Thank you.

184
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:03,992
That seems kind of expensive.
 Expensive?

185
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:05,928
Can you break a hundred?
I got a hundred right here.

186
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,529
No, baby, I'm not
going to break a hundred.

187
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:08,864
All right, let me see.

188
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,599
I don't think I have that.
Wow.

189
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,100
My God, do you have,
like, a discount?

190
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:13,668
Hey, what's going on here?

191
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,239
Okay, I don't want
any drugs, all right?

192
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,573
Oh.

193
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,475
No. Hi. How you doing?

194
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,511
Are you trying to get a...
a deal on my girl here?

195
00:08:21,513 --> 00:08:23,011
Are you her pimp?

196
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:24,547
No, we're just friends.
Isn't that right?

197
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,516
Okay, well, it's... I think
this is just kind of...

198
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:27,750
between her and I, so let's...

199
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:29,619
Am I kind of invading
your space here?

200
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,153
Kind of.
 I don't want to do that.

201
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:32,889
Let me see if this
will help you.

202
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,092
All right, look,
I... I just wanted to...

203
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:36,260
Oh.

204
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:39,562
Well, it... it's, uh...

205
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:42,431
it's a good thing I didn't
get the drugs from you.

206
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,568
Yeah, can you imagine that?

207
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,271
That would have been...
 That would have been crazy.

208
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,173
That would have been bad.
 That would have been bad.

209
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,375
Yeah, right?

210
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:54,011
Whew!

211
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:57,681
You'd better wipe that brow.

212
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:59,082
Listen, um...
 Thanks.

213
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:00,384
I got to ask,
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,287
you know, whatever...
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

215
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,589
what was... what was
actually going on here?

216
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,257
Oh, we were just, um...

217
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,192
She looked kind of sad,
so I just...

218
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:11,930
I kind of thought I'd help her
out and give her a ride home.

219
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:13,364
That's nice, like
a Good Samaritan.

220
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,066
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Were you depressed?

221
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,334
Was he giving you
a ride home?

222
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,535
Yeah, I was kind of
cheering you up.

223
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,037
Yeah, good for you.

224
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,673
You know who else is pretty
sad? Frank over here.

225
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,174
Right, Frank, you get sad 'cause
you shit and piss yourself?

226
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,909
You having a sad day,
Frank?

227
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:26,411
Hey, maybe you can put him
in the back of your car...

228
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,880
You want to shit and piss
all over this guys car?

229
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:30,516
You know what,
let's open up the...

230
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:32,718
Frank, you want to shit your
pants and get in the...

231
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,086
Oh, good, it's open.

232
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,254
I can put, uh, Frank in there.
 Okay.

233
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,455
He can shit and piss himself...
 Okay.

234
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:37,689
...until he's happy.

235
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:38,856
I got some towels.
I can put some towels...

236
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,526
Does that sounds good?
 Yeah, sure.

237
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,361
Why don't you let me see your I.D. there?
 Oh, come on, please.

238
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,229
Um...  Yeah, hey, let me just
take the whole thing.

239
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:45,931
I don't...  Yeah, it's good.
It's... I got it.

240
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:46,932
Oh, good.

241
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,267
You know what?

242
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:49,936
I got nervous that maybe
you didn't have

243
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,972
a wife and a whole bunch
of kids, but...

244
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,238
but luckily, you do.

245
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,707
What's your wife's name?

246
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,975
Her name is Bella.

247
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,843
Oh, Bella. Good.

248
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,779
Hey, can I borrow
your phone for a minute?

249
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:01,948
My... yeah, my...
my battery's out.

250
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,450
Why do you want
to borrow my phone?

251
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:05,018
Because I asked you
for your phone.

252
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,019
Give me your fucking phone.

253
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,419
Shut your mouth.

254
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,456
Can't you just, like,
g  give me one chance here?

255
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,957
Yeah, I'll give you one chance.

256
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,225
Hello?

257
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:13,493
Yeah, who's this?
Is this Bella?

258
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:15,161
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

259
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:16,396
That's... Don't do that.
Don't do that.

260
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,832
Ow! My God!
 Don't do that.

261
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,166
Yes, this is Officer Mullins.
 God!

262
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,768
I'm here with your husband.

263
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,769
God, what are you, Spock?

264
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:23,269
No.

265
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:25,138
No, he's not been in
an accident, unfortunately.

266
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,742
I just, uh... II do have him
here with a known prostitute.

267
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:29,744
God! She's lying!

268
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:31,012
Bella, she's lying!

269
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,847
Oh, that's not
the first time, huh?

270
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,548
God.
 Yeah, that's him.

271
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,318
He's crying 'cause I'm
breaking his fucking hand.

272
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,985
God.
 Oh, she said do it harder.

273
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:39,086
All right, Bella.

274
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,454
Ow! God!
 That's for Bella.

275
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:43,491
Well, you got to go with
your instincts, Bella.

276
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,394
Yep, you're welcome.

277
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:48,163
Yep, she's probably going to
burn your shit today, so...

278
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,465
Come on, look, you don't
understand, all right?

279
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,566
She just had a baby. There's
a lot going on down there.

280
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,268
I'm not going to touch that.
 Why don't you take your, uh,

281
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,737
seat belt off for a minute?

282
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,005
Oh, come on, please... come on.
 Yeah.

283
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,473
No, you seem like
a reasonable guy.

284
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,308
You look like you got...
Take your fucking belt off.

285
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,643
And you look like
you got some compassion.

286
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,414
Listen, I love... I love
the sound of a guy that,

287
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,183
after his wife gives him
his fifth fucking child,

288
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,117
complains about
her messy vagina.

289
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,486
And then you don't want
to fucking touch her!

290
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:13,589
Get out of the fucking car.
 I can unlock the door for you.

291
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,525
What the fuck, man?
 Get out of the fucking car!

292
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,260
Get out of the fucking car!
 Are you kidding me?

293
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:18,728
Come on!
 Get up against the car.

294
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,196
What is your problem?
You asked for my phone...

295
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:21,698
Turn around.
You want to do that?

296
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,599
Do you want to do that?
 It's hot! The car is hot!

297
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,536
Good! I hope it burns
your fucking dick off!

298
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:32,710
Hey, it's Rojas,
my favorite asshole.

299
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,211
Yeah, look what I found.

300
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:35,979
Oh, no, did I take some
of your business away?

301
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:37,580
That's a real shame.

302
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:39,182
Lady, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

303
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,416
I just stand on this corner,

304
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:42,186
and I just do
my "sodukas," okay?

305
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:44,288
Oh, is that right? First of all,
it's "soduko," dumbass.

306
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,223
And you want to tell me
that you're

307
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:47,624
just here coincidentally,
right in the...

308
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:49,626
right in the middle
of all the prostitutes?

309
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,730
Lady, tell me this...
why are you so obsessed with me?

310
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:53,063
You should be ashamed
of yourself,

311
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:54,498
trying to break down
a successful black man.

312
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,666
You racist?

313
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:58,168
And don't play that race
bullshit card with me!

314
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,805
Nine out of ten guys I fuck
are black guys.

315
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,507
Lady, what I think
you need to do...

316
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,243
you need to go down the road,
take a vacation, okay?

317
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:06,845
And go get your groove back.

318
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,012
Lady, just relax, chill, okay?

319
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,582
What is that?

320
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:16,154
Take off.

321
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:17,288
Yeah, that's what I thought.

322
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,991
I'm not a part of this!

323
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,159
Shut up! Shut up!

324
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:22,894
Stop! Oh! Oh!

325
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,130
Oh, my God!

326
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:28,200
? Yeah, I was right all along
? Yeah

327
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:29,835
Oh, my God!

328
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:31,604
Oh, it's on!

329
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:32,772
She's crazy!

330
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:34,140
? Yeah

331
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:35,674
Come on, please let me out.
I get really carsick.

332
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,110
Please, please, please, please
 Oh, no, that's terrible.

333
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,945
No, come on. Oh, my God!

334
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,850
I got him now.
I got him, I got him.

335
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:47,154
You are a meth head!

336
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,655
Oh, my God!

337
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:50,223
Hey, look who's here.

338
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:51,992
Oh!

339
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,058
You just hit him!

340
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:58,799
? So what you waiting for?

341
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,233
Yeah, you better run.

342
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:01,701
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

343
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:10,710
I got him. I got him!

344
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,813
Oh, God!

345
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:14,949
You piece of shit,
I said stop.

346
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:18,252
I said... I said stop!

347
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:19,921
I said stop!
 Just get off me!

348
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,122
You're crushing my balls!

349
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:22,689
I hope they fucking rupture!

350
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:25,927
Lady, get the fuck off of me!
 You're going to fucking...

351
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,061
What the hell
is wrong with you?

352
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:34,469
Bella, I'm sorry!

353
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:36,538
Let me go!
 Hold still, you piece of shit!

354
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,939
Ow! My leg, lady!

355
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,140
Let me go!

356
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,374
No!
 No!

357
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:42,210
Lady, what the hell
is wrong with you?

358
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,079
I'll tell you what the hell's
the matter with me.

359
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,480
It's you, piece of shit.

360
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:47,082
Son of a bitch.

361
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,051
Stop moving!

362
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:50,652
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

363
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:51,920
Get off me!
 Shit.

364
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,121
Get off me!

365
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:55,958
Shit.

366
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,228
Yeah.

367
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,163
Man, lady, what the hell
did you throw at me?

368
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,999
A watermelon.
 A watermelon?

369
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,100
Ah, hell, no!

370
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:05,835
See, I told you
you was a racist.

371
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:07,870
Yeah? I tried to hit you with
my car. What's that make me?

372
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,239
Yeah, let's see what you
got in... Oh, look at this.

373
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,641
Look at this.
Not even my birthday.

374
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,243
Hey, man, you planted
that shit on me, man!

375
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:14,544
Yeah, I planted it, yeah.

376
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,179
You planted that on me!
I'm innocent!

377
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:17,947
Shut up before I feed you
watermelon. Get up.

378
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:26,422
Levy?

379
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:27,824
Yeah.
 Federal Agent Sarah Ashburn

380
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,261
from the New York field office.
 Hi. How are you?

381
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:31,562
I'm going to need all your files

382
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:33,030
on all known drug dealers
of the area.

383
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:34,598
Right. We heard you were coming.

384
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,533
Actually, I was expecting you.
 Ah.

385
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:37,934
I'll show you to your desk.
 Oh, that won't be necessary.

386
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:39,336
I won't be here long.

387
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,605
Okay. Okay.
 So I can carry these. Thank you.

388
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:42,840
Where is it?

389
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,877
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey! Ashburn!

390
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,045
Ashburn!

391
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,281
Oh! Ooh.
 Oh, God.

392
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,315
You okay?
 What? What is it?

393
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:51,950
What is it?
 Okay.

394
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:54,184
Lowend dealer just brought
into the East Boston precinct.

395
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,320
All right.
 Name's Terrell Rojas.

396
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,357
Oh. Oh, okay.

397
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,792
Good. Thank you very much.

398
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:02,027
Good... good luck out there.

399
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,561
It's not about luck, pal.

400
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:04,896
Not about luck.

401
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:09,267
Wow.

402
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,536
That was almost cool.

403
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,571
Almost.

404
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,084
Come on, come on, come on.

405
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:27,987
Ain't going to
fucking park today?

406
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:29,155
All right.

407
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:31,023
Here we go. Finally.

408
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:36,997
Hey! I'm moving in there!

409
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,497
No, don't...!

410
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,633
Hey, hey, hey!
No, get back in your car.

411
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,935
Hey! Hey!

412
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:44,103
Hey, asshole!

413
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:46,406
Goddamn it.

414
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,444
FBI.

415
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:52,179
Hey, you need to sign in.

416
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,715
Come on. Let's go.

417
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:56,683
Captain Woods?

418
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,486
Captain Woods?

419
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:01,021
Christ.
 I'm sorry?

420
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,323
Uh, how can I help you?

421
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,792
Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.

422
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,694
We got intel recently
that you brought in

423
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:08,662
a dealer by the name
of Terrell Rojas.

424
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:11,098
Uh, yeah, but Detective Mullins
isn't back from lunch yet.

425
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,666
I'm sure he won't mind.

426
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:14,402
Well, he's a she, and we're not

427
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,237
really allowed to go
near her collars.

428
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,373
Let me tell you what I think.

429
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,874
I think that every second
we're standing here

430
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:21,242
is interfering with
the federal investigation.

431
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:22,778
So, if you'd be so kind

432
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,213
as to show Mr. Rojas
to an interrogation room.

433
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,381
Thank you.

434
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:27,982
Special Agent?
 Yes.

435
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,184
This way.
 Okay.

436
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,654
Special Agent?
 Yes.

437
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:37,826
Special Agent?

438
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,909
Shit.

439
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:57,012
You are looking at
possession with intent,

440
00:16:57,014 --> 00:17:01,885
which is a class D drug charge,
chapter 94C, section 32A.

441
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,287
I had a joint and a few
little bags of coke.

442
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,588
Since when is that shit illegal?

443
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,323
The answer to your question
is always.

444
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:08,924
And with your priors,

445
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:13,430
you are looking at 25 years
and some pretty stiff fines.

446
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,031
Who the hell cares about fines?

447
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,166
That's 25 years!

448
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,434
Never mind.

449
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,437
Let's see what
you make of these.

450
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,971
Huh? What do you
make of these?

451
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,307
What I make of them is
that somebody doesn't want

452
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,408
somebody else selling
on their turf.

453
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,810
But you're still here.

454
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,280
And you're alive.
Why is that?

455
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,815
Who you working for?
 Nobody.

456
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,616
Who you working for?
Who you working for?  Nobody.

457
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,452
Nobody! If I tell you,
that's my ass

458
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,620
chopped up into a million
motherfucking pieces!

459
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,790
Goddamn it.

460
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
Fucker.

461
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,662
God.

462
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,030
Push!

463
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,300
This motherfucker!

464
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,102
Everybody's got to fucking park
in my spot.

465
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,303
Goddamn it!

466
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:52,771
Shit!

467
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:54,305
Suitwearing, god...

468
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,806
Ow! Fuck!

469
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,942
God.

470
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,644
Yeah, I said I'm...

471
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,079
fucking parking there.

472
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,382
That doesn't...
Steal my goddamn fucking space.

473
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,989
I don't want you to do time.

474
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:14,359
I don't want you to get
chopped up into little, tiny,

475
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,162
mothereffin' pieces.

476
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:17,330
Oh.

477
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:18,698
I can protect you.

478
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,665
I can.

479
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:20,900
But you got,
you got to help me.

480
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:22,101
I can help you.

481
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,102
You're gonna help me?
 Yeah.

482
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,171
Tell me where I can find Julian.

483
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:26,806
I don't deal with him like that.

484
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:29,509
I get my stuff from this bitch
named Tatiana on Newkirk Avenue.

485
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,377
Can you describe her to me?

486
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,146
Well, she got brown eyes.
 Okay.

487
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:37,551
Mm, she got some
bigass "breastses. "

488
00:18:37,553 --> 00:18:39,485
Big breastses.
 Okay.

489
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,855
Can you maybe be a
little bit more specific?

490
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:46,260
Uh... like...

491
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:50,130
her breastses is like this.

492
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:51,798
Okay. Thank you.

493
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,039
That's a shame.

494
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:06,147
Don't.

495
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:07,682
Oh, haha, oh, yeah!

496
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:09,283
We're at a comedy party, yeah.

497
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:10,884
Move the fuck
out of my way.

498
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,020
Get a room.

499
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:14,289
Tim, you still owe me 40.

500
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,124
Yeah, tomorrow it's 60.

501
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:17,992
Fucking dickweed.

502
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:19,160
Why is the cage empty?

503
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:21,664
What have I told you
about moving my prisoners?

504
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,365
He's in interrogation.

505
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:26,801
Why would he be in interrogation
when I'm standing right here?

506
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:28,403
Theythey came and got him.

507
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:29,571
Who's "they"?

508
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:31,507
Better be two of me.
Is it two of me?

509
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,775
It was a lady. She was...

510
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:34,476
I'm a lady.
Did I come and get him?

511
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:36,612
No, no, it was a different lady;
she was nice.

512
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:37,980
I'm fuckin' nice.
 No, no.

513
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:39,180
Why was she nice to you?

514
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,549
She made me give her the keys.

515
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,751
I'm gonna make you
fucking bend over,

516
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:45,621
and I'm gonna reach up your ass
into your pocket and get

517
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:46,822
the keys to your house.

518
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:48,424
And then I'm gonna
drive there,

519
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:50,994
come in your front fucking door
and kill you in your sleep.

520
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,496
I think I have a clear idea
of what we're looking for,

521
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:54,997
and I appreciate
your time.

522
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,899
Wow, lady, you're on
a real fuckin' roll.

523
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:57,866
Excuse me? I...

524
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,236
Yeah, no, I won't excuse you.

525
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:00,604
I just spent the last 30 minutes

526
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,938
thinking of different ways
to kill you.

527
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,773
I... I'm... I'm sorry,
when did we meet?

528
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:05,508
What is this, your lawyer?

529
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,810
I'm...  What are you,
insurance salesman?

530
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,246
Do you sell those shitty suits?

531
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,579
I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.

532
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:10,947
How can I help you?

533
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,749
You can get all of that,
get it up,

534
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,151
and get it the fuck out of here,
'cause this is my room.

535
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:17,421
Were you, were you about to be,
uh, questioned by a detective?

536
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:18,789
I am a detective,

537
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,125
and that's my perp.
 Ah.

538
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:23,027
Ah, I... I understand now.

539
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,327
Well, um, Detective,

540
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:27,031
Mr. Rojas will be continuing on
with me at this point.

541
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:27,932
No.

542
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,667
It's a jurisdictional issue.

543
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:31,235
No, not gonna happen.
 And so, uh, youryour efforts

544
00:20:31,237 --> 00:20:33,537
areare duly noted. Thank
you so much.  Oh, great.

545
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,072
And if you're okay
with everything,

546
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:36,275
could you justjust
maybe close the door

547
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,309
on the way out?

548
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:38,844
I'll shut the door on you.

549
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,745
Will you lay down here
and put your head in the door?

550
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,547
And I'll slam it about
157,000 fucking times.

551
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:44,649
Aw, shit, girl, you better run.

552
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:45,651
You need to shut your mouth.

553
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:46,652
Run like you on fire.

554
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:47,653
You need to be quiet.

555
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:48,920
You're gonna get up,

556
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:50,555
and we're gonna
settle this outside.

557
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:52,190
Okay, now I'm...
I won't be going outside.

558
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,760
You're gonna get up and
you're gonna come outside.

559
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:55,861
No, ma'am. Not going outside.

560
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,162
Fine. We'll do this inside.

561
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:59,131
Can somebody please
remove this person

562
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,133
from the interrogation room?
 We're good!

563
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,834
Mental illness is
nothing to be ashamed of.

564
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:04,037
It runs in many families.

565
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,204
I'm gonna hit you.

566
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:06,873
You're not gonna hit me.
Please don't.

567
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,907
I'm gonna hit you and knock
all your little buttons.

568
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:08,908
Do not point your finger...

569
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,375
I'm gonna hit you there...

570
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:11,677
No, do not put your
finger in my...

571
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,678
Stop touching my buttons,
stop touching...

572
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,280
Well, stop wearing buttons.

573
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,716
Don't you...  Don't you move
those fucking hands again.

574
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,351
I'll get that stupid barrette.
H  Hey, hey!

575
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:20,553
I'll take that barrette
right out of your fucking hair!

576
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,388
Hey, stop!
Oh, stop, stop, stop!

577
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,491
Hey, both of you, my office now.

578
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,627
Nope. Not in there.

579
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:29,228
There is nothing
I can do, Mullins.

580
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,230
The FBI has jurisdiction.

581
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:33,267
Maybe they're in here. Maybe
they're in here.  Aw, come on.

582
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:34,601
Nope.
 Stop. Will you stop?

583
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:36,070
Nope, they're not in
there. Let me see.

584
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:37,905
What is she doing?
 They're not under there.

585
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:40,306
She's looking for my balls.

586
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:41,709
Oh.

587
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:43,077
Hey, if anyone sees
the captain's balls,

588
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,244
let me know!

589
00:21:44,246 --> 00:21:47,114
They're about this big,
but a lot tinier.

590
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:50,517
They're like a pea,
or like a, like a ball bearing,

591
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,787
or like, if you've ever
seen a mouse ball,

592
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,154
about half that size.

593
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:55,689
Incredibly tiny.

594
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,759
They're like really, really
tiny, little girl balls,

595
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:00,195
if little girls had balls.

596
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,964
So if you find
little, tiny, girl balls

597
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:06,868
that are so fucking tiny
and shriveled up, let me know,

598
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,471
'cause I'll put them
right back up his scrotum!

599
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:10,872
Knock it off, Mullins.

600
00:22:10,874 --> 00:22:12,440
How about you
do something for once?

601
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,008
What do you want me to do?!

602
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,578
Uh, I'd like you to have my back
and stop being so goddamn

603
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,579
disappointing like
everybody else.

604
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:19,482
Oh, well, that was professional.

605
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,384
Oh, is that not professional?
Here.

606
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:22,551
Let me, let me be professional.

607
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:23,886
Let me help you
pick up your bag.

608
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,253
That's very mature.

609
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:28,991
Let me just
straighten that shit up.

610
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:30,693
Oh, wait, hey, hey!

611
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:31,861
Good news! Good news!

612
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:33,295
I found his balls!

613
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:34,764
Yeah, in a clear sack!

614
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:35,931
Yeah, enjoy that.

615
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,268
Shove those
back up there.

616
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,069
Cop of the Year!

617
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,371
Keep it up!

618
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:44,407
This job is destroying me.

619
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,277
You know how old I am?

620
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,846
Uh, uh, 58?

621
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:52,282
I'm 43 years old.

622
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,583
Mmhmm, mmhmm.

623
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:55,317
Well, I always,
see, I always round up.

624
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,121
I have a fiveyearold son
who calls me Grandpa.

625
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:02,025
So, uh, anywho,
uh, sir, if, um...

626
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:07,532
if you could just, you know,
keep her away from me,

627
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:10,534
that would be...
be very helpful.

628
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:12,002
She stole your keys, didn't she?

629
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,204
Yes, she did. Do you know
where I can find her?

630
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,740
She's probably at O'Flanagan's.

631
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:16,941
It's a bar down the street.

632
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:18,109
Now, it's a little divey.

633
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,944
You might want to wear a vest.

634
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:25,149
? Okay, I'm Rambo, I ramshack

635
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:26,717
? I'm next to that cheese
like rat traps ?

636
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:28,186
? On top of that green
like grass ass ?

637
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:29,987
? That's over y'all head
like snapbacks ?

638
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:31,889
? I get it where I fit in,
put up then I put in ?

639
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,224
? Tryin' to find an ass I can
put my fucking foot in ?

640
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:35,127
? Run this shit,
no, I run this shit ?

641
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:36,929
? Don't give one fuck,
bitch, I done this shit... ?

642
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:38,564
Sir, is this...
is this place open?

643
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:39,831
Is there a door...?

644
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,666
Oh, wow. Wow,
okay, so there is.

645
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:43,268
Could you, um, could you
point it out to me?

646
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,538
With... with your fin...
with your finger. Please.

647
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,807
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

648
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:54,947
? Here I come again, now, baby

649
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:57,316
? Like a dog in heat...

650
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:59,351
Hand them over.

651
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:02,188
Give me the keys. Now.

652
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,989
Oh, my God.

653
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,325
Did you drop something?

654
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,594
Apologize. Apologies.

655
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:09,528
You are so concerned about

656
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,965
taking down a guy like Rojas
when we have just wasted

657
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,267
all this time, when I could
have stopped a drug lord

658
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,704
who is far more dangerous and
supplies to people like Rojas.

659
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,872
Bullshit.
 Oh, really?

660
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,106
Who?
 Oh.

661
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,276
Okay, you want to
see some bull feces?

662
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:23,944
I think I said bullshit,
is what I said.

663
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:25,445
Here you go. Here's
some bull poopoo.

664
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:28,081
How's this for bull feces?
How does that look? Huh?

665
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:28,948
See that?

666
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,284
Oh, come on.
I got a kid here.

667
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:31,752
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

668
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm, I'm very
sorry, very sorry.

669
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,189
Wait a minute,
this is a bar.

670
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,257
This is a b...

671
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:37,291
No, absolutely not.

672
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:38,759
Nononononono.
Nonononono.

673
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:40,661
Why do I not know
who Simon Larkin is?

674
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:41,862
Uh, that would
probably be because

675
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:43,297
the FBI knows
more than you do.

676
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,932
Uh, anything that's happening
in my neighborhood,

677
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:46,166
I have a right to know.

678
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,768
Uh, no, you actually don't.

679
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,271
You want to know.

680
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:51,540
And you do not have the
clearance that would allow you

681
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:54,242
to read everything
that is on this file, okay?

682
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,109
Okay, all right!

683
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:56,710
You know,
when bad shit happens

684
00:24:56,712 --> 00:25:00,649
in my neighborhood, I get
a little passionate about it.

685
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:02,517
I shouldn't have
read your files.

686
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,985
I went too far.

687
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:06,388
Well, I... I accept
your apology.

688
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,924
But you need to understand

689
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,091
that this is a highly
important case

690
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,794
and the information is
highly, highly sensitive.

691
00:25:12,796 --> 00:25:14,529
Therefore, we have these
clearances that mean...

692
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:15,931
I don't have the clearances.

693
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,133
I don't have the
clearances, right?

694
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:20,836
I mean, you're...
you are, wow, FBI.

695
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:22,071
Yes.
 I mean, you are...

696
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:24,106
you're a goddamn
angel of the law.

697
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:26,207
Well, I... that's a little...

698
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,744
You know, I want you to spread
those wings out and just soar.

699
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:29,745
While I appreciate
the sentiment...

700
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:31,547
Hey!

701
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:32,715
...it's certainly not...

702
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:34,350
Watch it.

703
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,518
You watch it.

704
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,687
I'm a federal agent.

705
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:37,821
Oh, yeah?
 Yeah.

706
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,456
Well, guess what, you dick.

707
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,424
I'm a federal agent, too.

708
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:43,426
I work at the post office.

709
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:45,195
Well, I... I appreciate

710
00:25:45,197 --> 00:25:47,531
the work you do for us
down on the ground.

711
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:48,665
Thank you. Thank you.

712
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,100
Bet your ass you do.

713
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:51,868
I can see no one will be
getting their mail today.

714
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,036
Wow.

715
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:54,204
Good burn. Good burn.

716
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:56,974
You got burned,
you big drunk paddy!

717
00:25:56,976 --> 00:25:58,542
Kiss my cunt, you twat!

718
00:25:58,544 --> 00:25:59,710
Yeah.
 So we are...

719
00:25:59,712 --> 00:26:01,445
Hey.
 We are good?

720
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:03,425
 Thank you.
 Thank you.

721
00:26:03,783 --> 00:26:05,183
Hey, America thanks you.

722
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:06,417
And I, it.

723
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,719
And it, you.

724
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:09,387
Thank you.

725
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:10,854
Whoaoa.

726
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:13,191
Yes, okay.

727
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:14,325
Good day.

728
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:18,162
Dumbass.

729
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:20,932
All prisoners, clear the yards.

730
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:22,801
<i>So how you been, Jason?</i>

731
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:24,869
You want to talk about
Simon Larkin?

732
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:27,505
Uh, I never heard of him.

733
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:29,040
Don't fucking lie to me.

734
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:31,509
You're my goddamn brother;
I know when you're lying.

735
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:33,612
I'm just a lowlevel guy.

736
00:26:33,614 --> 00:26:36,448
Okay? I heard of Larkin, but,
you know, I never met him.

737
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,017
Yeah, well,
he's a goddamn animal,

738
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:39,984
and I'm trying to keep him
from meeting you.

739
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:41,787
What, are you gonna
storm through Boston

740
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:43,322
and take down a drug lord?

741
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:45,391
Yeah, I might.

742
00:26:45,393 --> 00:26:46,892
Have you met me?

743
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:48,494
Yeah, unfortunately.

744
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:50,764
Yeah, shut up.

745
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,832
Look, I get out
tomorrow, okay?

746
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,000
I... I'm coming home.

747
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:55,167
I'm gonna be fine.

748
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:57,236
I promise, all right?

749
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:15,155
Oh! Jesus!

750
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:16,589
Never approach me
if I'm not expecting you!

751
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,625
Cheese and rice, what
are you, an animal?!

752
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:20,094
Okay, you know what?

753
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,362
You said you would
stay off my case,

754
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:22,997
and where do I find you?
Right here.

755
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,565
Right here in front of
Tatiana's apartment.

756
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,799
What? I live here.

757
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,167
Oh, okay, that's hilarious.

758
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:28,602
Yeah, okay,
you know what's not funny?

759
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:31,105
That you stole
a confidential FBI case file.

760
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,140
Oh, that's funny,
I don't remember any of that.

761
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:35,176
I'm gonna say this
one more time.

762
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:36,577
Stand down, Officer.

763
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:37,746
Fuck off, Officer.

764
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:39,381
Oh, okay, guess what?

765
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:41,182
Now you've really done it.
I'm gonna call my boss.

766
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,684
Yeah, you do that,
tattle tits!

767
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:45,019
Fucking narc!

768
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:47,823
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

769
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:52,494
Hale.

770
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,562
It's Ashburn, sir.

771
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:55,396
I'm gonna need authorization

772
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:58,366
to suspend a police officer
from my investigation, sir.

773
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:01,236
Ashburn, why is working
with local authorities

774
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:03,105
a problem for you?
 Sir, it's not.

775
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:05,942
I understand how this might
sound coming from me,

776
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:07,944
but I... I think this individual

777
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:10,012
might actually be
mentally unstable.

778
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:11,213
According to her captain,

779
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:12,514
she grew up on those streets

780
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,082
and she knows them
better than anyone.

781
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,718
That seems like an asset
to our investigation.

782
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,919
Nonono.
 Sir, I...

783
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,387
Just work with her.

784
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:21,057
Just show me you can do this
or forget the promotion.

785
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:27,196
Well, sir, no need, no need
to take someone's badge.

786
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:28,564
I think I can, uh...

787
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,967
I think I can work
something out, sir.

788
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,969
All right.
Thank you.

789
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:34,671
Byebye.

790
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:37,107
You know, uh...

791
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:39,877
I just, I think just...
I think you and I

792
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:41,277
got off on the wrong foot.

793
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,413
Oh.
 I don't know Boston,

794
00:28:43,415 --> 00:28:45,449
and you obviously have
a  a lot of resources

795
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:48,051
and a lot of knowledge about
the area thatthat could be,

796
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:49,686
you know, could be useful.

797
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:51,522
Probably very.

798
00:28:51,524 --> 00:28:53,358
So, uh, maybe we can
work together on this.

799
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,160
Yeah, I don't need your help
to take down Larkin.

800
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:58,028
You know, you wouldn't even
have known about Larkin

801
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,997
if it wasn't for me,
so obviously the FBI can

802
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:01,198
get information
that you can't, okay?

803
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,001
And there's a lot more

804
00:29:03,003 --> 00:29:04,536
where that comes from... a lot.

805
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:06,271
Maybe I just need
to hear a little

806
00:29:06,273 --> 00:29:07,872
"I need your help, Mullins. "

807
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:09,307
No, I won't be doing that.

808
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:11,175
Okay, well, get your ass
back in your car.

809
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:12,243
Okay, this is ridiculous, okay?

810
00:29:12,245 --> 00:29:13,578
I'm an FBI agent,

811
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,313
you're a police officer.
It's not...

812
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:16,915
"I need your help,
Mullins. "

813
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:18,550
I need your help, Mullins.

814
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:21,153
Oh, God, what is...
is this a whisper party?

815
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:23,989
I want that third floor
to hear it.

816
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:25,490
"I need your help, Mullins. "

817
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:28,359
And then maybe give me
a little echo on that "Mullins. "

818
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:34,633
I need your help, Mullins!

819
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:36,101
Mullins, Mullins...

820
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:38,938
Just move, move, move!

821
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,207
God.

822
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,807
Even in that,
you're annoying.

823
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:43,475
I will work with you,

824
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:46,078
as long as we're clear
that this is my case.

825
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,813
That's actually not correct.

826
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,950
This isn't your...  Awesome.
Glad you see it my way.

827
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,686
Careful of the car.

828
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:53,920
Goddamn it.

829
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,760
Stand down.
 I got it.

830
00:30:00,762 --> 00:30:02,596
If you just, if you just let go.
 I got it.

831
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:04,197
I think I have it, just...
 I got it.

832
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,665
Just let me...

833
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:08,102
I got it.
 Geez.

834
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:10,271
Oh, shit.

835
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:21,916
Ma'am, you, uh...

836
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:24,352
Just go. Just go.

837
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:26,152
Okay, now let me
take the lead on this.

838
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:28,022
I'm a trained interviewer.
 "Interviewer"?

839
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:29,257
What are you,
fucking Barbara Walters?

840
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:30,424
I just thought we were
gonna go in there

841
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:31,959
and bring in some heat on her.

842
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,294
I'm sorry, w  what is...
what does that even mean?

843
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:34,295
What does that mean?

844
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:35,664
Me and you, we're the heat.

845
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,032
We go in there,
we interrogate her,

846
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:38,267
we scare the shit
out of her...

847
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,601
See, we don't say
"interrogation. "

848
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,269
It's, it's much
too aggressive.

849
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:43,304
Rule number one: catch more
with sugar than a stick.

850
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:44,939
That's a horrible
fucking saying.

851
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:46,975
Okay, well, what we like to
do isis create aa genuine

852
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:48,577
personal interest
in the subject,

853
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:50,545
allowing them to open up.
But from then, I'm going to...

854
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:52,547
Oh, God.  ... uh, perform instant
personality assessments

855
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:54,417
based on the
MyersBriggs theory, uh,

856
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,051
Thematic Apperception
Tests, and a few...

857
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:57,786
well, a few others I won't,
I won't bore you with.

858
00:30:57,788 --> 00:31:00,389
Oh, my God, well, that's...
I am balls deep in boredom.

859
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,224
All right,
as long as you don't do

860
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:03,692
that whole goddamn
long explanation again,

861
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:05,328
we'll try it your way first.
 Okay.

862
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,763
Only 'cause you're older.

863
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,298
Oh, my God.

864
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:15,405
Tatiana Krumova.

865
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,173
I'm Special Agent
Sarah Ashburn,

866
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,441
and this is Detective Mullins.

867
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,343
Detective Mullins.
 Detective Mullins.

868
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,412
And we'd like to ask
you a few questions,

869
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,547
if you could give us a moment.

870
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,815
Oh, shoot, you know, now is bad.

871
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,684
Oh.
 I'm making butter.

872
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:28,484
Oh. Oh, that's...

873
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,919
How about other time?

874
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,421
Well, if you could...
 How about right fucking now?

875
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,790
How's that? How's that?

876
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:34,391
Right fucking now.

877
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,626
Well, Tatiana, thank you.

878
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:37,628
This is,
this is very kind of you.

879
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,929
So...

880
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,030
how long have you lived here?

881
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,100
I've lived here
since I moved in.

882
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,401
Shit.

883
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,404
Okay, that's very,
very helpful.

884
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,106
Okay, we'll get a
little more specific.

885
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,207
Uh, what do you do

886
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,509
for a living?

887
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:53,478
I know what this asshole
does for a living.

888
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,879
What you know, asshole?

889
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,146
Okay, sugar, no stick.

890
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,082
It is Bulgarian, is it not?

891
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,817
No, I'm fucking French.

892
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:00,986
Oh, Jesus.

893
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,120
Tatiana...

894
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,324
I don't understand
what you're saying.

895
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:07,659
Nice bullshit Bulgarian.

896
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,562
Okay, you know what?
That was perfect Bulgarian.

897
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:11,529
I mean, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

898
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:13,965
Why I go to jail
when I don't do shits?

899
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,533
Ah, okay.

900
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,402
So she did understand
what I was saying,

901
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,804
she just didn't understand
the context

902
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,573
in which I said it to her.
 Oh, sweet God.

903
00:32:20,575 --> 00:32:23,209
Okay, okay, all right,
Rosetta Stone, you're done.

904
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:24,777
God.

905
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,910
Oh, Jesus.

906
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:28,180
How many porns have been
made on this couch?

907
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:29,949
Oh, this couch
not of your satisfaction?

908
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:31,417
You're not comfy?

909
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:32,818
I'll get comfy.
When my foot's up your ass.

910
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,153
Wow.

911
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:35,421
That'll make me really comfy.
 Stop.

912
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:36,655
Don't poke me.
Don't poke me.

913
00:32:36,657 --> 00:32:39,059
Listen, Tatiana,
I want to get really real.

914
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,327
You ready to get
real, Tatiana?

915
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:41,594
Let's get real.

916
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:43,229
Okay, we both
know you've been

917
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:44,397
blowing shit
up your nose all day.

918
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,798
Man, I get it.

919
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,567
There's nothing more
I'd love to do than

920
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:50,804
slip into my camisole, put
my feet up, have a little smack.

921
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:52,606
Real good time,
maybe a couple cold ones,

922
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:54,241
a little chip and dip,
watch some cartoons.

923
00:32:54,243 --> 00:32:55,742
I'd get a big bowl

924
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:58,578
of fucking coke, I'd just
put my face right in it,

925
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,180
cut it with a little Ritalin.

926
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:01,448
Heaven on fucking earth, right?

927
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,416
Sure.
 I'd camp out all week

928
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:03,817
for tickets to that show.

929
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,419
<i>WhWhatwhat is this,
Training Day?</i>

930
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:08,089
All fucking week,
I'd camp out for that.

931
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,624
But you, you piece of shit,

932
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:11,458
you've been rolling
deep for a long time,

933
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,127
and now it's time
you open up that goddamn mouth

934
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:15,830
and tell us what
we want to know.

935
00:33:15,832 --> 00:33:17,865
You got good point.
I tell you what.

936
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,467
I open my mouth.

937
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:21,569
You get the fuck
out my house now!

938
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:23,104
How's that
for open mouth?

939
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:25,107
Fuck out!
Get fuck out!

940
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,908
Yeah. I'll get
the fuck out.

941
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,342
All right.

942
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:30,545
You should really stop smoking,
'cause, uh...

943
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:31,946
it's an awfully bad habit.

944
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:34,216
You're leaving half your
lipstick in the ashtray.

945
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:36,652
I had a, uh,
great aunt that lost

946
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:38,587
most of her teeth
to, uh, smoking.

947
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,355
Good to know.
 A lot of fistfights, too,

948
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,722
but, uh, mostly smoking.

949
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:42,690
You know what?

950
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:43,892
We're gonna get
out of your hair.

951
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:44,726
So we're just gonna...

952
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:45,928
What? That is not front door.

953
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,597
Put your hands where I
can fucking see them!

954
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,065
Don't fucking move.

955
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:51,533
What is this,
your drug mule?!

956
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:53,002
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my goodness.
 That's my mother!

957
00:33:53,004 --> 00:33:55,138
Huh? Do you have balloons
of horse up your ass?!

958
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,905
You break my fucking door!
 Stand down, Officer.

959
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:57,873
Stand down, Officer.

960
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,374
Who closes the door
to take a shit?!

961
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:00,542
Get out!
 Humans do.

962
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:02,412
Get out now.
 You get out.

963
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:03,746
D  Don't touch underpants!
 Thank you.

964
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:05,215
Get out, bull in china shop!

965
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,382
Out of my house!

966
00:34:06,384 --> 00:34:07,917
What the fuck's wrong with you?!

967
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,620
Wow, you are just
all stick and no sugar.

968
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:12,922
Did you get
the cigarette or not?

969
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:17,393
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah,
ofofof course I did.

970
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:18,695
Yeah.

971
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,998
I snagged these matches, too.

972
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,967
I think our guy likes
to go to Club Ekko.

973
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,135
Okay, hold on.

974
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:25,302
Come on.
 Really?

975
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:26,469
Yes, yes, really.

976
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,004
Let's find out, shall we?

977
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:29,372
All right, hang on.

978
00:34:29,374 --> 00:34:32,443
That couch was disgusting;
I need to wash my hands.

979
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,212
Wait a minute,
you do, you do live here?

980
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,715
That's what I said.

981
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:39,684
Oh.

982
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:45,356
Wow, your windows are all...
all boarded up.

983
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:47,224
Yeah, I've got the glass,

984
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:49,828
I just don't have the, you know,
the window blankets.

985
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,264
The curtains?
You mean, you mean the curtains?

986
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:54,699
Whatever. Okay?

987
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:58,203
That's just my family.

988
00:34:58,205 --> 00:34:59,371
That's...

989
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,540
Oh.

990
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:03,441
Yeah, it's sweet.

991
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:05,143
You want something to eat?

992
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,945
I didn't finish my submarine
sandwich from the other day.

993
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:09,248
Oh, God, no, thank you.
Thank you.

994
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,950
Well, I'm sorry I don't have
poached eggs in rubies for you.

995
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:14,986
No, I... I don't,
I don't mean to be rude,

996
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,858
but one could catch aa MRSA
infection in here, that's all.

997
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,793
Yeah, what part of that
wasn't rude?

998
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:22,228
Just for your,
for your own wellbeing.

999
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,629
I mean, for example, that door.

1000
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:25,565
That door has absolutely
no way of locking.

1001
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:26,933
Someone could barge in
at any moment.

1002
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:28,034
It's not safe.

1003
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:29,502
No one's coming in here,

1004
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:33,039
'cause they know I keep this
fully stocked.

1005
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,307
Oh, my God.

1006
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:35,308
Yeah, I know.

1007
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,144
A Marlin 1894 CB?

1008
00:35:37,146 --> 00:35:38,312
Yeah.

1009
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:40,113
Is that a FNPS 90?

1010
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:41,248
Yeah. Nice one.

1011
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,548
You have all this
in your house?

1012
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,317
Yeah. You didn't even
mention my baby.

1013
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:45,452
Look at this.

1014
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:46,987
Oh, oh. Wow, wow.

1015
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:48,422
My little pride and joy.

1016
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:51,291
Okay.

1017
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:54,495
This little beauty could
vaporize an aboveground pool,

1018
00:35:54,497 --> 00:35:56,264
if you didn't want the
pool anymore, you know?

1019
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,898
No kidding.
 Pretty, huh?

1020
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,534
Yeah, how do you, how do you
refuse that sales pitch, huh?

1021
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:03,270
You don't,
unless you're an asshole.

1022
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:05,673
Wow.

1023
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:07,942
Haven't seen one of these
since, what, World War II?

1024
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:09,677
No, God, that's...
occasionally ticks.

1025
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,045
Put it back slowly.

1026
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,212
Okay, okay.
 Slowly!

1027
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,348
I'm sorry.

1028
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,515
Like, half that speed.

1029
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:15,917
That's... God, okay.

1030
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,152
Half that speed.

1031
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:20,288
Stop sha...
Put your pinky down.

1032
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,823
I got it on eBay.

1033
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:23,158
It was supposed to be
bigger and different.

1034
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,493
It doesn't matter.

1035
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:27,262
I'm gonna "bad feedback"
his ass though.

1036
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:44,747
All right, ladies.
Here's the DNA results

1037
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:46,782
from the book of matches
and the cigarette butt

1038
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,250
you got from Tatiana's.

1039
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:49,818
We pulled two sets of prints.

1040
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,755
First one's a real nut job.

1041
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:53,323
Look at this:
Reckless driving,

1042
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,557
assault, arson.

1043
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:57,660
Oh, God.
 Really?

1044
00:36:57,662 --> 00:36:58,861
Who the fuck is this guy?

1045
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:00,330
He's my assistant.
What...

1046
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:01,464
Uh, you know
I'm an agent, right?

1047
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,600
Arson?
 It was a drug house.

1048
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:05,235
God, I... I really feel the need

1049
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:06,903
to finish reading your files,
because this is just, um...

1050
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,805
I feel the need for you
to stay out of my business

1051
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,574
so I don't punch you in the teeth.
 Okay. Okay. Okay.

1052
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,275
All right, what did you find
out about the cigarette?

1053
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:14,210
Okay. Hank LeSoire.

1054
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:15,578
Local businessman.

1055
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,714
Got tons of ties to
the drug world, black market,

1056
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:18,849
as well as prostitution rings.

1057
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:20,251
Coowner of Club Ekko.

1058
00:37:20,253 --> 00:37:22,086
Well, it looks like we
found our distributor.

1059
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:23,921
Can you, can you
back that up, please?

1060
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:25,389
Back up to which one?
 That.

1061
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:26,923
Hey! I'm not into you.

1062
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:28,759
Your breast is invading
my space. It's just...

1063
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:30,561
Well, keep your finger
out of my areola.

1064
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:32,730
Well, contain your areola.

1065
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:34,131
There. Now we're even.

1066
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,701
Well, he looks like
a real Chatty Cathy.

1067
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:37,803
Did you tap the phone?

1068
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:39,237
I haven't been able to.

1069
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,039
Guy gets a new prepaid
every other week.  Yeah.

1070
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,373
By the time I can
get his phone number

1071
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,908
and hack in,
he's got a new one.

1072
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,810
Well, let's get a bug into
the phone this guy does have.

1073
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:47,045
I want to know
what he's saying this week.

1074
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:48,480
Yeah, just get
a court order and a bug,

1075
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:49,748
and we'll just do it ourselves.
 Right.

1076
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,949
If you're gonna
boss me around,

1077
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:52,317
you can at least
buy me dinner first.

1078
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:53,919
No.
 Okay. Cool.

1079
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,954
I'll get that to you ASAP.

1080
00:37:55,956 --> 00:37:57,723
You gotta work on
your game.

1081
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:59,024
That was weak.

1082
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,026
What? I thought I
was being charming.

1083
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,794
I don't know
what to say to that.

1084
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:04,763
Now I just feel bad for you.

1085
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,134
Okay, so LeSoire
coowns Club Ekko.

1086
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:09,869
Let's get over there
and start surveilling it

1087
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,870
and figure out how to get
a bug in his phone.

1088
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,171
Tell me everything
you know about it.

1089
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:15,108
It's just a shitty
club downtown.

1090
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,110
I've never been inside of it,
but there's always a line

1091
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:19,078
of awful people
around the corner,

1092
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,280
and they've called PD a couple
of times to break up fights...

1093
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:22,281
Oh, shit.

1094
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:23,883
What's wrong?

1095
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,419
Justjust don't look,
don't look... don't look!

1096
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:27,487
Just act like we're talking.
 Hey, Shannon.

1097
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:28,821
Hey, Robin.

1098
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:30,623
I really enjoyed our
night together, Shannon.

1099
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:31,791
You just disappeared on me.

1100
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:33,493
Yeah, I know.
I was there.

1101
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:35,829
Well, can I take you to dinner
or a movie or something?

1102
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:37,698
God, buddy, do you not
hear how pathetic

1103
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,099
everything out of
your mouth sounds?

1104
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:40,667
I mean, there's a girl
out there for you,

1105
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:42,301
but it's not, it's not me.

1106
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:43,737
Maybe it's her.

1107
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,572
Her lady business is
like an old dirty attic.

1108
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,907
It's full of broken Christmas lights

1109
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,275
and, like, doll shoes and shit.

1110
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:50,310
Why don't you
clean that out for her.

1111
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:52,680
Uh, that's a,

1112
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:55,083
that's a misrepresentation
of my vagina.

1113
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,518
Oh, wow, what
was that about?

1114
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,019
You sleep with a guy
one time,

1115
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:00,454
and he wants to get
married to you.

1116
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:01,622
Jesus Christ.

1117
00:39:01,624 --> 00:39:03,224
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

1118
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:06,461
? More than a feeling

1119
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:07,762
? More than a feeling ?

1120
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,831
? When I hear that old song...

1121
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:11,500
Who is, who is that?

1122
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:12,934
My mom.

1123
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,671
Ortiz settles into
the batter's box.

1124
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:18,940
Verlander with the pitch
and a ground ball

1125
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,343
right side through the legs
of Cabrera into right field.

1126
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:23,946
Pedroia is headed
for second base.

1127
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:25,414
He slides and he is...

1128
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:27,849
How about I tell you
a little something about myself?

1129
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:29,150
Oh, God.
 Let's see.

1130
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:31,720
I went to undergrad at Yale.

1131
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:35,357
I have been with the
Bureau for about 12 years.

1132
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,760
Um, up for a promotion.

1133
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:39,696
See, I... I caught the,
um, I caught the Red...

1134
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:41,698
the Red Falls Killer.

1135
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,599
Yeah, I remember thinking
that guy was innocent.

1136
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:45,401
Yeah, he's been in jail
for 11 months.

1137
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:48,003
That would make me
a horrible person,

1138
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:50,307
if any of what you said
was actually factual, so...

1139
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:52,108
Well, you can just tell
the judge you fucked up.

1140
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:55,612
I w... I... I... I didn't,
eh, I did not "F" up.

1141
00:39:55,614 --> 00:39:57,146
Listen, don't get
your panties in a wad.

1142
00:39:57,148 --> 00:39:58,582
Just...  They're not wadded,
I'm just... my...

1143
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,350
I'm intuitive,
I say what I feel.

1144
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:01,985
I'm usually right.
 Oh.

1145
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:04,387
Take it or leave it.
 Oh, I didn't, I did not know.

1146
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:07,692
Okay.

1147
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:09,460
Hey, say hi to Tommy.

1148
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:10,728
It's Tommy.

1149
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,863
All right,
there's our guy.

1150
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:13,630
I... I see him as well.

1151
00:40:20,873 --> 00:40:25,476
? Daft Punk is playing
at my house, my house ?

1152
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,250
? I'll show you the ropes, kid,
show you the ropes ?

1153
00:40:33,785 --> 00:40:37,756
? Got a bus and a trailer
at my house, my house ?

1154
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:40,425
There he is, it...
 What?

1155
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:41,793
Over there.

1156
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:43,928
? I'll show you the ropes,
kid... ?

1157
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,464
We got to get past
those bodyguards.

1158
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:47,099
We're not gonna have to,

1159
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:48,467
'cause he's
gonna come to us.

1160
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:49,735
Come on.
 What?

1161
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:52,237
Excuse me!
Step aside, please.

1162
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,672
All right.

1163
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:54,807
This is, this is
gonna go fast.

1164
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,142
When I, when I pull
the alarm,

1165
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:57,843
the crowds are gonna head
towards the two exits.

1166
00:40:57,845 --> 00:40:59,278
He's gonna head
towards the nearest one,

1167
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,013
which is northeast; I will
bump into him in the crowd.

1168
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:02,948
I will grab the cell,
place the bug within the phone,

1169
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,684
tell him he dropped his phone.

1170
00:41:04,686 --> 00:41:07,153
It's, it's, uh, something I like
to call a "cop drop. "

1171
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:09,556
Yeah. Got it.
 Okay, here we go.

1172
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:15,328
My God, there are absolutely
no wires attached to this thing.

1173
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,863
Now, what is that?
What, is that gum or is that...?

1174
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,498
No, that's Silly Putty?

1175
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,833
I mean, why is it...?
 Don't touch it, it's a condom.

1176
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,137
All right, he's on the move.

1177
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:25,773
Okay, we got to get
out there and shake

1178
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:26,774
our asses like the
rest of the foxes.

1179
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,374
Ah, oh, yes, yes, yes,

1180
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:29,943
dancing to get close to him...
that is a fantastic idea.

1181
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,077
Okay, here we go.
 Jesus, don't do it.

1182
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,080
Don't, don't.
 What?

1183
00:41:33,082 --> 00:41:34,748
What, why are we...?
 Don't do anything you're doing.

1184
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,983
But, but he's over that way.

1185
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:37,851
Just... let's go
find a bathroom.

1186
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:40,788
I told you, I don't have
to use the bathroom.

1187
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,290
Did I ask you about
your bathroom habits?

1188
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,691
You are killing us
out there.

1189
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:44,858
You don't fit in.

1190
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,427
Take off that
fucking jacket.

1191
00:41:46,429 --> 00:41:48,329
Well, this is a, this is
a good jacket. This is...

1192
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:49,863
Really? 'Cause you look like
you're gonna set up a table

1193
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:50,999
and do their fucking taxes.

1194
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:52,167
Take off your jacket.

1195
00:41:52,169 --> 00:41:53,501
My God, this is
ridiculous... why...?

1196
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:55,203
Your shitty jacket? My God.
 Shhshh! Zip it.

1197
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:58,339
Okay, jacket's off,
okay, jacket's off.

1198
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,042
No, no, I can't watch whatever
process is about to happen.

1199
00:42:01,044 --> 00:42:02,043
Now unbutton
your buttons.

1200
00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:03,545
I'm a federal agent.

1201
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:05,280
I don't...  Yeah, I know,
and you look like one.

1202
00:42:05,282 --> 00:42:07,015
Oh, God.  You think you're
gonna bump into him

1203
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:08,016
and he's not going to
think something's up?

1204
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:09,485
Fine, fine, how's that?

1205
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:11,487
Is that good, is that good?
Can we go? Can we please go?

1206
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:13,254
I don't know how it's happening.
I think it's getting worse.

1207
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:15,223
I... my fear is that I'm
gonna put you in a bikini

1208
00:42:15,225 --> 00:42:17,158
and you'll still look like
a fucking bank teller.

1209
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,929
Okay, do you have to use
that language, do you?

1210
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:21,430
I'm trying to
make a point.

1211
00:42:21,432 --> 00:42:23,733
I'm saying your face
and whatever is underneath

1212
00:42:23,735 --> 00:42:26,068
this shitty outfit is maybe
not terrible.  Oh, okay.

1213
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,436
I'll have you know
I dress appropriately.

1214
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:29,038
I, I, I like to...

1215
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,207
I got it, I got it.
It's when this...

1216
00:42:31,209 --> 00:42:32,875
your big flapping mouth...

1217
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:34,577
starts running,
and then you put

1218
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:38,482
th  this getup on top of it,
and it's, it's just a...

1219
00:42:38,484 --> 00:42:40,183
it's a boner killer,
and I'm gonna help you.

1220
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:42,285
What are you doing, what are
you doing, what are you doing,

1221
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:43,753
what are you doing?
 Now, I just want you to shut up.

1222
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:45,087
Oh, my God, just...

1223
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,422
Oh, my God.
 Would you shut up?

1224
00:42:46,424 --> 00:42:48,125
I, I only brought five
of these to Boston.

1225
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:49,926
Then, I'll, I'll
cut the other four.

1226
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:52,362
God, that's
terrible fabric.

1227
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,297
This was...
 Just get that off your wrist.

1228
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:56,668
This was one
of my favorite ones.

1229
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,868
Well...

1230
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,302
God, just take it off,
take it off!

1231
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:01,938
Just give me a second,
I'll take it off!

1232
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,442
Okay, I, I look like
I've been attacked.

1233
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:06,544
That's not my fault.

1234
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:07,745
What, oh, it's my fault?
 I'm gonna...

1235
00:43:07,747 --> 00:43:09,347
Let me even out the bottom.

1236
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:12,150
Okay, would you just stop
carving up my clothes?!  Stop!

1237
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:13,517
I'm making shorts!

1238
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:14,718
Everybody likes shorts.

1239
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,454
Oh, my word.
 Jesus, hold still.

1240
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:17,522
Oh, please, just...

1241
00:43:17,524 --> 00:43:20,191
W... hey.
 That feels awkward, weird.

1242
00:43:20,193 --> 00:43:21,492
Just don't touch that area.

1243
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:22,827
Well, don't duck down.

1244
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:24,530
You're gonna suck
my hand up there.

1245
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:25,964
It's... will you pull...?

1246
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:28,032
Stop pulling my pants off.

1247
00:43:28,034 --> 00:43:30,368
Jesus.
 What?

1248
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,569
What are those?

1249
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:32,570
What?
 What are those?

1250
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:33,972
Stop, stop it.

1251
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:36,075
They're my Spanx, they hold
everything together.

1252
00:43:36,077 --> 00:43:39,378
Why, what's gonna f...
come fucking popping out?

1253
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,813
Nothing! It just keeps
everything

1254
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:41,947
where it's supposed
to be, like in...

1255
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:43,114
Shit, like medically?

1256
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:46,218
No, no, not medically,
just to...

1257
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,121
Uh, just keeps it right
where it's supposed to be.

1258
00:43:49,123 --> 00:43:51,690
You got to, you got
to vent that furnace.

1259
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:54,027
Okay.  That's a lot of
compression and heat.

1260
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:56,296
It gets plenty of ventilation,
thank you.

1261
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:57,896
My hand's a foot off and it's on fire.
 Okay, okay, well, then

1262
00:43:57,898 --> 00:43:59,031
why don't you cut
these shorts shorter

1263
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:00,299
because no one can see
my cervix yet?

1264
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:01,533
Go ahead.
 I'll cut 'em shorter.

1265
00:44:01,535 --> 00:44:04,003
No, I'm... stop it, we're finished.

1266
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:05,371
Okay, let's
just do you now.

1267
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:07,073
Come on, let's just...
 I, I don't need,

1268
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,042
I don't need that to...
 What do you mean?

1269
00:44:09,044 --> 00:44:12,480
I put out my sexuality
through motion.

1270
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:13,947
When this starts
going, it's all...

1271
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:15,448
You'll get it.

1272
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,151
So I have to look like this
and you get to look like that?

1273
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:19,786
I know, it's not fair.

1274
00:44:19,788 --> 00:44:20,855
Oh, my God.

1275
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:22,456
We got to tackle
the helmet.

1276
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:26,694
It's got a real...
style memory, huh?

1277
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:28,895
Shit, you got to... you
got to flip that shit over.

1278
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:30,297
Bend over.
 Why?

1279
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:32,500
You look like Darth Vader.
Just flip it over.

1280
00:44:32,502 --> 00:44:34,769
God Almighty.
 God, just...

1281
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,937
I gotta just finger tease
the shit out of this.

1282
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:38,272
You're doing what?
You're finger...?

1283
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:39,541
I'm going to
finger tease it.

1284
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,277
What is that?
What does that mean?

1285
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,278
Not what you want it to mean.

1286
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,017
? Now I lay me down
to sleep... ?

1287
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,019
Hit it!

1288
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,721
? I just can't find
the beat... ?

1289
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,523
What are you looking at?

1290
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,392
I like how your friend's shorts
make me feel in my shorts.

1291
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,295
I am sorry, that was much cruder
than I meant it to be.

1292
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,030
I stand corrected
on the shorts.

1293
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,732
Let's proceed.

1294
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,534
Oh, God, we're dead.

1295
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,968
Ah, one o'clock, one o'clock.

1296
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,371
Mm, yeah.
Let's do this.

1297
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,973
All right.

1298
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:13,809
Get in there,
get in there.

1299
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,477
How do you, how do you get in?
I don't know how you...

1300
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,280
How do you get in?
 In, back, back it in.

1301
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:18,748
 Yeah, baby, yeah, let's go.
 Get in there.  Whoa.

1302
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,817
Get your hands in, get your
hands in and get the phone.

1303
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:21,818
Okay, Pinky. Yuck!

1304
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,119
Do the fucking
cop drop.

1305
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,720
I'm trying to!
 Do the fucking cop drop!

1306
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,957
Oh, baby.
 I can't do it from this position!

1307
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:28,825
? Stoplight...

1308
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:30,359
No, no, no, no!

1309
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,428
Okay, coming in one more time.

1310
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,963
Get her away, get her away.

1311
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,966
Aah!
 I got her, I got her, I got her!

1312
00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:37,100
You're like a fucking gnat!

1313
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:38,368
Picture time! Yes!

1314
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,037
Damn it, can somebody
get my phone?

1315
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,372
I got it, I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it, I got it!

1316
00:45:42,374 --> 00:45:44,207
Let go, let go,
let go, let go, let go.

1317
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,210
Thanks a lot, bro, and
close a couple buttons.

1318
00:45:46,212 --> 00:45:48,045
You Ahole. Ahole!
 Club policy. Whoa, Jesus.

1319
00:45:48,047 --> 00:45:49,213
There we go.
 God bless.

1320
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:50,581
I got it,
I got the orange one.

1321
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,583
Oh, my God, I need,
I need some water.

1322
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:54,485
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
 My God,

1323
00:45:54,487 --> 00:45:55,887
I will fucking kill you,
I will fucking kill you.

1324
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,488
Oh, where is he, where is he?

1325
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,189
Get in there, get in there, go.
 Okay, coming one more time.

1326
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:00,490
Get her away, get her away.
 Oh, my God.

1327
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:01,859
Jesus, there's
too many of 'em.

1328
00:46:01,861 --> 00:46:03,795
Hey, all right, hi, hi.

1329
00:46:03,797 --> 00:46:06,097
 Your moves are weird as shit.
 I got it.  Aah!

1330
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,465
Yeah? You have really soft hair.
 And I love it.

1331
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:09,067
Oh, yeah, oh,
it's the shampoo move.

1332
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:10,268
Use your boobs.

1333
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,669
Oh, yeah, uh, okay.
 Use your boobs!

1334
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,504
You see these, see these?
 Oh, my God, yeah.

1335
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:15,306
Yeah, look at 'em, look at 'em.
 Oh, my... oh, my God.

1336
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:16,808
I'm looking, I'm liking.
 Shake it, yeah, shake it.

1337
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,543
Oh, yeah.  Shove him in there,
shove him in there.

1338
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:20,144
I'll get her, I'll get her.
 Get her away.

1339
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:21,746
Hey, what is this?

1340
00:46:21,748 --> 00:46:22,848
What's going on, girl?

1341
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:23,849
Whoa, yeah!

1342
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,251
No.
 There we go.

1343
00:46:25,253 --> 00:46:27,219
Dave! Oh, God, back it in.
 Am I in, am I in?

1344
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:28,686
Get in there, get in there.
 Whoa, please.

1345
00:46:28,688 --> 00:46:30,388
Hi.
 Hi.

1346
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,957
You know, you're the
first chick over 40

1347
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,259
to give me a boner.

1348
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:35,828
Great, great.

1349
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:36,929
Want to go get a drink?

1350
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:38,831
Okay, yeah.

1351
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:43,203
Maybe, maybe.

1352
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:45,271
It's the only reason
girls hit on me, I think.

1353
00:46:45,273 --> 00:46:46,672
Oh, sorry, yeah.
 You know?

1354
00:46:46,674 --> 00:46:48,007
'Cause every night,
the hottest chicks...

1355
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:49,141
they come in here,
they're like,

1356
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:50,442
"Hey, there's
LeSoire. "

1357
00:46:50,444 --> 00:46:52,846
Short skirts, too much
makeup, just looking

1358
00:46:52,848 --> 00:46:54,981
like fucking gremlins, right?
 Oh, I hate that.

1359
00:46:54,983 --> 00:46:57,250
Don't feed 'em, don't feed
'em after midnight, right?

1360
00:46:57,252 --> 00:46:59,118
Yeah.
 They turn into more sluts.

1361
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,353
Fuck it.

1362
00:47:00,355 --> 00:47:02,255
Give me a whiskey.

1363
00:47:02,257 --> 00:47:03,823
I just noticed that lion,
that lion.

1364
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:06,393
It's just... that is amazing.
 Fuck, who the fuck keeps

1365
00:47:06,395 --> 00:47:08,361
putting lions in the back?

1366
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:09,931
Fourteen dollars.

1367
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:11,399
Fourteen dollars?!

1368
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:14,100
I  Is it magic
fucking whiskey?

1369
00:47:14,102 --> 00:47:15,602
Do, do I get a
motorcycle with it?

1370
00:47:15,604 --> 00:47:17,938
Is it gonna be served
in Jesus' shoe?

1371
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,073
Can I sit
on your lap?

1372
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:20,408
Obviously.
 Okay, all right.

1373
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,943
Yeah, let's... I like
where this is going.

1374
00:47:21,945 --> 00:47:23,110
Me, too; me, too.

1375
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:24,412
I love foam.
 My nephew knows Seal.

1376
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:26,280
Trying to get Seal
to come up in here.

1377
00:47:26,282 --> 00:47:27,581
Oh! I would love to, oh!

1378
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:28,883
We're having a, uh...

1379
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:30,084
Yeah?
 ... big foam party later.

1380
00:47:30,086 --> 00:47:31,419
Oh, I look forward...
 Hey, hey!

1381
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:33,487
 Oh, shit...  I'm plastered.
 So sorry.

1382
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:35,089
Fuck, get up.

1383
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:36,357
Let's go.
 God, I am so sorry.

1384
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,293
Hey!  Come on, honey,
get up. Drunk bitch.

1385
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:39,728
Get her the fuck out
of here, guys, come on.

1386
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,263
Oh, God, she holds her
liquor like a fiveyearold.

1387
00:47:41,265 --> 00:47:42,931
I'm so sorry.
 Let's go.

1388
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:44,432
I'm sorry.
 All right, sweetheart, you're out.

1389
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:46,233
 I'm a pony!
 Time to go.  Sorry.

1390
00:47:46,235 --> 00:47:48,136
I'm a pony!
 I'm so sorry.

1391
00:47:48,138 --> 00:47:49,972
Get her the fuck out of... yeah,
take her home.  Come on, pony,

1392
00:47:49,974 --> 00:47:51,907
...let's go.  Hey, I got to drive
the school bus tomorrow.

1393
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:53,942
It's my shift.
 What the fuck are you talking about?

1394
00:47:53,944 --> 00:47:55,711
It's my shift!
 Here we go.

1395
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:57,513
Come on, sweetheart, go.
 I didn't get your number.

1396
00:47:57,515 --> 00:47:59,848
It's 21... 22...
 I'll find you, I'll find you.

1397
00:48:11,562 --> 00:48:13,695
Oh, pretty nice, right?
 Whoo.

1398
00:48:13,697 --> 00:48:15,965
I have to say, that
was pretty awesome.

1399
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:17,233
It really was, man.

1400
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:18,501
Put 'er there.
 Put 'er there.

1401
00:48:18,503 --> 00:48:19,969
Yeah... no, put 'er,
put 'er there.

1402
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:21,404
Oh.

1403
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:22,672
Aah!
 Don't do that.

1404
00:48:22,674 --> 00:48:25,376
What?
 You just make it odd.

1405
00:48:25,378 --> 00:48:26,443
I'm trying so hard
not to lash out at you,

1406
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,045
and you make it

1407
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:29,612
really fucking
impossible.

1408
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:33,116
What was that about?
 We got company.

1409
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,285
Oh, shit.

1410
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,820
Hold on,

1411
00:48:36,822 --> 00:48:38,789
I can lose 'em.
 Do you want me to take the wheel?

1412
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,624
No, I was a precision
driver at Quantico.

1413
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,493
They thought I was the
instructor; I was that good.

1414
00:48:46,032 --> 00:48:47,031
Oh, shoot.

1415
00:48:49,168 --> 00:48:52,503
Lose 'em!  I'm... What do
you think I'm trying to do?

1416
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,742
Let me steer it, I...
 Stop it, stop it, I got it.

1417
00:49:00,845 --> 00:49:02,680
Hold on.

1418
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:14,459
Ha!

1419
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:17,128
And that, that is
how you lose a tail.

1420
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,064
Nicely done.
 Yes.

1421
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:21,100
I'm surprised.

1422
00:49:21,102 --> 00:49:22,735
Our friends are back.

1423
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:24,603
I got it, I got it, I got it, tag out.
 What are you doing?

1424
00:49:24,605 --> 00:49:26,205
I'll show you how I stop a tail.
 What are you doing?

1425
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:27,206
Just tell me what
you're doing.

1426
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,807
Watch out!

1427
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:31,143
Aah!

1428
00:49:32,746 --> 00:49:34,814
FBI! Drop your weapon!
Oh, my God.

1429
00:49:34,816 --> 00:49:36,882
What the hell is that?
 I don't know.

1430
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:39,218
Special Agent Garrett, DEA!
Drop it!

1431
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,354
No, seriously,
what the fuck are you?

1432
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,622
What are you, fucking deaf?
I just told you.

1433
00:49:42,624 --> 00:49:45,691
DEA. Drop your fucking gun!
Now!

1434
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,629
Shit.

1435
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:51,531
I'm, I'm very sorry
about earlier.

1436
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,900
I just thought you
were an assassin

1437
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:55,635
'cause of your weapon.

1438
00:49:55,637 --> 00:49:57,204
And because you
look evil as shit.

1439
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,639
Yeah, I get it, all right?

1440
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:00,807
I'm an albino, so I look
like a bad guy, right?

1441
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:02,242
No, no, that's not...
 Yeah.

1442
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:03,477
That's not what we were...
 Yeah.

1443
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:04,845
Yeah, well, I'm DEA.
Hmm.

1444
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:06,379
And let me tell
you something.

1445
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,782
Two months we been
sitting on that club,

1446
00:50:07,784 --> 00:50:09,183
and then you two come
in here one night

1447
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:10,685
like a couple of
fucking amateurs,

1448
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,420
and you almost blow the whole thing!
 All right,

1449
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:14,721
obviously you have no idea
who you're speaking with.

1450
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,223
I'm Federal Agent
Sarah Ashburn...

1451
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:17,725
Yes, I am sure your
credentials are

1452
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,295
quite impressive, as is your
choice of wardrobe there.

1453
00:50:21,297 --> 00:50:22,563
Nice hot pants.
You might want to try

1454
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:24,065
shshaving above the knee
next time.

1455
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:26,100
Are you giving
beauty tips?

1456
00:50:26,102 --> 00:50:27,436
Do you own a
fucking mirror?

1457
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:28,637
Listen to me, all right?

1458
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:30,271
This whole "female
professionals

1459
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:32,273
in the workplace" thing, man,
I'm fine with it, all right?

1460
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:35,610
But here's the problem, all
due respect, with you people...

1461
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:36,678
is that you get
all excited,

1462
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,280
you let your emotions
take over,

1463
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:40,516
your hormones kick in,
you're riding the cotton pony.

1464
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:42,551
The next thing you know,
you're complimenting the bad guy

1465
00:50:42,553 --> 00:50:44,185
on his fucking couch!

1466
00:50:44,187 --> 00:50:46,688
Oh, well, all due respect
to you, who's your wife,

1467
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,590
a fivepound bag of
flour with a hole in it?

1468
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:50,359
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, listen, ma'ams,

1469
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:52,761
we've been cramped inside this
van for two months, all right,

1470
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,464
and we're not gonna let you
swoop in from out of nowhere

1471
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:55,999
and take all the credit.

1472
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:58,535
I don't want to see you two
anywhere near this case.

1473
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:00,736
We have got informants
everywhere.

1474
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:02,304
We've got surveillance
everywhere.

1475
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:03,772
We do not need
the two of you

1476
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:06,509
coming in with your estrogen
flying at full speed,

1477
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:08,411
sticking out in the middle
of broad daylight,

1478
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:09,746
fucking things
up for us.

1479
00:51:09,748 --> 00:51:11,347
'Cause the two of
us are gonna bring

1480
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:12,949
these guys in.
 Shit.

1481
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:15,685
Fuck you,
chalk balls.

1482
00:51:15,687 --> 00:51:17,620
Not even on your
birthday, sweetheart.

1483
00:51:18,522 --> 00:51:20,423
That's right, keep walking.

1484
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:23,127
This isn't over.

1485
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:24,495
Okay?

1486
00:51:24,497 --> 00:51:26,197
And FYI, women were b...
we were born

1487
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:28,199
with hair on our legs.
 Yeah.

1488
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:33,571
You don't have to stop.

1489
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:34,772
Well, what are you doing?

1490
00:51:34,774 --> 00:51:36,106
Whoawhoawhoawhoa
whoawhoawhoa!

1491
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:39,610
Get...

1492
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:43,315
Okay, do you want to tell me
what was wrong back there?

1493
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:46,450
Nothing.  I saw your face when
you were looking at the footage.

1494
00:51:46,452 --> 00:51:48,652
It looked like you
saw someone you knew.

1495
00:51:48,654 --> 00:51:51,389
Possibly your brother?

1496
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:54,626
You did not read that
from my fucking face.

1497
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:55,927
You read my file,
didn't you?

1498
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:57,429
God, you're an asshole.
 Okay, yes,

1499
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:59,163
I read your file, but
it is my job to know

1500
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:02,067
everything about a case,
including who I work with.

1501
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:03,235
I don't like that.

1502
00:52:03,237 --> 00:52:05,971
We should talk
to him tomorrow.

1503
00:52:05,973 --> 00:52:07,839
Where is he?

1504
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:09,742
Probably at my parents'.

1505
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:12,044
Well, then, let's go
to your parents'.

1506
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,413
I can't... no, I can't go
to my parents'.  Why?

1507
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:17,949
I'm the one that put him in jail.

1508
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,621
Okay, never mind.

1509
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:25,358
It's not like
I liked doing it.

1510
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,562
You know, he got mixed up with
a lot of really bad people

1511
00:52:28,564 --> 00:52:31,664
and then he started...
he started using that shit,

1512
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,733
and I just had
to get him out of there.

1513
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:37,370
You know, iironically, a lot
of people become addicted

1514
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:38,672
when they're in...
in prison.

1515
00:52:38,674 --> 00:52:39,940
I think it's like 80,

1516
00:52:39,942 --> 00:52:43,443
85% of the inmates
require treatment.

1517
00:52:43,445 --> 00:52:45,244
I hate you.

1518
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,846
Yeah, I know;
I'm sorry.

1519
00:52:46,848 --> 00:52:48,782
But I... you know,
I actually wasn't finished.

1520
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:50,384
I was going to say...

1521
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:56,724
Why can't you just be quiet?

1522
00:53:39,235 --> 00:53:40,436
What the "F"?

1523
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:42,705
These are cloth, they're nice.

1524
00:53:42,707 --> 00:53:44,606
I could have shot you.
 Oh, I'm sorry,

1525
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:47,409
do you not like
someone invading your privacy?

1526
00:53:47,411 --> 00:53:48,577
Oh, come on.

1527
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:50,346
I, I glanced at your file.

1528
00:53:50,348 --> 00:53:51,947
You broke into my home.

1529
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:54,384
I care about who
I'm working with, too,

1530
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:56,553
and it's a little
uncomfortable

1531
00:53:56,555 --> 00:53:58,321
that you feel the need
to travel with trophies.

1532
00:53:58,323 --> 00:54:00,122
Okay, well, it's,
it's not what you think.

1533
00:54:00,124 --> 00:54:02,659
They moved me up here, they
rented this apartment, and,

1534
00:54:02,661 --> 00:54:03,893
and this is all my stuff.

1535
00:54:03,895 --> 00:54:06,162
These four shitty,
sad boxes... this is it?

1536
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:08,064
This is your life?

1537
00:54:08,066 --> 00:54:09,265
Yes.

1538
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:11,134
Oh, God.

1539
00:54:11,136 --> 00:54:13,304
I don't think that could be
any sadder if you threw it all

1540
00:54:13,306 --> 00:54:15,205
in the trash bag and started
dragging it behind you.

1541
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:16,706
Oh, my word, you,

1542
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:19,709
you use coffee filters
for toilet paper at your house.

1543
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:21,779
I'm buying 'em anyway;
they have a dual purpose.

1544
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:23,581
That's not what they're for.
 Yeah, real fancypants.

1545
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:26,717
I see it; I see it in here.

1546
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:28,853
Looks like you were pretty cool
in high school, huh?

1547
00:54:28,855 --> 00:54:31,455
Yes, yes, III was,
but what...?

1548
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:33,124
Because you weren't.

1549
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:35,359
You know what that girl's not?
That girl's not cool.

1550
00:54:35,361 --> 00:54:38,162
My favorite part is,
you only have two signatures,

1551
00:54:38,164 --> 00:54:39,531
both by teachers.

1552
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:42,434
Mrs. Burke said,
"Have a good summer. "

1553
00:54:42,436 --> 00:54:43,602
That's a personal touch.

1554
00:54:43,604 --> 00:54:45,903
And then my real favorite
is this one.

1555
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:48,539
"It'll get better. "

1556
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,442
Yes, fine.

1557
00:54:50,444 --> 00:54:52,477
Okay, now we're even.

1558
00:54:52,479 --> 00:54:54,713
Okay.

1559
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:55,947
I see you have a cat.

1560
00:54:57,316 --> 00:54:59,118
Yep.

1561
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,420
Is he around?
'Cause I'd kind of like to,

1562
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:02,921
you know, pet him and stuff.

1563
00:55:02,923 --> 00:55:06,992
He ran away, uh,
when I was in New York.

1564
00:55:11,165 --> 00:55:14,066
Oh, God,
that kind of tears me up.

1565
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:16,535
Yeah, it was, um, it was a loss.

1566
00:55:16,537 --> 00:55:18,871
That cat got one look
at your shitty life

1567
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:22,608
and said,
"No fucking thanks, man.

1568
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,477
I am out of here. "

1569
00:55:24,479 --> 00:55:25,878
I'm still

1570
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,115
kind of just grieving
a little bit about it.

1571
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:32,351
That fucking tabby is
an asshole, that's what he is.

1572
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:33,853
Fuck you.

1573
00:55:33,855 --> 00:55:36,690
Fuck you...
that's what I say to that cat.

1574
00:55:36,692 --> 00:55:38,025
Goddamn it.

1575
00:55:42,063 --> 00:55:44,665
Oh.
 Such a shitty, shitty little life.

1576
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:47,768
Even the... you can't
even keep a cat.

1577
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,670
Ah, you know, that just
hurts a little bit.

1578
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:51,905
That's just the grief.
 No, not the grief.

1579
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:53,440
It's just the, the pounding
a little bit, just...

1580
00:55:53,442 --> 00:55:54,876
Oh.

1581
00:55:54,878 --> 00:55:56,845
All right, well, don't be
a dick about it, but...

1582
00:55:56,847 --> 00:55:58,146
Well, thank you for that.
That was...

1583
00:55:58,148 --> 00:56:01,248
All right, let's
hit the road, okay?

1584
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,783
I gotta change.

1585
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:05,286
What's the matter
with your pantsuit?

1586
00:56:05,288 --> 00:56:07,155
It's, it's pajamas.

1587
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:08,890
Well, excuse
the shit out of me.

1588
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:11,860
I didn't realize you slept
in a fucking tux.

1589
00:56:11,862 --> 00:56:14,063
W...
 Go ahead, get your top hat.

1590
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,878
You could get a girlfriend
and get a job.

1591
00:56:30,714 --> 00:56:32,314
You don't swear at me.

1592
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:34,083
This is the place
where you're supposed

1593
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:35,484
to be civilized.
Okay, stop yelling at everybody.

1594
00:56:35,486 --> 00:56:37,119
 Okay?
 For once in your life,

1595
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,420
be a mother.
 I don't know why your whole family

1596
00:56:38,422 --> 00:56:39,788
is jealous of me, then.
 Be a mother for once

1597
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,923
in your life, just...
 Some chicken?

1598
00:56:40,925 --> 00:56:43,126
Oh, great, this asshole.

1599
00:56:43,128 --> 00:56:44,794
All right, just take it easy.

1600
00:56:44,796 --> 00:56:45,861
Hey, Pop.

1601
00:56:45,863 --> 00:56:47,096
Hey, pork chop.

1602
00:56:47,098 --> 00:56:49,798
Ah, well, well, well,
look who it is.

1603
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,268
Yeah, the rat's back in the house.
 Nice.

1604
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,736
What, did you come back
to arrest somebody else?

1605
00:56:52,738 --> 00:56:54,237
Hey, you know, I saw Ma threw

1606
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:55,939
a can of, uh, Diet Coke
in the garbage the other day.

1607
00:56:55,941 --> 00:56:57,173
She didn't even recycle it.

1608
00:56:57,175 --> 00:57:00,009
Dad here... he's splicing cable

1609
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:02,145
off the neighbors next door.
 Hey, come on, now, Mark.

1610
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:03,747
Maybe you should start
fingerprinting him, huh?

1611
00:57:03,749 --> 00:57:06,016
That'd be a good call, and
maybe get yourself some stripes?

1612
00:57:06,018 --> 00:57:07,484
Petey over here,
how many, how many songs

1613
00:57:07,486 --> 00:57:10,021
you download illegally
off the Internet... 5,000?

1614
00:57:10,023 --> 00:57:11,923
Ten, 20,000.
 20,000.

1615
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:13,057
Mikey stole a laptop

1616
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:14,325
from his work
the other day.

1617
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:15,792
Stole? I fucking worked
there for six weeks.

1618
00:57:15,794 --> 00:57:16,826
I deserved
to fucking take it.

1619
00:57:16,828 --> 00:57:17,827
Exactly... no health insurance.

1620
00:57:17,829 --> 00:57:19,597
That balances out, but not you.

1621
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,599
You'll probably call in the
fucking SWAT team, won't you?

1622
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:22,800
Uh, actually she could,

1623
00:57:22,802 --> 00:57:24,201
'cause these are
horrible examples.

1624
00:57:24,203 --> 00:57:27,638
Here are the nuggies.
 All right, here we go.

1625
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:34,111
What kind of an animal throws
her own brother in jail?

1626
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:35,313
This kind of animal,
right here.

1627
00:57:35,315 --> 00:57:36,347
Shut up, shut up.

1628
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:37,983
How about keeps him
from killing himself?

1629
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:39,718
I was the only one
that got him off the street.

1630
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,119
None of you fucks did.

1631
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:43,722
You should never
arrest your family.

1632
00:57:43,724 --> 00:57:45,623
Who the fuck are you?
 That's Gina.

1633
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,593
Well, tell Gina I'm going to
strangle her at the table.

1634
00:57:47,595 --> 00:57:48,894
Hey, she is
my best friend.

1635
00:57:48,896 --> 00:57:49,928
You touch her, you got
to go through me first.

1636
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,563
Who the fuck are you?

1637
00:57:51,565 --> 00:57:53,999
I'll kill you and kill her
with your fucking dead body!

1638
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:55,467
Okay, everybody calm down.

1639
00:57:55,469 --> 00:57:56,970
Shannon's right.

1640
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:59,005
This one has no business
chiming in on a family matter.

1641
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:00,039
"This one"?
What, why are you talking

1642
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:01,039
about my girlfriend like that?

1643
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,407
She wears sweatpants

1644
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:03,675
to your mother's dinner,
that's why.

1645
00:58:03,677 --> 00:58:04,977
Those are
her classy sweatpants.

1646
00:58:04,979 --> 00:58:06,145
They don't say
"Insert Here" on the ass.

1647
00:58:06,147 --> 00:58:07,513
Her ass is hanging out!

1648
00:58:07,515 --> 00:58:10,416
Look at her, look at her breasts
at the table!

1649
00:58:13,488 --> 00:58:14,487
Welcome home.

1650
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:15,822
Hey.

1651
00:58:15,824 --> 00:58:18,758
What, you here to arrest me?
 I hope not.

1652
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,960
You selling Bibles?

1653
00:58:20,962 --> 00:58:22,962
No, she's... Ashburn.

1654
00:58:22,964 --> 00:58:24,565
Let's go, let's go.

1655
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,866
We need to talk. Go.

1656
00:58:25,868 --> 00:58:27,601
Sit down.

1657
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:28,769
Really?

1658
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:36,877
Okay, enough,
enough, all right?

1659
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:38,045
Get your hands off me.

1660
00:58:41,182 --> 00:58:43,351
Uh, that is, uh,
that's one of the,

1661
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,887
uh, better Jesus sportsthemed
paintings I've seen.

1662
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:50,190
That's very good, nice.

1663
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:51,592
What are you doing
at Club Ekko?

1664
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,161
What are you, my mother?
What, were you following me?

1665
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,462
How do you know I was there?

1666
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,464
'Cause I know everything,
that's why.

1667
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,299
Are you already working
for those guys again?

1668
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,367
No, no, this guy Julian...
he sent for me

1669
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:02,003
because he wants me to
start working for him,

1670
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,471
but I told him, "No,

1671
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,206
I'm getting a straight
job," and it's fine.

1672
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,541
We're... everybody's cool now.

1673
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,810
Wewe... parted amicably.

1674
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,345
Are you a "knock"?

1675
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:12,481
I'm sorry?
 Are you a knock?

1676
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:14,950
A knock. I d... I'm sorry,
I don't know what that is.

1677
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:16,818
A knock.
 A knock.

1678
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,486
Am I speaking fucking Japanese?

1679
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:19,754
Yeah, listen to him.

1680
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,157
I'm gonna sound
it out for you.

1681
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:26,295
Are you or are you not...

1682
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:27,329
a knock?

1683
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:28,364
A fucking knock.

1684
00:59:28,366 --> 00:59:30,333
<i>Like Johnny Depp
in 21 Jump Street.</i>

1685
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:33,035
Ah, I see, I see,
okay, aa narc.

1686
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:34,270
A knock, yes.
 Ah, yes, yes... no, I...

1687
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:35,638
What are you...
what was I saying?

1688
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,273
I was missing the "R"
when you were saying...

1689
00:59:37,275 --> 00:59:38,908
I heard "knock",
but apparently there's a "C. "

1690
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,310
He said, he said "knock. "
 I said,

1691
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:42,079
I said fucking "knock," right?
 Wow.

1692
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:43,113
Why are you wearing
a longsleeved flannel?

1693
00:59:43,115 --> 00:59:44,548
It's hot out.

1694
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,082
Eh, I'm, I'm a little
fluey, I was...

1695
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:47,349
It's nothing.
 You want, you want me

1696
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:48,818
to break that thumb?
 Please don't...

1697
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,920
Want me to break that thumb?
 No, no, no.

1698
00:59:49,922 --> 00:59:50,921
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

1699
00:59:50,923 --> 00:59:52,089
Straighten that arm.

1700
00:59:52,091 --> 00:59:53,590
Uh, it looks worse
than it is.

1701
00:59:53,592 --> 00:59:54,891
ItIt's not a big deal.

1702
00:59:54,893 --> 00:59:56,460
This guy Julian,
you know,

1703
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:58,229
they don't want me to stop
working, they like me.

1704
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:00,064
You tell me where I can find
Julian right now.

1705
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:01,064
No, just stay out of it.

1706
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:02,532
They're fucking maniacs.

1707
01:00:02,534 --> 01:00:04,501
They'll chop you up oor
gun you down or worse.

1708
01:00:04,503 --> 01:00:06,703
Okay, we're...
 Jason, tell me what you fucking know.

1709
01:00:06,705 --> 01:00:07,872
I don't know anything.

1710
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:08,940
I, I... ouch!

1711
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,475
D  D  DDon't.

1712
01:00:10,477 --> 01:00:13,010
Okay, Sal, Sal Natale.
 I'll rip it open.

1713
01:00:13,012 --> 01:00:15,612
Okay, you know Sal Natale?

1714
01:00:15,614 --> 01:00:16,947
Of course I know Sal Natale.

1715
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,483
He was going to steal
this huge shipment

1716
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:20,485
they got coming in,
so they popped him.

1717
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:22,019
He's in the trunk
of his Caddy

1718
01:00:22,021 --> 01:00:23,254
under the Charles
River Bridge.

1719
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:24,422
I want you to stay
in this house.

1720
01:00:24,424 --> 01:00:25,823
If I catch you
out of this house,

1721
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:27,259
I'm gonna hurt you
worse than them.

1722
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,794
What are you, what,
what are you doing here?

1723
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:30,429
What are you doing?
 No, I'm a, I'm a federal agent.

1724
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:31,629
I'm a special agent, and I...

1725
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:32,864
Special, like retarded?

1726
01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:34,565
Well, we don't use that word.

1727
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:38,604
We say "special needs,"
but II have a very high IQ.

1728
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:40,239
Are you a boy or a girl?

1729
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,907
That's a fair question.

1730
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,642
Uh, I'm, I'm female.

1731
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,043
No kidding.

1732
01:00:45,045 --> 01:00:46,612
All woman.

1733
01:00:46,614 --> 01:00:47,613
From the getgo?

1734
01:00:47,615 --> 01:00:48,747
Um...
 No operation?

1735
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:49,748
Um...

1736
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,350
From birth, yes.

1737
01:00:51,352 --> 01:00:53,585
How you get that close
a shave on your face?

1738
01:00:53,587 --> 01:00:55,188
I need to go,
but I'll be back to, um...

1739
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,222
Get back to the airport?
 Yeah, nice knowing you.

1740
01:00:56,224 --> 01:00:57,824
...to... uh, yeah, thank you.

1741
01:00:57,826 --> 01:01:00,193
Yep, that's Sal Natale,
all right. Hmm.

1742
01:01:00,195 --> 01:01:02,194
Bullet hole
through the head.

1743
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:03,863
That's unusually
civilized for them.

1744
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:05,298
Oh, they cut out
his tongue, too.

1745
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,900
Ah, there you have it.

1746
01:01:06,902 --> 01:01:08,468
They like to send
a message.

1747
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,804
Did you find the tongue?
 Sure. Yeah.

1748
01:01:10,806 --> 01:01:12,238
Shoved it up his anal cavity.

1749
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,440
Mmm.
 Ooh, that's a weird message.

1750
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:15,209
Yeah.
The tip of the tongue

1751
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:17,477
was sticking out of the rectum,
so it made it appear as if

1752
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:19,913
his buttocks were giving
the police the raspberry.

1753
01:01:19,915 --> 01:01:22,883
Did they draw googly eyes
or anything on his butt cheeks?

1754
01:01:22,885 --> 01:01:24,218
No.

1755
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,054
Seems like kind of
an opportunity missed.

1756
01:01:27,056 --> 01:01:28,823
That would have been funny.

1757
01:01:28,825 --> 01:01:31,057
Well, II feel that they were

1758
01:01:31,059 --> 01:01:33,527
just trying to be
tongueincheek.

1759
01:01:35,697 --> 01:01:37,798
God, don't do that.

1760
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,534
Uh, where are his belongings?

1761
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:44,372
Any clues as to where
the body was killed?

1762
01:01:44,374 --> 01:01:46,841
No.  We're still looking
for their base camp.

1763
01:01:46,843 --> 01:01:48,509
Well, if there's anything on him

1764
01:01:48,511 --> 01:01:50,678
that will tell us,
I will find it.

1765
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:57,252
 Huh.
 What is that, coke?

1766
01:01:57,254 --> 01:01:58,286
I don't think so.

1767
01:01:58,288 --> 01:01:59,788
It's more like a coating.

1768
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,823
Same traces found
on all the victims' shoes.

1769
01:02:01,825 --> 01:02:02,991
All of them had...

1770
01:02:02,993 --> 01:02:05,193
Epoxy powder coating.
Right?

1771
01:02:05,195 --> 01:02:07,262
That's right.
 Yeah.

1772
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:09,064
And each sample was made up
of the same ingredient,

1773
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:10,299
which probably means
that they...

1774
01:02:10,301 --> 01:02:11,767
They were all killed,
same place.

1775
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,768
Exactly.

1776
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,303
I checked it out.
 Wow.

1777
01:02:14,305 --> 01:02:16,438
There are three places
that have this kind of powder.

1778
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,008
Paint factory. Yes.
 Yeah.

1779
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,010
I think we all know that.
 Well, it's...

1780
01:02:21,012 --> 01:02:22,645
Take a look at this.

1781
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:25,414
This one right here is centered
in the location...

1782
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:26,816
Where all four...
 Where all four dead...

1783
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:28,518
 ... bodies were found. Yeah.
 ... dead bodies were found.

1784
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,453
Right.

1785
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:30,487
That's what I thought.

1786
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:32,021
This one shut down years ago,

1787
01:02:32,023 --> 01:02:34,023
owned by a man by the name
of Leif Sa...

1788
01:02:34,025 --> 01:02:35,324
Saggle... Sagglemint.
 Sambertineson?

1789
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,828
Samber...
 Old Sagglemint.

1790
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,162
Santino.

1791
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:41,365
Santino. Santino.
 Oh, Santino. Santino.

1792
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:43,700
Is that a derivative
of Sagglemint?

1793
01:02:43,702 --> 01:02:45,969
Get me the address
to that paint factory ASAP.

1794
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:49,039
Excuse me, Ashburn? Um, I was
wondering if you would...

1795
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,507
Okay, this is a little awkward.

1796
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:52,743
Uh, it's nothing personal,
but as a rule,

1797
01:02:52,745 --> 01:02:54,044
I... I make it a point

1798
01:02:54,046 --> 01:02:56,514
not to date my coworkers,
so... thank you.

1799
01:02:56,516 --> 01:02:59,450
I was wondering if you would not
talk to me in that tone.

1800
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:02,219
Oh. Oh! Yes, of course.

1801
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:04,221
That's a little different.
 Of course, yeah.

1802
01:03:04,223 --> 01:03:05,622
No, I... I wouldn't.
Why would I?

1803
01:03:05,624 --> 01:03:07,458
Why would you, really?
 I wouldn't.

1804
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,460
Just, we should go
to the paint factory.

1805
01:03:09,462 --> 01:03:11,329
Well, are we clear here?
'Cause I don't...

1806
01:03:11,331 --> 01:03:12,864
It got real awkward
between you guys.

1807
01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:15,033
No, it's... I think
we're all good, right?

1808
01:03:15,035 --> 01:03:16,134
Uh, we're...
 We're really good.

1809
01:03:16,136 --> 01:03:17,669
Same page.
 Yeah.

1810
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:19,170
'Cause I don't want any bad...
 I think we are.

1811
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:20,471
We're all good, right?
Okay, here we go.

1812
01:03:20,473 --> 01:03:22,340
Let's go to the paint factory.

1813
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:23,808
She doesn't want
to date coworkers,

1814
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,344
so spread the word.
Shut up.

1815
01:03:25,346 --> 01:03:26,812
? Caught my man cheatin'

1816
01:03:26,814 --> 01:03:28,881
? Now I'm rolling through
the West Side ?

1817
01:03:28,883 --> 01:03:31,950
? 'Bout to burn this fucking
house down, like I'm Left Eye ?

1818
01:03:31,952 --> 01:03:34,318
? Rest in peace
? Like I'm Left Eye

1819
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:35,354
? Rest in peace
? Like I'm Left Eye

1820
01:03:35,356 --> 01:03:36,922
? 'Bout to burn this
motherfucker down ?

1821
01:03:36,924 --> 01:03:38,757
? Like I'm Left Eye

1822
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:43,062
? Heard my man is cheatin' with
another bitch at my house... ?

1823
01:03:56,677 --> 01:03:58,812
What is that shit?

1824
01:03:58,814 --> 01:04:00,347
Stop it.

1825
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:02,182
Just cover me and go right.

1826
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:03,516
Well, then, say that.

1827
01:04:03,518 --> 01:04:05,986
Stop making me want
to shoot you.

1828
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:10,557
I don't know
what your problem is,

1829
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,460
but we told you...
stay out of the city.

1830
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:13,928
I don't know what it is.

1831
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,396
Are you, uh... you deaf?

1832
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:16,663
Shh.

1833
01:04:16,665 --> 01:04:18,665
Do you not, uh...
do you speak English?

1834
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:21,102
I got to do something
with you, man.

1835
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,203
Look, Julian.

1836
01:04:22,205 --> 01:04:23,671
I'm sorry.

1837
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:25,806
I'll sell for you guys,
whatever you want me to do.

1838
01:04:25,808 --> 01:04:27,441
I'm just trying to make
some extra money.

1839
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:30,011
Okay? You can't blame me
for that, right?

1840
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:31,812
Relax. I totally get it.

1841
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:33,114
Thank you, man.

1842
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:34,615
I'm not going to shoot you.

1843
01:04:34,617 --> 01:04:35,549
Okay.

1844
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:37,184
It's cool, man. Thanks.
 He is.

1845
01:04:37,186 --> 01:04:39,153
Wait, wait, hold on,
hold on, hold on!

1846
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:40,355
Shit.

1847
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:42,124
All right, if...
if we grab Julian,

1848
01:04:42,126 --> 01:04:43,425
I can get into his head

1849
01:04:43,427 --> 01:04:44,993
and we'll have Larkin
by tonight.

1850
01:04:44,995 --> 01:04:46,327
Two against two.
I like those odds.

1851
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:47,595
I'm going to call
for backup.

1852
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:50,365
It's already here.

1853
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:52,434
Oh, hey.
 Shit.

1854
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:53,602
I was looking for you.

1855
01:04:53,604 --> 01:04:55,203
Um, I forgot to get
your number.

1856
01:04:55,205 --> 01:04:56,638
Cool. Yeah.

1857
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,275
Uh, it's 1800
givemeyourfuckingguns.

1858
01:04:59,277 --> 01:05:00,777
That's... that's, uh...

1859
01:05:00,779 --> 01:05:03,145
that's... that's too many numbers.
 Okay.

1860
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,382
Met these disasters
at the club the other night.

1861
01:05:07,384 --> 01:05:09,385
Now they're both here.

1862
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:10,987
You think you might
have been bugged?

1863
01:05:10,989 --> 01:05:13,056
Give me a break.

1864
01:05:14,925 --> 01:05:16,491
What the fuck?

1865
01:05:20,931 --> 01:05:22,331
Think you're hot shit?

1866
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:23,466
Guess what?
You guys look

1867
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:24,934
even older in this lighting.

1868
01:05:24,936 --> 01:05:26,637
Come on.
 Fuck you.

1869
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:28,405
Fuck you!
It's not "fuck me. "

1870
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:30,074
It's "fuck you. "

1871
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:31,408
You know why?

1872
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,643
Because I'm about
to fuck you up.

1873
01:05:37,215 --> 01:05:39,183
Pick it up.

1874
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,484
Do it.

1875
01:05:40,486 --> 01:05:42,152
Give me a reason
to shoot you in the face.

1876
01:05:47,325 --> 01:05:48,692
How long is this going to take?

1877
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,327
I don't know.
Maybe 12 hours, hopefully less.

1878
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:52,062
I have... I have to find out
what drives him.

1879
01:05:52,064 --> 01:05:54,031
We could just go in there
and beat him with a phone book.

1880
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,201
No, no, no.
For so many reasons, no, okay?

1881
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:57,769
You just need to be patient,
all right?

1882
01:05:57,771 --> 01:06:00,038
It is crucial... crucial
that you remain patient.

1883
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,738
It's also crucial
that you stop wearing

1884
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,507
that stupid barrette.
 What are you doing? What...?

1885
01:06:03,509 --> 01:06:05,376
Don't... Just leave it.
 What is the problem with this?

1886
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,878
I mean, you have one
on your head.

1887
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,913
Yeah, on top of my head,
like a normal person.

1888
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:11,015
What is the difference?
 Just move on.

1889
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:12,484
Okay, if you enter that room,

1890
01:06:12,486 --> 01:06:14,520
you could break the bond
that we have created, okay?

1891
01:06:14,522 --> 01:06:17,322
Just please, please,
trust me on this one.

1892
01:06:17,324 --> 01:06:19,257
Okay, do you understand
how important this is?

1893
01:06:19,259 --> 01:06:21,593
Yeah, I do.

1894
01:06:21,595 --> 01:06:23,729
And you will be patient?

1895
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:25,264
I will.

1896
01:06:25,266 --> 01:06:27,733
Okay. All right.

1897
01:06:31,704 --> 01:06:33,038
Hello.

1898
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:35,407
Coffee?

1899
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:36,675
I drink a little more coffee

1900
01:06:36,677 --> 01:06:38,744
than I probably should.
I... Aah!

1901
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:39,545
Oh, my...

1902
01:06:39,547 --> 01:06:40,679
Where's Larkin?

1903
01:06:40,681 --> 01:06:42,149
You couldn't wait ten seconds?

1904
01:06:42,151 --> 01:06:44,084
Ten seconds?
 What's so funny?

1905
01:06:44,086 --> 01:06:46,486
You thinking you're
going to make me talk.

1906
01:06:46,488 --> 01:06:48,687
Yeah, you're talking
right now, dumbass.

1907
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:50,857
You know, you look like one
of the Campbell's soup kids

1908
01:06:50,859 --> 01:06:52,425
who grew up and
became an alcoholic.

1909
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:54,127
Oh, surprisingly catty.

1910
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:55,829
You're a fucking genius.

1911
01:06:55,831 --> 01:06:58,098
I asked you to stay outside.

1912
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,432
I need to go tough on him.

1913
01:06:59,434 --> 01:07:00,801
Oh, uh, are you not
already doing that?

1914
01:07:00,803 --> 01:07:02,302
No.
I'm doing good cop/bad cop.

1915
01:07:02,304 --> 01:07:03,770
You know,
I can hear you.

1916
01:07:03,772 --> 01:07:05,038
Shut up.

1917
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,577
Just, please,
don't do anything crazy.

1918
01:07:09,579 --> 01:07:11,445
I'm not going to do
anything crazy.

1919
01:07:11,447 --> 01:07:12,880
What am I going to do
that's crazy?

1920
01:07:12,882 --> 01:07:14,782
I'm a police officer.
Huh? I mean, what, am I

1921
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:16,717
going to shoot you in the dick?
 Oh, my God.

1922
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:19,687
You said nothing crazy,
and that is a nono.

1923
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:20,755
Nono!

1924
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:22,356
Turn around. I need you
to pass a polygraph.

1925
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:23,958
Put it away.
 Turn around.

1926
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,726
No!  Don't worry.
She's not going to do it.

1927
01:07:25,728 --> 01:07:26,928
She's not going
to do anything.

1928
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:28,297
Oh, okay, so you want
to just...

1929
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:29,598
you just want to go
and gamble

1930
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,666
with your scrotum
and your testicles?

1931
01:07:30,668 --> 01:07:31,933
Okay, gamble away.

1932
01:07:31,935 --> 01:07:34,035
Just go to the corner.
 I'm in it.

1933
01:07:34,037 --> 01:07:35,536
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

1934
01:07:35,538 --> 01:07:36,837
We're going to play
a little game.

1935
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:38,574
Okay? I'm going to
take out these bullets.

1936
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:41,276
Except for this one,
'cause this is my favorite.

1937
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:42,711
I'm going to keep that in there.

1938
01:07:42,713 --> 01:07:44,680
And then you're going to tell me
where Larkin is,

1939
01:07:44,682 --> 01:07:46,815
and you're going to tell me
where and when

1940
01:07:46,816 --> 01:07:49,084
that shipment
is coming in, okay?

1941
01:07:49,086 --> 01:07:51,520
Right now.

1942
01:07:51,522 --> 01:07:54,189
I'm going to kill you
and everyone you know.

1943
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:55,757
Aah! God, no.

1944
01:07:55,759 --> 01:07:57,827
Yeah, that's not what I
fucking asked you, is it?

1945
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:59,395
Hey, straight arrow, take the
gun out of this one's hand.

1946
01:07:59,397 --> 01:08:00,830
Oh, now you want me
to save your scrotum?

1947
01:08:00,832 --> 01:08:01,897
When is the shipment coming in?
 I don't know.

1948
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,366
Hey, hey, all right!

1949
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:05,534
ThThere's a shipment
on Wednesday.

1950
01:08:05,536 --> 01:08:07,170
Where?
 II don't know.

1951
01:08:07,172 --> 01:08:08,972
 I swear.
I swear to God, I don't know!

1952
01:08:08,974 --> 01:08:10,907
Tell her! Just tell her where it is!
 I swear to God!

1953
01:08:10,909 --> 01:08:13,009
I don't know! Jesus Christ,
don't shoot me in the dick!

1954
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:14,777
 I don't know!
It's going to be on Wednesday!

1955
01:08:14,779 --> 01:08:16,046
That's four shots!
Don't take any more shots!

1956
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:17,113
Don't shoot my dick off!

1957
01:08:17,115 --> 01:08:18,848
No! Just tell her
where it's coming in!

1958
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:20,516
Honest to God, I don't
know where the drop is!

1959
01:08:20,518 --> 01:08:21,684
Don't shoot me in the dick!

1960
01:08:21,686 --> 01:08:22,852
Hey! Enough! Stop it!
 Hey! Hey!

1961
01:08:22,854 --> 01:08:24,053
You brought Julian
and LeSoire in?

1962
01:08:24,055 --> 01:08:25,289
What are you, out of
your fucking minds?

1963
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:26,490
Wasn't too smart.

1964
01:08:26,492 --> 01:08:27,858
Oh, okay, so you're
not supposed

1965
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,059
to arrest someone
when they commit murder

1966
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,794
and then turn around
and try and kill you

1967
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:32,028
at the same time?
Yeah, you wanted us

1968
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:33,463
to keep them on the street?
 Yeah.

1969
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:35,599
You shouldn't even
have been there!

1970
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:37,334
Larkin is the big catch here,
not those two.

1971
01:08:37,336 --> 01:08:39,270
Now we're never going to be able
to bring these fucking guy...

1972
01:08:39,272 --> 01:08:41,472
Enough. Craig, calm the hell
down. We can all hear you.

1973
01:08:41,474 --> 01:08:42,840
Yeah, dogs can hear you.

1974
01:08:42,842 --> 01:08:44,542
Yeah, of course
dogs can hear me.

1975
01:08:44,544 --> 01:08:45,877
Yep.
 God, are you okay?

1976
01:08:45,879 --> 01:08:47,544
'Cause you...
you look really pale.

1977
01:08:47,546 --> 01:08:49,046
It's a genetic condition!

1978
01:08:49,048 --> 01:08:50,414
Ashburn, come here.

1979
01:08:50,416 --> 01:08:51,749
Fucking snow cone.

1980
01:08:51,751 --> 01:08:53,718
Oh, I get it.
That's a good one,

1981
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,054
'cause I'm really white.

1982
01:08:57,423 --> 01:08:59,824
Can I have a moment
with my agent, please?

1983
01:08:59,826 --> 01:09:02,028
I'm good.

1984
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:05,664
All right. I'm going to be
right over there.

1985
01:09:05,666 --> 01:09:07,899
Right there.

1986
01:09:07,901 --> 01:09:08,967
Thank you.

1987
01:09:08,969 --> 01:09:10,702
Ashburn, why didn't you
alert anyone

1988
01:09:10,704 --> 01:09:12,438
once you found evidence
on Julian's whereabouts?

1989
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,240
Sir, it was an unconfirmed lead.

1990
01:09:14,242 --> 01:09:17,043
I wasn't going to waste anyone's
time until I knew it was real.

1991
01:09:17,045 --> 01:09:18,176
Just give it a rest.

1992
01:09:18,178 --> 01:09:19,344
I want you to stand down

1993
01:09:19,346 --> 01:09:20,578
while I figure out
how to repair

1994
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,881
all this shit with the DEA.

1995
01:09:21,883 --> 01:09:23,516
Sir, no, please.
I... I swear, I've...

1996
01:09:23,518 --> 01:09:25,951
I've been doing everything
that you sent me out here to do.

1997
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,453
I... we've been doing
such good work.

1998
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,188
I know. I know you are.

1999
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,325
It's just...

2000
01:09:31,327 --> 01:09:32,825
I don't know, it's...

2001
01:09:32,827 --> 01:09:35,061
never easy
when you are involved.

2002
01:09:43,571 --> 01:09:45,539
Fuck that guy.
Yeah, yeah.

2003
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:48,040
Right? If you're not in trouble,
you're not doing your job.

2004
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,676
Yeah.

2005
01:09:49,678 --> 01:09:51,678
We should go get a drink.

2006
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,880
Right? What's the point
of being a cop if you can't

2007
01:09:53,882 --> 01:09:55,415
get one drink
at the end of the night?

2008
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,650
That's what I'm talking about.

2009
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:58,486
Oh, II said just...
I just want one.

2010
01:09:58,488 --> 01:09:59,654
Yeah, oh, no, no. Here.

2011
01:09:59,656 --> 01:10:01,022
It is one. It is one.

2012
01:10:01,024 --> 01:10:02,989
Sometimes he just...
he likes to do this thing,

2013
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:05,525
he pours them
in three little glasses,

2014
01:10:05,527 --> 01:10:07,294
but it's one.

2015
01:10:07,296 --> 01:10:09,097
All right. Here we go.

2016
01:10:09,099 --> 01:10:10,431
Fair enough.

2017
01:10:10,433 --> 01:10:11,966
Let's loosen that up.

2018
01:10:11,968 --> 01:10:13,801
Okeydokey.

2019
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,608
There you go.
There you go.

2020
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,210
Keep a pace.
Okay.

2021
01:10:22,212 --> 01:10:24,379
Don't spit that shit out.
It's not free.

2022
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:25,747
Let's go.

2023
01:10:25,749 --> 01:10:27,983
Keep that in.

2024
01:10:27,985 --> 01:10:28,884
Hey.
 Ooh.

2025
01:10:28,886 --> 01:10:30,552
Yeah.
 Hey. How you doing?

2026
01:10:30,554 --> 01:10:32,387
I haven't heard
from you.

2027
01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:34,555
Shit.

2028
01:10:34,557 --> 01:10:37,126
No. Yeah, you haven't.

2029
01:10:37,128 --> 01:10:39,461
Well, then, I mean, did I
do something wrong or...?

2030
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:44,433
Okay, here we go.

2031
01:10:44,435 --> 01:10:46,035
It's not you; it's me.

2032
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:49,037
Uh, I'm still working on myself,

2033
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:52,074
so I can't be a part of two
until I'm a better one.

2034
01:10:52,076 --> 01:10:53,742
Okay, don't.
You don't have to do that.

2035
01:10:53,744 --> 01:10:55,044
Uh, wait, I still...
my favorite's coming.

2036
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:58,848
Oh. You make me want
to be a better woman.

2037
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,583
Okay, you know what?
I thought we had a good time.

2038
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:02,785
Yeah, I... we did have
a lot of fun.

2039
01:11:02,787 --> 01:11:05,455
And now we're
going to move on.

2040
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:07,557
Let it go.
 Okay.

2041
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:09,759
All right. Cool.
 All right.

2042
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:12,061
Hey. Hey, no hard feelings,
all right?

2043
01:11:12,063 --> 01:11:13,397
Oh...

2044
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:18,535
Okay.

2045
01:11:21,338 --> 01:11:22,572
Okay, hit it.

2046
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:25,009
Hit it.
 Okay. Okay.

2047
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:27,711
Bye.
 Bye. That's good.

2048
01:11:27,713 --> 01:11:29,613
I don't know how
else to say it.

2049
01:11:29,615 --> 01:11:31,248
It's pretty clear.
 Yeah.

2050
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,617
That's why you don't...
you don't feed strays.

2051
01:11:33,619 --> 01:11:34,618
Yeah.

2052
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,454
Can we get two more?

2053
01:11:36,456 --> 01:11:38,222
Shots?

2054
01:11:38,224 --> 01:11:39,924
Six.

2055
01:11:41,193 --> 01:11:44,596
We should just get
one more of these, right?

2056
01:11:45,966 --> 01:11:47,765
I don't know, Mullins.

2057
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:49,200
It's hard.

2058
01:11:49,202 --> 01:11:51,002
I know we're not
supposed to say this,

2059
01:11:51,004 --> 01:11:52,704
but being a woman
in this field is hard.

2060
01:11:52,706 --> 01:11:54,172
Well...

2061
01:11:54,174 --> 01:11:58,009
Men are just so intimidated
by me, which is, like, why?

2062
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:01,280
And then you put your
personality on top of that,

2063
01:12:01,282 --> 01:12:02,714
and it is...
 Mmhmm.

2064
01:12:02,716 --> 01:12:04,149
...it is offputting.

2065
01:12:04,151 --> 01:12:06,384
You know, I was, uh...
I was actually married for...

2066
01:12:06,386 --> 01:12:07,786
for six some years... same guy.

2067
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:09,755
Was he a hearing man?
 Yes.

2068
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:11,858
Yeah, he didn't, uh...
he didn't understand

2069
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,060
how much the job meant to me,
so I thought it'd

2070
01:12:14,062 --> 01:12:15,895
probably be best
to just be alone

2071
01:12:15,897 --> 01:12:18,063
rather than to, you know,
compromise the work.

2072
01:12:18,065 --> 01:12:20,233
I get that.
 Yeah. Yeah.

2073
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:23,603
It's kind of weird that it does
get lonely a little bit.

2074
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,071
You know, and it's...

2075
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:26,672
it's hard to make
female friends.

2076
01:12:26,674 --> 01:12:27,907
Yeah.

2077
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:29,710
I hung out, you know...

2078
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,979
really just with my...
my brothers and stuff

2079
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,579
growing up, and...
 Yeah.

2080
01:12:33,581 --> 01:12:36,582
they just kind of all turned out
to be terrible people.

2081
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:38,085
So that's kind of a bummer.

2082
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,454
Your f... your family loves you.

2083
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,855
I mean, in their own

2084
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,790
unique... unique way,
but they... you know,

2085
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,225
theythey love you,
and that's a wonderful...

2086
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:46,293
Very unique.

2087
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,961
That sounds like
it's coming from...

2088
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,162
somebody
that's an only child.

2089
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,564
No, I...

2090
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:53,100
I was actually raised with
a lot of children, so I had...

2091
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,536
With the children?
What, in a circus?

2092
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,672
Uh, no, just in...
in the houses.

2093
01:12:57,674 --> 01:13:00,642
Oh, my God.

2094
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:03,176
You're a foster kid.

2095
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,012
Yes, I was.

2096
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:06,614
Oh, my God.
 Yes.

2097
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,783
No...  Jesus, that
clears up a lot.

2098
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,451
Foster... foster kid.
That makes sense.

2099
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:11,719
That's a tough go of it.

2100
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,088
No, it was totally fine.

2101
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,724
There was a lot
of benefits

2102
01:13:15,726 --> 01:13:18,026
toto being a foster kid.

2103
01:13:18,028 --> 01:13:19,894
Yeah?
 Yeah, oh, yeah. You had...

2104
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,564
on Christmases, there was
thisthis local drug store

2105
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:24,499
it would sponsor...
sponsor us

2106
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:28,737
and give us little baggies of,
you know, toiletries, and stuff.

2107
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,172
On Thanksgiving...
 Oh, shit.

2108
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:32,608
we would... we would hit
these different

2109
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,976
puttputt golf courses.

2110
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:36,145
It was, you know,
you'd meet all kinds of

2111
01:13:36,147 --> 01:13:37,346
other kids.
 Other sad kids?

2112
01:13:37,348 --> 01:13:39,481
Yeah, no. No, no, no.
 Oh, Jesus.

2113
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:44,254
That is the saddest series
of images I've ever heard.

2114
01:13:44,256 --> 01:13:46,022
No, I don't think it
affected me...

2115
01:13:46,024 --> 01:13:48,591
I mean, in the long run,
at all; at all.

2116
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:50,326
You're probably fine.
 You know, I can see how maybe

2117
01:13:50,328 --> 01:13:51,894
it was, you know,
like, a little bit,

2118
01:13:51,896 --> 01:13:54,497
but not anything that's...
 A little bit.

2119
01:13:54,499 --> 01:13:55,665
Maybe it has?
 Maybe it has.

2120
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:56,833
May...? Oh, God.

2121
01:13:56,835 --> 01:13:58,201
Oh, God, my life.
 Yeah. Okay.

2122
01:13:58,203 --> 01:13:59,569
Ugh. Oh, God.

2123
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:02,005
All right. Yep.

2124
01:14:02,007 --> 01:14:03,607
All right. Let it out.

2125
01:14:03,609 --> 01:14:05,208
That's it.
 Oh, God.

2126
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,010
Good for you to start
working through it.

2127
01:14:07,012 --> 01:14:08,445
I don't feel well.

2128
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:10,180
Oh, Jesus.
 I don't feel well. I don't...

2129
01:14:10,182 --> 01:14:12,049
I... Wow.  Well, you're
not making me feel great.

2130
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:13,517
All right.
 Get it, get it.

2131
01:14:13,519 --> 01:14:14,952
Blow it out.

2132
01:14:14,954 --> 01:14:16,621
Really let it go.

2133
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:18,755
You've got more than that.
You've got more than...

2134
01:14:18,757 --> 01:14:20,290
Oh!

2135
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:21,225
Good job. Hey.

2136
01:14:21,227 --> 01:14:22,727
Oh, God, I don't feel well.

2137
01:14:22,729 --> 01:14:24,095
Good job.
Do you want some J√£ger?

2138
01:14:24,097 --> 01:14:25,630
Oh, God.
Oh, God, I feel sick.

2139
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:26,664
Can we have two J√£gers?

2140
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:29,934
Let's hear it!

2141
01:14:29,936 --> 01:14:32,371
? Dig

2142
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:34,171
This is for you.

2143
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,775
? The chills that you spill
up my back ?

2144
01:14:37,777 --> 01:14:40,846
? Keep me filled with satisfaction when
we're done ?  Oh, yeah, pump it.

2145
01:14:40,848 --> 01:14:43,582
? Satisfaction of what's to come
 Pump it, and pump it, and pull it.

2146
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:45,651
Sex walk.

2147
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:46,985
? I couldn't ask for another

2148
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:48,987
Look at it,
look at it, look at it!

2149
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:51,456
Look at it.
 Giving it to you, and...

2150
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,325
? Your groove, I do deeply dig
 Higher.

2151
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:55,460
? No walls, only the bridge

2152
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:57,496
? My supper dish,
my succotash wish ?

2153
01:14:57,498 --> 01:14:59,198
"My name...

2154
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,067
? I couldn't ask for another
 "... is Detective Mullins.

2155
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:03,802
You'd better lay
your ass down. "

2156
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:05,671
I smell bacon. I smell bacon.

2157
01:15:05,673 --> 01:15:07,072
I smell bacon.

2158
01:15:07,074 --> 01:15:09,942
? No, I couldn't ask
for another ?

2159
01:15:09,944 --> 01:15:11,210
Ooh, ooh.

2160
01:15:11,212 --> 01:15:13,846
? Groove is in the heart

2161
01:15:13,848 --> 01:15:16,149
Biscuits are done.

2162
01:15:16,151 --> 01:15:17,718
? Groove is in the heart

2163
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:24,090
Big finish. Big finish.

2164
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:27,494
Yes!

2165
01:15:27,496 --> 01:15:30,330
Yeah!  Let's do it again.
Let's do it again.

2166
01:15:30,332 --> 01:15:31,699
No!

2167
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:34,100
Stop playing this song.
 Why?

2168
01:15:34,102 --> 01:15:37,104
Because you played it
26 fucking times.  Hey!

2169
01:15:37,106 --> 01:15:39,206
She's a foster kid.
 Yeah.

2170
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:41,208
She got, like, Q  tips and...

2171
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:43,143
tampons and shit
for Christmas.

2172
01:15:43,145 --> 01:15:44,344
Yeah.
 She's had a horrible,

2173
01:15:44,346 --> 01:15:46,715
Yeah. Yeah!
 fucking, miserable life.

2174
01:15:46,717 --> 01:15:48,182
Look at her!
 Yeah!

2175
01:15:48,184 --> 01:15:51,051
All right.
Play the goddamn song.

2176
01:15:51,053 --> 01:15:52,553
Don't you fucking swear at us.
 Ooh...

2177
01:15:52,555 --> 01:15:53,787
Oh, are we going to...
 Yes.

2178
01:15:53,789 --> 01:15:55,457
You celebrate your music.
 Okay. Okay.

2179
01:15:58,462 --> 01:15:59,394
Everybody, get up.

2180
01:15:59,396 --> 01:16:01,529
Come dance! Come on!

2181
01:16:01,531 --> 01:16:03,664
Get up, you fuck!

2182
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:06,401
Whoo! Get on.

2183
01:16:06,403 --> 01:16:09,270
Look, it's a frenzy.
We started a frenzy.

2184
01:16:09,272 --> 01:16:10,939
You're covered in nuts.

2185
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,074
You're having a bad dream.

2186
01:16:13,076 --> 01:16:15,044
You're covered in nuts.

2187
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:16,679
? Groove is in the heart

2188
01:16:16,681 --> 01:16:18,713
Uhuh.

2189
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:20,348
? Groove is in the heart...

2190
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,383
What happened? Huh?
 Let's give them...

2191
01:16:22,385 --> 01:16:24,186
let's give them
a little something...

2192
01:16:24,188 --> 01:16:26,155
Hold... God, hold still.

2193
01:16:26,157 --> 01:16:31,427
? Spin me around
till I fell asleep ?

2194
01:16:31,429 --> 01:16:36,098
? Then up the stairs
he would carry me. ?

2195
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:40,527
? Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me ?

2196
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:44,708
I love this place.
I love this place.

2197
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:45,776
Yeah. Yeah.

2198
01:16:45,778 --> 01:16:47,544
Hey, to this...
to this place.

2199
01:16:47,546 --> 01:16:49,211
To this place.

2200
01:16:49,213 --> 01:16:52,215
? Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me ?

2201
01:16:54,453 --> 01:16:56,686
? You're my fantasy

2202
01:16:56,688 --> 01:16:58,021
? You're my reality
 II don't feel it.

2203
01:16:58,023 --> 01:16:59,022
I don't feel it.

2204
01:16:59,024 --> 01:17:00,658
Keep it up.

2205
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:04,728
? Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me ?

2206
01:17:05,963 --> 01:17:08,098
? You're everything I need

2207
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,602
? You're everything to me...

2208
01:17:11,604 --> 01:17:14,372
Oh, crap.

2209
01:17:18,576 --> 01:17:20,878
Oh, f...

2210
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,847
Hey. Hey.

2211
01:17:22,849 --> 01:17:24,682
How long have we been here?

2212
01:17:24,684 --> 01:17:25,950
Hey.

2213
01:17:25,952 --> 01:17:27,385
Hey. Hey.

2214
01:17:27,387 --> 01:17:28,921
Oh, crap.

2215
01:17:28,923 --> 01:17:31,423
Okay, focus.

2216
01:17:40,801 --> 01:17:42,601
Uh, you know what?

2217
01:17:42,603 --> 01:17:43,936
Here's this.

2218
01:17:43,938 --> 01:17:45,704
This counts as something.

2219
01:17:45,706 --> 01:17:47,240
That's it.

2220
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:49,508
I'm all in.

2221
01:17:52,378 --> 01:17:53,812
Hey, how's it going?

2222
01:17:53,814 --> 01:17:56,716
Jesus, you've got to get
a mint in that Dumpster.

2223
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:58,117
Oh, God.

2224
01:17:58,119 --> 01:17:59,953
Was I smoking cigarettes
last night?

2225
01:17:59,955 --> 01:18:01,287
Yeah, you kept
taking them out

2226
01:18:01,289 --> 01:18:02,822
of people's mouths
and smoking them.

2227
01:18:02,824 --> 01:18:04,389
Oh, God, that's so nasty.

2228
01:18:04,391 --> 01:18:06,392
It was pretty gross.
 Why is my jacket in the pot?

2229
01:18:06,394 --> 01:18:08,428
Oh, yeah, don't worry about it.
I'll get it right back.

2230
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:10,763
All right,
let's see what you got.

2231
01:18:13,434 --> 01:18:14,434
Oh, shit.

2232
01:18:14,436 --> 01:18:16,270
That's great.
 Good evening.

2233
01:18:16,272 --> 01:18:17,838
That's great.

2234
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,172
There you go.

2235
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:20,540
I didn't think you were

2236
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:22,342
going to care that much
about your jacket.

2237
01:18:22,344 --> 01:18:24,344
You didn't care at all
when you gave away your car.

2238
01:18:24,346 --> 01:18:25,412
Who did I give it to?

2239
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:26,647
To Wayne.
 Who's Wayne?

2240
01:18:26,649 --> 01:18:28,182
Wayne.
He just walked out of here.

2241
01:18:28,184 --> 01:18:29,984
You were sitting
on his lap all night.

2242
01:18:29,986 --> 01:18:31,585
You had your tongue
down his throat.

2243
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:32,753
What?!

2244
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:39,260
Oh, God.

2245
01:18:39,262 --> 01:18:40,961
Feels like we've been
hibernating.

2246
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:42,429
Didn't bother you
last night.

2247
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,698
Oh, Jesus,
ten missed messages.

2248
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,700
Will you just...
will you get him, please?

2249
01:18:45,702 --> 01:18:47,335
Hey, Wayne! Ashburn wants
her underwear back!

2250
01:18:47,337 --> 01:18:48,936
I do not!

2251
01:18:48,938 --> 01:18:50,437
You cannot take that car.

2252
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:51,839
It's government property.

2253
01:18:51,841 --> 01:18:53,141
Oh, yeah?

2254
01:18:53,143 --> 01:18:55,610
Well, I pay taxes,
so fuck the government!

2255
01:18:55,612 --> 01:18:56,745
Let's not, okay?

2256
01:18:56,747 --> 01:18:58,680
Wayne, get out of
the car, you asshole.

2257
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:01,616
Oh, God.

2258
01:19:08,658 --> 01:19:09,824
Oh, my God.

2259
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:11,059
Oh, shit, Wayne.

2260
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:12,361
Oh, my God.

2261
01:19:12,363 --> 01:19:14,063
God, your first boyfriend.

2262
01:19:14,065 --> 01:19:16,799
You two were electric.

2263
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:18,367
How did Julian escape?

2264
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:21,003
Federal marshals transferring
him got ambushed.

2265
01:19:21,005 --> 01:19:23,773
We're not sure whether Larkin's
men followed the marshals

2266
01:19:23,775 --> 01:19:25,908
or if they got information
from the inside.

2267
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:27,143
Yeah, you don't think
it's a little obvious?

2268
01:19:27,145 --> 01:19:28,377
Oh, fuck you!

2269
01:19:28,379 --> 01:19:29,845
I know when I smell
a fucking albino rat.

2270
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:31,481
If you want to be pointing
a finger around here,

2271
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:32,582
why don't you point it
right back at yourself?!

2272
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:34,083
All right, yeah.
 No, because if

2273
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:35,685
you two hadn't
brought Julian in,

2274
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:38,287
then Larkin would've never even
known that we were onto him.

2275
01:19:38,289 --> 01:19:39,756
And then this whole case
wouldn't be

2276
01:19:39,758 --> 01:19:42,326
the giant mixedup bucket
of shit that it is right now.

2277
01:19:42,328 --> 01:19:44,594
So fuck you
and your albino prejudice!

2278
01:19:44,596 --> 01:19:47,164
Now Larkin knows who you are,
and Julian's angry as shit.

2279
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:49,366
If I were you, I would
get out of town.

2280
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:50,901
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

2281
01:19:50,903 --> 01:19:52,903
Ashburn, he's right.

2282
01:19:52,905 --> 01:19:54,104
This isn't a choice.

2283
01:19:54,106 --> 01:19:55,639
No! No way!

2284
01:19:55,641 --> 01:19:57,541
You're not my boss,
Puss in Boots.

2285
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,078
And even if you were my boss,
you still couldn't stop me.

2286
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,047
I have more invested in this
case than any of you assholes.

2287
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:05,315
And now you fucked it up, didn't you?
 Mullins.

2288
01:20:05,317 --> 01:20:06,783
Yep, thanks.

2289
01:20:06,785 --> 01:20:07,986
That's another
fuckedup area of my life.

2290
01:20:07,988 --> 01:20:09,187
Thanks for bringing it up.

2291
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:10,788
No, this was
just emailed to me.

2292
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,596
Okay, fine.
I guess I'm out of line, huh?

2293
01:20:17,598 --> 01:20:20,565
Yeah, I'm gonna step back and
see what you assholes can do.

2294
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:22,066
Yeah, go USA. Let's go.

2295
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:23,534
We got to get my
family out of there.

2296
01:20:23,536 --> 01:20:24,669
They're gonna kill them.

2297
01:20:24,671 --> 01:20:25,937
You know, let me
just talk to Hale.

2298
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:27,506
The FBI can
arrange everything.

2299
01:20:27,508 --> 01:20:29,441
No! Are you kidding? We got
a mole in there somewhere.

2300
01:20:29,443 --> 01:20:30,809
And I'm assuming it's
the fucking albino,

2301
01:20:30,811 --> 01:20:32,378
but we don't know.
Could be Levy.

2302
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,812
It could be somebody
from my own precinct.

2303
01:20:33,814 --> 01:20:35,613
It could be your boss,
Puss in Boots.

2304
01:20:35,615 --> 01:20:38,283
We are going in there by
ourselves and doing it now.

2305
01:20:38,285 --> 01:20:40,452
Are you with me or not?

2306
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:45,358
Okay, okay.

2307
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,093
This is bullshit.

2308
01:20:47,095 --> 01:20:49,294
Why should we uproot our lives
'cause you're an asshole?

2309
01:20:49,296 --> 01:20:50,529
Go.
 Hey, don't talk to her like that.

2310
01:20:50,531 --> 01:20:51,864
It's not her fault.

2311
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:53,832
Are you sure you want
to bring everyone?

2312
01:20:53,834 --> 01:20:55,602
<i>No, but it'd be like
Schindler's List. Dad! Come on!</i>

2313
01:20:55,604 --> 01:20:56,903
We cannot
fit that in the car!

2314
01:20:56,905 --> 01:20:59,072
I don't want them to take
my treasures.  Jesus.

2315
01:20:59,074 --> 01:21:00,607
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
 I'm hoping, I'm hoping it's Vegas.

2316
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:02,042
I thought you were outside.
Say byebye.

2317
01:21:02,044 --> 01:21:03,810
'Cause I'll get my boobs
done if we go there.

2318
01:21:03,812 --> 01:21:05,245
Say byebye. Say byebye.
Say byebye.  No, no, no, no.

2319
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:06,613
I'll call you when
I get there.  Ow.

2320
01:21:06,615 --> 01:21:07,914
You are so rude.
 I know. I'm so sorry.

2321
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,182
This is my house.
 Can you just go outside.

2322
01:21:09,184 --> 01:21:10,250
No, where are you going?
Outside.

2323
01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:11,451
I'll be right there.
 Outside.

2324
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:12,752
Holy shit, I can see through
your shirt.

2325
01:21:12,754 --> 01:21:14,021
Oh, God, are you serious?
Oh, my God.

2326
01:21:14,023 --> 01:21:15,823
What are you doing
with the bat?

2327
01:21:15,825 --> 01:21:18,092
Just let 'em try to come over
here, Shan. Just let 'em try.

2328
01:21:18,094 --> 01:21:20,593
They're not going to throw softballs at
you... they're going to shoot you, moron.

2329
01:21:20,595 --> 01:21:23,330
Get your bag.  Oh, would you
get over yourself, for Christ sake.

2330
01:21:23,332 --> 01:21:25,299
Bring it on, motherfuckers!

2331
01:21:25,301 --> 01:21:27,001
Not you, Mrs. Amendola.

2332
01:21:27,903 --> 01:21:28,969
Hi. Can I drive?
 Hi.

2333
01:21:28,971 --> 01:21:30,604
No, but if you could
make your way around...

2334
01:21:30,606 --> 01:21:32,274
Why don't you get
out and I'll drive.

2335
01:21:32,276 --> 01:21:33,742
But if you could make your...
 I'm a really good driver.

2336
01:21:33,744 --> 01:21:34,542
Mullins!

2337
01:21:34,544 --> 01:21:35,676
Your mom, your mom.

2338
01:21:35,678 --> 01:21:37,411
Our lives are in danger.
 Ma! Ma!

2339
01:21:37,413 --> 01:21:38,679
I may have to change my name.
 Hey, come on.

2340
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:40,614
What are you doing?
 So if you get a call

2341
01:21:40,616 --> 01:21:42,717
from someone named Carla, it's me.
 Stop! God Almighty!

2342
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,320
When did you become
such a fucking princess?

2343
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:46,688
You make it impossible.
 You hear this?

2344
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,756
All right, seat
belts, everyone.

2345
01:21:47,758 --> 01:21:49,323
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

2346
01:21:49,325 --> 01:21:50,524
Right in here, buddy.
 No, no. Highly allergic.

2347
01:21:50,526 --> 01:21:52,260
What the fuck is this?!
 Highly allergic.

2348
01:21:52,262 --> 01:21:53,695
That's my puppy. I got him four months ago.
 Highly allergic.

2349
01:21:53,697 --> 01:21:55,564
I named him Kevin Garnett.
 No. No.

2350
01:21:55,566 --> 01:21:57,065
You're an asshole.
 You got to see the cock on this thing.

2351
01:21:57,067 --> 01:21:58,066
We're going to a motel.

2352
01:21:58,068 --> 01:21:59,634
We're not bring... Move.

2353
01:21:59,636 --> 01:22:02,238
We're not bringing this
fucking horse to a motel.

2354
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,973
We got to get Gina.
 For what?

2355
01:22:03,975 --> 01:22:06,308
Because you put
her fucking life in danger!

2356
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:07,476
Nobody gives a
shit about her.

2357
01:22:07,478 --> 01:22:09,177
If I'm going, Gina's going.

2358
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:10,780
Get in there.
 I'm not going unless we get Gina.

2359
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:12,181
Just get in.
 We're getting Gina.

2360
01:22:12,183 --> 01:22:13,516
Move your feet!
I'll chop them off.

2361
01:22:13,518 --> 01:22:14,584
Thank you.
 Shut up!

2362
01:22:14,586 --> 01:22:15,852
We're going to Gina's!

2363
01:22:15,854 --> 01:22:17,720
Everyone put your seat belt on.

2364
01:22:17,722 --> 01:22:19,755
<i>God, I hope a truck hits us
and we all die.</i>

2365
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,292
Oh, God.

2366
01:22:23,294 --> 01:22:24,927
What the fuck
is this girl doing?

2367
01:22:27,998 --> 01:22:29,032
Could she go any slower?

2368
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:30,334
Could she physically
go slower?

2369
01:22:30,336 --> 01:22:31,568
Go get your girlfriend,

2370
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:32,569
for God's sake.
 Um, okay, please.

2371
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:33,904
She's fine, Ma!

2372
01:22:33,906 --> 01:22:36,139
I forgot my curling iron,
Mrs. Mullins!

2373
01:22:36,141 --> 01:22:37,340
Come on, Gina!

2374
01:22:37,342 --> 01:22:38,375
Get in the car!

2375
01:22:38,377 --> 01:22:39,676
What the fuck?

2376
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:41,278
I got you the rollie
so you could roll the bag,

2377
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,479
so get over here!

2378
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:44,014
You kidding?
You bought me a bag

2379
01:22:44,016 --> 01:22:46,483
for Christmas so that I could
carry my own luggage?

2380
01:22:46,485 --> 01:22:48,153
Gina, come on.
Let's go.

2381
01:22:48,155 --> 01:22:49,853
I'm gonna get you
a dicksucker for Christmas,

2382
01:22:49,855 --> 01:22:51,221
so I don't have to do it
no more.

2383
01:22:51,223 --> 01:22:52,222
Go get her!
 I'mI'm going!

2384
01:22:52,224 --> 01:22:53,524
Jesus Christ!
 Gina!

2385
01:22:53,526 --> 01:22:54,525
You really...
you didn't say that.

2386
01:22:54,527 --> 01:22:55,659
Oh, that got
your attention.

2387
01:22:55,661 --> 01:22:56,961
Go on, go get her.
 Come on, Pete,

2388
01:22:56,963 --> 01:22:58,696
just break up with this girl,
for fuck sakes.

2389
01:22:58,698 --> 01:23:00,098
This'll help.
 Come on, you're making a scene!

2390
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,232
Let's go, let's go!

2391
01:23:01,234 --> 01:23:02,634
Let's go, you assholes. Okay?

2392
01:23:02,636 --> 01:23:03,835
Let's go, Mark!
 You think you're man enough?

2393
01:23:03,837 --> 01:23:05,202
Come on!
 You fucking man enough?

2394
01:23:05,204 --> 01:23:06,437
Knock it off!

2395
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:08,339
Just knock it off!

2396
01:23:08,341 --> 01:23:09,774
I got this, I got this!
 Come on.

2397
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,943
Hey, assholes!
 Get in the car.

2398
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,378
You animals!
 Whoa!

2399
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,679
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

2400
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:16,182
Did she just pull out a gun?

2401
01:23:16,184 --> 01:23:17,550
You know what happens now?!

2402
01:23:17,552 --> 01:23:19,484
You don't get this one!
 No.

2403
01:23:19,486 --> 01:23:22,487
So, uh, Jason, your
family seemsseems nice.

2404
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:25,291
Yeah, we, uh, we have
our good days.

2405
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:27,159
But my makeup is in that one!

2406
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:28,727
I'll rip
your fucking pants off!

2407
01:23:38,838 --> 01:23:40,639
<i>If we just knew
where that shipment was</i>

2408
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:42,007
coming into, we would have,

2409
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:43,743
we would have Larkin and
we would have Julian,

2410
01:23:43,745 --> 01:23:45,412
they would both be there,
and we could get them.

2411
01:23:45,414 --> 01:23:48,715
I'm just happy that Jason, you
know, is out of there for now.

2412
01:23:48,717 --> 01:23:50,082
Yeah.

2413
01:23:50,084 --> 01:23:51,617
It's a shame, though.

2414
01:23:51,619 --> 01:23:52,886
Having your brother
on the inside

2415
01:23:52,888 --> 01:23:54,287
would be a, would
be a coup for us.

2416
01:23:54,289 --> 01:23:55,689
That's what you want to say?

2417
01:23:55,691 --> 01:23:56,723
'Cause you're saying that
out loud.

2418
01:23:56,725 --> 01:23:58,458
Okay, you know what, Mullins?

2419
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,393
You would say exactly the same
thing if it wasn't your brother.

2420
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:01,695
We're done talking about this.

2421
01:24:01,697 --> 01:24:02,830
So, if it was just
some random drug dealer,

2422
01:24:02,832 --> 01:24:04,098
you wouldn't send him back in?

2423
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,365
If it was
someone like,

2424
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:07,033
I don't know, Rojas,
you wouldn't...

2425
01:24:07,035 --> 01:24:08,868
We're not talking
about Rojas, are we?  Okay.

2426
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:10,604
We're talking about Jason,
my brother, you fuckwit.

2427
01:24:10,606 --> 01:24:12,006
Okay, you know what?
We all have

2428
01:24:12,008 --> 01:24:13,708
a lot to lose
if we don't catch Larkin.

2429
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,775
Yeah, what do you have to lose?

2430
01:24:14,777 --> 01:24:16,110
I have a lot.
 Yeah?

2431
01:24:16,112 --> 01:24:17,511
Some bullshit promotion?

2432
01:24:17,513 --> 01:24:19,580
You don't give a shit
about my family

2433
01:24:19,582 --> 01:24:21,616
or if Jason gets out there
and gets killed.

2434
01:24:21,618 --> 01:24:22,917
I feel that you're not
being honest.

2435
01:24:22,919 --> 01:24:24,452
Because nobody,
nobody forced your brother

2436
01:24:24,454 --> 01:24:25,586
to get involved with drugs.

2437
01:24:25,588 --> 01:24:27,054
You're an asshole for that.

2438
01:24:27,056 --> 01:24:29,056
Okay, you know what?
That's not helping either.

2439
01:24:29,058 --> 01:24:30,826
See, I'm trying to
create a dialogue.

2440
01:24:30,828 --> 01:24:33,528
Note that I am starting my
statements with "I feel. "

2441
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:35,263
I feel...
 Oh, I feel like you're an asshole.

2442
01:24:35,265 --> 01:24:36,464
You know what I feel?

2443
01:24:36,466 --> 01:24:38,099
I feel that you have
worn that shirt

2444
01:24:38,101 --> 01:24:40,636
every single day this week,
and I feel that you turning it

2445
01:24:40,638 --> 01:24:42,471
inside out does not
make it a new shirt.

2446
01:24:42,473 --> 01:24:43,872
Well, I feel like it does.

2447
01:24:43,874 --> 01:24:46,308
Oh, really? Okay, well,
I feel I disagree.

2448
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,442
Must be nice.

2449
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:48,810
What? What?
 Must be really nice

2450
01:24:48,812 --> 01:24:50,178
for you to just know everything.

2451
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,880
To be so much smarter
than everybody else.

2452
01:24:51,882 --> 01:24:53,548
I... I don't profess
to know everything,

2453
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,183
but I do know quite a bit.

2454
01:24:55,185 --> 01:24:57,452
And what I know is accurate
and scientifically proven,

2455
01:24:57,454 --> 01:24:58,755
and I just share
that information with you.

2456
01:24:58,757 --> 01:24:59,956
If you have a problem with that,

2457
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:01,291
tune me out
like you always do.

2458
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,227
Help! He's choking!

2459
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:05,861
Okay, I've got it, I've got it.
 He's choking, help!

2460
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:07,296
Sir.
 Somebody call an ambulance!

2461
01:25:07,298 --> 01:25:08,931
Okay, I got it. I got it.
 Call...

2462
01:25:09,968 --> 01:25:11,401
Check his mouth,
check his mouth!

2463
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:12,602
Nothing in there!
 Okay, all right.

2464
01:25:12,604 --> 01:25:14,771
Let's lay him down.
Sir, just relax.

2465
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:16,172
Everything will be just fine.
Let me get his head back.

2466
01:25:16,174 --> 01:25:17,508
Okay?
 Yeah, okay.

2467
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:18,842
He's choking.
 You're gonna be okay.

2468
01:25:18,844 --> 01:25:19,942
I need a, I need a knife
and a straw please!

2469
01:25:19,944 --> 01:25:21,077
I need a knife
and a straw please!

2470
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:22,645
Why do you need
a knife and a straw?

2471
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:23,713
Why?
 I need them 'cause I'm gonna

2472
01:25:23,715 --> 01:25:25,148
perform an emergency
tracheotomy.

2473
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:26,349
What?!
 I'm gonna need a glass of vodka.

2474
01:25:26,351 --> 01:25:27,785
Vodka! It's a Denny's!

2475
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:29,353
Uh, for sterilization...
hot water.

2476
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:31,021
Do you know what you're doing?
Have you done this before?

2477
01:25:31,023 --> 01:25:32,489
Technically, technically,
no, but I've been,

2478
01:25:32,491 --> 01:25:33,924
I've been doing some
research, and I feel

2479
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:35,792
fairly confident I know how.
 Fairly confident?

2480
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:37,428
Jesus! He's still choking,
you know. It isn't time to stop.

2481
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,229
Okay, sir, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna find your...

2482
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:40,864
Oh, God, don't, please don't
put that in there.  Shh.

2483
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:42,032
Stop touching me... so, the
cricothyroid membrane...

2484
01:25:42,034 --> 01:25:44,001
I think, I think
it's right here.

2485
01:25:44,003 --> 01:25:45,737
I'm gonna make a small incision.
 Please don't do that.

2486
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:47,472
Let go of my hand, let go of
my hand, let go of my hand.

2487
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:48,773
I'm gonna make
a small incision.

2488
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:49,973
The reason I'm
doing this... Oh!

2489
01:25:49,975 --> 01:25:51,008
Oh, God.

2490
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:52,676
...is because
you're choking.

2491
01:25:52,678 --> 01:25:53,877
I'm gonna cut in...

2492
01:25:53,879 --> 01:25:55,313
Wow, okay,
just a little bigger.

2493
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:57,582
Wow, okay, that goes in
deeper than I thought.

2494
01:25:57,584 --> 01:25:59,017
I'm gonna insert my fingers in
here because what's happening is...

2495
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:01,152
Don't put your
finger in there.

2496
01:26:01,154 --> 01:26:03,021
Don't put your finger in there.
 Wow, that feels a lot different.

2497
01:26:03,023 --> 01:26:04,323
There's the membrane, okay?

2498
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,390
It's a fucking horror show!

2499
01:26:05,392 --> 01:26:07,025
Don't put your fingers
in there!

2500
01:26:07,027 --> 01:26:08,927
Sir, what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to insert

2501
01:26:08,929 --> 01:26:10,428
the straw in the hole.

2502
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:12,964
And it's gonna allow the
oxygen to get to your brain.

2503
01:26:12,966 --> 01:26:14,667
Now if you give
it one moment,

2504
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:16,001
you're gonna feel the oxygen
flow into your brain.

2505
01:26:16,003 --> 01:26:17,970
There we go.
 That's not oxygen!

2506
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,038
Jesus Christ, that's not oxygen!
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2507
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,606
That's a lot of blood.
 What are you doing to him?

2508
01:26:21,608 --> 01:26:22,908
Oh, my God, ah!
 Oh, Jesus!

2509
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:24,410
Oh, my God, there's
so much blood!

2510
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:25,611
I don't know
what I'm doing!

2511
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,179
Stop crying! You did this!

2512
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:28,948
Is the ambulance coming?!
 You're fucking killing him!

2513
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,449
I'm so sorry!
 I got it, I got it, I got it, move!

2514
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,450
I'm so sorry!
What are you doing?

2515
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:34,554
So much blood!

2516
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:35,988
You asshole!
 Oh, my God!

2517
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,289
You probably could have just

2518
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:39,024
pulled the piece of pancake
out of his throat.

2519
01:26:39,026 --> 01:26:40,426
He's alive, isn't he?

2520
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:42,829
You know what? I have a cut
on my arm from earlier.

2521
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,264
Do you think
I should amputate it?

2522
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:45,565
You know you're not
a real doctor, right?

2523
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:46,566
Yeah, neither are you.

2524
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:47,901
Okay.

2525
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:49,336
Yeah, byebye.
 You're a reckless person.

2526
01:26:49,338 --> 01:26:51,071
See you later. Yeah, thank you.
 Okay, thank you.

2527
01:26:51,073 --> 01:26:52,072
Byebye.
 Not you.

2528
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,611
Oh, my God.

2529
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:04,819
Ashburn.

2530
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:08,822
Why don't you have
your own phone?

2531
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:10,491
Who am I, the Queen of England?

2532
01:27:10,493 --> 01:27:13,361
I don't know, does the Queen
of England only wear sweatpants?

2533
01:27:13,363 --> 01:27:14,962
Fuck you.
 You... "F" you.

2534
01:27:14,964 --> 01:27:17,165
This is Mullins.
Hey, Shan, I left, all right?

2535
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,433
I couldn't sit there anymore.
 What are you talking about?

2536
01:27:18,435 --> 01:27:19,435
Where the hell are you?

2537
01:27:19,437 --> 01:27:20,735
Look, I talked to them,

2538
01:27:20,737 --> 01:27:21,869
and everything's fine,
all right?

2539
01:27:21,871 --> 01:27:22,870
Nothing's weird, we're good.

2540
01:27:22,872 --> 01:27:23,971
Nonono, nonono!

2541
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,506
It doesn't work that way, Jason.

2542
01:27:25,508 --> 01:27:27,108
They know you're my brother.
 Yeah, but they also know

2543
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:28,677
you arrested me,
and I made it seem

2544
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:30,245
like I hated you.
That's good, right?

2545
01:27:30,247 --> 01:27:31,513
Itit doesn't work that way.
 What's happening?

2546
01:27:31,515 --> 01:27:33,081
Shut up for a minute.

2547
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:34,783
Look, I know where the
shipment's going to, all right?

2548
01:27:34,785 --> 01:27:36,284
Okay, I don't give a shit
about the shipment!

2549
01:27:36,286 --> 01:27:37,853
What shipment?
 Just get your ass back here now.

2550
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:39,521
Let me talk...
 Look, I'm gonna stick around

2551
01:27:39,523 --> 01:27:41,089
and work it or they're
gonna know something's weird.

2552
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:42,991
Get off me.
 No, it's my phone.

2553
01:27:42,993 --> 01:27:44,960
Please trust me... I... I'm trying
to do the right thing here.

2554
01:27:44,962 --> 01:27:46,595
 Are you, are you kidding me?
 What?

2555
01:27:46,597 --> 01:27:47,831
Jason, Jason. Ow.

2556
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:49,432
Jesus Christ. Jason!
 Ow! Let go of my vest.

2557
01:27:49,434 --> 01:27:50,899
Shan.
 Ow. Jason, it's Ashburn.

2558
01:27:50,901 --> 01:27:52,034
What the fuck is going on?

2559
01:27:52,036 --> 01:27:53,735
Give it to me.
 What have you got?

2560
01:27:53,737 --> 01:27:55,037
Don't talk to her!
 Look, the shipment's coming

2561
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:57,273
into the Boston Harbor Shipyard
at 11:00.

2562
01:27:57,275 --> 01:27:59,042
Okay.  It's a big freighter,
tons of guys, all right?

2563
01:27:59,044 --> 01:28:00,877
No, I got it, I got...
 They're gonna be heavily armed,

2564
01:28:00,879 --> 01:28:02,111
so you got to be careful,
you hear me?

2565
01:28:02,113 --> 01:28:03,112
Okay, okay.
 God, get off!

2566
01:28:03,114 --> 01:28:04,681
The ship is called the, uh,

2567
01:28:04,683 --> 01:28:06,216
"S.S. Tank" or something
like that, all right?

2568
01:28:06,218 --> 01:28:07,750
I promise we'll be there.

2569
01:28:07,752 --> 01:28:09,052
All right, II got to go.
 Thank you.

2570
01:28:09,054 --> 01:28:10,520
I'll break
your fucking arm!

2571
01:28:10,522 --> 01:28:12,322
God!
 Okay, take it easy.

2572
01:28:12,324 --> 01:28:14,390
Just take, just take it
easy, just take it easy.

2573
01:28:14,392 --> 01:28:15,626
Just...

2574
01:28:15,628 --> 01:28:18,395
Jason? Jason?

2575
01:28:18,397 --> 01:28:19,964
Shit!

2576
01:28:21,799 --> 01:28:23,199
You just made
my brother a dead man!

2577
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:24,702
No, no, he's
gonna be fine.

2578
01:28:24,704 --> 01:28:26,237
Mullins, I swear,
he'll be fine.

2579
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:28,105
We'll... we're gonna
have thethe full power

2580
01:28:28,107 --> 01:28:29,707
of the, uh,
the Boston FBI

2581
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:32,476
down on that terminal tonight,
I promise you.

2582
01:28:32,478 --> 01:28:33,945
He's gonna be fine.

2583
01:28:33,947 --> 01:28:35,679
It really is
a good thing.

2584
01:28:35,681 --> 01:28:37,281
You'llyou'll thank me.
 Shut up!

2585
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:47,626
 All right.
 Ship's coming in.

2586
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:48,827
Time to lock and load.

2587
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:50,328
Okay, here we go.

2588
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,630
Here we go.

2589
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:00,939
Police. Put your hands up.

2590
01:29:00,941 --> 01:29:02,174
FBI!

2591
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:03,509
Get your fucking hands
in the air! Now!

2592
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:06,344
Let's see them!

2593
01:29:06,346 --> 01:29:07,913
Boat's clean.

2594
01:29:07,915 --> 01:29:09,848
It'sit's not clean.

2595
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:12,351
We found a joint in
that girl's purse. If...

2596
01:29:12,353 --> 01:29:15,321
Oh, now,
this is really a mess.

2597
01:29:15,323 --> 01:29:18,224
Sir, we just, we just have
to hit the streets again.

2598
01:29:18,226 --> 01:29:20,458
We hit the streets,
a  and if the shipment came in...

2599
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,028
Ashburn, enough.

2600
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:23,796
It's over. I'm sending you
back to New York.

2601
01:29:23,798 --> 01:29:25,231
Sir, sir, nononono,
please, please.

2602
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:26,966
I'mI'm telling you,
I'm so close.

2603
01:29:26,968 --> 01:29:28,968
I'm so close, and this was
just a little hiccup.

2604
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,437
No, it wasn't a hiccup.

2605
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:32,439
<i>Lo siento.</i>

2606
01:29:32,441 --> 01:29:33,574
Don't...

2607
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:35,142
Don't even... Oh, God.

2608
01:29:38,478 --> 01:29:39,846
Uh, um, sorry.

2609
01:29:39,848 --> 01:29:41,315
Uh, Detective Mullins...
have you seen her?

2610
01:29:41,317 --> 01:29:42,716
Oh, hospital.

2611
01:29:42,718 --> 01:29:45,218
Some kind of family emergency.

2612
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:48,021
Oh, God.

2613
01:30:04,473 --> 01:30:07,074
He's in an induced coma.

2614
01:30:07,076 --> 01:30:10,144
They shot him and left him
out in the street.

2615
01:30:10,146 --> 01:30:13,748
I'm so sorry, Mullins.

2616
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,883
I'm sorry.

2617
01:30:15,885 --> 01:30:17,720
Yeah, he was trying
to move on.

2618
01:30:17,722 --> 01:30:19,021
He had a job interview.

2619
01:30:19,023 --> 01:30:20,755
I... I saw the rÈsumÈ.

2620
01:30:20,757 --> 01:30:22,290
It was a terrible rÈsumÈ.

2621
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:26,427
He... mentioned prison,
and in "special skills,"

2622
01:30:26,429 --> 01:30:29,598
he said, "Keeping it real,"
but he...

2623
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,767
he was trying.

2624
01:30:31,769 --> 01:30:33,869
How'show's your family
holding up?

2625
01:30:33,871 --> 01:30:35,838
Well, they're not talking to me.

2626
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,706
Blame me more now than ever.

2627
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:38,874
It's not your fault.

2628
01:30:38,876 --> 01:30:40,275
Yes, it is.

2629
01:30:40,277 --> 01:30:43,512
Damn it, I should have
handled it by myself.

2630
01:30:43,514 --> 01:30:45,482
So that's it?

2631
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:50,620
I'm not your, I'm not
your partner anymore?

2632
01:30:50,622 --> 01:30:52,354
No, you're not.

2633
01:30:52,356 --> 01:30:54,556
You're another
fucking disappointment.

2634
01:30:54,558 --> 01:30:57,060
I just want you to know
that I'm gonna find

2635
01:30:57,062 --> 01:30:59,095
the man responsible for this.

2636
01:31:00,931 --> 01:31:02,499
Hey, Shan.

2637
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:07,771
Uh, that was wicked rude.

2638
01:31:07,773 --> 01:31:10,073
? You can live your life

2639
01:31:10,075 --> 01:31:13,243
? In a crowded city

2640
01:31:16,948 --> 01:31:20,685
? You can walk along

2641
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:23,521
? A crowded street

2642
01:31:28,627 --> 01:31:32,230
? But the city really

2643
01:31:32,232 --> 01:31:36,367
? Ain't no bigger

2644
01:31:36,369 --> 01:31:40,037
? Than the friendly people
 Police! Put your hands up!

2645
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:41,305
? Friendly people that you meet ?
 Really?

2646
01:31:41,307 --> 01:31:42,641
Ugh, God.

2647
01:31:48,014 --> 01:31:50,816
? But it don't do

2648
01:31:50,818 --> 01:31:56,221
? Too much good to be talkin'

2649
01:31:56,223 --> 01:31:59,191
? Brother, when there ain't no

2650
01:31:59,193 --> 01:32:02,795
? Ain't nobody listenin'.

2651
01:32:02,797 --> 01:32:04,297
Hi.

2652
01:32:04,299 --> 01:32:05,832
Hey.

2653
01:32:05,834 --> 01:32:07,165
I'll give these back to you.

2654
01:32:08,234 --> 01:32:10,570
Thank you so much for your help.

2655
01:32:10,572 --> 01:32:12,271
Anytime.

2656
01:32:12,273 --> 01:32:13,806
Hey...

2657
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:15,141
We're gonna miss you
around here.

2658
01:32:15,143 --> 01:32:17,577
Oh, I don't think so.

2659
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:18,845
I might.

2660
01:32:18,847 --> 01:32:20,314
Oh...

2661
01:32:22,883 --> 01:32:25,251
You did a good
job out there.

2662
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:27,820
Just keep your fingers
out of guys' necks.

2663
01:32:27,822 --> 01:32:29,223
It's nasty.

2664
01:32:29,225 --> 01:32:30,517
Bye.

2665
01:32:31,516 --> 01:32:32,576
Bye.

2666
01:32:32,611 --> 01:32:33,827
All right, if anybody
has any questions,

2667
01:32:33,829 --> 01:32:35,062
you come to Adam or myself.

2668
01:32:35,064 --> 01:32:36,262
That's all we got.

2669
01:32:36,264 --> 01:32:38,031
All right.

2670
01:32:38,033 --> 01:32:40,200
We sent out alerts to airports,
train stations.

2671
01:32:40,202 --> 01:32:41,902
DEA's gonna take the lead
on this one, all right?

2672
01:32:41,904 --> 01:32:43,637
Now, although this is

2673
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:47,408
a joint task force, we're also
working with the Boston PD.

2674
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:49,344
Right. Adam and I are gonna be
handpicking all the officers

2675
01:32:49,346 --> 01:32:50,745
so we don't wind up with this.

2676
01:32:50,747 --> 01:32:52,813
Ooh, ooh.

2677
01:32:53,982 --> 01:32:55,549
All right,
any questions?

2678
01:32:55,551 --> 01:32:56,851
Hey.

2679
01:32:56,853 --> 01:32:58,219
Hey, that's not right.

2680
01:32:58,221 --> 01:33:00,421
No, it's not.

2681
01:33:00,423 --> 01:33:02,223
No, that officer
that you're making fun of,

2682
01:33:02,225 --> 01:33:04,425
the one that you're all
laughing at, has more integrity,

2683
01:33:04,427 --> 01:33:06,194
more commitment, more courage
and more guts

2684
01:33:06,196 --> 01:33:07,896
than anybody in this room.

2685
01:33:07,898 --> 01:33:09,864
Yeah.
But less mental stability.

2686
01:33:11,701 --> 01:33:13,935
Okay, okay, so, um,
justjust to be clear,

2687
01:33:13,937 --> 01:33:15,871
what does mental instability
look like?

2688
01:33:15,873 --> 01:33:17,339
Keeping people safe?

2689
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:19,041
Protecting the community?
Getting the job done?

2690
01:33:19,043 --> 01:33:21,043
Is that what it looks like?
Well, then great.

2691
01:33:21,045 --> 01:33:22,410
If that's what
mental instability looks like,

2692
01:33:22,412 --> 01:33:23,978
sign me up for the crazy house.

2693
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,915
That officer right there

2694
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:27,983
is a better
law enforcement officer

2695
01:33:27,985 --> 01:33:30,019
than anybody in this room.

2696
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,187
Myself included.

2697
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:32,588
She is better than you,

2698
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:34,191
she is better than you,

2699
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:36,026
and she's definitely
better than you.

2700
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:38,027
What are you doing?!
Are you texting?

2701
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:39,161
Are you playing
a game? What?

2702
01:33:39,163 --> 01:33:40,396
What is it? Put it away.

2703
01:33:40,398 --> 01:33:42,298
Put it away.
God, you guys are just...

2704
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,100
What is, what is
the matter with you?

2705
01:33:44,102 --> 01:33:46,102
You're such,
you're just such jerks!

2706
01:33:46,104 --> 01:33:48,672
You're just such...

2707
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:50,207
You're just a shitjerk!

2708
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:53,710
You're just a shitjerk
dickfucker!

2709
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:57,447
You're a shitjerk
dickfucker assholer!

2710
01:33:57,449 --> 01:33:59,783
And you all can just
go fuck yourselves!

2711
01:33:59,785 --> 01:34:01,084
Not... sorry, senor, not you.

2712
01:34:01,086 --> 01:34:02,954
Pardon, please.

2713
01:34:02,956 --> 01:34:05,790
Just, all you fuckers!

2714
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,500
Get on the ground!

2715
01:34:16,502 --> 01:34:18,502
You are under arrest! Put your
hands where I can see them,

2716
01:34:18,504 --> 01:34:20,037
and tell me
where the fuck Larkin is!

2717
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:21,639
Hey.

2718
01:34:21,641 --> 01:34:25,276
I think it'd be much more better
if you put your hands up.

2719
01:34:25,278 --> 01:34:27,645
"Much more better"?

2720
01:34:27,647 --> 01:34:30,349
Drop the gun and take
a grammar course, you idiot.

2721
01:34:30,351 --> 01:34:32,451
Who the fuck are you?

2722
01:34:32,453 --> 01:34:35,020
Me and her?

2723
01:34:35,022 --> 01:34:36,921
We're the fuckin' heat.

2724
01:34:38,558 --> 01:34:41,026
All right.

2725
01:34:41,028 --> 01:34:42,928
We've got some scumbags
to visit, huh?

2726
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:44,062
Yeah, we do.

2727
01:34:44,064 --> 01:34:45,230
Get up, asshole.

2728
01:34:45,232 --> 01:34:47,132
Let's go.

2729
01:34:47,134 --> 01:34:49,302
? Ooh

2730
01:34:49,304 --> 01:34:50,637
Where's Larkin?

2731
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:52,104
What? I don't even
know who that is.

2732
01:34:52,106 --> 01:34:53,405
Where is he?!
 I told you,

2733
01:34:53,407 --> 01:34:54,806
I don't know
who the fuck that is!

2734
01:34:54,808 --> 01:34:56,975
Really?
Okay, so it's clean?

2735
01:34:56,977 --> 01:34:59,112
Clean?
You not finding anything?

2736
01:34:59,114 --> 01:35:00,713
Nothing in here?
Really, you...

2737
01:35:00,715 --> 01:35:02,815
Right, okay, hhold on a second.
How about this?

2738
01:35:02,817 --> 01:35:05,379
Right there!

2739
01:35:06,453 --> 01:35:08,054
Got your pizza.

2740
01:35:08,056 --> 01:35:09,122
Got your pizza, mister.

2741
01:35:09,124 --> 01:35:10,390
Just a minute, Lou.

2742
01:35:11,525 --> 01:35:13,159
Fresh hot pizza.
 Get on your knees!

2743
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:14,961
What the fuck is this?
 Get down on the ground!

2744
01:35:14,963 --> 01:35:16,562
Where's your stash?
 I don't have anything yet.

2745
01:35:16,564 --> 01:35:18,332
I'm waiting to get some
from a new distributor.

2746
01:35:18,334 --> 01:35:19,633
Who's your new
distributor?

2747
01:35:19,635 --> 01:35:21,335
? Ooh

2748
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:24,337
? Ooh

2749
01:35:24,339 --> 01:35:26,640
Oh, shit, man.

2750
01:35:26,642 --> 01:35:28,342
Guess who.

2751
01:35:28,344 --> 01:35:30,344
Surprise.
 Hey, man, come on, man!

2752
01:35:30,346 --> 01:35:32,646
Listen, I don't know
what y'all doing here!

2753
01:35:32,648 --> 01:35:33,580
I'm out the game.

2754
01:35:33,582 --> 01:35:34,982
You know what I hate?
Drugs.

2755
01:35:34,984 --> 01:35:35,984
I'm a different man.

2756
01:35:38,053 --> 01:35:39,553
This is not mine.

2757
01:35:39,555 --> 01:35:41,255
I just bought that refrigerator
the other day.

2758
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,856
This must have been in there.

2759
01:35:42,858 --> 01:35:46,594
We want to know where all
this new shit is coming from.

2760
01:35:46,596 --> 01:35:47,996
Where is Larkin?

2761
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:50,699
Bitch, which part of "I'm out"
do you not understand?

2762
01:35:50,701 --> 01:35:52,433
I'm out!

2763
01:35:54,302 --> 01:35:55,570
You want to interview him?

2764
01:35:55,572 --> 01:35:56,771
Mm, no.

2765
01:35:56,773 --> 01:36:00,675
No, I think I have
something better in mind.

2766
01:36:01,912 --> 01:36:03,211
Oh, shit!

2767
01:36:03,213 --> 01:36:04,747
I don't know shit!
Come on!

2768
01:36:04,749 --> 01:36:07,048
I don't know, you're getting
awfully heavy, Rojas.

2769
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:08,616
Yeah, lie to me again.

2770
01:36:08,618 --> 01:36:10,819
I want to feel your body sliding
through my delicate hands.

2771
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:12,887
I don't know shit!
 Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2772
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:15,091
I can't, I can't hold you.
 No, I don't want to die!

2773
01:36:15,093 --> 01:36:16,158
I don't want to die!

2774
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,526
Okay, okay!

2775
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:19,295
It's at a warehouse
on Summer Street!

2776
01:36:19,297 --> 01:36:20,296
I'm almost disappointed.

2777
01:36:20,298 --> 01:36:21,397
Get me up!

2778
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:22,564
All right, let's
pull him up.

2779
01:36:22,566 --> 01:36:24,100
No, wait, I'm not
kidding anymore.

2780
01:36:24,102 --> 01:36:25,368
I really... I can't lift him up.
 What?!

2781
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:26,736
No!
 I can't lift him.

2782
01:36:26,738 --> 01:36:28,504
Shit, I've only done this
one other time,

2783
01:36:28,506 --> 01:36:29,939
and it was a really tiny hooker!

2784
01:36:29,941 --> 01:36:31,440
Lift my ass up!

2785
01:36:31,442 --> 01:36:33,310
You ain't fucking putting
nobody over no rails

2786
01:36:33,312 --> 01:36:34,845
you can't fucking lift them out!

2787
01:36:34,847 --> 01:36:36,246
Okay, okay.

2788
01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:40,483
Uh... just tuck your head
and relax your body.

2789
01:36:40,485 --> 01:36:41,985
Lady, what the fuck?!

2790
01:36:41,987 --> 01:36:42,986
God...
 Crap. Crap.

2791
01:36:42,988 --> 01:36:44,488
Get me up! Let me out!

2792
01:36:50,295 --> 01:36:51,995
Thankthank you again.

2793
01:36:51,997 --> 01:36:53,997
Thank you.

2794
01:36:53,999 --> 01:36:55,232
That was on me.

2795
01:36:55,234 --> 01:36:56,266
I take that.

2796
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:58,168
I hope this ain't my car.

2797
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:00,170
This my car? This my car?

2798
01:37:00,172 --> 01:37:01,873
Oh, shit!

2799
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:03,608
My 2003!

2800
01:37:04,476 --> 01:37:06,210
Let's load up.

2801
01:37:06,212 --> 01:37:08,311
? Hey, I can be the answer

2802
01:37:08,313 --> 01:37:09,814
? I'm ready to dance
when the vamp up ?

2803
01:37:09,816 --> 01:37:11,916
? And when I hit that dip,
get your camera ?

2804
01:37:11,918 --> 01:37:13,317
Nonononono.

2805
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:14,385
Yes, yes.  No, no,
you said that thing ticks.

2806
01:37:14,387 --> 01:37:15,720
Yeah, but not for days.

2807
01:37:15,722 --> 01:37:17,622
? The bitch
who wants to compete ?

2808
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:19,558
? And I could freak a 'fit,
that pump with the peep ?

2809
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,427
? And you know what your bitch

2810
01:37:21,429 --> 01:37:23,394
? I just wanna sip that punch
with your peeps ?

2811
01:37:23,396 --> 01:37:24,929
? And sit in that lunch
if you're treating ?

2812
01:37:24,931 --> 01:37:26,697
? Kick it with your bitch
who come from Parisian ?

2813
01:37:26,699 --> 01:37:29,435
? She know where I get mine from
and the season... ?

2814
01:37:29,437 --> 01:37:30,636
Are you hungry?

2815
01:37:30,638 --> 01:37:32,704
I got a sandwich
I didn't finish.

2816
01:37:32,706 --> 01:37:35,340
Is that the same sandwich
you offered me a week ago?

2817
01:37:35,342 --> 01:37:36,508
It's cheese.

2818
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:37,910
Cheese doesn't go bad.

2819
01:37:37,912 --> 01:37:39,711
? Ayo, ayo

2820
01:37:39,713 --> 01:37:44,616
? I heard you're riding with
the same tall, tall tale, tall ?

2821
01:37:44,618 --> 01:37:46,919
<i>? Telling them you made some
? Made some ?</i>

2822
01:37:46,921 --> 01:37:51,391
? Saying you're grinding,
but you ain't going nowhere ?

2823
01:37:51,393 --> 01:37:52,758
? Nowhere

2824
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,626
? What you goin' do
when I appear ?

2825
01:37:54,628 --> 01:37:56,663
? Wwhenwhen I premiere

2826
01:37:56,665 --> 01:37:58,431

2827
01:37:58,433 --> 01:38:00,567

2828
01:38:00,569 --> 01:38:02,402

? This shit been

2833
01:38:11,646 --> 01:38:13,313
Baby formula.
Yeah.

2834
01:38:13,315 --> 01:38:14,681
Cartels have been
smuggling cocaine

2835
01:38:14,683 --> 01:38:16,350
in baby formula for years.

2836
01:38:16,352 --> 01:38:17,952
Two of them, two of us.

2837
01:38:17,954 --> 01:38:18,919
I like those odds.

2838
01:38:21,223 --> 01:38:22,489
Boston PD!
 FBI!

2839
01:38:22,491 --> 01:38:23,990
Get down on
the ground!

2840
01:38:23,992 --> 01:38:26,060
That's right, that's how we roll.

2841
01:38:26,062 --> 01:38:27,461
Come on.

2842
01:38:30,866 --> 01:38:33,100
You guys all coming back

2843
01:38:33,102 --> 01:38:34,970
from break at
the same time?

2844
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,939
Unfortunate.

2845
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:41,575
You guys get less attractive
every time I see you.

2846
01:38:41,577 --> 01:38:43,310
Put the fucking guns down.
 No, thanks.

2847
01:38:43,312 --> 01:38:44,312
Nice entrance,
Teen Wolf.

2848
01:38:44,314 --> 01:38:45,814
What?!

2849
01:38:45,816 --> 01:38:47,782
You look like a Ninja Turtle,
all right? Take it easy.

2850
01:38:47,784 --> 01:38:50,452
I've held someone at gunpoint
for 72 hours before... let's go.

2851
01:38:50,454 --> 01:38:51,720
Wewe need to do what he says,
all right?

2852
01:38:51,722 --> 01:38:52,720
What?!

2853
01:38:52,722 --> 01:38:54,189
It's the, it's the best thing.

2854
01:38:54,191 --> 01:38:55,757
What are we gonna do,
shoot our way out of this?

2855
01:38:55,759 --> 01:38:56,758
Okay, just put the gun
in the bag.

2856
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,860
No, get your... hold your gun up.

2857
01:38:58,862 --> 01:39:01,129
Just give them the bag and
give them everything! Come on!

2858
01:39:01,131 --> 01:39:02,665
Goddamn you.

2859
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,667
I thought you had my back.
 Put it in the bag

2860
01:39:04,669 --> 01:39:06,235
and slide it over, now.

2861
01:39:06,237 --> 01:39:07,669
It's in the bag!
It's in the bag!

2862
01:39:07,671 --> 01:39:09,838
Slide the bag over.
 Sorry.

2863
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,176
I guess you and her
are engaged now, huh?

2864
01:39:13,178 --> 01:39:14,277
What?!

2865
01:39:14,279 --> 01:39:16,979
Well, 'cause you just gave me

2866
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:18,414
a ring, motherfucker!

2867
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:19,849
Oh, shit.

2868
01:39:26,657 --> 01:39:28,057
Shit.

2869
01:39:28,059 --> 01:39:29,358
Oh.

2870
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,128
Get up. Get up already.
 Ow.

2871
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:32,796
Oh, God.

2872
01:39:32,798 --> 01:39:34,464
No, no, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop!  Pull it out.

2873
01:39:34,466 --> 01:39:35,532
Okay, that feels broken.
 Pull it out.

2874
01:39:35,534 --> 01:39:36,733
It's out!

2875
01:39:37,936 --> 01:39:38,834
Nice work.

2876
01:39:38,836 --> 01:39:40,237
How many of
you are there?

2877
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,705
Really?

2878
01:39:44,609 --> 01:39:46,810
Hey...

2879
01:39:46,812 --> 01:39:48,845
How funny.

2880
01:39:48,847 --> 01:39:51,382
This is like when you
were interrogating me,

2881
01:39:51,384 --> 01:39:53,450
only now you're tied up

2882
01:39:53,452 --> 01:39:55,652
and I got all these knives.

2883
01:39:57,155 --> 01:40:00,491
You know, I don't like, uh...
I don't like to shoot people.

2884
01:40:00,493 --> 01:40:01,693
I like cutting people up.

2885
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:03,861
It's kind of what I do.

2886
01:40:05,998 --> 01:40:08,166
That's athat's a... I like that one.
It's...  That's a good one.

2887
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:10,368
It's a good choice; it's small.
 ... a small one.

2888
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:11,970
You like this?

2889
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:13,071
Not too flashy.

2890
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:16,174
This is actually
a oystershucking knife.

2891
01:40:17,777 --> 01:40:20,713
Either of you ladies
need your oyster shucked?

2892
01:40:20,715 --> 01:40:22,281
Not at the moment.
 Not me. Not me.

2893
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:23,815
You know,
I got to tell you,

2894
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:28,120
I've done this a...
lot of times to a lot of people,

2895
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:32,057
but you two... you're
gonna be the most fun. What?

2896
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:35,060
Larkin's here.

2897
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:37,197
Larkin.
 Upstairs.

2898
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,235
The fun'll have to wait.

2899
01:40:43,237 --> 01:40:45,037
The boss is here.

2900
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:48,141
Can you, uh, please
excuse me a second, ladies?

2901
01:40:48,143 --> 01:40:49,509
Sure. Take...

2902
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:51,411
Yeah, take your time.
 ... whatever time you need.

2903
01:40:51,413 --> 01:40:53,245
Okay, cool. Cool.

2904
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:55,081
Oh, also, um...

2905
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:57,550
would you mind
holding this for me?

2906
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:00,053
Well, mymy hands are tied,
but I can...

2907
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:03,023
 Oh, okay. Let me help you.
 Ooh!  Jesus!

2908
01:41:03,025 --> 01:41:04,025
Thanks.

2909
01:41:04,027 --> 01:41:07,527
Fuck! Fuck! FF...
 Shh.

2910
01:41:07,529 --> 01:41:09,162
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
 Shh...!

2911
01:41:09,164 --> 01:41:11,031
Breathe through the pain.
Breathe through the pain.

2912
01:41:11,033 --> 01:41:13,367
Yeah, do that.

2913
01:41:13,369 --> 01:41:14,835
Do that, do that.

2914
01:41:14,837 --> 01:41:16,003
Breathe it out, breathe it out,
 Oh, my God.

2915
01:41:16,005 --> 01:41:17,371
breathe it out.
 Okay, Mullins.

2916
01:41:17,373 --> 01:41:18,806
Oh.

2917
01:41:18,808 --> 01:41:20,207
If we should perish in here...

2918
01:41:20,209 --> 01:41:22,343
We're not gonna.
 All right, just shh...!

2919
01:41:22,345 --> 01:41:25,446
I know I'm not very good
with my feelings... oh, God...

2920
01:41:25,448 --> 01:41:27,281
but I need to tell you
something, okay?

2921
01:41:27,283 --> 01:41:29,483
Okay, you are...
you are smart,

2922
01:41:29,485 --> 01:41:31,719
you are smart
and you are intuitive,

2923
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:34,456
and you're the best cop
I'veI've ever worked with.

2924
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:35,490
Oh, God.

2925
01:41:35,492 --> 01:41:37,092
You, too. Thank you.

2926
01:41:37,094 --> 01:41:39,360
You were right... I went back
and looked at the evidence,

2927
01:41:39,362 --> 01:41:42,130
and I think the Red Falls Killer
is innocent. Oh...

2928
01:41:42,132 --> 01:41:43,699
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

2929
01:41:43,701 --> 01:41:45,267
Did you happen to
mention that to anybody

2930
01:41:45,269 --> 01:41:47,436
before you put yourself in a
lifethreatening situation?

2931
01:41:47,438 --> 01:41:48,503
No, no, I didn't!
No, I didn't!

2932
01:41:48,505 --> 01:41:49,971
Jesus! Good luck.

2933
01:41:49,973 --> 01:41:52,075
You're taking that to
your grave, probably.

2934
01:41:52,077 --> 01:41:53,775
Fuck, the other leg!
Fuck, the other leg!

2935
01:41:53,777 --> 01:41:56,278
Oh, God.
 I got it. I got it.

2936
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,313
You can move your chair,
too, you know? Just...

2937
01:41:58,315 --> 01:42:00,115
I am moving my chair!

2938
01:42:00,117 --> 01:42:02,318
Just grab the knife.
Grab the knife.

2939
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,453
Take it. Take it.

2940
01:42:03,455 --> 01:42:04,921
Take it, just take it.

2941
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:07,457
I'm sorry.

2942
01:42:07,459 --> 01:42:08,890
I got it!

2943
01:42:08,892 --> 01:42:09,792
Waah!

2944
01:42:09,794 --> 01:42:11,627
Shh. Shut up.
 Waah! Waah!

2945
01:42:11,629 --> 01:42:13,563
Shut up.
 Just come on, come on, all right?

2946
01:42:13,565 --> 01:42:15,431
I am doing it as
fast as I can.

2947
01:42:15,433 --> 01:42:16,632
It's almost there, it's almost
there, it's almost there.

2948
01:42:16,634 --> 01:42:18,434
Whew... Come on.
 Got it!

2949
01:42:18,436 --> 01:42:22,373
 Hurry up, hurry up...
hurry up, hurry up.

2950
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:24,474
What?
 Somebody's coming up.

2951
01:42:24,476 --> 01:42:26,175
Got to put it back in.
 What?!

2952
01:42:26,177 --> 01:42:27,543
I got to put it back in,

2953
01:42:27,545 --> 01:42:28,912
and I'll put my hands
behind my back,

2954
01:42:28,914 --> 01:42:30,881
and then when he gets
close to me, I grab him.

2955
01:42:30,883 --> 01:42:32,783
But you got to shut up
and let me put it back in.

2956
01:42:32,785 --> 01:42:34,051
Okay, just put it in,
put it in...

2957
01:42:34,053 --> 01:42:35,753
Oh, my God, what are you...?
Jesus!

2958
01:42:35,755 --> 01:42:37,187
Sorry, it doesn't go in
that fuckin' easy.

2959
01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:38,722
Just... just...
 Just shut up, shut up.

2960
01:42:38,724 --> 01:42:40,557
Ow! Motherfucker.

2961
01:42:40,559 --> 01:42:41,725
Oh...
 I'm sorry.

2962
01:42:41,727 --> 01:42:43,293
Oh, shit.

2963
01:42:43,295 --> 01:42:45,963
I'll pretend... I'll pretend
to keep my hands tied.

2964
01:42:45,965 --> 01:42:48,133
Shut up! Shut up!

2965
01:42:49,469 --> 01:42:50,769
Oh, no, Scoob!

2966
01:42:50,771 --> 01:42:53,036
Velma and Daphne got captured!

2967
01:42:53,038 --> 01:42:55,773
Ah, I never thought I'd be happy
to see you guys.

2968
01:42:55,775 --> 01:42:57,375
Come on, we got to get her
to the hospital.

2969
01:42:57,377 --> 01:42:58,743
Did you guys call this in?

2970
01:42:58,745 --> 01:43:00,545
Yeah, I sent a fuckin' owl
with a note.

2971
01:43:00,547 --> 01:43:01,980
How did you even
know we were here?

2972
01:43:01,982 --> 01:43:03,415
We followed you.
I knew you weren't

2973
01:43:03,417 --> 01:43:05,150
gonna give up that easily,
especially not after

2974
01:43:05,152 --> 01:43:06,485
they greased
your shitbag brother.

2975
01:43:06,487 --> 01:43:07,852
Fuck you.
You know, it takes

2976
01:43:07,854 --> 01:43:09,654
a lot more than Larkin
to take down a Mullins.

2977
01:43:09,656 --> 01:43:11,923
Wait, JaJason's not dead?

2978
01:43:11,925 --> 01:43:13,658
Come on, Adam.
Larkin is on his way.

2979
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:14,859
What is this, a Q and A?

2980
01:43:14,861 --> 01:43:16,162
Can we fuckin'
do this later?

2981
01:43:16,164 --> 01:43:17,630
Yeah, wait...
did he talk to the police?

2982
01:43:17,632 --> 01:43:19,131
Did he see Larkin?
 Well, how was she

2983
01:43:19,133 --> 01:43:20,966
supposed to know? He's been
in a coma. Can you please

2984
01:43:20,968 --> 01:43:22,168
continue untying my leg?
 That's too bad.

2985
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:23,802
Where is he?
Is he at Boston General?

2986
01:43:23,804 --> 01:43:25,304
Why, are you gonna send
him fuckin' flowers?

2987
01:43:25,306 --> 01:43:26,739
Why are you so...

2988
01:43:26,741 --> 01:43:28,874
Oh, my God.

2989
01:43:28,876 --> 01:43:30,142
You piece of shit.

2990
01:43:30,144 --> 01:43:32,745
You guys are working
with Larkin.

2991
01:43:32,747 --> 01:43:34,414
I really wish
you hadn't said that.

2992
01:43:34,416 --> 01:43:35,849
Said what?

2993
01:43:36,717 --> 01:43:38,751
Oh, God! Oh, God.
 Shit!

2994
01:43:38,753 --> 01:43:40,085
God, that felt good.

2995
01:43:40,087 --> 01:43:41,821
God, it wasn't the albino.

2996
01:43:41,823 --> 01:43:43,088
I feel bad.

2997
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:44,758
Yeah, no, he wasn't
working for Larkin.

2998
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,193
He just wanted you
off the case

2999
01:43:46,195 --> 01:43:48,094
'cause he's
a misogynistic asshole.

3000
01:43:48,096 --> 01:43:49,896
Why are you doing this?
You getting some kind of,

3001
01:43:49,898 --> 01:43:51,431
what, a payoff,
is that what it is?

3002
01:43:51,433 --> 01:43:52,800
I was, in the beginning.

3003
01:43:52,802 --> 01:43:54,568
Six years dealing
with these lowlives,

3004
01:43:54,570 --> 01:43:55,702
making shit money.

3005
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:57,904
Ah.

3006
01:43:57,906 --> 01:43:59,573
You're Larkin.

3007
01:43:59,575 --> 01:44:00,841
Holy shit.

3008
01:44:00,843 --> 01:44:02,276
? Tada!

3009
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:03,544
Get it? Right?

3010
01:44:03,546 --> 01:44:04,912
Makes perfect sense.

3011
01:44:04,914 --> 01:44:06,314
Uh, well, now I'm bragging,

3012
01:44:06,316 --> 01:44:08,782
but it's very nice
having a second income.

3013
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:11,686
I heard shots.
What the...?

3014
01:44:11,688 --> 01:44:12,720
Aw, the albino?

3015
01:44:12,722 --> 01:44:14,255
That guy was hilarious.

3016
01:44:14,257 --> 01:44:15,990
Boss, I don't think that was
such a good idea.

3017
01:44:15,992 --> 01:44:17,925
Yeah, well, you spend three
years in a van with him

3018
01:44:17,927 --> 01:44:19,327
and you'd kill him, too.

3019
01:44:19,329 --> 01:44:20,963
We'll pin it on LeSoire.

3020
01:44:20,965 --> 01:44:23,664
I've got to go to the hospital
to finish Jason.

3021
01:44:23,666 --> 01:44:25,399
You deal with these two.

3022
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:27,235
No loose ends.
 Mmhmm.

3023
01:44:27,237 --> 01:44:28,836
Fuckin' rat.

3024
01:44:28,838 --> 01:44:31,640
We told you
to stay out of the way.

3025
01:44:31,642 --> 01:44:33,976
Goodbye.

3026
01:44:33,978 --> 01:44:35,244
You fuckin' rat!

3027
01:44:35,246 --> 01:44:37,579
See you, buddy.
 Don't call me buddy.

3028
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:39,514
He's actually a great guy.

3029
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,317
All right, uh...

3030
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:44,253
let's have some fun.

3031
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:51,828
I've been waiting
to do this a long time.

3032
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:53,795
Campbell's soup...

3033
01:44:53,797 --> 01:44:55,364
you're up first.

3034
01:44:55,366 --> 01:44:57,332
Please don't hurt us.
Please don't hurt us.

3035
01:44:57,334 --> 01:44:59,669
I didn't mean to say
that shit I said.

3036
01:44:59,671 --> 01:45:01,337
Please don't hurt us.

3037
01:45:01,339 --> 01:45:03,106
Aah! God!

3038
01:45:03,108 --> 01:45:04,507
Come on!

3039
01:45:04,509 --> 01:45:06,576
Son of a bitch!

3040
01:45:09,114 --> 01:45:12,248
Mullins, gun at 2:30! Mullins!

3041
01:45:13,685 --> 01:45:15,084
Get...

3042
01:45:16,153 --> 01:45:17,922
 Get off!
 Don't!

3043
01:45:17,924 --> 01:45:20,591
You take one step, and
your partner gets it.

3044
01:45:23,662 --> 01:45:25,395
Oh. Ah.

3045
01:45:25,397 --> 01:45:26,764
Shit!

3046
01:45:26,766 --> 01:45:27,831
Nice.

3047
01:45:27,833 --> 01:45:28,933
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God.

3048
01:45:28,935 --> 01:45:30,100
Look at me.
 Oh, God.

3049
01:45:30,102 --> 01:45:31,735
Look at me. Are you okay?
 Oh, God,

3050
01:45:31,737 --> 01:45:32,903
I think I'm gonna throw up.

3051
01:45:32,905 --> 01:45:34,705
My God, it was
a really bad headbutt.

3052
01:45:34,707 --> 01:45:36,541
Yeah.
 Yeah. It was good.

3053
01:45:36,543 --> 01:45:37,976
But you're gonna feel it.

3054
01:45:37,978 --> 01:45:39,310
Go, go, go.
 Get yourself untied.

3055
01:45:39,312 --> 01:45:40,578
And then we're gonna
go get Jason.

3056
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:41,845
Okay, got it?

3057
01:45:41,847 --> 01:45:45,149
Why won't they answer my phone?

3058
01:45:45,151 --> 01:45:46,885
Go, go, go, go, go.

3059
01:45:54,292 --> 01:45:55,827
Oh, dickfucker!

3060
01:45:57,965 --> 01:46:00,532
Damn it, get off
the fuckin' phone!

3061
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:03,268
Useless!

3062
01:46:15,817 --> 01:46:18,351
We got something.

3063
01:46:18,353 --> 01:46:20,353
 I got it. I got it.
 Get her on the stretcher.

3064
01:46:20,355 --> 01:46:22,021
No, no, I got it.

3065
01:46:22,023 --> 01:46:24,290
I got it! I got it, I got it, I got it.

3066
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:25,257
Okay, thank you.

3067
01:46:25,259 --> 01:46:27,126
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

3068
01:46:27,128 --> 01:46:28,995
Oh, crap.

3069
01:46:28,997 --> 01:46:30,129
There you go.
Oh, crap.

3070
01:46:30,131 --> 01:46:32,199
All right, got to turn.

3071
01:46:32,201 --> 01:46:33,100
Call 911.

3072
01:46:33,102 --> 01:46:34,334
You won't shoot me?

3073
01:46:34,336 --> 01:46:36,637
Well, just...
yeah, call it, call it.

3074
01:46:39,206 --> 01:46:41,140
Where's my brother,
you asshole?

3075
01:46:41,142 --> 01:46:43,543
Okay, you know, it's that kind
of language from your family

3076
01:46:43,545 --> 01:46:46,246
that forced us to move him to
the east wing of the hospital.

3077
01:46:46,248 --> 01:46:48,415
I don't know why...
 Move, dipshit!

3078
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:49,650
Jason, I'm coming!

3079
01:46:49,652 --> 01:46:51,686
What the fuck?

3080
01:46:53,689 --> 01:46:55,255
Come on, come on.

3081
01:46:57,025 --> 01:46:59,559
Stupid, stupid chair!

3082
01:46:59,561 --> 01:47:01,396
Screw it.

3083
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:22,785
Eee... Eee...

3084
01:47:22,787 --> 01:47:24,852
Eee...

3085
01:47:24,854 --> 01:47:27,422
Shit.
You know,

3086
01:47:27,424 --> 01:47:30,325
it's amazing
what a little air

3087
01:47:30,327 --> 01:47:33,162
in the bloodstream does
to the human heart.

3088
01:47:33,164 --> 01:47:34,563
You may not want
to watch this.

3089
01:47:34,565 --> 01:47:36,331
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

3090
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:39,501
I just want you to
know that... I get it.

3091
01:47:39,503 --> 01:47:42,705
I get it.
I mean, I've been on the...

3092
01:47:42,707 --> 01:47:46,008
Eee... Eee...  I've been on
the job a long time, and...

3093
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:48,645
you just see
so many bad things and...

3094
01:47:48,647 --> 01:47:50,080
and bad people, and you...

3095
01:47:50,082 --> 01:47:52,482
you just start to wonder
if, you know,

3096
01:47:52,484 --> 01:47:55,184
is anybody good
anymore, and...

3097
01:47:55,186 --> 01:47:57,687
I just want you
to know that, you know,

3098
01:47:57,689 --> 01:47:59,322
you don't have to do this.

3099
01:47:59,324 --> 01:48:01,791
You don't have to do it.

3100
01:48:03,294 --> 01:48:05,395
I know.

3101
01:48:05,397 --> 01:48:07,965
But I do, because I have plans

3102
01:48:07,967 --> 01:48:11,434
that don't involve me going to
prison with people I put there.

3103
01:48:11,436 --> 01:48:12,869
So say goodbye

3104
01:48:12,871 --> 01:48:14,971
to your mick brother.
 Wait, wait, wait!

3105
01:48:16,242 --> 01:48:18,676
Drop it, or I'm
gonna fire this weapon.

3106
01:48:18,678 --> 01:48:21,078
Or I inject...

3107
01:48:22,013 --> 01:48:23,581
Oh, you shot him in the dick.

3108
01:48:23,583 --> 01:48:25,583
Twice.

3109
01:48:25,585 --> 01:48:27,118
Oh, shit!

3110
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,820
I took a page right out
of your book, partner.

3111
01:48:29,822 --> 01:48:31,255
Oh, God, but I've
never done it.

3112
01:48:31,257 --> 01:48:33,324
I just... you know,
I just aim it at it.

3113
01:48:33,326 --> 01:48:35,527
I don't actually do it.
That's ffuckin' crazy.

3114
01:48:35,529 --> 01:48:37,863
What about Julian?
 I take the bullets out!

3115
01:48:37,865 --> 01:48:40,431
What?  I mean, I just use it
as a tactic to scare him.

3116
01:48:40,433 --> 01:48:42,399
I mean, Jesus,
I'm not fuckin' crazy.

3117
01:48:42,401 --> 01:48:45,904
Oh, my God, don't make me
feel about it. God!  No, no, I know.

3118
01:48:45,906 --> 01:48:48,106
Hey, no, come...
Ooh, watch that leg.

3119
01:48:50,444 --> 01:48:52,077
You did good,
little buddy.

3120
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:54,946
You saved my
brother's life.

3121
01:48:56,617 --> 01:48:58,016
Doing good.
 Thank you.

3122
01:48:58,018 --> 01:49:00,285
Yeah.
 Shit.

3123
01:49:00,287 --> 01:49:01,887
Internal Affairs
is going to open

3124
01:49:01,889 --> 01:49:05,625
a toptobottom investigation
of every department now.

3125
01:49:05,627 --> 01:49:06,659
Nice work.

3126
01:49:06,661 --> 01:49:09,494
Well, it was...
it was a team effort, sir.

3127
01:49:09,496 --> 01:49:12,899
Yeah. We put out
an APB on Julian.

3128
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:15,768
Oh, don't bother;
he's in the trunk.

3129
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:17,937
Oh, and, uh, sir...

3130
01:49:17,939 --> 01:49:21,575
uh, we're gonna have to reopen
the Red Falls Killer case.

3131
01:49:22,877 --> 01:49:24,744
Good for you.

3132
01:49:24,746 --> 01:49:26,179
I don't know.

3133
01:49:26,181 --> 01:49:29,282
I thought that would feel good,
but it felt awful.

3134
01:49:29,284 --> 01:49:31,051
You know, that's
probably gonna...

3135
01:49:31,053 --> 01:49:33,253
just keep feeling bad.

3136
01:49:33,255 --> 01:49:35,289
I'm glad you did it.

3137
01:49:35,291 --> 01:49:38,258
Should we be leaving
the hospital?  Oh, shit. No.

3138
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:40,194
Probably not.
Probably not.

3139
01:49:40,196 --> 01:49:42,462
Spin it, spin it.
 Okay, did it, did it.

3140
01:49:42,464 --> 01:49:45,332
Now, let's...
let's take this one though.

3141
01:49:45,334 --> 01:49:47,100
Okay. Is that clean?
 Let's get you up here.

3142
01:49:47,102 --> 01:49:48,635
I'll get you...
It's clean enough.

3143
01:49:48,637 --> 01:49:50,271
Oh, my God, that smells.
 Get off the leg, get off the leg.

3144
01:49:50,273 --> 01:49:51,773
Like several people
died on here.

3145
01:49:51,775 --> 01:49:53,208
Oh, my... Let me just sit.
 Let's get your legs up.

3146
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:54,675
No, I don't need
to be on my face.

3147
01:49:54,677 --> 01:49:56,243
You know, you can
help the process.  Ow! God!

3148
01:49:56,245 --> 01:49:58,178
Not clean.
 Inchworm it up.

3149
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:00,048
Come on. Come on.
 Okay, okay, that's good.

3150
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:01,249
Just flip me.

3151
01:50:01,251 --> 01:50:02,884
Get off the leg,
get off the leg,

3152
01:50:02,886 --> 01:50:04,352
off the leg.

3153
01:50:04,354 --> 01:50:06,487
Don'tdon't fall off.
 Oh, my God. Okay.

3154
01:50:06,489 --> 01:50:08,424
Okay, I want this place
locked down, people.

3155
01:50:08,426 --> 01:50:10,925
Nobody goes in or out
without talking to me.

3156
01:50:10,927 --> 01:50:12,393
I want you three
stationed at each end

3157
01:50:12,395 --> 01:50:13,895
of the east wing.
Let's go.

3158
01:50:13,897 --> 01:50:15,363
All right, let's clear
this hallway, people!

3159
01:50:15,365 --> 01:50:17,533
Let's go!
 What are you...

3160
01:50:17,535 --> 01:50:19,501
You two, get the
press out of here.

3161
01:50:20,937 --> 01:50:22,071
You okay?

3162
01:50:22,073 --> 01:50:24,772
Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

3163
01:50:24,774 --> 01:50:26,809
Yeah, I knew you would be.

3164
01:50:26,811 --> 01:50:28,744
I'm good, too.

3165
01:50:29,646 --> 01:50:30,546
Excuse me.

3166
01:50:30,548 --> 01:50:32,114
You see this
woman right here?

3167
01:50:32,116 --> 01:50:34,250
This is one of the best
agents in the FBI.

3168
01:50:34,252 --> 01:50:36,052
You make sure she's
well taken care of.

3169
01:50:36,054 --> 01:50:37,387
All right?

3170
01:50:39,389 --> 01:50:41,390
That was...

3171
01:50:41,392 --> 01:50:43,893
that was...
that was interesting, right?

3172
01:50:43,895 --> 01:50:46,196
I would look into that.
 Yeah...

3173
01:50:46,198 --> 01:50:47,664
Oh, God! What is that?

3174
01:50:47,666 --> 01:50:49,666
All right. All right, let's go.
 Oh, Christ.

3175
01:50:49,668 --> 01:50:51,868
Um, you actually
have to stay here.

3176
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:53,403
Why?
 All right, well, just...

3177
01:50:53,405 --> 01:50:55,538
do what you can
to save that leg.

3178
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:57,274
Oh, I'm not a doctor.

3179
01:50:57,276 --> 01:50:58,909
All right, fucktard,

3180
01:50:58,911 --> 01:51:01,745
I know you're not a doctor,
but tell it to the doctor.

3181
01:51:01,747 --> 01:51:02,846
How about that?

3182
01:51:05,784 --> 01:51:09,786
All right, I'll wait
right here for you.

3183
01:51:09,788 --> 01:51:11,454
Throw out that sandwich.

3184
01:51:11,456 --> 01:51:13,123
I'll bring you that sandwich!
 No!

3185
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:14,225
Throw it out!

3186
01:51:14,227 --> 01:51:16,093
You got it, buddy.

3187
01:51:16,095 --> 01:51:18,429
<i>For outstanding service,</i>

3188
01:51:18,431 --> 01:51:20,932
Officer Shannon Mullins.

3189
01:51:36,282 --> 01:51:38,150
There you go, Shan!
There you go, Shan!

3190
01:51:38,152 --> 01:51:40,451
That's what
I'm talking about!

3191
01:51:40,453 --> 01:51:43,522
There you go, Shannon!

3192
01:51:45,525 --> 01:51:47,993
Hold it up!
Hold it up! Yeah!

3193
01:51:59,572 --> 01:52:01,140
Take out the gun.
Take out the gun.

3194
01:52:04,746 --> 01:52:06,579
<i>Just a little snooze, man.</i>

3195
01:52:06,581 --> 01:52:09,381
I'd like to cake toast to Jason.
 Cake toast.

3196
01:52:09,383 --> 01:52:11,150
Yeah! To Jason.
 Yeah, dude.

3197
01:52:11,152 --> 01:52:12,785
May I have your
attention, please?

3198
01:52:12,787 --> 01:52:15,154
I wanted you to have this...
it was your grandmother's.

3199
01:52:15,156 --> 01:52:17,190
Aw.  She would've been
very proud of you

3200
01:52:17,192 --> 01:52:19,126
taking care
of your brother.

3201
01:52:19,128 --> 01:52:21,161
Yeah, that's...
that's awesome.

3202
01:52:21,163 --> 01:52:22,696
Take a picture.
Take a picture.

3203
01:52:22,698 --> 01:52:26,966
Come on, take a picture.
 Oh, my God. Are you serious?

3204
01:52:26,968 --> 01:52:29,036
"Dunkin' Jesus"?
 Yeah.

3205
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,741
No cell phones.

3206
01:52:33,743 --> 01:52:35,476
How about now?

3207
01:52:35,478 --> 01:52:38,747
Oh, different story?
Oh, come on back.  Jesus.

3208
01:52:44,019 --> 01:52:45,552
Ashburn.
Hey, it's me.

3209
01:52:45,554 --> 01:52:46,787
Hey!

3210
01:52:46,789 --> 01:52:50,291
So, uh, you getting all settled
in your new digs?

3211
01:52:50,293 --> 01:52:52,260
Yeah, yeah, they're pretty...
pretty sweet.

3212
01:52:52,262 --> 01:52:54,628
Who needed
that promotion anyway?

3213
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:56,965
I'm glad I stayed around where
all the action is, you know?

3214
01:52:56,967 --> 01:52:59,434
We got a lot of scumbags
we need to take down

3215
01:52:59,436 --> 01:53:00,435
here in Boston, Mullins.

3216
01:53:00,437 --> 01:53:01,436
Yeah, we do, right?

3217
01:53:01,438 --> 01:53:02,771
Hey, uh...
 Yeah.

3218
01:53:02,773 --> 01:53:04,539
...did you get
that package I sent over?

3219
01:53:04,541 --> 01:53:06,675
Oh! God, I haven't even
opened it yet. I'm sorry.

3220
01:53:06,677 --> 01:53:08,878
It's crazy, 'cause your dad
sent me something, too, so...

3221
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:11,980
It's, like,
the Mullins' gift day.

3222
01:53:11,982 --> 01:53:12,981
Hold on.

3223
01:53:12,983 --> 01:53:14,115
Oh. Okay.

3224
01:53:14,117 --> 01:53:15,951
I signed... signed it in front.

3225
01:53:15,953 --> 01:53:18,154
Does that mean you
broke into my house again?

3226
01:53:18,156 --> 01:53:19,855
Maybe, maybe not, right?

3227
01:53:19,857 --> 01:53:22,124
Yeah, it's amazing how that door
just opens up all by itself.

3228
01:53:22,126 --> 01:53:23,893
Okay, I see it.
That's very funny.

3229
01:53:23,895 --> 01:53:25,828
No, I know. I was just kidding.

3230
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:27,430
Just look at the...
look at the back.

3231
01:53:27,432 --> 01:53:29,465
Oh, you wrote
something else mean

3232
01:53:29,467 --> 01:53:31,467
and profanityladen in the back?

3233
01:53:31,469 --> 01:53:33,569
Okay, here it is.

3234
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:40,242
Well...

3235
01:53:40,244 --> 01:53:42,411
don't make it weird.

3236
01:53:45,383 --> 01:53:47,017
Later, nerd.

3237
01:53:47,019 --> 01:53:49,152
Takes a nerd to know a nerd.

3238
01:53:49,154 --> 01:53:51,054
Okay. You made it weird.

3239
01:53:51,056 --> 01:53:52,857
Bye.
 Bye.

3240
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:56,960
I left my baby in the car.

3241
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:19,317
Hi.

3242
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:21,286
Hey. There's, uh,
there's been something

3243
01:54:21,288 --> 01:54:24,722
I've been thinking about a lot,
and it's been bothering me,

3244
01:54:24,724 --> 01:54:26,991
and... well,
I got you something.

3245
01:54:26,993 --> 01:54:28,960
Oh. Okay.
 Oh.

3246
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:33,632
I found your friend.

3247
01:54:33,634 --> 01:54:35,234
Pumpkin!

3248
01:54:35,236 --> 01:54:36,535
Awesome, right?

3249
01:54:36,537 --> 01:54:38,170
I drove all the way
to New Jersey,

3250
01:54:38,172 --> 01:54:40,639
and I was up and down these
streets and looking all over,

3251
01:54:40,641 --> 01:54:42,474
and, you know, I was
just about to give up,

3252
01:54:42,476 --> 01:54:43,976
and I was over
by your old place.

3253
01:54:43,978 --> 01:54:45,544
All of a sudden I hear
this little bell,

3254
01:54:45,546 --> 01:54:47,045
and I thought,
wait a minute.

3255
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:48,814
I looked in your neighbor's
window, and I saw

3256
01:54:48,816 --> 01:54:50,283
this asshole sitting
right on the couch.

3257
01:54:50,285 --> 01:54:51,718
I said, "You are coming with me,

3258
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:53,786
even if you don't want
to go back with her... "

3259
01:54:53,788 --> 01:54:56,388
Oh, he fought you, huh? Yeah.
 Yeah, he fought me.

3260
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,923
Wow.
 Pretty hard, but I'm just glad

3261
01:54:57,925 --> 01:55:00,560
that, you know,
I could kind of make this...

3262
01:55:00,562 --> 01:55:01,794
reuniting... Yeah.
 Oh, wow.

3263
01:55:01,796 --> 01:55:04,664
What a surprise this is. Huh.

3264
01:55:04,666 --> 01:55:06,833
What a surprise, huh?

3265
01:55:06,835 --> 01:55:09,270
Look at where you are.

3266
01:55:09,272 --> 01:55:11,671
This was never your cat, was it?
 Yeah, no, no, no, it isn't.

3267
01:55:11,673 --> 01:55:14,073
Goddamn it, put him in the box.
Put him in the box.

3268
01:55:14,075 --> 01:55:17,076
 Oh, can you...
can you put him back?

3269
01:55:17,078 --> 01:55:19,780
I... well, do I have a lot of choice?
 Well, can you...

3270
01:55:19,782 --> 01:55:21,515
make sure he's got...
lot of water?

3271
01:55:21,517 --> 01:55:23,017
Just don't.
 He likes to snuggle.

3272
01:55:23,019 --> 01:55:25,285
Don't make me put the
cat down and punch you.

3274
01:55:30,692 --> 01:55:34,061
? It's no use,
we're gonna have to fight ?

3275
01:55:34,063 --> 01:55:37,065
? Thrown your words round
a thousand times ?

3276
01:55:37,067 --> 01:55:39,401
? Like a child
who can't empathize ?

3277
01:55:39,403 --> 01:55:43,537
? You don't speak the language,
you don't read my signs ?

3278
01:55:43,539 --> 01:55:46,374
? You wanna know
what I really think? ?

3279
01:55:46,376 --> 01:55:49,611
? You wanna know
what I really believe? ?

3280
01:55:49,613 --> 01:55:52,881
? There's a fire burning
up in here ?

3281
01:55:52,883 --> 01:55:54,684
? See the smoke
coming out of my ears ?

3282
01:55:54,686 --> 01:55:58,720
? Oh, no, we both know

3283
01:55:58,722 --> 01:56:01,856

if we're all alone ?

3284
01:56:01,858 --> 01:56:04,260

3285
01:56:04,262 --> 01:56:07,663

on the outside looking in ?

3286
01:56:07,665 --> 01:56:10,632

my head? ?

3287
01:56:10,634 --> 01:56:13,869

lie down in my head? ?

3288

I'm your binocular ?

3293
01:56:35,427 --> 01:56:38,562
? And every time you'll get
a shock, you'll learn ?

3294
01:56:38,564 --> 01:56:41,565
? What's it like to be
in my dimension ?

3295
01:56:41,567 --> 01:56:44,668
? I'll be the center
of your attention ?

3296
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:48,038
? Come listen
to all the sounds I hear ?

3297
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,707
? The quiet prose
and the crack of the snare ?

3298
01:56:50,709 --> 01:56:53,678
? Make your mark
on my territory ?

3299
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:56,079

in every cavity ?

? Oh, want a piece
of my mind? ?

3327
01:58:25,175 --> 01:58:28,442
? Emphatic and erratic
at the drop of a dime ?

3328

? Oh, want a piece
of my mind? ?

3329

? Dada, dada, dada, dada,
dadadada ?

3334
01:58:58,975 --> 01:59:01,543
? Like the blood
running through my veins ?

3335
01:59:01,545 --> 01:59:05,081
? This is my DNA
and my chemistry ?

3336
01:59:05,083 --> 01:59:08,384
? But from the pews
of the congregation ?

3337
01:59:08,386 --> 01:59:11,219
? You'll never know
the real salvation ?

3338
01:59:11,221 --> 01:59:14,557
