1
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,296
I'm really excited
to be here.

2
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:11,233
We have something really special
to share with you today.

3
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,905
In total, between iMac
and PowerBook lines,

4
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:20,246
we have sold over three
million units this year.

5
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:26,950
Okay. That's it.

6
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,330
Well, maybe there's
one more thing.

7
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:34,190
I'm about to show you
something that's amazing.

8
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,961
Something that no one else
in the world has seen yet.

9
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:42,605
Now, Jony, myself
and a small team

10
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:47,272
have been working really
hard on a secret project,

11
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:49,281
which is something
I've been known to do

12
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,181
from time to time.

13
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:54,547
The device I'm about
to introduce to you

14
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:57,817
is gonna revolutionize
an entire industry.

15
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:00,790
It's a music playing device.

16
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,724
0K3?'-

17
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,893
We'll get to that in a minute.

18
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:09,800
Because what it represents is
as important as what it is.

19
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:14,899
It's a tool for the heart.

20
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:20,074
And when you can
touch someone's heart,

21
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:22,809
that's limitless.

22
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:27,252
If I do say so myself,
it's insanely cool.

23
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:31,485
It's a music player.

24
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:38,160
It's a thousand songs
in your pocket.

25
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,430
I'd like to introduce you

26
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,831
to the iPod.

27
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,042
Hey, Jobs.

28
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:33,114
Get up, man. Wake up.

29
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:36,488
I'm up.

30
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:41,892
I'm up.

31
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,060
I'm up.

32
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:04,907
Steve.

33
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:07,246
Hey, Daniel.
Hey, what's going on?

34
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:09,950
<i>Are you reading Be Here Now?
 Yeah, it's amazing.</i>

35
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:11,821
I'm reading that right now.
It's unbelievable.

36
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:14,155
It's the next level.
Hey, speaking of Be Here,

37
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:16,251
what happened to you last night?
Where'd you go?

38
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:18,762
I had to study.
I know, I know.

39
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,995
You know, I'm not dismissing
the value of higher education,

40
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,195
I'm just saying it comes at
the expense of experience.

41
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:26,330
The system can
only produce the system.

42
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:28,430
I don't want to be a part of that.
Neither should you.

43
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:31,341
I agree with you. It takes balls
to drop out like you did.

44
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,003
That's why you should.

45
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,012
I mean...
Steven.

46
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:37,648
Might I borrow
you for a moment?

47
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:39,852
I'll see you in, see you later.
Sure.

48
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:41,944
Thank you. Thanks. I hope
I'm not interrupting.

49
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:44,118
What about your classes?

50
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:45,857
I'm not a student
anymore, Jack.

51
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:47,689
Well, you're here,
and you're learning.

52
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:49,456
Sure sounds like
a student to me.

53
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:51,354
If you want me gone...

54
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:53,194
Why would I want
you gone, Steven?

55
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,032
I'm glad that
you're here.

56
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:56,796
Whether you're
paying or not.

57
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:58,865
Now, you're always carrying
this notebook around.

58
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,407
You obviously fancy
yourself as an artist.

59
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:03,874
Why don't you sit in
on some design classes?

60
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:08,312
No. Well, I like the idea of art' the beauty.
But only in the right context.

61
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,407
Just not as a career. I don't
have the necessary talents.

62
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,576
But aren't you interested in electronics?
What about engineering?

63
00:06:12,674 --> 00:06:16,383
There's a growing market for qualified
technicians. What about that?

64
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,082
I don't want to spend
my parents' money

65
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,750
to get a degree
and become something

66
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,191
as forgettable
as an electrician.

67
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:24,354
Excuse me, what, a degree is
a waste of time now? So...

68
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:30,097
For some. For others it offers validation.
Job security.

69
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,002
Steve...
I'll see you around.

70
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:36,537
Steven. To be continued.

71
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,751
What are you working on?

72
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:53,855
Nothing, really. It's homework
for calligraphy class.

73
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,018
It's beautiful.

74
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,866
Yeah, the teacher's
this monk, or something.

75
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,058
A monk?

76
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,271
Yeah. Robert Palladino.

77
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,700
He's totally inspiring.

78
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:09,534
My name's Julie.

79
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,211
Are you leaving?

80
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,545
Yeah. I have to go.

81
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:25,452
You want a hit?

82
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:27,883
Yes.

83
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:31,062
Yes, I do.

84
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,723
Can I take a couple?

85
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,770
Sure.
For my friends.

86
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:40,733
Well, my friend,
and my girlfriend.

87
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:51,751
It's so beautiful.

88
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:55,914
Like a window to the world.

89
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,359
What do you think
it's like in space?

90
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:03,487
It's...

91
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,594
beyond understanding.

92
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,130
Yeah.

93
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:13,329
Who has a baby,

94
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:17,607
and then just throws it
away like it's nothing?

95
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:23,006
You talking about
your birth parents?

96
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:26,015
Oh, no,
no,no,no,no.

97
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:31,049
That's bad. Yeah. That's
making me really sad. I...

98
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,860
Sorry that my life
is ruining your high.

99
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:38,195
It's okay.

100
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,735
I miss you when
you're not around.

101
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,008
I love you, Steve.

102
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,810
I love you.

103
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,985
Space. The endless black deep.

104
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:10,890
What was it that
that guru used to tell us?

105
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,665
There is no time to waste.

106
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,235
Do you hear that?

107
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,176
What?

108
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,023
There he goes again.

109
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:04,606
Calligraphy is the artful and
visual expression of communication.

110
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:06,652
Take Garamond, for example.

111
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:11,053
A typeface specifically designed
to make the very act of reading

112
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,781
more natural.

113
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:28,806
Computers are inherently
designed to make your lives easier.

114
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:32,104
Theoretically there's no limit
to what computers can do.

115
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:52,325
It is not who you were
at birth that matters

116
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:55,759
but what you do with
the time you are given.

117
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:58,604
The moment of
your death is fixed.

118
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:02,935
Life is but ajourney to
serenity, to its completion.

119
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,112
Be as simple
as you can be.

120
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:19,785
You'll be astonished
to see how uncomplicated

121
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,987
<i>and happy your
life can become.</i>

122
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:46,341
I don't even know what I'm
gonna do when I go back home.

123
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,850
What about you?

124
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:52,081
What are you gonna do when
you get back to The Valley?

125
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:53,521
Steve?

126
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:56,484
Steve? You okay?

127
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:12,378
No. No, no! No. It's
still black and white.

128
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,045
People want color.

129
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,248
Pong didn't have color.
So?

130
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,875
Let's do something better.

131
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,681
It can't do color.

132
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:21,777
Says who?

133
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:24,216
Okay, you refuse
to do anything

134
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,350
that vaguely escapes
your comfort zone.

135
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:27,620
You're not even my boss.

136
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:28,888
Well, I damn sure
should be.

137
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,190
Hey, Jobs!

138
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,121
Whafre you doing, Steve?

139
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,255
He's an idiot.

140
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,694
You know, and half
the people around here

141
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:38,135
don't know how
to design shit.

142
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:43,073
People are complaining
about your behavior.

143
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,104
Okay? And, yeah.
About mine?

144
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,976
And your odor.

145
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:49,779
Are you showering
like we discussed?

146
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:50,941
I'm wearing shoes.
You asked me

147
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,211
to wear shoes,
and I've got them on.

148
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:53,753
That's not part
of the deal, Steve.

149
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,754
You've gotta learn how to
work well with other people.

150
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,249
I'm just trying
to do it right, Al.

151
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:01,555
I know you are.

152
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:02,720
Then lei me.

153
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,388
Listen, Steve!

154
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:07,399
You're good.
You're damn good.

155
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:09,897
But you're an asshole.

156
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:13,462
Well, that...

157
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:14,562
Hey. Let me finish.

158
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:18,334
I want you here.
I really do.

159
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,571
Somethings gotta change.

160
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,315
Give me my own project.
What?

161
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:27,910
Give me my own project.

162
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,351
I'll do it on my own.

163
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:33,619
And I'll make the best damn
game you have ever seen.

164
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:35,587
You're serious.

165
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:39,257
Okay, Steve.

166
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:41,961
I need someone to reprogram
a troublesome game.

167
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:43,195
But I'm on
a tight deadline.

168
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,760
So if you can deliver,

169
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:47,765
we'll pay you
up to $5,000.

170
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:51,641
$5,000?
Mmm-hmm.

171
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:53,835
0K3?'-

172
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:58,444
And as for your personal issues,
I think I may have a solution.

173
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:06,720
So many circuits.

174
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:30,080
Woz? Hey, it's Steve.

175
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,494
Thanks for saving my ass.

176
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,771
Of course. We're friends.
That's, that's what friends do.

177
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,344
I just can't work
for other people.

178
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:11,753
I guess I need my independence.
If that makes any sense.

179
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:13,854
Uh-huh.

180
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,556
That makes perfect sense.

181
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:23,635
I'm sorry for ruining
your Friday night.

182
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:27,596
Are you kidding me?
This is great.

183
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:30,633
I'd do this for free.
I really would.

184
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:34,542
Butjust out of curiosity,
how much are we getting paid?

185
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,039
$700.

186
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:42,282
Some big bucks there.

187
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,759
ALCORNI Shit.

188
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:57,937
This is good. Really good.

189
00:15:58,593 --> 00:15:59,731
I know.

190
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,310
Wow. Four days.
You aren't kidding around.

191
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,474
I'll have to show it to Nolan,
but this is, this is good.

192
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:24,987
Woz?

193
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:26,497
Hi. Hi.

194
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,161
Woz!

195
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:32,636
Hi! Yeah, I'm
in the living room.

196
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,501
Hey. Good news.

197
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:37,008
Huh? Let me guess, your
bosses liked the video game.

198
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:38,509
They loved it!
Ooh.

199
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:41,309
$350. Whew! That's not bad.

200
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:43,280
Not bad? It's great.

201
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:45,846
What are you working on?

202
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,510
I'm writing jokes for
my dial-a-joke machine.

203
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,955
I've got some really good funny Polish
jokes, which work because I'm Polish.

204
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,855
Hang out and tell me what
you think of this one.

205
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:55,018
Ready? Ready?

206
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:58,859
<i>What is long, and hard, that a Polish
bride gets on her wedding night?</i>

207
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:00,694
<i>A new last name.</i>

208
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,862
That's hilarious.

209
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,803
Pretty good, isn't it?

210
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:10,240
What do you call a beautiful
Polish girl? Lucky.

211
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,870
What's that?

212
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:17,305
Hmm'?

213
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:21,212
Oh.

214
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,555
That. Now that
is gonna be cool.

215
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:28,650
It's a computer terminal board
I'm working on.

216
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:32,331
Hooks up to the TV
for the display.

217
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:36,261
What is it like, a kit?
What do you mean?

218
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,725
Well, well...

219
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:38,997
The code is still buggy,

220
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,269
but in theory it'll display
whatever you're working on. Like...

221
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:43,603
Show me.

222
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,703
Show you. Okay.

223
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:07,956
<i>Wow.</i>

224
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:26,748
<i>I don't care if HP
didn't like it. It matters.</i>

225
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,048
<i>Yeah.
It's got potential.</i>

226
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:31,579
<i>No, the Sex Pistols have potential.
This is the wheel.</i>

227
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:32,886
It's the
Industrial Revolution.

228
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,154
No more decks,
no more mainframes.

229
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:36,421
That changes everything.

230
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:37,588
It's pretty cool, I guess.

231
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:38,790
Hi, Charlene. Hello.
Hey.

232
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:42,766
Cool. It's profound. How could you
not tell me about this before?

233
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:45,236
I don't know. I was just working on it for my own.
It, it was a hobby.

234
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:48,172
Exactly. Exactly.
For your own. For you.

235
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:52,310
It's what you wanted. It's what
your gut' your instinct wanted.

236
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,347
Your big evolved brain wanted
something that didn't exist,

237
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:58,246
so you just willed it
into existence.

238
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,614
It's, what do you
call the system?

239
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:01,745
The operating system?

240
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:03,914
The operating, and it just shows you...
That's what I call it.

241
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:06,356
Yeah, it's just a real time
display of current operations.

242
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,485
You can see what you're working
on while you're working on it.

243
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,824
Okay. Look...

244
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,022
Don't you get this?
This is freedom.

245
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,658
This is freedom to create,
and to do, and to build,

246
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,633
as artists, as individuals.
Look, look, look.

247
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,535
But look,
you're overreacting.

248
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:23,439
Even if you were developing this for
freaks like us, and I doubt you are,

249
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:26,342
nobody wants to buy
a computer. Nobody.

250
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:30,007
How does somebody know what they
want if they've never even seen it?

251
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,105
Huh?

252
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,119
We're going to Homebrew.

253
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,113
No...

254
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,324
lam not presenting
anything at Homebrew.

255
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:43,191
I'm“. No.

256
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:48,125
Why do people drive so slow'?
Get out! Move!

257
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:50,066
I'm telling you right now,
I've been to Homebrew.

258
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,695
I understand the caliber
of people who speak there.

259
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,239
I'm not one of those people.

260
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:56,706
I'm telling you this thing is amazing.
I'm not...

261
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,368
You're gonna be great, Woz.

262
00:19:58,466 --> 00:20:00,969
Steve, could you do me a
favor, could you just please

263
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:02,537
slow down a little bit
so that I feel like

264
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:05,584
there's a chance we might
actually get there alive.

265
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:08,153
I want to get there first
so we present first.

266
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,051
You know if we're
gonna do this thing,

267
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:12,249
we need to come up
with a name.

268
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,018
Yeah, I know. Something catchy.
Something...

269
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:15,252
I've been
thinking about it.

270
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:16,487
...electric.

271
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,023
It needs to feel like...
I don't know.

272
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:21,190
What about
Enterprise Computers?

273
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:22,256
No.

274
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,858
<i>No Star Trek names.
I swear.</i>

275
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,165
What about Kirk Enterprises?

276
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:26,398
I will drive this car
right off this road.

277
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:27,495
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine!

278
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:28,734
I will run the car
right off the road.

279
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,741
Jesus! Calm down! Seriously.

280
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:33,005
Okay. Nothing Trekkie. Jesus.

281
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:36,941
It just needs to be, like, something
that people will relate to, you know?

282
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,745
Like, it needs to be
something that you see,

283
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,582
and you're just, like,
"Man, I just gotta have it."

284
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:46,418
APDIe.

285
00:20:47,348 --> 00:20:48,622
Excuse me?

286
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,190
Apple.
Apple, like the fruit'?

287
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,924
The fruit of creation. Apple.
It's simple but sophisticated.

288
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:58,697
It comes before Atari
in the phone book, too.

289
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,039
That is so much better
than Phaser Beam Computers.

290
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,772
It's naming it
after a fruit.

291
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,472
Apple. Apple Computer.

292
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:11,080
But, what about
Apple Records?

293
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,280
Apple Records?
The Beatles' label, stu...

294
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:14,785
What, they own
the word "apple"?

295
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,048
Why do you always
hate The Beatles?

296
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,145
Well, I do not
hale The Beatles.

297
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:18,985
Yes, you do. You always...
I do not hate The Beatles.

298
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,991
They're just, they're not
Dylan, and you know that.

299
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:23,062
Okay, and that's a comparison
that you always make.

300
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:24,289
Well, I...
'Cause it's obvious.

301
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,557
And I don't think it's fair.

302
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,428
Apple. Really? Apple?

303
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:31,669
Right, listen. If we come up with
something better, we'll change it.

304
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,569
Let's just go with it
and see if it sticks.

305
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,075
<i>It will display
up to 192 memory locations</i>

306
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,485
<i>on the monitor simultaneously.</i>

307
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:54,617
Allow me to explain because it's
quite fascinating, actually.

308
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:59,428
The logic board is rather complex,
especially compared to some of

309
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:02,765
the other boards here,
including of course,

310
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:05,495
the Altair.

311
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,035
And as you can see...

312
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:13,206
it's much smaller, and cheaper
to manufacture and build...

313
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:17,377
which, by using
dynamic RAM, I was able...

314
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:23,279
We were able to shrink the size
of the board substantially.

315
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:25,290
<i>So, it works with
your television?</i>

316
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:27,121
YES, yes, yes, yes!

317
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:31,358
It will work on any
television, or video monitor.

318
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:35,025
All you need is
a radio frequency converter

319
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:38,895
to display the images
from your microprocessor

320
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:40,995
to your set output device.

321
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,473
And it'll run BASIC.

322
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:52,313
It will also run BASIC, which
I think could be a great...

323
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:57,387
So I guess that wraps it up. Thank
you very much for your time.

324
00:22:57,645 --> 00:23:00,854
This was terrific. Fuck.

325
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:03,151
Tough crowd.

326
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,898
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Frank.

327
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:08,023
I'm Lutz.

328
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:12,162
And we're here with reduced
instruction set computing CPU.

329
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,913
Excuse me.
Name is Paul Terrell.

330
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,517
Saw your presentation.

331
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:28,011
And?

332
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,713
And I'd like
to talk business.

333
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:33,256
What can I do for you?
Well...

334
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:36,590
I own a local computer parts
store, in Mountainview.

335
00:23:36,684 --> 00:23:37,788
The Byte Shop?

336
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:39,091
You buy computer parts.

337
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:42,633
Yeah. We sell transistors, boards,
soldering equipment, monitors.

338
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,202
You know, hobbyist types.

339
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,396
Like Radio Shack?

340
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:47,199
No.

341
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:51,138
Listen, why don't you stop
by and talk to me sometime.

342
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:53,439
There's my card.
Give me a call.

343
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,103
G reat.

344
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,476
It was nice meeting you.

345
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:58,075
Steve Jobs.

346
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,650
Steve Jobs. All right.

347
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,382
Who was that?

348
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,389
It's Paul Terrell.
Oh.

349
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,127
Who?

350
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:49,662
So what kind of investment
are we talking about here?

351
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:53,534
Jesus, Steve. I said I was
interested, not buying.

352
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:57,097
I know. But you're also not
the only interested party.

353
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,871
Oh, really? I'm not'?
No.

354
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:00,001
You're not.
Hmm.

355
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:01,171
That's interesting.

356
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:03,373
Because it sure seemed that way
the other night at Homebrew.

357
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:06,111
You think that's the
first stop that we made?

358
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,319
We've been
all over The Valley.

359
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,619
0h, well, then you
already have a retailer.

360
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:12,947
I got offers.

361
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:17,360
Look, Paul. My middle name's Paul.
My dad's name is Paul.

362
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,226
Bunch of Pauls. I'm.“

363
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,822
I think we're
kindred spirits here.

364
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:24,501
We're both businessmen
that operate from our gut.

365
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,063
And my gut tells me to
give you this opportunity.

366
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:36,708
I'm thinking $400 per machine, for 50
units, paid at the time of delivery.

367
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:40,808
$400 for a hundred units,
a third up front.

368
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,013
We're not negotiating.

369
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,146
Yes, we are.

370
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:51,420
Okay. I'll pay $450
per machine. $450.

371
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:56,233
On delivery, nothing up front. I
know it's asking a lot, Steve.

372
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,894
But it's a big payoff
if you deliver.

373
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,999
When I deliver.

374
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:07,373
$500 per unit and
you've got a deal.

375
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:13,743
All right.
You got 90 days.

376
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:16,545
I'll have it in 60.

377
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,893
Daniel and I just didn't have
room at our place, so...

378
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:26,932
No, no.
I'm glad you asked.

379
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,432
We could move some things around,
give it a good cleaning.

380
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:35,268
I could move most of
my tools to the shed.

381
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:37,638
Maybe get you boys
a fan when it gets hot.

382
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:38,801
Ooh.

383
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,974
What do you think?

384
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:43,879
It's great, Dad.

385
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:46,475
Yes. It is.
This is perfect.

386
00:26:46,574 --> 00:26:50,249
Good. Well, it'll be good to
see you building something.

387
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:56,154
Good. Hey, keep it neat.

388
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:57,954
Inside and out.

389
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,990
Thanks, Mr. J.
Mmm.

390
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:08,270
We got a shop.

391
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,935
Yes, we do.

392
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:26,316
How's it going?

393
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,792
And voila'.

394
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:39,159
It's gotta be straighter. These
have to be more symmetrical.

395
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:42,034
We have 60 days to
complete 50 of these,

396
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,540
and you're worried
about the symmetry?

397
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:46,043
Sieve, nobody cares
about the look of the board.

398
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,113
I care.
Well, that's just great.

399
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,781
But we were out of time the minute
you made that stupid promise.

400
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:54,945
You're right.

401
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,114
Need help.

402
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,216
Woz.
Huh?

403
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,862
We got a problem.
Huh?

404
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,898
We got to figure out what to
do with all these employees.

405
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,293
You know Bill?
Bill.

406
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,030
Too long, Woz.
How are you?

407
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:13,366
Good to see you.
How is everyone?

408
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,564
Oh, this is my friend
Daniel Kottke.

409
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:16,005
Hey. I've heard a lot about you.
How're you doing?

410
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:19,742
Koﬂke? Kottke from
India, of course.

411
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,210
I've heard a lot
about you, too.

412
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:22,975
Don't touch that.

413
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:25,911
That's Chris Espinosa. Kid down the
street I was telling you about?

414
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:28,179
Nice to meet you, fella.
This is gonna be so cool.

415
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:31,985
Great. I'm so glad
that you're excited

416
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:33,650
about this thing
we're doing here.

417
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:34,852
Can I talk to you
for a second?

418
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:35,985
Yeah.

419
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,724
Excuse me, just please stop.
And go over there.

420
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:41,163
Just out of the way,
over there.

421
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:50,369
We can't afford to pay
three people right now.

422
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:56,377
We can't afford to pay
ourselves, unless we deliver.

423
00:28:57,204 --> 00:29:00,447
And don't worry about Chris. He's just a kid.
So he just wants to help.

424
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:03,914
You're just a kid.

425
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:06,052
Cheese!

426
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:11,028
Thanks, Mom.

427
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:13,296
So embarrassing.

428
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,873
All right.
As promised.

429
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,013
Nice board.

430
00:30:45,646 --> 00:30:46,852
Where's the rest?

431
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:50,189
The rest?
This is all of them.

432
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,187
I asked
for 50 computers.

433
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:56,029
That's keyboards, cases,
monitors, and power included.

434
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:57,898
Notjust boards.

435
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:02,637
Just boards? Excuse me'? Just boards?
These are state-of-the-art.

436
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:07,008
The logic boards alone are...
Nobody's making anything like this.

437
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:09,741
They're, what, how dare you!
How dare you!

438
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:13,649
I think what my colleague
is saying is that...

439
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,851
You're not seeing
the possibilities here.

440
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,050
That is indeed one unbelievably
kick ass computer.

441
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:22,093
Not to the consumer.

442
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:23,490
Well, then maybe
your consumer

443
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,086
should start to
learn how to...

444
00:31:25,185 --> 00:31:26,323
How to even work that,
don't you think?

445
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:28,025
Listen, boys.

446
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:33,064
You sold me on a home computer.
That's a keyboard and monitor.

447
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,696
This is a board.

448
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:37,072
Now, I'm sure this makes
a very capable starter kit,

449
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:38,575
but the everyday person,

450
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:40,702
the kind of person
that's not an engineer,

451
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:42,941
or in a computer club like you,

452
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,414
they're not gonna know
what the hell this is.

453
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:48,612
The average Joe doesn't want
to build their own computer.

454
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:50,052
They just want to buy it.

455
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,454
They want to take it out
of the box, plug it in,

456
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:54,389
and have it work.

457
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:55,616
Steve.

458
00:31:56,884 --> 00:31:58,795
Are you listening to me?

459
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:03,531
Yeah. These are your boards.

460
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:06,398
And they will sell.

461
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,872
I can promise you that.

462
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:11,638
You saw our demo
at Homebrew.

463
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:13,769
You know what it's capable of
with the right components,

464
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:17,076
which, by the way,
all of which you sell.

465
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,545
So, demo it to the consumer.

466
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,747
And market
the components separately.

467
00:32:23,877 --> 00:32:26,050
You show them your keyboards,
and your monitors.

468
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:27,751
You'll move more
inventory that way,

469
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:29,658
and you'll make a hell
of a lot more cash.

470
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:33,296
You got me.

471
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:39,637
All right, Steve.

472
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:41,499
I'll try to sell them.

473
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:46,306
But if I don't, I'm not
making another order.

474
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,471
Okay. That's fine.

475
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:52,073
But I think that you might be really
interested in our second model.

476
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,846
What's the second model?

477
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:57,145
What are
you talking about?

478
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,090
All-in-one.

479
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,682
Can I help you?

480
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:36,283
Yeah, I'm Rod Holt.

481
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:40,324
The technician.
We talked on the phone.

482
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,997
Of course. It's Rod.

483
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,871
Glad you could stop by.

484
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,143
Welcome to Apple Computer.

485
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,180
All right.

486
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:01,352
Show me this
revolutionary piece of shit.

487
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:03,386
The Apple ll.

488
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:08,486
It's the first ever all-in-one
personal home computer.

489
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:10,321
And you called
me because?

490
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:16,096
We need a heat efficient power supply.
In the case.

491
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:18,667
That's impossible,
but don't mind me.

492
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,705
I'm just, you know,
an engineer.

493
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,399
What's the wattage?

494
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,772
40 watts. And quiet.

495
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,670
What the hell do you mean, quiet?
I mean silent.

496
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:29,611
There's no such thing.

497
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:32,415
These things run hot.
They need fans in them.

498
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:33,849
Those bitches
ain't quiet.

499
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,078
That's exactly
why we need you.

500
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,448
To redesign it.

501
00:34:41,014 --> 00:34:42,220
Redesign what?

502
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,592
The power supply.
From scratch.

503
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,793
It can't have a fan,
it can't overheat.

504
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:52,697
And ii needs to fit
inside a box this size.

505
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,112
Don't do that.
Please, don't do...

506
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:08,550
Whatever.
Do whatever you want.

507
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,062
My raie is $200 a day.

508
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,958
And if I ever think things
aren't working out, I walk.

509
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:25,058
Mmm-hmm.

510
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:26,666
Are we clear?

511
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,173
We're clear.

512
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,341
We're talking
about the future.

513
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:37,244
We're working in a market
that doesn't even exist yet.

514
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:39,809
What Intel has done
for the microprocessor,

515
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:42,610
we are gonna do for
the home computer.

516
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:49,184
How can you not know
what I'm talking about?

517
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:55,799
No, ma'am. But it
runs on a TV monitor.

518
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,764
Yes, like a television set.
Exactly.

519
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,772
I don't think you understand. It's not a TV.
It's a personal computer.

520
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:07,675
Okay, do you own
a typewriter?

521
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:11,977
Great. Okay, now do you use it?
Perfect.

522
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:16,520
So imagine combining your typewriter
with your television set.

523
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:21,192
No. Don't... Wait. Wait!

524
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:24,125
Wait. Please, sir,
don't, don't hang up.

525
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:29,959
Yes. We are small
right now, but we...

526
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:34,238
How do you know we're
working out of our garage?

527
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:36,407
Who told you that?

528
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,076
Ahhh!

529
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,980
Yes. Yes.

530
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:46,549
Well, thank you
for taking the time.

531
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:52,555
Yes, sir. Apple Computer.

532
00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:56,886
Apple? Yes, like the fruit.

533
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:00,662
Who's that?

534
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:06,164
No. No. All I'm asking is
that you come visit us.

535
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,769
One meeting and I promise
you'll be on board.

536
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:13,769
Around $50,000
would be my guess.

537
00:37:15,602 --> 00:37:16,945
Hello?

538
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:26,184
What did they say?

539
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,880
What the hell is
the matter with people?

540
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,546
Take it the call went well.

541
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:58,221
I would say I hope you choke, but that
burrito is gonna kill you either way.

542
00:37:58,378 --> 00:37:59,823
Oh, come on, Steve.

543
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:01,756
Cool yourjets, man.

544
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:03,319
Excuse you?

545
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:05,990
Just, you know, you're
so stressed, you know?

546
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:08,066
It's, like,
relax for a change.

547
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:11,561
For a change... Why? Why? So I can
be more like you two assholes?

548
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:15,129
Hey. I'm studying integrated
circuit design here, man.

549
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:16,400
Are you?

550
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:19,003
We each do our part.

551
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:22,740
Really? Then why do I suddenly
feel like your part is expendable?

552
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,677
Out here smokin' up like we're in India.
Well, wake up! We're not.

553
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:31,781
What happened to you?

554
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:33,514
You used to be...
What'? I used to be what?

555
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:35,183
Motivated.
lam motivated.

556
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,590
Really? Then show me.

557
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,960
This is a business, Daniel.

558
00:38:39,286 --> 00:38:41,857
And I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

559
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:46,263
I'm in there making
a hundred phone calls.

560
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,863
Rod is slaving away.

561
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:51,105
The kid always finds
something to do,

562
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,438
and God knows Woz
pulls his weight.

563
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:53,534
Thank you.

564
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,112
And that's
a whole lot of weight.

565
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:57,614
That really... That kind
of hurts my feelings.

566
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,015
Whoa.

567
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:14,291
Is this the right...

568
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:16,860
APP“? Computer?

569
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:19,394
Yeah, this is us.
Yeah.

570
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:20,630
You expecting something else?

571
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:26,905
Uh, no. Well, yeah, maybe something
a little less Manson Family.

572
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:29,711
It's a startup.
Yeah.

573
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:31,515
I'm Mike Markkula.

574
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:34,007
Steve. Jobs.

575
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:36,221
Steve. I heard
a lot about you.

576
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:38,855
You spoke to Don Valentine
on the phone.

577
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:40,585
He and I are old
colleagues of sorts.

578
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:42,890
The VC from Atari.

579
00:39:43,016 --> 00:39:45,826
Yeah, Valentine. He said
you called him 150 times.

580
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:47,229
Jesus.

581
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,233
He practically begged me to come
and look at your outfit here.

582
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:51,734
Called in
a personal favor.

583
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,663
Well, Mark.

584
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:54,831
Mike.

585
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,374
Mike.

586
00:39:58,198 --> 00:39:59,677
Welcome to Apple Computer.

587
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,677
Thank you.
Yeah, is this...

588
00:40:03,503 --> 00:40:04,504
This is everything?

589
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,845
Yes.
No.

590
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,284
No. We're, we're in six stores
in the greater area.

591
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:11,346
We'll be launching the
Apple ll in about a month.

592
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,413
In a few months.
It's close.

593
00:40:13,513 --> 00:40:16,687
Gentlemen, is there
some place we can talk?

594
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:23,099
Here you are, fellas.

595
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,762
For you.

596
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:29,305
Steve's a fruitarian.
He will only eat fruit.

597
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:33,444
Okay, boys. I'll leave
you to your business.

598
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:34,568
Thank you.

599
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:36,305
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Mrs. J.

600
00:40:36,403 --> 00:40:37,643
You're the best.

601
00:40:37,737 --> 00:40:41,082
Yeah. So where were we?

602
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:45,055
I'm sorry, don't take this the
wrong way, but what's your angle?

603
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,146
Uh...

604
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:47,782
What my colleague is
trying to say is...

605
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:49,224
Where was your
last employment?

606
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,089
Intel.

607
00:40:58,224 --> 00:40:59,635
So how much are we
talking about here?

608
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:01,636
What, the investment? That's
what you came here for.

609
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,833
Foreplay is not
Steve's strong suit.

610
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,136
Isn't it?

611
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:07,643
Yeah, well,

612
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:13,578
I've been looking for something
to really sink my teeth into.

613
00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:24,088
Look, Steve. I'm willing
to take the risk.

614
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,097
And, this
certainly qualifies.

615
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,265
But risk disguised
as promise.

616
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:31,629
And you've shown promise.
I've seen it in your eye,

617
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:33,931
and I know that look
because I've had it myself.

618
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:37,207
Tells me you're
onto something big.

619
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,948
Yeah. Okay. To the point.

620
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:48,950
I think we should start
with around 90 grand,

621
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,114
see where that takes us.

622
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:55,559
Okay, I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that?

623
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:56,956
I'm sorry.

624
00:41:57,617 --> 00:41:59,392
$90,000 isn't
gonna get it done.

625
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:01,659
Oh, whoa, whoa. Wait.
Steve, one second.

626
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:03,995
I don't see anybody else coming
in your garage with a checkbook.

627
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:05,296
Oh, no, no.

628
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:07,804
Ninety grand
gets it done for us.

629
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,205
I just don't think it
gets it done for you.

630
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,640
We'll do the
$90,000 investment.

631
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,907
At a $300,000 valuation.

632
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:18,482
But I also want you to kick
in a $250,000 credit line

633
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,882
with 10% interest to
be paid back in full

634
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:23,648
once we meet
net revenue positive.

635
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:34,158
0K3?'-

636
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:39,765
What I mean is, okay.

637
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:43,199
Yeah.

638
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:47,402
Now, the first thing
you need to do

639
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,505
is incorporate, so that you two as
owners can protect your interest.

640
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:56,449
And that is, of course,
if you'll have me aboard.

641
00:42:58,545 --> 00:42:59,853
Thank you very much,
Mr. Markkula.

642
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,722
Of course. Mike. Yeah.

643
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:03,020
How're you doing'?
Yeah, put her there.

644
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,357
- Bill.
- Bill?

645
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:05,418
- Fernandez.
- Yeah.

646
00:43:05,518 --> 00:43:07,020
Oh. Thanks, Mike.
Yeah.

647
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,124
Steve. Here's to you, pal.

648
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:22,413
<i>Are you
even listening to me?</i>

649
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:24,640
I'm pregnant.

650
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:29,444
Steve, you have
to talk to me.

651
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:33,554
This is your
responsibility, too.

652
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:37,887
Don't you dare

653
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:39,892
blame this on me.

654
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:44,063
I'm not.
Mmm-mmm.

655
00:43:45,892 --> 00:43:49,237
We both had
our moments of...

656
00:43:49,762 --> 00:43:51,264
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

657
00:43:51,397 --> 00:43:52,569
You.

658
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:58,772
When I was in India,
you were with, you know.

659
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:01,779
Steve? Are you crazy? You
cannot put this all on me.

660
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:05,311
You can't do this to me
right now. Not now.

661
00:44:05,745 --> 00:44:08,089
Well, I'm sorry this
isn't part of your plan.

662
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:10,492
I'm sorry you
have a problem.

663
00:44:11,951 --> 00:44:13,624
But it's not
happening to me.

664
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:16,260
But this is your...
No!

665
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:20,460
Get out of my house.

666
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,966
What?
Now!

667
00:44:25,798 --> 00:44:27,607
Oh, Jesus. Here we go.

668
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:39,983
Hey. ls everything
okay out here?

669
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,659
Steven, he's kicking me out.

670
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:47,958
He doesn't want
anything to do with me.

671
00:44:52,325 --> 00:44:54,635
Maybe
it's for the best.

672
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:57,971
You don't deserve to be treated
the way he treats you.

673
00:44:58,131 --> 00:44:59,974
I'm pregnant, Daniel.

674
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,073
What? You're.4.

675
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:06,039
He says it's not his,
but I would never...

676
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:11,912
What did I do wrong?

677
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:18,023
You didn't do
anything wrong.

678
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:21,193
It's Steve.

679
00:45:22,188 --> 00:45:23,826
That's just him.

680
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,203
He changed.

681
00:46:49,175 --> 00:46:51,781
Hook them right
to your television.

682
00:46:59,285 --> 00:47:00,992
It is, yeah.

683
00:47:07,427 --> 00:47:09,703
What do you think, J?
Ready?

684
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:26,119
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Steve Jobs.

685
00:47:27,146 --> 00:47:28,989
When I founded
this company,

686
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:31,224
I had one goal in mind.

687
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:35,197
And that was to do what nobody
else considered possible.

688
00:47:35,888 --> 00:47:38,232
To put the power
and the beauty

689
00:47:38,324 --> 00:47:40,634
of the world's most
advanced technology

690
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,633
in the hands and homes of
people just like you and me.

691
00:47:45,465 --> 00:47:48,412
And I can promise you
that after today,

692
00:47:49,302 --> 00:47:52,044
you will never look at
computers the same way again.

693
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:57,313
So I am proud to introduce
to you, and the world,

694
00:47:57,977 --> 00:48:00,583
the future of
personal computing.

695
00:48:01,414 --> 00:48:03,917
The revolutionary Apple ll.

696
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:30,004
Gotta just start over.
It has to be intuitive.

697
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,981
Precognitive. I mean, I want
it to know what you want to do

698
00:49:34,073 --> 00:49:35,916
before you even know
you want to do it.

699
00:49:36,008 --> 00:49:37,817
Wait, are we still talking
about the command prompts?

700
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,255
Bill, we're talking about everything.
The whole thing.

701
00:49:41,848 --> 00:49:45,762
Lisa. Guys, it's the future.
I'm telling you right now.

702
00:49:45,818 --> 00:49:49,698
<i>I mean, Lisa's
gonna do for the next 10 years</i>

703
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,826
what the Apple ll
did for the last three.

704
00:49:52,258 --> 00:49:54,101
I can tell you
that right now.

705
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,936
Do you know why
people buy an Apple?

706
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,776
Why do they buy an Apple,
not the competitor?

707
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,103
Because it's got bravado.

708
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:05,510
It's social status.

709
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:07,016
No, you know what?
It's even more than that.

710
00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:08,449
It's social currency.

711
00:50:09,108 --> 00:50:10,678
We've raised the bar.

712
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:16,516
And if we want to stay there,
we gotta risk everything.

713
00:50:17,617 --> 00:50:22,965
Great artists, Dylan, Picasso,
Newton, they risk failure.

714
00:50:23,623 --> 00:50:27,230
And if we want to be great,
we've gotta risk it, too.

715
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:28,831
On the command bar?

716
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:29,965
On everything.

717
00:50:29,996 --> 00:50:32,169
What... And it
starts with the little things.

718
00:50:32,231 --> 00:50:33,869
There's over 20
different functions

719
00:50:33,966 --> 00:50:36,344
tied to even' single variation
of the command bar,

720
00:50:36,402 --> 00:50:38,507
which by the way,
takes weeks to program.

721
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:41,814
We're not doing anything that
IBM's not already doing.

722
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:45,484
And I would rather
gamble on our vision

723
00:50:45,978 --> 00:50:48,720
than make a me-too product.

724
00:50:48,814 --> 00:50:52,853
We got to make the small
things just unforgettable.

725
00:50:53,352 --> 00:50:55,593
Let's just start with something simple.
LisaWrite.

726
00:50:55,688 --> 00:50:58,498
What happens if I click
on one of these tabs?

727
00:50:58,558 --> 00:51:01,164
You get a drop-down menu,
and then there's preferences,

728
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:02,433
and page options.

729
00:51:02,528 --> 00:51:04,064
Okay. Exactly.

730
00:51:04,897 --> 00:51:09,607
Now, which tab do I click on
to get different font styles?

731
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,183
How many custom typefaces
are there on LisaWrite?

732
00:51:20,513 --> 00:51:23,119
That's actually something that I wanted
to talk to you about, Steve, is...

733
00:51:23,215 --> 00:51:25,195
I've been asking for
the fonts for months.

734
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:27,458
But everything we're talking
about is conceptual.

735
00:51:27,553 --> 00:51:32,400
And I'm sorry, but typeface, it isn't
exactly a pressing issue right now.

736
00:51:34,393 --> 00:51:37,863
Everything is
a pressing issue.

737
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:42,877
If we want to make the
vision for Lisa a reality,

738
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:47,214
we gotta put in the hours
and make something great.

739
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:50,311
Yeah, but we have a hard
date on this software,

740
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:53,253
and I'm sorry, but adding pretty
fonts is not gonna change that.

741
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,918
Well, Bill'?

742
00:51:57,383 --> 00:52:00,956
If you don't share
our enthusiasm,

743
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:05,498
and care for the vision
of this company...

744
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:07,298
No, no, no, no. I just,
I'm not understanding...

745
00:52:07,393 --> 00:52:08,770
Get out.
What?

746
00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:12,266
Get your shit and get out.
What, wait...

747
00:52:12,331 --> 00:52:13,810
You're done.
What, you...

748
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:15,139
What, are you gonna,
you're gonna fire me?

749
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:16,338
No!

750
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:18,437
I already fired you!

751
00:52:19,939 --> 00:52:21,976
Why are you still here?

752
00:52:29,782 --> 00:52:32,262
Sieve, he was our best
programmer in the division.

753
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,822
He's the best programmer that
doesn't care about our vision.

754
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:38,802
Okay. Look, I know ifs not
my place to say it, but...

755
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:40,496
Then shut
the hell up, Bill!

756
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,795
Yeah.

757
00:52:42,328 --> 00:52:44,330
So sorry to interrupt
you, Mr. Jobs,

758
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,036
but your attorney is
here for your 8:00.

759
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,144
All right.

760
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:53,608
I want to see samples
this afternoon.

761
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:58,986
Somehow we managed to design a word
processor that doesn't have fonts.

762
00:52:59,712 --> 00:53:02,124
And it can't happen again.

763
00:53:03,482 --> 00:53:05,189
So fix it!

764
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:22,205
2:00 to 3:00. And
your 10:00 is waiting for you.

765
00:53:25,805 --> 00:53:27,512
Steve. Steve, hey.

766
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:29,987
Daniel. Hey.

767
00:53:30,042 --> 00:53:32,352
Do you have
a second to talk?

768
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:37,049
I thought we rescheduled.

769
00:53:37,483 --> 00:53:39,360
It'll only take a second.

770
00:53:40,186 --> 00:53:41,597
That's what everyone says.

771
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:42,757
Steve.

772
00:53:48,594 --> 00:53:49,834
Fine.

773
00:53:50,996 --> 00:53:54,603
I don't have a lunch, so' meet
me at Good Earth at noon.

774
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:56,904
Okay. Cool.
Okay.

775
00:53:57,603 --> 00:53:58,843
What are you
working on these days?

776
00:53:59,271 --> 00:54:00,511
Oh, um.-.

777
00:54:00,773 --> 00:54:02,946
Apple ll Plus repairs, mainly.

778
00:54:04,376 --> 00:54:05,548
Right.

779
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:14,927
<i>I need you to sign this.</i>

780
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,522
<i>It legally preserves
your visitation rights.</i>

781
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:20,969
<i>I don't want them.
Lisa Brennan is not my child.</i>

782
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,130
<i>The courts disagree.</i>

783
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:27,439
Chris-Ann is a lunatic. It's impossible.
At the very least, improbable.

784
00:54:27,533 --> 00:54:28,773
You knew going into this

785
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,872
the paternity test could prove
that you were the father.

786
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:34,312
There are 24 million
people in California.

787
00:54:34,406 --> 00:54:36,113
That test has a five
percent margin of error.

788
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:39,553
That's 1.2 million people that
could be the father of that child.

789
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:41,489
It's not me.

790
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:47,254
You don't need to convince me.
But you do need to sign this.

791
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,630
Miss Brennan is entitled
to your child support

792
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:53,499
regardless of whether
you sign it or not.

793
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:57,070
Do you really want to give
up the rights to see your...

794
00:54:57,129 --> 00:54:59,837
To see her child
in the future?

795
00:54:59,932 --> 00:55:01,809
I don't have time.

796
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:03,436
Not now.

797
00:55:03,502 --> 00:55:06,972
Steven, as a father, I
implore you to sign this.

798
00:55:07,606 --> 00:55:10,815
Regardless of whether you think
Lisa is your daughter or not.

799
00:55:11,477 --> 00:55:13,582
There's no risk in signing.

800
00:55:14,013 --> 00:55:16,584
Only the regret
if you don't.

801
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:29,672
<i>Frederick Rodney Holt,
he recently made</i>

802
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:32,101
an additional
preferred purchase

803
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:36,943
of 106,656 shares
at 19 cents a share.

804
00:55:37,436 --> 00:55:39,143
Right, and to be clear,
this new purchase,

805
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:41,116
it does not affect
Mr. Holfs entitlement to

806
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:42,952
founder stock.

807
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:44,851
No, not at all. Steve?

808
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:47,049
No, no, no.
Rod gets his due.

809
00:55:47,947 --> 00:55:48,982
Daniel Kottke,

810
00:55:49,048 --> 00:55:53,190
<i>engineering technician, founding employee.
Now, at our last meeting I,</i>

811
00:55:53,853 --> 00:55:55,799
I don't believe that
we meta consensus

812
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:59,667
as to Mr. Kottke's entitlement
to founder stock.

813
00:56:00,693 --> 00:56:02,900
Well, in all honesty,
to be rewarding Daniel

814
00:56:02,995 --> 00:56:05,168
with the same amount
of stock as Rod seems

815
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:07,404
a bit unfair.
Doesn't it?

816
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:11,507
Yes. Daniel gets nothing.

817
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:13,074
Nothing?

818
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:14,709
Don't you think
you should

819
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:16,844
think about what you're
doing, for a second?

820
00:56:17,142 --> 00:56:20,316
I have thought about it.
Daniel gets nothing.

821
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,351
Yes, sir.

822
00:56:22,414 --> 00:56:23,893
It's noted.

823
00:56:24,984 --> 00:56:26,361
What?

824
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:29,393
Any low grade technician
could do his job.

825
00:56:29,488 --> 00:56:32,435
I've been feeding him for years.
It's not personal.

826
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:34,902
Don't give me that bullshit, Steve.
Of course it's personal.

827
00:56:34,994 --> 00:56:36,200
He can barely do hisjob.

828
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:37,502
If we give Daniel
preferred stock,

829
00:56:37,563 --> 00:56:40,407
some engineer with 10 times
his talent gets nothing.

830
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:41,569
Then what happens?

831
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:43,704
Then we just draw this line
right here, right now, okay?

832
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,874
So you, what are you talking about?
Management, or...

833
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:47,246
Management and engineers.

834
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:48,340
Yeah, this means...

835
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:50,512
I know what it means, Mike.

836
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,183
Thanks.

837
00:56:53,545 --> 00:56:55,786
No, he's...
You know what, I don't...

838
00:56:57,216 --> 00:56:59,093
Okay then.
Shall we continue?

839
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,723
<i>We can assume
that Bill Fernandez,</i>

840
00:57:01,787 --> 00:57:03,095
Randy Wiggington

841
00:57:03,188 --> 00:57:04,963
and Chris Espinosa will not

842
00:57:05,057 --> 00:57:06,434
<i>be receiving</i>

843
00:57:06,525 --> 00:57:08,061
an)' options?

844
00:57:30,749 --> 00:57:32,228
Drinking a beer, huh?

845
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:36,798
Tomorrow's
a big day for you.

846
00:57:38,057 --> 00:57:39,434
For us.

847
00:57:40,426 --> 00:57:41,734
For us.

848
00:57:43,729 --> 00:57:48,269
Mike told me about what
happened with Bill and Dan

849
00:57:49,635 --> 00:57:54,448
and Chris. And, Steve...

850
00:57:56,475 --> 00:57:57,681
Why'd you do it?

851
00:57:57,943 --> 00:58:00,184
The company outgrew them.

852
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:03,123
They're not management.
They're not project leads.

853
00:58:03,816 --> 00:58:05,420
It's not my job to
be nice to people.

854
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:07,088
It's my job to
make them better.

855
00:58:07,486 --> 00:58:08,863
They don't deserve it.

856
00:58:08,954 --> 00:58:10,831
Then who the hell does?

857
00:58:10,923 --> 00:58:12,163
Do you know how
this company works?

858
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:14,164
Do you want to know?

859
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:16,933
I'd be happy to teach you,
if you want to know.

860
00:58:19,098 --> 00:58:22,272
Do you know why I started
this company with you?

861
00:58:23,435 --> 00:58:27,508
Why I left the safety
of HP for this?

862
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:30,314
I doubt you do.
You never asked.

863
00:58:32,444 --> 00:58:34,651
I left because
this was my thing.

864
00:58:35,114 --> 00:58:37,617
And you guys thought
it was cool.

865
00:58:38,283 --> 00:58:40,854
I just wanted to be
one of the guys.

866
00:58:43,622 --> 00:58:48,799
And of all the guys I knew,
you were the coolest.

867
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:52,475
You were smart,
quick-witted.

868
00:58:53,532 --> 00:58:56,479
And this was my chance
to do what I loved.

869
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,314
And to do it for fun.

870
00:59:02,207 --> 00:59:04,653
That's all, that's
all I ever wanted.

871
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:08,021
I thought that's what
you wanted, too.

872
00:59:12,151 --> 00:59:14,654
Somethings happened
to you, Steve.

873
00:59:16,055 --> 00:59:17,728
I'm grown up, Woz.

874
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:23,169
No. No, you're not.

875
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:52,894
<i>And now, turning to
big news in business,</i>

876
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,802
<i>Apple Incorporated is making
headlines once again.</i>

877
00:59:55,894 --> 00:59:57,532
<i>On Wall Street
the tech titan Apple</i>

878
00:59:57,596 --> 01:00:00,099
<i>went public this morning,
to incredible market interest,</i>

879
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:03,271
<i>as four point six million
shares of its IPO</i>

880
01:00:03,368 --> 01:00:05,405
<i>were sold within an hour
of the opening bell.</i>

881
01:00:05,737 --> 01:00:07,876
<i>Wall Street executives
had forecast the big clay</i>

882
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,442
<i>for the growing
technology company,</i>

883
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:11,452
<i>but experts now
say Apple's day</i>

884
01:00:11,543 --> 01:00:13,386
<i>exceeded the market's
wildest expectations.</i>

885
01:00:13,712 --> 01:00:15,055
<i>It was the most over...</i>

886
01:00:33,732 --> 01:00:35,473
Hey, hey. Here he is!

887
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:38,747
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, terrific.

888
01:00:47,412 --> 01:00:49,016
Yeah, you did it.

889
01:00:49,414 --> 01:00:50,859
Let's help
them move that stock.

890
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:52,289
Hey, pal.

891
01:00:52,684 --> 01:00:54,254
Oh, hey, thank you.

892
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:57,961
Business as usual, guys.

893
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:09,869
There's work to
be done, people.

894
01:01:10,302 --> 01:01:13,806
Thank you.
I had some fun ideas.

895
01:01:14,773 --> 01:01:16,810
KOTTKEI This is it for me, Bill.
I'll see you when I see you.

896
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:18,320
I'm gonna get out of here.

897
01:01:18,377 --> 01:01:19,617
I'll call you later.

898
01:01:19,678 --> 01:01:20,884
All right.

899
01:01:40,399 --> 01:01:43,846
Hi. Could you please tell
Mr. Markkula we're here. Thank you.

900
01:01:43,902 --> 01:01:45,745
Yes, sir, Mr. Rock.

901
01:01:51,977 --> 01:01:53,047
Gentlemen.

902
01:01:53,145 --> 01:01:54,818
Mike. Please.

903
01:01:56,982 --> 01:01:58,222
Have a seat.

904
01:02:00,352 --> 01:02:01,695
There's something we
need to talk about,

905
01:02:01,753 --> 01:02:04,666
and I don't think
you're gonna like it.

906
01:02:05,357 --> 01:02:06,893
It's Steve.

907
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:09,199
He's hemorrhaging
the company's dollar

908
01:02:09,328 --> 01:02:12,605
on fantasies that simply are not
possible with the Lisa computer.

909
01:02:13,765 --> 01:02:15,745
Yeah, but Steve's been
doing the impossible

910
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:17,780
ever since this company
was in a garage.

911
01:02:18,203 --> 01:02:21,616
<i>Mike, I love everything
Steve represents. You know that.</i>

912
01:02:21,873 --> 01:02:25,286
<i>But he's like a kid in a candy
store, and we've given him the keys.</i>

913
01:02:25,377 --> 01:02:28,847
Yeah.
But, it's his candy store.

914
01:02:29,181 --> 01:02:31,559
You're never gonna see
a personal computer

915
01:02:31,883 --> 01:02:34,090
where the keyboard is attached
to the machine again.

916
01:02:34,186 --> 01:02:35,790
<i>Mike, it's a problem.</i>

917
01:02:35,887 --> 01:02:39,562
The bigger problem is that
he is ridiculing IBM.

918
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:43,639
<i>Jobs took out a full page ad
in The Wall Street Journal</i>

919
01:02:43,729 --> 01:02:46,972
taunting the biggest computer
company on the planet.

920
01:02:47,532 --> 01:02:50,411
"Congratulations on your
first personal computer."

921
01:02:50,569 --> 01:02:53,482
He's trying to start
a war with IB fucking M!

922
01:02:53,772 --> 01:02:55,251
I'm fully aware of the ad.

923
01:02:55,307 --> 01:02:56,650
Then do something
about it!

924
01:02:56,742 --> 01:02:59,052
Listen, Arthur,
you know he's right.

925
01:02:59,144 --> 01:03:02,250
Three years ago IBM had no
interest in the personal computer

926
01:03:02,314 --> 01:03:03,622
and now look at 'em!

927
01:03:03,715 --> 01:03:05,991
They followed us.
Think about it.

928
01:03:06,151 --> 01:03:07,391
We have, Mike.

929
01:03:07,753 --> 01:03:09,994
And I'm sorry, but the
Board is unanimous.

930
01:03:10,555 --> 01:03:13,229
Steve will no longer be involved
in Lisa's development. Period.

931
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:17,734
<i>What is this, Arthur?
Some sort of power play?</i>

932
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:20,267
<i>For 18 months now you've
offered nothing but support.</i>

933
01:03:20,832 --> 01:03:23,779
And now you want to try and
take Jobs off of his own team?

934
01:03:26,571 --> 01:03:29,017
I don't want
any of this, Mike.

935
01:03:29,608 --> 01:03:30,814
But you have to
try to look at it

936
01:03:30,909 --> 01:03:32,820
from the shareholder's
perspective.

937
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:34,254
Steve is great.

938
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,851
He's great.
Yeah, he's great.

939
01:03:36,948 --> 01:03:38,427
But he's a time bomb.

940
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:41,356
And it's ourjob
to diffuse him.

941
01:03:42,754 --> 01:03:44,028
So take care of it.

942
01:03:47,259 --> 01:03:49,466
I don't give a shit
what the Board thinks.

943
01:03:49,594 --> 01:03:52,973
It's the time you're taking. Your perfectionism.
It's, it's, it...

944
01:03:53,098 --> 01:03:54,668
<i>They're looking at
losses in the millions</i>

945
01:03:54,766 --> 01:03:56,302
before this thing
even gets off the ground.

946
01:03:58,537 --> 01:04:01,484
They're not seeing
the big picture.

947
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,111
That's right. The shareholders
don't see past their own shadows.

948
01:04:04,176 --> 01:04:05,985
They're only concerned
about the here and the now.

949
01:04:06,044 --> 01:04:07,819
And the Board has
got blinders on.

950
01:04:07,946 --> 01:04:08,981
If they could see you
they'd take them off,

951
01:04:09,114 --> 01:04:10,320
they'd see you
the way I see you.

952
01:04:10,382 --> 01:04:11,520
The way your
employees see you.

953
01:04:11,616 --> 01:04:13,618
Lisa is my project.

954
01:04:14,553 --> 01:04:15,554
It's mine.

955
01:04:16,154 --> 01:04:18,828
And they're taking
it away from me?

956
01:04:22,394 --> 01:04:24,203
You're letting them
take it away from me.

957
01:04:24,296 --> 01:04:26,708
Bullshit, Steve.
You know that's not true.

958
01:04:29,968 --> 01:04:31,311
Shit.

959
01:04:40,412 --> 01:04:43,325
<i>There are more
Apple H's reaching more subjects</i>

960
01:04:43,382 --> 01:04:45,191
<i>in more schools than
any other computer...</i>

961
01:04:47,085 --> 01:04:50,328
<i>Everything from alphabet
lessons for preschool,</i>

962
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:53,165
<i>to science programs
for graduate school.</i>

963
01:04:53,825 --> 01:04:55,827
<i>So whatever Brian wants to be,</i>

964
01:04:56,261 --> 01:04:57,569
<i>an Apple personal computer</i>

965
01:04:58,597 --> 01:05:00,406
<i>can help him be it.</i>

966
01:05:00,932 --> 01:05:03,913
<i>The Apple II. There's no telling
how far it can take you.</i>

967
01:05:21,753 --> 01:05:23,198
<i>Now that doesn't
make any sense.</i>

968
01:05:23,255 --> 01:05:26,759
<i>Well, you haven't seen as
much of murder as I have, Mr. Cross.</i>

969
01:05:26,858 --> 01:05:30,305
<i>I'd rather have a judge give me the
works than have to do n' myself.</i>

970
01:05:30,695 --> 01:05:31,935
<i>Right here in solitary.</i>

971
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,100
<i>So what?</i>

972
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:36,771
<i>So you go right on punishing yourself.
You can't get away with it.</i>

973
01:05:41,306 --> 01:05:42,614
<i>Hi, I'm Gabe Kaplan.</i>

974
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:45,288
<i>Take the Pepsi Challenge. Let your
taste decide.</i>

975
01:05:45,444 --> 01:05:47,947
<i>Right, guys? Okay, now
why don't you tell me</i>

976
01:05:48,046 --> 01:05:50,549
<i>which one you chose.
Pepsi Cola.</i>

977
01:05:51,283 --> 01:05:53,058
<i>Yeah?
Hey, Steve. It's Mike.</i>

978
01:05:53,385 --> 01:05:54,455
Hey.

979
01:05:54,553 --> 01:05:57,557
<i>Hey. Um, I think I ma y have
found a project for you.</i>

980
01:05:57,722 --> 01:05:59,633
<i>It's more of an R&D
outcast than anything,</i>

981
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:02,000
<i>but it's actually a project
you approved some time back.</i>

982
01:06:02,093 --> 01:06:03,902
<i>Why don't you look into it?</i>

983
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:12,010
So this is
the Macintosh team.

984
01:06:12,103 --> 01:06:13,241
Mmm-hmm.

985
01:06:13,572 --> 01:06:15,108
Oh, Jesus.

986
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:17,084
Nope. It's just Steve.

987
01:06:17,576 --> 01:06:19,453
It's really good
to see you, Steve.

988
01:06:20,245 --> 01:06:23,658
Bill Atkinson. It's good to see
they got A players over here.

989
01:06:23,748 --> 01:06:25,591
Mmm-hmm. Hey. Get up.

990
01:06:30,622 --> 01:06:32,192
Hi, Steve Jobs.

991
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,325
What's your name?

992
01:06:33,425 --> 01:06:34,995
Burr...
Burrell Smith.

993
01:06:35,093 --> 01:06:36,333
Burrell Smith.

994
01:06:36,995 --> 01:06:38,030
Oh, sorry for the mess.

995
01:06:38,129 --> 01:06:40,666
We're just a bunch
of degenerates. So...

996
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:42,277
It's okay.
I like degenerates.

997
01:06:42,334 --> 01:06:43,369
Yeah.

998
01:06:44,302 --> 01:06:45,337
Who's your project lead?

999
01:06:45,637 --> 01:06:47,048
Uh, JefRaskin...

1000
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,547
I don't know where he is.

1001
01:06:50,642 --> 01:06:52,144
Jef Raskin.

1002
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:57,449
Okay. I'll deal with that one.
I'll be taking over now.

1003
01:06:58,517 --> 01:07:03,489
Um... Sorry, taking over, like,
the entire Macintosh project?

1004
01:07:04,222 --> 01:07:05,997
Yeah.
Awesome.

1005
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:09,839
Where's your design team?

1006
01:07:12,631 --> 01:07:14,042
Team? I don't...

1007
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,845
Show me
your current build.

1008
01:07:19,804 --> 01:07:22,375
Well, obviously ease
of use is a big feature here.

1009
01:07:22,474 --> 01:07:24,078
We're trying to develop
a simpler interface

1010
01:07:24,175 --> 01:07:27,054
that's geared towards
the real layman end user.

1011
01:07:28,313 --> 01:07:31,590
But, we're kind of struggling with
the interface, and, to be frank...

1012
01:07:31,683 --> 01:07:33,253
The results have been.“

1013
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:35,062
Shit.
Yeah.

1014
01:07:35,153 --> 01:07:36,154
What's it got
under the hood?

1015
01:07:37,355 --> 01:07:38,595
Standard kick ass stuff.

1016
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:39,896
Sixty-four K RAM...

1017
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:42,870
Two fifty-six bitmap
display, Motorola 6809.

1018
01:07:43,595 --> 01:07:45,404
We're gonna run the 68000.

1019
01:07:45,497 --> 01:07:47,909
But dude,
that's Lisa's processor.

1020
01:07:47,999 --> 01:07:50,343
That's correct. Dude.

1021
01:07:51,236 --> 01:07:53,512
I don't care what the budget is.
Give me their processor.

1022
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,113
Done.

1023
01:07:56,341 --> 01:07:57,911
Hey, Steve.

1024
01:07:58,209 --> 01:07:59,381
How are you, man?

1025
01:08:02,113 --> 01:08:03,217
Chris, it has been a...

1026
01:08:03,281 --> 01:08:04,282
Yep.

1027
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:06,688
You're working on the Macintosh?
Yeah.

1028
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:08,959
Good.

1029
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:11,529
Good, this is
gonna be fun.

1030
01:08:18,563 --> 01:08:21,100
Okay. Let's go back to what
you were saying before.

1031
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,112
This thing is for
the everyman. Right?

1032
01:08:24,436 --> 01:08:25,881
That's our end user.

1033
01:08:27,305 --> 01:08:29,114
It's the school teacher.

1034
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:30,584
It's the garbage man.

1035
01:08:30,642 --> 01:08:35,091
It's the kid. it's some grandma
out in Nebraska. Right?

1036
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,993
So we need to make
this thing simple.

1037
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:42,390
It's gotta work like...

1038
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:45,561
like an appliance.

1039
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:49,467
Hey, Jef.

1040
01:08:49,561 --> 01:08:50,801
Steve Jobs is here.

1041
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:54,106
Since you weren't around...

1042
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,971
Some of the project leads were
having a meeting with Motorola.

1043
01:08:59,971 --> 01:09:01,279
Why exactly are you here?

1044
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,412
I'm here to help
build the Macintosh.

1045
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:09,083
Ah. I'm not sure that
that's practical for us.

1046
01:09:09,147 --> 01:09:12,094
We're actually trying
to avoid this project

1047
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:14,926
becoming another
over bloated disaster.

1048
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,763
Okay, Jef.

1049
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,966
You got my attention.

1050
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:30,941
Look, Steve.

1051
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:34,773
You didn't want to be involved
back when we started this thing,

1052
01:09:34,839 --> 01:09:37,046
and that was fine by me.

1053
01:09:37,342 --> 01:09:39,686
I just wanted you
to cut the checks.

1054
01:09:39,778 --> 01:09:42,349
Be involved,
just don't tum Macintosh

1055
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:44,950
into a measure of
revenge for you.

1056
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:48,724
Everyone knows about your
fallout with Team Lisa.

1057
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:53,166
So trust me when I say,
we're doing fine.

1058
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,169
Okay, Jef.

1059
01:09:59,964 --> 01:10:01,375
Let's get
a couple things straight.

1060
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:06,675
We don't do fine.

1061
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:10,019
And we don't accept things
the way that they are,

1062
01:10:10,075 --> 01:10:13,386
and we don't
stop innovating.

1063
01:10:14,713 --> 01:10:17,057
Now, your machine lacks power.

1064
01:10:17,315 --> 01:10:19,818
And your little interface,
it needs work.

1065
01:10:19,884 --> 01:10:21,261
And I'm here
to help with that.

1066
01:10:21,853 --> 01:10:25,528
Now, I'm not trying to take
Macintosh away from you.

1067
01:10:25,824 --> 01:10:28,703
I want you on this team.

1068
01:10:28,993 --> 01:10:32,998
But you can either get on board,
or you can get the fuck out.

1069
01:10:41,172 --> 01:10:44,449
Okay. Now, we've got a lot of work to do.
So, let's get to it.

1070
01:10:44,542 --> 01:10:46,021
Bill, you come with me.

1071
01:10:46,077 --> 01:10:47,750
Okay. Where are we going?

1072
01:10:47,846 --> 01:10:48,881
Recruiting.

1073
01:10:49,948 --> 01:10:51,120
Shit.

1074
01:10:54,452 --> 01:10:55,624
Hey, Steve.
Hold these for a second'

1075
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,199
Yeah.
Thanks.

1076
01:10:57,255 --> 01:10:59,565
What, what's going on?
What are you doing?

1077
01:11:00,592 --> 01:11:02,299
Steve? You're on the
Macintosh Team now.

1078
01:11:02,393 --> 01:11:06,273
What, Ste...
What's a Macintosh?

1079
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:10,478
Andy Hertzfeld.

1080
01:11:10,568 --> 01:11:11,945
Are you good?

1081
01:11:12,036 --> 01:11:14,710
I only want good people
working on Macintosh,

1082
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,915
and I'm not sure
if you're good enough.

1083
01:11:18,109 --> 01:11:19,110
Excuse me?

1084
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:21,588
Bill Atkinson says
that you're good.

1085
01:11:22,046 --> 01:11:24,549
I... Yes.
I think I'm pretty good.

1086
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:25,650
Are you creative?

1087
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:26,888
. I think so.

1088
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:29,431
Welcome to the Macintosh Team.

1089
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:38,641
<i>I'm tired of saving
your ass, kid.</i>

1090
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,073
You love saving my ass.

1091
01:11:40,131 --> 01:11:41,838
I want my own
engineering team.

1092
01:11:41,933 --> 01:11:43,640
You can pick them yourself.

1093
01:11:44,102 --> 01:11:47,311
And I am done
working under the gun

1094
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:50,579
of your ridiculous
deadline bullshit.

1095
01:11:50,742 --> 01:11:53,245
You might as well be asking
for a date with her.

1096
01:11:53,578 --> 01:11:55,455
I want that, too.

1097
01:11:55,513 --> 01:11:56,821
Done.

1098
01:11:56,915 --> 01:11:58,417
Serious, Steve.

1099
01:12:00,652 --> 01:12:03,258
So what is this, Steve? Some
sort of performance review?

1100
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:04,425
How are things
going on the IIE?

1101
01:12:04,923 --> 01:12:07,335
Things are great.
Really great.

1102
01:12:07,425 --> 01:12:08,665
You're bored to death,
aren't you?

1103
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,171
Yes. Yes I am.

1104
01:12:13,264 --> 01:12:14,607
You want to come work
with me on the Mac Team?

1105
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:17,442
You're trying to recruit me
for the Mac Team, aren't you?

1106
01:12:17,502 --> 01:12:19,004
Okay, I'm in.

1107
01:12:24,642 --> 01:12:27,521
You've gotta have a problem
that you want to solve.

1108
01:12:27,612 --> 01:12:29,285
A wrong that
you want to right.

1109
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,553
And it's gotta be something
that you're passionate about,

1110
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:34,630
because othenuise you won't have the
perseverance to see it through.

1111
01:12:34,786 --> 01:12:38,029
I don't ever want to hear you tell
me that you can't make it faster.

1112
01:12:38,122 --> 01:12:40,728
I mean, millions of people
are gonna buy this machine.

1113
01:12:40,825 --> 01:12:42,964
And we can't look
at the competition

1114
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:45,029
and say we're
gonna do it better.

1115
01:12:45,129 --> 01:12:48,736
We have to look at the competition and
say we're gonna do it differently.

1116
01:12:49,133 --> 01:12:53,639
We have an opportunity to build
a revolutionary machine.

1117
01:12:53,905 --> 01:12:56,647
<i>And in your life you only
get to do so many things.</i>

1118
01:12:56,808 --> 01:13:00,255
<i>Right now we've
chosen to do this.</i>

1119
01:13:00,478 --> 01:13:02,515
<i>So let's make it great.</i>

1120
01:13:30,341 --> 01:13:31,513
It's great.

1121
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:36,623
No. It's not.

1122
01:13:37,882 --> 01:13:39,691
It's insanely great.

1123
01:13:47,525 --> 01:13:49,562
We should try to get more
memory into it if we can.

1124
01:13:51,062 --> 01:13:52,439
We can still hit the timeline.

1125
01:13:53,965 --> 01:13:55,239
Take a look at it.

1126
01:13:56,367 --> 01:13:59,143
This little Macintosh side project
has gotten out of hand, Steve.

1127
01:13:59,237 --> 01:14:00,739
Way beyond the pale.

1128
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:04,909
First you created a $10,000
monstrosity with Lisa,

1129
01:14:04,976 --> 01:14:06,819
and now you've
poured millions

1130
01:14:06,911 --> 01:14:08,720
into what was supposed
to be a minor diversion.

1131
01:14:09,447 --> 01:14:11,290
You've missed
multiple ship dates,

1132
01:14:11,716 --> 01:14:14,595
and meanwhile, IBM is
just purring along.

1133
01:14:15,086 --> 01:14:16,326
Steve...

1134
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:19,095
People don't use computers
the way you think they do.

1135
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:22,164
How are we even supposed
to market the Macintosh?

1136
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,800
We don't

1137
01:14:25,296 --> 01:14:28,402
You give me five candidates for CEO.
You're gonna let me choose.

1138
01:14:28,466 --> 01:14:30,343
I say we choose someone
with a marketing background

1139
01:14:30,435 --> 01:14:32,142
to help us sell
what's never been sold.

1140
01:14:32,503 --> 01:14:35,848
Now, while I would like
to run my own company,

1141
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:40,411
Mike has helped me understand
that you don't think I'm ready.

1142
01:14:41,112 --> 01:14:42,648
Yes, because you're not.

1143
01:14:42,747 --> 01:14:43,782
0K3?'-

1144
01:14:44,282 --> 01:14:45,659
I want John Sculley.

1145
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:47,589
John Sculley?

1146
01:14:47,652 --> 01:14:49,188
President of Pepsi Cola.

1147
01:14:49,287 --> 01:14:50,425
The Pepsi Challenge guy.

1148
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:53,431
He's smart,
he's a marketing genius

1149
01:14:53,925 --> 01:14:55,598
and he'll do whatever
it takes to succeed.

1150
01:14:55,927 --> 01:14:57,372
Steve, Sculley
is a tough get.

1151
01:14:57,829 --> 01:14:59,206
Maybe the toughest
on our list.

1152
01:14:59,764 --> 01:15:02,142
What the hell makes you
think you can get him?

1153
01:15:03,768 --> 01:15:05,441
Why would he
ever leave Pepsi?

1154
01:15:08,306 --> 01:15:11,617
Nobody remembers the world's
best soda salesman.

1155
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:30,299
I need somebody I can trust.

1156
01:15:33,531 --> 01:15:35,807
<i>You can
make a great product.</i>

1157
01:15:37,068 --> 01:15:38,513
But you have to
convince people

1158
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:41,209
that what you're
selling is greater.

1159
01:15:41,672 --> 01:15:45,347
We're not selling computers.
We're selling what they can do

1160
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:47,648
with a computer.

1161
01:15:47,912 --> 01:15:50,017
A tool for the mind.

1162
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:54,323
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,

1163
01:15:55,019 --> 01:15:56,760
is limitless.

1164
01:15:57,422 --> 01:15:59,402
Because people will
never stop believing

1165
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:01,436
that they could get
more out of something,

1166
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:06,006
whether it be their jobs,
their marriage, their money,

1167
01:16:06,164 --> 01:16:07,939
their lives.

1168
01:16:08,032 --> 01:16:10,273
That's what you have
to do with the Mac.

1169
01:16:10,835 --> 01:16:13,008
It's the belief
in the limitless.

1170
01:16:13,938 --> 01:16:15,679
The impossible.

1171
01:16:15,873 --> 01:16:19,514
That no matter what you
dream, you can do it.

1172
01:16:20,378 --> 01:16:22,221
And Mac will
help you get there.

1173
01:16:23,414 --> 01:16:26,395
A few months ago, when Steve
was visiting me in Manhattan,

1174
01:16:26,451 --> 01:16:29,557
he asked me a very important question.
He said,

1175
01:16:31,022 --> 01:16:33,263
"Do you want to sell sugar water
for the rest of your life,

1176
01:16:33,357 --> 01:16:37,430
"or come with me,
and change the world?"

1177
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,542
Well,

1178
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:46,244
here I am. Thank you.

1179
01:17:09,727 --> 01:17:12,901
<i>It is now 1984.</i>

1180
01:17:13,397 --> 01:17:17,311
<i>It appears IBM wants it all.</i>

1181
01:17:18,002 --> 01:17:20,608
<i>Apple is perceived
to be the only hope</i>

1182
01:17:20,671 --> 01:17:23,242
<i>to offer IBM
a run for its money.</i>

1183
01:17:23,741 --> 01:17:28,019
<i>Will Big Blue dominate the
entire computer industry?</i>

1184
01:17:28,346 --> 01:17:29,416
No!

1185
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:32,425
<i>The entire information age?</i>

1186
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:33,918
No!

1187
01:17:34,652 --> 01:17:39,260
<i>Was George Orwell
right about 1984?</i>

1188
01:17:39,991 --> 01:17:41,664
No!

1189
01:17:42,026 --> 01:17:43,664
<i>Today
we celebrate the first</i>

1190
01:17:44,262 --> 01:17:48,267
<i>glorious anniversary of the
Information Purification Directives.</i>

1191
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:52,280
<i>For the first time
in all history,</i>

1192
01:17:52,937 --> 01:17:55,941
<i>a garden of pure ideology,</i>

1193
01:17:56,274 --> 01:17:58,447
<i>where each worker may bloom,</i>

1194
01:17:58,509 --> 01:18:00,455
<i>secure from the pests.</i>

1195
01:18:00,611 --> 01:18:02,955
<i>Our enemies shall
talk themselves to death.</i>

1196
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,963
<i>First time in all history.</i>

1197
01:18:12,456 --> 01:18:13,799
<i>We shall...</i>

1198
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:15,732
<i>prevail.</i>

1199
01:18:17,061 --> 01:18:21,373
<i>On January 24th, Apple
Computer will introduce Macintosh</i>

1200
01:18:21,632 --> 01:18:26,741
<i>and you'll see why 1984
won't be like 1984.</i>

1201
01:18:59,403 --> 01:19:00,711
Good work.

1202
01:19:08,012 --> 01:19:09,582
Some response, huh'?
I can't believe it.

1203
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,886
It's a revolution.
It's a revolution.

1204
01:19:11,015 --> 01:19:12,255
The thing's
a game changer.

1205
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:14,227
You really outdid
yourself, Steve.

1206
01:19:14,285 --> 01:19:17,357
Hey. Why don't you
give me a call?

1207
01:19:18,389 --> 01:19:20,130
Grab some dinner or something.
Yeah.

1208
01:19:20,224 --> 01:19:22,204
Okay.
I'd like that.

1209
01:19:22,893 --> 01:19:24,236
Steve.
Arthur.

1210
01:19:24,362 --> 01:19:25,432
Great job up there.

1211
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:26,701
Thank you.

1212
01:19:27,765 --> 01:19:30,939
Steve, I want you to know
that we believe in you.

1213
01:19:32,403 --> 01:19:33,882
I hope you know that.

1214
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:37,048
Thank you, Arthur.

1215
01:19:47,418 --> 01:19:48,624
Hey.

1216
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,221
What was that?

1217
01:19:50,821 --> 01:19:51,925
What...

1218
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:53,093
Rock. He just...

1219
01:19:54,225 --> 01:19:55,727
Said something,
"we believe in you."

1220
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,403
What's going on?

1221
01:19:58,729 --> 01:19:59,969
It's the Macintosh.

1222
01:20:00,064 --> 01:20:01,566
You know, we had
them run the numbers

1223
01:20:01,632 --> 01:20:03,077
100 different ways,
100 times over...

1224
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:04,976
- You're marking up the Macintosh.
- Yep'

1225
01:20:05,069 --> 01:20:08,073
If we keep it as is, we'll be
hemorrhaging money by launch date.

1226
01:20:11,776 --> 01:20:13,756
You're gonna price out
the consumer.

1227
01:20:14,078 --> 01:20:15,648
Well, we can't take the risk
of flattening our profits.

1228
01:20:15,746 --> 01:20:16,816
No.

1229
01:20:16,914 --> 01:20:18,359
We can't have it both ways.

1230
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:20,986
I mean, you insisted on the
most expensive hardware.

1231
01:20:21,085 --> 01:20:22,655
The Mac was originally
much cheaper.

1232
01:20:22,753 --> 01:20:25,666
Jef Raskin
designed a $1,000 box.

1233
01:20:25,756 --> 01:20:27,030
I made it great.

1234
01:20:27,124 --> 01:20:29,001
If you want the company
to remain profitable...

1235
01:20:29,093 --> 01:20:30,595
Whose idea was this?

1236
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:37,310
It's a group decision.

1237
01:20:38,602 --> 01:20:40,479
Whose idea was this?

1238
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:47,520
It was mine. Not Michael's,
not the Board. It was me.

1239
01:20:50,314 --> 01:20:54,387
We don't do this, John.
IBM does this shit.

1240
01:20:54,485 --> 01:20:56,396
Steve...
Not Apple. Not me.

1241
01:20:56,487 --> 01:20:58,160
Look, don't make me
the villain because

1242
01:20:58,222 --> 01:21:00,566
I'm looking out for our
company's best interests.

1243
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:01,898
Steve.

1244
01:21:04,295 --> 01:21:06,206
Some things have to change.

1245
01:21:09,533 --> 01:21:12,070
If you keep heading
down this path,

1246
01:21:12,737 --> 01:21:14,648
I will not be able
to protect you.

1247
01:21:16,907 --> 01:21:18,648
They got to you.

1248
01:21:25,316 --> 01:21:26,420
They?

1249
01:21:52,877 --> 01:21:54,254
How'd you get this?

1250
01:21:54,845 --> 01:21:59,419
Arrived yesterday. It's pre-beta,
obviously, but it's all...

1251
01:21:59,517 --> 01:22:01,394
It's a blatant rip-off.

1252
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:13,473
Get me Bill Gates
on the phone.

1253
01:22:13,931 --> 01:22:17,936
Let me make this
perfectly clear, Bill.

1254
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:23,441
So that when I'm finished, you
can still see through those

1255
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:28,217
thick pretentious glasses, you
psychopathic, unimaginative criminal.

1256
01:22:31,282 --> 01:22:37,790
You stole my software,
and I can prove it in court.

1257
01:22:38,722 --> 01:22:43,569
And I'm gonna sue you for every
cent that you have ever made.

1258
01:22:43,961 --> 01:22:48,137
And I will make it my life's mission
to see to it that you never,

1259
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:49,669
neven

1260
01:22:49,767 --> 01:22:53,738
ever make another dollar that
I don't first take 90 cents.

1261
01:22:56,941 --> 01:23:00,354
I can only assume that you
are all as irate as I am,

1262
01:23:00,444 --> 01:23:03,618
and you're simply
too dumbfounded to speak.

1263
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:06,417
Mr. Jobs promised
us a million units.

1264
01:23:06,584 --> 01:23:08,257
We have yet to reach
a quarter of that.

1265
01:23:08,486 --> 01:23:10,124
Something has to change.

1266
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:13,527
With two failed projects,
overextended R&Ds,

1267
01:23:13,624 --> 01:23:15,001
and that Microsoft fiasco,

1268
01:23:15,292 --> 01:23:18,466
we're about to experience the first
quarterly loss in company history.

1269
01:23:18,796 --> 01:23:20,776
IBM beat us to market
by two years

1270
01:23:20,831 --> 01:23:23,141
with a better product
and better sales.

1271
01:23:23,267 --> 01:23:26,271
The Macintosh is not even a toy.
It's a joke.

1272
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:29,273
IBM has now moved
on to mini decks.

1273
01:23:29,974 --> 01:23:31,453
And so should we.

1274
01:23:33,277 --> 01:23:35,484
What are you
getting at, Arthur?

1275
01:23:36,313 --> 01:23:39,055
Gentlemen, I believe
it's time to reconsider

1276
01:23:39,149 --> 01:23:41,857
the viability of
the personal computer.

1277
01:23:45,823 --> 01:23:47,803
Steve, anything to say?

1278
01:23:51,829 --> 01:23:53,536
What would you
have me say, Arthur?

1279
01:23:55,132 --> 01:23:56,475
You raised our price.

1280
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,979
Don't put that on me.

1281
01:23:59,036 --> 01:24:02,745
The problem is not the price, Steve.
It's your product.

1282
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:04,551
You over-hyped the Mac.

1283
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:08,679
You told people to wait. You sold
the future of the Macintosh.

1284
01:24:09,346 --> 01:24:11,519
And as a result we lost
two years of sales.

1285
01:24:11,582 --> 01:24:12,925
It's not my fault.

1286
01:24:13,017 --> 01:24:14,997
Well, it sure as shit
is somebody's fault.

1287
01:24:15,152 --> 01:24:16,825
Well, I'm not
receiving any support.

1288
01:24:17,855 --> 01:24:19,732
You're stripping
me of my resources,

1289
01:24:19,823 --> 01:24:21,496
and dumping millions
into the Apple ll.

1290
01:24:21,559 --> 01:24:24,267
Do you know why we keep dumping
millions into the Apple II?

1291
01:24:24,361 --> 01:24:29,333
Because it sells. It's 70% of our revenue.
How's the Mac doing?

1292
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,108
I made my opinion
perfectly clear.

1293
01:24:32,202 --> 01:24:35,843
If you want to keep sucking on the
tailpipe of IBM, then I can't stop you.

1294
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,783
But I will not take the blame for
the failures of some courtjester.

1295
01:24:40,544 --> 01:24:41,750
All right,
this is crazy, Steve...

1296
01:24:41,845 --> 01:24:44,689
No. No, no. To whom are
you referring, Steve?

1297
01:24:45,349 --> 01:24:46,919
I don't know, Arthur.

1298
01:24:47,051 --> 01:24:48,587
You tell me.

1299
01:24:53,691 --> 01:24:55,864
John, you're awfully quiet.

1300
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:00,465
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1301
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,546
I guess I'm just
at a loss for words.

1302
01:25:05,736 --> 01:25:08,910
Head of marketing.
Pepsi genius.

1303
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:10,877
Loss for words.

1304
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:14,886
It's him. Not the Mac.

1305
01:25:18,048 --> 01:25:19,652
But the cost
of that process...

1306
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:30,436
$10,000 price tag.
That price tag...

1307
01:25:38,168 --> 01:25:40,239
Goes against him,
and not against Mac.

1308
01:25:40,971 --> 01:25:42,780
It's ironic, isn't it'?

1309
01:25:44,975 --> 01:25:48,582
You chose Dylan, I chose,
I chose The Beatles.

1310
01:25:48,646 --> 01:25:50,523
Seems so backward now.

1311
01:25:50,614 --> 01:25:51,752
Woz.

1312
01:25:52,483 --> 01:25:54,156
What are you doing here?

1313
01:25:55,786 --> 01:25:57,493
Good to see you,
too, Steve.

1314
01:25:57,588 --> 01:26:00,091
I'm... I'm a little bit busy.

1315
01:26:00,758 --> 01:26:02,829
Just, do you mind
if we talk later?

1316
01:26:02,926 --> 01:26:05,964
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This'll
only take a minute.

1317
01:26:07,698 --> 01:26:08,938
I, uh...

1318
01:26:09,633 --> 01:26:11,476
I'm leaving, Steve.

1319
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:13,976
0K3?'-

1320
01:26:15,105 --> 01:26:16,948
No. No, Steve.

1321
01:26:18,776 --> 01:26:20,221
I'm leaving Apple.

1322
01:26:22,046 --> 01:26:25,050
For good. Actually,
I already did. I just...

1323
01:26:25,783 --> 01:26:28,696
I thought I should come
back and tell you first.

1324
01:26:29,553 --> 01:26:30,861
Why?

1325
01:26:34,858 --> 01:26:38,635
We both knew this was coming
for some time. I don't even...

1326
01:26:38,696 --> 01:26:41,199
I don't even remember
the last time we talked.

1327
01:26:43,534 --> 01:26:45,036
What do you want
from me, then?

1328
01:26:47,137 --> 01:26:49,310
Not everyone has
an agenda, Steve.

1329
01:26:51,308 --> 01:26:52,582
Right.

1330
01:26:56,013 --> 01:26:59,483
You know, I can still remember
when we were just kids,

1331
01:27:00,317 --> 01:27:02,092
back in your dads garage.

1332
01:27:04,321 --> 01:27:05,561
And we just wanted to

1333
01:27:05,656 --> 01:27:09,263
create cool toys for people like us.
You remember that?

1334
01:27:10,661 --> 01:27:11,867
Yeah.

1335
01:27:12,262 --> 01:27:15,334
Now it's not about
people anymore for you.

1336
01:27:15,432 --> 01:27:17,708
No, it's about the product.

1337
01:27:19,103 --> 01:27:21,014
Worst of all, it's...

1338
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,014
It's about yourself.

1339
01:27:25,609 --> 01:27:29,250
You're the beginning and end
of your own world, Steve.

1340
01:27:31,181 --> 01:27:35,596
And it's so small. So sad.

1341
01:27:37,955 --> 01:27:41,402
And it's...it's
gotta be lonely.

1342
01:27:43,193 --> 01:27:45,537
And I know you're gonna say

1343
01:27:46,196 --> 01:27:48,540
that the product
and the person

1344
01:27:48,599 --> 01:27:50,875
need to be connected
and all that,

1345
01:27:50,934 --> 01:27:54,814
but it will never be
what you think it will.

1346
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,049
It just won't.

1347
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,818
No, not' not for
a long time at least.

1348
01:28:03,313 --> 01:28:07,090
I don't know what you think
is going on, Steve, but I do.

1349
01:28:07,584 --> 01:28:09,996
And it doesn't
end well for you.

1350
01:28:12,589 --> 01:28:14,591
And I'm not...

1351
01:28:15,926 --> 01:28:18,497
I'm not sticking
around to watch.

1352
01:28:22,299 --> 01:28:24,301
It's been a journey.

1353
01:28:28,472 --> 01:28:30,748
And for the record,

1354
01:28:34,778 --> 01:28:36,519
I love what we did.

1355
01:29:32,369 --> 01:29:35,714
<i>Hi. You've reached John Sculley.
Please leave a message.</i>

1356
01:29:36,473 --> 01:29:39,147
Hey, John. It's Steve.

1357
01:29:39,743 --> 01:29:40,915
Uh...

1358
01:29:41,144 --> 01:29:42,589
I just...

1359
01:29:47,217 --> 01:29:50,096
We're still partners,
John, you and I.

1360
01:29:50,821 --> 01:29:52,994
We are, we're in
this together.

1361
01:29:53,156 --> 01:29:54,601
And I, um...

1362
01:29:58,495 --> 01:30:01,408
You just give me a call back?
Thafd be great. Um...

1363
01:30:13,277 --> 01:30:15,279
Hey, Mike. It's Steve.

1364
01:30:18,015 --> 01:30:20,393
Would you give
me a callback?

1365
01:30:22,185 --> 01:30:23,528
Please?

1366
01:30:31,728 --> 01:30:34,072
John, you have
to take control now.

1367
01:30:34,197 --> 01:30:36,973
Do you have any idea how close
our shareholders are to a panic?

1368
01:30:37,067 --> 01:30:39,547
The implications
of your inaction?

1369
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:43,881
Forget your job, the entire
company is at stake here.

1370
01:30:43,974 --> 01:30:45,419
This could ruin everyone.

1371
01:30:45,642 --> 01:30:47,986
I know, Arthur, but I still
think that we can salvage this.

1372
01:30:48,078 --> 01:30:50,217
Can't salvage anything.

1373
01:30:50,714 --> 01:30:51,920
I doubt...

1374
01:30:51,982 --> 01:30:53,290
Steve.

1375
01:30:54,885 --> 01:30:55,886
Mike.

1376
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:57,626
John.

1377
01:30:57,721 --> 01:30:58,722
Steve.

1378
01:30:58,889 --> 01:31:00,391
Arthur.

1379
01:31:00,891 --> 01:31:02,632
What the hell are you
doing here so early?

1380
01:31:03,327 --> 01:31:05,603
I could ask you
the same question.

1381
01:31:06,997 --> 01:31:08,670
This is good.

1382
01:31:08,765 --> 01:31:12,178
Steve, why don't you join us this time?
Have a seat.

1383
01:31:12,402 --> 01:31:13,608
This time?

1384
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,911
Steve, have a seat.

1385
01:31:24,581 --> 01:31:25,753
John?

1386
01:31:27,617 --> 01:31:29,119
Arthur, I don't want to. Yes.

1387
01:31:29,453 --> 01:31:32,434
You do. Say it.

1388
01:31:44,701 --> 01:31:46,840
Tell him what
you've told me.

1389
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:54,948
I find it increasingly
difficult to do my job

1390
01:31:56,947 --> 01:31:59,951
when the greatest
obstacle in my path

1391
01:32:01,551 --> 01:32:04,293
casts a looming shadow over
everything I try to do.

1392
01:32:11,962 --> 01:32:13,134
What did you say?

1393
01:32:14,664 --> 01:32:16,166
Steve...

1394
01:32:18,402 --> 01:32:20,541
You are your own worst enemy.

1395
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,820
And this company's.

1396
01:32:32,582 --> 01:32:34,994
This... It's unbelievable.

1397
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:38,390
Who do you think you are?

1398
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,504
I'm CEO of Apple Computer.

1399
01:32:52,903 --> 01:32:54,280
Hiring you

1400
01:32:54,905 --> 01:32:59,513
was the worst mistake
I have ever made.

1401
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:05,393
Steve, it doesn't
have to be this way.

1402
01:33:10,954 --> 01:33:12,524
Okay. That's done.

1403
01:33:13,356 --> 01:33:15,427
<i>Boards
don't run companies.</i>

1404
01:33:15,592 --> 01:33:18,937
The people who create the
product run the company.

1405
01:33:19,029 --> 01:33:21,441
He has the nerve to tell me
we should have used the 512.

1406
01:33:21,531 --> 01:33:22,771
We told them that
it needed a 512.

1407
01:33:22,866 --> 01:33:24,777
We said not to use the 128.

1408
01:33:24,868 --> 01:33:28,111
We knew 128 kilobytes wasn't gonna
get it done when we built it.

1409
01:33:28,205 --> 01:33:30,446
Sculley is leaving
for China tonight.

1410
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,781
He's gonna be there for
a week, so we got time.

1411
01:33:32,876 --> 01:33:34,150
We just gotta recruit.

1412
01:33:34,244 --> 01:33:35,780
Sieve, Sculley's
gonna find out.

1413
01:33:35,879 --> 01:33:38,120
And then what happens,
you know?

1414
01:33:38,215 --> 01:33:39,626
He's the CEO of
the company now.

1415
01:33:39,716 --> 01:33:40,820
Well, for now.

1416
01:33:40,917 --> 01:33:43,454
But we have the people
who make Apple.

1417
01:33:44,621 --> 01:33:45,725
Oh, hey, Mike.

1418
01:33:45,989 --> 01:33:47,991
We're just getting started.

1419
01:33:51,394 --> 01:33:53,465
Guys, give us a second.

1420
01:33:59,402 --> 01:34:00,676
John's canceled his trip.

1421
01:34:02,472 --> 01:34:06,249
He's having an executive staff
meeting first thing tomorrow.

1422
01:34:09,746 --> 01:34:12,920
So I didn't come to join your revolution.
I came to warn you.

1423
01:34:14,484 --> 01:34:16,157
He wants to make
absolutely sure

1424
01:34:16,253 --> 01:34:18,096
you're nothing more
than a figurehead.

1425
01:34:19,523 --> 01:34:21,127
No power, no title.

1426
01:34:21,658 --> 01:34:22,864
No team.

1427
01:34:29,766 --> 01:34:34,977
I remember thinking when we first
met, um, that you were remarkable.

1428
01:34:36,439 --> 01:34:38,851
You wanted to do
something truly great.

1429
01:34:40,177 --> 01:34:41,815
And I did, too.

1430
01:34:42,879 --> 01:34:44,552
I still do.

1431
01:34:45,615 --> 01:34:49,825
Raise the white flag. Concede to Sculley.
I'm begging you.

1432
01:34:50,287 --> 01:34:51,322
No.

1433
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:53,029
You can't win this one.

1434
01:34:53,123 --> 01:34:55,967
Whose side are
you on, Mike?

1435
01:34:56,726 --> 01:34:58,467
Because there are sides now.

1436
01:34:58,528 --> 01:35:01,304
And you're either with me
or you're against me.

1437
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,880
Are you with me, Mike?

1438
01:35:08,071 --> 01:35:10,915
Yes, Steve. I'm with you.

1439
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:13,646
0K3?'-

1440
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:17,651
0K3?'-

1441
01:35:25,488 --> 01:35:27,934
Those in favor
of John Sculley.

1442
01:35:42,272 --> 01:35:44,684
All in favor
of Steve Jobs.

1443
01:35:56,353 --> 01:35:57,627
Mike.

1444
01:35:57,721 --> 01:36:00,793
Every Board member's vote
must be accounted for.

1445
01:36:08,865 --> 01:36:10,139
Mike?

1446
01:36:18,141 --> 01:36:19,415
Sculley.

1447
01:36:23,613 --> 01:36:25,388
I vote for Sculley.

1448
01:36:58,915 --> 01:37:03,295
So, now what do we do?

1449
01:39:15,919 --> 01:39:18,559
<i>Apple's market value has
eroded in the past several years,</i>

1450
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:22,296
<i>which led to the ousting of former
chief John Sculley in 1993.</i>

1451
01:39:26,429 --> 01:39:28,340
<i>Ed Woolard,
former CEO of DuPont,</i>

1452
01:39:28,431 --> 01:39:30,274
<i>has joined Apple as
Chairman of the Board.</i>

1453
01:39:32,135 --> 01:39:35,776
<i>New CEO Gil Amelio says
sweeping changes are necessary.</i>

1454
01:39:37,674 --> 01:39:41,144
<i>Jobs' computer software company
NEXT, has entered into buyout talks</i>

1455
01:39:41,244 --> 01:39:43,155
<i>with his former company,
Apple Computer.</i>

1456
01:40:22,819 --> 01:40:26,130
Hey, will you wake up Lisa and
see if she wants breakfast?

1457
01:40:26,556 --> 01:40:27,796
Yeah.

1458
01:40:30,293 --> 01:40:31,567
Lisa?

1459
01:40:33,963 --> 01:40:36,170
Lisa? Come on.

1460
01:40:36,566 --> 01:40:38,807
Are you gonna
sleep all day, huh?

1461
01:40:39,068 --> 01:40:40,547
Oh, go away.

1462
01:40:40,637 --> 01:40:43,311
Why? I say all day
because it's 10:00.

1463
01:40:44,007 --> 01:40:45,247
Laurene made you breakfast.

1464
01:40:45,575 --> 01:40:47,316
I'm not hungry.

1465
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:51,321
Well, you can't sleep
all winter break.

1466
01:40:51,748 --> 01:40:52,988
Yes, I can.

1467
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,196
Reed! Reed!

1468
01:41:05,061 --> 01:41:07,667
Can we not run in the garden?
Please?

1469
01:41:09,098 --> 01:41:10,941
Thank you.

1470
01:41:13,036 --> 01:41:14,709
Were you able
to get Lisa up?

1471
01:41:17,073 --> 01:41:22,421
Well, how can a human
being sleep that much?

1472
01:41:25,248 --> 01:41:28,422
She... I don't know
if she's coming or not.

1473
01:41:29,285 --> 01:41:33,529
I'm going to the farmer's market today.
Just gonna get a few things.

1474
01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:35,897
You have any plans?
You want to come with me?

1475
01:41:42,198 --> 01:41:43,404
Hmm'?

1476
01:41:43,566 --> 01:41:45,307
I said do you have plans?

1477
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:46,436
Today?

1478
01:41:46,936 --> 01:41:50,884
Well, Gil Amelio
is gonna stop by.

1479
01:41:52,742 --> 01:41:55,416
They're transitioning in
some of our software.

1480
01:41:58,781 --> 01:41:59,953
0K3?'-

1481
01:42:01,384 --> 01:42:04,831
I'm... I'm just helping them out.
They just need a little help.

1482
01:42:09,225 --> 01:42:10,568
Oh, boy.

1483
01:42:11,828 --> 01:42:13,830
I'm in trouble,
aren't I?

1484
01:42:14,897 --> 01:42:18,071
Steve, what can I do to
convince you to come back?

1485
01:42:18,134 --> 01:42:19,408
What can you do
to convince me

1486
01:42:19,469 --> 01:42:22,450
I wouldn't be boarding
the Titanic, Gil?

1487
01:42:24,007 --> 01:42:29,457
Because I know how you feel aboutApple.
What NEXT could never be.

1488
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:33,290
Plus, you know, considering
that you now own

1489
01:42:33,349 --> 01:42:35,522
a million and a half
shares of Apple,

1490
01:42:35,618 --> 01:42:38,622
I mean, that's
a tangible investment, too.

1491
01:42:39,288 --> 01:42:41,199
You guys must be
pretty desperate.

1492
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:44,165
We're not desperate.

1493
01:42:45,795 --> 01:42:47,934
How are things going
with the Newton?

1494
01:42:48,665 --> 01:42:51,202
Look, don't blame me for the
failures of the last regime.

1495
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:53,280
It's not as bad
as you think.

1496
01:42:54,504 --> 01:42:56,848
You're overseeing
massive layoffs.

1497
01:42:56,939 --> 01:42:59,146
Apple stock just set
another record low.

1498
01:42:59,842 --> 01:43:02,846
And you're four months
from insolvency, Gil.

1499
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:04,556
I'd say that's pretty bad.

1500
01:43:05,181 --> 01:43:07,320
Well, yeah. In order
to fix what's broken,

1501
01:43:07,383 --> 01:43:09,624
some sacrifices
are necessary. All right?

1502
01:43:09,686 --> 01:43:12,360
Steve, what do you need?

1503
01:43:13,222 --> 01:43:14,292
Name it.

1504
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:39,187
Steve.
Gil.

1505
01:43:42,251 --> 01:43:43,252
Steve.

1506
01:43:44,487 --> 01:43:45,591
Mike.

1507
01:43:45,988 --> 01:43:47,490
It's nice to see you.

1508
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:55,573
Come on,
I'll show you around.

1509
01:43:55,665 --> 01:43:57,872
No, Gil, don't worry about it.
I'll give him the tour.

1510
01:43:58,267 --> 01:43:59,268
You sure?

1511
01:43:59,368 --> 01:44:01,848
Yeah, sure.
No problem. Come on.

1512
01:44:01,904 --> 01:44:03,406
That's great.

1513
01:44:04,907 --> 01:44:06,614
You guys go ahead. I'll...

1514
01:44:08,010 --> 01:44:09,683
I'll catch up.

1515
01:44:11,347 --> 01:44:13,520
<i>There's something I
always wanted you to know, Steve.</i>

1516
01:44:15,518 --> 01:44:17,259
It was never my call.

1517
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,894
Let's not do this, Mike.

1518
01:44:18,955 --> 01:44:22,095
No, this is important.
You know, I tried.

1519
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:26,306
I wanted you here.
I always did.

1520
01:44:26,729 --> 01:44:29,801
It's too bad it took me
so long to get you back.

1521
01:44:30,533 --> 01:44:31,910
Oh, I'm not back.

1522
01:44:32,702 --> 01:44:34,545
Yeah.
You will be.

1523
01:44:35,238 --> 01:44:36,444
We'll see about that

1524
01:44:36,539 --> 01:44:41,488
<i>You know, I'm gonna show myself around.
I'll take it from here.</i>

1525
01:44:46,783 --> 01:44:48,319
Son of a bitch.

1526
01:45:25,755 --> 01:45:27,291
Who did these?

1527
01:45:28,524 --> 01:45:30,128
I did, sir.

1528
01:45:34,797 --> 01:45:35,867
Who are you?

1529
01:45:36,799 --> 01:45:40,042
Jonathan Ive. I'm Director
of Industrial Design.

1530
01:45:42,004 --> 01:45:43,779
Why are you still here?

1531
01:45:45,107 --> 01:45:46,848
It's 11:00 a.m.
on a Monday.

1532
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:48,144
No.

1533
01:45:48,678 --> 01:45:52,956
Why are you
still here at Apple?

1534
01:45:53,816 --> 01:45:56,160
This isn't
the company I built.

1535
01:45:56,219 --> 01:45:59,063
There's no taste, no style.

1536
01:46:00,022 --> 01:46:01,729
No design.

1537
01:46:01,958 --> 01:46:06,134
So unless they're shackling
you here, why do you stay?

1538
01:46:09,866 --> 01:46:14,212
Well, sir, I guess I would
say there are still

1539
01:46:14,303 --> 01:46:16,340
those of us that believe
in what Apple stood for.

1540
01:46:18,241 --> 01:46:19,652
What you stood for.

1541
01:46:20,643 --> 01:46:22,520
What do you think
I stood for?

1542
01:46:24,313 --> 01:46:25,758
I think...

1543
01:46:28,417 --> 01:46:31,728
I think you believe
that the computer,

1544
01:46:31,821 --> 01:46:35,098
or the Walkman,
or whatever it may be,

1545
01:46:35,758 --> 01:46:38,534
should be a natural extension
of the individual.

1546
01:46:39,495 --> 01:46:41,497
And it's that mission,

1547
01:46:41,731 --> 01:46:47,113
that devotion to quality,
and ideals, and heart...

1548
01:46:49,338 --> 01:46:53,684
That's what keeps us here.
That we might do it once more.

1549
01:47:24,473 --> 01:47:26,885
Okay. Whatever
you're working on,

1550
01:47:27,543 --> 01:47:29,284
the rest of the day
I want you to forget it.

1551
01:47:31,314 --> 01:47:34,295
I want everyone to
design something new.

1552
01:47:34,917 --> 01:47:36,988
I don't care what it is, I
don't care if it's technology,

1553
01:47:37,086 --> 01:47:39,623
just create something.

1554
01:47:41,724 --> 01:47:43,294
Something useful.

1555
01:47:44,293 --> 01:47:45,738
Something you care about.

1556
01:47:54,637 --> 01:47:55,741
Steve.

1557
01:47:58,341 --> 01:48:00,252
We're glad you're back.

1558
01:48:01,911 --> 01:48:03,413
I'm not back.

1559
01:48:07,783 --> 01:48:08,989
Yet.

1560
01:48:21,831 --> 01:48:23,139
Steve.

1561
01:48:28,704 --> 01:48:30,206
Ugh!

1562
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:32,812
Junk.

1563
01:48:32,875 --> 01:48:34,980
Steve, you met
our Chairman, Ed Woolard.

1564
01:48:35,311 --> 01:48:37,018
Sieve.
Hi.

1565
01:48:40,649 --> 01:48:41,821
Look, um...

1566
01:48:41,984 --> 01:48:44,897
I know all about the bad
blood you must taste.

1567
01:48:44,987 --> 01:48:50,335
And I understand your hesitation to trust me.
But I just want you to know

1568
01:48:51,127 --> 01:48:54,540
lam not Arthur Rock.
I'm your friend.

1569
01:48:56,565 --> 01:48:57,669
0K3?'-

1570
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:01,807
So, can we take
a minute to talk?

1571
01:49:02,505 --> 01:49:03,506
Apparently.

1572
01:49:03,706 --> 01:49:04,741
Today/'s Paper-

1573
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,547
I'm sure you've
seen the news.

1574
01:49:08,377 --> 01:49:10,653
I'm sorry, Ed, you're gonna
have to be more specific.

1575
01:49:11,047 --> 01:49:15,393
Our shares dropped
7.5% overnight.

1576
01:49:16,018 --> 01:49:17,998
It's the lowest
it's been in 10 years.

1577
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,826
Last week
an unidentified investor

1578
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:23,666
dropped one point five
million shares.

1579
01:49:25,027 --> 01:49:27,940
Put a real scare into
the marketplace, Steve.

1580
01:49:28,697 --> 01:49:31,735
One point five
million shares? Wow.

1581
01:49:33,903 --> 01:49:36,850
I guess the stockholders
must be getting restless.

1582
01:49:38,774 --> 01:49:40,378
<i>We wan!
you here, Steve.</i>

1583
01:49:40,843 --> 01:49:43,289
I'm here.
As a consultant.

1584
01:49:43,779 --> 01:49:45,281
As CEO.

1585
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:48,724
CEO?
Yeah.

1586
01:49:48,784 --> 01:49:50,127
At least in the interim.

1587
01:49:51,287 --> 01:49:52,459
And Gil?

1588
01:49:52,555 --> 01:49:54,535
Yeah, well,
Gil's halfway out the door.

1589
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:57,131
He has to see
the writing on the wall.

1590
01:49:57,226 --> 01:49:59,433
At least if he's not
too proud to admit it.

1591
01:49:59,528 --> 01:50:03,601
Oh, he's going to try to force you
out, and make a case against you.

1592
01:50:03,699 --> 01:50:05,736
Where have I
seen this before?

1593
01:50:06,402 --> 01:50:08,473
Gil's on the ledge. He
doesn't have a play here.

1594
01:50:08,571 --> 01:50:11,074
All we need is
a little push from you.

1595
01:50:11,407 --> 01:50:14,047
If you want to get back what
you lost, this is the time.

1596
01:50:16,412 --> 01:50:20,155
I never lost it.
It was stolen from me.

1597
01:50:27,423 --> 01:50:31,235
There's no sex left in computers.
No curves.

1598
01:50:32,328 --> 01:50:35,468
Now, if computers are
for art, and beauty,

1599
01:50:35,564 --> 01:50:38,773
and global interconnectivity,
why are they so ugly?

1600
01:50:39,802 --> 01:50:43,147
You know, it should be artful.
But no one cares.

1601
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:48,645
The world may mistakenly see
computers only in black and white,

1602
01:50:49,645 --> 01:50:53,593
but we live, and we dream
and we paint in color.

1603
01:50:55,251 --> 01:50:57,697
And we think
the computer should, too.

1604
01:51:04,293 --> 01:51:05,533
What do you think?

1605
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,107
Jony, I always want you
to be honest with me.

1606
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,385
No matter what.

1607
01:51:20,276 --> 01:51:22,483
Just be brutally honest

1608
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:26,288
Understand?

1609
01:51:26,682 --> 01:51:28,218
Understand.

1610
01:51:30,786 --> 01:51:32,561
What do you think?

1611
01:51:34,456 --> 01:51:36,834
I think, I think the blue,

1612
01:51:39,528 --> 01:51:40,700
it's not quite right.

1613
01:51:43,132 --> 01:51:46,841
Here's a dopey idea. What if
we put the speakers inside?

1614
01:51:49,705 --> 01:51:51,912
Yeah, Steve,
Gil Amelio and the board

1615
01:51:52,007 --> 01:51:54,180
are not gonna allow that.
No way.

1616
01:51:57,313 --> 01:51:59,919
We're not gonna
ask for permission.

1617
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:03,330
Steve's done an admirable
job assisting me

1618
01:52:03,385 --> 01:52:06,059
as an advisor during
this, this period.

1619
01:52:06,322 --> 01:52:11,101
And while I commend his
actions, and his initiatives,

1620
01:52:11,594 --> 01:52:14,905
I believe it's now in our
best interest to move on,

1621
01:52:15,064 --> 01:52:18,841
and relieve Steve of his
advisory role in this company.

1622
01:52:20,402 --> 01:52:21,403
I agree, Gil.

1623
01:52:23,005 --> 01:52:24,075
You do?

1624
01:52:24,173 --> 01:52:28,019
I do think it's time Steve step
out of his current role, yes.

1625
01:52:29,111 --> 01:52:30,112
Steve?

1626
01:52:30,779 --> 01:52:31,780
Thank you, Ed.

1627
01:52:33,449 --> 01:52:37,591
I'd like to present the Board my
vision for the future of Apple.

1628
01:52:38,854 --> 01:52:41,130
We're not Microsoft or Dell.

1629
01:52:41,690 --> 01:52:44,364
So we need to stop
trying to be that.

1630
01:52:46,195 --> 01:52:51,406
We need to go back to who we
are, and what we do best,

1631
01:52:51,467 --> 01:52:53,947
and throw away
everything else.

1632
01:52:54,403 --> 01:52:55,438
Here's how
we're gonna do it.

1633
01:52:55,537 --> 01:52:57,312
We're gonna build
a new line of computers

1634
01:52:57,406 --> 01:52:59,215
for the home,
and for the office.

1635
01:53:00,042 --> 01:53:03,046
We're gonna build a new operating
system on the backbone of NEXT.

1636
01:53:04,446 --> 01:53:06,756
The next generation
of Macintosh.

1637
01:53:07,249 --> 01:53:10,059
And we're gonna kill
every other project.

1638
01:53:10,986 --> 01:53:12,124
Everything.

1639
01:53:12,221 --> 01:53:15,794
This company will not
make shit anymore.

1640
01:53:16,725 --> 01:53:19,103
We're also gonna double down
on the advertising budget.

1641
01:53:19,161 --> 01:53:22,665
Chiat Day will be the only
advertising agency we use.

1642
01:53:22,831 --> 01:53:24,811
Just like back
in the old days.

1643
01:53:25,567 --> 01:53:26,773
In short,

1644
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:29,947
we're gonna make
Apple cool again.

1645
01:53:31,307 --> 01:53:33,446
But I will not be
able to move forward

1646
01:53:34,576 --> 01:53:39,025
without the Board's permission to
operate under complete autonomy.

1647
01:53:39,848 --> 01:53:43,694
I'll be made a full voting member
of the Board. And lastly...

1648
01:53:46,488 --> 01:53:48,092
Interim CEO.

1649
01:53:51,093 --> 01:53:52,470
Now, hold on.

1650
01:53:53,829 --> 01:53:56,833
I'm the CEO, and this is...

1651
01:53:58,867 --> 01:54:01,177
Look, you put me
in this position.

1652
01:54:01,637 --> 01:54:06,017
Apple is like a ship with a hole in
the bottom, and it's leaking water.

1653
01:54:06,108 --> 01:54:08,054
And it's my job
to make sure that

1654
01:54:08,143 --> 01:54:10,214
we point the ship
in the right direction.

1655
01:54:10,312 --> 01:54:12,986
So why don't you
let me do my job?

1656
01:54:13,449 --> 01:54:15,690
All right, let's
put this to a vote.

1657
01:54:17,052 --> 01:54:18,554
Those in favor?

1658
01:54:26,562 --> 01:54:28,200
What the hell?

1659
01:54:29,365 --> 01:54:30,366
Ed?

1660
01:54:32,568 --> 01:54:33,569
Mike?

1661
01:54:34,203 --> 01:54:37,184
Sorry, Gil.
Nothing personal.

1662
01:54:46,915 --> 01:54:49,725
<i>When you grow up,
you tend to get told</i>

1663
01:54:49,818 --> 01:54:52,594
<i>the world is
the way that it is,</i>

1664
01:54:52,988 --> 01:54:55,867
<i>your life is just to live
your life inside the world</i>

1665
01:54:56,425 --> 01:54:59,497
<i>and try not to bash
into the walls too much.</i>

1666
01:54:59,695 --> 01:55:01,902
<i>But that's a very
limited life.</i>

1667
01:55:02,264 --> 01:55:04,210
<i>Life can be much broader,</i>

1668
01:55:04,266 --> 01:55:07,247
<i>once you discover one simple fact.</i>

1669
01:55:08,103 --> 01:55:10,583
<i>And that is that
everything around you</i>

1670
01:55:10,873 --> 01:55:12,375
<i>that you call life</i>

1671
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:15,882
<i>was made up by people that
are no smarter than you.</i>

1672
01:55:16,445 --> 01:55:19,426
<i>And you can change it.
You can influence it.</i>

1673
01:55:19,515 --> 01:55:23,088
<i>You can build your own things,
that other people can use.</i>

1674
01:55:23,185 --> 01:55:26,462
<i>It's to shake off
this erroneous notion</i>

1675
01:55:26,555 --> 01:55:27,966
<i>that life is just there,</i>

1676
01:55:28,056 --> 01:55:30,730
<i>and you're just gonna live
in it, versus embrace it.</i>

1677
01:55:30,793 --> 01:55:34,468
<i>Change it' Improve it.
Make your mark upon it.</i>

1678
01:55:34,563 --> 01:55:38,909
<i>And once you learn that, you'll
never be the same again.</i>

1679
01:55:40,736 --> 01:55:42,613
But in our cash position...

1680
01:55:42,704 --> 01:55:44,047
MARKKULAI Mr. CEO.

1681
01:55:44,773 --> 01:55:45,877
Mike.

1682
01:55:45,941 --> 01:55:48,046
You wanted
to talk to me?

1683
01:55:48,143 --> 01:55:50,453
Welcome. Please.
Have a seat.

1684
01:55:50,979 --> 01:55:52,788
Ed. Hey, Gareth.

1685
01:55:53,248 --> 01:55:54,249
Mike.

1686
01:55:58,787 --> 01:55:59,925
What's this?

1687
01:56:00,556 --> 01:56:01,660
It's an opportunity.

1688
01:56:03,992 --> 01:56:06,472
I haven't seen Bernard
around for a few days.

1689
01:56:06,562 --> 01:56:08,769
Wheres Katherine,
Delano?

1690
01:56:08,931 --> 01:56:12,310
Mr. Lewis and Mrs. Hudson made
a difficult decision easier

1691
01:56:12,801 --> 01:56:15,247
by agreeing to step
down from the Board.

1692
01:56:15,504 --> 01:56:16,505
Really?

1693
01:56:16,605 --> 01:56:20,781
They both agreed to accept incredibly
generous golden parachutes.

1694
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:24,653
The same opportunity is
detailed inside that envelope.

1695
01:56:25,514 --> 01:56:27,425
So you're forcing us out?

1696
01:56:27,816 --> 01:56:28,920
With good reason.

1697
01:56:28,984 --> 01:56:30,122
And what's that?

1698
01:56:30,185 --> 01:56:31,823
The current arrangement is

1699
01:56:33,288 --> 01:56:34,323
inhibiting.

1700
01:56:35,424 --> 01:56:37,995
I can't hold everyone's hand
while we cross the street, Mike.

1701
01:56:38,093 --> 01:56:40,869
And so your next big move
is to eradicate your Board?

1702
01:56:40,963 --> 01:56:42,465
And you think you
can just do that?

1703
01:56:42,531 --> 01:56:46,343
I'm sorry, Mike.
But it's time.

1704
01:56:47,269 --> 01:56:49,977
Take the parachute.
It's more than fair.

1705
01:56:57,980 --> 01:56:59,721
Twenty years.

1706
01:57:03,452 --> 01:57:05,557
You know, I told myself
I'd be out of here

1707
01:57:05,654 --> 01:57:07,725
while I was still
in my thirties.

1708
01:57:08,891 --> 01:57:13,135
And now look at me.
I'm practically an old man.

1709
01:57:22,137 --> 01:57:23,241
Gentlemen.

1710
01:57:24,006 --> 01:57:25,212
Thanks, Mike.

1711
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,590
So...

1712
01:57:40,856 --> 01:57:43,200
What are we gonna do now?

1713
01:57:50,899 --> 01:57:53,573
We're gonna put
a dent in the universe.

1714
01:58:03,345 --> 01:58:04,585
Here's to the crazy ones.

1715
01:58:06,715 --> 01:58:08,717
<i>The misfits,</i>

1716
01:58:09,117 --> 01:58:10,721
<i>the rebels,</i>

1717
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:13,361
<i>the troublemakers,</i>

1718
01:58:13,855 --> 01:58:16,392
<i>the round pegs
in the square holes,</i>

1719
01:58:17,426 --> 01:58:20,032
the ones who see
things differently.

1720
01:58:20,729 --> 01:58:22,538
<i>They're not fond of rules,</i>

1721
01:58:23,065 --> 01:58:26,205
<i>and they have no respect
for the status quo.</i>

1722
01:58:27,803 --> 01:58:29,908
You can quote them,

1723
01:58:29,972 --> 01:58:31,781
<i>disagree with them,</i>

1724
01:58:31,873 --> 01:58:33,910
<i>glorify or vilify them.</i>

1725
01:58:34,943 --> 01:58:36,581
<i>About the only thing
you can't do</i>

1726
01:58:37,245 --> 01:58:39,225
<i>is ignore them.</i>

1727
01:58:39,548 --> 01:58:41,255
<i>Because they change things.</i>

1728
01:58:41,917 --> 01:58:44,295
They push
the human race forward.

1729
01:58:45,754 --> 01:58:47,961
<i>And while some may see
them as the crazy ones,</i>

1730
01:58:51,059 --> 01:58:52,732
<i>we see genius.</i>

1731
01:58:53,895 --> 01:58:56,273
Because the people
who are crazy enough

1732
01:58:56,331 --> 01:58:58,675
to think they can
change the world

1733
01:59:00,402 --> 01:59:02,177
are the ones who do.

1734
01:59:10,178 --> 01:59:11,782
How was that?
