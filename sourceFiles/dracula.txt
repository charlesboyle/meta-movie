00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,001
<i>The year, 1462.</i>

3
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:45,504
<i>Constantinople had fallen.</i>

4
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,467
<i>Moslem Turks swept into Europe
with a vast superior force,</i>

5
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:53,679
<i>striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.</i>

6
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,140
<i>From Transylvania arose
a Romanian knight</i>

7
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,350
<i>of the Sacred Order of the Dragon</i>

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,936
<i>known as Dracula.</i>

9
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:21,832
<i>On the eve of the battle,
his bride, Elizabeta,</i>

10
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,169
<i>whom he prized
above all things on earth,</i>

11
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:29,548
<i>knew that he must face
an insurmountable force</i>

12
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:34,386
<i>from which he might never return.</i>

13
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:35,072
God be praised, I am victorious.

14
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,751
Elizabeta.

15
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,258
<i>The vengeful Turks
shot an arrow into the castle</i>

16
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:57,011
<i>carrying false news
of Dracula's death.</i>

17
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:03,058
<i>Elizabeta, believing him dead,
flung herself into the river.</i>

18
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,724
<i>My prince is dead.</i>

19
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,101
<i>All is lost without him.</i>

20
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:50,231
<i>May God unite us in heaven.</i>

21
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,704
She has taken her own life.

22
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,666
Her soul cannot be saved.

23
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,835
She is damned.

24
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,380
It is God's law.

25
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,891
Is this my reward
for defending God's church?

26
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,559
Sacrilege!

27
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,188
I renounce God!

28
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:36,193
I shall rise from
my own death

29
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,698
to avenge hers with all
the powers of darkness.

30
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:02,011
The blood is the life

31
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:06,807
and it shall be mine!

32
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:06,950
I've done everything
that you asked, master.

33
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:12,164
All the preparations are
in order. Everything.

34
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:16,877
I await your command,
for I know

35
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:21,173
that when the rewards
are given,

36
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,010
I will be one of those who
benefits from your generosity.

37
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,768
Thank you.

38
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,730
<i>Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.</i>

39
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,567
He's lost his greedy mind,
poorchap.

40
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,320
I want you to take over
for his foreign client,

41
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,406
this rather eccentric
Count Dracula.

42
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,908
He's buying up property
around London.

43
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,912
Of course, sir. I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

44
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,040
This is a great opportunity
for you, Harker.

45
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,252
You'll have to leave for
Transylvania immediately.

46
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,089
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

47
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,591
Yes, of course, sir.

48
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:10,013
If I may I enquire, what in fact happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

49
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,393
Nothing. Nothing.
Personal problems.

50
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,731
Close these transactions, and your
future with this firm is assured.

51
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,236
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

52
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,324
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

53
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,618
We can be married
when I return.

54
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,080
Ahem. Of course.

55
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,374
I'll write.

56
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,837
Jonathan. Jonathan.

57
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,012
Jonathan, I love you.
I love you, Mina.

58
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:24,129
<i>Twenty-fifth May, Budapest.
Left Budapest early this morning.</i>

59
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:29,676
<i>The impression I had was that we were
leaving the West and entering the East.</i>

60
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,764
<i>The district I am to enter is in
the extreme east of the country</i>

61
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,641
<i>just on the borders
of three states:</i>

62
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,227
<i>Transylvania, Moldavia
and Bukovina,</i>

63
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,562
<i>in the midst
of the Carpathian Mountains.</i>

64
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,441
<i>One of the wildest
and least known portions of Europe.</i>

65
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:52,616
<i>My friend,
welcome to the Carpathians.</i>

66
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,161
<i>I am anxiously expecting you.</i>

67
00:08:56,328 --> 00:09:01,917
<i>At the Borgo Pass, my carriage
will await you and bring you to me.</i>

68
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:06,964
<i>I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one</i>

69
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,136
<i>and that you will enjoy your stay
in my beautiful land.</i>

70
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:17,891
<i>Your friend, D.</i>

71
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,360
<i>Diary, 25th May.</i>

72
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,822
<i>My dear Jonathan
has been gone almost a week.</i>

73
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,742
<i>And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure,</i>

74
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,037
<i>I am happy that he got sent
on this important assignment.</i>

75
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,040
<i>I am longing to hear all the news.</i>

76
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,253
<i>It must be so nice
to see strange countries.</i>

77
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,718
<i>I wonder if we, I mean Jonathan
and I, shall ever see them together.</i>

78
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:10,027
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

79
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,654
For the dead travel fast.

80
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,857
I say, is the castle far?

81
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,482
Welcome to my home.

82
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:58,820
Enter freely of your own will and leave
some of the happiness you bring.

83
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:04,868
Count Dracula?
I am Dracula.

84
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:09,956
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

85
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,128
Come in.

86
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,021
You will, I trust, excuse me

87
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,399
that I do not join you.

88
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,862
But I have already dined,

89
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:45,158
and I never drink...

90
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,246
wine.

91
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,421
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

92
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,926
The order of the Dracul.

93
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,180
The Dragon.

94
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:13,436
An ancient society
pledging my forefathers

95
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:19,442
to defend the Church
against all enemies of Christ.

96
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:27,200
That relationship
was not entirely successful.

97
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,078
Oh, yes.

98
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,377
It is no laughing matter.

99
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,967
We Draculs have a right
to be proud.

100
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,761
What devil or witch
was ever so great as Attila

101
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:51,474
whose blood flows
in these veins?

102
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,813
Blood...

103
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:07,282
Is too precious a thing
in these times.

104
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:14,331
The warlike days are over.

105
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:22,172
The victories of my great race
are but a tale to be told.

106
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:30,931
I am the last
of my kind.

107
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:38,146
I have offended you with my
ignorance, count. Forgive me.

108
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:55,914
I do so long to go through the crowded
streets of your mighty London.

109
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,835
To be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity.

110
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:06,508
To share its life,
its changes, its death.

111
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,762
There. You, count, are--

112
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:17,519
Are the owner of Carfax Abbey
in Purfleet. Congratulations.

113
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:21,982
Your firm writes most
highly of your talents.

114
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,610
They say
you are a man of good...

115
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,154
taste.

116
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:34,619
And that you are a worthy
substitute to your predecessor,

117
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,955
Mr. Renfield.

118
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,958
You may rely on me,
count

119
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,418
Forgive my curiosity,

120
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,005
but why 10 houses in such precise
locations around London?

121
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,091
Is it to raise
the market value?

122
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,639
Do you believe in destiny?

123
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:01,146
That even the powers of time

124
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:06,818
can be altered
for a single purpose?

125
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,788
The luckiest man who walks
on this earth is the one who finds...

126
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,042
true love.

127
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:27,380
You found Mina.
I thought she was lost.

128
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,633
We're to be married
as soon as I return.

129
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,262
Are you married, count?

130
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,097
Sir, are you married?

131
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,058
I...

132
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,686
I was married once.

133
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,481
Ages ago, it seems.

134
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,275
She died.

135
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:53,073
Oh. I'm very sorry.
She was fortunate.

136
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,204
My life, at its best, is misery.

137
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,296
She will, no doubt,
make a devoted wife,

138
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,300
and you,
a faithful husband.

139
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,762
Come.

140
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:21,267
Write now, my friend,
to your firm and to any loved ones

141
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:27,982
and say that it should please you to
stay with me until a month from now.

142
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:34,405
A month? Do you wish me
to stay so long?

143
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:41,121
I will take no refusal.

144
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,510
<i>Diary, 30th of May,
1897.</i>

145
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:59,848
<i>I know that Jonathan does not want me to
stay here with Lucy while he is away.</i>

146
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,392
<i>He thinks that if I
become accustomed</i>

147
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,186
<i>to the wealth and privileges
of the Weston family,</i>

148
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:09,149
<i>I will not be content as the wife
of a mere clerk in a law firm.</i>

149
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,110
<i>But Lucy and I have been friends
since we were children.</i>

150
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:16,489
<i>And she has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.</i>

151
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,833
Oh, how disgustingly awful.

152
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,212
Mina.

153
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,340
Mina.

154
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,139
Oh, Mina,
you're always working.

155
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,099
Is your ambitious John Harker

156
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,811
forcing you to learn
that ridiculous machine?

157
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,314
When he could be
forcing you to perform

158
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,776
unspeakable acts of desperate
passion on the parlor ﬂoor.

159
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:58,823
Lucy, really. You shouldn't talk
about my fiancé in such a way.

160
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,452
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasures.

161
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:07,624
Oh, Mina. So I see.
Much, much more.

162
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,462
Oh. Oh, that's--

163
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,966
What is it, Lucy?

164
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,220
Oh, Mina.
Because I don't understand it.

165
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:25,058
Can man and woman
really do that?

166
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,437
I did. Only last night.
Fibber. You did not.

167
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:35,026
Yes, I did.
Well, in my dreams.

168
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:40,865
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he? You can tell Lucy.

169
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,576
We've kissed, that's all.

170
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,914
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

171
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,292
It's all the worse now that I'm here
visiting you at Hillingham,

172
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,044
my rich friend.

173
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:56,589
Yes, but not even one
marriage proposal.

174
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,217
And here I am, almost 20.

175
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,594
Practically a hag.

176
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,311
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

177
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,441
- Oh, look.
- What is that?

178
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,819
A Texan.

179
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,029
Quincey P. Morris.

180
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,949
He's so young and fresh,

181
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,326
like a wild stallion
between my legs.

182
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,453
You're positively indecent.

183
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,081
I just know what men desire.

184
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,583
Watch.
Lucy.

185
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,627
Quincey, darling.
Miss Lucy.

186
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,630
Why, you're as fresh
as the spring rain.

187
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,716
Oh, thank you.

188
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,927
Oh, Quincy.

189
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:46,222
Please let me
touch it.

190
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,268
It's so big.

191
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,814
Little girl.

192
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,151
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

193
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,403
I hold your hand,

194
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,822
and you've kissed me.
Jack!

195
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,702
Oceans of love--
Oh, Jack, my darling.

196
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,495
Oh, poor little baby.

197
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,539
My kitten,
come over here.

198
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,875
Come over here
and I'll kiss it better.

199
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,252
My poor little blossom.

200
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:19,505
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

201
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,507
Hello, Quincey.
Jack.

202
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,926
What a naughty bear.
Let me feel your--

203
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,263
Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
Arthur!

204
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,391
Oh, my darling.

205
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,977
Oh, you look wonderful.

206
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,938
I'm so sorry
about your hat.

207
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,940
Absolutely Charming.
It's my snake dress.

208
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,400
Is it really?

209
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,278
<i>Lucy is a pure
and virtuous girl,</i>

210
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:46,449
<i>but I admit that her free way
of speaking shocks me sometimes.</i>

211
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,619
<i>Jonathan says it is a defect
of the aristocracy</i>

212
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,996
<i>that they say what they please.</i>

213
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:57,293
<i>The truth is that I admire Lucy, and I'm
not surprised that men flock around her.</i>

214
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,338
<i>I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.</i>

215
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,150
What manner of man is this?

216
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,778
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor

217
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,364
in the firm of Hawkins
and Thompkins,

218
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:29,742
respected member of
the Lord Nugent's Windem Club,

219
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:34,288
returns from business
abroad in Transylvania,

220
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,417
promptly suffers
a complete mental breakdown.

221
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,837
<i>He's now obsessed
with some blood lust.</i>

222
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,509
George.

223
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,805
Wait here.

224
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,065
Would you care for
an hors cf oeuvre, Dr. Seward,

225
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,901
or a canapé?

226
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:07,613
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

227
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,367
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

228
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,369
Is my personal life
of interest to you?

229
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:17,415
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

230
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,460
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

231
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:24,046
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

232
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,008
You see,
each life that I ingest

233
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,385
gives back life to me.

234
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,850
A fly gives you life?

235
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,727
Certainly.

236
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:41,898
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks

237
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,817
than to interest me
in a lesser carnivore.

238
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,529
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

239
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,910
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

240
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,580
Yes, spiders eat them.

241
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,082
What about sparrows?

242
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:03,586
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

243
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:07,924
Something larger, perhaps?
Oh, yes.

244
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,385
A kitten.

245
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,095
I beg you.

246
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,224
A little, sleek--
A playful kitten.

247
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,685
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

248
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,687
No one would
refuse me a kitten.

249
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,148
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

250
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,944
Oh, yes.

251
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,154
A big cat.

252
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,282
My salvation depends upon it!
Your salvation?

253
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,451
Yes. I need lives.

254
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:38,829
I need lives for the master.
What master?

255
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,960
The master will come...

256
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,130
and he has promised
to make me immortal.

257
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,840
How?

258
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,135
Get him off me!

259
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,847
The blood is the life!

260
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:00,017
<i>The blood is the life!</i>

261
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,438
<i>Thirtieth May, Castle Dracula.</i>

262
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:08,901
<i>I think strange things which
I dare not confess to my own soul.</i>

263
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,403
<i>The count,</i>

264
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,990
<i>the way he looked at Mina's
picture fills me with dread,</i>

265
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,034
<i>as if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.</i>

266
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,269
I didn't hear you come in.

267
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,817
Take care how
you out yourself.

268
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,362
It is more dangerous
than you think.

269
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:04,707
A foul bauble
of man's vanity.

270
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,209
Perhaps you should

271
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,545
grow a beard.

272
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,889
The letters I requested.

273
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,266
Have you written them?

274
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,326
Good.

275
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,838
Should you leave these rooms,

276
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,425
you will not, by any chance,

277
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,887
go to sleep in any other
part of the castle.

278
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,808
It is old...

279
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,937
and has many bad memories.

280
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,609
Be warned.
I'm sure I understand.

281
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,205
Do not put your faith
in such trinkets of deceit.

282
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,668
We are in Transylvania.

283
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,715
Transylvania is not England.

284
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,051
Our ways are not your ways.

285
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,220
And to you,

286
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,640
there shall be
many strange things.

287
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:48,060
I've seen many
strange things already.

288
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,021
Bloody wolves chasing me
through some blue inferno!

289
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,655
Listen to them.

290
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,037
The children of the night.

291
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,333
What sweet music
they make.

292
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,545
Music? Those animals?

293
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,917
<i>I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.</i>

294
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,545
<i>To the firm, to my family
and to my beloved Mina.</i>

295
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,632
<i>I said nothing of my fears
as he will read them, no doubt.</i>

296
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,473
<i>I know now that I am a prisoner.</i>

297
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,643
<i>Jonathan.</i>

298
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,188
<i>Jonathan, come to me.</i>

299
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,658
<i>Come.</i>

300
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,887
<i>Lay down.</i>

301
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,223
<i>Lay back into my arms.</i>

302
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,235
<i>Lay back, Jonathan.</i>

303
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,152
How dare you touch him!
He belongs to me!

304
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,654
You yourself never loved.

305
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:40,496
Yes. I too can love.

306
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:46,710
And I shall love again.

307
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,930
Are we to have nothing tonight?

308
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,726
<i>Dearest Mina, all is well here.</i>

309
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,729
<i>The count has insisted
I remain for a month</i>

310
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,107
<i>to tutor him in English custom.</i>

311
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:53,652
<i>I can say no more,
except I love you.</i>

312
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,488
<i>Ever faithful, Jonathan.</i>

313
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,579
<i>The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.</i>

314
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:11,253
<i>The count's gypsies, fearless
warriors who are loyal to the death</i>

315
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,630
<i>to whatever nobleman
they serve...</i>

316
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:20,095
<i>day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth</i>

317
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,515
<i>from the bowels of the castle.</i>

318
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:29,146
<i>They are to be delivered to his newly
acquired Carfax Abbey in London.</i>

319
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,110
<i>Why do they
fill these boxes with earth?</i>

320
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,868
I love him! I love him!

321
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,746
Oh, Mina!

322
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,916
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

323
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,543
I love him
and I've said yes.

324
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,130
So finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

325
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:58,133
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

326
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,262
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

327
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,140
You are to be my maid
of honor. Oh, say yes.

328
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:09,561
Mina, what is it? It's the most
exciting day of my life.

329
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,148
You don't seem to care.

330
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,401
It's just that I'm so terribly
worried about Jonathan.

331
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,737
This letter I received is so--

332
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:22,324
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

333
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,660
Oh, Mina, don't worry.

334
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,022
Captain's log: the Demeter.</i>

335
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,401
<i>Twenty-seventh June, 1897.</i>

336
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:02,364
<i>We picked up 50 boxes
of experimental earth</i>

337
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,783
<i>bound for London, England.</i>

338
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,119
<i>Set sail at noon into a storm</i>

339
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,788
<i>that seemed
to come out of nowhere,</i>

340
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:12,374
<i>carrying us out to sea.</i>

341
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:51,079
<i>Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.</i>

342
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:55,667
<i>Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.</i>

343
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,421
<i>Believe someone or something</i>

344
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,923
<i>is aboard the ship with us.</i>

345
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,147
Master, I am here!

346
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,109
The master of all life
is at hand!

347
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,195
Gather round!

348
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,781
I am here to do
your bidding, master!

349
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,283
I have worshipped you
long and far off!

350
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,912
And now you are near,
master!

351
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,664
I am your slave!

352
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,459
I await your command!

353
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:40,337
The case of Renfield
grows more interesting.

354
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:44,299
Yet, there is method in his madness
with his flies and spiders.

355
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,636
Had I the secret of even
one such brilliant mind,

356
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:51,640
the key to the fancy
of one lunatic...

357
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,022
Lucy.

358
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,149
Lucy.

359
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,916
Lucy? Lucy!

360
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,002
Lucy!

361
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,302
Lucy.

362
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:44,836
Lucy!

363
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,229
Lucy!

364
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:43,979
No. Do not see me.

365
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,826
Lucy.

366
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:02,581
Oh! I couldn't control myself.

367
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:06,543
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

368
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,714
My soul, it seemed
to leave my body.

369
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,552
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

370
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,137
I'm absolutely shaking.

371
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:19,180
It's all right, Lucy.
You were dreaming.

372
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,559
I had to. It sort of
pulled me and lured me.

373
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:25,854
- I had no control.
- It's all right.

374
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,940
- It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

375
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,818
I still have the taste
of his blood in my mouth.

376
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:48,543
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

377
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,005
Master.

378
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,134
I am here to do your bidding.

379
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,263
Master! I am here!

380
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,059
I have worshipped you.

381
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,773
<i>Contrary to some
beliefs, the vampire,</i>

382
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:13,902
<i>like any other night creature,
can move about by day,</i>

383
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:18,406
<i>though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.</i>

384
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,134
See the amazing
cinematograph!

385
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:41,262
A wonder of modern civilization!

386
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,640
The latest sensation!

387
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,851
The greatest attraction
of the century!

388
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,771
The new wonder of the world!

389
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,818
See the amazing cinematograph!

390
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:16,047
See me.

391
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,134
See me now.

392
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:29,102
Escaped wolf from zoo
still at large!

393
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,146
Buy a paper, sir?

394
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,983
Thank you, sir.

395
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,989
Get your Gazette!
Penny a paper!

396
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,755
My humblest apologies.

397
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,842
Forgive my ignorance.

398
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:04,012
I am recently arrived
from abroad

399
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:07,182
and I do not know your city.

400
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,683
Is a beautiful lady--?

401
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,186
You may purchase a street atlas
for sixpence. Good day.

402
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:16,107
I have offended you.

403
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,903
I am only looking for
the cinematograph.

404
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:23,531
I understand it is a wonder
of the civilized world.

405
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:27,410
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

406
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:30,497
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

407
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,467
A woman so lovely
and intelligent

408
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:46,179
should not be walking the streets
of London without her gentleman.

409
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,556
Do I know you, sir?

410
00:46:49,808 --> 00:46:52,685
Are you acquainted
with my husband?

411
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,729
Shall I call the police?

412
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,733
Husband?

413
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,319
I shall bother you
no more.

414
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,658
Sir.

415
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,411
It is I who have been rude.

416
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,331
If You're looking“ Please.

417
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,336
Permit me
to introduce myself.

418
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:24,425
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

419
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,430
A prince, no less?
I am...

420
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,976
your servant.

421
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,856
Wilhelmina Murray.

422
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:43,444
I am

423
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,613
honored,

424
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,699
Madam Mina.

425
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,454
This way.

426
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,553
Hello, sir.

427
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,973
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

428
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,600
Yes, sir.

429
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,436
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
Thank you.

430
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:18,146
Oh, Jack!

431
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:21,566
Brilliant Jack. Do you like it?

432
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,320
Did Arthur put you
up to this

433
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:28,865
or did you want me alone
just once before I'm married?

434
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,452
Lucy, you're
embarrassing me.

435
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:35,330
I'm here as your doctor.

436
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,665
Your fiancé is very
worried about you,

437
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:42,629
and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

438
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,881
I must have your
complete trust.

439
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,512
Help me, Jack.

440
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:55,600
I don't know
what's happening to me.

441
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,852
I'm changing.

442
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,896
I can feel it.

443
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,316
I can hear everything.

444
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:06,486
I hear the servants at the other
end of the house, whispering.

445
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:09,906
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

446
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:13,743
But I'm having horrible
nightmares, Jack.

447
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,372
The eyes.

448
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,873
Oh, Jack.

449
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,669
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

450
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,546
Ow. Ow.

451
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,131
Let it work.

452
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,386
Thank you.
Lucy.

453
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,930
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

454
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,896
And may I say, Miss
Lucy is hotter than a June bride

455
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,399
riding bareback buck naked
in middle of the Sahara.

456
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,734
I would watch my colonial
tongue if I were you.

457
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,323
Hello, Jack. And how's
our lovely patient today?

458
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,202
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

459
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,997
Oh, Jack, are you
still brooding over Miss Lucy?

460
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,667
I can only conclude
it must be something mental.

461
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:06,254
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

462
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:09,966
Last week he wanted to marry her, and
now he wants to have her committed.

463
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:12,802
Let's go and have
a look at her.

464
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:26,566
I'm at a loss,
I admit.

465
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,318
I've taken the liberty of
cabling Abraham Van Helsing,

466
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,446
the metaphysician,
philosopher.

467
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:34,407
Sounds like a goddamn
witch doctor to me, Jack.

468
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:38,369
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

469
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,705
He's my teacher
and mentor.

470
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:47,128
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

471
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,255
Spare no expense.

472
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,708
Astounding.

473
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,669
There are no limits
to science.

474
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:33,174
How can you call this science?

475
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,512
Do you think Madam Curie
would invite such comparisons?

476
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,347
Really.

477
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,728
I, ahem-- I shouldn't
have come here.

478
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,814
I must go.

479
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,029
Do not fear me.

480
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:11,796
Stop this. Stop this.

481
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,548
Stop this.

482
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,477
My God. Who are you?

483
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,312
I know you.

484
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:33,025
I have crossed
oceans of time

485
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,069
to find you.

486
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:16,194
There is no need to panic.

487
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,031
The animal handlers have
everything under complete control.

488
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,136
Come here, Mina.

489
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:02,990
He likes you.

490
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:32,478
There is much to be
learned from beasts.

491
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,803
The tropical
pampas vampire bat must

492
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,766
consume 10 times its own weight
in fresh blood each day

493
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,394
or its own blood cells
will die.

494
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,113
Cute little vermin, ja?

495
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:10,159
Blood and the diseases
of the blood,

496
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:13,120
such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

497
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,457
The very name
"venereal diseases,"

498
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:20,294
the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

499
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:23,839
And they are involved
in that sex problem about which

500
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:28,052
the ethics and ideals of Christian
civilization are concerned.

501
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:33,224
In fact, civilization and syphilisation
have advanced together.

502
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,311
What is this?

503
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,105
It's from the telegraph,
professor.

504
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,148
Telegraph?

505
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:47,488
Mm. Thank you. Gentlemen,
thank you. That will be all.

506
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,501
Dawn.

507
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:03,504
<i>These may be the last words
I write in this journal.</i>

508
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,298
<i>Dracula has left me
with these women,</i>

509
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,509
<i>these devils of the pit.</i>

510
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,845
<i>They drain my blood
to keep me weak,</i>

511
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,681
<i>barely alive so I cannot escape.</i>

512
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:17,184
<i>I will try one last time today
to escape to the water.</i>

513
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,187
<i>There must be passageway
to the river,</i>

514
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,773
<i>and then away
from this cursed land</i>

515
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,110
<i>where the devil and his children
still walk with earthly feet.</i>

516
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,497
<i>For the record, I do attest</i>

517
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,876
<i>that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing,</i>

518
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:45,921
<i>became personally involved
in these strange events.</i>

519
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:42,937
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

520
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:50,903
I always come to my friends
in need when they call me.

521
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,447
So, Jack, tell me
everything about yourcase.

522
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:56,492
She has all the usual
physical anemic signs.

523
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:59,787
Her blood analyses normal,
and yet it is not.

524
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:03,499
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

525
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:04,708
Blood loss? How?

526
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:16,262
My God, close the doors!

527
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:31,193
My God,
she's only a child.

528
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,280
Ja.

529
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,533
My God.

530
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,704
There's no time to be lost. There
must be a transfusion atonce.

531
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,498
Take off your coat. Remember
how to tie a tourniquet, don't you?

532
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:47,001
Or have you forgotten?
You perfected a procedure?

533
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,587
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

534
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,672
Landsteiner's method.

535
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,676
Animals, goats, sheeps.

536
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,221
If haemolysis occurs
in the blood-donor serum,

537
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,056
her red blood cells
will explode.

538
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,559
She will die.
Here, take this tube.

539
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,648
What in God's name
is going on up here?

540
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,358
This is Professor
Van Helsing, Art.

541
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,027
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?

542
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,236
He's trying to save her life.

543
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,905
Good God!
You're the fiancé? Please.

544
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,825
Please.

545
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,412
Take off your coat. This young
lady's very ill. She's dying.

546
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,581
She wants blood
and blood she must have.

547
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:27,082
Take off your coat.

548
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,168
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

549
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,838
Oh, God.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

550
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:34,548
Roll it up!

551
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,467
This may hurt a little, Art.

552
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:37,926
Ow!

553
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,732
Forgive me, sir. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

554
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:53,776
Your last drop?

555
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,569
Thank you.

556
01:00:55,736 --> 01:01:00,074
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

557
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,659
Hold her hand.

558
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:18,592
But, Jack, that poor creature has had
the blood of two men put into her already.

559
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:22,179
Man alive. Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

560
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,517
What took it out?

561
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:28,602
That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

562
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,110
Those marks
on her throat,

563
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,654
no disease,
no trituration,

564
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,656
I am sure the blood loss
occurred there.

565
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:42,741
Oh? Where did
the blood go?

566
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,578
You were once
a careful student, Jack.

567
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,580
Use your brain!
Where did the blood go?

568
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,124
Tell me!

569
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,710
The bedclothes would
be covered in blood.

570
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:56,046
Exactly. You do not let your
eyes see nor your ears hear

571
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,465
that which you
cannot account for.

572
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:02,094
Something just went up there, sucked it
out of her and flew away, I suppose?

573
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:05,973
Ja. Why not?

574
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:10,352
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

575
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,646
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are,

576
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,773
kindly tell me what is
going on with my Lucy?

577
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,736
Jack, you are a scientist.

578
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:22,239
Do you not think there are things in this
universe which you cannot understand

579
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,867
and which are true.
Mesmerism, hypnotism?

580
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:27,119
You and Charcot
have proved hypnotism.

581
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:28,704
Materialization, astral bodies.

582
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,424
Professor?

583
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:43,260
Where the hell did he go?

584
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,307
You see?

585
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:50,851
I feel like a blundering novice.

586
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:54,521
Gentlemen, we're not fighting
some disease here.

587
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,690
Those marks on your dear
Miss Lucy's neck were made

588
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:59,026
by something
unspeakable out there.

589
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:00,360
Dead, but not dead.

590
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:03,572
It stalks us for some dread purpose
I do not yet comprehend.

591
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,825
To live, it feeds
on Lucy's precious blood.

592
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:09,369
It is a beast, a monster.

593
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,183
<i>What is happening
to Lucy and to me?</i>

594
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,520
<i>When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.</i>

595
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,980
<i>I wish I were myself again,</i>

596
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,776
<i>the sensible Mina
I always depended on.</i>

597
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,368
<i>Absinthe</i>

598
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:51,995
<i>is the aphrodisiac of the self.</i>

599
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:56,416
<i>The green fairy</i>

600
01:03:56,583 --> 01:04:01,296
<i>who lives in the absinthe</i>

601
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,382
<i>wants your soul.</i>

602
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,594
<i>But...</i>

603
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,890
<i>you are safe with me.</i>

604
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,949
Tell me, prince,

605
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,201
tell me of your home.

606
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,998
The most beautiful place

607
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,083
in all creation.

608
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:42,796
Yes, it must be.

609
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:50,637
A land beyond
a great, vast forest...

610
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:55,976
surrounded by
majestic mountains...

611
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,730
lush vineyards...

612
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:06,278
and flowers of such frailty
and beauty

613
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,822
as to be found nowhere else.

614
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:20,584
You've described my home

615
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,920
as if you had
seen it firsthand.

616
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:30,093
It's your voice,
perhaps.

617
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,179
It's so familiar.

618
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:36,099
It's like--

619
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,270
It's like a voice in a dream
I cannot place...

620
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,776
and it comforts me.

621
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:48,403
When I am alone.
When you are alone.

622
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,386
And what
of the princess?

623
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:20,727
Princess?

624
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,813
There is always
a princess...

625
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,401
with gowns
flowing white.

626
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:34,700
And her face.

627
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,869
Oh, God,

628
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:39,913
her face...

629
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,252
is a river.

630
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:52,509
The princess,

631
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:57,097
she's a river
filled with tears of sadness

632
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,517
and heartbreak.

633
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,732
There was a princess.

634
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,195
Elisabeta.

635
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,742
She was the most
radiant woman

636
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,952
in all the empires
of the world.

637
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:30,130
Man's deceit took her
from her ancient prince.

638
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:35,093
She leapt to her death

639
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,637
into the river
that you spoke of.

640
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:41,641
In my mother's tongue

641
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,062
it is called...

642
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:48,398
<i>argesh.</i>

643
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,402
River princess.

644
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,125
<i>Dear madam.</i>

645
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:33,336
<i>Your fiance' is safe
and in the care...</i>

646
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,964
<i>of the good sisters
of the Blessed Sacrament.</i>

647
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:41,761
<i>Mr. Harker believes your life
is in extreme danger</i>

648
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:45,265
<i>and he desires with all urgency
that you join him here</i>

649
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:48,560
<i>so that you may
immediately be married.</i>

650
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:52,230
<i>Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.</i>

651
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,652
My sweet prince.

652
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,447
Jonathan must never
know of us.

653
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,581
Lucy? Lucy.

654
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:12,834
Abraham Van Helsing.
Dr. Van Helsing.

655
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:16,129
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

656
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:19,466
How is she, doctor?
She's still very weak.

657
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,885
She tells me of your
beloved Jonathan Harker

658
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:24,137
and your worry for him.

659
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,473
Well, I, too, worry
for all young lovers.

660
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,605
There are darknesses
in life, my child,

661
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:35,815
and there are lights.

662
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:38,777
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina,

663
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:40,987
the light of all light.

664
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,203
Go now. See your friend.

665
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,513
Mina.

666
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,018
You look different, Mina.

667
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:15,272
You look positively radiant.

668
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,856
You heard
from Jonathan.

669
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,067
Didn't you?
Yes.

670
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:20,694
Yes.

671
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,862
He's safe, Lucy.

672
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,699
He's in a convent
in Romania.

673
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:29,286
He's suffering from
a violent brain fever.

674
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,121
The good sisters
are caring for him.

675
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:35,875
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me,

676
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:39,045
but I won't go.

677
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,339
I'm not going
to leave you.

678
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,174
Mina.

679
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,219
You've got to go to him

680
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:48,888
and you've got to love him

681
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,224
and marry him
right then and there.

682
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,978
And I want you to
take this, my sister.

683
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:56,354
No.

684
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,398
It's my wedding gift
to you.

685
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:00,025
No, Lucy, no.

686
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:02,902
Don't worry about
spoiled little Lucy.

687
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,699
I'll be all right.

688
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,869
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

689
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,552
Jack, how is she?
Quincey.

690
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,656
This is why I
cannot breathe!

691
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:51,451
Lucy.Lucy.
Lucy, it's medicinal.

692
01:12:51,618 --> 01:12:53,912
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

693
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:57,082
It's garlic!
It's nothing but common garlic!

694
01:12:57,248 --> 01:13:00,460
Lucy, Quincey's here. Quincey's
here to see you. Get some brandy.

695
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:04,297
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

696
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,299
Arthur sent me
to take care of you.

697
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:08,968
He said if you don't
get better right quick,

698
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:12,055
I have to put you out of your
misery like a lame horse.

699
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:14,140
Quincey.

700
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:17,477
You're such a beast.

701
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:22,732
Will you kiss me,
Quincey?

702
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:28,238
Kiss me.

703
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:31,491
Kiss me.

704
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:39,666
- That old coot!
- Get off me!

705
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:43,211
Lucy, listen to me!
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

706
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,341
You're at peace.

707
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:52,303
Look. There. There.

708
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,180
Ja.

709
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,225
<i>Nosferatu.</i>

710
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,741
"Here occurs the shocking
and frightening history

711
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:17,829
of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula.

712
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:20,206
How he impaled people
and roasted them,

713
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,958
boiled their heads in a kettle,

714
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,377
how he skinned them alive

715
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:28,214
and hacked them to pieces
and then drank their blood."

716
01:14:30,175 --> 01:14:31,759
Ja.

717
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:34,846
Dracul.

718
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:37,557
For blood is the life.

719
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:56,618
<i>My dearest prince,
forgive me.</i>

720
01:14:56,784 --> 01:15:00,330
<i>I have received word
from my fiance in Romania.</i>

721
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,625
<i>I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.</i>

722
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,253
<i>I will never see you again.</i>

723
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,130
Mina.

724
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,100
<i>It is odd, but I feel almost</i>

725
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,895
<i>that my strange friend
is with me.</i>

726
01:15:24,062 --> 01:15:26,898
<i>He speaks to me in my thoughts.</i>

727
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:30,109
<i>With him I felt more alive
than ever I had.</i>

728
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:33,112
<i>And now without him,
soon to be a bride,</i>

729
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:35,990
<i>I feel confused and lost.</i>

730
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:40,161
<i>Perhaps, though I try
to be good, I am bad.</i>

731
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:43,289
<i>Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.</i>

732
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,768
Winds!

733
01:16:04,519 --> 01:16:07,188
Winds!

734
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:11,651
Winds!

735
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:16,823
It is the cause.

736
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:19,659
It is the cause of my soul!

737
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,202
It is Dracula,

738
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,496
the undead,

739
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:26,416
the foe I have pursued
all my life.

740
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,130
Dracula!

741
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,594
Jack, hurry!
I have much to tell you.

742
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,181
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

743
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,767
Do not fail here tonight.

744
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,854
We are dealing with forces
beyond all human experience,

745
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:50,023
an enormous power,
so guard her well.

746
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:53,818
Otherwise your precious Lucy
will become a bitch of the devil,

747
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:55,862
a whore of darkness!

748
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:59,365
Well, you're a sick old buzzard.

749
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,869
Hear me out, young man.

750
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:05,413
Lucy is not a random victim
attacked by mere accident.

751
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,165
Do you understand? No.

752
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:11,419
She is a willing recruit, a breathless
follower, a wanton follower.

753
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:14,088
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

754
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:16,716
She is the devil's concubine!

755
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:19,761
Do you understand me?

756
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:24,641
Yet, we may still save
her precious soul.

757
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:28,478
But not on an
empty stomach.

758
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,855
Jack!
Here, sir.

759
01:17:31,022 --> 01:17:33,733
Ah! I starve. Feed me.

760
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,361
You old coot!

761
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:54,540
Your impotent men
with their foolish spells

762
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:58,836
cannot protect you
from my power.

763
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:14,727
I condemn you to living death,

764
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:18,022
to eternal hunger

765
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:22,443
for living blood.

766
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,321
Pfft! Jack.

767
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:50,364
Come here.

768
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,369
Ja.

769
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:59,957
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

770
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,251
Believe?
How can I believe?

771
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:06,130
I want you to bring me, before
nightfall, a set of post-mortem knives.

772
01:22:06,297 --> 01:22:08,299
An autopsy? Lucy?

773
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:12,011
No, no, no, not exactly. I just want to
cut off her head and take out her heart.

774
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,765
Jack--

775
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:22,855
<i>Diary, 17th September.</i>

776
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:26,651
<i>Poor Jonathan. Still so ill.</i>

777
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:30,029
<i>He's cheered by
the familiar streets of London.</i>

778
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:34,367
<i>For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.</i>

779
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:38,037
<i>It is as if a part of me
is dead too,</i>

780
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:40,998
<i>except for the tiny hope
that lives in me</i>

781
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:43,626
<i>that I will again see my prince.</i>

782
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:45,670
<i>Is he here?</i>

783
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:47,338
<i>Now that I am married,</i>

784
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:51,550
<i>I begin to understand the nature
of my feelings for my strange friend</i>

785
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,136
<i>who is always in my thoughts.</i>

786
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,233
Jonathan, what is it?

787
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,276
It is the man himself.

788
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,612
Look, he's grown young.

789
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:59,660
Gentlemen, must we desecrate
poor Lucy's grave?

790
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:01,746
She died
horribly enough.

791
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:07,460
If Miss Lucy is dead, then
no wrong can be done to her.

792
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:10,171
But if she's not dead, well...

793
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:12,757
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

794
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:17,928
No. All I say is she is undead.

795
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:20,222
Undead.

796
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,183
This is insane.

797
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,621
Gentlemen, shall we?

798
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:46,749
One, two, three.

799
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,518
Where is she?

800
01:25:06,894 --> 01:25:09,063
Where is she?!

801
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:12,858
What have you
done with her?

802
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:15,152
She lives beyond
the grace of God,

803
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:17,488
a wanderer in the
outer darkness.

804
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:21,534
<i>She is vampyre,
nosferatu.</i>

805
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,662
These creatures do not die
like the bee after the first sting,

806
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:27,164
but instead grow strong
and become immortal

807
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:29,416
once infected
by another nosferatu.

808
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,842
So, my friends,
we fight not one beast,

809
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:41,387
but legions that go on
age after age after age,

810
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:43,305
feeding on the blood
of the living.

811
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:52,273
Quickly, hide. Now.

812
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,135
Lucy!

813
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:32,396
Come to me, Arthur.

814
01:26:32,563 --> 01:26:35,608
Leave these others
and come to me.

815
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,613
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

816
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:44,325
Kiss me and caress me,

817
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:46,785
my darling husband, please.

818
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:49,622
We wave
Christ and His holy blood!

819
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:52,416
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

820
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:55,711
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

821
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,464
The power of God
is upon us!

822
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:00,633
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

823
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:04,470
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

824
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:07,139
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

825
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:13,562
I bring you from shadow
into light!

826
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:16,815
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness,

827
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:18,108
into hell!

828
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,614
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

829
01:27:23,781 --> 01:27:25,658
Take the stake
in your left hand...

830
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,496
place the point
over the heart.

831
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:36,919
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now!

832
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:57,523
Eat, feast. You'll need your
strength for the dark days ahead.

833
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:59,358
Mina.

834
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:03,237
<i>Doctor?
Ja?</i>

835
01:28:03,404 --> 01:28:04,989
How did Lucy die?

836
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,285
Well--

837
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:12,705
<i>Was she in great pain?</i>

838
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:15,499
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head

839
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:18,836
and drove a stake through her heart and
burned it and then she found peace.

840
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:22,298
Doctor! Please.

841
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:28,012
So, Mr. Harker,

842
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:31,056
I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

843
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:35,686
a sensitive question.

844
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:38,355
During your infidelity
with those creatures,

845
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,024
those demonic women,

846
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:43,527
did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

847
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:45,571
No.

848
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:53,162
No?
No.

849
01:28:55,331 --> 01:28:56,373
Good!

850
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,043
Then you have not infected
your blood with the terrible

851
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:01,587
disease that
destroyed poor Lucy.

852
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:12,765
Doctor,
you must understand.

853
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:16,852
I doubted everything,

854
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,604
even my mind.

855
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:20,814
I was impotent with fear.

856
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:23,776
- I know.
- But, sir,

857
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:27,696
I know where
the bastard sleeps.

858
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:31,533
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

859
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,915
Vampires do exist.

860
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:41,126
And this one we fight,
this one we face,

861
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,796
has the strength
of 20 or more people,

862
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,964
and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

863
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:49,218
<i>But he can also control
the meaner things of life,</i>

864
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:51,428
<i>the bat, the rodent, the wolf.</i>

865
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:55,682
<i>He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.</i>

866
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:58,352
Now, all these things
Dracula can do,

867
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,145
but he is not free.

868
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:03,649
He must rest in the sacred earth of
his homeland to gain his evil power.

869
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:07,653
It is here that we must find him
and destroy him utterly. Jack.

870
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,823
I almost feel pity for anything
so hunted as this count.

871
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,741
How can you pity
such a creature?

872
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:16,328
I'll take Mina
to my quarters.

873
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:18,956
Good. You'll be safer there.

874
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:23,961
Mr. Morris, your
bullets will not harm him.

875
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,464
He must be beheaded. I suggest
you use your big bowie knife.

876
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:30,342
Well, I wasn't planning
on getting that close, doc.

877
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,345
Master!

878
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,307
Master!

879
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:39,393
Master!

880
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:42,729
Master!

881
01:30:44,148 --> 01:30:45,607
Master!

882
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:52,322
Dr. Jack!

883
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:55,367
I've been promised
eternal life!

884
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:00,330
Dr. Seward,
who is that man?

885
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:03,000
Mr. Renfield. This is no
place for you, Madam Mina.

886
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:06,295
Renfield? I must see him.

887
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:10,883
Mr. Renfield,
behave yourself.

888
01:31:13,302 --> 01:31:15,220
This is Mrs. Harker.

889
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:20,726
Good evening.
Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

890
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:23,562
It seems I've been
rather naughty.

891
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,941
I know you.

892
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:30,027
You're the bride
my master covets.

893
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:35,240
I have a husband.

894
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:36,992
I am Mrs. Harker.

895
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:41,121
My master tells me
about you.

896
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:43,624
What does he tell you?

897
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,210
That he is coming.

898
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:50,088
That he is coming for you.

899
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,175
Oh, please.

900
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,266
Don't stay here.

901
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:06,313
Get away from
these men, please.

902
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:11,610
And I pray to God I may never
see your sweet face again.

903
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,908
And may the Lord bless
and keep you.

904
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:32,798
Master! Master!

905
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:35,634
You promised me eternal life,

906
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:39,137
but you give it
to the pretty woman!

907
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:41,306
Dr. Jack!

908
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,433
I'm no lunatic man!

909
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,478
I'm a sane man
fighting for his soul!

910
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:50,524
My quarters are spare, but I
think you will find them comfortable.

911
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:52,526
Dr. Jack!

912
01:32:52,693 --> 01:32:55,487
Water and toiletries
at your disposal.

913
01:32:57,823 --> 01:33:00,242
You'll be completely safe here.

914
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,891
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

915
01:34:06,058 --> 01:34:07,934
Leave him no refuge.

916
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,562
Let the exorcism begin.

917
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:39,800
Renfield.

918
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:43,011
You have betrayed me.

919
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:45,597
No.

920
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,934
No, master.

921
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:52,646
No, I--

922
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:55,440
I serve you.

923
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:58,443
I serve only you.

924
01:35:55,876 --> 01:35:59,004
Oh, yes, my love.

925
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:01,590
You've found me.

926
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:07,179
My most precious life.

927
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:10,432
I have wanted this to happen.

928
01:36:10,599 --> 01:36:12,517
I know that now.

929
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:17,814
I want to be with you always.

930
01:36:17,981 --> 01:36:22,527
You cannot know
what you are saying.

931
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,654
Yes,

932
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,907
I do know.

933
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:43,840
I feared I would never feel
your touch again.

934
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,884
I thought you were dead.

935
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:57,145
There is no life
in this body.

936
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:03,235
But you live.

937
01:37:04,945 --> 01:37:06,905
You live.

938
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:10,492
What are you?

939
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:14,913
I must know.
You must tell me.

940
01:37:22,254 --> 01:37:24,172
lam...

941
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,884
nothing.

942
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:29,427
Lifeless.

943
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:33,473
Soulless.
What do you mean?

944
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,560
Hated and feared.

945
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:40,730
I am dead
to all the world.

946
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:42,774
Hear me.

947
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:46,820
I am the monster

948
01:37:46,987 --> 01:37:49,072
that breathing men
would kill.

949
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:53,034
I am Dracula.

950
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:01,126
No.

951
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,969
You murdered Lucy!

952
01:38:24,149 --> 01:38:26,109
I love you.

953
01:38:27,444 --> 01:38:31,823
Oh, God,
forgive me, I do.

954
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:53,053
I want to be
what you are,

955
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:54,554
see what you see,

956
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,640
love what you love.

957
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:00,101
Mina...

958
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:02,812
to walk with me,

959
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:06,191
you must die
to your breathing life

960
01:39:06,358 --> 01:39:09,486
and be reborn to mine.

961
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:12,864
You are my love

962
01:39:13,031 --> 01:39:15,659
and my life always.

963
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:27,921
Then I give you
life eternal...

964
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,716
everlasting love...

965
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:37,055
The power of the storm

966
01:39:37,222 --> 01:39:40,892
and the beasts of the earth.

967
01:39:41,059 --> 01:39:43,228
Walk with me

968
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:47,065
to be my loving wife forever.

969
01:39:47,232 --> 01:39:50,026
I will. Yes. Yes.

970
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:24,019
Mina, drink and join me

971
01:40:25,103 --> 01:40:27,564
in eternal life.

972
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:42,620
No.

973
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:44,247
I cannot let this be.

974
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:49,210
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

975
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:53,423
You will be cursed as I am
to walk in the shadow of death

976
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:55,300
for all eternity.

977
01:40:55,467 --> 01:41:00,221
I love you too much

978
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:01,806
to condemn you.

979
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:07,103
Then take me away
from all this death.

980
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,526
Mina!

981
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:07,664
You think you can destroy me

982
01:42:07,831 --> 01:42:10,166
with your idols?

983
01:42:13,128 --> 01:42:15,755
Sacred blood of Christ!

984
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:18,842
I, who served the cross.

985
01:42:19,008 --> 01:42:21,344
I, who commanded nations

986
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:24,514
hundreds of years
before you were born.

987
01:42:24,681 --> 01:42:26,683
Your armies were defeated.

988
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:30,728
You tortured and impaled
thousands of people.

989
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:34,065
I was betrayed.

990
01:42:34,232 --> 01:42:37,152
Look what your God

991
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:40,071
has done to me.

992
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,199
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

993
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:49,914
Christ compels you!

994
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:53,585
She is now

995
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:57,005
my bride!

996
01:42:57,172 --> 01:42:58,423
No!

997
01:42:58,756 --> 01:42:59,841
No!

998
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:02,969
More light!

999
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:08,099
Light! More light!

1000
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:17,025
Unclean.

1001
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:18,902
Unclean.

1002
01:43:20,153 --> 01:43:21,279
- Get them!
- This way!

1003
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:22,780
- Get them!
- They must be found.

1004
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:24,115
Unclean.

1005
01:43:24,282 --> 01:43:26,618
<i>We have learned something much.</i>

1006
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:30,538
<i>Dracula fears us.
He fears time.</i>

1007
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:33,791
<i>For, if not,
why does he hurry so?</i>

1008
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,711
<i>He is gone.</i>

1009
01:43:36,878 --> 01:43:39,130
How do you know?

1010
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:42,091
<i>He speaks to me.</i>

1011
01:43:43,176 --> 01:43:45,637
He has a strong
mind connection to you.

1012
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:50,642
His heart was strong enough
to survive the grave.

1013
01:43:51,935 --> 01:43:55,021
You admire him.
Ja.

1014
01:43:55,188 --> 01:43:59,484
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man,

1015
01:43:59,651 --> 01:44:02,320
and his mind
was great and powerful,

1016
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:05,448
but greater is the necessity
to stamp him out

1017
01:44:05,615 --> 01:44:07,492
and destroy him utterly.

1018
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:10,578
<i>Doctor?
Ja?</i>

1019
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:17,293
I know that I am
becoming like him.

1020
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:20,838
Your salvation
is his destruction.

1021
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:24,717
That is why
I want to hypnotize you.

1022
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:28,846
I want you to help me find him,
Mina, before it is too late.

1023
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:32,517
Please help me find him.
Please.

1024
01:44:32,684 --> 01:44:35,061
Look into this light,

1025
01:44:35,228 --> 01:44:37,939
the light of all light,
into this flame.

1026
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:40,942
Your eyes are heavy.

1027
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:45,321
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

1028
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:48,950
Sleep.

1029
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:52,120
I must go to him.

1030
01:44:52,287 --> 01:44:54,622
He calls.

1031
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:56,207
What do you hear?

1032
01:44:58,543 --> 01:45:00,962
What do you hear,
child?

1033
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,674
<i>What do you hear?</i>

1034
01:45:04,841 --> 01:45:08,886
<i>Oh, my prince is calling me.</i>

1035
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:13,599
<i>He is traveling across icy seas
to his beloved home.</i>

1036
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:16,894
<i>There he will grow strong again.</i>

1037
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:20,732
<i>I am coming to him
to partake of his strength.</i>

1038
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:27,989
<i>We left London by train</i>

1039
01:45:28,156 --> 01:45:31,367
<i>and crossed the English Channel
that night in stormy seas,</i>

1040
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:34,579
<i>no doubt from the passage
of the count's ship.</i>

1041
01:45:34,746 --> 01:45:39,125
<i>He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.</i>

1042
01:45:39,292 --> 01:45:42,920
<i>By train, we can reach the Romanian
port at Varna in three days.</i>

1043
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,757
<i>By ship, it will take him
at least a week.</i>

1044
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:50,261
<i>From Paris, we traveled
through the Alps to Budapest.</i>

1045
01:45:50,428 --> 01:45:53,014
<i>The count must sail around
the Rock of Gibraltar,</i>

1046
01:45:53,181 --> 01:45:54,932
<i>where we have posted a lookout,</i>

1047
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:57,852
<i>and then on to the
Black Sea port in Varna,</i>

1048
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:01,314
<i>where we will meet his ship
and burn it into the sea.</i>

1049
01:46:07,403 --> 01:46:10,531
Home. Home.

1050
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:23,002
The vampire's baptized her
with his own blood,

1051
01:46:23,169 --> 01:46:25,254
and her blood is dying,
my friend.

1052
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:27,298
It is no use.

1053
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:38,434
Mina.

1054
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:42,980
I will not let you go
into the unknown alone.

1055
01:46:43,147 --> 01:46:47,360
Oh, my poor,
dear Jonathan.

1056
01:46:47,527 --> 01:46:50,238
Oh, what have
I done to you?

1057
01:46:51,948 --> 01:46:55,118
No, no, I have done this
to both of us.

1058
01:46:55,284 --> 01:46:57,495
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

1059
01:46:57,662 --> 01:46:59,539
He's calling me to him.

1060
01:47:00,415 --> 01:47:03,000
Mina. Mina.

1061
01:47:04,335 --> 01:47:06,712
Stay with me. Please.

1062
01:47:06,879 --> 01:47:08,798
I am so cold.

1063
01:47:21,102 --> 01:47:22,478
All aboard!

1064
01:47:22,645 --> 01:47:26,315
<i>Noon. Holmwood received
a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.</i>

1065
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:29,485
<i>The count's ship sailed
past us in the night fog,</i>

1066
01:47:29,652 --> 01:47:31,487
<i>to the northern port of Galatz.</i>

1067
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:34,824
<i>The black devil
is reading Miner's mind.</i>

1068
01:47:34,991 --> 01:47:37,493
How can we
catch him now?

1069
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:47,879
Varna. Galatz.

1070
01:47:48,045 --> 01:47:49,714
It's about 200 miles.

1071
01:47:49,881 --> 01:47:52,049
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off,

1072
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:54,051
reach him before
he reaches the castle.

1073
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:57,221
I will dispatch Van Helsing
straight for the Borgo Pass.

1074
01:47:57,388 --> 01:47:58,890
If we fail in our task,

1075
01:47:59,056 --> 01:48:00,933
you will have to finish him.

1076
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:09,066
<i>From Varna, Mina and
Van Helsing took a carriage,</i>

1077
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:11,944
<i>and we continued
on the train towards Galatz,</i>

1078
01:48:12,111 --> 01:48:15,907
<i>where we still hoped to intercept
the count before he reaches land.</i>

1079
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:20,828
<i>I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.</i>

1080
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:35,051
I know this place.

1081
01:48:35,218 --> 01:48:37,929
- The end of the world.
- We must go on.

1082
01:48:38,095 --> 01:48:39,931
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

1083
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:42,558
No, we must go!
Mina!

1084
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:44,352
He needs me. We must go!
Mina!

1085
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:50,733
<i>We are past Bistritza.</i>

1086
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,569
<i>Dracula has outsmarted us again.</i>

1087
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:57,448
<i>We learned that his gypsies took
charge of the vampire's box at Galatz</i>

1088
01:48:57,615 --> 01:49:00,201
<i>and are now on
the Borgo Pass road.</i>

1089
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:20,555
Here. You must eat.
I am not hungry.

1090
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:25,810
Mina?

1091
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:15,776
You have been so good
to me, professor.

1092
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:29,206
I know that Lucy harbored
secret desires for you.

1093
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:31,751
She told me.

1094
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:34,962
I, too, know
what men desire.

1095
01:50:51,604 --> 01:50:53,481
Will you cut off my head

1096
01:50:53,648 --> 01:50:55,566
and drive a stake
through my heart,

1097
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:59,070
as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

1098
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:06,619
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

1099
01:51:21,509 --> 01:51:23,052
No!

1100
01:51:23,386 --> 01:51:25,805
You are safe
within the circle.

1101
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:29,475
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

1102
01:51:29,642 --> 01:51:30,976
You're whores of Satan!

1103
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:37,233
This is holy ground.

1104
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,235
Leave this place now!

1105
01:51:41,237 --> 01:51:43,280
Leave!

1106
01:51:43,948 --> 01:51:46,659
In the name of God,
leave this ground!

1107
01:51:46,826 --> 01:51:48,703
I command you
in the name of Christ!

1108
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:55,418
No!

1109
01:51:56,836 --> 01:51:58,379
No!

1110
01:52:00,798 --> 01:52:03,718
Christ! Damn you!

1111
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:42,798
Dracul!

1112
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,802
Dracul!

1113
01:53:19,335 --> 01:53:21,378
Mina.

1114
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:23,589
You are

1115
01:53:23,756 --> 01:53:26,050
<i>near.</i>

1116
01:53:26,217 --> 01:53:28,135
My love.

1117
01:53:40,231 --> 01:53:41,607
They're racing
against the sunset.

1118
01:53:41,774 --> 01:53:43,651
It may be too late.
God help us.

1119
01:54:15,933 --> 01:54:16,976
Mina.

1120
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:26,569
Harker, shoot!

1121
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:37,037
Charge!

1122
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:22,124
Harker!

1123
01:55:44,521 --> 01:55:45,814
Harker!

1124
01:56:34,071 --> 01:56:35,114
No!

1125
01:56:41,286 --> 01:56:42,371
Mina.

1126
01:57:00,431 --> 01:57:01,473
Quincey!

1127
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:07,479
No!

1128
01:57:11,775 --> 01:57:13,444
No.

1129
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:21,326
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

1130
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:25,581
Will you?

1131
01:57:29,418 --> 01:57:30,461
No.

1132
01:57:32,087 --> 01:57:33,505
- Wait.
- No! Let them go.

1133
01:57:33,672 --> 01:57:37,509
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

1134
01:57:38,302 --> 01:57:39,928
Hers has just begun.

1135
01:57:50,606 --> 01:57:51,648
Quincey.

1136
01:57:58,155 --> 01:58:00,199
Oh, no.

1137
01:58:04,119 --> 01:58:06,830
We've all become
God's madmen.

1138
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:11,251
All of us.

1139
01:58:20,511 --> 01:58:24,306
Where is my God?

1140
01:58:24,473 --> 01:58:27,684
He has forsaken me.

1141
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:36,527
It is finished.

1142
01:58:36,693 --> 01:58:38,237
No.

1143
01:58:38,529 --> 01:58:41,156
Oh, my love.

1144
01:58:45,494 --> 01:58:46,829
My love.

1145
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:57,589
<i>There, in the presence of God,</i>

1146
01:58:57,756 --> 01:59:00,676
<i>I understood at last
how my love could release us all</i>

1147
01:59:00,843 --> 01:59:02,719
<i>from the powers of darkness.</i>

1148
01:59:09,059 --> 01:59:11,645
<i>Our love is stronger than death.</i>

1149
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:22,739
Give me peace.
