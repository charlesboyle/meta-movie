Wait, come back...

00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:45,888
Please!

4
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:48,943
Please, help me

00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:26,823
Help me!

7
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:11,867
 He has no food, he has no water.
 He's not one of us.

8
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:14,275
We have to take care of us right now.
 But...

9
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,941
Drop your weapon...no..Drop your gun.

10
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,325
Both of you, please don't.
He's here to kill us.

11
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,350
Gonna blow your fuckin' head off! Drop your gun.

12
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:26,375
I won't put it down. You put yours down.

13
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,555
Do it!

14
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,192
Put your gun down.

15
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:34,270
- Tell him to put his gun down.
- Lucas

16
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,012
- Tell him to put his gun down!
- Lucas, please!

17
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:39,145
This your house? Huh?

18
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:43,500
Whose house is this? You kill those people in the pit?
 Fuck you!

19
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:46,525
You killed those people, who are you?

20
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,176
- I...I don't remember.
- That's bullshit.

21
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:54,983
Who are you?

22
00:08:56,387 --> 00:09:00,450
I-I woke up in the pit...and I
don't remember anything before it.

23
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,382
She helped me. Okay. This woman
helped me. I need to talk to her.

24
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:07,275
You let him out? You stupid?

25
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,571
Yeah, easy!

26
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:11,863
Do you know me? Why'd you let me out? And you...

27
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,277
Get your hands off of me!

28
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:25,671
What's wrong with him?

29
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:27,404
Help me!

30
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,090
Just breathe!

31
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:34,354
What's wrong with him?
He needs to breathe.

32
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:35,071
Hey, then!

33
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,156
Here, here, here, here.

34
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:37,725
Look at me, you will be okay.

35
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:40,277
Here is water, drink it.

36
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:44,025
Okay, okay, okay.

37
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,050
What the hell's going on?

38
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,017
Do you people know each other?

39
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,995
You just need to breathe.

40
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,375
Breathe...

41
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,078
Hey!

42
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:57,754
Who are you, man?

43
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:01,158
I don't remember... who I am.

44
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:08,323
None of us do.

45
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:18,294
Okay, we have no phone and no computer.
There's no way to contact the authorities.

46
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:21,127
All we have to go on is---is these.

47
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,231
So we know our names.

48
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,589
I'm Sharon.
 Hi.

49
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:28,825
Mi-Michael.

50
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:33,335
Youve met Lucas, so this must be Nathan.

51
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,350
Nathan...

52
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:37,904
Nathan...

53
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:42,512
I'm Nathan...

54
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:47,775
I don't know my name, I didn't have ID.

55
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:50,319
We also have keys.

56
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:55,130
I have a Nissan.
 I have a key.

57
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:58,668
 Do we have cars ?
 No.

58
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:02,111
There's no cars. I looked around outside, there's nothing.

59
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:06,301
Can you understand what she's writing?

60
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:10,082
She's writing over and over things. Can you read this?

61
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,044
What language is this?

62
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:14,878
She-She can't...

63
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,939
- understand...She can't understand you.
- Hey, she helped me, okay?

64
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,185
- Do you know me? Why did you help me?
- Right? I tried it.

65
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:21,058
Stop trying, you're freaking her out. It's just...

66
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,738
You know me. Okay, you helped me out
of the pit. Don't look at these fuckers.

67
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:27,291
- It doesn't matter what you say, because she couldn't...
- Hey, shut up!

68
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:29,185
She doesn't understand you, okay?

69
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,369
Well, is she deaf?

70
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,836
No, she's not deaf.

71
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:35,600
Alright, she can hear you, she
just doesn't understand English.

72
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:37,140
She's mute.

73
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,233
But she acts like she knows us.

74
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:45,966
We all woke up in this house a half hour
before we found you and she was already here.

75
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:50,718
Anything else?

76
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,394
I'm Catholic, apparently.

77
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,215
And that's it?

78
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:04,041
Well, you also had a gun.

79
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,396
Yeah, you had a gun, too...

80
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,208
I didn't dig it up out of a pile of dead people.

81
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:14,650
We're all in the same boat here.
No, we're not in the same boat.

82
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:18,675
We were in the same boat. He was
in the boat with all the corpses.

83
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:20,496
I don't trust you.

84
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:23,642
I don't trust you.

85
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,750
I don't trust any of you.

86
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,790
Have you checked the house?

87
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,631
Yes.

88
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,001
We both have this.

89
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:38,259
Why? What happened? What happened to us?

90
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,502
I know. What happened?

91
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:16,621
Where's the girl?

92
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,918
I need to talk to the girl.

93
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:22,778
Guys, I need to speak to the girl.

94
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,413
I need ya to look at something for me. Look at this.

95
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,695
Did you do this? Did you write this?

96
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:39,725
Yes, you wrote it. Okay. What does it mean?

97
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:42,944
Guys!

98
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:45,257
What is this?

99
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,405
Now we have some ammunition.

100
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,074
Well, I suppose to kill so many
people, you need a lot of bullets.

101
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:21,650
What?

102
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:25,153
Maybe you're a cop.

103
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,714
I say we, eh, take some of these
and go and have a look around outside.

104
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:32,240
No.

105
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,880
We load up and protect ourselves in here.

106
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,501
We'll go in the morning.

107
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:41,376
Showers work.

108
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:47,863
We haven't found any medical supplies.

109
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,000
You can use proxide on that.

110
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:56,645
Or you're looking at serious infection.

111
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:02,074
 Do you need a help?
 I'm okay.

112
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:05,278
Okay.

113
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:09,500
There's some clothes in the bedroom. I'll get you some.

114
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,582
You won't need that anymore.

115
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,628
I prefer to hang onto it, if you don't mind.

116
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:21,676
Suit yourself.

117
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:33,163
I'm okay, thanks. I'm okay.

118
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,478
I'm okay.

119
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:43,370
I am not okay.

120
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,250
Who are you?

121
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,516
My name is...

122
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:23,461
Remember.

123

<i>subtitles by</i><b> <font color=#8000FF> Alex Laxu</font></b>

124
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:37,000
Guys, the girl run off.

125
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,105
There she is.

126
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,174
Should we follow her?

127
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:48,434
Shit!!!

128
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,686
Okay, gun guy, lower those weapons.

129
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:55,671
 Yes?
In order to

130
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:56,788
- Yes
- Just...Yes, yes.

131
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,512
Alright, stay with him and make
sure we don't miss the house.

132
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:01,143
Okay.

133
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:10,828
Where the fuck is she?

134
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:12,799
I don't know.

135
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:17,543
Maybe she's leading us out of here.

136
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,263
- Might be a city or something.
- We're nowhere near a city.

137
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,030
- How do you know ?
- That.

138
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,818
- What do you mean?
- Stars are too bright.

139
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:33,078
We're miles from anywhere.

140
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,249
After you.

141
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
- Go.
- No, please, I insist.

142
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,772
Fuck off, go!

143
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:45,438
Would you two hurry up. We're losing her.

144
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:19,449
What 's that smell?

145
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:28,489
Oh, my God!

146
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:43,007
Who does this?

147
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,750
Someone likes to decorate.

148
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,030
Another one?

149
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:10,886
- Look at this.
- What is it?

150
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:15,911
I can read Latin.

151
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:19,966
Let me try

152
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:27,045
No...Nothing

153
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,500
- I mean, physically, I can do stuff.
- So.

154
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:41,728
And my hands remember. My body remembers.

155
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,626
My mind's a complete blank.

156
00:20:50,664 --> 00:20:51,524
You know this place?

157
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:53,705
You know, this house.

158
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,599
No.

159
00:20:57,743 --> 00:21:00,586
- I know these books.
- Oh.

160
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,790
Medical, biological reference books.

161
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,374
I mean...

162
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,887
From different countries, different periods in history.

163
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:12,132
They all relate to human or animal anatomy.

164
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,326
Wait a second.

165
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:16,647
What is it?

166
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:21,964
- Oh, my God.
- What?

167
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:27,007
What?

168
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:29,809
I can speak French.

169
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:35,286
I think this is your house.

170
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
She's feeding her like a baby.

171
00:22:39,014 --> 00:22:40,136
Fuck me...

172
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,724
You used me.

173
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,822
Jesus, she knows you.

174
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:01,300
Sharon, you sure. I don't trust him.

175
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:10,245
I recall him!

176
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,591
Someone is watching us.

177
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:30,532
What?

178
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,262
- I'm not just leaving her in there.
- We have to.

179
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,755
She was tied up for a reason.

180
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,117
It is inhumane.

181
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:47,976
She attacked you. Did you
forget this. She's a crazy woman.

182
00:23:48,924 --> 00:23:49,814
You're unbelievable.

183
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,490
- Listen.
- What?

184
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:57,690
There is a camera in the shack,
we need to find the monitoring center.

185
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,317
Only building we've seen so far is the house.

186
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:19,297
It's Italian.

187
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,932
It means "A man with a lot of
keys has a lot of things to hide".

188
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:31,575
Turns out, I know a few languages.

189
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:35,161
- Congratulations.
- Hmm.

190
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:45,132
"When they're all effect cometh the smile."

191
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:53,626
That's crazy.

192
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:56,880
We both know Latin?

193
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:02,565
You know, I have the strongest feeling I know you.

194
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,061
- Really?
- Yeah.

195
00:25:07,997 --> 00:25:08,726
Yeah.

196
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:13,585
And I feel like I know Sharon, too. I mean, not as

197
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:16,770
familiar as I feel with you, but it's there.

198
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,619
But then I keep thinking maybe she's my girlfriend.

199
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:25,532
Or my sister. She could be my
sister and that'll be pretty gross.

200
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:27,405
You think she likes me?

201
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,647
I-I don't have time for this, okay?

202
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:35,375
I-I gotta get this door open.

203
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:40,231
Try to find some tools, like a crowbar, or something.

204
00:25:40,232 --> 00:25:42,011
Get it in there and try and pry it open.

205
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:44,610
You're not gonna pry that open with a crowbar.

206
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:46,650
How do ya know? You haven't even tried.

207
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:49,883
No, that's a reinforced iron door, you're
not gonna get it open with a crowbar.

208
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:51,182
What about your keys?

209
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,916
Where'd you get those keys, Gendarme?

210
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,345
I found them.

211
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:03,311
Where'd you find them?

212
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:09,222
Downstairs. In a living room
with all the books you can read.

213
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,478
So, what's in here, Nathan?

214
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,525
I see.

215
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm not trying to make an enemy here, okay? It's just...

216
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:28,084
We can't bash the door in now.

217
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:31,026
Everybody's tryin' to sleep.

218
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,221
It's been a long night.

219
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:36,075
I think you should get a couple of hours rest.

220
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:44,259
Locked doors will still be here when you wake up.

221
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:55,982
- We need to find the cars
- I think he's got a point.

222
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:58,106
You know, you think he's got a point, mate. I wasn't here

223
00:26:58,107 --> 00:27:00,455
when you had the meeting to make him boss. Okay?

224
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,500
This time, no, I'm going with you.

225
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:04,945
You-You need me.

226
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:06,678
Why?

227
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:09,611
Why? Because I'm the best shot.

228
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,090
How do we know?

229
00:27:17,462 --> 00:27:19,036
Jesus Christ, Michael.

230
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,158
- What the hell ?
- How 'bout that? You know now?

231
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,958
Stay here and guard the house.

232
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:30,736
Why won't they listen to me?

233
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:33,272
Because of what you just did.

234
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:01,624
Is he dead?

235
00:28:02,628 --> 00:28:03,620
I hope so.

236
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:13,000
This fence must run the whole way around the house.

237
00:28:13,436 --> 00:28:15,084
What's that smell. I can't handle it.

238
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,547
Lukas?

239
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:26,709
Somebody's put 'em all around the house.

240
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,195
Maybe it's a warning.

241
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,930
The white knight.

242
00:28:51,372 --> 00:28:52,509
I want 'em to listen to me.

243
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,542
No doubt...I could have helped them.

244
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:01,055
It is my job.

245
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:07,343
It comes...

246
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,303
It IS my job.

247
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:16,203
How would I have this?

248
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,082
And who are you to me?

249
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,234
My wife? Girlfriend?

250
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,689
If I knew what was going on, because it's...

251
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,799
I'm not like the others, they're all smart.

252
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,774
But I'm...I'm here to do something.

253
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:41,947
How do we know one other?

254
00:29:43,776 --> 00:29:44,899
My quiet girl.

255
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,180
This thing between us...

256
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,953
It's important. I know it.

257
00:30:00,193 --> 00:30:02,366
Get in the house, get inside now. Now!

258
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,074
Just-Just move. Go!

259
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:06,172
Go inside.

260
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,868
Okay. Now you go in here, lock the door. Close it!

261
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:11,295
Now!

262
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,853
What'd you think, which way?

263
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:24,000
Really? You're throwing rocks?

264
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,874
They're our cars.

265
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:13,491
Please, help!

266
00:33:15,313 --> 00:33:15,853
Please!

267
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,869
Pleeease!

268
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:29,097
Please

269
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:33,249
Please!

270
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,330
Ohhh!

271
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,275
Okay, shhh.

272
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,161
Please, help!

273
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,050
I'm sorry.

274
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:52,749
OHHH!!!

275
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,230
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

276
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,250
It'd be easier if you were silent.

277
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,197
Please!

278
00:35:02,322 --> 00:35:04,101
Help meee!

279
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:05,794
Come on.

280
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,890
- Got a quarter tank.
- Battery's dead here.

281
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:18,092
- There's fuel inside.
- Yeah, it's okay, Nate. We can push start it.

282
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:21,405
Nate?

283
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:31,418
What's the matter?

284
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,341
Headache. Nothing.

285
00:35:39,193 --> 00:35:42,678
Okay, this is little low on
gas, but I think we should just

286
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:45,088
try and drive out of here and see what we can find.

287
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:46,356
There's no way.

288
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:49,051
What?

289
00:35:52,378 --> 00:35:53,575
You're not with us.

290
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,720
I could be the one taking the photo.

291
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:09,625
- Guys, we need to get help.
- We don't need anything.

292
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,611
We'll end up with fuel in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

293
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,025
Let's get back to the house, figure out what's goin' on.

294
00:36:22,287 --> 00:36:23,322
He's got a point.

295
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,230
Sharon?

296
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:40,168
Guys!

297
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,434
- Michael.
- Michael!

298
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:53,479
Kill me.

299
00:36:56,176 --> 00:36:57,168
Help me move him!

300
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,151
Guys, support his head.

301
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:11,045
Oh, Lukas, stop the blood.

302
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,434
Michael, I need you to look at me!

303
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:20,190
Michael! Michel, don't be dead.

304
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,575
Michael! Breathe!

305
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:24,658
- Sharon, he's...
- Michael!

306
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,718
Too much.

307
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:28,473
Try, Michael.

308
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,057
Michael!!!

309
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:34,743
Michael!!!

310
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:44,813
Please.

311
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:47,585
We were in the hospital, we could of...

312
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:50,984
I just need...

313
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:09,588
- Leave him here. Don't touch the body.
- What's wrong with you?

314
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:11,411
John! Don't go!

315
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,530
We're gonna bury him, right? I mean,

316
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:16,300
we're not just gonna leave him lying there like...

317
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:23,325
- It's my turn, we're gonna bury him for it.
- Something is happening on the 18th, that is tomorrow.

318
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,115
- We don't have time. I'm gonna to the...
- Wait!

319
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:35,250
- I think we should all stay together.
- Yeah.

320
00:38:36,678 --> 00:38:38,822
To be honest, I'm not sure.

321
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,239
Neither am I.

322
00:38:41,078 --> 00:38:41,924
Lucas?

323
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:44,606
Nathan, come on.

324
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,224
- We need to stick together.
- I won't make that call.

325
00:38:48,981 --> 00:38:50,162
I didn't have keys.

326
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:53,399
I can push-start your car. Can I please have your key?

327
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,034
Thank you.

328
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,439
- I will go.
- What?

329
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:03,465
No one should go alone.

330
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,386
Come on now.

331
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:25,164
It's already there.

332
00:39:25,426 --> 00:39:26,629
Okay, now!

333
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,797
Yes. Here we go. Hup, okay.

334
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:31,474
Stop! Stop!

335
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,326
Hey, up there on the left.

336
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:06,837
Hello!

337
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,845
It's too quiet.

338
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,250
This is empty.

339
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,924
Yeah! This, too.

340
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,984
- Did you see that?
- No, what?

341
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,525
- There's a kid.
- Where?

342
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,207
Hello!

343
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:08,174
Hello!

344
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:26,872
Hello!

345
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,518
Goddamn it, there's no one.

346
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:37,047
Sharon?

347
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:43,849
What's your name?

348
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:46,400
Come on, open the door.

349
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:50,300
Do you-Do you recognize me?

350
00:41:55,022 --> 00:41:56,845
Do you recognize this lady?

351
00:41:57,311 --> 00:42:00,658
Go away, Jonah, they're coming tomorrow.

352
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:02,669
- No.
- No, no, come back, please.

353
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,934
- No.
- No, he knows me.

354
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:05,421
He-He-He called me Jonah.

355
00:42:13,608 --> 00:42:16,000
All these languages and not one of them yours.

356
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:37,750
Okay? Hey?

357
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:39,265
Let me help you.

358
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:46,901
Get over here.

359
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:54,457
What's up?

360
00:42:56,082 --> 00:42:57,934
Piece of crap!

361
00:43:00,472 --> 00:43:01,099
My head.

362
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,297
I know you.

363
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:29,155
I know you.

364
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,903
Okay. Lukas?

365
00:43:37,362 --> 00:43:40,351
Lukas, stop it, you're...Lukas, get off of her.

366
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:41,880
Lukas!

367
00:43:42,282 --> 00:43:43,959
Stop it, stop it!

368
00:43:48,535 --> 00:43:49,059
Okay.

369
00:43:49,935 --> 00:43:50,970
Hey, relax.

370
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
Lukas, stop. Stop it!

371
00:43:58,425 --> 00:43:59,039
Okay.

372
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,372
Are you okay now?

373
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,626
I'm okay.

374
00:44:20,316 --> 00:44:21,118
I'm okay.

375
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
I can hear him, Sharon. He's still in there.

376
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:35,151
Fuck yourself.

377
00:44:36,652 --> 00:44:37,163
Hey!

378
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:38,957
Call your dog off.

379
00:44:40,837 --> 00:44:41,361
It's okay.

380
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:44,420
I'm not kidding around now, buddy. Call this dog off.

381
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:47,650
I'm gonna sic my dog on you, Digger not here.

382
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:50,430
Don't test me. Don't fuckin' test me.

383
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:52,800
- Just-Just-Just open the door.
- Okay. Yes, Just..

384
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:54,532
- Go away!
- What are you doing?

385
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:55,368
- Stand back.
- Stop it.

386
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:56,574
- He knows me.
- Jesus!

387
00:44:58,326 --> 00:45:00,163
Leave us alone, Jonah!

388
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:01,945
But he cannot get away!

389
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:03,970
- Do you hear that? I'm not going away.
- Stop it!

390
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:05,112
- Here.
- Darn you.

391
00:45:05,113 --> 00:45:06,222
- Stay out of this, Sharon.
- Stop it!

392
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:07,925
- Stay out of this.
- Stop it!

393
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:12,537
Jake, this isn't helping, please. This is not gonna help.

394
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,822
- Stand back.
- Jesus!

395
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:19,727
- How do you know me?
- I don't need to see you,

396
00:45:19,728 --> 00:45:22,294
Let me go. Let me go.

397
00:45:23,145 --> 00:45:26,931
Please, please we do need some answers. Okay, please.

398
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,429
Please, you can come out.

399
00:45:29,823 --> 00:45:30,567
Damn it.

400
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,338
Out of the way!

401
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:37,893
I can feel it.

402
00:45:45,462 --> 00:45:48,000
Stop! What the fuck are you doing?

403
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:50,772
- I'm gonna cut the fucking door.
- It's a child!

404
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:54,320
He knows me. He knows my name.

405
00:45:59,085 --> 00:46:00,689
I, eh, I don't even know my name.

406
00:46:03,883 --> 00:46:05,064
This isn't  you.

407
00:46:27,707 --> 00:46:29,238
Okay, symptoms.

408
00:46:29,883 --> 00:46:34,767
Headache, nausea, hyper-ventilating.

409
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:36,620
Marisus.

410
00:46:38,372 --> 00:46:39,232
Violent.

411
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:43,075
Yes. Do you think that...?

412
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:47,676
I wish I could speak your language.

413
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:53,057
Well, erh, there was a woman.

414
00:46:53,305 --> 00:46:55,105
She was-She was tied up.

415
00:46:55,851 --> 00:46:57,659
She was blind in one eye.

416
00:46:58,224 --> 00:46:59,649
She had, eh, eh, bad eye.

417
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:02,580
The one you were feeding. They told me about it.

418
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:03,863
Yeah.

419
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,249
I need your help.

420
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:11,830
Please help me.

421
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,778
I know this place.

422
00:47:53,785 --> 00:47:55,082
She escaped.

423
00:48:04,062 --> 00:48:06,015
I think there's a path around the lake.

424
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,986
I need to know where it leads.

425
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:38,612
I'm goin'.

426
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:55,995
My name is Nathan. Nathan.

427
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,751
Nathan's my name.

428
00:48:59,828 --> 00:49:00,645
I remember.

429
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:06,903
You called me Nate.

430
00:49:08,537 --> 00:49:12,600
Trees, cracked by lightning.

431
00:49:15,064 --> 00:49:15,997
Two trees.

432
00:49:16,812 --> 00:49:18,241
Either side of the path.

433
00:49:19,675 --> 00:49:21,411
And...And...

434
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:25,380
Tree trunk.

435
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:37,032
- I'm in the front.
- Nate!

436
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,965
What is happening is your fault.

437
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:40,922
- No, I never even...
- ...a fucking babysister.

438
00:50:40,923 --> 00:50:41,525
Stop it, you...

439
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,217
- Stop it!
- ...a cyclops.

440
00:50:43,218 --> 00:50:44,550
Not my fuckin' fault.

441
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:47,445
I didn't do this. I didn't do any of this.

442
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:51,661
You have the only type. Come on, help me, Nathan.

443
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:54,832
- Nathan, act like normal.
- Vicki.

444
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:56,012
John, handle this.

445
00:51:02,657 --> 00:51:03,475
You married?

446
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,566
You know.

447
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:47,090
Don't leave me alone, please.

448
00:51:50,476 --> 00:51:52,299
Not going to hurt you.

449
00:51:55,064 --> 00:51:57,675
Don't leave me alone.

450
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,945
I know I can trust you.

451
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:10,838
You can trust me.

452
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,455
I had your hand.

453
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:23,575
I remember you smiling at me.

454
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:26,330
I remember you.

455
00:52:31,095 --> 00:52:32,786
Let me innn!

456
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:55,359
I'm not going to hurt you.

457
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:10,753
Helen.

458
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,870
Your name is Helen.

459
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:33,250
I'm sorry about-about your daughter.

460
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:35,370
We wanted to help.

461
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,126
Day 96, eh, this is subject 143,

462
00:56:25,127 --> 00:56:27,218
who I captured in the woods.

463
00:56:27,827 --> 00:56:31,303
He's the first positive result that I've had, and, eh,

464
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,442
he's responding to the injection, I believe.

465
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:35,134
It proves that I'm onto something.

466
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:41,917
And then, eh, one unfortunate side
effect is a period of unconsciousness.

467
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,247
followed by acute memory loss, but...

468
00:56:46,238 --> 00:56:47,419
You don't remember anything.

469
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:52,685
...two stages that he's going...the
first stage is a rest cycle...he looks, eh,

470
00:56:52,802 --> 00:56:57,092
...calm, almost dead...heartbeat
decreases to thirty beats per minute...

471
00:56:57,165 --> 00:56:59,191
I don't know why it's wearing off so quickly...

472
00:56:59,192 --> 00:57:01,625
I-I just...I need it to hold.

473
00:57:02,195 --> 00:57:03,347
I need it to hold.

474
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:06,563
Why is he not responding? It should work! It should work.

475
00:57:06,564 --> 00:57:07,931
Look, I'm trying everything.

476
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:09,032
Her blood should...

477
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:11,131
Now you can see...

478
00:57:12,088 --> 00:57:12,700
It looks like...

479
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:14,573
Something from in his head...

480
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:17,570
He's got increased strength.

481
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,018
Do you remember your family?

482
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,525
I can't remember my mother, who
doesn't remember their own mother?

483
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,659
I know that I know you.

484
00:57:42,103 --> 00:57:43,707
I feel like I know you.

485
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:49,922
Sometimes, I, eh...

486
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,299
I feel like I might of...

487
00:57:54,091 --> 00:57:55,928
I've done some things I wasn't proud of.

488
00:57:56,968 --> 00:57:59,650
That I might not...like the man I was, you know?

489
00:58:00,985 --> 00:58:01,641
Watch out!

490
00:58:09,105 --> 00:58:10,709
Where the hell did that come from?

491
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:21,776
What's that sound?

492
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,870
Be careful, I've got a bad feeling about this.

493
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,042
- Don't...I don...
- Excuse me!

494
00:58:57,043 --> 00:58:57,949
I don't like it.

495
00:59:02,262 --> 00:59:03,750
- Excuse me!
- No! Shhh.

496
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:08,914
Let's go.

497
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:12,018
- Please...
- Okay, maybe you were right.

498
00:59:15,226 --> 00:59:15,853
Come on.

499
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,730
Come on.

500
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,451
Oh, my God, they're coming.

501
00:59:36,464 --> 00:59:38,840
- Please! Get out of here! Get out of here!
- Fuck it!

502
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,074
Put it in reverse. Put it in reverse.

503
00:59:48,949 --> 00:59:53,257
Goddamn it. They're right on me.
They're right on me...Goddamn...

504
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,230
What?

505
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,530
They don't like this.

506
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,491
The smell or something.

507
01:00:19,224 --> 01:00:20,580
It's just hysterical.

508
01:00:20,974 --> 01:00:23,425
Someone hung 'em up on purpose.

509
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:25,349
They're being used like scarecrows.

510
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:42,543
Be careful.

511
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:49,575
You're a sick fuck.

512
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:53,624
I knew it was you.

513
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:57,061
Lukas, put your fuckin' gun down,
man. You're losing your mind.

514
01:00:58,213 --> 01:00:59,394
What you did to me?

515
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,040
- Who are you?
- What are you talking about, man?

516
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,212
Lukas...what are you doing?

517
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:08,490
It's him, Shar.

518
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,650
That's all I need.

519
01:01:11,675 --> 01:01:13,675
I told you. You shouldn't have let him out.

520
01:01:15,143 --> 01:01:17,359
He was doing experiments on us, or something.

521
01:01:18,725 --> 01:01:20,155
He had us all in prison.

522
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:22,932
He's a murderer.

523
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:25,775
John?

524
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,216
What's he talking about?

525
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:34,107
What's on the tape?

526
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:39,278
I-I don't know.

527
01:01:40,837 --> 01:01:42,091
I can't remember.

528
01:01:44,525 --> 01:01:48,719
I was-I was trying to tell you, in the car, and...

529
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:51,169
I've been having some memories...

530
01:01:52,158 --> 01:01:54,636
Bad memories, of doing really bad things.

531
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,038
For God's sake, Sharon. Can you trust me, please.

532
01:02:01,503 --> 01:02:02,670
I wanted to tell you.

533
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:07,561
...I just know how. I saw it...

534
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,578
You knew me and, like I knew you, and...

535
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:12,825
- Sharon?
- Please, I was hoping...

536
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:15,120
maybe I was somebody else, because I knew you.

537
01:02:17,496 --> 01:02:18,006
Please.

538
01:02:18,007 --> 01:02:19,475
- You stay back!
- I just...

539
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,063
Okay.

540
01:02:20,064 --> 01:02:22,240
You don't fuckin' move or I shoot you where you stand

541
01:02:22,241 --> 01:02:23,787
and hang you from the next fuckin' tree.

542
01:02:25,851 --> 01:02:28,525
- Watch it. Come on, Sharon. Watch it!

543
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:33,178
Have a look.

544
01:02:41,189 --> 01:02:42,122
What is it, Shar?

545
01:02:45,243 --> 01:02:46,293
What's on the tape?

546
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,163
I have some needle marks on my arm.

547
01:02:51,295 --> 01:02:51,805
See?

548
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:55,775
I bet they're on you, too.

549
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,638
What's that? Is that for me?

550
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:01,825
- Lukas, Goddamn...
- You shut the fuck up!

551
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:03,434
Okay.

552
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:09,505
I don't remember. Did I do that?

553
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,232
Lukas, did I do this to her?

554
01:03:11,364 --> 01:03:12,340
I'll kill you.

555
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:16,740
I just want to know what I did. I'm
not sure. I remember pieces, but I don't...

556
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:20,542
Lukas, please listen to me. Okay, I will-I
will turn around. And I wouldn't hurt you.

557
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:21,868
- No.
- Sharon, please don't hate...

558
01:03:48,428 --> 01:03:49,588
You crawl.

559
01:03:50,145 --> 01:03:51,836
Get into the pit with all your victims.

560
01:03:51,837 --> 01:03:53,197
Twisted fuck!

561
01:03:53,198 --> 01:03:54,758
No, not in there, man. Come on.

562
01:03:54,759 --> 01:03:56,041
- Go!
- No!

563
01:03:56,989 --> 01:04:00,075
Okay. Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

564
01:04:23,332 --> 01:04:24,295
Lukas!

565
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,924
Take it yourself.

566
01:04:49,689 --> 01:04:50,870
Who are you?

567
01:05:08,093 --> 01:05:09,405
Did you get blood in your mouth?

568
01:05:22,401 --> 01:05:24,750
We'll try, okay? We'll try.

569
01:05:25,514 --> 01:05:28,809
We'll pack up and get the fuck out of this.

570
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:35,684
Give me your key. Give me your
keys. I'll go and get your car.

571
01:05:38,328 --> 01:05:39,525
What about Nathan?

572
01:05:40,276 --> 01:05:41,151
Did he know?

573
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:42,534
Who?

574
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:44,564
Nathan.

575
01:05:47,258 --> 01:05:48,949
No, no.

576
01:05:50,378 --> 01:05:52,886
The one in the pit is the one who did this.

577
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:54,673
It's-It's John.

578
01:06:04,103 --> 01:06:04,920
Lukas.

579
01:06:09,395 --> 01:06:11,815
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

580
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:14,538
I'm all fucked up.

581
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:18,215
Because your Nazi boyfriend's doing experiments on me.

582
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:19,826
Lukas.

583
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:23,507
You need to sit down. You don't look well.

584
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:27,881
No, no. You're safe with me.

585
01:06:30,307 --> 01:06:31,591
You are safe now.

586
01:06:32,414 --> 01:06:34,500
Do you hear me? You're safe with me.

587
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:37,214
I...I'll take care of you. Okay?

588
01:06:37,215 --> 01:06:37,839
Lukas.

589
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,302
- My hand...
- You're scaring me, okay?

590
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:41,790
I'll take care of you, too.

591
01:06:46,228 --> 01:06:47,468
You're safe with me.

592
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:50,625
They tried to take you away from me, but you're safe now.

593
01:06:52,205 --> 01:06:54,130
Lukas. Please.

594
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,413
Hit me.

595
01:06:57,252 --> 01:06:58,892
- You're sick.
- I'm okay.

596
01:07:02,822 --> 01:07:03,800
I'm okay.

597
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:09,567
- Lukas.
- Don't touch him!

598
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:15,800
I told you. They won't protect you.

599
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:17,824
Remember.

600
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:18,595
Where are you?

601
01:07:36,766 --> 01:07:39,274
Look at me. Look at me!

602
01:07:39,691 --> 01:07:41,047
Look at me!!

603
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,350
Remember me. You love me.

604
01:07:44,808 --> 01:07:46,586
You know me!!

605
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,400
Beautiful girl.

606
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:04,466
Get off of her!

607
01:09:18,245 --> 01:09:19,368
March the 18th.

608
01:09:21,764 --> 01:09:22,974
There's no time left.

609
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,147
The kid knew me.

610
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,039
We need to get back to that building.

611
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:36,340
You need to stay away from me, I
may not be safe to be around you.

612
01:09:38,828 --> 01:09:40,068
I need answers.

613
01:09:41,328 --> 01:09:42,422
Get in the house.

614
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:43,787
Go!

615
01:10:10,524 --> 01:10:11,501
Jonah?

616
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:40,503
Hello?

617
01:11:44,075 --> 01:11:45,461
Please be careful with this.

618
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,780
This is our last chance.

619
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:50,295
We only have a couple of days.

620
01:11:58,139 --> 01:11:59,028
Last chance.

621
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,986
Last chance for what?

622
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:04,574
The 18th.

623
01:12:05,747 --> 01:12:08,095
Come on, man, think. What happens on the 18th?

624
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:30,380
You have to follow the main road.

625
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,813
They'll meet you there.

626
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:49,322
Do not stop for any...

627
01:12:50,201 --> 01:12:51,455
Where were you going?

628
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:55,782
Goddamn it, who were you meeting? Come on, man.

629
01:12:56,858 --> 01:12:59,249
- You have to follow the main road.
- Fuck!

630
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:40,366
...fuck is going on?

631
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:55,970
I'm not gonna hurt you.

632
01:13:56,976 --> 01:13:57,953
I just need to get 'em.

633
01:14:05,685 --> 01:14:06,691
Give 'em to me.

634
01:14:07,012 --> 01:14:08,878
Just hand 'em to me, you crazy bitch.

635
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:11,295
No, no. No!

636
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:16,247
You gotta be kidding me.

637
01:15:09,778 --> 01:15:10,770
Jonah!

638
01:15:11,225 --> 01:15:12,698
- You!
- Hey.

639
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,655
Do you know me?

640
01:15:16,983 --> 01:15:18,893
'Cause...that kid knows me.

641
01:15:19,245 --> 01:15:22,788
You are one of them. Stay away from my family.

642
01:15:23,114 --> 01:15:24,703
No more needles.

643
01:15:27,066 --> 01:15:28,174
Is this your daughter?

644
01:15:30,295 --> 01:15:31,811
You hurt us all, Jonah.

645
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:36,800
I leave you your life, 'coz I'm not like you.

646
01:15:37,943 --> 01:15:40,130
- Run and hide.
- What?

647
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:41,176
What do you mean?

648
01:15:41,555 --> 01:15:43,012
Wait, hang on, hang on. Listen. Wait.

649
01:15:43,013 --> 01:15:44,809
Wait, wait, listen, please. Just hang on.

650
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:46,047
I just want to talk to you.

651
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:49,922
Please, just tell me. What did I do?

652
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:52,093
Please, I just want to talk to you!

653
01:15:54,725 --> 01:15:56,024
Where are you going?

654
01:16:31,272 --> 01:16:32,643
Overgrown brain.

655
01:16:33,357 --> 01:16:35,267
Possible reason for a headache.

656
01:16:35,964 --> 01:16:37,728
White matter is decomposing.

657
01:16:42,356 --> 01:16:45,520
The army will meet you there.
They know what to do with it.

658
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,266
The army.

659
01:17:16,847 --> 01:17:18,786
What does the military have to do with this?

660
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:24,293
You're Jonah Cook.

661
01:17:25,345 --> 01:17:26,482
Jonah Cook.

662
01:17:49,908 --> 01:17:50,855
Sharon?

663
01:17:57,605 --> 01:17:58,725
Stop!

664
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,293
Stop!

665
01:18:13,249 --> 01:18:14,007
Lukas.

666
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:19,116
You suppose that you're sick.

667
01:18:20,995 --> 01:18:23,488
Calm down, man. This will help you.

668
01:18:23,549 --> 01:18:25,401
- I was helping you.
- Go away.

669
01:18:25,735 --> 01:18:26,959
Lukas, I was helping you!

670
01:18:27,149 --> 01:18:28,869
I was helping all of you.

671
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:47,800
Lukas? Lukas?

672
01:18:47,876 --> 01:18:52,076
I'm remembering things. My name is-is Jonah.

673
01:18:52,285 --> 01:18:55,083
Do you remember me, I'm a doctor. You've been infected.

674
01:18:55,346 --> 01:18:56,775
I need to inject you with this.

675
01:18:57,655 --> 01:18:58,836
It can help you.

676
01:18:59,853 --> 01:19:02,186
Look at me, you remember me. Look at me.

677
01:19:02,722 --> 01:19:05,259
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
Please, just give me your arm.

678
01:19:05,463 --> 01:19:08,335
I was just trying to help. The dose has worn off.

679
01:19:08,336 --> 01:19:09,350
I need...No, no!

680
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:09,916
Come on, man!

681
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:12,616
Lukas.

682
01:19:14,057 --> 01:19:14,568
Fuck!

683
01:19:24,733 --> 01:19:26,351
...help you, Lukas!

684
01:19:40,483 --> 01:19:42,086
Lukas? Come on.

685
01:19:43,267 --> 01:19:45,376
I need you to...Lukas.

686
01:19:45,391 --> 01:19:46,956
Look at me, look at me.

687
01:19:48,589 --> 01:19:50,543
Stay with me, stay with me, come on.

688
01:19:52,728 --> 01:19:53,807
I ...

689
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,766
I have a headache in my head

690
01:20:02,018 --> 01:20:04,118
And I cannot run away from it.

691
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:09,245
I know you...Jonah.

692
01:20:09,463 --> 01:20:12,081
Yeah. Yeah, I know you, too. Come on.

693
01:20:12,824 --> 01:20:14,676
I know you. Look at me.

694
01:20:15,275 --> 01:20:16,995
Look at me. I know you.

695
01:20:35,461 --> 01:20:37,983
I want to say thank you, Jonah, and

696
01:20:38,395 --> 01:20:40,375
to all of you for saving my life.

697
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:44,721
And, also, you give me my memory back. I...

698
01:20:45,509 --> 01:20:49,037
I've really missed them. Well, most of them.

699
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:54,725
- Memories.
- To memory.

700
01:20:54,726 --> 01:20:55,761
- To memory.
- Memory.

701
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:15,436
How'd she get out, Nathan?

702
01:21:17,075 --> 01:21:18,593
Nathan, did you lock up?

703
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:27,245
Go check the other cell. Be careful.

704
01:21:27,595 --> 01:21:29,038
They haven't all been treated.

705
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:36,090
Why am I here, Jonah? Why am I here?

706
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:38,325
You gonna play big brother, now?

707
01:21:38,797 --> 01:21:40,853
- Don't go down there!
- It's my fault!

708
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:44,375
It's not my fuckin' fault. I didn't do this.

709
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,072
I didn't do any of this.

710
01:21:47,063 --> 01:21:48,390
Help me figure it next time.

711
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,300
Take it yourself.

712
01:22:01,643 --> 01:22:02,547
Jonah.

713
01:22:14,822 --> 01:22:17,111
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

714
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,368
Jonaaaaah!

715
01:22:24,489 --> 01:22:25,539
Jonaaah!

716
01:22:26,982 --> 01:22:27,944
Jonaaah!

717
01:22:39,653 --> 01:22:40,426
Sharon.

718
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:46,670
It's me.

719
01:22:53,745 --> 01:22:54,576
It's me.

720
01:23:03,343 --> 01:23:04,538
I remember.

721
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:08,149
What was that?

722
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:12,507
- Tell me what to do!
- Get down!

723
01:23:24,676 --> 01:23:28,050
Come on. Come on, Shar. Come on.

724
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:36,125
Where is...forgotten what the purpose
or source? Do you copy, do you read?

725
01:23:36,168 --> 01:23:39,990
They're everywhere. They're out of
control. They've escaped. Do you copy?

726
01:23:39,991 --> 01:23:43,489
Michael, gather the group up
in the house and inject yourselves.

727
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:45,647
That's crazy. It's not finished. We didn't test it.

728
01:23:45,648 --> 01:23:49,794
Sharon! Sharon, listen. You've no time.
You have to inject yourself. If you...

729
01:23:54,099 --> 01:23:55,164
Oh, shit!

730
01:23:58,343 --> 01:23:59,189
I've been bit.

731
01:24:04,233 --> 01:24:05,982
We're not going to remember.

732
01:24:10,599 --> 01:24:11,970
My name is Jonah...

733
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,942
No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on.

734
01:24:28,003 --> 01:24:28,674
Okay.

735
01:24:29,316 --> 01:24:30,205
All right.

736
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:44,436
Did you see that?

737
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:46,075
Yes. Okay.

738
01:24:49,674 --> 01:24:51,045
Where'd they come from?

739
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:53,057
Scarecrows didn't stop 'em.

740
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,325
Oh, my God, they're everywhere.

741
01:24:57,447 --> 01:24:59,022
Take this, kill some.

742
01:25:01,282 --> 01:25:02,434
Here we go. Go!

743
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:07,218
Oh, my God!

744
01:25:12,993 --> 01:25:13,459
Fuck!

745
01:25:20,218 --> 01:25:20,670
Shit!

746
01:25:20,671 --> 01:25:21,832
I had to tell Jonah.

747
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:24,826
Jesus!

748
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:29,825
Just in case he doesn't remember.

749
01:25:30,805 --> 01:25:32,147
In case we don't make it.

750
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:44,050
We are here to help.

751
01:25:45,566 --> 01:25:46,762
But we failed.

752
01:25:52,641 --> 01:25:53,982
The plague spread.

753
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:06,159
Sharon.

754
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:08,995
Sharon, please remember.

755
01:26:17,697 --> 01:26:19,811
The 18th, we're out of time.

756
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:22,970
They're coming.

757
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:49,795
They're coming.

758
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:51,397
18.

759
01:26:53,383 --> 01:26:54,884
The rescue party.

760
01:26:55,897 --> 01:26:58,625
They're coming on the 18th, the dawn of the 18th.

761
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:01,059
The 18th. We're...Hey!

762
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,745
Hey! Don't shoot!

763
01:27:03,226 --> 01:27:04,961
- We're-We're safe.
- Are we?

764
01:27:04,962 --> 01:27:05,821
It's over.

765
01:27:05,909 --> 01:27:08,007
Sharon, it's over. Hey!

766
01:27:08,008 --> 01:27:09,990
We're alive in here!

767
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:14,396
I'll go get 'em. I'll go get 'em. Hey! Hey!

768
01:27:14,397 --> 01:27:18,115
Hey! Don't shoot. Hey! We're alive in here!

769
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,128
Don't shoot.

770
01:27:22,018 --> 01:27:24,030
Sharon! Come on!

771
01:27:24,365 --> 01:27:25,707
Come on!

772
01:27:26,176 --> 01:27:27,503
Hey! We're alive!

773
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:31,999
Hello?

774
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:34,959
Hello!

775
01:27:37,305 --> 01:27:38,749
Sharon!

776
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:49,340
Hellooooo!

777
01:27:50,075 --> 01:27:51,330
Sharonnn!

778
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,100
Is there anybody there?!

779
01:27:58,572 --> 01:28:01,125
Standing by for orders.

780
01:28:05,612 --> 01:28:07,405
Green light. No survivors.

781
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,416
There was, of course, no rescuers.

782
01:28:21,559 --> 01:28:22,974
Please.

783
01:28:23,362 --> 01:28:24,266
No, wait.

784
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:44,300
I'm so sorry. I'm...

785
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:45,391
I remember.

786
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:48,410
I remember

787
01:29:50,735 --> 01:29:53,550
That was my brother. That was my brother.

788
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:55,074
Sorry.

789
01:30:26,335 --> 01:30:28,332
Wait. Wait, we need her...

790
01:30:31,532 --> 01:30:32,509
Sharon?

791
01:30:43,143 --> 01:30:45,199
Sweetest! Oh! Oh God!

792
01:30:45,761 --> 01:30:46,574
You okay?

793
01:30:47,903 --> 01:30:48,979
Is she dead, too?

794
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:49,651
Fuck!

795
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:58,359
Put this on, put this on. Hold on.

796
01:31:02,535 --> 01:31:06,550
Come on, the soldiers are coming.
We need to hide. Come on, come on.

797
01:31:08,274 --> 01:31:10,724
Hurry up, they're coming. Come on, we gotta hide.

798
01:31:12,785 --> 01:31:15,015
Come on, come on. That's it.

799
01:31:15,394 --> 01:31:16,225
There, that's it.

800
01:31:34,459 --> 01:31:35,670
Come on, come on.

801
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:41,075
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

802
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:43,720
Hang on. Hang on.

803
01:31:43,721 --> 01:31:44,930
I have to stop the bleeding.

804
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:50,125
Look at me. They will find us.

805
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:02,116
Okay. Give me your arm,

806
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:04,300
- Jonah?
- give me your arm. I need your arm.

807
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:05,971
We're just gonna hide.

808
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:12,597
And we'll pretend we're dead, then wake up, okay?

809
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:16,434
- Jonah.
- Yes.

810
01:32:16,435 --> 01:32:17,514
Jonah, listen to me.

811
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:24,522
- What is this?
- You have to read it.

812
01:32:24,523 --> 01:32:28,531
Jonah. Remember this. Read it.

813
01:32:28,983 --> 01:32:32,103
This time, you have to do it right. Please.

814
01:32:32,543 --> 01:32:34,468
Hey. I mean seriously.

815
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,517
Please, you will tell them. Don't forget.

816
01:32:39,385 --> 01:32:40,055
Please!

817
01:32:41,643 --> 01:32:42,591
I love you.

818
01:32:43,483 --> 01:32:45,188
I will never forget you.

819
01:32:47,381 --> 01:32:51,128
- I love you, too. We need to sleep, okay.
- I know you.

820
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:52,422
I'm scared.

821
01:32:54,314 --> 01:32:56,750
- I don't want to die.
- You won't die.

822
01:32:56,775 --> 01:32:59,361
You won't die. This will work. I won't forget you.

823
01:33:10,664 --> 01:33:11,553
I'm Jonah.

824
01:33:14,426 --> 01:33:15,490
My name is Jonah.

825
01:33:57,174 --> 01:33:59,245
Unit 2, return back to base.

826
01:34:42,147 --> 01:34:43,168
My love,

827
01:34:45,551 --> 01:34:47,068
I remembered everything.

828
01:34:51,177 --> 01:34:53,931
We were doctors on the verge of finding a cure

829
01:34:53,932 --> 01:34:57,432
for an awful plague that has cast the world into darkness.

830
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:07,476
Help me! Please, help me!

831
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,189
The mute woman is the answer.

832
01:35:14,731 --> 01:35:17,209
Her blood is immune to the virus.

833
01:35:17,632 --> 01:35:19,353
You must protect her.

834
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:29,928
You'll find death and madness everywhere.

835
01:35:31,637 --> 01:35:34,670
And you have to fight to finish what we started.

836
01:35:42,895 --> 01:35:44,747
We have no time, Jonah.

837
01:35:46,205 --> 01:35:48,873
There are still people waiting to be saved.

838
01:35:53,362 --> 01:35:55,593
I know your memory will come back to you.

839
01:35:58,289 --> 01:35:59,455
When it does...

840
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:03,351
Remember I love you.

841
01:36:03,361 --> 01:36:06,551
