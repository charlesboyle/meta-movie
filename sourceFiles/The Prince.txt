1
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:34,936
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, pal.

2
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:49,486
Hey, you.

3
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,020
Hi, Dad.

4
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:52,122
Where are you?

5
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:53,990
You're not home.

6
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:56,493
No, I'm at my friend's house.

7
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:58,927
I'm calling from my phone, so...

8
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,564
How... how is everything?

9
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:03,633
Good. Good. Things are good.

10
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:05,935
Just, you know, I'm tired and...

11
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:07,103
I bet.

12
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:08,671
A lot of work.

13
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:09,773
A lot of books.

14
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:12,108
Yeah.

15
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,077
Oh!

16
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:16,513
Taste of Chicago, hot delivery.

17
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:18,815
Uh, want a bite? You want a bite.

18
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,418
- Oh, my God.
- One little bite.

19
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,586
I miss that place so much.

20
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,822
Stop, stop.

21
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:27,524
I'm picking you up from the airport.

22
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:29,692
We're going right there when
you come in the weekend.

23
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:31,060
Awesome.

24
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,797
Finals? Good, bad, what?

25
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,032
They were fine. Nothing too intense.

26
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:40,068
But, um... It was... it was good.

27
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:43,006
What's the matter?

28
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,674
No, what? What do you mean?

29
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:47,811
Oh, nothing, I...
I, um, just a little, uh...

30
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:50,013
you seem a little down.

31
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:52,749
I don't know, maybe I'm
getting the flu or something.

32
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,117
- I don't know.
- What the fuck are you doing?

33
00:05:57,654 --> 00:06:00,490
I... I gotta go. I...

34
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:03,693
I have an exam tomorrow,
and, um, I should go.

35
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:05,929
Okay.

36
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,898
Yeah, I don't want to
keep you from studying.

37
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:11,233
Dad...

38
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:17,207
I... I can't wait for next weekend.

39
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:20,041
Me, too.

40
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,079
Miss you.

41
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,514
I miss you.

42
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,648
Take care.

43
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:30,118
Bye.

44
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,189
What?

45
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:07,650
Yeah?

46
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:10,620
Hey, uh, who's... Wh-who's this?

47
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:12,088
Who's this?

48
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,289
You're the one calling me.

49
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,991
I'm, uh, Beth's father.

50
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:18,328
I'm looking for Beth. Is she there?

51
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:21,064
Shit, this ain't even my phone.

52
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:45,054
Hi, you've reached Beth.
You know what to do.

53
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:48,257
Hey, Beth, it's dad.

54
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:50,693
Um... I just called your phone,

55
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:53,096
and, uh, I don't know,
some guy answered it.

56
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:54,397
He didn't seem to know who
you were, so I wond...

57
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:57,233
I... did you lose your
phone or something?

58
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:59,769
But, uh, if you did,
you're probably not getting this.

59
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,137
Anyway, uh, give me a call.

60
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:04,674
Also, yeah, I got a, uh...
a notice from school

61
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:06,943
about something,
but I'll... you know,

62
00:09:06,944 --> 00:09:09,577
we'll talk about it, um...

63
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:12,181
Just call me.

64
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:13,783
All right, bye-bye.

65
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,925
Hey, it's Dad.

66
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:25,161
Just calling again.

67
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:27,397
Don't want to bother you, just, um...

68
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:29,198
I don't know, just give me a call.

69
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,466
Thanks.

70
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:41,744
Westwood Palms.

71
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,680
Yes, this is Paul Brennan.

72
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,348
Uh, my daughter is Beth Brennan.

73
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:48,685
I called earlier and I
talked to a, uh... a Justin.

74
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,420
Uh, he was gonna go check on her.

75
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,722
Um, I've been trying to call.
There's no answer.

76
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:56,157
Doesn't look like anybody's
been there for a while.

77
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,626
Okay.

78
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,098
Thank you.

79
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:46,836
- There you go.
- Okay.

80
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,814
Let me, uh... let me
ask you something.

81
00:11:57,815 --> 00:12:01,450
You see either of these...
Two girls here tonight?

82
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:02,585
Couldn't tell you, man.

83
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,887
After a while,
they all look the same.

84
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:07,322
Okay.

85
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:31,013
Excuse me, uh, I'm wondering if
you could help me for a second.

86
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:32,849
Whatcha drinkin'?

87
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,417
No, no, I just, uh...

88
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:36,419
I-I-I'm looking for my daughter...

89
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,588
In the stripes.

90
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:41,090
Well, like the sign says,
you want a beer or a shot of whisky?

91
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:43,860
No, no, I just...

92
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:45,595
Have you seen either of
these girls here tonight?

93
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:47,630
All right, here it is.

94
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:49,632
It's gonna be $4.00.

95
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:52,201
How 'bout this?

96
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:56,639
You just take this 20, look at the
picture, and give me an answer.

97
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:03,346
Sorry, buddy, haven't seen either of
them tonight. Good luck with that.

98
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,580
Can I have a water, please?

99
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,417
Water.

100
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,921
Thank you.

101
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:18,494
Here you go.

102
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,029
Thank you.

103
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:28,537
And I won't have to lose it.

104
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:30,106
Don't be aggressive.

105
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:33,276
- Go to the next bar.
- Yeah.

106
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:35,011
Let's go. That'd be nice.

107
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:36,279
Excuse me.

108
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Not interested.

109
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,581
Just give me a second.

110
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:41,918
Miss, I'm... I'm Beth's father.

111
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,154
- Really?
- Nick, uh, it's okay.

112
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,956
Where'd you get this?

113
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:49,025
From her apartment,
which I've been calling for a week,

114
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:50,493
and there's no answer,
so I'm just wondering...

115
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:53,095
Oh, so you've been
going though her stuff.

116
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:54,664
Well, I'm worried about her.

117
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:57,967
I don't know where she is.

118
00:13:57,968 --> 00:13:59,535
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

119
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:01,003
- Yeah, this place sucks.
- Yeah.

120
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,205
Let me ask you one thing...

121
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:04,206
- Hey, wait!
- Hey!

122
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:05,508
Let go of her, asshole!

123
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,677
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!

124
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,679
That's enough. Everybody...

125
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:12,982
Hey, hey! Come on!

126
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:16,018
Can you help me? Just five minutes.

127
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,552
That's all.

128
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:22,024
Uh, hey, you guys go ahead.
I'm gonna meet up with you later.

129
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,592
This is such bullshit.

130
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:26,996
- I said I'll meet up with you later.
- Whatever.

131
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:29,098
Uhh.

132
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,199
Are you all right?

133
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,034
I'm fine.

134
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:33,736
Just a few questions.

135
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:35,204
I already told you,
I don't know where she is.

136
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,039
You're her friend, right?

137
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,708
So you know her. You have some ideas.

138
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,443
Anything, where she... I... I...

139
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:43,678
Five minutes. Give me five minutes.

140
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,582
I'm hungry.

141
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,093
So you haven't heard from her.

142
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,761
People change. We're in college.

143
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:01,697
We have lots of distractions.
It's real...

144
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,099
I understand that, I understand that.

145
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,035
It's just I don't know where she is.
That's never been the case before.

146
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:07,303
You're her friend, you're telling
me you don't know where she is.

147
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:10,339
So... any help you can give me.

148
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,375
I'm not a bad person.

149
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:15,444
Okay, I do what any other
person my age does.

150
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:18,147
I like to go out. I like to party.
I like to have a good time.

151
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:20,783
I work hard. Beth?

152
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:22,184
She doesn't go to school anymore.

153
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:24,787
She... is doing shit
that I'm not into.

154
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:28,057
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

155
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:30,126
You do know, you said...
what does that mean?

156
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:33,265
So, a month ago,
we went to New Orleans,

157
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,431
and ended up meeting
this guy named Eddie.

158
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:37,733
Thinks he's this bad-ass because

159
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,569
he's got drugs everywhere,
and everyone here probably knows him,

160
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,105
'cause they go to him
to get some shit.

161
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:47,675
But... she fell for
it and fell for him.

162
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:50,212
She said she was gonna
go down last week

163
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,415
and that she'd be back Sunday,
and I haven't heard from her.

164
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,452
- Do you know this guy?
- Everybody knows this guy.

165
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:57,771
Yeah, but do you...
do you know where he works?

166
00:15:57,772 --> 00:15:59,822
Do you know where he lives? Do you know
where he deals? Any of those things?

167
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:02,058
I told you, New Orleans.
Are you not listening?

168
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:05,061
New Orleans is a big city. Do you
know where you can find him?

169
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:09,130
I'm... yeah. I know
people that know him.

170
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:14,136
Can you drive me down there
right now? I'll give you some money.

171
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:17,206
Um, I don't know if you can
tell I'm really drunk.

172
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,674
- I'll drive your car.
- I cannot drive.

173
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:21,577
I'll give you $500. We drive down.
Just point out where he lives.

174
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,864
It doesn't matter, whenever we
get there. You can go right back.

175
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,815
- That's all I'm asking.
- Wait, can you just go back a second?

176
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,850
- You'll...
- Did you say $500?

177
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:30,051
Yeah.

178
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,522
- Are you messing with me?
- No.

179
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:40,928
- I mean, it's the middle of the night.
- Now.

180
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,867
Thank you. Check!

181
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:08,689
Can I ask you something?

182
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,628
- Yeah.
- If you're so worried about Beth,

183
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,830
why wouldn't you just call the cops?

184
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:17,433
Because they wouldn't even
do anything for 48 hours...

185
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:19,235
Unless I reported her missing.

186
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:22,338
And even then, they're not
gonna give it any priority.

187
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,673
They'd just assume she's
some teen who ran away.

188
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,911
Which she kind of has,
if you think about it.

189
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,185
Not the Beth I know.

190
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:40,721
How many Beths do
you think there are?

191
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,025
One.

192
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,744
You know what I think?

193
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,448
I think this whole
thing's your fault.

194
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:07,950
You're the stereotype.

195
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:10,486
You're like one of those
hard-ass parents that...

196
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:11,921
Just doesn't get it.

197
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:14,190
It's like the more you keep
someone from doing something,

198
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,758
they more they want to try it.

199
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,427
So, uh, your suggestion is that I...

200
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:20,930
I should encourage her more
to get drunk and stoned

201
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:22,932
and maybe participate in that.

202
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,767
Is that what your dad did?

203
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:27,269
No, that is not what I'm saying.

204
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,339
What I'm saying is that you should
just let her be a teenager.

205
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,209
You know, it's natural
to experience things.

206
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:36,445
And, from what I heard,
you kept her on lockdown

207
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:38,881
and you barely let her
out of the house.

208
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:41,317
What'd you expect?

209
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,751
Is that what she said?

210
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:47,289
Come on. Uhh! Come on,
you can't keep a kid locked up,

211
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,992
because then they finally get
out there in the real world,

212
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,961
and they start experiencing all the
shit that they've been missing,

213
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:53,696
and then they go crazy.

214
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:57,533
You know, it's like they're
trying to make up for lost time.

215
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,734
You are so annoying.

216
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:39,375
You think this Eddie
character will be in there?

217
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:41,877
It's where we met him.

218
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:45,848
When we get in there, I want you
to keep a little distance from me.

219
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:48,017
In this city, it's gonna
be better off for you

220
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:51,053
if people don't realize
we're together.

221
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,554
What are you talking about?

222
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,822
Just trust me on that.

223
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,597
So I'm just gonna go find a
quiet little corner to sit in.

224
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:05,034
Spend a few minutes out here,
and then follow me and...

225
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:07,403
Just do whatever you normally do.

226
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:10,773
You see this Eddie guy,
just let me know somehow.

227
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:15,544
Just... try and tell me about it,
but don't be real obvious, okay?

228
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,478
Okay.

229
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:09,098
Ahh.

230
00:21:54,676 --> 00:21:56,977
Beth?

231
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,687
You wanna dance?

232
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:08,023
Is he here?

233
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,725
Come on.

234
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:12,828
I swear, no one will
know we're together.

235
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:15,063
Just some creepy old
man and his young girl.

236
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:16,064
Easy.

237
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:17,166
Mmm.

238
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,201
Is he here?

239
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:21,836
No.

240
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:26,074
What do you want?

241
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:30,612
I'm just trying to have some fun.

242
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:33,849
Oh, I feel so good right now.

243
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,584
You should try it sometime.

244
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,023
I know a place we could go.

245
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:42,558
Like this?

246
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,626
Mm... yeah.

247
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:47,361
It's like the only place that's open.

248
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:01,147
- Would you slow down, man?
- How far away is this place?

249
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:02,711
I don't know, it's like
right down the strip.

250
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:04,513
- Like 10 or 15 minutes.
- Come on, please.

251
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:06,782
Let's go. Come on.

252
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:08,750
Wait, wait, wait.

253
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,686
Did you see that guy
in the camo vest?

254
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:12,221
- Come on, bring the girls, dude.
- That him?

255
00:23:12,222 --> 00:23:14,590
No, but I've seen
them hang out a lot.

256
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:16,525
- All right, cool.
- Wait here.

257
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:17,626
Hey, man, right up here. I'm there.

258
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:20,796
Hey... I'm, uh, looking for Eddie.

259
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:22,531
Do I know you?

260
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:24,867
Just tell me where he is,
I... I have something for him.

261
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:26,702
If you did, you'd know
where to find him.

262
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:27,936
Get the fuck out of here.

263
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:31,273
- Not until you tell me where he is.
- You just fucked yourself, buddy.

264
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,276
Get him!

265
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:39,181
Back off!

266
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:42,784
If I ever see you here again,
you're a dead man.

267
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:45,052
Crazy motherfucker.

268
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,592
You're not going anywhere.

269
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,294
Fine by me.

270
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:56,064
We can do this all day
long for all I care.

271
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:23,258
Holy shit, what was that?

272
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:25,059
Are you okay?

273
00:24:26,662 --> 00:24:28,630
Find his number. Find his number.

274
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:30,732
Send him a text, ask him where he is.

275
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,168
Well, what if I don't hear
back from him for hours?

276
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,171
That's why you need me.

277
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:46,615
Wait, wait a minute.
What the fuck was that?

278
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:47,783
Seriously!

279
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:50,319
What the fuck just happened?

280
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,622
Ohh! Can you take me home?
I wanna go home.

281
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:56,224
We're going to a place right up
here where you can crash for a bit.

282
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:57,726
You gotta come down.

283
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:59,661
Okay, on a scale of one to 10...

284
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:02,064
10 being, I don't know,
the Sistine chapel,

285
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:05,200
and one being a steaming
pile of shit...

286
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,002
how nice are we talking?

287
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:08,036
Probably a three.

288
00:25:08,037 --> 00:25:12,708
Three? That's like...
that's like two steps away from shit!

289
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,146
Can you walk?

290
00:25:18,147 --> 00:25:20,983
Seriously, are we staying here?

291
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:25,053
Oh my... you know, there's
places that aren't too expensive

292
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:26,788
that actually wash
their sheets, right?

293
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:28,991
Not today. We're here.

294
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:31,193
I know people. I can get
us a room somewhere.

295
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:35,596
Oh, I'm sure you do. We have a room.

296
00:25:44,773 --> 00:25:46,675
Okay, now that we're all settled in,

297
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:49,745
- do you want to tell me what's going on?
- We're getting some sleep.

298
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:51,645
That's not what I'm talking about.

299
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,953
You don't go to the cops.
You don't want to be seen together.

300
00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:00,722
You take me to this shit hole
in the middle of nowhere.

301
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:02,691
You beat those guys
like it was nothing.

302
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:05,160
I need some answers.

303
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:08,230
You're in no condition to
have any answers right now.

304
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:09,698
- Let's just get some sleep.
- It's fine.

305
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:11,266
I'm just tired.

306
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,370
Thank you, Beth's dad.

307
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:22,444
Ohh, can you just drive
me home, please?

308
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:25,280
I can't believe I got myself
into this shit. Oh, my God.

309
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:26,815
I have the worst headache ever.

310
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,717
This is ridiculous.

311
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,687
I'm just so tired.

312
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:35,157
Will you drive me home?
This is not what I signed up for.

313
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:37,125
I don't know why you won't
let me just, like, text the guy.

314
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:38,794
I go and I party there all the time.

315
00:26:38,795 --> 00:26:41,797
Like, we could stay
in a really nice place...

316
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:45,133
clean beds and hot showers and...

317
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,758
I'm sorry.

318
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:49,229
Who are you?

319
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:52,366
Beth's dad.

320
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:10,886
Did this hurt?

321
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,920
Yes.

322
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:21,897
Does it still hurt?

323
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:24,331
A bit.

324
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:31,173
How did she die?

325
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:33,540
Leukemia.

326
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:38,412
Beth never really talked about it.

327
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:42,916
She mentioned you.

328
00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:45,786
She missed you.

329
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:51,326
Well, I bet you helped her
with that homesickness, huh?

330
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:52,993
Mm-hmm.

331
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:56,997
Introduced her to
all the right people?

332
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:01,169
Like the ones who'll
give you a line of blow

333
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,771
for a favor in the most
convenient bathroom stall?

334
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,475
I bring my own to the party.

335
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:09,243
Oh.

336
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,924
Is that him?

337
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:29,630
Yeah.

338
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,268
He's at some bar called Excite.

339
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:51,186
He's sitting at a table
on the second floor.

340
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:54,354
You can't miss him...
he's sandwiched between two girls.

341
00:29:56,391 --> 00:29:57,525
What's this?

342
00:29:57,526 --> 00:29:59,928
It's not enough?

343
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:02,097
You want me to leave?

344
00:30:02,098 --> 00:30:04,933
We had an arrangement.

345
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:08,303
But... What about Beth?

346
00:30:08,304 --> 00:30:11,239
I didn't come all
this way to not know.

347
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,009
I need you to leave.

348
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,012
Ohh, fuck!

349
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:20,448
Black jack, Mr. Riley?

350
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:22,117
Yeah, that's good, Carl. Thanks.

351
00:30:22,118 --> 00:30:24,019
Anything else I can get you?

352
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,354
No, that's good. Leave the bottle.

353
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:43,970
Son of a bitch.

354
00:30:44,706 --> 00:30:46,207
Carl...

355
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:47,609
Bring another glass.

356
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,509
You got it, boss.

357
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:10,532
Do you mind if I take a seat?

358
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,634
Excuse me?

359
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:15,003
Mind if I sit down?

360
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,738
Who the fuck are you?

361
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:19,007
I'm looking for my daughter.

362
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,976
Her name is Beth.

363
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:22,642
Beth Brennan.

364
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:26,614
Sorry, man. Never heard of her.

365
00:31:26,615 --> 00:31:29,651
But, uh, there is a club
across the street,

366
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:33,021
and she's probably spinning
around on a pole right now.

367
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:34,422
So fuck off.

368
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:39,094
Ladies, please excuse
us for a moment.

369
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:42,030
They're not going anywhere.
Only one that's leaving is you.

370
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:46,067
Seriously. Who does this
fuckin' guy think he is?

371
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:49,270
I have no interest whatsoever
in what your business is.

372
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:52,273
I don't even care how
you know my daughter.

373
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:55,110
In fact, the less we
know about each other,

374
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:57,579
the better off you're gonna be.

375
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,017
But I wanna know, and I need
to know, where she is now.

376
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:04,753
And neither of us are leaving
this table until you tell me.

377
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:07,454
Is that a fact?

378
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:12,093
Hey, why don't you girls, uh...
take off, huh?

379
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:15,028
- What the fuck, man?
- Shut up, Eddie.

380
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:18,432
Come on, let's go!

381
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:29,177
I hope you can find it in your heart
to forgive my young friend here.

382
00:32:29,178 --> 00:32:32,047
You know how kids are these days.

383
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:35,116
Just spouting off, shooting off their
mouth when they don't know shit.

384
00:32:35,117 --> 00:32:37,085
He's not a bad kid.

385
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:39,421
He's a good kid, basically,

386
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:42,589
and I'd like to see him
live a little longer.

387
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:54,536
You don't recognize me, do you?

388
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,805
No, I can't say I do.

389
00:32:56,806 --> 00:33:00,707
I was at Stuart's the night
you took down seven people.

390
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:03,611
I'd never seen anything like it.

391
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:06,347
There was guns firing
all over the place.

392
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,087
Every time we'd shoot, we'd miss,

393
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:15,223
like you made out of...
air or something.

394
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:17,524
Like a ghost.

395
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:25,366
And then the bodies started
hitting the ground.

396
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:28,203
Seven of them, falling all around me.

397
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:29,571
I fell, too, but I wasn't hit.

398
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:31,505
Not yet.

399
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,808
You don't remember this?

400
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:40,648
You started walking across the room
to me, stepping over the bodies,

401
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:42,650
coming right for me,
like you could...

402
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:45,220
Smell that there was still
somebody alive in the room.

403
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:49,022
You put your gun right up to my head.

404
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:54,462
I waited for you to pull the trigger.

405
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:56,096
Closed my eyes.

406
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:01,735
That gunshot never came.

407
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:08,174
By the time I had the guts to
open my eyes, you were long gone.

408
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:18,251
Well... I used to drink back then.

409
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:25,927
Well, maybe you let me live
so that, 20 years later,

410
00:34:25,928 --> 00:34:28,296
we'd be sitting in a bar,
and I could tell my nephew

411
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:31,865
to tell you whatever you wanna know.

412
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:38,304
I don't know where
she is, man, I swear.

413
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:42,810
We went out a few times.
She started getting into harder stuff...

414
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:45,346
heroin... but I don't do that shit.

415
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:46,481
It's not what I do.

416
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:47,782
Where is she?

417
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:50,784
Last I knew, she was
with The Pharmacy.

418
00:34:51,352 --> 00:34:53,388
You left her at a pharmacy?

419
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,458
The Pharmacy is a scumbag drug
dealer named Tony Martinez.

420
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:00,862
Yeah, he works out of a
warehouse on the east side.

421
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:01,963
Where?

422
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:04,698
23rd and Atlantic.

423
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:10,238
I'd appreciate...

424
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,507
That you don't talk about
this conversation.

425
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:14,608
You have my word.

426
00:35:16,277 --> 00:35:19,681
Oh... Stuart's...

427
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:22,616
I ran out of ammo.

428
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:31,358
Oh, that guy gives
me the creeps, man.

429
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:38,800
Beth's my friend, all right?

430
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:40,668
I'm not just gonna get in
the car and turn around.

431
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:42,604
What part didn't you
understand about?

432
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:44,539
Aren't you glad I'm here?

433
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,640
- I'm driving.
- What would you have done?

434
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:46,641
I'm driving.

435
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:48,009
Move over.

436
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,010
- Are you gonna take a taxi?
- Let's go.

437
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:50,571
Go, go.

438
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:04,157
Come on. Let's go.

439
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,008
Remind me again who this guy is.

440
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:23,378
Former boxer, been talking
behind your back.

441
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,480
Making himself appear like...

442
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:26,814
Somebody connected to you.

443
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:30,918
I heard local vice has taken
a vested interest in him.

444
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,020
Okay.

445
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:34,389
Donny Musical.

446
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,358
How could you forget that name?

447
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,761
Everybody says you're a real punk.

448
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:41,929
Now you've been making
problems for me...

449
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,498
My family.

450
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:47,368
My family and my friends,
you make promises you can't keep.

451
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:49,703
Borrow money you can't repay.

452
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:54,542
Down here... You can't
get away with that shit.

453
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:58,846
Don't say anything just yet.

454
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:02,917
You can do all this bullshit
posturing in L.A. and New York,

455
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:04,619
but you can't do it down here.

456
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,920
Not in my city.

457
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:10,458
You think that's gonna
impress anybody?

458
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:13,928
Donny... nothing is more important

459
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:15,863
than your name.

460
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:17,965
And you've been using mine.

461
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:19,600
You cheated me...
you went behind my back

462
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:22,836
and took something that
didn't belong to you, Donny.

463
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:27,408
I'm not gonna forgive you.

464
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:30,545
Only God forgives.

465
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:32,080
Bye-bye, Donny.

466
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:33,813
Uhh!

467
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:55,903
It's definitely him.

468
00:37:55,904 --> 00:37:58,473
It's been 20 years since
he's been seen in the city.

469
00:37:58,474 --> 00:37:59,974
How can you be so sure?

470
00:37:59,975 --> 00:38:03,444
O'Reilly took special interest as
soon as he walked in the door.

471
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:05,446
You bring him to me.

472
00:38:05,447 --> 00:38:07,148
Now, do you understand?

473
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:09,817
We're tailing him now.

474
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:14,455
Boss, I know you don't
want to hear this,

475
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:18,124
but you pay me a lot of money
to give you honest counsel.

476
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:21,129
Let this one go.

477
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,897
Let what go?

478
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:24,932
What are you talking about?

479
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:27,835
Think I can let it go?

480
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:30,071
You get some people... now.

481
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:32,906
The best people you can get.

482
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:37,811
If The Prince is here...
Bring him to me.

483
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:51,692
Get up as close to him as you can.

484
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:54,462
So, Beth's dad...

485
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:55,963
Where are we going?

486
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:57,165
I'm taking you home.

487
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,467
You're gonna go to
the train station...

488
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:01,736
- I don't...
- ...'Cause that's best for everybody.

489
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:03,504
I don't want to go.

490
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:09,177
I am not going.

491
00:39:16,017 --> 00:39:17,335
Pull over!

492
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:25,092
Down!

493
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,381
You're okay.

494
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,650
Stay down.

495
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:42,235
Uhh!

496
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:05,593
Stay in the car.

497
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:18,940
Who you working for?

498
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:19,941
Fuck you.

499
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:23,110
Who you working for?

500
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:24,679
Who fuckin' sent you?

501
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:27,148
- Open up, open up!
- No. No.

502
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:28,816
There you go.

503
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:31,652
Who... sent you?

504
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:34,322
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' eyes
out right now. Who sent you?

505
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:36,589
Omar.

506
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:39,726
Omar.

507
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:44,999
Well, you tell fuckin' Omar
that I'm passing through,

508
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,602
and he better fuckin'
let me pass through.

509
00:41:47,603 --> 00:41:49,068
You remember that?

510
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:30,645
Wilson's dead.

511
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:35,182
Joe's in the hospital, but it doesn't
look like he's gonna make it.

512
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:38,019
I told you to put your
best people on it.

513
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,857
We can do that, but we
don't have much to go on.

514
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:45,793
The guys at the bar aren't talking.

515
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:48,796
He's here looking
for a girl, an addict.

516
00:42:48,797 --> 00:42:51,766
That's all we know.

517
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:54,233
I don't care what it takes.

518
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:58,171
I feel like I would be remiss...

519
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:03,076
If I did not reiterate my position.

520
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:07,213
Your position?

521
00:43:08,683 --> 00:43:10,418
People that have limbs
that are amputated

522
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:15,254
still feel the pain in that limb,
even though it's not there.

523
00:43:18,793 --> 00:43:21,160
That's the pain that I feel.

524
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:24,630
Every time I look, I mean...

525
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:30,137
I see his face.

526
00:43:30,138 --> 00:43:35,374
I feel that pain, and I see
him looking back at me.

527
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:41,148
We have a chance to get him.

528
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:43,350
Right now.

529
00:43:43,351 --> 00:43:45,885
Let's go get him.

530
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:54,161
Just take a breath.

531
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:56,030
You're gonna be okay.

532
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,965
How the fuck am I
supposed to be okay?

533
00:43:57,966 --> 00:43:59,767
I just...

534
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:02,568
Just watched you kill someone.

535
00:44:03,971 --> 00:44:05,973
One second, I'm at a college party.

536
00:44:05,974 --> 00:44:09,744
The next second, I'm in New
Orleans, getting shot at.

537
00:44:09,745 --> 00:44:11,879
I need some answers!

538
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,048
Why are they after you? Why?

539
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:15,483
- What do you want?
- Who are they?

540
00:44:15,484 --> 00:44:16,917
What do you have in here?
What do you want?

541
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:18,252
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything!

542
00:44:18,253 --> 00:44:20,103
You want some pills?
You want some pot?

543
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:22,065
- Want some booze?
- No, I want the truth!

544
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:24,825
- Want some pot? What do you want?
- Look at me! Look at me!

545
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:26,427
You owe this to me!

546
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:30,164
- Will you be quiet?
- No, I want the truth.

547
00:44:30,165 --> 00:44:34,535
Why are there a bunch of men after
a fucking mechanic from Mississippi?

548
00:44:34,536 --> 00:44:37,505
What do they want with you?

549
00:44:37,506 --> 00:44:39,907
Who are you?

550
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:42,341
I'm not a mechanic from Mississippi.

551
00:44:43,778 --> 00:44:45,980
I was born two blocks from here.

552
00:44:45,981 --> 00:44:50,550
You can see the shitty little
smokestack and the tenement.

553
00:44:52,887 --> 00:44:57,091
I wasn't a mechanic, I was just a
piece of shit running the streets.

554
00:44:57,092 --> 00:45:00,146
And I got in a situation where I could
go to jail or I can go to the military,

555
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:03,097
so, obviously, I took the military.

556
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:06,899
After months, lots and
lots of enemies here.

557
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:11,505
And I was good.

558
00:45:11,506 --> 00:45:13,374
Why are they after us now?

559
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,042
Because I went and I came back,

560
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:18,813
and you come back to what?
I come back to this.

561
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:21,448
And so I had one
opportunity, I thought,

562
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:23,450
that would get me out,
and of course I took it.

563
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,319
And, of course, I took
the next one after that,

564
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,589
and the next one and the next one,
and I was what I always was,

565
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,324
which is nothing and a liar.

566
00:45:31,892 --> 00:45:34,595
What do they want with you?

567
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:37,730
I did something 20
years ago for these...

568
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:41,367
For what? What?

569
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:44,470
What?

570
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:51,378
He was, uh, trying to
take over the city,

571
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:54,248
and it didn't matter
who he eliminated.

572
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:57,585
And there were lots. Lots.

573
00:45:57,586 --> 00:46:02,957
The violence got to a point where,
uh, he needed to be stopped.

574
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,259
At the end of the day,
you know who's gonna be here?

575
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,895
- He needed to be stopped.
- You, Daddy.

576
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:10,130
I love you. Are you okay?

577
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:12,132
Mm, yeah, kind of.

578
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:13,400
I miss you.

579
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:14,635
Come here.

580
00:46:14,636 --> 00:46:17,471
Mm... daddy's girl.

581
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:18,606
Mmm...

582
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:20,074
Come here.

583
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:21,242
Go run over to mommy, yeah?

584
00:46:21,243 --> 00:46:23,077
- Okay.
- Oh, hey!

585
00:46:23,078 --> 00:46:24,945
Look what I have.

586
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:26,580
What do you have?

587
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:29,884
This is a present for you on the
first day of school, puppy.

588
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:31,952
- Thank you.
- Don't open it till you get to class.

589
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:33,320
Ohh.

590
00:46:33,321 --> 00:46:35,422
Come on, silly,
we don't want to be late.

591
00:46:35,423 --> 00:46:37,157
- Oh, she won't be late.
- Bye, Daddy.

592
00:46:37,158 --> 00:46:39,894
Bye, baby.

593
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:41,662
Oh, I'm taking your car, okay?

594
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,132
All right. All right.

595
00:46:45,133 --> 00:46:47,468
Rachel, wait, wait, wait, wait.

596
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:50,437
I wanna get a picture of you guys.

597
00:46:50,438 --> 00:46:52,507
Cheese!

598
00:46:52,908 --> 00:46:53,974
I love you.

599
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:57,543
I love you. Bye, honey.
Have fun at school.

600
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:01,181
Here you go.

601
00:47:01,182 --> 00:47:03,617
And I tried to stop it,
but it was too late.

602
00:47:03,618 --> 00:47:05,552
It was too late to...

603
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:08,622
it was too late for me.
It was too late for her.

604
00:47:37,351 --> 00:47:42,189
And I'll never forget
the look in her eyes.

605
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,192
Not that I deserve pity for that.

606
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:46,694
'Cause I don't.

607
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,730
It's just a fact.

608
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:53,566
So it drove me out of here,
and I left everything.

609
00:47:56,704 --> 00:47:59,740
And woke up somewhere.
I don't know where.

610
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:02,710
Fucking in a bottle.

611
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:06,747
And that's where Anna Marie
came in and lifted me up.

612
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:09,382
Stupidly loved me...

613
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:13,519
And 12-stepped me to the altar.

614
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:17,424
And Beth was an accident.

615
00:48:17,425 --> 00:48:18,759
A happy accident.

616
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,760
A blessed accident.

617
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:21,228
But I can't have it.

618
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:22,696
What am I gonna do with a child?

619
00:48:22,697 --> 00:48:25,464
I can nurture a child with my tools?

620
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:36,777
They're gonna kill Beth if
I don't get to her first.

621
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:38,779
What?

622
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,514
They're gonna try to kill me,
and they'll kill you.

623
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:46,587
So I need you to listen to me
and I need you to trust me.

624
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,223
You don't have to like me.

625
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:50,758
You understand?

626
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:52,292
Mm-hmm.

627
00:48:52,293 --> 00:48:55,561
And I will get you out of here.

628
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:05,139
I really appreciate that.

629
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,573
Thank you.

630
00:49:09,076 --> 00:49:11,045
Where are we going?

631
00:49:11,046 --> 00:49:12,179
I'm gonna drop you off with a friend,

632
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,480
somewhere you're gonna
be safe for a while.

633
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:15,749
I'll get you when I get Beth back.

634
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,185
Okay, you're leaving
me where, exactly?

635
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:19,820
I'll bring you back when I get Beth.

636
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:22,790
It's someone I trust.

637
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,624
Wait a minute. What are you doing?

638
00:49:26,794 --> 00:49:29,463
Oh, we're stealing a car?

639
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:13,672
I'm here for Sam.

640
00:50:15,342 --> 00:50:17,543
They're on the way up.

641
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:29,223
Jesus Christ.

642
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:33,626
Wow.

643
00:50:35,863 --> 00:50:38,298
Good to see you.

644
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:39,433
Come on in.

645
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:40,734
How you been?

646
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,303
I don't know.

647
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:46,173
Hmm... hmm.

648
00:50:46,174 --> 00:50:47,708
Wow.

649
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:50,711
This is impressive.

650
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:52,579
Yeah.

651
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,580
Really.

652
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:58,551
What do you want, Paul?

653
00:51:00,354 --> 00:51:02,156
I gotta get my daughter.

654
00:51:02,157 --> 00:51:04,458
- Your what?
- My daughter.

655
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:06,627
She's gone,
I've come here to get her.

656
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:09,263
She's fallen into some bad stuff.

657
00:51:09,264 --> 00:51:10,898
Fallen into what?

658
00:51:10,899 --> 00:51:13,267
Some guy named "The Pharmacy."

659
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:14,368
Oh, fuck.

660
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:16,770
- You know him?
- Yeah.

661
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:19,138
He's a lunatic.

662
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,276
Can you help me?

663
00:51:22,277 --> 00:51:23,777
Can't do that.

664
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:26,413
I don't do that stuff anymore, Paul.

665
00:51:26,414 --> 00:51:28,916
Nothing personal.

666
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:31,652
You don't have to leave this room.

667
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:32,920
I will take care of him.

668
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:35,489
I will take care of him.

669
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,191
What are you asking me to do?

670
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:40,961
I just want some time, a safe
place for Angela to stay here,

671
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:43,297
give me some time to get Beth,

672
00:51:43,298 --> 00:51:45,199
and then I need a safe
ride out of here.

673
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,632
Clean.

674
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:50,537
- Beth's your daughter?
- Yes.

675
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:53,273
- That's Angela?
- That's right.

676
00:51:53,274 --> 00:51:55,509
Nobody gets hurt?

677
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,211
Clean.

678
00:51:57,212 --> 00:51:59,378
Shit.

679
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:01,680
Jesus.

680
00:52:06,621 --> 00:52:11,258
You know what'll happen if the word
gets out that I'm with you again?

681
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:12,726
Right? You know.

682
00:52:12,727 --> 00:52:15,027
I do, yeah. I do.

683
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,466
So if I do this thing,
I'm not gonna see you...

684
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:21,768
Around town anymore, right?

685
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:23,770
You're not gonna come back?

686
00:52:23,771 --> 00:52:27,272
You're not gonna see me
anywhere, ever again, friend.

687
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:31,478
How's your shoulder?

688
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:32,779
I'm a righty now.

689
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,748
Crazy motherfucker.

690
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:40,653
Be careful out there.

691
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:43,957
A lot of the old faces you knew...

692
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,826
Can't trust them anymore.

693
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:47,427
I never did, Sam.

694
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:53,332
We'll wait here, then.

695
00:53:02,276 --> 00:53:04,043
Come in.

696
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:11,250
- Hi.
- Come on in.

697
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:14,021
You want something to drink?

698
00:53:14,022 --> 00:53:15,389
You want something to eat?

699
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,956
Uh, a drink's great, yeah.

700
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:22,896
What do you want?
You... we got everything.

701
00:53:22,897 --> 00:53:24,464
Do you have whisky?

702
00:53:24,465 --> 00:53:26,732
I'll get you whisky.

703
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:30,036
That your boyfriend?

704
00:53:30,705 --> 00:53:32,406
No.

705
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:35,409
He's my friend's dad.

706
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:38,412
So are you gonna send
anyone to help him?

707
00:53:38,413 --> 00:53:41,848
No. I'm not gonna send anybody.

708
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:44,883
- Thank you.
- He doesn't need any help.

709
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:48,789
You really don't know who he is, huh?

710
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,557
Not really.

711
00:53:50,558 --> 00:53:52,459
You know where South Garriston is?

712
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,027
- No.
- No?

713
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:55,762
Garriston Street.

714
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:58,031
Old timers called it Hadrian's Wall.

715
00:53:58,032 --> 00:53:59,700
Oh, I don't know what that is.

716
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:02,801
When Rome was at the
peak of its powers...

717
00:54:03,103 --> 00:54:06,340
You know, it ran most
of the world, right?

718
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:10,410
Ran everything, except in Scotland.

719
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:13,780
There was this... tribe.

720
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:16,215
They were so fuckin' crazy...

721
00:54:17,517 --> 00:54:20,754
That, even at the peak of its powers,

722
00:54:20,755 --> 00:54:24,123
it just wasn't worth it for
the Romans to go in there.

723
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:30,464
So this emperor, Hadrian,
built a wall across Scotland.

724
00:54:30,465 --> 00:54:33,433
And he just walled 'em up.

725
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:37,404
Gave 'em a... kingdom for themselves.

726
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:40,806
South Garriston was Paul's territory.

727
00:54:41,908 --> 00:54:45,410
His own little kingdom, where he could
do whatever the fuck he wanted.

728
00:54:46,446 --> 00:54:48,482
And nobody ever dared go in there.

729
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:51,718
You wouldn't even know his name.

730
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:53,620
Just called him "The Prince."

731
00:54:53,621 --> 00:54:56,288
"The Prince"?

732
00:54:59,393 --> 00:55:02,961
You better get away from him.

733
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:35,529
How may I help you?

734
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,197
Looking for Big Mike.

735
00:55:37,198 --> 00:55:39,499
Um, uh...

736
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,535
My Daddy passed a couple years back.

737
00:55:41,536 --> 00:55:44,638
How can I be of service to you?

738
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,073
My condolences.

739
00:55:47,074 --> 00:55:48,875
Sorry to hear about your old man.

740
00:55:48,876 --> 00:55:51,611
However, I left something
here a while back

741
00:55:51,612 --> 00:55:53,547
and I need to pick it up now.

742
00:55:53,548 --> 00:55:54,815
Oh, yeah.

743
00:55:54,816 --> 00:55:56,216
Let's see.

744
00:55:56,217 --> 00:55:58,718
I don't give a shit how
fast you think you are.

745
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,588
At this range... I ain't gonna miss.

746
00:56:08,528 --> 00:56:11,097
You better be sure about that.

747
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:14,534
Now, before my daddy passed...

748
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:16,503
He told me three things:

749
00:56:16,504 --> 00:56:19,239
Never put 10 pounds of
shit in a five-pound bag,

750
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,908
never take credit when
they got cash in hand,

751
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:24,177
and if a man walks through that door

752
00:56:24,178 --> 00:56:27,247
with tattoos like you've
got on your hand,

753
00:56:27,248 --> 00:56:30,183
"son, you better be ready to draw.

754
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:33,053
'Cause that man...

755
00:56:33,054 --> 00:56:35,922
that man brings hell with
him wherever he goes."

756
00:56:35,923 --> 00:56:39,893
Big Mike helped me escape
this city 20 years ago.

757
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:43,029
Gave me a new name, a new identity.

758
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,664
I left him something.

759
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:46,533
We had an agreement.

760
00:56:46,534 --> 00:56:48,235
I'm here to pick that up.

761
00:56:48,236 --> 00:56:51,970
I am going to pick that up.

762
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,108
He was my friend.

763
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:57,110
Is that so?

764
00:56:57,111 --> 00:57:02,214
Jameson, one ice cube,
one maraschino cherry.

765
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:06,753
My daddy did have a sweet tooth.

766
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:12,592
Uh, sorry about this, but you can
never be too safe around here.

767
00:57:12,593 --> 00:57:16,028
What you're lookin' for,
it's in the back.

768
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:22,936
This is what you're looking for, huh?

769
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:25,539
Looks like the flood
got a hold of this.

770
00:57:27,174 --> 00:57:29,242
Oh, boy.

771
00:57:29,243 --> 00:57:32,078
I could, uh, I could
clean 'em up for you.

772
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,548
Put some oil on 'em.

773
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:36,550
I don't think the coil
broke on any of 'em.

774
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:38,318
Probably take me a couple days.

775
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,087
I don't have time.

776
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,992
My daddy didn't have many friends.

777
00:57:47,761 --> 00:57:49,995
So...

778
00:57:52,832 --> 00:57:55,335
You can choose one of these.

779
00:57:55,336 --> 00:57:58,305
Consider it a gift from Big Mike.

780
00:57:58,306 --> 00:58:01,908
Only untraceable weapons this
side of communist California.

781
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:05,111
I'm gonna need
Mercury-tipped bullets.

782
00:58:05,112 --> 00:58:08,815
I got black talons,
plus Ps, hollow points.

783
00:58:08,816 --> 00:58:10,150
How many you gonna need?

784
00:58:12,852 --> 00:58:14,788
How many you got?

785
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,184
What's up?

786
00:58:47,887 --> 00:58:49,723
What are you doing? Huh?

787
00:58:49,724 --> 00:58:51,925
I'm here to see Tony.

788
00:58:51,926 --> 00:58:54,361
Oh, you must have your
addresses mixed up,

789
00:58:54,362 --> 00:58:56,196
because there ain't no Tony here.

790
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:57,731
Look, don't waste my fuckin' time.

791
00:58:57,732 --> 00:59:00,100
Tony's your boss, The Pharmacy.
I got some information for him.

792
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:04,169
- You got an appointment?
- No. But he does.

793
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:06,206
What's that supposed to mean?

794
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:08,675
Means if I'm not speaking to
him in the next two minutes,

795
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:10,677
he's gonna find himself dead...

796
00:59:10,678 --> 00:59:13,412
And we'll throw you in with the deal.

797
00:59:15,649 --> 00:59:17,651
You'll take that, shy hero?

798
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:20,253
Okay, handsome. Get those arms up.

799
00:59:20,254 --> 00:59:21,888
Get 'em up, get 'em up. Hmm?

800
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:24,057
What's this? What do
you got here, hmm?

801
00:59:24,058 --> 00:59:26,159
What does it look like?
Tough neighborhood.

802
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,128
Bet your ass it is, old man.

803
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:29,763
You can it back on the way out.

804
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:31,264
Yeah, I will.

805
00:59:31,265 --> 00:59:34,232
Get your ass in there.

806
00:59:46,246 --> 00:59:49,749
Yeah. Yeah, I'm bringing him now.

807
01:00:03,763 --> 01:00:05,097
Come on!

808
01:00:13,741 --> 01:00:16,475
What's wrong with you, man?

809
01:00:29,956 --> 01:00:31,191
This the guy?

810
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:32,759
That's him.

811
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,060
Take a seat.

812
01:00:34,061 --> 01:00:37,464
No. I won't be staying long.

813
01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:40,033
Whatever makes you feel happy, pop.

814
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:41,835
Jimmy tells me you got
some information for me.

815
01:00:41,836 --> 01:00:45,939
Some sort of tip...
That's gonna save my life.

816
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,440
Matter of fact, I do.

817
01:00:47,441 --> 01:00:49,018
Lay it on me.

818
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:51,144
It's about the girl that
you've been living with.

819
01:00:51,145 --> 01:00:54,481
- I live with a lot of girls.
- Well, that's good.

820
01:00:54,482 --> 01:00:57,183
Then you won't miss her when
I take her out of here.

821
01:00:57,184 --> 01:00:59,352
Her name is Beth,

822
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:02,821
Beth Brennan, my daughter.

823
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:07,259
And she's leaving with me tonight.

824
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:09,829
Why are we talking
about bitches, anyway?

825
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,898
I thought this was a
life-and-death situation.

826
01:01:11,899 --> 01:01:15,335
It is... for you...

827
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:17,669
If you don't let me take
her out of here now.

828
01:01:19,205 --> 01:01:21,274
You got this all fucked up, pops.

829
01:01:21,275 --> 01:01:23,409
All wrong.

830
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,347
You see... this ain't no prison cell.

831
01:01:27,348 --> 01:01:30,248
Especially your little girl.

832
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:39,624
I mean, she wanted to be here so
bad, she actually begged me to stay.

833
01:01:40,794 --> 01:01:43,261
Shit, you can look for yourself.

834
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:51,905
She's still doing a
little recuperating.

835
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:01,848
You know, I ain't did nothing to
her that she didn't ask me to do.

836
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:03,550
You know how these
kids are these days.

837
01:02:03,551 --> 01:02:06,419
They get a little taste
of partying and drugs,

838
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,088
and they just want more
and more and more.

839
01:02:09,089 --> 01:02:11,925
Gotta have it.

840
01:02:11,926 --> 01:02:16,328
I'm just... a motherfucker
willing to oblige.

841
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:20,099
Well...

842
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,101
You best be the
motherfucker that obliges

843
01:02:22,102 --> 01:02:24,437
by keeping your ass
on that fuckin' couch

844
01:02:24,438 --> 01:02:26,406
while I walk out of here
with her right now,

845
01:02:26,407 --> 01:02:29,209
'cause you won't be
breathing, otherwise.

846
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:32,245
Okay, that... that...
that's not possible.

847
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:36,015
You see, I got a call from my man.

848
01:02:36,016 --> 01:02:37,617
Omar.

849
01:02:37,618 --> 01:02:39,285
Yeah, that's right.

850
01:02:39,286 --> 01:02:41,454
He told me you'd show up.

851
01:02:41,455 --> 01:02:44,591
Said to keep you here
on ice till he gets here.

852
01:02:44,592 --> 01:02:46,326
And the girl.

853
01:02:46,327 --> 01:02:50,428
Because he got something special
planned for your baby girl.

854
01:03:15,355 --> 01:03:18,958
Close your eyes, baby.
There we go. Hold on.

855
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:19,959
Keep your eyes closed.

856
01:03:25,164 --> 01:03:27,267
Don't open your eyes.

857
01:03:27,268 --> 01:03:29,301
Don't open your eyes.

858
01:04:02,302 --> 01:04:03,703
No, no, we didn't do anything!

859
01:04:03,704 --> 01:04:06,338
I swear, I swear!

860
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:38,765
We told you to keep them on ice.

861
01:05:38,766 --> 01:05:41,267
Where are they?

862
01:05:46,305 --> 01:05:49,342
They're gone.

863
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:51,611
They're gone.

864
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:16,269
Look at that.

865
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,837
You got the 12-year.

866
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:19,105
Yeah.

867
01:06:19,106 --> 01:06:21,407
A celebration here.

868
01:06:21,408 --> 01:06:22,775
You ready?

869
01:06:22,776 --> 01:06:25,411
Yeah, hold on.

870
01:06:25,412 --> 01:06:29,147
You don't want to waste the
good stuff on a bad shot.

871
01:06:42,096 --> 01:06:45,698
How long till you can
get us out of here?

872
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:47,200
I'm working on it.

873
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,202
How soon?

874
01:06:49,203 --> 01:06:50,835
I'll handle it.

875
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,639
Don't worry.

876
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,907
Okay.

877
01:06:57,176 --> 01:06:58,177
Is word out yet?

878
01:06:58,178 --> 01:07:01,079
Everybody knows you're back.

879
01:07:01,848 --> 01:07:03,948
I knew that'd happen.

880
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:07,685
Glad it worked out.

881
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:16,362
We've got him.

882
01:07:16,363 --> 01:07:20,081
A man with a bullet wound showed
up this morning at the battle house.

883
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:23,693
He had a girl with him who
looked pretty strung out.

884
01:07:25,738 --> 01:07:28,840
Makes sense they would go
to Sam's for sanctuary.

885
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,844
Let everybody know.

886
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:34,546
Do not cross my line.

887
01:07:43,923 --> 01:07:44,924
Hey.

888
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:47,325
Hi.

889
01:07:48,794 --> 01:07:50,728
You look pretty.

890
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,899
You look like shit.

891
01:07:54,902 --> 01:07:57,569
How are you feeling?

892
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,410
She threw up again,
so she should be feeling better.

893
01:08:04,411 --> 01:08:05,845
It's gonna get worse.

894
01:08:05,846 --> 01:08:07,613
Okay, well, I'm gonna go get a soda.

895
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:09,649
- Do you want anything?
- No.

896
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:12,385
But I need you to get
her ready to travel.

897
01:08:12,386 --> 01:08:14,320
We have to leave. Okay?

898
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:15,955
Yeah, okay.

899
01:08:15,956 --> 01:08:18,189
Yeah.

900
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,636
Hey, you.

901
01:08:30,237 --> 01:08:32,972
I'm all right. I'm all right.

902
01:08:32,973 --> 01:08:35,173
I know you are.

903
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:39,312
Just gonna get you home, okay?

904
01:08:39,313 --> 01:08:42,481
I... I don't think I can go.

905
01:08:42,482 --> 01:08:44,617
Of course you can.

906
01:08:44,618 --> 01:08:47,253
Everything's changed.

907
01:08:47,254 --> 01:08:49,253
Not with me, it hasn't.

908
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:53,958
You're the only reason
I keep going, Beth.

909
01:08:54,594 --> 01:08:58,229
I don't know what home is anymore.

910
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:01,767
We'll find it.

911
01:09:01,768 --> 01:09:04,335
We'll find it.

912
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:53,084
Switch them around. Just you with me.

913
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:17,710
I'll see you soon, okay?

914
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:19,412
Mm-hmm.

915
01:10:19,413 --> 01:10:22,013
- Okay.
- Say good night.

916
01:10:23,049 --> 01:10:26,052
I really wish you guys
were coming with me.

917
01:10:26,053 --> 01:10:27,887
I can't protect you both.

918
01:10:27,888 --> 01:10:30,121
I understand.

919
01:10:32,425 --> 01:10:35,594
Well, will you call me
when you get home safely?

920
01:10:35,595 --> 01:10:37,363
Yeah.

921
01:10:37,364 --> 01:10:39,598
Don't be too hard on her.

922
01:10:39,599 --> 01:10:40,599
I won't.

923
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,734
Come on, guys.

924
01:10:41,735 --> 01:10:44,135
Wait on the corner for the tail.

925
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,218
That's high cotton, blood.

926
01:11:08,461 --> 01:11:11,063
Jesus Christ.

927
01:11:11,064 --> 01:11:14,133
My heart's pounding.

928
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:20,072
That Montecristo's
not helping, is it?

929
01:11:20,073 --> 01:11:22,141
No.

930
01:11:22,142 --> 01:11:24,143
It's the adrenaline.

931
01:11:24,144 --> 01:11:25,644
Yeah.

932
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:27,813
It's the only thing I miss.

933
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:39,725
Nobody makes it through.

934
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:41,827
Copy that.

935
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:47,166
Remember that third street tavern?

936
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:50,234
Remember that fuckin' clusterfuck?

937
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:54,507
You got your shoulder all shot up.

938
01:11:54,508 --> 01:11:57,108
Jesus Christ, were we shit-faced.

939
01:11:58,411 --> 01:12:00,713
I don't know how we stumbled
out of there and lived.

940
01:12:00,714 --> 01:12:03,015
Do you think it was money, Sam?

941
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:05,017
Is that what it was all about?

942
01:12:05,018 --> 01:12:07,620
That's what we thought, right?

943
01:12:15,861 --> 01:12:16,962
Move in.

944
01:12:16,963 --> 01:12:18,896
Copy.

945
01:12:29,976 --> 01:12:31,843
Get her out of here, come on!

946
01:12:47,661 --> 01:12:51,128
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

947
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:08,079
Uhh!

948
01:14:30,296 --> 01:14:32,631
"Nobody gets hurt."

949
01:14:32,632 --> 01:14:33,766
You motherfucker.

950
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:42,239
Get in.

951
01:14:44,643 --> 01:14:47,046
Just keep 'em off as long as you can.

952
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:50,015
Keep 'em off.

953
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,035
I got a daughter of my own.

954
01:15:10,036 --> 01:15:12,269
Whatever you need...

955
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:15,106
It's yours.

956
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:24,782
All right.

957
01:15:52,712 --> 01:15:56,113
Close the door on your way out.

958
01:15:58,017 --> 01:15:59,885
Please, I just...

959
01:15:59,886 --> 01:16:02,755
I just wanna go home.

960
01:16:02,756 --> 01:16:04,123
Where's home?

961
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:06,759
Ponto... Pontotoc.

962
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,927
- What?
- Pontotoc.

963
01:16:08,928 --> 01:16:10,062
What's Pontotoc?

964
01:16:10,063 --> 01:16:13,666
Pontotoc, Mississippi.

965
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,401
I used to work with your father.

966
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:17,169
We knew each other.

967
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,937
What?

968
01:16:18,938 --> 01:16:21,440
He took everything from me.

969
01:16:21,441 --> 01:16:24,241
Your father did.

970
01:16:25,444 --> 01:16:27,078
Everything.

971
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:32,183
But you and I can ask him why...

972
01:16:32,785 --> 01:16:37,121
When he comes here... to see you.

973
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:41,427
And you and I are just gonna sit here
and wait for him till he gets here.

974
01:16:42,428 --> 01:16:44,697
Why?

975
01:16:44,698 --> 01:16:48,232
Baby... stop the scratching.

976
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:51,804
I don't know what
you're talking about.

977
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:54,438
Please just let me go home.

978
01:17:00,113 --> 01:17:01,847
Listen to me... when we get there,

979
01:17:01,848 --> 01:17:04,750
it'll be 11 minutes before
a response team shows up.

980
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:07,119
So if we're not out that door
by then, you have to go.

981
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,954
You get in your car and you
drive and you don't look back.

982
01:17:08,955 --> 01:17:11,056
- You don't come back.
- Okay.

983
01:17:11,057 --> 01:17:12,391
Do you understand?

984
01:17:12,392 --> 01:17:14,760
Yeah.

985
01:17:14,761 --> 01:17:18,097
Is that okay?

986
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:20,865
Yep.

987
01:19:07,105 --> 01:19:08,839
He's here.

988
01:19:12,477 --> 01:19:14,546
Hey. Hey.

989
01:19:14,547 --> 01:19:16,849
Let's go, come on. Come on, get up.

990
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:18,749
We gotta go.

991
01:21:09,695 --> 01:21:11,595
Paul!

992
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:16,201
Say, "Hi, Daddy.
I'm a little scared."

993
01:21:16,202 --> 01:21:18,270
Daddy. Daddy.

994
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:20,038
- Louder.
- Daddy.

995
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:21,707
"Daddy"!

996
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:23,108
- Yeah.
- Daddy!

997
01:21:23,109 --> 01:21:24,609
That's right! "Daddy"!

998
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:26,044
Is this what you want?

999
01:21:26,045 --> 01:21:28,447
- No!
- Is this enough?!

1000
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:31,548
Let her go and I'll
let you walk away.

1001
01:21:32,317 --> 01:21:33,719
You'll never see me again.

1002
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,688
That's enough anymore!

1003
01:21:36,689 --> 01:21:39,191
You want me? You take me.

1004
01:21:39,192 --> 01:21:42,995
I want you to know
what it's like to lose

1005
01:21:42,996 --> 01:21:46,098
the only thing that you
ever loved in your life.

1006
01:21:46,099 --> 01:21:47,766
You ready?

1007
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:53,238
You chose this life, we chose
this life, and that's the cost.

1008
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:56,608
What about my wife and child?!

1009
01:21:56,609 --> 01:21:59,011
What did they have to do with it?

1010
01:21:59,012 --> 01:22:00,112
What?!

1011
01:22:00,113 --> 01:22:01,313
Please don't!

1012
01:22:01,314 --> 01:22:03,148
Collateral damage. It was a war.

1013
01:22:03,149 --> 01:22:04,750
And you...

1014
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:07,486
Are gonna lose the only thing

1015
01:22:07,487 --> 01:22:10,622
that you ever loved in your life.

1016
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:12,290
Say bye.

1017
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:13,358
Tell him you love him.

1018
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:14,426
Tell him you love him.

1019
01:22:14,427 --> 01:22:16,361
- No, don't...
- Tell him!

1020
01:22:16,362 --> 01:22:18,330
- Please don't!
- Say it!

1021
01:22:18,331 --> 01:22:20,565
Say, "I love you, Daddy"!

1022
01:22:23,036 --> 01:22:24,803
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

1023
01:22:24,804 --> 01:22:27,771
No... please...

1024
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:56,567
Having a good time. Good time.

1025
01:23:02,174 --> 01:23:03,175
Mm-hmm.

1026
01:23:37,575 --> 01:23:40,210
Shh, shh, shh. Quiet now.

1027
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:05,403
See him? See him?

1028
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:07,639
Come on, come on, come on.

1029
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,207
All right, all right, all right.

1030
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:10,609
Good girl. Good girl.

1031
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:12,844
You're very brave. Very brave.

1032
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:15,212
See him?

1033
01:24:20,418 --> 01:24:22,888
There he is. Daddy.

1034
01:24:22,889 --> 01:24:26,224
Hi, Daddy. Say hi.

1035
01:24:29,928 --> 01:24:31,363
One...

1036
01:24:31,364 --> 01:24:33,163
Two...

1037
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:39,770
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

1038
01:24:44,743 --> 01:24:46,910
Shoot now.

1039
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:51,582
Shoot now.

1040
01:25:48,306 --> 01:25:50,741
Let's go home.
