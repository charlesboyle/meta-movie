00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,405
Hello, stranger.

2
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:13,804
Sorry. Looking for a cigarette.

3
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,042
l've given up.

4
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,113
Thank you.

5
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,682
-Got to be somewhere?
-Work.

6
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:28,213
You didn't fancy my sandwiches?

7
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:30,953
-Don't eat fish.
-Why not?

8
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:33,523
Fish piss in the sea.

9
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,863
-So do children.
-Don't eat children, either.

10
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,658
What's your work?

11
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,897
l'm sort of a journalist.

12
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,071
-What sort?
-l write obituaries.

13
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,214
Are we in for a long wait?

14
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,451
She was 21 when she came in.

15
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,319
Does it hurt?

16
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:09,362
l'll live.

17
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,935
Do you want me to put your leg up?

18
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,561
Yes, please.

19
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:31,377
Who cut off your crusts?

20
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:32,810
Me.

21
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,824
Did your mother cut off your crusts
when you were a little boy?

22
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:39,259
-Yes, l believe she did.
-You should eat your crusts.

23
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,529
You should stop smoking.

24
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,556
How long was l out?

25
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:47,194
-About 10 seconds.
-Then what?

26
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,462
You came to. You focused on me.

27
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,236
You said, ''Hello, stranger.''

28
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:54,867
What a floozy.

29
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:58,778
The cabbie crossed himself, he went,
''Thank fuck. l thought l'd killed her.''

30
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:01,214
l said, ''Let's get her to a hospital.''
He hesitated.

31
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,583
l think he thought there'd be paperwork
and he'd be held responsible.

32
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:08,112
So l said with a slight sneer,
''Please just drop us at the hospital.''

33
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,783
Show me the sneer.

34
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,695
Very good, buster.

35
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:15,253
Thank you.

36
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,304
-l told you, l've given up.
-Try harder.

37
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:27,934
You live here?

38
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,539
Just arrived from New York.

39
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,181
Taking a vacation?

40
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,149
l'm on an expedition.

41
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,582
Where's your baggage?

42
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,451
-Where are you staying?
-l'm a waif.

43
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,584
A red bus.

44
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,664
Policeman or ''bobby.''
Observe the distinctive helmet.

45
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,828
Saint Paul's Cathedral.
Please note the famous dome.

46
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:59,739
-This is a truly magnificent tour.
-lt's the London tourists never get to see.

47
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:02,642
-What's this?
-l've no idea.

48
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,165
They're all people
who died saving the lives of others.

49
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,738
l've been here before.

50
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,183
Twenty years ago, we came here.

51
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,413
My mother's dead. My father and l came here
the afternoon she died.

52
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,857
She was a smoker.
She died in the hospital, actually.

53
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,660
-ls your father still alive?
-Hanging on.

54
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,397
He's in a home.

55
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:02,300
-You're late for work.
-You saying you want me to go?

56
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,272
l'm saying you're late for work.

57
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,534
How did you end up writing obituaries?

58
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,974
Well, l had dreams of being a writer,
but l had no voice.

59
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,981
What am l saying? l had no talent.

60
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:19,317
So l ended up in obituaries,
which is the Siberia of journalism.

61
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:23,253
Tell me what you do.
l want to imagine you in Siberia.

62
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,657
Really?

63
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:30,397
We call it ''the obits page.''

64
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:34,267
There's three of us: me, Graham, and Harry.

65
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:39,001
When l get to work, without fail....
Are you sure you want to know?

66
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:44,139
Well, if someone important died,
we go to the ''deep freeze''...

67
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:51,144
which is a computer file...

68
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,486
with all the obituaries,
and we find the dead person's life.

69
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,219
People's obituaries are written
while they're still alive?

70
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:58,885
Some people's.

71
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,522
Then Harry, he's the editor,
decides who we'll lead with.

72
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,794
Then we make calls, check facts.

73
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:09,429
At 6:00, we stand around the computer
and look at the next day's page...

74
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,538
and make final changes.

75
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,673
Add a few euphemisms
for our own amusement.

76
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,076
Such as?

77
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:23,547
''He was a convivial fellow.''
Meaning he was an alcoholic.

78
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,721
''He valued his privacy.'' Gay.

79
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,955
''He enjoyed his privacy.'' Raging queen.

80
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:34,220
What would my euphemism be?

81
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:38,190
-''She was disarming.''
-That's not a euphemism.

82
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,558
Yes, it is.

83
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,480
-What were you doing in New York?
-You know.

84
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,021
Well, no, l don't. What, were you studying?

85
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:01,486
Stripping.

86
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,189
Look at your little eyes.

87
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,161
l can't see my little eyes.

88
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:15,093
Why did you leave?

89
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:17,696
Problems with a male.

90
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,635
-Boyfriend?
-Kind of.

91
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,040
And you left him, just like that?

92
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:27,139
lt's the only way to leave.
''l don't love you anymore. Goodbye.''

93
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:30,413
-Supposing you do still love them?
-You don't leave.

94
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:34,417
-You've never left somebody you still love?
-No.

95
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,886
This is me.

96
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,963
Enjoy your stay.

97
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:52,468
Please remember
our traffic tends to come from the right.

98
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:55,335
Bye.

99
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,057
Do you have a girlfriend?

100
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:11,757
Yeah. Ruth.

101
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:15,297
She's called Ruth. She's a linguist.

102
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,860
-What's your name?
-Alice.

103
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,436
My name is Alice Ayres.

104
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:30,605
Good.

105
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,876
l'm just gonna change the film.
Are you okay for time?

106
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,682
-Do you mind if l smoke?
-lf you must.

107
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:44,383
-l don't have to.
-Then don't.

108
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,201
l liked your book.

109
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,268
Thanks.

110
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,079
-When's it published?
-Next year. How come you've read it?

111
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:08,379
Your publisher sent me a manuscript.
l read it last night.

112
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,919
You kept me up till 4:00.

113
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:13,216
l'm flattered.

114
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,057
ls your heroine
based on someone you know?

115
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:18,787
Yes. She's someone called Alice.

116
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,786
How does she feel
about you stealing her life?

117
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:23,331
Borrowing her life.

118
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:26,060
l'm dedicating the book to her.
She's pleased.

119
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:36,342
Do you exhibit?

120
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,313
Sometimes. l have a thing next year.

121
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:46,652
Portraits?

122
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:51,318
-Of who?
-Strangers.

123
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,789
How do your strangers feel
about you stealing their lives?

124
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,366
Borrowing.

125
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,302
Am l a stranger?

126
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,934
No. You're a job.

127
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:08,902
And you're a sloucher. Sit up.

128
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,018
You didn't find it obscene?

129
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,678
-What?
-The book.

130
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:22,149
l thought it was accurate.

131
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,259
About what?

132
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:26,859
About sex. About love.

133
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,629
ln what way?

134
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:32,295
-You wrote it.
-You read it till 4:00.

135
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,695
Don't raise your eyebrows.
lt makes you look smug.

136
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,278
-But you did like it?
-Yes, but l could go off it.

137
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:55,054
Stand up.

138
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,161
Any criticisms?

139
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,325
l'm not sure about the title.

140
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:07,960
Got a better one?

141
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:10,372
<i>The Aquarium.</i>

142
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,103
So you liked the filth.

143
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:16,172
-You like aquariums.
-Fish are therapeutic.

144
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,611
-Hang out in aquariums, do you?
-When l can.

145
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,512
Good for picking up strangers?

146
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,915
Photographing strangers.

147
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,893
Come here.

148
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,841
You're beautiful.

149
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,855
l don't kiss strange men.

150
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,749
Neither do l.

151
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:18,760
Do you and this Alice live together?

152
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:24,903
Yes.

153
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:37,851
Are you married?

154
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,251
Yes.

155
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:42,082
-No. Yes.
-Which?

156
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,086
Separated.

157
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:46,354
-Do you have any children?
-No.

158
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,421
-Would you like some?
-Yes, but not today.

159
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,498
Would Alice like children?

160
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,060
She's too young.

161
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:59,764
She works in a café near here.
She's coming to meet me.

162
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,942
Quite soon.

163
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,945
Why are you wasting her time?

164
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,917
-You're judgmental.
-You're devious.

165
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:14,683
l'm not wasting her time.
She's completely lovable.

166
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:16,588
And completely unleavable.

167
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:20,686
And you don't want someone else
getting their dirty hands on her.

168
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:22,821
-Men are crap.
-But all the same--

169
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,525
They're still crap.

170
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,462
Your muse.

171
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,831
-You've ruined my life.
-You'll get over it.

172
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,543
Dan.

173
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,151
Your shirt.

174
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,295
You all done?

175
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:02,463
-How's the photographer?
-Good. Professional.

176
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:05,838
Rigorous. Beady. One of your lot.

177
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,138
-What, female?
-<i>Americano.</i>

178
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:13,712
Come on.

179
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,520
Anna?

180
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:30,926
-Alice.
-Hi.

181
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,992
-Sorry to interrupt.
-No, we've just finished.

182
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,628
-Would you like some tea?
-No, thanks.

183
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,503
l've been serving it all day.
Can l use your loo?

184
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,509
Sure. Just through there.

185
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,381
She is beautiful.

186
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,511
-l've got to see you.
-No.

187
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,546
What's this? Patriotism?

188
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,454
-l don't want trouble.
-l'm not trouble.

189
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:57,924
You're taken.

190
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:01,791
-l've got to see you.
-Tough.

191
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:04,526
-You kissed me.
-What are you, 1 2?

192
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,201
l'm a block of ice.

193
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,339
Will you take my photo?

194
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:18,107
l've never been photographed
by a professional before.

195
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,774
l'd really appreciate it. l can pay you.

196
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,579
No, l'd like to.

197
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,849
Only if you don't mind.

198
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:26,648
Why should l?

199
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:28,713
Because you'll have to go away.

200
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,624
We don't want him here
while we're working, do we?

201
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:33,284
No, we don't.

202
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,493
Right. l'll be in the pub on the corner.

203
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:39,795
Have fun.

204
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,369
Thank you.

205
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,972
-Good luck with your exhibition.
-Good luck with your book.

206
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,687
So you've got an exhibition?

207
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:07,789
Yeah.

208
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,165
l read Dan's book.

209
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:18,069
You've had quite a life.

210
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:20,839
Thanks.

211
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,077
He said you work in a café?

212
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,049
l am a waitress.

213
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,116
That's a temporary thing?

214
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,078
No.

215
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:41,652
Why don't you come over here and sit?

216
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,983
-You live here?
-l do now.

217
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:04,048
Because you're single?

218
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,917
Who was your last boyfriend?

219
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:08,751
My husband.

220
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:10,416
Was he English?

221
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,454
-Very.
-What happened to him?

222
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,657
Someone younger.

223
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:21,868
You've got a great face.

224
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,766
Doesn't everyone?

225
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,631
l suppose so.

226
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,068
l just....

227
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,079
From the book,
somehow l thought you'd be less....

228
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:33,708
What?

229
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:38,880
l don't know what, exactly.

230
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,395
How do you feel about him using your life?

231
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,539
lt's really none of your business.

232
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:06,246
When he let me in downstairs...

233
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,810
he had this look.

234
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,654
l just listened to your conversation.

235
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:20,328
l don't know what to say.

236
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,997
l'm not a thief, Alice.

237
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,134
Do you want a drink?

238
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,700
l have some vodka in the fridge.
We could have a drink.

239
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,610
Just take my picture.

240
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:00,826
Good.

241
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:19,940
Anna?

242
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:25,778
l got the coat.

243
00:29:26,553 --> 00:29:28,111
The white coat.

244
00:29:30,257 --> 00:29:31,588
So l see.

245
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:34,991
l'm Larry. The doctor.

246
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:36,592
Hello, Dr. Larry.

247
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:39,598
Feel free to call me ''The Sultan.''

248
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:48,407
l can't believe
 these things actually happen.

249
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:51,243
l thought if you showed up,
you'd be an old trout.

250
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,212
But you are bloody gorgeous.

251
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:56,773
Well, thank you.

252
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,717
Fish. You gotta respect them.

253
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:04,887
-Have you?
-Of course.

254
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:08,085
We were fish. Long ago.

255
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:10,395
Before we were apes.

256
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,034
You mentioned a hotel.

257
00:30:16,536 --> 00:30:18,026
No rush.

258
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,138
Actually, there is.
l've got to be in surgery by 3:00.

259
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:27,472
-Are you having an operation?
-No, l'm doing one.

260
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:31,011
-Are you really a doctor?
-l said l was.

261
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,846
You are Anna?

262
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:39,614
l'm sorry. Did l photograph you?

263
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,587
Did we meet somewhere?

264
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:45,324
Come on. Don't play games,
you nymph of the Net.

265
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:48,290
-Excuse me?
-You were up for it yesterday.

266
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:51,667
-Was l?
-Yeah. ''Wear my wet knickers.

267
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,470
''Sit on my face.

268
00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:58,204
-''Cum-hungry bitch.''
-Okay.

269
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,875
Why do l feel like a pervert?

270
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:08,278
l think you're
 the victim of a practical joke.

271
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:14,686
-l am so sorry.
-lt's okay.

272
00:31:18,832 --> 00:31:19,992
No.

273
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:24,062
We spoke on the Net last night.
Now you've seen me--

274
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,468
l wasn't on the Net last night.

275
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:27,631
Where were you
between 6:45 and 7:00 p.m.?

276
00:31:27,707 --> 00:31:29,299
That's really none of your business.

277
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:32,345
-Where were you?
-On the Net, talking to you.

278
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:36,741
-Well, l was talking to someone.
-Someone pretending to be me.

279
00:31:40,286 --> 00:31:42,880
l think you were talking to Daniel Woolf.

280
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:46,016
-Who?
-This guy l know. lt's him.

281
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:48,526
-No, l was talking to a woman.
-How do you know?

282
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:51,257
Believe me, she was a woman.
l got a huge....

283
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:54,129
She was a.... She wasn't, was she?

284
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:55,661
No.

285
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:57,901
What a bastard.

286
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:05,072
How do you know him?

287
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:09,275
l don't really know him.
l took his photograph for a book he wrote.

288
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:12,147
-l hope it sank without a trace.
-lt's on its way.

289
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:14,413
There is justice in the world.

290
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:16,615
What's it called?

291
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:27,432
<i>The Aquarium.</i>

292
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,833
What a prick! He's advertising.

293
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:35,432
But why would he pretend to be you?

294
00:32:36,376 --> 00:32:37,866
l think he likes me.

295
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:40,605
Funny way of showing it.
Can't he send you flowers?

296
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,308
Extraordinary thing, the lnternet.

297
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:46,280
Possibility of genuine
global communication.

298
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:48,813
The first great democratic medium.

299
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:51,584
Absolutely. lt's the future.

300
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:54,323
Two guys wanking in cyberspace.

301
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:56,491
He was the wanker.

302
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:00,263
l'll say this for him, he can write.

303
00:33:01,868 --> 00:33:03,233
ls he in love with you?

304
00:33:03,303 --> 00:33:05,533
l don't know. No.

305
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:08,939
-Are you in love with him?
-l hardly know him.

306
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:11,169
But you're sort of interested.

307
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:13,643
l think he's interesting.

308
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:16,415
No, don't.
 l look like a criminal in photos.

309
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:18,383
Please. lt's my birthday.

310
00:33:18,618 --> 00:33:19,744
Really?

311
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:21,815
Really.

312
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:37,499
Happy birthday.

313
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:41,731
Thank you.

314
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:45,240
This man comes into the café today
and he says:

315
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:48,405
''Hey, waitress,
 what are you waiting for?''

316
00:33:48,882 --> 00:33:50,213
Funny guy.

317
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,142
So l go,
''l'm waiting for a man to come in here...

318
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:58,114
''and fuck me sideways
with a beautiful line like that.''

319
00:33:58,525 --> 00:34:00,015
What did he do?

320
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:02,653
Asked for a cup of tea with two sugars.

321
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:16,641
-l'm waiting for you.
-To do what?

322
00:34:18,845 --> 00:34:20,176
Leave me.

323
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:25,015
l'm not going to leave you.
l totally love you. Why is this?

324
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:29,213
Please let me come.
l want to be there for you.

325
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,756
-Are you ashamed of me?
-Of course not. l told you...

326
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:35,226
-l want to be alone.
-Why?

327
00:34:37,363 --> 00:34:38,887
To grieve.

328
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:41,156
To think.

329
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:46,899
-l love you. Why won't you let me?
-lt's only a weekend.

330
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:49,437
Why won't you let me love you?

331
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:54,343
Buster.

332
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:02,151
Let's go to this thing...

333
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:05,085
then l'll get my train.
 l'll be away one night.

334
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:08,087
l'll be back before you know it, okay?

335
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:40,121
Do these people pay you?
Or do you pay them?

336
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:07,750
Like it?

337
00:36:10,523 --> 00:36:11,854
No.

338
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,019
What were you so sad about?

339
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:19,329
-Life.
-What's that, then?

340
00:36:22,635 --> 00:36:25,536
So what do you reckon, in general?

341
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:27,702
You want to talk about art?

342
00:36:27,774 --> 00:36:31,175
l know it's vulgar to discuss The Work
at an opening of The Work...

343
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:33,371
but someone's got to do it.

344
00:36:35,381 --> 00:36:37,849
l'm serious. What do you think?

345
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:40,542
lt's a lie.

346
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,849
lt's a bunch of sad strangers
photographed beautifully...

347
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:49,659
and all the glittering assholes
who appreciate art...

348
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:53,455
say it's beautiful
because that's what they want to see.

349
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:56,024
But the people in the photos are sad...

350
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:58,268
and alone.

351
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:02,001
But the pictures
make the world seem beautiful...

352
00:37:02,075 --> 00:37:06,478
so the exhibition's reassuring,
which makes it a lie.

353
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:09,675
And everyone loves a big, fat lie.

354
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:13,677
-l'm the big, fat liar's boyfriend.
-Bastard.

355
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:15,721
-Larry.
-Alice.

356
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:20,486
So you're Anna's boyfriend.

357
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,425
A princess can kiss a toad.

358
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:23,587
-Frog.
-Toad.

359
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:26,826
-Frog.
-Toad, frog, lobster. They're all the same.

360
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,692
So how long have you been seeing her?

361
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,500
Four months. We're in the first flush.

362
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:37,870
lt's paradise.
 All my nasty habits amuse her.

363
00:37:38,177 --> 00:37:40,407
-You shouldn't smoke.
-Fuck off.

364
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
l'm a doctor.
l'm supposed to say things like that.

365
00:37:43,116 --> 00:37:45,016
-You want one?
-No.

366
00:37:45,818 --> 00:37:47,479
Yes. No.

367
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:49,549
Fuck it, yes.

368
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:51,654
No.

369
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,649
l've given up.

370
00:37:56,996 --> 00:37:59,897
Anna tells me your bloke wrote a book.

371
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:02,662
-Any good?
-Of course.

372
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:05,260
lt's about you, isn't it?

373
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:08,935
-Some of me.
-Oh? What did he leave out?

374
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:11,904
The truth.

375
00:38:12,845 --> 00:38:14,540
ls he here, your bloke?

376
00:38:14,614 --> 00:38:17,708
Yeah, he's over there talking to your bird.

377
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,154
My boyfriend's here.

378
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:25,818
He's here? Where?

379
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,820
There.

380
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:31,160
With Alice?

381
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:33,792
l believe you're acquainted.

382
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:40,902
-l've never seen him before.
-No.

383
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:43,474
But you've spoken.

384
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,801
Well, conversed.

385
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:49,239
-Corresponded.
-l wrote to him?

386
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:54,077
On the Net. You sent him to the aquarium.
l happened to be there.

387
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:56,618
Nice work, Cupid.

388
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:03,360
-We need to talk about this.
-No, we don't.

389
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:05,054
He's very pretty.

390
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:08,761
She is very tall.

391
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,740
So you're a stripper?

392
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,702
Yeah.

393
00:39:18,444 --> 00:39:19,604
And?

394
00:39:42,502 --> 00:39:44,163
You take care, now.

395
00:39:44,537 --> 00:39:45,834
l will.

396
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,672
You, too.

397
00:39:56,082 --> 00:39:58,573
That's the way it should be.

398
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:03,711
He's very funny.

399
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:10,728
Excuse me. Nice to meet you.

400
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:20,271
-Pleased with the success?
-Yes, absolutely.

401
00:40:21,107 --> 00:40:23,098
Yours was the best.

402
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:25,601
You were the belle of the bullshit.

403
00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:27,373
Who were those awful people?

404
00:40:27,446 --> 00:40:30,540
-Where do they come from?
-Why should we care?

405
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:38,123
-You get this one. You'll miss your train.
-l'll be fine.

406
00:40:38,658 --> 00:40:40,148
Come on, it's cold.

407
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,497
l'll see you on Sunday.

408
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,329
Where to, love?

409
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:00,672
Taxi!

410
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:12,984
Sorry.

411
00:41:13,326 --> 00:41:15,988
Why don't you make up
your bleeding mind?

412
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:24,434
Thank you so much.
l appreciate your coming.

413
00:41:24,503 --> 00:41:26,767
l'll call you tomorrow. See you next week.

414
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,773
-Thanks.
-Thanks very much.

415
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:34,510
-l thought you'd gone.
-l forgot this.

416
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:40,618
So he's a dermatologist.
Can you get more boring than that?

417
00:41:40,686 --> 00:41:43,655
-Obituarist?
-Failed novelist, please.

418
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,253
l was sorry about your book.

419
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:48,486
Thanks. l blame the title.

420
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:51,991
So we pull out our Christmas crackers
with those appalling jokes.

421
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:54,760
My guy says,
''Hang on. These are second-rate jokes.

422
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:58,326
''l've got a first-rate joke.
Sit back and take notice.''

423
00:41:58,404 --> 00:42:01,202
So we go, ''Okay, what's the joke?''
And he says:

424
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:03,237
''lt's based on <i>A Christmas Carol...</i>

425
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:05,675
''which is why it seems
so relevant on Christmas Day.''

426
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:08,111
l haven't even seen you for a year.

427
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,306
Yes, you have.

428
00:42:09,382 --> 00:42:11,782
Only because you stalk me
outside my studio.

429
00:42:11,851 --> 00:42:13,910
l don't stalk. l lurk.

430
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:16,181
And when l'm not there you look for me.

431
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:19,747
-How do you know if you're not there?
-Because l am there...

432
00:42:20,426 --> 00:42:22,121
lurking from a distance.

433
00:42:30,803 --> 00:42:32,134
Look at me.

434
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:35,033
Tell me you're not in love with me.

435
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:37,969
l'm not in love with you.

436
00:42:40,613 --> 00:42:42,274
You just lied.

437
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:51,248
l'm your stranger. Jump.

438
00:43:19,618 --> 00:43:22,382
-Hello, stranger.
-Hello.

439
00:43:23,055 --> 00:43:25,046
lntense conversation?

440
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:29,257
His father died.

441
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:31,853
Were you spying?

442
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:33,796
Lovingly observing...

443
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:35,624
with a telescope.

444
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:39,996
He's taller than in his photo.

445
00:43:40,606 --> 00:43:42,437
His photo's a headshot.

446
00:43:42,508 --> 00:43:44,100
Yeah, l know.

447
00:43:44,176 --> 00:43:48,112
But his head implied a short body,
when, in fact, his head is deceptive.

448
00:43:48,314 --> 00:43:49,338
Deceptive?

449
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:52,816
He's actually got a long body.
He's a stringy fucker.

450
00:43:53,953 --> 00:43:55,511
l could have him.

451
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:59,981
-What? -lf it came to it,
 in a scrap, l could have him.

452
00:44:01,427 --> 00:44:03,861
Did you tell him we call him Cupid?

453
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:07,327
No, that's our joke.

454
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:11,532
l had a chat with young Alice.

455
00:44:11,604 --> 00:44:13,333
-Fancy her?
-Of course.

456
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,168
-Not as much as you.
-Why not?

457
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:17,209
You're a woman. She's a girl.

458
00:44:17,276 --> 00:44:20,768
She has the moronic beauty of youth,
but she's sly.

459
00:44:21,013 --> 00:44:24,505
-She seems open to me.
-That's how she wants to seem.

460
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:28,110
You forget you're dealing with
a clinical observer of the human carnival.

461
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:30,018
-Am l, now?
-Yes.

462
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:34,025
You seem more like the cat
that got the cream. Stop licking yourself.

463
00:44:39,665 --> 00:44:42,828
That's the nastiest thing
you've ever said to me.

464
00:44:46,338 --> 00:44:47,930
That's horrible.

465
00:44:48,174 --> 00:44:49,641
l'm sorry.

466
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,671
l'm so sorry.

467
00:45:40,893 --> 00:45:43,760
-Where have you been?
-Work thing.

468
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,822
Had a drink with Harry.
You never have one drink with Harry.

469
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,869
-You know he's in love with you.
-No, he's not.

470
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:53,168
ls he?

471
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,735
Did you eat?

472
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:59,239
l'll make you something.

473
00:46:00,112 --> 00:46:01,773
l'm not hungry.

474
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:24,894
What?

475
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,097
This will hurt.

476
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,839
l've been with Anna.

477
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:35,374
l'm in love with her.

478
00:46:36,415 --> 00:46:39,043
We've been seeing each other for a year.

479
00:46:39,385 --> 00:46:41,353
lt began at her opening.

480
00:46:57,503 --> 00:46:59,664
-Have a nice one.
-Cheers, guvnor.

481
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:23,725
Don't move.

482
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,789
l want to remember this moment forever.

483
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:30,198
First time l walked through the door,
returning from a business trip...

484
00:47:30,269 --> 00:47:33,067
to be greeted by my wife.

485
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:36,235
l have, in this moment, become an adult.

486
00:47:36,508 --> 00:47:39,068
Thanks for waiting up, you darling.

487
00:47:40,846 --> 00:47:42,507
You goddess.

488
00:47:46,752 --> 00:47:48,344
l missed you.

489
00:47:48,754 --> 00:47:50,449
How about some tea?

490
00:47:50,823 --> 00:47:52,814
Jesus, l'm knackered!

491
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:54,916
-Didn't you sleep on the plane?
-No...

492
00:47:54,994 --> 00:47:59,055
because the permed German next to me
was snoring like a Messerschmitt.

493
00:47:59,131 --> 00:48:01,531
-What's the time?
-About midnight.

494
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:04,101
Time. What a tricky little fucker.

495
00:48:04,837 --> 00:48:08,170
My head's in two places.
My brain actually hurts.

496
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,232
-Do you want some food?
-No, l need a bath.

497
00:48:11,677 --> 00:48:14,805
-l'll run it for you.
-No, l'll have a shower.

498
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,511
You okay?

499
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:18,648
How was the thing?

500
00:48:18,717 --> 00:48:21,880
As dermatological conferences go,
it was a riot.

501
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:24,380
How was the hotel?

502
00:48:24,723 --> 00:48:28,352
Someone told me that the beautiful
people of the Paranoid Hotel...

503
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:32,363
the concierge, the bellboys and girls....
Did you know this?

504
00:48:32,665 --> 00:48:35,463
-They're all whores.
-Everybody knows that.

505
00:48:36,135 --> 00:48:37,295
l didn't.

506
00:48:39,905 --> 00:48:42,897
l don't suppose
 you'd fancy a friendly poke.

507
00:48:43,342 --> 00:48:45,003
l just had a bath.

508
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:47,876
Right.

509
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:51,449
l'll see to myself, then,
in the Elle Decoration bathroom.

510
00:48:51,517 --> 00:48:55,044
-You chose that bathroom.
-And every time l wash in it l feel dirty.

511
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,554
lt's cleaner than l am. lt's got attitude.

512
00:48:57,623 --> 00:48:59,591
The mirror says, ''Who the fuck are you?''

513
00:48:59,658 --> 00:49:02,320
-You chose it.
-Doesn't mean l like it.

514
00:49:02,494 --> 00:49:04,359
We shouldn't have this.

515
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,261
l hear middle-class guilt.

516
00:49:06,331 --> 00:49:10,267
Working-class guilt.
Why are you dressed if you just had a bath?

517
00:49:11,837 --> 00:49:13,532
We needed some milk.

518
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,868
You okay?

519
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:18,638
-You?
-Yeah.

520
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:24,212
l'm going.

521
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,882
-l'm sorry.
-lrrelevant.

522
00:49:28,087 --> 00:49:29,918
What are you sorry for?

523
00:49:30,222 --> 00:49:31,712
Everything.

524
00:49:31,924 --> 00:49:34,916
-Why didn't you tell me before?
-Cowardice.

525
00:49:36,795 --> 00:49:38,592
ls it because she's successful?

526
00:49:38,664 --> 00:49:41,827
No, it's because she doesn't need me.

527
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,931
Did you bring her here?

528
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:50,330
Yes.

529
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:57,373
-Didn't she get married?
-She stopped seeing me.

530
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,043
ls that when we went to the country?

531
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,781
To celebrate our third anniversary?

532
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,618
Did you phone her? Beg her to come back?

533
00:50:08,193 --> 00:50:10,855
-When you went for your long, lonely walks?
-Yes.

534
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:12,294
You're a piece of shit.

535
00:50:12,364 --> 00:50:15,390
Deception is brutal.
l'm not pretending otherwise.

536
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:16,627
How?

537
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:18,425
How does it work?

538
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:22,099
How do you do this to someone?

539
00:50:23,876 --> 00:50:25,537
Not good enough.

540
00:50:26,845 --> 00:50:30,212
-l fell in love with her, Alice.
-As if you had no choice?

541
00:50:30,282 --> 00:50:32,216
There's a moment. There's always a moment.

542
00:50:32,284 --> 00:50:35,447
''l can do this, l can give in to this,
or l can resist it.''

543
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:39,514
And l don't know when your moment was,
but l bet you there was one.

544
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:41,024
l'm going.

545
00:50:43,796 --> 00:50:46,230
-lt's not safe out there.
-And it's safe in here?

546
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:48,163
What about your things?

547
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:51,163
-l don't need things.
-Where will you go?

548
00:50:51,436 --> 00:50:52,767
Disappear.

549
00:50:55,607 --> 00:50:58,440
The Sultan has returned bearing gifts.

550
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:02,777
Thank you.

551
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,485
They're beautiful.

552
00:51:09,555 --> 00:51:12,456
Here's a thing. Alice was at the hotel.

553
00:51:13,225 --> 00:51:14,214
What?

554
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:17,157
They sell these
 arty postcards in the lobby.

555
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:19,863
l bought one to boost your sales.

556
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,762
''Young Woman, London.''

557
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:31,006
And l checked for your book
in The Museum of Modern Art. lt was there.

558
00:51:31,977 --> 00:51:33,672
Someone bought one.

559
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:36,541
This guy with a ridiculous little beard.

560
00:51:36,615 --> 00:51:41,279
He was drooling over your photo on
the inside cover. He fancied you, the geek.

561
00:51:41,486 --> 00:51:44,649
l was so proud of you.
You've broken New York.

562
00:51:45,324 --> 00:51:46,814
You're wonderful.

563
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,791
Don't ever forget it.

564
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:55,530
Can l still see you?

565
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:03,007
Dan, can l still see you? Answer me.

566
00:52:03,075 --> 00:52:05,805
l can't see you.
lf l see you, l'll never leave you.

567
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:09,279
-What will you do if l find someone else?
-Be jealous.

568
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:13,140
You still fancy me?

569
00:52:14,052 --> 00:52:15,383
Of course.

570
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:17,618
You're lying.

571
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:20,449
l've been you.

572
00:52:23,562 --> 00:52:25,223
Will you hold me?

573
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,630
-l amuse you, but l bore you.
-No.

574
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:37,906
You did love me?

575
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,472
l'll always love you. l hate hurting you.

576
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,238
Then why are you?

577
00:52:44,483 --> 00:52:46,417
'Cause l'm selfish.

578
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:50,116
-And l think l'll be happier with her.
-You won't.

579
00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:52,620
You'll miss me.

580
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:56,389
No one will ever love you as much as l do.

581
00:52:57,696 --> 00:52:59,857
Why isn't love enough?

582
00:53:01,266 --> 00:53:04,929
l'm the one who leaves.
l'm supposed to leave you.

583
00:53:19,952 --> 00:53:22,011
Make some tea, buster.

584
00:54:13,038 --> 00:54:14,733
Why are you dressed?

585
00:54:18,176 --> 00:54:20,542
Because l think
you might be about to leave me...

586
00:54:20,612 --> 00:54:23,672
and l didn't want to be wearing
a dressing gown.

587
00:54:26,585 --> 00:54:28,917
l slept with someone in New York.

588
00:54:30,155 --> 00:54:31,486
A whore.

589
00:54:32,824 --> 00:54:34,121
l'm sorry.

590
00:54:38,497 --> 00:54:40,328
Why did you tell me?

591
00:54:41,266 --> 00:54:44,064
-l couldn't lie to you.
-Why not?

592
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:47,065
Because l love you.

593
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:04,152
lt's fine.

594
00:55:05,023 --> 00:55:07,014
Really? Why?

595
00:55:12,097 --> 00:55:13,792
Something's wrong.

596
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:19,567
Tell me.

597
00:55:23,075 --> 00:55:24,906
Are you leaving me?

598
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:30,975
Because of this?

599
00:55:33,652 --> 00:55:34,812
Why?

600
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:38,253
Dan.

601
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:41,622
Cupid?

602
00:55:43,462 --> 00:55:45,054
He's our joke.

603
00:55:46,031 --> 00:55:47,362
l love him.

604
00:55:48,767 --> 00:55:50,701
You're seeing him now?

605
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:54,663
Since when?

606
00:56:00,212 --> 00:56:03,045
Since my opening last year.

607
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:05,974
l'm disgusting.

608
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:10,245
You're phenomenal.

609
00:56:11,857 --> 00:56:13,518
You're so clever.

610
00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:17,690
Why did you marry me?

611
00:56:19,397 --> 00:56:21,888
l stopped seeing him. l wanted us to work.

612
00:56:21,967 --> 00:56:24,959
-Why did you tell me you wanted children?
-Because l did.

613
00:56:25,036 --> 00:56:27,869
-And now you want children with him?
-Yes.

614
00:56:30,008 --> 00:56:31,566
l don't know.

615
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,604
But we're happy...

616
00:56:37,816 --> 00:56:39,147
aren't we?

617
00:56:44,422 --> 00:56:47,084
-You're gonna go live with him?
-You stay here if you want.

618
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:49,753
l don't give a fuck about the spoils.

619
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:54,860
You did this to me the day we met.
You let me hang myself for your amusement.

620
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:57,424
Why didn't you just tell me
when l walked in the door?

621
00:56:57,502 --> 00:57:00,665
-l was scared.
-You're a coward, you spoilt bitch.

622
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:06,004
Are you dressed
because you thought l might hit you?

623
00:57:08,613 --> 00:57:10,205
What do you think l am?

624
00:57:10,282 --> 00:57:12,682
-l've been hit before.
-Not by me.

625
00:57:15,387 --> 00:57:17,116
ls he a good fuck?

626
00:57:18,623 --> 00:57:20,147
Don't do this.

627
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:22,616
Just answer the question.

628
00:57:22,861 --> 00:57:24,522
ls he good?

629
00:57:24,863 --> 00:57:26,194
Yes.

630
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,292
Better than me?

631
00:57:30,635 --> 00:57:32,694
-Different.
-Better?

632
00:57:35,407 --> 00:57:37,739
-Gentler.
-What does that mean?

633
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,703
-You know what it means.
-Tell me.

634
00:57:40,779 --> 00:57:42,337
-No.
-l treat you like a whore?

635
00:57:42,414 --> 00:57:44,644
-Sometimes.
-Why would that be?

636
00:57:45,684 --> 00:57:48,084
-l'm sorry, you're--
-Don't say it.

637
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,947
Don't you fucking say:

638
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:52,819
''You're too good for me.''
l am, but don't say it.

639
00:57:52,891 --> 00:57:55,553
You're making the mistake of your life.

640
00:57:57,362 --> 00:58:00,854
You're leaving me because you believe
that you don't deserve happiness...

641
00:58:00,932 --> 00:58:02,524
but you do, Anna.

642
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:08,496
Did you have a bath
because you had sex with him?

643
00:58:09,241 --> 00:58:11,368
So you wouldn't smell of him?

644
00:58:12,777 --> 00:58:14,938
So you'd feel less guilty?

645
00:58:16,114 --> 00:58:17,706
How do you feel?

646
00:58:18,383 --> 00:58:19,873
Guilty.

647
00:58:21,353 --> 00:58:23,184
Did you ever love me?

648
00:58:24,055 --> 00:58:25,215
Yes.

649
00:58:57,822 --> 00:58:59,653
Did you do it here?

650
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,120
No.

651
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:04,892
Why not?

652
00:59:07,365 --> 00:59:09,128
Do you wish we did?

653
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,997
Just tell me the truth.

654
00:59:12,904 --> 00:59:14,735
Yes, we did it here.

655
00:59:17,742 --> 00:59:18,902
Where?

656
00:59:23,948 --> 00:59:25,108
There.

657
00:59:27,652 --> 00:59:28,983
On this?

658
00:59:33,191 --> 00:59:35,489
We had our first fuck on this.

659
00:59:36,294 --> 00:59:37,989
Did you think of me?

660
00:59:40,832 --> 00:59:42,163
When?

661
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:47,136
When did you do it here?

662
00:59:47,472 --> 00:59:49,997
-Answer the question!
-This evening.

663
00:59:54,813 --> 00:59:56,246
Did you come?

664
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:01,510
-Why are you doing this?
-'Cause l want to know.

665
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,917
-Yes, l came.
-How many times?

666
01:00:04,989 --> 01:00:06,854
-Twice.
-How?

667
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:10,987
-First he went down on me, then we fucked.
-Who was where?

668
01:00:11,062 --> 01:00:13,997
l was on top,
then he fucked me from behind.

669
01:00:14,065 --> 01:00:16,932
-That's when you came the second time?
-God.

670
01:00:17,702 --> 01:00:21,502
-Why is the sex so important?
-Because l'm a fucking caveman!

671
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,133
Did you touch yourself
while he fucked you?

672
01:00:24,509 --> 01:00:26,033
-You wank for him?
-Sometimes.

673
01:00:26,111 --> 01:00:27,976
-And he does?
-We do everything...

674
01:00:28,046 --> 01:00:30,776
-that people who have sex do.
-You enjoy sucking him off?

675
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:32,077
-You like his cock?
-l love it.

676
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,674
-Like him coming in your face?
-Yes!

677
01:00:33,752 --> 01:00:36,220
-What does it taste like?
-Like you, but sweeter.

678
01:00:36,287 --> 01:00:39,745
That's the spirit. Thank you.
Thank you for your honesty.

679
01:00:39,824 --> 01:00:41,792
Now fuck off and die...

680
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:44,626
you fucked-up slag.

681
01:02:08,012 --> 01:02:09,604
l love you.

682
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:12,939
Thank you.

683
01:02:15,286 --> 01:02:18,778
-What's this room called?
-The Paradise Suite.

684
01:02:19,057 --> 01:02:21,992
-How many Paradise Suites are there?
-Eight.

685
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:29,460
Do l have to pay you to talk to me?

686
01:02:29,534 --> 01:02:32,435
No. But if you want to tip me,
you're welcome.

687
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:38,906
Thank you.

688
01:02:40,044 --> 01:02:43,707
l used to come here a million years ago.
lt was a punk club.

689
01:02:43,915 --> 01:02:45,780
The stage was....

690
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,749
Everything is a version of something else.

691
01:02:52,056 --> 01:02:53,683
Twenty years ago.

692
01:02:54,058 --> 01:02:55,423
How old were you?

693
01:02:55,527 --> 01:02:57,358
-Four.
-Christ.

694
01:02:57,562 --> 01:03:01,658
-When l was in flares, you were in nappies.
-My nappies were flared.

695
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:04,327
-You have the face of an angel.
-Thank you.

696
01:03:04,402 --> 01:03:06,632
What does your cunt taste like?

697
01:03:06,938 --> 01:03:08,269
Heaven.

698
01:03:12,377 --> 01:03:13,935
How long have you been doing this?

699
01:03:14,012 --> 01:03:16,708
-Three months.
-Straight after he left you?

700
01:03:17,248 --> 01:03:18,977
No one left me.

701
01:03:20,718 --> 01:03:23,016
-Nice wig.
-Thank you.

702
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:26,014
Does all this turn you on?

703
01:03:26,124 --> 01:03:27,421
-Sometimes.
-Liar.

704
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:30,518
You're telling me that
'cause you think it's what l want to hear.

705
01:03:30,595 --> 01:03:32,495
You think l'm turned on
by it turning you on.

706
01:03:32,564 --> 01:03:36,864
The thought of me creaming myself when
l strip for strangers doesn't turn you on?

707
01:03:36,935 --> 01:03:38,926
Put like that, yes.

708
01:03:42,206 --> 01:03:44,834
-Are you flirting with me?
-Maybe.

709
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:48,004
-Are you allowed to flirt with me?
-Sure.

710
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,639
-Really?
-No, l'm not. l'm breaking all the rules.

711
01:03:50,715 --> 01:03:53,309
-You're mocking me.
-Yes, l'm allowed to flirt.

712
01:03:53,384 --> 01:03:54,681
To prize my money from me.

713
01:03:54,752 --> 01:03:57,915
To prize your money from you,
l may do or say as l please.

714
01:03:57,989 --> 01:03:59,854
-Except touch.
-We're not allowed to touch.

715
01:03:59,924 --> 01:04:01,255
Open your legs.

716
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:03,254
Wider.

717
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:15,002
Show me.

718
01:04:20,345 --> 01:04:22,472
So what would happen
if l touched you now?

719
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:24,708
-l'd call security.
-What would they do?

720
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:27,307
They would ask you to leave
and not to come back.

721
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:29,853
-And if l refused to leave?
-They would remove you.

722
01:04:29,921 --> 01:04:32,651
Those are security cameras in the ceiling.

723
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,690
l think it's best
 l don't attempt to touch you.

724
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:42,161
l'd like to touch you. Later.

725
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,700
-l'm not a whore.
-l wouldn't pay.

726
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:48,735
Why the fuck did he leave you?

727
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,636
-What's your job?
-A question. You asked me a question.

728
01:04:51,709 --> 01:04:53,438
-So?
-lt's a chink in your armor.

729
01:04:53,511 --> 01:04:55,945
-l'm not wearing armor.
-Yes, you are.

730
01:04:56,014 --> 01:04:58,847
-Why are you calling yourself Jane?
-Because it's my name.

731
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,781
We both know it isn't.

732
01:05:02,086 --> 01:05:04,054
You're all protecting your identities.

733
01:05:04,122 --> 01:05:07,785
There's a girl out there who calls
herself Venus. What's her real name?

734
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:10,327
-Pluto.
-You're cheeky.

735
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:13,329
-Would you like me to stop being cheeky?
-No.

736
01:05:14,232 --> 01:05:15,756
What's your name?

737
01:05:17,235 --> 01:05:18,361
Daniel.

738
01:05:19,671 --> 01:05:21,332
Daniel the dermatologist.

739
01:05:21,406 --> 01:05:23,738
-l never told you my job.
-l guessed.

740
01:05:24,075 --> 01:05:25,633
You're strong.

741
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:29,805
There's another one out there.
Judging by the scars, a patient of Dr. Tit.

742
01:05:29,881 --> 01:05:32,577
Calls herself Cupid.
Who's gonna tell her he was a bloke?

743
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:36,916
-He wasn't a bloke. He was a little boy.
-l want you to tell me your name.

744
01:05:42,226 --> 01:05:43,454
Please.

745
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:47,560
Thank you. My name is Jane.

746
01:05:48,332 --> 01:05:49,697
Your real name.

747
01:05:51,402 --> 01:05:52,733
Thank you.

748
01:05:53,404 --> 01:05:56,134
-My real name is Jane.
-Careful.

749
01:05:59,811 --> 01:06:02,473
Thank you. Still Jane.

750
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,739
l've got about another £500 here.

751
01:06:04,816 --> 01:06:09,753
Why don't l just give you all this money
and you tell me what your real name is...

752
01:06:10,588 --> 01:06:11,782
Alice?

753
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:13,957
l promise.

754
01:06:15,393 --> 01:06:16,724
Thank you.

755
01:06:17,962 --> 01:06:19,554
My real name...

756
01:06:19,731 --> 01:06:22,427
is plain Jane Jones.

757
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,297
l may be rich, but l'm not stupid.

758
01:06:24,368 --> 01:06:26,632
What a shame, Doc.
l love them rich and stupid.

759
01:06:26,704 --> 01:06:28,865
Don't you fuck around with me.

760
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,500
-l apologize.
-Accepted.

761
01:06:32,076 --> 01:06:35,512
All the girls in this hellhole,
the pneumatic robots...

762
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,071
the coked-up baby dolls,
and you're no different.

763
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:41,242
You all use stage names
to con yourselves you're someone else...

764
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:44,777
so you don't feel ashamed showing
your cunts and assholes to strangers.

765
01:06:44,856 --> 01:06:46,323
l'm trying to have a conversation.

766
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:48,255
-You're out of cash.
-l paid for this room.

767
01:06:48,326 --> 01:06:49,384
This is extra.

768
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,018
-We met last year.
-Wrong girl.

769
01:06:51,095 --> 01:06:52,426
Talk to me!

770
01:06:53,064 --> 01:06:55,624
-l am.
-Talk to me in real life.

771
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,236
l didn't know you'd be here.
l know who you are.

772
01:07:00,505 --> 01:07:01,904
l love you.

773
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:05,932
l love everything about you that hurts.

774
01:07:18,923 --> 01:07:20,891
She won't even see me.

775
01:07:22,226 --> 01:07:25,992
-You feel the same. l know it.
-You can't cry in here.

776
01:07:26,898 --> 01:07:30,334
-Hold me. Let me hold you.
-We're not allowed to touch.

777
01:07:31,435 --> 01:07:34,268
Come home with me. lt's safe.
Let me look after you.

778
01:07:34,338 --> 01:07:37,068
-l don't need looking after.
-Everyone needs looking after.

779
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:39,109
l'm not your revenge fuck.

780
01:07:40,144 --> 01:07:41,873
-l'll pay you.
-l don't need your money.

781
01:07:41,946 --> 01:07:43,208
-You have my money.
-Thank you.

782
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:46,808
-''Thank you.'' ls that some kind of rule?
-Just being polite.

783
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,553
Do you get a lot of grown men
crying their guts out here?

784
01:07:52,623 --> 01:07:54,591
Occupational hazard.

785
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:57,126
Have you ever desired a customer?

786
01:07:58,563 --> 01:07:59,825
Yes.

787
01:07:59,897 --> 01:08:02,092
Then put me out of my misery.
Do you desire me?

788
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,760
Because l'm being pretty honest
about my feelings for you.

789
01:08:04,836 --> 01:08:07,066
-Your feelings?
-Whatever.

790
01:08:07,405 --> 01:08:09,305
No, l don't desire you.

791
01:08:10,575 --> 01:08:11,940
Thank you.

792
01:08:12,877 --> 01:08:15,641
Thank you sincerely for your honesty.

793
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:26,281
You think you haven't give us
anything of yourselves?

794
01:08:26,357 --> 01:08:29,087
Do you think because you don't love us
or desire us...

795
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,754
or even like us, you think you've won?

796
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:33,319
lt's not a war.

797
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,868
lf l asked you to strip right now,
 would you?

798
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:44,601
-Of course. Do you want me to?
-No.

799
01:08:46,244 --> 01:08:49,304
Alice, tell me something true.

800
01:08:50,248 --> 01:08:54,344
Lying is the most fun a girl can have
without taking her clothes off...

801
01:08:54,919 --> 01:08:57,080
but it's better if you do.

802
01:08:58,856 --> 01:09:00,255
You're cold.

803
01:09:00,892 --> 01:09:02,917
You're all cold at heart.

804
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:07,789
What do you have to do
to get a bit of intimacy around here?

805
01:09:07,865 --> 01:09:10,925
Maybe next time
l'll have worked on my intimacy.

806
01:09:11,335 --> 01:09:15,499
No, l'll tell you what's gonna work.
You're gonna take your gear off right now.

807
01:09:15,573 --> 01:09:20,033
You're gonna turn around very slowly,
and you're gonna bend over...

808
01:09:20,611 --> 01:09:24,877
and you're gonna touch the fucking floor
for my viewing pleasure.

809
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,684
ls that what you want?

810
01:09:29,086 --> 01:09:30,986
What else could l want?

811
01:10:38,055 --> 01:10:39,386
l'm sorry.

812
01:10:41,726 --> 01:10:43,717
-What happened?
-Traffic.

813
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:49,197
-Do you want to go stand in the back?
-No, let's have a drink.

814
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:54,967
You look flushed.

815
01:10:56,073 --> 01:10:58,041
You have no need to run.

816
01:10:58,109 --> 01:10:59,633
-Vodka tonic?
-Yes.

817
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:02,907
-Vodka tonic and a Guinness, please.
-Sure.

818
01:11:04,148 --> 01:11:05,581
How was it?

819
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:07,944
Fine.

820
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:09,986
You had lunch?

821
01:11:10,688 --> 01:11:11,985
Then what?

822
01:11:13,758 --> 01:11:16,249
-And then we left.
-And?

823
01:11:17,128 --> 01:11:18,720
There's no ''and.''

824
01:11:21,232 --> 01:11:24,929
You haven't seen him in four months.
There must be an ''and.''

825
01:11:25,236 --> 01:11:27,670
-How is he?
-Terrible.

826
01:11:36,414 --> 01:11:38,678
-Keep the change.
-Thank you, sir.

827
01:11:42,753 --> 01:11:44,744
How is his dermatology?

828
01:11:44,955 --> 01:11:48,721
-He's in private practice now.
-ls he?

829
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:53,695
Was he weeping all over the place?

830
01:11:53,798 --> 01:11:57,029
-Some of the time.
-Poor bastard.

831
01:11:57,701 --> 01:12:00,261
Was he difficult?

832
01:12:02,807 --> 01:12:04,968
Are you angry that l saw him?

833
01:12:05,109 --> 01:12:06,770
No. lt's just...

834
01:12:08,145 --> 01:12:09,737
l haven't seen Alice.

835
01:12:09,814 --> 01:12:12,442
You can't see Alice.
You don't know where she is.

836
01:12:12,516 --> 01:12:14,643
l haven't tried to find her.

837
01:12:16,053 --> 01:12:17,418
You know why l saw him.

838
01:12:17,488 --> 01:12:20,252
He's been begging me for months.
l saw him so he'd sign.

839
01:12:20,324 --> 01:12:22,554
-So has he signed?
-Yes.

840
01:12:26,997 --> 01:12:28,555
Congratulations.

841
01:12:29,433 --> 01:12:31,264
You're a divorcée.

842
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,499
Double divorcée.

843
01:12:36,507 --> 01:12:37,804
Sorry.

844
01:12:38,843 --> 01:12:40,367
How do you feel?

845
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:42,739
Tired.

846
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:48,282
l love you.

847
01:12:49,019 --> 01:12:50,748
And l need a piss.

848
01:13:27,691 --> 01:13:29,215
l hate this place.

849
01:13:30,261 --> 01:13:31,660
At least it's central.

850
01:13:31,729 --> 01:13:34,789
l hate central.
Central London's a theme park.

851
01:13:35,766 --> 01:13:40,100
l hate retro. l hate the future.
Where does that leave me?

852
01:13:41,205 --> 01:13:42,502
Come back.

853
01:13:43,274 --> 01:13:46,107
-You promised you wouldn't.
-Come back.

854
01:13:50,447 --> 01:13:53,507
-How's work?
-Jesus. Work's shit, okay?

855
01:14:02,193 --> 01:14:06,061
Do they have waiters here?
l love you. Please come back.

856
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:08,693
l'm not coming back.

857
01:14:14,605 --> 01:14:15,697
Sign.

858
01:14:16,907 --> 01:14:18,169
No pen.

859
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:24,739
Pen.

860
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,548
Give me back my hand.

861
01:14:39,163 --> 01:14:40,255
Sign.

862
01:14:46,837 --> 01:14:48,930
l'll sign on one condition.

863
01:14:50,774 --> 01:14:54,005
We skip this.
We go to my sleek new surgery...

864
01:14:54,078 --> 01:14:57,241
and we christen the patients' bed
with our final fuck.

865
01:14:57,314 --> 01:14:59,214
l know you don't want to...

866
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:03,677
and l know you think l'm sick for asking,
but that's what l'm asking.

867
01:15:03,754 --> 01:15:05,449
For old times' sake.

868
01:15:06,257 --> 01:15:08,384
Because l'm obsessed with you.

869
01:15:09,093 --> 01:15:11,789
Because l can't get over you unless....

870
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:14,427
Because l think, on some small level...

871
01:15:14,498 --> 01:15:17,797
you owe me something
for deceiving me so exquisitely.

872
01:15:18,736 --> 01:15:23,105
For all these reasons,
l am begging you to give me your body.

873
01:15:25,009 --> 01:15:26,772
You'd be my whore.

874
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:30,178
And in return,
l will pay you with your liberty.

875
01:15:32,116 --> 01:15:35,415
You do this,
l swear l will not contact you again.

876
01:15:40,591 --> 01:15:42,422
l'm going to the bar.

877
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,551
l assume you still drink vodka tonic?

878
01:16:07,951 --> 01:16:10,146
You slept with him, didn't you?

879
01:16:36,647 --> 01:16:39,445
-What do you expect me to do?
-Understand.

880
01:16:40,718 --> 01:16:42,185
Why didn't you lie to me?

881
01:16:42,252 --> 01:16:44,846
Because we said
we'd always tell each other the truth.

882
01:16:44,922 --> 01:16:46,514
What's so great about the truth?

883
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:49,889
Try lying for a change.
lt's the currency of the world.

884
01:16:52,096 --> 01:16:56,795
l did what he wanted,
and now he will leave us alone.

885
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,235
l love you.

886
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:05,306
-l didn't give him anything.
-Your body?

887
01:17:07,111 --> 01:17:10,603
lf Alice came to you, desperate...

888
01:17:11,081 --> 01:17:13,174
with all that love still between you...

889
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,309
and she said she needed you to want her...

890
01:17:15,386 --> 01:17:17,479
so she could get over you, you'd do it.

891
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:20,546
l wouldn't like it either,
 but l'd forgive you.

892
01:17:20,858 --> 01:17:23,986
-lt's kindness.
-No, cowardice.

893
01:17:24,194 --> 01:17:26,389
You haven't got the guts 
to let him hate you.

894
01:17:38,475 --> 01:17:42,206
l'm doing this because l feel guilty,
and because l pity you.

895
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:45,180
-You know that, don't you?
-Yes.

896
01:17:46,016 --> 01:17:48,883
-Feel good about yourself?
-No.

897
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:00,628
lt's gone.

898
01:18:01,665 --> 01:18:05,795
-We're not innocent anymore.
-Don't stop loving me.

899
01:18:05,869 --> 01:18:09,361
l can see it draining out of you.
lt's me, remember?

900
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:13,234
lt was a stupid thing to do,
and it meant nothing.

901
01:18:13,644 --> 01:18:15,908
lf you love me enough, you'll forgive me.

902
01:18:15,979 --> 01:18:18,379
-Are you testing me?
-No.

903
01:18:18,982 --> 01:18:22,884
-l do understand.
-No. He understands.

904
01:18:25,155 --> 01:18:28,318
All l can see is him all over you.

905
01:18:28,992 --> 01:18:32,393
He's clever, your ex-husband.

906
01:18:33,897 --> 01:18:35,421
l almost admire him.

907
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:41,360
You going to tell him?

908
01:18:42,973 --> 01:18:44,463
l don't know.

909
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,848
Better to be truthful
 about this kind of thing.

910
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:08,358
Sign.

911
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,430
l forgive you.

912
01:19:21,879 --> 01:19:23,210
Sign.

913
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:28,917
<i>I think you enjoyed it.</i>

914
01:19:29,953 --> 01:19:33,480
He wheedles you into bed. The old jokes...

915
01:19:33,557 --> 01:19:37,516
the strange familiarity.
l think you had a whale of a time.

916
01:19:37,594 --> 01:19:39,926
And the truth is l'll never know
unless l ask him.

917
01:19:39,997 --> 01:19:41,521
Why don't you?

918
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,172
Yes?

919
01:20:32,849 --> 01:20:34,646
You can go in now.

920
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:45,160
-l want Anna back.
-She's made her choice.

921
01:20:45,228 --> 01:20:47,711
l owe you an apology.
 l fell in love with her.

922
01:20:47,737 --> 01:20:49,849
My intention was not
to make you suffer.

923
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,960
So where's the apology? You cunt.

924
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:56,896
l apologize.
lf you love her, you'll let her go...

925
01:20:56,974 --> 01:20:58,601
so she can be happy.

926
01:20:58,675 --> 01:21:01,473
-She doesn't want to be happy.
-Everybody wants to be happy.

927
01:21:01,545 --> 01:21:04,946
Depressives don't. They want to be unhappy
to confirm they're depressed.

928
01:21:05,015 --> 01:21:07,210
lf they were happy,
they couldn't be depressed.

929
01:21:07,284 --> 01:21:10,742
They'd have to go out into the world
and live, which can be depressing.

930
01:21:10,821 --> 01:21:13,289
-Anna's not a depressive.
-lsn't she?

931
01:21:13,357 --> 01:21:16,417
-l love her.
-Boo-hoo. So do l.

932
01:21:16,827 --> 01:21:19,625
She's gone back to you
because she can't bear your suffering.

933
01:21:19,696 --> 01:21:21,425
You don't know who she is.

934
01:21:21,498 --> 01:21:26,094
-You love her like a dog loves its owner.
-And the owner loves the dog for so doing.

935
01:21:26,169 --> 01:21:28,194
You'll hurt her. You'll never forgive her.

936
01:21:28,271 --> 01:21:30,364
Of course l forgive her.
 l have forgiven her.

937
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,705
Without forgiveness we're savages.
You're drowning.

938
01:21:33,777 --> 01:21:36,871
-You only met her because of me.
-Yeah. Thanks.

939
01:21:36,947 --> 01:21:39,108
lt's a joke. Your marriage is a joke.

940
01:21:39,182 --> 01:21:42,674
Here's a good one. She never sent
the divorce papers to her lawyer.

941
01:21:42,753 --> 01:21:47,656
Now, to a towering romantic hero like you,
l don't doubt l am somewhat common.

942
01:21:47,724 --> 01:21:50,022
But l am, nevertheless,
what she has chosen...

943
01:21:50,093 --> 01:21:52,857
and we must respect what the woman wants.

944
01:21:53,964 --> 01:21:57,331
lf you go near her again, l swear...

945
01:21:58,301 --> 01:22:00,030
l will kill you.

946
01:22:04,374 --> 01:22:07,502
Okay. l have patients to see.

947
01:22:07,577 --> 01:22:09,772
When she came here,
do you think she enjoyed it?

948
01:22:09,846 --> 01:22:12,474
l didn't do it to give her a nice time.

949
01:22:12,549 --> 01:22:14,710
l fucked her to fuck you up.

950
01:22:15,218 --> 01:22:18,813
A good fight is never clean.
And of course she enjoyed it.

951
01:22:18,889 --> 01:22:21,483
As you know, she loves a guilty fuck.

952
01:22:21,558 --> 01:22:24,220
-You're an animal.
-Yeah? What are you?

953
01:22:24,294 --> 01:22:27,388
You think love is simple.
You think the heart is like a diagram.

954
01:22:27,464 --> 01:22:31,093
Have you ever seen a human heart?
lt looks like a fist wrapped in blood!

955
01:22:31,168 --> 01:22:34,194
Go fuck yourself. You writer!

956
01:22:34,604 --> 01:22:35,969
You liar!

957
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:38,473
You go check a few facts
while l get my hands dirty.

958
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:41,136
She hates your hands.
She hates your simplicity.

959
01:22:41,211 --> 01:22:43,577
l spent the whole of last week
talking about you.

960
01:22:43,647 --> 01:22:47,048
l know all your ways. Anna says
you fucked her with your eyes closed.

961
01:22:47,117 --> 01:22:51,349
She tells me you wake in the night
crying for your mother, you mommy's boy.

962
01:22:51,421 --> 01:22:52,945
l could go on.

963
01:22:55,092 --> 01:22:56,787
Shall we stop this?

964
01:23:02,466 --> 01:23:05,458
lt's over. Accept it.

965
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:13,509
You don't know
 the first thing about love...

966
01:23:13,944 --> 01:23:16,572
because you don't understand compromise.

967
01:23:25,288 --> 01:23:28,052
-Don't cry on me.
-l'm sorry.

968
01:23:30,894 --> 01:23:32,919
l don't know what to do.

969
01:23:33,597 --> 01:23:36,760
You want my advice? You go back to Alice.

970
01:23:39,803 --> 01:23:41,532
She'd never have me.

971
01:23:43,373 --> 01:23:45,967
-She's vanished.
-No, she hasn't.

972
01:23:46,243 --> 01:23:48,211
l found her, by accident.

973
01:23:48,678 --> 01:23:50,873
She's working in a club.

974
01:23:52,048 --> 01:23:54,380
Yes, l saw her naked.

975
01:23:55,218 --> 01:23:57,209
No, l did not fuck her.

976
01:23:58,188 --> 01:23:59,849
You spoke to her?

977
01:24:04,694 --> 01:24:06,924
Yes, l know. One minute.

978
01:24:08,398 --> 01:24:09,865
How is she?

979
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:12,028
She loves you...

980
01:24:12,736 --> 01:24:14,761
beyond comprehension.

981
01:24:16,072 --> 01:24:17,801
Your prescription.

982
01:24:18,975 --> 01:24:20,840
lt's where she works.

983
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,779
Go to her.

984
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:27,480
Thank you.

985
01:24:31,254 --> 01:24:33,745
You still pissing about on the Net?

986
01:24:35,058 --> 01:24:36,525
Not recently.

987
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,452
-l wanted to kill you.
-l thought you wanted to fuck me.

988
01:24:40,697 --> 01:24:42,289
Don't get lippy.

989
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:46,431
l liked your book, by the way.

990
01:24:46,703 --> 01:24:49,797
Thanks. You stand alone.

991
01:24:50,006 --> 01:24:51,496
With Anna.

992
01:24:52,709 --> 01:24:57,476
-You still writing obituaries? Busy?
-l was made editor.

993
01:24:57,714 --> 01:25:00,649
-Yeah? How come?
-Previous editor died.

994
01:25:04,287 --> 01:25:08,189
Alcohol poisoning.
l sat with him for a week in the hospital.

995
01:25:10,493 --> 01:25:12,927
l really do have patients to see.

996
01:25:14,998 --> 01:25:17,489
-Thank you.
-For what?

997
01:25:18,802 --> 01:25:21,270
-Being kind.
-l am kind.

998
01:25:21,738 --> 01:25:23,865
Your invoice is in the post.

999
01:25:37,687 --> 01:25:39,154
l lied to you.

1000
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:42,218
l did fuck Alice.

1001
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:48,854
Sorry for telling you.
l'm just not big enough to forgive you.

1002
01:25:51,268 --> 01:25:52,599
Buster.

1003
01:26:23,633 --> 01:26:25,430
Show me the sneer.

1004
01:26:28,471 --> 01:26:30,098
Beautiful.

1005
01:26:30,173 --> 01:26:32,004
You'll wake up the hotel.

1006
01:26:38,682 --> 01:26:40,081
Fuck me.

1007
01:26:41,318 --> 01:26:43,616
Again? We have to get up at 6:00.

1008
01:26:43,687 --> 01:26:47,054
How can one man
be so endlessly disappointing?

1009
01:26:47,123 --> 01:26:48,590
That's my charm.

1010
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:52,489
So where are we going?

1011
01:26:53,229 --> 01:26:54,662
-My treat.
-Where are we going?

1012
01:26:54,731 --> 01:26:57,325
My holiday surprise. My rules.

1013
01:26:57,534 --> 01:26:59,695
Where are we going?

1014
01:27:00,971 --> 01:27:03,371
New York.

1015
01:27:05,575 --> 01:27:07,133
You angel.

1016
01:27:08,845 --> 01:27:12,747
-You did remember to pack my passport?
-Of course. lt's with my passport.

1017
01:27:12,816 --> 01:27:14,078
And where's that?

1018
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:18,109
ln a place where you can't look.
No one sees my passport picture.

1019
01:27:23,226 --> 01:27:27,026
When we get on the plane,
we'll have been together four years.

1020
01:27:27,797 --> 01:27:29,355
What about the gap?

1021
01:27:29,432 --> 01:27:32,629
You mean trial separation? Didn't work out.

1022
01:27:32,969 --> 01:27:34,664
Happy anniversary.

1023
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,371
l'm going to take my eyes out.

1024
01:27:45,215 --> 01:27:47,740
-What was in my sandwiches?
-Tuna.

1025
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:51,586
-How many stitches did l get?
-Two.

1026
01:27:51,654 --> 01:27:53,747
But you should have had three.

1027
01:27:55,058 --> 01:27:57,822
-What was your euphemism?
-Disarming.

1028
01:27:58,294 --> 01:28:00,854
Too easy, buster. Next?

1029
01:28:01,297 --> 01:28:04,198
That park. Who'd l go there with?

1030
01:28:05,635 --> 01:28:07,159
Your father.

1031
01:28:08,371 --> 01:28:11,306
Were the chairs
 in the hospital gray or blue?

1032
01:28:11,941 --> 01:28:14,409
-No idea.
-Trick question. They were green.

1033
01:28:14,477 --> 01:28:16,775
You are a trick question.

1034
01:28:22,919 --> 01:28:25,387
How come we never took a vacation?

1035
01:28:26,156 --> 01:28:27,623
We went to the country.

1036
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:31,649
Doesn't count. You were off
making sneaky phone calls...

1037
01:28:31,995 --> 01:28:34,293
to that witch we do not mention.

1038
01:28:39,436 --> 01:28:40,801
Come to bed.

1039
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:42,394
l need a smoke.

1040
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:48,040
-How'd you manage to give up?
-Deep inner strength.

1041
01:28:58,721 --> 01:29:00,052
Why me?

1042
01:29:01,624 --> 01:29:04,320
You could have chosen anyone. Why me?

1043
01:29:05,462 --> 01:29:07,657
Because you cut off your crusts.

1044
01:29:10,967 --> 01:29:12,229
And this.

1045
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:18,764
-When are you going to stop stripping?
-Soon.

1046
01:29:19,075 --> 01:29:21,805
-You're addicted to it.
-No, l'm not.

1047
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:23,539
lt paid for this.

1048
01:29:25,748 --> 01:29:27,545
Tell me what happened.

1049
01:29:29,185 --> 01:29:32,586
-Nothing happened.
-But he came to the club.

1050
01:29:33,156 --> 01:29:36,250
Lots of men come to the club.
You came to the club.

1051
01:29:50,006 --> 01:29:53,134
-<i>The look on your face.</i>
-<i>The look on your face.</i>

1052
01:29:54,878 --> 01:29:57,438
<i>What a face. What a wig.</i>

1053
01:30:03,186 --> 01:30:05,313
l saw this face...

1054
01:30:07,223 --> 01:30:09,555
this vision...

1055
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:14,362
when you stepped into the road.
lt was the moment of my life.

1056
01:30:15,798 --> 01:30:19,063
-This is the moment of your life.
-You were perfect.

1057
01:30:19,369 --> 01:30:20,859
l still am.

1058
01:30:22,071 --> 01:30:24,039
On the way to the hospital...

1059
01:30:24,374 --> 01:30:26,239
<i>I kissed your forehead.</i>

1060
01:30:26,809 --> 01:30:28,106
<i>You brute.</i>

1061
01:30:28,178 --> 01:30:31,238
<i>The cabbie saw me kissing you.</i>
<i>He said, ''Is she yours?''</i>

1062
01:30:31,314 --> 01:30:33,305
<i>I said, ''Yes, she's mine. ''</i>

1063
01:30:35,151 --> 01:30:36,641
She's mine.

1064
01:30:44,694 --> 01:30:49,597
So he came to the club, watched you strip,
you had a little chat, and that was it?

1065
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:53,061
Yes.

1066
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:59,605
You're not trusting me.

1067
01:31:00,443 --> 01:31:03,139
l'm in love with you. You're safe.

1068
01:31:04,013 --> 01:31:06,379
You had every right. l just want to know.

1069
01:31:06,449 --> 01:31:09,213
-Why?
-Because l want to know everything.

1070
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,551
Because l'm a lunatic.

1071
01:31:14,123 --> 01:31:15,385
Tell me.

1072
01:31:17,527 --> 01:31:19,358
Nothing happened.

1073
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:23,799
-You were living with someone else.
-What are you justifying?

1074
01:31:23,866 --> 01:31:25,697
l'm not justifying anything. Just saying.

1075
01:31:25,768 --> 01:31:27,895
-What are you saying?
-l'm not saying anything.

1076
01:31:27,971 --> 01:31:29,871
l just want the truth.

1077
01:31:31,241 --> 01:31:33,835
-Where are you going?
-Cigarettes.

1078
01:31:35,345 --> 01:31:36,710
Everywhere's closed.

1079
01:31:36,779 --> 01:31:39,441
l'll go to the terminal.

1080
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,979
When l get back...

1081
01:31:42,185 --> 01:31:44,153
please tell me the truth.

1082
01:31:46,356 --> 01:31:49,291
-Why?
-Because l'm addicted to it.

1083
01:31:49,726 --> 01:31:53,389
Because without it we're animals.

1084
01:31:54,731 --> 01:31:56,096
Trust me.

1085
01:33:02,665 --> 01:33:04,690
l don't love you anymore.

1086
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:06,798
Since when?

1087
01:33:06,869 --> 01:33:08,029
Now.

1088
01:33:08,838 --> 01:33:10,135
Just now.

1089
01:33:11,207 --> 01:33:13,107
l don't want to lie...

1090
01:33:13,776 --> 01:33:16,108
and l can't tell the truth...

1091
01:33:16,546 --> 01:33:17,979
so it's over.

1092
01:33:18,448 --> 01:33:20,109
lt doesn't matter.

1093
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:24,150
-l love you. None of it matters.
-Too late.

1094
01:33:26,622 --> 01:33:28,647
l don't love you anymore.

1095
01:33:30,226 --> 01:33:31,454
Goodbye.

1096
01:33:36,632 --> 01:33:38,463
Here's the truth...

1097
01:33:39,335 --> 01:33:41,394
so now you can hate me.

1098
01:33:43,806 --> 01:33:46,138
Larry fucked me all night.

1099
01:33:47,643 --> 01:33:49,270
l enjoyed it.

1100
01:33:50,313 --> 01:33:51,610
l came.

1101
01:33:54,984 --> 01:33:56,474
l prefer you.

1102
01:33:58,988 --> 01:34:00,285
Now go.

1103
01:34:03,192 --> 01:34:04,591
l knew that.

1104
01:34:05,528 --> 01:34:07,018
He told me.

1105
01:34:07,764 --> 01:34:10,756
-You knew?
-l needed to hear it from you.

1106
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,998
-Why?
-Because he might have been lying.

1107
01:34:14,337 --> 01:34:15,736
l had to hear it from you.

1108
01:34:15,805 --> 01:34:18,968
l would never have told you,
because l know you'd never forgive me.

1109
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:20,668
l would. l have.

1110
01:34:21,511 --> 01:34:24,002
-Why did he tell you?
-Because he's a bastard.

1111
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,480
-How could he?
-Because he wanted this to happen.

1112
01:34:26,549 --> 01:34:29,211
-But why test me?
-Because l'm an idiot.

1113
01:34:29,285 --> 01:34:30,411
Yes.

1114
01:34:31,387 --> 01:34:33,378
l would have loved you...

1115
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:35,789
forever.

1116
01:34:37,627 --> 01:34:40,255
-Now please go.
-Don't do this. Talk to me.

1117
01:34:40,329 --> 01:34:42,229
l am talking. Fuck off.

1118
01:34:42,298 --> 01:34:44,789
No, l'm sorry. You misunderstand.
l didn't mean to--

1119
01:34:44,867 --> 01:34:45,856
Yes, you did.

1120
01:34:45,935 --> 01:34:47,459
-l love you.
-Where?

1121
01:34:47,537 --> 01:34:49,266
-What?
-Show me.

1122
01:34:49,972 --> 01:34:51,667
Where is this love?

1123
01:34:52,475 --> 01:34:56,878
l can't see it. l can't touch it.
 l can't feel it.

1124
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,874
l can hear it. l can hear some words...

1125
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:03,942
but l can't do anything
with your easy words.

1126
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:06,888
Whatever you say, it's too late.

1127
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:10,016
-Please don't do this.
-lt's done.

1128
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:14,626
Now please go, or l'll call security.

1129
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:17,861
You're not in a strip club.
There is no security.

1130
01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:23,133
-Why did you fuck him?
-l wanted to.

1131
01:35:23,206 --> 01:35:24,696
-Why?
-l desired him.

1132
01:35:24,774 --> 01:35:26,765
-Why?
-You weren't there.

1133
01:35:26,943 --> 01:35:29,571
-Why him?
-He asked me nicely.

1134
01:35:29,645 --> 01:35:30,942
-You're a liar.
-So?

1135
01:35:31,013 --> 01:35:33,447
-Who are you?
-l'm no one.

1136
01:35:36,185 --> 01:35:39,518
Go on, hit me. That's what you want.
Hit me, fucker.

1137
01:37:00,736 --> 01:37:03,330
-Welcome back, Miss Jones.
-Thank you.
