your mom tells me,

to hang around her apartment.

33
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:46,108

just happy to not do anything?

34

to me that is a three.

I'm here to tell you,

it was too nerdy.

He wants us to be a family.

put on some pants.

Big time.

633
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,430

rattle off three. Go!

"Where?" "Over there." "Cool."

646

647
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,481
He actually is.

648
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,527
He's been studying meteorology
since pre-school.

649
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,323
Don't let the Dahmer
glasses fool you.

650
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:56,490
These don't have any mesh,
so you're going commando.

651
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,265
Watch sitting.
Your junk will fall out.

652
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,036
Found that out the hard way
at a birthday party.

653
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:04,971
And like that you're impressed.
And grossed out.

Bye.

655
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,508
Water Wizz Waterpark.
Built in the summer of '83,

656
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,675
it's the last bastion of everything
that time period stood for.

657
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,309
In fact, it was decreed
by its creator

658
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,115
that this place
shall never age.

659
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,314
On his deathbed, he said,

660
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,788
"I don't want this place
re-painted or updated.

661
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,846
"I don't even want
it brought up to code.

662
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,051
"And the minute someone tries,
it needs to be destroyed."

663
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,891
We actually have a nuclear
bomb forjust such an occasion.

664
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,487
Bought it off the Russians.

665
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,693
Really? Still good with all that?
Even the Russian thing?

666
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,497
That's Cold War.
It's kind of dated.

667
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,901
All right,
that was a waste of a bit.

668
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,064
Hey.

669
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:38,505
Some kid threw up
near Crazy Tubes.

670
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,976
What? Why is this the first I'm
hearing of this? Damn it, woman!

671
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,671
Caitlin, Duncan.
Tony, Mary Beth.

672
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,011
Hi, Duncan. Also, I need
you to reorder more mats.

673
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,072
Did it.

674
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:48,207
Finish the work schedule
for next week.

675
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,250
Did it.

676
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,546
Change all the filters.

677
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:51,586
Done.

678
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,485
You know, I'm going to check
all that stuff, right?

679
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,990
Then, in that case,
I didn't do any of that.

680
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,047
So, I'm doing it.

681
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:59,390
It's called delegation. I read
about it in a book about it.

682
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,825
That's the one
you wait for, my man.

683
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,154
Oh, yeah.

684
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,557
She looked back.
She likes me.

685
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,872
This is Devil's Peak. The largest
waterslide in a 50-mile radius.

686
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,276
Stretch out the tube, end to end.
13 football fields.

687
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,505
Don't Google that
for confirmation.

688
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,173
That fact
predates technology.

689
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,114
Owen,
settle a debate for us.

690
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:24,016
Hello, boys. Duncan, this is
Vladimir, Ishmael, and Ming Lee.

691
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,179
Those aren't our names!

692
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,278
Those are the names
I'm giving you, Vlady.

693
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,357
These are my illegitimate sons.
They all have different mothers.

694
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,858
I'm trying to be a positive
influence in their lives.

695
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,451
Take them to Little League, Boys
Club, raising pandas to fight.

696
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,893
Shut up, jackass!

697

698
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,461
Neil says that years ago
some kid figured out

699
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,865
how to pass someone on the water slide.
Is that true?

700
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,959
He did!

701
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,231
It's physically impossible,
Neil!

702
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,295
You can't catch up to
someone and pass them!

703
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,433
Actually, Ming Lee's right.
I was here when it happened.

704
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,239
All right,
then how'd he do it?

705
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,109
It happened inside the tube.
So, no one really knows.

706
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,579
Only the kid and
the person he passed.

707
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,777
And Jesus Christ, our lord. But,
he's a little hard to get a hold of.

708
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:56,944
He won't return my calls.

709
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,045
We wore the same shirt to a party
and it got a little weird.

710
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,249
Be serious!

711
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,756
Don't interrupt him, Neil!
He's talking!

712
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,227
Guys, what happens in the tube
stays in the tube.

713
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,321
That's just the law
of the park.

714
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,123
Bullshit. We'll just ask
the kid how he did it.

715
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,496
Be my guest
if you can find him.

716
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,126
Last I heard he went
into a deep depression.

717
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,397
The fame was too much.

718
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,906
He turned to cocaine
to escape the limelight.

719
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,169
And eventually,
a life of male prostitution.

720
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:22,609
0h, no. Wait. There he is. You got sober.
You look good.

721
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,668
Good for you!

722
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,838
Screw you, Owen!

723
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,176
Yeah, screw you, Owen.

724
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,648
I just said that, Neil!

725
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,184
I'm being supportive!

726
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:32,517
Actually, that crack-addled
male whore was me.

727
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,112
Really?

728
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,249
Wow!

729
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,024
Do you get comedy?

730
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,091
So, did he pass him by sliding
up the side of the tube?

731
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,655
I'm not telling you.

732
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,025
But I want to know!

733
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,603
That's a good thing.
Don't die wondering.

734
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:51,132
All right, Hot Rod,
what's happening?

735
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,976
Some kid threw up
near Crazy Tubes.

736
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:56,137
Wow!
Pointless news travels fast.

737
00:38:56,968 --> 00:39:01,314
Can I get a special ride "with
benefits" for my man, Duncan?

738
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,314
Yeah, hold on.

739
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,122
This slide's
out of order.

740
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,381
Watch this.

741
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,851
Yeah,
you gotta use the other one.

742
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,561
Actually, you know what? I think
it's back in order. Okay.

743
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,289
Come on, step up, please.

744
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,627
Okay. Hold on.

745
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,896

746
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,402
Hold.

747
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,802
This guy's an artist.
Watch and learn.

748
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,566
And you are holding.

749

Still holding.

00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,583
All right, I think we're all set
to hold a little bit longer.

751
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,822
Okay, step back a little bit.
Okay, step forward.

752
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,553
Okay, stay there.
Step back. And hold.

755

Just about ready to hold.

so he has to go
to the blue square.

1131

I don't think it matters.

1132
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:20,187
If it didn't matter, they wouldn't
put it in the directions.

1133
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:21,847
We can fudge the rule.

1134
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:26,820

then, I'm just going like that.

you know everything, but...

We do things.

We're leaving.
