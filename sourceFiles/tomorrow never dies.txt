1
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:15,756
Our man's in position
on the center camera.

2
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:17,930
It's like a terrorist supermarket.

3
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:22,363
Chinese Long March Scud,
Panther AS-565 attack helicopter...

4
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:25,560
...a pair of Russian mortars, and
the crates look like American rifles.

5
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:30,397
Chilean mines, German explosives.
Fun for the whole family.

6
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:32,709
IDs.

7
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,344
White Rook to White Knight.
Show us the pawns.

8
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:39,140
You see, he did get through, admiral.
Start with that chap in the middle.

9
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,407
Load the ID program, please.

10
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,414
Database ID search.

11
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,416
Checking the databases.

12
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,454
We've got our first match.
Satoshi Isagura.

13
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:51,147
Chemical expert.
Wanted for the Tokyo subway attack.

14
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:54,725
Currently working for
the insurgent force in Zaire.

15
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,420
Henry Gupta. American.

16
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:01,260
Practically invented
techno-terrorism.

17
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:04,164
Started out as a student radical
at Berkeley in the '60s.

18
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:06,166
Now he sells his politics for cash.

19
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:09,636
- Zoom in on that, can you?
- That looks like an American encoder.

20
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:12,969
They use it to control navigation
satellites: The GPS system.

21
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,814
Will the CIA be more upset
that they lost it or that we found it?

22
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,778
Excuse me. Admiral?

23
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:24,614
Thank you, M, we've seen enough.
This is now a military operation.

24
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:26,516
You saw the Gatling gun?

25
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:29,020
Are your troops prepared
for that kind of firepower?

26
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:32,354
We have election
in Moscow next week.

27
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:36,464
The president said any loss
of life is unacceptable.

28
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:37,962
We'll take the naval option.

29
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,192
In one strike, we take out
half the world's terrorists.

30
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:44,801
- Admiral Roebuck, I must protest.
- Get me the <i>Chester,</i>

31
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:47,405
- Let's not waste time.
- My man isn't finished.

32
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:50,906
Black King to White Bishop.
Authorization to fire.

33
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:54,541
Get your man out of there.
His job is over.

34
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:57,945
<i>Weapons authorized,</i>
<i>Prepare to fire,</i>

35
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:04,777
On my count.
Five, four, three, two, one.

36
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,217
Missile away.

37
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,953
Time to target:
Four minutes, eight seconds.

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,794
White Knight, four minutes to impact.
Get out of there.

39
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,562
Yes, damn it, I know what it is.
It's on the screen in front of me.

40
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,362
It's a jeep in front of a plane.

41
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:25,472
Now, get the hell out of there!

42
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:28,164
- What the hell's going on?
- You will not wait!

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,935
- That's an order!
- What is your man waiting for?

44
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,977
White Knight? Oh, my God!

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,445
Those are Soviet SB-5
nuclear torpedoes.

46
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,583
- lf the cruise hits them...
- Order them to abort the missile.

47
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:45,687
- <i>H, M, S, Chester,</i> urgent.
- White Knight, come in.

48
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,950
Abort missile. Abort missile.

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,094
- Abort missile.
- Abort missile.

50
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:55,964
Captain, sir, missile out of range.

51
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,758
<i>Unable to destroy,</i>

52
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:05,767
- White Knight...
- Alert NATO, the Pentagon.

53
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:08,475
- Will it trigger the torpedoes?
- It might.

54
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:11,668
But even if it does not,
there's enough plutonium...

55
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:14,279
...to make Chernobyl
look like picnic.

56
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:17,575
Bloody hell. Can't you people
keep anything locked up?

57
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:20,343
Evacuate your troops,
and get him out of there, now.

58
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:23,613
White Knight, come in.
White Knight, come in.

59
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:26,225
- Keep trying, damn it.
- White Knight, come in.

60
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:32,525
Repeat, White Knight, come in.

61
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,005
Filthy habit.

62
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:01,017
I've got the encoder.

63
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:11,626
- What the hell is he doing?
- His job.

64
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,164
He's going for the bombs.

65
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:37,979
Get that jeep!

66
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:49,623
Get out of it, James.

67
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,719
One minute to impact.

68
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,500
Thirty seconds to impact.

69
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,997
Back-seat driver.

70
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,835
White Knight to White Rook.

71
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,164
<i>I've evacuated the area,</i>

72
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,036
<i>Ask the admiral where</i>
<i>he'd like his bombs delivered,</i>

73
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,772
Sound the general alarm.

74
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:47,714
<i>The ship has been overflown</i>
<i>by two Chinese MiGs,</i>

75
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:50,716
We believe they have hostile intent.

76
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:53,514
<i>Hands to action stations,</i>

77
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:10,864
Officer of the watch, maximum speed.
Come left 40 degrees.

78
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:14,838
Aye, aye, sir.
Revolutions 1-6-0, port 20.

79
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,532
Are they insane?

80
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:23,709
The Chinese pilot insists that
we are only 11 miles off their coast...

81
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,248
...and he will fire if we don't
turn around and go to a Chinese port.

82
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:30,047
Send this:
"We are in international waters...

83
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:32,052
...and will defend ourselves
if attacked.

84
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:33,951
Copy all this
to the Admiralty, urgent.

85
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:38,695
Are we absolutely sure
of our position?

86
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:42,865
Yes, sir. An exact satellite fix.

87
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:18,226
Captain, we are ready to launch.

88
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:20,364
Shut down the engines.

89
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:22,191
Maintain full silence.

90
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:26,097
A stealth ship may be invisible
to radar but the sea drill isn't.

91
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:33,535
We'll launch next time
the MiGs fly by...

92
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:36,734
...and the British will think
it's a Chinese aerial torpedo.

93
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,936
I should report in.

94
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:47,282
<i>Stamper to Hamburg,</i>
<i>Phase one is in progress,</i>

95
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:50,116
<i>I'll report back to you</i>
<i>with an update,</i>

96
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,163
- The MiGs are making another pass.
- Let's start the show.

97
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,161
Sea drill in position.

98
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:15,774
Start the drill.

99
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:26,482
- Release it.
- Sea drill away.

100
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:35,022
Green 3-0,
torpedo, torpedo, torpedo.

101
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:37,095
Green 3-0, center bearing 1-1-4.

102
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:39,424
Officer of the Watch,
come hard right, 1-4-1.

103
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,123
There's been no sonar contact, sir.
The MiGs must have dropped it.

104
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,298
Bearing steady. It's gonna hit, sir.

105
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:50,337
Brace, brace, brace.

106
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:00,806
- Target: 1200.
- Knock, knock.

107
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:19,498
Let's go upstairs.

108
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,234
- Turn left.
- Rotating 90 degrees.

109
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,850
Now they're wondering why
the torpedo hasn't exploded.

110
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:51,218
PWO, captain.
Full damage report.

111
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:57,863
Backup power, immediately!

112
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:01,830
Switch to alternate supply.

113
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:05,436
Three generators are down, sir.
Flooding on four deck aft.

114
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:08,540
Sir, we're now down
14 degrees by the stern.

115
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,107
Yeoman, send to Admiralty:

116
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:13,006
"Have been torpedoed by
Chinese MiGs. Sinking."

117
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:17,347
Give them our position.
Right. Abandon ship.

118
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,940
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

119
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,684
Everyone on deck! Come on!

120
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,564
One missile at the MiGs.

121
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,279
Maintaining radio silence.

122
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:04,455
Their last broadcast, sir.

123
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:08,987
Mr. Gupta's little trick
with the encoder worked.

124
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:12,286
They gave their final position
70 miles from here.

125
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:14,726
The British Navy
will never find them.

126
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,132
Survivors in the water.

127
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:38,615
Mr. Stamper,
I'm having fun with my headlines.

128
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,514
I need to know
the exact number of survivors.

129
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,417
Now, I'm late for a meeting. Make sure
you use the right kind of ammunition.

130
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,091
<i>Yes, sir,</i>

131
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,757
Delicious.

132
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,813
Start the recovery operation.

133
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:24,115
Send our divers
down to the <i>Devonshire,</i>

134
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:50,337
<i>Mr, Gupta? Phase one is complete,</i>

135
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:04,414
Good morning, my golden retrievers.

136
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:08,822
What kind of havoc shall the Carver
Media Group create in the world today?

137
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:12,054
- News.
- <i>Floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris,</i>

138
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,392
- <i>And a plane crash in California,</i>
- Excellent.

139
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:19,500
Mr. Jones, are we ready
to release our new software?

140
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:22,930
<i>Yes, sir,</i>
<i>As requested, it's full of bugs,,,</i>

141
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:25,506
<i>,,, which means people will be</i>
<i>forced to upgrade for years,</i>

142
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:26,802
Outstanding.

143
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:30,044
Mr. Wallace, call the president.

144
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:33,443
Tell him if he doesn't sign the bill
lowering the cable rates...

145
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,550
...we'll release a video of him
with the cheerleader...

146
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:38,549
...in the Chicago motel room.
- <i>Inspired, sir,</i>

147
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:41,086
After he signs the bill,
release the tape anyway.

148
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:42,746
<i>Consider him slimed,</i>

149
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:45,252
Excuse me.

150
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,685
- He's on transponder seven.
- Mr. Stamper?

151
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:54,030
<i>Phase two is underway,</i>
<i>I have the videotape,</i>

152
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:58,067
<i>I haven't seen it myself,</i>
<i>but I'm told the footage is excellent,</i>

153
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,206
<i>Plus, there were 17 survivors</i>
<i>for your headlines,</i>

154
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:03,772
Good work, Stamper.

155
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:07,942
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

156
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,906
Make sure you keep it
in a safe place.

157
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:14,107
Gentlemen and ladies...

158
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,709
...hold the presses.

159
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,750
This just in.

160
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:23,286
By a curious quirk of fate,
we have the perfect story...

161
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:26,985
...with which to launch our
Satellite News Network tonight.

162
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:32,495
It seems a small crisis is brewing
in the South China Seas.

163
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:36,227
I want full newspaper coverage.
I want magazine stories.

164
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:40,133
I want books. I want films.
I want TV. I want radio.

165
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:43,069
I want us on the air
24 hours a day.

166
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:45,107
This is our moment!

167
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:49,012
And a billion people
around this planet...

168
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:51,647
...will watch it, hear it...

169
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:56,286
...and read about it
from the Carver Media Group.

170
00:21:58,022 --> 00:22:01,980
There's no news like bad news.

171
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,819
How do you say
"I'm not here" in Danish?

172
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,495
Just ignore it.

173
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:49,722
Those are words they just
don't have in their vocabulary.

174
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:55,528
- Bond here.
- <i>Go to a secure line, 007,</i>

175
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:59,138
Going to scrambler, channel four.

176
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:02,575
That's ridiculous.
That ship was in international waters.

177
00:23:02,743 --> 00:23:07,008
- We can't be certain.
- James? Where are you?

178
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:09,045
Oh, Moneypenny.

179
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:15,017
I'm just up here at Oxford
brushing up on a little Danish.

180
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,415
Little?

181
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:18,682
<i>I'm afraid you're gonna have to</i>
<i>kiss off your lesson,</i>

182
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,347
We've got a situation here
at the Ministry of Defense.

183
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,460
We're sending the fleet to China.

184
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:28,520
I'll be there in an hour.

185
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,222
Make that 30 minutes.

186
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:37,732
You always were
a cunning linguist, James.

187
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:42,972
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

188
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:58,913
That's preposterous. We know exactly
where that ship was positioned.

189
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:02,356
The GPS system... Global
Positioning Satellites do not lie.

190
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:06,258
Yes, but our Singapore station
picked up a mysterious signal...

191
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:08,796
...on the GPS frequency
at the time of the attack.

192
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,558
It could've sent that ship
off course.

193
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:13,601
- I have a missing British frigate...
- I'm aware of that!

194
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:16,068
And instead of decisive action,
all you wanna do is investigate.

195
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:18,469
My goal is to prevent World War III,
admiral, and I don't think...

196
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:21,611
...sending an armada into the recovery
area is the best way to do it.

197
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:24,940
Where, exactly, did this mysterious
GPS signal come from?

198
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,945
- We're still investigating.
- "Investigating."

199
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,710
M, sometimes I don't think
you have the balls for this job.

200
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:34,111
Perhaps, but the advantage is...

201
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:36,381
...I don't have to think
with them all the time.

202
00:24:37,457 --> 00:24:40,153
That's enough.
Now, where do we stand?

203
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:45,388
It was an unprovoked attack
on a ship in international waters.

204
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:49,055
We send in the fleet for recovery
and prepare for full retaliation.

205
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:51,497
Moderation. We investigate...

206
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,797
...and stop short of sending
the entire British Navy...

207
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:56,098
...within 10 minutes
of the world's largest air force.

208
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:59,242
- When will our ships be in position?
- Forty-eight hours.

209
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:01,411
Christ!

210
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,442
The press are already
screaming for blood.

211
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:06,480
The last thing we want to do
is escalate the situation.

212
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:09,674
I'm afraid it may be too late
to worry about that.

213
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:14,445
Seventeen British sailors murdered!

214
00:25:15,424 --> 00:25:18,085
"According to Vietnamese officials
who recovered the bodies...

215
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,857
...the victims were riddled
with the same ammunition...

216
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,427
...used by the Chinese Air Force.
- Did you leak this?

217
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:25,859
No.

218
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:29,667
- It's the first I've heard of it.
- Well, this settles it.

219
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,104
We send in the fleet.

220
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:36,570
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.

221
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:46,782
There is one strange thing.

222
00:25:46,983 --> 00:25:49,451
When I called our contact
in Saigon, he said the Vietnamese...

223
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:51,609
...only found our sailors
three hours ago.

224
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:53,482
How'd they get the paper out
so fast?

225
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:57,187
Somebody at <i>Tomorrow</i> knew before
the Vietnamese government did.

226
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,022
How much do you know
about Elliot Carver, 007?

227
00:26:01,196 --> 00:26:02,527
Worldwide media baron.

228
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:05,324
Able to topple governments
with a single broadcast.

229
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:08,133
Carver owns
that newspaper <i>Tomorrow,</i>

230
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,398
I didn't want to discuss it
in front of the minister...

231
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:13,470
...but that mysterious signal came
from one of Carver's satellites.

232
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:18,532
The PM would have my head
if he knew you were investigating him.

233
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,577
I'm sending you to Hamburg, 007.
We've arranged for your invitation...

234
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,738
...to a party
at Carver's Media center.

235
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,308
They're celebrating the launch
of a new satellite...

236
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,976
...because now he has the ability
to reach every human on the Earth.

237
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:33,212
Except the Chinese,
who have refused broadcast rights.

238
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:39,254
James, your ticket, cover story
and rental car reservation.

239
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:41,020
Sign here, please.

240
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:44,862
I believe you once had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.

241
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:48,063
That was a long time ago, M...

242
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:50,169
...before she was married.

243
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:54,538
I didn't realize
it was public knowledge.

244
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,073
Queen and country, James.

245
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:59,610
Your job is to find out whether Carver
or someone in his organization...

246
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:01,770
...sent that ship off course
and why.

247
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:04,879
Use your relationship
with Mrs. Carver if necessary.

248
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:07,210
I doubt if she'll remember me.

249
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:09,181
Remind her.

250
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:12,754
Then pump her for information.

251
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:17,226
You'll just have to decide
how much pumping is needed, James.

252
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:20,659
If only that were true
of you and I, Moneypenny.

253
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,256
If you'll just sign here, Mr. Bond.

254
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:07,931
It's the insurance damage waiver...

255
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:10,970
...for your beautiful new car.

256
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:14,664
- Will you need collision coverage?
- Yes.

257
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:16,208
Fire?

258
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:18,478
Probably.

259
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:21,272
- Property destruction?
- Definitely.

260
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:23,006
Personal injury?

261
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,445
I hope not, but accidents do happen.

262
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:27,642
They frequently do with you.

263
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:33,286
Well, that takes care
of the normal wear and tear.

264
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:34,948
Do I need any other protection?

265
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:40,231
Only from me, 007, unless you bring
that car back in pristine order.

266
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:42,622
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

267
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,633
Your new BMW 750.

268
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:52,274
All the usual refinements.
Machine guns, rockets...

269
00:28:52,442 --> 00:28:54,807
...the GPS tracking system.

270
00:28:55,944 --> 00:29:00,278
<i>Welcome, Please fasten seat belt and</i>
<i>obey all instructions for a safe trip,</i>

271
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:03,178
I thought you'd pay more attention
to a female voice.

272
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:06,449
- I think we've met.
- I am not interested...

273
00:29:06,654 --> 00:29:08,518
...in your sordid escapades.

274
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:10,553
Let's get on with it, shall we?

275
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:12,486
Your new telephone.

276
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:15,322
Talk here, listen here.

277
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:17,888
So that's what I've been
doing wrong all these years.

278
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:22,997
It also includes
a fingerprint scanner...

279
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:25,999
...and a 20,000-volt
security system.

280
00:29:26,204 --> 00:29:29,036
And this I'm particularly proud of:

281
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:32,034
The remote control for your car.

282
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,801
Tap twice.

283
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:35,535
One, two.

284
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,309
Now, draw your finger...

285
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:41,983
...very slowly across the pad...

286
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:45,046
...to drive the car.

287
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,426
It's surprisingly difficult to drive,
but with practice...

288
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:57,027
Well, let's see how she responds
to my touch, eh, Q?

289
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:23,549
I think we understand each other.

290
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:26,186
Grow up, 007.

291
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:46,102
<i>Attention, Engine running,</i>
<i>Please shut door now,</i>

292
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:02,916
Anyway, there's absolutely no truth
in this malicious rumor...

293
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,553
...that I started running
Mad Cow Disease stories...

294
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:09,452
...simply because Sir Angus Black,
the great British beef baron...

295
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,219
...lost 10,000 pounds to me in a game
of poker and refused to pay up.

296
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,988
Moreover, there's even
less truth in the rumor...

297
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:19,064
...that I took 100 million francs
from the French...

298
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:21,394
...to keep the stories running
for another year.

299
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:24,164
- Excuse me, Mr. Carver.
- Yes.

300
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:27,134
This is the new banker, Mr?

301
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:30,140
Bond. James Bond.

302
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,273
Another new banker.
I seem to collect them.

303
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:36,474
Tell me, Mr. Bond...

304
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:39,081
...how's the market reacting
to the crisis?

305
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:42,252
Well, currencies are off.
Your stock is soaring.

306
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:45,588
I don't believe we have met.

307
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,651
- Elliot Carver.
- Wai Lin.

308
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,952
I'm from the
New China News Agency.

309
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,151
I don't recall seeing your name
on the guest list.

310
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,819
I have a confession.

311
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:58,296
It's not. I snuck in.

312
00:31:58,768 --> 00:32:00,894
Why would you do that, my dear?

313
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:02,933
I wanted to meet you.

314
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:04,795
Outstanding.

315
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:07,873
I admire a woman
who takes the initiative.

316
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,907
You should work in
my Beijing bureau.

317
00:32:10,077 --> 00:32:11,442
Mr. Carver.

318
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:15,314
- You don't have a bureau in Beijing.
- Call me Elliot.

319
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:29,781
I always wondered how I'd feel
if I ever saw you again.

320
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:41,126
Now I know.

321
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,837
Was it something I said?

322
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:47,133
How about the words
"I'll be right back"?

323
00:32:49,577 --> 00:32:52,944
- Something came up.
- Something always came up.

324
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:57,014
- And how are you, Paris?
- Much better now. We're even.

325
00:32:57,217 --> 00:32:58,844
Something to drink, Mrs. Carver?

326
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,977
Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini,
shaken not stirred.

327
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,352
Mrs. Carver will have a tequila,
straight shot.

328
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:11,489
No, Mrs. Carver will have a glass
of Mr. Carver's champagne.

329
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:14,888
I see you've moved up
in the world, Paris.

330
00:33:15,065 --> 00:33:18,501
And tonight, you're a banker.
I saw the guest list.

331
00:33:19,536 --> 00:33:22,561
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

332
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:37,607
- To you.
- No, to the gun.

333
00:33:43,623 --> 00:33:46,387
So I take it this isn't a social visit?

334
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,492
Your husband may be in trouble.

335
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,924
The emperor of the air.

336
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:53,564
If you think you're going after him,
you're the one who's in trouble.

337
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:57,428
Perhaps, but it's either him
or someone in his organization.

338
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,799
I see. And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.

339
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,734
No. That wasn't my plan.

340
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:06,205
Good. Because if it
comes to a choice...

341
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:08,640
...between you and Elliot,
I've made my bed.

342
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:11,143
You don't sleep in it anymore.

343
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:12,712
There you are.

344
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:16,706
Darling.

345
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:21,282
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

346
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:24,748
I want you to meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.

347
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:27,590
- Hello, Mrs. Carver.
- It's a pleasure.

348
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:30,122
And this is James Bond.

349
00:34:30,463 --> 00:34:32,795
I didn't realize you knew each other.

350
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:35,262
- We're old friends.
- Casual acquaintances.

351
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:37,663
He dated my roommate in Zurich.

352
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:42,567
I'm thinking of getting Wai Lin
behind a news desk.

353
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:45,071
That's wonderful.
I'm sure she won't resist...

354
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:47,735
...too much.

355
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:52,080
Tell me, Elliot, I was just
wondering about your satellites...

356
00:34:52,248 --> 00:34:54,580
...the way you've positioned
yourself globally.

357
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:57,685
They're merely tools
for information, Mr. Bond.

358
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,353
Or disinformation.

359
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:03,815
Say, if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments or people.

360
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:05,850
Or even a ship.

361
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:10,796
That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.

362
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:14,558
You have a vivid imagination
for a banker.

363
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:17,099
Perhaps I should commission you
to write a novel.

364
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:21,103
Oh, heavens, no.
I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.

365
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:24,937
Mr. Carver?

366
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:31,808
It's time to begin the festivities.

367
00:35:31,982 --> 00:35:33,347
Excuse me. Darling?

368
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:40,482
So how do you really know him?

369
00:35:40,656 --> 00:35:43,489
I told you, he's a banker.
I met him in Zurich.

370
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,956
You're a terrible liar, dear.

371
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,860
I have a problem with a banker.

372
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:54,023
Could I see you a moment?

373
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:57,635
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:04,699
Mr. Carver's broadcast will begin
in 10 minutes in the main studio.

375
00:36:06,378 --> 00:36:10,246
Exactly what kind of banking
do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?

376
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:15,318
Hostile takeovers. Shall we?

377
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:28,194
Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.

378
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:30,696
It's nice to talk to the world.

379
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,067
Looks like there's someone
who wants to talk to you.

380
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:41,238
Mr. Bond, you have
an urgent phone call.

381
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:50,015
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in five...

382
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,650
...four, three, two...

383
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:56,650
Good evening.

384
00:36:56,855 --> 00:37:00,415
Tonight's broadcast was supposed
to be a celebration...

385
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:04,253
...marking the completion of
the Carver Global Satellite Network.

386
00:37:04,461 --> 00:37:06,894
But, as you're well aware...

387
00:37:07,063 --> 00:37:10,055
...a terrible conflict looms tonight
in the South China Sea...

388
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:11,791
...which, unchecked...

389
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:17,597
...has the potential to destroy
every human being on Earth.

390
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:21,263
- <i>I want to assure my viewers that I,,,</i>
- This way, please.

391
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:24,740
<i>,,, Elliot Carver, have spoken</i>
<i>with the prime minister in London,,,</i>

392
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,742
<i>,,, and the chairman in Beijing,,,</i>

393
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:29,438
<i>,,, and have offered my services</i>
<i>as an impartial...</i>

394
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,945
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond.
Nobody hears you scream.

395
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:44,217
<i>Herr</i> Stamper,
we have made contact.

396
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,829
Make him uncomfortable.

397
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,192
I'll be there in a few moments.

398
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:52,630
- with its printing presses
that run 24 hours a day...

399
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,930
...and its satellite facilities
linking every last...

400
00:38:00,076 --> 00:38:03,067
You seem very concerned
about Mr. Carver's business.

401
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:07,576
He wants to know why.

402
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:10,249
<i>Why did I do it, you ask,</i>

403
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:13,318
<i>The answer is simple: power,</i>

404
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:17,245
<i>The power to illuminate</i>
<i>the far corners of the globe,</i>

405
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:19,220
<i>Not for higher profits,,,</i>

406
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:23,758
...but for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet.

407
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:26,590
Put him in the chair. Maybe we play
a little number on his head.

408
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:36,365
<i>And what do I expect in return?</i>

409
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,131
Worldwide domination.

410
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:43,368
<i>Complete, utter, total</i>
<i>worldwide domination,</i>

411
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,672
<i>But not over governments or ideology,</i>

412
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:51,318
<i>Over tyranny and isolation</i>
<i>and ignorance,</i>

413
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:55,488
<i>The Carver Media Group Network</i>
<i>has the ability,,,</i>

414
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:59,648
<i>,,, to reach every person</i>
<i>in every village in every nation,</i>

415
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,760
<i>But do not fear me,,,</i>

416
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:04,361
<i>,,, for tonight I offer you</i>
<i>my declaration of principles:</i>

417
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:07,697
<i>A promise to the men and women</i>
<i>of this planet,,,</i>

418
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,202
<i>,,, my brothers and sisters</i>
<i>whom I so humbly serve,</i>

419
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:16,465
<i>I promise to report the news</i>
<i>without fear or favor,</i>

420
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:20,040
<i>I promise to be a force</i>
<i>for good in this world,</i>

421
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:23,712
<i>Fighting injustice,</i>
<i>crushing intolerance,,,</i>

422
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:25,039
<i>,,, battling inhumanity,</i>

423
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:29,149
- <i>Striking a blow for freedom,</i>
- It's time for...

424
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:32,086
...a station break.

425
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,489
- What's happening?
- We've lost power.

426
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:39,716
- We're off the air.
- What?!

427
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:50,666
Ladies and gentlemen, stay calm.
There's no need to go for the exit.

428
00:39:50,836 --> 00:39:53,066
We will go on in a few minutes' time.

429
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:56,706
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're fired! Get out of my sight!

430
00:40:43,115 --> 00:40:45,605
<i>And, in a rather embarrassing note,,,</i>

431
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:49,377
<i>,,, scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver</i>
<i>was cut off the air tonight,,,</i>

432
00:40:49,587 --> 00:40:51,952
<i>,,, in mid-speech during</i>
<i>the inaugural broadcast,,,</i>

433
00:40:52,122 --> 00:40:54,852
<i>,,, of his Worldwide Satellite Network,</i>

434
00:40:55,058 --> 00:40:57,549
<i>Sorry, Elliot,</i>
<i>but we didn't do it,</i>

435
00:40:59,795 --> 00:41:02,229
Glorious evening, wasn't it?

436
00:41:02,431 --> 00:41:04,558
Come on, Elliot.
Ignore those people.

437
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:07,290
- Sometimes these things happen.
- Not to me.

438
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:09,726
Not to me!

439
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:23,310
When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

440
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:28,815
It was a rag, but the editor
taught me one important lesson.

441
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:32,445
The key to a great story
is not who...

442
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,091
...or what or when...

443
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,927
...but why.

444
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:43,428
Your friend, Mr. Bond,
made a mess tonight.

445
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:48,592
- I want to know why.
- I told you, I barely know him.

446
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,106
Barely?

447
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:22,693
I was curious
who Carver would send.

448
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:25,325
He's on to you.

449
00:42:26,736 --> 00:42:29,863
Well, we know where you stand.

450
00:42:30,873 --> 00:42:32,704
You made your bed.

451
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:36,977
I'm standing in your doorway.

452
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:42,345
Then turn around and go home.

453
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:46,578
You can tell him you didn't
get anything out of me.

454
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:52,389
That's it? Go home?

455
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:56,755
I didn't ask you
to get involved in this.

456
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:59,225
It's too late for that.

457
00:43:07,705 --> 00:43:09,535
Why did you marry him?

458
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,535
He told me he loved me.

459
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:15,069
That always sounds good.

460
00:43:16,545 --> 00:43:20,413
Do you know I used to look in
the papers for your obituary?

461
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,416
Well, I'm sorry
I keep disappointing you.

462
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:32,752
What was it, James?

463
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:38,761
Did I get too close?

464
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:45,903
Did I get too close for comfort?

465
00:43:58,247 --> 00:43:59,646
Yes.

466
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,323
I missed you.

467
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,624
What did you find?

468
00:44:57,798 --> 00:44:59,663
I hacked into the mainframe
at the bank.

469
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:02,267
They're using
an SSL2 encryption, 128...

470
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:05,461
Spare me the technobabble, please.

471
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:08,129
Bond's got a perfect
employment record. Ten years.

472
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:10,673
He's crossed every T,
he's dotted every I.

473
00:45:10,843 --> 00:45:12,867
- Which means?
- Government agent.

474
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,945
I call it
Gupta's Law of Creative Anomalies.

475
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:19,309
If it sounds too good to be true,
it always is.

476
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,643
Do you think my wife knows?

477
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:29,317
There's a lot of garbage, but
if you dial down the ambient noise...

478
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:34,728
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep</i>
<i>with a gun under your pillow?</i>

479
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:38,159
Play it again.

480
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:42,666
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep</i>
<i>with a gun under your pillow?</i>

481
00:45:44,672 --> 00:45:48,198
I think we should set an appointment
for my wife with the doctor.

482
00:45:55,614 --> 00:45:59,344
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep</i>
<i>with a gun under your pillow?</i>

483
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:09,352
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.

484
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,050
I can get you out of the country
in four hours.

485
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:13,627
I have no choice.

486
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,128
No one can protect me
from him, not even you.

487
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:21,029
- You do have a choice.
- Only if you let him go.

488
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,136
I can't do that.

489
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,539
He has a secret lab on the top floor
even I'm not supposed to know about.

490
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,541
There's an emergency hatch
on the roof.

491
00:46:31,712 --> 00:46:33,838
- You don't have to do this.
- It's the easiest way to get in.

492
00:46:34,046 --> 00:46:35,843
Don't argue with me, James.

493
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:39,783
You know...

494
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:43,187
...this job of yours...

495
00:46:46,057 --> 00:46:48,889
...it's murder on relationships.

496
00:48:09,228 --> 00:48:11,662
Until I get back next week,
I want two guards...

497
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,492
...outside this office
24 hours a day.

498
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:16,666
Nobody gets in. Got it?

499
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:18,631
We'll take care of it.

500
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:23,864
What do we do with the satellite?

501
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:28,773
Send this thing to the launch site.
And be careful.

502
00:48:28,978 --> 00:48:33,039
It's worth $300 million. You break it,
you bought it. Understand?

503
00:48:33,282 --> 00:48:35,749
I hate traveling.
I never know what to pack.

504
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:17,571
Looking for a news story?

505
00:52:27,015 --> 00:52:29,574
They'll print anything these days.

506
00:53:32,604 --> 00:53:33,935
Yes?

507
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:37,938
<i>Good morning, Mr, Bond,</i>
<i>Elliot Carver,</i>

508
00:53:38,142 --> 00:53:41,305
<i>I believe you've got</i>
<i>two items that belong to me,</i>

509
00:53:41,545 --> 00:53:43,409
What are you talking about?

510
00:53:43,613 --> 00:53:46,446
<i>The red box, Mr, Bond,,,</i>

511
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:49,584
<i>,,, and my wife in your hotel room,</i>

512
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:03,724
He's coming.

513
00:54:09,135 --> 00:54:11,068
<i>Fingerprint ID accepted,</i>

514
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:20,611
<i>Please select security system level,</i>

515
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:46,125
Tell me if you find the encoder.

516
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:48,767
- <i>Call me immediately,</i>
- <i>Yeah,</i>

517
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:03,704
<i>And in breaking news,,,</i>

518
00:55:03,948 --> 00:55:08,680
<i>,,, it is with great sadness that we</i>
<i>announce the death of Paris Carver,,,</i>

519
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:11,820
<i>,,, who has become an international</i>
<i>figure since she became the wife,,,</i>

520
00:55:11,988 --> 00:55:15,151
<i>,,, of Elliot Carver,</i>
<i>chairman of this network,</i>

521
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:18,157
<i>According to police officials</i>
<i>in Hamburg, Germany,,,</i>

522
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:20,794
<i>,,, Mrs, Carver was found dead</i>
<i>this morning,,,</i>

523
00:55:20,962 --> 00:55:24,693
<i>,,, in a hotel suite in that city</i>
<i>in unusual circumstances,,,</i>

524
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,363
<i>,,, on which police</i>
<i>have refused to elaborate,</i>

525
00:55:27,801 --> 00:55:30,395
<i>A coroner has been called for</i>
<i>and is expected to deliver,,,</i>

526
00:55:30,604 --> 00:55:33,868
<i>,,, his full report within</i>
<i>the next three days,</i>

527
00:55:34,073 --> 00:55:37,668
<i>Her body was discovered along with</i>
<i>the body of an unidentified man,,,</i>

528
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:40,902
<i>,,, who appeared to be the victim</i>
<i>of a self-inflicted gun wound,</i>

529
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:43,274
<i>Reached aboard his private jet</i>
<i>en route...</i>

530
00:55:43,482 --> 00:55:46,382
I have a clear shot at your head,
Mr. Bond.

531
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,153
Stand up, slowly.

532
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:52,948
Drop your gun and
kick it toward me, <i>ja?</i>

533
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,085
<i>At present, police</i>
<i>have refused to speculate,,,</i>

534
00:55:56,259 --> 00:55:57,817
<i>,,, on a motive in this</i>
<i>murder-suicide,</i>

535
00:55:58,061 --> 00:55:59,755
Good. Now...

536
00:55:59,962 --> 00:56:02,487
...lie down on the bed
next to Mrs. Carver.

537
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:06,391
<i>We extend our deepest sympathies</i>
<i>to Mr, Carver,</i>

538
00:56:08,736 --> 00:56:11,068
This story will be
on the news in an hour.

539
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:15,264
- Tomorrow's news today.
- Just so.

540
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:24,409
My name is Dr. Kaufman.

541
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:27,851
I am an outstanding
pistol marksman.

542
00:56:28,086 --> 00:56:30,111
Take my word for it, <i>ja?</i>

543
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,192
Get the sledgehammers.

544
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:52,304
She struggled terribly, Mr. Bond.

545
00:56:52,774 --> 00:56:55,799
It's a pity you got her
involved in all this.

546
00:56:58,612 --> 00:57:01,205
It won't look like a suicide
if you shoot me from over there.

547
00:57:01,414 --> 00:57:03,974
I am a professor
of forensic medicine.

548
00:57:04,217 --> 00:57:06,651
Believe me, Mr. Bond,
I could shoot you from Stuttgart...

549
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,287
...and still create the proper effect.

550
00:57:17,462 --> 00:57:20,363
My art is in great demand,
Mr. Bond.

551
00:57:20,531 --> 00:57:22,361
I go all over the world.

552
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,929
I am especially good
at the celebrity overdose.

553
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:31,770
But now, I'm afraid, Mr. Bond,
that our little...

554
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:36,667
Stamper! Stop yelling in my ear, <i>ja?</i>

555
00:57:36,878 --> 00:57:39,244
Sir, they can't get into the car.

556
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:41,804
You can't be serious.

557
00:57:42,616 --> 00:57:45,551
- Did you call the Auto Club?
- <i>Do you wanna call them?</i>

558
00:57:45,752 --> 00:57:47,617
<i>Make him tell you how to open it,</i>

559
00:57:47,788 --> 00:57:49,652
Okay, I ask.

560
00:57:51,557 --> 00:57:53,491
This is very embarrassing.

561
00:57:53,693 --> 00:57:55,785
It seems there is
a red box in your car.

562
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:57,723
They can't get to it.

563
00:57:57,896 --> 00:58:01,764
They want me
to make you unlock the car.

564
00:58:01,967 --> 00:58:04,628
I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to say.

565
00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:09,496
I am to torture you
if you don't do it.

566
00:58:09,705 --> 00:58:12,833
- You have a doctorate in that too?
- No, no, no.

567
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:16,737
This is more like a hobby.
But I'm very gifted.

568
00:58:17,445 --> 00:58:19,242
Oh, I believe you.

569
00:58:20,181 --> 00:58:22,046
- My cell phone opens the car.
- No, Mr. Bond.

570
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,139
I do it, <i>ja?</i>

571
00:58:28,855 --> 00:58:31,482
Recall, three, send.

572
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:43,824
Wait.

573
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,764
I'm just a professional doing a job.

574
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:49,161
Me too.

575
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:19,421
Dr. Kaufman.

576
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:53,556
<i>Welcome, Please fasten seat belt,</i>

577
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:03,133
<i>Reduce speed,</i>
<i>Pedestrians in roadway,</i>

578
01:01:09,024 --> 01:01:10,116
<i>Driver alert,</i>

579
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,522
<i>Obstruction ahead,</i>
<i>Reduce speed now,</i>

580
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:37,554
<i>Reminder:</i>
<i>Unsafe driving will void warranty,</i>

581
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:25,133
<i>Congratulations on a safe journey,</i>

582
01:03:50,462 --> 01:03:52,487
Yo! Jimbo!

583
01:03:52,664 --> 01:03:54,598
Wade, what are you doing here?

584
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,631
You know the world's my office.
Let's go this way.

585
01:03:57,835 --> 01:03:59,666
Did Q bring you up to speed?

586
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,668
Yeah. I brought along
the GPS calibration unit.

587
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:07,536
By the way, officially Uncle Sam
is neutral in this turkey shoot.

588
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:09,039
And unofficially?

589
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:12,269
We have no interest in seeing
World War III, unless we start it.

590
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:15,939
Dr. Greenwalt.
He's the Air Force GPS expert.

591
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,675
Sorry about all this security...

592
01:04:17,885 --> 01:04:21,013
...but the GPS encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets...

593
01:04:21,188 --> 01:04:22,519
...in the U.S. military.

594
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:24,453
Show him what you got.

595
01:04:28,695 --> 01:04:31,686
Jesus, it's the missing encoder.
How the hell did you get that?

596
01:04:31,897 --> 01:04:34,365
Picked it up in Hamburg
yesterday morning.

597
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:37,798
Could somebody use this
to send a ship off course?

598
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:39,469
- Like the <i>Devonshire?</i>
- Whoa!

599
01:04:39,637 --> 01:04:41,969
I didn't hear anybody mention
the <i>Devonshire,</i> Did you?

600
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,631
- No.
- Good. So just answer his question.

601
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:48,300
Well, in theory, if you could alter
the timing chip...

602
01:04:48,512 --> 01:04:50,844
...you could slowly
send a ship off course.

603
01:04:51,014 --> 01:04:52,981
Like putting a magnet
near a compass.

604
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:54,377
Yeah, exactly.

605
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,178
- Then check this out.
- Oh, yeah.

606
01:05:09,229 --> 01:05:12,062
Those two circles should be
lining up on top of each other.

607
01:05:12,232 --> 01:05:14,825
Somebody's tampered
with your encoder.

608
01:05:16,669 --> 01:05:19,865
If we knew the last time and position
the <i>Devonshire</i> thought she was...

609
01:05:20,072 --> 01:05:22,700
...could you figure out
exactly where she sank?

610
01:05:22,908 --> 01:05:24,239
Sure.

611
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:26,839
- Wade?
- Yeah?

612
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:30,002
I have a small favor to ask.

613
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:39,519
The high-altitude,
low-opening jump, the HALO jump...

614
01:05:39,722 --> 01:05:42,748
...is where we get the most fatalities,
so listen up.

615
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:47,121
You free-fall for 5 miles and use your
oxygen, or you'll die of asphyxiation.

616
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:48,851
Sounds like my first marriage.

617
01:05:49,564 --> 01:05:50,929
Next, after the free-fall...

618
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:53,692
...pop the chute at 200 feet,
below the Chinese radar.

619
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,698
You'll be traveling
at over 200 miles an hour.

620
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,700
This snaps your head back
like a cantaloupe.

621
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,338
Don't crack your skull open
on the tanks.

622
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:01,972
I'll keep that in mind.

623
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:05,599
One last thing: When you hit the water,
don't forget to cut away your chute.

624
01:06:05,778 --> 01:06:08,075
Ninety percent of people
killed in HALO jumps...

625
01:06:08,246 --> 01:06:11,738
...got tangled up in their chutes
and drowned. Got it?

626
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:14,042
Seems like a lot
just to save the world.

627
01:06:14,218 --> 01:06:15,617
I've got no choice.

628
01:06:15,853 --> 01:06:18,788
I have to prove that ship
was deliberately sent off course.

629
01:06:19,223 --> 01:06:21,087
- One minute!
- Is the pickup set?

630
01:06:21,257 --> 01:06:23,657
You bet. After your mission,
turn on your beacon.

631
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,260
The extraction team
will pick you up after dark.

632
01:06:28,563 --> 01:06:29,996
Buddha bless!

633
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:32,926
- I just noticed something.
- Yeah?

634
01:06:33,668 --> 01:06:35,658
This is where the ship
thought it was.

635
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,737
This is where it really is.
But see that island?

636
01:06:38,906 --> 01:06:41,567
- Yeah.
- That means where he's jumping...

637
01:06:41,775 --> 01:06:43,800
...between the British
and Chinese fleets...

638
01:06:43,977 --> 01:06:46,741
Technically they're not
in Chinese territorial waters.

639
01:06:46,913 --> 01:06:49,380
- They belong to Vietnam.
- Vietnam?

640
01:06:49,581 --> 01:06:52,607
Does he have any
U.S. government markings on him?

641
01:06:52,818 --> 01:06:54,876
The parachute,
the wet suit, the fins.

642
01:06:55,086 --> 01:06:58,112
If the Vietnamese catch him,
they're gonna go crazy.

643
01:07:03,593 --> 01:07:05,584
He didn't even say goodbye.

644
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:27,218
Still interested in hostile takeovers?

645
01:11:28,152 --> 01:11:31,417
It's the opportunities for travel
that I like best about banking.

646
01:11:51,205 --> 01:11:53,007
Get them out of the water.

647
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:11,856
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
were following me around, Mr. Bond.

648
01:12:12,057 --> 01:12:13,854
You'll have to admit, though...

649
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:17,050
...we seem to have developed
a certain attachment to each other.

650
01:12:18,228 --> 01:12:20,219
Hopefully not for long.

651
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,595
Another Carver building.

652
01:12:26,803 --> 01:12:30,363
If I didn't know better, I'd say
he'd developed an edifice complex.

653
01:12:50,489 --> 01:12:51,888
General Chang?

654
01:12:52,057 --> 01:12:53,786
Friend of yours?

655
01:12:56,561 --> 01:12:58,893
Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.

656
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:02,297
Welcome to Saigon.

657
01:13:02,467 --> 01:13:04,263
It's always nice to see you, Elliot.

658
01:13:05,268 --> 01:13:07,896
I hadn't intended opening
this center until tomorrow...

659
01:13:08,105 --> 01:13:11,801
...but as you're here you can help me
write the inaugural story:

660
01:13:11,974 --> 01:13:13,498
Your obituaries.

661
01:13:13,742 --> 01:13:16,404
I hope you extended
the same courtesy to Paris.

662
01:13:18,346 --> 01:13:22,612
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one
who wrote my late wife's obituary...

663
01:13:22,784 --> 01:13:24,512
...when you asked her to betray me.

664
01:13:26,253 --> 01:13:27,652
Still, let's see.

665
01:13:28,222 --> 01:13:30,917
"British secret service agent
James Bond...

666
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:32,990
...and his collaborator Wai Lin...

667
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:36,090
...of the Chinese People's
External Security Force...

668
01:13:36,929 --> 01:13:38,418
...were found...

669
01:13:38,597 --> 01:13:40,758
...dead this morning...

670
01:13:40,966 --> 01:13:43,161
...in Vietnam.

671
01:13:45,503 --> 01:13:47,528
Lacks punch, don't you think?

672
01:13:47,872 --> 01:13:49,669
It's old news, Elliot.

673
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,636
We've been working together
for months.

674
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:54,641
Both our governments know what you
and General Chang are up to.

675
01:13:56,646 --> 01:13:58,510
I don't think so.

676
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,841
You may have seen the general
in the hallway just now...

677
01:14:01,016 --> 01:14:03,109
...but perhaps,
with all your jetting around...

678
01:14:03,285 --> 01:14:06,276
...you've not had chance to peruse
today's headlines.

679
01:14:11,858 --> 01:14:15,259
I rather like the last one.
It isn't even mine.

680
01:14:15,462 --> 01:14:17,396
I never believe what I read
in the press anyway.

681
01:14:18,364 --> 01:14:20,628
Therein lies your problem, Mr. Bond.

682
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:25,133
You see, we're both men of action,
but your era and Miss Lin's is passing.

683
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:28,828
Words are the new weapons,
satellites the new artillery.

684
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:32,908
And you become the new
supreme allied commander?

685
01:14:33,143 --> 01:14:34,474
Exactly!

686
01:14:34,645 --> 01:14:37,341
Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies...

687
01:14:38,582 --> 01:14:41,482
...I have my divisions.
TV, news, magazines.

688
01:14:42,552 --> 01:14:45,645
And by midnight I'll have reached
and influenced more people...

689
01:14:45,854 --> 01:14:49,381
...than anyone in the history
of this planet, save God Himself.

690
01:14:50,325 --> 01:14:53,157
And the best he ever managed
was the Sermon on the Mount.

691
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:54,726
You really are quite insane.

692
01:14:56,397 --> 01:14:59,059
The distance
between insanity and genius...

693
01:14:59,299 --> 01:15:01,028
...is measured only by success.

694
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:03,166
Excuse me.

695
01:15:03,336 --> 01:15:06,827
- General Chang is waiting.
- lf you'll forgive me...

696
01:15:07,105 --> 01:15:10,563
Your appearance here has forced me
to move up my timetable slightly.

697
01:15:10,742 --> 01:15:14,575
I'll leave you in the capable hands
of Mr. Stamper and his toys.

698
01:15:14,745 --> 01:15:16,076
Perhaps you'd like to see them.

699
01:15:17,348 --> 01:15:20,111
- Sir. The helicopter.
- Thanks, Gupta.

700
01:15:20,317 --> 01:15:23,218
Mr. Stamper is a protg
of the late Dr. Kaufman...

701
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:26,911
...who was schooling him in
the ancient art of chakra torture.

702
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,448
He was like a father to me.

703
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,684
Really? Interesting role model.

704
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:35,863
According to Eastern philosophy,
the body has seven chakra points.

705
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:39,131
Energy centers,
like the heart or genitals.

706
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:42,563
The purpose of these implements
is to probe those organs...

707
01:15:42,769 --> 01:15:44,862
...inflicting the maximum amount
of pain...

708
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:48,071
...whilst keeping the victim alive
for as long as possible.

709
01:15:48,274 --> 01:15:50,640
Dr. Kaufman's record
was 52 hours.

710
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:53,539
I'm hoping to break it.

711
01:15:54,613 --> 01:15:57,275
I would've thought watching
your TV shows was torture enough.

712
01:15:58,783 --> 01:16:00,114
Save this one till last.

713
01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:03,253
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart...

714
01:16:03,454 --> 01:16:07,481
...there should just be enough time
for him to watch it stop beating.

715
01:16:07,724 --> 01:16:08,986
Excuse me.

716
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:39,516
Go! Go! Go! Go!

717
01:16:47,025 --> 01:16:49,083
We can use the banner.

718
01:16:51,995 --> 01:16:53,587
Hope it holds.

719
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:58,198
- Get after them!
- Ready? Go!

720
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:24,918
Next time I'll take the elevator.

721
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:31,691
Push! Push!

722
01:17:51,946 --> 01:17:53,243
- Get a car!
- No, no!

723
01:17:53,448 --> 01:17:56,440
- Yes, a car!
- A bike is quicker.

724
01:17:57,084 --> 01:17:58,984
The keys.
Someone always forgets them.

725
01:17:59,152 --> 01:18:01,677
What are you doing?
I'm driving. Get off.

726
01:18:03,357 --> 01:18:04,755
Get on the back.

727
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,252
I'm slipping.

728
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,221
Stop fidgeting back there.

729
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:17,996
What are you...?

730
01:18:18,202 --> 01:18:19,567
Give me that.

731
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,670
Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!

732
01:18:21,872 --> 01:18:23,362
- Turn right.
- No, left.

733
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:25,370
Who's driving? Come on!

734
01:18:57,269 --> 01:18:58,292
Clutch!

735
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:05,906
Left! Left!

736
01:19:09,146 --> 01:19:10,636
How many back there?

737
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:12,711
I can't see. Hold on.

738
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:17,142
What are you...? What?

739
01:19:19,587 --> 01:19:22,715
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'd never dream of it.

740
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,316
One. No, two.

741
01:19:32,598 --> 01:19:34,031
- Go for the barrels.
- What?

742
01:19:37,437 --> 01:19:38,836
Very good.

743
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:00,819
Hold on!

744
01:20:08,563 --> 01:20:10,656
Let's take the highway.

745
01:20:30,849 --> 01:20:33,443
- Helicopter!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

746
01:21:20,424 --> 01:21:23,415
- Get on the back of the bike.
- Are you trying to protect me?

747
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,992
No. I need to balance the bike.
Get on the back.

748
01:21:35,037 --> 01:21:36,435
- You ready?
- Yeah.

749
01:21:36,671 --> 01:21:38,002
Go!

750
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,774
Pop the clutch.

751
01:22:22,945 --> 01:22:25,469
- It's behind us.
- Move!

752
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:29,477
Get out of the way!

753
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,508
You see the chopper?

754
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:06,212
I can't see. Hold on.

755
01:23:10,985 --> 01:23:12,145
What are you...?

756
01:23:25,664 --> 01:23:27,256
Trapped.

757
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:30,594
Never.

758
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:20,643
Would you pass the soap?

759
01:24:24,081 --> 01:24:25,980
Over there.

760
01:24:29,218 --> 01:24:31,709
You were pretty good
with that hook.

761
01:24:31,921 --> 01:24:35,014
It comes from growing up
in a rough neighborhood.

762
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:37,355
You were pretty good
on the bike.

763
01:24:37,526 --> 01:24:41,359
Well, that comes from
not growing up at all.

764
01:24:41,562 --> 01:24:43,393
Here. Allow me.

765
01:24:45,433 --> 01:24:47,332
Don't get any ideas, Mr. Bond.

766
01:24:47,534 --> 01:24:50,435
Just off the cuff,
I thought we might link up.

767
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:53,601
Work hand in hand?

768
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:57,070
Stick closer to each other.

769
01:24:57,309 --> 01:24:59,834
Maybe we go after
General Chang together.

770
01:25:01,345 --> 01:25:02,869
Your turn.

771
01:25:03,081 --> 01:25:04,878
Thanks for washing my hair.

772
01:25:06,317 --> 01:25:08,216
I work alone.

773
01:27:39,247 --> 01:27:40,839
Lucky for you I stopped by.

774
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:43,883
I could've taken care of him.

775
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:49,682
But you didn't.
Give me the earring.

776
01:27:51,591 --> 01:27:56,460
Copy of a Makarov 59.
Standard issue, Chinese army.

777
01:27:56,762 --> 01:27:58,752
Looks like General Chang
wants you dead.

778
01:27:58,997 --> 01:28:01,022
You still think
you can do this alone?

779
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,568
It depends whether your mission
is peace or revenge.

780
01:28:04,768 --> 01:28:07,066
This is about stopping a war.

781
01:28:12,742 --> 01:28:15,176
Last year we found
stealth material was missing...

782
01:28:15,378 --> 01:28:17,505
...from one of
General Chang's bases.

783
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:20,045
I followed a lead
to Carver's headquarters in Hamburg.

784
01:28:20,249 --> 01:28:21,716
Stealth material?

785
01:28:21,917 --> 01:28:23,714
We thought he was building
a stealth plane.

786
01:28:25,286 --> 01:28:27,914
No. Stealth boat.

787
01:28:28,122 --> 01:28:30,056
That's the only way they could
get close to the <i>Devonshire,,,</i>

788
01:28:30,224 --> 01:28:32,418
...so they could drill inside
the missile room.

789
01:28:33,193 --> 01:28:36,287
Remember? They stole
a cruise missile from that ship.

790
01:28:36,529 --> 01:28:39,258
He said he was moving the timetable
forward to midnight.

791
01:28:39,498 --> 01:28:41,398
Yes, of course he did.

792
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,761
Under cover of darkness
he'll position the stealth boat...

793
01:28:43,936 --> 01:28:45,562
...near the British fleet...

794
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:48,261
...fire the missile into China.

795
01:28:48,506 --> 01:28:52,202
- And we will retaliate.
- And Carver will provide the pictures.

796
01:28:53,143 --> 01:28:54,906
- I have to warn Beijing.
- No.

797
01:28:55,112 --> 01:28:57,478
Let's warn both our governments,
get them talking.

798
01:28:57,648 --> 01:28:59,382
It'll give us time to find the boat.

799
01:28:59,782 --> 01:29:01,511
Stand up.

800
01:29:23,136 --> 01:29:24,262
It's just like home.

801
01:29:24,437 --> 01:29:26,597
You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.

802
01:29:32,577 --> 01:29:35,568
On second thought, you type.

803
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:37,839
First we have to find the boat.

804
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:43,177
Of all the harbors and inlets
controlled by General Chang...

805
01:29:43,353 --> 01:29:46,186
...22 are in
highly populated areas.

806
01:29:46,356 --> 01:29:48,846
That leaves 14
where he could hide a stealth boat.

807
01:29:49,091 --> 01:29:50,854
You can see it during the day.

808
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,460
It's invisible to radar,
but not the human eye.

809
01:29:56,564 --> 01:29:57,690
Very novel.

810
01:29:58,766 --> 01:30:00,824
He'd have to hide it
someplace where...

811
01:30:01,001 --> 01:30:03,196
...he could sail to the <i>Devonshire</i>
and back in one night.

812
01:30:05,005 --> 01:30:06,131
This looks familiar.

813
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,002
- We've made some improvements.
- Have you, indeed?

814
01:30:10,209 --> 01:30:14,304
Okay. Four hours out
and four hours back.

815
01:30:14,846 --> 01:30:18,441
Assume the boat is traveling
at a speed of 30 knots.

816
01:30:21,118 --> 01:30:23,848
I've always been a fan
of Chinese technology.

817
01:30:25,089 --> 01:30:26,647
According to this...

818
01:30:26,824 --> 01:30:29,485
...there are four places
where he could harbor the boat.

819
01:30:29,659 --> 01:30:31,388
Up on your left.

820
01:30:33,529 --> 01:30:36,588
Run a cross-check on those areas
for anything suspicious.

821
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:45,629
Ah, the new Walther.

822
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,831
I asked Q to get me one of these.

823
01:31:00,886 --> 01:31:03,115
I've got it. Look.

824
01:31:04,422 --> 01:31:07,084
Four missing boats.
Three unexplained drownings.

825
01:31:07,258 --> 01:31:08,418
That has to be it.

826
01:31:10,527 --> 01:31:12,427
Ha Long Bay.

827
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:30,743
He knows the island.

828
01:31:30,911 --> 01:31:34,642
He says that it's dangerous for
boats to be around there at sunset...

829
01:31:34,848 --> 01:31:37,782
...but for 5000 American dollars...

830
01:31:38,017 --> 01:31:40,542
...he'll take us.
- Good.

831
01:31:40,753 --> 01:31:42,653
Maybe he'll take a check.

832
01:31:57,667 --> 01:31:59,965
It's mostly dull routine,
of course...

833
01:32:00,203 --> 01:32:03,968
...but every now and then you get to
sail on a beautiful evening like this...

834
01:32:04,206 --> 01:32:08,438
...and sometimes work with a decadent
agent of a corrupt Western power.

835
01:32:08,677 --> 01:32:11,076
And they say Communists
don't know how to have fun.

836
01:32:12,613 --> 01:32:13,944
I hate to disappoint you...

837
01:32:14,415 --> 01:32:16,474
...but I don't even have
a little red book.

838
01:32:20,087 --> 01:32:21,918
If anything happens to me...

839
01:32:22,122 --> 01:32:24,487
...the fuses for the mines
are in here.

840
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:29,727
We're gonna finish this together.

841
01:32:29,929 --> 01:32:32,761
And if I may say so,
you found the right...

842
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:36,422
...decadent, corrupt Western agent...

843
01:32:36,601 --> 01:32:38,295
...as a partner.

844
01:32:58,419 --> 01:33:00,444
- See the stealth?
- No.

845
01:33:01,255 --> 01:33:04,224
It's getting late
and this is the last cove in the bay.

846
01:33:12,631 --> 01:33:14,531
Yeah, that's it.

847
01:33:43,992 --> 01:33:45,323
Set the timers for 10 minutes.

848
01:33:45,493 --> 01:33:48,393
That'll give us time to get out of
here before the ship explodes.

849
01:33:48,562 --> 01:33:51,122
Even if it doesn't sink,
it'll show up on radar.

850
01:33:51,331 --> 01:33:54,163
- Our fleets will finish the job.
- lf they got our message.

851
01:33:54,367 --> 01:33:57,666
- Okay, you, up and over.
- Okay.

852
01:34:13,082 --> 01:34:14,982
<i>We're in position</i>
<i>between the fleets,</i>

853
01:34:15,485 --> 01:34:19,216
Fire one missile
at the flagship of each fleet.

854
01:34:19,422 --> 01:34:23,187
The Chinese will think the British
are rattling the saber...

855
01:34:23,392 --> 01:34:26,918
...the British will think the Chinese
are being belligerent...

856
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:31,029
...and the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.

857
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,226
Let the mayhem begin.

858
01:34:45,511 --> 01:34:46,739
Missile lock-on.

859
01:34:46,912 --> 01:34:51,109
Send a signal to the Admiralty:
"Task group under missile attack."

860
01:34:52,951 --> 01:34:56,181
Sir, AWACS reports two waves
of land-based MiG 21 s inbound.

861
01:34:56,353 --> 01:34:58,913
The first group should be
on our screens in two minutes.

862
01:34:59,089 --> 01:35:03,184
How long before the MiGs are within
firing range of the British fleet?

863
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:04,383
Twelve minutes.

864
01:35:05,328 --> 01:35:08,125
What the hell do I pay you for?

865
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:14,333
If she's there, Bond is there.

866
01:35:14,535 --> 01:35:15,934
Stamper, find them.

867
01:35:21,908 --> 01:35:24,638
Wai Lin! Wai Lin! Camera!

868
01:35:34,052 --> 01:35:35,712
If she blinks, kill her.

869
01:35:36,153 --> 01:35:37,643
You come with me.

870
01:36:23,961 --> 01:36:26,896
<i>Stamper to Bridge, Bond is dead,</i>

871
01:36:27,097 --> 01:36:28,359
Delicious.

872
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:31,796
Make sure you clear all the mines,
and bring the girl up to me.

873
01:36:37,306 --> 01:36:39,331
Are you sure you want her up here?

874
01:36:40,309 --> 01:36:42,174
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.

875
01:36:42,411 --> 01:36:44,037
I like an audience.

876
01:36:50,216 --> 01:36:52,150
Ah, Miss Lin.

877
01:36:52,652 --> 01:36:55,314
Your countrymen are being
so cooperative...

878
01:36:55,488 --> 01:36:57,819
...so predictably eager
to save face.

879
01:36:57,990 --> 01:37:01,153
My government knows you're
out here. They're looking for you.

880
01:37:02,161 --> 01:37:04,060
Not according to our radar...

881
01:37:04,228 --> 01:37:08,528
...where it seems your MiGs are
about to attack the British fleet...

882
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:10,224
...in how many minutes?

883
01:37:10,467 --> 01:37:12,367
Nine minutes to firing range.

884
01:37:12,536 --> 01:37:15,061
And even if they were
looking for me...

885
01:37:15,305 --> 01:37:16,704
...we're on a stealth boat.

886
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:20,675
They can't see me, or you...

887
01:37:20,843 --> 01:37:22,868
...or even your friend...

888
01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:24,534
...the late Commander Bond...

889
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:29,741
...who is at this moment on his way
to the bottom of the South China Sea.

890
01:37:30,251 --> 01:37:32,150
He's my new anchorman.

891
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:46,364
Pathetic.

892
01:37:50,769 --> 01:37:52,861
What on earth's going on?

893
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:55,300
A message from 007...

894
01:37:55,539 --> 01:37:58,302
...just confirmed by
my opposite number in China.

895
01:37:58,541 --> 01:38:02,739
"Tell the fleet to search for a ship
that's almost invisible to radar."

896
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,237
The Chinese aren't the enemy.

897
01:38:05,781 --> 01:38:08,750
Carver's been playing
both sides for fools.

898
01:38:10,986 --> 01:38:13,783
Admiral, sir,
urgent message from the Admiralty.

899
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:17,417
Look at this.

900
01:38:18,992 --> 01:38:23,292
Anything on radar that looks small?
Lifeboat, periscope, anything?

901
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:26,899
- No, sir.
- Stealth boat, sir? They've gone mad.

902
01:38:34,172 --> 01:38:38,802
What you're about to witness, Miss
Lin, is not so much a missile attack...

903
01:38:38,977 --> 01:38:40,876
...but the launch
of a new world order.

904
01:38:41,078 --> 01:38:45,879
In five minutes, after your countrymen
have attacked the British fleet...

905
01:38:46,048 --> 01:38:48,949
I shall retaliate
for dear old England...

906
01:38:49,185 --> 01:38:51,881
...by sending this missile
into Beijing...

907
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:55,380
...where General Chang has just
called an emergency meeting...

908
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:57,615
...of the Chinese high command.

909
01:38:57,792 --> 01:38:59,316
Unfortunately...

910
01:39:00,794 --> 01:39:03,922
...General Chang
will be delayed in traffic...

911
01:39:04,465 --> 01:39:08,798
...arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders...

912
01:39:08,968 --> 01:39:13,734
...and too late to stop the air force
from sinking the entire British fleet.

913
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:19,133
But he'll be just in time to take over
the government, negotiate a truce...

914
01:39:19,311 --> 01:39:21,938
...and emerge as a world leader...

915
01:39:22,146 --> 01:39:24,580
...with the Nobel Peace Prize.

916
01:39:24,782 --> 01:39:26,841
- And what do you get?
- Me?

917
01:39:27,784 --> 01:39:30,150
Oh, nothing.

918
01:39:31,321 --> 01:39:35,347
Just exclusive broadcasting rights
in China for the next hundred years.

919
01:39:38,027 --> 01:39:40,086
Ready to rock and ruin.

920
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:44,295
If you'll excuse me, my dear,
I have a deadline to meet.

921
01:39:44,499 --> 01:39:45,932
Prepare for the missile launch.

922
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:50,862
Mr. Gupta.

923
01:39:51,438 --> 01:39:53,303
Hello, Elliot.

924
01:39:53,507 --> 01:39:55,371
Interesting plan.

925
01:39:55,875 --> 01:39:58,207
<i>But I think I have</i>
<i>something that belongs to you,</i>

926
01:39:58,377 --> 01:40:01,504
So much for German efficiency.
Mr. Stamper.

927
01:40:10,888 --> 01:40:13,049
- Don't shoot him yet.
- Hold your fire.

928
01:40:15,158 --> 01:40:17,456
Welcome to my world crisis,
Mr. Bond.

929
01:40:18,194 --> 01:40:19,718
Even trade, Elliot.

930
01:40:19,896 --> 01:40:21,624
Gupta for Wai Lin.

931
01:40:21,797 --> 01:40:23,856
You can't fire the missile
without him.

932
01:40:24,633 --> 01:40:27,568
And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.

933
01:40:28,402 --> 01:40:31,166
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

934
01:40:31,372 --> 01:40:34,398
I told you we're going to
finish this together.

935
01:40:35,009 --> 01:40:36,475
How romantic.

936
01:40:37,377 --> 01:40:40,642
Do you realize
how absurd your position is?

937
01:40:40,847 --> 01:40:43,406
No more absurd than
starting a war for ratings.

938
01:40:43,649 --> 01:40:48,484
Great men have always manipulated
the media to save the world.

939
01:40:48,687 --> 01:40:51,712
Look at William Randolph Hearst,
who told his photographers:

940
01:40:51,889 --> 01:40:55,347
"You provide the pictures,
I'll provide the war."

941
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,652
I've just taken it one step further.

942
01:41:02,099 --> 01:41:03,759
Sorry about that.

943
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:06,231
I tuned out there
for a moment, Elliot.

944
01:41:06,869 --> 01:41:08,063
Touch.

945
01:41:09,238 --> 01:41:10,363
Mr. Gupta...

946
01:41:10,538 --> 01:41:12,199
...is the missile ready to fire?

947
01:41:12,373 --> 01:41:14,705
Press the magic button,
Beijing disappears.

948
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:18,878
Then it seems
you've outlived your contract.

949
01:41:21,448 --> 01:41:24,314
You see, Mr. Bond,
I have a backup plan.

950
01:41:25,618 --> 01:41:27,210
So do I.

951
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,200
He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.

952
01:41:53,876 --> 01:41:56,902
Sir, we have a small,
intermittent contact on the surface.

953
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:59,841
Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

954
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:04,039
It's a very weak signal, but I'd swear
it wasn't there a second ago, sir.

955
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:08,278
Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on the
Chinese for any reason whatsoever.

956
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:11,048
Send the message
to the Chinese fleet commander:

957
01:42:11,223 --> 01:42:12,622
"Have sighted unknown ship..."

958
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:15,555
Get those fires out!

959
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:17,728
Get down there
and protect the missile.

960
01:42:17,929 --> 01:42:22,366
Oh, and Mr. Stamper,
would you please kill those bastards?

961
01:42:39,381 --> 01:42:41,008
Nice work.

962
01:42:44,419 --> 01:42:46,409
They're speeding up.

963
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:49,748
- We have to stop the boat.
- Can you take care of the engine room?

964
01:42:49,924 --> 01:42:52,255
- Of course.
- Good. Do it and get off the ship.

965
01:42:54,394 --> 01:42:56,021
I'm going to stop the missile.

966
01:43:06,204 --> 01:43:08,968
Signal from
the Chinese fleet commander.

967
01:43:09,941 --> 01:43:11,704
"To Royal Navy Task Group:

968
01:43:11,909 --> 01:43:14,672
We also have the unknown ship
on our screens.

969
01:43:14,844 --> 01:43:17,210
We will not fire
unless it turns towards China.

970
01:43:17,414 --> 01:43:19,711
Until then, she's yours.
Good hunting."

971
01:43:19,949 --> 01:43:23,112
Now, captain, whatever
the hell that thing is, sink it.

972
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:26,651
Right, sir. Is that echo
too weak for missile lock?

973
01:43:26,854 --> 01:43:28,048
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

974
01:43:28,223 --> 01:43:30,214
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

975
01:43:38,031 --> 01:43:39,861
Bond turned us into the target.

976
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:41,925
Along with himself.

977
01:43:42,134 --> 01:43:44,193
Take evasive action.

978
01:43:44,804 --> 01:43:46,998
Prepare the missile countdown
immediately.

979
01:43:47,205 --> 01:43:51,642
Initializing launch sequence.
T minus five minutes and counting.

980
01:43:51,843 --> 01:43:55,209
<i>T minus five minutes and counting,</i>

981
01:43:55,379 --> 01:43:57,404
Sir, they're making 48 knots.

982
01:43:57,581 --> 01:44:00,048
They'll be out of range
in two minutes.

983
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:02,184
Keep firing. Slow them down.

984
01:45:04,705 --> 01:45:08,106
The engines are out. We're sitting
ducks here. Engine room.

985
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:50,336
Follow me!

986
01:46:38,218 --> 01:46:41,949
<i>T minus four minutes and counting,</i>

987
01:47:26,192 --> 01:47:28,956
Well done.
Officer watch, increase max.

988
01:47:29,128 --> 01:47:30,356
Keep firing!

989
01:47:32,664 --> 01:47:34,154
All hands, abandon ship.

990
01:47:34,566 --> 01:47:35,897
Abandon ship.

991
01:47:36,635 --> 01:47:39,535
<i>Abandon ship, Abandon ship,</i>

992
01:48:00,188 --> 01:48:03,555
Mr. Stamper,
what are you doing about the girl?

993
01:48:04,058 --> 01:48:07,083
Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.

994
01:48:10,096 --> 01:48:14,054
<i>T minus three minutes and counting,</i>

995
01:49:06,812 --> 01:49:09,609
You're too late again, Mr. Bond.

996
01:49:10,748 --> 01:49:13,080
It's a bad habit of yours.

997
01:49:13,284 --> 01:49:15,012
There's nothing you can do.

998
01:49:23,659 --> 01:49:26,924
<i>T minus two minutes and counting,</i>

999
01:49:27,129 --> 01:49:29,153
The missile's fully programmed.

1000
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:31,355
It can't be stopped.

1001
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:33,590
In minutes my plan will succeed.

1002
01:49:35,536 --> 01:49:37,595
And thanks largely to your efforts...

1003
01:49:37,804 --> 01:49:40,102
...the British Navy
will destroy the evidence...

1004
01:49:40,274 --> 01:49:43,470
...and I'll be out of here
in a Carver news helicopter...

1005
01:49:43,676 --> 01:49:45,166
...covering the event.

1006
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:48,505
It's going to be a fantastic show.

1007
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:51,547
I may have some breaking news
for you, Elliot.

1008
01:49:56,754 --> 01:50:00,850
You forgot the first rule
of mass media, Elliot:

1009
01:50:03,693 --> 01:50:05,558
Give the people what they want.

1010
01:50:19,473 --> 01:50:23,067
<i>T minus one minute and counting,</i>

1011
01:50:37,388 --> 01:50:39,015
Drop it, Mr. Bond...

1012
01:50:39,223 --> 01:50:40,690
...or I drop your friend.

1013
01:50:42,693 --> 01:50:44,092
It's over, Stamper.

1014
01:50:44,695 --> 01:50:45,821
Let her go.

1015
01:50:46,029 --> 01:50:47,496
Not between you and me.

1016
01:50:49,665 --> 01:50:53,101
James, try the detonators.
The missile will set them off.

1017
01:50:53,669 --> 01:50:56,330
Never argue with a woman.
