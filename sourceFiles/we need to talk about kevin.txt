1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,200
We Need To Talk About Kevin

2
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,366
<i>When you go to the ball...</i>

3
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:59,949
<i>you have to learn how to dance
like a princess, right?</i>

4
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,657
<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

5
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,074
<i>- 1, 2, 3...
- Yeah!</i>

6
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:06,616
<i>What are you gonna wear today?</i>

7
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,282
<i>- I'm gonna wear...
- You're gonna wear...</i>

8
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:11,199
<i>- I'm gonna wear...
- A bucket on your head.</i>

9
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,199
<i>- No!
- 1, 2, 3... No?</i>

10
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,282
<i>- And a barrel round your bottom.
- No!</i>

11
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:19,657
<i>- And cloth bags for shoes?
- Nooo!</i>

12
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:22,742
<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

13
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,492
<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

14
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:37,658
Good morning.

15
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:42,449
Hey buddy!

16
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,158
Want something to eat?

17
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,075
No. I'm not hungry.

18
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,242
Yeah, that's fine.

19
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,908
Yeah.

20
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,184
<i>Franklin?</i>

21
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:30,742
<i>Hey. It's me. I just
wanted to leave a message.</i>

22
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:34,532
<i>Do you think we could make
some time to talk later</i>

23
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,699
<i>just the two of us, without the kids?</i>

24
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,657
<i>I really wanna work this thing out.</i>

25
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:42,867
<i>Okay?
I miss you.</i>

26
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,450
Eva Khatchadourian!

27
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:37,700
It's a lot.

28
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,616
Look, Eva.

29
00:10:42,617 --> 00:10:44,324
I don't really care who you are

30
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:47,032
or what you've done so long as
you can type and you can file.

31
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,908
You can have this job.

32
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:53,575
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.

33
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:59,282
I wont let you down.
I promise you. Thank you.

34
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,325
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

35
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,533
See you Monday.

36
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:07,283
Great. Thank you.

37
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:31,199
Looks like someone is having
a nice day?

38
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,782
Enjoying yourself?

39
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,283
I'm sorry?

40
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:43,158
I hope you rot in hell, you
fucking bitch!

41
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,199
Jesus. What the hell was that?
Are you ok?

42
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,574
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.

43
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,782
- Let me call 911.
- No, no, it was my fault.

44
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,783
- But she just totally...
- No, no, I'm fine.

45
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,033
<i>Eva, when are you coming home?</i>

46
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,283
<i>I miss you.</i>

47
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,950
<i>I love you.</i>

48
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:21,366
<i>Promise me you'll never
go away again.</i>

49
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:25,116
<i>I will never, never,
never go away again.</i>

50
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:29,492
<i>Promise me. Promise me</i>

51
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:32,575
<i>you'll never go away again.</i>

52
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:43,824
Is it safe?

53
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:45,200
No, it's not safe.

54
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:47,575
Sure?

55
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:53,408
Are you sure about this?

56
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:31,783
<i>This really happened?</i>

57
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:40,658
<i>I can see, I can feel it...</i>

58
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,075
<i>We did it.</i>

59
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:12,699
I'm gonna need all these processed
today, Eva.

60
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,657
Uh, but today my afternoon off.

61
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,032
You remember? I told you.

62
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,741
Ah shit, that's right.

63
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:22,033
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.

64
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:30,117
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey, Al.

65
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,157
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!

66
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:14,949
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.

67
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,367
Hey lady! Lady! Lady! Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!

68
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,033
Get off of me!

69
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:33,908
Eva, you can stop resisting.

70
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,908
Stop resisting, Eva.

71
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,533
Eva!

72
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:41,075
Rise and shine.

73
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:44,532
It's late, Eva.

74
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,825
The day is almost over.

75
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,574
- Hiii! - Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.

76
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,658
I just put him down, Franklin.

77
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:57,199
Hi.

78
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,367
There he is. You wanna play?

79
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:03,700
You wanna play?

80
00:23:06,825 --> 00:23:08,492
It's alright.

81
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,992
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.

82
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,742
Do you think I'm exaggerating?

83
00:23:18,492 --> 00:23:21,616
You just have to rock him a
little bit.

84
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:24,742
You just have to rock him a
little bit.

85
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:27,283
There's my little dude!

86
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,533
Jesus! All 12?

87
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,991
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken...

88
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:19,450
I'll take them as they are!

89
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,366
<i>You're gonna be a good looking boy.</i>

90
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:56,325
<i>All the girls are gonna love you.</i>

91
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:15,658
I know it. Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.

92
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,116
Can you say "mommy"?

93
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:25,492
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?

94
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:29,075
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".

95
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:32,117
"Ball"?

96
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,325
No?
Okay.

97
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:38,199
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're
gonna roll it back to me, okay?

98
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,616
Okay.

99
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:41,367
Roll it back to mommy.

100
00:26:44,617 --> 00:26:47,367
Roll it back. Roll.
Roll it back.

101
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,325
Okay, okay.

102
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,407
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.

103
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:04,658
Roll it back.
Roll it back.

104
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:08,157
When he was a baby,
he never stopped screaming.

105
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:10,450
I thought maybe it had damaged
his hearing.

106
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:16,367
No, his hearing is fine.

107
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:21,908
But shouldn't he be talking by now?

108
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:25,949
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing
was the...

109
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,200
an early sign of autism.

110
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,700
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.

111
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:38,200
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

112
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:47,200
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?

113
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:51,075
But there is nothing wrong with him.

114
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,700
Thank you.

115
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:06,907
Okay.

116
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:08,450
Roll it back to mommy.

117
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:18,824
Okay. Gonna roll it back again.

118
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:20,449
That was really good, Kev.

119
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,533
Okay. Here we go.
Okay?

120
00:28:24,117 --> 00:28:25,492
Okay?

121
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:41,074
<i>"E" is for elephant,
large as a house,</i>

122
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:44,699
<i>he's big as can be,
not small like a mouse.</i>

123
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,616
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?

124
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,992
"Elephant".

125
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:53,992
Kevin!

126
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,949
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?

127
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,574
No!

128
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:02,032
- "Mommy"?
- No!

129
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,158
- Just say "mommy".
- No.

130
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:01,992
Trick or treat?

131
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:07,325
Trick or treat?
Hey lady. We know you're in there.

132
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,074
<i>I don't like that!</i>

133
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,450
<i>I don't like that!</i>

134
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:27,116
<i>I don't like that!</i>

135
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:31,908
Mommy was happy before little Kevin
came along. Do you know that?

136
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:37,449
And now mommy wakes up every morning...

137
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,742
and wishes she was in France!

138
00:32:53,617 --> 00:32:55,616
That elevator is a death trap.

139
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:58,241
He needs a yard,
somewhere he can toss a ball,

140
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,617
fill a pool.

141
00:33:01,575 --> 00:33:03,575
But I love New York.

142
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:06,032
Come on!

143
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:07,907
You sound like a bumper sticker.

144
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:10,532
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.

145
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,575
He's only gonna be a kid once.

146
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:15,491
You can house hunt all you want.

147
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:17,450
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.

148
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:20,491
Kevin, stop that. That's enough.

149
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:22,157
Let mommy and daddy talk.

150
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:23,783
Kevin, quit that!

151
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:30,866
<i>You have your family room here.</i>

152
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:34,533
<i>Master bedroom is back there
and two huge walk-in closets.</i>

153
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,742
<i>The bathroom is amazing.</i>

154
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:58,282
Here we are, guys.

155
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:00,117
Our very own castle.

156
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:41,908
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?

157
00:34:58,033 --> 00:35:00,075
Hey! Hey!
Wait up! Mrs. K!

158
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:06,751
Hey! It's me!

159
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:08,950
Soweto.

160
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,283
Hi there.

161
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,825
I just wanted to see how you were.

162
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:23,950
I'm fine. Thanks.

163
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:26,991
You look well.

164
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:31,158
Yeah. The doctors are saying there's
a chance I might walk again.

165
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:33,367
That's great.

166
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:38,492
Well, you take care, Mrs. K.

167
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:41,283
You, too.

168
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,741
Come on, come on!

169
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:22,699
Die! Die!

170
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,033
No! No! No!

171
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:29,158
- Die!
- How do you jump?

172
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,325
Die!

173
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,742
Go! Go! Go! Go!

174
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:40,742
Die!

175
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:54,199
Hey Kev? Are you out there?

176
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,658
Kevin?

177
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:59,200
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.

178
00:37:01,242 --> 00:37:03,533
You can do that too.

179
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:29,657
So you want a connector right there.

180
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:33,657
You see? And click on that link
and it should open right up.

181
00:37:33,658 --> 00:37:37,574
And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.

182
00:37:37,575 --> 00:37:40,825
- So you left click. Wanna give it a try?
- Sure.

183
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:43,699
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,074
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.

185
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:49,157
See that? It comes up.

186
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:52,908
Right. Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.

187
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:55,408
Thank you for your help.

188
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:13,992
I pooped.

189
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:16,367
Hey buddy. What?

190
00:38:18,325 --> 00:38:19,782
You pooped?

191
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:22,741
Oh okay. Here let me help you.

192
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:24,117
Okay.

193
00:38:24,658 --> 00:38:27,492
Go to your room. I'll be right there.

194
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,657
Let's not wake up mommy.

195
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:32,575
Go on! Go on, buddy.

196
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:12,658
These squiggly squares
of paper, they are dumb.

197
00:39:16,742 --> 00:39:19,324
Everybody needs a room of their own.

198
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:21,324
You have your room.
This is the mama's room.

199
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:24,449
I can help you make your room special,
if you'd like.

200
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,492
What do you mean, "special"?

201
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,450
Well, so it looks like your personality.

202
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:35,408
What personality?

203
00:39:37,283 --> 00:39:39,158
I think you know what I mean.

204
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,367
They're dumb.

205
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,700
No, no, no. I mean it's good.

206
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,408
You don't need me to do that?

207
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,117
And... and the guys...

208
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:18,033
Okay.

209
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:22,782
Well, I mean, if you have it in hand...

210
00:40:22,783 --> 00:40:24,616
I could.

211
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:25,950
Really?

212
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:31,782
Well, that all sounds great.

213
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:33,157
Okay, John.

214
00:40:33,158 --> 00:40:36,492
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

215
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:47,242
Kevin?

216
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:50,783
Kevin?

217
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,283
What else do you have to say?

218
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:40,742
Go wash your face!

219
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:00,533
He said, he's really sorry.

220
00:42:01,992 --> 00:42:04,742
And that he was only trying to help
make it special.

221
00:42:29,075 --> 00:42:31,033
Do you remember how you got that?

222
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:35,742
It's the most honest thing
you ever did.

223
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:41,408
Do you know how they potty train cats?

224
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,700
They stick their noses in their own shit.

225
00:42:47,075 --> 00:42:48,782
They don't like it.

226
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:51,033
So they use the box.

227
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,074
Okay. Let's work on our counting.

228
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:59,033
- What comes after 3?
- 9.

229
00:43:01,408 --> 00:43:04,450
- What comes after 7?
- 71.

230
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,157
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

231
00:43:07,158 --> 00:43:11,407
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

232
00:43:11,408 --> 00:43:15,991
21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

233
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:20,741
31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

234
00:43:20,742 --> 00:43:26,741
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

235
00:43:26,742 --> 00:43:28,992
Now, can we quit?

236
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,043
There.

237
00:43:40,343 --> 00:43:43,867
You can add that together
if you think you're so smart.

238
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,658
You did not...

239
00:44:02,992 --> 00:44:04,783
You did not...

240
00:44:25,283 --> 00:44:27,450
Are you enjoying yourself?

241
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:02,325
I can see the doctor by myself.

242
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:20,783
I have to tell you something, Eva.

243
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:24,492
It's a brave boy you've got there.

244
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:33,242
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

245
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:59,825
What mamma did
was very, very wrong.

246
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:04,492
And she's so, so sorry.

247
00:46:17,117 --> 00:46:19,908
Hey, Kev? Kev, hold on a sec!

248
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:22,700
Kev?

249
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:24,700
Kevin?

250
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,158
Hey Kev.
What happened?

251
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,449
I broke my arm.

252
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,324
How did you brake your arm?

253
00:46:33,325 --> 00:46:35,157
I had poopy pants.

254
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:37,610
Mommy went to get wipes.

255
00:46:37,617 --> 00:46:40,866
I fell off the changing table
onto my dump trucks.

256
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:43,700
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.

257
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:52,117
It's all my fault.

258
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:56,491
No, no, don't be silly.

259
00:46:56,492 --> 00:46:59,325
You can't watch him
every second of the day.

260
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:30,200
Franklin...

261
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:46,950
Unbelievable.

262
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,533
How did you get him
to do that?

263
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:56,825
Well, whatever it was it worked.

264
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:13,450
Not yet.

265
00:48:25,117 --> 00:48:26,575
Okay.

266
00:48:45,617 --> 00:48:47,033
I love you, kiddo.

267
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,783
I don't like that.
Turn it off.

268
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:12,574
Honey. Do you mind if we stop
over at the store?

269
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:14,783
I wanna go home.

270
00:50:15,908 --> 00:50:18,283
It's just that I need to pick up...

271
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,575
Home it is.

272
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:48,575
Hey, guys!

273
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:52,742
Hey, Dad! How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?

274
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:06,075
Eva, he's just a boy.

275
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,032
He's a sweet little boy.

276
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,117
That's what boys do.

277
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:07,450
Mom is fat!

278
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,024
When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?

279
00:52:15,025 --> 00:52:17,400
Soon. Now.

280
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,400
How am I part of the decision now?

281
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:24,067
What am I supposed to say now?

282
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,399
So, the daddy bear plants his seed
in the mommy bear

283
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,232
and it grows into an egg.

284
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:40,650
Is this about fucking?

285
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,817
Do you know what that means?

286
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:49,900
The boy puts his pee pee
in the girl's doo doo.

287
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,816
Well...

288
00:52:54,817 --> 00:52:58,274
Haven't you ever wished
you had somebody else around to play with?

289
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,649
No.

290
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,232
You might like it.

291
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:03,149
What if I don't like it?

292
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,066
Then you get used to it.

293
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:07,399
Just because you're used to
something...

294
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,982
doesn't mean you like it.

295
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:10,650
You're used to me.

296
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,066
Yes, well...

297
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:20,567
In a few months we're all gonna
get used to somebody new.

298
00:53:25,317 --> 00:53:27,067
Beautiful.

299
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,399
Hey, Kev. Come over and meet your
little sister.

300
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,732
This is your brother. It's Kevin.

301
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:37,482
It's your big brother.

302
00:53:37,483 --> 00:53:40,982
Yes, yeah.

303
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:45,316
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...

304
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:48,566
Kevin! Don't do that.

305
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:51,232
No, Kevin. That's not nice.

306
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:53,316
It's OK.

307
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,733
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.

308
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:14,066
<i>Christ! To Ecuador? For 2 months?
Why can't you send someone else?</i>

309
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:17,650
<i>I really wanna work this deal.</i>

310
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,982
<i>First he cries too much,
then he's too quiet.</i>

311
00:54:22,983 --> 00:54:25,732
<i>Then he makes up his own little language,
and it's annoying.</i>

312
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:28,732
<i>He has trouble toilet-training.
A lot of kids do.</i>

313
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,482
<i>And you see this as some kind
of personal vendetta?</i>

314
00:54:30,483 --> 00:54:31,983
<i>This is not good for him.</i>

315
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:37,899
<i>Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!</i>

316
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,900
<i>Pick up the god damn phone.</i>

317
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,732
...13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19...

318
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:49,982
...20, 21, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27...

319
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:07,567
Please! Please! Let me have
a drink. I'm begging you! Pleeeease!

320
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:14,900
Kevin?

321
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:17,483
Kevin!

322
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,983
Honey?

323
00:55:23,983 --> 00:55:25,483
Are you ok?

324
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:53,150
I'm sorry, mom.

325
00:55:54,233 --> 00:55:55,804
Not to worry, sweetheart.

326
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:58,817
You couldn't help it.

327
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,899
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.

328
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,816
"Art thou the devil in blue,
to shoot in that wise?"

329
00:56:06,817 --> 00:56:11,399
"Nay," quoth Robin, laughing,
"not quite so ill as that, I trust."

330
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,400
"And he took up another shaft... "
Are you okay, honey?

331
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,732
"And he took up another shaft
and fitted it to the string."

332
00:56:24,733 --> 00:56:26,232
"Again he shot..."

333
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:29,566
"and again he smote the arrow
close beside the center;"

334
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:31,982
"a third time he loosed his bowstring"

335
00:56:31,983 --> 00:56:34,649
"and dropped his arrow
just betwixt the other two"

336
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,149
"and into the very center,"

337
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,816
"so that the feathers of all three
were ruffled together,"

338
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:42,316
"seeming from a distance
to be one thick shaft."

339
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:46,482
"And now a low murmur ran
all among that great crowd..."

340
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:48,400
Hey champ. How are you doing?

341
00:56:49,317 --> 00:56:50,900
Feeling better?

342
00:56:52,067 --> 00:56:54,233
Go away. I'm tired.

343
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:57,567
Oh. Okay.

344
00:56:58,817 --> 00:57:01,566
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?

345
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:04,233
Don't stop reading, mom.

346
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:14,732
"Two hundred and eighty score
shafts were shot in all,"

347
00:57:14,733 --> 00:57:18,316
"and so deftly were they sped that
when the shooting was done"

348
00:57:18,317 --> 00:57:21,732
"each target looked like
the back of a hedgehog"

349
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:24,567
"when the farm dog snuffs at it."

350
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:15,732
Good afternoon, ma'am.

351
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,816
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.

352
00:58:17,817 --> 00:58:19,399
Well, it is actually.

353
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,733
Well, we just have a couple
of quick questions for you.

354
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:23,817
What's this about?

355
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,817
Do you know where you are
spending the afterlife?

356
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:30,640
Oh, yes, I do as a matter of fact.

357
00:58:30,948 --> 00:58:32,399
I'm going straight to hell.

358
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,649
Eternal damnation, the whole bit.

359
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,483
Thank you for asking.
Okay?

360
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:47,150
Hey, honey. Let me help you with that.

361
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,400
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?

362
00:58:53,483 --> 00:58:54,983
Sure.

363
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:57,732
I'm glad you're feeling better.

364
00:58:57,733 --> 00:59:00,066
Do you want some more of that
chowder for lunch?

365
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:01,566
Whatever.

366
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:05,067
- Or a grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

367
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,566
Thank you, dad, this is so cool!

368
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:18,982
You're welcome, buddy.

369
00:59:18,983 --> 00:59:21,067
Right. Here we go.
In the middle.

370
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,649
Ooooh. Almost. Here.

371
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:26,233
Take that one.
Try again.

372
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,942
Use your finger...

373
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,358
Keep your eyes in the middle.

374
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,900
Good shot, Kev.

375
01:00:30,317 --> 01:00:31,983
You're a natural.

376
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:35,982
Perfect.

377
01:00:35,983 --> 01:00:37,650
Thanks, dad.

378
01:01:16,275 --> 01:01:17,733
<i>Right.</i>

379
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,900
<i>It's like this.</i>

380
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,816
<i>You wake up.</i>

381
01:01:24,817 --> 01:01:27,067
<i>Then you watch TV.</i>

382
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:31,732
<i>You get in the car, then you
listen to the radio.</i>

383
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:36,316
<i>Then you go to you little job
or your little school</i>

384
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:39,900
<i>but we're not gonna hear about
that on the 6 o'clock news.</i>

385
01:01:42,067 --> 01:01:43,482
<i>Why?</i>

386
01:01:43,483 --> 01:01:46,400
<i>Because nothing is really happening.</i>

387
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,732
<i>Then you go home
and watch some more TV.</i>

388
01:01:50,733 --> 01:01:53,566
<i>Or maybe it's a fun night,
and you go out</i>

389
01:01:53,567 --> 01:01:55,400
<i>and you watch a movie.</i>

390
01:01:56,733 --> 01:01:59,649
I mean it's got so bad,
that half the time

391
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,482
the people on TV,

392
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:05,567
inside the TV,
they're watching TV.

393
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:09,900
And what are all these
people watching?

394
01:02:14,983 --> 01:02:16,900
People like me.

395
01:02:19,817 --> 01:02:23,067
<i>And what are all you
doing right now</i>

396
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:25,817
<i>but watching me?</i>

397
01:02:28,817 --> 01:02:31,149
<i>You don't think they would
have changed the channel by now</i>

398
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,900
<i>if all I did
was getting "A" in geometry?</i>

399
01:03:21,983 --> 01:03:25,232
Me and Kevin were playing
"Christmas kidnapping".

400
01:03:25,233 --> 01:03:27,400
Kevin!

401
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:31,649
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.

402
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:34,567
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.

403
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:47,399
No, nott that one, you retard.

404
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,975
Get me a root beer. - Hey!

405
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,233
What?

406
01:03:55,817 --> 01:03:58,233
Thanks, Celia.
I was thirsty.

407
01:04:01,983 --> 01:04:03,482
Hey, you wanne know a secret?

408
01:04:03,483 --> 01:04:04,900
Come closer.

409
01:04:05,817 --> 01:04:08,233
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?

410
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:13,650
It's the vacuum monster.

411
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:15,733
Cut it out!

412
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:21,983
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!

413
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,899
Ho, ho, ho. Look what I got!
Kev, come here. Give me a hand.

414
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,275
Yeah, sure, dad.

415
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:53,650
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.

416
01:05:56,067 --> 01:06:00,567
- Come on. Just one.
- I don't dance, really.

417
01:06:11,983 --> 01:06:14,733
Where do you get off,
you stuck up bitch?

418
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,817
Do you think anyone else
is gonna want you now?

419
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:41,650
Come on. Stay for another drink.

420
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:45,233
Come on.
Come on.

421
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,982
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

422
01:07:06,983 --> 01:07:09,317
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?

423
01:07:09,478 --> 01:07:11,922
- We'll see.
- Yeah.

424
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:29,150
Kevin!

425
01:08:12,483 --> 01:08:15,067
Didn't I see you at the
bookstore today?

426
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:19,400
Nope.

427
01:08:20,983 --> 01:08:23,067
Funny, I could have sworn.

428
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:31,900
By the way, are you doing
anything on Friday?

429
01:08:35,358 --> 01:08:36,733
Why?

430
01:08:39,817 --> 01:08:42,399
I just thought we might
do something together.

431
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,317
For fun.

432
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:47,233
Like, do what?

433
01:08:48,817 --> 01:08:51,400
Maybe take you for dinner.

434
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:54,650
Or play around with
miniature golf?

435
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:11,358
Okay.

436
01:09:25,442 --> 01:09:27,233
Why didn't you bring a coat?

437
01:09:29,108 --> 01:09:31,692
You just can't get uncomfortable
enough, can you?

438
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,900
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?

439
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,983
Whenever I see fat people,
they are always eating.

440
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:53,732
Dont' give me any of this "slow
metabolism, it's the glands" crap.

441
01:09:53,733 --> 01:09:55,316
It's food.

442
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:57,316
They are fat because
they eat the wrong food.

443
01:09:57,317 --> 01:09:59,400
Too much of it, and all the time.

444
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:06,732
You know, you can be
kind of harsh sometimes.

445
01:10:06,733 --> 01:10:09,232
You're one to talk.

446
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:11,219
Yeah, I am.

447
01:10:12,059 --> 01:10:13,942
I wonder where I got it.

448
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:34,567
Well, you won.

449
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,233
So. What next, momsy?

450
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,066
We're gonna go home. You're gonna get
changed into something reasonable.

451
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:04,733
And I'm taking you to dinner.

452
01:11:05,317 --> 01:11:06,733
Great.

453
01:11:20,233 --> 01:11:22,150
We're going to dinner.

454
01:11:24,567 --> 01:11:26,150
I was hungry.

455
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:28,567
I'm a growing boy, you know.

456
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:42,483
I'll have a... calorie salad,

457
01:11:44,025 --> 01:11:47,399
steak, medium rare,
and a bottle of merlot.

458
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,900
All right.

459
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:06,817
So, how's school going?

460
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,817
It's going.

461
01:12:14,567 --> 01:12:16,275
On a course schedule.

462
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,482
How about your teachers?
Are there any who are...

463
01:12:21,483 --> 01:12:24,567
Right, what bands am
I listening to these days?

464
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:29,649
Next you can weed all about whether there
isn't some cute little cunt

465
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,982
in the front row
who's got me itchy.

466
01:12:31,983 --> 01:12:35,566
That way you can segway into how it's
all up to me, of course

467
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:40,650
but before balling the chick in the hallway,
that I might decide to wait until I'm ready.

468
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:43,899
Right around dessert,
you can ask about drugs.

469
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,316
Real careful, like

470
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:48,024
cause you don't want to scare me
into, like, lying my head off.

471
01:12:48,025 --> 01:12:51,233
So you have to say
how you've experimented.

472
01:12:53,817 --> 01:12:56,274
Then finally once you've sucked
up that entire bottle of wine,

473
01:12:56,275 --> 01:12:57,732
you can go all gooey-eyed

474
01:12:57,733 --> 01:13:00,732
and say how nice it is to spend
quality time together,

475
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:04,400
then scooch over and put your
arm around my shoulder.

476
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,858
Give it a little squeeze.

477
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,358
Fuck!

478
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:16,025
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah. It's fucked.

479
01:15:16,733 --> 01:15:21,567
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.

480
01:15:26,733 --> 01:15:31,400
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.

481
01:15:34,733 --> 01:15:36,816
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?

482
01:15:36,817 --> 01:15:39,733
I don't like stamps.

483
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,900
But what is the point?

484
01:15:47,775 --> 01:15:48,922
There is no point.

485
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:51,733
That's the point.

486
01:15:56,733 --> 01:16:00,567
No, it really hasn't been any trouble
at all. Everybody is bringing a dish.

487
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:15,483
Oh! That's them now. I got to go.
OK, you have a great day.

488
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,983
Bye, mom.

489
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:22,483
Merry Christmas.

490
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:41,233
Alright, Kev.
You're next.

491
01:16:42,817 --> 01:16:44,317
Can you guess what it is?

492
01:16:49,192 --> 01:16:53,357
That's a series 7. The guy in the
store said it was the best one.

493
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:59,108
- Gee, dad. Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas. - It's perfect.

494
01:17:06,358 --> 01:17:09,400
What did you eat for breakfast?

495
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,650
How was your day, Snuffles?

496
01:17:31,942 --> 01:17:34,024
Did you hear that thump?

497
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:35,900
That's a powerful thing, man.

498
01:17:45,817 --> 01:17:47,317
Celia!

499
01:17:52,275 --> 01:17:54,858
Come on, honey. Time for bed.
Here we go.

500
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,775
I thought I closed the door.

501
01:18:09,067 --> 01:18:12,317
Kevin said I'm stupid,
and he's right.

502
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,650
You're not stupid, honey.

503
01:18:17,983 --> 01:18:22,150
Don't you worry. We'll find him.
Now you scoot down. Come on.

504
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:29,733
Cozy?

505
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:10,566
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to
the big pet store in the sky.

506
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:14,232
- Don't say that! Don't say that!
- Yes. It's the truth!

507
01:19:14,233 --> 01:19:15,732
Dearly beloved,

508
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:18,566
We are gathered here
to mourn Mr. Snuffles...

509
01:19:18,567 --> 01:19:19,899
Stop it!

510
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:25,400
...who was snuffed out... tragically early.

511
01:19:26,317 --> 01:19:30,232
So daddy and mommy were looking for him
the whole night.

512
01:19:30,233 --> 01:19:32,649
And you know why we couldn't find him?

513
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:36,483
Because Snuffles has gone
to live in the garden.

514
01:19:37,233 --> 01:19:39,024
He's living in the garden now,

515
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:42,192
with a whole bunch of new animal friends.

516
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,067
Celia.

517
01:19:51,483 --> 01:19:53,150
Okay, give me the spoon.

518
01:19:55,192 --> 01:19:57,775
So, they're having a big party tonight...

519
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:04,524
with the chipmunks, and the squarrels,
and the racoons...

520
01:20:04,525 --> 01:20:09,275
and they're eating nuts, and berries,

521
01:20:09,692 --> 01:20:15,525
and they're gonna have a whole bunch...

522
01:21:30,317 --> 01:21:32,900
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?

523
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:36,400
I didn't.

524
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:39,483
- I put it away!
- Then how did it get out?

525
01:21:49,692 --> 01:21:51,357
Ask Kevin.

526
01:21:51,358 --> 01:21:53,567
Kevin did it.

527
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,317
You need to go talk to someone.

528
01:23:16,733 --> 01:23:20,858
Kev, mom had something
that she wanted to tell you.

529
01:23:31,317 --> 01:23:33,567
I wanted to...

530
01:23:34,942 --> 01:23:37,400
thank you for calling the ambulance.

531
01:23:41,192 --> 01:23:42,567
And?

532
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:46,150
And...

533
01:23:47,733 --> 01:23:53,150
I was concerned that you might
be feeling responsible.

534
01:23:54,775 --> 01:23:56,150
Why is that?

535
01:23:57,733 --> 01:24:00,232
Because you was supposed to
be looking after her.

536
01:24:00,233 --> 01:24:02,483
We just don't want you to
blame yourself.

537
01:24:03,608 --> 01:24:07,317
No. I don't...
I mean I... I never said I did.

538
01:24:08,483 --> 01:24:11,066
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.

539
01:24:11,067 --> 01:24:14,732
So, we would appreciate you
looking after her,

540
01:24:14,733 --> 01:24:16,817
and any namecalling...

541
01:24:18,692 --> 01:24:22,233
You don't really remember being
a kid much do you, dad?

542
01:24:22,858 --> 01:24:25,317
Celia is just gonna have to
suck it up.

543
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:34,483
I thought you didn't like those.

544
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:38,483
Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it...

545
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,567
an acquired taste.

546
01:25:41,525 --> 01:25:43,067
I'm so sorry.

547
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,817
There you go.

548
01:25:58,317 --> 01:25:59,817
Okay.

549
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:06,317
Thank you, mommy.

550
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,900
- Hey, kiddo. Going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.

551
01:26:24,233 --> 01:26:27,233
- Hey, Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!

552
01:26:49,483 --> 01:26:52,650
So...
What do you wanna do?

553
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,275
We'll last out the school
year if we can and...

554
01:27:04,858 --> 01:27:06,983
make arrangements over the summer.

555
01:27:10,567 --> 01:27:13,192
At least custody
is a no-brainer.

556
01:27:14,733 --> 01:27:16,150
Is it?

557
01:27:20,067 --> 01:27:21,817
You've decided?

558
01:27:23,817 --> 01:27:26,192
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.

559
01:27:28,483 --> 01:27:29,858
It already happened.

560
01:27:41,983 --> 01:27:45,650
- Needed a drink of water.
- Hey you, Kev.

561
01:27:47,817 --> 01:27:49,399
Listen, buddy,

562
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:53,400
it's easy to misunderstand something
when you hear it out of context.

563
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:59,400
Why would I not know the "context"?

564
01:28:01,983 --> 01:28:03,817
I am the context.

565
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,732
- You have to appeal.
- No.

566
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:26,982
But you'll lose everything,
the business, your house.

567
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:29,316
I hate the house.
I always have.

568
01:28:29,317 --> 01:28:30,983
You'll rot in hell!

569
01:28:50,567 --> 01:28:54,067
A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
dourian?

570
01:29:01,067 --> 01:29:02,733
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is? - Yeah.

571
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:07,150
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.

572
01:29:35,983 --> 01:29:39,316
What are they for?
You never ride your bike.

573
01:29:39,317 --> 01:29:42,149
I got these for a song of the web.

574
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,733
I'll make a bundle selling them at school.

575
01:29:45,483 --> 01:29:47,567
Like Donald Trump, huh.

576
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:29,983
I'll take you back to my ship.

577
01:31:41,483 --> 01:31:42,899
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

578
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,149
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

579
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:47,399
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

580
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,649
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

581
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:52,232
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

582
01:31:52,233 --> 01:31:54,149
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

583
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:56,400
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

584
01:31:58,733 --> 01:32:00,233
Ready for the big dip?

585
01:32:04,317 --> 01:32:05,732
<i>1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.</i>

586
01:32:05,733 --> 01:32:07,982
<i>1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.</i>

587
01:32:07,983 --> 01:32:10,317
<i>1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.</i>

588
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:12,483
<i>1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.</i>

589
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,983
<i>I'm charmed to meet you,
young lady</i>

590
01:32:21,233 --> 01:32:23,817
<i>- Yeah.</i>

591
01:32:24,483 --> 01:32:26,000
<i>- Yes, I did.
- Did you eat all your cereal?</i>

592
01:32:26,067 --> 01:32:28,483
<i>-Yes, I did.
-Alright.</i>

593
01:32:36,483 --> 01:32:39,899
You're a little clammy.
Feeling okay?

594
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,817
Never better.

595
01:32:44,567 --> 01:32:48,149
Hey, only three days to go
till you're 16.

596
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:51,316
We should do something.
How about Sunday?

597
01:32:51,317 --> 01:32:53,150
Don't know.

598
01:32:54,067 --> 01:32:55,483
Might be tied up.

599
01:32:57,317 --> 01:33:00,691
Come on, clean up some of this mess
and then we're gonna get dressed and go.

600
01:33:00,692 --> 01:33:02,066
I do not want to go to school.

601
01:33:02,067 --> 01:33:04,899
I know, but daddy has to take a shower,
we have to go.

602
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,817
Say goodbye!

603
01:33:17,233 --> 01:33:20,982
<i>Do you think we could make some time
to talk later, just the two of us,</i>

604
01:33:20,983 --> 01:33:22,399
<i>without the kids?</i>

605
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,983
<i>I really wanna work this thing out.</i>

606
01:33:26,733 --> 01:33:29,233
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?

607
01:34:06,525 --> 01:34:07,899
<i>Franklin...</i>

608
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:11,483
<i>Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...</i>

609
01:34:41,067 --> 01:34:42,400
I have my son there.

610
01:34:44,567 --> 01:34:45,942
Kevin?

611
01:34:47,483 --> 01:34:48,858
Kevin!

612
01:34:52,216 --> 01:34:54,316
Have you seen Kevin?

613
01:34:56,317 --> 01:34:57,650
Kevin!

614
01:34:59,067 --> 01:35:00,400
Kevin!

615
01:36:51,817 --> 01:36:55,150
Lauren!

616
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,525
Franklin?

617
01:38:28,817 --> 01:38:30,233
Celia?

618
01:38:37,483 --> 01:38:39,067
Franklin?

619
01:38:43,233 --> 01:38:44,817
Celia?

620
01:43:34,483 --> 01:43:36,731
You don't look happy.

621
01:43:42,733 --> 01:43:44,233
Have I ever?

622
01:43:48,067 --> 01:43:50,483
I'm almost 18, aren't I?

623
01:43:54,483 --> 01:43:58,983
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?

624
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,900
Nervous?

625
01:44:05,233 --> 01:44:08,150
Do you know anything about
those places?

626
01:44:15,317 --> 01:44:19,817
Well, you managed it all so well.

627
01:44:21,483 --> 01:44:26,650
Tried as a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.

628
01:44:28,483 --> 01:44:30,983
You'll be out of there
in a couple years.

629
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,066
Do you know what day it is today?

630
01:44:40,067 --> 01:44:42,567
Why the let me come see you
on a Monday?

631
01:44:43,483 --> 01:44:47,400
Sure. It's my anniversary.

632
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:51,400
Two years.

633
01:44:53,067 --> 01:44:55,650
Plenty of time to think about it.

634
01:45:09,817 --> 01:45:14,817
I want you to tell me why.

635
01:45:34,983 --> 01:45:36,900
Used to think I knew.

636
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:42,650
Now I'm not so sure.

637
01:46:03,567 --> 01:46:05,233
Time's up.
