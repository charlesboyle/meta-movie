1
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:28,590
<i>The only thing
I ever knew was cotton.</i>

2
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,426
<i>It was hard work.</i>

3
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:40,852
Now, you know cotton is ready
when the bud splits,

4
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,104
and the boll is star-shaped,

5
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,940
like a big ol' star in the sky.

6
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:48,526
Or like your big ol' head.

7
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,570
Hold on, is that some cotton?

8
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,655
Is that cotton?

9
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:54,866
<i>But I didn't mind, </i>

10
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,410
<i>'cause I got to spend all day
working with my daddy.</i>

11
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,580
- Hurry, take this picture.
- Take a picture of y'all.

12
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:02,832
Why don't everybody smile?

13
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,046
Teeth.

14
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,553
Hattie, come on,
I need your help in the shed.

15
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,515
Come on.

16
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:30,527
- Pa... where he taking Ma?
- Get back to work.

17
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,823
Cecil, come back here, boy.

18
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,076
Mama!

19
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,577
Come here.

20
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,454
Look at me, boy.

21
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,706
Don't you lose your temper
with that man.

22
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:47,085
This his world.
We just living in it.

23
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,586
You hear me?

24
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,547
Now, get on back to work.

25
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,873
Pa, what you gonna do?

26
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,129
Hey.

27
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,728
- Dad!

28
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,444
Oh, my Lord.

29
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,747
Who you looking at?! Huh?

30
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:09,042
Who wants to go next?!
You get back to work.

31
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:20,762
Hey, you. Get some of the hands
to help dig a hole for his pa.

32
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:22,639
Hurry up!

33
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:32,148
Stop crying.

34
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:37,403
I'm gonna have you
in the house now.

35
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:46,204
I'm gonna teach you
how to be a house nigger.

36
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,049
- He's coming.
- Yes'm.

37
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,301
And quiet when you're serving.

38
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:03,346
I don't even want
to hear you breathe.

39
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:04,514
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:07,016
<i>The room should feel
empty when you're in it.</i>

41
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:18,152
<i>It was much nicer working
in the house than in the field.</i>

42
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,073
Crazy nigger, from the left.

43
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,664
Give me more.

44
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,549
Hmm.

45
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:03,156
<i>When I got older, I knew
I had to go before he killed me, too.</i>

46
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,414
<i>Part of me was scared to leave.</i>

47
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,333
<i>It was the only world I ever knew.</i>

48
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,304
Ma, I took Pa's watch.

49
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,187
Ma?

50
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,984
Ma, I'm leaving.

51
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:44,072
<i>My mama never
spoke much after that.</i>

52
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,199
<i>I knew she'd miss me, </i>

53
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:50,620
<i>but I also knew she wanted me
to leave that place.</i>

54
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:02,673
<i>And even though
Miss Annabeth never said it, </i>

55
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,384
<i>I knew she'd miss me, too.</i>

56
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,985
<i>I don't think God meant
for people to not have a family.</i>

57
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:35,289
<i>Outside the cotton fields was even worse
than I thought it would be.</i>

58
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,963
<i>No one would give me a job
nor food nor a place to sleep.</i>

59
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,391
<i>Any white man could kill
any of us at any time</i>

60
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:56,602
<i>and not be punished for it.</i>

61
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,397
<i>The law wasn't on our side.</i>

62
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,777
<i>The law was against us.</i>

63
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:14,579
<i>I was hungry all the time.</i>

64
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,484
You know what can happen
to you, son?

65
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,491
Get up.

66
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,417
I said, get up.

67
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:09,133
I'm gonna have to lie
to the boss man about that window.

68
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,386
The good Lord say
we ain't supposed to lie.

69
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,972
Sorry, sir.

70
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:18,392
Where's your ma and your pa?

71
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,854
My ma crazy in the head,
and my pa got killed.

72
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,236
I'll make you
some ham sandwiches

73
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,613
and send you on your way.

74
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,490
The boss will be here
in a minute.

75
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,077
Sunday's our busiest morning.

76
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:41,040
You looking for some help?
I know how to serve.

77
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,711
You done broke our window,
you done stole our food,

78
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,505
and now you asking for a job?

79
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:50,466
Back in Macon,
I'm a house nigger, a good one.

80
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,098
Don't you ever use that word, son.

81
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:59,475
That's the white man's word.

82
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:01,811
It's filled With hate.

83
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:04,563
Didn't your father
ever teach you any better?

84
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,488
- Slow down.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:14,573
You got to look through their eyes.

86
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,703
See what it is they want.

87
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,454
- Got it?
- Strokes.

88
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,999
- Yeah, I got it.
- Here.

89
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,090
See what it is they need.

90
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,468
Right this way.

91
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,595
Anticipate.

92
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,190
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ma'am.

93
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:53,321
Bring a smile to the eyes...

94
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,114
<i>...of your principal.</i>

95
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,082
Perfect. Perfect.

96
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,171
Don't forget to save me them chitlins.

97
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:13,257
- Why you like chitlins so much?
- 'Cause they're good eating.

98
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:19,055
The manager of Excelsior, in DC,
he came by yesterday.

99
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,515
He offered me a job as a butler.

100
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,643
He must be paying you
top dollar, huh, boss?

101
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,563
Yeah.

102
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:31,650
I was thinking about taking it,
but I don't know.

103
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,778
I'm too old to be leaving
North Carolina.

104
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,865
I'm just fine right here.

105
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,786
I told him to hire you.

106
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,705
I'm just now finding my way
around this hotel.

107
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,499
Ain't ready for all them
highfalutin white people,

108
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,250
all their fancy words.

109
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:52,755
ours,

110
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,925
and the ones that we got
to show the white folks.

111
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:59,261
Now, to get up in the world,

112
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,807
you have to make
them feel nonthreatened.

113
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,186
Use that, them fancy words
that I've taught you.

114
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:14,985
White folks up north,
they like some uppity coloreds.

115
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,031
Yeah.

116
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:24,161
<i>I took that job
up in Washington, DC.</i>

117
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:29,041
<i>It was the most beautiful hotel
I'd ever seen.</i>

118
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,966
I hope it wasn't
too presumptuous of me

119
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,552
to have prepared a few spirits

120
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,096
after your long journey here
from Buffalo.

121
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,726
The best decision that court ever
made was to slow this whole mess down.

122
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:52,314
Nigger boys in school with white girls.
Who ever heard of such a thing?

123
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,859
Next thing you know,
they'd be fornicating.

124
00:12:55,693 --> 00:13:00,990
Gentlemen, this here is different.
We could start another Civil War.

125
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:05,494
Cecil, what do you think about niggers
going to school with white children?

126
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,706
To be honest with you,
Mr. Jenkins,

127
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:11,250
I tend to not be too concerned

128
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,670
with American or European politics.

129
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,590
Nor should you, Cecil.
They're all criminals.

130
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:20,426
Earl Warren should be shot
and hanged.

131
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:25,347
That dumb son-of-a-bitch judge
is trying to integrate our schools.

132
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:31,020
I think Judge Warren is going to find
that quite challenging.

133
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,647
Damn right, Cecil. Damn right.

134
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:39,236
<i>Never in my life did I dream
I'd work in a place as fancy as this.</i>

135
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,574
<i>I never dreamed my life
could be so good.</i>

136
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:56,253
<i>Gloria and I met working
at the Excelsior.</i>

137
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,631
<i>She was a maid at the hotel, </i>

138
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,509
<i>but now her only job
was raising our two boys.</i>

139
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:08,265
<i>I made sure that they
never laid eyes on a cotton field.</i>

140
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,147
- I got to pee.
- Not today. Don't try that.

141
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:18,150
- Finish that homework.
- Where Louis at?

142
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,945
- He's taking the trash out.
- Working late again?

143
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,031
- How was your shift?
- Beats working for a living.

144
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,493
I miss you at night, honey.

145
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,291
Didn't you say you got to pee?
Go on, then.

146
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,002
Wash your hands when you come
out of that bathroom, boy.

147
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,507
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

148
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:42,883
Good morning, sir.

149
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,637
Mm-hm.

150
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,933
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Louis.

151
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,894
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

152
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,231
- Good.
- That woman whose son got killed,

153
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:00,901
she's around doing speeches now.
What's her name, honey?

154
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,279
- Mamie Till.
- Mamie...

155
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,781
Mamie Till. Mm.

156
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:09,034
I remember that story just
like it was yesterday,

157
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,537
even though it was three years ago.

158
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,957
It was a dis-damn-grace
what they did to that boy.

159
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,084
Just for looking at a white woman.

160
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,670
Beat him up,

161
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:23,799
threw his body in the river,
killed him.

162
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,802
He wasn't no older than Louis.
He was 14 at the time.

163
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,805
- Crazy white folks down South.
- Thanks, Ma.

164
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,974
At least we got it
a little better in DC, huh?

165
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,560
Still treating us bad, too.

166
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,062
Get on down here, Charlie!
Wash your hands.

167
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,981
Louis said we should stop
taking the white man's shit.

168
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,274
- Hey.
- Shut up.

169
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,067
- Watch your mouth.
- Watch your mouth.

170
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:45,529
Hello, Gaines' residence.

171
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,741
Uh, yeah. Hold on, Mr. Kidgan.

172
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,870
- It's the boss man, Dad.
- What's he calling for?

173
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:57,583
<i>When the white man call,
I always assume the worst.</i>

174
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,168
Yes, sir?

175
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,086
<i>I would have put money on it</i>

176
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:04,506
<i>that I was getting laid off
or something that day.</i>

177
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,994
- Would you follow me, please?
- Yes, sir.

178
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,754
I'm Cecil Gaines.

179
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,714
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You, as well.

180
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,800
Have a seat.

181
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,691
Are you political, Mr. Gaines?

182
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,984
- No, sir.
- Good.

183
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:11,407
We have no tolerance
for politics at the White House.

184
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,493
- How'd you find me?
- I didn't.

185
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,538
You served R.D. Warner
at the Excelsior Hotel.

186
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,207
He oversees operations
for the entire White House.

187
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:23,377
- You made quite an impression.
- I don't recall.

188
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,923
Mr. Warner and myself make note
of potential staff around town.

189
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,008
Butler positions rarely open,

190
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,802
as most stay on for 30 years or more.

191
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,513
I know I was quite surprised
when I got the call.

192
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,104
It was a surprise
for me, as well.

193
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:46,525
As the White House maître d',
I normally hire the butler.

194
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,572
Forgive me for saying this,
Mr. Fallows.

195
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,491
I certainly wouldn't want to
be hired under circumstances

196
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,369
that would make you
feel uncomfortable.

197
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,247
Oh, really?

198
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,833
You need butlers
that you've handpicked,

199
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,753
men to your liking
that will fulfill your vision

200
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,880
of a proper White House staff.

201
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,467
Hmm.

202
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,067
Is that... Louis XIII?

203
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,904
These decanters are replicas

204
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,452
of metal flasks that were found
on the battlefield in Jarnac.

205
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,537
Correct?

206
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,748
The Italians, they
know their wines,

207
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,668
and the Irish, they certainly know
how to make a great whiskey.

208
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,964
But I believe the French
have a distinct advantage

209
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,926
when it comes to Cognac.

210
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,554
<i>C'est vrai?</i>

211
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,893
Yeah, you'll make
a good house nigger.

212
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,898
Would you care
for a demitasse?

213
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,863
Sometimes it just be
me and Faye up in here.

214
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,825
Me, Faye
and a little scotch.

215
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,702
Have a good time.

216
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,250
That's how you do it.

217
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,960
You know how to throw
a bash, girl.

218
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,003
What did you do
to this potato salad?

219
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,256
I'll tell you what I did.
I put some dill in it,

220
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:36,343
because I read in Woman's Day,
where pickles drown out the flavor

221
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,262
and dill bring up the flavor.

222
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,765
- That's what you tasting right now.
- OK. Yeah.

223
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,518
- I like it.
- Make a difference, don't it?

224
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,978
It really does.

225
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,605
Girl, you must be so proud of Cecil.

226
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,358
You know he got that job hisself.
The White House called him,

227
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,819
- he didn't call the White House.
- He's a good man.

228
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,321
- You got a good man.
- She's fun, man!

229
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,324
Not like this one right here.
OI' sourpuss.

230
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,828
- You still mad at me?
- I got reason.

231
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:06,248
No, you don't. I told you,
I went down to the numbers spot,

232
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,542
played my little numbers,
got me some barbecue,

233
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,628
and then I went down...
I didn't even get nothing to drink!

234
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:16,174
I am so... I'm so sick of these
numbers spot stories, Howard.

235
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,677
How you expect me to believe you
was down at the numbers spot?

236
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,554
Whether you believe it
or not don't mean it ain't true.

237
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,598
- Come on, stop this mess.
- You want to do this right now?

238
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,349
Come on, y'all.
Come on, come on, come on.

239
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,435
You don't believe it, you don't
have to believe it, but...

240
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,811
- Come on, y'all.
- Such a shuckster.

241
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,688
- You really want to do this right now?
- Stop this right now.

242
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,648
You need to pick on
somebody your own size.

243
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,234
We are here to celebrate,
so y'all could be nice just one time.

244
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,029
You heard the lady.
Come on, get over here, let's celebrate!

245
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,405
Celebrate.

246
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,741
That's why I was out,
trying to make you happy.

247
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,994
- Y'all need to get a room.
- What? What?

248
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,288
Ain't that the truth?
Or something.

249
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,916
He drives me crazy. He just... Ugh!

250
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,628
You ain't, uh...
You want to come to the room with us?

251
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,588
No.

252
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,841
- Hey, where the boys at?
- They upstairs in the back room.

253
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,969
Boys! Get on down here!
I need to see your face now!

254
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,597
- What y'all doing up there?
- Yes, congratulations.

255
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,599
Honey, when you gonna take me
to the White House?

256
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,352
You want to go
to the White House, baby?

257
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,520
You know I want to go
to the White House.

258
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,230
When you want to go?

259
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,566
- Don't play with me now...
- When you want to go?

260
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,818
The White House,
now that's a big step up.

261
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,779
- Ooh!
- Yeah, it's exciting.

262
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,699
Girl, you up in that house now!
I want to hear all the stories.

263
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,993
I don't know how many stories
you gonna hear,

264
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,829
'cause they done swore him
to some kind of secret code,

265
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:31,541
- and he can't tell me nothing.
- No. Girl, you give it to him right.

266
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,045
- Mm-hm! He'll tell you everything.
- That's the key right there.

267
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,797
You listening?

268
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,174
- Did you hear her?
- Who you been giving it to?

269
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,843
Well, if you was at home,
I could be giving it to you.

270
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,345
I don't know
what you talking about.

271
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:46,640
Boys, y'all better bring
y'all little narrow butts down here!

272
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,976
- Here they come.
- Called y'all 19 times.

273
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,228
Boys, stop running through this house.
You know better than that.

274
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:56,191
Elroy! Get over here.
Come here.

275
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:59,903
Give me some money.

276
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,324
Nah. Tell them... Tell them what
you gonna be when you grow up.

277
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,619
I want to work at the White
House just like Mr. Gaines.

278
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,579
- Ah, that's my boy.
- Right there.

279
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,123
All right, man.

280
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,750
Louis! What you gonna be
when you grow up?

281
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,544
You gonna work at
the White House like your daddy?

282
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:20,882
- I don't know.
- I'll tell you one thing.

283
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,719
I knew exactly what I wanted
to be when I was 13.

284
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,471
Yeah, a number runner.

285
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,896
I'm Cecil Gaines.
I'm the new butler.

286
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,232
Yes, sir.

287
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,609
<i>There are 16 full-time maids.</i>

288
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,487
<i>We have six butlers,
four carpenters, two painters, </i>

289
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,073
<i>seven electricians,
three dishwashers, three doormen, </i>

290
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,368
<i>a full kitchen staff, including pastry
chef and three full-time calligraphers.</i>

291
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,371
Two painters, seven
electricians, nine engineers...

292
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,707
Here comes Warner.

293
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:57,836
Uh, Mr. Warner, wanted to thank you
for the opportunity

294
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,713
to work in the White House...

295
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,305
Come on. Here we go.

296
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,852
Ma'am, I'm Cecil Gaines.
I'll be working with you here.

297
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,979
Mr. Gaines,
please don't do that.

298
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,981
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

299
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,568
Now, when lifting a plate,
never scrape the bottom.

300
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,988
Never listen
or react to conversation.

301
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:28,700
- The room should feel as...
- Empty when I'm in it.

302
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,496
So then she says...

303
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,292
Then she says, "Stick..."

304
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,336
"OK."

305
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,713
Then she starts
screaming and yells,

306
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,342
"Stick your whole hand in!"
So I put my whole hand in.

307
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,803
Then she yells out,
"Put both hands in!"

308
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,722
"OK!"

309
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,682
Then she screams,
"Now clap!"

310
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,018
I say, "I can't."

311
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,020
She looks up, smiles and says,

312
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,940
"See, I told you my..."

313
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,691
That ain't funny.

314
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,527
Hey, there he is!
Heard you were coming.

315
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,153
- What's your name?
- Cecil.

316
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,072
- Cecil Gaines.
- That ain't funny.

317
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,867
I'm Carter Wilson, head butler.
Don't worry about Big Mo behind you.

318
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,078
That brother will steal your wallet
before you even knew it.

319
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,956
This brother in the mirror over here,
his name's James Holloway.

320
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,624
- He's my second in command.
- James.

321
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,668
Jackie Robinson or Willie Mays?

322
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,044
Why don't you shake
the man's hand first

323
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,296
before you start asking difficult
questions like that?

324
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,132
I just want to know
where the man's coming from.

325
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:27,592
Look like the jury's still
out on that one, right?

326
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,011
Welcome.
Fancy Freddie give you the tour yet?

327
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,306
He did.
Is the Dodgers still... still losing?

328
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,809
I might be able to answer that question
if Carter over here

329
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,519
stop running his nasty mouth.

330
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,980
Cut the shit
and let's get to work.

331
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,963
- Ready.
- Lord, help us.

332
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:20,645
Don't be nervous, man.
Just go on and get to it.

333
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,407
You hear nothing,
you see nothing.

334
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,284
You only serve.

335
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,806
Send federal troops to Little Rock?

336
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,433
If it comes to it, yes.

337
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:04,439
I can't see any situation where
I'd send federal troops to the South.

338
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:08,777
Ever. Could cause another Civil War.

339
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:14,699
Sir, if the federal government
doesn't enforce Brown, then who will?

340
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,493
The South must comply with the law.

341
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,329
It's just gonna take some time
to adjust, that's all.

342
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,373
I understand, Mr. President,

343
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,502
but if Faubus continues to block the
Negro children, then what do we do?

344
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,420
We must enforce
the Constitution.

345
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,548
Give Faubus more time.

346
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,384
With a little persuading,
he'll back down.

347
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,469
We just want to move slowly.

348
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,770
- How'd it go?
- I almost shit myself.

349
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:49,067
I dated a girl once. Every time
I hit her, she shit herself.

350
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:52,654
- What?
- Got no sense.

351
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,864
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

352
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,408
I put a towel down.

353
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,662
<i>You know, Marcella said
the very same thing last night</i>

354
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,414
<i>just before I put her to sleep.</i>

355
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:12,299
<i>- Wow. You put her...
- Just like I did Ed.</i>

356
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,844
<i>I'd do it real quick.</i>

357
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,600
<i>- See you!
- Why?</i>

358
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,439
Dang...
Got the popcorn all over the sofa.

359
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,190
Your dad's gonna kill...

360
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,401
Hey, Dad.

361
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,736
- Hi, Mr. Gaines.
- Hey, Dad.

362
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,196
Hey, Elroy.

363
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,616
Louis, I told you about letting these
kids watch that show.

364
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,994
It's too scary.
They're too young for it.

365
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,495
Turn it off.

366
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,956
<i>All you got to do is smile pretty, </i>

367
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,624
<i>and a man will forget
everything he ever learned.</i>

368
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,376
Where your mama at?

369
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,129
Miss Gloria tried staying up,
but she went to sleep.

370
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,131
Elroy, ain't nobody
asked you nothing.

371
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,966
Take your butt home before
your mama come up in here

372
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,259
and whup the both of us.

373
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,594
- Come on, Dad.
- Go on.

374
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,262
- Bye.
- Turn it off.

375
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,898
Don't go stomping up the stairs,
wake your mama up.

376
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,159
What is that?

377
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:24,245
Is that that Mamie Till stuff?

378
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:27,582
- I want to go to this.
- Absolutely not.

379
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,837
How come?

380
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,257
Ain't no good can come of that.

381
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,343
Dad, you heard what Mama said?

382
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,636
That mess right there
happened down South.

383
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:42,555
- This could have been me.
- It happened down South.

384
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,849
I got out of there so we
could have us a better life.

385
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:48,019
Right now, I'm working for the white
man, make things better for us.

386
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,938
And not just any white man, either.

387
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,482
Put the lights off.
Go to bed.

388
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,294
I have your chicken soup,
Mr. President.

389
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,130
Just set it on the table, Cecil.

390
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,506
Yes, sir.

391
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:23,471
Did you ever complete school, Cecil?

392
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:26,266
I didn't go to school,
Mr. President.

393
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,643
I grew up on a cotton farm.

394
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,146
I grew up on a farm.

395
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,523
Do you have any children?

396
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,525
Yes, sir, I have two sons.

397
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,110
Do they go
to an all-colored school?

398
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,738
Yes, sir, they do.

399
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,122
What is it?

400
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,249
State Guard just blocked
all the colored kids again.

401
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,210
Faubus promised me the guards
would escort the kids in.

402
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,546
Governor of Arkansas lied,
Mr. President.

403
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:00,550
What is wrong with him?
Why is he forcing me to do this?

404
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,724
Yes, sir.

405
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,852
Our next move
needs to be bold and swift.

406
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:18,276
<i>I have today
issued an executive order</i>

407
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,613
<i>directing the use of troops
under federal authority</i>

408
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,408
<i>to aid in the execution
of federal law</i>

409
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,161
<i>at Little Rock, Arkansas.</i>

410
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,121
<i>This became necessary...</i>

411
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:33,041
<i>When the president
sent those troops down to Little Rock, </i>

412
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:38,004
<i>it was the first time I ever seen a
white man stick his neck out for us.</i>

413
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:43,301
<i>I told Louis that the president was
gonna make things better for us.</i>

414
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:48,097
All graduations are long.
She was so nosy.

415
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,183
I'm gonna make
some potato salad.

416
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,644
<i>Now he could see that I knew
what I was talking about.</i>

417
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,021
That was wonderful.
I'm so proud of you.

418
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:58,858
- Thanks, Mama.
- That hat looks stupid.

419
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,777
Your face looks stupid.

420
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:06,950
- Proud of you, too.
- Dad, did you see...

421
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,952
Don't start something in there.

422
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,039
Did you see one white kid
in my school?

423
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:25,385
<i>Why couldn't Louis see that
the president made things better for us?</i>

424
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,929
- Thank you.
- Cookie?

425
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,681
- Cookies.
- Thanks.

426
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,599
Thank you.

427
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,067
Boy, I told you
we was gonna be late!

428
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,819
You cannot miss this bus!

429
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,905
- Oh, Lord have mercy.
- Wait, a sec. Wait, wait, wait.

430
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,700
- What?
- Got to say good-bye.

431
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,202
Bus can wait.

432
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:58,334
Tennessee is
a long ways away, Pop.

433
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,837
Fisk is a really
good school, Dad.

434
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,423
You can change your mind
and go to Howard.

435
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,218
I cannot believe you are still
talking about Howard University.

436
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:11,347
- He's going to Fisk.
- I know, I know. It's just...

437
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,891
It's just so far away, that's all.

438
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,853
- That's the point.
- What's the point?

439
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,690
Give me a cigarette, and don't
tell me you don't smoke.

440
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:23,526
- I don't have one.
- Come here.

441
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:27,322
- You know you want to cry, punk.
- Not for you.

442
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,366
Look under your mattress.
I left you something.

443
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:34,120
- I can't protect him down South.
- The South has changed, Cecil.

444
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,538
I'm too young for Playboy.

445
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:36,956
The South ain't what it
was when you was there.

446
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,876
Ma, Louis is leaving me
his filthy magazines.

447
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,878
- Stop lying on your brother.
- Why you slapping him?

448
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,671
He's the one with the magazines.

449
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:47,091
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, son.

450
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,177
- I love you, Louis.
- I love you.

451
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,722
- I made you ham sandwiches.
- Thanks, Mama.

452
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,100
Come on, Dad.

453
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:01,064
OK.

454
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,906
You're the first.

455
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:14,077
I know.

456
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:15,995
I'm really proud of you.

457
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,706
I got to go, Dad.

458
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:27,340
I got to go.

459
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,263
If you need anything, you call me.

460
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,224
- All right.
- All right?

461
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,850
Bye, Mama.

462
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:46,317
Bye, Louis.

463
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,161
It's all right.

464
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,589
Remind me again why
we're doing this, please.

465
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:11,592
Somebody? Tell me?
That look like a mugging to me,

466
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,178
- that's what that looks like.
- This is the art of French baking.

467
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:17,640
Negro, please.
"Art of French baking."

468
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,851
This is absolutely nothing.
That's what this is.

469
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,645
- I don't...
- Boy's always so simple.

470
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,647
You want me to play with it?
I'll play with it.

471
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:26,566
Play With it like this.

472
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,610
It'd be good if it had a little...
a little nipple on it.

473
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,028
Come on, man.

474
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,239
That's how you play. You jiggle it.
You shake it, you know.

475
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,699
This fool.

476
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:37,702
Good evening,
Mr. Vice President.

477
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:42,457
That looks like a tasty treat.

478
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,542
Yes, sir.

479
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,544
I brought you all something.

480
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:53,009
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

481
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:54,886
I don't want to say anything negative

482
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:58,264
about that Kennedy boy.
I'm sure he's a real nice fellow.

483
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:01,350
But do you really want that
spoiled rich son-of-a-bitch fuck

484
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,936
to be your next president?

485
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:07,398
Think about it.

486
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,822
We'll cheer for you,
Mr. Vice President.

487
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,741
Thank you, Cecil.

488
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:22,371
Let me ask you something,
in all candor,

489
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:26,876
as members of the Negro community,
what are your biggest concerns?

490
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,840
Now, come on now, boys.

491
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,301
Don't be shy.

492
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,431
Holloway, come on.

493
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:44,268
- Well, since you asked, sir...
- I did.

494
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:48,397
The colored help gets paid almost
40 percent less than the white help.

495
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,608
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

496
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:54,612
And it's very difficult for
the colored staff to be promoted.

497
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:59,116
I'll tell you what. When I'm president,
I'm gonna look into getting you boys

498
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,035
the raises and
the promotions you deserve.

499
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:04,288
That... that would be swell, sir.

500
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:08,251
- You got my word on that.
- Thank you, sir.

501
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,169
Now, you tell your people
to vote for me,

502
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:11,546
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

503
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:14,465
Give that to somebody.

504
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:41,993
What do you mean, you don't
want to date nobody?

505
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,327
After all these guys
that come after you?

506
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:46,914
- Girl, please. I'm just...
- Like that one?

507
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,876
I'm talking about you and Isaac.

508
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,335
Now, come on,
tell me what happened.

509
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:53,129
Y'all seemed happy.

510
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,965
See, I can't even have a normal
conversation with you, because...

511
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:07,310
- Hey.
- You looking for love, boy?

512
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:13,482
That's what we call the Lawson workshop,
the love school.

513
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:17,445
- Is that what you're looking for?
- That's why I came to Fisk.

514
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,115
Me, too.

515
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:28,789
- I'm Carol Hammie.
- Louis Gaines.

516
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,958
Come on. Follow me.

517
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,338
You a country boy, ain't you?

518
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,632
He's a doctor.
What does your dad do?

519
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,676
He's in politics.

520
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,346
You were gonna need help
finding this place anyway.

521
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,222
...nor can you sustain it
over a month.

522
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,600
- Really?
- This requires time, commitment,

523
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,185
dedication, discipline and focus.

524
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:52,396
And we are measuring our
accomplishments in waves, right?

525
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,774
This is not a fly-by-night affair.
This doesn't happen over a week.

526
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:58,194
This requires a fierce discipline,
which is what we've been discussing.

527
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:00,154
How do you measure these things?

528
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,740
We go back, and we look
at somebody like Gandhi.

529
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:05,701
Together, we are gonna study
and examine Gandhi's techniques.

530
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,788
What has been so effective
in South Africa, so effective in India,

531
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:11,457
for his own people and others,

532
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:14,460
and we're gonna employ it
right here, in Nashville.

533
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:18,255
So we're gonna form an army.
You and I.

534
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:21,258
This army has one weapon.
That weapon is love.

535
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,177
Now, I am of the... yes.

536
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:25,513
If our only weapon is love,

537
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,848
and then their weapons
are weapons,

538
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:31,519
- I mean, isn't that dangerous?
- Oh, you can be killed.

539
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,896
If anybody's uncomfortable with that,
you know where the door is.

540
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,983
I understand that sounds
provocative, but it's true.

541
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:42,530
All right, kids.
It's show time.

542
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:05,428
Gandhi has demonstrated for us
that the brown man,

543
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,222
in his native land, or anywhere
that he's being oppressed...

544
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,143
<i>...can pull himself out
of segregation</i>

545
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,812
with patience, with persistence,

546
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:17,648
with intelligence and thought,
with discipline...

547
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,155
<i>...and a bit
of a sense of humor.</i>

548
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,374
<i>You know y'all can't sit here.</i>

549
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,752
We would like to be served, please.

550
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,588
<i>This is unprecedented,
what we're talking about, </i>

551
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:43,841
<i>but it needs a patience
that none of us have ever seen.</i>

552
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:45,885
You can order food
in the colored section,

553
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:48,095
but I'm not gonna be
serving you here.

554
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:51,724
We are organized.
We have a leader with every group.

555
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:54,435
<i>We have lookouts
with pocket change</i>

556
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,270
<i>and the local phone numbers
for ambulances ready, </i>

557
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:59,356
<i>and when one wave comes
off that lunch counter, what follows?</i>

558
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,192
<i>A whole 'nother wave
of Negro students</i>

559
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,319
<i>sitting at that lunch counter,
blowing their mind.</i>

560
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,780
We would like
to be served, please.

561
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,036
<i>Now, who wants to role-play?</i>

562
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,497
Jim, I need your help over here.

563
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:16,499
Now, y'all know you're
not supposed to sit there.

564
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,460
- Attack.
- Get up, nigger! Get up!

565
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:21,045
This is an experiment.

566
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,380
So do whatever it takes
to break their spirits.

567
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,674
- Come on, get up, nigger.
- Use the language.

568
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,134
I need to hear "nigger" coming
out of your mouth.

569
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:29,011
- I need to hear "coon."
- I don't feel comfortable saying that.

570
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:31,806
You came here to get yourself prepared
and to get her prepared.

571
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,891
So let me hear it now.

572
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,228
- Nigger.
- Louder.

573
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:38,979
Say the words like you mean it.

574
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,940
- Nigger.
- Louder.

575
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:42,233
You are a nigger!

576
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,028
You need to be sitting
in the colored seating.

577
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,155
This is not for you,
you cannot be served here.

578
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,449
You need to do as you're told
and sit in your place.

579
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,618
- You are a nigger.
- Make her believe it.

580
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,328
- I don't believe you.
- You're a nigger.

581
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,621
You know that's where
the colored people sit.

582
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:59,208
You see these people over here?
They're in their section over here.

583
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,753
You coon ass!
Get up, you nigger!

584
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,048
If you want us to shop
in this establishment, make them go.

585
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,925
Come on, Robert, let's go.

586
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,402
Nigger lover, get out!

587
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:28,612
- Get up, monkey. Get up!
- What is this?

588
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:31,615
Are you listening to us?

589
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:34,285
This says "whites only."

590
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,912
Get up, nigger. Get up!

591
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,335
- Coons here?
- What are you doing here?

592
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:44,837
- Does it say "coons?"
- "Whites only."

593
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:50,176
<i>You don't belong here with them.
This? What is this, huh?</i>

594
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,761
- Does it say "coons" here, huh?
- What are you doing here?

595
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,472
- Pay attention.
- No, this is whites only.

596
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,142
<i>You don't belong here at all.</i>

597
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,895
What are you reading?
I didn't know niggers could read.

598
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,605
What are you, stupid?
You're a nigger lover now?

599
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,690
Get up, you nigger!
Look at me!

600
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,859
- Look at me!
- What are you doing?

601
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:10,029
You disrespectful monkey. Huh?

602
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,114
Do you understand?
You understand?

603
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:13,657
Stop it! Stop it!

604
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:16,118
What do you think you're doing here?

605
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:21,582
Get up! Get up, you nigger!
Look at me! Look at me!

606
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:23,709
That up there or is that here?

607
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:28,464
You don't have to tell me,

608
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,507
- but you have to decide.
- I was a nigger.

609
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:45,731
- Go back to where you came from!
- Here, you want some coffee?

610
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,712
<i>...the niggers are better
off in their own schools</i>

611
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,214
<i>than they are in the white schools.</i>

612
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:12,841
- To serving our country.
- Serving our country.

613
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,260
My man.

614
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:26,689
I feel rich right now.
I like the way that tastes.

615
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,169
<i>They got no business out here.</i>

616
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:50,754
<i>...better off in their
own schools than they are</i>

617
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:52,423
<i>in the white schools.</i>

618
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:59,013
You're all sentenced to 30 days

619
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,597
- in the county jail.
- What?

620
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:03,434
Bailiff, get these
niggers out of here.

621
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:28,876
Something special
is going on down here, Dad.

622
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:35,257
What's so special about
another colored man in jail?

623
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:40,679
What you doing
with my hard earned money, Pop?

624
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,056
Are you even in school?

625
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,474
I'm trying to change
the way Negroes...

626
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,225
You're breaking the law.

627
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:49,688
That judge just sentenced you
to 30 days in the county workhouse.

628
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:51,607
You fixing to get killed.

629
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:53,192
If I can't sit at any
lunch counter I want,

630
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,985
then I might as well be dead.

631
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:57,112
- We're fighting for our rights.
- Rights?

632
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:58,530
- What are you talking about?
- We're trying to change

633
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,074
the nation's consciousness
toward the American Negro.

634
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,492
Them postcards you've been sending me?

635
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,535
- You're a damn liar.
- I have been in school.

636
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,499
Who do you think you're talking to?

637
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,876
I brought you into this world,
I can take you out of it.

638
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:47,329
- Y'all been able to talk to him?
- Talk to who?

639
00:45:47,496 --> 00:45:50,457
- Louis.
- Yeah, we talk to him.

640
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:54,128
Said he's joined something
called the "Freedom Riders,"

641
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:56,839
whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

642
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:58,382
You gonna see him?

643
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:00,551
I been fixing to trying to see him.

644
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:02,845
Every time I do,
Cecil get all riled up.

645
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,972
So I don't know when
that's gonna happen.

646
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:07,474
"Fixing to trying."
See, that's the problem.

647
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:10,561
You got to stop trying,
and you just got to do it.

648
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:12,771
He take you
to the White House yet?

649
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:17,067
No. Cecil say we're going soon.

650
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:19,820
"Cecil say, Cecil say."

651
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:23,615
Four years. That's what makes
you a little bit gullible, darling.

652
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:25,909
I don't understand.
I don't understand why he can't

653
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:28,370
- get the president to do something.
- See, Gina, that's your problem.

654
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:30,747
You just say stupid stuff.

655
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:35,127
President got more to do than be
thinking about Louis' foolishness.

656
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,964
You know,
why don't you just shut up?

657
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:42,468
It's just a mess.
Be nice.

658
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:45,596
Who told you
you could tell me to shut up?

659
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:47,764
- Well... You...
- Go get me a drink.

660
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,475
I want some scotch.

661
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:56,023
Well, I personally think Louis is
gonna get every one of us killed.

662
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,859
They coming to get us.
They coming to get us.

663
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:02,362
He crazy like his mama.

664
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,490
I meant it in a good way.

665
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:09,203
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.

666
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:11,246
Get back over here.

667
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:13,373
Let me get your ass.

668
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,921
<i>I received also a wire from
President Eisenhower, which says...</i>

669
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,132
<i>The president lives
at the White House</i>

670
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:25,552
<i>until the moment the next one
is sworn in.</i>

671
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:28,388
<i>So the staff has exactly two hours</i>

672
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:33,268
<i>during the inauguration ceremony,
to move the old president out</i>

673
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,771
<i>and move the new one in.</i>

674
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:40,609
They say
this new white boy's smooth.

675
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:42,945
I just need to get my
butt home to Gloria.

676
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,614
'Cause these hours,
they're killing us.

677
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:47,366
How's your boy doing, Cecil?

678
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:50,577
Gentlemen, the president's arriving.

679
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,792
- OK.
- Where shall we start?

680
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:58,418
I'm not sure.
This end, maybe over there?

681
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:00,045
- Thank you.
- Right this way, Mr. President.

682
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:03,006
- Hello, everyone.
- Mr. President.

683
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:06,301
I am thrilled to be
working with all of you

684
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:08,178
over the next four years.

685
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:10,847
Eight years, Jack.

686
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:13,684
Well, you see who wears
the pants around here.

687
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:17,896
I'm not gonna remember any
of your names, but I'm gonna try.

688
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:20,107
Jessie. It's a good thing you're here
'cause I'm gonna forget.

689
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:23,026
- Thank you. This is Lorraine.
- Pleasure to meet you.

690
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:24,653
- Mr. President.
- How are you, James?

691
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,821
- Carter.
- Pleasure, Mr. President.

692
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:27,531
- Carter.
- This is Cecil.

693
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:29,157
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr. President.
- How are you?

694
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:30,492
- William.
- Mrs. Kennedy.

695
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,578
- Greg.
- How are you?

696
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:33,912
Winslow.

697
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,164
I got it. She's all right.

698
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:39,084
Pleasure to meet you,
Miss Caroline.

699
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:40,460
- Miles.
- Miles.

700
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:44,840
What's that on your breath,
Gloria? Stop, OK. Stop.

701
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:46,675
- What's that?
- Baby, that's gin.

702
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:49,678
- I can smell it from here.
- It said "Addison's disease."

703
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:51,138
Stop. Stop it, will you stop?

704
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:53,515
Did you take Charlie
to the dentist today?

705
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,646
Somebody at the White House
got Addison's disease?

706
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:05,235
No, I did not take Charlie
to the dentist today.

707
00:49:05,402 --> 00:49:08,196
And what you asking me about it for?
You never home.

708
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:10,866
Now you gonna act like you gonna
take Charlie to the dentist?

709
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:13,952
You ain't never here.
I don't know how you gonna take him.

710
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,496
His teeth fall out,
waiting on you to take him.

711
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:20,917
Just go to bed, Gloria.
I'll take him tomorrow.

712
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,629
How many pairs of shoes
does she have?

713
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:30,302
I said, how many pairs of shoes
does Mrs. Jackie Kennedy have?

714
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,554
How the hell do I know?

715
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:39,061
You're in that ol' White House
day and night.

716
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:40,979
Thought you knew everything.

717
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:46,943
Coming in,
trying to tell me what to do.

718
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,821
Worried about me drinking.

719
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:52,366
You ought to be worried
about your house.

720
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:54,993
Our boy's in jail, Cecil.

721
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,914
Our boy's in jail,
and you can't come home.

722
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:03,251
You... You don't see I'm here,
trying to talk to you?

723
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:09,841
I bet you wish I spoke French,
just like Jackie.

724
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:12,469
Jackie Kennedy.

725
00:50:12,636 --> 00:50:15,430
Que sera, sera.

726
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:19,476
You like that?

727
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:21,436
You like the way she talk?

728
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:24,981
Cecil,
you hear me talking to you.

729
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,859
You ain't asleep.

730
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:46,837
<i>Bobby told the president</i>

731
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:49,631
<i>they shouldn't be worried about
the Negro sit-ins.</i>

732
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:53,176
<i>Polls show the US
does not support civil rights.</i>

733
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:57,097
Told you that white boy was smooth.
A little too smooth for my money.

734
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:06,940
- Hey, Cecil, how's your boy doing?
- Out of jail, says he's back in school,

735
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:09,276
but I think he's doing
that freedom riding thing.

736
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:11,737
How's Gloria doing
with that drinking?

737
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,781
She's hanging.

738
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:21,121
They say that cat
that's playing is a big deal.

739
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:25,083
- Pablo Casals, world famous.
- Course he's world famous.

740
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,002
You think Mrs. Kennedy
is gonna have, uh...

741
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:29,463
some backwoods country fiddle
band playing out there for her?

742
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,006
- Man.
- Why don't you start a band?

743
00:51:31,173 --> 00:51:32,758
Maybe you can go out there, too.

744
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,051
You know what, in fact,
let's all start a band.

745
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:37,012
I'll play the bongos.
What about you?

746
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:39,473
I play a mean... skin flute.

747
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,563
He refuses to play in any country
that recognizes Franco's regime.

748
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,607
Who's Franco?

749
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,736
- Forget it, man.
- Huh?

750
00:51:52,903 --> 00:51:55,989
Forget it. You're ignorant.

751
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:09,503
Carol, are you tired?

752
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:12,214
You just want me to put my head
on your shoulder.

753
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,590
What wrong with that?

754
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:14,966
I'm not putting my head
on your shoulder.

755
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,134
You can.

756
00:52:19,513 --> 00:52:20,764
Ever been
on a freedom bus before?

757
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:22,224
- No, it's my first time.
- No?

758
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,267
- How's your boyfriend feel about that?
- My boyfriend?

759
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:28,146
Yeah. I mean,
this must upset him, right?

760
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:29,981
You being on this bus down here.

761
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:32,234
- I don't have a boyfriend.
- You don't have a boyfriend?

762
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,444
How do you not have a boyfriend?

763
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,826
- You want some peanuts?
- No, thank you.

764
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,453
- You like peanuts or...?
- I don't like peanuts.

765
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,248
- I'm too hot to eat.
- Hey, can I have some of those?

766
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,708
- Long bus ride.
- OK.

767
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:56,675
Louis, what is that?

768
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:06,560
- It's a cross. It's a cross.
- Driver, turn! Turn the bus!

769
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:11,356
Oh, shit.

770
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:20,240

771

Nigger, go home!
Nigger, go home!

Everybody out!

exploded today.

00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:19,205
Why do you think God brought us
next to each other each day?

839
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:22,208
- God ain't got nothing to do with this.
- He put you right next door to me.

840
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,836
You always talking about how
lonely you are without Cecil

841
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:27,338
being at the White House,
and you need a man that can

842
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:30,758
appreciate the love and the
woman that you are, like I do.

843
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:33,511
I want your number-running
ass up out of my house,

844
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:36,347
off of my sofa right now.

845
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:39,726
I'm... I'm through.
I told you.

846
00:58:39,893 --> 00:58:41,394
Let me make
a demonstration for you.

847
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,479
Don't come here with
this bullshit crazy talk.

848
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,356
- It's not.
- Some more of this...

849
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:47,859
This is you, right? You got
your direction that you move in.

850
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:52,572
- What you doing with my hangers?
- This is you, and this is me.

851
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:56,034
Now, we seem like we don't fit at all.
We just crash into each other.

852
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:59,621
But then when
you align things properly,

853
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:01,664
like God putting you
next door to me,

854
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:05,126
everything kind of works out.

855
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:09,130
And even if you slow down,
I got you.

856
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:12,800
You need to get your yellow
ass up out of my house.

857
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:15,678
- We need each other.
- What I need is my husband.

858
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:18,556
And not to be laying up here
in the gutter with you.

859
00:59:30,443 --> 00:59:33,404
On average, how many pills do
you think I take a day, Cecil?

860
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:38,159
About... 103, sir.

861
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:44,791
- Help me up.
- Mr. President.

862
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:54,384
I know your son is a Freedom Ryder.

863
00:59:57,136 --> 01:00:00,765
He's in prison right now in Birmingham
with Martin Luther King.

864
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,107
Do you, uh...

865
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,360
...you know how he is, sir?

866
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:16,948
I'm guessing he's pretty beat up,
but based on his record,

867
01:00:17,115 --> 01:00:19,033
he must be used to it.

868
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:25,164
Cecil, he's been arrested 16 times
over the past two years.

869
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,585
Yes, sir.

870
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:37,093
- Will that be all, sir?
- That's it.

871
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:42,640
You know, I never understood

872
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,684
what you all really went through...

873
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:48,521
...until I saw that.

874
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:53,776
My brother says these kids have...

875
01:00:56,154 --> 01:00:57,822
...changed his heart.

876
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,621
They've changed mine, too.

877
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,379
<i>The fires of discord are burning
in every city North and South, </i>

878
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:16,257
<i>where legal remedies
are not at hand.</i>

879
01:01:16,424 --> 01:01:17,884
<i>Redress is sought in the streets, </i>

880
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:21,679
<i>in demonstrations,
parades and protests.</i>

881
01:01:21,846 --> 01:01:24,098
<i>I am therefore
asking the Congress</i>

882
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:26,142
<i>to enact legislation</i>

883
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:29,187
giving all Americans the right
to be served in facilities

884
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:30,688
which are open to the public.

885
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:33,608
<i>Hotels, restaurants, theaters, </i>

886
01:01:33,775 --> 01:01:36,778
<i>retail stores
and similar establishments.</i>

887
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:40,198
<i>This seems to me to be
an elementary right.</i>

888
01:01:40,365 --> 01:01:42,658
<i>Its denial is
an arbitrary indignity</i>

889
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:47,163
<i>that no American in 1963
should have to endure, but many do.</i>

890
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,832
<i>A great change is at hand.</i>

891
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:54,253
<i>And our task, our obligation,
is to make that revolution, </i>

892
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:59,300
<i>that change,
peaceful and constructive for all.</i>

893
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:03,596
<i>Those who do nothing are
inviting shame as well as violence...</i>

894
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:30,248
Hey. Hey, Cecil.
Cecil, what's wrong?

895
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:34,919
Cecil?

896
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:39,340
Cecil?

897
01:02:40,842 --> 01:02:42,593
They blew his...

898
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,638
...head off.

899
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,478
- Who are you talking about?
- Kennedy.

900
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:01,195
<i>President Kennedy was shot</i>

901
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:03,906
<i>as he drove from Dallas airport
to downtown Dallas...</i>

902
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:05,158
<i>They killed him.</i>

903
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:08,703
<i>Governor Connally of Texas
in the car with him was also shot.</i>

904
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:11,372
<i>It is reported that
three bullets rang out.</i>

905
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,583
<i>A Secret Serviceman has been...</i>

906
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:16,210
<i>They killed our man.</i>

907
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:19,422
<i>"He's dead." Whether he
referred to President Kennedy or not</i>

908
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:21,299
<i>is not yet known.</i>

909
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:24,760
<i>The president, cradled in the
arms of his wife, Mrs. Kennedy, </i>

910
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,472
<i>was carried to an ambulance
and the car rushed</i>

911
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:29,515
<i>to Parkland Hospital
outside Dallas...</i>

912
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:33,352
<i>Mrs. Kennedy refused
to change her clothes, </i>

913
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:38,024
<i>so that everybody could see
what they did to her husband.</i>

914
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,951
<i>The last time
I saw that much blood</i>

915
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:52,038
<i>was the day my daddy was killed.</i>

916
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,424
Please tell me how I could help you.

917
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:43,214
Ma, what you doing?

918
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:48,344
Here. Want you to take this box
and put it in the basement.

919
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:50,680
- Make sure you label it "trophies."
- This is Louis' stuff, Ma.

920
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,348
You know he gonna be pissed.

921
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:54,225
I don't care nothing about
Louis being pissed.

922
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,519
I'm the one pissed.
He ain't been here in three years.

923
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:58,229
Why you pissed, Mama?

924
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,064
And don't put that next
to my jarred okra either.

925
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:01,857
Ain't nobody trying to smell
that stankin' okra.

926
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:03,943
And when you come back, I want
you to get me some fish food.

927
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:25,548
Look what the president...

928
01:05:25,715 --> 01:05:27,383
...Mrs. Kennedy gave me.

929
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,719
Belonged to the president.

930
01:05:32,597 --> 01:05:34,223
Gloria...

931
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:36,976
President was killed.

932
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:40,855
I'm really sorry about the president.

933
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:43,608
I really am.

934
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:46,110
But you and that White House
can kiss my ass.

935
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:48,029
I don't care what
goes on in that house.

936
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:50,239
I care about what goes on in this house.

937
01:06:28,778 --> 01:06:33,991
<i>I knew that Gloria had been
unhappy for some time now.</i>

938
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,870
<i>I knew that's probably
why she drank.</i>

939
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:42,416
<i>She wanted me to get along
better with Louis.</i>

940
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:46,128
<i>I didn't know how.</i>

941
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:47,838
<i>I couldn't.</i>

942
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:52,968
<i>I could cut back them
long hours at the White House.</i>

943
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:55,388
<i>And I did just that.</i>

944
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:57,640
How many pairs of shoes she got?

945
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:00,685
She got about... 125.

946
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,354
- A hundred twenty-five pairs of shoes?
- Yeah.

947
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:08,234
Put them in a line from the blacks
all the way to the whites.

948
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:12,196
And I'll tell you what. Next time
there's a light on in an empty room,

949
01:07:12,363 --> 01:07:15,366
I will fire every sorry son of a bitch
in this house. I mean it, Cecil!

950
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:18,661
Go back to Texas and run the country
from a dirt shack if I have to.

951
01:07:18,828 --> 01:07:20,204
Is that what you want?

952
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:21,956
Who do you think pays the
goddamned bills around here?

953
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:23,457
I don't, but you
know what I mean.

954
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:24,917
Yes, sir.

955
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:28,796
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

956
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:32,049
Lady Bird and I want you to have this.

957
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:35,511
- Matches your eyes.
- Thank you, sir.

958
01:07:38,431 --> 01:07:40,516
- Get it, Gloria.
- Do it, baby.

959
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:43,102
Swim it! Go ahead, Gloria.

960
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:47,398
- I see you, baby.
- You see me, babe? Put it on.

961
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:52,528
Get it, Gloria.

962
01:07:52,695 --> 01:07:55,448
- Now that's what I'm talking about.
- Get it, girl! Shake it out! Get it!

963
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,204
Negro! Get out here.

964
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:03,998
Back there stinking up
my bathroom.

965
01:08:04,165 --> 01:08:05,791
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, Lord.

966
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,251
What you doing?

967
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:09,378
Hey! Whoo!

968
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:11,672
What?

969
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,090
Get you some!

970
01:08:14,925 --> 01:08:17,219
- You know.
- That's your friend.

971
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:21,474
Give me my wig!
What's wrong with you?!

972
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,393
- This my good wig!
- Oh, shit!

973
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,229
- Sit down.
- We got the spades up.

974
01:08:27,396 --> 01:08:28,856
Brother just handling his business.

975
01:08:29,023 --> 01:08:30,691
He can still do the splits,
I'll tell you.

976
01:08:30,858 --> 01:08:33,068
James told me
that Dr. King told the president

977
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:36,280
that we would be going to the streets
down South for our right to vote.

978
01:08:36,447 --> 01:08:38,157
- Didn't you, baby?
- What?

979
01:08:38,324 --> 01:08:40,367
Didn't you tell me
that Dr. King told the president

980
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:42,578
that we was going down South
for our right to vote?

981
01:08:42,745 --> 01:08:45,289
- I ain't make that up.
- Is that what you heard?

982
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:47,583
That Dr. King ain't no joke,
with his little militant ass.

983
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,127
- She talking too damned much.
- Well, sound like somebody talking.

984
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:51,212
Shut up.

985
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,881
- Leave my bird alone.
- Well, you know them three kids

986
01:08:54,048 --> 01:08:56,801
got killed down there, trying to get
colored folks registered to vote.

987
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:58,302
That's why I didn't want
Louis to go down there.

988
01:08:58,469 --> 01:08:59,887
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

989
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:01,388
You shouldn't have
sent him down there.

990
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:03,599
- I know.
- He is down there now,

991
01:09:03,766 --> 01:09:05,643
and there ain't nothing
we can do about it.

992
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,353
The only reason
the president sent the FBI

993
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,729
is 'cause two of them were white.

994
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:11,774
- Now who told you that?
- Yeah, who told her that?

995
01:09:11,941 --> 01:09:15,611
It was in one of them colored newspapers
from Baltimore. That all right with you?

996
01:09:15,778 --> 01:09:18,113
See, she getting smart now.

997
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,407
Honey, you think the president
ought to do something

998
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:22,993
- about the Voting Rights bill?
- That ain't the trump.

999
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,662
President Johnson
just passed the greatest piece

1000
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:27,832
of civil rights legislation
since Lincoln freed the slaves.

1001
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,459
It's gonna be very difficult to
pass another bill anytime soon.

1002
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:32,837
- That's it.
- You see how my wife quizzes me?

1003
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:35,965
- I get it every day.
- Only, you got to know

1004
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:38,175
how much to say,
when you cross the line.

1005
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:39,885
You deal with your woman,
I'll deal with mine.

1006
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:42,096
At least you tell your wife
what's going on over there.

1007
01:09:42,263 --> 01:09:43,681
- Aces!
- Damn!

1008
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:45,975
Can't be a king
in your own castle.

1009
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:48,143
You hit the strip joint,
that's what I say.

1010
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:51,856
Hey, uh, Glo. Did you hear about
your neighbor, Howard?

1011
01:09:54,108 --> 01:09:58,904
Guy down on 8th Street,
caught him in bed with his wife.

1012
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:00,531
Shot him dead.

1013
01:10:00,698 --> 01:10:03,868
- Shot him in the back.
- That's it. That's all of it.

1014
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:08,122
I don't know, maybe he got
what he deserved.

1015
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,375
<i>You sorry sap asses
got to realize</i>

1016
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,460
the Negro ain't gonna take it no more.

1017
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,462
This entire country is a tinderbox.

1018
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:19,049
Goddamn tinderbox of nigger rage
just waiting to explode!

1019
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:21,343
Now, I want you all
to get on the phone,

1020
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,721
call the NAACP, CORE
and whoever else

1021
01:10:23,888 --> 01:10:25,389
will listen to your sorry asses

1022
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:27,766
and help me keep them Negroes
off the street.

1023
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:31,020
Buck, I smell your ass from here!
What the hell are you waiting for?!

1024
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:34,106
Jesus Christ.

1025
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:36,984
Cecil, get me some of
that goddamned prune juice.

1026
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:46,035
I'm not sure what to make
of Malcolm X.

1027
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:47,703
I know what to make of him.

1028
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,872
Got a better plan
in place than Dr. King.

1029
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:53,250
If someone puts their hands on
you, put them in the cemetery.

1030
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:56,545
- That a better plan?
- Ooh, We fixin' to go.

1031
01:10:56,712 --> 01:10:58,005
Bye, Claramay.

1032
01:10:58,172 --> 01:11:00,090
- Good night.
- Good night.

1033
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:03,510
I mean...

1034
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,849
You just mad 'cause he was
talking about your daddy.

1035
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:10,935
What?

1036
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:13,103
He was saying all that
stuff about house Negroes.

1037
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,189
I saw you get mad.

1038
01:11:15,356 --> 01:11:17,608
My dad is not a house Negro.

1039
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:24,323
- He a butler, ain't he?
- Don't talk about my dad.

1040
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,867
I don't talk about your dad,
all right?

1041
01:11:27,034 --> 01:11:28,869
That's 'cause my daddy's
proud of what I'm doing.

1042
01:11:42,758 --> 01:11:44,551
You all right?

1043
01:12:27,136 --> 01:12:31,598
<i>Everybody went to church to
raise money for the kids down in Selma.</i>

1044
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:36,937
<i>But I didn't go. I wasn't gonna give
money to pay for my son to be killed.</i>

1045
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:48,115
<i>Once again, them kids got beat.</i>

1046
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:53,245
<i>This one was so bad that the press
called it "Bloody Sunday."</i>

1047
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:55,289
<i>They barely left Selma.</i>

1048
01:12:55,456 --> 01:12:58,083
<i>They marched in small groups
through the city of Selma</i>

1049
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,960
<i>- and were not stopped...
- ...mortars and rockets...</i>

1050
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:02,129
<i>...can pound Con Thien
around the clock</i>

1051
01:13:02,296 --> 01:13:03,964
<i>with devastating effect.</i>

1052
01:13:04,131 --> 01:13:05,799
<i>And our ground troops
cannot go into...</i>

1053
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,718
<i>...it was a different story.</i>

1054
01:13:07,885 --> 01:13:10,554
<i>Mounted sheriff's deputies
helped to break up the column.</i>

1055
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:12,431
<i>Once the line was broken...</i>

1056
01:13:12,598 --> 01:13:15,017
How are your boys, Cecil?

1057
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:27,237
I don't know how my oldest is,
Mr. President.

1058
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:29,656
I believe he might
be in Selma.

1059
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:32,284
And, you know,
sometime I feel like

1060
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:34,703
we're living in
two different worlds.

1061
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:39,083
Just want to keep him safe.

1062
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:43,128
<i>...marchers were
treated for tear gas burns, </i>

1063
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:44,838
<i>open wounds and broken bones.</i>

1064
01:13:45,005 --> 01:13:46,423
<i>One hospital treated...</i>

1065
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:52,304
<i>Every American citizen
must have an equal right to vote.</i>

1066
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:56,809
<i>Yet the harsh fact is that
in many places in this country, </i>

1067
01:13:56,975 --> 01:14:01,355
<i>men and women
are kept from voting</i>

1068
01:14:01,522 --> 01:14:04,066
<i>simply because they are Negroes.</i>

1069
01:14:04,233 --> 01:14:05,943
"Negroes?"

1070
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:08,570
Since when did he start
calling us Negroes?

1071
01:14:09,655 --> 01:14:11,573
That nigger uses the word
"nigger" more than I use it.

1072
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:15,536
<i>But really it's all of us...</i>

1073
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:20,707
<i>...who must overcome
the crippling legacy</i>

1074
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:23,877
<i>of bigotry and injustice.</i>

1075
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:26,588
<i>And we shall overcome.</i>

1076
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:33,554
<i>First,
a barrage of cover fire, </i>

1077
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,597
<i>and then a charge across the street.</i>

1078
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:38,350
<i>The Marines moved out from
the fortified Army compound</i>

1079
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:40,144
<i>blitzed by the original attack.</i>

1080
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,062
<i>Hey, hey, LBJ!</i>

1081
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:44,439
<i>How many kids
did you kill today?!</i>

1082
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:46,650
<i>Hey, hey, LBJ!</i>

1083
01:14:46,817 --> 01:14:48,569
<i>How many kids
did you kill today?!</i>

1084
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,237
<i>...the ancient imperial city.</i>

1085
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:53,657
<i>It is to Vietnamese
what old Boston is to Americans, </i>

1086
01:14:53,824 --> 01:14:56,660
<i>where many of its country's
leaders are born or educated.</i>

1087
01:14:56,827 --> 01:14:59,705
I wish they'd shut up.

1088
01:14:59,872 --> 01:15:03,000
<i>The first sniper shots ricochet
around the thick walls of the building, </i>

1089
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:06,879
<i>taking the first casualties
of the first squad.</i>

1090
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:09,006
<i>The snipers may be
only two or three, </i>

1091
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,758
<i>invisible to the buildings
beyond the wall.</i>

1092
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:14,303
<i>But there is also a machine gun
down the street to the left.</i>

1093
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:18,932
Dr. King, you might want to
lie down with that fever.

1094
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:24,438
President Johnson is making
a tragic error in Vietnam.

1095
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:27,274
Move over, big yellow.

1096
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:29,526
Why shouldn't we fight in Vietnam?

1097
01:15:29,693 --> 01:15:31,778
The Vietcong don't call us
"niggers," for one.

1098
01:15:35,073 --> 01:15:38,535
Seriously, how many of
your parents support the war?

1099
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:44,333
Well, my Lord.
Why do your parents support it?

1100
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:48,629
We haven't spoken about it specifically,
I just know they do.

1101
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:51,924
Well, what do your daddy do?

1102
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:55,302
He's a butler.

1103
01:15:55,469 --> 01:15:58,639
The black domestic play an
important role in our history.

1104
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:00,891
I didn't tell you that
to make fun of me.

1105
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:04,770
Young brother, the black
domestic defy racial stereotypes

1106
01:16:04,937 --> 01:16:08,190
by being hardworking and trustworthy.

1107
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:15,906
<i>He slowly
tears down racial hatred</i>

1108
01:16:16,073 --> 01:16:22,162
<i>with his example of a strong work ethic
and dignified character.</i>

1109
01:16:25,374 --> 01:16:29,336
Now, while we perceive the butler
or the maid to be subservient,

1110
01:16:29,503 --> 01:16:33,966
in many ways, they are subversive,
without even knowing it.

1111
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:40,555
- Come in, Cecil.
- Afternoon, Mr. Warner.

1112
01:16:45,102 --> 01:16:46,895
Thank you for seeing me.

1113
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:04,246
Since the colored...

1114
01:17:04,413 --> 01:17:06,456
...the black staff

1115
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:10,043
does just as much work
as the white staff,

1116
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:14,548
I believe that our salaries
should reflect our service, sir.

1117
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,093
"Black" staff?

1118
01:17:19,386 --> 01:17:22,973
I also feel
that we should have...

1119
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:28,937
...opportunities of advancement.

1120
01:17:29,104 --> 01:17:31,690
No black houseman

1121
01:17:31,857 --> 01:17:35,777
has ever been promoted
to the engineer's office.

1122
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:40,824
You're very well liked here, Cecil.

1123
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,993
But if you're unhappy
with your salary or position,

1124
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,370
then I suggest you seek
employment elsewhere.

1125
01:17:45,537 --> 01:17:47,539
- With all due respect...
- Don't let that Martin Luther King shit

1126
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:51,877
fill your britches out.
Just remember where I found you.

1127
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:01,803
Yes, sir.

1128
01:18:08,435 --> 01:18:09,936
Excuse me.

1129
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:22,074
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King,
the apostle of non-violence</i>

1130
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:26,078
<i>in the civil rights movement has been
shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.</i>

1131
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:28,497
<i>Police have issued
an All Points Bulletin</i>

1132
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:31,708
<i>for a well-dressed, young white
man seen running from the scene.</i>

1133
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:34,669
<i>Officers also reportedly
chased and fired on</i>

1134
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:37,672
<i>a radio-equipped car
containing two white men.</i>

1135
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:08,578
<i>I didn't know if I was
gonna get home alive.</i>

1136
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:14,418
<i>It was the first time I felt like
I didn't belong in my own neighborhood.</i>

1137
01:19:16,044 --> 01:19:17,838
<i>The whole world was changing, </i>

1138
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:20,590
<i>and I didn't know where I fit in.</i>

1139
01:19:22,259 --> 01:19:24,719
<i>Dr. King has been a buffer
the last two years, </i>

1140
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:27,139
<i>between the black community
and the white community.</i>

1141
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:28,598
<i>The white people do not know it, </i>

1142
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:31,435
<i>but the white people's
best friend is dead.</i>

1143
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:34,104
<i>The black people's leader,
our Moses, </i>

1144
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:37,482
<i>the once in a four-
or five-hundred year leader, </i>

1145
01:19:37,649 --> 01:19:40,152
<i>has been taken from us
by hatred and bitterness.</i>

1146
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:42,028
<i>Even as I stand at this hour, </i>

1147
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:46,616
<i>I cannot even allow hate
to enter my heart at this time, </i>

1148
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:50,203
<i>for it was sickness,
not meanness, that killed him.</i>

1149
01:20:29,618 --> 01:20:32,829
Ma... my room's pink.

1150
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:41,296
Make sure you get some more
of my sweet potatoes, Carol.

1151
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:43,340
I use orange juice
when I make 'em,

1152
01:20:43,507 --> 01:20:45,634
that's what make 'em so... tart.

1153
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:48,595
How long y'all been dating?

1154
01:20:48,762 --> 01:20:50,180
- Five years.
- We're just friends.

1155
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:58,230
Is, uh,
all the rest of the students

1156
01:20:58,396 --> 01:21:00,482
are they getting involved
in politics, too?

1157
01:21:05,695 --> 01:21:08,448
There's been a division.
Kind of a split, Ma.

1158
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:11,993
A few of them,
like John Lewis, they're still...

1159
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:15,413
- I love John Lewis.
- How you know who John Lewis is?

1160
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,457
<i>'Cause, honey,
I read Jet magazine.</i>

1161
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:20,544
I'm not just sitting up there
sewing for you all day.

1162
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,337
Ooh.

1163
01:21:22,504 --> 01:21:25,340
I'm sick and tired of getting
thrown in jail.

1164
01:21:26,258 --> 01:21:27,884
Yeah, well, that makes
two of us, don't it?

1165
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:32,472
Dr. King's philosophy ultimately
got him murdered.

1166
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,683
It worked when we started,

1167
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:38,895
but... now it's time to take
the next step, which is politics.

1168
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:40,647
So y'all going
to the White House now?

1169
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:42,023
Daddy, Louis going
to the White House.

1170
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:43,567
You know they ain't gonna
let you in there

1171
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:45,151
with them nipples out.

1172
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:47,362
Maybe one, but not both of 'em.

1173
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:50,991
Shut up. Nah, we're...
we're more grass roots.

1174
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:53,493
One-on-one with the community.

1175
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,745
Although we have started
our own political party.

1176
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:58,248
What's your party?

1177
01:21:58,415 --> 01:21:59,791
You like to party?

1178
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:03,712
I like to party.
What's your party called?

1179
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,632
The Black Panther Party.

1180
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:12,095
What kind of name is that?
What's that stand for?

1181
01:22:12,262 --> 01:22:14,931
We... provide free breakfast
for children,

1182
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:19,019
free medical clinics, free clothing,
self-defense classes.

1183
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:21,438
And why y'all need self-defense?

1184
01:22:21,605 --> 01:22:23,273
We ain't gettin' beat no more.

1185
01:22:28,612 --> 01:22:30,947
Me and your daddy saw a
wonderful movie the other night.

1186
01:22:31,114 --> 01:22:32,741
Reminded me so much of you.

1187
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:35,327
Oh, yeah?

1188
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:37,370
What was the name
of that movie, honey?

1189
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:39,164
<i>In the Heat of the Night.</i>

1190
01:22:40,332 --> 01:22:46,046
<i>In the Heat... of the Night,
with Sidney Poitier.</i>

1191
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:48,632
Lord, Sidney Poitier.
I love Sidney Poitier.

1192
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:52,177
Sidney Poitier's a white man's fantasy
of what he wants us to be.

1193
01:22:52,344 --> 01:22:55,847
But his movies have him
fighting for equal rights.

1194
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:57,891
Only in a way that's acceptable
to the white status quo.

1195
01:22:58,058 --> 01:23:01,936
- Ah.
- The brother can't act.

1196
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,897
What are you talking about?

1197
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,690
He just won the Academy Award.

1198
01:23:05,857 --> 01:23:07,817
He's breaking down barriers
for all of us.

1199
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:11,821
By being white.
By acting white.

1200
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:14,574
Sidney Poitier is nothing but
a rich Uncle Tom.

1201
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,954
Look at you.

1202
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:22,374
All puffed up.

1203
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:24,584
With your hat on your head.

1204
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:27,212
Coming in here,
saying whatever you want.

1205
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:28,838
Girlfriend belching at the table.

1206
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:31,549
You don't even feel
you gotta go to school,

1207
01:23:31,716 --> 01:23:33,718
even though I gave you the money.

1208
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:37,430
You need to go.

1209
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:43,395
Yeah, Louis.
I need you to get out of my house.

1210
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:47,190
- What?
- Get the hell out of my house!

1211
01:23:47,357 --> 01:23:48,775
- What are you doing?
- Get on out!

1212
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:50,694
- He's gotta go!
- No, Cecil, no!

1213
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,654
- I can't take this no more!
- We ain't seen this boy!

1214
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:54,072
We ain't seen this boy!

1215
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,407
I'm gonna snatch the life
out of you, boy!

1216
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:56,991
- Now, everybody just sit down.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Butler,

1217
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:59,536
I didn't mean to make
fun of your hero.

1218
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:04,708
Everything you are and
everything you have is...

1219
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:07,127
...'cause of that butler.

1220
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:10,547
Now you take that trifling
low-class bitch...

1221
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,926
...and get out of this house.

1222
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:32,152
I like Sidney Poitier, Daddy.

1223
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:36,656
<i>What's that movie he did?
Look Who's Coming to Dinner?</i>

1224
01:24:36,823 --> 01:24:38,241
Everything ain't a joke.

1225
01:24:38,408 --> 01:24:40,827
- Carol came to dinner.
- Hush, Charlie.

1226
01:24:43,997 --> 01:24:46,666
<i>Police took Louis the next day.</i>

1227
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:56,092
Y'all gonna make me late for work.

1228
01:24:56,259 --> 01:24:57,719
Unc, I'm sorry.

1229
01:24:57,886 --> 01:24:59,137
Who else I'm supposed to call
to bail him out?

1230
01:24:59,304 --> 01:25:02,932
What they got him in for this time?
Sit up!

1231
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:06,686
Louis said they
stopped him just because.

1232
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:09,856
Just because.

1233
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,318
He said he wasn't going
to get beat no more, so...

1234
01:25:13,485 --> 01:25:16,112
...he got out the car
and he hit 'em back.

1235
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:18,406
What about that little gal of his?

1236
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:21,743
They put her in the hospital.

1237
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:23,286
The hospital.

1238
01:25:23,453 --> 01:25:25,246
Charlie.

1239
01:25:25,413 --> 01:25:27,665
This shit's gotta stop, man.

1240
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:32,045
I'm late for work.

1241
01:25:32,212 --> 01:25:34,130
You tell Louis I'm not his mama.

1242
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:36,716
I want my money back.

1243
01:25:40,094 --> 01:25:41,971
You all right?

1244
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:43,640
Yeah, I'm all right.

1245
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:47,101
Thanks, Uncle Carter.

1246
01:25:47,268 --> 01:25:49,938
You need to take all this Black
Panther shit somewhere else.

1247
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:52,941
Now, I'm not them.
I want my money back, hear me?

1248
01:25:53,107 --> 01:25:55,401
- Yes, sir.
- Every dime.

1249
01:25:57,028 --> 01:26:01,199
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, Unc... don't tell Daddy.

1250
01:26:08,915 --> 01:26:12,418
How you avoid all that sex
in prison?

1251
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:14,629
Do they teach you that
with the Panthers?

1252
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:18,383
They teach you how to... to sit...

1253
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:27,392
- She been drinking again?
- No. She's sober.

1254
01:26:27,559 --> 01:26:30,812
She ain't doing nothing but sewing
and feeding them damn fishes.

1255
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:33,356
Feed them more than she feed me.

1256
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:36,860
You excited about
going back to Howard?

1257
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:39,529
Excited about not going back.

1258
01:26:40,822 --> 01:26:43,157
- What?
- Yeah.

1259
01:26:43,324 --> 01:26:45,535
I'm going to Vietnam.

1260
01:26:45,702 --> 01:26:48,705
Charlie, don't do this.
Don't do this.

1261
01:26:48,872 --> 01:26:52,834
- This country treats us like dogs!
- And do what? Don't do this?

1262
01:26:54,878 --> 01:26:58,548
You fight your country.

1263
01:26:58,715 --> 01:27:01,092
I want to fight for my country.

1264
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:04,429
- I won't go to your funeral.
- Good.

1265
01:27:04,596 --> 01:27:07,682
'Cause I don't want you there
with all of that...

1266
01:27:08,349 --> 01:27:12,562
...black leather and latex,

1267
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:17,025
shining and taking away the attention
off of my pretty face in my casket.

1268
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:22,614
What do they call you now, Louise?

1269
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,407
- Shut up.
- Louise Gaines.

1270
01:27:24,574 --> 01:27:25,700
Charlie, shut up.

1271
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:29,871
I want to know every goddamn
domestic policy decision right now,

1272
01:27:30,038 --> 01:27:31,372
and I want it on the table right now.

1273
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:32,540
- OK.
- OK.

1274
01:27:32,707 --> 01:27:34,834
Did you get
the memos we sent last week?

1275
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:39,172
John and I strongly agree
that the time calls for...

1276
01:27:39,339 --> 01:27:41,090
A goddamn fly,
a goddamn fly in here.

1277
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:42,926
- Jesus Christ.
- John and I both think

1278
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:46,512
that the time calls for
a period of benign neglect.

1279
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:47,847
- Benign neglect.
- Yes.

1280
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:50,475
I like that. I like that.

1281
01:27:50,642 --> 01:27:54,145
<i>You know, the pigs in the
media describe us as terrorists.</i>

1282
01:27:54,312 --> 01:27:58,650
A terrorist is one who
terrorizes and frightens others.

1283
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:01,361
We the ones getting terrorized.

1284
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:03,446
How can we exist in, in peace,

1285
01:28:03,613 --> 01:28:06,658
when we scared to walk
down the street to the store?

1286
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:09,202
All right, there's this whole black
power movement going on, right?

1287
01:28:09,369 --> 01:28:12,205
- Right.
- What if we, um...

1288
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:18,503
What if Nixon promotes black power

1289
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:22,548
to mean "black businesses"
and we find ways to support

1290
01:28:22,715 --> 01:28:26,094
black entrepreneurs, pass the buck
on desegregation to the courts.

1291
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,805
Push black enterprise

1292
01:28:28,972 --> 01:28:30,723
to win the 20 percent
of the votes it could swing our way.

1293
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:32,976
- Excellent, sir.
- Absolutely.

1294
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,311
You don't know if your ceiling gonna
cave in 'cause your slum lord

1295
01:28:35,478 --> 01:28:37,981
too busy running around
collecting rent checks.

1296
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:40,024
But he won't fix your roof.

1297
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:43,820
It's time we take a stand
against these injustices

1298
01:28:43,987 --> 01:28:45,488
that have plagued our community.

1299
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:49,200
They take one of ours,
we taking two of theirs.

1300
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:50,994
- That's right.
- It's been time.

1301
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,913
We just need to make sure
that Nixon black power

1302
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,999
doesn't equate Nixon
with the Black Panthers.

1303
01:28:56,165 --> 01:28:58,835
Have you lost your mind, man?
Did you read Hoover's last memo on that?

1304
01:28:59,002 --> 01:29:01,170
- That's my point.
- Goddamn terrifying.

1305
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:03,756
No, no, no. I gave him the green light
to gut those sons of bitches.

1306
01:29:03,923 --> 01:29:05,258
- Good.
- Good. Absolutely.

1307
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:07,969
No, round 'em all up and
throw 'em down an elevator shaft.

1308
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:14,517
I don't proclaim to know everything.
But I promise you...

1309
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:17,979
...they'll always beware
of the nigger with a gun.

1310
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,694
Will there be anything else,
Mr. President?

1311
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:38,291
How many kids we got coming
to the breakfast tomorrow morning?

1312
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:40,460
Got about 25 to 30 coming.

1313
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:43,046
Twenty-five to 30 kids
will be able to go to school

1314
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:45,131
and focus on their lessons.

1315
01:29:45,298 --> 01:29:47,717
'Cause they don't want us
to be able to feed our kids.

1316
01:29:47,884 --> 01:29:51,220
They don't want us
to be able to protect ourselves.

1317
01:29:57,977 --> 01:29:59,687
What are we doing here?

1318
01:30:01,731 --> 01:30:04,400
Thought this was going to be
our community service.

1319
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:07,111
This is community service.

1320
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:09,655
"Someone kills one of ours,
we kill two of theirs?"

1321
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:11,491
Community protection.

1322
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:15,244
Are you ready to kill somebody, Carol?

1323
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:19,082
'Cause I ain't.

1324
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:22,752
I am.

1325
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:31,344
Did you ever love me, baby?

1326
01:30:56,994 --> 01:31:00,081
<i>Today, a day after police
shot it out with the Black Panthers, </i>

1327
01:31:00,248 --> 01:31:02,291
<i>killing two of them,
they raided the apartment...</i>

1328
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,377
<i>...the shooting of 26
Panthers in the past year, </i>

1329
01:31:04,544 --> 01:31:07,797
<i>may represent a national campaign
by police to wipe out the Panthers...</i>

1330
01:31:07,964 --> 01:31:10,216
<i>...the criminal reaction
of the occupants in shooting</i>

1331
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:12,510
<i>at announced police officers, </i>

01:31:12,677 --> 01:31:17,431
<i>emphasizes the extreme viciousness
of the Black Panther Party.</i>

1333
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:47,128
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

1334
01:31:47,295 --> 01:31:49,297
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday to me, huh?

1335
01:31:49,463 --> 01:31:50,756
Happy birthday to you.

1336
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:55,720
Right now, this is the present
I want, right here.

1337
01:31:55,887 --> 01:31:58,181
Well, you want it right here?

1338
01:31:58,347 --> 01:32:00,266
Mm-mm, you know right...

1339
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:02,185
- Right here?
- Kids up... Kids down...?

1340
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:04,312
Ain't no kids in the house no more.

1341
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,230
Hey, I made you a birthday cake.

1342
01:32:06,397 --> 01:32:08,357
I got all the cake
I want right here.

1343
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:10,234
No, you crazy.

1344
01:32:10,401 --> 01:32:13,237
I got some champagne
cooling in the icebox.

1345
01:32:13,404 --> 01:32:15,198
And some ice cream, too.
Get some ice cream.

1346
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:16,782
You gonna be drinking with me?

1347
01:32:18,201 --> 01:32:20,036
You know I don't drink.

1348
01:32:20,203 --> 01:32:22,038
I don't drink.

1349
01:32:22,205 --> 01:32:23,539
Just playing with you.

1350
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:25,708
I just want to see you move
a little bit. Go ahead.

1351
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:30,379
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1352
01:32:37,345 --> 01:32:39,513
We get any mail
from Charlie today?

1353
01:32:41,474 --> 01:32:43,059
No.

1354
01:32:44,644 --> 01:32:46,312
- No?
- Haven't heard from Charlie.

1355
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:48,439
I know. I got an idea.

1356
01:32:48,606 --> 01:32:50,691
I think we should go
to Shantay's tonight.

1357
01:32:50,858 --> 01:32:52,944
Oh, no.
No, I'm too old for disco.

1358
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,278
We not old. Come on. We ain't old.

1359
01:32:54,445 --> 01:32:56,155
I just don't feel like
doing no disco.

1360
01:32:56,322 --> 01:32:58,074
Our boys are gone.
It's just you and me.

1361
01:32:58,241 --> 01:33:02,119
You and me, we are free.
I forgot this. I forgot this.

1362
01:33:03,454 --> 01:33:08,376
Now, look at us.
Little happy birthday present.

1363
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:11,796
I want you to go put it on, upstairs.

1364
01:33:11,963 --> 01:33:13,881
- Put it on?
- Yeah. Go put it on.

1365
01:33:14,048 --> 01:33:15,800
- All right.
- Make it snappy.

1366
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:18,219
Bring down my sewing kit,
'cause I need to do some alterations.

1367
01:33:22,348 --> 01:33:24,642
Make it snappy!

1368
01:33:28,562 --> 01:33:30,523
Hello.

1369
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,819
Hi. Where are you?

1370
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,488
Where?

1371
01:33:38,698 --> 01:33:40,866
You should call me back,
because this is not a good time.

1372
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:44,161
- He's home again.
- It fit!

1373
01:33:44,328 --> 01:33:45,830
- We gonna go on out tonight.
- Where?

1374
01:33:45,997 --> 01:33:47,915
- He's home and...
- Boy, you good, aren't you?

1375
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:50,751
- You all right?
- Who that?

1376
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:53,004
Call me back.

1377
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:55,047
- OK?
- Oh, it's Louis.

1378
01:33:55,214 --> 01:33:56,799
He asking for some money?

1379
01:33:59,343 --> 01:34:00,886
Hey, Louis.

1380
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:04,223
I didn't expect to hear
from you on my birthday.

1381
01:34:05,308 --> 01:34:07,226
You should feel
ashamed of yourself.

1382
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:10,104
You're a grown-ass man calling
your mama, asking for money.

1383
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:12,815
And guess what?
It's the butler's money.

1384
01:34:12,982 --> 01:34:14,525
It's Uncle Tom's money.

1385
01:34:14,692 --> 01:34:16,736
And he ain't giving
none out today.

1386
01:34:18,362 --> 01:34:19,864
Bye.

1387
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:25,077
I got it.

1388
01:34:36,213 --> 01:34:37,882
You got the wrong house.

1389
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,805
It's the wrong house.

1390
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:45,157
<i>Vietnam took my boy, </i>

1391
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:48,828
<i>and I didn't understand why we
were there in the first place.</i>

1392
01:36:21,485 --> 01:36:23,571
Your father still alive, Cecil?

1393
01:36:25,197 --> 01:36:27,158
No, sir.

1394
01:36:27,324 --> 01:36:29,618
My father died when I was a child.

1395
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:41,505
Is there anything else that you
would like, Mr. President?

1396
01:36:41,672 --> 01:36:43,632
Yeah. Come sit.

1397
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:45,593
Sit down, you know?

1398
01:37:04,487 --> 01:37:07,698
There's been a lot of talk
of me resigning and...

1399
01:37:08,574 --> 01:37:10,534
...things of that nature,
but I just want you to know

1400
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:12,453
it's never gonna happen.

1401
01:37:14,205 --> 01:37:16,749
I'm gonna come out of this thing
stronger than ever.

1402
01:37:24,089 --> 01:37:26,717
Is there anything else
that you would like...

1403
01:37:26,884 --> 01:37:28,344
...Mr. President?

1404
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:37,561
Louis is here, looking for you.

1405
01:37:42,233 --> 01:37:45,611
- Got everybody all worried.
- Well, I finished school.

1406
01:37:45,778 --> 01:37:46,987
I got my master's
in political science.

1407
01:37:47,154 --> 01:37:50,115
Hey! That's what I'm talking about.

1408
01:37:50,282 --> 01:37:52,576
Get that education.

1409
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:56,747
There he is!
Well, I'm gonna let you all to it.

1410
01:37:56,914 --> 01:37:59,250
Ain't no need for that, Carter.

1411
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:04,713
- Hey, Dad.
- Get out of here, Louis.

1412
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:11,804
- Dad...
- I said leave.

1413
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:22,189
Keep doing what you doing.

1414
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:27,820
Thank you, Uncle Carter.

1415
01:38:30,072 --> 01:38:33,534
Why you do that? Huh?
That was wrong.

1416
01:38:33,701 --> 01:38:36,412
That boy's hurting, too. He's just
trying to get his act together.

1417
01:38:36,579 --> 01:38:38,789
He should be hurting, Carter.

1418
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:42,751
Boy didn't even go
to his own brother's funeral.

1419
01:38:43,752 --> 01:38:48,632
He's full of shit is what he is.
He ain't doing nothing right.

1420
01:38:48,799 --> 01:38:51,635
He just got his master's!
What more you want him to do?

1421
01:38:51,802 --> 01:38:56,056
Every gray hair I have
is 'cause of that boy.

1422
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,945
<i>The years started to drift by, </i>

1423
01:39:10,112 --> 01:39:13,699
<i>but the pain in my heart
never went away.</i>

1424
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:27,087
<i>Through it all,
Louis and I never spoke.</i>

1425
01:39:31,508 --> 01:39:36,138
<i>As we are a nation under God,
so I am sworn...</i>

1426
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:57,826
<i>Half of our
oil is now imported...</i>

1427
01:39:57,993 --> 01:40:00,037
<i>It is a crisis that strikes
at the very hear':</i>

1428
01:40:00,204 --> 01:40:02,456
<i>and soul and spirit
of our national will.</i>

1429
01:40:02,623 --> 01:40:04,291
<i>- I feel one coming now.
- Not to worry.</i>

1430
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:06,126
<i>Two of you,
stay home until you feel better.</i>

1431
01:40:06,293 --> 01:40:10,589
<i>OK, Barn, I'll stay.
But I ain't never gonna feel no better.</i>

1432
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:22,976
<i>In our district alone,
we have nine percent unemployment.</i>

1433
01:40:23,143 --> 01:40:25,771
<i>In the country at large, 14 percent
are living below the poverty line.</i>

1434
01:40:25,938 --> 01:40:29,149
<i>Sixty percent of those
are either black or Hispanic.</i>

1435
01:40:29,316 --> 01:40:31,985
<i>Now, if I'm voted to Congress,
reducing those figures is gonna be</i>

1436
01:40:32,152 --> 01:40:35,280
one of my primary objectives.

1437
01:40:38,826 --> 01:40:40,327
Yeah?

1438
01:40:40,494 --> 01:40:42,246
Oh, hey.

1439
01:40:42,413 --> 01:40:44,164
Thanks for getting back to me.

1440
01:40:48,293 --> 01:40:50,087
How much did he lose by?

1441
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:55,926
Really?

1442
01:40:56,093 --> 01:40:57,720
All right, then.

1443
01:40:57,886 --> 01:40:59,680
I appreciate it.

1444
01:41:04,643 --> 01:41:06,562
No, he didn't win.

1445
01:41:08,439 --> 01:41:10,691
I think you should call him.

1446
01:41:12,985 --> 01:41:15,988
Right after Charlie passed,

1447
01:41:16,155 --> 01:41:18,657
Louis came over
and paid me a visit.

1448
01:41:18,824 --> 01:41:20,451
Hmm.

1449
01:41:22,035 --> 01:41:25,456
He found me on the kitchen floor.

1450
01:41:25,622 --> 01:41:27,875
I had passed out.

1451
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:30,043
Drunk.

1452
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:33,922
I'd gone to the bathroom
all over myself.

1453
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:39,428
He's the one that cleaned me up.

1454
01:41:42,765 --> 01:41:46,727
And then he told me
I was the best mother

1455
01:41:46,894 --> 01:41:49,688
anybody could ever want.

1456
01:41:52,983 --> 01:41:55,277
I think, about now...

1457
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:59,948
...he'd want to hear from his daddy.

1458
01:42:01,867 --> 01:42:03,994
I think you ought to call him.

1459
01:42:08,957 --> 01:42:10,626
Mm-hm.

1460
01:42:10,793 --> 01:42:11,794
Cecil?

1461
01:42:14,254 --> 01:42:15,255
Cecil?

1462
01:42:15,422 --> 01:42:18,175
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

1463
01:42:18,342 --> 01:42:20,177
You stay there, I'm coming to you.

1464
01:42:20,344 --> 01:42:23,889
I... have a...

1465
01:42:24,056 --> 01:42:26,683
...secret mission for you.

1466
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:28,143
Yes, sir.

1467
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:30,604
I like to send people
money when they write me

1468
01:42:30,771 --> 01:42:32,940
about their financial problems,

1469
01:42:33,106 --> 01:42:37,110
but my staff has been
trying to get me to stop.

1470
01:42:37,277 --> 01:42:41,031
You think you could
help me to keep this going?

1471
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:43,951
Absolutely, Mr. President.

1472
01:42:44,117 --> 01:42:46,703
Well, I appreciate
your help with this.

1473
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:49,581
And, please, don't tell Nancy.

1474
01:42:49,748 --> 01:42:51,500
Of course not.

1475
01:42:55,337 --> 01:42:58,423
- Morning, Cecil.
- Morning, Mr. Warner.

1476
01:43:02,845 --> 01:43:04,638
May I sit down?

1477
01:43:13,313 --> 01:43:16,692
I've been here
for over 20 years now.

1478
01:43:19,653 --> 01:43:24,491
For all that time,
the black help

1479
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:28,954
has been paid a smaller salary
than the white help.

1480
01:43:30,914 --> 01:43:34,418
And I just don't think
that's right, Mr. Warner.

1481
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:42,301
There are black housemen
who should be engineers by now.

1482
01:43:43,677 --> 01:43:46,805
They should've been promoted
years ago.

1483
01:43:49,308 --> 01:43:51,101
You think so?

1484
01:43:53,979 --> 01:43:59,651
I'm gonna have to be paid
the same as the white help,

1485
01:43:59,818 --> 01:44:03,071
or I'm gonna have to move on.

1486
01:44:04,781 --> 01:44:07,242
I guess you'll be moving on then.

1487
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:14,666
I told the president
that you'd say that.

1488
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:21,340
He told me to tell you
to take this up with him, personally.

1489
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:27,095
Excuse me.

1490
01:44:35,771 --> 01:44:38,315
I'm not comfortable
with all the foreign policy hawks

1491
01:44:38,482 --> 01:44:40,025
surrounding Ronnie, Jim.

1492
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:44,363
We need more moderates on his staff.
And a summit with the Russians.

1493
01:44:44,529 --> 01:44:46,698
Ronnie has to meet
with them face to face

1494
01:44:46,865 --> 01:44:48,200
if we're ever
going to thaw this ice.

1495
01:44:48,367 --> 01:44:50,869
- Cecil.
- Yes, Mrs. Reagan?

1496
01:44:51,036 --> 01:44:53,705
We will talk, Jim. Yes.

1497
01:44:53,872 --> 01:44:55,540
Yes, ma'am?

1498
01:44:55,707 --> 01:44:57,960
You're very popular around here.

1499
01:44:58,126 --> 01:45:02,547
Everyone says you're the man
that got them raises and promotions.

1500
01:45:02,714 --> 01:45:06,426
- I had no idea.
- I wish I could take credit for that.

1501
01:45:07,177 --> 01:45:09,763
I'd like to invite you
to the State Dinner next week.

1502
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:12,307
- I'm gonna be there, Mrs. Reagan.
- No.

1503
01:45:12,474 --> 01:45:17,229
Not as a... Not as a butler, Cecil.
I'm inviting you as a guest.

1504
01:45:18,188 --> 01:45:21,358
But the president prefers
for me to serve him personally.

1505
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:25,404
Don't you worry about, Ronnie.
I'll take care of that.

1506
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:29,950
So we'll see you next week.
You and your wife.

1507
01:45:30,117 --> 01:45:31,952
My Wife?

1508
01:45:34,955 --> 01:45:37,916
It's... It's Gloria, yes?

1509
01:45:38,083 --> 01:45:40,627
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

1510
01:45:42,754 --> 01:45:44,089
Hmm.

1511
01:45:56,935 --> 01:45:58,770
Here's the Entrance Hall.

1512
01:46:03,108 --> 01:46:04,860
Beautiful.

1513
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:22,711
Can I get you a glass
of champagne, Mr. Gaines?

1514
01:46:22,878 --> 01:46:26,715
- Shut up.
- Right.

1515
01:46:28,717 --> 01:46:30,343
Ladies and gentlemen,

1516
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:33,972
the President and First Lady
of the United States.

1517
01:46:55,285 --> 01:46:58,997
<i>It was different sitting
at the table instead of serving it.</i>

1518
01:46:59,164 --> 01:47:00,582
<i>Real different.</i>

1519
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,630
<i>I could see the two faces
the butlers wore to survive.</i>

1520
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:12,385
<i>And I knew I'd lived my life
with those same two faces.</i>

1521
01:47:18,934 --> 01:47:24,189
<i>Gloria looked so happy,
but I didn't feel the same way.</i>

1522
01:47:24,356 --> 01:47:28,276
<i>I guess I wished we were there
for real instead of for show.</i>

1523
01:47:38,703 --> 01:47:41,289
I think that's bon appétit, everybody.

1524
01:47:41,456 --> 01:47:42,833
You black mother...

1525
01:47:48,797 --> 01:47:53,009
I want to make myself clear
on this issue.

1526
01:47:54,803 --> 01:48:01,226
If Congress passes sanctions
against South Africa,

1527
01:48:01,393 --> 01:48:05,689
I will be forced to
veto those sanctions.

1528
01:48:05,856 --> 01:48:10,026
Well, Mr. President, we feel
that that would be a major mistake.

1529
01:48:10,193 --> 01:48:13,905
The brutal repression
of South African black citizens

1530
01:48:14,072 --> 01:48:16,867
makes this no longer
a foreign policy issue,

1531
01:48:17,033 --> 01:48:20,620
but a United States racial issue.

1532
01:48:20,787 --> 01:48:23,540
We're senators
from your own party.

1533
01:48:23,707 --> 01:48:25,667
That's why we feel so comfortable
in letting you know

1534
01:48:25,834 --> 01:48:28,879
that South Africa
is a human rights disaster.

1535
01:48:29,045 --> 01:48:32,591
Black people are
being beaten, tortured,

1536
01:48:32,757 --> 01:48:34,759
gunned down
in the middle of the street.

1537
01:48:34,926 --> 01:48:38,680
Americans see all this on TV,
they're horrified by apartheid.

1538
01:48:38,847 --> 01:48:41,558
I've made my decision.

1539
01:48:41,725 --> 01:48:46,188
Mr. President, your reputation
as a world leader is at stake.

1540
01:48:46,354 --> 01:48:48,732
United States of America needs to be

1541
01:48:48,899 --> 01:48:51,067
on the right side of history
on the race issue.

1542
01:48:51,234 --> 01:48:52,819
I say again.

1543
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:58,158
If Congress passes this bill,

1544
01:48:58,325 --> 01:49:00,994
I Will veto it.

1545
01:49:01,161 --> 01:49:02,829
Period.

1546
01:49:12,297 --> 01:49:16,134
What? You reading now?

1547
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:18,720
Get up and do the dishes
'fore I shoot your little ass.

1548
01:49:32,567 --> 01:49:36,404
<i>Nothing seemed right to me
after that State Dinner.</i>

1549
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:38,782
<i>Got all confused.</i>

1550
01:50:05,517 --> 01:50:08,436
<i>They had started writing books</i>

1551
01:50:08,603 --> 01:50:12,899
<i>about everything Louis
and his friends had done.</i>

1552
01:50:18,321 --> 01:50:20,657
<i>Louis was never a criminal.</i>

1553
01:50:24,536 --> 01:50:27,872
<i>He was a hero, </i>

1554
01:50:28,039 --> 01:50:31,376
<i>fighting to save
the soul of our country.</i>

1555
01:50:42,554 --> 01:50:45,390
- Would you like a cookie?
- Thank you, sir.

1556
01:50:45,557 --> 01:50:47,350
- Cookies.
- Thank you.

1557
01:50:47,517 --> 01:50:48,935
Cookie?

1558
01:50:49,102 --> 01:50:51,062
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1559
01:50:51,229 --> 01:50:52,689
Thank you.

1560
01:50:52,856 --> 01:50:53,982
Cookie?

1561
01:51:08,788 --> 01:51:14,044
<i>I had always loved sewing.
But just felt different now.</i>

1562
01:51:17,505 --> 01:51:21,968
<i>I didn't know that an old man
could feel so lost.</i>

1563
01:51:22,886 --> 01:51:24,679
<i>That's how I felt.</i>

1564
01:51:25,972 --> 01:51:27,891
<i>That's how I felt.</i>

1565
01:51:34,647 --> 01:51:36,733
<i>Americans always turned</i>

1566
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:41,780
<i>a blind eye to what we'd done
to our own.</i>

1567
01:51:41,946 --> 01:51:45,742
<i>We look out to the world
and judge.</i>

1568
01:51:45,909 --> 01:51:48,870
<i>We hear about
the concentration camps, </i>

1569
01:51:49,037 --> 01:51:54,000
<i>but these camps went on
for 200 years</i>

1570
01:51:54,167 --> 01:51:56,920
<i>right here in America.</i>

1571
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,267
Buried my daddy right over there.

1572
01:52:15,563 --> 01:52:19,609
My mama would've been
right proud of me,

1573
01:52:19,776 --> 01:52:22,570
being with a man like you's.

1574
01:52:22,737 --> 01:52:26,116
Taking such good care of me
all of these years.

1575
01:52:29,077 --> 01:52:31,121
I love you, Cecil Gaines.

1576
01:52:33,665 --> 01:52:36,000
I love you more, Gloria.

1577
01:52:48,471 --> 01:52:51,891
Are you sure about this?

1578
01:52:52,058 --> 01:52:53,810
Yes, sir.

1579
01:52:53,977 --> 01:52:58,815
I just want to be the one
to tell you first, that's all.

1580
01:52:58,982 --> 01:53:01,568
But you're the best butler here.

1581
01:53:01,734 --> 01:53:04,195
You're like family, Cecil.

1582
01:53:06,197 --> 01:53:08,783
Been an honor serving you.

1583
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:13,163
Well, not just for me,
I'm sure I speak for all the presidents

1584
01:53:13,329 --> 01:53:17,500
when I say that you've
served your country well.

1585
01:53:19,794 --> 01:53:21,546
Thank you, Mr. President.

1586
01:53:26,468 --> 01:53:27,927
Cecil?

1587
01:53:30,054 --> 01:53:32,682
This whole civil rights issue...

1588
01:53:36,311 --> 01:53:39,439
I sometimes fear I'm...

1589
01:53:39,606 --> 01:53:42,150
on the wrong side of it,
that I'm...

1590
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:45,361
...just wrong.

1591
01:53:45,528 --> 01:53:49,449
Sometimes I think I'm just
scared of what it really means.

1592
01:53:51,743 --> 01:53:54,579
But I'm trying not to be
so scared anymore.

1593
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:57,999
<i>- Who do we want to free?!
- Mandela!</i>

1594
01:53:58,166 --> 01:53:59,375
When do we want him free?

1595
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:00,877
- Now!
- Free Mandela!

1596
01:54:01,044 --> 01:54:05,548
Twenty years ago, we marched
in this country for our rights.

1597
01:54:07,717 --> 01:54:11,638
Today, we march to free
the people of South Africa.

1598
01:54:11,804 --> 01:54:13,181
Yeah!

1599
01:54:13,348 --> 01:54:17,894
Ronald Reagan has attacked or dismantled
every civil rights program

1600
01:54:18,061 --> 01:54:20,063
that has ever been put in place.

1601
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:21,606
- Yeah!
- Right!

1602
01:54:21,773 --> 01:54:25,443
Aiding the oppression of black South
Africans is absolutely consistent

1603
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:29,113
with his policies on race issues.
Am I right?

1604
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,699
- Am I right?
- Yes!

1605
01:54:33,701 --> 01:54:35,578
Hold on, hold on.

1606
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,832
Excuse me. Steven?
Where's Steven?

1607
01:54:39,999 --> 01:54:41,834
- Free Mandela!
- Free Mandela, y'all!

1608
01:54:42,001 --> 01:54:43,836
Free Mandela!

1609
01:54:45,588 --> 01:54:50,426
Free Mandela!
Free Mandela! Free Mandela!

1610
01:55:00,937 --> 01:55:03,189
Hi, Dad.

1611
01:55:03,356 --> 01:55:05,692
Hi, Louis.

1612
01:55:07,443 --> 01:55:10,446
What are you doing here?

1613
01:55:15,868 --> 01:55:18,580
I came here to protest with you.

1614
01:55:21,708 --> 01:55:24,294
You'll get arrested, Dad.
You'll lose your job.

1615
01:55:26,629 --> 01:55:28,715
I lost you.

1616
01:55:32,635 --> 01:55:34,470
I'm sorry.

1617
01:55:44,647 --> 01:55:47,483
I'm sorry, son.

1618
01:56:06,711 --> 01:56:10,423
Don't worry, Dad, we'll be
out of here in a few hours.

1619
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:12,800
Who said I was worried?

1620
01:56:17,555 --> 01:56:21,976
<i>After going to jail,
I thought I'd seen it all.</i>

1621
01:56:22,352 --> 01:56:26,105
- You OK, Daddy?
- Yeah, no, no, no. I'm good.

1622
01:56:26,272 --> 01:56:29,734
<i>But I never imagined I'd see...</i>

1623
01:56:29,901 --> 01:56:31,986
<i>...a black man</i>

1624
01:56:32,153 --> 01:56:37,075
<i>be a real contender for
the President of the United States.</i>

1625
01:56:41,454 --> 01:56:43,498
Here we go.

1626
01:56:43,665 --> 01:56:47,418
- It's that sweet corn.
- That corn look good.

1627
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:03,518
<i>Gloria and I would walk
to our polling place</i>

1628
01:57:03,685 --> 01:57:08,731
<i>every night to see where
we'd be voting for Barack Obama.</i>

1629
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:14,529
<i>We'd just... stare at it, smile.</i>

1630
01:57:20,368 --> 01:57:23,413
- You done?
- Pretty much.

1631
01:57:23,579 --> 01:57:25,790
Good. Time to go.

1632
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:30,002
You done pretty good there.

1633
01:57:30,169 --> 01:57:32,088
Thanks, honey.

1634
01:57:33,423 --> 01:57:37,468
How come Louis' wife
named that child...

1635
01:57:37,635 --> 01:57:40,471
- ...Shaquanda?
- Now, don't start that again.

1636
01:57:40,638 --> 01:57:44,892
I ain't starting it, I just don't know
what kind of name that is.

1637
01:57:45,059 --> 01:57:48,563
I mean, really! Shaquanda?

1638
01:57:48,730 --> 01:57:50,732
I think she done that just to spite me.

1639
01:57:50,898 --> 01:57:54,652
Ain't nobody
done nothing to spite you.

1640
01:57:54,819 --> 01:57:56,738
Yes, she did.

1641
01:57:58,531 --> 01:58:02,118
She a ugly little old girl, too.
That little pug nose.

1642
01:58:02,285 --> 01:58:06,372
- I hope she grow out of it.
- Now, you need to stop that.

1643
01:58:06,539 --> 01:58:08,416
- You know that ain't right.
- Don't you think

1644
01:58:08,583 --> 01:58:10,460
she look a little like
Louis around the mouth?

1645
01:58:10,626 --> 01:58:14,589
I think... she look just like you.

1646
01:58:14,756 --> 01:58:16,591
- Like me?
- Yeah, so you need to...

1647
01:58:16,758 --> 01:58:19,510
...you need
to stop talking about her.

1648
01:58:19,677 --> 01:58:22,680
Let me look at her again,
then, real good.

1649
01:58:25,141 --> 01:58:30,396
She do look a little bit like me.
She a pretty little thing.

1650
01:58:31,731 --> 01:58:34,567
I guess I can put up
with the name Shaquanda.

1651
01:58:36,152 --> 01:58:39,238
I forgot where I put my Bible.

1652
01:58:39,405 --> 01:58:43,117
- You know I need my Bible.
- Mm-hm.

1653
01:58:43,284 --> 01:58:46,871
- I think I left it in the bathroom.
- Why is Louis late?

1654
01:58:48,289 --> 01:58:51,209
Boy gets elected to Congress...

1655
01:58:51,375 --> 01:58:54,754
...and he ain't been on time
getting us to church ever since.

1656
01:58:54,921 --> 01:58:58,883
- I can't believe you still... fussing.
- He gonna be late to his own funeral.

1657
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:00,718
Are you still fussing
about Louis?

1658
01:59:00,885 --> 01:59:03,596
He said he's gonna be here for us.

1659
01:59:03,763 --> 01:59:07,225
- Go ahead, call him.
- I ain't calling Louis.

1660
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:11,062
I'm gonna get my purse and...

1661
01:59:15,191 --> 01:59:18,486
What'd you say? Isaiah?

1662
01:59:18,653 --> 01:59:22,198
I see you got... your mark here.

1663
01:59:24,033 --> 01:59:26,160
I'm gonna fall all over myself.

1664
01:59:26,327 --> 01:59:29,247
Baby, you need...
to move that to the other side.

1665
01:59:42,635 --> 01:59:44,428
Baby?

1666
01:59:47,181 --> 01:59:49,308
Honey?

1667
01:59:52,144 --> 01:59:53,688
You sleeping?

1668
01:59:57,692 --> 01:59:59,277
Baby?

1669
02:00:01,654 --> 02:00:03,573
Are you all right?

1670
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:30,766
<i>...states will be closing, </i>

1671
02:00:30,933 --> 02:00:33,019
<i>and there are some big ones,
especially California, </i>

1672
02:00:33,185 --> 02:00:35,187
<i>the largest state
in the United States, </i>

1673
02:00:35,354 --> 02:00:36,981
<i>with 55 electoral votes.</i>

1674
02:00:37,148 --> 02:00:39,942
<i>Hawaii, that's where
Barack Obama was born.</i>

1675
02:00:40,109 --> 02:00:41,819
<i>will be closing its polls.</i>

1676
02:00:41,986 --> 02:00:45,239
<i>Idaho, Oregon
and Washington state, </i>

1677
02:00:45,406 --> 02:00:47,533
<i>and those states
have been going Democratic</i>

1678
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:49,827
<i>in presidential contests
in recent years.</i>

1679
02:00:49,994 --> 02:00:51,454
<i>So in a few seconds</i>

1680
02:00:51,621 --> 02:00:53,748
<i>those states
will be closing their polls, </i>

1681
02:00:53,915 --> 02:00:56,500
<i>and presumably we'll
be able to see what's...</i>

1682
02:00:56,667 --> 02:00:58,502
Louis!

1683
02:00:58,669 --> 02:01:00,504
<i>...a major projection at that point.</i>

1684
02:01:00,671 --> 02:01:03,883
<i>This is a moment that a lot of
people have been waiting for...</i>

1685
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:06,510
Louis, come on down!
Come down!

1686
02:01:06,677 --> 02:01:08,721
<i>...could be rather historic.</i>

1687
02:01:10,598 --> 02:01:14,143
<i>And CNN can now project
that Barack Obama, 47 years old, </i>

1688
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:16,771
<i>will become the President-Elect</i>

1689
02:01:16,938 --> 02:01:20,024
<i>of the United States. We project...</i>

1690
02:01:20,191 --> 02:01:23,402
<i>If there is anyone out there</i>

1691
02:01:23,569 --> 02:01:27,531
<i>who still doubts that America
is a place where</i>

1692
02:01:27,698 --> 02:01:29,533
<i>all things are possible...</i>

1693
02:01:30,826 --> 02:01:37,208
<i>...who still wonders if the dream of our
founders is alive in our time, </i>

1694
02:01:37,375 --> 02:01:41,462
<i>who still questions
the power of our democracy, </i>

1695
02:01:41,629 --> 02:01:44,006
<i>tonight is your answer.</i>

1696
02:02:49,321 --> 02:02:52,074
<i>You must look
through their eyes...</i>

1697
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:56,787
<i>...see what it is that they want...</i>

1698
02:02:58,581 --> 02:03:01,292
<i>...see what it is that they need...</i>

1699
02:03:03,210 --> 02:03:05,212
<i>...anticipate...</i>

1700
02:03:08,257 --> 02:03:12,094
...bring a smile
to the principal's eyes.

1701
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:22,480
Mr. Gaines.

1702
02:03:22,646 --> 02:03:24,982
I'm Admiral Rochon, the chief usher.

1703
02:03:31,238 --> 02:03:35,993
- Nice to meet you, admiral.
- Pleasure's all mine, sir.

1704
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:42,291
I just wanted to tell you
what an honor it is to meet you, sir.

1705
02:03:43,793 --> 02:03:45,336
The honor is mine.

1706
02:03:45,503 --> 02:03:48,214
The president's so excited
to meet with you.

1707
02:03:49,423 --> 02:03:50,966
Well...

1708
02:03:54,011 --> 02:03:56,514
...that's just fine, isn't it?

1709
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:58,516
Let me show
you the way.

1710
02:03:58,682 --> 02:04:00,518
I know the way.

1711
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:06,816
<i>The heart of the question is, </i>

1712
02:04:06,982 --> 02:04:10,152
<i>whether all Americans
are to be afforded equal rights</i>

1713
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:12,988
<i>and equal opportunities.</i>

1714
02:04:13,155 --> 02:04:19,537
<i>It is the effort of American
Negroes to secure for themselves</i>

1715
02:04:19,703 --> 02:04:24,291
<i>the full blessings of American life.</i>

1716
02:04:24,458 --> 02:04:26,710
<i>We will respond
with that timeless creed</i>

1717
02:04:29,672 --> 02:04:31,507
<i>Yes, we can.</i>
