1
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:19,000
Whoa! Unidentified flying object

2
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:35,417
And spin up. Woo!

3
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,333
B-girl, you got some sick moves.

4
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:41,083
Yeah, she could probably do something nuts.
- Oh, yeah? Try this.

5
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,167
Everyone knows they've got bigger fish
to fry than breakdancing, okay?

6
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,250
Yeah, I've got, like...
tunas to fry.

7
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,792
Wow...

8
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,375
I found literally
the best dress at Grandma's.

9
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,792
So good, right?

10
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,417
Don't worry, Molly,
I brought you a dress.

11
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,083
No need. I'm going
for my goihic Lifile Bo Peep.

12
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:34,292
Okay, well, you can't,
'cause that's Alicia's thing.

13
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,083
Though you would look good
with some cheek piercings.

14
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:38,750
No one's doing that right now.

15
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,583
Uh, Molly, a word?

16
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:50,167
Do you wont me to clear out?
- No, it's cool, Ben.

17
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,625
We're all stuck on this planet together.

18
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,417
So, alien,

19
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,792
banjo, graphic-novelling
and now breakdance.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,542
You were completely devoted
to each of these.

21
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,458
I was.

22
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,792
And then I wasn't

23
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,667
Ben, you should hear
this girl play banjo.

24
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,042
Clawhammer?
- I know, I know.

25
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,625
I'm the next Matokie Slaughte.

26
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,333
Come see me Monday with a plan.

27
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:21,625
If you don't like the electives on offer,
you can pick anything in the entire universe.

28
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,708
A parallel universe, even.

29
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,208
But you'd better do it quickly,

30
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:29,167
because it's frickin' March.

31
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,583
Leaf broccoli?

32
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,250
Come, you spirits that tend
on mortal thoughts,

33
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,333
unsex me here.

34
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,708
And fill me from the crown
to the toe,

35
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:54,083
top-full of direst cruelty.

36
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,000
A bold interpretation, Alicia.

37
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:03,417
I can't believe I hooked up with her
during her bi-curious phase.

38
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,542
Molly Maxwell.

39
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,083
Think you can top that?

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,875
I have a sore throat.

41
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,708
Come on, Molly, don't do
the boring slacker thing with me.

42
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:17,375
She's not a slacker, okay?
She has a genius IQ, FYI.

43
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:22,333
Right. I forgot everyone of Phoenix
is a precious snowflake.

44
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,167
Please just be ready for next time.

45
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,542
I have it in my teeth.

46
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,917
Aw. Yeah, you actually
drew blood that time,

47
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,792
I promise you.
- Well, beauty is pain.

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,583
Um... okay, it says
to just put it on your tongue.

49
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:58,500
Okay... one for you.

50
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,458
Say, "Ah!"

51
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:10,208
Molly, are you okay?

52
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,750
Hello? Genius.

53
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,875
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and Tomorrow,
creeps in this petty pace from day to day.

54
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,292
To the last syllable of recorded time,
and all our yesterdays have lighted fools

55
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,125
the way to dusty death. Out, out,brief candle.
Life’s but a walking shadow,

56
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,042
a poor player, that struts and frets his hour
upon the stage, and then is heard no more.

57
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,333
It is a tale fold by an idiot,
full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

58
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,792
9.4 seconds.

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,292
Wow.

60
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,792
Oh, it's you again.

61
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,833
So, what are you on?

62
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,208
Acid, but I'm not a slacker.

63
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,583
Kids still do acid?

64
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:11,167
I kinda came out here
to be alone, so...

65
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,792
All right.

66
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:19,750
What you need to do is find a safe place
to go and enjoy it.

67
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,625
I know right now it might feel
like you're never gonna be normal again,

68
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,125
that you're gonna spend the rest of your life
trapped in some guest bathroom seeing elves

69
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:33,083
climbing out the wallpaper,
but... you'll come down eventually.

70
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,542
Hi. I'm Ben Carter.
I'm Molly's English teacher.

71
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,292
Evan Maxwell.
She's not in any trouble, is she?

72
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,750
No, just a little bit
too much Red Bull, I think.

73
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,250
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Maxwell.

74
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,042
No sleepover tonight?
- Shit!

75
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,292
What if we've been
permanently altered by this?

76
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,583
I think we should just stay
in this fort forever.

77
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,792
Yeah, let's never leave.

78
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,208
What's the big deal, Raymond?
I have a decent average.

79
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:20,458
True. But the elective program
is what makes Phoenix so special.

80
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,500
Have you ever thought
that maybe everyone at this school

81
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:27,792
is a little too special?
- No, I haven't

82
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,500
You know, Molly,

83
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,417
this planet isn't made
for every alien,

84
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,083
but I, for one,
would be very disappointed

85
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:41,292
if it turned out that regular school
was a better match for you than Phoenix.

86
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,208
No! I'll just...

87
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,500
I'll figure something out
by tomorrow, okay?

88
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,833
Okay
- Okay

89
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,542
That's my favourite star child.

90
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,417
Okay.

91
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,625
What did Raymond want?

92
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,250
Well, you know, I'm just getting
a prodigy of the Year award.

93
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,250
You know, Tafiana Thinks
I have a real shot at this Fairfax school.

94
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,458
Is's almost impossible
to get on audition.

95
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,292
Call me later, okay?

96
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

97
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:17,458
Hi.

98
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,916
What are you listening to?
- Paint Thinners.

99
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,250
You heard of them before?
- Yeah.

100
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,667
They're on my dad's label.
Maxwell Music.

101
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,208
Maxwell Music.
That's pretty cool.

102
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,292
Yeah.
- So?

103
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,792
You solve the great
elective conundrum yet?

104
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,667
No, but Raymond has threatened
to kick me out of school

105
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,625
if I don't pick something.
- So pick something.

106
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,458
I can't find the right thing.
- It's just an elective.

107
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:53,125
All right, well, I saw
you were taking pictures at the dance

108
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,667
before you had that little meltdown.

109
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,458
Maybe you could do something
with that.

110
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,792
They were just stupid pictures
of my friends.

111
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,792
Lorry Wallace got: famous
faking pictures of his friends.

112
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,875
Is if any worse
than painting Unicorns,

113
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,875
or making paper sculptures
and setting them on fire?

114
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,208
What was that class called?
Art Therapy.

115
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,542
I like unicorns.
- Who doesn't?

116
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,625
That way, next to Crack Whore Alley?

117
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,792
Crack whores
are a photographer's dream.

118
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,917
Yeah, okay. See you.
- Hey, alien.

119
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,625
This whole elective thing doesn't have
to be some big life crisis, all right?

120
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,625
Just pick something that you don't hate,
and do it, and get Raymond off your back.

121
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,792
But I have to pick something
I can be great at.

122
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,958
For Christ's sake, you're 16!

123
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,875
You don't have to have a retrospective
at MoMA next year.

124
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,792
It's still just high school,
no matter what Phoenix says.

125
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,750
Good night, Molly.

126
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,917
'Night.

127
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,125
Hey-

128
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,333
I have to meet Caitlin
of the studio,

129
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,832
and your dad has a label thing,
with Heidi, so...

130
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,000
can you watch Aiden for me?
- I can stay by myself!

131
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,875
At school Today,
I saw cm owl barf up a skeleton.

132
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,375
Why do you have owls
at school?

133
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,375
He's something, isn't he?

134
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,458
He's really something.

135
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,792
What?
- Your brother.

136
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,792
Oh, yeah.

137
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,833
Don't get too carried away.

138
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:36,000
He'll probably end up on meih
working at the 7-Eleven.

139
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,458
Ouch.

140
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:46,083
What is that?
- It's for my new elective.

141
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,667
I was thinking of photography, maybe.

142
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,042
That's great!

143
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,750
Observing the world
from behind the lens.

144
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,458
I think your dad
has an old film camera here.

145
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,250
Yeah, but everything is
digital now, so...

146
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,458
We can go and see if there are
any workshops at Artscape.

147
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,875
Okay, don't.

148
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,458
Don't ruin it before I start,
so just...

149
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,292
Bye.

150
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,042
There's leftover kale
and quinoca soup. Bye!

151
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,542
Photography! Well, well.

152
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,792
I'd need someone to supervise
on independent study.

153
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,667
Maybe... Ben Carter?

154
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,833
He seems to know a lot
about photography.

155
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, Ben's sort of been parachuted
into this madness midyear.

156
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,667
It's a lot to cope with.

157
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,458
But Wendy,
maybe Wendy could do if.

158
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,667
I can't wait to see your warped photos!

159
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,792
Maybe this is the ticket!

160
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,042
Don't have a fit or anything.
- I can if I want.

161
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,292
You guys might recall
that this natural versus unnatural stuff

162
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,417
we also discussed
when we were of Hamlet last month.

163
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,417
Thank you for your undivided attention,
as usual.

164
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,583
So? What makes you think

165
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,125
that teaching photography
to a chronic bailer like you

166
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,167
is how I wcmf to spend my free time?

167
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,667
I've heard you didn't have
anything else to do. It's like charity.

168
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,333
I heard Wendy was gonna do it.
- I'd feel really bad

169
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:28,083
taking her away from Art Therapy.
It's important work.

170
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,625
I'm sorry, Molly.

171
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,458
I just don't think it's for me.

172
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,792
Really? I thought you'd be into it.

173
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,792
You know, helping with my conspiracy
to beat the system.

174
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,958
Like pirates.

175
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,375
Conspiracy pirates.

176
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,667
Yep.

177
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,750
Your mom's poor local
organic heart will just break.

178
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,417
It's her own fault.

179
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:10,208
Remember that hardcore super vegan kid
Anthony at your eighth birthday party?

180
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:13,208
Oh, my God.
He chowed like 10 hotdogs

181
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,750
and then barfed
all over the carpet.

182
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,417
Hey, is that the phone ringing?
I think MoMA's calling.

183
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:24,000
Thank Larry Wallace
and all his naked people.

184
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,375
Woo naked people
hell yeah

185
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:30,000
You mean you actually looked him up?
- Who's Larry Wallace?

186
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,167
So, were you suggesting I fake
photos of my naked friends as an elective?

187
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,792
Because I'm prelly sure that's illegal.

188
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,792
Wait, who? the fuck
are you guys talking about?

189
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,917
I didn't even think about that.

190
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,542
Well, I gotta go pick up
my teacher of the Year award, so...

191
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,792
Yeah.

192
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,875
What was that all about?

193
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,458
All right, come with me.
- I'm going to Kensington with Caitlin and Gala.

194
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,417
It'll just take a minute.

195
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,167
Right Well, Raymond
promised me a dark room.

196
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,833
Great.

197
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:14,000
I think it hasn't been used for years.

198
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,208
Dark room?
- Yes, a dark room.

199
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,958
You know, like for photography
in ancient times?

200
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,208
And what's wrong with digital?
- No, if I'm gonna do this,

201
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,458
Then I'm gonna do it properly.
I'm not a slacker.

202
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,292
Wow.

203
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,958
Well, wasn't the idea
just to get Raymond off my back?

204
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,625
I don't recall saying
that you wouldn't have to do any work,

205
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,417
just that you didn't have
to be the next Diane Arbus.

206
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,250
Right. Diane Arbus.
Love her.

207
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,375
Look her up.

208
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,292
Well, of least we have
a spinning wheel.

209
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,083
No, make your eyes look more dead.

210
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,625
And don't do that with your lips.

211
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,833
Just look bored.

212
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:07,833
If you don't like how I'm doing if,
then fake pictures of Gala.

213
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,833
Just don't pose so much.

214
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,625
I think you look hot.

215
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,375
Ben was telling me
about this really awesome photographer

216
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,958
who takes pictures
of all kinds of freaks.

217
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,583
I heard that Ben rides
a motorcycle.

218
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,667
I don't think that's true.

219
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,583
But he is in a band.
- Look who's The Ben expert.

220
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,958
Yep, just like that, Gala.

221
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,167
Hey... do you ride o motorcycle?

222
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,458
No. Why? Should I?

223
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,750
I don't know, probably.

224
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,833
Maybe we shouldn't look of this batch.
- You're like a boiling tea ketle.

225
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,916
What does that even mean?

226
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,583
I don't know, actually.

227
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,792
Okay.

228
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,042
All right.

229
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,958
The moment of truth.

230
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,667
Not too shabby.

231
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,458
Of course, they'd be better
it they were in focus

232
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,458
and not overexposed,
but it's not like those are

233
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,417
the basic principles
of photography or anything.

234
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:37,250
Not bad.

235
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,792
Not one word, Mom.
- Okay, okay, I just think it's great.

236
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,667
That was seven words.

237
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,833
Take my picture.
- Can you turn your body info a pretzel?

238
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:54,000
I can try.

239
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,625
See? You're a natural.

240
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,000
I think it'll be very cool
to have a photographer

241
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,292
in the family.
- Mom!

242
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,000
Just saying.
- You'll want to cut down

243
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,958
on the practice there, monkey.
Your body's starting to look weird.

244
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,917
Wanna come see Heidi Slater?
- Yeah!

245
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,625
See ya.

246
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,958
Isn't she something?

247
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:49,833
What are you doing here?
- My dad's over there.

248
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,333
She's gonna be the next Feisf, apparently.
- Oh, thank God for that.

249
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:54,917
We need a new one.

250
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,250
Do you think your dad
could introduce us?

251
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,583
And you could do your English homework
of the bar while you wait.

252
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,625
I actually have some work to do
in the dark room.

253
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,708
Dude, I scored some pot cookies.

254
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,167
It's not exactly how I want
to spend the afternoon either,

255
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,958
but I have to pass.

256
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,458
Save me a cookie!
- Lame! You're lame!

257
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,583
Favourite food?

258
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,292
Sushi

259
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,792
Very sophisticated.

260
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,583
Yeah.

261
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,792
What's your real favourite food?

262
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,125
Sushi

263
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,583
What's your real favourite f--
- Okay, nachos!

264
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,583
That's what I thought.

265
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,375
Keep doing that.

266
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,875
Favourite place.

267
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,458
The island, probably.

268
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,083
That's specific.

269
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,083
Toronto Island.
You don't know?

270
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:06,292
It's just across the lake,
but it's like another planet.

271
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,458
Raymond must love that.
- You know it.

272
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,667
There's a lot of great stuff there, like...

273
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,875
A lame amusement park.

274
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,458
I love lame amusement parks.
- Yeah.

275
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,875
We should go there on a field Trip.
I'm tired of taking photos of my friends.

276
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,667
I'm tired of your friends.

277
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,083
And there's a lot of little cottages,
and no cars,

278
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,875
and beaches,

279
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,832
and a ferry.

280
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,832
I love ferries.

281
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,417
Who doesn't?

282
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,542
We should just go there right now.

283
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,833
Yeah... probably not kosher.

284
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,875
It's for the good of my art.

285
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,083
You'd be saving me
from my fated Starbucks.

286
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:59,000
It's not even really a big deal.

287
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,667
I didn't realize
you were such a conformist.

288
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,250
So, what's your favourite band?
- I'm not telling you that.

289
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,667
No, you'll just totally judge me.

290
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,792
As if. Come on, who is if?

291
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,292
Probably...

292
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,375
The Ghost Buttons.

293
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:50,167
That's a mode-up name, isn't it?
So, what happened to your band?

294
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,000
How'd you know I was in a band?

295
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:54,708
Google.

296
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,375
Googled me, huh?

297
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,583
Boring story.

298
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:05,042
The industry's just terrible these days.
- That sucks.

299
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,542
Yeah, I wish I could import that
to the fabulous students of Phoenix.

300
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,625
You can be as wonderful and talented

301
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,708
and unique as you like, but...

302
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:16,708
if doesn't mean
your dream's gonna come true

303
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,792
just 'cause everybody says
you can do whatever you want.

304
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,792
Raymond would spontaneously combust.

305
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,458
Maybe you just weren't that good.
- Probably.

306
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:31,125
Anyway, teaching is a noble profession.

307
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,083
I guess you could always play
guitar in the subway for change

308
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:36,625
if that doesn't work out.

309
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,083
Yeah, you could drop an elective
so you'll be right there with rne.

310
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,042
Not me. Haven't you heard?

311
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,417
I have the IQ of a genius.

312
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,458
They probably just added up
the scores wrong.

313
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,792
You know, this place...

314
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,708
it's not half bad.

315
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,917
Oh, my God, no.
Do not bother. Waste of film.

316
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,792
Okay.

317
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,958
You probably shouldn't develop those.

318
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,625
She's going to Parkdale.

319
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:21,167
There wasn't a phone anywhere.
- Well, maybe...

320
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,833
you should've called before you went
to the island alone in the dark.

321
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,708
Hey, Aiden.
Jesus, enough already. Go to bed!

322
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,708
It wasn't dark when I went,

323
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:33,042
and... if I had a cellphone, this...

324
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,833
wouldn't be an issue.
- I expect more from you.

325
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,832
Why?
- Well, maybe it is time

326
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,667
we got her a cellphone.
- Daddy...

327
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,167
Molly...

328
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,542
don't make plans for a while.

329
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,042
Whoa, what?

330
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,042
Since when are you,
like, an authoritarian?

331
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,333
What? When?
- Shut the front door.

332
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,875
I'm really sorry. Fucking streetcar.
I actually waited for three full ones

333
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,458
to go by, and tell me you haven't read
Savage Love yet.

334
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,042
We were waiting for you, duh.

335
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,625
Where were you yesterday?

336
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,333
Gala broke up with Andy.
- What? Why?

337
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:32,333
I thought you were obsessed with her.
- She was just such a girl, it was annoying.

338
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,083
So, where were you?

339
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,333
I actually went to the island
to fake some pictures.

340
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,083
But with who?

341
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,792
No one.
- You went by yourself?

342
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,333
Okay, well, actually--
- I can't believe

343
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,417
you ditched us to be a loner.

344
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,792
Well, I did get grounded.
Can you believe that?

345
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:57,167
Marilyn grounded you?
- What about the Egg Castles show?

346
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:02,167
You know, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess
if you'd just come over.

347
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,167
Come on, sit.

348
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,292
"Relax and you'll squirt."

349
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:12,333
What?

350
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,542
How's Ben working out?
- Photography?

351
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,542
Yeah.
- Yeah, I really like it.

352
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh, beautiful. We need someone
to document the crazy energy

353
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,833
happening around here these days.

354
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,167
That's me.

355
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,125
The media is filled
with negative gender stereotypes.

356
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:42,333
For example, women are expected
to be small and graceful,

357
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:44,583
while men are expected
to be fall and broad--

358
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,833
You guys did it here in town?
- Hey.

359
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,667
When are we gonna meet again?
I developed two rolls but I don't--

360
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,792
Yep, I'll get back to you on that,
Molly.

361
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:55,250
If you'd just fake your seat
You're a little bit late.

362
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,125
Yo, who's the babe?

363
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,832
...I'll interduce you, and just...
- Yeah.

364
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:07,792
Okay.

365
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,750
All right, so I've got something
really cool for you guys today.

366
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:16,458
This is Jordon Dunhill.
She's a filmmaker, here, in Toronto,

367
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,375
and she's gonna show us
her ultra-modern take on Macbeth.

368
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,625
Trust me, you guys
have never seen Macbeth quite like this.

369
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,625
Thanks, Ben.

370
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,125
You're pretty lucky
to have this guy as your teacher.

371
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,792
Now, it's a bit shocking in parts.

372
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:35,000
For example, Macbeth is played
by Marian Smithley, a woman.

373
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,458
Hey there. How was your day?

374
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,667
Fine.
- Just fine?

375
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,667
No, Mom, it was the best day of my life!

376
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,625
Can I go to this talent night thing?

377
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,333
That sounds like torture.

378
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,583
It's a school... Yeah.
It's a s-school activity,

379
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:26,292
so yeah, yeah, I guess so.

380
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,250
So that means she can come
to the Egg Castles, huh?

381
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,125
Well, no, she's grounded.

382
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,375
But you just said I could go
to talent night.

383
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,916
Because that's different;
it's not a concert.

384
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,833
Egg Castles are way more talented
than anyone at my school.

385
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,458
I gotta go.

386
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,125
I know that you need
your privacy more these days--

387
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,458
Mom.

388
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,667
How many of these tolks
do we really have to have?

389
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,208
Well, I was prelly clueless
about my own sexuality

390
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:24,792
for a very long time,
which affected my self-esteem,

391
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,125
which led to bad decisions, and--
- Like what?

392
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,042
And that's another conversation.

393
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,500
You may not want to talk to me
about anything.

394
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:38,458
But"...

395
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:42,916
we're going to planned Parenthood,
and you're going to get the pill,

396
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:45,000
or the ring... Actually,
there's a lot of options out there now,

397
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:48,000
and you can just talk to the doctor about it.
- I'm no': having sex.

398
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,792
You're acting different.

399
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:55,208
Anything you wont to talk to me about?
- No.

400
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:00,917
Maybe this will help.

401
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,208
Dinner's almost ready.

402
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,958
Oh, God. Really?

403
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,167
You're in for a treat.

404
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:32,125
Just kidding.
It's gonna be really uncomfortable.

405
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,125
So, you want to go on birth control?

406
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:37,333
My mom wants me to,
even though I'm not!

407
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,292
...you know, having sex.

408
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,833
Do you have a boyfriend?
- I like someone.

409
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:47,292
But... it's compli...
it's complicated.

410
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,625
Well, I can prescribe you
birth control,

411
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,792
but if doesn't mean you have to go have sex
all over the place.

412
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:54,667
I'll try not to have sex
all over the place.

413
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,792
Well, I mean, what would you do?

414
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,083
Would you fell him you like him,
or what?

415
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,792
Well, I'm prefiy straight forward,

416
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,125
so... I'd probably
let him know somehow.

417
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,250
You printed photos.

418
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,917
So, how are you doing?

419
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,417
Good.

420
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:17,625
Great.

421
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,333
How's Jordan?

422
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:23,792
Jordan?

423
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,583
Yeah.

424
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,458
She seems... interesting.

425
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,125
Yeah, you would think that, right?

426
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:39,500
I mean, her parents are actually,
like, carnies from the circus,

427
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,750
but she is extremely dull.

428
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:44,083
It's the weirdest thing.

429
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,458
You know how to make
your contact sheet yet?

430
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:10,417
So, Caitlin made me...

431
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:14,667
promise to check out
that ridiculous talent night.

432
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,458
I thought I'd take some photos.

433
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:21,042
So many precious snowflakes
in one room.

434
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,125
It's like a blizzard.

435
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,792
Wow!

436
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:51,750
So, who's next?
- Ben should play something.

437
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,667
No, Molly, I think this is
a student talent night,

438
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,667
so maybe you should
demonstrate your skills.

439
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,625
Yeah, but photography
doesn't translate to the stage, so...

440
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:03,792
Come on, Ben! Don't be lame.
- Yeah, come on, Ben. Don't be lame.

441
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:08,708
Go, Ben!

442
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:14,875
Okay, well, I should probably
apologize in advance.

443
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,042
Here's a song
by some city mates of yours.

444
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,500
Okay, now he is sexy.

445
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,208
Maybe I should go for it.

446
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,667
I'm not gonna lie to you.

447
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,792
It was a great show.
- This is the worst Easter ever.

448
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,042
Well, of least your sentence is over.

449
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,500
Hey, I had a drink
with your English teacher last night.

450
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:40,792
You had a drink with Ben?
- He's young, huh?

451
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,958
You kids must eat him for breakfast.

452
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,542
What did you guys talk about?
- Oh, you know,

453
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,625
how shit the music industry is, the usual.
Seems like a good guy, though.

454
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,333
Did he mention me?
- Yeah.

455
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:55,208
He said you are super cool.

456
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:57,375
Really?

457
00:37:58,667 --> 00:37:59,875
Anything else?

458
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:03,458
Well, I don't remember the entire
conversation verbatim, Molly.

459
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,917
Oh, your mom wants you downstairs
for the hunt.

460
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,583
Seriously?

461
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:26,333
'Morning, honey.
- Good morning.

462
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,625
You gonna open up your clues?

463
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,792
Don't you think I'm too old for this?

464
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,417
You might wont to look in the tub.

465
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,958
No! An iPhone?
ls it for me?

466
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,667
I love you!

467
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,792
I want an iPhone!
That's not fair.

468
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,792
Who are you gonna call?
Mozart?

469
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:14,667
I don't think he has a cell.
Go get your Lego. Go play.

470
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:27,417
I'm gonna go meet Gala and Caitlin.
Will you tell Mom so she doesn't spaz out?

471
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,750
What about me spazzing out?

472
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,833
I'm gonna go meet Gala
and Caitlin, okay?

473
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:35,042
Sure. You want a ride?
I'm going to pick up a cellphone for Aiden.

474
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,042
Yep, and next Easter,

475
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,792
we can do firearms all around.
Might be tricky to hide, though.

476
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,625
You look really nice.
Say hi to the girls for me. Okay?

477
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,667
Okay
- Okay

478
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:52,917
You look amazing.

479
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,125
Wow. All grown up.

480
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,083
A'ight. See ya.

481
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:33,583
Hi.

482
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:37,250
Hey. I, um...

483
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,708
I just wanted to...
drop this off for you.

484
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:44,542
I didn't... think you'd be home.

485
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,917
Was gonna put if in your... mailbox?

486
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:07,958
I love this guy.

487
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,667
I actually have something for you too.

488
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,208
Just wait there one sec.

489
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:31,000
I was going to give These
to you at school.

490
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,583
I borrowed Them
from an artist friend of mine.

491
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:45,042
Wow. Was it Jordan?
-Yeah.

492
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,167
So they're probably boring.

493
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,042
You can probably come in for a sec.

494
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:02,458
Okay.

495
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,292
Cool place.

496
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,708
Sure, sit down.

497
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,917
Okay.

498
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,500
I love these.

499
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,750
So, you're having a good Easter?

500
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:42,708
Yes. Daddy gave me an iPhone.

501
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:45,958
Great. Now you're gonna become
one of those texting demons.

502
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,208
I ran into your dad again.

503
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,625
I heard. How was that?

504
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,208
A bit bizarre,
to tell you the truth.

505
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:10,708
Why?

506
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,042
No reason at all.

507
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,750
You know, Molly,
I actually have to get going pretty quick.

508
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:12,750
Yeah, me too.
I'm... meeting the girls.

509
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,833
So you were wallowing here in self-pity.

510
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:21,583
Yeah.

511
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,458
Drowning in scotch, actually.

512
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,875
So it's good I came by, then.

513
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah, you're a real godsend.

514
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,500
Hey. I am so sorry.

515
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,333
I got into a huge tight with my mom,
and I got held up.

516
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,250
So...

517
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,625
We talked to your mom.
She said you were with us.

518
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:01,792
So, where were you?
We were gonna leave without you.

519
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:06,250
Well... I met a guy
at the streetcar...

520
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,208
at the streetcar stop, and...

521
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:13,458
we got to talking and,
you know... walking around.

522
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:17,250
I didn't even realize my ringer was off.

523
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:22,500
Who is he?

524
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:27,583
His name's Spencer,
and... he goes to Parkdale.

525
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:29,792
Okay, what's he like?

526
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,167
He plays the trumpet

527
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,375
Ooh, a musician.

528
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,792
Like it?
- Yeah.

529
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,917
Tell me, tell me.
- He's in the gifted program.

530
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,917
He's gifted?
- Yep.

531
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,417
That's really great.

532
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,667
Well, you should invite him over.

533
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:51,250
Thai would probably, um...

534
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:53,250
end things pretty...

535
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:55,708
pretty quick.
- Yeah.

536
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,083
Yeah, I see your point.

537
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,542
Oh, my God!

538
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:48,500
Breakfast burrito?

539
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,125
No Thanks.
- Really?

540
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,458
Hi.

541
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:17,125
Hello.

542
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:30,792
Oh, no. Did I just ruin a print?

543
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It's fine. I think I ruined that myself.
- No, no, you're killing it.

544
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,125
Wow.

545
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,917
Your brother is a remarkably flexible
young man.

546
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:47,792
Are you okay?

547
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,542
I'm totally okay.

548
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:55,333
Are you okay?

549
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:59,125
I'm... scared shitless,
to be honest.

550
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,042
Rigth...

551
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,250
Sorry.

552
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,708
You're something else,
Molly Maxwell.

553
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:09,208
Is that a good thing?

554
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:12,917
No.
You're like a hand grenade.

555
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:17,792
All right, well...

556
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:21,000
keep up the good work, yeah?

557
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,750
If you want, you can...
come over later.

558
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:45,583
You're coming over, right?
- I can't. I'm meeting Spencer.

559
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,875
When do we get to meet this guy?

560
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,208
Soon.

561
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:54,125
Do you have a date with that new girl yet?

562
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,375
Yeah, but I'm not sure she's my type.

563
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:02,375
You should take a photo of him
and send it to us.

564
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,458
I'll try.

565
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:14,500
I'm pretty sure it's colder
in your apartment than it is outside.

566
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:17,917
An iglo would be warmer.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

567
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:22,583
Iglos are amazing because
the snow insulates them

568
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:24,792
and then your body heat
warms them up.

569
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,167
Is that so?
- Yes.

570
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:32,875
Well, it's also a fact people are warmer
without their clothes on,

571
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:35,000
in a sleeping bag, or...

572
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,667
a duvet.

573
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:41,458
That's a fact, is it?

574
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:51,875
You have some photographs
to show me?

575
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:56,792
What?
- I-I'd love to see some of your photos.

576
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:00,958
Sure.

577
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:48,625
Yeah...

578
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,583
This one's lovely.

579
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:58,458
Did you have to burn in this corner?

580
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:03,083
Yep. Dodged a bit there too.

581
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,833
Wow. Burning and dodging.
- I know.

582
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:11,292
Your mom looks ecstatic.

583
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:18,792
You don't really want to spend
The afternoon looking ot photos of my mom.

584
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,500
Clothing stays on.

585
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:42,792
Okay.

586
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:56,625
And then I said, "Richard,
you can't possibly go in there.

587
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,875
I already gave him
seven bananas!"

588
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:00,708
Not bad.

589
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:05,292
I don't want to go.

590
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,458
So just...
You should stay.

591
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
At least until the search party finds me.
-Yeah.

592
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:17,000
I could build a little dungeon
for you somewhere.

593
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:19,792
That was too far.

594
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,917
I'd just need a trickle of daylight.

595
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,000
He's not even stopping
to eat anymore?

596
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:01,000
He did. Saves a lot of time
when you don't chew.

597
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:05,125
Sit. Come on.
Tell me all about your date with Spencer.

598
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:07,083
I'm really tired.
I'm just gonna go to my room.

599
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:09,250
You want me
to get this developed?

600
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,250
What? No.

601
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,167
Don't go through my stuff.

602
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:14,792
Clean your own sheets then.

603
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:20,333
It could be cool, I guess.

604
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:23,667
Maybe they'll be more inspired
if it's something that they can relate to.

605
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:26,458
I mean, if you made the assignment
info an iPhone app,

606
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:28,042
then maybe you'd have something.

607
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:32,792
You turned me into a precious snowflake.
Isn't that enough?

608
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,208
Right. Maybe I should use
that stellar technique

609
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:37,042
with the rest of the class.

610
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,750
Shit, gotta go.

611
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,958
Hey. Who you talking to?

612
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:45,708
Aunt Suzy.

613
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:49,792
Oh. Want to go to a secret
Joel Plasketi concert?

614
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:52,792
I'm not really
into Joel Plasketi that much.

615
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,250
No? I thought you were.

616
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:57,833
We could have a Guitar Hero marathon.

617
00:55:58,708 --> 00:56:01,458
I kind of have a ton
of homework, so...

618
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:03,667
Okay.

619
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:14,125
Hey-

620
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,625
Okay.

621
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:22,833
Today, we're going to be starting
our poetry unit.

622
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,916
So, M, you get a boyfriend,
and you just decide to peace out?

623
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,125
No, I've just been really busy
with photo.

624
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,167
But all of you guys
actually listen to poetry

625
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,125
every single day in a sense...

626
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:35,958
on your iPods.

627
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:38,750
So, we're going to start
this unit by looking at songs

628
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:41,542
as modern-day poetry,
then we're gonna write our own.

629
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,042
What are some of your favourite songs?
- Lady Gaga.

630
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,458
The Wordsworth of pop.
- This is so lame.

631
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:51,083
Great Anybody else?
- I like The Zombies.

632
00:56:51,292 --> 00:56:52,250
Starr?

633
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:55,792
Very nice to see you awake.
Any song in particular?

634
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,500
I don't know the names
of the songs.

635
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,625
Okay. Well...
- So, have you guys done if yet?

636
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:05,417
No!

637
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,667
Told you so.

638
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:11,417
Yeah, pick a song,
write down the lyrics,

639
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,083
we'll meet back here
and discuss it.

640
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:15,000
Okay?

641
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,500
Holy shit!

642
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,750
So, did you get out
to the Tiger Rod show last night?

643
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:02,375
No. I had a stack of papers to grade.

644
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,167
Oh, that's a shame.
It was epic.

645
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:06,458
Dad, you're too old to say "epic".

646
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:09,167
Oh, look who's too cool
for her dad now, huh?

647
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,042
Please don't embarrass yourself.

648
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,792
So, Ben...

649
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,042
Well...

650
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,375
Molly's... assignments

651
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:28,792
and her class attendance
have been much more consistent.

652
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,542
Good. That's great.

653
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:36,417
Yeah, and her independent study
is going brilliantly.

654
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:39,708
She's printing her own photographs
in the dark room already.

655
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:42,000
Photos? Tic-Toe,
why didn't you tell me?

656
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,792
Show Them your photographs, Molly.

657
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:45,917
Yeah.

658
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,375
Molly...

659
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:00,250
These are so good.

660
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,917
Oh, yeah. That one's great.
You should be doing my band photos.

661
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,250
Maybe we should just get you

662
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:09,542
info a summer camp--
- Okay, can we please go?

663
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:16,833
Couldn't you have pretended to be sick
or something? I mean, for Christ's sake.

664
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:21,292
I tried. I'd have to be on my deathbed
for her to miss a conference.

665
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,500
All right, right now,
where are you supposed to be?

666
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,417
Homework at Alice.

667
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,333
Seriously?

668
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,708
So, you think your parents
will accept me into the family now?

669
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,292
My dad wants to marry you himself.

670
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,333
You know, 200 years ago,

671
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,792
no one would have any problem

672
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,417
if I took you as my child bride.

673
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:08,458
Cleopatra was, like,
ruling Egypt when she was my age.

674
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:11,042
Is that even true?
- Yeah.

675
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:18,458
I think you'd make a great pharaoh.

676
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:36,125
Hey. Clothing stays on.

677
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,417
I'm not taking them off.

678
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:01,417
What?

679
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:05,333
Wh-what?

680
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:08,417
I don't know what I'm doing!

681
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:16,750
Stop!

682
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:20,375
How's Spencer?

683
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:23,958
He's good. I think he's winning
some trumpet awards.

684
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,625
I should...
- Are you hearing from Fairfax?

685
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,125
Any day now.
- God, it's excruciating.

686
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:33,250
Hey, Ben,
where are your pyjamas?

687
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,708
Oh, I forgot all about it.

688
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:43,583
Shit...

689
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,042
By the wow-

690
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:02,750
Hey-

691
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:05,667
I got the prerelease
of the new Ghost Buttons.

692
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:07,958
Can you take your seat,
please, Molly, so we can start'?

693
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:16,125
All right, so, I Thought we could read
a few of your songs today.

694
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,833
Anybody like to go first?
- Me!

695
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,417
I dreamt I carved your initials
into my heart.

696
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:34,208
With each beat, they grew
and warped like a tree over the years.

697
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:38,083
I dreamed I carved your initials
into my heart.

698
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,583
With each beat--
- Molly.

699
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:45,792
How long have you been in yhis class?
Now you're gonna fuck around on your phone?

700
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,167
Go see Raymond.
- Why?

701
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:51,583
Because you're blatantly disrespecfing me--
- Well, you're being an asshole.

702
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:54,417
Get out.

703
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,375
What do you want me
to tell him, Mr. Carter?

704
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,500
You can fell him you're acting
like a spoiled brat.

705
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,417
He's crazy.

706
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:13,750
Are your moons out of orbit today
or something?

707
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:16,833
Ask Ben. He just freaked out on me
for no reason.

708
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:19,958
Your call is important to us.
Please hold.

709
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,292
Well, what do you think you did?

710
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,167
I don't even know.

711
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:04,500
Hey, Ben...

712
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,375
Hey! I'm drawing here!
- I'm surprised

713
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:26,042
you're allowed to do anything else
with your precious hands.

714
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,375
Mom! Mom!

715
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,583
Jesus. What?

716
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:34,750
Molly broke my pencil!
- He threw it at me!

717
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:38,042
Could've taken my eye out!
- God, Molly. You've been home

718
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,792
for, what, two minutes?

719
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,042
You always take his side!
- You were supposed

720
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,833
to pick up Aiden from piano.
He waited an hour

721
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:47,583
before they called me.
- Isn't he old enough to get him a cellphone?

722
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:49,542
You're really acting
like a spoiled brol lately.

723
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:50,750
You're becoming a total bitch.

724
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:53,792
I'm literally gonna punch you
in the face if you don't leave now.

725
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:42,792
Right, I'll show you, I'll start.

726
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:02,958
Hi.

727
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:14,625
Guess what?

728
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:18,417
Alicia cast a sex spell on me today.

729
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,500
Left a note on my desk.

730
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,792
Is if working?

731
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:27,167
I don't know yet.

732
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:31,250
Do you think I... seem different?

733
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:33,500
You're a jerk.

734
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:41,458
Look, just... never wear pigtails
ever again.

735
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,375
Promise me.

736
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:46,875
Yeah.

737
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:53,583
Hey, Raymond.
- Hi.

738
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,000
Wow. Look of all your photos.

739
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:03,125
This is interesting.

740
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:11,333
Ben, can I have a word
with you in my office

741
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:15,042
when you're done here?
- I can come right now.

742
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,458
Great work, Molly.

743
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:43,917
Raymond was asking questions
about us.

744
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:46,042
He sent me home.
- What? Why?

745
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,125
What did he say?
- He was asking about the fight

746
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,792
and why we're spending
so much time together.

747
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:52,125
You're my photo advisor.

748
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:55,292
I could go to jail, Molly.

749
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:59,125
I'm above age in Canada.
I looked it up.

750
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,208
Not if I'm your teacher.

751
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:06,875
Look...

752
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,542
Well, don't be surprised
if Raymond wants to talk to you as well.

753
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,167
Fuck me, he's gonna call your parents.

754
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:19,417
I'll just fell them you're my new talent.
- Molly...

755
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,125
This is not funny.

756
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:28,458
But...

757
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:30,875
I can still come over, right?

758
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:35,958
I don't think so.

759
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:41,750
And I'm gonna need you
to clear out your phone as well.

760
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:47,917
If that's what you want.
I don't want to get you in trouble.

761
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:49,875
Let's do it.

762
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:58,458
Come on.
What if this is our last chance?

763
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:02,167
Would you rather I lose it to some asshole
after a bunch of beer bongs?

764
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,417
Is that really the only other option?

765
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:06,958
Probably.

766
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:20,458
It just feels wrong.

767
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,167
I don't see the difference
between this and the other stuff.

768
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,750
Well, you might
when you're a little bit older.

769
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,708
Nice.

770
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:34,750
Condescending, or what?

771
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,458
Don't be childish.

772
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,958
Mommy and Daddy
are probably looking for me.

773
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:44,875
Wouldn't want to keep them waiting.

774
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,333
I need you to delete
those text messages now.

775
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:34,792
You okay?

776
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,083
Supposedly,
she got a huge tattoo of a pentagram

777
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:44,000
on her back right above her ass.
What's up with that?

778
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,792
She is a witch.

779
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,125
Her parents are witches foo.
It's like witch pride or something.

780
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:55,125
Yeah, but a big witch tattoo at 16?
Isn't that a little nutso?

781
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:59,792
God, I mean, why do people feel
this constant need

782
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,375
to shove their beliefs
down everyone's throat?

783
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,333
Like mine?

784
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,583
You know, at least Sierra
wouldn't stop being  witch

785
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:13,292
'cause some guy came around.
- Yeah, she wouldn't, like,

786
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,792
ditch her witches.

787
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:38,542
I love the violin.

788
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:09,042
Okay.

789
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:14,542
Okay.

790
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:17,375
Okay. okay?

791
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,167
All right? Okay.

792
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:29,458
It's okay.

793
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:36,042
It's Spencer.
You want to tell him you're okay?

794
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:37,250
Don't

795
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:42,125
Okay.

796
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:56,250
Tic-Tue.

797
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:01,792
You need some greasy brunch
to soak up that hangover?

798
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,875
Go away.

799
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:12,917
Ben Carter has resigned.

800
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:14,417
What?

801
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,542
This isn't even on school property.

802
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:23,375
You want to talk about that?

803
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:25,792
I was practicing making a fake photo.

804
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,583
Ben's superimposed.
- Molly.

805
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,042
This isn't a fake photo, is it?

806
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,375
Well, that doesn't prove anything.

807
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:38,625
Molly, the fact is, leaving school
property with a student, alone,

808
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:42,417
without the permission of your parents,
is a serious enough offence just on its own.

809
01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:44,875
We were just taking photos.
Nothing happened.

810
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,458
What could have happened?

811
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:50,000
Are you gonna bring out
the bad touching doll now?

812
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:54,042
Give me a break.
- Molly! Show him some respect.

813
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:57,417
Okay, look,
this happens all the time, okay?

814
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:59,833
In fact, just last week,
I met a girl your age

815
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:03,250
who was being taken advantage of
by her basketball coach.

816
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:05,458
She thought she was special,

817
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:08,750
Thought she was the only one
he'd ever break the rules for.

818
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,208
Turns out he'd done it four times.

819
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:15,042
No one took advantage of me.

820
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,542
We need to discuss if you and your parents
want to press charges

821
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,750
against Ben Carter.
- For-- No!

822
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:27,958
Maybe we just need some time
alone with our... our daughter.

823
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:30,542
Wait, wait, wait, not so fast.

824
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:36,208
Mr. Maxwell, we really don't have
any evidence if she doesn't cooperate.

825
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:49,542
Who's Spencer?

826
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:56,292
He's my boyfriend.

827
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,042
No, he isn't

828
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,375
I say we call this Spencer

829
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,417
and see who? he knows--
- You know...

830
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,875
I don't think that's necessary.
- Why not?

831
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:10,583
Because I don't think
we should get Spencer involved.

832
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:12,500
You know this Spencer guy?

833
01:18:16,375 --> 01:18:18,417
He goes to Parkdale High.

834
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,167
He plays the trumpet

835
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:22,375
Hey, Molly.

836
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:24,250
So, is it true?

837
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:28,167
That's so fucking awesome.

838
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:30,625
Totally knew, by the way.

839
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:33,667
Didn't I tell you?
- No.

840
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:40,417
Ben's like, what, 26?
Why can't he get a girl his own age?

841
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:43,250
My parents are, like, 10 years apart.

842
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,292
My mom was, like, 18.

843
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,625
Yeah, but she's 16.

844
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:52,583
I mean, she just got her braces off,
like, what, six months ago?

845
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,125
Think he's done it before?

846
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:34,542
Hey, your favourite movie's on.

847
01:20:39,208 --> 01:20:41,167
That's not my favourite movie.

848
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:43,250
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

849
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:45,042
No, it isn't.

850
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:52,208
Well, you're grounded,
so don't even think about going out.

851
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:56,875
Okay.

852
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:23,792
Did he take this?

853
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:25,583
Yeah.

854
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,458
You look beautiful.

855
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:42,792
Look...

856
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,208
I don't know this guy like you do.

857
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:55,042
But I do know that teachers aren't supposed
to mess around with their students.

858
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:01,292
You're a smart kid.

859
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,125
An amazing young woman,
actually.

860
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:09,583
You're gonna make your own mistakes.

861
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:13,833
You'll live.

862
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:24,875
Call me if you need me.

863
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,542
Or text me, or...

864
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,792
email me, or...

865
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:33,250
or write on my wall.

866
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:41,792
Thank you.

867
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,125
Okay.

868
01:23:21,542 --> 01:23:23,167
You're here.

869
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:24,917
Here I am.

870
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:30,042
Your parents didn't barricade you
in your room?

871
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:34,333
My dad's actually probably
taking this opportunity to fit the locks.

872
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:38,708
How have you been?

873
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:40,792
You know...

874
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,208
Relieved not to be in jail.

875
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:48,792
Thanks for that, by the way.
- Welcome.

876
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:52,542
I think you're gonna like
this first song.

877
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,333
It's called Hand Grenade.

878
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:03,458
Ben, I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry.

879
01:24:04,792 --> 01:24:06,208
Sorry for what?

880
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,458
For developing the rolls.

881
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,458
And everything.

882
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:20,083
Ain't no thing.

883
01:24:27,667 --> 01:24:30,042
Maybe we could get
something to eat after.

884
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,625
I don't think so.

885
01:24:34,792 --> 01:24:35,792
Yeah.

886
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:38,292
Probably not.

887
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,875
I have to go now.

888
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:53,583
Hi.

889
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:58,042
This is my first ever solo show.

890
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,417
And this is gonna be the first song
that I have ever written,

891
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:05,625
so I hope it's not too painful.

892
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:05,167
ID?
- Pardon me?

893
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:08,208
Do you have any ID?
- Oh, I'm not drinking.

894
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:11,958
Seriously?
- Sorry.
