1
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:31,548
This is your spot, Roy.
Pay attention to it.

2
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:32,882
Pitch it in.

3
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,406
You got a gift, Roy.
But it's not enough.

4
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,908
You gotta develop yourself.

5
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:02,871
Rely too much on your own gift
and you'll fail.

6
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:07,292
Iris!

7
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,504
Iris!

8
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:12,755
Gotta go.

9
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:38,818
Can I see you?

10
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:39,903
Right now?

11
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:46,868
What is it?

12
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,745
Wait a minute!

13
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,998
The Cubs sent for me. It's just
a tryout. I haven't made it.

14
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:54,709
- You'll make it.
- There's so many guys.

15
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,546
Not with your arm.
Wouldn't your daddy be proud?

16
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:01,841
- I gotta reach for the best in me.
- Promise me you will?

17
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,010
I promise. Come on!

18
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:16,648
- So when do you have to go?
- Tomorrow.

19
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,525
Oh, God.

20
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:21,027
I've never been on a train before.

21
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,240
It makes you feel important.

22
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,371
There's nothing to be
afraid of, Iris.

23
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:36,209
I love you so much.

24
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,379
I want you to marry me.

25
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:41,840
I do.

26
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:45,969
I want to send for you.

27
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,070
It's all right.

28
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:41,733
Thanks, Whammer.
My kid will treasure this.

29
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,194
Are you sure it ain't
for yourself now?

30
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:47,489
You see this?

31
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:48,740
What's that?

32
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:52,368
An Olympic athlete was shot
just one day after the slaying...

33
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,996
...of a football star,
Johnny Zirowski.

34
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:57,707
In each case,
a silver bullet was used.

35
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,710
A silver bullet?
That's crazy.

36
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,587
Max Mercy, the sportswriter?

37
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,173
I don't believe I know you.

38
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,675
Sam Simpson.
"Bud" Simpson, remember?

39
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,844
I may have heard of you somewhere.

40
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:12,388
Of course, you know
who this fella is.

41
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:14,724
Whammer.

42
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,434
You look different in street clothes.

43
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:20,146
It's always nice to meet
a member of the general public.

44
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,273
You boys heading to Chicago too?

45
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:23,441
That's right.

46
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,111
I've been invited
to see the Cubs myself.

47
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,195
Is that so?

48
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:30,824
I bringing my slam-bang
pitching prospect for a look-see.

49
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:32,367
What's his name?

50
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:33,785
Roy Hobbs.

51
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,411
Where'd he play?

52
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,288
Like I said, Max, he's young.

53
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:40,333
He mowed them down
in that Sabotac Valley game.

54
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,836
You might've heard
of his 8 no-hitters.

55
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,130
There he is. I'll bring him over.

56
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:47,090
You do that.

57
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,517
This is Roy Hobbs.

58
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,811
Max Mercy, syndicated sportswriter.

59
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,646
I'm pleased to meet you.

60
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:03,440
And this here's the Whammer.

61
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,607
How do you do?

62
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,776
You look different in street clothes.

63
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:08,570
First Pete and now "Repeat."

64
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,280
Let's play some cards.

65
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:12,323
Keep up those no-hitters...

66
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,868
...or they'll look for you
at Soda Pop Valley.

67
00:09:15,243 --> 00:09:16,411
Sabotac.

68
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:20,331
Whatever. Hang on to
the water wagon, old-timer.

69
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,585
- Hey, mister...
- Forget about it.

70
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:25,879
What'll it be?

71
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,798
Hearts.

72
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,675
Next stop, lola.

73
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:34,262
Half-hour water stop in lola.

74
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:38,433
Half-hour water stop!

75
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:47,484
Mind the time now.
Half-hour only.

76
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:00,747
Another home run!

77
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:03,374
Hey, Whammer, that's the way
to hit them!

78
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,960
Come on, Whammer! Hit another one!

79
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:09,881
Is he the best?

80
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,093
Best there ever was. Best there is
now and best there ever will be.

81
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,264
All right, that's it, folks!

82
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:21,851
Come on, Whammer!
You got a good audience out here!

83
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:24,354
You wanna see some more?

84
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:27,273
You'll have to come to Chicago,
buy a ticket!

85
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:33,863
You keep that bat, compliments of me.
Nice job! Keep it up!

86
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,657
There he goes, folks!

87
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:38,451
Whammer! The best baseball player
in the country!

88
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:48,878
You don't have
enough prizes for him.

89
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,339
He's a natural.
Give me that green doll.

90
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:01,808
Hey, busher!

91
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,936
Pitch one in here.
I'll knock it to the moon.

92
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:06,813
All right, folks.

93
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:20,160
You sure can pick them, Simpson.

94
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:25,290
I got $10 here says he strikes
Wambold out on 3 pitch balls.

95
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,792
You old boozer,
your brain's full of mush.

96
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,462
This shit-kicker couldn't
strike me out with 100 pitches.

97
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,214
Three is all he'll need, Whammer.

98
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:34,883
I love contests of skill.

99
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:37,135
Do you, honey? So do I.

100
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:40,430
What about you there,
Huckleberry? Scared?

101
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,599
Not of you, I'm not.

102
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:46,728
Why don't we go on the other side
of the tracks, so nobody gets hurt.

103
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,273
Come on, folks!

104
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,152
56, 57, 58...

105
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,488
...59, 60 feet...

106
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,364
...6 inches, exactly.

107
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:02,577
Now here are the rules.

108
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:05,455
There's gonna be three pitches.

109
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:10,418
Any ball over the plate, or if Whammer
swings and misses is a strike, okay?

110
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,629
Anything outside the strike zone...

111
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,923
...that means the contest is over...

112
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:16,800
...and the Whammer wins.

113
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,468
I'll call them.

114
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,720
Why don't you take
some warm-up pitches?

115
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,847
- My arm's loose.
- It's your funeral.

116
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:25,600
Shall we proceed?
The sun's gonna set.

117
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:32,023
I wish you hadn't bet that money.
You come by it hard.

118
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:35,026
I wouldn't have made that bet
if I didn't believe in you.

119
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,694
So come on. There.

120
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,531
We're gonna show
what Roy Hobbs is all about.

121
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:41,783
- Batter up.
- Keep your shirt on.

122
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,581
Batter up! Let's go! Play ball!

123
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,459
Help you down there, old man?

124
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:54,754
Throw it here, plowboy!
It don't get lighter.

125
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:57,340
Chuck it down his whammy.
Chuck it down here.

126
00:12:58,133 --> 00:12:59,717
Give him a shave with it!

127
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,601
- Strike 1!
- Wait a minute.

128
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:10,937
You okay, Sam?

129
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:12,564
It's all right.

130
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:14,149
This damn glove.

131
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:25,326
How will you call them
from back there?

132
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:26,453
He looks wild.

133
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:28,079
Them your knees shaking?

134
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:30,623
Mind your business, red-nose,
and play ball!

135
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,544
Throw it in here, greenhorn.

136
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:37,297
Do it again, Roy.
Come on, boy, do it again.

137
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:46,181
- Strike 2!
- He's throwing spitballs!

138
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:50,810
In a pig's poop. That ball's
as dry as your granddaddy's scalp.

139
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,148
You better not be trying any
funny business out there, rum-pot!

140
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,234
Watch your mouth, mister!

141
00:13:58,443 --> 00:13:59,486
Forget it.

142
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:04,407
This one's it, Whammer.
This is it. Don't let me down.

143
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:05,992
Don't let up.

144
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,412
One more, boy.

145
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:20,757
Come on, Roy. Right by him, baby.
March him out.

146
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,137
Strike 3.

147
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:09,681
You're out.

148
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:44,382
Mister, you forgot this!

149
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:50,764
Wait, mister!

150
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,348
What's your name?

151
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,434
Roy Hobbs!

152
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:55,685
Here!

153
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:57,645
Thanks!

154
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,330
I'm Harriet Bird.

155
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:21,920
It'll be in 110 papers.

156
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,464
I wanna do a little
background on your boy.

157
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,758
Not now. Maybe in the morning.

158
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,718
- Why?
- I'm not feeling well.

159
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:31,387
Listen, bring that sawbuck
you owe me.

160
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:33,932
We'll have breakfast on me, okay?

161
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:37,352
And I can do wonders
for that boy, if you let me.

162
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,189
Rummy.

163
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:43,566
Everyone thought
he would murder you.

164
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:50,657
And the way everyone
rallied around you!

165
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:53,785
They'll be talking about today
for years to come.

166
00:16:55,245 --> 00:17:00,125
It was just like watching
Sir Lancelot jousting Sir Turquine.

167
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,002
Or was it Maldamor?
I'm not sure.

168
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,882
Have you ever read Homer?

169
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:09,968
Homer?

170
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,559
Well, only homer I know
has four bases in it.

171
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:22,647
Homer lived ages ago
and wrote about heroes and gods.

172
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:27,277
And he would've written about baseball
had he seen you out there today.

173
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,446
You know what? Someday...

174
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:32,365
...l'll break every record
in the book.

175
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:34,492
I know I got it in me.

176
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:38,204
What will you hope to accomplish?

177
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,625
When I walk down the street, people
will say, "There goes Roy Hobbs.

178
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,252
The best there ever was."

179
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:48,339
Is that all?

180
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,343
Well, what else is there?

181
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:56,890
Don't you know?

182
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:00,351
Isn't there something more?

183
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:03,062
More glorious?

184
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:07,233
Do you have a girl?

185
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:22,665
I'm gonna say good night now.

186
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:28,213
Would you come
watch me play sometime?

187
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:31,966
Roy, you are priceless.

188
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:33,009
Will you?

189
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:35,011
Of course.

190
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:51,569
I could throw a ball here
and never hit the end.

191
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,446
That's for sure, kid.

192
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:57,283
- Is that licorice?
- Never mind. Let's go to the hotel.

193
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:02,288
- How far is it to the stadium?
- We're going to the hotel first.

194
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,458
We gotta get over to the hotel.
I wanna get a drink.

195
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,769
<i>- This is Harriet.
- Excuse me?</i>

196
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:27,147
<i>Harriet Bird, silly.</i>

197
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,455
The door's open.

198
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,638
How'd you know I was staying here?

199
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:07,645
What's going on here?

200
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:12,484
Will you be the best
there ever was in the game?

201
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:14,569
That's right.

202
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,774
All right, kid. Throw strikes now.
Put something on it, now!

203
00:20:55,777 --> 00:21:00,031
He's walking the whole ballpark,
and he's the best pitcher we got.

204
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,950
I should've been a farmer.

205
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:05,912
Since the day I was born,
I should have been a farmer.

206
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:09,791
I love chickens
and pigs and ducks.

207
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,378
I'm kind of fond
of nanny goats, I am.

208
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:17,048
Come on, Fowler!
Throw strikes!

209
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:19,426
Fowler's killing worms, Pop.

210
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:22,637
Hey, Fowler!
Don't you know how I hate...

211
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,514
...losing to the Pirates?

212
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:27,434
My ma urged me
to get out of this game.

213
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:30,353
When I was a kid,
she pleaded with me.

214
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:33,815
And I meant to, you know what I mean?
But she died.

215
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:35,900
Tough.

216
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:37,527
Now look at me.

217
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:42,490
I'm wet nurse to a last place,
dead-to-the-neck-up ball club...

218
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:44,993
...and I'm choking to death!

219
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:56,880
Wouldn't you think
I could get a fresh drink...

220
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,090
...after all the years I spent
in this game?

221
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,470
Red, did you talk to my bastard
partner about the drinking fountain?

222
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:05,722
The Judge said he's working on it.

223
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,183
Working on it?

224
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,019
Son of a bitch!

225
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:15,023
The day that snake walked
into this ballpark...

226
00:22:15,273 --> 00:22:18,234
...one of the darkest
days of my life, Red.

227
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:50,100
What do we got here?
The Salvation Army Band?

228
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:53,144
- Pop Fisher?
- Who wants to know?

229
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:55,814
I'm Roy Hobbs,
your new right fielder.

230
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:56,898
My what?

231
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:58,358
It's right here.

232
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,907
- Scotty Carson sent you here?
- That's right.

233
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:08,827
He must be nuts.

234
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,912
Where do they find these guys?

235
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:16,876
Fella, you don't start playing ball
at your age, you retire.

236
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,628
Where'd he find you?

237
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,380
The Heeber Oilers.

238
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,257
I've never heard of them.

239
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:23,716
They're semi-pro.

240
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:26,636
Semi-pro.

241
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:28,596
Schultz, go warm up.

242
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:33,726
You ever play organized ball
in your life?

243
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:35,979
I just got back in the game.

244
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,106
What's that mean?

245
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:40,900
I used to play in high school.

246
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:43,736
Excuse me?

247
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:46,281
I used to play in high school.

248
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:48,992
Red, he used to play in high school.

249
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,785
That's nice.

250
00:23:51,286 --> 00:23:53,246
Scotty Carson signs him up...

251
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:55,999
...the Judge okays it,
they ain't talked to me yet.

252
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,543
I got that in my deal
for as long as I live.

253
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:00,003
They gotta talk to me!

254
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:02,630
- I got a contract.
- I wanna see it.

255
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:07,761
Come on, Hinkle!

256
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:12,390
$500 they give this guy
to play with us.

257
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:13,767
This ain't legal.

258
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:18,062
Is Carson your chief scout? He said
he had the authority to sign me.

259
00:24:18,313 --> 00:24:19,856
Yeah, well, he don't have.

260
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,776
Let me talk to you just a minute.

261
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:27,405
He has, Pop.

262
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:31,117
You said so yourself,
if he ever found anybody decent.

263
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:33,536
I know, but look at this guy.

264
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:36,790
We don't need no middle-aged rookies.

265
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:39,417
Well, we sure need somebody.

266
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:45,006
Hey, fella.

267
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:47,425
All right, you come at a bad time.

268
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:49,010
Like Red says...

269
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:52,013
...Scotty Carson seen
something in you.

270
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:54,974
Go find Doctor Dizzy and suit up.

271
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:03,316
Red, I should've been a farmer.

272
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:08,321
Number 11. That's a bad luck number.
I won't go into that.

273
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,656
What about 9?

274
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:11,783
9? Well, you got me.

275
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,495
9 it is. What's in the case?

276
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:17,038
My bat.

277
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:18,248
A bat?

278
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:20,959
Follow me. Second locker down.

279
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:27,841
Slip this on. See if you got
enough room under the arms.

280
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:34,556
If it was close,
why didn't you slide?

281
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:38,226
I had a cigar in my back pocket.
I didn't wanna break it.

282
00:25:40,186 --> 00:25:42,021
Hear you and Memo
are getting hitched.

283
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:45,316
I don't know where you heard that.
She says that to everybody.

284
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:46,943
It's not true.

285
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:49,237
What's this, another victim?

286
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,573
Bump Bailey.

287
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,619
- What are you, a new coach?
- New player. Roy Hobbs.

288
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:57,954
No kidding?

289
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:02,417
I didn't catch your name.

290
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:05,753
Roy Hobbs.

291
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:07,380
Max Mercy.

292
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:11,468
Fowler, I wanna ask you something.

293
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:20,143
There'll be a room for you
at the Ellicott Hotel.

294
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:23,104
Why don't you meet me
in the lobby about 6:30.

295
00:26:23,354 --> 00:26:25,523
We'll get something to eat,
have a talk.

296
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:26,816
Fine.

297
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,783
Another brilliant find
from our scouting system. Geniuses.

298
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:36,534
Try this on for size.

299
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:43,291
Welcome to the majors.

300
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:22,163
We're not moving.

301
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,345
- Hey, Pop.
- Hi, honey.

302
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:40,598
You together?

303
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,601
No, I'm meeting Bump.

304
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:49,399
My niece, Memo Paris. Roy Hobbs.

305
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,151
He's a new player.

306
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:52,735
How do you do?

307
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,237
Hello.

308
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:57,657
What position?

309
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:59,117
He just started today.

310
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:00,243
Right field.

311
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:04,914
Right? That's Bump's position,
isn't it, Pop?

312
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:08,585
Mr. Hobbs is brand new, and we're
not sure what we'll do with him.

313
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:11,087
Come on, I'll walk you to a cab.

314
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:14,966
Bye.

315
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:24,851
Anything wrong?

316
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,646
No, I'm just not used to hotels.

317
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:30,023
Let's go.

318
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:47,791
How long were you with the Oilers?

319
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:48,958
Two weeks.

320
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,586
Two weeks?

321
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:55,632
And before that?

322
00:28:57,383 --> 00:28:59,803
Just knocked around from here to there.

323
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:03,306
You don't mind me asking
these questions, do you?

324
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:07,477
I read Scotty's report on you.

325
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,687
Said you're one hell of a hitter.

326
00:29:10,897 --> 00:29:13,858
How come you didn't start playing
when you was younger?

327
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:18,154
I did play when I was younger.

328
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:20,990
We're already eating.
We got our food.

329
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:22,784
We've already ordered.

330
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,912
But you gave it up?

331
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:27,872
Sort of.

332
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:30,166
But my mind was always on the game.

333
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,043
So I figured...

334
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:35,004
...to give it another try.

335
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,216
Just like that?

336
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:40,844
Just like that.

337
00:29:41,136 --> 00:29:42,512
Where you from?

338
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:45,640
Does it matter?

339
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:50,270
Do you always talk this way
about yourself?

340
00:29:57,986 --> 00:30:00,029
Let me tell you something about Pop.

341
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,116
He gave his heart and soul
to the game...

342
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:05,660
...only to get it trampled on.

343
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:09,789
I'd give my right arm
to get him the pennant.

344
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,629
It took me 16 years to get here.

345
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,048
You play me...

346
00:30:19,591 --> 00:30:21,259
...and you'll get the best I got.

347
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,470
I believe you.

348
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:27,390
Pretty good food, huh?

349
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,267
It's damn good.

350
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:32,979
You can't spell it,
but it eats pretty good, don't it?

351
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:37,984
All right. A little hustle,
a little hustle!

352
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:41,362
I don't know where
that water comes from, but...

353
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:45,033
Never mind the water.
Just stand up there and hit the ball.

354
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:49,662
You wanna sit this one out?

355
00:30:56,961 --> 00:31:00,590
Can you imagine that Judge
sending me a middle-aged rookie?

356
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:03,343
I'm gonna pay his contract.

357
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:05,095
I ain't gonna play him.

358
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:06,513
Never.

359
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,576
That's kind of a bad play there.

360
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:47,637
- Which are so
inherently symptomatic...

361
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:49,097
...of a losing team.

362
00:31:49,347 --> 00:31:51,433
Sorry, doc, I had a little...
You know.

363
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:55,145
The mind is a strange thing, men.

364
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:57,981
We must begin by asking it...

365
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:00,483
..."What is losing?"

366
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:03,611
Losing is a disease...

367
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,490
...as contagious as polio.

368
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,876
Losing is a disease...

369
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:21,296
...as contagious as syphilis.

370
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:27,844
Losing is a disease...

371
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,805
...as contagious as bubonic plague...

372
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:33,391
<i>... attacking one...</i>

373
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,477
<i>... but infecting all.</i>

374
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,277
But curable.

375
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,864
Now, I want you to imagine...

376
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:51,284
...you are on a ship at sea...

377
00:32:52,368 --> 00:32:53,661
...on a vast...

378
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:58,458
You wanna sit down and pay attention?

379
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:00,627
- Gently rocking.

380
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:02,253
Get back in here!

381
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,090
Gently rocking.

382
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:09,469
<i>Gently rocking.</i>

383
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:12,764
<i>Gently rocking.</i>

384
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:29,197
I'm sending you down, Hobbs.

385
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:30,990
Class B ball.

386
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:34,452
Tomorrow morning, you go
to the Great Lakes Association.

387
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:37,455
- You make the rules.
- That's right.

388
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:40,041
And you ain't been playing by them.

389
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,544
All these other guys play by them.

390
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:45,797
- You remember signing a contract?
- I remember signing it...

391
00:33:46,005 --> 00:33:50,051
...to play ball. Not to be put to sleep
by some hypnotist. I won't do that.

392
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,261
You're going down.

393
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:53,888
Took me a long time to get here.
I won't do it!

394
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:55,890
I can't.

395
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,436
I came here to play ball.

396
00:34:03,815 --> 00:34:05,316
Come back here!

397
00:34:15,034 --> 00:34:16,995
Batting practice tomorrow.

398
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:18,913
Be there!

399
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:20,957
I have been...

400
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:22,542
...every day.

401
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:44,898
You all squared away?

402
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:46,232
- Yeah.
- All right.

403
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:49,235
Get in the cage.
Let's see what you can do.

404
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:51,196
Get out of there, Bump.

405
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:02,248
Show us what you can do.

406
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:33,071
Try this one, grandpa.

407
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:12,819
Come here!

408
00:36:13,027 --> 00:36:14,612
Let me see that bat.

409
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:21,494
Not bad, kid.

410
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:25,540
Where'd you get this?

411
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:28,293
I made it myself
from a tree near home.

412
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,755
"Wonderboy."
You put that on there?

413
00:36:33,506 --> 00:36:34,591
What does it mean?

414
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:37,510
I made it a long time ago,
when I was kid.

415
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:40,388
I wanted it to be a very special bat.

416
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:43,224
How about this lightning bolt?

417
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,519
The tree I made it from
was split open by lightning.

418
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:48,354
I don't figure this.

419
00:36:49,522 --> 00:36:52,442
All those years, and you never played
organized baseball?

420
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:56,905
Well, I sort of got sidetracked.

421
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,410
Measure that and weigh it.

422
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:06,873
If it comes up to specifications,
we'll let you use it.

423
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:10,293
Now, go on out there
and shag some flies.

424
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:14,214
Better late than never, Pop.

425
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:17,092
Red, this is practice.

426
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:19,886
We'll see.

427
00:37:21,513 --> 00:37:24,724
<i>Knights lead Philadelphia, 3-2.
A golden opportunity to break...</i>

428
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:27,477
<i>... a long losing streak.
Fowler winds, throws.</i>

429
00:37:27,685 --> 00:37:29,687
<i>Long fly ball.
Bivens moving under.</i>

430
00:37:29,938 --> 00:37:32,148
<i>Here comes Bailey!
Bailey knocks the ball...</i>

431
00:37:32,357 --> 00:37:34,317
<i>... and the ball rolls to the wall!</i>

432
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:37,987
<i>One run moving across the plate.
That'll make it 3 to 3.</i>

433
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:39,572
<i>He comes around 3rd base.</i>

434
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:41,366
<i>Bivens throws the ball to 2nd.</i>

435
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:45,703
<i>Now it's 4-3, the Phillies. A golden
opportunity and it's down the drain...</i>

436
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:49,165
<i>... as Bailey boggles the situation
and knocks the ball...</i>

437
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:51,209
...loose from Bivens' glove.

438
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:54,337
The Knights can do nothing right,
no matter what they try.

439
00:37:54,546 --> 00:37:57,632
You ain't nailed to the ground.
Move. A little hustle!

440
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,759
Let's go, let's go!

441
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:02,804
Bumper, I wanna see you
in my office after the game.

442
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:05,140
I lost it in the sun.

443
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:08,768
Blinding.

444
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:15,191
1 st! 1 st base!

445
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:17,068
Safe!

446
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:20,530
All right, all right!

447
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,616
Stay put, Bumper.
You're gonna sit this one out.

448
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:26,828
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm taking you out.

449
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:28,746
Do you want an apology from me?

450
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:30,665
Forget it. I won't apologize.

451
00:38:30,915 --> 00:38:32,542
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

452
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:36,171
I'm the manager, you're the player.
You sit down and shut your mouth!

453
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:38,923
- What do you want?
- I want you to sit down!

454
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:42,343
Gabby, Boone, help him find
his seat! Hobbs, you're up.

455
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:43,970
What's the matter with you?

456
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:46,556
Sit down and shut up,
you mouthy prima donna.

457
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:48,224
You want apologies from me?

458
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,267
Sit down!

459
00:38:49,476 --> 00:38:50,935
Trade me and get it over with!

460
00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:52,937
Let me have a hitter up here.

461
00:38:53,188 --> 00:38:54,939
Come on, Hobbs! You're up!

462
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:14,667
Knock the cover off the ball.

463
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:16,795
<i>Now batting for Bump Bailey...</i>

464
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:19,589
<i>... number 9, Roy Hobbs.</i>

465
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:24,052
<i>Here's a surprise. Fisher will
replace Bump Bailey with number 9.</i>

466
00:39:24,302 --> 00:39:25,804
<i>Number 9 is Roy Hobbs.</i>

467
00:39:26,054 --> 00:39:30,350
<i>Hobbs was bought up in midseason.
I don't know too much about him.</i>

468
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,103
<i>Apparently Fisher's very upset
with Bailey.</i>

469
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:36,022
<i>Of course, Bailey messed up
that play with Bivens.</i>

470
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:38,858
<i>Two runs came in,
that made the Phillies 4 to 3...</i>

471
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:40,735
<i>... when the Knights led 3-2...</i>

472
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:43,488
<i>... trying to get out
of this losing streak.</i>

473
00:39:43,738 --> 00:39:46,950
<i>MacBride's gonna look in again
at Hobbs right now.</i>

474
00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:50,745
<i>He'll check Bivens at 1 st.
Baker leading off of 2nd right now.</i>

475
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:52,914
<i>- Here comes the pitch.
- Strike 1!</i>

476
00:39:53,414 --> 00:39:55,625
<i>Fastball, inside corner, strike 1.</i>

477
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:59,003
<i>Hobbs didn't like the call.
Well, welcome to the majors.</i>

478
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:03,133
<i>MacBride gave him a good, strong
fastball on the inside corner.</i>

479
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:58,271
Let me see the ball.

480
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:04,903
- Not that junk, the ball!
- That junk is the ball.

481
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:07,697
- That's a ball?
- Jesus, he shot it to pieces!

482
00:41:07,947 --> 00:41:09,866
We want a real ball!

483
00:41:27,342 --> 00:41:29,344
Was that real, the cover coming off?

484
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:32,388
- You were there, you saw it.
- Yeah, I know.

485
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,643
- Explain that cover coming off.
- I hit it as hard as I could.

486
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:38,895
Is it true he just walked in one day?

487
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:40,605
Can we see the bat Hobbs used?

488
00:41:40,855 --> 00:41:43,358
That's the way to grease them.
Ain't no mystery.

489
00:41:43,608 --> 00:41:45,527
Give us a break!
Where'd you find him?

490
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:48,321
Scouts found him.
They always look for young players.

491
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:52,617
- He doesn't look young. Is he 35, 36?
- That's young to me.

492
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:55,286
Where in the hell did you find him?

493
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:59,707
As my chief scout, Mr. Carson,
I'm relying on your honour.

494
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:04,003
<i>Judge, I'm doing what you asked.
Hobbs is a joke, nobody from nowhere.</i>

495
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:06,965
Yes, that's just what
concerns me, Mr. Carson.

496
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:10,844
It's about time we found out
just who he is and where he's from.

497
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:12,595
Good day.

498
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,111
Nice bat.

499
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:29,529
You like it?

500
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:34,868
Do you think I'll be able to make
one of those bats?

501
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:39,247
Tell you what.

502
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,458
Go down to the lumberyard...

503
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:44,294
...pick yourself out
a really good piece of wood...

504
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,256
...and we'll work on it together.
- All right. Thanks.

505
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,134
- See you.
- See you.

506
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:12,530
I'm Max Mercy. I met you
in the locker room with Bump.

507
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:15,575
Interesting way you mistreat
a baseball.

508
00:43:17,535 --> 00:43:18,703
Can I buy you a beer?

509
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:21,414
- No, I'm in a hurry.
- I wanna ask you something.

510
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:24,876
- Do I look familiar to you?
- You? No.

511
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:27,337
Because you sure look familiar to me.

512
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:30,006
- Where you from, Hobbs?
- Nowhere special.

513
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:33,176
Wait. You ever play
in a Cardinal organization?

514
00:43:36,805 --> 00:43:41,142
Well, it'll come to me in a minute.
I got a terrific memory.

515
00:43:42,268 --> 00:43:43,812
See you around, Hobbs.

516
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:57,325
Hi, Al.

517
00:43:57,659 --> 00:43:59,327
Hi, Iris. How was your weekend?

518
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:00,370
Swell.

519
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,830
What can I get you?

520
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,706
One of those, cup of coffee.

521
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:04,999
Help yourself.

522
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,003
- AI, did you read Mercy's article?
- Why should I read it? I heard it.

523
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:11,965
Must've been the rain.
Stitches probably got loose.

524
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:14,759
It didn't start to rain
till after he hit the ball.

525
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:19,139
- The ball was defective.
- Defective. He made a meal out of it.

526
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:22,225
- What's the name of his bat?
- Wonderboy!

527
00:44:22,475 --> 00:44:23,601
"Wonderboy."

528
00:44:25,353 --> 00:44:28,982
You guys. You know, people are
always running down amazing things.

529
00:44:29,232 --> 00:44:32,986
This guy Hobbs, you ain't seen
nothing yet. I got a feeling.

530
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:36,823
Wonderboy. You gotta be kidding!

531
00:44:37,282 --> 00:44:38,408
See you later, Al.

532
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:40,452
Okay, Ralph.

533
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:56,342
<i>Our cameras turn
to the world of sports.</i>

534
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:58,970
<i>In response to
Max Mercy's accusation...</i>

535
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,141
<i>... that Wonderboy was a loaded bat,
Commissioner Gates made a statement.</i>

536
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:05,143
<i>We measured and weighed the bat...</i>

537
00:45:05,393 --> 00:45:07,812
<i>... and it is within
League specifications.</i>

538
00:45:08,062 --> 00:45:11,858
<i>Therefore, the bat is legal
and may be used in League play.</i>

539
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:13,568
<i>Hold up the bat!</i>

540
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:17,655
<i>"Wonderboy"!
And oh, what a bat it is!</i>

541
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:24,370
My gut tells me this,
and Red agrees.

542
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:28,500
We feel Hobbs can fill
your position very neatly.

543
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,669
We'll give you one more chance
to shape up.

544
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:33,922
Otherwise, it's the bench.

545
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:39,552
<i>Top of the 7 th right now.
Knights leading Boston, 6-3.</i>

546
00:45:39,761 --> 00:45:43,932
<i>Bump Bailey's 2 for 2 and made a
great catch off the right-field wall.</i>

547
00:45:44,182 --> 00:45:45,767
<i>Bailey at the top of his game.</i>

548
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:48,603
Looks like your talk to Bump
is paying off.

549
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,980
I gotta believe you're right.

550
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:52,982
<i>Fowler has very good control.</i>

551
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:57,195
<i>Abel takes a slight leadoff to 2nd,
Fowler tries to move him back.</i>

552
00:45:57,403 --> 00:45:59,948
<i>Fair ball, swung on.
Long fly ball out there!</i>

553
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:02,951
<i>Bailey going way back!
This ball is hit real deep.</i>

554
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:03,993
<i>Bailey looks up!</i>

555
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,247
<i>He hits off the wall!
The ball rolls free.</i>

556
00:46:07,455 --> 00:46:09,958
<i>Bailey went through the wall, folks.</i>

557
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,127
<i>There's no movement at all.</i>

558
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:13,795
He's certainly down.

559
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:15,922
<i>Bailey looks like
he's seriously hurt.</i>

560
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:33,231
<i>In a stirring ceremony at Knights
Field, star Bump Bailey's ashes...</i>

561
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,568
<i>... were dropped from a plane
as fans and ballplayers stood...</i>

562
00:46:36,985 --> 00:46:39,112
<i>... and paid their last respects.</i>

563
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:41,114
<i>Bump Bailey died after crashing...</i>

564
00:46:41,322 --> 00:46:45,285
<i>... headfirst into the right-field wall
in pursuit of a fly ball.</i>

565
00:46:45,493 --> 00:46:48,288
<i>A great catch that almost was.</i>

566
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,749
<i>Rest in peace, Bump Bailey.</i>

567
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,500
<i>Baseball will miss you.</i>

568
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:57,338
Play ball!

569
00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:01,134
<i>Over 27, 000 fans are here,
paying their respects to Bump Bailey.</i>

570
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:03,261
<i>Hobbs stepping up to bat right now.</i>

571
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:08,016
<i>As you remember, just the other day,
Hobbs knocked the cover off the ball.</i>

572
00:47:08,391 --> 00:47:11,895
<i>He had an auspicious beginning.
Hobbs hitting from the left side.</i>

573
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:14,397
<i>Looking in right now,
Hobbs in his stance.</i>

574
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:17,859
<i>Here's the pitch.
He swings. Long fly ball!</i>

575
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:19,569
<i>Way, way, way back!</i>

576
00:47:21,196 --> 00:47:25,116
<i>Way up into the rafters there!
An unbelievable hit from Roy Hobbs!</i>

577
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:26,159
<i>Incredible power!</i>

578
00:47:28,453 --> 00:47:30,288
<i>As good a hit as I've seen all year.</i>

579
00:47:30,497 --> 00:47:33,958
<i>Hobbs rounds the bases.
Roy Hobbs, 2 for 2.</i>

580
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:37,837
<i>Maybe we can expect
good things from Roy Hobbs.</i>

581
00:47:44,677 --> 00:47:46,805
You've never seen Hobbs before?

582
00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:50,350
No, I already told you that.
What have you got on your mind?

583
00:47:52,685 --> 00:47:53,937
Strange.

584
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,943
You really threw
that lumber around today.

585
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:02,320
We broke a few windows, didn't we?

586
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:07,158
Real good. You know, there's not
a mark on it. Not a nick.

587
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:09,410
I boned it so it wouldn't chip.

588
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,122
You know what I like?

589
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:14,541
I like this lightning bolt.

590
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:18,837
When I was a kid, my father gave me
his collection of squadron insignias.

591
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:21,214
The kind flying aces used to wear.

592
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:22,966
It reminds me of that.

593
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:25,635
- Nice going.
- Nice game, guys.

594
00:48:26,428 --> 00:48:27,971
Wanna get something to eat?

595
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:37,730
Hey, Olsen, nice patch.
Try putting it over your eye.

596
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:41,901
All right, I ain't talking,
I'm hitting.

597
00:48:45,488 --> 00:48:47,449
- Impressive.
- It must be the patch.

598
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:49,742
It's like Samson with his hair.

599
00:48:53,204 --> 00:48:54,414
He came alive.

600
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:55,874
Well, he sure did.

601
00:48:56,082 --> 00:48:59,169
There seems to be a mistake.
Olsen's hitting the ball.

602
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:02,046
I want one of those for myself.

603
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,024
<i>- Hobbs' homer, goes into the 11 th!</i>

604
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:47,694
Home runs, triples, singles...

605
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,779
Anything he wants to hit, he hits.

606
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:52,407
I've never seen anything like it.

607
00:50:52,657 --> 00:50:54,117
It's incredible!

608
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:56,578
Anything he wants to do, he does!

609
00:50:56,911 --> 00:51:00,665
I mean, how can somebody play
that well that came from nowhere?

610
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:05,879
<i>New York Knights powerhouse hitter,
Roy Hobbs...</i>

611
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:08,006
<i>... a shining example
to his young fans.</i>

612
00:51:08,256 --> 00:51:11,050
<i>Though embarrassed by praise
and shy of the press...</i>

613
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,970
<i>... Hobbs is always there
for an autograph.</i>

614
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:16,806
<i>Well, I'm sure gonna try real hard.</i>

615
00:51:17,056 --> 00:51:19,225
<i>What's it take to be a big leaguer?</i>

616
00:51:19,642 --> 00:51:21,561
<i>You need a lot
of little boy in you...</i>

617
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:23,730
<i>... so you guys
qualify pretty well.</i>

618
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:27,192
<i>What's your name?</i>

619
00:51:27,734 --> 00:51:30,195
<i>And with a few
words of wisdom that...</i>

620
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:32,280
<i>... who knows, might alter
the destiny...</i>

621
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,074
<i>... of one of these fine young fans.</i>

622
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:39,204
Let me tell you something about Pop.
He thinks he's jinxed.

623
00:51:39,454 --> 00:51:40,371
What do you mean?

624
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,666
Last season he had
some financial problems.

625
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:47,921
He had to sell the Judge
10% of his shares.

626
00:51:49,214 --> 00:51:52,842
That makes the Judge the majority
stockholder of the Knights.

627
00:51:53,426 --> 00:51:56,012
But he got one condition
in the contract.

628
00:51:56,554 --> 00:51:58,765
If he can win
the pennant this season...

629
00:51:58,973 --> 00:52:01,601
...he can buy the shares back,
and the Judge is out.

630
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:04,229
If he loses...

631
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:06,272
...he's out, and he has to sell.

632
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:08,149
And winner take all.

633
00:52:20,995 --> 00:52:22,580
"If I Had You."

634
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:27,502
"Small Hotel."

635
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:35,969
"Dear Old Girl."

636
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:52,902
I'd have bet money you
wouldn't know that song!

637
00:52:57,824 --> 00:52:58,658
Pitch it in!

638
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:01,536
Come on, let me see what you got!

639
00:53:02,495 --> 00:53:04,414
Come on, just one more.

640
00:53:04,622 --> 00:53:05,540
Throw him one.

641
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:08,168
I wanna knock it into the stands!

642
00:53:08,376 --> 00:53:10,253
Come on, Roy, pitch it in!

643
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:14,257
- I bet you 10 bucks he can whiff you.
- You already owe me $10.

644
00:53:14,466 --> 00:53:16,426
- Double or nothing then.
- You're on.

645
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:18,636
Pitch it here!

646
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:21,347
One more, Roy! Right into the stands!

647
00:53:31,232 --> 00:53:33,318
Barrel one down his main street!

648
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,130
He really burnt that in there.

649
00:54:06,935 --> 00:54:08,228
Come in here a minute.

650
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:11,773
What's up?

651
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:13,942
Ask the Judge.

652
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:17,112
The Judge?

653
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,780
He wants to see you.

654
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,409
I should go with you.

655
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:26,746
No, I can handle it.

656
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:32,919
I hope so.

657
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,886
- I'm Roy Hobbs.
- Yes, the Judge is expecting you.

658
00:54:42,137 --> 00:54:43,346
Go right in.

659
00:54:44,222 --> 00:54:45,265
Thank you.

660
00:54:52,313 --> 00:54:54,149
Come in. Come in.

661
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:00,280
We meet at last.

662
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:04,576
This is a swell office.

663
00:55:05,326 --> 00:55:07,412
Mere creature comforts.

664
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:10,331
Could use a little more light, though.

665
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:16,921
Where you from, Hobbs?

666
00:55:18,298 --> 00:55:21,259
All around, really.
What about you?

667
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:27,056
Please pardon the absence of light.

668
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:31,519
You see, as a youngster I was
frightened of the dark...

669
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:35,273
...and I used to wake up sobbing
in it as if it was water...

670
00:55:35,482 --> 00:55:36,983
...and I was drowning in it.

671
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:39,527
As you will observe, I have...

672
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:42,363
...disciplined myself
against that fear...

673
00:55:42,614 --> 00:55:44,115
...that now I much prefer...

674
00:55:44,365 --> 00:55:46,117
...a dark room.

675
00:55:47,494 --> 00:55:50,705
The only thing I know about the dark
is, you can't see in it.

676
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:53,666
A pure canard.

677
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,085
What's a canard?

678
00:55:56,377 --> 00:55:57,545
A prevarication.

679
00:55:57,879 --> 00:55:58,713
What's that mean?

680
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,006
A lie.

681
00:56:01,508 --> 00:56:03,343
You can see, you know.

682
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,513
Well, not good enough.

683
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,265
You see me, don't you?

684
00:56:09,974 --> 00:56:11,392
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

685
00:56:19,818 --> 00:56:23,321
I asked you here because I wanted
to pay you my compliments...

686
00:56:23,571 --> 00:56:26,741
...for your performance in the field.

687
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:30,745
It's been fun.

688
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,665
Oh, you made a great contribution.

689
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:37,419
Stands have been constantly filled.

690
00:56:38,878 --> 00:56:42,924
Financial fortunes have been
radically reversed since you joined.

691
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,759
I hadn't noticed.

692
00:56:45,427 --> 00:56:48,346
You're not fascinated
by the almighty dollar?

693
00:56:50,014 --> 00:56:51,683
I never gave it much thought.

694
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,020
You're above such
mundane thoughts, huh?

695
00:56:56,396 --> 00:56:57,647
I didn't say that.

696
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:00,733
No, I'm as interested in a buck
as anybody else.

697
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:04,779
And I am not one to let
good deeds go unrewarded.

698
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:07,574
Would a new contract interest you?

699
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:11,369
For more money.

700
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,123
You wanna pay me more,
that's up to you.

701
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:20,086
I don't detect any gratitude
on your part, Mr. Hobbs.

702
00:57:21,129 --> 00:57:24,674
I'm under no legal obligation
to pay you one penny more.

703
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:28,511
Either way, I play to win.

704
00:57:28,887 --> 00:57:31,723
A young man your age
ought to think about your future.

705
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,142
Well, let me put it to you this way:

706
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:39,689
There's no way I'm gonna let you
steal this club from Pop.

707
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,734
The fact is, Pop is a jinxed man.

708
00:57:42,984 --> 00:57:45,487
All the Roy Hobbses
in the world can't change that.

709
00:57:45,737 --> 00:57:49,616
- Well, it'll be a team effort.
- You're a very impudent man.

710
00:57:50,116 --> 00:57:51,785
The interview is ended.

711
00:58:00,085 --> 00:58:03,671
You come back here and turn off
that infernal light!

712
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:11,971
He's not as greedy as Bump.

713
00:58:12,806 --> 00:58:15,433
He'll be hard to work with,
but we'll get him.

714
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:28,154
How'd it go up there, kiddo?

715
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:32,534
What are you doing here? Stay home
in bed and quit tailing me around.

716
00:58:32,784 --> 00:58:35,912
You really are a riddle.
What are you trying to hide?

717
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:39,165
- I ain't hiding a thing.
- Well, who says you are?

718
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:40,500
You know...

719
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:44,754
...old Sam Simpson died before
he could give me the lowdown on you.

720
00:58:45,171 --> 00:58:47,632
But I want you to look at this.

721
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:52,595
What you have in your hand is
a great story, but I want it all.

722
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:55,306
A Max Mercy exclusive.

723
00:58:55,557 --> 00:58:57,892
I don't want the public to get
the wrong idea.

724
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,686
Stories are floating around.

725
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,564
One says you played
for another major league team.

726
00:59:03,022 --> 00:59:05,316
One says you were
an acrobat in the circus.

727
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,945
There's even a crazy story
that said you killed someone.

728
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:12,740
Let them believe
what they wanna believe.

729
00:59:13,366 --> 00:59:16,745
My paper will guarantee you
5 grand, cash, for your story.

730
00:59:17,328 --> 00:59:21,124
It'll give your fans something
to keep up their goodwill in you.

731
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:25,545
Once you get to know me better,
you'll like me.

732
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:35,346
Hi, kid. How are you doing?

733
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:36,848
Nice to see you.

734
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,186
We're gonna meet a guy
named Gus Sands, all right?

735
00:59:41,436 --> 00:59:42,270
Who's he?

736
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,356
You're kidding.
He's a $10 million-a-year bookie.

737
00:59:45,607 --> 00:59:47,567
- You never heard of him?
- No.

738
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,903
Awfully nice guy. Awfully nice.

739
00:59:50,904 --> 00:59:53,656
They don't have bands like that
in Nebraska, do they?

740
00:59:53,907 --> 00:59:56,201
That's not where I'm from,
but they aren't there either.

741
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:01,873
Gus?

742
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:05,835
You know...
Here. You know Roy Hobbs.

743
01:00:06,086 --> 01:00:08,338
Yeah, sure.
I know all about Roy Hobbs.

744
01:00:08,546 --> 01:00:10,131
Everybody here know everybody?

745
01:00:10,381 --> 01:00:11,841
Sit down.

746
01:00:13,468 --> 01:00:15,720
- Have a drink, slugger?
- No, thanks.

747
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,889
Strictly a Wheaties man, right?

748
01:00:18,139 --> 01:00:19,682
Well, the eyes.

749
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:22,560
- Gotta keep them clear.
- Oh, yes.

750
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:24,312
How'd it go today?

751
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:27,816
He did better than we did.
He got 5 out of 5 in the 1 st...

752
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,901
...and 3 for 4 in the 2nd.

753
01:00:30,151 --> 01:00:32,487
What do you know?
That'll cost me a pretty penny.

754
01:00:32,946 --> 01:00:33,822
How's that?

755
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,323
I bet against you today.

756
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:37,367
Against the Knights?

757
01:00:37,575 --> 01:00:38,952
Just against you, kid.

758
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:42,747
I didn't know you could bet
against one player.

759
01:00:42,956 --> 01:00:45,208
You can bet against anybody, anything.

760
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:47,877
Strikes, balls, hits, runs, errors.

761
01:00:48,086 --> 01:00:49,254
Take your pick.

762
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:54,259
I once bet $100,000
on three pitched balls.

763
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:55,802
How'd you make out?

764
01:00:56,845 --> 01:00:58,054
Didn't.

765
01:00:59,514 --> 01:01:02,809
But the next week, I ruined the guy
with a different deal.

766
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,438
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you don't.

767
01:01:06,646 --> 01:01:09,274
I lost with you today...

768
01:01:09,482 --> 01:01:12,152
...but some other time,
I'll clean up double.

769
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:13,653
How you gonna do that?

770
01:01:14,779 --> 01:01:16,406
When you're not batting so good.

771
01:01:17,323 --> 01:01:18,950
How will you know
when that is?

772
01:01:19,617 --> 01:01:22,495
The magic eye. It sees all.

773
01:01:23,455 --> 01:01:25,123
Show him how it works. Go on.

774
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,792
Yeah, sure. Why not?

775
01:01:29,002 --> 01:01:33,214
I'll bet that I can tell,
within a buck either way...

776
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:36,050
...how much money
you've got in your pocket.

777
01:01:38,887 --> 01:01:40,138
I'll take that chance.

778
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,973
For a thousand dollars?

779
01:01:43,808 --> 01:01:46,311
Better make it a hundred.
You know the Judge.

780
01:01:46,686 --> 01:01:48,438
A hundred it is.

781
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:03,369
You got 10 bucks.

782
01:02:13,505 --> 01:02:14,339
What is it?

783
01:02:14,672 --> 01:02:15,673
Eight dollars.

784
01:02:16,216 --> 01:02:17,133
You lose.

785
01:02:18,384 --> 01:02:19,719
And the silver?

786
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,557
The silver.

787
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,897
A dollar, what, 37?

788
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:35,151
Never misses. Right, sugar?

789
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,570
Just a lucky guy, Gus.

790
01:02:37,779 --> 01:02:40,031
That's pretty good. I owe you 100.

791
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,158
Forget it. Forget it.

792
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:44,994
Someday you'll maybe
do me a favour, eh?

793
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,248
Don't bet on it.

794
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:53,378
Excuse me.

795
01:03:00,218 --> 01:03:01,052
What?

796
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:06,015
I think you overlooked these.

797
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:09,352
We call it even?

798
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:14,607
Would you like to dance?

799
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:21,156
What do you know about him?

800
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:23,950
Not much. Not very much.

801
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:29,247
But I got a questionnaire out in
a thousand papers all over the west.

802
01:03:29,497 --> 01:03:31,166
Somebody's gotta claim him, right?

803
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:32,417
Right.

804
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:36,463
- Are you interested?
- Yeah, I could be, Max. Could be.

805
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:39,591
I can't pay enough
for good information these days.

806
01:03:40,842 --> 01:03:42,343
Thank you.

807
01:03:43,094 --> 01:03:45,722
It's nice to know my hair
is full of silver.

808
01:03:47,432 --> 01:03:49,392
Can you read my mind too?

809
01:03:49,642 --> 01:03:51,603
No. I'm not good at that.

810
01:03:52,479 --> 01:03:54,564
You don't mind if I just look?

811
01:03:56,107 --> 01:03:58,276
Isn't that what you've been doing?

812
01:03:58,526 --> 01:03:59,819
So far.

813
01:04:02,113 --> 01:04:03,698
So far it's fun.

814
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,327
Does it get better in private?

815
01:04:11,206 --> 01:04:12,624
I have a car.

816
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,168
What about Gus?

817
01:04:17,378 --> 01:04:19,339
I'll tell him you made me disappear.

818
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:34,395
My father walked out on us
when I was a little girl.

819
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:39,776
I don't remember being happy
until I was about 18 or 19.

820
01:04:40,026 --> 01:04:41,402
Then what happened?

821
01:04:42,195 --> 01:04:44,114
Then I won a beauty contest.

822
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:46,324
How could you lose?

823
01:04:47,659 --> 01:04:51,079
You know, it's strange,
but ever since the hotel, I feel...

824
01:04:53,248 --> 01:04:55,208
...like we've met before.

825
01:04:56,418 --> 01:04:57,585
I doubt it.

826
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,758
- So what about you?
- What about me?

827
01:05:04,175 --> 01:05:06,219
Now it's your turn to tell.

828
01:05:07,262 --> 01:05:08,972
Me? What's there to tell?

829
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,600
Come on, I don't have any secrets.

830
01:05:12,851 --> 01:05:15,145
Maybe. But I do.

831
01:05:16,104 --> 01:05:17,605
What about magic?

832
01:05:18,106 --> 01:05:20,024
Where did you learn magic?

833
01:05:20,275 --> 01:05:23,695
I just picked it up around, through
the years, like a lot of things.

834
01:05:25,363 --> 01:05:26,573
Like what?

835
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,366
Baseball.

836
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:32,120
"Baseball." Max was right.

837
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:36,332
You're just a mystery.
I mean, I don't know...

838
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:38,710
He's just after a story.

839
01:05:39,252 --> 01:05:41,421
What about Gus?
He's quite a character.

840
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,425
Bump introduced us.

841
01:05:48,136 --> 01:05:50,263
He picked me up when I was down.

842
01:05:52,056 --> 01:05:53,349
He's a friend.

843
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:59,564
I'm not waiting for true love
to come along, Roy.

844
01:06:00,815 --> 01:06:02,317
I never have.

845
01:06:04,486 --> 01:06:06,321
I've known a million guys.

846
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:08,698
Bump was swell.

847
01:06:08,948 --> 01:06:11,201
He was real swell, but typical.

848
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,621
You're not like him...

849
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:16,915
...or anyone else.

850
01:06:20,919 --> 01:06:22,462
Gus gives me things.

851
01:06:25,632 --> 01:06:27,592
Things I've never had in my life.

852
01:06:30,303 --> 01:06:32,055
Anything wrong with that?

853
01:06:33,181 --> 01:06:35,266
Not if you understand the risks.

854
01:06:39,938 --> 01:06:41,981
There are always risks.

855
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,210
Touch me.

856
01:07:37,954 --> 01:07:39,748
312, please.

857
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:43,251
Thanks.

858
01:07:48,006 --> 01:07:49,299
See you later.

859
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:54,804
You know what time it is?

860
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,516
I could fine you. I would,
if you were making any money.

861
01:07:58,767 --> 01:07:59,934
Wait till next year.

862
01:08:00,185 --> 01:08:04,355
There might not be a next year,
you keep pulling stunts like this.

863
01:08:04,564 --> 01:08:06,357
How long you been seeing her anyway?

864
01:08:06,608 --> 01:08:07,984
Since tonight.

865
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,445
I'd better tell you something.

866
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:15,700
You're a grown man. What you do with
your personal time is your business.

867
01:08:16,076 --> 01:08:18,578
I got it in the back of my mind,
that girl's bad luck.

868
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:22,290
- Well, you're a swell uncle.
- Got nothing to do with it.

869
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:23,792
I love her.

870
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:28,546
But I believe that bad luck has a way
of rubbing itself off on other people.

871
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,090
Don't worry about me.

872
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:31,216
Well, I am.

873
01:08:31,466 --> 01:08:33,259
See, I'm just considering you.

874
01:08:33,468 --> 01:08:34,803
I'll consider me.

875
01:08:41,601 --> 01:08:44,187
<i>Strike 3!</i>

876
01:08:59,619 --> 01:09:00,662
Where were you?

877
01:09:01,413 --> 01:09:02,956
I was with Gus.

878
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,336
He thought something
happened to me last night.

879
01:09:09,129 --> 01:09:10,463
It did.

880
01:09:29,816 --> 01:09:31,151
Strike 3!

881
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,153
You all right?

882
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:34,779
We'll get them next time.

883
01:09:37,157 --> 01:09:39,159
Haven't you been paying attention?

884
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:41,161
Strike 3!

885
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:51,045
You miss me?

886
01:09:55,216 --> 01:09:56,676
Strike!

887
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:16,404
What?

888
01:10:18,406 --> 01:10:20,784
Are you...
Are you all right?

889
01:10:21,701 --> 01:10:23,161
It's all right.

890
01:10:23,411 --> 01:10:24,412
Sorry, I...

891
01:10:24,662 --> 01:10:26,164
It's all right.

892
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:28,750
I just touched you right here.

893
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:30,502
It's okay.

894
01:10:46,017 --> 01:10:49,187
<i>The team bus is now
at the 34th Street entrance.</i>

895
01:10:49,395 --> 01:10:51,898
<i>Bus is at the 34th Street entrance.</i>

896
01:10:53,316 --> 01:10:54,776
Let's go.

897
01:11:01,408 --> 01:11:03,493
Straighten that good-looking tie.

898
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:06,246
Bye.

899
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:13,920
How you doing?

900
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,065
<i>Cub programs!</i>

901
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:37,402
<i>Get your Cub program here! 10 cents.</i>

902
01:11:37,652 --> 01:11:40,572
<i>Get your official Cub program here!
10 cents.</i>

903
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:48,121
Peanuts! 5 cents.

904
01:11:48,955 --> 01:11:53,042
<i>Now batting for New York,
number 9, Roy Hobbs.</i>

905
01:11:53,293 --> 01:11:55,128
<i>Hobbs coming to bat right now.</i>

906
01:11:55,378 --> 01:12:00,091
<i>He has a terrible batting score.
Can't get himself on the track at all.</i>

907
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:05,555
<i>Hobbs, trying to get
something started.</i>

908
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:08,808
<i>And here comes the pitch.</i>

909
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:12,020
Strike the bum out!

910
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:13,980
<i>Strike 2!</i>

911
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:16,357
<i>Lazy pitch there.
Strike 3!</i>

912
01:12:16,608 --> 01:12:18,860
<i>Hobbs goes down.
3 pitches, 3 strikes.</i>

913
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,403
You're a bum!

914
01:12:22,197 --> 01:12:23,948
Maybe you should try another bat.

915
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:26,076
Whatever's wrong isn't the bat.

916
01:12:31,664 --> 01:12:33,249
<i>Knights lead the Cubs 2-1.</i>

917
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,211
<i>Fowler's stepping up to the bat.
Short ball, a hit!</i>

918
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:41,341
<i>That's gonna be out in the right field.
He'll fire the ball into 3rd base.</i>

919
01:12:42,342 --> 01:12:44,302
<i>Safe at 3rd base!</i>

920
01:12:45,845 --> 01:12:48,765
<i>At the end of the 6th,
it's all tied up, 3-3.</i>

921
01:12:50,558 --> 01:12:54,771
Cubs leading by 1. Bivens at
the plate. He swings. Fly ball.

922
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:57,524
<i>Camaretti has problems,
he fumbles the ball!</i>

923
01:12:57,982 --> 01:13:01,152
<i>Bivens heads to the 2nd base.
Here comes the throw!</i>

924
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:18,378
<i>Now batting for New York,
number 18...</i>

925
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:20,880
<i>... John Olsen.</i>

926
01:13:49,784 --> 01:13:54,330
<i>Now batting for New York,
number 9, Roy Hobbs.</i>

927
01:13:57,292 --> 01:14:00,837
<i>Hobbs just can't get himself on track.
He's 0 for 2 today.</i>

928
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:03,006
<i>Stepping up right now,
he gets the signal.</i>

929
01:14:03,214 --> 01:14:06,426
<i>Bivens is at 3rd base.
3 to 3.</i>

930
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,094
Strike 1!

931
01:14:09,095 --> 01:14:11,389
<i>Pop Fisher's not happy.
Here's the pitch.</i>

932
01:14:11,973 --> 01:14:14,309
<i>- Swings and...
- Strike 2!</i>

933
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:20,940
<i>He just can't get himself set.
He hasn't had the concentration.</i>

934
01:14:22,317 --> 01:14:23,777
Sit down!

935
01:15:15,453 --> 01:15:18,248
<i>Folks, I'm telling you,
I've seen some power before...</i>

936
01:15:18,498 --> 01:15:20,875
<i>... but certainly Hobbs...</i>

937
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:23,002
Over here!

938
01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:26,297
- Where you going?
- You ever hit one that far before?

939
01:15:31,845 --> 01:15:33,513
Hobbs, turn around, will you?

940
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,140
What's he looking at?

941
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:37,350
- One more.
- Hobbs, over here.

942
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:45,942
This is for you.

943
01:15:47,694 --> 01:15:49,070
Nice lady.

944
01:16:41,247 --> 01:16:42,457
Are you married?

945
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:45,752
Hi, folks. What can I get you?

946
01:16:47,337 --> 01:16:49,881
- I'd like you to meet Roy Hobbs.
- Are you kidding?

947
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:53,551
What do you think I ran here for?
We got jiffy service? My pleasure.

948
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,095
He's a great fan of yours.

949
01:16:55,303 --> 01:16:57,388
- What can I get you?
- You got any lemonade?

950
01:16:57,597 --> 01:16:58,890
Sure have.

951
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:02,143
- I'd like the same, please.
- Two lemonades, coming up.

952
01:17:04,062 --> 01:17:06,481
No, not married.

953
01:17:08,066 --> 01:17:09,109
Are you?

954
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:11,194
No.

955
01:17:13,405 --> 01:17:17,075
It's unbelievable someone with your
looks would be on the loose so long.

956
01:17:19,077 --> 01:17:20,328
I don't get lonely.

957
01:17:25,291 --> 01:17:27,460
How is it the girls missed you?

958
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:31,881
I didn't see any point
in settling down.

959
01:17:33,675 --> 01:17:35,552
Two lemonades.

960
01:17:35,802 --> 01:17:36,928
Oh, boy.

961
01:17:37,178 --> 01:17:38,888
Ain't she a peach?

962
01:17:40,765 --> 01:17:42,392
I come here a lot.

963
01:17:45,562 --> 01:17:46,771
You go to many games?

964
01:17:47,355 --> 01:17:48,356
No.

965
01:17:51,109 --> 01:17:52,444
So why did you come?

966
01:17:53,236 --> 01:17:54,529
Maybe I shouldn't have.

967
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:56,614
I'm glad you did.

968
01:17:57,157 --> 01:17:58,616
Well, I don't know.

969
01:17:59,075 --> 01:18:00,785
We're not kids anymore.

970
01:18:00,994 --> 01:18:02,662
Things are never the same.

971
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:06,374
Am I different?

972
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:09,210
Am I?

973
01:18:12,714 --> 01:18:13,757
Yeah.

974
01:18:14,674 --> 01:18:15,800
A lot.

975
01:18:22,766 --> 01:18:25,643
I thought I saw you once
in a train station here.

976
01:18:27,395 --> 01:18:28,438
Really?

977
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,319
I used to look for you in crowds...

978
01:18:35,153 --> 01:18:37,947
...thinking someday
maybe you'd be there.

979
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:41,993
Somewhere I stopped.

980
01:18:48,917 --> 01:18:50,752
What happened to you, Roy?

981
01:19:05,725 --> 01:19:08,228
My life didn't turn out
the way I expected.

982
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:16,361
What is it?

983
01:19:16,569 --> 01:19:17,779
I've gotta go.

984
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:19,030
How come?

985
01:19:19,447 --> 01:19:20,949
I've just got to.

986
01:19:25,036 --> 01:19:27,163
I'd like you to come
to the game tomorrow.

987
01:19:27,622 --> 01:19:28,873
I can't.

988
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:30,333
I came today.

989
01:19:30,792 --> 01:19:32,001
I see. You work?

990
01:19:36,548 --> 01:19:37,382
Come.

991
01:19:59,988 --> 01:20:01,322
Surprise!

992
01:20:01,656 --> 01:20:03,366
It's me, Memo.

993
01:20:04,075 --> 01:20:05,243
Hi.

994
01:20:05,702 --> 01:20:06,578
Where are you?

995
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:09,247
I'm here in my room...

996
01:20:09,497 --> 01:20:13,835
...sitting in a white slip,
thinking of you.

997
01:20:16,045 --> 01:20:17,213
I miss you.

998
01:20:17,422 --> 01:20:18,965
I miss you too.

999
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:21,885
Did you hear? We won today.

1000
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:24,053
Yeah, I heard it on the radio.

1001
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,725
Congratulations.

1002
01:20:30,018 --> 01:20:31,394
Thanks.

1003
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,272
But you better get some rest.

1004
01:20:35,273 --> 01:20:36,733
You'll need it.

1005
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:38,485
Good night.

1006
01:20:39,194 --> 01:20:40,278
Good night, Roy.

1007
01:20:46,493 --> 01:20:48,286
And I love you too.

1008
01:20:51,581 --> 01:20:53,083
That was cute.

1009
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,418
Smooth enough?

1010
01:20:58,129 --> 01:21:00,924
You are in control, aren't you, pal?

1011
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,052
Sure, Gus.

1012
01:21:05,637 --> 01:21:06,596
Sure.

1013
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:11,017
<i>Hobbs steps up.
He shattered the clock yesterday.</i>

1014
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:14,813
<i>That's good! Bottom of the 3rd
inning. Hobbs looking in.</i>

1015
01:21:15,063 --> 01:21:18,650
<i>He swings! There's no doubt about
that one! Goodbye, Mr. Spalding!</i>

1016
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,152
<i>9 to 3. Bottom of the 6th.</i>

1017
01:21:21,403 --> 01:21:24,864
<i>He swings! There it goes!
Oh, my!</i>

1018
01:21:25,115 --> 01:21:27,117
<i>9th inning.</i>

1019
01:21:27,367 --> 01:21:29,828
<i>Here's the pitch. He swings!
I don't believe it!</i>

1020
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:33,873
<i>Four in a row!
What a day for Hobbs!</i>

1021
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:45,176
I just wanted to...

1022
01:21:45,969 --> 01:21:47,470
I'm glad you came.

1023
01:21:51,516 --> 01:21:53,393
Just think what I would've missed.

1024
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,186
That was just luck.

1025
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:57,105
I know better.

1026
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:01,443
Wait. Are you going?

1027
01:22:03,027 --> 01:22:03,903
No.

1028
01:22:04,154 --> 01:22:05,280
Can we...

1029
01:22:07,282 --> 01:22:08,616
...walk a bit?

1030
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:11,494
All right.

1031
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:19,711
I met a woman on a train to Chicago...

1032
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:23,298
...and it was a mistake.

1033
01:22:23,965 --> 01:22:25,967
Do you mean when you first left?

1034
01:22:26,676 --> 01:22:29,596
That was the beginning
of a lot of mistakes...

1035
01:22:35,101 --> 01:22:37,270
I was in the hospital
for a couple of years.

1036
01:22:39,105 --> 01:22:42,233
Finally I got out, and they
told me I couldn't play ball.

1037
01:22:46,071 --> 01:22:49,115
I didn't have any money,
and jobs were hard to come by.

1038
01:22:49,365 --> 01:22:51,034
I lost my confidence.

1039
01:22:51,284 --> 01:22:53,411
Then there was just no going back.

1040
01:23:00,418 --> 01:23:02,337
How long have you been in Chicago?

1041
01:23:04,756 --> 01:23:06,299
Ten years.

1042
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,314
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

1043
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:23,149
- Sure?
- I don't wanna put you out.

1044
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,860
It's not putting me out.
I'll just brew it up.

1045
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:27,320
- Nice cup of coffee?
- No.

1046
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,322
Something simple, iced tea?

1047
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:30,407
Iced tea.

1048
01:23:30,615 --> 01:23:32,409
I don't have any, but I'll brew some.

1049
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:33,993
You have to brew some?

1050
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:36,579
Then I'll have some coffee, okay?

1051
01:23:43,545 --> 01:23:45,296
This is a swell apartment.

1052
01:23:45,672 --> 01:23:47,006
Thanks.

1053
01:23:52,929 --> 01:23:54,264
Did you sell the farm?

1054
01:23:54,889 --> 01:23:55,849
No.

1055
01:23:56,433 --> 01:23:58,226
I'll always have that.

1056
01:23:59,936 --> 01:24:01,104
Good.

1057
01:24:02,397 --> 01:24:03,565
It's home.

1058
01:24:39,559 --> 01:24:41,060
It's my son's.

1059
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:49,694
He means the world to me.

1060
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,698
He's a great kid.

1061
01:24:58,411 --> 01:24:59,746
I'll bet he is.

1062
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:06,711
I'd like to meet him.

1063
01:25:07,253 --> 01:25:08,838
He's coming home pretty soon.

1064
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:12,050
Is he with his father?

1065
01:25:13,093 --> 01:25:14,135
No.

1066
01:25:17,889 --> 01:25:20,058
His father lives in New York.

1067
01:25:23,061 --> 01:25:24,104
Oh, you're...

1068
01:25:24,354 --> 01:25:28,858
But I've been thinking that he needs
his father now. He's at that age.

1069
01:25:29,818 --> 01:25:31,236
I think he needs him.

1070
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:36,116
Sure.

1071
01:25:37,826 --> 01:25:39,619
A father makes all the difference.

1072
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:19,033
You gotta catch your train.

1073
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:20,368
I can stay.

1074
01:26:20,577 --> 01:26:21,703
You'd better go.

1075
01:26:31,838 --> 01:26:32,672
Where to next?

1076
01:26:35,759 --> 01:26:36,968
Boston.

1077
01:26:42,223 --> 01:26:43,475
I'm sorry I missed your boy.

1078
01:26:44,893 --> 01:26:46,186
I'll tell him.

1079
01:26:46,686 --> 01:26:47,979
Roy Hobbs.

1080
01:26:48,605 --> 01:26:50,190
He won't believe it.

1081
01:27:54,087 --> 01:27:55,046
That's good!

1082
01:27:55,296 --> 01:27:56,631
Do a goose-step now!

1083
01:27:57,757 --> 01:27:59,801
I'm trying to shelter this guy.

1084
01:28:00,051 --> 01:28:01,678
Have a peanut, Bobby.

1085
01:28:02,387 --> 01:28:04,681
No, it's too late.
He's gonna be too old.

1086
01:28:04,931 --> 01:28:06,433
Did you do your homework?

1087
01:28:08,935 --> 01:28:09,769
All right!

1088
01:28:10,019 --> 01:28:11,146
Here goes nothing.

1089
01:28:16,317 --> 01:28:18,611
I blew a little too hard there.

1090
01:28:24,909 --> 01:28:28,747
Hobbs is making the whole situation
impossible to predict.

1091
01:28:28,997 --> 01:28:30,498
Only more difficult.

1092
01:28:30,707 --> 01:28:34,753
Hobbs will make it more interesting,
but he won't make the difference.

1093
01:28:48,683 --> 01:28:49,517
Safe! Safe!

1094
01:28:49,726 --> 01:28:50,685
He dropped the ball!

1095
01:28:56,733 --> 01:28:59,861
<i>Here's the pitch.
Hobbs swings! Long fly ball!</i>

1096
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:02,864
<i>That's right!
Goodbye, Mr. Spalding!</i>

1097
01:29:03,114 --> 01:29:06,618
<i>The Knights have tied for the finish!
They've tied for the finish!</i>

1098
01:29:06,951 --> 01:29:10,622
<i>You can hear this crowd!
They're going crazy! They got Hobbs...</i>

1099
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,397
Knock it off!

1100
01:29:36,231 --> 01:29:38,024
Hey, knock it off!

1101
01:29:41,903 --> 01:29:44,197
We gotta win another game
before this is over.

1102
01:29:44,447 --> 01:29:47,075
Don't jinx this. Look at this!

1103
01:29:49,661 --> 01:29:50,912
Now, come on.

1104
01:29:51,496 --> 01:29:53,248
Go home, get some sleep.

1105
01:29:53,623 --> 01:29:56,501
Knock off the booze. No booze!

1106
01:30:12,559 --> 01:30:15,937
<i>I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Would you place your call again later?</i>

1107
01:30:16,187 --> 01:30:18,106
Okay, thanks.

1108
01:30:21,109 --> 01:30:23,445
<i>The Knights simply have to win...</i>

1109
01:30:23,653 --> 01:30:28,366
<i>... one game against the Phillies
to put them in the World Series.</i>

1110
01:30:28,616 --> 01:30:31,286
<i>That wraps it up here
for this post-game show.</i>

1111
01:30:31,536 --> 01:30:33,747
I'll be right over to pick him up.

1112
01:30:33,997 --> 01:30:36,875
<i>Protect your car
with Valvoline Motor Oil.</i>

1113
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:39,711
<i>This is Jim Bauer inviting you
to join us...</i>

1114
01:30:52,056 --> 01:30:55,560
Boy, did I miss you!

1115
01:30:59,189 --> 01:31:01,399
What's going on here?

1116
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:03,777
A victory party.

1117
01:31:04,277 --> 01:31:06,237
We haven't won yet.
Whose place is this?

1118
01:31:06,488 --> 01:31:07,655
Mine.

1119
01:31:08,615 --> 01:31:10,033
At least it will be in a week.

1120
01:31:10,283 --> 01:31:13,661
- You must've hocked your fur for it.
- Never.

1121
01:31:13,995 --> 01:31:15,455
Gus chipped in.

1122
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:18,708
How do you like it?

1123
01:31:19,209 --> 01:31:20,251
I like it.

1124
01:31:22,587 --> 01:31:24,464
I'm not so sure anymore...

1125
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:26,716
...after Chicago.

1126
01:31:26,966 --> 01:31:28,885
Come on, Memo, how about a dance?

1127
01:31:29,594 --> 01:31:30,762
Sure, Al.

1128
01:31:31,012 --> 01:31:32,764
Don't wait up, grandpa.

1129
01:31:43,274 --> 01:31:45,485
Welcome home, slugger.

1130
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:48,321
Some blowout, huh?

1131
01:31:48,571 --> 01:31:51,449
All fresh food
from Jack and Charlie's.

1132
01:31:51,699 --> 01:31:53,368
How's the team holding up?

1133
01:31:53,618 --> 01:31:54,828
They can do no wrong.

1134
01:31:55,078 --> 01:31:58,123
When you're on a roll,
it's like that sometimes.

1135
01:31:58,373 --> 01:32:01,793
When you're not, every little thing
gets you down. What about you?

1136
01:32:02,043 --> 01:32:03,002
What about me?

1137
01:32:03,253 --> 01:32:06,131
I see you dug yourself
out of that hole you were in.

1138
01:32:07,507 --> 01:32:09,008
It must have cost you.

1139
01:32:09,259 --> 01:32:11,511
You're up, you're down.

1140
01:32:12,178 --> 01:32:13,680
How's the Judge treating you?

1141
01:32:15,181 --> 01:32:16,015
What's it to you?

1142
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:17,434
Nothing.

1143
01:32:18,184 --> 01:32:21,563
Except it's a shame that son of a bitch
is paying a player like you...

1144
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:23,189
...rock-bottom salary.

1145
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,526
- I can live with it.
- You gotta look to the future.

1146
01:32:27,402 --> 01:32:30,363
You can't build on what you don't got.

1147
01:32:30,739 --> 01:32:33,700
It's nice to know you worry
so much about a guy like me.

1148
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:38,580
Listen, I'm just bringing it up
because I know Memo's crazy about you.

1149
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:43,042
I mean, I wouldn't like to see you
lose her to a better provider.

1150
01:32:43,293 --> 01:32:45,128
Fame isn't enough, kid.

1151
01:32:47,297 --> 01:32:48,256
I'll take my chances.

1152
01:32:48,506 --> 01:32:52,635
Why should you, when we can all profit
from these little chats?

1153
01:32:53,428 --> 01:32:55,972
I mean, take tomorrow, for example.

1154
01:32:56,222 --> 01:32:58,308
Tomorrow I wouldn't bet against me.

1155
01:32:58,516 --> 01:33:00,560
You're missing the point, kid.

1156
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,771
I already have.

1157
01:33:10,695 --> 01:33:12,655
You can't hang on to the game forever.

1158
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,576
You can't get back into it
from jail either.

1159
01:33:21,498 --> 01:33:23,500
Isn't she something?

1160
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:25,543
Yeah, she is.

1161
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,380
What every guy would give
to be in your shoes, huh?

1162
01:33:31,299 --> 01:33:35,386
You're standing close. I can't tell
if it's your toes I'm feeling or mine.

1163
01:33:50,777 --> 01:33:52,862
I misjudged your boy.

1164
01:33:54,572 --> 01:33:56,950
I don't like being disappointed.

1165
01:34:01,204 --> 01:34:02,122
Try these clairs.

1166
01:34:02,372 --> 01:34:04,666
I was gonna go on this little...

1167
01:34:04,916 --> 01:34:07,627
The whipped cream's a little...
I don't like it.

1168
01:34:07,877 --> 01:34:09,295
It's not good for my stomach.

1169
01:34:09,546 --> 01:34:11,297
Try one of these.

1170
01:34:11,548 --> 01:34:12,424
Here.

1171
01:34:12,632 --> 01:34:13,967
Try this.

1172
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:17,178
Thank you.

1173
01:34:37,907 --> 01:34:40,618
Having a great time,
take it, everybody!

1174
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:08,521
You okay?

1175
01:35:09,022 --> 01:35:11,107
Roy, you okay? You okay?

1176
01:35:11,441 --> 01:35:12,484
Where's Pop?

1177
01:35:13,026 --> 01:35:14,944
"Where's Pop?" What are you, nuts?

1178
01:35:15,153 --> 01:35:16,279
Sit down.

1179
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:22,118
Get me out of here.

1180
01:35:23,161 --> 01:35:23,995
Let's go.

1181
01:35:24,245 --> 01:35:25,163
Call a cab.

1182
01:35:26,372 --> 01:35:27,707
Come on, come on.

1183
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:48,728
And how are we feeling today?

1184
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:58,196
Where am I?

1185
01:35:58,571 --> 01:36:00,824
Tower Maternity, Roy.

1186
01:36:01,449 --> 01:36:02,784
I'm Dr. Newman.

1187
01:36:03,034 --> 01:36:05,620
It was an emergency,
and we were the closest.

1188
01:36:08,915 --> 01:36:11,584
They lost three in a row.

1189
01:36:11,835 --> 01:36:14,712
What's done is done.

1190
01:36:16,131 --> 01:36:17,632
Am I okay to play Monday?

1191
01:36:18,174 --> 01:36:20,176
I'm afraid there's some bad news.

1192
01:36:20,927 --> 01:36:24,055
The lining of your stomach
has been gradually deteriorating...

1193
01:36:24,305 --> 01:36:25,807
...due to a previous injury.

1194
01:36:26,266 --> 01:36:29,936
We pumped your stomach
and came up with this.

1195
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:35,024
This silver bullet head has been
in your stomach for some time.

1196
01:36:35,233 --> 01:36:36,609
Years, I would say.

1197
01:36:37,402 --> 01:36:38,903
It doesn't matter.
It's history.

1198
01:36:39,112 --> 01:36:42,615
Yes, but it could prove fatal
if you continue to play baseball.

1199
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:46,161
Stop now, and in time
it could heal properly.

1200
01:36:46,953 --> 01:36:48,455
Can I play Monday?

1201
01:36:48,663 --> 01:36:51,166
The odds and your age
would be against you.

1202
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:56,671
One day, your stomach could easily
blow apart, kill you on the spot.

1203
01:36:59,549 --> 01:37:00,842
I'm sorry.

1204
01:37:04,137 --> 01:37:06,639
<i>Roy Hobbs, New York Knights' star,
is laid up...</i>

1205
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:09,517
<i>... at Tower Maternity Hospital
in New York City.</i>

1206
01:37:09,768 --> 01:37:13,104
<i>The full nature and extent
of his illness is as yet undisclosed.</i>

1207
01:37:13,354 --> 01:37:16,441
<i>His availability for Monday's
game against Pittsburgh...</i>

1208
01:37:16,691 --> 01:37:19,444
<i>... remains a question.
Turning to local news...</i>

1209
01:37:33,249 --> 01:37:34,584
May I come in?

1210
01:37:40,423 --> 01:37:42,342
You must've had a snoot full.

1211
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:44,344
It was a great party.

1212
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:59,025
I heard Gus and Max
talking last night.

1213
01:37:59,984 --> 01:38:00,860
What about?

1214
01:38:02,153 --> 01:38:05,323
He said that if you played Monday
it could kill you.

1215
01:38:05,657 --> 01:38:08,034
- It's a lie.
- No, it's not!

1216
01:38:11,413 --> 01:38:12,956
You're not gonna play.

1217
01:38:13,206 --> 01:38:15,333
Really, are you?

1218
01:38:16,459 --> 01:38:18,211
It would just be my last game.

1219
01:38:21,131 --> 01:38:23,007
It's his last game!

1220
01:38:23,258 --> 01:38:24,968
Well, that's rich!

1221
01:38:25,218 --> 01:38:27,637
You're trying to kill yourself,
aren't you?

1222
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:30,390
Doc's making it out
worse than it is.

1223
01:38:31,266 --> 01:38:34,352
Oh, he is? Sure he is!

1224
01:38:34,602 --> 01:38:36,980
Hey, why not?

1225
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:40,650
I look swell in black.
Don't you think I look swell in black?

1226
01:38:41,443 --> 01:38:42,318
I sure do.

1227
01:38:44,028 --> 01:38:47,449
Why don't we just get away?
Let's just go away right now.

1228
01:38:48,366 --> 01:38:50,076
I've been away long enough.

1229
01:38:50,535 --> 01:38:52,245
Oh, come on!

1230
01:38:52,829 --> 01:38:54,497
Why are you doing this?

1231
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:56,458
What for?

1232
01:38:56,833 --> 01:38:59,043
Just to play one last game,
is that it?

1233
01:38:59,627 --> 01:39:01,379
It's all I've got left.

1234
01:39:02,088 --> 01:39:03,465
Then I can walk away.

1235
01:39:04,674 --> 01:39:06,801
Well, I have a small favour to ask.

1236
01:39:07,969 --> 01:39:09,512
Walk away right now...

1237
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,348
...and you'll live for sure.

1238
01:39:12,932 --> 01:39:15,643
That way we can see
a whole lot more of each other.

1239
01:39:21,733 --> 01:39:24,194
And you won't walk away empty-handed.

1240
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:26,529
That's for sure.

1241
01:39:28,281 --> 01:39:29,449
What do you mean?

1242
01:39:31,868 --> 01:39:34,496
I mean, Gus will stake us
to a lot of money.

1243
01:39:36,247 --> 01:39:39,501
We can buy into a company.
Everybody does that.

1244
01:39:40,668 --> 01:39:45,256
Think what we can do, Roy.
With your name, we'll make out fine.

1245
01:39:46,966 --> 01:39:48,551
If I skip the playoff?

1246
01:39:48,802 --> 01:39:51,179
Come on, Roy, you understand.

1247
01:39:51,638 --> 01:39:54,307
You make up your mind
to have certain things.

1248
01:39:55,225 --> 01:39:57,018
You know how it is.

1249
01:39:58,353 --> 01:39:59,729
Yes, I do.

1250
01:40:01,815 --> 01:40:03,149
Do you?

1251
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,789
Just a few practice swings,
that's all.

1252
01:40:18,039 --> 01:40:19,582
Just to get back my timing.

1253
01:40:19,833 --> 01:40:21,292
It's my ass if Pop finds out.

1254
01:40:21,543 --> 01:40:23,878
We heard about that.
We heard about it already.

1255
01:40:24,129 --> 01:40:27,006
Just make sure you take it easy.

1256
01:40:27,257 --> 01:40:29,759
Roy's the money.
He gets hurt, we're out of a job!

1257
01:40:30,009 --> 01:40:31,136
We'll take it easy.

1258
01:40:31,386 --> 01:40:34,139
Just making a point. Take it easy.

1259
01:40:34,389 --> 01:40:37,434
Sometimes I wonder
what I'm doing in this game.

1260
01:40:37,684 --> 01:40:39,811
How do I get myself
in situations like this?

1261
01:40:40,061 --> 01:40:42,731
Diz, I think maybe
we heard that a couple of times.

1262
01:40:42,939 --> 01:40:46,651
He's always saying that. Don't know
about you, but he's making me nuts!

1263
01:40:49,154 --> 01:40:50,655
All right, here we go.

1264
01:40:56,161 --> 01:40:57,662
Come on, Diz.

1265
01:41:06,129 --> 01:41:07,881
You get that, Max?

1266
01:41:09,048 --> 01:41:11,342
Don't ever look back, Max! Ever!

1267
01:41:18,892 --> 01:41:19,934
Oh, my God!

1268
01:41:22,645 --> 01:41:24,355
Can you stand? Roy?

1269
01:41:25,273 --> 01:41:29,069
- We should've had more sense!
- It's all right. No one will know.

1270
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:30,987
No one's gonna know.

1271
01:41:31,196 --> 01:41:32,113
Take it easy.

1272
01:41:32,739 --> 01:41:34,783
We better get you
back to the hospital.

1273
01:41:48,922 --> 01:41:49,964
Who's there?

1274
01:41:50,215 --> 01:41:51,966
Don't be alarmed.

1275
01:41:54,344 --> 01:41:57,180
I understand that you are playing.

1276
01:41:58,723 --> 01:42:01,559
- I wouldn't want you to dock my pay.
- On the contrary.

1277
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:05,688
I wish to augment it with a bonus.

1278
01:42:06,564 --> 01:42:10,443
Now, as you may know,
we are favoured to win.

1279
01:42:11,611 --> 01:42:13,738
Which puts you back
working night court.

1280
01:42:13,988 --> 01:42:17,075
I have decided that
would be a grave mistake.

1281
01:42:17,492 --> 01:42:21,788
Now, financially speaking,
I can do better by not winning.

1282
01:42:22,122 --> 01:42:23,456
With your help, of course.

1283
01:42:23,832 --> 01:42:25,834
You put that in writing for Pop.

1284
01:42:26,042 --> 01:42:30,296
Now, as you may know, the prevailing
rate for this sort of thing...

1285
01:42:30,547 --> 01:42:32,298
...is $10,000.

1286
01:42:32,549 --> 01:42:34,801
I'm offering you twice that.

1287
01:42:35,343 --> 01:42:37,011
You're wasting your time.

1288
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:40,432
You know as well as I do that
you're in no condition to play.

1289
01:42:42,183 --> 01:42:43,560
Then why the 20,000?

1290
01:42:43,768 --> 01:42:45,395
Insurance.

1291
01:42:47,313 --> 01:42:48,982
You could get into the game.

1292
01:42:49,232 --> 01:42:52,402
You could wreck it
with an unexpected blow.

1293
01:42:54,487 --> 01:42:55,739
That'd be the beauty of it.

1294
01:42:55,989 --> 01:42:58,491
It's a monumental mistake, Hobbs...

1295
01:42:58,992 --> 01:43:03,997
...in light of certain information
that I now possess.

1296
01:43:05,623 --> 01:43:07,542
Police photographs...

1297
01:43:08,251 --> 01:43:11,421
...taken 15 years ago...

1298
01:43:12,088 --> 01:43:13,757
...in a hotel room.

1299
01:43:14,883 --> 01:43:16,384
By the way...

1300
01:43:16,843 --> 01:43:18,219
...that's you.

1301
01:43:18,803 --> 01:43:20,805
A nice young boy.

1302
01:43:21,639 --> 01:43:23,183
Half-naked lady...

1303
01:43:23,391 --> 01:43:24,934
...lying in the street.

1304
01:43:25,185 --> 01:43:28,772
You, in her room, shot.

1305
01:43:29,731 --> 01:43:31,107
Nasty business.

1306
01:43:31,524 --> 01:43:32,358
Mercy.

1307
01:43:32,567 --> 01:43:36,821
Full disclosure of this scandal in the
eyes of your admirers and loved ones...

1308
01:43:37,072 --> 01:43:41,367
...could only cause
humiliation. Embarrassment.

1309
01:43:42,577 --> 01:43:43,870
It was suicide.

1310
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:46,414
Oh, Mr. Hobbs...

1311
01:43:47,332 --> 01:43:50,085
...if kids should see this...

1312
01:43:51,753 --> 01:43:54,339
Now, it's a surprisingly
simple procedure.

1313
01:43:54,923 --> 01:43:58,134
You're to play your normal game,
except when you are at bat.

1314
01:43:58,384 --> 01:44:02,222
And then, under no circumstances,
are you to hit the ball safely.

1315
01:44:02,847 --> 01:44:04,391
They'll beat you without me.

1316
01:44:04,599 --> 01:44:07,477
Without you, they lost three in a row.

1317
01:44:08,436 --> 01:44:13,233
What is more, I have a contingency
plan for their flat failure.

1318
01:44:14,692 --> 01:44:16,319
Who else is in on this?

1319
01:44:17,112 --> 01:44:18,446
A key man.

1320
01:44:28,498 --> 01:44:30,500
Good night, Mr. Hobbs.

1321
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:48,560
Here's another. Listen.

1322
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:52,897
"We love to watch you hit that ball.
We cheer when you're connecting.

1323
01:44:53,148 --> 01:44:57,444
But it really shocked us, one and all,
to hear that you're expecting."

1324
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:00,155
Hold it. I didn't write those lines.

1325
01:45:00,405 --> 01:45:02,282
I didn't think you could read.

1326
01:45:04,117 --> 01:45:05,535
The babies. Please!

1327
01:45:05,744 --> 01:45:06,953
What about the babies?

1328
01:45:08,246 --> 01:45:10,081
How would you like to wake up to this?

1329
01:45:10,290 --> 01:45:12,876
I can't have this noise.
You're disturbing the mothers.

1330
01:45:13,084 --> 01:45:14,627
I guess that's you, guys.

1331
01:45:15,628 --> 01:45:17,130
Get well quick.

1332
01:45:17,672 --> 01:45:20,216
You just go out there
and play great ball.

1333
01:45:20,425 --> 01:45:21,384
Take care.

1334
01:45:23,428 --> 01:45:25,305
Get well, we need you. Take care.

1335
01:45:25,805 --> 01:45:29,851
Look out on the way out.
Just keep your eyes straight ahead.

1336
01:45:30,518 --> 01:45:32,604
It's gonna be tough without you, Roy.

1337
01:45:32,854 --> 01:45:34,189
Thanks, Diz.

1338
01:45:50,288 --> 01:45:51,164
Miss!

1339
01:45:52,165 --> 01:45:55,460
<i>Hi, I'm Max Mercy, sports columnist
for The Daily Mirror.</i>

1340
01:45:55,710 --> 01:45:58,171
I saw your picture in the paper.
Very nice.

1341
01:45:58,421 --> 01:46:02,884
Roy and I go back a long way. I wonder
if you'll help me a little on this.

1342
01:46:03,134 --> 01:46:07,430
See, I need a little help
if you could give some.

1343
01:46:07,639 --> 01:46:10,308
For Roy's defence, okay?

1344
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:13,436
Now, you know this woman?
You know what happened?

1345
01:46:15,021 --> 01:46:18,441
Anything to do with a love quarrel?

1346
01:46:18,691 --> 01:46:22,320
You might have known her,
she knew you, a love triangle?

1347
01:46:22,946 --> 01:46:24,656
A bad joke.

1348
01:46:26,032 --> 01:46:29,536
I thought you might be able
to help us with some little clue.

1349
01:46:31,621 --> 01:46:34,791
I'm gonna do everything I can
to keep this story from breaking.

1350
01:46:36,584 --> 01:46:37,669
Hey, miss?

1351
01:46:58,606 --> 01:46:59,899
Is there...

1352
01:47:01,526 --> 01:47:02,652
...a chair?

1353
01:47:10,285 --> 01:47:12,495
Doc says I have to quit baseball.

1354
01:47:13,955 --> 01:47:15,415
Why?

1355
01:47:20,295 --> 01:47:23,131
Some mistakes I guess
we never stop paying for.

1356
01:47:30,096 --> 01:47:31,681
I didn't even know her.

1357
01:47:33,099 --> 01:47:34,309
The girl on the train?

1358
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:43,651
You liked her, didn't you?

1359
01:47:46,863 --> 01:47:47,864
Yes.

1360
01:47:51,743 --> 01:47:53,078
But I didn't see it coming.

1361
01:47:53,953 --> 01:47:57,290
How could you know she'd hurt you?
How could anyone?

1362
01:47:58,333 --> 01:48:00,418
- I didn't see it coming.
- You should've?

1363
01:48:00,668 --> 01:48:01,669
Yes.

1364
01:48:02,629 --> 01:48:04,005
But I didn't.

1365
01:48:05,465 --> 01:48:06,925
Why didn't I?

1366
01:48:09,177 --> 01:48:10,845
You were so young.

1367
01:48:21,314 --> 01:48:23,024
Things sure turned out different.

1368
01:48:23,817 --> 01:48:24,734
In what way?

1369
01:48:25,819 --> 01:48:27,028
Different.

1370
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:34,452
For 16 years, I've lived
with the idea that I could be...

1371
01:48:34,702 --> 01:48:36,246
...the best in the game.

1372
01:48:37,455 --> 01:48:39,582
You're so good now!

1373
01:48:39,791 --> 01:48:41,543
I could've been better.

1374
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:46,297
I could've broke
every record in the book.

1375
01:48:46,881 --> 01:48:48,383
And then?

1376
01:48:49,426 --> 01:48:50,593
"And then?"

1377
01:48:52,762 --> 01:48:55,598
When I walked down the street,
people would've said:

1378
01:48:55,849 --> 01:48:59,936
"There goes Roy Hobbs, the best
there ever was in this game."

1379
01:49:10,947 --> 01:49:13,575
You know, I believe we have two lives.

1380
01:49:15,201 --> 01:49:16,619
How? What do you mean?

1381
01:49:17,537 --> 01:49:21,833
The life we learn with and
the life we live with after that.

1382
01:49:24,085 --> 01:49:25,837
With or without the records...

1383
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,548
...they'll remember you.

1384
01:49:30,842 --> 01:49:35,138
Think of all those young boys
you've influenced.

1385
01:49:35,388 --> 01:49:37,474
There are so many of them.

1386
01:49:42,562 --> 01:49:44,773
That day in Chicago,
why did you stand up?

1387
01:49:45,565 --> 01:49:47,901
I didn't want to see you fail.

1388
01:49:56,409 --> 01:49:57,994
I wish Dad could've...

1389
01:50:02,874 --> 01:50:04,918
God, I love baseball.

1390
01:50:13,384 --> 01:50:15,470
Are you gonna go to the game tomorrow?

1391
01:50:20,975 --> 01:50:22,227
Is your son with you?

1392
01:50:25,814 --> 01:50:27,190
He is.

1393
01:50:33,446 --> 01:50:34,531
Excuse me.

1394
01:50:45,458 --> 01:50:47,669
Well, I gotta go.

1395
01:51:29,085 --> 01:51:32,255
Tomorrow, after we've lost...

1396
01:51:32,964 --> 01:51:36,092
...I want Pop Fisher out of here,
bag and baggage.

1397
01:51:36,426 --> 01:51:38,553
That's right. Lay it all
on the line, Harry.

1398
01:51:38,803 --> 01:51:40,638
All of it.
That's right. You heard me.

1399
01:51:47,979 --> 01:51:48,938
I'll call back.

1400
01:51:52,025 --> 01:51:53,276
Slugger, you okay?

1401
01:51:54,903 --> 01:51:55,820
I'm fine.

1402
01:51:56,071 --> 01:51:58,364
- You look a little lost.
- I'm not.

1403
01:52:02,535 --> 01:52:04,621
You dropped this on your way out.

1404
01:52:06,831 --> 01:52:07,999
Something seems amiss.

1405
01:52:08,208 --> 01:52:10,919
Correct me if I'm wrong, Hobbs,
but we had a deal.

1406
01:52:12,212 --> 01:52:13,338
No.

1407
01:52:15,215 --> 01:52:16,633
Those are your winnings.

1408
01:52:16,841 --> 01:52:18,802
This is a gag.
Pick it up, get out.

1409
01:52:19,052 --> 01:52:22,472
If it isn't enough money,
tell us what you've got in mind.

1410
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:23,598
To hit away.

1411
01:52:26,518 --> 01:52:28,561
I thought I could rely on your honour.

1412
01:52:28,853 --> 01:52:29,854
You're about to.

1413
01:52:30,355 --> 01:52:32,774
You're a foolish, foolish man.

1414
01:52:33,525 --> 01:52:35,110
You've forgotten something.

1415
01:52:36,277 --> 01:52:37,153
Your past.

1416
01:52:37,362 --> 01:52:39,447
I don't care. Go on.

1417
01:52:39,656 --> 01:52:41,116
Get on the phone.

1418
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,326
No.

1419
01:52:43,701 --> 01:52:45,578
That won't be necessary.

1420
01:52:46,287 --> 01:52:47,997
I like the action.

1421
01:52:52,085 --> 01:52:53,878
Then let it ride.

1422
01:52:56,047 --> 01:52:57,465
You bastard!

1423
01:53:10,311 --> 01:53:11,771
I hate you.

1424
01:53:20,947 --> 01:53:22,240
I hate you.

1425
01:53:31,082 --> 01:53:32,667
You were right, Memo.

1426
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:36,004
We have met before.

1427
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:41,384
You're a lot weaker than I thought.
What do you think this changes?

1428
01:53:42,343 --> 01:53:46,514
Have Max draw you a picture. You can
read about it in the morning paper.

1429
01:53:47,265 --> 01:53:49,601
You're yesterday's news, kid.

1430
01:53:50,185 --> 01:53:52,937
You had a great gift, a talent.
But it's not enough.

1431
01:53:57,817 --> 01:53:59,611
I think you're a loser.

1432
01:54:10,497 --> 01:54:12,290
You can't let him go.

1433
01:54:15,585 --> 01:54:16,961
Relax.

1434
01:54:17,212 --> 01:54:20,840
With his insides, he's as good
to us now as he was before.

1435
01:54:21,925 --> 01:54:24,511
Besides, we're $20,000 richer.

1436
01:54:35,063 --> 01:54:39,192
I wanted to win that pennant worse than
I wanted any goddamned thing in my life.

1437
01:54:39,442 --> 01:54:42,737
You'd think I could
just this once, wouldn't you?

1438
01:54:43,822 --> 01:54:46,449
I didn't care nothing
about the Series.

1439
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:50,370
Win or lose,
I would have been satisfied.

1440
01:54:50,745 --> 01:54:54,416
I'd have walked away from baseball,
and I'd have bought a farm.

1441
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:57,335
Nothing like a farm.

1442
01:55:01,423 --> 01:55:04,092
Nothing like being around animals,
fixing things.

1443
01:55:04,342 --> 01:55:09,097
There's nothing like being in the field
with the corn and the winter wheat.

1444
01:55:13,685 --> 01:55:15,603
The greenest stuff you ever saw.

1445
01:55:17,063 --> 01:55:20,150
You know, my mother told me
I ought to be a farmer.

1446
01:55:23,653 --> 01:55:26,239
My dad wanted me to be
a baseball player.

1447
01:55:28,575 --> 01:55:31,035
You're better than
anyone I ever had.

1448
01:55:32,704 --> 01:55:35,206
And you're the best
goddamned hitter I ever saw.

1449
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:40,754
Suit up.

1450
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:20,627
Still dogging me, huh, Max?

1451
01:56:22,253 --> 01:56:23,463
End of the road, Hobbs.

1452
01:56:23,797 --> 01:56:26,132
You wanna hear what I think
our chances are?

1453
01:56:26,674 --> 01:56:28,385
You read my mind.

1454
01:56:29,427 --> 01:56:31,012
That takes all of 3 seconds.

1455
01:56:32,764 --> 01:56:35,683
They come and they go, Hobbs.
They come and they go.

1456
01:56:35,934 --> 01:56:39,187
I'll be around here longer
than you or anybody else here.

1457
01:56:39,396 --> 01:56:41,439
I'm here to protect this game.

1458
01:56:43,149 --> 01:56:44,609
Whose game?

1459
01:56:45,527 --> 01:56:49,155
I do it by making
or breaking the likes of you.

1460
01:56:50,281 --> 01:56:52,325
Did you ever play ball, Max?

1461
01:56:57,705 --> 01:56:59,249
No, never have.

1462
01:56:59,707 --> 01:57:02,293
But I make it a little
more fun to watch, you see.

1463
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:05,296
And after today, whether
you're a goat or a hero...

1464
01:57:05,964 --> 01:57:07,841
...you're gonna make me a great story.

1465
01:57:11,511 --> 01:57:12,387
See you around.

1466
01:57:20,937 --> 01:57:23,857
<i>And here come the New York Knights
as they take the field.</i>

1467
01:57:24,065 --> 01:57:27,736
<i>Everyone will have their eyes
on Hobbs, whose illness came close...</i>

1468
01:57:27,944 --> 01:57:30,321
<i>... to shattering
the Knights' dream of a pennant.</i>

1469
01:57:30,572 --> 01:57:33,158
<i>Hobbs moving to his position
in right field.</i>

1470
01:57:33,366 --> 01:57:37,412
<i>And just listen to that crowd
go wild for Hobbs!</i>

1471
01:57:39,372 --> 01:57:41,249
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

1472
01:57:50,341 --> 01:57:51,676
Let's go, Knights!

1473
01:57:51,885 --> 01:57:54,137
<i>He looks like he's set
and ready to go.</i>

1474
01:57:54,763 --> 01:57:57,140
<i>This is for the National
League Pennant!</i>

1475
01:57:57,390 --> 01:58:00,727
<i>The Knights versus Pittsburgh!
The playoff game!</i>

1476
01:58:01,019 --> 01:58:01,895
Play ball!

1477
01:58:02,604 --> 01:58:06,649
<i>Al Fowler on the mound. Two outs
as he faces Schaffer. The pitch!</i>

1478
01:58:07,358 --> 01:58:11,613
<i>Schaffer swings! Fly ball going out
over the field! Hobbs goes back fast!</i>

1479
01:58:18,703 --> 01:58:21,414
<i>The Pirates go down 1-2-3
in the 1 st inning.</i>

1480
01:58:21,664 --> 01:58:24,959
<i>- Feel okay?
- Bivens going in against Youngberry.</i>

1481
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:27,253
<i>Youngberry, ex cellent control.</i>

1482
01:58:27,462 --> 01:58:29,964
<i>18 and 9 on the season.
The pitch!</i>

1483
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:33,009
<i>Strike 3, inside corner!</i>

1484
01:58:33,468 --> 01:58:37,430
<i>Now batting, number 18, John Olsen.</i>

1485
01:58:38,515 --> 01:58:40,141
Come on, Roy!

1486
01:58:42,394 --> 01:58:44,604
<i>And strike 1 on Olsen.</i>

1487
01:58:46,481 --> 01:58:47,315
<i>Strike 2!</i>

1488
01:58:47,524 --> 01:58:51,694
<i>Hobbs kneels next to Bobby Savoy,
the batboy for the Knights.</i>

1489
01:58:53,029 --> 01:58:55,573
<i>Strike 3! Olsen badly fooled!</i>

1490
01:58:55,824 --> 01:58:59,285
<i>Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs!</i>

1491
01:58:59,494 --> 01:59:00,870
Come on, Roy!

1492
01:59:01,079 --> 01:59:04,249
<i>And listen to that chant!
The Roy Hobbs chant!</i>

1493
01:59:04,499 --> 01:59:06,167
<i>Hobbs batting.</i>

1494
01:59:18,763 --> 01:59:20,598
<i>Hobbs bats against Youngberry.</i>

1495
01:59:21,433 --> 01:59:22,308
<i>Youngberry...</i>

1496
01:59:22,517 --> 01:59:25,311
<i>... who made fifth place this year.
Here's the pitch!</i>

1497
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:26,646
<i>Swung on and missed!</i>

1498
01:59:27,105 --> 01:59:28,940
<i>Hobbs fooled by that pitch.</i>

1499
01:59:29,149 --> 01:59:31,526
<i>Now stepping back to the plate.
Youngberry gets set.</i>

1500
01:59:31,776 --> 01:59:34,738
<i>Hobbs has been 3 for 6
so far this season.</i>

1501
01:59:34,946 --> 01:59:37,115
<i>Youngberry looking in for the sign.</i>

1502
01:59:37,365 --> 01:59:39,534
<i>He goes to the wind-up.</i>

1503
01:59:39,743 --> 01:59:40,744
<i>The pitch!</i>

1504
01:59:40,994 --> 01:59:44,539
<i>Inside corner, strike 2! The
crowd was not happy with the pitch.</i>

1505
01:59:44,748 --> 01:59:45,790
<i>An ex cellent call.</i>

1506
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:50,670
<i>Youngberry looks in once again.
Hobbs sets himself. The concentration.</i>

1507
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,714
<i>Youngberry to the wind-up.
The pitch!</i>

1508
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,884
<i>Strike 3!
Hobbs is out of there.</i>

1509
01:59:56,593 --> 01:59:59,846
<i>And so at the end of one inning,
no score at all.</i>

1510
02:00:00,055 --> 02:00:03,224
<i>The big question is whether or not
Hobbs can get his timing back.</i>

1511
02:00:03,433 --> 02:00:07,771
<i>After a four-day layoff, it's difficult
for a hitter to step into the game.</i>

1512
02:00:08,021 --> 02:00:12,734
Hobbs came directly to the field with
no batting practice this afternoon.

1513
02:00:14,235 --> 02:00:16,112
<i>At the end of 3 innings,
no score.</i>

1514
02:00:16,362 --> 02:00:20,575
<i>Fowler looking in against Boyle.
Boyle, the count, 3 and 1.</i>

1515
02:00:21,409 --> 02:00:23,745
<i>The pitch! And he walks.</i>

1516
02:00:28,041 --> 02:00:30,752
<i>Terrific so far this afternoon.
Here comes Allen.</i>

1517
02:00:31,586 --> 02:00:35,465
<i>Allen's last time up grounded
out to 1 st base. Fowler looking in.</i>

1518
02:00:35,757 --> 02:00:37,175
<i>Boyle over on 1 st base.</i>

1519
02:00:37,717 --> 02:00:39,636
<i>Allen has good power.</i>

1520
02:00:44,057 --> 02:00:45,517
<i>Allen swings! Fly ball!</i>

1521
02:00:45,767 --> 02:00:47,685
<i>Back, back! Hobbs drifting back.</i>

1522
02:00:47,936 --> 02:00:49,604
<i>That's out of here!</i>

1523
02:00:51,648 --> 02:00:53,274
<i>The score is 2 to nothing.</i>

1524
02:00:53,483 --> 02:00:55,068
<i>Pittsburgh strikes first.</i>

1525
02:00:57,195 --> 02:01:00,949
<i>Fowler up until this point
has been absolutely outstanding.</i>

1526
02:01:01,157 --> 02:01:04,577
<i>That one got away from him.
Fowler not happy with it at all.</i>

1527
02:01:07,705 --> 02:01:10,458
<i>You can feel the anxiety
spreading through this crowd.</i>

1528
02:01:10,708 --> 02:01:12,001
Time!

1529
02:01:12,252 --> 02:01:13,962
<i>This is a little unusual.</i>

1530
02:01:14,170 --> 02:01:18,133
<i>Roy Hobbs has called time out
and is heading in to see Fowler.</i>

1531
02:01:19,092 --> 02:01:21,302
<i>It's kind of an unusual situation.</i>

1532
02:01:23,138 --> 02:01:24,305
Play ball!

1533
02:01:26,558 --> 02:01:27,434
Don't do it.

1534
02:01:27,642 --> 02:01:30,061
If this is for show,
you can cut the crap.

1535
02:01:33,565 --> 02:01:35,525
Give them the real stuff, Al.

1536
02:01:36,401 --> 02:01:38,111
I'll start pitching
when you start hitting.

1537
02:01:40,572 --> 02:01:41,906
What the hell's going on?

1538
02:01:42,699 --> 02:01:44,117
It's a surprise.

1539
02:01:44,325 --> 02:01:45,285
It's okay, Pop.

1540
02:01:46,327 --> 02:01:47,287
Let's play ball.

1541
02:01:57,797 --> 02:01:59,883
<i>Two to nothing,
the Knights at bat.</i>

1542
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:02,635
- This is it, Roy!
- Swing it, Hobbs!

1543
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:07,265
<i>Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs!</i>

1544
02:02:11,352 --> 02:02:12,437
Come on, Roy!

1545
02:02:16,524 --> 02:02:18,359
<i>Youngberry, the pitch!</i>

1546
02:02:19,194 --> 02:02:21,654
<i>A swing and a miss.
Hobbs misses.</i>

1547
02:02:22,489 --> 02:02:24,616
<i>Swing and a miss!
Strike 2!</i>

1548
02:02:27,452 --> 02:02:30,413
<i>Strike 3!
Hobbs falls to the ground!</i>

1549
02:02:31,206 --> 02:02:34,834
<i>Hobbs tried and missed it.
Knocked him to the ground.</i>

1550
02:02:35,043 --> 02:02:37,879
<i>Picks himself up again.
Youngberry overpowering.</i>

1551
02:02:38,088 --> 02:02:41,758
<i>Hobbs just hasn't been able
to put it together this evening.</i>

1552
02:02:43,176 --> 02:02:45,178
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

1553
02:02:45,428 --> 02:02:46,763
Excuse me.

1554
02:02:48,765 --> 02:02:50,308
It's all right, slugger!

1555
02:02:50,558 --> 02:02:52,018
Come on, Hobbs!

1556
02:02:52,435 --> 02:02:54,729
It's important
that Roy Hobbs gets this.

1557
02:02:54,979 --> 02:02:56,356
I just can't do that.

1558
02:02:56,606 --> 02:03:01,361
I know. I have his son in the stands.
He doesn't know his son is here.

1559
02:03:01,611 --> 02:03:04,572
- I can't do it.
- Please. I don't know what to say.

1560
02:03:05,657 --> 02:03:09,869
<i>At the end of 6 innings,
no score at all for the Knights.</i>

1561
02:03:17,502 --> 02:03:21,089
<i>At the end of 6 innings,
again, 2 to nothing.</i>

1562
02:03:21,339 --> 02:03:22,966
<i>The Knights still...</i>

1563
02:04:49,344 --> 02:04:52,847
<i>LaJong hits the ball into the field!
Here comes the throw!</i>

1564
02:04:53,223 --> 02:04:55,100
<i>And Frenchie is out of there!</i>

1565
02:04:55,517 --> 02:04:59,020
<i>Shouldn't have gone for two.
He's trying to get something started.</i>

1566
02:04:59,229 --> 02:05:02,315
<i>At the end of 7,
2 to nothing, Pittsburgh.</i>

1567
02:05:02,982 --> 02:05:05,610
<i>Fowler's been overpowering
ever since the 4th inning.</i>

1568
02:05:05,860 --> 02:05:07,404
<i>Getting himself settled down.</i>

1569
02:05:07,654 --> 02:05:09,948
<i>Fowler looking in against Yancey.
The pitch!</i>

1570
02:05:10,198 --> 02:05:12,450
<i>Throw, swing and a miss!
Strike 3!</i>

1571
02:05:12,826 --> 02:05:16,496
<i>At the top half of the 9th,
still 2 to nothing.</i>

1572
02:05:17,163 --> 02:05:20,750
<i>Two outs right now. Bivens going
back to get himself another bat.</i>

1573
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,171
<i>Nothing has worked so far.
Maybe he'll try another one. Bivens...</i>

1574
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,716
<i>... 0 for 2 today. The pitch!</i>

1575
02:05:28,007 --> 02:05:29,843
<i>There's the shot over the right field!</i>

1576
02:05:31,010 --> 02:05:33,513
<i>Allen picks it up.
He's throwing it!</i>

1577
02:05:33,722 --> 02:05:35,473
<i>There's the throw! He is safe!</i>

1578
02:05:41,146 --> 02:05:42,105
<i>2 outs!</i>

1579
02:05:57,412 --> 02:06:00,039
<i>Hobbs is 0 for 2.
What a game we have tonight!</i>

1580
02:06:00,373 --> 02:06:03,460
<i>From the stretch, Youngberry looks...</i>

1581
02:06:03,710 --> 02:06:04,919
<i>The pitch!</i>

1582
02:06:05,128 --> 02:06:07,505
<i>Olsen swings!
Ground down to 3rd base!</i>

1583
02:06:09,424 --> 02:06:11,217
Run, you son of a bitch! Run!

1584
02:06:13,636 --> 02:06:16,056
<i>The ball rolls free!
Bivens takes 3rd!</i>

1585
02:06:21,061 --> 02:06:25,023
<i>Now batting, number 9, Roy Hobbs.</i>

1586
02:06:38,328 --> 02:06:40,163
Come on, Roy!

1587
02:06:54,594 --> 02:06:55,970
<i>The pitch!</i>

1588
02:07:03,853 --> 02:07:06,940
<i>Hobbs has been
an outstanding player all year!</i>

1589
02:07:11,569 --> 02:07:13,905
<i>Youngberry! The pitch again!</i>

1590
02:07:17,367 --> 02:07:19,619
<i>Time out! Heading for the mound.</i>

1591
02:07:20,328 --> 02:07:24,124
<i>That may be it for Youngberry.
Taking no chances at all. That's it.</i>

1592
02:07:24,374 --> 02:07:28,878
<i>He's gonna go for a left-hander.
Youngberry not happy at all about this.</i>

1593
02:07:29,087 --> 02:07:31,923
<i>Youngberry has only given up
3 hits in the entire game.</i>

1594
02:07:32,257 --> 02:07:34,050
<i>A beautiful pitching performance.</i>

1595
02:07:34,259 --> 02:07:35,301
Let's go!

1596
02:07:35,552 --> 02:07:37,929
<i>Young John Rhoades
strides to the mound.</i>

1597
02:07:38,179 --> 02:07:42,225
<i>A Nebraska farm boy,
blazing left-handed speed.</i>

1598
02:07:42,475 --> 02:07:45,478
<i>The Pirate organization expects
great things for him.</i>

1599
02:07:45,729 --> 02:07:47,480
You can hit it!

1600
02:07:47,689 --> 02:07:52,026
<i>They say he's got the best fastball
in the major leagues right now.</i>

1601
02:07:54,028 --> 02:07:56,114
<i>This is the game for the World Series.</i>

1602
02:07:56,364 --> 02:08:00,577
<i>One of these teams will be, tomorrow,
playing in the World Series.</i>

1603
02:08:00,827 --> 02:08:02,328
<i>It comes down to this.</i>

1604
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:14,257
<i>Hobbs, with determination,
trying to make it happen.</i>

1605
02:08:16,009 --> 02:08:17,510
<i>The pitch! He swings!</i>

1606
02:08:17,719 --> 02:08:19,220
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1607
02:08:19,429 --> 02:08:22,390
<i>He's trying to destroy
the press box right next to us!</i>

1608
02:08:22,599 --> 02:08:26,227
<i>Absolutely broke the glass
right next to our radio booth here!</i>

1609
02:08:41,451 --> 02:08:42,327
Strike!

1610
02:08:55,882 --> 02:08:58,259
<i>This is it!
This is the game right now.</i>

1611
02:08:58,510 --> 02:09:01,513
<i>Hobbs is at the bat still.
He brought them this far.</i>

1612
02:09:01,763 --> 02:09:05,642
<i>Will he take them all the way?
The pitch! Hobbs hits!</i>

1613
02:09:06,309 --> 02:09:09,104
<i>Fading, fading, it's a foul ball!</i>

1614
02:09:26,371 --> 02:09:27,914
Let's go!

1615
02:09:41,803 --> 02:09:43,221
Pick me out a winner, Bobby.

1616
02:10:12,459 --> 02:10:13,793
Come on, Roy!

1617
02:10:55,126 --> 02:10:56,503
Are you all right, fella?

1618
02:10:59,255 --> 02:11:00,673
Let's play ball.

1619
02:11:35,458 --> 02:11:36,876
Come on, one time!

1620
02:11:38,545 --> 02:11:40,088
Attaboy, Roy!

1621
02:11:54,227 --> 02:11:57,397
<i>And it's spinning way
back up, high over the right field!</i>

1622
02:11:57,647 --> 02:12:01,568
<i>That ball is still going!
It's way back, high up in air!</i>

1623
02:12:02,152 --> 02:12:04,446
<i>He did it! Hobbs did it!</i>

1624
02:17:43,159 --> 02:17:44,202
