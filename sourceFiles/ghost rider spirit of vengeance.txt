1
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,485
Benedict.

2
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,801
Is this true?

3
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,009
You have found the boy?

4
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,367
Yes.

5
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,721
He's not safe here.

6
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,882
Nonsense, this is a fortress.

7
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,644
The full resources of the Order

8
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,245
are at our disposal.

9
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,927
Respectfully,

10
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,721
Benedict, the devil himself
wants this child.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,281
Only one place is safe.
That is the Sanctuary.

12
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,851
The Rider must take him.

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,610
You do enjoy your wine, Moreau.

14
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,481
In a few days,

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,042
the winter solstice will be past
and with it the hour of the prophecy.

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,123
Then the boy will be
of no use to anyone.

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,842
By that time.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,126
Brother,

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,924
you will all be dead.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,248
This conversation is finished.

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,041
They're inside!

22
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,527
Go!

23
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,768
Nadya!

24
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,688
I can help you!

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,365
Damn it. Danny!

26
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,722
I can protect you!

27
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,927
Where are they?

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,650
Shut up!

29
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,922
Perfect.

30
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,560
Who is this guy?

31
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,970
Screw this.

32
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,763
Duck!

33
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,526
<i>It doesn't matter how far you run.</i>

34
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,202
<i>There are some demons
you just can't escape.</i>

35
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,129
<i>My name is Johnny Blaze.</i>

36
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,124
<i>I rode a motorcycle for a living.</i>

37
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,805
<i>I did a bare-ass, 360,</i>

38
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,691
<i>triple backﬂip
in front of 22,000 people.</i>

39
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,085
<i>It's kind of funny.
It's on YouTube. Check it out.</i>

40
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,727
<i>But when my dad got sick,</i>

41
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,804
<i>I did something
way crazier than that.</i>

42
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,561
You look like you
could use a little help.

43
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,530
Are you willing to make a deal,

44
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,688
John?

45
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,091
Attaboy.

46
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,282
Do it.

47
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,202
Save his life.

48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,803
Do it!

49
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,648
<i>Yeah, that is right. I'm the guy
who made the deal with the devil.</i>

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,131
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

51
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,763
<i>Doesn't this kid watch movies?
Does this ever work out fine?</i>

52
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,481
<i>Let's just say good judgment
was not exactly my forte.</i>

53
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,484
<i>I was possessed by
an ancient demon.</i>

54
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,521
<i>In the presence of evil,
I change into a monster,</i>

55
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,011
<i>and I pray</i>

56
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,321
<i>on the wicked,</i>

57
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,609
<i>and I suck out their souls.</i>

58
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,922
<i>And you don't wanna be around
when that happens.</i>

59
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,805
<i>See, there's good and bad
in all of us.</i>

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,684
<i>And maybe you're not a murderer,</i>

61
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,646
<i>but you did something
you wouldn't want the Rider to</i> see.

62
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,049
<i>A white lie, an illegal download.</i>

63
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,890
<i>What about you? And you?</i>

64
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,969
<i>I've tried to fight it, to hold it back,</i>

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,802
<i>but the darkness inside me
only gets stronger.</i>

66
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,965
<i>That's why I had to run</i>

67
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,127
<i>halfway across the world.</i>

68
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,242
<i>And I'm still running.</i>

69
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,203
Who are you?

70
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,408
My name is Moreau.
My brothers are dead,

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,083
as should I be,
if not for the intervention of God.

72
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,926
And you are John Blaze.

73
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,402
Go away.

74
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,129
I can't do that.

75
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,087
Ah.

76
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,722
It likes

77
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,802
the dark places.

78
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,008
I don't know what
you're talking about.

79
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,369
The Rider.

80
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,491
You thought that you could control it.

81
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,400
Make it work for you, huh?

82
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,289
That you were stronger

83
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,171
than this deep, hungry thing?

84
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,162
This

85
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,322
sickness.

86
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,802
Why are you here?

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,001
Aah!
What do you

88
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,650
want from me?

89
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,568
I need your help
and you need your soul.

90
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,042
So we make a deal.

91
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,931
You know about making deals,
don't you, Johnny? Huh?

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,131
Nice bike.

93
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,291
This child.

94
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,201
He is in danger

95
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,482
and for more than his life.

96
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,642
You will save him.

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,408
I don't

98
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,682
save people.

99
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,803
What brought you
out here, Johnny Blaze?

100
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,440
Thousands of miles
from your place of birth

101
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,490
and your dark rebirth.

102
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,123
You were brought here for this.

103
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,485
This little kid,
what makes you think I can find him?

104
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,924
This man that you met years ago
that put the curse

105
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,445
On you?

106
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,290
Roarke.

107
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,442
The devil has many names.

108
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,729
He is the link that connects you
to this child.

109
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,683
Let the Rider follow his stench.
It will lead you to the boy.

110
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,960
You said something
about a deal.

111
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,244
The church of my masters
is an ancient one.

112
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,525
We are prepared to give to you the one
thing you want the most of this world.

113
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,085
Bring us the boy,
and we will lift your curse.

114
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,602
Hello.

115
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,206
Hi.

116
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,248
I, uh... I noticed you were,
um, looking at me.

117
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,522
Yes?
Was I?

118
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,569
Nice suit.

119
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,451
Oh, thank you very much.

120
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,971
It's, uh...

121
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,202
Are you Roma?

122
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,845
Gypsy?

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,206
Why do you ask?

124
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,689
Well, what people say about...

125
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,200
What?

126
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,404
Listen, um.

127
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,086
I am a businessman.
Mm-hm.

128
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,401
I have a lot of money.

129
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,961
Yeah?

130
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,690
And...
And?

131
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,326
Hey, Mommy. Where's Daddy?

132
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,764
I, um... Excuse me.
No, no, no.

133
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,046
- It's okay.
- No, really.

134
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,725
No, really, I... Yeah.

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,490
<i>Sorry.</i>

136
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,924
Somebody's gonna have
a lot of explaining to do.

137
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,929
We won't always have to do this.

138
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,246
Okay?

139
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,528
I wanna make a life for you.

140
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,285
This is a life.

141
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,163
You know I love you more
than anything.

142
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,243
I love you too, Mama.

143
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,443
<i>So many times I've tried to keep
the Rider from coming out, but tonight,</i>

144
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,204
<i>I need him.</i>

145
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,047
Hold on!

146
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,962
What happened?

147
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,485
Hold on.

148
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,364
Stay in and lock the doors.

149
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,327
Nadya.

150
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,928
No!

151
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,127
It's been

152
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,725
a long time, pumpkin.

153
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,563
Carrigan.

154
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,762
I see you're still an unbelievable

155
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,921
pain in the ass.

156
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,488
Look, I got people after
Danny and me,

157
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,449
so just let me go.

158
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,045
Let me go!

159
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,367
I'm the people after you.

160
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,047
No!

161
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,286
Don't touch him!

162
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,646
Get off!

163
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,567
Get up.

164
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,087
Heh. Whoops.

165
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,449
Oh! Unbelievable.

166
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,128
Still the fighter.

167
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,700
Carrigan.

168
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,768
- Yes?
- Please.

169
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,168
He's my son.

170
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,164
I know.

171
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,289
But he's not mine.

172
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,407
And part of you

173
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,449
had to know it might
end up like this.

174
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,488
Well, kill it.

175
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,369
Hungry.

176
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,690
Oh, God.

177
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,044
Slugthrowers, now.

178
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,882
Don't look at it.

179
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,281
Whoa!

180
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,206
No!

181
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,566
No!

182
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,045
Get some.

183
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,246
Move, now!

184
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,446
Get him in the car.

185
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,601
Get in!

186
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,606
Danny!

187
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,091
Oh, you have awake.
Hi.

188
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,609
Heh. It's funny,
because when you walked in,

189
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,603
I thought I was still dreaming.

190
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,925
You have hallucinate?

191
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,242
No, no, man, I'm not hallucinating.
Ha, ha.

192
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,767
Look, I'm flirting with you.

193
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,807
You're beautiful.

194
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,007
Okay.

195
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,127
Morphine?

196
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,281
You got any morphine?

197
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,920
Oh, no, no, morphine,
you already have.

198
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,445
Dilaudid, Valium? What?

199
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,886
Your wounds...

200
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,408
Very weird,

201
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,686
mister.

202
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,562
The <i>poliţie</i> want to talk to you when
you wake up. I tell them you wake.

203
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,409
No!

204
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,811
Please.

205
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,525
I'm fine. Let me go!

206
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,041
Take a piss.

207
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,681
Carrigan.

208
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,407
I got your package, but the cost of
doing business with me just went up.

209
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,846
I don't understand.

210
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,525
What's not to understand?

211
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,169
I want more.
You understand that?

212
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,410
We had an agreement, Carrigan.

213
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,003
Changing the defined terms of an
agreement is something we just don't do.

214
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,289
You told me to get a kid.
Not a problem.

215
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,369
I've done that
for people before.

216
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,047
And I have history
with his bitch of a mom,

217
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,562
so there's no better guy for the job.
But what you didn't tell me

218
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,929
is that I'd be walking into the middle
of a goddamn horror movie.

219
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,767
<i>Oh, this is funny</i>

220
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,648
<i>To you?</i>

221
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,325
Three of my guys got turned
into matchsticks last night

222
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,689
by a dude on a motorcycle
with his head on fire.

223
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,921
Come again?

224
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,162
<i>You heard me. I've seen things,</i>

225
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,891
weird things, bad things.

226
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,611
But that thing last night? No.

227
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,451
<i>No, no, no.</i>
Put the boy on the phone.

228
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,970
Talk.

229
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,042
<i>Talk.</i>

230
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,283
Danny, do you hear me?

231
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,446
I want you to listen

232
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,729
very closely. Listen to me.

233
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,684
What the hell was that?

234
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,767
Think of the child as a sort of computer.
You know computers, right?

235
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,003
I just uploaded
a little program.

236
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,731
A firewall.

237
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,408
Our friend on the motorcycle won't be
able to sense him now, to track him.

238
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,042
Of course, he still may be able

239
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,204
<i>to find you,
so I suggest you keep moving.</i>

240
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,451
Hello?

241
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,846
Who sent you to find me?

242
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,401
Is it the devil?
The devil that walks among men?

243
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,441
Does the devil own you?
Answer me!

244
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,409
The kid, Danny.
He's your son?

245
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,401
Bullets can't hurt you
when you walk with the demon.

246
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,642
But they'll do
what they're supposed to

247
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,165
right now.

248
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,409
Tell me why I can trust you.

249
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,690
You can't.

250
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,288
But if I don't find your son,

251
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,085
I'd just as soon be dead.

252
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,203
So if you

253
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,043
wanna pull

254
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,008
that trigger...

255
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,930
do it.

256
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,406
Please.

257
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,610
You tracked us last night.

258
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,209
Can you do it again?

259
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,208
I could feel him before.

260
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,330
I could sense him and then nothing.

261
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,605
No, no, he's not dead,
he's just blocked.

262
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,129
But you know something.

263
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,810
Let's go.

264
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,965
Yeah, okay, well, let
me just get something straight.

265
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,602
The guy who kidnapped Danny
and tried to kill you and blew me up

266
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,084
with grenades,

267
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,688
you two were like
boyfriend, girlfriend?

268
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,406
Carrigan was a gunrunner,
a drug dealer, a mercenary.

269
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,086
I didn't care about that.
I just saw a ticket out.

270
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,163
Right, okay, and so Danny is...?

271
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,004
Danny, what, is Carrigan's son?

272
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,763
No.

273
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,966
Um...

274
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,441
When you met the seducer,
he offered you something.

275
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,567
Yeah. My father's life.

276
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,810
Shocker, he lied.

277
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,487
For me, it was only myself.

278
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,045
It was supposed to be big
for Carrigan, but it went bad.

279
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,564
I made it out a third-floor window.

280
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,451
<i>I was choking on my own blood.</i>

281
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,490
<i>I knew I was gonna die.</i>

282
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,081
<i>I could feel it.
And that's when he found me.</i>

283
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,008
You look like you
could use a little help.

284
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,170
Roarke.

285
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,926
He promised to take
the pain away,

286
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,730
to save my life.

287
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,326
But he asked
for something in return.

288
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,610
A son?

289
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,130
Maybe you can never understand.
No, I get it.

290
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,642
You're the devil's baby mama.

291
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,444
I guess that explains
why Moreau

292
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,965
wants

293
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,368
Danny so bad.

294
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,045
Moreau?
Yeah.

295
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,686
Black, French, alcoholic priest,
a dick. Know him?

296
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,121
He tried to help us.
I didn't let him.

297
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,411
Well, we're both gonna work
on our decision-making.

298
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,891
Where you headed?

299
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,451
Someone I know.

300
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,401
He does Carrigan's dirty work.
He'll know where to find him.

301
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,008
<i>Why does the devil walk
on earth in human form anyway?</i>

302
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,727
<i>I have no idea.</i>

303
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,971
<i>Maybe he doesn't know either.</i>

304
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,882
<i>Maybe he just</i>

305
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,891
<i>passes on from body to body,</i>

306
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,327
<i>through history,
waiting for the perfect fit</i>

307
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,846
<i>But I know one thing:</i>

308
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,562
<i>On Earth, he's weak.</i>

309
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,571
<i>His powers are limited.</i>

310
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,087
<i>He needs emissaries</i>

311
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,446
<i>to do his dirty work,</i>

312
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,128
<i>so he finds them or makes them
using his greatest power:</i>

313
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,009
<i>The power of</i>

314
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,124
<i>the deal.</i>

315
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,170
Can I open a window?

316
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,131
You think you can just talk?

317
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,731
Your mom thought she could just talk,
until I kicked her little Gypsy face in.

318
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,602
Grab him.

319
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,524
Get me... Get me out of here!

320
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,082
I told you to stop eating the Twinkies.

321
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,368
Get me out of here!
Get off me.

322
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,610
Boss!

323
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,570
Come here.

324
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,449
Try that again, you little turd...
Ha-ha-ha.

325
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,002
What?

326
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,249
Dude, what happened?

327
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,004
You speak English?

328
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,161
Yeah. What happened?

329
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,046
Is that your van?

330
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,242
Uh, yeah.
Does it run?

331
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,845
Yeah.

332
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,802
When we get

333
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,726
where we're going,
the Rider's going to come out.

334
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,049
And when he does,

335
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,807
he'll destroy
whoever's got it coming.

336
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,089
Nadya, this thing,

337
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,921
there's no reason, no conscience,

338
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,447
just hunger.

339
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,081
In his eyes...

340
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,081
you're no different than Carrigan.

341
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,128
You're no different
than any of them.

342
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,649
I'm not afraid of you.

343
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,644
Yeah? Well, you should be.

344
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,482
That's the guy?
He looks like he works

345
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,926
on a cruise ship.

346
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,124
Am I gonna regret taking you?

347
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,843
Um, yeah, probably.

348
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,406
Count every dollar!

349
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,289
I don't want these idiots robbing me.

350
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,441
Everyone's robbing me!

351
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,250
It makes my balls hurt!

352
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,521
Hello, Vasil.

353
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,808
Long time, Nadya.

354
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,002
You look good.

355
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,606
Shut up.

356
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,966
He's talked to Carrigan.

357
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,965
The last couple of days
and a few hours ago.

358
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,923
John?

359
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,085
You talked to Carrigan?

360
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,045
I talk to a lot of people. I got
what you need for the shakes,

361
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,366
my friend.

362
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,611
Carrigan must've told you

363
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,730
about that thing that killed
his men last night. Huh? Yeah?

364
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,688
That thing

365
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,763
is inside of me. See,

366
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,045
you're a bad man and this thing,
the Rider, he feeds on bad men.

367
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,010
And he's hungry. He's hungrier
than he's been in years.

368
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,288
That's why I'm shaking!
Because right now,

369
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,444
the only thing standing
between you and the Rider is me.

370
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,688
And he's just... He's...

371
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,047
He's scraping at the door.
Scraping

372
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,962
at the door!

373
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,887
If you don't tell me

374
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,203
what I wanna know,
I'm gonna let him out.

375
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,450
And when he's done with you, there won't
be anything left, do you understand?

376
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,728
Do you understand?
Shake your head yes or no.

377
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,120
Uh-huh.
Good.

378
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,566
Good girl.

379
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,210
Where's Carrigan?

380
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,005
Um...

381
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,242
I want the kid!
The kid Carrigan has!

382
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,526
You will tell me

383
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,371
or I will eat your
stinking soul! Aah!

384
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,888
The quarry. For more guns, more men.
He's putting together

385
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,202
a goddamn army.
I know the place.

386
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,242
You won't mention this
conversation to anyone?

387
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,169
No, no, no.
Huh? Ah.

388
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,482
Yeah. All right, well,
that was a good answer.

389
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,288
- Yeah, good.
- John.

390
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,406
We gotta go.
We gotta go, we gotta go.

391
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,445
FGM-148 Javelin.

392
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,490
Lock on, fire and forget.

393
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,725
American bunker buster.

394
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,880
Two-stage detonation.

395
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,810
The first creates

396
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,405
a super vacuum.

397
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,562
It sucks the oxygen from the air.

398
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,569
The next...
I know what it does.

399
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,967
Give me four of them,
with extra heads.

400
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,764
How many men you go up against?

401
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,005
Just one.

402
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,689
Danny?

403
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,968
Mom?
Are you okay?

404
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,646
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

405
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,968
Ow!

406
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,163
What?
I think my ankle's broken.

407
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,084
Come on, hold on.

408
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,923
Oh, no.

409
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,529
Come on, hold onto me.

410
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,571
Showtime.

411
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,803
Hey!

412
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,486
What is it?

413
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,361
I don't care.

414
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,927
Give me that thing.

415
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,605
Give it to me.
Now.

416
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,566
Shit!

417
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,562
That was awesome.

418
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,122
Reload. Just reload.

419
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,805
Give me that.

420
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,206
Okay.

421
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,207
I'm sorry, did that hurt?

422
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,527
It looked like

423
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,721
it did.

424
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,208
Come on.

425
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,441
Let's go.

426
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,971
Hurry!

427
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,087
Sorry. Does it hurt?

428
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,767
It looks like it does.

429
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,730
What are you waiting for?
Do it! Do it!

430
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,920
He's coming.

431
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,930
Unh! Let me go.

432
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,925
Enough.

433
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,322
Let her go.

434
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,609
So that happened.

435
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,441
There you go.

436
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:02,247
It was a bee. I thought it was
gonna sting your face.

437
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,410
Well, are you feeling better?

438
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,761
Your leg's all healed, huh?

439
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,930
Like all by itself.

440
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,044
That's weird.

441
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,280
Where's my mom?

442
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,722
She's gassing up the truck.

443
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,887
Ahem. I know
that it's a little awkward.

444
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,803
Me rolling with you guys.
I mean, after everything that you've

445
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,485
been through.
Dude.

446
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,211
You're cooler than the guys
she usually hangs outwith.

447
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,365
Huh.

448
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,245
Hey.

449
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,404
So, what's next?

450
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,046
Moreau thinks that the danger
will pass in a few days.

451
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,043
If we just get Danny
someplace safe,

452
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,282
a holy place,
where his people can protect us,

453
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,885
then we can ride it out.

454
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,251
Okay.

455
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,086
I've already contacted Moreau. He's
gonna catch up with us on the road.

456
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,088
We gotta move fast because the ones
who are hunting us, they're not done.

457
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,167
Plus, I have some personal issues
I'd kind of like to get fixed.

458
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,607
You're not done, Carrigan.

459
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,211
You were to bring me
Nadya's son.

460
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,651
I do expect you
to fulfill your obligation.

461
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,443
S... S... S... Sorry, jackass,

462
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,329
but I'm dead.

463
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,241
Inconvenient.

464
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,644
What'd you do to me?

465
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,641
Gave you a second chance.

466
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,809
You're a little less than alive now.

467
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,128
But also more.

468
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,241
You see, I've given you power.

469
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,370
The power of

470
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,528
decay.

471
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,848
Of darkness.

472
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,365
Whoa.

473
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,290
I want that boy, Carrigan.

474
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,367
Now you've got no

475
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,090
excuses.

476
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,725
The machine last night?

477
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,207
Yeah?

478
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,044
You made it change.

479
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,482
That's how it works.

480
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,564
Whatever he rides changes with him.

481
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,682
And what if he took a taxi?

482
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,122
Uh...

483
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,849
I don't know.
I don't know. Why?

484
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,367
Or a roller coaster or a ski lift
or a camel or a...

485
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,165
Dude.

486
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,925
What if you have to pee
while you're on fire?

487
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,843
Oh, it's awesome. It's like a
flamethrower, you know? It's like:

488
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,767
When you change,
when you're him,

489
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,609
does it feel good?

490
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,845
Sometimes.

491
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,651
What does it mean?
Are we just bad?

492
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,325
No.

493
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,447
This power that we have
comes from a dark place,

494
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,887
but it's not who we are.

495
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,526
It never will be.

496
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,004
And we can use it to do good,

497
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,009
to help people. Ahem.

498
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,082
Like I'm helping you and your mom.

499
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,280
I know why you're helping.

500
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,682
She says you wanna get rid of it.

501
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,243
I can't ever do that.

502
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,683
Hey, Nadya. I hope you have
finished shooting at me!

503
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,166
Hey.

504
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,688
You wanna have some fun?

505
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,611
Hang on.

506
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,770
Whoo!

507
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,169
That is so weird.

508
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,003
<i>So this is it, Moreau's happy place.</i>

509
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,765
<i>These guys will lift my curse?</i>

510
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,887
<i>They don't even have shoes.</i>

511
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,361
Amen.

512
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,125
Amen.

513
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,127
You mustn't be afraid.

514
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,009
It was God that led you here.

515
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,521
What's up?

516
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,803
I know. A little

517
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,286
uptight. Not so bad

518
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,408
once you get to know them.

519
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,243
Now go on.

520
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,722
They will take

521
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,564
good care of you.
What about

522
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,568
you two?

523
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,448
We will join you later. We have some
business to complete between us.

524
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,170
I made a promise to you, John.

525
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,722
Why can't he come with us?

526
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,370
- No!
- Danny.

527
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,363
Danny,

528
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,170
you're safe here.

529
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,010
We made it.

530
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,169
The only thing that can hurt
you and your mom now

531
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,049
is me.

532
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,840
I need to make sure
that will never happen.

533
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,004
It'll be all right.

534
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,370
I promise.

535
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,367
Whatever.

536
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,726
Come on.

537
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,361
Are you sure about this?

538
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,242
Come on.

539
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,449
- Where are we going?
- To my favorite room.

540
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,522
If there is one thing
these sons of bitches know, eh,

541
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,364
it's wine.

542
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,162
This bottle would fetch
50,000 euros at an auction.

543
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,041
Moreau.

544
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,247
Oh, yeah.

545
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,880
What is it?
It's...

546
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,011
This thing inside of me.
I'd like to know before we, uh,

547
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,450
commence.

548
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,561
Zarathos was an angel,

549
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,768
a Spirit of Justice.

550
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,089
<i>Sent to protect the world of men.</i>

551
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,051
<i>But he was tricked,</i>

552
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,801
captured,

553
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,407
<i>brought down to hell,</i>

554
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,360
<i>corrupted.</i>

555
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,122
<i>Driven insane.</i>

556
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,290
Heh.

557
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,322
His mission to protect
the innocent was perverted

558
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,528
into a lust to punish

559
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,801
the guilty.

560
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,405
<i>He became</i>

561
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,682
<i>the Spirit of Vengeance.</i>

562
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,480
Yeah, but the angel,
the Spirit of Justice,

563
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,130
he's alive in there?

564
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,729
Somewhere?

565
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,689
He could be.

566
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,844
Do you feel him?

567
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,285
No.

568
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,881
Cheer up, my man.
Soon you will be free.

569
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,728
This bottle...

570
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,405
Ah.

571
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,043
This one is over 2000 years old.

572
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,643
I've had my eye on it for a while.

573
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,921
When this is over,

574
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,889
we will share it, huh?

575
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,970
There's something else.

576
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,726
This thing that Roarke has
done to you is not easily undone.

577
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,129
You risk death.

578
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,284
Worse than death.

579
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,202
You must confess

580
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,803
the one thing that is most
difficult for you to talk about.

581
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,690
Um...

582
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,285
My dad.

583
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,643
I didn't do it for him.

584
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,608
I made the deal for me.

585
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,284
I couldn't let him go.

586
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,848
It was selfish.

587
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,207
He was ready to die.

588
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,202
He knew it was his time.

589
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,043
And I thought I could change that.

590
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,685
I'm sorry.

591
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,520
This is the lamb of God

592
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,765
that takes away all the sin
from the world.

593
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,849
Happy are those
that are called to receive him.

594
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,601
You say that you're not worthy
to receive him.

595
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,926
I'm not.

596
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,321
Okay, that's good enough.

597
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,369
The body of Christ.

598
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,804
Ahem. Uh, amen.

599
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,205
You've been carrying this
bread around for a while.

600
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,845
May God lead you
into the eternal life.

601
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:48,246
That is, John, if today is,
in fact, your last.

602
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,201
<i>Where you go now, I cannot follow.</i>

603
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,330
<i>Are you ready?</i>

604
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,201
Hello?

605
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,241
Hello?

606
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:11,803
Hey.

607
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,044
Merry Christmas, you assholes!

608
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,363
Make the deal.

609
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,640
Moreau!

610
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,291
Moreau!

611
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,929
Moreau!

612
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,690
Moreau!

613
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,210
You did it!

614
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,482
Moreau!

615
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,449
Moreau!

616
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,650
It worked.

617
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,928
No! Let me go!

618
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,246
Help me!

619
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,408
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Get off me!

620
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,085
Let me go!

621
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,130
What are you doing?

622
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,370
What will be done.

623
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,929
The day of prophecy is tomorrow.

624
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,402
We were to hold the boy
until the danger passes.

625
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,080
The danger will not pass,
Moreau.

626
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,924
As long as the boy exists,

627
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,768
the power

628
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,002
will always be inside him.

629
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,770
You lied to me.

630
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,490
You lied to me!

631
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,766
This child must be destroyed.

632
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,842
No!

633
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,965
No!

634
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,370
You might have protested
while the child was being conceived.

635
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,083
Now it is too late.

636
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,924
Take them away

637
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,650
until the thing is done!

638
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,361
Go!

639
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,168
Danny's soul can still be saved!

640
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,085
That boy is one of God's children!

641
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,930
No!

642
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,284
He is not.

643
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,806
Pretty neat, huh?

644
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,530
Mm.

645
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,245
Peace, brother.

646
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,284
Damn.

647
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,921
Bet you're happy to see me.

648
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,560
Did Danny do this?

649
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,004
No. Somebody got here
before they could...

650
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,924
Before they could kill him.

651
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,969
There's no sign of him.

652
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,406
Whoever did this wanted

653
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,085
him alive.
I think we all

654
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,005
have a pretty good idea
who that would be, Moreau.

655
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,326
Yeah. So now he's

656
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,966
with Roarke. Some protectors
you turned out to be.

657
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,647
What exactly does Roarke
have in mind for Danny?

658
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,600
What are his plans for his son? Is he
putting money away for college? What?

659
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,482
It is the day

660
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,971
of prophecy

661
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,887
As was the day Danny
was conceived.

662
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,404
The child must be
in his 13th year

663
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,245
before the rite can be performed
on the dawn of winter.

664
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,726
The rite.

665
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,646
Roarke fathered the boy as a vessel,
as a container for his power.

666
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,764
The ritual will transform
his essence,

667
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,241
his soul into the boy.

668
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,569
There will be no more Danny.

669
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,929
Only Roarke.
No!

670
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,287
Why the hell didn't you tell us this?
Hey.

671
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,408
You made a deal with Roarke!

672
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,047
Both of you!
Something I would never do.

673
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,931
The prophecy had to happen
at the dawn of a new day.

674
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,445
Maybe there's still time.

675
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,887
Do you know where Roarke has him?
I think so.

676
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,889
What, so now you want
to play hero?

677
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,368
You got what you wanted.

678
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,808
Yes, I did.

679
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,527
Thank you for holding up
your end of the bargain.

680
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,245
You're welcome.

681
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,851
If I can spend my last day

682
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,963
as a free man without a curse

683
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,485
over my head, I'll take it.

684
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,249
But I promised Danny
he'd be safe.

685
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,809
And if I walk away now,

686
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,361
I'm just trading
one demon for another.

687
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,406
So let's go.

688
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,368
Was there ever any doubt?
Don't

689
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,965
touch me.

690
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,885
Cutting it a bit close,
aren't we?

691
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,166
You have any idea

692
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,207
what I had to go through

693
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,886
to get this little turd?

694
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,682
Look,

695
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,322
the planets don't align for your
pagan party until daybreak tomorrow.

696
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,087
So get off my ass because
I'd say I'm ahead of schedule.

697
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,401
Danny.

698
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,847
Do you know who I am?

699
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,284
Well, I'm sure
your mother told you

700
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,408
a lot of things about me.

701
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,804
What's the matter
with your face?

702
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,202
<i>Uzak Gökten.
The farthest point from heaven.</i>

703
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,487
That is where the ritual is to take place,
according to the prophecy, of course.

704
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,605
Of course.

705
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,560
Without the Rider, we stand
very little chance against Roarke.

706
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,370
You were
supposed to have faith.

707
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,851
I do.

708
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,891
But also, I think
we should have weapons.

709
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,566
Guns

710
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,085
and wine.

711
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,810
Naughty priests.

712
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,441
I'm starting to like you again,
Moreau.

713
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,604
You wanted to know
why I look this way.

714
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,725
Think of

715
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,771
a flamethrower.

716
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,649
Is that funny?

717
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,809
Okay.

718
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,726
A flamethrower
made out of papier-mâché.

719
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,200
All that

720
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,930
power.

721
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,410
But try to use it, you burn up.

722
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,721
This body I'm living in,

723
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,487
it's weak, human.

724
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,323
It's dying.

725
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,602
It was never made to do
the things that I can do.

726
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,285
But you,

727
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,570
you're only part human.

728
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,486
You have all the power
that I have inside of you.

729
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,722
Like father, like son.

730
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,041
But this

731
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,127
corporeal

732
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,725
form

733
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,965
can wield the power
without burning itself up.

734
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,888
To help you

735
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,723
relax.

736
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,448
That will keep him sedated
until the ceremony.

737
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,211
Who are they?

738
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,930
Politicians, murderers,
people of influence.

739
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,928
The devil's soldiers.

740
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,402
They've traveled
from all over the world

741
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,449
to witness the anointing
of the new king.

742
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,046
Oh. The new king.

743
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,685
Please.

744
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,604
If Roarke succeeds,

745
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,367
he'll have a new form, one more
powerful than he's ever known.

746
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,731
And a shadow will
fall upon the earth.

747
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,362
Twenty-five,

748
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,841
30 men. More inside.

749
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,650
The ritual has already begun.

750
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,207
Danny's soul
will be lost forever

751
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,081
at the break of dawn. This is
when Roarke is at his weakest.

752
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,445
Nadya?

753
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,604
You all right?

754
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,171
I've made a lot
of mistakes, Blaze.

755
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,841
But Danny...

756
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,802
Danny's the one...

757
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,087
The one good thing

758
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,129
I ever did.

759
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,966
Well, ahem,
that being the case,

760
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,170
we had better make sure he doesn't
turn out to be the Antichrist.

761
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,922
Okay. Not much time.

762
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,206
What's the plan?

763
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,204
Plan is you go, you grab the boy,
you run and you don't stop.

764
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,041
What about you?

765
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,887
Me? I'm going through the front.

766
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,404
Okay. Ha, ha.

767
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,002
Not bad.

768
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,169
This might be good on a salad.

769
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,202
Johnny Blaze!

770
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,081
Go.

771
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,402
Ahh.

772
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,605
Catch this one, huh?

773
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,324
What a waste of good wine!

774
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,321
That felt good.

775
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,922
Come on.

776
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,291
Danny, listen to me.

777
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,363
I shouldn't have gotten rid
of the power.

778
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,090
I know that now.

779
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,651
He's gonna erase you, Danny.

780
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,761
Moreau.

781
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,846
I can still see the light!

782
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,407
Oh.

783
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,645
Ugh. That's gross.

784
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,601
You have no power, Blaze.

785
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,089
You're nothing but an insect

786
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,369
like the rest.

787
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,841
Food for the mills

788
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,365
Of hell.

789
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,841
No.

790
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,371
Not yet.

791
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,166
Oh, you wanna watch?

792
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,646
The apple doesn't rot
far from the tree! Heh, heh.

793
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,926
Danny.

794
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:32,448
This is not who you are.

795
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,523
It never

796
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,091
will be.

797
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,961
My powers and yours are the same.
That's what you said.

798
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,646
Right?

799
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,810
Dad?

800
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,922
Like father, like son.

801
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,885
Do it.

802
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,369
No!

803
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,768
Whoa.

804
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:40,842
Whoa!

805
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,682
Come here.

806
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,961
Enough!

807
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,081
I was never afraid of you.

808
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,251
Roadkill.

809
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,724
You!

810
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,403
Worst fucking deal I ever made.

811
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,364
Go home.

812
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,684
Danny!

813
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,127
The angel.

814
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,608
Moreau

815
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,367
said that the Rider
was an angel that went crazy.

816
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,560
I can feel him,

817
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:32,124
the angel.

818
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,328
I can feel him.

819
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,010
Danny?

820
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,124
Danny?

821
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,965
Did we win?

822
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,524
I'm gonna say yes.

823
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,123
Hell, yes.

824
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,525
<i>My name is Johnny Blaze.</i>

825
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,444
<i>I'm the Ghost Rider.</i>
