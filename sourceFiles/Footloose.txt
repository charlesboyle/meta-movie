1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,630
<i>Two, two, one, two.
Mic check one, two. One, two.</i>

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,261
<i>Oh, yeah. Y'all know
what's coming up, don't you?</i>

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,722
<i>Come on, I got it right here.
I got it right here.</i>

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,057
<i>Bomont High School, where you at?</i>

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:23,230
<i>We got something to celebrate!
Bomont Panthers, 31!</i>

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:29,194
<i>Bayson Bulldogs, 17!
We killed 'em, y'all! Yeah!</i>

7
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,115
<i>All right, I want everybody
on the dance floor! Come on!</i>

8
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,075
<i>What? What? Y'all ready to party?</i>

9
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:41,081
<i>Get up, get up! I thought
this was a party! Let's dance!</i>

10
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,464
Hey, Robert!

11
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,801
Yeah!

12
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,554
<i>Bomont High, where are you at now?</i>

13
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,100
- I'm not kidding.
- They did not!

14
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,811
- Yes, they did.
- They did not.

15
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,187
We going to Mama's?

16
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:31,358
<i>We're about to get real wild tonight,
y'all! Come on!</i>

17
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,409
- Ron, where we going tomorrow?
- We're going to Mama Cannon's.

18
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,954
I'm sorry, guys.
Suzy gets the final call.

19
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,999
Turn it up, turn it up!
It's the best part!

20
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,375
Louder, Bobby!

21
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,194
Dispatch, stand by. I've got the
driver here. License and registration.

22
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,071
- Step forward for me, please, sir.
- All right.

23
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,493
<i>He is testing us.</i>

24
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,497
<i>Our Lord is testing us.</i>

25
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,418
<i>Especially now...</i>

26
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,880
<i>...when we are consumed with despair.</i>

27
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:40,302
<i>When we are asking our God
why this had to happen.</i>

28
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,226
No parent should ever have to
know the horror

29
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,811
of burying their own child.

30
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,398
And yet...

31
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,819
...five of Bomont's brightest
have lost their lives.

32
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,740
Among them, my only son.

33
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,495
My boy. Bobby.

34
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,212
We have other children
to raise here in Bomont.

35
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,925
And one day, they will
no longer be in our...

36
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,012
...embrace and in our care.

37
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,765
They will belong to the world.

38
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,395
A world filled
with evil and temptation...

39
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,023
...and danger.

40
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,071
But until that day,
they are ours to protect.

41
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:46,451
That is the lesson to be taken
from this tragedy. That is our test.

42
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,335
We cannot be missing
from our children's lives.

43
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:17,524
The following measures will be read
and voted on accordingly.

44
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:22,070
A curfew for minors under the age of 18
will take effect immediately.

45
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,574
Minors must be home
by ten p. m. on weeknights,

46
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,493
11 p. m. on weekends.
All in favour, say "Aye".

47
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,955
- Aye.
- Opposed.

48
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,248
Motion carries.

49
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,293
Punitive measures will be taken
against any individual,

50
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,421
group or property owner who organises
a public gathering

51
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,591
where minors engage in
inappropriate activities.

52
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,803
Such activities include consumption
of alcohol or unlawful drugs,

53
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,598
listening to vulgar or demeaning
amplified music,

54
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,810
or participating in lewd
or lascivious dancing.

55
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,438
- All in favour, say "Aye".
- Aye.

56
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,898
Motion carried.

57
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,610
There will be no public displays of
dancing unless supervised as part of

58
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,404
a school, civic or
church-related function.

59
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,990
Outside of these
authorised institutions,

60
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:11,161
public dancing among Bomont's minors
will be in violation of the law.

61
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,373
- All in favour, say "Aye".
- Aye.

62
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,711
Reverend? Your vote, please.

63
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,593
- Aye.
- Opposed. Motion carried.

64
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:50,594
This is my car.

65
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,182
Momma, it's Ren! He's here!

66
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,975
I'm gonna beat you!

67
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,396
Hey, girls. How you doing?

68
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,106
You guys are huge!

69
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,318
- Get off of me! Attack of the cousins!
- Who'd you find, Amy?

70
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,072
- Hey, darling.
- Hey, how you doing?

71
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,201
Good. Hope you got some
sleep on that bus.

72
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,244
Yeah, I got plenty of sleep.
No worries, Lulu.

73
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,580
- Hey, boy.
- Wesley.

74
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,415
You used to call me Uncky Wes.

75
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,417
You too big in the britches
for that now?

76
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,628
- Is anybody hungry?
- I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

77
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:28,590
- Sounds good. Need a hand with that?
- I got it, thanks.

78
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,010
Hey Ren, I wanna tell you a joke.
How do you make a tissue dance?

79
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,929
Put a little boogie in it.

80
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,807
Hey, buddy, I tell you about
these baked beans?

81
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,268
Your great grandma Esther,
who you didn't know.

82
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,895
This is her secret recipe.

83
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,064
Yeah, you know what
the secret ingredient is?

84
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,482
Bourbon.

85
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,443
It's not bourbon. It's a ton of butter.

86
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,072
- That's code for bourbon.
- Now, we do burgers on Saturdays.

87
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,742
I didn't know if you were a vegetarian,
or a vegan or something?

88
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,036
No, no, no, this is great, it's good.
Thank you.

89
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,746
- It's grass-fed beef.
- Thank you.

90
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,956
With a bit of possum.

91
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,708
- OK. Whose turn is it?
- Daddy's!

92
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,504
Let's join hands. Bow your heads.

93
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,883
Most gracious heavenly Father,
we ask you to bless this food,

94
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,346
nourishment of our body and
greater strength for Thy good.

95
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,349
Help us be ever mindful
of the needs of others.

96
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,434
- Amen!
- Amen.

97
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,815
This used to be my office,
but Lulu fixed her up for you.

98
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,569
It's got all the essentials...
water, power, bed.

99
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:38,743
Look, I appreciate what you've
done here. Taking me in and all.

100
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:45,041
There, at the end, the money
you sent us... It really helped.

101
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,837
I wish I could have done more.

102
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,841
Now, look... there's rules in my house.

103
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,552
They're not written down,
they're just common sense.

104
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,932
Do your schoolwork. Don't stay out late,
that's not just my rule, that's the law.

105
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,020
And don't give people attitude.
This ain't Boston.

106
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,188
I really want to
pull my own weight around here...

107
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,025
Cooking meals, getting work,
helping out.

108
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,653
My buddy, Andy Beamis runs
a cotton gin up on Chulahoma.

109
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,697
He said you can start
in the middle of next week.

110
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,532
Couldn't I work at the car lot with you?

111
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,535
I'm good with engines, oil changes.
That's how I made money back home.

112
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:25,415
In this economy, that's the best I got.
I suggest you learn to love it.

113
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,083
Come on.

114
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,378
How am I supposed to
get to work and school?

115
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,631
You got subways out here in Mayberry?

116
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,966
There's that Yankee sarcasm
I've been hearing about.

117
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,720
Wish it were funnier. OK.

118
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,682
You say you're good with engines?
I'll make you a deal.

119
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,853
If you can get this baby running,
she's all yours.

120
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,777
- This?
- That's a bad-ass car, boy.

121
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,822
OK, OK. The door sticks.

122
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,201
And the gas pedal's missing.
A couple of the, uh...

123
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,827
Hey, it's a fixer-upper.

124
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,375
He did it! He did it!

125
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,131
Have a safe trip!

126
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,776
Oh, shit!

127
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,629
Step out of your vehicle, son.

128
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,467
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Driver's license.

129
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,057
Massachusetts, huh?

130
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,934
You got that music cranked
pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack.

131
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,229
You gonna throw me in jail
for playing Quiet Riot?

132
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,147
Let's watch that attitude, son.

133
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,941
- Yankee sarcasm.
- What was that?

134
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,694
Nothing. Sir.

135
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,322
- You'll have to appear in court.
- For what?

136
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,449
Disturbing the peace.

137
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,662
Peaceful out here, isn't it?

138
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,918
<i>Progress.
What does progress mean to you?</i>

139
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,881
<i>We have computers in our pockets,</i>

140
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,968
<i>telephones in our automobiles,
and money on a plastic card.</i>

141
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,638
Who here today remembers a time
when you had to go

142
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,266
inside the bank to get your money?

143
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,395
Remember old Mr. Rucker
down at Bomont State Bank?

144
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:02,400
Every time you made a deposit, he'd
give you a piece of Bazooka gum.

145
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,862
Now, I haven't yet met an ATM machine

146
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,115
that would give me a piece
of Bazooka chewing gum,

147
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:15,079
let alone make me feel special,
like Mr. Rucker did.

148
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,206
Now, is that progress?

149
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,251
Today...

150
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:25,882
...more and more, as families,
we are tuning each other out.

151
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,926
We're either surfing on the Internet,

152
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,262
texting on our cell phones, or
staring mindlessly at a television set.

153
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:38,686
Now, if that is a portal to the world,
I want no part of it.

154
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,817
These are the people
that we need to tune in to.

155
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,738
Everyone in this church.

156
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,450
- Thanks for coming today.
- Nice preaching today, Reverend.

157
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,285
- Good to see you.
- Yes, sir, you, too.

158
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,498
This is my sister's son, the one
I was telling you about. Ren MacCormack.

159
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,209
- Ren, Ren, welcome to Bomont.
- How you doing?

160
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,628
- We are so happy to have you with us.
- Thank you.

161
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,339
I think you're gonna like
Bomont High School.

162
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,759
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,
the graduating class this year

163
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,428
is the biggest in the school's history.

164
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,263
Hey, Roger! Come on over here!

165
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,599
How many seniors
we have at Bomont High this year?

166
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:21,312
- About 220, give or take a dropout.
- Roger's the school principal there.

167
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,273
- Hello.
- Wait... Do you play football?

168
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:28,945
- 'Cause we really need a good kicker.
- Ain't that a fact!

169
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,948
But, remember, if you're gonna play
for us, you gonna have to stay clean,

170
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:36,369
keep out of trouble. I heard you
already had a run-in with the law.

171
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,954
You what?

172
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:42,417
I don't know how it is up in Boston,
but down here we have rules

173
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,168
against playing music too loud.

174
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,547
You're kidding me.
He got popped for playing music?

175
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:51,592
Ariel! I want you to meet my daughter,
she goes to Bomont.

176
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,428
You're going to need a friend
on your first day.

177
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:57,181
This is Ren MacCormack. He'll be
attending school with you tomorrow.

178
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,270
- Hey.
- Hey.

179
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,397
- Hey, Dad?
- Yes, honey?

180
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,357
Rusty and I have that
science project due tomorrow,

181
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,902
we're going to be working on it pretty
late. I was thinking I'd stay over.

182
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,115
- Is that OK?
- On a school night? Is that necessary?

183
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,660
Rusty! Don't you think
it's gonna take us all night?

184
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,456
Sure. At least.

185
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,336
- I guess it's fine, right...
- Thanks, Daddy. Bye, Mom.

186
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,508
Come on, let's go.

187
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,891
<i>And with two laps to go,
the leader is car number 44,</i>

188
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,476
<i>Chuck Cranston!</i>

189
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,918
<i>Coming around the last turn
on the final lap...</i>

190
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,377
<i>We have a winner!</i>

191
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,047
<i>In the number 44 car,
it's Chuck Cranston</i>

192
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,258
<i>crossing the line first
for the chequered flag!</i>

193
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,135
<i>Let's hear it for Chuck!</i>

194
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,723
Yeah! He just won!

195
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,359
Yeah, baby!

196
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,029
<i>Today's late-model division
two-time champion, folks.</i>

197
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,866
<i>Give it up for Chuck Cranston!
Way to go, Chuck!</i>

198
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,328
Go up there, you get that flag and
get that cute ass out here right now!

199
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,746
Come on, now!

200
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,086
Hey, what are you doing?
Come back here with that!

201
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,131
- Ariel, what the hell are you doing?!
- Hammer down, baby!

202
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,845
Oh, yeah. Come on, now.

203
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,889
Chuck Cranston! I don't care if
your daddy does own this track,

204
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,225
you've got to get her out of here!

205
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,020
You can chase me down, old man.
Chase me down!

206
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,566
Get back here! You're going to
get yourself killed out there!

207
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,533
<i>Once again, ladies and gentlemen, your
late-model division two-time champion.</i>

208
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,994
<i>Let's give it up for Chuck Cranston!</i>

209
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,723
<i>Thanks for coming out to the
Cranston Motor Speedway.</i>

210
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,808
<i>- Rusty!
- We hope you had a good time.</i>

211
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,143
Rusty, I'm talking to you!

212
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,103
You know when you're watching
the news, and you see someone

213
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,439
- get killed doing something stupid?
- God, this again?

214
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,483
I don't want to be that stupid friend
who just stands around watching.

215
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,945
- He should never let you do that!
- So you're just going to leave me?

216
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,616
Me?

217
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,702
Leave you?

218
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,457
I don't know what's going on
with you any more.

219
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,377
Ever since Bobby...

220
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,215
- I guess I'll get my own ride back.
- I guess you will.

221
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,744
Yellow flag.

222
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,919
Baby, why we got to go so fast?

223
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,798
You want some choirboy
to put a promise ring on your finger?

224
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,841
You're not gonna find that with me,
preacher's daughter.

225
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,595
Stop. I get that from everybody else.
I don't need that from you.

226
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,598
I thought it was real simple
with you and me.

227
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,392
Yeah?

228
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,811
I'm your man.

229
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,605
You're... you're my rebel child.

230
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,567
I'm not a child.

231
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,118
Prove it.

232
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:39,380
Shut the door.

233
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,674
Go on.

234
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,522
Are you going to pout all day?

235
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,484
Look, I already said I was sorry.

236
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,739
It's Monday. Everybody gets a do-over.

237
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,909
- You love me!
- I know I do!

238
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,678
Isn't that that new kid
my mom introduced me to at church?

239
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,680
Sure is. He's cute.

240
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,684
- You think everybody's cute.
- I know, but I think he's cute.

241
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,940
He dressed up for his first day
of school. That's so cute!

242
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,359
Oh, my God, Rusty. Come on, let's go.

243
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,320
Did you see his tie?
I like it and I'm going to tell him.

244
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,698
- That's a nice tie.
- Rusty.

245
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,867
Hey, I mean it!
Don't let anyone tell you different.

246
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,160
Thanks, uh...

247
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,829
- Rusty.
- It's Ahriel, right?

248
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,542
It's Ariel.

249
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,046
- Ariel.
- Very good.

250
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,508
Hey. Watch where
you're going, little guy.

251
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,468
- Sorry, man. I didn't see you.
- It's like driving.

252
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,969
Stick with the
flow of traffic, numbnuts.

253
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,555
Maybe if you weren't wearing
all that camouflage, I could see you.

254
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,558
You should get one of them orange
vests so hunters don't shoot you.

255
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,936
An orange vest? I don't wear orange.

256
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,022
I'm not a Tennessee fan.
I'm a Georgia Bulldog.

257
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,566
Where you from? You talk funny.

258
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,029
I talk funny? I talk funny?
You should hear you from my end.

259
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,406
I'm from Boston.

260
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,117
Massachusetts?

261
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,746
- It's in the United States?
- Yeah, I read that somewhere.

262
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,291
What's up, man? I'm Willard.

263
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:52,216
- I'm Ren. MacCormack.
- Nice to meet you. Let me see this.

264
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,761
Literature and Composition.
That's this way. Follow me.

265
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,805
People give you shit
about that tie yet?

266
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:02,977
- Nah, but the dayjust started.
- First group, on your mark...

267
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,938
Keep that head down! Head down!

268
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,442
I'm gonna smoke your butt, man.

269
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,778
- You think so?
- I know so. Your butt's getting smoked.

270
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,743
Come on, Willard!

271
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,125
Go get your water.

272
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,711
Don't gulp it down!

273
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,629
Warm it up in your mouth.

274
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,798
Two swallows, hit them monkey bars.

275
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,677
- You're looking flushed, Willard.
- My cheeks are naturally ruddy, man.

276
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,055
Ren, this is Woody, our team captain.
You don't gotta salute him.

277
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,641
- What's up, man? Nice to meet you.
- How's it going?

278
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,270
Last year, varsity made it to regional.
They bussed us down to Alabama.

279
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,647
The excitement never stops.

280
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,234
- You haven't been overseas?
- I've been to Alabama, if that counts.

281
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,902
No. It doesn't.

282
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,530
I went to Russia two years ago
with my gymnastics team.

283
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,532
It's kind of a sister city
thing with Moscow.

284
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,161
Yeah, Russia... I don't know if I
dig that. It sounds kind of boring.

285
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,746
Do you know anything
about Russian girls?

286
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,999
I know they range from
bearded to drop-dead beautiful.

287
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,335
Yeah? Well, I can vouch
for the beautiful ones.

288
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,753
Two girls from the Russian team

289
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,380
snuck me out of my dorm room
late night. They didn't have beards.

290
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,175
- They were smoking.
- What were they smoking?

291
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,679
Oh, you mean, like, smokin' hot.
I'm sorry. Continue.

292
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,224
So we go to this club.
The music's banging. It's pitch black.

293
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:28,395
I couldn't see shit, just hot two girls
drenched in sweat all over me.

294
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,106
- We danced all night.
- Great. What'd you guys do after?

295
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,152
Oh, come on. Look, down in the South,
you can't start a story

296
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,279
about a threesome and not finish it.

297
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,032
Come on.

298
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,370
It goes without saying,
these girls are flexible.

299
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:48,207
They take me into a bathroom stall.
One shoves her tongue down my throat,

300
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,127
the other one's on top. This girl's
a champion pommel horse gymnast.

301
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:56,507
I'm talking killer
upper body strength. Banging.

302
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,467
She's scratching my back,
she's tearing my clothes off.

303
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,887
<i>And her friend's whispering
in my ear, "Hernnya".</i>

304
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,139
<i>- Her...
- Hernnya.</i>

305
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,016
<i>- Hernnya.
- Yeah.</i>

306
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:10,062
- What does that mean?
- It's Russian for "bullshit".

307
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,563
Why would she say that?

308
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,821
- 'Cause you're bullshitting me?
- Yup. Yeah.

309
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,989
But we did dance, man.

310
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,284
We danced our asses off.

311
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,164
That ain't right.

312
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,098
You ever work at a gin before?
You know about a bale press?

313
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,475
I don't know. I've never seen one.

314
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,729
- Where are you from?
- Boston, Mass.

315
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,148
Did they teach you
anything useful up north?

316
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,776
Just enough to get by. I'm hoping y'all
can teach me the three R's.

317
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,027
Three R's?

318
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,822
Yeah, you know...
reading, writing, redneckery.

319
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,119
People are giving you
a hard time, I can see that.

320
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,247
You're young, you're from out of town
and you're a smart aleck.

321
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,916
Can you start Thursday?

322
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,628
Yeah. Yes, sir!

323
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,466
I'll teach you to read and write,

324
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,302
but you're on your own
when it comes to redneckery.

325
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,642
Yeah. Give it a little bit of gas.

326
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,104
Yeah, that sounds good. Cut it.

327
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,276
What's the deal with the preacher's
daughter? She worth all that attitude?

328
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,570
I hear, back in the day,
she used to be a goody two-shoes.

329
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,199
Now she fronts like she some hellraiser.
Wearing her jeans tight and everything.

330
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,950
You could put a quarter
in that girl's back pocket

331
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,660
and tell if it's heads or tails.

332
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,704
Why? You're trying to knock boots
with her, aren't you?

333
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,372
- No.
- Yes, you are. He is.

334
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,501
I'm just curious. I ain't trying to
bang her or take her ballroom dancing.

335
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,462
Well, that'd be pretty hard,
being that that's against the law.

336
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,714
What? Banging a preacher's daughter?

337
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,716
No, public dancing's against the law
if you're under 18.

338
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,551
Shut up.

339
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,014
Wait, wait, wait. Jump back.

340
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,975
Are you kidding me?
Dancing is against the law?

341
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,353
Yeah, man. We got laws
up the poop chute around here.

342
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,941
I can't even bring a bandana to school,
because they think I'm in a gang.

343
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,401
If my face gets sweaty,
I gotta use the back of my hand.

344
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,655
Let me tell you something,
this country was built on bandanas.

345
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,699
So you're telling me Bomont High
doesn't have a prom.

346
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:31,495
Well, you know...
They got the Fall Ball, right?

347
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,081
OK. So, all the churches
get together and put it on.

348
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,875
The whole town shows up
and everybody's eyes are on you

349
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,670
to make sure you're dancing
at least six inches away from your girl.

350
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,672
You gotta add
another two inches for me.

351
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,260
And, for one song, they make you...
They make you dance with your mother.

352
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,345
I mean, talk about a boner killer.

353
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,640
And the schools don't wanna
have dances on their property.

354
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,060
They... They say they
don't want to be held liable.

355
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,979
They don't want to be held
liable for what?

356
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,773
Five seniors died in a car crash
coming home from a dance,

357
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,358
and that's when
the whole town went crazy.

358
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,195
They started blaming it on the liquor,
the music, the dancing.

359
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,448
After a while everybody
started thinking dancing was a sin.

360
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:12,244
But we're talking about the law, right?
Not heaven and hell?

361
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:16,957
Yeah, take that up with Reverend Moore.
I'm a machine, I'm a machine.

362
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,295
Hey, what's up, dude?

363
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, Woody, what's up, man?

364
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,427
Hey, how you doing?

365
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,387
- MacCormack.
- How you doing, buddy?

366
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,056
- Good, man. You hungry?
- Yeah. What's good here?

367
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,059
We got nachos, hot dogs, hamburgers.

368
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,895
Frito pie, all the way.

369
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,646
And if you're a real man?
You'll eat that jalapeño.

370
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,607
- Get your fingers out of my pie!
- What about that guy?

371
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,108
You don't know where his finger's been.

372
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,236
Woody! Check the door, man.
Cop still here?

373
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,700
Five-O getting his move on.

374
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,995
- What you got for me, Uncle Claude?
- David Banner.

375
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,290
Bootleg. Don't get too krunk out there.

376
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,501
First sign of the police,
I'm gonna pull the plug.

377
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,296
I don't wanna get a fine,
and you don't wanna get another ticket.

378
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,926
- Wait. You got a ticket for dancing?
- He got two tickets for dancing.

379
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,678
One more and he's off the team.

380
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,224
All right. Let's get
this party started! It's on!

381
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,895
- No cops. Let's get it, come on!
- Let's get it started!

382
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,397
Yo! It's showtime!

383
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,232
- It's clear!
- Let's go!

384
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,153
Back it up, back it up, move out.

385
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,995
Whoa.

386
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,599
- Woody!
- Woody!

387
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,148
Whoa!

388
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,776
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
That's a beautiful thing!

389
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,654
Does that turn you on?
Girls acting like hussies?

390
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,406
It don't suck.

391
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,907
Oh, now, come on.

392
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,162
Yeah, dude. They... they get into it.

393
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,209
Hey, you. Let's go.

394
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,836
Come on, let's dance.

395
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,682
- Come on!
- I'm good. I don't dance.

396
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,183
You go have fun.

397
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,567
Me and my boys are going
to push everybody back.

398
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,944
Let me see you do that city boy thing.

399
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,446
C'mon! Get it!

400
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,623
Oh, dang. Oh, dang.

401
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,099
Claude! Reverend Moore's
out front, man.

402
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,278
Oh, shit.

403
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,282
You want me to step in on this?

404
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,332
What, you can't keep up?

405
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,336
You can put on a show for that guy.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna.

406
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,008
<i>Attention, attention. Ariel Moore,</i>

407
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,761
<i>will you please come up
to the front of the diner.</i>

408
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,264
<i>Your daddy is here for you.</i>

409
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,226
She's busted!

410
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,902
Show's over.

411
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,627
You mother was afraid you didn't
have any money. She said you'd be here.

412
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,504
Daddy, it's not a big deal.
We were just messing around.

413
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,716
I think it would be best
if you came home with me.

414
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,719
Right now.

415
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,099
Daddy gonna
take her out to the woodshed.

416
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,101
What the hell does that mean?

417
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,270
It means she's in deep shit.

418
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,071
- Hey, honey. You're home early.
- Yeah.

419
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,615
Did you have fun?

420
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:47,746
- Just breaking the law, Momma.
- Ariel. We have not finished talking.

421
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,707
Ariel!

422
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:57,422
Why do you think you're above serving
your penalty in Saturday School?

423
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,217
I don't think I'm above anyone, sir.
I was just unaware that...

424
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,510
Hey, Eddie? Eddie?

425
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,680
He has a job on Saturdays
over at Andy's cotton gin.

426
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,807
Wes. Call me "Judge", would you?

427
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,853
- And take your hat off.
- OK, Judge Eddie.

428
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:16,066
Could you show a little mercy here?
He was playing his music too loud.

429
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,276
About as loud as you used to
play Lynyrd Skynyrd

430
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,112
in that old Impala
me and you used to roll in.

431
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,865
Remember that... Judge?

432
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,285
You'll have Andy verify his employment?

433
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,870
- Now hold on...
- Yes I will!

434
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,415
- Can I go back to the car lot now?
- Sentence suspended.

435
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,087
Oh, man. Son, you're lucky.

436
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,756
Not everyone's got this town
on lockdown like I do.

437
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,759
Oh, yeah? Since you and the judge
are so buddy-buddy,

438
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,971
maybe you can have him explain this
whole ban-on-dance thing to me.

439
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,473
Whatever happened to separation
of church and state?

440
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,767
What's church got to do with it?

441
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,687
It seems to have everything
to do with everything around here.

442
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,272
Let me ask you a question.

443
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,441
If there's a football game Sunday
and you want to buy a beer, can you?

444
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,987
- You can't buy beer on Sundays.
- And why not?

445
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,571
'Cause of church.

446
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:09,452
You can in Boston, why not in Bomont?

447
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:14,124
Look. Sunday is God's day.

448
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,585
If you want to drink beer on God's day,
you need to buy it on beer's day,

449
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,130
which is Saturday.

450
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,299
It's right there in the Bible,
if you don't believe me.

451
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,302
Separation of God and beer.

452
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:30,015
And if God said it, I believe it.
That settles it! Now shut up.

453
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,106
Hey, MacCormack.

454
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,906
Hey, what's up... Ariel?

455
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,994
Chuck Cranston wants to see you
at his daddy's racetrack tomorrow.

456
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:55,498
- Be there at two o'clock.
- OK. What happens at two o'clock?

457
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,127
- Show up and find out.
- And what if I don't?

458
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,840
- You're gonna miss all the fun.
- How come he sent you to tell me?

459
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,844
I volunteered.

460
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,935
If that shithog tries anything,
I'm gonna pound him.

461
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,313
- No fighting, Willard.
- No promises, Rusty.

462
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,733
You guys, keep the smoke away
from her now. Her daddy smells that,

463
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,778
- he'll never let her hang out again.
- High school field trip's here.

464
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,823
Twinkle toes.

465
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,910
Watching you the other night,
that was real entertaining.

466
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:36,956
We thought we'd invite you out here.
Maybe you could put on a show for us.

467
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,543
Chuck, didn't you hear?
He's real into gymnastics.

468
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,295
Gymnastics.

469
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,884
Well... I thought only fags
were into gymnastics.

470
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,054
I thought only assholes
still used the word "fag".

471
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,476
Touché.

472
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,895
Why don't you...

473
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,148
...try dancing with this?

474
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:43,314
Now... we race these buses
every weekend at the Derby Mash-up.

475
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:47,152
We race them in a figure eight,
just like this.

476
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:54,826
Two things you gotta worry about.
Your corners, and your intersection.

477
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,289
You fall behind, you're gonna
get hit by the leader.

478
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,959
You pull ahead, you just might
get slammed by the guy in last place.

479
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,754
What do you say, city boy?
Ready to race?

480
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,593
I drove one of these at a pep rally
one time... it ain't easy.

481
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,720
All right? If she flips over,
crawl out the side window.

482
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,473
If it catches on fire, jump out of it.

483
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,808
- Keep loose.
- Pump your brakes with your foot.

484
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,393
Pump the brakes. Tell him.

485
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,228
- I just told him.
- Cool. Pump them brakes.

486
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,689
- All right, man. Good luck.
- Whoa, whoa! Guys, guys.

487
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:28,234
This is pretty dangerous, right?
We could get killed?

488
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:35,074
We? What's this "we", white boy? Crazy.
We? Like I'd get my black ass up there.

489
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,035
What'd I get myself into?

490
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,500
How do, all you pissants? Welcome
to the Cranston Motor Speedway!

491
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,587
Whoa, baby! You OK?
You kinda had a lot to smoke.

492
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,506
Don't be tellin' me
when I've had enough.

493
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,133
Looks like a lovely day for a bus...

494
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,760
I didn't say you had enough.
I just said you had a lot.

495
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:59,265
If you want to lecture somebody,
go tell Sweet Buns to start his engine.

496
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:05,522
We got one practise lap
before the green flag drops, folks.

497
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:10,360
It's a three-lap race to the
finish line, or the last man standing.

498
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,489
Gentlemen, start your engines!

499
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,830
Let's go!

500
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:30,964
We've got home-grown hero
Chuck Cranston in Burn in Hell.

501
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,757
You're in my world now, boy!

502
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:37,887
On the outside, we've got the new kid
racing in the Fun Zone, Ren MacCormack.

503
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,430
Go, Fun Zone!

504
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:42,559
Caroline and Russell
are in the back of the pack, y'all.

505
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,602
Hey! Where's the green flag?

506
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,980
- Improvise.
- Now we're coming into turn four,

507
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,566
- getting ready for the green flag.
- Oh, yeah!

508
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,818
Preacher's daughter, my ass, baby!

509
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:57,657
Green flag, green flag,
green flag! And... Go!

510
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,660
Come on, Ren! Go!

511
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,829
- Go, Ren! C'mon!
- Let's go!

512
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,833
They're coming around turn number one.
Fun Zone is loose around the corner.

513
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,752
Hang in there! Hang in there!

514
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,718
Chuck Cranston takes the lead,
with Russell on his ass.

515
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,641
Caroline and MacCormack are door to
door, they're battling for third place!

516
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,603
You want a little smooch?

517
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,442
She is tearing him up!

518
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,278
Coming out of turn four.

519
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,406
Here they come,
headed straight for the intersection!

520
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,452
- Pump the brakes!
- Somebody better stop.

521
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,163
Somebody better do something!

522
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,040
- Watch out, baby!
- Shit!

523
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,090
- Caroline is into the wall!
- Sorry, girl.

524
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,177
Russell! You damn son of a bitch!

525
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,181
Russell and MacCormack
are duking it out for second place.

526
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,318
Shit!

527
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,447
We got fireworks! God bless America!

528
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,450
And I'm on fire.

529
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,870
Chuck Cranston holds the lead
with one lap to go!

530
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,205
Getting lonely up here!

531
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:31,334
Oh, we've got us a regular
Mexican standoff, folks.

532
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,461
Don't you play chicken with me, boy.

533
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,588
Who's gonna back down?
Who's gonna back down?

534
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,548
Somebody's got to back down.

535
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,717
- Oh, what the hell.
- No, no, no! Damn it!

536
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:46,057
Chuck is down!
MacCormack takes the lead!

537
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,685
Yeah!

538
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,144
Fire! He's on fire!

539
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,564
Damn it!

540
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,154
- I got no brakes!
- Run! Hurry!

541
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,115
We're coming for you, Ren! Hold on!

542
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,575
Oh, my God!

543
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,036
Hey man, did you know
your bus is on fire?

544
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,996
- Yeah, no shit!
- Stop this bus!

545
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,832
- Pump the brakes!
- The gas pedal is stuck!

546
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,000
- Do something!
- Abandon bus!

547
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,877
Abandon bus!
We need to get off this bus!

548
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,587
Ren, you gotta get off, man!

549
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,440
Yes, sir! Get some! Fire it up!

550
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,525
- You OK, baby?
- Oh, my God!

551
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,279
Get some!

552
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,868
That was awesome!
Let's do that again! Yes!

553
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,134
Hey, man. Chuck's pretty sore
about losing that race.

554
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:07,096
I mean, you blew up
the man's bus, dude.

555
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,436
Yeah... Bomont blows, dude.

556
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,480
I don't have to tell you, though, do I?

557
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,858
Yeah. I've been to Chicago. St. Louis.

558
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:23,154
Been up to some of them clubs
in New York City. I been around.

559
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,947
- Just like you, man.
- Oh, yeah?

560
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,407
Yeah.

561
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,959
Hey.

562
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,631
You get high?
'Cause I do... every damn day.

563
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,884
If you want, you and I
can go burn one right after school.

564
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,887
You know, city mouse, country mouse...

565
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,430
Blazing!

566
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,016
What makes you think
I'm anything like you?

567
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,643
Hold on a second.

568
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,565
This is what we call a take-homer.
You need anything else?

569
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,234
- I don't want this.
- It's cool. It's cool.

570
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,527
No, it's not cool. Take this...

571
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,737
We can go down to the
railroad tracks and chief one now.

572
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,614
- No, seriously, take this.
- Hey!

573
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,116
- What is that?
- What's what?

574
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,035
In your hand. Let me see it.

575
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,453
Young man. Hey!

576
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,873
Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop, stop!

577
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,750
Hey! Stop!

578
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:20,795
Open the door!

579
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,089
Open!

580
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:31,055
I will not tolerate it, Ren.
Not in my school.

581
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,723
So what have you gotta say for yourself?

582
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,726
What do I have to say? I was on
the gymnastics team for three years.

583
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,729
Got drug tested all the time.
If I smoked weed, I'd be off the team.

584
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,482
- He had a joint...
- You know what one looks like?

585
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,442
Were you going to smoke it or sell it?

586
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,280
Mr. Parker says you were with
Rich Sawyer when this went down.

587
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,949
- I don't even know that prick.
- Hey! Language.

588
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,742
Ren, level with me.

589
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,038
Was it Rich's joint? You can tell me.

590
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,334
I don't do drugs.

591
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,629
You can test me.
And when it comes out clean,

592
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:07,049
I want this guy investigated for
barging into the bathroom stall with me.

593
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,342
That's gross.

594
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:14,140
Well. Since we don't have the evidence,

595
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,684
I'm going to let you off
with a warning this time.

596
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,770
But Ren, listen to me,
you have to understand something.

597
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:24,025
You see, life is not some big party.

598
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:29,155
I don't care what the rap music
people say, marijuana is just wrong.

599
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,035
Son, listen to me.

600
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,582
Ren, I knew your momma.

601
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,500
That's right. I knew Sandy.

602
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,171
She had a wild spark, just like you.

603
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,674
Running off up north, trying to live
the high life might have been fun,

604
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,885
but it also led her into getting
into some kind of...

605
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:58,601
- ... unexpected trouble.
- Unexpected trouble.

606
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,105
I'm thinking when you say "unexpected
trouble", you're talking about me.

607
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,941
Right? Right?

608
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:09,278
Look, believe me, don't believe me.
Suspend me, arrest me. I don't care.

609
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,280
But you do me one favour, all right?

610
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:15,451
Never talk to me about my mother again.
You understand?

611
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,203
Hey!

612
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,165
Let him go.

613
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,418
Hey, MacCormack.

614
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,255
What's the rush?

615
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,717
Dude, you trying to
ignore me or something?

616
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,803
I'm doing the best that I can!

617
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,149
<i>Massachusetts, huh?</i>

618
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,609
You got that music's cranked
pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack.

619
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,903
"You got that music
cranked pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack. "

620
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,613
Yeah! No shit, Barney Fife!

621
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,741
Watch that attitude, son.

622
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,159
Try being a cop in Boston,
you huckleberry!

623
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,745
- I will not tolerate it, Ren.
- Shut up! I'm talking!

624
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:41,954
Not in my school.

625
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,081
Mr. Dunbar.
Mr. Douchebag! Mr. Dumb-Ass.

626
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,958
With your righteousness
and your little vest.

627
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,543
Stop trying to act like you know me!

628
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,171
Don't act like you know me. Don't try
and act like you know my mother!

629
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,214
You don't know the pain
she went through every day.

630
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,050
You don't know shit!
You don't know shit!

631
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,982
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

632
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,944
- Well, I thought I was alone.
- Not in this town, you're not.

633
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,946
There are eyes everywhere.

634
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,619
- So what was all that?
- What was all what?

635
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,787
All that.

636
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,667
I was just letting off some steam,
I'm sure you got your own wicked ways.

637
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,132
You think I'm a slut or something?

638
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,510
I think you've been kissed a lot.

639
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,599
- Where's lugnut?
- You mean Chuck?

640
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,186
He doesn't own me. I know
he acts like he does, but he doesn't.

641
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,776
You want to see something?

642
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,843
Everybody calls it the yearbook.

643
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,806
I don't know when it started,
maybe 10 years ago or so.

644
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,434
- What is all this?
- Some are songs. Lyrics.

645
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,645
Quotes from books.

646
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:41,068
Poems. Music we're not
supposed to listen to.

647
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:47,157
- What do people do? Just hang out?
- Yeah.

648
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,078
And other stuff.

649
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,669
You think I'm small town, huh?

650
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,132
I think Bomont is a small town.

651
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:08,220
You think?
Try living here your whole life.

652
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,473
But that's all gonna change.

653
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,101
I've applied to colleges.

654
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,439
Hell, I've applied to colleges
my daddy don't even know about.

655
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:22,693
Nobody wants to see Bomont
in their rear-view more than me.

656
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,998
You want to kiss me?

657
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,799
Someday.

658
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,264
What's this "someday" shit?

659
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:56,060
You want to drop down
and tumble right here? OK.

660
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,898
You know that sweat's gonna dry
and you're still gonna feel like shit.

661
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,234
That's for Chuck.

662
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,986
Not me.

663
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,082
Did you hear that?

664
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,422
Come on, hurry!

665
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,593
Where are you going?

666
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,057
Sometimes, after football games...

667
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:38,560
...we all come out here
and when the train passes,

668
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,313
we just make out like crazy.

669
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,940
Or...

670
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,527
...we just play chicken.

671
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,450
So, you're just going to let
the train hit you?

672
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,660
Maybe.

673
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,833
All right, stop fooling around.

674
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,632
OK, get off the track.

675
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,179
Ariel! Get off the track!

676
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,087
How can I impose a curfew on
the young people of my congregation

677
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,882
if I can't enforce it in my own home?

678
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,385
Have you been drinking?

679
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,762
I haven't been smoking,
drinking, dancing,

680
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,806
reading books I'm not supposed to.
I'm just late.

681
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,433
Who brought you home just now?

682
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,686
Ren MacCormack.

683
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,438
I don't want you to see that boy again.

684
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,398
- Why?
- Because I've heard he's trouble.

685
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:12,196
Trouble? Well, man born of woman
is of few days and full of trouble.

686
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,948
Job 14:1. You know, from the Bible?

687
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,160
Your behaviour
has been atrocious, young lady,

688
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,455
and it seems to have started
when Ren MacCormack came to town.

689
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,750
Trust me, Daddy.
Ren's the least of your worries.

690
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,849
Let's get some city life in you.

691
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:49,024
Good night! This place is gigantic!

692
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,276
Yeah. It's bigger than Bomont.

693
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,369
Hey. I'm gonna get something to drink.
You go out there and shake it.

694
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,578
- Let go!
- I wanna shake it with you.

695
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,956
- Dance with me.
- Nah, I'm good. I'll watch you guys.

696
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,874
- You do this to me every time.
- I'm fine. I'm gonna drink.

697
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,376
Go out there and dance. Have fun.

698
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,336
- Hey. Just go dance with her.
- Willard!

699
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,963
What's the matter with you, huh?

700
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,632
We drove two hours to get here. You're
just gonna stand around and mope?

701
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,969
I don't dance. All right? I don't dance.

702
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,894
I can't dance.

703
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,648
At all.

704
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,988
But it's country line dancing.
It's a white man's wet dream.

705
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,950
Come on.

706
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,828
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

707
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,706
- Excuse me, miss?
- Y'all need to learn some new moves?

708
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,668
Shit-howdy! You drop me at day care
while you go dance with them girls!

709
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,628
Just learn a box step or two
and meet us out there.

710
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,672
- I got faith in you.
- Yeah.

711
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,800
- Just fall on in.
- All right.

712
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,723
Maybe I should get my drink on first.

713
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,642
You got girls walking around
with Jäger shots between their boobies?

714
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,520
No sir, we don't have that here.

715
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,773
Well, you should.

716
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,860
One, two, three. Good, guys.

717
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,571
- One, two, three...
- Stupid.

718
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:22,135
- Come on, Willard! It's fun!
- I don't drink and dance.

719
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,096
So you're gonna stand around
like a dork the whole night?

720
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,473
I'd rather be a dork
than a dancing dork. Yeah.

721
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,687
Whoa.

722
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,107
Hey, I got hat hair. Come on.

723
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,410
Hey!

724
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,912
She likes to dance.

725
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,054
Yeah!

726
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,065
Hey, shitkicker,
that's my girl you're groping!

727
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,567
Willard, we're just dancing.

728
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,445
Why are you dancing with another man
when you're wearing my hat?

729
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,155
OK, that is disrespectful.

730
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,325
Look, nelly, why don't you go babysit
this girl's purse and fetch me a beer.

731
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,536
Got a better idea. Why don't I kick your
teeth in and grin while I'm doing it?

732
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,789
Willard, no fighting.
You don't even know this guy.

733
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,373
I'll tell you what.
If he can count this high,

734
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,752
I'll give you to the count of three
to get out of my face, man! One!

735
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,629
Willard!

736
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,382
Come on, darlin'. Party with
a real man and ditch this hayseed.

737
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,636
Animal!

738
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:38,605
- It just happened so fast...
- You got knocked out.

739
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:42,734
I just remember politely asking him,
"Hey, get off of my girl. "

740
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,280
This bridge gives me the creeps.

741
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,740
- Willard!
- Sorry.

742
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,993
- What?
- This is Crosby Bridge.

743
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,080
You know that photo in school?

744
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,124
The one with the teenagers
that all got killed.

745
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,586
This is where it happened.

746
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,297
My brother was driving them home.

747
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:07,551
They lost control
and they went head on into a truck.

748
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:12,889
They were seniors. Two of them were
all-state, Ronnie Jamison and...

749
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,475
And my brother. Bobby.

750
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,770
You would've liked him.

751
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,022
I looked up to him.

752
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,317
He was my hero.

753
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,783
But now every time I think about him,
I just think about this bridge.

754
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:46,006
Four doors, you got a Mazda,
a Nissan, a Cadillac.

755
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:49,175
Low mileage, really good shape.
Excuse me for one moment.

756
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:50,969
Hey, Reverend!

757
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:51,970
Good afternoon.

758
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,556
Hey, you need
your oil changed on that Crown Vic?

759
01:04:54,724 --> 01:05:00,061
No, Wes. I'm not here about my car.
I'm here about my daughter.

760
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,063
OK.

761
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:06,985
Charlie, I need you to show
Katelin the Cadillac, buddy.

762
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,695
- All right.
- All right?

763
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:13,491
- Right this way.
- You want to sit down?

764
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,287
Wes, I know your nephew is new in town.

765
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,873
Now I understand that
everybody needs a friend,

766
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:25,086
but I am not comfortable
with Ren pursuing Ariel.

767
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,048
Pursuing?

768
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:31,384
Yeah. You have two
little girls of your own,

769
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:36,640
and I think you should understand
where I'm coming from here, Wes.

770
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:41,478
- I mean, as a father.
- No, I don't believe that I do.

771
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:44,272
Why don't you tell me what
Ren did exactly?

772
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,694
Well, I hear he's been
having trouble at school.

773
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,404
Trouble with drugs.

774
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,282
Drugs.

775
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:58,578
Where'd you hear that?
From Roger? That guy's a bully.

776
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,748
And I'm not just saying that 'cause
he wants me to take down my sign.

777
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,292
It doesn't matter where I heard it, Wes.

778
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,545
I don't want that kind of
influence around my daughter.

779
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:10,674
Influence, huh?

780
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:16,805
Reverend, have you ever
seen anybody die from leukaemia?

781
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,475
It's slow and ugly,

782
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:25,063
and that boy had to watch his momma
go all the way through it. Alone.

783
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,900
His daddy was a deadbeat.
Never lifted a finger to help.

784
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:32,779
When she got sick, he bolted.
It was Ren who took care of her.

785
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:38,493
Now, you may think that Ren
isn't good enough for your daughter,

786
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:43,665
but, Reverend, I could argue
it's the other way around.

787
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,838
Well...

788
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,924
I just wanted to make myself clear.

789
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,763
See you in church.

790
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,434
I don't believe this town.

791
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,436
I bring Ariel home past her curfew,

792
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:07,022
and Reverend Moore is all up in
my uncle's grill, making threats.

793
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,816
Yeah. Well, you know what it is?
You got an attitude problem.

794
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:13,570
- I got an attitude problem?
- Yeah, you got an attitude problem.

795
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:15,572
Every chance you get,
you're bad-mouthing this town.

796
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,200
We're small-time, but we got satellites
and cell phones like everyone else.

797
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,078
- We're making some progress.
- Don't talk to me about progress.

798
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:25,457
I've been here two months and
haven't seen one wet T-shirt contest.

799
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,625
Oh, I know. I don't know
what's up with that.

800
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,211
- That's not me.
- Probably some stupid law against it.

801
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,464
I tell you what. You get
a petition for that, I'd sign it.

802
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:37,385
Because if we can't have braless,
wet women here in Bomont,

803
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:41,347
- the terrorists win.
- That's not a bad idea.

804
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:46,936
We could start our own petition.

805
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:49,314
Challenge the law
against public dancing.

806
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:52,108
Why not? Then we can just
organise our own dance.

807
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,903
I'm not talking about some
drunken kegger or free-for-all orgy.

808
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,988
That right there? That's an idea!

809
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,699
I'm talking about a formal,
respectable dance.

810
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,410
One that's not held in the church,
with everyone's eyes on you.

811
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,829
You could have it in the Bomont lockup.

812
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,290
'Cause what you're talking about
is against the law.

813
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:10,460
Let me tell you something about the law.
It's meant to be challenged.

814
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:14,422
- Nothing's set in stone.
- Ten Commandments were.

815
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,383
- What's your smart-aleck reply to that?
- My smart-aleck reply?

816
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,385
Hey! C'mon, man! Hey!

817
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:21,888
Stop! You want that wet T-shirt contest,
come and get it!

818
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,607
The price of a dog license
will go from 10 dollars to 15 dollars.

819
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:36,361
A licensed pet is a happy one.

820
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,572
All right. Well, theyjust finished.

821
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,866
If you was gonna make your move,
this is when you do it.

822
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:45,078
It is at this time we will take
any new business or concerns.

823
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:50,083
Come down to the podium,
state your name and address. Anyone?

824
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,836
This meeting is adjourned!

825
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,589
So anyway, Elinor was saying
we hadn't had you and Vi over

826
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,299
for Sunday brunch in quite a while.

827
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,426
- If you wanna get together...
- That'd be great.

828
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:04,097
Reverend Moore!
It's Ren MacCormack. Wesley's nephew?

829
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,849
Yes, Ren. I know who you are.

830
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:08,852
Yeah, well I figured you did.
Wes told me you two had a talk.

831
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,896
There was a conversation
between your uncle and myself,

832
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:15,900
but it wasn't meant for your ears.

833
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:19,612
There's a lot of that going on
in this town. It's like that saying.

834
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:24,993
- The one about children? How's it go?
- That they're better seen than heard?

835
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,538
Yeah. Well, I just wanted to
let you know I'm starting a petition

836
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:32,000
to challenge the ordinance
prohibiting public dancing.

837
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,962
I just wanted to make sure
my intentions were clear.

838
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,719
Well... Good day, Ren.

839
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:49,350
- Showdown with the preacher man!
- You got balls the size of coconuts.

840
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,102
Listen to me, you corn-fed hick.

841
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,897
If I got to stand up in front of
the city council and make my case,

842
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,481
y'all gonna learn how to dance.

843
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,651
You're not gonna tell anyone about this?

844
01:09:58,819 --> 01:09:59,861
No, I'm not gonna tell.

845
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,614
- I'm serious.
- I promise. Just follow the girls.

846
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,241
They know what they're doing,
and you don't.

847
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:09,621
- Woody, anyone on the football team?
- Nobody will know.

848
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:11,706
Everybody will know.

849
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,000
...three, four.
One, two, three, four.

850
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,837
Come on, man, you got to commit.

851
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,176
- Come on, commit to the move.
- Don't mess around. Focus.

852
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,303
- Just do it.
- Shake it.

853
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:28,348
There you go, there you go.

854
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:30,141
- Feel it.
- Show me what you got.

855
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,560
Good, good. More hips.

856
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,066
- Less hips. Less hips.
- A little less.

857
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:44,864
And we're jumping. And we're jumping.

858
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:49,953
Yeah!

859
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,459
He's getting it a little bit.

860
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,258
Jump, jump.

861
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,478
C'mon, just bounce, Willard.

862
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:19,190
Get gangsta with it. Just bounce.
Gangsters don't dance, we bounce.

863
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,651
Come on, Willard, get gangsta.

864
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:28,157
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

865
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:32,704
Hey! What's up, man?
You want some?! Come get some!

866
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,706
Hey, we were just dancing, man.

867
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,994
- Can I help you with something?
- You guys got city records down here?

868
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,121
Like local ordinances?
Anything like that?

869
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,497
What do you want with those?

870
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:21,502
I wanna read them. Isn't that what you
do in libraries other than get stoned?

871
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:33,681
Let's move that ball
down the field! Now!

872
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,975
Two! Forty-two!

873
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:39,520
Willard!
What the hell are you doing, boy?

874
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,565
Give me two laps right now.
You move it! Now!

875
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:06,172
Yeah! C'mon!

876
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,468
Go, Willard! Go, Willard!

877
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,512
Go, Willard! Go Willard!

878
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,824
Nice.

879
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,919
Hey. Was that a three-pointer or a two?

880
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,380
That was a no-pointer.

881
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:49,549
Getting names
on this petition is one thing,

882
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:52,093
but trying to write this speech...

883
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:53,928
I'm just having a hard time with it.

884
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:57,056
I saw you enlisted my daughters
in your campaign.

885
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,352
- I'm sorry about that.
- No. No need to apologise.

886
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,063
I think this family could use
a little activism.

887
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,692
What about Uncky Wes?
He seems a little worried.

888
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,694
Well...

889
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:15,575
Wesley, he is a car salesman trying to
sell cars in the middle of a recession.

890
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,827
So he's all about worry.

891
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,500
Why is this dance so important?

892
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:38,264
When my dad left...
I wasn't really surprised. You know?

893
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:41,184
I never really felt like
I could depend on the guy anyways.

894
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,937
It was just me and Mom, you know?

895
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:47,231
She was the strong one.

896
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:55,198
And then she got sick,
and it was my turn to be strong.

897
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:58,576
I thought if I worked really hard,
and listened to the doctors

898
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:02,079
and did everything they told me to do,
maybe we could turn it around.

899
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:04,290
Maybe she'd get better.

900
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,586
But she didn't.

901
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:12,715
All that hard work,
I couldn't change anything.

902
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:19,514
But with this...
I'm thinking I could do something.

903
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,516
I could do something
for myself this time,

904
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,643
and maybe have a shot
at making a change.

905
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:28,314
You know?
That's all I want... is a shot.

906
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:34,195
Otherwise, I'm just going to disappear,
like everyone else.

907
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:43,579
Can I see that petition, please?

908
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,343
You got my vote, Ren MacCormack.

909
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,015
Your momma would be proud.

910
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,126
Aren't you gonna say anything?

911
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,879
Well, you ain't telling me anything
I don't already know.

912
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,342
I got eyes and ears. Yeah.

913
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,762
Well, I thought
I should tell you myself.

914
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,394
Yeah.

915
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:55,026
First you're into racecar drivers,
now you're into dancing gymnasts?

916
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,403
You crack me up.

917
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:02,700
You know, I seen the way
you've been looking at him.

918
01:17:04,077 --> 01:17:07,955
Just waiting for the
right moment to dumb down,

919
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,333
and wrap those skinny little
legs around him.

920
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,921
I'm so sick of you
treating me like dirt!

921
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,469
Hey.

922
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,304
Is that what I've been doing?

923
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,931
Just treating you like another pit-row
hussy, we screw on the weekends?

924
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,850
I thought that's what you
came here to be.

925
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:29,602
You know what?

926
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:33,064
Being a preacher's daughter don't give
you a free pass on acting like a slut.

927
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,192
Ariel...

928
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:40,529
You walk your ass back home to Daddy!

929
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:45,618
I treated you decent!
Better than you deserve!

930
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,453
I don't need this shit.

931
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,748
I was about done with you anyway!

932
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,132
You son of a bitch!

933
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,469
Stop! Stop! What are...

934
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:05,304
Crazy bitch!

935
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,639
Don't touch me!

936
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,209
Vi's in there with her.

937
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:40,339
You're OK, baby.
Just don't worry, my angel.

938
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,887
That son of a bitch.

939
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,390
Careful, Daddy, you're in church.

940
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,101
Look at me. Look at me.

941
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,811
Look at me.

942
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,940
Did Ren MacCormack do this to you?

943
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,401
- Answer me!
- Let's keep calm.

944
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:04,405
- We don't even know what happened.
- Our daughter has been assaulted, Vi.

945
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:07,658
I'm calling the police.
I want him in handcuffs.

946
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,453
I can see how that works for you,
just blame everything on Ren.

947
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,288
Just like you blamed
everything on Bobby.

948
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:15,708
What?

949
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:19,044
Bobby spent his whole life
trying to make you proud.

950
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,547
He made good grades.

951
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,424
He went to church every Sunday,

952
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,010
and God help him
because he made one mistake?

953
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,512
Now nobody remembers
the good things about Bobby,

954
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,723
all they remember is that damn accident!

955
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:34,435
Why don't we have a school dance?
It's because of Bobby!

956
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,189
Why do we have this stupid curfew?
Because of Bobby!

957
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,483
Bobby's to blame for all this bullshit!

958
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,026
Lower your voice, talk in a civil tone.

959
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,904
- Let's not do this here.
- Why? Isn't this my church? Isn't it?!

960
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:47,656
Isn't this where we're supposed to
talk about our problems?

961
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:51,452
It's been three damn years,
so why don't we start talking?!

962
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:57,249
I have been so lost.

963
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,086
I've been losing my mind.

964
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:06,550
And you don't even see it!
You don't even care.

965
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,928
Of course I care.

966
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,224
Of course we care.

967
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,684
We don't expect you
to understand everything we do

968
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,269
that's intended to keep you safe.

969
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:19,772
Stop it! I hate it when you
treat me like I'm a child.

970
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,358
Well, whether you like it or not,
you are my child!

971
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,276
I'm not even a virgin!

972
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:29,782
Please...
Please don't talk like that in here.

973
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,618
What are you going to do?
Pass another law?

974
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,287
'Cause that sure as hell
didn't keep him out of my panties!

975
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:37,456
Shaw!

976
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,754
Well, let's go get that guy
that blackened my eye,

977
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,090
'cause we don't hit girls in Bomont,
do we Daddy?

978
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,341
Ariel, please.

979
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,177
- Please, I didn't mean to!
- No, you stay here.

980
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,221
You've done enough.

981
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:17,121
- Where is she?
- She's staying at Rusty's.

982
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:24,044
I don't know what came over me.
I've never hit anybody in my life...

983
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,714
That's where you two are alike.

984
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,342
You deal with your pain in extremes.

985
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,475
I understand what you were trying to do.

986
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:42,730
You were trying to hold this town
together and protect our children.

987
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:50,487
But these laws, they were
too much, too soon.

988
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,032
There were other kids
who lost their lives.

989
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:58,370
- I felt like I had an obligation to...
- Your obligation was to our daughter.

990
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:08,589
I have been a minister's wife
for 21 years now.

991
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,883
I have been supportive.

992
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,260
I've been silent.

993
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,433
I still think you are
a wonderful preacher.

994
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:25,564
But it is the one-on-one
where you could use a little work.

995
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:35,366
Your old man's wrong about a lot, but
tossing Chuck in jail sounds good to me.

996
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:40,245
I just want this whole thing behind me.

997
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:46,794
I got you something.

998
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:52,967
A Bible?

999
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:58,472
It's not just any Bible. It's mine.
I've had it since I was seven.

1000
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:05,771
I marked a few pages. Thought it might
help going up against the city council.

1001
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:10,818
This is great.

1002
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,570
Really.

1003
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,742
You said that
you might kiss me someday.

1004
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:23,330
I did.

1005
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:27,835
You think that someday could be today?

1006
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:34,109
Hey. What's your secret plan?
Get up there and boogie?

1007
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:36,278
Yeah, I wish it were that easy.

1008
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:40,365
This meeting will now come to order.
But, before we begin,

1009
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:45,662
I would like to remind all you kids that
we are conducting an official meeting.

1010
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:49,833
Official town business. That means
no disturbances will be tolerated.

1011
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:53,253
The floor is now open.

1012
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:01,512
My name is Ren MacCormack.

1013
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,932
And I want to move, on behalf of most
of the senior class of Bomont High,

1014
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,644
that the law against public dancing
within the town limits of Bomont

1015
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:11,355
- be abolished.
- Yeah!

1016
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,319
You will not be warned again.

1017
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:20,489
Roger, if I may address
Mr. MacCormack on this matter.

1018
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,324
Please do.

1019
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:27,037
Ren, besides the liquor, and the drugs

1020
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:30,916
and the lewd behaviour that
seems to always accompany

1021
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,877
these types of unsupervised events,
the thing that really

1022
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:37,339
distresses me the most,
more than any of that,

1023
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,759
is the spiritual corruption.

1024
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:44,221
These dances, this music,

1025
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:47,975
it does distort
young people's attitudes.

1026
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:53,147
You might find it funny,
but I firmly believe that

1027
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,774
dancing can be destructive.

1028
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:59,820
And celebrating certain types of music
can be destructive.

1029
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,823
And I think you're going to find that

1030
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:06,994
most of the people in this community
are going to agree with me.

1031
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:13,417
I believe a vote
is in order on this motion.

1032
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,044
- All those opposed, please...
- Excuse me.

1033
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:17,754
I still got something to say
on this issue...

1034
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:21,675
- I thought Ren had the floor here.
- This meeting will come to order.

1035
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:25,721
- That's not right!
- Mr. MacCormack.

1036
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:30,100
I have been more than patient
with your intrusions.

1037
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:34,188
I would like to remind you that we speak
for this town because we are from here.

1038
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:35,731
Excuse me, Mr. Dunbar.

1039
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:39,443
For you to come into this council
chamber and question our motives...

1040
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,695
Roger! Stop it!

1041
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:51,496
I think Mr. MacCormack
has a right to be heard.

1042
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:14,937
I wasn't here three years ago,
when tragedy struck this town.

1043
01:27:15,104 --> 01:27:18,023
And I know it's not my place to mourn
the lives that were lost

1044
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,692
because I didn't know them.

1045
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:24,655
But it doesn't mean that
I don't think about them every day.

1046
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:26,823
Like a lot of students at Bomont,

1047
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:30,035
I see those pictures
every day at school.

1048
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:33,705
And each time I see their faces,
I think of how precious life is

1049
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:36,458
and how quickly it can be taken from us.

1050
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:41,213
I know this firsthand...
in my own way.

1051
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:46,927
And three years ago,
nearly a dozen laws were introduced

1052
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:50,055
to this council in order to
protect the children of Bomont.

1053
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:56,144
And most of these laws, I can see, as
a parent, how they make sense to you.

1054
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:58,522
But my right to dance...

1055
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,984
...when I want, where I want,

1056
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:04,861
and how I want is a right
that you cannot take away.

1057
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:07,114
It is mine.

1058
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,574
See, we don't have that much time left.

1059
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:12,160
All us teenagers, pretty soon
we're gonna be just like you.

1060
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:15,706
We're gonna have jobs
and bills and families.

1061
01:28:15,873 --> 01:28:18,250
And we're gonna have to worry
about our own children

1062
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,294
because that is the job of a parent.

1063
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:23,463
To worry. I get that.

1064
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:27,634
But ours, as teenagers, is to live.

1065
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:31,138
To play our music way too loud
and to act like idiots.

1066
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:34,725
And to make mistakes.

1067
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:39,146
Aren't we told in Psalm 149...

1068
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,231
..."Praise the Lord.

1069
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:44,359
Sing unto the Lord a new song.

1070
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:46,737
And let them praise
His name in the dance. "

1071
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,073
Now if anybody else brought
their Bible, like I did,

1072
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:54,119
will you please turn it to the
Book of Samuel, 6:14.

1073
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:58,290
"David... David danced before the Lord

1074
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:03,295
with all his might, leaping
and dancing before the Lord. "

1075
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:07,424
Celebrating his love of God
and celebrating his love of life.

1076
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:10,552
With what? With dancing!

1077
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,971
That's all we're doing here.

1078
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:23,148
Ecclesiastes assures us, "There is a
time for each purpose under heaven.

1079
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,525
There's a time to weep.

1080
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:28,862
There's a time to mourn.

1081
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:34,284
And there is a time to dance. "

1082
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,211
And this is our time.

1083
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,881
There was once a time for that law,
but not any more.

1084
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,218
Thank you.

1085
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:05,649
Thanks, Chris.

1086
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,160
You know you was railroaded.

1087
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:21,289
Shaw Moore walked into that meeting
with those votes already in his pocket.

1088
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,542
You didn't have a prayer.

1089
01:30:23,709 --> 01:30:29,047
- So what happens now?
- Nothing. It's over.

1090
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:31,216
What if it's not?

1091
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:34,052
What if you had your dance in Bayson?

1092
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:37,764
The point was to have it in Bomont.
What's Bayson, like 30 miles away?

1093
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:41,685
No. You're standing in it. Come here.

1094
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,524
You see that water tower? That's in
Bomont. Everything east is in Bayson.

1095
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,109
That means the cotton gin.

1096
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:52,195
Now, I figure that if the
Bomont fire trucks can't come

1097
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:55,407
this far east, neither can
the long arm of the law.

1098
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,618
What about the long arm
of Reverend Moore?

1099
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:01,121
Well, try to convince him
it won't be a spiritual corruption.

1100
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,081
Maybe he'll think about it.

1101
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,172
And the disciples
came to Jesus and said,

1102
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:14,634
"Master, why is it that
we can't do such things?"

1103
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:20,599
And Jesus said,
"It's because you have little faith.

1104
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:23,602
If you even had the faith
of a tiny mustard seed,

1105
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:28,398
you can say to the tallest mountain,
'Move from here to there'

1106
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:33,612
and it will move.
For with faith, anything... "

1107
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:36,865
Who's there?

1108
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:40,702
It's me. It's Ren MacCormack.

1109
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,539
Ren.

1110
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:49,628
I thought you were someone else.

1111
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:55,133
My son used to sit there
when I would practise my sermons,

1112
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:59,471
- and I...
- Yeah, with me it's grocery stores.

1113
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:01,097
Excuse me?

1114
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:03,725
There's always so many mothers
at grocery stores.

1115
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:06,686
You get enough of them calling
after their kids and pretty soon,

1116
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,564
you know, one of them starts
to sound like your own mom.

1117
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:14,069
Sometimes I think I can really hear her.

1118
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,779
Sit down.

1119
01:32:17,823 --> 01:32:23,286
My boy, Bobby, was taken from us
so suddenly, and...

1120
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:26,164
I can't remember
the last thing I said to him.

1121
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,792
Well, it ain't so easy
with time, either.

1122
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:33,004
With my mother, I always thought
there'd be this day where we got to

1123
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:35,507
say our good-byes.

1124
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:40,845
But, you know, death...

1125
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:43,807
...death is on its own clock.

1126
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:48,311
Yes... it is.

1127
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:51,481
Look, I know you and the council
voted against us having this dance,

1128
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:54,526
but it's not gonna
stop it from happening.

1129
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:57,237
Andy Beamis gave us
permission to use his place.

1130
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,698
And with your permission...

1131
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:01,950
...sir.

1132
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:04,411
I would like to take Ariel to the dance.

1133
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:06,913
Now I promise you,

1134
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:10,333
I would never, ever do anything
to hurt her or disrespect her.

1135
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:12,794
And I sure as hell
won't let anybody else.

1136
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:17,465
I didn't mean to swear
in your church. I'm sorry.

1137
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:21,094
Wouldn't be the first time.

1138
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,055
The dance means a lot to me.
I mean, you know that.

1139
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:29,311
But your daughter... she means more.

1140
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:34,691
And if you don't let her go,
I'm not gonna go.

1141
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,737
I know you got to do what you got to do.

1142
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:44,743
Well, thank you for...

1143
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,873
Thank you.

1144
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:21,321
I'm standing before you today
with a troubled heart.

1145
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:26,826
I've insisted on taking
responsibility for your lives.

1146
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,871
But I'm really...

1147
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:34,834
...just like a first-time parent

1148
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:39,506
who makes mistakes,
and learns as he goes along.

1149
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:44,344
And, like that parent,

1150
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:48,306
I find myself at that moment
when I have to decide...

1151
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:55,397
...do I hold on
or do I trust you to yourselves?

1152
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:04,614
Do I let go and hope that
you've understood my lessons?

1153
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:10,495
If we don't start
trusting our children...

1154
01:35:11,163 --> 01:35:13,748
...how will they
ever become trustworthy?

1155
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:21,214
I'm told that the senior class
at Bomont High School

1156
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:26,219
has secured the use of a warehouse
in nearby Bayson for a senior dance.

1157
01:35:29,348 --> 01:35:32,392
Please join me
in keeping them in our prayers...

1158
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:36,563
...that our Lord will guide them
in their endeavours.

1159
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:42,235
Now, if you will turn to your hymnals...

1160
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:47,407
- ... page 472.
- See? Who said there's no miracles?

1161
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:50,285
"Just As I Am Thine Own To Be. "

1162
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,879
- Willard, look in there.
- What is this?

1163
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:53,473
- Grab hold.
- Grab hold. All right, let's lift!

1164
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:27,966
C'mon, c'mon...

1165
01:37:53,784 --> 01:37:55,368
You look stunning!

1166
01:37:55,536 --> 01:38:00,164
Really? Is it OK, though?
I mean, it's not too simple, right?

1167
01:38:00,332 --> 01:38:03,251
Oh, baby, simple elegance
is something to strive for.

1168
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:07,672
Well, you can't go to a prom
without a corsage.

1169
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,134
Oh, my gosh. Mom! It's beautiful.

1170
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:15,889
- You didn't have to do that.
- I didn't.

1171
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:28,443
No red boots?

1172
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:32,488
Not tonight.

1173
01:38:32,656 --> 01:38:35,575
- Can you help me pin this?
- Sure.

1174
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:40,538
It's not that kind of corsage.
It goes on your wrist.

1175
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:54,427
You have no idea how hard it is for me
to let you walk out that door.

1176
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:59,599
I just want what every parent wants.
I want my kids to come home safe.

1177
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:03,061
I know it's been hard on you.

1178
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:08,900
And I know I haven't made it any easier.

1179
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:21,287
I just don't want you to be
disappointed in me any more.

1180
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:26,751
No. You are my angel.

1181
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:31,422
And I will always love you.

1182
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:39,514
Hey, Daddy, guess what?

1183
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,227
We're dancing.

1184
01:39:56,907 --> 01:39:58,533
I was going to come up and...

1185
01:40:02,454 --> 01:40:05,373
What? What's the matter?

1186
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:08,334
You look beautiful.

1187
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,256
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1188
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,217
Come here.

1189
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,850
Shaw, come over here. You've got
to see them. They look wonderful!

1190
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:29,105
- They're gonna think that we're spying.
- We are spying. Come here!

1191
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:32,692
Let me get the door for you.

1192
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:38,656
Ren, it's OK.
I can go through your door.

1193
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,533
Hold on, I gotta kick it
from the other side.

1194
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:41,784
Ren, stop.

1195
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,163
Come here.

1196
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:51,586
- Won't you give me a hand?
- Yes.

1197
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,427
- You OK?
- I'm good.

1198
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:00,636
OK.

1199
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:03,389
That was smooth.

1200
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:07,518
Good job, Ariel.

1201
01:41:39,676 --> 01:41:41,135
Hey. C'mon.

1202
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:07,453
Hey, Woody. By the looks of it, I'd say
our offensive line has no backbone.

1203
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:10,748
You should move your team
down the field, captain. Come on.

1204
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:12,959
Come on.

1205
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:18,673
Huddle up. Come on.
Y'all see them women over there?

1206
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:22,009
They ain't looking for
a first down, or a touchdown.

1207
01:42:22,177 --> 01:42:25,930
They're looking for some men to
take charge and ask them to dance.

1208
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,933
Y'all gonna ride the bench
or are you gonna man up?

1209
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,519
Come on, now. Hands in.

1210
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:35,815
- Break!
- Straighten up, boy!

1211
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:24,405
- Here you go, my lady.
- Thank you.

1212
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:26,199
When you said you were
gonna wear a cowboy hat,

1213
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:27,700
I didn't know how I'd feel about it.

1214
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:29,785
Now that you've seen me in it,
what's the verdict?

1215
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:31,621
You're sexier than socks on a rooster.

1216
01:43:31,788 --> 01:43:33,706
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1217
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:36,209
I mean it, stud.

1218
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:37,710
Cute.

1219
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,549
Remember, you promised.

1220
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:46,260
No fighting.

1221
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:52,892
- Willard. Don't you look pretty.
- What can I do for you tonight, Chuck?

1222
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:55,686
We got some business to take care
of with our friend MacCormack.

1223
01:43:55,854 --> 01:43:57,605
Let's be cool,
no fights tonight, all right?

1224
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:59,857
I get it. No fighting.

1225
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:04,028
Willard! Are you OK? Let go of me!

1226
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:05,780
Shut him up.

1227
01:44:07,449 --> 01:44:09,325
- MacCormack! Get on out here, boy!
- Willard!

1228
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:11,244
What do you want me to do?
They started this!

1229
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:13,162
Then kill the sons of bitches!

1230
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:20,670
Russell, handle that now! Come on!

1231
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:22,004
Hey, Chuck!

1232
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:27,134
Hey, Yankee Doodle. Why don't you
come on down and get your ass kicked.

1233
01:44:27,302 --> 01:44:29,011
You're real tough when it's four to one.

1234
01:44:31,723 --> 01:44:34,809
Rusty! Get your hands off of her!

1235
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:42,024
You freak, don't you
ever touch her like that! Ever!

1236
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:47,780
You like that?

1237
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:51,784
You want some more!

1238
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:54,787
Yeah! Go, Dogs!

1239
01:44:55,622 --> 01:44:57,081
You want to take me?

1240
01:45:01,044 --> 01:45:02,628
Yeah, run away like a little bitch!

1241
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:05,006
You wanna dance, boy?

1242
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:14,849
The race is over, Chuck.

1243
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:22,773
- Ren, Ren, watch out!
- Play fair, punk!

1244
01:45:27,362 --> 01:45:28,571
Thanks to Mr. Beamis.

1245
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:31,157
How about a little less boxing
and a little more boogie?

1246
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:34,201
- It feels like a morgue in there!
- I'm on it.

1247
01:45:34,369 --> 01:45:36,329
- You OK?
- Yeah. Are you OK?

1248
01:45:36,496 --> 01:45:39,248
Yeah. My little brawler.
You look beautiful, come on!

1249
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:41,208
Thank you. I kicked his ass!

1250
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:45,004
Hey! I thought this was a party!

1251
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:49,175
Let's dance!

1252
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:12,698
- I need you to hold myjacket.
- What are you doing?

1253
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:13,908
Back up, sweetheart.

1254
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,826
I don't know how big
this is going to get.

1255
01:53:20,418 --> 01:53:21,418
