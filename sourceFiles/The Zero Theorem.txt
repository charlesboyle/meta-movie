1
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,660
Hello? Hello?

2
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,476
Hello?

3
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,493
Another day.

4
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,121
Another day.

5
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,773
Go away.

6
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,282
Go away.

7
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,629
When I say stop,
you have to... Morning.

8
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,254
Have a nice day.

9
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,926
Good morning, madam.

10
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,927
We at Euphoria Finance want to
put the "you" back into euphoria.

11
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,099
Your lifestyle is our concern.

12
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,177
Your dreams are our dreams.

13
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,515
That's why we say,
"Enough is never enough."

14
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,816
Call us today and ask for more.

15
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,145
Good morning, madam.
We at Euphoria...

16
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,690
Everyone's getting
rich, except you.

17
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,493
Learn the secrets of their
success tonight at 8 on DuMBC.

18
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,322
Bored with Buddhism,
sick of Scientology?

19
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,579
Then the Church of Batman the
Redeemer may be the answer.

20
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,286
The future has come and gone.

21
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,836
Where were you?

22
00:04:55,837 --> 00:05:00,257
Don't miss out the next
time. Call 897-3434.

23
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,436
Occupy Mall Street now.

24
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,488
Autumn sales have
started. Bargains galore.

25
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,659
Up to 100 percent
off selected items.

26
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,659
Autumn sales have
started. Bargains galore.

27
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,537
Up to 100 percent
off selected items.

28
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,543
24 hours a day at BabyC.

29
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,042
We've cut out all the bad news.

30
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:45,091
We live in a chaotic,
confusing world.

31
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,550
So many choices, so little time.

32
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,725
What do we need?

33
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,599
Who do with love?

34
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,647
What brings us joy?

35
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,987
Mancom, making sense of
the good things in life.

36
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,951
Ahem. I hope you enjoyed
our presentation.

37
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,575
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

38
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,373
Now, if you'll please follow me.

39
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,498
Please stay together. Here's
your chance to observe

40
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,832
Mancom's proprietary Q-void
computation system in action.

41
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,463
No photos, please. Thank you.

42
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,216
We call it the power of six.

43
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,388
Six degrees of convergence,

44
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,767
providing stability for
business or personal needs.

45
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,847
As you can see, our company
encourages an atmosphere

46
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,559
of vigorous but
healthy competition.

47
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,724
Hello, Qohen Leth. Corporate
Health Maintenance

48
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,897
have approved review of your
disability request for today at 14:40.

49
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,519
Please be prompt.

50
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,567
We're nothing if not prompt.

51
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,290
All right, Quinn.

52
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,920
How's it hanging?

53
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,298
It's Qohen, Mr. Joby.

54
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,006
And as we've told you before,
it isn't hanging well. We're dying.

55
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,514
You should see the medics about
that. Can't afford to lose you.

56
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,892
- We have an appointment this afternoon.
- Not this afternoon.

57
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,437
- You approved it.
- Cancel.

58
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:04,563
You got still the Transfinite
Paradox project due today.

59
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,861
Finished.

60
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,108
Pathologics division's running
the standard redundancies.

61
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,076
You do all that this morning?

62
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,079
As mentioned to you repeatedly,
we detest working here.

63
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,329
Considering our output, we
can't begin to understand

64
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,254
- why you insist on our coming here.
- That's a Management issue.

65
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:29,506
- It's Qohen. Q, no U, O-H-E-N.
- Out of my hands.

66
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,512
Then perhaps we should be
talking to Management.

67
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,682
No, no, no. Nobody
speaks to Management.

68
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,012
You know that. No way, no way.
Look, take my advice.

69
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,769
Knock off the bitching and
moaning. It's not bad.

70
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,733
We could accept braving
this ghastly place

71
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,936
were it not for fear
of missing our call.

72
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,650
Oh, that call, yeah. Could you not let
the machine take it or call forwarding?

73
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,828
I could always bend the rules
on personal calls in your case.

74
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,115
We have to be home to receive it.

75
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,246
Look, I'll see what I
can do, all right?

76
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,750
Sorry.

77
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,425
- We prefer not to be touched.
- All right.

78
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:17,174
Qohen Leth, ontological
research division,

79
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,476
requesting disability leave.

80
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,805
Or reassignment to work at home.

81
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,014
That's Management's
decision, Mr. Leth.

82
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,192
We only deal with
health issues here.

83
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,111
What seems to be the problem?

84
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,531
- We are dying.
- Who's we?

85
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,366
Us. Ourselves.

86
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,703
- But there's only one of you.
- So it would appear.

87
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:45,873
This subject has undergone
five physicals the last year.

88
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,170
He's healthy as a horse.

89
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,090
- My hair has fallen out.
- Perfectly normal.

90
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,087
You're the most productive
number cruncher in your unit.

91
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,180
Entity crunchers.

92
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:03,387
We work with esoteric data
that have a life on their own

93
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,689
and are substantially more
complex than numbers.

94
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,609
In the experience of this board, dying
people are rarely so productive.

95
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,985
- Nevertheless, we're dying.
- No, we're not.

96
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,236
Yes, we are.

97
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,943
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

98
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,494
- We're not.
- Yes, we are.

99
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,992
- Not. Not. Not.
- Bus, bus.

100
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,493
May the party-party bug.

101
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,166
I'll do this one.

102
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,587
You're not dying.

103
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,213
Although, in a way,

104
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,046
from the moment of birth,
we all begin to die.

105
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,928
Call it divinely
planned obsolescence.

106
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,893
Soon or late, beggar or king,
death is the end of all things.

107
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,098
Why, life might be seen as a virus

108
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,684
infecting the perfect
organism of death.

109
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,986
That's enough, doctor.

110
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,404
It's true.

111
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,609
Disability request denied.
It's back to work for you.

112
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:03,660
However, this board recommends
further psychiatric evaluation.

113
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,248
I haven't time for more therapists.

114
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,919
I hope you'll have time for this.

115
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,799
Did you hear about
tonight? Changed.

116
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,048
- It's not 8, it's 7:30, right?
- Okay.

117
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,428
I'm going as a tiger.

118
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:25,268
All right, Quinn. I told you, the
medics wouldn't help. Leave it.

119
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,139
It's all right. Joby's on
the job. Problem solved.

120
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,103
- You're sending us home?
- One thing at a time.

121
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,687
I can get Management to see you.
He's coming to my party tonight.

122
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,277
- Party?
- I'll just give you the address.

123
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,904
You turn up and I'll do the rest.

124
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,326
We're afraid we can't.

125
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,779
What, staying in and
washing your hair?

126
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,410
We have to stay home,
wait for our call.

127
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,960
Look, do you want my help or not?

128
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,296
We fear parties.

129
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,549
Never quite know where to stand.

130
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,260
You kill me, you lunatic. You
don't know where to stand?

131
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,512
You gotta love it.

132
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,636
I'll see you tonight, Quinn.

133
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,597
It's Qohen.

134
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,591
Hey! Quinn!

135
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,303
That's the wrong way.
This way. This way.

136
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,553
Party. Party. Come in. Come in.

137
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,219
Yeah.

138
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,897
This is the main room,
everything's free in there.

139
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,692
Hello, Barbara. How you
doing, darling? All right?

140
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,736
You... She can't...

141
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,570
You see what this is?

142
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,739
You see this? Know what it is?

143
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,659
That's marble. It's real marble.

144
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,577
This place is covered in it.
It's my uncle's.

145
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:12,534
It was my uncle's. He lost everything
in the Sit On My Facebook crash.

146
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,790
The removal men are coming tomorrow

147
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,837
but tonight, it's ours,

148
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:22,386
so you party. Heh. Whoo!

149
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,887
- Is Management here?
- Mm! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

150
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,887
Keep it down. You don't wanna
start a rumour, right?

151
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,014
- Where's Management?
- Shh.

152
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,891
When he gets here,
I'll let you know.

153
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,147
In the meantime, lighten up.
Have some fun for a change.

154
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,980
And mingle, Quinn.
Mingle, all right?

155
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,655
It's Qohen.

156
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,529
Yeah, yeah, of course.

157
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,958
Hi.

158
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,130
I love the look.

159
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,210
Final evolution or re-product?

160
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,172
Maximum brain, minimalist body.

161
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,841
Excuse us.

162
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,694
Sit.

163
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,658
Now, what seems to be the problem?

164
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,995
We simply want to go home.

165
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,828
Home?

166
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,044
We can tell that you are a
man who values his solitude,

167
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,421
and we too are better
off left alone.

168
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,301
We fail to see the logic
in wasting time commuting

169
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,223
to a cubicle where we
work independently

170
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,803
amid other workers
similarly cubicled.

171
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,437
We could easily double
the output there

172
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,143
at home.

173
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,694
And our chief concern is
that we might miss our call.

174
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:53,493
You see, we've been waiting
for a call all our life now.

175
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,073
And, well, we've...

176
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,455
The nature or the origin of our
call remains a mystery to us.

177
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,788
We can't help but hope

178
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:07,171
that it will provide us with a
purpose we've long lived without.

179
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,723
You're quite insane, Mr. Leth.

180
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,356
We're sorry to have disturbed you.

181
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,109
- Drink?
- No.

182
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,692
Drink?

183
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,287
Oh! Whoa, Quinn, you
chrome dome bastard.

184
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,830
Where are you sneaking off?
Sneaky, sneaky.

185
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,080
- Give me that coat.
- We've seen him.

186
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,503
- Who?
- Management.

187
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,374
Would you stop? Management
parties incognito.

188
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,335
- No, this isn't what he...
- You're blowing his cover.

189
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,217
We really must go home now.

190
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,597
No. Look, I'll sort something out. I'll
get you a proper meeting with him.

191
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,553
There's no way you're going
without something to eat.

192
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,808
It's Qohen.

193
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,562
- We've had, apparently, our meeting.
- Just one.

194
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,020
Our diet dictates against any
foods with perceptible flavour.

195
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,278
All right, all right, all right.
Eat, eat, eat. That's an order.

196
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,073
Plenty of eats.

197
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,122
Plenty more.

198
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,076
Plenty for everybody.

199
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,042
- All right.
- Hey. Hold. Hold it. Yeah.

200
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,046
What is the meaning
of life, Mr. Leth?

201
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,766
Ah. So close to its end
and still no answers.

202
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,641
I have a special project for you that
could prove to be mutually beneficial.

203
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:52,063
There's not a lot of time,
not much time at all.

204
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,848
Whoo!

205
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,145
Okay.

206
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,948
You alive in there?

207
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,496
Whoo. Are you okay?

208
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,201
Yeah?

209
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,712
Yeah.

210
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,963
Excuse us.

211
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,679
- Care to join me?
- Excuse us?

212
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,851
I won't be long.

213
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,292
So I saved your life.

214
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,089
So what?

215
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,843
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

216
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,012
I'm Bainsley.

217
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,341
And you are?

218
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,518
Qohen. Q, no U.

219
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,562
And you work with these people?

220
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:51,265
In a manner of speaking, yeah.

221
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:56,069
- What do you do?
- Us? We crunch entities.

222
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,365
- You got a mouse in your pocket? Heh.
- Excuse us?

223
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,192
But who's "we"?

224
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,152
Us. Ourselves.

225
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,034
Oh, catchy.

226
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,536
Hey, help!

227
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,911
You're staring at me.

228
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,463
You think my dress
is incredibly ugly?

229
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,885
Well, it's my daddy's fault.

230
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:25,466
He used to buy me these incredibly
ugly clothes to keep the boys away.

231
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,016
It didn't work.

232
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,561
Only made me wanna get naked.

233
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,103
And that's no way to
keep the boys away.

234
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,559
Excuse us.

235
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,735
We really must leave now.

236
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,278
No, wait.

237
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,152
Just wait.

238
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,528
Wait.

239
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,795
Did anybody ever tell you,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

240
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,716
- Excuse us? What's all this about?
- You're going home.

241
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,810
Zero theorem.

242
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,729
All very hush-hush.

243
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,523
Management's been handpicking
talent since before I was hired.

244
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:19,399
Nobody lasts. It's a
guaranteed burnout project.

245
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,527
I worked at it for about three
weeks when I was young.

246
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,948
Drove me balmy.

247
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,527
After Zip-T, I couldn't
crunch Coco Pops.

248
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,952
That's why Management
made me a supervisor.

249
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:33,409
You might've noticed I'm a few raisins
short of a full scoop. Ha-ha.

250
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,128
That's why he chose
you, I think. Ooh.

251
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,422
Nothing left to lose. The tech boys
should be around at your place now,

252
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:44,629
changing the locks, setting up the
standard at-home work force security.

253
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,306
I've got my money on you, Quinn.

254
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,850
You'll be proving that
theorem in no time.

255
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,813
- What exactly will we be proving?
- That Management's getting desperate.

256
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,527
Have you ever wondered where all
the stuff you crunch winds up?

257
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,987
Voilà.

258
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,497
Here. Put this on.

259
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,506
Come.

260
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,094
Neural Net Mancrive.

261
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,303
The centre of Management's
entire operation.

262
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,309
Smart as shit and still learning.

263
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,108
Now, be very, very quiet.

264
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,903
We're hunting entities.

265
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,575
Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

266
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,028
Today's the same, Bob.

267
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:54,490
Don't mind me, Bob, I'm just getting
Quinn started on the old Zipster.

268
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,877
That's a waste of time, Bob.

269
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,920
I give him two weeks.

270
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,749
That's Bob, summer intern.

271
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,879
- Why does he call you Bob?
- Oh, Bob calls everybody Bob.

272
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,054
He says it's a waste of brain
cells remembering names.

273
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,473
- He's a hardware specialist.
- Isn't he rather young for that?

274
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:16,519
No, that kid could programme
before he could walk.

275
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,075
Right. Now, here's your software.

276
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,745
Management will send you new
data downloads every week.

277
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,324
How long is this
project going to take?

278
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,536
Don't know. It could take forever.

279
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,047
When I was a little tyke, everybody
thought neutrinos had no mass.

280
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,215
Somebody discovered
they do have mass.

281
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:50,466
Tiny little bit of mass,
but mass is mass, right?

282
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,924
It's got to add up to something.

283
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,268
That stuff used to keep me awake
at night. Not that you should worry.

284
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:01,519
Everything's under control. You
got everything you wanted.

285
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,985
Ever get a feeling the world's
giggling behind your back?

286
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,687
Everybody in the universe

287
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,322
is in on some cosmic joke.
Everybody but you.

288
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,616
The only reason you're not
laughing is you're the punchline.

289
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,284
- You ever get that feeling, Quinn?
- It's Qohen.

290
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:16,454
Working hard, Bob,
or hardly working?

291
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,623
Well, it pays the same, Bob.

292
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,792
Pays the same.

293
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:32,839
Zero currently equals
93. 78926 percent.

294
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,971
Zero must equal 100 percent.

295
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,935
Your first instalment of processed
data is due for upload in four hours.

296
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,766
Good luck.

297
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,640
Yeah.

298
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,065
Hmm.

299
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,593
Yeah.

300
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,799
Hello, Qohen Leth.

301
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,807
Your next instalment of processed
data is due for upload in one hour.

302
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,528
Enter number of minutes
needed for target overrun.

303
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,309
Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.

304
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:55,068
Zero currently equals
93. 789 percent.

305
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,822
Zero must equal 100 percent.

306
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,583
- Yeah?
- Hello, Qohen Leth.

307
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:12,585
Your next instalment of processed
data is due for upload in one hour.

308
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,338
If the target timetable
is attainable, press one.

309
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,170
If not, enter what is
needed for target overrun.

310
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,552
Your next instalment of
processed data is...

311
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,273
Zero must equal 100 percent.

312
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,911
Zero must equal 100 percent.

313
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,949
Zero must equal 100 percent.

314
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,212
You seem tense, Qohen.

315
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,009
Let's return to the
subject of your fears.

316
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:07,471
In past sessions, you have reported
a fear of death, a fear of life,

317
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,850
a fear of open spaces,
closed places,

318
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,397
a fear of people,
a fear of being alone,

319
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,601
- a fear of missing certain...
- No.

320
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,565
We fear a great many things,
but we fear nothing most of all.

321
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,073
- Please go on.
- In what manner?

322
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,035
- Are you trying to be difficult?
- Not at all.

323
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,957
It seems we're capable of being
difficult without trying.

324
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,747
We've spoken about your fears.

325
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,419
Let's speak about your joys.

326
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,500
At present, there's very little we
can think of that brings us joy.

327
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,677
What brought you joy in the past?

328
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:46,638
- We recall enjoying food once.
- What was your favourite food?

329
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,052
That, we can't recall.

330
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:53,816
At present, we feel no joy.

331
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,731
What do you feel?

332
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,608
Nothing.

333
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,525
You're a tough nut to crack, Qohen.

334
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,986
And, of course, I don't mean
"nut" in the pejorative sense.

335
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,372
Let's examine...

336
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,290
Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.

337
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:18,458
Your next instalment of processed
data is due for upload in one hour.

338
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,007
- What?
- If target timetable is attainable,

339
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,677
press one. If not, ent...

340
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:27,217
Please enter number of minutes
needed for target overruns.

341
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:30,303
One moment, please.
Management have authorised

342
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,433
- a 60-minute overrun.
- No, that...

343
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,935
- Goodbye, Mr. Leth.
- That's nothing... No.

344
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,316
We can finish this session
another time, Qohen.

345
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:42,193
- I think you'd better get back to work.
- These entities refuse

346
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,569
to remain crunched.

347
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,151
Each has its own meaning,
but that changes

348
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,407
- depending on the following.
- Qohen.

349
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,453
- Which then changes
- Deep breath.

350
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:54,159
- depending on the meaning of...
- Deep breath in and out.

351
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,377
Deep breath in...

352
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,922
- and out.
- All we want is our call.

353
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes, your call.

354
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,678
We'll complete this
session another time.

355
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,184
Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.

356
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,857
Your next instalment of
processed data is due...

357
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,650
Hello, Qohen Leth.
This is a courtesy call.

358
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:24,607
Your next instalment of processed
data is due for upload in one hour.

359
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,361
Hello, Qohen Leth.

360
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,365
Are you an entity process?

361
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,117
Have you tried them?

362
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,457
You should try herbs.

363
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,625
I'm happy with herbs.

364
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,919
Way happy.

365
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,294
They should put them in the
drinking water. Ha-ha-ha.

366
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,048
Black fluoride. Ha-ha-ha.

367
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,719
Are you here alone?

368
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,054
We are generally everywhere alone.

369
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,304
I love mystery.

370
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,773
Turns me on.

371
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,810
Well, you don't know me
and I don't know you.

372
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,065
No.

373
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,238
- I'm the neighbour.
- Mm-hm.

374
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,201
There's always a neighbour
at this kind of party.

375
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,412
Care to come to my place?

376
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:18,835
We'd only disappoint you as
we have countless others.

377
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,248
That's the best line
I've heard all night.

378
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,508
- Thank you.
- Mm.

379
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,426
We must leave now.

380
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,049
Hey, wait.

381
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,052
Wait.

382
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,434
Don't say no.

383
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,974
Just think about it.

384
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:42,022
If it's not now, some other time.

385
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,196
Just have to call me.

386
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,617
Goodbye, Mr. Leth. Goodbye,
Mr. Leth. Goodbye, Mr. Leth.

387
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,115
Oh!

388
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:09,883
Next instalment of processed data
is due for upload in one hour.

389
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,635
If the target timetable
is attainable, press one.

390
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,342
If not, enter what is
needed for target overrun.

391
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,895
Please enter the number of minutes
needed for target overrun.

392
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,268
Zero must equal 100 percent.

393
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,526
Zero must equal 100 percent.

394
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,655
Go like this.

395
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:42,540
Ha-ha-ha. Sideways
walks the crab, and...

396
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,253
Ha-ha-ha, oh!

397
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,349
No. No.

398
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,856
Come on.

399
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,825
Yeah.

400
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,365
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

401
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,367
No, no, no!

402
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,204
- What? Not now.
- Processed data is due for upload.

403
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:25,627
Please enter number of minutes
needed for target overrun.

That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.

405
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,011
- Please enter the estimated number.
- Shut up. Shut up.

406
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,721
That timetable is not authorised.

407
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,926
- Please enter the estimated number.
- I'm gonna catch them.

408

That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.

409
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:48,019
That timetable is not authorised.
Please enter the estimated number.

410
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,274
- No.
- Deep breaths, Qohen.

411
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,559
- Not you. No, we won't breathe!
- Deep breaths, remember?

412
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,825
And you too!

413
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,154
No!

414
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,938
Hello?

415
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,813
Management says
you've got a problem.

416
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,761
Quinn, you tortured little slut,
that is. Been a long time.

417
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,760
How are you? Still dying, I see.

418
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,932
- What are you doing here?
- Field work.

419
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,933
I love it. Gets me out of the office
into a snappy uniform. Ha, ha.

420
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,356
You could use a
woman's touch, Quinn.

421
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,527
Eh...

422
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,196
Ah. Management can't
get through to you.

423
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,572
What's the story?

424
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:25,286
At present, we have difficulty
maintaining our upload schedule.

425
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,790
The entities are
behaving very strangely.

426
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,370
Yeah.

427
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,295
Personnel meltdown.
I've seen plenty of it.

428
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,717
I'd pull you off the pitch

429
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,592
but Management wants to
give you another chance.

430
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,514
Don't ask me why.

431
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,800
Ooh.

432
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,390
Phone trouble, was it?

433
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,222
Tried to fix it yourself, did you?

434
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,066
Wrong tool for the job.

435
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,692
Ball-peen's more for hammering
out dents in sheet metal,

436
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,448
not for close tolerance
phone repair.

437
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,324
It's all about connections, Quinn.

438
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:16,126
Wires, wireless, weaving
a World Wide Web.

439
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,256
Can't get anything if
you're disconnected.

440
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,173
Voilà.

441
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,260
Tell you what, this manual
work's giving me a thirst.

442
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,062
You've not got a beer for
a working man, have you?

443
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,389
We have tap water.

444
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,100
Yum-yum.

445
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,360
Thank you.

446
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,740
I miss you, Quinn.

447
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,123
Supervisors don't
make many friends.

448
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,666
- You consider us a friend?
- Yeah, of course I do.

449
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,085
Of course I do.

450
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,388
So, what's the real problem?

451
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,890
The zero theorem is unproveable.

452
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,515
We still haven't
received our phone call.

453
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,725
You don't trust Management.

454
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,311
Nothing adds up.

455
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,398
No, you got it backwards. Everything
adds up to nothing, that's the point.

456
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,655
- What's the point?
- Exactly. What's the point of anything?

457
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,077
You've got a case of the
zero theorem heebie-jeebies.

458
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:30,953
Don't you think working
sucked the soul out of me?

459
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,752
Bet your big bald buns, it did.
I was nowhere near where you are.

460
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,628
You're knocking on the door, Quinn.
No wonder you're stressed.

461
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,424
Sit down.

462
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,218
Sit down.

463
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,515
Do you really have no
idea what you're doing?

464
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,894
We don't care. All we
care about is our call.

465
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,474
Could you inform Management we
want our call and we want it now?

466
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,185
Yes, yes, yes, God, talk
about tunnel vision.

467
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:01,112
You'll get your call.
You're a bundle of nerves.

468
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,440
You can't work like this.

469
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:08,245
You're not gonna get that call of
yours all wound up tight like this.

470
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,040
I've got a friend who
might be able to help.

471
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:18,839
- You said you didn't have any friends.
- Ouch, Quinn, ouch. That hurts.

472
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,753
It's Qohen.

473
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,677
Q, no U, O-H-E-N.

474
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,722
All right. No need to
spell it out, man.

475
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,424
I've got the picture.

476
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,677
Let Joby handle it.

477
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,325
- Yes?
- Mr. Leth?

478
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,406
Qohen Leth?

479
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,882
Surprise.

480
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,009
Bainsley.

481
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,389
I waited.

482
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,642
You never called.

483
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,819
Oh, you poor thing.

484
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,115
Joby's right, you need me.

485
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,486
You're Mr. Joby's friend?

486
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:35,198
Well, Joby doesn't
have any friends.

487
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,747
I feel so, so holy,

488
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,214
going to the chapel of love.

489
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,543
We prefer not to be touched.

490
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:50,130
The rent must be outrageous.

491
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,012
Actually, we own the building.

492
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,595
We bought it from an insurance
company some years ago.

493
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,352
There'd been extensive fire damage.

494
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:04,231
The previous occupants were
an order of monastic monks

495
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:09,191
who've sworn vows of chastity...

496
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,827
poverty and silence.

497
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,581
Apparently, no one broke
the silence to yell fire.

498
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,078
And what do we have here?

499
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,339
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

500
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,042
Goodness me.

501
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,845
What other surprises
do you have for me?

502
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,430
That was a gift from...

503
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,806
Shh.

504
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,268
You have...

505
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,023
the most intriguing bone structure.

506
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,695
So polished.

507
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,574
So, so pure.

508
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,906
Ahh. So pure.

509
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,376
Hey, a mighty big hard
drive you got here.

510
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,000
What work do you do exactly?

511
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,798
Well, I shoot trouble.

512
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,880
Mr. Joby seemed to think

513
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,712
- that you might help us get our call?
- Yeah.

514
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,969
Yeah, he mentioned the call thing.

515
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,010
You're staring at me.

516
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,017
- We're terribly sorry.
- Ahh!

517
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,560
I just broke a nail.

518
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:32,403
- On your big, fat, stupid keyboard.
- We'll get our first aid kit.

519
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:37,703
- Would you please just kiss it.
- Excuse us?

520
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,750
Whenever I hurt myself,
my daddy would kiss it

521
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,535
and make it all better.

522
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:47,797
- Well, we fail to see how...
- Please.

523
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,968
You call that a kiss?

524
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,273
There.

525
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,613
All better?

526
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,118
Excuse me,

527
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,163
couldn't help noticing this young
lady's pathological attempts

528
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:24,868
to project upon you her unresolved
issues of paternal abandonment.

529
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,330
Given the significant age difference
between the two of you...

530
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,414
Nosy bitch.

531
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,843
My daddy didn't abandon me.

532
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,178
He died.

533
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,845
In case you're getting
the wrong idea,

534
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,017
I should tell you that I
don't do sexual intercourse.

535
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,393
I don't care if a guy wraps
himself up like a latex mummy.

536
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,942
- But...
- But nothing is going inside me.

537
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,236
Way too dangerous.

538
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:59,285
I'm into tantric,
bio-telemetric interfacing now.

539
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,741
It's smart and safe.

540
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:08,079
And, God, it just
feel so super tingly.

541
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,751
Got anything to eat around here?

542
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,629
I'm starving my ass off.

543
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,172
Ah. What a mess.

544
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,228
- You're staring at me again.
- Forgive us.

545
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,681
Well, I don't mind.

546
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,437
Just noticing, that's all.

547
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,691
You're a pretty intense guy.

548
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:38,445
So here you are, Qohen,

549
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:44,246
locked up all alone
and waiting for...

550
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,576
For what? For a phone call?

551
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,745
So tell me, what's
that all about? Hmm?

552
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:54,423
No, we've grown weary
explaining ourselves.

553
00:43:55,716 --> 00:44:00,843
But how am I supposed to help
if you don't tell me? Hmm?

554
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,509
Please.

555
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,390
Please.

556
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,403
So come on.

557
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,698
How did it all start?

558
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,574
We're not quite certain.

559
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:33,546
We must confess that
for good or ill,

560
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:37,421
that we always wanted
to feel different,

561
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,301
unique.

562
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,931
Objective analysis, however, concluded
that we're as inconsequential

563
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,554
as anyone else.

564
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,806
We are but one in many
single worker bee

565
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,481
in a vast swarm

566
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:58,654
subject to the same imperatives
as billions of others.

567
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:05,488
We dulled our discontent
in alcohol, drugs, sex.

568
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:10,033
And then it happened.

569
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,252
One night...

570
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,257
oh, a long time ago,

571
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,337
we were awakened by
the phone ringing.

572
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,679
We picked it up.

573
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,510
A voice on the other end said:

574
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,186
"Qohen Leth."

575
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,608
But before we could respond,

576
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:40,028
we felt this great
yawning maul of power

577
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,697
opening through the phone line.

578
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:47,950
We felt a sudden rush of joy unlike
anything we've ever felt before.

579
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,829
Then we knew quite clearly that
we only had to answer "yes"

580
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:55,707
and the voice would tell us
the meaning of our life.

581
00:45:55,711 --> 00:46:00,131
The voice would tell us
our special calling.

582
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:04,257
The voice would give
us a reason for being.

583
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,471
And then?

584
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,516
And then...

585
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,897
in our excitement,

586
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:19,147
we dropped the receiver,
disconnecting ourselves.

587
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:27,284
You've been waiting for
a call-back ever since?

588
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,658
What other reason is there
to pick up the phone?

589
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,330
Well, communication for one.

590
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,283
It's mostly unnecessary.

591
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,494
But that's what we're doing now.

592
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,047
In a manner of speaking.

593
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:47,339
So all this time, you've been
waiting for a mysterious voice

594
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,550
to tell you what to
do with your life.

595
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:56,814
Wow. Probably just a
cold call anyway.

596
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:01,311
If you hadn't dropped the phone,
you'd own a time share in Majorca.

597
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,567
Big deal. Heh.

598
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,531
Do you really believe
everything you've just told me?

599
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,036
Yes.

600
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,120
Okay.

601
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,377
Okay.

602
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,252
I can help you.

603
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,759
But don't go away.

604
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:33,433
And I'll be back in a
tail shake, all right?

605
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,575
- Bainsley?
- Bob, buzz me in.

606
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,154
- Bob who?
- Bob, I have to take a wicked pee.

607
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,330
Buzz me in, Scotty.

608
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,748
Our name isn't Scotty.

609
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,166
I know that, Bob.

610
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,869
- Our name isn't Bob.
- Come on.

611
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,250
I'm doing the tinkle dance here.

612
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,059
Where's your bathroom?

613
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,728
Where's your bathroom?

614
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,397
It's here.

615
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,704
How did you get in?

616
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,956
Fucking magic.

617
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:44,505
Excuse my French.

618
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,798
Holy shit, man, I think I did some
renal damage holding it in that long.

619
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,504
Slim got stuck in traffic.

620
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:52,838
Chubs drove, Bob.

621
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,015
Fast as I could.

622
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,605
- Sign here.
- What?

623
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,308
A receipt of delivery.

624
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,690
- We're delivering...
- Bob. Assigned to help you. Sign.

625
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,483
Brilliant. We'll pick him
up in exactly four hours.

626
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,443
- Don't lose him.
- Don't lose him.

627
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,614
I wouldn't mess with the
clones if I were you.

628
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:22,417
They look harmless, but they'd
just as soon flame you to death.

629
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:27,256
This is a... This is a
creepy place you got here.

630
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,674
Are you okay?

631
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,752
Actually, we're dying.

632
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,180
For me to be with, I mean.
You're a scary looking guy, Bob.

633
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,598
Would you please
stop calling us Bob?

634
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,269
- What do you want me to call you?
- Mr. Leth.

635
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:44,474
Leth? No, no, it's too wormy.

636
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,060
Qohen, then. Q, no U, O-H-E-N.

637
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,770
Gotta buy another vowel.

638
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,071
- Q.
- Or Q.

639
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,865
Yeah, Q will do.

640
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,568
Q is you.

641
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,403
Happy now?

642
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,658
Why are you here?

643
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,581
Old man assigned me to get
you up and running again.

644
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,248
- The old man?
- The boss.

645
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:05,373
The Darth Vader of microprocessing.

646
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,421
The guy I call Daddy Dearest,
also known as Management.

647
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,171
- You're Management's son?
- The one and only.

648
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:15,595
Heir to his dark throne, stuck
working this summer job.

649
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,013
Order us a pizza.
I missed breakfast

650
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:20,092
and this is gonna take a while.

651
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,144
- We have oatmeal if you chose...
- If I wanted to vomit.

652
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,565
Order the pie, double cheese.

653
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:33,689
Fuck. Fuck. How can
you work like this?

654
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:37,027
Oh, it's fucking ridiculous.

655
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,118
Fuck. Fuck.

656
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,080
I can't stand people gawking at me.

657
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,286
Dad, Dad.

658
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,829
Bob's on the job.

659
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,292
That's better.

660
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,880
Who can work...? Who can work
with him looking over your shoulder?

661
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,383
We have nothing to hide.

662
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:04,307
The point is moot since we're
not working for him any longer.

663
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,515
Yeah, right, keep
telling yourself that.

664
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:12,861
- What do you mean?
- The old man is not done with you yet.

665
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,605
But we're done with him.

666
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,700
Like those preceding
us, we have burnt out.

667
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,903
- We have decided to quit.
- Smart move.

668
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,785
- Too bad you can't.
- What do you mean? Mr. Joby...

669
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,788
Joby will tell you whatever
the old man wants him to.

670
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,370
You're a tool. The old
man uses everybody.

671
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,087
That yummy night nurse chick?

672
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,756
- Bainsley?
- Tool.

673
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,584
No.

674
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,716
She promised to help us.
We are waiting for her.

675
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,265
Wait all you want. She's not
gonna be back. Your call girl,

676
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:43,183
she was paid by the hour.

677
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,053
We don't believe you.

678
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:51,062
So, what do you think?

679
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,729
This thing is years ahead
of the competition.

680
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,860
It works on nerve
endings, of course,

681
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:00,489
but it's also synced directly
to the brain synapses.

682
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,320
And Joby said it was
one of your projects.

683
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,577
We can't imagine.

684
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:10,419
We never thought of our project
actually having any purpose.

685
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:15,917
Top secret. I'm the
cyberspace test pilot.

686
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,502
But first, you have to
do something for me.

687
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,808
Voilà.

688
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,762
And one size fits all.

689
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:31,065
- Isn't it dangerous?
- Oh.

690
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:34,811
Depends on your idea of danger.

691
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,398
Just trust me.

692
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:45,238
Suit up, plug in, and click
on my website at midnight.

693
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:57,045
- You're going out like that?
- They can look, but they can't touch.

694
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,716
And don't be late.

695
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,931
I can't wait.

696
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,598
So here's the deal, Q, straight
from the old man himself.

697
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,434
You go back to work on
this nasty Zippity-T...

698
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,646
- We're no longer interested.
- And in return,

699
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,731
I get you your call.

700
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,654
You? You will get us our call?

701
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,953
Yes, I will get you your call. You're
not the only genius around here.

702
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:31,284
I'm downloading your Shrink-Rom
files even as we speak.

703
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,461
- Those sessions are private.
- Sure they are.

704
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:41,256
Pizza! Pizza!

705
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,844
Pizza.

706
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,804
Ooh.

707
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,602
Nice.

708
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,022
That's nice.

709
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,939
Uh... Where do I put it?

710
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,070
Hmm.

711
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,034
Not Just A Pizza.

712
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,037
So...

713
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,948
cash or charge?

714
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,660
Hey.

715
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,420
Thank you.

716
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:26,138
- What are you staring at?
- Uh, sorry. Shit. Nothing.

717
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,766
- Uh, um... Sorry.
- Oops. Heh-heh.

718
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,219
Wrong answer.

719
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,723
Thank you.

720
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,982
Hey.

721
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,279
Thank you.

722
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,948
Aaah!

723
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,368
Holy shit.

724
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,829
Oh, I think I got this hormonal
paradigm shift going on right now.

725
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,540
Was she looking at me funny?

726
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,164
We've grown accustomed to
people looking at us funny.

727
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,167
Yeah, but you are funny looking.

728
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:02,250

729
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,544

730
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,504
You can have the rest.

731
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,049
Our diet precludes pizza.

732
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,476
All right, well, save it.

733
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:17,648
I'll study your files, be
back first thing tomorrow.

734
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,445
- You're late.
- I'm right on time, Bob.

735
00:55:25,446 --> 00:55:28,491
No excuses. Don't let
this happen again.

736
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,990
I'll be back, Q, you can
trust me. Let's go.

737
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,446
Why would we trust you?

738
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,121
You trusted everybody else.
Might as well trust me.

739
00:55:35,122 --> 00:55:38,416
Lose the "we" thing. I can't
work with it. Too annoying.

740
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:41,167
Just ask the doc if
you don't believe me.

741
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,020
One size does not fit all.

742
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,225

I made it just for you.

The hair.

749
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,556
Something special

750
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,978
for a special guy. Heh, heh, heh.

751
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:24,683
We're not at all
sure it's quite us.

752
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,985
Don't be silly.

753
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,229
We no longer drink.

754
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,860
But you can do anything
you want here.

755
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:34,659
You can drink and never get drunk.

756
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,579
And you can eat and never get fat.

757
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:43,586
Let's forget all about hammering
out dents in sheet metal. Hoo!

758
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,380
Mm.

759
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,349
- Huh.
- Hm?

760
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,642
Good?

761
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,357
Hm?

762
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,231
Where is this place?

763
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,480
All in your mind,

764
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,074
or my mind.

765
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,736
Mm.

766
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,451
Do you feel this?

767
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,748
But it's not real.

768
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,792
It's better than real.

769
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:28,167
You're in your computer.
I'm in mine.

770
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:32,551
We're connected by memory
chips and fibre optics.

771
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,629
And we're safe here.

772
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,089
Just trust me.

773
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,728
And let's get this party started.

774
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,564
Ah! Oh! Ha, ha, ha.

775
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,730
Ooh!

776
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:02,621
Hey, come on.

777
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,166
Just come. Ha, ha, ha.

778
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:09,375
Hey. Go. Whoo!

779
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:10,960
Yah!

780
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,713
Here, here.

781
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,173
Yeah.

782
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,765
Hey?

783
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,475
Qohen?

784
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,484
Qohen?

785
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,001
Who knew?

786
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,331
Can we die here?

787
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,545
I don't think so.

788
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:41,221
I hope. You're not supposed to.

789
01:00:56,486 --> 01:01:01,991
Apparently, Management has assigned
his own son to get us our call.

790
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:06,912
We really think that he's far too young
to be entrusted with the responsibility

791
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,743
- of such an extent that...
- Oh, don't be such a wuss, Q.

792
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,748
Bob's a genius.

793
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,829

01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,548

How did you tamper with
our Shrink-Rom programme?

803
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,452
Oh, it's easy. She's a tool
too, in case you didn't notice.

804
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:53,293
Anyway, how long have you been
talking like the Queen of England?

805
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:57,415
- Longer than we can remember.
- Stop. Fuck off.

806
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,468
A former therapist suggested
it as a way to...

807
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:02,715
Yeah, yeah.

808
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,718
As a way to closer
relate to humankind.

809
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,516
Yeah, you keep it
up, I'm gonna hurl.

810
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:13,269
Dear old Dad says I can use
Mancom to get you your call,

811
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:16,020
as long as you keep
crunching, of course.

812
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:18,272
He's all hot on you.

813
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,111
We can't imagine why.

814
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,485
I've been wondering about that too.

815
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:29,538
I figure there can only
really be one reason.

816
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,992
You're the one, Q.

817
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:38,672
You are the chosen one.

818
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:44,761
You're the one the oracle said
would someday come to us.

819
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:55,514
No. My guess: The old man picked you
because you're such a work dog.

820
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,816
The man says mush,
you hit the harness.

821
01:02:57,817 --> 01:03:00,690
You drag that sled till you drop.

822
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,361
You have any idea what the
zero theorem is all about?

823
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,736
Never seemed important.

824
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:14,495
Okay. Here's the poop, the whole
poop, and nothing but the poop.

825
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:19,420
You're trying to prove that the
universe is all for nothing.

826
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:23,251
All matter, all energy, all life,

827
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,837
it's just this one-time-only
Big Bang glitch.

828
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:31,429
Expanding universe will
eventually contract

829
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,512
into a super dense black hole.

830
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:38,140
Gravitational forces will be
so strong that everything

831
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:41,190
will get squeezed into a
point of zero dimension,

832
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:42,894
and "poof" the centre disappears.

833
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,821
No space, no time, no life,
no afterlife, nothing.

834
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,821
- Nada, zilch, zip, zero.
- Stop.

835
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,199
How would anyone believe
such a horrible thing?

836
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,997
What's so horrible? I believe it.

837
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,371
Nothing's perfect.
Nothing lasts forever.

838
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,544
It's nothing to worry about
if you really think about it.

839
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,919
Your father should've assigned
the zero theorem project to you.

840
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,753
Well, he's been trying to,
for as long as I can remember.

841
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:11,180
- But I refused to work on Zip-T.
- Why?

842
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,179
Well, because I'm nobody's tool.

843
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,226
All right, that's your job.

844
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,064
Zero must equal 100 percent.

845
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:24,652

01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,571
Us?

872
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,865
- Where?
- Wherever.

873
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,444
A place all your own.

874
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:43,125
All you have to do is imagine it,
and the VR programme will do the rest.

875
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:48,000
Come on, take a chance.
I'm giving you the control.

876
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:53,927
Close your eyes.

877
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,427
And now

878
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,180
picture it in your mind.

879
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:05,313
Take us someplace special.

880
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:22,163
Wow. Heh, heh. What an imagination.

881
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:27,502
Ooh. Where's my bikini,
Mr. Qohen Leth?

882
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,881
What's wrong?

883
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:45,304
Ah! Qohen, stop!
Just close your eyes!

884
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,854
- We can't!
- Qohen, stop!

885
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:00,527
Is that what's inside you?

886
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:05,244
How can you live with
that kind of emptiness?

887
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,626
One day at a time.

888
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,375
Tell me you love me.

889
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,707
Just tell me.

890
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,169
I can help you.

891
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,799
We can help each other.

892
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,048
Tell me you love me.

893
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,805
Just trust me, Qohen.

894
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,725

895
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,735
Yes, Bainsley, yes.

896
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:37,530
Yeah, here we can love you.

897
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,150
No more being alone.

898
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,406
No more phone calls.

899
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:46,865
- No more projects.
- No. No, don't even think that.

900
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,541
- Don't say that.
- Here, Bainsley. We can love you here.

901
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:55,123
- We don't care about anything.
- No, Management won't allow it.

902
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,130
Oh, Management. He has
no control over us.

903
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,463
No, don't even think it. Qohen.

904
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,388
We can think what we want.

905
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,934

My guess is they're looking
for the least little entity.

can't go the distance.

say you're closing in on this thing.

01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,703
it's a figment of your imagination.

01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,754
There's no such thing.

01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,083

964
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,337
Yeah.

Come on, tell him he's delusional.

969
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,489
It's true, Qohen.

970
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,739
Your phone call's a delusion.
Sorry about that.

971
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:22,909
I was programmed to leave your
peculiar pathology untreated.

972
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:26,538
- All right. Thanks, babes. See you.
- But I didn't...

973
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,169
The truth ain't pretty, Q.

974
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:33,094
But like my old man says,
it'll set you free.

975
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,637
Your call ain't carried
by British telecom.

976
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,136
It's coming from your
soul, connect with it.

977
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:42,644
You know how everything
inside you releases energy.

978
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:47,897
This suit will pick up the data and
relay it back to Mancom's neural net.

979
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,319
How can you believe in the soul
if you believe in nothing?

980
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,069
It's called a paradox, Q.

981
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:57,242
I'm young enough to believe
all kinds of things.

982
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,537
Did you know...

983
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,915
that more than 33 different
aboriginal tribes believe

984
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,916
that the soul resides somewhere
in the lower digestive tract?

985
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,247
Absolutely true.

986
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,167
But here's the zinger.

987
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:17,805
None of these tribes have any
knowledge of each other's existence.

988
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:20,348
- Coincidence?
- Hm?

989
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,267
Coincidence?

990
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:27,398

separate peoples got such an idea?

991
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,024
Dysentery.

992
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:32,775
Aha. Q, you're getting
to be very funny lately.

993
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,106

994
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:36,906
which I'm betting you do,

995
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,905
this baby will locate it

996
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,111
and connect you with it.

997
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,709
- Did you order pizza?
- Did you order pizza?

998
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,176

999
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,458

1000
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,704

1001
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,874
I'm so sorry.

1002
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:41,255
Joby told me I could have the
VR suit if I played along.

1003
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,929
And you just seemed just...

1004
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,303
Well, you were lonely.

1005
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,104
You're wrong.

1006
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:52,309
We were always alone, never lonely.

1007
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,564
Qohen, please.

1008
01:16:56,904 --> 01:17:00,074
Bainsley, Bob. Bob, Bainsley.

1009
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,903
She won't be staying long.

1010
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:05,283
- Hi.
- Hi.

1011
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,036

1012
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,913
Marooned yourself with this guy?

1013
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:14,998
Well, we expect technology
supplied the necessary enticement.

1014
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,757
Yeah, she's like a 10.

1015
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,882
There's no way she'd want
an old guy, Q. No of fence.

1016
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,221
- None taken.
- But I do want him.

1017
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:26,676
I think, and I'm pretty sure.

1018
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,637
- What for?
- Heh, heh.

1019
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,144
- There's just something about him.
- Yeah, right.

1020
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:36,231
Must be the preservatives.

1021
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:39,063
Hey, don't laugh at me.

1022
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,941
Sorry.

1023
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,532
I know it doesn't make sense,

1024
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,532
but I need you...
I need you to believe me.

1025
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,997
You said you never
wanted to leave me.

1026
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,673
That wasn't us, that
was someone else.

1027
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,799
No, that was you, stripped
of all your fear.

1028
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,930
A cheap preferential trick.

1029
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,725
What are you really afraid of?

1030
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:12,309
We accept your apology

1031
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:15,355
and wish you well in all
your future endeavours.

1032
01:18:15,356 --> 01:18:18,527
Hoping that Management
will assign someone else

1033
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:21,480
to serve as the object
of your affection.

1034
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,908
Well...

1035
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,494
Everything I own is
in my van outside.

1036
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:37,295
I don't know where I'm going,

1037
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:40,086
but will you come with me?

1038
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:43,969
Jesus, Q, do it.

1039
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,265
We're afraid it is too late.

1040
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:53,016
It is time Bainsley was on her way.
We have work to do.

1041
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:59,060
We'll go somewhere far away,

1042
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,445
to a special place,

1043
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,489
on a tropical island.

1044
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,488
A real one.

1045
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,528
Just come with me.

1046
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:15,702
I know we connected
somehow, you know?

1047
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,003
I know we did.

1048
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,373
And you need me.

1049
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:26,341
And I need to be needed so bad.

1050
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,475
Just come with me.

1051
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:39,225
You know we can be
together for real.

1052
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:43,111
Just run away with me.

1053
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,780
No, we can't.

1054
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,829
Jesus Christ, Q, do you
have any heart at all?

1055
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,552
- Hey, hey, do you need a break?
- Yeah.

1056
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,222
We feel like a rat in a rat trap.

1057
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:59,179
I've been ready to gnaw my
foot off since I got here.

1058
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,516
Let's get out of this tomb.

1059
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,900
- Do you mean us?
- Yeah.

1060
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,399
- You and...
- Me and yous.

1061
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,732
Come on. Whatever happened
to giving up that "we" shit?

1062
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,319
Well, we've been trying.

1063
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,996
Yeah, sure you have. Come on.
Let's go. Up. Come on.

1064
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:20,121
We haven't been outside
in over a year.

1065
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,453
What happened to you, man?

1066
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,214
Life happened to me.

1067
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,757
Look, life happens to
everybody, all right?

1068
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:31,678
Try thinking about somebody
besides your own selves.

1069
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,006
I'm tired. I'm stressed.

1070
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:37,388
And I'm traumatised for the
rest of my poor love life

1071
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:41,393
with the way you dissed that
Bainsley, who is a scabillion times

1072
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,691
the woman that you deserve, so...

1073
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:47,228
I need a break, Q,
all right? So get your...

1074
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,360
Get your fucking head out
of your ass and follow me.

1075
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:55,403
- There we are.
- Come on. Come on, let's go.

1076
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,787
- Penny for the guy?
- No, go. Go.

1077
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,243
Come on. Come on, then.

1078
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:06,957
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

1079
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:10,714
Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1080
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,794
You don't need...

1081
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:15,301
You don't need skin cancer.

1082
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,678
Right, there you go.
This is a big day.

1083
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,885
A big day. We're going to the park.

1084
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:23,062
And I got this new song
too, just for you.

1085
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:24,810
Let's go.

1086
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,768
Good morning.

1087
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,900
- You having fun?
- Excuse us?

1088
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,902
Are you having a good time?

1089
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,904
Approximately.

1090
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:38,658
Your dreams are our dreams.
That's why we say:

1091
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:42,287
"Enough is never
enough." Call us today.

1092
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,332
Jeez. What are you doing?

1093
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:45,956
- Get out of my way.
- Punks!

1094
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,664
Fuck you. I know,
I know, I'm fucking...

1095
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:51,125
reaches out to that special you.

1096
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,715
They'll never get it up.

1097
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,476
A little tail would make that thing
more aerodynamically active.

1098
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:10,943
Ready? One, two, three.

1099
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,021
You ever have a girlfriend?

1100
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:18,281
Yeah, we had a girlfriend
when we were your age.

1101
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:21,329
We spent every possible
moment with our long walks,

1102
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,875
movies, lying in the backyard
staring up at the stars

1103
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:28,705
until her parents called
her in, sent us home.

1104
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:31,961
Very much in love with
her, as we recall.

1105
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:33,712
What ever happened to her?

1106
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:38,301
We married her, she
eventually divorced us

1107
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:40,553
and we never saw her again.

1108
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,226
Thanks for that happy,
hopeful little parable.

1109
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:47,227
I can hardly wait for my
own first divorce. Heh.

1110
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:52,148
- Yeah, more, more. That's it, yeah.
- I don't know any girls my age.

1111
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:55,820
Seems like getting old
would be pretty boring.

1112
01:23:55,821 --> 01:23:59,741
Old people, they just... They do the
same thing day after day after day.

1113
01:23:59,742 --> 01:24:03,368
Like listening to the same
song over and over and over.

1114
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:05,290
Yeah, maybe it's a good song.

1115
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:08,369
Maybe. After a while, it gets old.

1116
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:11,922
- Ah!
- Get out of here. Go.

1117
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,502
You know, I'm 15.

1118
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:20,260
I'm 15 and already tons of
stuff bores me to death.

1119
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:23,725
Think about what will happen
when I get as old as you.

1120
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:30,356
I'm about to crash.

1121
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,979
I need some food.

1122
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,151
Do us a couple of dogs, Q?

1123
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:37,447
A couple of wieners for
a couple of weenies.

1124
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:42,619
- Can we have some relish on ours?
- Of course. You got it.

1125
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:46,827
You know, I just met her,
but I really miss Bainsley.

1126
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:49,535
Must be killing you,
losing a doll like that.

1127
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:51,996
Sorry, man. I'm going.

1128
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,298
Just come with me.

1129
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,551
We connected.

1130
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,474
You need me.

1131
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:12,312
And I need to be needed so bad.

1132
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:27,204
What's the matter? Just realising what
a jerk you were dumping Bainsley?

1133
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,874
I'm just thinking...

1134
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,328
Did I just hear what
I think I heard?

1135
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:37,959
I told you. I've
been working on it.

1136
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:41,170
That's what I like about you, man.

1137
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:44,847
You're not too old a dog
to learn new tricks.

1138
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:58,483
- What's wrong?
- I'm just dizzy. I'm dizzy.

1139
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,610
Just a little dizzy.

1140
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:04,822
You're burning up.

1141
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,279
Happens when I don't sleep.
Not a big deal.

1142
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:10,411
- You need medical attention.
- Just get me aspirin

1143
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,288
and run me a cool bath.

1144
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,838
I feel better already.

1145
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:24,254
I just need some sleep.

1146
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,358
Bob?

1147
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,144
Bob?

1148
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,328
Unh!

1149
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,364
I... No.

1150
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,034
I don't wanna take...

1151
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:54,704
I knew nothing.

1152
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:11,512
Ow.

1153
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:23,854
Unh!

1154
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,617
You have made a very big mistake.

1155
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:35,912
- He just needs some rest.
- Yeah.

1156
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:39,161
Come on.

1157
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:44,709
- I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
- Here we go.

1158
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:48,253
We'll be back tomorrow
for the hardware.

1159
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:50,256
Don't touch anything.

1160
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:53,259
We have notified your supervisor.

1161
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:34,511
Quinn, you bastard.

1162
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,968
I just called by

1163
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:43,601
to say thank you for getting
me fired from my job.

1164
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,479
You're still a tool.

1165
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:49,857
At least I'm not playing
patty-cake in a bathtub

1166
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,446
with a teenage boy, you sick freak.

1167
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,445
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

1168
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,242
I know what I know.

1169
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:00,614
I had a good job till you came
along and you fucked it up

1170
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:03,951
and you fucked up Zip-T and
you fucked up poor old Bob.

1171
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,413
Well, I'm here to say fuck you
and the entity around it all.

1172
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:11,295
That's F-U-Q-U, Quinn!

1173
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:15,512
- You know my name.
- I know who you are.

1174
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,632
Leth!

1175
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,635
Do you?

1176
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:20,656
Unh!

1177
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:42,048
I'm afraid you won't find
my son here, Mr. Leth.

1178
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:45,219
He's been hospitalised.

1179
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,643
Is he all right?

1180
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:51,770
If I believed in miracles,
I'd be praying for one now.

1181
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:53,939
He's not well.

1182
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:56,987
My son's never been well.

1183
01:32:57,113 --> 01:33:00,567
I've tried to protect him, but
he's always chafed at my touch.

1184
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:04,492
This morning, he stole a car
from my vintage collection.

1185
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:07,119
Are you real or are
you just in my mind?

1186
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:10,702
It doesn't matter at all. You're
part of the neural net now.

1187
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:15,298
- So there's no answer?
- Depends on the question.

1188
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:16,670
What I'm living for?

1189
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:20,718
That's a good question, Mr. Leth,
posed to the entirely wrong person.

1190
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:24,138
You seem to have mistaken me for
a considerably higher power.

1191
01:33:24,139 --> 01:33:27,560
I'm not the source of your call.
I'm not God or the devil.

1192
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:30,604
I'm just a man seeking the truth.

1193
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:34,309
- What truth if...?
- Turn around and look.

1194
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:36,110
That's it.

1195
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,942
Chaos encapsulated.

1196
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:42,484
That's all there is at the end,

1197
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:45,571
just as it was at the beginning.

1198
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:48,497
There it is then. You've
proved the zero theorem.

1199
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:52,623
Not quite. Mancom is still, as
you said, crunching the data.

1200
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:57,207
Why would you want to prove
that all is for nothing?

1201
01:33:57,215 --> 01:34:00,885
I never said all is for nothing.
I'm a businessman, Mr. Leth.

1202
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:02,758
Nothing is for nothing.

1203
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:08,431
- What?
- There's money in ordering disorder.

1204
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:12,684
Chaos pays, Mr. Leth. Chaos
comprises a rich vein of ore

1205
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:15,938
that with Mancom's
muscle, will be all mine

1206
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:17,442
to mine.

1207
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:21,693
The saddest aspect of mankind's
need to believe in a God,

1208
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:25,277
or to put it another way,
a purpose greater than this life,

1209
01:34:25,285 --> 01:34:27,863
is that it makes this
life meaningless.

1210
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:32,121
You see, this is all just a way station
on the road to promised eternity.

1211
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:33,998
The reason I chose you...

1212
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:36,250
I mean, rather perversely, I admit,

1213
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:40,675
is because you represent the
antithesis of my project.

1214
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:42,172
A man of faith.

1215
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:45,470
You see, you've persisted in
believing that a phone call

1216
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:49,050
could give your life meaning.
You've waited and waited,

1217
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:53,058
and as a result, you've
led a meaningless life.

1218
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:58,227
I'm sorry, but I no longer
require your services.

1219
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:03,569
You pervert! You devil!

1220
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:04,945
You monster!

1221
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:07,322
You tear me up, charge me interest.

1222
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:11,157
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1223
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:14,660
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1224
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:18,086
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1225
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:22,049
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1226
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:25,468
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1227
01:35:25,469 --> 01:35:29,097
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1228
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:32,268
I'm sorry, Mr. Leth. I no
longer require your services.

1229
01:35:32,269 --> 01:35:37,144
Mancom, making sense of
the good things in life.

1230
