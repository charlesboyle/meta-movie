1
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,291
Who's that?

2
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,568
How should I know?

3
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,684
Papa.

4
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,485
Hello? Hello?

5
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,564
Hello?

6
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,770
<b> The only real question we should
ask ourselves during our existence is</b>

7
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,287
<b>how much is a man's life worth?</b>

8
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,410
<b>Knowing what you're worth is like
knowing what day you're gonna die.</b>

9
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,291
<b>Me? I'm worth $20 million,</b>

10
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,525
<b>and I'd hand over every last
dollar to get my old life back.</b>

11
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,040
Sweetie? Wake up, we're here.

12
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,367
- Fuck. It's about time.
- Warren. Language.

13
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,562
Mom, we've been on
the road 11 hours

14
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,680
and it smells like a skunk's
butt-crack back here.

15
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,489
That's no reason to
talk like a punk.

16
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,802
- It's the dog.
- Yeah. No kidding it's the dog.

17
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,291
If you washed him
once in a while

18
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,930
like I asked you to, we
wouldn't have this problem.

19
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,730
Yeah, yeah. We're
looking for number ten.

20
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,121
- Next, on the left.
- There are no numbers.

21
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,760
No, I know. Stansfield said that.
That's it, yeah.

22
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,606
No, no, the left, and then..

23
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,683
That's it up there. Right.

24
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,442
Over here.

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,970
Yeah.

26
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,286
That's it.

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,609
No electricity?

28
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,127
No, there is, but they must
have turned the power off.

29
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Scaring the rats away.

30
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,450
- There are rats here?
- Who knows? You never know.

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,649
- I'm not staying here if there are rats.
- Belle, don't start, please.

32
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,007
Anyway, your father can't stand them.
Give him 24 hours,

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,646
he'll have killed every
single rodent in the place.

34
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,408
Ah!

35
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,326
Belle, you're upstairs on the right.
Warren, opposite your sister.

36
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,081
- It's cold here.
- Well, I'll make a fire.

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,650
Huh?

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,971
Idiots forgot the TV again.

39
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,044
- Tomorrow, they said.
- "Tomorrow," that's their favorite word.

40
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,202
Hey, you two, don't chew me out
whenever anything is missing.

41
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,328
Go see, talk to them yourselves.

42
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,528
Does anybody know what
this place is called?

43
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,246
Cholong-sur-Avre, Normandy.

44
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,890
The Avre part is a river.

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,487
Besides our boys landing here in
'44, what's Normandy famous for?

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,608
- Camembert.
- Calvados.

47
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,602
Mm.

48
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,321
The Riviera had both those
things, and sunshine.

49
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,050
Yeah, so did Paris.

50
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,130
Yeah, right. But here is where we
live now, where they make the cheese,

51
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,011
and that's it, so get
used to the real world.

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,722
Malavita?

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,170
There you are. Good dog.

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,882
Hey, hon. You want a
hand with the bags?

55
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,883
No, no, no, I got it, I got it.

56
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,850
Get the kids to sleep, they gotta
get ready for school tomorrow.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,047
<b>OK.</b>

58
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,087
I know it wasn't you, but
I couldn't say nothing.

59
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,281
Where the hell did you go?

60
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,761
- Checking out the property.
- It's so big?

61
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,888
Just getting my bearings.

62
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,522
I was trying to help the
dog find himself a spot.

63
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,888
- Tomorrow, I'll find mine.
- Oh, good.

64
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,287
No cereals, no toast,
no peanut butter.

65
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,283
So you'll have to make
do with the apple donuts

66
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,283
I got from the
bakery this morning.

67
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,251
- Where's this school at?
- I've drawn them a map.

68
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,121
- Do we still have the same names?
- No, we are the Blake family.

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,481
Cool.

70
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,040
Just in case.

71
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,967
- Your hair is damp.
- Mom, it's fine.

72
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,521
- Have a good day.
- Bye, Dad.

73
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,046
- Love you.
- Love you too.

74
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,490
I'm gonna go check out the town

75
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,120
- and get some groceries.
- All right.

76
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,521
Try not to slob around all
day in your robe, OK?

77
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,968
- No, 'cause of the neighbors?
- No, for your morale.

78
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,633
My morale is OK, honey.
Don't worry about me.

79
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,169
I'm just a little out of it,

80
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,846
but you adjust more easily
than I do to these things.

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,490
What do we say if we run
into the neighbors?

82
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,762
Just give me some time to think about that.
In the meantime,

83
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,129
just give them a nice smile, and that'll
give us time to come up with an idea.

84
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,930
And Stansfield asked
me to make sure

85
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,760
that you don't step
outside the front gate.

86
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,404
- Until when?
- Until he gets here.

87
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,401
And you're not supposed
to mention the Riviera.

88
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,646
Where are we from then?

89
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,564
The States, sweetie.

90
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,561
This is not looking good.

91
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,961
Yeah, we're playing in
the minor league now.

92
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,162
- We'll debrief at lunch?
- OK.

93
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,049
OK.

94
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,370
- Voilà.
- Mm. Thank you, miss.

95
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,081
Is there anything in
this area worth seeing?

96
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,242
You know, museum, monument..?

97
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,724
There is
a pressing museum machine, uh, at Verneuil.

98
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,400
Um.. There's St.
Cecilia's Church,

99
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,609
uh, with it, mm, 15th century
stained-glass windows.

100
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,609
Oh. Can I walk there from here?

101
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,202
No. It's next town,
20 kilometers.

102
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,086
Next town..

103
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,200
- You're the Yank?
- What do you want?

104
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,007
If you're American,
you must be rich.

105
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,369
Wow, you must have read
some pretty big books

106
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,409
to get to be the
big intellectual.

107
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,091
You gonna act the smartass
with us, are you?

108
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,962
OK, can we just cut
to the chase here?

109
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,124
What game are you in? Bullying,
protection, shakedowns?

110
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,328
You got a monopoly or do
you divvy up the market?

111
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,170
What do you reinvest
your dough in?

112
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,961
Welcome to Cholong, Yankee.

113
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,886
<b> Sorry, any what?</b>

114
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,010
<b> Du beurre de cacahuéte..</b>

115
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,207
Peanut butter.

116
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,170
Ah. No, we don't stock
stuff like that, lady.

117
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,049
I was only asking.

118
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,567
I'm sorry, but where
might I find the pasta?

119
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,007
On the end, on the right,
after the dog food.

120
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,322
<b>- Merci.
- You're welcome.</b>

121
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,647
MAN

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,889
That makes 92 francs, please.

123
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,605
Keep the change.

124
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,729
Oh..

125
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,246
- Is it any good?
- I think it's edible.

126
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,323
So how is the recon going?

127
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,369
- It's fine.
- Shoot.

128
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,921
Well, the four jerks that
were hitting on you before,

129
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,168
they're in the 12th grade, and
they organize the summer prom.

130
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,810
Remind me not to attend.

131
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,128
The big guy with the cap,
he's the rugby team captain.

132
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,647
He'd do anything to get
good grades in math,

133
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,365
and he's friends
with Jimi Hendrix.

134
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,409
Who's in love with the girl with
the pink ribbon in her hair.

135
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,131
And the girl coming
straight from Gotham City,

136
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,328
runs the school black
market on cigarettes.

137
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,562
The gossip girls
over by the window,

138
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,964
they're the sister of the son of a
bitch who plays Dumbo in the corner.

139
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,560
He the one that did
that to your eye?

140
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,523
Yeah. Don't worry,
he'll get his.

141
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,400
- I already know his weak point.
- Which is?

142
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,046
He needs a sound system for
his party in two weeks.

143
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,607
There's only one guy who
can get the gear he needs,

144
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,606
and that is the engineer's son
over there, sitting on his own.

145
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,725
You don't waste
any time, do you?

146
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,042
I don't have time to waste.

147
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,281
<b>Bon appétit.</b>

148
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,321
<b> In 1931, my grandfather
drove one of the 200 Cadillacs</b>

149
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,003
<b>hired by the legendary Vito Genovese
for his wife's funeral cortege.</b>

150
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,528
<b>In 1957, my father,
Cesare Manzoni,</b>

151
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,684
<b>was one of the 107 bosses

152
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,481
<b>who was invited to the Apalachin
Convention, which ended in a manhunt.</b>

<b>Can you picture me punching
a timecard at some factory?</b>

154
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,246
<b>I could have rebelled and gone
straight to annoy my father.</b>

155
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,845
<b>But that was never
gonna happen.</b>

156
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,361

157

00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,089
<b>And, to tell the truth, deep down,
you know what, I'm flattered.</b>

162
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,928
Good dog.

163
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,125
- Roses need constant love and attention.
- Yeah.

164
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,363
- You've just moved in?
- Yeah. Yesterday.

165
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,602
- American?
- Uh-huh.

166
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,161
- Ah.
- Good or bad?

167
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,530
You know, France is a favorite destination
for foreigners. Are you staying long?

168
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,524
No, I've never stayed long anywhere.
We move around a lot.

169
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,207
- 'Cause of my work.
- Ah. And what do you do?

170
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,764
- I'm a writer.
- A writer?

171
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,003
And what are you? A novelist?

172
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,563
No, no. Well, maybe one day,
but now it's just history.

173
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,368
The landings. It's a commission.
That's why we're here.

174
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,409
- Landings. That's a vast subject.
- Yeah.

175
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,925
What's your angle on it?

176
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,649
My angle? Well, the Marines. It's
a kind of a tribute to them.

177
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,804
I thought there were only GI's
involved in the landings.

178
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,761
Yeah, but I'm going
to discuss the Army

179
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,123
and the core of it and so on,
starting with the fleets.

180
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,045
You know, before the landings,
there was the boardings.

181
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,764
Sure. I guess you'll be devoting
a chapter to Operation Overlord.

182
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,366
Well, I don't think a single
chapter could cover that.

183
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,530
What the 314th Infantry

184
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,924
did in Taubenhof
tops it all for me.

185
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,608
Young fellas, from Texas
mostly, weren't they?

186
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,730
Oh yeah, yeah, those guys,
they were like real cowboys.

187
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,406
That's for sure. Yeah.

188
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,562
Jeez, it's four o'clock already.
I've got to get back in the house.

189
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,529
The kids are coming
back to school.

190
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,569
- Nice to meet you.
- It was nice meeting you.

191
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,006
Same here.

192
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,561
Why the fuck didn't I just
say I was a novelist?

193
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,802
The window depicts the life of St.
Martin.

194
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,806
It is 15th century
stained glass.

195
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,124
- Oh.
- Are you sightseeing in the region?

196
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,204
No, my family and I
just moved here.

197
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,643
- Uh.. Well, not too far from here.
- Welcome to you then.

198
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,406
It's always with great
pleasure that I welcome

199
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,642
a new member of
our congregation.

200
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,486
<b> Oh..</b>

201
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,721
<b>A bientot.</b>

202
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,201
<b>- A bientot. </b>

203
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,882
Wow. That's amazing.

204
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,405
- I'm a collector, too.
- Really?

205
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,609
Yeah. I mean, nothing like you. I
only started a few months ago.

206
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,603
The only one I'm missing
is PSG's number eight.

207
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,003
I'll have to check, but I think I may
be able to help you out with that.

208
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,403
If you have it, honestly, I'll
give anything you want for it.

209
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,483
That's a deal, man.

210
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,883
Hey. You want a ride?

211
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,169
Thanks, but I've been sitting all day.
It's good for me to walk.

212
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,402
Sure, but it's a chance to
get to know each other.

213
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,841
- And show you round town.
- It won't take long, you know.

214
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,002
Come on, Miss America.

215
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,243
Just a quick ride to welcome
you to our beautiful town.

216
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,210
And this way, they get to
improve their English.

217
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,531
Lost?

218
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,205
I just think I missed a turn.

219
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,966
- Where do you live?
- Rue des Favorites.

220
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,569
Aah. That is miles away. It'll
be dark before you get home.

221
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,006
Open the door.

222
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,250
So?

223
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,565
Just a quick ride.

224
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,131
You're the boss.

225
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,962
Hey, we aren't leaving
town, are we?

226
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,203
You have to see the leisure park where
everybody meets up at the weekend.

227
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,567
- Do you like swimming?
- Sure.

228
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,769
I got the feeling Miss America's
gonna knock 'em dead at the pool.

229
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,530
Woo!

230
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,081
- What are you guys doing?
- Just taking a little break.

231
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,409
Yeah, well, I think
I should get home.

232
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,045
It's a little much
for my first day.

233
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,804
Hey, relax.

234
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,203
It is just five minutes to get
to know each other better.

235
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,649
Oops.

236
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,331
Aah.

237
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,401
Get off! Get off!
Get off!

238
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,166
Hey, boys,

239
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,402
if this is your
approach to women,

240
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,965
you're not gonna get very far.

241
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,366
Girls are not some toys
that you fuck in the park.

242
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,445
OK? Your future
depends on women.

243
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,928
Don't you care
about your future?

244
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,845
So take care of them, or else
you're not gonna have one.

245
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,327
- Hey.
- Mom bought supplies for the whole year.

246
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,926
- Did she find any peanut butter?
- You're joking.

247
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,807
Hey.

248
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,365
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

249
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,249
How was your day?

250
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,884
- Fine.
- Good.

251
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,121
<b>MAN Title and author.
A lot of letters up there,</b>

252
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,640
<b>and a lot of money to be made for charity.
Angie, you'll start.</b>

253
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,568
Hi, Don Luchese. You
asked for some ice?

254
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,682
It's not him.

255
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,971
OK, OK, I'll keep looking.

256
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,525
Va bene.

257
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,127
How about your teachers?
What are they like?

258
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,885
- Pretty good.
- Fucking bad.

259
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,408
Warren, can you please avoid using
the word "fuck" in every sentence?

260
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,925
- Sorry, Mom.
- We're not in Brooklyn anymore.

261
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,082
Your mother's right, son. We're
not in Brooklyn anymore.

262
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,961
In fact, I don't there is anywhere further
from Brooklyn than this fucking rat hole.

263
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,484
I'll get it. Finish up and help
your mother clear the dishes.

264
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,291
- How was the first day?
- It was pretty good.

265
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,284
- Anything to report?
- Nothing.. special, no.

266
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,646
Kids? School?

267
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,641
You know, they always
adjust better than we do.

268
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,401
- I heard you already met the neighbor.
- The guy on the left, yeah.

269
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,681
- What did you talk about?
- Nothing much, roses, mostly.

270
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,962
Roses, good. You can talk
for hours about roses.

271
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,884
Yeah, you know, I
was thinking..

272
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,570
How about this for a
profession, a writer?

273
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,644
Writer, good. It explains
your sedentary nature.

274
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,162
- OK. Writer it is.
- But stick to simple subjects.

275
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,164
Airport novels, children's
literature, shit like that.

276
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,561
- A war novel, maybe?
- No.

277
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,408
Anything else?

278
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,001
They forgot the TV. We
can't find five boxes.

279
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,970
The mover drove his truck off
the ditch, broke the TV.

280
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,329
We ordered a new one, be here this week.
Boxes, I don't know.

281
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,847
- All right.
- Uh..

282
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,810
Mourad.. Mourad, uh..

283
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,567
Benkassem. Guy had a little
shop down in Nice. You know..?

284
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,688
Yeah, he was the guy that sold
the Italian produce to my wife.

285
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,810
He vanished two days ago. You
have any idea where he might be?

286
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,286
No. Why are you asking me?

287
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,400
'Cause you beat the shit
out of him two weeks ago,

288
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,851
and if I hadn't been there,
the guy would've died.

289
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,571
That "poor guy" tried to
sell me a dozen lobsters,

290
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,922
said they were fresh out of the ocean.
I cut into them,

291
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,651
they're frozen, rotten. Could have
killed me and my whole family.

292
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,643
What the hell do you want with
a dozen lobsters anyway, Fred?

293
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,451
I just pooled together with some
of the neighbors, that's all.

294
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,692
You're not allowed to make
any business deals, Freddy.

295
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:06,807
None. You remember that?

296
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,042
I was just trying to earn a
little cash, that's all.

297
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,362
What the hell for? You're
gonna go take a vacation?

298
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,720
So you don't know
where Mourad's at?

299
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,330
No, but if you find him,
you can tell him for me

300
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,165
I'm not gonna pay for
those fucking lobsters.

301
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,641
Try to fit in, will you, Freddy?
I'm getting tired of finding you

302
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,326
a new place to live every 90 days.
Can I rely on you to try?

303
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,721
Sure, as long as I
can rely on you.

304
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,888
You know what's gonna happen to you
and your family when they find you?

305
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,752
You're here to make sure
that don't happen, right?

306
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:33,487
I mean that's your job.

307
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,642
Try not to make my
job impossible.

308
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,850
I gotta go. I'll be back
in a couple of days.

309
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,843
I'm going to leave you
Di Cicco and Mimmo.

310
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,881
Ooh.. I'm gonna
sleep better now.

311
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,486
- Say hi to Maggie for me.
- Yeah, you bet.

312
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,246
- What did he say?
- Eh.. The usual standard bullshit.

313
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,290
Djaramambo..

314
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,011
What kind of fucking
name is that?

315
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,087
Hey, Maggie.

316
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,289
- Hi, babe.
- Hello, hello.

317
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,881
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Put them right there.

318
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,327
Listen, I'm gonna go put
this down there, OK?

319
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,881
Hi, guys.

320
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,008
- Get yourselves something to eat.
- OK.

321
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,130
Hey. I'm so glad
you could make it.

322
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,240
Willy.

323
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,087
- Oh. Hey, what a party.
- Thank you.

324
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,449
Hey, babe.

325
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,931
How you doing? Can I
get you anything?

326
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,889
- Yeah, get me a scotch and water.
- OK.

327
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,641
Coming up.

328
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,483
Glad to see ya.

329
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,761
- Aah!
- What's wrong, honey? What?

330
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,249
No.. in the yard in Brooklyn.

331
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,970
Oh.

332
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,121
I was dreamin' about..

333
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,647
Try not to think about it or
you won't get a wink of sleep.

334
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,569
Yeah. Yeah.

335
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,241
Yeah.

336
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,527
<b> If the story I'm going
to tell you didn't happen to me,</b>

337
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,205
<b>I'd never be able
to make it up.</b>

338
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,203
<b>Of the version Stansfield
sold everybody,</b>

339
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,408
<b>I alone know what's true
and what isn't true.</b>

340
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,530
<b>But he's gotta keep his mouth shut, in
the line of duty. It's different for me.</b>

341
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,251
<b>Fuck the line of duty. All
I want is for the truth,</b>

342
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,802
<b>the whole truth, to be told just
once, to say what really happened.</b>

343
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,327
<b>Even if nobody ever
reads these words.</b>

344
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,083
Maggie? Can
you get me a coffee?

345
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,126
Maggie, you hear me?

346
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,409
Maggie? You don't
hear me calling you?

347
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,245
Drop the Italian
Stallion act, will ya?

348
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,285
Honey, I was working.

349
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,408
Might we know what you're
doing on that type-writer?

350
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,642
Yeah, I was, uh, writing.

351
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,087
I'm not buying it, Giovanni, so save
your bullshit for the neighbors.

352
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,281
No, I told you, I was writing.

353
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,363
You can hardly read, and
you're gonna drop a book on us

354
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,364
about the Normandy landings? You
don't even know who Eisenhower was.

355
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,204
Forget the Normandy landings.

356
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,044
That's just a decoy. I was
writing something else.

357
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,680
So share it with us.
What are you writing?

358
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,365
Um..

359
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,646
My memoirs.

360
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,690
I knew it.

361
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,325
Stan thinks it's a good idea.

362
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,209
I think it's a good
idea, too, as a cover.

363
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,203
Not for you to actually
write your fucking memoirs.

364
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,328
Do you realize what a shitstorm
this would land us in?

365
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,767
- I didn't say I was going to publish it.
- I should hope not.

366
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,083
With your photo on the cover? The
one and only Giovanni Manzoni.

367
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,369
Honey, I got to get it out. It's
good for me to write the truth.

368
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,847
You know, even if I'm the
only person that sees it.

369
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,889
I gotta know who I
am, you understand?

370
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,647
Not through the eyes of my old life
or the Feds, but through my own eyes.

371
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,326
Honey, I understand, but you could
have come up with something else.

372
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,801
I mean, being an author's
wife isn't exactly glamorous.

373
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,281
It sounds too much like "trophy wife."
You could have consulted me, at least.

374
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,283
You gave me architect when we
were in the South of France.

375
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,124
- Oh, please..
- The whole neighborhood came to me

376
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,360
and asked me to build swimming
pools and pizza ovens.

377
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,323
OK, you know what,
forget about that now.

378
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,211
If you could be a plumber for five
minutes, I would really appreciate it.

379
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,089
The water in the sink
is coming out brown.

380
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,321
Did you call anybody?

381
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,131
I called the guy, made two
appointments, he never showed.

382
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,728
- Where are you going now?
- Working for you.

383
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,201
Fuck.

384
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,486
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Maggie.

385
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,284
Hmm..

386
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,845
Roasted peppers in olive oil,

387
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,685
just how you like them,
with lots of garlic.

388
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,285
This is really sweet
of you, Maggie.

389
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,044
The smell alone takes
you back home.

390
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,565
- You have any of that bread left?
- Yeah.

391
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,848
Go on then, what are
you waiting for?

392
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,411
You were supposed to be here
at nine in the morning,

393
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,001
you don't show up till about noon.
What's that all about?

394
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,323
Yeah, I know. You're
sure this time?

395
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,130
You.. OK.. no, all
right, all right.

396
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,244
No, I'll be here. I'm not going nowhere,
but don't make me wait, please.

397
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,687
Hey, did Stan tell you
guys about the barbecue?

398
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,921
Yeah.

399
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,281
I don't know where Gio
came up with the..

400
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,330
- Fred.
- Fred..

401
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,689
I don't know where he came up with
the idea, but he's pretty set on it.

402
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,041
The boss thinks it's a good idea, help you
guys make friends in the neighborhood.

403
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,361
"Friends"? No
swearing, please.

404
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,249
- So good.
- Mm.

405
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,846
If anybody would have told me I'd
be living in the land of cream..

406
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,446
Last night, at the restaurant I ate in,

407
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,371
there was cream in the soup,
the veal and the apple pie.

408
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,130
God, not to mention the butter.

409
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,851
Mamma Mia, the butter is even worse.
They put it in everything.

410
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,561
- It's not even natural.
- Sorry?

411
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,691
The human body was not designed to
combat saturated fat like that.

412
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,765
The butter impregnates the tissues, and
then it hardens and settles like silt.

413
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,924
It makes your aorta stiffer
than a hockey stick.

414
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,929
Whereas olive oil..

415
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,203
Caresses your insides, leaving
nothing behind but its scent.

416
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,648
- That's right. Oil's in the Bible.
- Yeah.

417
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,451
<b>Merci.</b>

418
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,044
Why don't you just ask them to hold the
sauce, instead of scraping it off?

419
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,964
We're supposed to
assimilate, remember?

420
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,442
Yeah, but there are limits. Dad's
barbecue can't come fast enough.

421
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,483
At least, we'll get to eat
some decent food for once.

422
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,211
- How was your morning?
- Busy.

423
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,084
- Awesome.
- What do you got for me?

424
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,601
Thanks.

425
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,329
Here, your math homework. Can I
rely on you when the time comes?

426
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,164
You have my word.

427
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,289
I got the report on your
little business, here.

428
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,647
If you give me some time to make a
fake one, your folks will never know.

429
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,245
What do you want in return?

430
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,846
We share the cigarette
market 50-50.

431
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,205
Deal?

432
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,886
Ooh.. Don't move.

433
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,771
Take one of these just before.
You'll feel like a horse.

434
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,160
You're the man.

435
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,529
- You're a pervert.
- Thanks. What about you?

436
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,809
Well, some girl took
my pink pencil case.

437
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,689
You're joking? Find
out who did it?

438
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,525
It took a while, but
eventually I found it.

439
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,327
- You're a maniac.
- Thank you.

440
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,280
Do you know who that is?

441
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,851
Yeah. He's a college
student who's replacing

442
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,606
the Whale while she's
on maternity leave.

443
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,809
He started yesterday. All the
senior skanks are on the case.

444
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,327
So, you'll have your
work out out for you.

445
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,086
On top of that, he's
obsessive about math.

446
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,442
He's studying for some
really tough exam.

447
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,489
Math geeks are such
a pain in the ass.

448
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,371
Why don't you just get a jock instead.
They think less.

449
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,929
What do you notice
first about a guy?

450
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,969
His eyes.

451
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,771
The family at number
12, what are they like?

452
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,160
The mother's a klepto.

453
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,169
She got banned from
the mall in Alengon.

454
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,846
The father, he had
a bypass surgery.

455
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,365
Other than that,
nothing special.

456
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,131
Except for the kid being
held back in seventh grade.

457
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,724
You think they'll
come to the barbecue?

458
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,042
Oh, don't worry, everybody's
gonna be there.

459
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,049
They can't wait to
check you guys out.

460
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,801
- It's the weekend's main event.
- What the hell is this? It's good.

461
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,167
- Calvados.
- What the fuck is Calvados?

462
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,641
It's good, it keeps you warm.
You get a little..

463
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,964
- It's happened to me before.
- Remember that job in Texas?

464
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,605
Hey.. Ramirez, the plumber.

465
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,643
You said five minutes,
that was 45 minutes ago.

466
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,442
You know what we say around here?
Better late than never.

467
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,565
Thank you, excuse me.

468
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,444
<b> Oy-yoy-yoy-</b>

469
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,523
Oh, la-la-la-la.

470
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,368
Look at the state of your pipes.
They must be at least 100 years old.

471
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,806
So, that explains the
color of the water?

472
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,920
- I didn't say that.
- What are you saying, then?

473
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,084
I'm saying it could be the pipes,
but it could be an external issue.

474
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,891
- External?
- Sure. The mains.

475
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,202
But you'd have to take that
up with the mayor's office.

476
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,089
So, what do I do
about the pipes now?

477
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,527
- For now? Nothing.
- Yeah.

478
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,291
If it's a money issue, we
could work something out.

479
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,602
Money doesn't solve everything.

480
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,923
But you're lucky if you've got money,
because renovating your plumbing

481
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,050
is gonna cost you an arm, and maybe
a leg, as we say around here.

482
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,044
If not both arms and
both legs, right?

483
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,765
So, what do you
think I should do?

484
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,727
You call my wife, you
pay 50% up front,

485
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,281
and you make a new appointment.

486
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,046
We're a family of plumbers.
My wife keeps the books,

487
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,567
my son's learning the trade
at college in Alengon.

488
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,404
We're a proud
family of plumbers.

489
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,769
Father and sons for
five generations.

490
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,402
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

491
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,169
And you, what's
your line of work?

492
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,209
Let me show you.

493
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,409
<b> Al Capone always said,
"Asking polite with a gun in your hand</b>

494
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,767
<b>is better than just
asking polite."</b>

495
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,844
Thanks for everything.

496
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,527
Oh, my pleasure. Hey, would you
get me a little ristretto?

497
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,200
Our coffee machine
broke during the move.

498
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,442
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

499
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,408
GIRLS Good night, sir.

500
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,891
Good night.

501
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,243
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

502
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,529
- I need private lessons.
- You need private lessons in math?

503
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,648
Unless you have any
other specialties?

504
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,851
No, no, I only do math.

505
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,001
Good.

506
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,890
So, um..

507
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,047
What's your level?

508
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,249
What's more important, a
good level or motivation?

509
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,125
Motivation.

510
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,210
That's all I have.

511
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,680
No, to give you this.

512
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,162
What I don't understand is how
he could break his legs like this,

513
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,964
by falling down the steps.

514
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,170
Well, they're stone steps, so
they're pretty steep. Uh..

515
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,561
Sure, but there are not 200.

516
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,044
This man has as many fractures

517
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,090
as a man who might have
fallen from the sixth floor.

518
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,246
He had his bag on his shoulder and the
hammer might have hit and somehow..

519
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,210
That might explain
one or two, not 12.

520
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,081
- How do you explain 12?
- I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

521
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,844
I'm a writer.

522
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,090
I know him.

523
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,730
He's a friend of my husband..

524
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,243
But he has a beard now.

525
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,724
Do you know where
I might find him?

526
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,281
No.

527
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,170
He's vanished too.

528
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,766
You have no idea where
he could have gone?

529
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,328
Hey, who are you looking for really?
My father or this guy?

530
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,245
You know, in our line of work, we
have to follow up with every lead.

531
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,209
One clue often leads to another.

532
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,807
How about you? Tell us why
the FBI is on the case?

533
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,487
It's part of a cooperation program
between our two countries.

534
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,768
Can I see your badge?

535
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,761
Sure.

536
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,760
<b> In the next chapters,
I'll show myself to be</b>

537
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,087
<b>one of the nastiest bastards
ever to walk the earth.</b>

538
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,040
<b>I won't spare myself, I'll tell the story
without trying to make myself look good.</b>

539
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,124
<b>But in this chapter, I'll do the
opposite and demonstrate to you</b>

540
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,329
<b>that if you take a closer
look, I'm a good guy.</b>

541
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,363
<b>I'll prove it to
you in ten points,</b>

542
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,046
<b>a bit like one of Letterman's
Late Show top ten lists.</b>

543
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,521
<b>So here we go. Number 10..</b>

544
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,041
<b>I am always upfront, always.</b>

545
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,885
You promised me the fucking money.
Where's my fucking money?

546
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,371
- Bust.
- Oh, yeah?

547
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,526
<b>I never look for a scapegoat.</b>

548
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,010
<b> If you give me a job,
I'll always see it through.</b>

549
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,606
No.. No.

550
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,482
<b>I never showed
contempt for people who feared me.</b>

551
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,360
Don't move for ten
minutes, you understand?

552
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,246
<b> I never betrayed the
guy who gave me my first gun.</b>

553
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,010
Did you ever work for this man?

554
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,371
<b>I never
wished any harm on anybody.</b>

555
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,363
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

556
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,329
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Hey.

557
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,289
Hey, punk.

558
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,965
No, it's all right.

559
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,407
<b>I lived outside the law,</b>

560
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,927
<b>but only outlaws
didn't judge me.</b>

561
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,685
<b> Anybody who
doesn't contradict me</b>

562
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,842
<b>can expect nothing but
good things from me.</b>

563
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,569
No more pictures,
you understand?

564
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,086
Thank you.

565
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,966
<b>- Number 2..
- Hey, Giovanni..</b>

566
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,800
<b>In my neighborhood,
when I was running it,</b>

567
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,924
<b>there was never a single
robbery on the street.</b>

568
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,082
<b>People lived and slept easy.</b>

569
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,287
<b> Of the top ten
reasons why I'm a good guy,</b>

570
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,602
<b>I don't like to 'cause
pain for no reason because</b>

571
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,805
<b>all my sadistic urges are satisfied
when I 'cause pain for a good reason.</b>

572
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,802
Wait, I'm not fucking finished.

573
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,970
- I thought you quit.
- I had.

574
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,487
It's just one. I needed it.

575
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,971
- You all right?
- Nothing much.

576
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,327
Just the prospect of packing
up again and moving

577
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,289
when they find out you
killed the plumber.

578
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,966
I didn't kill him. I took
him to the hospital.

579
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,844
Why'd you beat him to a pulp?

580
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,611
He's the only plumber within
a radius of 20 miles.

581
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,081
But he disrespected us and
he made you wait on him.

582
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,605
Honey, I survived.

583
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,047
And the guy was
tryin' to rip me off.

584
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,204
He tried to make me change all the
pipes without giving me no assurance

585
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,800
that the problem would be solved.
So put yourself in my shoes.

586
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,891
I definitely wouldn't have beat him up.
Who's gonna fix the pipes now?

587
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,567
Who's gonna rebuild the supermarket
that burned down the day we got here?

588
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,131
Huh?

589
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,881
All these supermarkets going
up in smoke everywhere we go.

590
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,601
The plumber told me it might
be the main water supply.

591
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,171
I'm gonna see the
mayor tomorrow.

592
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,084
Oh, are you gonna
whack the mayor now?

593
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,369
Oh, no, I'm gonna take care of this
thing and get to the bottom of it.

594
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,046
Yeah, yeah, sure.

595
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,010
Come on, when you
gonna chill out?

596
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,406
- Mmm..
- Hmm?

597
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,409
- What are you doing?
- I'm talkin' to you.

598
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,642
You get me so excited.

599
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,043
You're more beautiful than
ever when you get angry.

600
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,961
- You're sick.
- Nah, nah.

601
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,364
- Maybe I should see a psychiatrist?
- Get off me.

602
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,046
I think you should
see a psychiatrist.

603
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,403
- You're my psychiatrist.
- Oh, God forbid.

604
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,682
You know, what even
gets me more turned on?

605
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,923
When you start lighting
those fires everywhere.

606
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,440
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't?

607
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,608
OK, Gio, not here.
Come on, come on.

608
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,889
- Get off me.
- No, here. Here.

609
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,044
Then in the hallway. We'll
finish at the kitchen.

610
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,971
Say, who's this
Henri you invited?

611
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,451
Somebody told you about him?

612
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,728
No, he called to see what
time the barbecue started.

613
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,360
- He did?
- Yeah. So, who is he?

614
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,090
He's this teacher at the school.

615
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,011
He will be a teacher.
He has his exams soon

616
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,168
and he's been giving
me private lessons.

617
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,129
- Private lessons?
- Math lessons, Mom.

618
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,806
Fine. You have
condoms, at least?

619
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,729
- Mom!
- What?

620
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,844
We do the lessons at
school, in study hall.

621
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,887
So?

622
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,407
You know, desire sneaks
up on you, honey.

623
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,564
It never waits for the
right time or place.

624
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,000
Take your father, for example.

625
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,730
The first time he jumped
on me was in church,

626
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,611
the very last place I expected
to lose my virginity.

627
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,604
It's gonna be different for me, Mom.

628
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,445
I'm gonna choose the
time and the place,

629
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,762
and it will be with
the love of my life.

630
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,051
Sweetheart, couldn't you have got
something else other than Coke?

631
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,447
- Why? This is what they expect from us.
- What, Coke?

632
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,321
No, American slop. Fatty,
greasy Yankee chow.

633
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,482
That's what they expect,
pornographic food.

634
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,689
Don't even think about using that
vocabulary in front of your father.

635
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,645
Yeah, Morn, listen, the French
are sick of healthy eating

636
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,320
and macrobiotic, steamed
vegetables and seaweed.

637
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,404
OK, what they expect is
color, noise and excess.

638
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,086
They want rodeo and
two-pound steaks.

639
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,766
- I'm not so sure.
- Can you just trust me, please?

640
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,400
There's going to be a line out
the door like it's a whorehouse.

641
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,083
- The whole town's coming through.
- Yeah. Looks like they're a big hit.

642
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,726
Yep.

643
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,760
<b>- Yes, boss.
- How's it going?</b>

644
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,922
<b>- Pretty good.
- I'll be there in an hour.</b>

645
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,441
<b>- OK.
- Meanwhile, go join the party.</b>

646
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,682
<b>- Are you sure?
- You're the neighbor, right?</b>

647
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,043
<b>- OK.
- So, get over there, and join the party.</b>

648
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,247
OK.

649
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,160
- What did he say?
- We gotta go to the party.

650
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,921
I'm relying on you two.
Don't mess this up.

651
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,731
Polite, ordinary,
nothing eccentric, OK?

652
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,689
- OK.
- Warren, did you call your father?

653
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,729
Yeah, he said he'd come as soon
as he finished his chapter.

654
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,484
- Oh God.
- What does that mean, his chapter?

655
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,680
I have no idea. But for the
survival of the species,

656
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,601
it's best if the whole
world doesn't find out.

657
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,642
- OK. Yep.
- OK? All right.

658
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,369
Hi. Welcome.

659
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,761
Thank you so much for coming.

660
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,250
Oh, those are beautiful.
Thank you so much.

661
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,006
Hello, I'm Maggie.
Oh, we're neighbors.

662
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,084
Hello, nice to meet you.
This is my son Warren.

663
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,765
Sweetie, will you
put these in water?

664
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,969
My daughter Belle. Hello,
nice to meet you. Welcome.

665
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,202
Come in, make yourself at home.
I'm Maggie.

666
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,684
Hey.

667
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,926
I confess I'm curious to taste a real
hamburger made by real Americans.

668
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,323
Well, hopefully, in less than ten
minutes, your wish will be fulfilled.

669
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,165
You're going to take that silverware
and put it back where you found it,

670
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,051
nice and easy, or else I'm
gonna break both your arms.

671
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,531
I'll be right there.

672
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,770
Excuse me. Sweetheart..

673
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,490
I want you to go find
your father and tell him

674
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,802
if he hasn't lit his barbecue
in the next five minutes,

675
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,247
I'll burn the
fucking house down.

676
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,449
- Excuse me.
- Sorry to interrupt.

677
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,681
Belle..

678
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,802
Everybody's waiting for you
to start the barbecue.

679
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,121
OK, yeah.

680
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,330
- You OK?
- Yeah.

681
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,282
Writing is intense.

682
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,411
I feel like I've been lookin'
at myself in a mirror all day.

683
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,251
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah.

684
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,281
It's just, I was thinkin'
about you and your brother.

685
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,450
How I always didn't do the right
thing by both of you and..

686
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,767
And I put you in a
tricky situation..

687
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,970
And I regret that.

688
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,961
Dad. Dad, what are
you talking about?

689
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,523
You're the best Dad anybody
could ever ask for.

690
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,525
- Really?
- Fuck, yeah.

691
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,482
Well, let's go party then.

692
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,807
- You OK, boys?
- Oh, yeah.

693
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,088
- Mag, you make the best pasta.
- Aw, thanks.

694
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,988
You give yourself away
with pasta like this.

695
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,760
Everybody'll realize
you're actual Italians.

696
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,725
I added a little cream to throw
the people off the scent.

697
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,405
That's not how you do it, Mr. Blake.
You put too much charcoal on too soon.

698
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,484
You know, this isn't the first
time I prepared a barbeque.

699
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,564
I build a wood fire. It takes longer,
but the quality is so much better.

700
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,848
Your charcoal isn't
good quality.

701
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,691
You have to get it from Michel
on the north side of town.

702
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,241
- Or use very dry wood.
- You'll never get it started.

703
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,971
You should empty it out and start over.
It will be quicker.

704
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,441
Ah, Mr. Blake, one cannot
possess every talent,

705
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,444
the talent to write beautiful words,
and the talent to light fires.

706
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,011
Hey, Stan.

707
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,850
Stand me to a drink, Fred?

708
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,128
Yeah. Give a couple minutes
to get this baby rocked.

709
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,487
- I'll meet you at the bar.
- Take your time.

710
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,966
Gentlemen, in two minutes, your burgers
will be sizzling and cooked to perfection.

711
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,161
Good crowd.

712
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,641
Congratulations, Fred.
It's a huge success.

713
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,850
<b>Well, it's missing a.. I don't
know, a certain je ne sais quoi.</b>

714
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,526
No, you miss the social charm
of a bunch of wiseguys

715
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,842
sitting around in the shade.
Huh?

716
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,401
Come on, Stan,
Have some respect.

717
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,881
Those guys were my family.
Even if I snitched on them,

718
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,805
they were still my family and those
were the best years of my life.

719
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,884
- Whalberg asked about you.
- Yeah, Whalberg?

720
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,124
Nice to know he's
concerned about me.

721
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,810
I hear he got himself
elected to the Senate?

722
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,689
It's always been his big dream.

723
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,569
He's even got a weekly
meeting at the White House.

724
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,644
Smart man. Great. So,
what did he want?

725
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,565
Oh, he just wants to
know how you're..

726
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,120
What you're doing.

727
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,409
Mm. Yeah. Tell him I write.

728
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,326
I did. That's what bothers him.

729
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,485
Uh.. He's got nothin'
to worry about.

730
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,369
At this point, I've just
got a few pages down.

731
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,122
It's all random stuff.

732
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,726
You intend to tell
the whole story?

733
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,645
Stan, how could anybody
tell the whole story?

734
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,880
If I want people to believe
me, I gotta tone it down.

735
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,883
Otherwise they'll think I made
the whole fucking thing up.

736
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,451
You want people to read it?

737
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,762
At this point, that
would be pretentious.

738
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,125
OK, what's funny, Fred?

739
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,965
I haven't written a fucking
word yet and all of a sudden,

740
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,690
I'm a famous writer
at the White House.

741
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,486
Mm.

742
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,445
Thank you so much for coming.
These are homemade donuts.

743
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,728
<b>- Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
- Au revoir.</b>

744
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,291
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

745
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,130
<b>- Bye-bye.
- Au revoir.</b>

746
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,091
He didn't come?

747
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,249
Yeah, but he only said "maybe."

748
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,767
<b>- He has an exam next week.
- Aw..</b>

749
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,648
Listen, sweetie, I don't know the boy,
but you have to be a bit of a dork

750
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,963
to prefer math to a beautiful
girl, you know what I'm saying?

751
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,040
By the time I'm done with him, he won't
be able to count with his fingers.

752
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,685
That's the spirit.

753
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,121
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hey, Stan, thanks for coming.

754
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,282
Come on, help me clear up.

755
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,087
Oh, uh.. You knew Vinnie
Vitale, right, Fred?

756
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,084
Silly me, he was
one of your guys.

757
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,928
Anyway, Auggie Campania
ratted him out,

758
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,007
and the carnage when we went
by to pick him up, very sad.

759
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,685
Auggie gave us the whole clan.

760
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,366
We collared practically every one of
them and that's down to you, Freddy.

761
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,726
What do you mean, Stan?

762
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,920
You were the first one to set a good
example, by snitching on your own family.

763
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,409
Now, everybody thinks you're poolside
someplace, tanning your ass off.

764
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,927
You are the best
advertisement we ever had.

765
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,770
Well, thanks for the party,
and we'll see you soon.

766
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,126
Don't mention it.

767
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,162
Fuck.

768
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,969
<b> Have you ever noticed
the number of things</b>

769
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,731
Dad is capable of expressing
just with the word "fuck"?

770
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,644
- Trying to say Dad's illiterate?
- No..

771
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,802
I mean, he's a good
ol' boy, so you know

772
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,526
he talks to be understood,
not just to sound good.

773
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,330
So, from him, a "fuck" can mean,

774
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,881
"Holy shit, what did I
just get myself into."

775
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,249
Or, "Great pasta." Or "I'm
gonna get that guy for that."

776
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,324
So why does a guy like that need
to stay up all night writing

777
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,801
when he could already
express the entire range

778
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,566
of human emotions
with a single word?

779
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,728
So, you see, as I told you, the
tests show the water is fine.

780
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,201
But my water comes out brown
when I turn on the faucet.

781
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,085
Perhaps your plumbing is a little
bit on the old side, quite simply.

782
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,120
Well, what about the sewage
plant I heard about.

783
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,606
It's almost brand new.
Go and see for yourself.

784
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,484
Mr. Blake, I know the mayor's office
is always a perfect scapegoat,

785
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,847
but for once, we
didn't do anything.

786
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,327
Well, sometimes doing nothing
makes you just as guilty

787
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,289
as if you did a whole
bunch of things.

788
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,122
Listen, Mr. Blake.

789
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,281
I have nothing
against foreigners,

790
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,805
but you have only
just come here.

791
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,361
Let us resolve our
difficulties in our own way.

792
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,320
True, it can drag on, but we
always find a solution in the end.

793
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,802
Well, Mr. Blake, it was
a pleasure to meet you.

794
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,962
Pleasure to meet you
too, Mr. Mayor.

795
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,449
This is really good.
You've really improved.

796
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,284
It's because I have
a good teacher.

797
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,564
Perhaps, but soon, you
won't need him anymore.

798
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,529
So when do you take
your exams again?

799
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,207
- Next week.
- And what happens if you pass?

800
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,610
Well, um, I guess, I go
to Paris and find a job.

801
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,682
OK, uh.. Let's find you
something a bit tougher to do.

802
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,969
Here we go, a turbine problem.

803
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,326
The water is already brown
when it reaches us.

804
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,050
We are at the end of the chain.

805
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,601
So why does everybody
give us shit about this?

806
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,081
Why don't you go and see
who is really responsible?

807
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,329
I'd be happy to. Just give me
one clue and I promise you,

808
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,482
nobody will give you a
hard time after that.

809
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,751
Chemical fertilizers
turn the water brown.

810
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:44,646
Fertilizers?

811
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,249
And there are not 50 factories
producing fertilizers around here.

812
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,606
There's only one.

813
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,405
Sorry to bother you.

814
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,249
Maggie I know, Jesus,
that my family tries your patience.

815
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,770
But you know, deep down,
they're not bad people.

816
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,447
They just need you
to guide them,

817
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,841
and I'm relying on you,

818
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,244
because I can't do
it all on my own.

819
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,210
Amen.

820
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,203
Father, you gave me a start.

821
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,762
If there's one place you shouldn't
be frightened, it's in church.

822
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,809
Yes, you're right. I'm sorry.

823
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,248
You know, this isn't the first time
I've seen you in the middle of the day,

824
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,882
praying on your own,
but never at mass.

825
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,691
Yes, well, I come
as often as I can.

826
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,481
I was expecting a parishioner,
who can't make it apparently.

827
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,371
Would you like to take his
place for confession?

828
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,443
Me?

829
00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:00,209
Oh, I confess it's been years
since I went to confession.

830
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,046
Well, then that's one thing at least
you should ask forgiveness for.

831
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,447
I imagine that you're bound by some
sort of confidentiality clause.

832
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,409
Nothing I say leaves
the building.

833
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,166
We are bound by something
far more sacred

834
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,607
than a confidentiality clause.

835
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,047
The secrecy of the
confessional box.

836
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,089
Have no fear.

837
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,130
Venez.

838
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,930
Warren! Your homework?

839
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,241
My homework?

840
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,483
The assignment I gave you for the
last edition of the school newspaper.

841
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,961
A short story in English with
wordplay and double-meanings.

842
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,207
Oh, yeah, that one.

843
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,727
Warren, it goes off to
the printers tonight,

844
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,321
- so don't tell me you haven't done it.
- No, of course I did it.

845
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,881
- Wonderful. Can I have it?
- Yeah, it's just in here.

846
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,760
Give me five minutes to
get you a hard copy.

847
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,489
Five minutes and not
one second more.

848
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,290
More than enough.

849
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,361
Wordplay..

850
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,289
In English..

851
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,569
- Nice.
- You havin' a good time?

852
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,165
What's on at the
opera right now?

853
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,160
<b>You wouldn't like it, Don Luchese.
They're doing Boris Godunov.</b>

854
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,364
It's a story written by a Russian.
Russki.

855
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,363
Why wouldn't I like it?

856
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,171
If it's "Godunov" for you,
it's "good enough" for me.

857
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,164
"if it's good enough for you,

858
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,006
it's Godunov for me."

859
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,880
If she doesn't like that,
then too bad for her.

860
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,526
I got the Gazette.

861
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,644
<b>Chéri. Chéri.</b>

862
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,682
Gary! Can you do five
minutes' work a day?

863
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,002
- Just for me.
- Boss, I'm on my break.

864
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,288
Move your ass before I kick it!

865
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,608
Vincenze, I think I'm in love.

866
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,444
Oh. Who's the lucky girl?

867
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,967
They call her Miss April.

868
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,531
You should wait for summer.

869
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,960
That's why you ought to stay at it.

870
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,322
- Yeah.
- Hey, Morales.

871
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,005
I have a package for you, boss.

872
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,288
- How's your knee?
- Much better. Thank you.

873
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,041
Looks like a package
from my nephew.

874
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,441
My coffee. You gotta
taste this, Morales.

875
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,001
I would love to, but I have
a situation in Block C.

876
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,049
- I'll keep some for you.
- Thanks.

877
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,321
Specialty from home, huh?

878
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,848
No, a guy from Milan who spent some
time here introduced me to this.

879
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,364
Not as creamy as Irish
coffee, but less sickly.

880
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,363
<b>- Salute.
- Salute.</b>

881
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,645
- Well?
- Yeah, it's nice. Good.

882
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,050
- This is French, no?
- Let me see.

883
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,000
I've learned four languages in my time
here and started Chinese lessons recently.

884
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,686
I butchered them for
decades in Chinatown,

885
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,763
never understanding a
damn word they said.

886
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,729
I thought I owed them
that much, at least.

887
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,087
Yes, it's French.

888
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,486
"If it's 'Godunov' for you, it's..
It's 'good enough' for me."

889
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,370
Go get Morales.

890
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,969
Please follow me. Mr. Chambard
will see you now.

891
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,241
Ah. Mr. Blake.

892
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,600
I don't want to seem rude,
but I don't have much time.

893
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,684
- I have a plane to catch.
- Oh, yeah?

894
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,127
- Oh, you're a biker?
- Yes, always have been.

895
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,884
What can I do for you?

896
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,850
I hope you are not here about
this brown water business too.

897
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,842
I'm afraid so.

898
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,607
If only we could put a stop to
this archaic way of thinking,

899
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,966
"chemicals equal pollution."

900
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,764
No, believe me, you're
preaching to the converted.

901
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,764
But you know, it's when I turn
my water on in my kitchen,

902
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,042
and it comes out brown, I
don't want brown water.

903
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,851
- I want my water crystal-clear..
- Buy bottled water then.

904
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,971
If there is one thing I don't
like, it's being interrupted.

905
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,330
So I'm going to ask you one more time,
and I advise you to pay close attention.

906
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:36,805
When I turn on my faucet, and
the water comes out brown,

907
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,367
I don't want my water brown,
I want it crystal-clear.

908
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,490
- So what can you do for me?
- The turbine..

909
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,927
- The turbine?
- Yes.

910
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,447
The pumps, stop it.

911
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,011
Where is this turbine?

912
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,643
Next tank.. number five.

913
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,281
Good.

914
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,086
No. My children.

915
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:05,211
You open your big mouth about this,
you won't have no children no more.

916
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,286
What are you doing?

917
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,250
I'm just passing the
time, waiting on you.

918
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,242
- Where you been?
- I was just walking the dog.

919
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,561
Mm-hmm.

920
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,164
You read the manuscript?

921
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,642
It's my job, Fred. Don't get mad, I'm
supposed to be keeping an eye on you.

922
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,571
What am I to expect next time?
You come out of my toilet bowl?

923
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,927
No, not me, but Di Cicco
could any minute.

924
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,488
You amaze me, Fred. Really.

925
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,887
You're not as
illiterate as you seem.

926
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,166
This is a bit rough around the edges,
but you got a style all your own.

927
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,564
I particularly enjoyed your
account of the peace negotiations

928
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,326
with the Esteban family
after your turf wars.

929
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,088
You made a "concession," that's
what's they call a euphemism, Freddy.

930
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,806
You practically kissed his
smelly Colombian ass that day.

931
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,850
Stan, I thought we had an agreement.
We wouldn't insult each other.

932
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,880
Keep your ass in this chair, you
wouldn't be feeling insulted right now.

933
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,209
On the other hand, your
account of me is a bit harsh.

934
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:52,287
"The FBI pitbull who's
been ruining my life

935
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,283
for the last six years."

936
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:59,651
"Eyes.. colder than
a rotten fish."

937
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,646
Uh, "He'd be capable of
hauling his own mother"

938
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,882
into court for fudging
on her taxes."

939
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,681
That is just awkward, hackneyed syntax.
Freddy, take it easy.

940
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,889
You escaped our surveillance and
that is enough for me to terminate

941
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:16,726
the Witness Protection Program right
now, and there's not a goddamn thing

942
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,644
all your cronies in
Washington could do about it.

943
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,240
If you plan another
stunt like this,

944
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,521
I'm gonna put an electronic
bracelet on your ankle.

945
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,040
Stan, don't you think you're
overreacting a little too much?

946
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,487
What is all this grief about?
A couple of pages

947
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,400
written in a garage in
the middle of nowhere?

948
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,608
This gets out, you're dead.

949
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,565
Stan, we're all gonna die.

950
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,805
And I'll be honest with ya.

951
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,849
Dying for these words..

952
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,650
Is always nobler than the
death I'm destined for.

953
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,211
OK.

954
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,931
Give me the rest of it to
read when you're finished.

955
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,081
Deal?

956
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,402
You've got a real
page-Turner here.

957
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,922
I can't wait to see how it ends.

958
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,726
<b>Uh.. Belle. Uh.. I'm sorry.</b>

959
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,609
Today is a special day for me.

960
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,286
I know. Your exam's tomorrow.

961
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,121
Yes. My train is at 7:15
this evening, and..

962
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,844
We won't do any
exercises tonight.

963
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,048
I didn't intend to.

964
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,765
I, uh.. put together
some exercises

965
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,287
for you to do, uh, at home.

966
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,522
They're equations.

967
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,521
And I have something that
I'd like you to solve.

968
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,762
What's more beautiful
than life itself..

969
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,849
Devours you inside..

970
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,483
Makes you laugh
and cry all day..

971
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,245
And makes you do anything..

972
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,481
Anytime..

973
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,844
Any place?

974
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,607
"NEW YORK I LOVE YOU
BUT YOU'RE BRINGING ME DOWN")

975
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,241
Belle..

976
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,489
And the answer is?

977
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,287
Mmm! Fuck!

978
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,408
- Gio.
- Aw, honey, I can't..

979
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,963
I'm sorry, but only a good old-fashioned
expression is worthy of your pasta.

980
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,408
<font color="#804040"><font color="#804040">IT IS SO GOOD THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
"fucking good."

981
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,800
It's the ultimate compliment.

982
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,840
I'd happily do without
your fucking compliments.

983
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,651
Honey, it's so good, it's
better than New York.

984
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,325
No, your memory's playing
tricks on you, honey.

985
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,524
These tomatoes are from Spain.
There's no flavor whatsoever.

986
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,489
Yeah, Alzheimer's
coming to get you, Dad?

987
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,529
Yeah, OK. But, you know,

988
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,762
there's something you
do that's just amazing.

989
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,241
No, nostalgia compensates
for the lack of flavors

990
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,324
and stimulates the brain to
recreate all the missing pieces.

991
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,403
What is this with you guys?
Huh?

992
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,289
I'm trying to pay your mother
a compliment over here,

993
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,400
and you guys are going off
on some other nonsense.

994
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,283
Huh? What's wrong
with this family?

995
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,126
What is this now? Hey.
Where's she going?

996
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,566
She leaves the table in
the middle of dinner?

997
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,121
I think she has a little
crush on someone.

998
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,441
Yeah, it's a math geek.

999
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,604
A crush? And I'm the
last to know, obviously.

1000
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,127
It hasn't gone past first
base so far, I don't think.

1001
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,408
Well, that's good to know, but
the guy just thinks he can call

1002
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,489
at any time of the day or night?
What are we doing here?

1003
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,846
Gio, it's fine.

1004
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,970
It's not fine. It's
almost nine o'clock.

1005
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,806
This is not a decent time for anybody
to be calling us. What are we doing?

1006
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,962
- Dad. It's for you.
- Yeah.

1007
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,681
Yeah.

1008
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,161
<b>Good evening. This
is Mr. Lemercier.</b>

1009
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,722
<b>We met a few weeks ago at your barbecue.
I'm the English teacher.</b>

1010
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,921
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know you, yeah.
Right, right.

1011
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:52,209
<b>- So what can I do for you?
- Well, um..</b>

1012
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,569
I've run the Cholong Film Society
for nearly five years now,

1013
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,131
<b>on a voluntary
basis, of course.</b>

1014
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,770
I see, I didn't know that.

1015
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,970
We meet once a month for a film,
usually followed by a debate.

1016
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:03,962
Ah.

1017
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:08,728
I must say, the arrival of an
American writer in Cholong seems like

1018
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,566
<b>the perfect opportunity to
revisit some American classics,</b>

1019
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:16,406
and I thought of a film that
would suit you wonderfully.

1020
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,800
What would that be?

1021
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,810
Some Came Running by
Vincente Minnelli.

1022
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,322
Yeah, that rings a Bell. That's the
one with Sinatra or Dean Martin?

1023
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,802
<b>- Both.
- What's it about?</b>

1024
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:31,646
A writer, who's an army veteran, goes
back home with an unfinished novel.

1025
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,006
- And who plays the writer? Frank?
- Yeah.

1026
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,606
Well, let me think that over,
and I'll get back to you.

1027
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,047
Very gracious of you.
Good night, Mr. Blake.

1028
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,202
<b>- Thank you, OK. Bye.
- Thank you.</b>

1029
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,723
<b>- Hey, Fred.
- Who's this? Pluto or Goofy?</b>

1030
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,882
It's Di Cicco. What do you
mean, "Let me think it over"?

1031
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,044
I don't talk to dumbbells. Play the
tape for Stan and let him call me.

1032
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,770
You out of your mind?

1033
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,160
Stan, you told me to integrate,
that's what I did. I integrated.

1034
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,521
He seemed like a nice guy and I didn't want
to upset him and risk being unpopular.

1035
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,369
"Unpopular"? Who the hell
asked you to be popular?

1036
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,841
"Integrated," "discreet,"
"nondescript."

1037
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,490
What the hell are you gonna
be doing at a debate

1038
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,091
on American movie
classics anyway?

1039
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,210
- The subject just.. as a writer..
- You're not a writer, Fred.

1040
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,010
You even said I had
a style all my own.

1041
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,760
You're just a mean son of a bitch
who managed to save his own ass.

1042
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,882
Stan, I saved my own ass because
I don't wanna fucking live

1043
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,249
like a zombie the rest of my life. I
paid big time for that right, Stan.

1044
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,967
The right to live decent, physically,
mentally, intellectually.

1045
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,646
So I'm gonna get a copy of that
movie, I'm gonna watch it,

1046
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,211
and I'm gonna think of some
interesting stuff to say,

1047
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,469
and you're gonna come
with me to that debate.

1048
01:12:35,482 --> 01:12:36,601
You understand?

1049
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,922
And for that, you know what?
I promise,

1050
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,840
I'll give you a good
write-up in my memoirs.

1051
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,810
- You're insane.
- I know.

1052
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,126
Yeah.

1053
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,123
- I'll see you at the debate.
- OK.

1054
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,167
Don't expect me to
come to your debate.

1055
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,964
Thanks for your support.

1056
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,923
Salut, Don Luchese.
How are you?

1057
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,128
I'm on the trail of
Giovanni Manzoni.

1058
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,769
Are you sure? We looked all over
the South of France for this guy.

1059
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,843
The bastard's hiding
out in Normandy.

1060
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,886
Head over there and make him pay.
Him and all his family.

1061
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,561
Where is he exactly?

1062
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,531
Warren Blake!

1063
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,051
Hurry up, a little quicker.

1064
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,361
Go on.

1065
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,842
Warren Blake.

1066
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,890
There's not much to say
about your grades.

1067
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,721
Fifteen out of 20, right across the board.
No problem there.

1068
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,361
Now, let's talk
about your conduct,

1069
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,002
and the 22 complaints I
have received about you.

1070
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,811
Complaints? About what?

1071
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,530
Take your pick.

1072
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,041
Assault, corruption, bullying,

1073
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,885
threatening students,
teachers, adults.

1074
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,131
Where do you want to start?

1075
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,766
I want to see my lawyer.

1076
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,600
My eyes are killing me from
watching him too much.

1077
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,321
- Well, what's he doing?
- Nothing. He's just sitting at his desk.

1078
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,686
<b>- Hello?
- Belle? It's me.</b>

1079
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,444
I know it's you, sweetheart.

1080
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,967
<b>- It's the boyfriend.
- How did it go?</b>

1081
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,488
<b> Fine. All the stuff
I studied for came up.</b>

1082
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,565
<b>I had a quick check afterwards and I think
I got pretty much everything right.</b>

1083
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,446
I'm so proud of you. Are you
coming home on the train tonight?

1084
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,007
<b>Uh, no. I'm going to stay
in Paris for a few days.</b>

1085
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,562
<b>My father's in town and I have to
start looking for an apartment.</b>

1086
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:51,088
Well, nothing too small and
maybe one that has a bathtub.

1087
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,686
<b>On my budget, it won't be
much bigger than a shoebox.</b>

1088
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,650
A shoebox is fine as
long as it has a bed.

1089
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,725
<b> Belle, you're a wonderful person.</b>

1090
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,082
<b>Amazing, even. And it was an
unforgettable experience.</b>

1091
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,484
An experience?

1092
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,086
<b>Yeah, I mean..</b>

1093
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,050
<b>a fabulous moment.</b>

1094
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,283
I gave you my heart and soul,

1095
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,125
things I've never given
to anybody before,

1096
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,931
and you wanna call it
"a fabulous moment"?

1097
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,246
<b>Yes, you're right. It was
much more than that, but..</b>

1098
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,768
You're right, it was more than that.
I chose you, Henri.

1099
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,402
<b>Belle, I'm not ready for that. My
family doesn't have very much money..</b>

1100
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,005
<b>- What an asshole.
- ..And they're relying on me.</b>

1101
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,401
- That's not the way to do it.
- Come on. Over the phone?

1102
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,927
<b>I can't drop everything
just like that for..</b>

1103
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,890
<b>- For..?
- Belle, try to understand.</b>

1104
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,927
<b>Let's give it a few weeks and maybe
we can meet up now and then.</b>

1105
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,122
From door to door?

1106
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,691
<b>Belle..</b>

1107
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,962
Love was the only thing

1108
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,283
that could take me away
from my crazy life.

1109
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,202
It was my only hope.

1110
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,323
And you crushed it.

1111
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,761
- Seventeen years old.
- Slap him in the face myself.

1112
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,007
- That's not the way to do it.
- Unbelievable.

1113
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,830
I'm warning you, Fred.
One word out of line,

1114
01:17:28,843 --> 01:17:31,004
I'll lock you in this
house for one year.

1115
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,003
Stan, will you relax?

1116
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,888
We're not gonna go
shake nobody down.

1117
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,725
We're gonna go watch a
movie at Cholong-sur-Avre.

1118
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,971
That's all.

1119
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,521
- Want to walk?
- No, we'll take my car.

1120
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,727
- You ever see that movie?
- Never heard of it.

1121
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,324
Father, I managed to get away.

1122
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,371
- Ow..
- You. You can't stay here.

1123
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,251
- What's wrong?
- Your confession has haunted me all week.

1124
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,431
How can you live such
a hellish existence?

1125
01:18:20,444 --> 01:18:22,485
Isn't that the point
of confessing?

1126
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,042
Your family is the
incarnation of evil,

1127
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,646
and your life is a never-ending
pact with the devil.

1128
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,010
Leave this holy place,
for the love of God.

1129
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,681
Enjoy the show.

1130
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,325
<b>- Thank you.
- Merci.</b>

1131
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,323
- Good crowd. Huh?
- Yeah.

1132
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,448
If they'd put your picture out
front or in the newspaper,

1133
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:10,846
we would have a sell-out.

1134
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,331
Are you gonna moan
and groan all night?

1135
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,006
Can't you just sit down
and relax and enjoy it?

1136
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,970
In our long friendship, this is
our first-ever guys' night out.

1137
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,283
- Friendship?
- Yeah.

1138
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,480
I mean, you're probably the guy I hate
the most in this whole fucking world,

1139
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,365
but we've known each other
what, nine, ten years already?

1140
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,966
My freedom is based on the deep
respect that I have for you.

1141
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,606
Explain how that works. How can we
have a friendship when you hate me?

1142
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,765
It works just fine. Look at my
best friends, I killed them all.

1143
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,166
Just kidding.

1144
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,607
Uh.. My dear friends,

1145
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,361
apologies for the delay which was
due to certain technical issues.

1146
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,969
Unfortunately as has happened
on two previous occasions,

1147
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,363
la Cinémathéque de Normandie
has sent us the wrong film.

1148
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,369
Well, that's one problem solved.

1149
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,565
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- But in this unfortunate mix-up,

1150
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,042
we received another American
film, also set in the US.

1151
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,682
And I'm sure that Mr. Blake, as a New
Yorker, will be able to confirm,

1152
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,845
I would say, the authenticity
of the film's setting.

1153
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:20,125
If, of course, he does us the honor of..
Of staying?

1154
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,011
Uh.. I'll try, yeah. I'll try my best.
Yeah, sure.

1155
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,481
Thank you.

1156
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:32,282
Thank you, Mr. Blake, for
staying for this other film,

1157
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,647
which is also a masterpiece.

1158
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,928
One of the very best

1159
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,084
by the famous director
Martin Scorsese.

1160
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,571
Ladies and gentlemen,

1161
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,484
<b>Goodfellas.</b>

1162
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,290
- All right, that's it. Come on.
- No, we're staying.

1163
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,970
Don't be stupid. Come on.

1164
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,407
We'll draw ten times more attention
to ourselves by running out now.

1165
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,891
They're gonna wonder what
we're running away from.

1166
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,088
I'm not gonna spend two hours
listening to you rhapsodize

1167
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,611
about your family's home videos.

1168
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,921
It's a good movie, Stan.
Gangsters all over the screen,

1169
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,481
that's gotta be a turn-on
for a top cop like you.

1170
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,211
I bet it's your favorite
secret jerk-off movie.

1171
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,771
You could tell me.

1172
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,082
You're gonna like the way it ends.
I guarantee.

1173
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,962
<b> As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.</b>

1174
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,644
Jesus! You scared
the shit out of me!

1175
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,041
What are you doing?
Going somewhere?

1176
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,123
Yeah. I got into some
trouble at school.

1177
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,400
I don't want the Feds blaming
you guys for what I did,

1178
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,290
so I'm gonna bail out
and head to Paris.

1179
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,808
I'm 14, so, it's time I
started out in the business.

1180
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,371
Dad was 13 when he started.

1181
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,040
Yeah, we don't have ID's or
anything like that, so you can't..

1182
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,844
You think I'm some
kind of amateur?

1183
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,848
You never cease to amaze me.

1184
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,843
Yeah.

1185
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,891
- Those are Mom's pearls.
- Yeah.

1186
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,520
Where are you going?

1187
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:24,321
- To be with the man that I love.
- Cool.

1188
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,971
- Take care of yourself, OK?
- Yeah.

1189
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,246
Come here.

1190
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,640
- I love you, you know.
- I love you, too.

1191
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,041
What a..

1192
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,800
What a beautiful movie, my friends.
Thank you.

1193
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,804
Now, we're gonna do
a little debate,

1194
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,964
totally unprepared,
of course, but..

1195
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,810
OK, Mr. Blake?

1196
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,805
Be careful, Fred.

1197
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,010
Now, I have a
question for you, Mr. Blake.

1198
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:27,290
When one lives in New York,
does one sense quite so vividly

1199
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:31,166
the presence of the Mafia, as
it is represented in movies?

1200
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,601
Uh.. The presence of the Mafia?

1201
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,442
Uh.. Might one, you
know, bump into men

1202
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,763
like the three gangsters in
the movie in the street?

1203
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,241
Uh.. In the street?

1204
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,287
You know, there's
an opening scene,

1205
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,442
and there's a guy on the left..

1206
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,411
With a yellow shirt on, sitting
on the chair that's turned around,

1207
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,801
he was a real gangster.

1208
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,201
Stone-cold killer.

1209
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,803
You'd see him on
Hester and Mulberry.

1210
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:13,125
Every morning he'd be having his coffee,
just like he did when he was a kid.

1211
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,204
His father used to beat him up,
threw him out of the house.

1212
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,607
This kid had a lot
of aggression,

1213
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:24,449
and that's where that
killer instinct comes out,

1214
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:30,164
'cause you've been getting so many
beatings, you just don't give a fuck.

1215
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,924
Um..

1216
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:36,688
At 12 years old this kid had,
what you'd call a beef with..

1217
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,761
An argument with a kid
from another neighborhood,

1218
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,241
and one thing led to another,
the next thing you know,

1219
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,641
he beat him to death
with a two-by-four.

1220
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,371
"Put his hand in cold water."

1221
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:53,246
That's an expression that
certain people used to use

1222
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,886
when you killed somebody
for the first time.

1223
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,680
Why aren't they answering it?
The kids are home, aren't they?

1224
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,126
Yeah, the lights are
on in their bedrooms.

1225
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,964
Please.

1226
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,045
It's OK, Maggie's home.

1227
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,446
Please. Oh, pick up the phone.

1228
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,283
Hello?

1229
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,250
<b>Hello?</b>

1230
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:11,689
Check out the town, get a
feel for what's going on.

1231
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,171
Gotcha.

1232
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:17,405
No, stop, already it's super late.

1233
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:22,930
Yeah, I'm outside. No stop, really?
Seriously?

1234
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,844
Oh, hi, Belle.

1235
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,570
Wait a minute.

1236
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,601
Wow, what's wrong with the dress?

1237
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,365
- Can I use your phone?
- You don't lend your phone to people.

1238
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,761
Yeah?

1239
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,651
You take care of the firehouse and
meet us outside the town hall.

1240
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,121
- We'll take the cops.
- OK.

1241
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,451
So, finally they get so impatient,
they just shoot him, shoot him.

1242
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,729
Boom, boom, boom. Put him
in the fucking tote. Barn!

1243
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,405
This fucker's out of control.

1244
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,608
Round up Maggie and the kids. We're
gonna go into plan B tonight.

1245
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,250
Gotcha.

1246
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,643
<b>- What's going on?
- We're outta here tonight.</b>

1247
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,809
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Belle.

1248
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,361
<b>Belle. I can't really talk right now.
I'm having dinner with my father.</b>

1249
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,763
I won't keep you long. I just
wanted to tell you that I love you.

1250
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,001
<b>Belle.. </b>

1251
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,811
And hear your voice one
more time before I go.

1252
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,726
<b>- You're leaving Cholong?
- Yes.</b>

1253
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,769
<b>Where are you going?</b>

1254
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,331
To be with you.

1255
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,242
Belle, we've already
talked about this.

1256
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,720
<b>For now, it's better if we just
give each other some space.</b>

1257
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,331
<b>One of my sister's come down,
we're having a big family meal.</b>

1258
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,845
<b>I really can't talk right now.</b>

1259
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,881
- Sir, how can I help you?
- Sorry, I don't speak French.

1260
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,720
Try that.

1261
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,926
Found it.

1262
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,001
<b> But, uh, I'll give
you a ring in a week,</b>

1263
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,844
<b>OK, when I get back from Paris.</b>

1264
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,530
I'll call you back.

1265
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:08,049
I got a question for you, young man.
How many people are in this firehouse?

1266
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,090
Nobody, just me.

1267
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,685
Good news.

1268
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,890
Hey. Hey, guys.

1269
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,640
Hey. Did you guys see the kids go out?
They're not in their rooms.

1270
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,160
No, they're supposed
to be at home.

1271
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,487
Oh, yeah, well. I guess
they must have snuck out.

1272
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,130
That's what kids
their age do, right?

1273
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,806
Maggie, do you have any
idea where they could be?

1274
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,645
No. I guess if you'd let them have
cell phones we could find out.

1275
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,449
Maggie, look, Stan's activated
the emergency plan.

1276
01:30:46,462 --> 01:30:48,122
You're leaving tonight.

1277
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,320
What's wrong, things went
badly at the film society?

1278
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,641
It was a complete disaster.

1279
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,609
Paulo and Albert at
the intersection.

1280
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,445
Bernie and Tommy on the street
there, watching for the Feds.

1281
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,125
They must have a hideout
with a view of the house.

1282
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,722
Mezzo, you cut off the back exit,
if they try to run that way.

1283
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:19,726
Billy and me, we take care of the rest.
Everybody happy?

1284
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,211
Yeah, that should do.

1285
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,806
What time do we synchronize
our watches to?

1286
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,281
What time is it now?
Who's got French time?

1287
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,728
- Me. It'll be midnight in 15 seconds.
- Good.

1288
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,850
Fuck.

1289
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,161
What was that?

1290
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,483
Jesus, the police
switchboard is down.

1291
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,680
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but if I find out

1292
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,371
if you had anything even
remotely to do with this,

1293
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,931
you're gonna go away for
a hell of a long time.

1294
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,730
Calm down. I was
with you all night.

1295
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,644
That's the problem.
Your alibi is too good.

1296
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,327
I forbid you to leave this house.
Is that clear?

1297
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,561
Yeah.

1298
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:25,046
My husband's home. I'm gonna
go look for the kids.

1299
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,283
Wait.

1300
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,326
Yes?

1301
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,329
I'm going by the police station
to see what's going on.

1302
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,000
I want the whole
family in the house.

1303
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,360
OK.

1304
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,005
Stay right here.

1305
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,606
Anybody here?

1306
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,125
I want you to check this block out and
meet me back here in ten, all right?

1307
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:13,725
You got it.

1308
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:14,802
- Bernie.
- Yeah?

1309
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,327
- The Feds are here somewhere. Find them.
- I will.

1310
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:25,800
Guys, look, I just wanna
pack some clothes

1311
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,601
in case you send us to the North
Pole, and I gotta find my kids.

1312
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,406
I won't be long, I promise.
Five minutes.

1313
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:36,006
- OK.
- Five minutes.

1314
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,127
Thanks.

1315
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,687
- They're here. They've found us.
- Who?

1316
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:36,880
I don't know how, but the
street's crawling with them.

1317
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,126
They're here.

1318
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,005
There's no number on the house.

1319
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:46,004
That means that's the one.
Let's go.

1320
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,641
Yeah.

1321
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,047
It's a cleanup operation. Get
that family out of there.

1322
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,628
Maggie's with us. The
kids are unaccounted for.

1323
01:35:09,641 --> 01:35:11,080
Only Fred's in the house.

1324
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:26,084
See that, Malavita? Huh?

1325
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,290
What's up?

1326
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:58,088
- Happy?
- Very.

1327
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,890
Wanna go out?

1328
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,643
Oh, my God. They're gonna
blow up the house.

1329
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:30,330
Oh, my God.

1330
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,841
Oh, Gio, pick up the phone. Please.

1331
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,010
Pick up the phone.

1332
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,482
Shh! Shh!

1333
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,200
Maggie, be calm. Shh!

1334
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,404
OK. Maggie, listen to me.

1335
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,522
We're going to go out the
back, you wait a few seconds.

1336
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:39,765
- On my signal, you come out.
- Where are my kids?

1337
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,163
I don't know where your kids are,
but on my signal, you come out, OK?

1338
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,721
Let's go.

1339
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,609
- Come on. Let's go.
- OK.

1340
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,089
Fuck.

1341
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,726
- What's that?
- Bernie.

1342
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,131
Oh, my God.

1343
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,650
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hey, Bernie.

1344
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:23,724
- It's good to see you again.
- The feeling's not mutual, Bernie.

1345
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:38,330
Maggie, I'd like to
make it a clean kill.

1346
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,165
After what your husband
did, and you know the rule.

1347
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:44,085
- I have to dirty you first.
- Yeah, I know.

1348
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,040
Holy shit.

1349
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,441
OK.

1350
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,930
Maggie, if you don't put up a
fight, it won't hurt so bad.

1351
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,169
- Aw, geez.
- What?

1352
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:30,688
Hey guys. I found the dog, he's hurt.
What should we do with it, Tom?

1353
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,480
He said everybody and
no witnesses, right?

1354
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,001
Come on, it's not like the
dog could rat on anyone.

1355
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,322
- Just shoot the fucking mutt, Al.
- He's a dog.

1356
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,244
Albert, shoot the dog
or I'm gonna shoot you.

1357
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,244
All right, relax, put the
fucking gun down, Tommy. OK?

1358
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:43,890
I'll shoot the fucking dog.

1359
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,045
Aah!

1360
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,082
Easy, my friend.

1361
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:11,162
You're not a little
girl anymore, Belle.

1362
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,167
Fuck you.

1363
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,163
Thank you.

1364
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,006
Fuck.

1365
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,400
<b> This morning, I
was worth $20 million.</b>

1366
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,642
<b>I'm probably worth
double that now.</b>

1367
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,850
<b>I've cheated death so many times in my
life, I don't even think about it anymore.</b>

1368
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,048
<b>It's like getting caught
outside in a storm.</b>

1369
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,846
<b>You just have to avoid being
hit by the lightning.</b>

1370
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,731
<b>But all things considered,
I had a pretty good day.</b>

1371
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:40,690
<b>My family is more together
than we've ever been,</b>

1372
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:43,241
<b>the water in town
ain't brown no more,</b>

1373
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,529
<b>and for a couple of hours, I was the
toast of the local film society</b>

1374
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,170
<b>in Cholong-sur-Avre.</b>

1375
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,800
<b>In fact, the only thing
that's pissing me off now</b>

1376
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,328
<b>is that I have to re-write
this entire fucking book.</b>

1377
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:58,530
<b>And we have to change our names again.
Son of a bitch.</b>
