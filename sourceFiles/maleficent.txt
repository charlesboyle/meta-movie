00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,599
<i>Let us tell an old story anew,</i>

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,468
<i>and we will see how
well you know it.</i>

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,239
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,639
<i>there were two kingdoms that
were the worst of neighbors.</i>

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,639
<i>So vast was the discord between them</i>

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,359
<i>that it was said only a great hero</i>

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,719
<i>or a terrible villain might
bring them together.</i>

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,079
<i>In one kingdom lived
folk like you and me,</i>

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,982
<i>with a vain and greedy
king to rule over them.</i>

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,159
<i>They were forever discontent,</i>

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,789
<i>and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.</i>

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,879
<i>For in the other kingdom, the Moors,</i>

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,510
<i>lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.</i>

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,359
<i>And they needed neither
king nor queen,</i>

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,510
<i>but trusted in one another.</i>

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,319
<i>In a great tree on a
great cliff in the Moors</i>

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,799
<i>lived one such spirit.</i>

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,270
<i>You might take her for a girl,</i>

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,863
<i>but she was not just any girl.</i>

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,867
<i>She was a fairy.</i>

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,225
There you go.

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,599
<i>And her name</i>

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,465
<i>was Maleficent.</i>

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,039
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle!

25
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,190
I love your cap!

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,663
No. No, don't do it!

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,061
You missed me!

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,708
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,990
Lovely work, girls!

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,879
What's all the fuss about?

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,959
The border guards have discov...

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,279
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,319
I want to!

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,319
There are rules, Flittle. I tell
this time, you tell next time.

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,719
No, you told last time,

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,949
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,519
Tell me what?

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,959
Fine!

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,461
Thank you.

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,959
Maleficent, the border guard...

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,828
The border guards have found a
human thief at the pool of jewels.

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,311
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,347
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.

44
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,023
Humans, here. I hope
there's not another war.

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,479
I'm not afraid.

46
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,348
Besides, I have never
seen a human up close.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,501
Come out!

48
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,439
No. They mean to kill me.

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,420
And besides, they're
hideous to look at.

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,470
That's extremely rude.

51
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,508
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
It's not right to steal,

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,679
but we don't kill people for it.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,199
Come out.

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,111
Come out this instant!

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,106
Are you fully grown?

57
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,021
No.

58
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,302
I believe he's just a boy.

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,464
And you're just a girl.

60
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,239
I think.

61
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,741
Who are you?

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,745
I'm called Stefan.

63
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,541
Who are you?

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,261
I'm Maleficent.

65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,311
Yes, right.

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,901
You have to give it back.

67
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,946
Give what back?

68
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,319
If I knew you would throw it
away, I would have kept it.

69
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,079
I didn't throw it away.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,584
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.

71
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,079
Someday, you know, I'll live there.

72
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,389
In the castle.

73
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,465
Where do you live now?

74
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,141
In a barn.

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,624
So your parents are farmers, then?

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,782
My parents are dead.

77
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,266
Mine, too.

78
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,079
We'll see each other again.

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,599
You really shouldn't come
back here, you know.

80
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,670
It's not safe.

81
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,879
And if I made that choice,

82
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,269
if I came back, would you be here?

83
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,307
Perhaps.

84
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,104
- What's wrong?
- Your ring.

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,359
Iron burns fairies.

86
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,907
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,984
I like your wings.

88
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,319
<i>Maleficent thought of how
Stefan cast away his ring,</i>

89
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,799
<i>he who had so little in the world,</i>

90
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,268
<i>so that their hands
might touch again,</i>

91
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,839
<i>and her heart was moved.</i>

92
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,999
<i>Thus did the young thief who
had hoped to steal a jewel...</i>

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,079
Maleficent!

94
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,959
<i>steal something far more precious.</i>

95
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,030
Maleficent?

96
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,066
Maleficent!

97
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,999
After all these weeks,

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,990
look who came back.

99
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,982
I thought it worth the risk.

100
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,907
So, what do you do for fun?

101
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,625
<i>Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.</i>

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,719
<i>And for a time it seemed
as if, in them at least,</i>

103
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,305
<i>the old hatred between men and
fairies had been forgotten.</i>

104
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,390
<i>As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.</i>

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,399
<i>And on her 16th birthday,</i>

106
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,267
<i>Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.</i>

107
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,226
<i>He told her it was true love's kiss.</i>

108
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,348
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

109
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,799
<i>As the years passed, Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,</i>

110
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,100
<i>and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.</i>

111
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,279
<i>While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,</i>

112
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,750
<i>rose to become the
protector of the Moors.</i>

113
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,159
<i>Maleficent often wandered alone</i>

114
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,639
<i>and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,</i>

115
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,542
<i>for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.</i>

116
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,748
<i>But she was to learn.</i>

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,159
<i>For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,</i>

118
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,584
<i>and he sought to strike it down.</i>

119
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,463
Guard, halt!

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,150
Guard, halt!

121
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,705
There they are,

122
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,199
the mysterious Moors where
no one dares to venture

123
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,022
for fear of the magical
creatures that lurk within.

124
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,622
Well, I say crush them!

125
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,748
Go no further!

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,639
A king

127
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,781
does not take orders
from a winged elf.

128
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,823
You are no king to me.

129
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,747
- Bring me her head.
- Battalion!

130
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,301
Advance!

131
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,943
Arise and stand with me!

132
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,270
Hold the line!

133
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,546
- It's the dark creatures!
- It's the dark creatures!

134
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,147
Charge!

135
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,701
You!

136
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,906
To the king!

137
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,439
You will not have the Moors!

138
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,863
Not now, nor ever!

139
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,381
You...

140
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,506
When I ascended to the throne,

141
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,746
I promised the people

142
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,985
one day we would take

143
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,420
the Moors and its treasures.

144
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,110
Each of you

145
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,781
swore allegiance to
me and to that cause.

146
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,381
Your Majesty.

147
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,268
Defeated in battle.

148
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,989
Is this to be my legacy?

149
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,147
I see you waiting for me to die.

150
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,069
It won't be long. But what then?

151
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,509
I will choose a successor

152
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,349
to take the throne and
care for my daughter.

153
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,106
Who among you

154
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,829
is worthy?

155
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,399
Kill the winged creature.

156
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,559
Avenge me,

157
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,826
and upon my death you
will take the crown.

158
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,029
Maleficent.

159
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,068
Maleficent!

160
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,710
So, how is life with the humans?

161
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,679
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.

162
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,705
They mean to kill you.

163
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,267
King Henry will stop at nothing.

164
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,063
Please, you have to trust me.

165
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,759
<i>They spoke of many things,</i>

166
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,024
<i>and the years faded away.</i>

167
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,829
<i>And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,</i>

168
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,663
<i>and all was as it had been long ago.</i>

169
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,866
You thirsty?

170
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,151
Maleficent?

171
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,061
What is this?

172
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,421
I have avenged you, sire.

173
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,262
She is vanquished?

174
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,148
You have done well, my son.

175
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,947
You have done what
others feared to do.

176
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,102
You will be rewarded.

177
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,830
I shall do my best to
be a worthy successor,

178
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,105
Your Majesty.

179
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,550
I've got you!

180
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,028
- You wicked bird!
- Into a man.

181
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,031
It's a...

182
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,346
It's a demon!

183
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,239
What have you done
to my beautiful self?

184
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,708
Would you rather I let
them beat you to death?

185
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,479
I'm not certain.

186
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,584
Stop complaining.

187
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,790
I saved your life.

188
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,225
Forgive me.

189
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,266
What do I call you?

190
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,270
Diaval.

191
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,103
And in return for saving my
life, I am your servant.

192
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,670
Whatever you need.

193
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,226
Wings.

194
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,829
I need you to be my wings.

195
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,159
I present to you the
first of his line,

196
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,062
His Royal Highness King Stefan.

197
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,264
He did this to me so
he would be king.

198
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,110
Now what, Mistress?

199
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,264
Her wings!

200
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,981
It's a girl!

201
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,424
It's a girl! It's a girl!

202
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,867
Well?

203
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,359
Well, I saw nothing.

204
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,101
But there's been a...

205
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,781
What?

206
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,421
Child.

207
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,184
King Stefan and the
Queen have had a child.

208
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,182
There will be a christening.

209
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,709
They say it's to be a
grand celebration.

210
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,182
A grand celebration for a baby.

211
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,026
How wonderful.

212
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,879
<i>All manner of folk came
to the christening,</i>

213
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,239
<i>even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill.</i>

214
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,279
Look, there's the baby!

215
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,599
I love babies!

216
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,229
Can you just concentrate, please?
I'm not telling you again.

217
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,079
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,879
I am Knotgrass of the
Moorland Fair Folk.

219
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,839
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.

220
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,866
And I'm Thistlewit,
Your Royalnesses.

221
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,950
They bring gifts for our daughter.

222
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,828
These are not just any old gifts,
for, you see, we're magic!

223
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,870
And very good with children.

224
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,430
Very well.

225
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,359
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you

226
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,545
the gift of beauty.

227
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,119
My wish is that you
will never be blue,

228
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,306
only happy, all the
days of your life.

229
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,584
Sweet baby,

230
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,065
my wish for you is that you find...

231
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,821
- Maleficent!
- Maleficent!

232
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,109
Well, well.

233
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,540
What a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.

234
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,344
Royalty, nobility,
the gentry, and...

235
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,946
How quaint.

236
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,223
Even the rabble.

237
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,064
I must say

238
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,381
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

239
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,630
You're not welcome here.

240
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,186
Oh, dear.

241
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,879
What an awkward situation.

242
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,905
You're not offended?

243
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,661
Why, no.

244
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,559
And to show I bear no ill will,

245
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,119
I, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.

246
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,110
No! We don't want your gift!

247
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,159
Stay away from the princess!

248
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,662
Yes, stay away!

249
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,479
Listen well, all of you.

250
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,460
<i>Listen well, all of you.</i>

251
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,783
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

252
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,509
beloved by all who meet her.

253
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,551
That's a lovely gift.

254
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,980
Don't do this.

255
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,866
But

256
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,781
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday,

257
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,959
she will prick her finger on the
spindle of a spinning wheel

258
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,906
and fall into a sleep like death,

259
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,990
a sleep from which she
will never awaken.

260
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,586
Maleficent, please don't
do this, I'm begging you.

261
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,783
I like you begging.

262
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,510
Do it again.

263
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,986
I beg you.

264
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,665
All right.

265
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,787
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,

266
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,188
but only by

267
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,382
true love's kiss.

268
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,386
This curse will last
till the end of time!

269
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,551
No power on Earth can change it.

270
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,639
<i>King Stefan ordered his men</i>

271
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,759
<i>to seize every spinning
wheel in the kingdom.</i>

272
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,399
<i>The wheels were broken and burned,
that they might never be used,</i>

273
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,871
<i>and thrown into the deepest
dungeon in the castle.</i>

274
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,559
<i>Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child</i>

275
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,919
<i>to the magic of the pixies,</i>

276
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,790
<i>who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day.</i>

277
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,701
<i>Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle</i>

278
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,869
<i>while his soldiers rode far and
wide to hunt Maleficent down.</i>

279
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,279
<i>But she made walls of her own,</i>

280
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,799
<i>that the Moors might never
again suffer the touch</i>

281
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,302
<i>of any human.</i>

282
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,465
<i>And she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought.</i>

283
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,719
<i>The fairies began their charge</i>

284
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,191
<i>to raise Aurora in a snug
little cottage in the woods.</i>

285
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,471
No! Is this it?

286
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,639
Looks dreadful.

287
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,665
Come on.

288
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,079
We need a smaller...

289
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,279
Baby.

290
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,079
Or bigger bodies.

291
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,719
No, what we need is
a proper disguise.

292
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,159
What do you mean?

293
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,359
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?

294
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,624
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.

295
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,469
So, gather around, ladies.

296
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,502
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!

297
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,981
That's worked quite well.
That's very nice.

298
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,679
Now, there will be
no questions asked.

299
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,879
We are no longer fairies.

300
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,519
We are three peasant women raising
our orphan child in the woods.

301
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,559
- Yes.
- So, no more flying.

302
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,559
- No flying?
- No, no, and no magic.

303
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,999
- No magic?
- Yes, you heard.

304
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,199
It's in the middle of nowhere.

305
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,180
At least no one will find us here.

306
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,199
There you are. Why are
you always hiding?

307
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,702
Come on. There you go.

308
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,862
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.

309
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,987
I hate you. Beasty.

310
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,271
<i>The fairies were perhaps
unequal to their task.</i>

311
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,199
Why is she crying?

312
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,065
I think she might be hungry.

313
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,751
Then feed her!

314
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,639
There you are.

315
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,380
There you go.

316
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,505
It's going to starve with
those three looking after it.

317
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,270
It tickles.

318
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,279
- What?
- You're cheating.

319
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,839
I saw that!

320
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,119
- We're starting again.
- Suit yourself.

321
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,430
Greedy, bloated goat!

322
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,470
"Bloated goat."

323
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,660
Stop doing that.

324
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,105
I'm not doing anything.

325
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,399
Well, someone is.

326
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,519
It's not me.

327
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,547
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...

328
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,466
Stop it!

329
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,661
Why...

330
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,709
No!

331
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,500
This is all your fault!

332
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,550
Come on. That's funny.

333
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,719
<i>As the days went on,
Stefan darkened,</i>

334
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,239
<i>further consumed by
paranoia and vengeance.</i>

335
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,079
- Burn it all down!
- Yes, sir!

336
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,945
Flame!

337
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,741
Release!

338
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,391
Run!

339
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,621
You failed me.

340
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,624
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.

341
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,021
Nothing is indestructible!

342
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,304
Not the wall! Not Maleficent!
Not even her curse!

343
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,782
Bring me the iron workers.

344
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,421
You!

345
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,226
Look.

346
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,142
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.

347
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,221
What?

348
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,709
Hello.

349
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,707
Go away.

350
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,626
Go.

351
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,341
Go away.

352
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,782
I don't like children.

353
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,144
Up, up.

354
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,382
Go along. Go, go, go.

355
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,559
<i>As Maleficent had said,</i>

356
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,826
<i>Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.</i>

357
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,471
Pretty bird.

358
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,780
<i>Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.</i>

359
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,350
<i>And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,</i>

360
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,585
<i>so did she.</i>

361
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,661
Hello.

362
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,661
That's it.

363
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,439
There you go.

364
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,591
<i>She wondered at the world about her,</i>

365
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,189
<i>and at what lay beyond the
fearsome wall of thorns.</i>

366
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,422
Curious little beasty.

367
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,582
<i>But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.</i>

368
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,141
Look.

369
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,549
- Is that her? Is that Maleficent?
- I don't know.

370
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,665
Bring them to me.

371
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,909
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.

372
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,700
Steady.

373
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,022
- It's her!
- It's her!

374
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,199
How could you do that to me?

375
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,319
You said anything I need.

376
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,821
Yeah, but not a dog.

377
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,025
It was a wolf, not a dog.

378
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,826
It's the same thing.

379
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,519
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.

380
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,839
Fine. Next time I'll turn
you into a mealy worm.

381
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,901
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.
Anything but a filthy, stinking...

382
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,270
I wonder.

383
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,426
I know you're there.

384
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,391
Don't be afraid.

385
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,346
I am not afraid.

386
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,184
Then come out.

387
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,989
Then you'll be afraid.

388
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,020
No, I won't.

389
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,306
I know who you are.

390
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,067
Do you?

391
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,388
You're my Fairy Godmother.

392
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,079
What?

393
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,199
Fairy Godmother.

394
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,067
You've been watching
over me my whole life.

395
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,702
I've always known you were close by.

396
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,919
How?

397
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,399
Your shadow. It's been following
me ever since I was small.

398
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,585
Wherever I went, your
shadow was always with me.

399
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,066
I remember you.

400
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,425
Pretty bird.

401
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,420
This is Diaval.

402
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,661
Hello, Aurora.

403
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,461
I have known you since
you were a little one.

404
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,999
It's everything I
imagined it would be.

405
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,583
It's just so beautiful!
I've always wanted to come...

406
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,462
Good night, beasty.

407
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,590
You mock me.

408
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,901
I know what you're doing.

409
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,359
I know exactly what you're doing.

410
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,839
Sire?

411
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,627
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.

412
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,347
Leave me.

413
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,624
Sire, she is not well.

414
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,542
The nurses are fearful that she
won't make it through the night.

415
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,548
Can you not see we're
having a conversation?

416
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,679
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.

417
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,741
And on that day, I will be ready.

418
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,229
They're so beautiful.

419
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,748
I revoke the curse.

420
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,302
Let it be no more.

421
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,069
I revoke the curse.

422
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,141
Let it be no more.

423
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,879
I revoke my curse!

424
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,065
Let it be no more!

425
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,549
I revoke my curse!

426
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,424
Let it be no more!

427
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,425
Let it be no more!

428
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,987
<i>This curse will last
till the end of time.</i>

429
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,666
<i>No power on Earth can change it.</i>

430
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,060
Do all the Fair People have wings?

431
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,079
Most do.

432
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,423
Then why don't you?

433
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,502
All the other fairies fly.

434
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,039
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.

435
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,304
That's all I wish to say about it.

436
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,784
What color were they?

437
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,906
Were they big?

438
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,543
So big they dragged
behind me when I walked.

439
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,839
And they were strong.

440
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,344
They could carry me above the
clouds and into the headwinds.

441
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,710
And they never faltered,
not even once.

442
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,660
I could trust them.

443
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,430
She's coming. She's coming.

444
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,507
Where are your workers?

445
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,719
In their beds, Majesty.

446
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,439
Get them back to work without delay.

447
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,999
They're exhausted, sire.

448
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,310
But I'll have them back
to work at first light.

449
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,959
I need them back to work now.

450
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,110
It's the wee hours.

451
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,586
Aye.

452
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,301
Aye.

453
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,031
It is the wee hours.

454
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,079
So wake them up.

455
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,150
Sire?

456
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,039
So wake them up, and get
them back to work now!

457
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,589
We're running out of time! Go, now!

458
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,381
Aurora?

459
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,991
Come here.

460
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,786
Sit.

461
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,025
There's something
I need to tell you.

462
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,985
What is it?

463
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,705
There is an evil in this world,

464
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,022
and I cannot keep you from it.

465
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,519
I'm almost 16, Godmother.

466
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,590
I can take care of myself.

467
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,665
I understand.

468
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,587
- But that's not what I have to tell you.
- I have a plan.

469
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,679
When I'm older,

470
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,751
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.

471
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,428
Then we can look after each other.

472
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,959
You don't have to wait
until you're older.

473
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,666
You could live here now.

474
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,904
Then I will.

475
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,759
I'll sleep in a tree and
eat berries and black nuts

476
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,911
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.

477
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,262
I'll be happy here for
the rest of my life.

478
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,787
I'm going to tell my
aunties tomorrow.

479
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,184
Until tomorrow.

480
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,306
I'm so excited!

481
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,599
Aunties, I'm almost 16.

482
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,759
I need a life of my own.

483
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,389
No. I love you very much,

484
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,750
but it's time to say goodbye.

485
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,679
You've been very good to me,

486
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,024
except the time you
accidentally fed me spiders.

487
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,181
Hello.

488
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,399
I'm sorry to bother you,

489
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,039
but I'm on my way to
King Stefan's castle

490
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,319
and I've become hopelessly lost.

491
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,901
Can you help me?

492
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,426
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...

493
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,545
Forgive me.

494
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,344
It's that way.

495
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,990
The castle.

496
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,180
What's your name?

497
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,940
It's Philip.

498
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,066
Hello, Philip.

499
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,831
What's yours?

500
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,391
Aurora.

501
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,744
Hello, Aurora.

502
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,159
Well, it was nice meeting you.

503
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,346
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.

504
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,199
You're forgiven.

505
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,304
That's good.

506
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,711
I'd best be off, then.

507
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,745
Good bye.

508
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,262
Will you be back this way?

509
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,385
Nothing could stop me.

510
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,745
Then I'll see you soon.

511
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,911
Very soon.

512
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,143
- Goodbye, Philip.
- Goodbye, for now.

513
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,863
Stop doing that.

514
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,745
Well?

515
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,751
That boy's the answer.

516
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,479
- No, Diaval.
- Yes!

517
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,999
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.

518
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,399
True love's kiss?

519
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,664
Have you not worked it out yet?

520
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,429
I cursed her that way because
there is no such thing.

521
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,908
Well, that might be how you feel,

522
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,101
but what about Aurora?

523
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,263
That boy could be her only chance.

524
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,260
It's her fate, anyway.

525
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,519
Go ahead.

526
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,799
Turn me into whatever you want.

527
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,279
A bird, a worm.

528
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,669
I don't care anymore.

529
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,502
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.

530
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,359
We are not leaving tomorrow.

531
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,799
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

532
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,799
And Stefan told us to take her
back the day after her birthday.

533
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,119
No. He said on her birthday.

534
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,479
No. The day after her birthday.

535
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,470
- On.
- After.

536
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,786
- On.
- After.

537
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,263
- On, on, on!
- After, after, after!

538
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,504
Stop it!

539
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,507
What?

540
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,025
How could you?

541
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,919
I need to talk to you
about something.

542
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,661
Yes, sweetie, what is it?

543
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,829
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

544
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,463
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.

545
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,626
Yes.

546
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,467
I'm leaving home.

547
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,399
See here, young lady.

548
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,279
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel

549
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,020
with these two imbeciles...

550
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,879
So that you could ruin
it on the last day.

551
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,826
We are taking you back
to your father with...

552
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,071
My father?

553
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,902
You told me my parents were dead.

554
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,710
I think you better
come and sit down.

555
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,983
Fairy Godmother!

556
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,711
I'm here.

557
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,945
When were you going to
tell me that I'm cursed?

558
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,260
Is it true?

559
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,506
It is.

560
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,519
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.

561
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,785
I... I can't remember her name.

562
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,025
They said

563
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,079
it was...

564
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,105
Maleficent.

565
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,150
Is that you?

566
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,188
Are you Maleficent?

567
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,780
No!

568
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,825
Don't touch me.

569
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,224
You're the evil that's in the world.

570
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,951
It's you!

571
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,141
Find the boy!

572
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,519
I need every available man
on the east wing now.

573
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,759
There should be no guards at the
gate. I want her to walk right in.

574
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,785
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

575
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,063
We found this urchin at the gate.

576
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,748
She claims to be the princess.

577
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,519
Father.

578
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,909
It's me, Aurora!

579
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,141
You look just like your mother.

580
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,519
They brought you
back a day too soon.

581
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,719
I told those three idiots!

582
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,039
Lock her up in her room.

583
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,666
Go.

584
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,986
Prepare the men.
Maleficent's coming.

585
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,710
It's so good to be small again!

586
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,559
Look at my feet!

587
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,119
I love my tiny little feet!

588
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,239
Pay attention!
We have to find Aurora,

589
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:30,220
or the king will have our heads!

590
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,421
<i>Aurora.</i>

591
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,671
Wait!

592
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,305
Princess?

593
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,505
I'm looking for a girl.

594
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,750
Of course you are.

595
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,984
I need a horse.

596
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:56,144
<i>into a sleep like death.</i>

597
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,989
<i>Aurora.</i>

598
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,701
Come on, Diaval!

599
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,990
<i>Aurora.</i>

600
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,864
Faster, Diaval, faster!

601
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:05,546
<i>She will prick her finger on the
spindle of a spinning wheel</i>

602
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,148
<i>and fall into a sleep like death.</i>

603
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,588
<i>No power on Earth...</i>

604
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,991
<i>A sleep like death.</i>

605
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,780
It's done.

606
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:10,309
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.

607
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,825
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.

608
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,623
Then don't come.
It's not your fight.

609
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,829
Thank you very much.

610
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,390
"I need you, Diaval. I can't
do this without you, Diaval."

611
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,105
I can hear you.

612
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,541
Look at her.

613
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,222
Look at what you've done.

614
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,864
She's only sleeping.

615
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,105
She's only sleeping, you say?

616
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,024
She's only sleeping.

617
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,110
She's only sleeping forever!

618
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,230
- What about the kiss?
- Yes! True love's kiss!

619
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,319
True love does not exist.

620
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,221
But it's her only
chance, Your Majesty.

621
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,351
Mistress.

622
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,519
What are we going to do?

623
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,079
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.

624
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,159
But we don't even
know where to start.

625
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,186
True love doesn't just
fall from trees, you know.

626
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,119
Pardon me.

627
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,679
I'm embarrassed to say I
don't know where I am.

628
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,342
In King Stefan's castle.

629
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,310
This is where I'm meant to be.

630
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,639
Odd that I can't
recall how I got here.

631
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,959
Why have you come?

632
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,639
My father sent me to see the King.

633
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,959
Who is your father?

634
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,700
King John of Ulstead.

635
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,144
A prince!

636
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,665
Aurora.

637
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,669
He knows her.

638
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,679
Why is she sleeping?

639
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,999
She's trapped in an enchantment.

640
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,662
Isn't she beautiful?

641
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,386
The most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

642
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,503
Do you want to kiss her?

643
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,399
Very much.

644
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,231
Go on, then.

645
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,199
I wouldn't feel right about it.

646
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,039
I barely know her.
We've only met once.

647
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,359
Haven't you ever heard
of love at first sight?

648
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,359
Kiss her!

649
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,861
Go on.

650
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,020
An enchantment, you say?

651
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,270
Kiss her!

652
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,919
You didn't do it properly!

653
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,519
It's supposed to be
true love's kiss!

654
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,119
I was certain he was the one.

655
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,191
- What are you doing?
- We have to keep looking.

656
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,626
I told you.

657
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,861
I will not ask your forgiveness

658
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:58,467
because what I have done
to you is unforgivable.

659
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,550
I was so lost

660
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,941
in hatred and revenge.

661
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,982
Sweet Aurora,

662
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,586
you stole what was left of my heart.

663
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,947
And now I have lost you forever.

664
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:36,030
I swear, no harm will come
to you as long as I live.

665
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:42,301
And not a day shall pass
that I don't miss your smile.

666
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,382
Hello, Godmother.

667
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,709
Hello, beasty.

668
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,070
No truer love.

669
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,230
She's here, sire.

670
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,423
Are we going back to the Moors now?

671
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,509
If that is what you wish.

672
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,627
We've got her!

673
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,749
- Stop!
- Get back!

674
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,266
No!

675
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,505
Into a dragon.

676
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,020
To the other side.

677
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,984
Run, Aurora!

678
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,879
Get back! Hold it steady!

679
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,064
Pull to the left! Pull!

680
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,871
Hold the line!

681
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,626
Look out. Hold your line.

682
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,705
- Close in.
- Bring it down!

683
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,386
Enough!

684
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,144
How does it feel?

685
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:14,106
To be a fairy creature without wings

686
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,791
in a world where you don't belong?

687
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,026
Kill her!

688
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,786
Kill her!

689
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,270
Shoot!

690
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,519
Shoot her!

691
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,101
Take aim!

692
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,101
It's over.

693
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,519
<i>Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns</i>

694
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,307
<i>and took off her crown.</i>

695
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,839
<i>And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,</i>

696
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:26,519
<i>long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child</i>

697
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,261
<i>and her heart was bright.</i>

698
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,631
<i>For now, it was again.</i>

699
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,147
<i>But that was not all.</i>

700
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,911
There she is. Hurry up.
They're waiting.

701
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,746
Wait for me!

702
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,782
We present this crown
to our little Aurora,

703
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,304
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...

704
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,265
Never mind.

705
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,503
Our kingdoms have been unified.

706
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,263
You have your queen.

707
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,585
<i>So you see, the story is
not quite as you were told,</i>

708
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,319
<i>and I should know,</i>

709
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:27,348
<i>for I was the one they
called Sleeping Beauty.</i>

710
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:05,359
<i>In the end, my kingdom was
united not by a hero or a villain,</i>

711
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,359
<i>as legend had predicted,</i>

712
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,865
<i>but by one who was
both hero and villain.</i>

713
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,461
<i>And her name was Maleficent.</i>
