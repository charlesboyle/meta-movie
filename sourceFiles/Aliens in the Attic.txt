Wonderful. Not one "A."
No.

than just fireworks
in the sky tonight...

as an unexpected meteor shower
adds a little excitement to our area
this holiday weekend.

00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,426
I hate cotton.

165
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,097
[Chuckles]
Mind helping me
with the lotion, babe?

166
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,605
I'm thinking shooting
my sister's boyfriend isn't the best idea.

167
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,150
This isn't about ideas.
This is about action.

168
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,152
Don't think. Do.

169
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,489
I can't believe
I'm even listening to you.
You're dressed like a shrub.

170
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,451
- Just a little on my chest.
- Target is on the move.

171
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,038
- Take him out before
he reaches second base.
- Nah. I don't think that—

[Screams]
[Yelling]

174
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,090
- Why did you do that?
- Shut up. You'll
compromise our position.

175
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,718
[Yelling Continues]

176
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,220
Oh, my God. She saw us.
What do we do?
What do we do?

177
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:06,224
Camo mode.
Hunker down and blend.

178
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,476
[Grunts]

179
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,021
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You shot my boyfriend.

180
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,858
"Sorry" doesn't
even touch that.
When, Tom?

181
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,652
When are you gonna
grow up and stop being
a total embarrassment?

182
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,614
And that's
why we use camo.

183
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,742
Shut up, Jake.

184
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,577
[Thunder Rumbling]

185
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,746
Ooh!
Are you
gonna be okay?

186
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,873
[Stuart] I don't know
what you were thinking.
I really don't.

187
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,958
Yeah, I'm gonna be all right.
A paintball gun.

188
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,210
This was a good idea though,
Miss Smarty-Pants.
That's a gateway gun.

189
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,671
[Laughs]
How about what's next?
B. B? Pellet?

190
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,884
Stun? What am I gonna do?
What do you think I should do?
I don't know what to do.

191
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,344
Can't you
keep him in his room
for the rest of the week?

192
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,056
- But it wasn't even me.
- Okay, you boys are just lucky
that Ricky wasn't badly hurt.

193
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,976
It's okay, Mr. P.
I was a little kid once too.

194
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,021
Oh, that's nice, Ricky.
Thank you.
He's a good guy.

195
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,107
He's a good guy.
But, no, I'm not okay with this.

196
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,110
Look, we're up here to fish,
not to hunt your sister's
boyfriend, all right?

197
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,740
You could have put his eye out.
Would that have been funny?
I don't think so.

198
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,577
All right, let's start over
with a clean slate.

199
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,871
Tomorrow, we fish.

200
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,623
7:00 a.m. Sharp.
7:00?

201
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,292
- You're kidding.
- Pass. Nate?

202
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,754
Yeah, Stu. Don't you think
that's a little early?
How about this?

203
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,882
10:00 a.m., on the boat,
no questions asked.

204
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,968
Way to crack the whip, Nate.
Way to crack the whip.

Oh, Stu. Stu.

208
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,482
Natey, the TV's gone haywire.

209
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,526
Stu, TV's gone haywire!

210
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,446
- [Cane Banging TV]
- Mom. Mom, stop it.
It's probably the dish.

211
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,490
After the storm,
I'll climb up on the roof
and fix it.

212
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,451
Hey, wait a second, Mr. P.
Let me fix the dish, man.

213
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,495
That's the least I can do
for your hospitality.

214
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,206
- No, Ricky. You're hurt.
- Oh, no. It was just a graze.

215
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,375
Oh, no, honey. He's fine.

216
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,961
Go ahead, Richard.
Show some hustle.

217
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:02,382
Yes, indeedy.
But I will be needing
a helping hand.

218
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,928
So what do you say, brother?
Give us a chance
to bury the old hatchet.

219
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,351
Make things right with Ricky,
or don't come off that roof.

220
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,530
Uh, ladies first.

221
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,370
Whoa.

222
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,665
Whoa.
Total creepshow.

223
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,837
All right. Here we go.

224
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,464
Listen, about
that paintball thing—

225
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,968
Oh, hey.
Don't even worry about it.

226
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,430
Firecracker! Too slow.
[Laughs]

227
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,392
You know what?
Thanks to your little,
uh, sharpshooting stunt,

228
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,102
I racked up pity points
with your parents,

229
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,563
and big sis is just itching
to be my private nurse.

230
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:03,151
So thanks a ton, ace.
That was a textbook
wingman move.

231
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,153
Come on.
Quit stalling.

232
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,906
Get your butt up there
and make me Nana's hero.

233
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,575
But you told my dad
you'd fix it.

234
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,702
Aw, well, I told your dad
a lot of things.

235
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,414
Like my car broke down,
my parents own a lake house,

236
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,666
I'm 18.

237
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,670
You-You're not a senior?

238
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,714
Not in high school.

239
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,176
- Now go.

Dude, you make it too easy.
It's not funny.

What the heck
happened to the dish?

248
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,047
I can't do a week here
without TV.

Please tell me
you see that too.
Not sure I want to.

Say it with me. "Peace."

What are you talking about?
Read the book. Peace.

not clear enough?

327
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,740
Someone was
obviously distracted.

328
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,076
I was following
the plan.

329
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,078
You were playing
with your little toy.

330
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,498
This is a deadly weapon! It is.
No. These are
deadly weapons.

331
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:36,794
Listen on yourselves.
This is why we lost success
on our mission previous.

332
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,672
Not looking to blame throw,
but that one was Razor's fault.

333
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:44,343
- What? You were the one—
- If we lose success this time,
I lose my command.

334
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,429
Now, you're going to learn
to work together...

335
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,724
or we will together
end up shoveling manure
back in Sector 7.

336
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,809
We won't
let you down, sir.

337
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,312
Let's go enslave
some humans!

338
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:58,691
Actually, uh, about that,
I'm sure enslaving is plenty of fun.

339
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,776
But why the hu-mans?
What?

340
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,987
They don't seem
that bad.
Aw. Rookie.

341
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,281
Oh, "they don't
seem that bad."

342
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,909
Funny. That's what
our engineer previous said.
Engineer previous?

343
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,580
Right before the creature
that was "not that bad" ate him!

344
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,124
[Groans]
The humans are vicious.

345
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,753
Peace is not an option.

346
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,131
[Ringing]
[Slurping]

347
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,967
[Ringing Continues]
Sheriff here.

348
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,428
Uh, th-there's an alien invasion
at our rental house.

349
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,057
- Knee-high beings. Very violent.
- Knee-high. Like a hobbit?

350
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,184
No. Real. Look,
I know this sounds crazy,

351
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,228
but you gotta understand—
Okay, yeah, listen, son.

352
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:40,358
You do know making a fraudulent
complaint is a federal offense.
It's punishable—

353
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,360
[Line Clicks]
Hello?

354
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,570
[Electricity Zaps]
Hmm.

355
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,740
Decent technique...
for a female.

356
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,116
[Groans]
[Grunts]

357
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,451
How's that technique?
[Chuckles]

358
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,870
- Hello?
- [Dial Tone]

359
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,456
We gotta tell our parents.
[Thud]

360
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,336
[Thumping]

361
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,812
[Hannah Screams]

362
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,109
Think he's still
an alien zombie?

363
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,991
- You are useless.
- [Hannah Whimpers]

364
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,412
Why aren't the mind-control
plugs working?
You're the engineer.

365
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,664
Figure it out.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

366
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,707
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Fix it!
[Grunts]

367
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,293
Fix it.
Fix it now, you idiot.
He's not talking to us, right?

368
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:45,548
I think he's picking up
their conversation.
They had, like, a Bluetooth.

369
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,758
What do you mean
their hormone levels
are too unstable?

370
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,802
Are you telling me
the plugs only work
on mature subjects?

371
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,179
Why did we not
plan for this?

372
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,348
You have failed me,
you incompetent piece of...

373
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,976
- Deck.
- Translation not available.

374
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,021
These humans will pay!

375
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,943
[Body Hits Ground]
Did you hear that?

376
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,070
Yeah. Sounds like Ricky
landed on his face.

377
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,866
No. Those things they shot at us,
they-re-they're mind-control plugs.

378
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,578
They won't work on kids.
It's like you said.
We're wired differently.

379
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,080
Wha-What about Ricky?
It tagged him
and he's Bethany's age.

380
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,499
No. He lied. The tool's in college.

381
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,460
So if their plugs
don't work on kids—

382
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,503
That means we're safe.
It means we can fight 'em.

383
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,965
It means they'll
go after our parents.
They're walking targets.

384
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,092
We got
to tell 'em. Now.

385
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,511
Whoa, whoa.
Wait. Think.

386
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,140
If our parents even go
near those things, they'll
get zapped and end up zombies.

387
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,434
Our own parents will attack us.

388
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,313
We need the police and
their hard-core firepower.
Oh, armed zombies. Even better.

389
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:47,151
- We're done. Game over.
- Game over for the grown-ups.
But we can still fight back.

390
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,987
So you expect us to stop
an alien invasion on our own?

391
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,073
He's right.
We're the only option.

392
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,159
But we can't tell anyone.

393
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,912
No police, no parents,
no exceptions.

394
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,247
Got it?
Hannah?

395
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
They're up in the attic
right now, little aliens.

396
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:10,216
They're loud and scary
and really mean.

397
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,595
- Han, there's
no such things as aliens.
- Yes, there is. I saw them.

398
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,182
They smashed the skylight
and tried to break the attic stairs.

399
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,144
Well, let's hope not for your sake.
We put a huge deposit on this place.

400
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,480
So you boys better
keep it in one piece.

401
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,815
- You heard her, Tom.
No more trouble.
- It was just a video game.

402
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,528
We shouldn't have let her watch.
It's rated "T" for "Teen."
It's teen violence.

403
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,448
Tommy, I'm scared.
I don't like the mean aliens.

404
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:39,537
Don't worry, Han.
Just pretend it's a big game,
a game that we're gonna win.

405
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,207
- Just think about
how little they are.
- Little and deadly.

406
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,126
- [Art]
What do we do now?
- We figure out their weakness.

407
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,338
They flew here from another galaxy.
You really think they have a weakness?

408
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,550
First rule
of the warrior code—

409
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,593
All enemies have a weakness.

410
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,347
Sparks, why isn't
my locator map up and running?

411
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,350
I told you.
I need parts to repair it.
You're not helping—

412
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,102
[Electrical Surge]
[Yells]

413
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,192
- Aha! Even on Earth,
the male is dominant.
- Ah.

414
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,736
[Grunting]
[Tazer]
Aha. Oh.

415
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,823
- Wait.
- Ah. But the female
always wins.

416
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,033
What the...

417
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,453
By the rings of Zirkon.

418
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,747
Huh? That makes no sense.

419
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,251
They were fighting.
Now their lips are hugging?

420
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,295
I would never.
Never.

421
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,672
Ne-ver.
Oh, I'm sorry.

422
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,550
Can I get you anything?
A cold drink?
Some snacks? Hmm?

423
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,220
Or would you rather
help me invade a planet?
[Grunts]

424
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,851
All right,
recon's my specialty.
I'm going up.

425
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,903
- I'm coming with you.
- Tom, be careful.

426
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,702
[Squeaking]
Enemy... apprehended.

427
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,789
- [Clears Throat]
I'll interrogate.
- Ah!

428
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,001
[Crunching]
[Rat Squeaks]

429
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,545
- [Belches]
- [Both Groan]

430
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,798
Ah. Disgusting.
What? Seriously, what?

431
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,800
Locator activated, sir.

432
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,303
Excellent.
Target the objective.

433
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,139
Zoom in. Zoom.

434
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:26,268
Zoom.
Zoom, zoom, zoom.

435
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:31,440
- [Sparks] You don't have
to keep saying "zoom."
- Zoom. Zoom.

436
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,442
And... rotate.

437
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,944
[Tom]
I think they're after
something in the house.

438
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,280
Let me get a better look.
Stop.

439
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:43,160
- [Yells, Grunts]
- Rotate. Ah.
The basement.

440
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,038
- Tom, help me!
- Ah.

441
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,708
[Both Yelling]

442
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,003
- That must have hurt.
- [Groans]

443
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,714
Basement.
We gotta get to the basement.

444
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,675
Ricky?

445
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,677
Ricky!

446
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,263
Oh. Hey, guys, wait.
Have you guys seen Ricky?

447
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,558
Uh, pretty sure he's still
hanging around here
somewhere.

448
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,103
Actually, Beth, uh—
He didn't leave, did he?

449
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,314
No, no. He, um—
He told us he was
heading back to the lake,

450
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,234
uh, to, bronze up
his rock-hard abs.

451
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,528
Yeah, he wants you
to meet him there.
Wait.

452
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,239
What did you guys
talk about on the roof?

453
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,241
Did he say anything about me?

454
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,327
No. No, no. He—
He talked about his car.

455
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:29,206
And, um—
But pre-pretty much
just his car.

456
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,542
Um, but you should hit
the lake so he doesn't think
you're blowing him off.

457
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,670
Yeah, the lake.
Over there.
It's probably good there.

458
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,344
I'm telling you,
their map led down here.
You positive?

459
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,931
Shh. You hear that?
Rice Krispies.

460
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,351
[Popping, Crackling]

461
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:53,480
[Popping, Crackling Continue]

462
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,905
[Crackling]
What is that?

463
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,616
[Crackling Continues]

464
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,120
It's them.

465
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,958
Something down here's
setting it off.

466
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,765
Well, whatever it is,
we can't let 'em
get to it.

467
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,350
Everyone, gear up.
We move on my command.

468
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,519
Now, just hold on.

469
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,607
If we run up there
with a bunch of random junk,
we're gonna get creamed.

470
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,026
We can make something better.

471
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,278
We're in the middle of a battle,
and you wanna play science fair?

472
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,531
No way.
We're going back in now...

473
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,034
before our parents
end up as alien zombies.

474
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,411
You're not thinking.
We need a plan.

475
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,372
I already have
a great idea for a weapon.
Really?

476
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,792
[Chuckles]
Let's go.

477
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,877
Now.

478
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,552
Hannah,
hand me that tape.

479
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,514
What's up, Nate?
[Lee]
Hey, guys!

480
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,557
[Art]
Hey, Nana!
Who wants a treat?

481
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:15,562
[Laughs] Whoo.
That's a lot of tools
to try to fix the TV.

482
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,617
[Thumping]

483
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,495
They're busting through.
The warrior code says
strike first.

484
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,873
Art, cover me.
With the rake?

485
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:44,299
[Yelling]

486
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,970
How do you feel now?
Suckers!

487
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,098
Mission accomplished.

488
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,689
Oh, God.

489
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,065
- Oh—
- Crud.

490
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,320
[Laughs]
It's a dud.

491
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,281
[Whirring]

492
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,158
What the— Whoa!

493
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,369
- Whoa! What's happening?
- Why are we floating?

494
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,581
They turned off the gravity,
like in Halo.

495
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:19,710
This isn't Xbox, Lee.
It's real. Like Wii.

496
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,714
[Lee]
Now what are we gonna do?
[Art] I don't know.

497
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,842
Stay behind me.

498
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,304
- No! Don't! Don't!
- [Lee] There's no gravity.

499
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,352
Hello, hu-mans.
[Laughs]

500
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,105
Enjoying the ride?

501
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,190
[Grunts, Yells]

502
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,110
[Art]
They have gravity boots.

503
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,821
- [Lee] Why don't
we have gravity boots?
- "They have gravity boots."

504
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,199
[Jake]
The door! Stop 'em!
Use your weapon, Tom!

505
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,493
- Bring it, meat sack.
- [Jake] Today!

506
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:59,207
A potato gun?
That's your big idea?

507
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:03,128
- My plan is working.
- My plan. You mean my plan.

508
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,049
Hurry, Tommy!

509
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,556
Oh!

510
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,227
[Grunts, Coughing]

511
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,648
[Coughing Continues]

512
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,068
Ooh.
[Yelps]

513
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,613
- [Coughing]
You okay?
- I'm fine. The door.

514
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,615
On it.

515
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,867
Jake, get the grenade!

516
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,997
- Ah.
- Hurry!

517
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,212
Quick! Toss it here!

518
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,009
- What? [Yells, Grunts]
- Oh!

519
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,764
[Screams]
Sock Monkey.

520
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,308
Oh! Ha!

521
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,435
You little—

522
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,104
Quick! Get 'em!

523
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,772
Go!
[Grunts]

524
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,650
- [Art]
Shoot him! Shoot him!
- [Lee] Go, go, go!

525
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:10,028
- [Art]
Shoot him!
- Ouch! Ow! Ouch again!

526
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,614
- Buttocks on fire!
- [Panting]

527
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,119
Whoa. That's the thing
they used to control Ricky.

528
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,163
- Whoa!
- [Beeps]

529
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,625
Oh, cool. Let me see it.
Oh, nice action
on the toggles.

530
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,630
Wait. What are these?
Give it back. Let me see.

531
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,883
- I picked it up first.
- [Back Cracks]
- Give it back.

532
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,386
It's mine.
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
This is not a toy. It's real.

533
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,430
[Thud]

534
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,603
- [Jake] Ricky?
- Yep.

535
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,772
Get him before
somebody finds him.
I'll stand alien watch.

536
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,870
I'm sure that'll
buff right out.
[Laughs]

537
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,205
Wonder where he went.

538
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,167
Oh, I'll find him.
[Beeps, Whirring]

539
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,504
Whoa.

540
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,841
[Chuckling]

541
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,183
Cool. So these move him.
And these...
operate the arms.

542
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,816
- Talk about the ultimate Game Boy.
- [Slapping]

543
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:35,322
- [Laughing]
- What does that big button do?

544
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,872
Whoa! What the—

545
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,833
My car!
[Beeps]

546
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,253
That would be
the on-and-off button.

547
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,798
- Press it again.
- [Beeps]

548
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,674
Car!

549
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:59,346
Who did this to my car?
You did,
you giant idiot.

550
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,056
[Beeps]
[Bethany]
Ricky!

551
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,268
- Where have you been?
- [Beeps]

552
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,438
Oh, shut up,
you little b— Bethany.

553
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,816
- What?
- Ah!

554
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,152
- Why are you hitting me?
- Why are you being such a jerk?

555
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,655
- Huh?
- Revenge is so sweet.

556
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,449
I just spent the last hour
walking around the lake.
Where were you?

557
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,911
- Uh— l—
- That's what I thought.

558
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,455
No. L-I don't know.
[Laughs]

559
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,457
Want me to bring him back?
Babe, please don't
be mad at me.

560
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,043
[Bethany] Did your brain
fall out of your head?
Let him suffer.

561
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,015
Where's Ricky?
Taken prisoner
by the aliens?

562
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,561
No. Worse. My sister.

563
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,064
Any action up here?

564
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,568
It's been quiet.
Too quiet.

565
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,530
[Thumping]
[Skip]
No talking in here. Got it?

566
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,451
What are they doing
in the vents?

567
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,581
Their map. That's how
they'll get to the basement.
What do we do?

568
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,797
I hope this works,
Einstein.

569
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,843
I didn't get to thank you
for pulling me to safety back there,

570
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,845
because I didn't need you to.

571
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,347
Uh, that doesn't
make sense.
I don't like you.

572
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,433
Shh. Stop talking.
Good to know.
Okay.

573
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,022
[Grunts]
Hmm?

574
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,316
Hmm. Sweating?

575
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,236
[Sizzles]
[Grunts]
Hot! Ah!

576
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,072
Hot! Hot! Hotter! Run!

577
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,200
[All Yelling]

578
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,161
Fall back! Fall back!
Ouch! Ouch!

579
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,121
[All Yelling]

580
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,290
Sounds like they're mad.
[Yelling]

581
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,918
Nice job.
I think it's working.

582
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,086
[Stuart]
Kids, get down here right now!

583
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,175
Who turned
on the heat?

584
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,344
I did.
Um, we need that on.

585
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,262
Are you crazy? It's July.

586
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,390
Yeah, but it's...
it's freezing in here.
Ooh, yeah. Ooh, Arctic.

587
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,809
Yeah. I think Hannah's
coming down with something.

588
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,145
[Coughing]

589
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,189
What's going on?

590
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:18,026
We're fighting aliens.
I'm pretending it's pretend.

591
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,403
I mean, it is pretend.

592
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,658
Okay, but I'm not pretending,
so don't touch the thermostat.

593
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,744
Tom, I'm not
playing around.
Neither am I.

594
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,956
Tom, I'm not kidding.
You wanna spend the rest
of the week in your room?

595
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,124
Why can't you at least trust
there's a reason I'm doing this?

596
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,669
A reason why you're
blasting the furnace
on summer vacation?

597
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,587
Yes.
A reason why you shot
your sister's boyfriend?

598
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,465
- Yes.
- A reason why you're talking
back, giving me attitude?

599
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,552
Failing your classes?
So that's what this is about?

600
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,515
I failed them on purpose.

601
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,600
Yeah, I tanked my grades, okay?

602
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,727
I'm tired of getting picked on
because I'm a brainiac.

603
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,729
I was a brainiac.
It worked for me.

604
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,358
I don't wanna be like you.
I wanna be cool.

605
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,616
Don't touch
the thermostat.

606
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,707
Is that true?
You really fail
on purpose?

607
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,334
Nobody likes a mathlete.

608
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,878
Man, we can't fight these things
with our parents around.

609
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,298
We can’t just get
rid of 'em.

610
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,385
Maybe we can.
Here's what I want you to do.

611
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,351
Send it.

612
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,732
I hate it when we fight.
Aw, I can't fight
someone as cute as you.

613
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,692
Well, I'm glad we made up.

614
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,570
Well, it's not an official make-up
without the make-up kiss.

615
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,157
Easy. My family's up there.
And your family's crazy about me.

616
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,909
What about you?
Well, you know I like you.

617
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,329
And we have
the whole summer
ahead of us.

618
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,040
Maybe we don't have
to go so fast.

619
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,250
What? What?

620
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,045
[Screams]

621
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,009
Is that a "no"?

622
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:11,848
Ricky!

623
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,186
Careful.
Don't break him.
Ricky!

624
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,813
Better grab his shirt.
Ricky!

625
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,401
[Lee]
Still no sign of 'em.

626
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,241
Where are they?
Two options.

627
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,953
We're dealing with a retreat
or a surprise attack.

628
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:41,211
[Laughs, Snarls]

629
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,963
- [Gasps]
- Surprise attack.

630
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,972
Hey, where's Tom?
I thought he was
gonna help you.

631
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,809
So did I.
[Ricky]
Bad news.

632
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,186
The leasing office called.

633
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,314
They need you to go back there
before they close for the holidays.

634
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,359
- Really?
- Problem with the contract.

635
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,736
They insisted.

636
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,072
Ricky, are you okay?

637
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,741
Oh, um— Um—

638
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,411
- Just allergies, Mr. P.
- Just allergies, Mr. P.

639
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,122
But they did say it's urgent.

640
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,667
Urgent?
Ah. Okay, I'll call
and I'll sort this out.

641
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,545
That's so weird.

642
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:30,468
Oh, this is weird, Stu.
I think the phone's dead.

643
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,181
Did they just
cut off our power?

644
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,642
Oh, they are gonna
hear about it from me.

645
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,687
Let's go. We are
going down there right now.

646
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,231
Hey, guys, uh, we can use
some more beer, some chips.

647
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,942
Why don't you run
to the grocery store?
I'll fire up the grill.

648
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,028
- And watch the kids?
- Okay, whatever.
[Chuckles]

649
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,406
- No.
- No.

650
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,701
I mean,
you all have to go.

651
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,037
They said all your names
are on the lease.

00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,149
Someone's gotta
get the door.

824
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,486
- We can't let the cops in here.
It's too dangerous.
- Here's Nana!

825
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,656
Hey! Leave my Nana alone!
Silence, squeaky-voiced
human child!

826
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,033
[Gasps]

827
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,035
I got Nana's controller!

828
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,539
Free me! Free me,
or face the consequence!

829
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:11,001
In here.
You don't trap me!
I trap you! Why, you—

830
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,214
Shake all you want.
We own you.
[Grunting]

831
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,552
The suitcase! Go!

832
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,389
[Karate Yell]

833
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,974
Ha! You missed me.

834
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,810
Stand still, Earth burgers!
[Gasping]

835
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,562
Ha! Got him!

836
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,314
[Hannah]
Don't let 'em take
Snuggle Lump!

837
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,441
[Lee]
Art, wait!

838
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:37,153
- [Tazer]
Shoot him! Shoot the humans!
- [Jake] Incoming!

839
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,447
- [Tazer] Shoot 'em up!
- [Jake] Hit the deck!

840
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:45,119
- You lose.
- [Razor] Zirkon forever!

841
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,249
I'm sorry, Hannah.
I'm sorry. They got him.

842
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,794
- Sweet, huh?
- Very nice.

843
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,255
This is the Creek Landing
Sheriff's Department.

844
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,134
Open this door at once,
or I will begin forcible entry...

845
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,094
in 10, nine,

846
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,598
eight, seven, six...
You guys get rid of the cop.
I'm going after the aliens.

847
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,850
Five, four—

848
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,895
- We can't leave him up here.
- Two, one.

849
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:14,523
I don't know how much you kids
know about penal codes,

850
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,068
but making phone calls
with the intent to annoy
or harass is a serious offense.

851
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,947
It's called criminal mischief.
And it could mean six months in jail.

852
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,034
911 is for
emergency calls only.

853
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:29,121
- Any misuse of this system
compromises this county's...
- Oh, weapons.

854
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,374
Only line of defense,
and that's me.

855
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,585
Around here, I am the law.

856
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:38,172
Literally, I'm the only one.
My deputy's on maternity leave.

857
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:41,508
Look, Sheriff, we told you we're sorry.
It won't happen again.

858
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,510
So, really,
you can leave now.
We'll be good.

859
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:47,014
Oh, I can leave? Okay, we got
the whole problem solved.

860
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,436
Hey, what's that there?
[Device Beeping]

861
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,481
Squadron, come in. Come in.
Do you have Sparks?

862
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:59,026
No.
Ah! Is there any job
you two can't screw up?

863
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,862
[Groans]
Come in!

864
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,365
I'm sorry. I apologize.
That was uncalled for.

865
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:08,285
You're still trapped
in that box, aren't you?
Yes, I am.

866
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,413
- Step aside, young man.
- No need for that.

867
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:16,085
It's just my sister's robot dog.
It's sound activated. Right, Han?

868
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,837
Right. It's not an alien.

869
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,090
Mm-hmm.

870
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:25,177
You know what? I'm gonna take
a look inside that chest,
so please step aside.

871
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,184
[Horn Honking]

872
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:40,651
It's the po-po. Be cool.

873
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,281
One hour. We're gone one hour.
What happened?
What'd you kids do?

874
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,741
Hi. Nina Pearson.
Are you kids okay?

875
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,119
Is everything okay?
[Sheriff]
No, ma'am.

876
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:54,957
I'd say making a fraudulent call
to 911 about an alien invasion
is most definitely not okay.

877
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,251
- You called 911?
- [Nate] Come on, buddy.

878
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:01,088
I'm sure you can let
these kids off with a warning.
Look at 'em.

879
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,590
One, not your buddy.

880
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:07,219
Two, notice that your vehicle
is missing a front license plate.

881
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,556
- Three, how about
I write you up a ticket?
- How about you don't?

882
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,683
Nate, stop talking.

883
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,811
You people usually leave
your children unsupervised
like this?

884
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,939
No. No, not at all.
We had to go into town
to the leasing office.

885
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,025
They shut our power off.

886
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,360
[Sheriff]
Looks all right to me.

887
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,488
[Nina] Sheriff, I know
this isn't something
to be taken lightly,

888
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,615
but honestly,
they are really good kids.

889
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,827
Why don't you stay
and see for yourself?
We're barbecuing.

890
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,204
- Join us.
- Mom—

891
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,498
Thank you, ma'am.
I'd like to, but I am on duty.

892
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:40,878
Look. The kids made a big
mistake. And I assure you,
Tom will be punished.

893
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,881
But my wife is right.
We got plenty of great food.
Why don't you stick around?

894
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:47,551
I know you're on the job,
but there's no law against
a home-cooked meal.

895
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:52,389
Got lots of hot dogs,
hamburgers, steaks and—

896
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,516
[Tazer]
Hmm.

897
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,853
Okay.

898
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,483
[Growls]
[Neck Muscles Crack]

899
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,401
I have to admit,
it has been a while.

900
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,820
- All right.
Arm successfully twisted.
- [Stuart] Great.

901
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,531
I guess an hour off
won't kill anyone.

902
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,784
- No.
- [Laughs]

903
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,078
Gotcha.

904
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,871
Hey!
Huh?
[Grunts]

905
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:18,332
[Laughs]
Oh.

906
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,292
What was that?

907
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,836
- What was what?
- I don't know. I felt something.

908
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,838
- Come on, everyone. Dinner.
- Let me help you with the bags.

909
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,799
Inside.
I've got the desserts.

910
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:32,304
[Grunting]

911
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,807
- You're going down, punk!
- You're going down, punk.

912
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,850
I just said that.
I just said that.

913
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,937
- Stop that.
- Stop that.

914
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,647
[Laughs]

915
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,651
You've been punked.
[Laughs]

916
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,823
Hail Zirkonia.
[Grunts]
Ow!

917
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,540
Okay, now hold on, Mom.
I'm not following.
Now, what happened?

918
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,792
One moment
I'm cleaning my chompers,

919
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:05,087
and then the next thing
you know, I'm down here.

920
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,006
[Nina] You know,
you're entitled to a few
senior moments at your age.

921
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,384
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forgot.
Did you want cheese on your burger?

922
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:14,888
No. I want to find whoever invented love
and hack him apart with a machete.

923
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,602
Boy trouble.
That makes two of us.

924
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:25,566
- I don't know what to do
about this Tom situation.
- We have a guest. Happy face.

925
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,986
- Hey, Nate, where's Jake?
- I have no idea.

926
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,780
[Stuart]
Well, dinner's almost ready.
How about you track him down?

927
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,701
Jake's an adult.
If he wants to eat,
he'll come down and get it.

928
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,537
Oh, sorry.
That will raise welts.

929
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,541
Excuse us.
No. Pardon me. Oops.
Watch your head.

930
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,334
Mmm-mmm-mm.

931
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,129
I tell you, there's nothing
more American than
a charred chunk of meat...

932
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,089
hittin' your stomach.
[All Chuckle]

933
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,133
I bought the pickles.
Oh, really?

934
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:55,179
If you think a dill spear
is gonna get you out
of that ticket, it's a no-go, mister.

935
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,723
[Skip Growling]

936
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,061
[Grunting]

937
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,565
Uh—

938
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,693
My stomach. I'm starving.

939
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,779
- [Art] Any word from Jake?
- Still no signal.

940
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,990
- Where is he?
- Hey, boys. None of that at the table.

941
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:18,744
Right, Nate?
They're playing
with their phones.

942
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,413
[Stuart]
Oh, yeah. Slap it on.

943
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:29,129
Hey, Hannah, did you
eat all the hot dogs?

944
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,340
No.
[Sparks Belches]

945
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,592
I mean, yes.

946
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:39,348
[Sheriff] Gotta tell ya,
this sure beats eating
ramen noodles in my squad car...

947
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,226
every day by myself.
[Growls]

948
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,104
[Tazer]
Comfortable up there, Earth boy?

949
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,607
[Razor]
Hope so.
Enjoy some dirt in your face.

950
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,901
[Muffled]
Help!

951
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,948
Attention, all.
Resistance is futile.
Give me what I need.

952
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,784
Oh, baby.
I knew you'd come back.

953
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,744
Step aside,
hormonal female.

954
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,121
Wait.
You're calling me hormonal?

955
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,208
Back away.
You are irrelevant
to my mission.

956
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,960
Irrelevant?

957
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,338
I don't care how old you are.
You can't talk to me like that!

958
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,757
What is going on?

959
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,425
Teen drama. L-I think.

960
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,844
It is teen drama,
right, Ricky?

961
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,763
- Snuggles!
- [Lee] Turn him off.

962
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,558
- It's not me.
- [Hannah] Snuggles!

963
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,811
- Let's move. Bring Nana.
- Whoa, whoa. Freeze.

964
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,732
- You kids have not been excused.
- [Beeps]

965
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,151
Let them go!

966
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:37,906
We're playin' a game,
Uncle Stu— I mean, Stu.

967
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:42,035
We're on vacation.
Am I aging backwards?

968
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,665
Yeah, I don't think so.
You really want to deny me
my time with the kids?

969
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,335
[Sighs]
Wow. Guilt never gets old.
Well, go ahead.

970
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,801
I think we oughta keep Mom
out of the pinot grigio.

971
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,319
[Gulps]

972
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:19,990
You have lost. And now
the invasion shall begin.

973
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,492
Invasion? You mean there's
more of you guys coming?

974
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:26,330
Many more. And we
will crush you like bugs.

975
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,125
- Not if we crush you first.
- I will not be beaten by children.

976
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:35,172
Any more signs of resistance,
and the one you call Jake
will be eliminated.

977
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:39,009
- I want Snuggle Lump back!
- That's it.

978
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,053
Time to die.

979
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:45,057
- [Whirs, Beeps]
- Richard?

980
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,142
You remember Nana.

981
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,686
Game on.

982
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,897
Game over.
[Knuckles Cracking]

983
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:57,944
Wow.

984
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:17,464
- Whoa! What was that move?
- Double right-thumb click
with a left-panel twist.

985
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,425
Chinese get up!

986

- [Growls]
- [Object Rattling]

987
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,099
He's on the light!
Send Nana after him!

988
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,771
- Nana!
- Lee! Flying's your specialty.

989
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,449
[Gasps]

990
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,128
Ooh. Take him out, Lee.

991
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,256
- Thumb cramp. Thumb cramp!
- Give it to me.

[Ricky Screams]

994
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,986
- Ricky?
- What the—

995
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,658
Nana?

[Screams]

998
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,463
Yes, scream, human,
for your species ends tonight.

999
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,841
[Laughs]

1000
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,260
What the heck was that thing?

1001
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:48,722
Space alien.
Too much to explain.

1002
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:51,600
We think they're probably here
to destroy the world
as we know it.

1003
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,561
If we don't get down there,
we're gonna be in real trouble.

1004
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:57,022
[Nina] I'd say that's
the understatement
of the century.

1005
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,067
- Mom? Are you okay?
- [Remote Beeps]

1006
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:08,116
What— What happened?
How— How did I get—

1007
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,869
Oh, I need a glass of water.
Uh—

1008
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,580
Okay. Somebody better
start talking.

1009
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:17,501
It looks like you guys had
a battle royal in here.

1010
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,003
- We did. Nana versus Ricky.
- Not now, Hannah.

1011
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:23,173
- Dad, it's not what it looks like.
- All of you, upstairs, now.

1012
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:26,051
- But, Uncle Stu, it wasn't our fault.
- Now.

1013
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,765
Get up.

1014
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:35,435
Okay, unless
you wanna join them,
you better spill it.

1015
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,687
What the heck happened
in here?

1016
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,856
I haven't got a clue
as to what happened,

1017
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:43,443
but my back hasn't
felt this good in ages.

1018
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,864
[Stuart]
Mom? Mom? Where you goin'?

1019
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,075
Aliens.

1020
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,711
Build machine... now.

1021
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,922
No.

01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,432
[Tom]
I'm sorry, guys.

1024
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,644
It's over.

1025
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,188
Over?
It better not be over.

1026
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:25,360
Ricky is down in the basement
with that... space rodent.

1027
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:28,822
You don't get it.
An entire fleet of those guys
are about to invade.

1028
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,032
Well, man up and deal with it.

1029
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,785
I have been... all day.

1030
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,955
Well, if he's too scared,
maybe you guys can help me.

1031
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,625
- Not without Tom.
- Why?

1032
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,252
'Cause he's our leader.

1033
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:48,717
Come on. It's not just Ricky.
Jake needs your help too.

1034
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,802
And Snuggles.

1035
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,805
And, like,
everyone on Earth,
including our parents.

1036
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,233
All right.

1037
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,986
Let's go save the planet.

1038
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,157
And your dumb old boyfriend.

1039
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,856
You want Monkey?
He's good luck.

1040
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,526
I'm fine.
[Banging]

1041
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,448
[Tom]
Stay close.

1042
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:56,201
They could be anywhere.

1043
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,734

1044
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,654

[Grunts]
It's Jake!

1046
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:39,911
Those Zirkonians...
They tied me up
and dragged Snuggles outside.

1047
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,871
This vacation really sucks.

1048
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,833
You see the machine?
Yeah. You were right.
It was sent here years ago.

1049
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:47,002
Some idiot built this place
smack on top of it.

1050
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,421
Guys? Guys, I found Ricky.

1051
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,923
He's waking up.
Where in the heck am I?

1052
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,093
Oh, baby, I'm so glad
you're okay.

1053
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:58,263
Whoa! Don't touch me!

[Mutters]

1055
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,891
Stop.
Okay, okay.

1056
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:06,438
I know it's been a really weird day,
but you have to let me explain.

1057
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,733
Okay. Okay.

1058
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:13,445
Explain to me why I keep blacking out,
why I'm bleeding...

1059
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:17,949
and why your grandma
did a flying ninja kick
on my face down the stairs.

1060
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,118
Okay.

1061
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,288
We're fighting,
um, space aliens.

1062
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,873
Yeah. Yeah.

1063
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:28,793
Okay, they're small,
but dangerous and—
and really scary.

1064
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,296
Oh, no. Of course. I believe you.
Why wouldn't they be?

1065
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,425
Why do you want to waste
our time playing hide-and-seek
and kill the aliens...

1066
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,969
with your stupid brother
and your dumb little cousins?

1067
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,641
Don't talk about
my family like that.

1068
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:47,270
Well, you don't have to worry
about it anymore 'cause we're done.

1069
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:50,940
I knew I should have stayed home
and hooked up with Annie Filkins.

1070
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:54,319
She's smokin' hot,
and she doesn't like talking
about feelings all the time.

1071
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,822
I'm goin' straight to Annie's.

1072
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:03,328
Ow.

1073
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,293
I'm really sorry.

1074
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:13,213
Don't be.
You were right all along.

1075
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:17,342
If it's any consolation,
he's not going straight to Annie's.

1076
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,344
Or anywhere for a while.

1077
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,763
Wow.

1078
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:24,849

this sibling bonding.
We're at DEFCON 1 here.

[Art]
Oh, my God.
They're forcing him to build it.

1082
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:43,368
Build what?
How do you take over
the world with that thing?

1083
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,621
I really don't want
to find out. We gotta stop
them before their fleet arrives.

1084
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:49,499
- Fleet?
- This is just the advance team.

1085
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:52,252
- We have to rescue
Snuggle Lump.
- Snuggle what?

1086
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:55,380
Lump. The foreign fella.
He's on our side.

1087
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,424
The other three...
not so much.

1088
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,928
- This is so not happening.
- We gotta get out there.
Let's move.

1089
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:06,933
Not so fast. I have a plan.
Work with me here.
Did Nana give anyone Mentos?

1090
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,935
Why?
Hand 'em over!

1091
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:12,188
- What, we're gonna
throw candy at them?
- No.

1092
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,566
My own little
science project.

1093
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,283
Mentos bomb.
You're a genius.

1094
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,118
You shouldn't do this.

Whoa!

[Grunting]

1099
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,424
- Snuggles!
- Traitor.

1100
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:45,972
Release me.
Never mess with a girl
who just got dumped.

1101
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,603
He's out cold.

1102
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,230
- You!

1107
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:13,249
How do you feel now?
Weakness...
We found their weakness!

1108
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,753
It's their own death ray.
Yes!

1109
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:21,049
Bad. Not sweet.
So not sweet.

1110
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,389
Hey! Humans.
[Hannah]
Hey, listen.

1111
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:33,311
The machine molecule expands.
Machine make commander big.

Who's little now, Earth maggots?

1114

- Pretty cool, huh?
- You're gonna need a bigger potato.

1115
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,576
It's over. I win.

1116
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,621
- [Art] Where's he going?
- Anywhere he wants.

1117

Tom will figure it out.

Everyone, listen.
We don't have much time.

1120
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,349
Sparks, can anything
go on that machine?
Theoretically.

1121
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,685
Good. Art, Lee,
I'm gonna need a controller.

1122
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,104
Bethany, I need you to keep
the other aliens on lockdown.
Okay.

Jake, come on.

1125
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,569
This battle's not over yet.
Awesome.

1126
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,657
There.

1127
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:30,201
Cool. He super-sized it.

1128
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,663
You are one ugly alien.

1129

[Banging]
[Grunts]

1130
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,502
He may be ugly, but he's mine.

1131
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,587
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

1132
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,719
We need a clean shot
at his neck.
I'm goin' up.

1133
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:58,062
- Ow! You broke my nail!
- I don't care.

[Laughs]

1136
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:13,411
- Ah!
- Oh, my gosh. They're beacons.

1137
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,413
He's calling the invasion.

1138
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,083
[Stuart]
Wow.

1139
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,711
[Stuart]
Unbelievable.
[Nana] Look at this.

1140
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:25,673
God bless America.
Now that's what
I call a patriot act.

1141
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,885
It's not bad, but it's nothin'
compared to this.

1142
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:32,930
Whoa, whoa.
Those are category-three
pyrotechnics you got there.

1143
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,058
I suppose that's another ticket.

1144
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:39,812
Light 'em up.
Let's put that guy to shame.

I got it! Tom! Tom, I found it.

1146
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,198

Hey! Down here,
you prehistoric space scum!

1148
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,752
[Sheriff]
Ooh.
[Stuart] Nice one, Nate.

1149
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:07,965
That was awesome!
Those things only cost $ 1.99.
Can you believe it?

1150
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,386
I don't think
that's you, Nate.
What is that?

1151
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:15,973
It's them.
They'll all be coming soon.

1152
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,601
Open your eyes, people.

1153
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:21,437
There's only one answer...
meteor shower.

1154
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:25,525
Oh, that's right.
I heard on the radio.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1155
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:28,820
- [Screams]
- [Groans]

1156
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,074
[Grunts]
Is that all ya got?

1157
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,328
[Grunts]
Hey.
Come on!

1158
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,957
Tom! Take the shot!

1159
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,836
Shoot him!
His collar's still in the way.

1160
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,423
- Look out!
The ugly one got big!
- [Groaning]

1161
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:52,593
- Hurry. Do it, Tom!
- Fifty yards.

1162
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:56,848
Angle equals one-half arc sine
of gravity times distance
over velocity squared.

1163
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,225
Forty-five degrees.

1164
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,727
What was that?

1165
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,813
[Grunts]

1166
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,983
You messed with
the wrong mathlete.

1167
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,702
Yes.
Get him away from him.

1168
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,121
Commander.
Hey, wait a second.

1169
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,417
Take that.

1170
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,503
- Puny humans,
is that all you have?
- Whoa, he's good.

1171
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,426
No, you don't.

1172
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,762
You see that?

1173
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,891
Sparks! Reverse the machine.

1174
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:43,478
[Shouts]

1175
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:47,273
[Tazer Laughs]
[Beeping]

1176
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,112
Too easy.
Uh—

1177
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,617
Nothing's working.
Give it to me.

1178
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:01,245
[Groaning]

1179
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,581
Crude.
But effective.

1180
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,583
That was awesome.
[Laughs]

1181
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:11,255
Reversed.
Tommy, he's done.

1182
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,720
[Screams]

1183
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,312
You came back for me.
Let's go.

1184
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:28,940
We can hug lips
on Zirkon.

1185
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:37,949
- Whoa!
- [All Gasp]

1186
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:41,160
[Hannah]
Bethany!

1187
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:42,787
Hannah, are you okay?
Yeah.

1188
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,248
[Jake] Over here.
Did you guys see that?
Great job, Hannah.

1189
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,876
Snugs was great.
So were you guys.
Tom, what about the others?

1190
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,921
There's so many.

1191
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,676
[Beeps]

1192
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:01,430
Retreat. Retreat.
The machine is destroyed.

1193
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:05,101
We have been outsmarted
by the humans.

1194
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:09,272
The invasion has failed.
Retreat to Zirkon right away.

1195
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:12,483
Retreat. Retreat.

1196
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,152
[Sighs]

1197
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,238
[Tom]
Whoa.

1198
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,785
He's gone.

1199
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:26,455
It's over. It's all over.

1200
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,499
We won.

1201
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,504
Thanks, Snugs,
for everything.

1202
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,674
You're all right
for a space maggot.
I'm gonna miss you.

1203
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:40,344
Miss him?
He's staying here, with us.

1204
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,390
Please don't go.
You can be a part of our family.

1205
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:46,475
[Sighs]

1206
01:16:57,195 --> 01:17:00,573
Han, I think
he's already got a family.

1207
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,994
My family.

1208
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:17,757
[Sighs]
Good-bye, Hannah.

1209
01:18:04,137 --> 01:18:06,180
[Stuart]
Hey.

1210
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:08,265
Hey.

1211
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:15,189
Listen, about your grades—
Dad, let me save you
a lecture.

1212
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:18,067
You were right,
and I was wrong.

1213
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:22,154
Turns out
there are advantages
to being smart.

1214
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:25,574
I'm sorry.

1215
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,537
I had this really
great lecture planned.

1216
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:32,748
Even rehearsed it
in front of the mirror.

1217
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,631
Did you see the meteor shower?

1218
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,967
Yeah. Yeah,
it was life-changing.

1219
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:51,225
Nice cast, Nana.
Hey.

1220
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:54,353
- Whoa, whoa!
Got a bite. Got a bite.
- [Fishing Line Pulling]

1221
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,939
Oh, yeah. Come on.

[Doorbell Chimes]

1227
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:22,047
- Annie!
- Ricky, I thought you were
at your lake house.

1228
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:25,384
- Vacation ended early.
These are for you.
- You're so sweet.

1229
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,511
Hey, you're my girlfriend now.

1230
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,890
So there is nothing
I wouldn't do for you.
Now give papa some—

1231
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:35,144
Hoo-hoo-hoo! Ladies.

1232
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:37,521
It's girls' night out.
But, hey, you should come...

1233
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:41,734
- If you like dancing.
- Dancing?

1234
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,028
[Device Beeps]
You ain't even seen dancing—

1235
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:47,198
Till you've seen funky Ricky.

Wedgie time.

1239

Cannonball.

1240
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,464
I think he's hungry.

[Gasps]

1242
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:08,969
Turn him off.

1243
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:12,681
Ricky, you're acting
really weird.

1244
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,142
- What are you talking about?
- [Gasps]

1245
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,102

Why?

[Woman]
Hey, so strange
You switched in front of me

1252
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:41,710
Hey, you've changed
Not like you used to be

1253

'Cause you get in my head
and hold my heart

When I'm here, you're there
We're worlds apart

1255
01:20:46,132 --> 01:20:50,636
So reverse your words back to the start
and switch back to my world

1256
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:54,890
Hey, you're just talking like a machine

1257
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:59,186

1262
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,831
A crazy intuition

1263
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:22,710
You're off and on
You're here, then gone

1264
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:25,212
Come back

1265
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,423
A curious condition

1266
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:30,759
And then you switch right over

1267
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:32,761
It's weird
Yeah, I know

1268
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:36,432
But just can't get a hold of myself

1269
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:40,644

You're out of this world
I'm sure of it

1280
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:22,102
A little more than different

1281
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:26,815
And you keep lacking
lacking concern for it

1282
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,778
It's you that I am missing

1283
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:33,989

Staring at the stars falling behind you

Across the universe
Hope you'll be back soon

1299

I gotta find a planet for me
I'll rearrange it
