1
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:20,438
Long ago, in the far away land
of ancient Greece...

2
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,315
there was a golden age
of powerful gods...

3
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,152
and extraordinary heroes.

4
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,280
And the greatest and strongest
of all these heroes...

5
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:32,158
was the mighty Hercules.

6
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,994
But what is the measure
of a true hero?

7
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,246
Ah, that is what our story is...

8
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:38,748
Will you listen to him?

9
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,792
He's makin' the story
sound like some Greek tragedy.

10
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,377
Lighten up, dude.

11
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,504
We'll take it from here, darling.

12
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,506
You go, girl.

13
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,052
We are the muses...

14
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,805
goddesses of the arts
and proclaimers of heroes.

15
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,640
Heroes like Hercules.

16
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,684
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules".

17
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,062
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him...

18
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,898
Our story actually begins...

19
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,108
long before Hercules...

20
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,319
many eons ago.

21
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:09,987
Ah

22
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:13,032
Back when the world was new

23
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,868
- Whoa!
- The planet Earth was down on its luck

24
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:22,291
And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok

25
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,294
It was a nasty place

26
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,047
There was a mess
wherever you stepped

27
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:32,843
Where chaos reigned and earthquakes
and volcanoes never slept

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,470
Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!

29
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,055
And then along came Zeus

30
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:39,016
- He hurled his thunderbolt
- He zapped

31
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,561
- Locked those suckers in a vault
- They're trapped

32
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,440
And on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks

33
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,067
And that's the gospel truth

34
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:52,655
The guy was too "Type A"
to just relax

35
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:55,658
- And that's the world's first dish
- Yeah, baby.

36
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,786
Zeus tamed the globe
while still in his youth

37
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,622
Though, honey
it may seem impossible

38
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,917
That's the gospel truth

39
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,336
On Mount Olympus life was neat

40
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,714
And smooth as sweet vermouth

41
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:13,801
Although, honey
it may seem impossible

42
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:20,307
That's the gospel truth

43
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:24,270
- Ah, ah
- Ah

44
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:28,441
- Ah, ah
- Oh, yeah, yeah

45
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:32,486
- Ah, ah
- Hey, hey, hey

46
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,657
- Ah, ah
- Hey, yeah

47
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,766
Hercules!

48
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,977
Behave yourself.

49
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:10,691
Oh, look at this.

50
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,318
Look how cute he is.

51
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,950
Hah! Oh, he's strong...

52
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,994
like his dad, hmm?

53
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,996
Whoa! Excuse me!
Hot stuff coming through!

54
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,248
Excuse me.
One side, Ares.

55
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,919
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.

56
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,338
Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus
do the arrangement.

57
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,840
Isn't that too nutty?

58
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,802
Fabulous party. You know, I haven't
seen this much love in a room...

59
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,346
since Narcissus discovered himself.

60
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,309
Dear, keep those
away from the baby.

61
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,561
Oh, he won't hurt himself.

62
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,106
Let the kid have a little fun.

63
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,326
On behalf of my son,
I want to thank you all...

64
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,371
for your wonderful gifts!

65
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:07,164
What about our gift, dear?

66
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,376
Well, let's see here.
We'll take... Hmm, yes.

67
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:15,047
A little cirrus and, uh, hmm,
a touch of nimbostratus...

68
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,634
and a dash of cumulus.

69
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,766
His name is Pegasus...

70
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,811
and he's all yours, son.

71
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,241
Mind his head.

72
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,201
He's so tiny.

73
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,459
My boy.

74
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:54,337
My little Hercules.

75
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,922
How sentimental.

76
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,676
You know, I haven't been
this choked up...

77
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,596
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat!

78
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:06,057
Huh?

79
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,059
So is this an audience
or a mosaic?

80
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,561
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.

81
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,230
So, Hades,
you finally made it.

82
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,107
How are things
in the underworld?

83
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,027
Well, they're just fine. You know,
a little dark, a little gloomy.

84
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,363
And, as always,
hey, full of dead people.

85
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,616
What are you gonna do? Ah!
There's the little sunspot.

86
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:27,703
Little snootchie. And here is a sucker
for the little sucker.

87
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,538
Eh? Here you go.
You just...

88
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,751
Sheesh!

89
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,045
Uh, powerful little tyke.

90
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:39,590
Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!

91
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:42,134
Hey. Love to, babe...

92
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:45,054
but unlike you gods
lounging about up here...

93
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,556
I regrettably
have a full-time gig...

94
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:51,185
that you, by the way,
so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.

95
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:54,647
So, can't.
Love to, but can't.

96
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:58,484
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.

97
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:01,487
Hah! Work yourself to death!

98
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,324
Oh, I kill myself!

99
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,078
If only. If only.

100
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:13,541
If there's one god you don't want
to get steamed up, it's Hades.

101
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,252
'Cause he had an evil plan.

102
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,881
He ran the underworld

103
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,802
But thought the dead
were dull and uncouth

104
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:28,264
He was as mean
as he was ruthless

105
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,309
And that's the gospel truth

106
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:37,106
He had a plan
to shake things up

107
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:46,615
And that's the gospel truth

108
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,081
Pain!

109
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,168
Coming,
your most lugubriousness. Ow!

110
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:04,133
- Panic!
- Oh, I'm sorry. I can handle it!

111
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,518
- Pain! Oh!
- And Panic!

112
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,687
Reporting for duty!

113
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,149
Fine, fine, fine. Just let me know
the instant the Fates arrive.

114
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,026
Oh. They're here.

115
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:25,529
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?

116
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:31,702
We are worms!
Worthless worms!

117
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,373
Memo to me, memo to me:
maim you after my meeting.

118
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:43,756
Darling, hold that mortal's
thread of life...

119
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,258
good and tight.

120
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,390
Incoming!

121
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,776
Ladies.
I am so sorry that I'm...

122
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,945
- Late!
- We knew you would be.

123
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,197
We know everything.

124
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,449
- Past.
- Present.

125
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,493
And future.

126
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,538
Indoor plumbing.
It's gonna be big.

127
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:18,207
Great, gr... Anyway, see, ladies, I
was at this party and I lost track of...

128
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:22,169
- We know!
- Yeah. I know you know.

129
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,339
So here's the deal. Zeus...

130
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:29,385
Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, You,
Get Off Of My Cloud",... now he has...

131
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,722
- A bouncing baby brat.
- We know!

132
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,599
I know you know!
I know. I got it.

133
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,102
I got the concept.
So let me just ask:

134
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,313
is this kid gonna mess up
my hostile takeover bid, or what?

135
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,941
- What do you think?
- Oh, no you don't.

136
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:47,403
We're not supposed
to reveal the future.

137
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,114
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
Time out. Can I...

138
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,991
Can I ask you a question by the way?
Are you...

139
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:54,452
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.

140
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,954
I mean, you look like a Fate
worse than death.

141
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,708
Oh, gross!

142
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,918
Yech! It's blinkin'!

143
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:08,716
Ladies, please.
My fate...

144
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,968
is in your lovely hands.

145
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,804
- Oh.
- Oh, all right.

146
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,103
In 18 years precisely...

147
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,731
the planets will align...

148
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:27,026
ever so nicely.

149
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,277
Ay, verse. Oy.

150
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:30,988
The time to act
will be at hand.

151
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:35,368
Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.

152
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,869
Mm-hmm. Good, good.

153
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:42,291
Then the once-proud Zeus
will finally fall...

154
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,419
and you, Hades...

155
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,589
will rule all!

156
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,300
Yes! Hades rules!

157
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:55,638
- A word of caution to this tale.
- Excuse me?

158
00:09:55,805 --> 00:10:00,434
Should Hercules fight,
you will fail.

159
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,441
What?

160
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,319
Okay, fine, fine.
I'm cool. I'm fine.

161
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,574
Pain? Panic?
Got a little riddle for ya.

162
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,869
How do you kill a god?

163
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,621
I do not know!

164
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,415
You can't. They're immortal?

165
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,250
Bingo! They're immortal!

166
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:29,046
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot...

167
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,048
mortal.

168
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,288
- Huh?
- Wha... What is it?

169
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:04,248
The baby!

170
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:13,883
Hercules! Oh!

171
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:21,932
No!

172
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,517
Now we did it!

173
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,770
Zeus is gonna use us
for target practice!

174
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,064
Just hang on to the kid, Panic!

175
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:35,112
Hurry! Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, okay?

176
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,407
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.

177
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:43,871
Look at that! He's changing.
Can we do it now?

178
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:47,166
No, no, no. He has to drink
the whole potion.

179
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,419
- Every last drop!
- Who's there?

180
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,260
Alcmene, over here.

181
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:02,348
Oh, you poor thing.

182
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:04,392
- Oh, don't cry.
- Is anybody there?

183
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,769
- Now?
- Now.

184
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:11,232
Oh. Well, he must
have been abandoned.

185
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,901
Amphitryon, for so many years...

186
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,321
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.

187
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,740
Perhaps they've answered
our prayers.

188
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,409
Perhaps they have.

189
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,452
"Hercules"?

190
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,224
Help, help, help!

191
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:47,643
Hades is gonna kill us
when he finds out what happened.

192
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,396
You mean, if he finds out.

193
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:52,940
Of course he's gonna f...

194
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,985
If. If is good.

195
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,741
It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.

196
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,786
But by the time they found the baby,
it was too late.

197
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:10,583
- Young Herc was mortal now
- Mmm

198
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,295
But since he did not drink
the last drop

199
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:17,548
He still retained
his godlike strength

200
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:22,261
- So thank his lucky stars
- Tell it, girl.

201
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:27,266
- But Zeus and Hera wept
- Ooh, ooh, ooh

202
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:31,062
Because their son
could never come home

203
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,814
They'd have to watch
their precious baby

204
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,943
Grow up from a far

205
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,032
Though Hades' horrid plan

206
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,410
Was hatched before Herc
cut his first tooth

207
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:50,748
- Ahh
- The boy grew stronger everyday

208
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:55,044
And that's the gospel truth

209
00:13:55,211 --> 00:14:03,052
The gospel truth

210
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,772
Hercules, slow down!

211
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,778
Look out!

212
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,613
Oops! S-S-sorry, guys!

213
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,949
- Hey, watch where you're goin'!
- Sunday driver!

214
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,122
Thanks, son.

215
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,917
When old Penelope twisted her ankle
back there, I thought we were done for.

216
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:38,295
- No problem, Pop.
- Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.

217
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,339
First, I have to finagle
with Phideas.

218
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,841
Okay.

219
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,052
Oops. sorry, Penelope.

220
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:48,472
Now, Hercules, this time,
please just...

221
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,766
I know, I know.

222
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,310
Stay by the cart.

223
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:55,312
That's my boy.

224
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:00,985
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!

225
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,820
Careful!

226
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:06,365
- Why, thank you.
- No problem.

227
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,827
Why, Hercules! I-I-It's you!

228
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:13,622
- Let me, let me help you with that.
- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!

229
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,750
I'm fine.
You just run along.

230
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,585
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

231
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,628
Absolutely.

232
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,676
Yo! Give it here!

233
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,720
Hey, you need an extra guy?

234
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,140
Uh, sorry, Herc.

235
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:33,851
Uh, we already got five...

236
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,770
and we want to keep it
an even number.

237
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,272
- Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an ev...
- See ya, Herc.

238
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,108
- What a geek!
- Destructo Boy.

239
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,819
- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules".
- Yeah!

240
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,244
Heads up!

241
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,330
- I-I got it!
- No! Stop!

242
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,670
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

243
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,506
It's okay.

244
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,515
Hey! Whoa!

245
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:21,315
- Son!
- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!

246
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:24,318
Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

247
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,946
No, no, no, no, no, no!

248
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,120
Watch out!

249
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,805
Nice catch, Jerkules.

250
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:55,725
Son.

251
00:16:55,891 --> 00:17:00,855
This is the last straw,
Amphitryon!

252
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:02,523
That boy is a menace!

253
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,568
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!

254
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:09,405
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.

255
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:13,534
He-He just can't control
his strength.

256
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:17,997
I'm warning you.
You keep that-that-that...

257
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,749
freak away from here!

258
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,126
Freak! Yeah, go away!

259
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:39,727
Son, you shouldn't let those things
they said back there get to ya.

260
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,480
But, Pop, they're right.
I-I am a freak.

261
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,858
I-I try to fit in.
I really do.

262
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,610
I just can't.

263
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:52,448
Sometimes I feel like...

264
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:55,326
like I really
don't belong here...

265
00:17:55,493 --> 00:18:00,289
like I'm supposed to be
someplace else.

266
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:02,500
Hercules, son...

267
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,502
I know it doesn't make any sense.

268
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:18,099
I have often dreamed

269
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:20,434
Of a far-offplace

270
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:26,107
Where a great, warm welcome
will be waiting for me

271
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,442
Where the crowds will cheer

272
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,278
When they see my face

273
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:36,992
And a voice keeps sayin'
this is where I'm meant to be

274
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,788
I will find my way

275
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,957
I can go the distance

276
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:46,085
I'll be there someday

277
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:48,504
If I can be strong

278
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:51,090
I know every mile

279
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:53,968
Will be worth my while

280
00:18:55,302 --> 00:19:02,101
I would go most anywhere
to feel like I

281
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:06,397
Belong

282
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,778
Hercules, there's something
your mother and I...

283
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:16,657
have been meaning to, to tell ya.

284
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:20,828
But if you found me,
then where did I come from?

285
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,414
Why was I left here?

286
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:28,127
This was around your neck
when we found you.

287
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,381
It's the symbol of the gods.

288
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:36,093
This is it! Don't you see?
Maybe they have the answers.

289
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,387
I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...

290
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:44,393
Ma, Pop...

291
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,065
you're the greatest parents
anyone could have, but...

292
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,067
I-I gotta know.

293
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:12,463
I am on my way

294
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,632
I can go the distance

295
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,385
I don't care how far

296
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,804
Somehow, I'll be strong

297
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,223
I know every mile

298
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,935
Will be worth my while

299
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:29,021
I would go most anywhere

300
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:35,027
To find where I belong

301
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,215
Oh, mighty Zeus...

302
00:20:56,382 --> 00:21:00,594
please, hear me
and, and answer my prayer.

303
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,848
I need to know:
Who am I?

304
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:06,475
Wh-Where do I belong?

305
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:14,442
Huh?

306
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:24,201
My boy.
My little Hercules.

307
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,290
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold on, kiddo!

308
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:31,667
What's your hurry?
After all these years...

309
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,296
is this the kind of hello
you give your father?

310
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:37,048
F-F-Father?

311
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:40,176
Didn't know you had
a famous father, did you?

312
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:42,178
Surprise!

313
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:45,348
Look how you've grown.

314
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,184
Why, you've got your mother's
beautiful eyes...

315
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:50,436
and my strong chin.

316
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:53,439
- Hah!
- I-I don't understand.

317
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:57,485
If you're my father,
that would make me a...

318
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,028
A god.

319
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:01,697
A god. A god!

320
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,325
Hey, you wanted answers,
and by thunder...

321
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:07,078
you're old enough now
to know the truth.

322
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,831
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?

323
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:15,586
Of course we did. Your mother and I
loved you with all our hearts.

324
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:19,298
But someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal...

325
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:22,718
and only gods
can live on Mount Olympus.

326
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,345
And you can't do a thing?

327
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,472
I can't, Hercules,
but you can.

328
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,642
R-Really? W-What?
I'll do anything.

329
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,020
Hercules, if you can prove yourself
a true hero on Earth...

330
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,147
your godhood
will be restored.

331
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:38,150
A true hero. Great!

332
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:41,737
Uh, exactly how do you become
a true hero?

333
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:46,283
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.

334
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,245
Seek out Philoctetes.
Right. I'll...

335
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,497
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Hold your horses!

336
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:53,499
Which reminds me.

337
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,842
Ha-ha! You probably
don't remember Pegasus...

338
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:05,594
but you two go way back, son.

339
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:15,396
Oh, Pegasus!

340
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:17,481
He's a magnificent horse...

341
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,067
with the brain of a bird.

342
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:25,614
I'll find Philoctetes,
become a true hero!

343
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,033
That's the spirit!

344
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:31,495
I won't let you down, Father!
Yee-hah!

345
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,706
Good luck, son.

346
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,003
I will beat the odds

347
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,005
I can go the distance

348
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,424
I will face the world

349
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:45,551
Fearless, proud and strong

350
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:47,970
I will please the gods

351
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,972
I can go the distance

352
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,600
Till I find my hero's welcome

353
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,895
Right where I

354
00:23:56,062 --> 00:24:08,699
Belong

355
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,765
Whoa!

356
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:37,269
- You sure
this is the right place?

357
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,366
- What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?

358
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:54,704
- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!
- Ugh!

359
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,373
Girls! Stop! Stop!
Come back! Come back, come back!

360
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,501
Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!

361
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:04,296
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, nymphs!

362
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:07,133
- They can't keep their hands off me.
- Hey!

363
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:13,389
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?

364
00:25:13,556 --> 00:25:16,225
Uh, no.
Can you help us?

365
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,063
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.

366
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,065
- Call me Phil.
- Phil!

367
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,568
- Ow!
- Boy, am I glad to meet you!

368
00:25:25,735 --> 00:25:28,863
I'm Hercules,
and this is Pegasus.

369
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:33,325
Animals. Disgusting.

370
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:36,662
I need your help.
I want to become a hero, a true hero.

371
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:40,666
sorry, kid.
Can't help ya.

372
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,543
- Wait.
- Whoo!

373
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,628
Uh, sorry. Why not?

374
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:48,257
Two words: I am retired.

375
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,218
Look, I gotta do this.

376
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,220
Haven't you ever had a dream...

377
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,973
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?

378
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:01,937
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you somethin'.

379
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:13,407
Watch it! That was part
of the mast of the Argo.

380
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,201
- The Argo?
- Yeah.

381
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:18,871
Who do you think taught Jason
how to sail? Cleopatra?

382
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,457
I trained
all those would-be heroes.

383
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:26,379
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus".

384
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:29,048
And every single one
of those bums let me down...

385
00:26:29,215 --> 00:26:30,966
flatter than a discus.

386
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,053
None of'em
could go the distance.

387
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,014
And then there was Achilles.

388
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,016
Now there was a guy
who had it all...

389
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:41,018
the build, the foot speed.

390
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,104
He could jab.
He could take a hit.

391
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,648
He could keep on comin'.

392
00:26:45,815 --> 00:26:48,359
But that furshlugginer
heel of his!

393
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:53,322
He barely gets nicked there once
and kaboom! He's history.

394
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,201
Yeah, I had a dream once.

395
00:26:57,368 --> 00:27:00,746
I dreamed I was gonna train
the greatest hero there ever was.

396
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:05,042
So great, the gods would hang
a picture of him in the stars...

397
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,711
all across the sky...

398
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:10,506
and people would say,
"That's Phil's boy".

399
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:12,591
That's right.

400
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,635
Eh, but dreams are for rookies.

401
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:16,679
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.

402
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,889
But I'm different
than those other guys, Phil.

403
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:23,144
I can go the distance.
Come on. I'll show ya.

404
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,271
Jeez. You don't give up, do ya?

405
00:27:25,438 --> 00:27:27,690
Watch this.

406
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,029
Holy Hera.

407
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:36,532
You know, maybe if I...
No! Snap out of it!

408
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,743
I'm too old to get mixed up
in this stuff again.

409
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,578
But if I don't become
a true hero...

410
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:43,748
I'll never be able
to rejoin my father Zeus.

411
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:46,917
Hold it.
Zeus is your father, right?

412
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,919
Uh-huh.

413
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:52,548
Zeus, the big guy.
He's your daddy.

414
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:56,635
Mr. Lightning Bolts!
Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da?

415
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,638
Zeus!
"Once upon a time..."

416
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:02,391
- It's the truth!
- Please!

417
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,104
So you wanna be a hero, kid

418
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,232
Well, whoop-de-do

419
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,401
I have been
around the block before

420
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,862
With blockheads just like you

421
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,239
Each and everyone
a disappointment

422
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:20,868
Pain for which
there ain't no ointment

423
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:24,497
So much for excuses
Though a kid of Zeus is

424
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:27,958
Askin 'me to jump
into the fray

425
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,836
My answer is two words

426
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,299
Okay.

427
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:36,801
You mean you'll do it?

428
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:38,928
- You win.
- You won't be sorry, Phil.

429
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:41,347
- Oh, gods.
- So when do we start? Can we start now?

430
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:43,349
Oy, vay.

431
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:47,353
I'd given up hope
that someone would come

432
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,146
Along

433
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,607
A fella who'd ring the bell
for once

434
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,901
Not the gong

435
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:56,320
The kind who wins trophies

436
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,781
Won't settle for low fees

437
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:00,700
At least semipro fees

438
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,744
But, no
I get the greenhorn

439
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:08,207
I've been out to pasture, pal
My ambition gone

440
00:29:08,374 --> 00:29:13,045
Content to spend lazy days
and to graze my lawn

441
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,548
But you need an advisor

442
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:17,967
A satyr, but wiser

443
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:21,762
A good merchandiser
and... whoa

444
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,725
There goes my ulcer
I'm down to one last hope, and I hope

445
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,685
It's you

446
00:29:27,852 --> 00:29:32,481
Though, kid, you're not
exactly a dream come true

447
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:34,775
It rained enough turkeys

448
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,236
- Who nevercame through
- Whoa!

449
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:39,989
You're my one last hope
so you'll have to do

450
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,952
Rule number six:
when rescuing a damsel...

451
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,079
always handle with care.

452
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:50,833
No!

453
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:54,920
Rule number 95, kid: concentrate!

454
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,383
Rule number 96:

455
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,594
aim!

456
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:03,888
Demigods have faced the odds

457
00:30:04,055 --> 00:30:06,265
And ended up a mockery

458
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:07,975
Don't believe the stories

459
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:11,479
That you read
on all the crockery

460
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:15,983
To be a true hero, kid
is a dyin' art

461
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,694
Like paintin' a masterpiece

462
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,821
It's a work of heart

463
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,157
It takes more than sinew

464
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:25,701
Comes down to what's in you

465
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:29,497
You have to continue to grow

466
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,707
Now that's more like it!

467
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:34,293
I'm down to one lastshot

468
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,130
And my last high note

469
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:43,469
Before that blasted underworld
gets my goat

470
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:45,388
My dreams are on you, kid

471
00:30:45,554 --> 00:30:47,640
Go make 'em come true

472
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:49,558
Climb that uphill slope

473
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:52,144
Keep pushin 'that envelope

474
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,979
You're my one last hope

475
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:57,400
And, kid, it's up to

476
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:01,404
You

477
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,114
Yeah!

478
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:07,535
Did you see that?

479
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:10,996
Next stop, Olympus.

480
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:13,040
All right.
Just take it easy, champ.

481
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:15,209
I am ready.
I want to get off this island.

482
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:17,837
I want to see battles
and monsters.

483
00:31:18,004 --> 00:31:19,839
Rescue some damsels.

484
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:22,091
You know, heroic stuff.

485
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:25,553
- Well.
- Aw, come on, Phil!

486
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,056
Well, okay, okay.
You want a road test? Saddle up, kid.

487
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:32,685
- We're goin' to Thebes!
- Ya-hoo!

488
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:35,438
- So what's in Thebes?
- A lot of problems.

489
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:38,607
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.

490
00:31:41,277 --> 00:31:42,820
Sounds like your basic DID...

491
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:45,781
- Hyah!
- Damsel in distress!

492
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:54,874
Not so fast, sweetheart.

493
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,376
I swear, Nessus.
Put me down or I'll...

494
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:01,255
Whoo!
I like 'em fiery!

495
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:04,342
Now remember, kid.
First, analyse the situation.

496
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:08,346
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking. Eh?

497
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:11,140
He's losin' points for this!

498
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:13,642
- You don't know what you're...
- Halt!

499
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,981
Step aside, two legs.

500
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:22,735
Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.

501
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:24,737
I'll have to ask you to release
that young...

502
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:27,656
- Keep movin', junior.
- Lady.

503
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:31,369
But you... Are-Aren't you
a damsel in distress?

504
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:34,580
I'm a damsel.
I'm in distress.

505
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:37,666
I can handle this.
Have a nice day.

506
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,669
Uh...

507
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:42,838
Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close
to the situation to realize...

508
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,052
Ohhh! What are you doin'?
Get your sword!

509
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:52,848
Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15:
a hero is only as good as his weapon!

510
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,818
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.

511
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:06,987
Come on, kid!
Concentrate!

512
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,698
Use your head!

513
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,534
Oh.

514
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,208
All right!
Not bad, kid!

515
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,877
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.

516
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,425
Oh, gee, miss.
I'm, I'm really sorry.

517
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,719
- Oh.
- That was dumb.

518
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:31,220
Yeah.

519
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:33,806
Excuse me.

520
00:33:39,395 --> 00:33:42,523
Nice work! Excelente.

521
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,734
Is Wonderboy here for real?

522
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,821
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real. Whoa!

523
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:54,577
And by the way, sweet cheeks.
I'm real too.

524
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,245
Ugh!

525
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:59,498
Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!

526
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,465
Whoa!

527
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:35,701
- How was that, Phil?
- Reign it in, rookie.

528
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:38,704
You can get away with mistakes
like those in the minor decathlons...

529
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,457
but this is the big leagues!

530
00:34:41,624 --> 00:34:43,334
At least I beat him, didn't I?

531
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:46,962
Next time, don't let your guard down
because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!

532
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:49,799
D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.

533
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:52,718
You gotta stay focused,
and you...

534
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:05,272
Are you, uh, all right,
Miss, uh...

535
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:07,358
Megara.
My friends call me Meg.

536
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:09,360
At least they would
if I had any friends.

537
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:13,989
So did they give you a name
along with all those rippling pectorals?

538
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:18,035
Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...

539
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:20,621
- Uh, uh...
- Are you always this articulate?

540
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:23,708
Hercules. My...
My name is Hercules.

541
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:28,087
Herc... Huh.
I think I prefer Wonderboy.

542
00:35:28,254 --> 00:35:32,383
So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you
get mixed up with the, uh...

543
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,969
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.

544
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:39,015
They think "No" means "Yes" and
"Get lost" means "Take me. I'm yours".

545
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:44,937
Don't worry. Shorty here
can explain it to ya later.

546
00:35:45,104 --> 00:35:47,273
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.

547
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,234
It's been a real slice.

548
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:53,487
Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?

549
00:35:56,741 --> 00:36:00,327
Uh, I don't think your pinto
likes me very much.

550
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,164
Pegasus? Oh, no.
Don't be silly.

551
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,042
He'd be more than happy to... Ow!

552
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:10,546
I'll be all right.
I'm a big tough girl.

553
00:36:10,713 --> 00:36:12,840
I tie my own sandals
and everything.

554
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:16,552
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.

555
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:20,222
Bye.

556
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:23,517
She's somethin'.
Isn't she, Phil?

557
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,395
Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.
She's really somethin'.

558
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:29,607
A real pain in the patella!
Earth to Herc!

559
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:31,192
Come in, Herc!
Come in, Herc!

560
00:36:31,317 --> 00:36:33,903
We got a job to do, remember?

561
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,780
Thebes is still waitin'.

562
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,324
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

563
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:51,587
Aw, how cute.

564
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:54,507
A couple of rodents
lookin' for a theme park.

565
00:36:54,674 --> 00:36:56,384
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?

566
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:59,470
- I'm a bunny!
- A-And I'm his gopher!

567
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:01,555
Ta-dah!

568
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:03,974
I thought I smelled a rat.

569
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:07,061
- Meg.
- Speak of the devil.

570
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:11,273
Meg, my little flower, my little bird,
my little nut. Meg.

571
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,275
What exactly happened here?

572
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:16,112
I thought you were gonna persuade
the river guardian to join my team...

573
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:19,865
for the uprising, and here I am,
kind of river guardian-less.

574
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:24,036
I gave it my best shot, but
he made me an offer I had to refuse.

575
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:26,497
Fine. So instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence...

576
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:28,624
hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?

577
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,876
- Give that your best shot.
- Look. It wasn't my fault.

578
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:33,713
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.

579
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:37,299
Hercules.
Why does that name ring a bell?

580
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:40,302
I don't know.
Um, maybe we owe him money?

581
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:45,016
- What was that name again?
- Hercules.

582
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,059
He comes on with this big,
innocent farm boy routine...

583
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:49,103
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.

584
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,149
Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name
of that kid we were supposed to...

585
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:56,610
Oh, my gods!
Run for it!

586
00:37:56,777 --> 00:38:00,114
So you took care of him, huh?

587
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:02,199
Dead as a doornail.

588
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:05,202
Weren't those your exact words?

589
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:07,079
This might be
a different Hercules.

590
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:10,916
Yeah! I mean, Hercules
is a very popular name nowadays!

591
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:14,420
Remember, like, a few years ago,
every other boy was named Jason...

592
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,088
and the girls
were all named Brittany?

593
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:20,843
I'm about to rearrange
the cosmos...

594
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:24,305
and the one schlemiel
who can louse it up...

595
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:27,767
is waltzing around in the woods!

596
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:33,898
Wait. Wait, big guy.

597
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:36,901
- We can still cut in on his waltzing.
- That's right.

598
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:39,779
And-And at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.

599
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:41,280
Didn't we?

600
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:44,700
Hmm. Fortunately
for the three of you...

601
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:48,704
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.

602
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:52,500
And this time, no foul-ups.

603
00:38:55,336 --> 00:38:58,005
Wow!

604
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:01,676
- Is that all one town?
- One town, a million troubles.

605
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:03,552
The one and only Thebes.

606
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,971
The Big Olive itself.

607
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:08,974
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.

608
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:19,318
Stick with me, kid.
The city is a dangerous place.

609
00:39:21,112 --> 00:39:24,865
- Look where you're goin', numbskull!
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!

610
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,326
See what I mean?
I'm tellin' you. Wackos.

611
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:30,788
Pita bread. Pita bread.
Get your pita bread here.

612
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:33,666
- Hey, Mack.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

613
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,751
You wanna buy a sundial?

614
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:37,920
He's not interested, all right?
Come on, kid.

615
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:41,215
The end is coming!
Can't you feel it?

616
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:44,093
Yes, yes.
Thank you for the info. Yes.

617
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,595
We'll ponder that for awhile.
Just stare at the sidewalk.

618
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:48,097
Come on.
Don't make eye contact.

619
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:51,726
People here are nuts. That's because
they live in a city of turmoil.

620
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,687
Trust me, kid. You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.

621
00:39:56,355 --> 00:40:00,776
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.

622
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:05,114
everything
except old Snowball here.

623
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,950
Now were the fires
before or after the earthquake?

624
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:09,910
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.

625
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,537
But before the flood.

626
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:14,874
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.

627
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,711
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill in a hurry.

628
00:40:18,878 --> 00:40:20,504
Tell me about it.

629
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,631
It seems like every time
I turn around...

630
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:24,842
there's some new monster
wreakin' havoc and I...

631
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:28,137
All we need now
is a plague of locusts.

632
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:33,517
That's it!
I'm movin' to Sparta!

633
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:36,103
Excuse me.

634
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,938
It, uh...

635
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:41,734
seems to me that
what you folks need is a hero.

636
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,987
Yeah, and who are you?

637
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,283
I'm Hercules, and, uh...

638
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,702
I happen to be a hero.

639
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,081
- Is that so?
- A hero!

640
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:57,500
Have you ever saved
a town before?

641
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,919
Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...

642
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,505
Have you ever reversed
a natural disaster?

643
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:04,924
Well, uh, no.

644
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:08,928
Oh, listen to thi... He's just another
chariot chaser. This we need.

645
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:10,429
That's a laugh.

646
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:13,015
- Don't you pea brains get it?
- Hmm?

647
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,142
This kid is the genuine article.

648
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:19,522
Hey, isn't that the goat-man
who trained Achilles?

649
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:21,232
Watch it, pal.

650
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:25,861
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!

651
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:28,531
Ya missed a spot!

652
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:30,783
You... I got your heel
right here!

653
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,160
I'll wipe that stupid grin
off your face! You...

654
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:36,205
Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil!

655
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:39,125
What are you, crazy? Sheesh.

656
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,878
Young man, we need
a professional hero...

657
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,464
not an amateur.

658
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,342
Well, wait. Stop!

659
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,474
How am I supposed
to prove myself a hero...

660
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,309
if nobody
will give me a chance?

661
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:58,811
You'll get your chance.

662
00:41:58,978 --> 00:42:02,773
You just need some kind
of catastrophe or disaster.

663
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:06,527
Please. Help! Please!
There's been a terrible accident!

664
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:09,030
- Meg?
- Speakin' of disasters.

665
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:11,741
Wonderboy! Hercules!

666
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:13,701
- Thank goodness.
- Wha-Wha-What's wrong?

667
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:15,202
Oh! Outside of town.

668
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,580
Two little boys.
Th-They were playing in the gorge.

669
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:20,291
Th-There was this rock slide,
a terrible rock slide.

670
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:23,169
- They're trapped!
- Kids? Trapped?

671
00:42:23,336 --> 00:42:24,879
Phil, this is great!

672
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:26,881
You're really choked up
about this, aren't ya?

673
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:29,175
- Come on!
- No, I... You don't under...

674
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,428
I, I have this terrible fear
of heights!

675
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:40,353
I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!

676
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:43,189
I'm way behind ya, kid.

677
00:42:43,356 --> 00:42:44,774
I got a fur wedgie.

678
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:53,449
- Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

679
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:55,701
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstery.

680
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:57,745
Help! I can't breathe!

681
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:59,830
- Hurry!
- Get us out!

682
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:02,416
We're suffocating!

683
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,711
Somebody call IX-I-I!

684
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,505
Easy, fellas.
You'll be all right.

685
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:09,256
We can't last much longer!

686
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,926
Get us out before we get crushed!

687
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,072
- How you boys doin'?
- We're okay now.

688
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:36,867
Jeepers, mister.
You're really strong.

689
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:40,538
Well, just ty to be a little
more careful next time, okay, kids?

690
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:43,582
We sure will.

691
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,630
Stirring performance, boys.

692
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:51,716
I was really moved.

693
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,261
"Jeepers, mister"?

694
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:58,556
I was going for innocence.

695
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:02,643
And, hey, two thumbs way,
way up for our leading lady.

696
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,854
What a dish.
What a doll.

697
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:07,314
Get outta there, ya big lug,
while ya still can.

698
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:10,109
Phil, I-I did great.

699
00:44:10,276 --> 00:44:12,111
They even applauded. Sort of.

700
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:15,990
Huh! I hate
to burst your bubble, kid...

701
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:18,034
but that ain't applause.

702
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,294
Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?
What do you call that thing?

703
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:30,921
Two words:

704
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:32,631
am-scray!

705
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:39,221
Let's get ready to rumble!

706
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:48,647
That's it. Dance around!
Dance around!

707
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:52,151
Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!
Keep going. Come on. Come on.

708
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,237
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left. Your other left!

709
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:23,974
Whoa!

710
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,795
All right! All right!
You're bad! Okay!

711
00:45:52,962 --> 00:45:57,174
See, Phil?
That... That wasn't so hard.

712
00:45:57,341 --> 00:46:00,553
Kid, kid, kid.
How many horns do you see?

713
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,722
- Six?
- Eh, close enough.

714
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,765
Let's get you cleaned up.

715
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:13,816
Guys, guys, relax.
It's only halftime.

716
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:18,821
That doesn't sound good.

717
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:28,164
Definitely not good!

718
00:46:57,193 --> 00:47:00,196
Will you forget
the head-slicing thing?

719
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,706
Phil, I don't think we covered this one
in basic training!

720
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,388
My favourite part of the game:

721
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:29,892
sudden death.

722
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:55,001
Oh. There goes another one.

723
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:57,336
Just like Achilles.

724
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:01,340
Game...

725
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:05,136
set, match.

726
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,266
Hmm?

727
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:31,120
Phil, you gotta admit.

728
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:33,539
That was pretty heroic.

729
00:48:33,706 --> 00:48:38,002
Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!
Ya won by a landslide!

730
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:43,132
Hades mad.

731
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:48,137
Well, what do you know?

732
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:56,312
From that day forward,
our boy Hercules could do no wrong.

733
00:48:56,479 --> 00:49:00,024
He was so hot,
steam looked cool.

734
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:03,361
Oh, yeah

735
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:06,072
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

736
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:09,116
Person of the week
in every Greek opinion poll

737
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,952
- What a pro
- Herc could stop a show

738
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,955
Point him at a monster
and you're talkin 'SRO

739
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:17,792
- He was a no one
- A zero, zero

740
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,878
- Now he's a honcho
- He's a hero

741
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:23,714
Here was a kid
with his act down pat

742
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,634
Zero to hero in no time flat

743
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:29,470
- Zero to hero
-Just like that

744
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:32,431
When he smiled
the girls went wild

745
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:35,059
With oohs and aahs

746
00:49:35,226 --> 00:49:38,020
And they slapped his face
on every vase

747
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:40,981
On every "vahse"

748
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:43,693
From appearance fees
and royalties

749
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,404
Our Herc had cash to burn

750
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,281
Now nouveau riche and famous

751
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:52,910
He could tell you
what's a Grecian urn

752
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:55,788
Say amen
There he goes again

753
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:58,624
- Sweet and undefeated
- And an awesome ten for ten

754
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:01,210
Folks lined up
just to watch him flex

755
00:50:01,377 --> 00:50:04,588
And this perfect package
packed a pair of pretty pecs

756
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:07,508
Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers

757
00:50:07,675 --> 00:50:10,428
Honey, the crowds
were goin 'bonkers

758
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:13,014
- He showed the moxie brains and spunk
- Yeah

759
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,225
- From zero to hero
- A major hunk

760
00:50:16,392 --> 00:50:18,769
- Zero to hero
- And who'd have thunk

761
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:24,400
Who put the glad in gladiator

762
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,152
Hercules

763
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:28,696
Whose darin 'deeds
are great theatre

764
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:30,322
Hercules

765
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,324
- Isn't he bold
- No one braver

766
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:34,535
- Is he sweet
- Our favourite flavour

767
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:36,537
- Hercules
- My man.

768
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:38,497
- Hercules
- Hercules

769
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:40,583
- Hercules
- Ooh

770
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:43,169
- Hercules
- Look at my Hercules

771
00:50:43,336 --> 00:50:46,464
- Hercules, Hercules
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

772
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,841
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

773
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:51,469
- Undefeated
- Riding high

774
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:54,638
- And the nicest guy.
- Not conceited

775
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,766
- He was a nothing
- A zero, zero

776
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:58,726
- Now he's a honcho
- He's our hero

777
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:01,854
He hit the heights
at breakneck speed

778
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:04,231
From zero to hero

779
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,233
Herc is a hero

780
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,489
Now he's a hero

781
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:13,657
Yes, indeed

782
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:18,662
Pull!

783
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:23,751
Nice shootin', Rex.

784
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:26,962
I can't believe this guy.
I throw everything I've got at him...

785
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,548
and it doesn't even...

786
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:33,427
What are those?

787
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:37,431
Um, I don't know.
I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.

788
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:41,268
I've got 24 hours
to get rid of this bozo...

789
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:46,816
or the entire scheme I've been setting
up for 18 years goes up in smoke...

790
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:52,154
and you are wearing
his merchandise?

791
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:02,248
Thirsty?

792
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:16,220
Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy
is hitting every curve you throw at him.

793
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,265
Oh, yeah.

794
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:23,769
I wonder if maybe
I haven't been throwing...

795
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:29,316
the right curves at him,
Meg, my sweet.

796
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,318
Don't even go there.

797
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:33,612
See, he's gotta have
a weakness...

798
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:35,906
because everybody's
got a weakness.

799
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:38,409
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.

800
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:41,245
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?

801
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:44,040
We simply need
to find out Wonderboy's.

802
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:46,375
I've done my part.
Get your little imps...

803
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,336
They couldn't handle him
as a baby.

804
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:51,172
I need somebody
who can handle him as a man.

805
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:53,007
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.

806
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:55,343
Well, you know, that's good
because that's what got you...

807
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,345
into this jam in the first place,
isn't it?

808
00:52:57,511 --> 00:53:00,848
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.

809
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:03,476
And how does this creep thank you?

810
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:06,729
By running off
with some babe.

811
00:53:06,896 --> 00:53:08,731
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg? Huh?

812
00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:10,941
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?

813
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:13,402
Which is exactly why
I got a feelin'...

814
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,488
you're gonna leap
at my new offer.

815
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:18,616
You give me the key
to bringing down Wonder Breath...

816
00:53:18,783 --> 00:53:22,328
and I give you the thing
that you crave most...

817
00:53:22,495 --> 00:53:25,289
in the entire cosmos:

818
00:53:25,456 --> 00:53:28,459
your freedom.

819
00:53:31,337 --> 00:53:33,130
You should
have been there, Father.

820
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:35,257
I mangled the Minotaur...

821
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:38,094
grappled with the Gorgon.

822
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:40,680
Just like Phil told me.
I analysed the situation...

823
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:43,224
controlled my strength
and kicked.

824
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:47,520
The crowds went wild!

825
00:53:49,939 --> 00:53:52,817
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Hah!

826
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:56,904
You're doing great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.

827
00:53:57,071 --> 00:53:59,073
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Father.

828
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,492
I've been waiting
for this day a long time.

829
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:04,245
Hmm. What day is that, son?

830
00:54:04,412 --> 00:54:07,456
The day I rejoin the gods.

831
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:11,043
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.

832
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,045
You're just not there yet.

833
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:16,966
You haven't proven yourself
a true hero.

834
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:20,428
But, Father, I've beaten every
single monster I've come up against.

835
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:23,806
I-I'm-I'm the most famous person
in all of Greece.

836
00:54:23,973 --> 00:54:27,768
I'm-I-I'm an action figure!

837
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:30,604
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same...

838
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:34,066
as being a true hero.

839
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:35,609
What more can I do?

840
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,946
It's something you have
to discover for yourself.

841
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:43,367
- But how can I...
- Look inside your heart.

842
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:46,829
Father, wait!

843
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:04,805
On your left
is Hercules' villa.

844
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,224
Our next stop
is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop...

845
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:10,478
where you can pick up the great hero's
30-minute workout scroll...

846
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:12,521
"Buns of Bronze".

847
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,857
At 1:00, you got a meeting
with King Augeas.

848
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:16,650
He's got a problem
with his stables.

849
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,444
I'd advise you
not to wear your new sandals.

850
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:20,905
- Phil.
- I told you, don't move!

851
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:23,074
DGR, the Daughters
of the Greek Revolution.

852
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,785
- At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.
- Phil.

853
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,913
Phil, what's the point?

854
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:32,333
That's it!

855
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,377
Keep your toga on, pal.

856
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:39,924
Yuck! What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

857
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:41,550
You wanna go to Olympus,
don't ya?

858
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:45,805
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

859
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:48,641
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.

860
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:50,726
I gave this everything I had.

861
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,107
Listen to me, kid.
I seen 'em all.

862
00:55:56,273 --> 00:56:00,319
And I am tellin' you...
and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth...

863
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:02,446
you got somethin'
I never seen before.

864
00:56:02,613 --> 00:56:04,448
- Really?
- I can feel it...

865
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:07,118
right down in these stubby
bowlegs of mine.

866
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:10,246
There is nothin'
you can't do, kid.

867
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,041
- It's him!
- Hey, watch it!

868
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,501
- Watch it! Watch...
- I touched his elbow!

869
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:18,546
- Hey, girls!
- I got his sweatband!

870
00:56:18,713 --> 00:56:20,923
Phil, help!

871
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,468
- Okay. Escape plan: beta.
- Gotcha.

872
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:28,389
- Hey! Where is he?
- There he goes! On the veranda!

873
00:56:28,556 --> 00:56:30,433
Whoa!

874
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:48,534
Let's see. What could be behind
curtain number one?

875
00:56:48,701 --> 00:56:50,286
Meg!

876
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:53,122
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.

877
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,833
Gee, i-i-it's
great to see you.

878
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,918
I-I-I missed you.

879
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:00,504
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.

880
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,757
Nah. I'm no hero.

881
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:05,134
Sure ya are.
everybody in Greece...

882
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:08,721
thinks you're the greatest thing
since they put the pocket in pita.

883
00:57:08,888 --> 00:57:12,099
I know, it's... it's crazy. You know, I
can't go anywhere without being mobbed.

884
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:14,727
- I mean...
- You sound like you could use a break.

885
00:57:14,894 --> 00:57:19,690
Think your nanny goat would go berserk
if you played hookey this afternoon?

886
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:23,069
Oh, gee, I-I don't know. Uh, Phil's got
the rest of the day pretty much booked.

887
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:25,112
Ah, Phil, schmill.

888
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:27,823
Just follow me out the window,
round the dumbbells.

889
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,659
You lift up the back wall
and we're gone.

890
00:57:36,082 --> 00:57:38,167
Wow. What a day.

891
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:40,252
First that restaurant by the bay.

892
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:43,798
And then that, that play,
that, that, that Oedipus thing.

893
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:46,384
Man! I thought I had problems.

894
00:57:48,928 --> 00:57:53,933
- Psst! Stop foolin' around.
- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.

895
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,520
I didn't know that playing hookey
could be so much fun.

896
00:57:57,687 --> 00:58:00,272
Yeah, neither did I.

897
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:03,693
- Thanks, Meg.
- Oh.

898
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:05,945
Don't thank me just yet.

899
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:08,531
- Oh!
- Oop. Careful.

900
00:58:08,698 --> 00:58:10,616
sorry. Weak ankles.

901
00:58:10,783 --> 00:58:14,954
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better
sit down for a while.

902
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:19,125
So, uh, do you
have any problems...

903
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,252
with things like this?

904
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:24,338
- Uh...
- Weak ankles, I mean.

905
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:27,299
Oh, uh, no, not really.

906
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:31,262
No weaknesses whatsoever?

907
00:58:31,429 --> 00:58:34,181
- No trick knee?
- Uh...

908
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,851
Ruptured disks?

909
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:43,983
No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.

910
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:48,195
- Wonderboy, you are perfect.
- Thanks.

911
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:52,033
Whoops!

912
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:55,536
It looks better that way.

913
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:58,080
No, it really does.

914
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:06,922
You know, when, when I was a kid...

915
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:11,344
I, I would have given anything to be
exactly like everybody else.

916
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,013
You wanted to be
petty and dishonest?

917
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,892
- everybody's not like that.
- Yes, they are.

918
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:21,312
- You're not like that.
- How do you know what I'm like?

919
00:59:21,479 --> 00:59:23,314
All I know is...

920
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:28,527
you're the most amazing person with
weak ankles I've ever met.

921
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:33,783
Oh!

922
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:36,369
Meg, when I'm with you...

923
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:40,873
I-I don't feel so alone.

924
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,459
Sometimes it's better
to be alone.

925
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:47,004
- What do you mean?
- Nobody can hurt you.

926
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,846
Meg? I would never ever hurt you.

927
00:59:56,013 --> 00:59:58,599
And I don't wanna
hurt you, so...

928
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:01,227
let's both do
ourselves a favour and...

929
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:06,190
stop this before we...

930
01:00:06,357 --> 01:00:10,194
All right! Break it up!
Break it up! Party's over!

931
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:13,072
- I've been lookin' all over this town!
- Calm down, mutton man.

932
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:15,700
- It was all my fault.
- You're already on my list, sister!

933
01:00:15,866 --> 01:00:17,993
So don't make it worse!

934
01:00:20,371 --> 01:00:23,082
And as for you, ya bum,
you're gonna go to the stadium...

935
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:25,418
and you're gonna be put through
the workout of your life!

936
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:29,797
- Now get on the horse.
- Okay, okay.

937
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:32,633
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, he'll get over it.

938
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:41,267
Move! Move, move,
move, move, move! Move!

939
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:49,525
Hey, watch it. Watch it.
Watch it.

940
01:00:49,692 --> 01:00:51,902
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...

941
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:58,367
That's it. Next time, I drive.

942
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,502
Oh, what's the matter with me?

943
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:12,298
You'd think a girl would learn.

944
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:16,761
If there's a prize
for rotten judgment

945
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,806
I guess I've already won that

946
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:25,436
No man is worth the aggravation

947
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:29,106
That's ancient history
Been there, done that

948
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:33,027
Who do ya think you're kidding
He's the earth and heaven to ya

949
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:36,530
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya

950
01:01:36,697 --> 01:01:38,824
- Oh, no
- Girl, you can't conceal it

951
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:43,788
We know how you feel
and who you're thinkin' of

952
01:01:43,954 --> 01:01:49,460
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

953
01:01:49,627 --> 01:01:53,172
You swoon, you sigh
Why deny it, uh-oh

954
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:57,343
It's too cliche
I won't say I'm in love

955
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:01,055
Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
Oo-oo-oo

956
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:04,642
I thought my heart
had learned its lesson

957
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:08,312
It feels so good
when you start out

958
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:12,900
- Ah
- My head is screaming, get a grip, girl

959
01:02:13,067 --> 01:02:16,862
Unless you're dyin'
to cry your heart out, oh

960
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:20,574
You keep on denyin ' who you are
and how you're feelin'

961
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:24,745
Baby, we're not buyin'
Hon, we saw you hit the ceilin'

962
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:28,374
Face it like a grown up
When you gonna own up that you

963
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:31,419
- Got
- Got
- Got it bad

964
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:36,924
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

965
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:40,886
- Give up, but give in
- Check the grin, you're in love

966
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:44,682
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love

967
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:48,602
You're doin 'flips, read our lips
You're in love

968
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,604
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
- You're way off base

969
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,565
- I won't say it
- She won't say love

970
01:02:52,732 --> 01:02:56,569
Get off my case
I won't say it

971
01:02:56,736 --> 01:03:02,074
Girl, don't be proud
It's okay, you're in love

972
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,869
Oh

973
01:03:05,036 --> 01:03:08,164
At least out loud

974
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:11,959
I won't say I'm in

975
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:14,920
- Love
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo, shoo-doo

976
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:18,257
Shoo-doo
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

977
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:20,593
Ha

978
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,105
Hey, what's the buzz, huh, Meg?

979
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:36,609
What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?

980
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:40,654
-Get yourself another girl. I'm through.
-I'm sorry. You mind runnin'
that by me again?

981
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:43,491
I must have had a chunk of brimstone
wedged in my ear or something.

982
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:47,828
Then read my lips! Forget it.

983
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:52,458
Meg, Meg, Meg,
my sweet deluded little minion.

984
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:57,254
Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,
but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?

985
01:03:57,421 --> 01:03:59,256
I own you!

986
01:03:59,423 --> 01:04:04,136
- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.
- You work for me.

987
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:06,681
That kid's gonna be
doin' laps for a month.

988
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:09,850
If I say, "Sing",
you say, "Hey, name that tune".

989
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:14,480
If I say, "l want Wonderboy's head
on a platter", you say...

990
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:16,482
Medium or well done?

991
01:04:16,649 --> 01:04:21,112
Oh! I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.

992
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:24,407
- I'll work on that.
- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?

993
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:29,161
That's the sound of your freedom
fluttering out the window forever.

994
01:04:29,328 --> 01:04:33,165
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.

995
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:37,336
I can't believe you're getting
so worked up about some guy.

996
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:39,839
This one is different.
He's honest and, and he's sweet.

997
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,841
- Please!
- He would never do anything to hurt me.

998
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:46,762
- He's a guy.
- Besides, O Oneness, you can't beat him.

999
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:51,308
He has no weaknesses.
He's gonna...

1000
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:54,979
I think he does, Meg.

1001
01:04:55,146 --> 01:04:58,858
I truly think he does.

1002
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:25,968
- Hey, Phil, what happened to you?
- Kid, we gotta talk.

1003
01:05:26,135 --> 01:05:29,055
Oh, Phil, I just had
the greatest day of my life.

1004
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:32,475
I, I, I can't stop thinkin'
about Meg.

1005
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:35,436
- She's somethin' else.
- Kid! I'm tryin' to talk to you!

1006
01:05:35,603 --> 01:05:37,438
Will you come down here
and listen?

1007
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:42,234
Aw, how can I come down there
when I'm feelin' so up?

1008
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:08,761
Gotcha!

1009
01:06:08,928 --> 01:06:11,430
Ah, very nice.
What I'm tryin' to say is...

1010
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:14,100
That if it wasn't foryou,
I never would have met her.

1011
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:16,519
Oh, I owe you big time,
little guy. I do.

1012
01:06:16,686 --> 01:06:17,937
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?

1013
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:20,606
Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?

1014
01:06:20,773 --> 01:06:23,693
- Phil, I got two words for ya: duck!
- Listen to me. She's...

1015
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:25,403
- My dream come true?
- Not exactly.

1016
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:27,446
- More beautiful than Aphrodite?
- Aside from that!

1017
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:31,659
- The most wonderful...
- She's a... She's a fraud!

1018
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:34,286
She's been playin' ya for a sap!

1019
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:37,331
- Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.
- I'm not kiddin' around.

1020
01:06:37,498 --> 01:06:39,333
- She...
- I know you're upset about today,
but that's no reason to...

1021
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,794
- Kid, you're missin' the point.
- The point is, I love her.

1022
01:06:41,961 --> 01:06:43,587
- She don't love you.
- You're crazy.

1023
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:45,631
- She nothin' but a two-timin'...
- Stop it!

1024
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:48,092
- No-good, lyin', schemin'...
- Shut up!

1025
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:56,017
Phil. I... Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

1026
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:59,937
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth? Fine.

1027
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:02,523
Phil, wait. Where ya goin'?

1028
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:06,861
I'm hoppin' the first barge outta here.
I'm goin' home.

1029
01:07:07,028 --> 01:07:09,155
Fine! G...

1030
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:12,283
Go! I don't... I don't need you.

1031
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:17,830
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ...

1032
01:07:17,997 --> 01:07:21,292
not the all-time chump.

1033
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:26,005
Jeez Louise,
what got his goat, huh?

1034
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:30,885
Baboom. Name is Hades,
lord of the dead.

1035
01:07:31,052 --> 01:07:33,012
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Uh, not now, okay?

1036
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:35,848
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds,
and I'm a fast talker, all right?

1037
01:07:36,015 --> 01:07:38,684
See, I've got
this major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.

1038
01:07:38,851 --> 01:07:40,853
And, Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

1039
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,356
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it, huh?

1040
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:46,025
- You've got the wrong guy.
- Hear me out, ya little...

1041
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:48,152
Just hear me out, okay?

1042
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,030
So I would be eternally grateful
if you would just...

1043
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:53,532
take a day off from
this hero business of yours.

1044
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:55,618
Jeez, I mean, monsters,
natural disasters.

1045
01:07:55,785 --> 01:07:57,536
- You wait a day, huh?
- You're out of your mind.

1046
01:07:57,703 --> 01:08:02,291
Not so fast, because, ya see,
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.

1047
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:07,546
- Meg!
- Don't listen, Herc...

1048
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:09,799
- Let her go!
- Here's the trade-off.

1049
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:12,760
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?

1050
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:15,054
Say, the next 24 hours.

1051
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:17,098
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

1052
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,392
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,
we carry on, we go home happy.

1053
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:22,019
What do ya say? Come on.

1054
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:24,021
People are... are gonna
get hurt, aren't they?

1055
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:26,148
Nah! I mean, it's, you know,
it's a possibility.

1056
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:28,150
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war,
but what can I tell ya?

1057
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:30,194
Anyway, what do you
owe these people, huh?

1058
01:08:30,361 --> 01:08:33,197
Isn't Meg...
you little smoochy face you...
Isn't she more important than they are?

1059
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:35,282
- Stop it!
- Isn't she?

1060
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:38,119
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.

1061
01:08:38,244 --> 01:08:40,162
Fine, okay.
I'll give you that one.

1062
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,415
Meg is safe, otherwise
you get your strength right back.

1063
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,625
Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.
Baboom. Okay? We're done.

1064
01:08:44,792 --> 01:08:46,627
What do you say we shake on it?

1065
01:08:46,794 --> 01:08:48,838
Hey, I really don't have,
like, time to bat this around.

1066
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:50,881
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?

1067
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:53,968
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...

1068
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:57,888
- All right!
- Yes! We're there! Bam!

1069
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:08,107
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kind of natural.

1070
01:09:08,274 --> 01:09:10,317
Maybe you should sit down!

1071
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:16,323
Now you know how it feels to be
just like everybody else.

1072
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:19,910
Isn't it just peachy?

1073
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:22,329
Oh! You'll love this.
One more thing.

1074
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:25,166
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.

1075
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:28,461
You're off the hook.
And by the way, Herc,

1076
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:30,713
is she not, like,
a fabulous little actress?

1077
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,298
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

1078
01:09:32,465 --> 01:09:36,594
I mean your little chickie-poo here
was working for me all the time.

1079
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:40,473
- Duh.
- You're... You're lying!

1080
01:09:40,639 --> 01:09:45,478
- Help!
- Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.

1081
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:49,607
- Couldn't have done it without you,
sugar, sweetheart, babe.
- No! It's... It's not like that.

1082
01:09:49,774 --> 01:09:54,653
I didn't mean to...
I-I couldn't... I... I'm so sorry.

1083
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:58,741
Our hero's a zero!
Our hero's a zero!

1084
01:10:00,785 --> 01:10:04,705
Well, gotta blaze. There's a whole
cosmos up there waiting for me...

1085
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:06,791
with, hey, my name on it.

1086
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:13,005
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!

1087
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:29,397
Brothers! Titans!

1088
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:33,025
Look at you in your squalid prison!

1089
01:10:33,192 --> 01:10:38,155
- Who put you down there?
- Zeus!

1090
01:10:38,322 --> 01:10:40,741
And now that I set you free...

1091
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:44,370
what is the first thing
you are going to do?

1092
01:10:44,537 --> 01:10:48,249
- Destroy him!
- Good answer.

1093
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:54,964
Crush Zeus!

1094
01:10:57,508 --> 01:11:00,803
Freeze him!

1095
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:08,519
Melt Zeus!

1096
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:13,107
Blow him away!

1097
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:20,364
Zeus!

1098
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:22,199
- Uh, guys?
- Huh?

1099
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:25,119
Olympus would be that way.

1100
01:11:25,286 --> 01:11:29,373
- Zeus!
- Freeze him!

1101
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:31,375
- Hold it, bright eye.
- Huh?

1102
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,628
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.

1103
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:45,723
- Huh? Huh?
- Destroy Zeus!

1104
01:11:45,848 --> 01:11:49,643
Oh, we're in trouble!
Oh, big trouble! I gotta...

1105
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:52,104
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped.

1106
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:54,148
And they're practically
at our gates!

1107
01:11:54,315 --> 01:11:58,361
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!

1108
01:11:58,527 --> 01:12:01,113
- Go! Go!
- Gone, babe.

1109
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:05,826
Huh?

1110
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:15,753
- Charge!
- On to battle!

1111
01:12:26,347 --> 01:12:28,724
Ya windbag!

1112
01:12:29,975 --> 01:12:32,645
Boom, badda-boom!
Boom, boom!

1113
01:12:36,232 --> 01:12:40,111
Hercules!

1114
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:43,531
Where are you?

1115
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:48,160
- What can we do?
- Where is Hercules?

1116
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:51,163
Yeah, Hercules will save us.

1117
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:54,667
Hercules!

1118
01:12:54,834 --> 01:13:00,464
Come out! Face me!

1119
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:03,968
Oh, what are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.

1120
01:13:04,135 --> 01:13:06,929
- Hercules!
- There are worse things.

1121
01:13:07,096 --> 01:13:10,891
- Run!
- Wait! Stop!

1122
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:16,147
- Hey, look! It's Hercules.
- Thank the gods! We're saved!

1123
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:20,359
So, you mighty Hercules.

1124
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:29,452
- Oh!
- Oh!

1125
01:13:34,123 --> 01:13:37,877
Easy, horsefeathers.
Whoa! Stop twitching!

1126
01:13:38,044 --> 01:13:42,131
Listen.
Hercules is in trouble.

1127
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:45,217
We've gotta find Phil. He's the only one
who can talk some sense into him.

1128
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:52,767
Get back! Blast you!

1129
01:13:56,854 --> 01:14:01,108
- Ooh! Chihuahua!
- Zeus!

1130
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:05,446
Come on! Hury up!
We're shovin' off here!

1131
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:09,408
Phil! Phil,
Hercules needs your help.

1132
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:11,911
What does he need me for
when he's got friends like you?

1133
01:14:12,078 --> 01:14:16,791
- He won't listen to me.
- Good! He's finally learned somethin'.

1134
01:14:16,957 --> 01:14:21,087
Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but this isn't about me. It's about him.

1135
01:14:21,212 --> 01:14:24,590
If you don't help him now,
Phil, he'll die.

1136
01:14:24,757 --> 01:14:26,884
I need more thunderbolts!

1137
01:14:27,051 --> 01:14:31,430
Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,
my lord. everyone's been captured.

1138
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:35,226
I've been captured.
Hey, hey, watch the glasses.

1139
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:43,150
Zeusy, I'm home!

1140
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:47,113
Hades! You're behind this?

1141
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:50,533
You're correct, sir!

1142
01:14:53,494 --> 01:14:55,788
Flea!

1143
01:14:59,959 --> 01:15:02,920
- Hercules!
- Phil.

1144
01:15:03,087 --> 01:15:06,298
Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.
Come on. You can take this bum.

1145
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:11,345
- This guy's a pushover. Look at him.
- You were right all along, Phil.

1146
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:14,890
- Dreams are for rookies.
- No, no, no, no, no, kid.

1147
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:19,103
Givin' up is for rookies. I came back
'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.

1148
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:23,315
I'm willin' to go the distance.
How about you?

1149
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:28,738
Me bite off head!

1150
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:35,870
Whoa, baby!

1151
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:50,843
Hercules! Look out!

1152
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:54,013
Meg! No!

1153
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:05,316
What's happening?

1154
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,070
H-Hades' deal is broken.

1155
01:16:10,196 --> 01:16:13,074
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.

1156
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:18,329
Meg, why... why... why did ya...
You didn't have to...

1157
01:16:18,496 --> 01:16:22,708
Oh, people always
do crazy things...

1158
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,378
when they're in love.

1159
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:29,423
Oh, Meg. Meg, I... I...

1160
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:34,387
Are you always this articulate?

1161
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:41,894
You... You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.

1162
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:45,189
I'll watch over her, kid.

1163
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:49,485
You're gonna be all right.
I promise.

1164
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:54,824
Let's go, Pegasus!

1165
01:16:56,701 --> 01:16:59,036
Hup, two, three, four!
Come on, everybody!

1166
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:01,872
- I can't hear you!
- Oh, oh, that.

1167
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:06,210
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of th...

1168
01:17:06,377 --> 01:17:08,921
I'm the one giving orders now,
bolt boy.

1169
01:17:09,046 --> 01:17:11,799
And I think
I'm gonna like it here.

1170
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:16,053
Don't get too
comfortable, Hades!

1171
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:19,598
- Hercules!
- This ought to even the odds!

1172
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:26,397
- Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.
- Get them!

1173
01:17:29,567 --> 01:17:31,652
Whoa! Hey!

1174
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:35,197
No! Get him! Not me! Him!

1175
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:42,204
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse!

1176
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:51,881
- Thank you, my boy.
- Nice horsey!

1177
01:17:52,048 --> 01:17:56,844
My intentions were pure.
I really was attracted to you.

1178
01:17:58,763 --> 01:18:04,018
- Throw!
- Ah! Now watch your old man work!

1179
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:06,020
Uh-oh!

1180
01:18:09,106 --> 01:18:11,567
Guys, get your
titanic rears in gear...

1181
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:14,945
and kick some Olympian butt.

1182
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:17,865
Whoa! Is my hair out?

1183
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:48,521
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least
I've got one swell consolation prize...

1184
01:18:48,688 --> 01:18:53,067
a friend of yours
who's dying to see me.

1185
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:54,360
Meg.

1186
01:19:24,724 --> 01:19:26,267
Meg.

1187
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:35,151
Meg, no.

1188
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:56,881
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.

1189
01:19:59,592 --> 01:20:01,927
There's some things
you just can't change.

1190
01:20:05,222 --> 01:20:07,141
Yes, I can.

1191
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:13,606
We were so close!

1192
01:20:13,773 --> 01:20:16,609
So close. We tripped
at the finish line. Why?

1193
01:20:16,734 --> 01:20:21,113
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

1194
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,495
- Where's Meg?
- Oh. Look who's here.

1195
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:32,166
- Wonderboy, you are too much.
- Let her go.

1196
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:36,128
Get a grip. Come here. Come here.
Let me show you around.

1197
01:20:36,921 --> 01:20:40,424
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld, after all, huh?

1198
01:20:41,676 --> 01:20:45,429
- Meg!
- No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1199
01:20:45,596 --> 01:20:48,265
You see, Meg's running
with a new crowd these days...

1200
01:20:48,391 --> 01:20:50,559
and not a very lively one at that.

1201
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:55,314
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1202
01:20:55,481 --> 01:21:00,820
Oh, hmph. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

1203
01:21:00,986 --> 01:21:03,322
- Going once!
- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?

1204
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:06,450
- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1205
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:10,037
You get her out.
She goes; you stay.

1206
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:16,544
Oh, you know what slipped my mind?
You'll be dead before
you can get to her.

1207
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:19,755
That's not a problem, is it?

1208
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:46,824
Oh!

1209
01:21:46,991 --> 01:21:49,160
What's the matter
with these scissors?

1210
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:51,787
The thread won't cut.

1211
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:02,048
This is...
This is impossible!

1212
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:05,051
You... You... You can't be alive.
You'd have to be a, a...

1213
01:22:05,176 --> 01:22:07,887
A god?

1214
01:22:11,307 --> 01:22:15,061
Hercules, stop!
Ya can't do this to me! Ya can't...

1215
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:18,397
Fine. Okay. Listen.
Okay, well, I deserved that.

1216
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:22,401
Herc, Herc, Herc? Can we talk?
Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?

1217
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:24,653
So maybe you could
put in a word with him...

1218
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:26,906
and he'd kind of blow
this whole thing off, you know?

1219
01:22:27,073 --> 01:22:30,159
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
You know, a little schmooze, uh...

1220
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:38,334
Get away from me! Don't touch me!
Get your slimy souls off me!

1221
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:40,878
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1222
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:44,090
- You mean, if he gets outta there.
- Taxi!

1223
01:22:44,256 --> 01:22:46,092
- If? If is good.
- Taxi!

1224
01:22:46,217 --> 01:22:49,887
I don't feel so good.
I-I feel a little...

1225
01:23:12,952 --> 01:23:16,706
Wonderboy, what...
Why did you...

1226
01:23:18,124 --> 01:23:23,170
People always do crazy things
when they're in love.

1227
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:33,556
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1228
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:47,987
Three cheers
for the mighty Hercules!

1229
01:23:48,154 --> 01:23:51,073
Oh, yeah.
Flowers for everybody! Oh!

1230
01:24:02,293 --> 01:24:04,337
Hercules!

1231
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:09,759
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

1232
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:12,428
Mother.

1233
01:24:13,596 --> 01:24:16,724
Fine work, my boy!
You've done it!

1234
01:24:16,891 --> 01:24:19,185
You're a true hero.

1235
01:24:19,352 --> 01:24:23,397
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1236
01:24:23,522 --> 01:24:27,318
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength...

1237
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:31,197
but by the strength
of his heart.

1238
01:24:31,364 --> 01:24:36,160
Now, at last, my son...

1239
01:24:36,327 --> 01:24:39,121
you can come home.

1240
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:56,764
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.

1241
01:25:04,897 --> 01:25:09,610
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of...

1242
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:13,239
but...

1243
01:25:13,406 --> 01:25:18,244
a life without Meg,
even an immortal life...

1244
01:25:18,411 --> 01:25:21,247
would be empty.

1245
01:25:22,915 --> 01:25:25,459
I...

1246
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:27,962
I wish to stay
on Earth with her.

1247
01:25:28,129 --> 01:25:30,798
I finally know where I belong.

1248
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:46,313
Hit it, ladies.

1249
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,109
Oh, gonna shout it
from the mountaintops

1250
01:25:50,276 --> 01:25:51,777
A staris born

1251
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:54,280
It's the time
for pullin 'out the stops

1252
01:25:54,447 --> 01:25:55,948
A star is born

1253
01:25:56,115 --> 01:25:59,994
- Honey, hit us with a hallelu
- That kid came shinin' through

1254
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:01,996
Girl, sing the song

1255
01:26:02,163 --> 01:26:07,835
Come blow your horn
A star is born, a star is born

1256
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:12,256
- He's a hero who can please the crowd
- A star is born

1257
01:26:12,423 --> 01:26:16,135
Come on, everybody, shout out loud
A star is born

1258
01:26:16,302 --> 01:26:20,348
Just remember in the darkest hour
Within your heart's the power

1259
01:26:20,514 --> 01:26:24,268
For makin 'you a hero too

1260
01:26:24,435 --> 01:26:27,521
So don't lose hope
when you're for lorn

1261
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:30,024
- That's Phil's boy!
- Just keep your eyes

1262
01:26:30,191 --> 01:26:33,319
- You just keep your eyes
- Upon the skies
- Upon the skies

1263
01:26:33,486 --> 01:26:35,071
- every night, a star is
- every night

1264
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:37,156
- Right in sight, a star is
- Burning bright

1265
01:26:37,323 --> 01:26:42,453
Burning bright
A star is born

1266
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:31,344
What do ya say?
It's happy ending time!

1267
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:34,305
everybody's got a little taste
of somethin' but me. I got nothin'.

1268
01:32:34,472 --> 01:32:37,266
I-I'm here with nothin'.
Anybody listenin'?

1269
01:32:37,433 --> 01:32:39,727
It's like I'm... What am I,
an echo or something?

1270
01:32:39,894 --> 01:32:42,980
Hello? Hello?
Am I talking to, what?

1271
01:32:43,147 --> 01:32:46,650
Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.
Nobody listens.

1272
