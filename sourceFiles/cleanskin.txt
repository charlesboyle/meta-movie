CLEANSKIN (2012)

00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,120
<i>Iraq has
increased the level of its oil reserves</i>

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,800
<i>by 24% since Saddam Hussein
was removed.</i>

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,200
<i>The country has 133.1 billion barrels</i>

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,960
<i>of extractable oil</i>

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,080
<i>up from 115 billion barrels
estimated previously.</i>

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,240
<i>- Under Saddam Hussein...
- Fucking bitch!</i>

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,840
<i>...political isolation meant
little new exploratory work</i>

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,120
<i>was undertaken.</i>

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,880
<i>Closer to home, with the government
way ahead in the opinion polls,</i>

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,240
<i>the focus of debate in
the upcoming general election today</i>

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,400
<i>switched from the economy
to the domestic terror threat.</i>

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,760
<i>The government claims
that domestic terror groups</i>

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,160
<i>fractured since
Osama Bin Laden's death,</i>

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,760
<i>and due to increased cooperation
with key Middle...</i>

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,320
Unbelievable!

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,040
People have no idea about
the shit storm that's about to go down.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,040
Is this thing real?

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,240
Don't play with it.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
Have I lost weight?

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Was gonna say you look different.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,120
I've lost weight. I mean, I feel good.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,320
It's 50 short.

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Get her out of here.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
What about my money?

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,560
Get your hands off me.

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,520
Don't touch me!

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,120
You're still fat, Harry.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,640
- Get off!
- Bitch.

30
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
Yeah.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
OK. Now.

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
Follow them.

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,760
Take a left here,
head to the center of town.

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm going in.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,360
There's too many people.

36
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,120
They're gonna go upstairs, find there's
no one there and that'll be it.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
No.

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Give me your fucking gun.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,960
Wait here.

40
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
Excuse me, sir.

41
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,400
Move!

42
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,520
He never stated his destination?

43
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,760
He gave his driver instructions
as we went along.

44
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,240
He never suspected
who you worked for?

45
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
No.

46
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,200
The Semtex?

47
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
It was taken.

48
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,320
I placed a tracer in one of the blocks
the night before.

49
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,920
The tracer went offline
when the attack took place.

50
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,480
We're tying to kick-start it
remotely now.

51
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,680
The perpetrators knew
we were gonna be there at that time.

52
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,400
They knew where we were going.

53
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
And you didn't stop them?

54
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
Perhaps you don't
belong here any more.

55
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,440
So we've no idea to whom
the Semtex was to be delivered?

56
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
No.

57
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,640
You and I, Charlotte, in five.

58
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Difficult times.
He's getting pressures from on high.

59
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
You did what you could, Ewan.

60
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,080
Charlotte?

61
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,560
Oh.

62
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,960
Present from my ex-husband.

63
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,480
Get that seen to and get some rest.

64
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,720
On my break.
I've got two minutes left.

65
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
No, I'm not smoking.

66
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm not inhaling, I'm walking.

67
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,760
I'm out of breath
cos I had to rush back from lunch.

68
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,760
Tuna sandwich.
Tuna sandwich and some crisps,

69
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,160
and a chocolate biscuit
and a coffee, no sugar.

70
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,440
Hey, we gonna go for drinks? Make it...

71
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,800
about quarter past, yeah?

72
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,840
How's Dad? And the fence?

73
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,840
The garden fence.

74
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,400
Just tell him to wait
and I'll help him the next time I'm up

75
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,360
because his back won't hold up.
I'll get time off. It's not a problem.

76
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,560
I don't know when.
I'll let you know when I know.

77
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,360
Hey, one minute.
It's a good job. Gives me time to drink.

78
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,880
Think, I said think!

79
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,080
About whatever. I've got my degree,
I can do what I want.

80
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,560
Look, I've gotta go, I'm late.
Yep, I love you too.

81
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Bye. Bye, bye, bye.

82
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,760
Sorry.

83
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,640
See ya.

84
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,080
Can I help you, sir? Table for one?

85
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,280
Almost there.

86
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
How did you do it?

87
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,160
Slipped.

88
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,440
Doing something strenuous?

89
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,560
Your girlfriend will love the scar.

90
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,320
Sexy.

91
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,720
Wife.

92
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,720
Come back in two days,
take the stitches out.

93
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,960
Might still be here.

94
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,800
Back in a minute with some painkillers.

95
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,200
Yeah.

96
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,320
<i>It's been confirmed</i>

97
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
<i>that a suicide bombing
occurred earlier today</i>

98
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,880
<i>at 12:30 in the busy
South London restaurant, Driscoll's.</i>

99
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,960
<i>With currently confirmed casualties
of 20</i>

100
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,400
<i>and with more understood
to be injured.</i>

101
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,400
<i>The restaurant was full
of lunchtime customers,</i>

102
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,480
<i>including a large meeting being held</i>

103
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,720
<i>by the 2004 Committee,</i>

104
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,640
<i>an organization which had
Middle East energy interests</i>

105
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,400
<i>and championed the Iraq war.</i>

106
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,480
<i>Three backbench MPs were members.</i>

107
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,760
<i>All are believed
to be amongst the fatalities.</i>

108
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,640
The same Semtex that was
stolen was used in the bombing.

109
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,120
An element in Whitehall feels that
Obama's inclusive doctrine

110
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,040
has spread across the Atlantic
and has made us complacent.

111
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,680
They're pushing for sweeping changes.

112
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,560
If they discover that the Semtex
was being monitored by us

113
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,680
and that we could have stopped it...

114
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't need to tell you
the repercussions for this government,

115
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,040
especially with the election looming.

116
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,400
The clock is ticking on all of us.

117
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,160
It's just you and I here, Charlotte.

118
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,360
What can you do for me?

119
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,880
We are here to remember
Corporal Peter Walcott Tiernan,

120
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,840
taken from us in the service of Queen
and country in Afghanistan.

121
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,040
He bravely answered his country's call,
and leaves a loving wife, Louise,

122
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,120
his brothers, lan and Daniel,
and his mother, Margaret.

123
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,200
It's at times like these that
we must find strength and peace

124
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,560
in the memories
of what he meant to us,

125
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,000
an honorable son and brother.

126
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,360
He was older than his 25 years
and was the one his family relied upon

127
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,960
since losing their father at an early age.

128
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,600
He undertook his responsibilities
with dignity and strength

129
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,440
and maintained a strong family bond.

130
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,160
Remember he said
he had a trial for United?

131
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,000
He said he missed out
cos he was too fast.

132
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,600
You remember, sir?

133
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,320
Yeah, I remember.

134
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,320
Last letter I got from him, he...

135
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,280
He said the regiment
weren't the same since you left.

136
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,720
- How are you, mate?
- How do I look like I am?

137
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,520
Cold makes it hurt like a bastard.

138
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,640
I can't sleep properly.

139
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,240
What happened there?

140
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,120
Ah, some stupid accident.

141
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,240
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.

142
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,400
Thinks I'm some sort of invalid.

143
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,920
She can't stop fussing.

144
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,880
You should be thankful.

145
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,000
See that bomb they set off in London?

146
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,360
It was on the news.
It never ends. None of it.

147
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
What was the point of Pete dying, sir?

148
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Dying in some shithole country
for nothing.

149
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,960
- What was the fucking point?
- What's the matter with you?

150
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,280
Have some respect for him,
for his family.

151
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,320
You got hurt, but you're here.
You're alive.

152
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
Listen to me,

153
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,360
We move on.

154
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,120
What's here and now,
that's all that matters, all right?

155
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,800
Go back to your wife.

156
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,800
If you need help,

157
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,760
you can always find me.

158
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,400
We stick together, all of us.

159
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,760
Have you moved on, sir?
From what happened?

160
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,360
Hello?

161
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,680
<i>A car will be downstairs
in 15 minutes.</i>

162
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,920
I'm Mark.

163
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,640
Baby daughter.

164
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,040
Take the path through the wood.
You'll find her at the other end.

165
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,760
Bit of a walk.

166
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,480
You've seen the news.
20 dead, scores injured.

167
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,200
Semtex was used. You understand?

168
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,320
Perpetrator?

169
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,760
It was strapped to his jacket,
self-detonated.

170
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,760
No details on who he was.

171
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,761
CCTV (Closed-circuit TV)
have no clear images.

172
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,000
There's nothing left of him.

173
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,840
We're bound by procedure.

174
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,760
In this situation,
we cannot afford those constraints.

175
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,160
This is off-reservation.
It's why you're at my home.

176
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,680
I want you to find who's responsible

177
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,640
and stop him
in whatever way you feel fit.

178
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,520
Let it be done quickly.

179
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,560
It'll be you and Mark.
He's young but capable.

180
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,360
Very good with a gun, I hear.

181
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,360
I want it low-tech, old trade craft.

182
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,440
If you get caught,
I don't want evidence.

183
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,560
I'll supply technical backup
and the sweep and clean.

184
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,840
No luck yet with the tracer
you planted in the Semtex

185
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,960
but we did find something curious
of your man Harry.

186
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,000
No bullets in his automatic.
Any thoughts?

187
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,440
Maybe.

188
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,120
You're my hands on this, Ewan,
my conscience.

189
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,160
Wipe it clean.

190
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,280
No loose ends.

191
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
Where's Harry?

192
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,280
Fat cheapskate owes me money.

193
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,480
Harry's dead.

194
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,680
I want you to think carefully,
more carefully than you've ever thought.

195
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,240
Was there anything...

196
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,000
Anything unusual happened
in the last few days?

197
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,320
Anything you know
but you're not telling me?

198
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Dead? What are you talking about?

199
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,400
I'm leaving.

200
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,280
You took the bullets from his gun.
Why?

201
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

202
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,600
I don't have time to waste.

203
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,400
I know you know something
and I'm not leaving until you talk,

204
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,280
one way or another.

205
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,440
Talk.

206
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,760
I don't know anything. Please.

207
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,680
By the time I'm through with your face,

208
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,000
nobody's going to wanna look at you,
let alone pay to fuck you.

209
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,960
He said nothing would happen.

210
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,320
What?

211
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,600
- He told me it was just business.
- Who did?

212
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,520
- A client.
- Which client? Tell me about him.

213
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,920
- Young guy, said his name was Paul.
- Paul?

214
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,480
I saw him regular for two months.
He wanted to know stuff about Harry.

215
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,960
- What stuff?
- What he was up to, his routine,

216
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,920
he paid me extra.

217
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,080
I told him useless stuff -
who he met, what time, his routine,

218
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,640
- just useless stuff.
- What about the bullets?

219
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,520
Said it was a joke to take them out.

220
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
Said Harry showed up with a gun.
He wanted to teach him a lesson.

221
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,840
Where did you meet him?
What did he look like?

222
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,000
At his house. Expensive place.

223
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,440
Short hair, brown, slim,
could pass for Greek or Italian

224
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,640
but he was an Arab.

225
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,400
- How do you know?
- I have Arab friends.

226
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,480
I know what the language sounds like.
Heard him speaking it on the phone.

227
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,520
You know his address?

228
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,720
<i>When the bomb went off,
there was a flash,</i>

229
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,680
<i>and then there was lots of smoke.</i>

230
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,280
<i>A lot of glass flying. There was
a lot of people on the ground.</i>

231
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,920
<i>Horrendous, huge explosion...</i>

232
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,280
<i>I don't know.
I just felt it more than anything else.</i>

233
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,160
Ash.

234
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,200
Jesus.

235
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,200
How have you been?

236
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,960
Good, yeah. You?

237
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,240
Yeah, I'm good.

238
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,640
Do you, uh, live around here?

239
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,080
No, I'm just... Coffee.

240
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,800
It's good to see you.

241
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah, you too.

242
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,960
I have to go. I'm late for something.

243
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,120
Listen, um... Do you have a number?

244
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,480
If you... If you give me yours, I can...

245
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,920
- If I can get this thing to work.
- It's all right, give me yours.

246
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,360
I'll tap into this.

247
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,400
Um... OK.

248
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
07950...

249
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,120
956958.

250
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,960
Got it.

251
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,040
Look, I have to go.
I'm really late for something, but...

252
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,280
Really nice to see you again.

253
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,880
<i>Horrific.
What we saw was devastation.</i>

254
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,600
<i>It was just horrific, really.
It was like being in a war zone.</i>

255
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,360
<i>It was crazy and I heard screams.</i>

256
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,440
<i>People like, kind of injured,
and their clothes were all, like...</i>

257
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,960
<i>Everyone was just covered in dust.</i>

258
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,560
<i>We have with us
today Crispin Jones,</i>

259
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,240
<i>who is an intelligence expert.</i>

260
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,600
<i>Crispin, what are your thoughts
about the recent spate of bombings?</i>

261
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,840
<i>Well, I think it's too early
for us to speculate</i>

262
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,960
<i>as to who's involved, but, um,</i>

263
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,040
<i>the hallmarks of the bombing
really do point</i>

264
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,360
<i>to home-grown Islamic terrorism.</i>

265
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,320
<i>The cowardly way the bombs were lit
in a public place,</i>

266
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,720
<i>the nature of the types of explosives,
and it seems to be...</i>

267
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,960
Off you go.

268
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,480
Hi.

269
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,800
Can I use your bathroom?

270
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,840
Yeah, you know where it is.

271
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,360
So why are you here?

272
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,720
You always said if I needed any help
I could speak to you.

273
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,240
I need money.

274
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,000
Can I get a drink?

275
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,280
Yeah, sure.

276
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,320
Get your fucking hands up!

277
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,920
- You got me into this!
- Fucking whore!

278
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
- Get your hands up!
- Fucking bitch!

279
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,600
- Get away from him!
- You got me into this!

280
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,280
Check outside.

281
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,800
- Hello?
- Why'd you hang up?

282
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,920
Yeah, I didn't know what to say.

283
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,040
<i>Why didn't you move your lips
and something would have come out.</i>

284
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,760
Listen, are you free to meet?

285
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,280
<i>It's a bright,
sunny morning in London town,</i>

286
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,200
<i>with highs in the early 20s...</i>

287
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,440
<i>Coming up, lots of new music
and a few other surprises in store</i>

288
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,880
<i>It's nine minutes past eight...</i>

289
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,400
<i>Time for some music.</i>

290
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,840
<i>It's Blur, from their last album,
Think Tank.</i>

291
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,680
I love this song.

292
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,120
Oh, God, it's gonna stay in my head
for the whole day now.

293
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,120
Shooting star?

294
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,200
It's going out in beautiful flames.

295
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,320
You remember I said
that I was late a couple of weeks ago?

296
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,800
Yeah.

297
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,120
Well, I came on the other day.

298
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
Aren't you relieved?

299
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,920
I'm disappointed, actually.

300
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,880
I mean, obviously, that kid would have
my good looks and massive brain.

301
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,920
When do I get to
meet your mum?

302
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,360
Well, you'd have to put
some clothes on first.

303
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,640
You haven't told her
about me, have you?

304
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,480
Is it cos I'm not a nice Muslim girl?

305
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,480
She doesn't know

306
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,480
that you're a bacon-eating,
lager-drinking sex maniac?

307
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,120
John Major signed a peace treaty
with Sinn FÃ©in

308
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,680
because the IRA's violent actions
forced him to.

309
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,520
Gery Adams changed from a terrorist
to a politician but it was violence

310
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,920
and legal action that forced the change.
Not one lawyer was involved.

311
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,800
Gery Adams is a murderer.

312
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,160
This is a law class.
It's not a political forum for you to...

313
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,640
Actually, in today's context
he is recognised and accepted.

314
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,800
He's being invited to have tea
with the Prime Minister, for fuck's sake.

315
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,320
Ash, just keep it civilized.

316
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm sorry.

317
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,520
Cos he matched them with violence.

318
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,720
I mean, look at Israel,
created through a violent struggle

319
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,560
and now it's an internationally
recognised state.

320
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
In America, the American forefathers
fought the British,

321
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,880
beat them hands down,
and now what are they?

322
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,560
They're the biggest
superpower on this planet.

323
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,360
Why? Because violence
is the supreme authority

324
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,520
all authorities derive
their power and legitimacy from.

325
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,080
Law is completely irrelevant
in the face of true force.

326
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,200
That applies to any country.

327
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,480
And what's your country?

328
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,280
Ash.

329
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,800
Can I have a word?

330
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,880
You may be smart
but you are close to failing.

331
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,280
It's a "D", I'm afraid.

332
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,960
I can handle this.

333
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,200
Ash, do you really want
to practice law?

334
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,280
- Ash?
- Don't worry.

335
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,920
"All right, I'm coming out.

336
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,160
"You, coming out now.

337
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,040
"Any man I see outside
I'm going to shoot.

338
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
"Any son of a bitch
who starts to shoot at me,

339
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,280
"I'm going to shoot them, too.

340
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,840
"Then I'm going to kill
all his friends, his family,

341
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,720
"and then second generation,
everybody.

342
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,040
"Then I'm going
to burn their house down."

343
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,440
It's Unforgiven, you know?

344
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,840
Clint Eastwood after he's killed
everyone for murdering his friend,

345
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,600
played by the noble Morgan Freeman.
Oh, man, great actor.

346
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,440
I'm Nabil. You are?

347
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,040
- I'm Ash.
- Ah, Ash.

348
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,040
Like cigarette ash.

349
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,640
It's not your real name, huh?

350
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,880
Don't be ashamed of who you are, huh?

351
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,880
Short for Ashraf, yes?

352
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,720
You look how
they've killed Muslims, huh,

353
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,720
in Bosnia, Chechnya, Kosovo.

354
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,320
And now they've invaded Iraq
for the bloody oil.

355
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,440
Come to one of my meetings.

356
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,280
Here, take... Take, uh...
Take some of these, yeah?

357
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,360
Take five, you give them
to your friends.

358
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,800
You have friends, don't you?

359
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,280
Your face!

360
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,880
Hey!

361
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,440
Oh, Allah wouldn't be pleased!

362
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,040
Sorry, what did you say?

363
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,560
- What were you guys doing in there?
- Just a little pick-me-up.

364
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,960
Were you doing that shit with him?

365
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,040
Ash, don't start. I'm not in the mood.

366
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,000
Come on, come on.

367
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
- Oh!
- Oh!

368
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,160
You all right?

369
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,480
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey.

370
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,360
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy!

371
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,000
Get off me! God.

372
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,480
Come here.

373
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,880
Ash, I'm sorry.

374
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,480
What the fuck's
the matter with you, huh?

375
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,840
Tying to make me
look like a fucking idiot?

376
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,480
- No.
- Doing that shit with him, huh?

377
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
That fucking prick.

378
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,200
What were you doing
in the fucking toilets, huh?

379
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,560
- Nothing.
- Sucking his cock?

380
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,960
- I'm sorry.
- Was he feeling...

381
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,640
- Fuck off!
- Come on, Ash.

382
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,440
Just as long as you have
a fucking great time,

383
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,880
you know, fucking get wasted.

384
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,280
You don't give a shit about anything,
do you?

385
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,760
- You don't care about anything.
- Look, I'm sorry.

386
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,400
Listen, look, I'm sorry, OK?

387
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,920
I'm sorry.

388
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,360
I promise I won't do it again.

389
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,440
This is the last time, OK?

390
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,880
You know I love you.

391
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,120
<i>We must rise up against
these Western pigs</i>

392
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,840
who occupy our lands.

393
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,160
Who come at us with smiles
to take what's ours

394
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,040
and turn us against each other.

395
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
In this so-called democracy,

396
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,400
if you speak up about
Muslims being slaughtered,

397
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,920
you're an extremist. Huh? Yes?

398
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,840
Yes, yes.

399
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:42,040
But if you are passive, huh?
Silent, easy to control, huh?

400
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,200
You're a good Muslim. Yes?

401
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,800
Just like a dog, they throw you a bone.

402
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,880
But keep you on a leash, ah?

403
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,880
You know the type of Muslim
I'm talking about.

404
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,520
He's so ashamed of who he is.

405
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,480
He gives himself a Western name.

406
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,600
He tries to think and feel
like his Western master.

407
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,680
Live like him, be him!

408
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,400
You say to him...

409
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,160
My friend, you say to him,

410
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,880
"Let's stop the murder of Muslims."

411
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,920
And he would say,
"You ignorant foreigner,

412
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,600
"you want me to jeopardize
my nice life and my country, huh?"

413
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,240
This is the fool who wears
an England football shirt,

414
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,040
and says,
"Ah, we won the match." Huh?

415
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,920
And the man next to him,
in the same shirt,

416
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,000
he calls him a Paki, hmm?

417
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
A nigger.

418
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Ask yourself, "Who are you?"

419
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Really?

420
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,560
All right, matey?

421
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,760
I'll just get a couple of pints, please.

422
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,240
How's Kate?

423
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,520
She was off her head last night.
I've never seen anyone drink

424
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,720
or snort as much as that in my life.
An animal.

425
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,360
So how come you weren't there?

426
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,960
She not tell you she was out?

427
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,080
I wanted her to suck me off
but she passed out.

428
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
It's OK, hey, no problem.

429
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,120
It's all right, my friend,
it's no problem, no problem.

430
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,320
Come, come, move, come.

431
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,400
It's all right, it's all right, a racist.
Bastard. Come on.

432
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
You know, it felt good, what I did.

433
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,560
You know, sometimes to earn respect,

434
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,440
we have to do things
we wouldn't normally do.

435
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,600
You know, people like us
have to do that

436
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,560
just to get the basic respect
most people take for granted.

437
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,720
In Afghanistan, hmm,

438
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,200
we had to fight to earn respect
and freedom from the Russians.

439
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,160
You were there?

440
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,200
What was it like?

441
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,360
What happens on the battlefield
is between you and God.

442
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,960
I am here now.

443
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,160
God didn't will it for me
to enter paradise.

444
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,480
But I'm content, you know?
Contentment is a state of mind.

445
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,160
Like Palestine.

446
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,200
You know, law is not for me.

447
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't want to be part of any hypocrisy.

448
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,120
Look.

449
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,880
Would you call them
dignified human beings, hmm?

450
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,960
They're just having fun.

451
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,720
My friend, no, we are not like them.

452
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,960
What time is it?

453
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,640
You have a rough night?

454
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,720
My head.

455
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,840
Listen, Kate.

456
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,960
I don't think we should
see each other any more.

457
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,520
Why?

458
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,440
Same shit every day.

459
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,560
You don't know when to stop.

460
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,760
I'm 23, for God's sake.

461
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,160
Look, I'll stop when I'm older.
I'm enjoying myself.

462
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,560
Will you just relax, for Christ's sake?

463
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,000
Right, I don't want to see you
any more. OK?

464
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,080
I don't want this any more.

465
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,200
You can go back to sleep if you like.

466
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,520
Oh, what, just like that?

467
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,960
Black and white?
It's so fucking easy for you, isn't it?

468
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,800
You want to end it with me and...

469
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,720
you end it, just like it's nothing.

470
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,720
You want to leave? Just go.

471
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,760
Get over yourself.

472
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,200
Ash!

473
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,680
<i>The terror level
stays at "critical"</i>

474
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,920
<i>and some are calling London
a city under siege.</i>

475
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,400
<i>The government announced today</i>

476
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,920
<i>that it would proceed as planned
with the general election.</i>

477
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,760
<i>We ask whether it would be best
to postpone the election</i>

478
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,320
<i>in the interests of public safety.</i>

479
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,000
<i>The government, however, may feel</i>

480
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,960
<i>that an alteration to the election date
would be seen as a victory for...</i>

481
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,200
Nice place.

482
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,160
Swish.

483
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,360
Present for my baby daughter.

484
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,680
You have to check for small parts.

485
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,840
Ever wondered why they do it?

486
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,800
Too simplistic to think
they just hate us?

487
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,080
What does that have to do
with this girl?

488
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,920
Look at her.

489
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,080
Have you served for your country?

490
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,280
No.

491
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,160
I fought over there.

492
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,840
To stop this from happening here.
Again.

493
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,680
Didn't stop. They're not going to stop.

494
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,640
And neither will I.

495
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,400
I'm going to find every one of them...

496
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,040
and send them to the death
they pray for.

497
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,360
Hello?

498
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,120
<i>There's a file for you
at the drop box in 10 minutes.</i>

499
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,200
Come on.

500
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,640
You hesitated before
you gave the safe signal.

501
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,720
Is someone following you?

502
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,200
Maybe.

503
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
I couldn't say.

504
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,360
Did you walk here?
Circuits?

505
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,440
I've been down Holborn,
Chancery Lane, Oxford Street.

506
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,600
- Two hours.
- Shall I report it?

507
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,960
I'm not sure.

508
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,440
Bombings are making us all nervous.

509
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,400
Don't worry about it.

510
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,480
They found the receipt in Paul's house
for two pay-as-you-go phones.

511
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,280
Paul had one. The other was used
two hours ago from that building.

512
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,560
The phone was used
to call Afghanistan.

513
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,280
He's in there on his own.

514
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,360
It's not registered to anyone.
It's an abandoned council property.

515
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,080
We can go in round the back.

516
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,880
We go in and take him.
Shots to the head.

517
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,560
Anything else allows him to detonate,
understood?

518
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,880
Yeah.

519
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,960
Come on.

520
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,680
- Get up!
- Ah! No!

521
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,560
Don't! Stop! No!

522
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,960
Where's your jacket, hey?

523
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,560
- I said don't shoot!
- Face the wall!

524
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,320
I said face the fucking wall!

525
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,920
- Face the fucking wall!
- I said don't shoot!

526
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,920
Close the door. Go!

527
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,080
Let me just talk to you, man.

528
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,920
I said let me talk to you!

529
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,480
How many people were you gonna kill?

530
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,120
Just give me a second, please.

531
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,040
Get on your fucking knees!

532
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,440
I don't know what
you're talking about, all right?

533
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,680
- How many?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

534
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,560
Just listen to me and calm down,
and me and you can...

535
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,720
An eye for an eye, yeah?

536
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,080
I'm just like you.

537
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,640
I'm just...

538
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,720
I'm just like you, all right?

539
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,360
You're nothing like me,
you fucking animal.

540
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,880
Please, don't!

541
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,280
I can do what I want to you.

542
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,800
I can do anything I want.

543
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,960
You know that?

544
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,960
Please don't!

545
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,520
Move!

546
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,280
Let him burn.

547
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,440
Oh, fucking hell.

548
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,440
The tracer on the Semtex
was kick-started.

549
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,760
This will take you right to it.

550
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,200
Who was the man I just killed?

551
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,000
You have to go now.

552
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,480
Mujeeb Ajmed. Pakistani parents,
23 years old, UK citizen.

553
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,200
At the precise moment
he was signing on, squatting in the flat.

554
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,240
Not a bomber.

555
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,360
What other options
were you faced with?

556
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,520
Considering the past days' events,
your past...

557
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,200
what you've been through,
what we've all been through.

558
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,960
You were not there.

559
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,000
We have removed all traces of you.
It was a squat in a dealer's hangout.

560
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,680
What's done is done.

561
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,160
How did he get the phone?

562
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,600
Stolen, obviously, from Paul.

563
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,560
Do you have anything
that would link you with this incident?

564
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,320
Just his jacket.

565
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,080
Get rid of it.

566
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,960
This is no time to doubt.

567
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,040
Innocent lives are at stake.

568
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,680
Finish it.

569
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,960
Do you remember lan?

570
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,680
The stoner who used to steal
our milk and top it up with water.

571
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,720
Oh yeah, he used to piss
into a water bottle

572
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,440
cos he couldn't be bothered
to walk to the toilet.

573
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,280
Yeah, I saw three
full bottles in there once.

574
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,280
So what have you been up to
all this time?

575
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,400
Oh, nothing much, just been drifting.

576
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,920
You didn't get into law?

577
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,480
No, it wasn't for me.

578
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,680
I always thought you were
gonna be a high flyer.

579
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,160
Have your own firm.

580
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,520
Not like me. I always knew I'd end up
working in the dullest law practice ever.

581
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,280
Why don't you just quit?

582
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,880
- It's not that easy. I can't just...
- No.

583
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,040
- ...leave my job.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

584
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,200
So are you, um...
Are you married or anything?

585
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,000
No, not married.

586
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,520
Relationships, yeah.

587
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,400
There was this one guy
but that just ended.

588
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,000
No, I loved him.

589
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,320
He just wasn't interested.
Wasted four years of my life.

590
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,560
Lost it a bit, actually.

591
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,360
Still managed to keep my job
at the law firm.

592
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,480
And then I went crazy wanting kids.

593
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,280
Never met anyone.

594
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
You?

595
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,280
Nothing serious.

596
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,480
How's your mum?

597
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,000
Is she still trying to get you
to marry a nice Muslim girl?

598
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,920
No. She, um... She died
a couple of years ago.

599
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,360
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

600
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,000
You look beautiful.

601
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,240
I hardly ever think about those days.

602
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,160
Uni feels like another life to me.

603
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,960
What're you doing?

604
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,920
We, uh, we organize activities
for young Muslims.

605
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,360
Camping in the Brecon Beacons,
rafting, paintball, team bonding.

606
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,320
And we combine these
with religious teachings.

607
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,800
Now, as a successful Muslim
businessman, you want your staff...

608
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,440
- Your Muslim staff.
- ...to be of good character, right?

609
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,320
Thank you for coming to visit me
and for making this offer,

610
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,880
but I'll have to pass.

611
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,720
I don't involve myself
in my workers' private lives.

612
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,520
I'm not a religious man,
but faith is a... a personal thing.

613
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,800
What they do in their own time
is their business,

614
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,160
and that's what's great
about this country.

615
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,240
But thank you.

616
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,040
Great about this country?

617
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,040
Man, this is the same country
that has destroyed so many cultures.

618
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,080
All our cultures.

619
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,760
- Thanks for your time.
- No problem, thank you.

620
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,480
Oh, Muhammed.

621
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,200
Hey, you look well.

622
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,080
Salam aleikum.

623
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,120
Yeah, how are you?
Good to see you, my friend.

624
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,560
Oi! Hamed!

625
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,640
Don't shoot me! I'm only...
Hey, good to see you.

626
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,960
How are you?
Good to see you, good to see you.

627
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,360
- Salam aleikum.
- Yussif, yes?

628
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,200
- Yes, yes.
- Which one is this?

629
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,480
This is the one we send to the boys,
but it's the truth.

630
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,280
You're doing excellent work, very good.

631
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,640
- Thanks.
- Now come, we need to talk, huh?

632
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,840
- Yep.
- Shall I come with you, Bruv?

633
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,760
No, just, uh, finish up.

634
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,120
He wasn't interested.

635
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,800
No problem. Ah, there...

636
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,680
There are other business people
we can approach, you know?

637
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,880
It's a matter of, uh, getting their
young workers to join us, huh? Huh?

638
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,040
You know,
this gym was a very good idea.

639
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,360
You're doing very, very well, my friend.
Very, very well.

640
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,720
You want to do more, yes?

641
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,840
What have you got in mind?

642
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,520
A test of your will.

643
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,840
And then we shall see about you.

644
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,920
This is Sergeant Glenn Conlon.

645
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,160
Ex-military with
intelligence associations.

646
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,160
He has served in secret prisons
all over the Middle East,

647
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,240
killing and torturing people we know,
you know, people close to us.

648
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,640
He's not in the services any more,
you know, he's...

649
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,200
bought a farm.

650
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,080
Stables, you know,
he wants the quiet life.

651
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,560
He's retired from killing
and humiliating Muslims.

652
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,440
We don't retire.

653
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,520
We don't forget.

654
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,760
There is a man coming from the
Middle East. An important man.

655
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,480
He lands next week.
You'll go and meet him.

656
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,760
You'll do as he asks.
But he needs your assistance.

657
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,960
This is a foreign country to him.

658
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,880
You'll need another man.

659
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,960
You have someone?

660
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,000
Yeah, Yussif.
Good.

661
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,720
You're going to help
our friend with Sergeant Conlon.

662
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,960
Ashraf?

663
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,080
Peaceful streets.

664
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,080
Inglesi.

665
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,600
What?

666
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,040
Englishman.

667
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,080
He gets up at 8:00 a.m.,
goes to the barn,

668
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,880
cleans it for an hour
and then goes to the stables.

669
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,200
Who lives with him?

670
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,080
- Nobody.
- No wife?

671
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,720
No.

672
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,880
When he comes out of his house,
follow him into the barn.

673
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,720
Show him the gun.

674
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,480
We come out, we beat him,
tie him, take him.

675
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,920
You do everything like I tell you to,
you understand?

676
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,400
A knife for you.

677
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,200
No fork.

678
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,560
Go and see what is happening.

679
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,640
I'm going to cut
your head off like a pig's.

680
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,160
- Anyone else here?
- No one.

681
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,920
Put him in the van.
Put your dead friend there, too.

682
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,080
Turn the camera on.

683
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,920
<i>Some breaking news for you now.</i>

684
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,040
<i>A Mr. Glenn Conlon
has been reported missing.</i>

685
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,720
<i>Mr. Conlon was a banker and
a former private in the Army Reserves.</i>

686
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,640
<i>His sister, Rebecca Conlon,</i>

687
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,120
<i>and her 8-month-old daughter
were found brutally murdered</i>

688
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,360
<i>at his farm in Hertfordshire.</i>

689
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,520
<i>The police have little to go on...</i>

690
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,800
There is anger in you.

691
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,320
Makes no sense.

692
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,480
Why are you helping us?

693
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:26,400
You're angry with me about
the woman, the baby.

694
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,880
Do you think he cared for the families
of the men he tortured and killed?

695
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,880
You're confused in the head. Majnoon.

696
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,120
Take it.

697
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,800
These pigs kill our people

698
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,600
all over the world
and you feel for them?

699
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,400
What's the matter with you?

700
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,640
BE A MAN!

701
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,360
The woman saw my face.

702
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,800
The baby.

703
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,520
You're not one of us.

704
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,960
You haven't suffered like we have.

705
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,160
This is your country.

706
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,760
Well, I am sorry about your friend,
you know.

707
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,200
But he was taken doing God's will.

708
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,640
- A true martyr.
- And that soldier?

709
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,560
I mean, he was just a reserve.

710
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,200
My friend.

711
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,120
Do you think they would publicize
the fact that he was a torturer?

712
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,320
And what about the woman
and the baby, huh?

713
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,240
Collateral damage.

714
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,960
Who invented that phrase? That...
Enough of this!

715
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,320
You know you can't stay
in this country, huh?

716
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,840
Too dangerous. One door closes.

717
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,080
Another opens.

718
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,640
Before our colleague left,
he said you were a capable man.

719
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,480
But that you... you know, you need

720
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:07,960
experience to see what
these pigs do to your people.

721
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,240
Hmm?

722
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,560
I think he was right.

723
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,080
Afghanistan.

724
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,600
You'll go there, with a new identity,
to our friends.

725
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,240
Be taught useful things,
then you'll come back.

726
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,760
And if you don't return...

727
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,720
then your prize will be more than
anything any one of us could wish for.

728
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,000
Paradise.

729
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,280
It's what you wanted, yes?

730
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,960
<i>An unidentified,
deceased male was found</i>

731
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,400
<i>horrifically burnt in an abandoned
warehouse in East London.</i>

732
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,800
<i>The body was so disfigured
no details of him are available.</i>

733
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,560
<i>The location was
a known drugs factory</i>

734
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,280
<i>and haunt of local gangs and dealers.</i>

735
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,800
<i>Police are treating...</i>

736
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,840
There's nothing we could have done.
We were doing our job.

737
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,120
Our job is to do what's right.

738
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,240
What did she mean?

739
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,080
She said something about you.
What was she talking about?

740
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,800
My wife was killed in the bombings
a few years back.

741
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,240
I'm sorry.

742
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,720
She'd have been 34 this year.

743
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,120
She had nothing to do with all...
With all this, you know?

744
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,240
Some days...

745
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,120
Yeah, some days, I...

746
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,800
That thing still in there?

747
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,040
What?

748
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,600
How do you turn it off?

749
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,600
You turn it that way. No.

750
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,440
That way.

751
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,040
The other way.

752
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,520
The other way. Yeah.

753
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,680
You OK?

754
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,160
Fine.

755
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,600
I remember this.

756
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,600
It's embarrassing.

757
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,360
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

758
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,480
About the way I acted back then.
If I could change it, I would.

759
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,920
Is everything all right with you, Kate?

760
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,520
- With your life?
- It's fine.

761
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,680
It's not as easy as it used to be,
but don't have to talk about that now.

762
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,840
We just... We slipped away.

763
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,040
I have never stopped
thinking about you, Kate.

764
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,040
You have to know that.

765
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,040
Look, if you have things to do,
we could just meet this afternoon.

766
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,440
I know this pub.

767
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,360
I'd like to.

768
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,600
Where have you been?

769
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,320
Paul was meant to go ahead last night.

770
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,680
He's vanished.

771
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,560
- Were you followed?
- No.

772
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,240
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

773
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,920
We have to change our plans.

774
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,720
You have to make contact
with the third man and help him.

775
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:10,840
- You stay with him. I'll be in touch.
- When is he due to go ahead?

776
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,960
Tomorrow.

777
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,120
What's the matter with you?

778
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,840
It isn't time to be weak and emotional.
We have no time for emotions now.

779
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,320
Especially when your brothers
and sisters are suffering.

780
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,760
You know who I am, yeah?

781
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,520
- Yeah.
- Is there anything else?

782
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,880
- Any papers? Receipts?
- No.

783
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,880
OK, use this.

784
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,120
I'm going to go first.

785
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,280
You wait here for a few minutes
and then follow me, OK?

786
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,080
You stay calm.

787
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,920
Have a look round, Mark.
Check round the corner.

788
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,560
Have a look up there.

789
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,600
It's him!

790
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,040
Fuck!

791
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,960
- We got him.
- I heard.

792
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,680
There was someone there watching.

793
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,480
- Who?
- I don't know.

794
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,600
Somebody across the road.
He got away on a bike.

795
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,520
He's connected.

796
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,840
Get the CCTV footage.
Should be a clear shot of him.

797
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,000
<i>There are two rooms
at the Glassmore Hotel</i>

798
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,720
<i>booked in the name
of Michael and John Smith.</i>

799
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,440
<i>Check in.
I'll be there when I have something.</i>

800
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,920
<i>One more thing. There is a team on us,
our people. Watch yourselves.</i>

801
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,280
Our people? Why?

802
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,440
<i>What we are doing is not standard.
Make sure that...</i>

803
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,680
Where the fuck's she gone?

804
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,040
Hey.

805
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,400
You look tired.

806
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,000
I'm fine.

807
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,520
It was a nightmare getting
here with all the madness.

808
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,720
What?

809
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,000
There was a bomb scare
on the train coming here.

810
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,440
Scared shitless.

811
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,760
Bunch of murdering maniacs.
Hope they kill the lot of them.

812
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,920
You know when I said I didn't think
about those days at uni any more?

813
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,560
- Yeah.
- I was lying.

814
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,360
I know.

815
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,800
You know, I thought I saw you
once a few years ago.

816
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,880
I just lost you in the crowd.

817
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,280
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

818
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,280
Especially since it's your round.

819
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,800
Can I get a red wine
and orange juice, please?

820
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,320
No problem at all.

821
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,400
There you go. That's £5 exactly.

822
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,960
Thank you.

823
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,280
Good, good. You take it to the car.

824
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,640
Here, you, take...
Take the cake. I will be five minutes.

825
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,400
My son, it's his birthday.

826
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,560
They were there. They knew.

827
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,640
You shouldn't be here.

828
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,960
Your target is an American neo-con.

829
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,400
Head of a think-tank, instrumental
in planning the war on terror.

830
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,200
His daughter is getting married
to an Englishman.

831
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,520
Where?

832
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,720
I'll know tomorrow.
You still have your phone, huh?

833
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,040
God be with you, my friend.

834
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,120
Will I see my family?

835
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,680
What?

836
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,880
Oh, you'll see everyone
who's important in your life.

837
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,880
Everyone who has passed away,
and... and... and it will seem like

838
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,280
only half a day has passed
since you last saw them.

839
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,680
Huh?

840
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,400
You OK?

841
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,360
I'm good.

842
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,560
You did well.

843
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,520
Stay alert.

844
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,000
Yeah.

845
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,400
Yeah, I know the place.

846
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,560
<i>For those of you looking for reasons,</i>

847
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,200
<i>then I suggest you pay
attention to what I have to say.</i>

848
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:57,600
<i>For far too long, you've ignored
what is happening around you.</i>

849
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,960
<i>You've not seen the inevitable
that is coming at you.</i>

850
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,080
<i>The inevitability of my actions.</i>

851
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,560
Who are you, hey?

852
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,120
Who are you working for?

853
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,040
Talk to me. Who sent you?

854
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,160
<i>You've never opened
your mouths in protest</i>

855
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,800
<i>at my people's suffering.</i>

856
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Answer me!

857
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,460
<i>Your silence has been deafening.</i>

858
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:56,461
Who sent you. Talk!

859
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,240
<i>Words have had no impact on you.</i>

860
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,480
<i>Politics has had no impact on you.</i>

861
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,280
<i>Look at Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine.
The list goes on and on.</i>

862
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,040
<i>And you continue to ignore it.</i>

863
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,720
<i>You seem confused at our actions.</i>

864
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,560
<i>Lost in your decadent world.</i>

865
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,120
<i>Unable to act.</i>

866
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,880
<i>Unable to move.</i>

867
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,760
<i>Frozen in time.</i>

868
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:26,360
<i>So now I'm going to communicate to
you in a language you can understand.</i>

869
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,800
<i>My words are dead</i>

870
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,480
<i>until I give them life with
your blood and mine.</i>

871
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,480
<i>I'm sure by now your
newspapers and television</i>

872
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,640
<i>have depicted me as a madman,</i>

873
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,440
<i>an evil outsider
hell-bent on destruction.</i>

874
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,280
<i>Your corrupt and degenerate media</i>

875
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:57,000
<i>will spin my actions to suit
the government agenda.</i>

876
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,520
<i>They want you misinformed,
scared and docile,</i>

877
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,320
<i>so that you continue to ignore
their murderous actions.</i>

878
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,160
<i>They are happy for you
to lose yourself and all that this world</i>

879
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,400
<i>has to offer so that you stay unaware</i>

880
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,480
<i>and intoxicated
with their mindless chatter.</i>

881
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,200
<i>So that you do not question
the situation you find yourselves in.</i>

882
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,000
<i>Trapped in a vicious circle
of your own doing.</i>

883
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,800
<i>My life has been a journey
towards violence,</i>

884
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,160
<i>but it's not one I regret.</i>

885
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,160
<i>There is no guilt for me.
There is no thoughts of the past</i>

886
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,440
<i>or what I did or didn't do.
My search is over.</i>

887
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,440
<i>My hands have been guided by</i>

888
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,920
<i>a force that's greater
than anything on this world.</i>

889
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,600
<i>I've found my peace.</i>

890
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,200
<i>You must understand that things
do not happen without reason.</i>

891
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,000
<i>There are no coincidences.</i>

892
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,200
Come in, come in.

893
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,160
<i>So listen carefully
to what I have to say.</i>

894
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:55,000
Where are you?
Give us your location, where are you?

895
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,240
Everything is in position.
He has entered and heading towards

896
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,360
the kitchen area.
CCTV has been immobilized.

897
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,800
<i>The material world that you
worship is meaningless and empty.</i>

898
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,920
<i>It means nothing to me.</i>

899
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,600
<i>I leave it behind gladly.</i>

900
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,840
<i>I have sacrificed myself...</i>

901
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:23,320
<i>...for something higher than what
this world has to offer.</i>

902
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,280
<i>I strive for a higher ground.</i>

903
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,920
<i>Now, your government,</i>

904
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,720
<i>the government that you voted for,</i>

905
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,840
<i>commit atrocities against
my people all over this world.</i>

906
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:51,240
<i>Your support for them
makes you responsible.</i>

907
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,160
<i>I'm not a hypocrite.</i>

908
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,120
<i>I will not sit by while my brothers
and sisters are being slaughtered.</i>

909
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,480
<i>The path that has led me here
has been littered with obstacles.</i>

910
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,800
<i>But I have remained strong.</i>

911
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,680
<i>I am sure of my actions.</i>

912
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,240
<i>Then I will not falter.</i>

913
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,720
<i>Until you stop the bombing,
imprisonment and torture of my people,</i>

914
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,000
<i>we will not stop.</i>

915
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,480
<i>We have entered the realm of war,
and I am a soldier.</i>

916
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,200
<i>Until we feel security,
you will be our targets.</i>

917
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,520
<i>You are all responsible
for turning a blind eye</i>

918
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,440
<i>to the butchery of my people.</i>

919
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,800
<i>I'm only a man, but my actions
are the price you pay</i>

920
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,280
<i>for your apathy, for your debauchery.</i>

921
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:13,320
<i>I've lived amongst you,
but I'm not a part of you.</i>

922
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,000
<i>You've not seen me until now.</i>

923
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,360
<i>I am God's lonely man.</i>

924
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,160
<i>Your 9/11s, your 7/7s,
are what my people</i>

925
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,760
<i>suffer on a daily basis
around the world.</i>

926
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,800
<i>You know nothing of suffering.</i>

927
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,400
<i>So now I'm going to show you.</i>

928
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,480
<i>My prayers have all been answered</i>

929
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:01,520
<i>and no earthly force can
take them away from me.</i>

930
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,400
<i>I will rise up against you.</i>

931
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,000
<i>You'll not forget me.</i>

932
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,600
<i>You have killed thousands
of my brothers and sisters.</i>

933
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:58,600
<i>That much death has a consequence
you will pay for with your blood.</i>

934
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,200
<i>There will be more like me,
I promise you.</i>

935
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,760
<i>And we will bring hell
to you and your kind.</i>

936
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,880
<i>And my conscience is clear.</i>

937
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,440
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

938
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,880
<i>I live forever. I go to a better place.</i>

939
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,120
What the hell is going on?

940
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,960
You'll need my car.

941
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,680
We need my car.

942
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,080
- Don't! Stop!
- Where's your jacket?

943
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,600
My name is Hussein Malik.

944
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,840
for three years I've worked

945
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,240
as an undercover agent
for our Secret Services

946
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,160
and infiltrated Nabil Alawi
and his circle.

947
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,560
Three months ago,
I discovered a plot by Nabil

948
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,960
to steal Semtex for the purposes
of an attack on London.

949
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,520
I informed my controllers
to arrest Nabil.

950
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,640
The following day,
the first bomb exploded.

951
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:18,240
I met with my controllers.
They tried to take my life.

952
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,440
My life is in great danger.

953
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,320
I need a guarantee of protection.

954
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,320
A Secret Service team
are after me now.

955
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:30,480
I have enclosed the evidence I have
accumulated and proof of my identity.

956
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,920
<i>Since sweeping to
power last month in a landslide victory,</i>

957
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:54,320
<i>the new government has been
quick to make domestic security</i>

958
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,120
<i>the top of their agenda.</i>

959
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,200
Having been given a mandate by
the public with such

960
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,080
a resounding election victory,

961
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:05,440
it's our duty to follow that lead,
and to prioritize making

962
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,760
our country absolutely safe
from these cowardly terrorists.

963
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,320
<i>One of
the government's first steps</i>

964
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:16,400
<i>was the removal of the Secret
Service's old guard, Sir Scott Catesby,</i>

965
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,400
<i>and the passing of
more stringent terror laws</i>

966
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:23,040
<i>which saw the deportation
of the radical cleric Nabil Alawi.</i>

967
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:27,800
I am returning to my country
of birth tomorrow

968
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:30,920
but I am distraught that the country

969
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:35,000
that is my home is expelling me
on false charges.

970
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,840
I will fight for my corner.
God save the Queen.

971
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,720
<i>Last week also saw</i>

972
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,040
<i>the first official announcement
into the bombings.</i>

973
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:48,400
The perpetrators
were a home-grown cell.

974
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,680
None had been identified as
potential threats prior to the attacks.

975
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:58,040
Meaning they were all cleanskins,

976
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,080
completely unknown to any
of the intelligence services.

977
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,440
<i>The ringleader,
Ashraf Ahmed,</i>

978
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,960
<i>was personally responsible for
the bombing of the Glassmore Hotel.</i>

979
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:11,480
<i>The bomb was a timed device
placed in a luggage item,</i>

980
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,560
<i>causing a massive explosion
in the foyer of the hotel.</i>

981
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,880
<i>Ahmed himself was
killed by security services</i>

982
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:22,640
<i>as he tried to trigger a suicide device
just prior to the foyer device exploding.</i>

983
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,280
<i>Helen James, head of the
Glassmore Hotel Victims Committee,</i>

984
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,800
<i>had this to say about the findings.</i>

985
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,880
I don't see how you solve
the underlying problem

986
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:36,160
and I don't think anyone really does.
And, of course, this may lead to...

987
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:40,440
to, you know, more security
and more troops going out

988
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,720
and possibly more people being killed,

989
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,520
but I don't see how
that solves the problem.

990
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,280
Ewan! I thought they'd gotten to you.

991
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,320
There you go.

992
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,280
It was with his files.

993
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,240
You must have left it
when you last met.

994
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,240
You knew all about the bombings.

995
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,320
Pretended you were
tying to stop them.

996
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,040
You worked with this Nabil,

997
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,280
then got him safely deported
without arrest.

998
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:20,440
And I wasn't meant to make it out alive.

999
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,920
You were in line with
a promotion of the new government,

1000
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:27,160
helped them win, got rid of your boss.
Must be happy with you.

1001
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,720
Played me perfectly.

1002
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:36,920
Knew all about my wife.

1003
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,760
Knew I'd kill anyone you put
in front of me.

1004
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,200
You can use her
as an excuse if you want.

1005
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:51,560
But what you do is in your nature.

1006
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:03,280
I love my country.
I'd kill for it and I'd die for it.

1007
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:06,680
Good for you.

1008
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,520
The press have been sent
copies of these files.

1009
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:14,480
They show you were responsible.

1010
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,520
Those files are nonsense you made up.

1011
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,520
No one will believe it.

1012
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,000
They might...

1013
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:25,400
if you buckle under
the pressure of the story.

1014
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,640
You're out of your mind.

1015
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:37,520
It's in my nature.
