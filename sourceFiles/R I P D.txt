1
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,320
<i>You think you've
had a bad day at work?</i>

2
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,406
<i>I think I got you beat.</i>

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,167
<i>That's not me.</i>

4
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,410
<i>Nope, that's my partner.</i>

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,447
Suck it!

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,600
<i>There I am.</i>

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,160
<i>Three or four days ago, I
didn't know this world existed.</i>

8
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,444
<i>But three or four days ago,</i>

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,648
<i>I wasn't in the Rest
In Peace Department.</i>

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,490
Boo!

11
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,723
I heard you
coming a mile away.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,131
Look at this, French girl gets
the drop on Boston's finest.

13
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,170
You got the drop on me, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

14
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,924
But I feel like
a genius right now.

15
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,690
I couldn't have
planned this better.

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,241
Well, genius, there is an
orange tree in the backyard.

17
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,244
How did that get there?

18
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,402
Oh, yeah, there is an orange
tree in the backyard.

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,766
How weird.

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,526
Hmm.

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,931
I don't know
how it got here.

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,411
Me neither.

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,244
You know it's a symbol of
prosperity, don't you?

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,606
No, I've never
heard that.

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,000
His,yeah.
Ask anyone in Florida.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,320
No, you're crazy.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,448
This tree is never gonna
make it through the winter.

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,322
We might not make
it through the winter

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,721
in this freezing
little house!

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,451
I love our
freezing little house.

31
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,721
You do, do you?

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,928
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,284
But don't you want more?

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,841
You're always
worried about money.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,604
Don't you want
a real house? A car?

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,525
I don't worry
about money, you do.

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,921
I have everything
I need right here.

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,566
My husband, with me.

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,964
Well, you'll
always have that.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,281
I gotta go to work.

41
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,124
I'll tell you when
you can go to work.

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,328
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,928
Hey!

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,041
Watch that ankle.
I love you, baby.

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,401
Bye. Love you.

46
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,088
Got my picture in
a trophy case, I see.

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,049
Look at that.
Already immortalized.

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,249
Right place, right time.
What can I say?

49
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,084
Hey, Bobby.
Hey.

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,406
Murph! Jesus, get a
robe or something.

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,523
You're asking too
much of that towel.

52
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,927
Morning, partner.
Morning.

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,845
Hey, guys.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,604
Love to have you at the union
meeting Monday. BOTH: Oh!

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,205
No, no!
Sweet Jesus, Murphy.

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,328
I will shoot that thing.

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,561
That's pretty
devastating.

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,166
It's gonna be a while before
I get that image out.

59
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,167
Hey,
what did you do with yours?

60
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,044
I buried it.
Really?

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,166
I thought you were joking about that.
But it's not the worst idea.

62
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,527
It's gold,
you bury it. Right?

63
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,770
Listen, Bobby.

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,521
I'm out.

65
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,082
You're out?

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,281
Look.

67
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,880
Nothing has to
change for you.

68
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,691
You do whatever you want, but I'm
putting mine in evidence. It's done.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,651
Nicky, I said
I would move it for us.

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,960
I'll take care of everything.

71
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,320
That's not what I'm
talking about, Bobby.

72
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,290
I'm talking about the way she
looked at me this morning,

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,361
I knew.

74
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,967
Look, we went in there to make
a drug bust, which we did.

75
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,128
We didn't expect this gold
to fall into our laps.

76
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,043
We weren't looking
for it, but it happened.

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,729
The way I see it,
you do it for Julia.

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,041
For your future together.
It's simple.

79
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,361
No, she's happy.
I'm not gonna risk that.

80
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,044
I'm sorry, buddy.

81
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,727
You're right.

82
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,208
I hate it
when you're right.

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,049
We gotta turn
the whole thing in.

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,882
There goes the speedboat.

85
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,166
Look.

86
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,888
You don't have to worry, I'm
not wagging my finger at you.

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,166
You do whatever
you want to do.

88
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,408
No, it's bothering me, too.

89
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,804
So, let's grow old
and poor together.

90
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,451
Listen up, we got Garza.
We got an address.

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,127
Wait, you got Garza? You
got actual eyes on him?

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,850
An informant gave up
his whole meth operation.

93
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,291
He's there, we got him.

94
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,961
Okay, we're
in business, partner.

95
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,088
Get another picture
in the trophy case.

96
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,005
You know how long we've been
waiting for Garza to slip up.

97
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,970
This guy's a meth dealer, a cop killer.
He's got 30 guys with him.

98
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,166
He's not gonna go easy.

99
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,891
Now, stand by for inspiring,

100
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,042
motivating words
from Detective Bobby Hayes.

101
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,884
How about we don't
get shot today?

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,368
That's great advice.
You're a good cop.

103
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,886
Detective Hayes advises
we should avoid getting shot.

104
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,440
And also, everybody should put
their charm bracelets on now.

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,329
Hey, that's
my grandmother's

106
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,084
Saint Christopher
medal, jackass.

107
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,241
It's adorable.

108
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,606
I wear it for protection.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,048
It's for protection?
Well, this stops bullets.

110
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,248
Yours stops you
from getting dates.

111
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,561
Let's go!

112
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,363
Move it! Move it!
Let's go!

113
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,883
On my lead. Let's put
them on their heels.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,526
Hey. Be safe,
will you?

115
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,201
Knock, knock.

116
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,846
Police officer!

117
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,530
Take
the stuff out of here.

118
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,603
Bag the stuff!
Bag the stuff!

119
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,325
I see Garza.

120
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,800
He's on the catwalk!

121
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,285
Damn it! Garza's
out the south window.

122
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,121
Jesus!

123
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,929
Whoa. That was close.
What the hell are you doing?

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,047
You almost got me.

125
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,046
But,

126
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,603
I can't let you
turn that gold in.

127
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,566
What?

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,923
<i>My husband, with me.</i>

129
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,645
Tough day.

130
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,523
It's normal to be a little
tongue-tied at first.

131
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,968
I want you to know
that I'm here to help you.

132
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,125
I've sat in that chair.

133
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,328
So take your time.

134
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,841
Ease into it.

135
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,051
Ease into what?

136
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,563
Come on, genius.
I know you can get there.

137
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,121
This is a joke.

138
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,128
Hilarious. Ha-ha-ha.

139
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,121
I'm dead?

140
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,084
Let's be honest,
being a dirty cop

141
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,606
is one of the higher
shot-in-the-face-percentage jobs.

142
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,806
That's not who I am.

143
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,928
Really, pretty boy?

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,402
How did it feel as you were
headed towards Judgment?

145
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,527
Comfortable?

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,445
Feel like you
were bound for glory?

147
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,966
Or were you a little worried
that you were going down?

148
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,486
I thought so.

149
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,685
You're lucky, Nick.

150
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,766
You have skills that we want.
So we're giving you a choice.

151
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,889
You can take your
chances with Judgment,

152
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,721
or,

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,002
you can join the R.I.P.D.

154
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,441
The R.I.P.D?

155
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,329
Rest In Peace Department.

156
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,962
I get it. It's cute.

157
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,001
Simply put

158
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,331
we find dead people that have
managed to escape Judgment.

159
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,486
We ship them off back down
to where they belong.

160
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,449
The tour is 100 years.

161
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,444
If you say yes, we'll send you back
down to Boston, your home turf.

162
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,851
I'll do it.

163
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,200
That's not gonna work.

164
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,725
What's not gonna work?
I said I'm in.

165
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,451
I know what you're thinking. You got
rooked, you want your old life back.

166
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,521
You want Julia.

167
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,810
No. You asked me to help you,
and I'm here to help.

168
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,926
You really don't think
I can read you?

169
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,562
I know everything there is
to know about you.

170
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,527
Don't squander
this opportunity, Nick.

171
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,762
I know for a fact
you can use a good

172
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,082
recommendation on
Judgment Day, okay?

173
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,361
I think you're smelling
what I'm selling.

174
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,321
Any more questions?

175
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,571
What's with
the Steely Dan?

176
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,362
No idea.
It's always playing.

177
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,006
It seems to relax people.

178
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,805
Let's do this.
Yes, let's.

179
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,051
This Will tickle a bit.

180
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,647
What the...

181
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,401
Clench 'em
and get over here.

182
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,730
Hey,
are you my lawyer?

183
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,040
Settle down!

184
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,651
This is holding.
We call them "Deados."

185
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,166
Until they pop, they
look like regular people,

186
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,244
so no one except us knows
they're monsters inside.

187
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,811
You see, if you
slip through the cracks

188
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,166
and stay on Earth
after you die,

189
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,571
your soul rots.

190
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,483
If they rot,
the world rots.

191
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,326
Global warming, black plague,
bad cell reception, get it?

192
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,686
Without the R.I.P.D.,

193
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,091
the world would
have been overrun

194
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,845
by these dead people
some time in 1954.

195
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,968
How is staying
an option?

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,923
A hundred-and-fifty-thousand
people die every day.

197
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,970
This system wasn't designed to
handle that kind of volume.

198
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,762
Welcome to the big league.

199
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,922
R.I.P.D. Boston.

200
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,330
Before you are the greatest law
officers who ever lived and died.

201
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,767
We're the third biggest
precinct in the force.

202
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,761
What's the first?

203
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,251
Boca.

204
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,085
R.I.P.D. Scottsdale
does a lot of volume, too.

205
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,686
Trust me, chest hair is
making a big comeback.

206
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,729
I'm telling you,
chicks dig it.

207
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,167
It's a lot to take in
on your first day dead.

208
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,648
But don't worry, your partner
will explain it all to you.

209
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,166
No! Get your
hands off me!

210
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,088
I said,
get your hands

211
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,685
off

212
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,687
me!

213
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,081
Come on, Roy.

214
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,247
Oh, you come on.

215
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,687
Just because I'm the only
one willing to lethal-up.

216
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,887
Oh, Jesus.

217
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,322
No, you Jesus!

218
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,969
Roy!
What?

219
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,604
He was going for the door.

220
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,770
I'll plant a gun on him if it
makes you feel any better.

221
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,764
Would you like to take this
up with Eternal Affairs?

222
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,605
We both know what this is
about, don't we, honey pot?

223
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,926
Not the time, Roy.

224
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,767
Why not have it out now?
I'm comfortable.

225
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,164
Roy, meet your new partner,
Nick Walker.

226
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,807
We've been over this before.
I'm a one-man operation.

227
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,121
Not a choice, Roy.

228
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,481
No. You gotta earn that.

229
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,248
Come on, rookie.

230
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,642
Grab your huevos.

231
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,484
<i>Please follow
all posted regulations.</i>

232
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,362
<i>Department hygiene regulations
are for your benefit.</i>

233
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,286
Tuck on in.
Don't be shy.

234
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,805
Goin' for a ride.

235
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,922
You ever think about hiding
this place a little better?

236
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,083
When was the last time
you got a VCR repaired?

237
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,847
Point taken.

238
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,444
That's right,
you're back.

239
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,331
Don't wet your pants
over it. Come on.

240
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,363
Don't wanna be late.
Proctor likes to

241
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,443
start you off
with some closure.

242
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,325
Get in!

243
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,726
Disappointing
turnout, huh?

244
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,083
Expected more.

245
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,683
We got a lot to talk about,

246
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,366
but for now,
I'm just gonna step back,

247
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,648
let you soak it in
for a minute.

248
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,569
This moment is
not about me.

249
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,722
This is about you

250
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,122
letting go.

251
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,611
Thank you for
letting me soak it in.

252
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,288
I'll wait for you.
All right.

253
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,122
Do you know
what my funeral was?

254
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,843
Watching a bunch of coyotes
pick my carcass clean

255
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,281
and drag my bones
off into a cave.

256
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,240
A freaking cave, hoss.

257
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,961
Here it comes.

258
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,329
Be careful, now!

259
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,648
Julia? Julia!

260
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,048
I'm here. I don't
know how, but I'm here.

261
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,170
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

262
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,241
Can we just talk?
Can we just...

263
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,486
Please don't touch me.
...go somewhere?

264
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,926
Julia? Hey, Julia!

265
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,608
What's your problem, huh?

266
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,090
You piece of shit.

267
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,725
Get out of here.
Just relax.

268
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,368
Get back on the meds, buddy.

269
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,041
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

270
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,841
Let me go!

271
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,324
That went well.

272
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,645
I tried to do
something nice for you.

273
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,131
What just happened?

274
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,130
How could
she not know it was me?

275
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,285
To them, you don't look like
you, you don't sound like you.

276
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,728
If you try to tell 'em who you
are, it comes out all garbled up.

277
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,609
The universe,
in its ultimate wisdom,

278
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,563
will not let you
reveal yourself.

279
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,364
It's smarter than us.

280
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,211
That's sick.

281
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,128
Consider it the universe's
witness protection program.

282
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,247
So, what do I look like?

283
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,321
Here.

284
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,368
These are
your IDs.

285
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,121
Some federal. A lot of utilities.
Whatever gets us access.

286
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,404
Really?
An old Chinese guy?

287
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,921
What about you?

288
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,760
Well, I guess you win, Roy.

289
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,444
Let me bring you up to
speed with what's on my plate.

290
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,842
When you ride with me,
you ride with the best.

291
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,210
The pace is lightning,
expectations high.

292
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,726
Things are gonna come at you
fast, they're gonna come hot,

293
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,881
and they're gonna come wet.

294
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,561
Wet?

295
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,160
Learn to drive, bimbo!

296
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,447
You've done this before?
Driving?

297
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,324
You're gonna get your feet
wet with a standard pickup.

298
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,922
Find the suspect
and then test him.

299
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,002
See if he's a Deado.

300
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,846
And then...

301
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,569
Look at the ankles
on that girl.

302
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,041
That's what you're into, ankles?
That's what does it for you?

303
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,686
In my day, women, they
dressed very conservatively.

304
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,244
Mmm. That makes you
way less creepy.

305
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,966
When exactly was your day?

306
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,202
1800s, buddy.

307
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm what we used
to call a "lawman."

308
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,760
Marshal Roicephus Pulsipher.

309
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,161
"Roicephus"?

310
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,607
It was considered a very
sexy name at the time.

311
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,410
It sounds like an STD.

312
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,851
Would you care to drive?

313
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,482
I didn't get a peek
at your wife's ankles.

314
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,449
Not one more word
about her.

315
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,411
Listen, rook.

316
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,164
You better work on getting a little
distance, because you two are over.

317
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,129
You just worry
about yourself, partner.

318
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,281
Whoa.

319
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,408
You ain't my partner, rook.

320
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,086
You're just the ass in the other
seat until I say contrary.

321
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,089
I had a partner.

322
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,408
Greatest man I ever knew.

323
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,244
Right up until
he shot me in the back.

324
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,089
That's what
"partner" will get you.

325
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,889
Tell me about it.
How do you think I got here?

326
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,487
You got shot with
a modern bullet.

327
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,490
I would've loved a modern bullet.
Sanitary, at least.

328
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,684
That's exactly how it felt as
it passed through my face.

329
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,807
Sanitary.

330
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,769
The term "partner"
died when I did.

331
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,201
You got it, Roicephus.

332
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,368
"Roicephus."
Roicephus.

333
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,601
Just call me "Roy."

334
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,170
I was gonna do that.

335
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,328
Or "Cephus."

336
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,330
Now, listen up.

337
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,841
This is tactical, rook.

338
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,524
Tactical?
A bag of Indian food?

339
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,889
Yeah. I got a tip on a possible
Deado in this building.

340
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,405
Now, listen and learn.

341
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,566
Deados put off
a bad dead mojo.

342
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,368
Infect everything
with their soul stank.

343
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,048
Infect everything
for the worse.

344
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,929
People and things.

345
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,722
There you go. Broken
shit is a dead giveaway.

346
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,246
Ah.

347
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,810
Soul killers.

348
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,285
Hit a Deado in the head with one of
these, and it's got to be the head...

349
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,761
Personally, I find
the face most gratifying.

350
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,883
...he's erased
from the cosmos.

351
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,924
Won't hurt live ones,
will hurt us.

352
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,764
So, you be extra careful
where you point that thing.

353
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,763
I'm pretty solid
on gun safety.

354
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,924
I saw that ankle piece
you're strapping.

355
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,881
Live-world gun don't
do diddly-squat here.

356
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,804
You can keep your eyes off
my ankles, thank you.

357
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,482
Watch me sniff this out.

358
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,689
Even more promising.

359
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,922
It's always the quiet one.

360
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,162
You ready? You pumped?

361
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,371
I need you all here. Get
your snowman on, get frosty.

362
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,849
Alert, icy-hot.

363
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,287
Is this you trying
to sound like a cop?

364
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,204
Because it throws up
a lot of red flags for me.

365
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,206
You gotta learn the lingo,
hombrito.

366
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,090
I'm frosty.
Don't worry about it.

367
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,211
Senior officer
gets to knock, rook.

368
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,964
I've got 15 years
on the force.

369
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,684
Knock off
the "rookie" bullshit.

370
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,882
Oh, you've done this before?

371
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,169
You know what's waiting
for you behind the door?

372
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,328
You can take your 15 years, you
can flush it down the toilet,

373
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,608
because this ain't that.

374
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,047
I knock, you do the cards.

375
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,050
Stanley Nawicki.

376
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,290
We're with
the Department of Health.

377
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,087
Is there a problem?

378
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,571
Well, Mr. Nawicki,

379
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,724
we suspect that
you might be dead.

380
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,761
Is this really
necessary?

381
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,041
No offense, but you
sound kind of crazy.

382
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,246
None taken.

383
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,161
Just a routine test and
we'll be out of your hair.

384
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,084
I am not dead.

385
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,211
I mean, that's...
Check my pulse, go ahead!

386
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,010
Rook, first question.

387
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,084
"It's late
on Ash Wednesday.

388
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,244
"An Asian teenager
in a slammed-outAcura

389
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,404
"offers you a plate
of chicken vindaloo.

390
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,406
"Do you accept?"

391
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,451
How am I supposed
to answer that?

392
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,011
You tell me.

393
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,524
Okay, the answer is no.

394
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,088
What's the problem?
Is it the teenager?

395
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,083
The ash?

396
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,962
Is it the Japanese
performance sedan?

397
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,681
Maybe it's the Indian food.

398
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,881
What?

399
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,008
Maybe you hate Injuns.

400
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,090
No. That's...

401
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,281
Card.

402
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,650
"The teenager is Armenian.
The day is Rosh Hashanah.

403
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,564
"The dish is saag paneer."

404
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,051
Uh...

405
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,121
I don't want it.

406
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,321
Why not?

407
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,646
Too spicy? Too mushy?

408
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,406
You...

409
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,086
- You can't eat during an interview.
- I don't want...

410
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,690
You don't what?

411
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,171
Card!

412
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,651
"The car is a lime-green Scion.
The season is the solstice.

413
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,166
"The dish is
chicken tikka masala."

414
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,920
- No.
- Yes.

415
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,161
No.
Yes, it is!

416
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,005
The dish is chicken tikka!
The dish is chicken tikka!

417
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,922
Oh, yeah,
that's a Deado.

418
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,805
Big old mouth coming in.

419
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,685
Feller was
a snitch in life.

420
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,447
See, Nick?
Like that. Metaphorical.

421
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,328
For some reason, Indian
food seems to do the trick.

422
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,527
Maybe it's the cumin.

423
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,769
You can bag this one.
My treat.

424
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,411
No. I'm not
going near that.

425
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,847
Where's that
15 years now, frosty?

426
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,483
You gotta get comfortable with the
visuals and the smell profile.

427
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,204
All right.
Go on!

428
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,884
Spread 'em.
Come on, let's go.

429
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,564
Hurry up, let's
get this over with.

430
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,127
Once they pop,
they know it's over.

431
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,201
Right, pal?

432
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,362
Put all your hands
behind your back.

433
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,285
Stupid space cuffs.

434
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,687
Hey!

435
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,601
No!

436
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,401
You want it?

437
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,121
Ah!

438
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,804
You got it!

439
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,884
Nick! Grab him!

440
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,088
Get the rest of him!

441
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,407
Contain!

442
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,081
Holy shit.

443
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,284
Giddyup, pony!

444
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,487
Whoa! No, no!

445
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,050
Relax your body!

446
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,406
What?

447
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,210
Relax body!

448
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,768
Give me a reason.

449
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,365
Doesn't have to be
a good one.

450
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,404
Actually, doesn't
even have to make sense.

451
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,122
Fun, right?

452
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,850
You might have noticed
we're pretty durable.

453
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,525
It still hurts.

454
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,603
That's why
rook's the bottom.

455
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,444
Bottom.

456
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,527
Bottom!

457
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,051
Okay-

458
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,600
I guess that's
emotionally understandable.

459
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,731
You're really gonna
rummage through that?

460
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,446
Brief after-action report.

461
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,282
Now, you were below
average in the room,

462
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,601
but you did respond well to my
steering during the airborne portion.

463
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,843
Your internal organs provided
me a very soft landing.

464
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,924
You have a very
impressive crumple zone.

465
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,969
With the exception
of letting yourself

466
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,969
get attached
directly to the beastie...

467
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,041
Stop talking.

468
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,521
...you were solid.
C-plus.

469
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,091
Stop talking.

470
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,004
Just doing my job.
Stop it. Stop talking!

471
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,286
You're the one
who's talking.

472
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,403
You ran your mouth
at my funeral.

473
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,648
You ran your mouth when you
pushed me out of a building,

474
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,211
and used my body
as a cushion.

475
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,601
You've run your mouth non-stop
since the minute we met!

476
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,046
I think I know
what's going on here.

477
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,642
No, no, no! Shut up! You
shut up and let me deal.

478
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,001
All right, you deal.
Deal with the upchuck.

479
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,286
Come to think of it,
with all this tantrumery,

480
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,841
I'm beginning to think that I might
have been a little too generous

481
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,684
with the "plus" on that C.

482
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,042
I might just have
to lower your grade.

483
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,641
Relax body.

484
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,768
My hat!

485
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,886
My hat!

486
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,130
My hat!

487
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,650
New grade. F!

488
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,449
The bus, I can forgive.

489
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,524
My hat? I can't even
talk about that now.

490
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,081
Let's go, go, go!
Time is a factor. Let's go.

491
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,481
What the hell is this?
A fire drill?

492
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,880
I never seen it
this busy.

493
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,440
Seems like every Deado
moved to Boston last week.

494
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,363
What did I say?
Get back out there.

495
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,284
No breaks for anyone until
this surge is under control.

496
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,204
If I didn't need you
back on the streets...

497
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,044
What? You'd have my ass?

498
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,201
Don't be a cliché.

499
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,123
You let him get out the window.
Aren't you better than that?

500
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,965
You're the one who put me
with training wheels, here.

501
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,883
But go on, make a show.
Be the boss.

502
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,531
You still have a hard time with
the "boss" part, don't you?

503
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,489
You played the game,
got what you wanted.

504
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,605
I don't play the game.

505
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,607
And my ass is
mine and mine alone!

506
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,569
Eagerly noted!

507
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,608
Come on.
It's flat, anyway.

508
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,563
Roy, Nawicki was trying awfully
hard to protect this gold.

509
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,483
Don't you think we should try
to figure out what it is?

510
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,686
Trust me,
it's nothing.

511
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,007
Ninety-nine percent of
these things are just

512
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,401
fundraising items
for various religions.

513
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,845
Just crap.

514
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,366
What about
the one percent?

515
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,763
That's why we
lock them up in here.

516
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,604
Bag it,
tag it and bury it deep.

517
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,205
Is that all of it?
That's it.

518
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,805
Sign here, please.

519
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,361
Roy, listen.

520
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,441
What?

521
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,329
Nawicki cared an awful
lot about that gold.

522
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,526
Yeah.

523
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,086
He was trying to
hide it from us. Why?

524
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,401
So, now
you're all gung-ho, huh?

525
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,688
I'm thinking
we should follow up.

526
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,240
Let me guess.
Genius has a plan.

527
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,806
Genius wants to get out on
the street and work this.

528
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,120
I think that you
can help me with that.

529
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,124
You know why? Because every
great cop that I've ever known

530
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,651
has their own informant.

531
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,085
Big Roy...

532
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,882
Big Roy,
he's gotta have one.

533
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,727
You want an informant?

534
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,087
Big Roy's got
the best informant.

535
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,562
<i>Now batting for the
Red Sox, number 34, David Ortiz.</i>

536
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,604
Elliot.
He's a pain-in-the-ass Deado.

537
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,645
All he cares about
is the Sox.

538
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,281
So, I let him stick around
in exchange for information.

539
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,761
Here.

540
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,088
You're in mourning.
You got a hole to fill.

541
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,204
You know, I can't
taste anything.

542
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,442
Of course not,
you're dead.

543
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,126
R.I.P.D. don't eat,
we don't sleep.

544
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,771
You're here to kick Deado
ass, that's about it.

545
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,444
Then why would
you eat this?

546
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,409
I enjoy the mouth feel.

547
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,124
How's it going, Elliot?

548
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,887
We're up.

549
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,645
But they're hitting like
crap. We'll blow it.

550
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,723
Knock yourself out.

551
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,566
Hello, Elliot.

552
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,961
One of your buddies was willing
to get erased for this.

553
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,369
Why?

554
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,646
Rook.

555
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,405
That belongs in evidence.

556
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,209
I thought you were
some kind of rebel, Roy.

557
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,603
I fought for the North.

558
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,487
Would you mind terribly if I
got back to my investigation?

559
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,369
Go continue
your investigation.

560
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,206
Tell me what
this is, Elliot.

561
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,522
That looks like
a big hunk of gold.

562
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,090
Uh-huh. That's not gonna
cut it. Try again.

563
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,646
Hey! Hey! Get
your hands off me!

564
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,924
You behave
yourself now, Elliot.

565
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,163
Because of me, you're sitting there
all cozy and not lying in a pine box.

566
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,488
Not walking the desert, trying to
get your femur back from a coyote.

567
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,490
You cops
are all the same.

568
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,642
Always obsessing
about how you bit it.

569
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,888
How was your funeral,
newbie?

570
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,126
Did you cry when they gave your wife
that nice folded-up flag?

571
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,801
Hey-

572
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,041
That's fun, right?

573
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,248
I think we both know there's
no Red Sox on the other side,

574
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,526
so why don't
you cooperate?

575
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,486
I apologize for
my poor attitude.

576
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,808
May I take
a closer look, sir?

577
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,086
You may.

578
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,489
Look, I'm sorry to disappoint,
but this is crap.

579
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,528
Look, Deados,
they're sentimental.

580
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,649
A lot of them believe
in this talismanic junk.

581
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,406
If it was something else, there'd
be some chatter out there.

582
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,326
I would know.

583
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,209
All right,
we're done here.

584
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,083
These hats are crap.

585
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,005
Keep your ears
open for me.

586
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,531
Yes, sir.

587
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,283
You gave him the gold?

588
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,170
Did you see him squirm?
We got him.

589
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,049
"Got him"? What do you
mean, "we got him"?

590
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,281
What did we get?

591
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,328
Tell you what he got,
he got the gold!

592
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,124
Which you gave him!

593
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,085
What the hell is
the matter with you?

594
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,763
I'm pissed about my hat.

595
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,605
Well, then.
Looky, looky.

596
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,841
I'm gonna treat you to a
little modern law enforcement.

597
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,048
This is called
"giving the dog a bone."

598
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,167
Bones?

599
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,086
What's he doing?

600
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,801
Okay, that's weird,

601
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,247
because that looks
exactly like your ex-partner.

602
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,810
The one
who shot you dead.

603
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,648
Okay, I'm interested.
Color me interested.

604
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,282
This must be
chafing you, huh?

605
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,882
First, the guy smoked
you like a knockwurst,

606
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,923
and now he's got guys
just handing him gold.

607
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,206
Let me think,
just let me think.

608
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,120
What's there to think about? The man's
just schooling you left and right.

609
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,926
Your own partner.

610
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,161
And the trifecta.

611
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,285
Sleeping with your wife.

612
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,081
Because this is
your house, isn't it?

613
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,401
Total humiliation.

614
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,530
It's just a pants-down
spanking in the supermarket.

615
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,962
He's not sleeping with Julia.

616
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,760
Want to bet?

617
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,291
Yeah, let's.

618
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,806
Winner shoots the loser in the
face as many times as he wants.

619
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,209
I'm not 100 percent
confident with my read.

620
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,371
Some cannolis from Mike's.

621
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,565
I was thinking
how Nick used to

622
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,210
make us stop and
get them for you.

623
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,804
Thank you.
Thank you, Bobby.

624
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,564
Hey, Julia, did Nick
seem all right to you?

625
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,929
I mean, was he
concerned about anything?

626
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,640
No.

627
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,121
Okay. Okay.

628
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,411
Why?

629
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,404
I'm sorry I got
to do this now.

630
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,924
Nick said
he buried something.

631
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,324
If he's not sleeping with her, it's
kind of funny he's here, isn't it?

632
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,243
Unless you guys
have a pact where he

633
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,169
scrubs the porn off
your laptop for you.

634
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,287
I get that.

635
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,569
Classy, actually.

636
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,841
He gave this to me.
He knew I wanted it.

637
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,686
What are you saying, that he just did
this to hide something under it?

638
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,886
I don't know.

639
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,242
But I've got
to take a look.

640
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,290
I was hoping I was wrong.

641
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,810
Really? He stole this?

642
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,526
Oh, God, I feel sick.

643
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,885
You crooked son of a bitch. When
were you gonna tell me about this?

644
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,249
Put the gun down.
Shut up.

645
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,442
Just get it away from me.
I don't want to see it.

646
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,648
Don't worry.
Don't worry about a thing.

647
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,165
He was my best friend.

648
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,967
I don't even know
who he was.

649
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,724
Get off of me or
I'll break your legs.

650
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,126
Explanation, now!

651
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,764
We took something
from a bunch of shit-rats

652
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,047
who would have turned it into
guns or drugs or who knows what.

653
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,248
It was a victimless crime.
End of story.

654
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,810
Why would
the Deados want it?

655
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,963
You think Hayes and I
knew about this Deado shit?

656
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,566
It was just money to me. I was
trying to make our life better.

657
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,849
Well, you did a good job
of that, didn't you?

658
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,521
Why don't you go try
the Chinaman thing again?

659
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,090
Explain it to her.
That went well.

660
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,841
Try it again
if it makes you...

661
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,365
Gold's getting away.

662
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,446
Come on, tighten up.

663
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,807
My wife sees me
as a piece of shit.

664
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,009
Actually, she sees you
as an old Chinese guy.

665
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,007
And by the way, Grandpa
Chen's a pretty solid look.

666
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,491
Helps with stakeouts.

667
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,687
The only thing that I ever cared
about is what she thought of me.

668
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,888
That's all that matters.
The only thing.

669
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,330
What she thinks,
that's who I am.

670
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,926
And I blew that.
Destroyed it.

671
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,531
Boo-hoo.

672
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,681
Excuse me?

673
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,364
You heard me.
Boo-de-hoo.

674
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,721
You might be the worst
person I've ever met.

675
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,204
Sadly, you do not get to tell
her how you did it all for her.

676
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,167
And where exactly do you
think your tragedy ranks

677
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,368
on the scales of
cosmic injustice?

678
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,329
Pakistan-earthquake level?

679
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,769
Killing Fields level?
For me, it was pretty big.

680
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,362
You think you're the only one
who was cut down in his prime?

681
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,488
You don't think
I felt unresolved

682
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,767
as my face was being
devoured by a buzzard?

683
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,087
Oh, Christ.

684
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,084
You are just gonna have to learn
to sit on your regret and pain

685
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,965
until it turns into
a dull, persistent ache.

686
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,885
The way I do it.
The way a man does it.

687
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,770
I do music videos.

688
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,888
Home phone number's
on the back.

689
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,491
Excuse me?

690
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,370
I'm not a piece of meat put on
this earth for your gratification.

691
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,441
I'm a woman.

692
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,161
Respect me, or I will castrate
you like a three-year-old steer.

693
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,570
Look sharp.
We got something.

694
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,049
Oh, yeah, that's a Deado.

695
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,208
That has got
to be Hayes' fence.

696
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,009
We stay on the gold.
I got this.

697
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,131
Hold up.
Daddy's on point.

698
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,281
No thanks,
I've seen you in action.

699
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,771
You questioning
my methods?

700
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,365
You don't have a method.

701
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,444
Excuse me, sir.
A quick word?

702
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,046
Freezer.

703
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,287
Allow me.

704
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,411
My bad.

705
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,441
Let me guess.

706
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,404
R.I.P.D., huh?

707
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,763
Great looks, man!

708
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,241
You, with your Panda
Express over there.

709
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,243
Easy with the racial.

710
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,765
And you,
with your...

711
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,967
Watch it!

712
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,043
...magnificent breasts.

713
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,084
Hey, sideburns,
tell us about the gold.

714
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,841
Look, we're
all friends here.

715
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,930
Let's help
each other out.

716
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,323
You don't want to get popped,and
I don't want to pop you.

717
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,164
Oh, you don't?
No.

718
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,447
So you're just gonna give us that
case, you're gonna start talking,

719
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,090
and then you get to
keep roaming around

720
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,770
with your bitchin'
ginger sideburns.

721
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,411
You know what?

722
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,644
I'm sick of hiding.

723
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,282
Whoo!

724
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,724
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

725
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,285
That's better!

726
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,611
Hell, yeah. Let's do this!

727
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,445
Contain!

728
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,565
Contain!

729
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,366
Didn't contain!

730
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,885
Suck it.

731
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,728
Oh!
Straight butt!

732
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,011
Come on!

733
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,565
It's rodeo time.

734
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,370
Pappy's got
some roping to do!

735
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,202
How about a little help?

736
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,361
Okay-

737
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,443
Are you okay?
Somebody call 911!

738
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,648
I'm okay. Nothing to see.

739
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,165
Got to go!

740
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,561
Hey!

741
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,483
The head!
Aim for the head!

742
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,603
Still here,
you son of a bitch!

743
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,841
Ow! My ass!

744
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,883
What is that?

745
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,481
Whoo-hoo!

746
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,641
Coming through!

747
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,124
Excuse me, pardon me.
Yeehaw!

748
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,806
Here I come!

749
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,926
Yeah.

750
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,685
Relax body.

751
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,524
Whoo-hoo!

752
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,566
Rook!

753
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,441
Over here!

754
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,849
If it's not
too much trouble.

755
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,361
Thank you very much.

756
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,966
I've never seen
one like that before.

757
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,041
Never!

758
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,849
Never before
has this happened!

759
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,810
Congratulations, guys, on
your unprecedented cock-up!

760
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,847
All right!

761
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,163
You let an exposed Deado loose on the
streets in the middle of the day.

762
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,481
You were supposed to contain.
That is your most basic job.

763
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,682
There was no containing that thing. And
you failed spectacularly to contain.

764
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,649
He's right, sweetie pie.
it was different.

765
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,801
We have evidence.

766
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,248
You don't investigate, you don't get creative.
You do as you're told.

767
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,810
When you don't,
this happens.

768
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,881
<i>It was terrifying.</i>

769
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,646
<i>Whatever rampaged through the streets
of Boston today was not human.</i>

770
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,329
Now look where we are.
You get to deal with them.

771
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,641
Who in this endless stream
of freaks is "them"?

772
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,961
Eternal Affairs.
The hammer's dropping.

773
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,205
Well?

774
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,008
They're pissed.
Justifiably.

775
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,930
However, apparently, you stumbled
upon something important.

776
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,561
Don't act
so surprised, honey pot.

777
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,683
The gold that officers Pulsipher
and Walker brought in

778
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,047
are part of an incredibly
dangerous artifact

779
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,282
known as
the Staff of Jericho.

780
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,011
Oh, crap.

781
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,403
Maybe feather it in for
the new guy a little bit?

782
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,491
Remember the tunnel we pulled
you out of when you died?

783
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,042
That's the only way to get to the afterlife.
It's a one-way street.

784
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,567
This artifact, if built,
reverses the tunnel.

785
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,324
The dead rain
down on the earth.

786
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,044
That's it for
the living world.

787
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,571
Yeah, massive destruction.

788
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,008
We broke it to pieces 3,000 years ago.
Now it's back.

789
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,845
Until we get the rest of the
gold, we're on red alert.

790
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,725
Also, apparently, you need
"the blood of thine enemy."

791
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,160
There are more diagrams.

792
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,321
Why?

793
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,446
Why would someone
make something like that?

794
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,851
Come on!

795
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,006
Here I am, willing
the streets into order,

796
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,163
making headway,
year after dominant year!

797
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,242
And now, everything I've
done is being threatened

798
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,085
because of some ancient
totem forged for kicks

799
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,686
by some asshole
5,000 years ago?

800
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,004
Why even try? I mean, how
am I supposed to do it?

801
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,761
Look at you.
So proud of yourself.

802
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,200
"I got an important tube."

803
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,366
What?

804
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,920
Well, what is it?

805
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,450
Actually,

806
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,762
it looks like
you two don't need to

807
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,042
concern yourselves
with the red alert.

808
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,043
It brings me
no pleasure

809
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,848
to inform you that because
of your recent epic failure,

810
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,888
you've both been suspended,
you're off the case.

811
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,645
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

812
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,404
Hold on a sec,
we are the case.

813
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,170
We're the ones
who brought it in!

814
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,970
The feeling is that
luck was involved.

815
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,610
There'll be
a formal hearing tomorrow,

816
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,370
after which you'll
most likely be erased.

817
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,647
"Erased"?

818
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,884
So in this moment of crisis,
they're gonna suspend

819
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,651
and then erase
their best officer?

820
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,765
And this other guy?

821
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,765
Better officers
are taking over.

822
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,371
No such thing. Name one.

823
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,971
Jacobson, DuBow.

824
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,167
Waterson.
Come on.

825
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,207
Carson.

826
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,770
Jackson.
He's pretty good.

827
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,649
That guy who works
at the taco cart.

828
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,211
Shall I go on?
Okay, okay!

829
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,123
Tomorrow is my last day?

830
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,089
Most likely.

831
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,606
I'm sorry.

832
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,445
Well, shit.

833
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,526
Miss Proctor,
it's been a delight.

834
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,602
Roy, thank you very much
for your mentorship.

835
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,966
I'm sure
it meant a lot to you.

836
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,850
I got somewhere
more important to be.

837
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,521
Who are you?

838
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,884
Why are you following me?

839
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,124
Stay away from me.

840
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,442
I haven't left you.

841
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,411
It's me.

842
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,320
No.

843
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,681
So.

844
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,128
Congratulations.
You finally did it.

845
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,247
You get what you wanted?

846
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,046
I might get erased tomorrow.
What do you think I'm gonna do?

847
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,370
You're freaking her out,
if you haven't noticed.

848
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,171
I'm not from a time of
sensitivities and emotionalism.

849
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,808
And yes, in my day, I
bought my love by the hour.

850
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,531
But I do know that what
you're doing is not helping.

851
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,882
It's called haunting, hoss.
You're causing her pain.

852
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,967
Why do you think
we're here?

853
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,281
Why we do what we do?

854
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,085
It's so that Julia can
have a world to live in.

855
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,648
And, yeah,
that means without you.

856
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,849
She needs to survive you. Meet
someone new, maybe have a family.

857
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,086
Because you are
not coming back.

858
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,160
Even

859
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,050
The job is
all you have now.

860
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,726
Well, we don't
have the job anymore.

861
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,324
Nick.

862
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,562
Resolve your crap.
Do like me.

863
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,482
Like you?

864
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,369
Yes, emulate my peace.

865
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,568
Your Zen-like calm?

866
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,490
It's taken me a very long
time to achieve this state.

867
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,841
You could get there, too,
but for your weakness.

868
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,160
You know what?
I've had it.

869
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,767
I can't listen to one more self-righteous
chestnut out of your mouth.

870
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,523
I don't want to live
in your weird past with you.

871
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,001
Speaking of which,
those coyotes...

872
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,281
You be careful now.

873
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,011
Those coyotes who ate your bones
and crapped out your face?

874
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,368
In that story,
the coyotes are the heroes.

875
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,487
Hey-

876
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,722
You may think the Old West
was all shits and giggles,

877
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,087
and sarsaparilla
and two-cent whores.

878
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,321
It wasn't!

879
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,687
It was smelly,
it was violent.

880
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,525
It was ridden with dysentery
and no-account Injuns.

881
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,571
I've had a lot of anger
to get past, okay?

882
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,286
And you...

883
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,041
You, Nick, are
bringing a lot of shit out

884
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,841
that I've been suppressing
for a very long time!

885
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,769
One of them coyotes,

886
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,090
he made love to my skull.

887
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,285
Do you know what that
practice is commonly called?

888
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,481
I do.

889
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,080
And I certainly hope
he got both eyes, Roy.

890
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,166
<i>Words,
like daggers stab our heart</i>

891
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,609
<i>Boys</i>

892
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,485
<i>Gotta be the better man</i>

893
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,041
The song is
called <i>Better</i> Man.

894
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,725
Yeah, I got that.

895
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,010
<i>People,
they can break your heart</i>

896
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,489
<i>Boys</i>

897
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,246
<i>Like no coyote ever can</i>

898
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,488
Maybe I took things
a little too far.

899
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,205
"Maybe"?

900
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,525
I'm sorry.

901
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,360
You ought to take up
an instrument, Nick.

902
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,928
It might be
a tuneful way for you

903
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,122
to spend what may
be your last moments.

904
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,841
You were right
about the job, Roy.

905
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,525
We gotta get back out there.

906
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,411
"Sus-pen-dato."

907
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,887
If they want me back,
they're gonna have to beg.

908
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,168
I'm not gonna take
this lying down. You?

909
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,890
Are you gonna
sit there and mope?

910
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,089
Or do you want to help me
stop an apocalypse?

911
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,322
When you put it
that way, hell,

912
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,568
you kind of
paint me into a corner.

913
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,404
I know Hayes is sitting
on some of that gold.

914
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,528
There's no way
he's just a bagman.

915
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,888
Let me ask you something.

916
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,122
Did he like Indian food?

917
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,123
He was not a fan.

918
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,641
But something's
bugging me.

919
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,367
I rode with this guy for five
years, I never noticed any kind of

920
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,250
"soul stank."

921
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,770
I heard talk of a rare kind of
artifact that could mask it.

922
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,447
Like a spiritual deodorant.

923
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,445
It would be something he
carried with him all the time.

924
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,448
Like Grandma's
Saint Christopher medal.

925
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,806
That'd do her.

926
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,769
Let's go pop
the son of a bitch.

927
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,811
Do you know what to do?

928
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,645
Oh, yeah. I've been
waiting a long time for this.

929
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,564
You've been
waiting a long time?

930
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,086
Do you know how many years Deados
have been trying to pull this off?

931
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,400
Three thousand.

932
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,121
Not one of those jag-offs could
get all that gold together,

933
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,765
until me.

934
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,801
R.I.P.D. is not
gonna know what hit them.

935
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,682
Now, go find
yourself some trouble.

936
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,530
My pleasure.

937
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,007
<i>Hey, Julia.</i>

938
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,889
Hey. I need to talk to you.

939
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,883
Something really
strange happened to me.

940
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,081
What's going on?

941
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,685
<i>I was at the track
last night,</i>

942
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,922
and do you remember
that guy at the funeral?

943
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,241
The little Chinese guy?

944
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,921
<i>The one who was yelling?</i>

945
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,729
Slow down, slow down.
Take a deep breath.

946
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,404
I don't know.
Somehow, I feel like

947
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,801
it's Nick who's
trying to talk to me.

948
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,320
Okay-

949
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,724
I know it sounds crazy.

950
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,002
<i>I know you miss him.
I miss him, too.</i>

951
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,124
I don't think you
should be alone right now.

952
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,364
<i>I'm gonna come pick you up, and
I'm gonna take you to lunch</i>

953
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,920
and we could talk
about everything.

954
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,645
All right?

955
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,521
Okay-

956
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,971
All right.
Thank you for this.

957
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,760
Absolutely.
I'll see you later.

958
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,450
Take the front.
I'll go around back.

959
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,045
Works for me.

960
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,721
Bobby Hayes?

961
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,641
Yeah?

962
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,768
I need to ask you
a few questions

963
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,002
involving
a tandoori clay oven.

964
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,640
Sweetheart, you can ask
me anything you want.

965
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,091
Make yourself comfortable.

966
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,761
How about
a little drinky-poo?

967
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,966
Sure. I'll wet my beak.

968
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,451
Coming right up.

969
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,242
Are you looking for this?

970
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,450
Nice moves,

971
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,607
Nick.

972
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,282
Hey, tough look
to pull off.

973
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,407
I'm getting used to it.

974
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,040
You know,
it was just business.

975
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,446
Make a move, please.

976
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,521
Easy, Nick.

977
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,563
"It's late on Ash Wednesday."

978
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,563
We can skip
that part, Roy.

979
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,650
Take off the Saint
Christopher's medal.

980
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,401
Now.

981
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,481
Okay-

982
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,531
Powerful stank.

983
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,365
Where's the gold,
dead man?

984
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,681
Check the water heater.

985
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,851
Freaking super cop, here.

986
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,129
All right, saddle up.

987
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,729
We're gonna ride you in.

988
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,287
I know it's wrong,

989
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:01,126
but the whole cowboy-talk thing,
it's kind of working for me.

990
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,444
What do you got
to smile about?

991
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,123
Hey, how do you like
working with this guy?

992
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,725
He hangs on a little
tight to stuff, huh?

993
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,481
What we got together is
none of your damn business.

994
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,164
Where's the rest
of the gold, Hayes?

995
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,607
See what I mean?
He won't let it die.

996
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,124
Hey, Nick,
remember when I got shot?

997
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,487
I got that medal, and you couldn't
believe I pulled through?

998
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,205
Wild guess,
you didn't pull through?

999
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,089
Get killed by some
junkie and go to hell

1000
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,003
because I took a little on the
side to pay for lap dances?

1001
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,844
No. I don't think so.

1002
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,685
Who gets to make that call?
I don't accept it.

1003
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,841
Hey, let me
ask you something.

1004
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,161
What do you think eternal
punishment is gonna be like, Hayes?

1005
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,331
Hell can kiss my ass.

1006
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,731
I'm staying right here.

1007
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,729
"Lap dancing."

1008
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,684
That's a nice look you got.
That's nice, with the face and the hair.

1009
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,171
All right, sit down.

1010
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,689
Hey. You might
want to book that gold

1011
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,604
before your partner
gets his hands on it.

1012
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,801
What's this?

1013
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,200
That's personal.

1014
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:21,884
Then it gets booked,

1015
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,568
along with this gold
that I brought in.

1016
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,962
That's right, doll face. Despite
my chicken-shit suspension.

1017
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,487
I'm available for
a tutorial-type thing,

1018
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,887
if you or the guys
want a few tips.

1019
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,725
Maybe get yourselves
up near my level.

1020
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,484
Why did I have
to love you?

1021
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,050
We had a beautiful
moment in time.

1022
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,650
Catastrophic mistake.

1023
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,485
Run it down, but you
felt what you felt.

1024
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,286
Take a seat.

1025
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,801
This is good,
it's gonna help me

1026
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,450
get over the
shot-in-the-face thing.

1027
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,326
Whatever is waiting for you on
the other side is gonna be bad.

1028
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:00,925
Don't worry,
it's only forever.

1029
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,610
Stash this gold
with the rest of it.

1030
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,966
And here.

1031
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,091
Hey, we just booked
something just like this.

1032
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,003
It's in the basket
over there.

1033
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,761
You're gonna need to
fill out another form.

1034
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,606
I'd love to. I've got
nothing else better to do.

1035
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,807
There's one decent thing
about being a Deado, right?

1036
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,081
Mmm-hmm.

1037
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,640
We can't hear certain
frequencies so well.

1038
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,881
Roy!

1039
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,087
Come on, Nicky.

1040
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,725
You thought I'd
let you bring me here

1041
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,484
if I didn't want to
be here all along?

1042
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,891
Isn't this thing sweet?

1043
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,327
It freezes you guys up,
does nothing to us.

1044
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,482
They got one of these
artifacts for everything.

1045
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1046
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,721
Go, go, go!
Come on!

1047
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,806
Get the gold.
Take everything!

1048
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,481
It's all there?

1049
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,686
Uh-huh.

1050
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,041
Catch!

1051
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,088
Fill up all these hands.
Come on!

1052
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,364
Let's go! Let's go!

1053
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,520
What's up?

1054
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,611
Peace.

1055
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,126
Flush it.

1056
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,770
No! The gold!

1057
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,131
Here, boss.

1058
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,487
I got it all.

1059
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,171
I'm on it.

1060
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,684
Daddy's got gold!

1061
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,240
Let's build it, boys!

1062
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,284
Yeah!

1063
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,891
Oh. yeah!

1064
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,283
Damn it!
It's jammed up.

1065
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,364
Just like Main Street,
Dodge City.

1066
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,564
Them dudes,

1067
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,842
they picked the wrong venue
to make a stand.

1068
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,168
I invented this shit.

1069
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,121
Hot!

1070
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,484
I fixed it! Yeah! Phew!

1071
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,411
Go time!

1072
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,323
Let's learn you a few things
about Old West fighting.

1073
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,686
First,

1074
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,088
only a novice hides
in a church steeple.

1075
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,322
It's the first place
I'm gonna look.

1076
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,681
Second place,
hotel window, every time.

1077
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,281
Hmm.

1078
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,761
I guess there's only
one novice in their crew.

1079
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,967
Sometimes, the window
guy is on the roof.

1080
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,802
I haven't seen that before.

1081
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,930
Must be the massive destruction
Proctor was talking about.

1082
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,846
Saddle up!

1083
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,961
Hey, Julia.

1084
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,049
Hayes sent us to
give you a lift.

1085
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,963
Guys, I can still drive.

1086
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,451
It's pretty hairy
out there.

1087
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,723
He's just worried
about you.

1088
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,930
Close it up.

1089
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,923
All right. Lock it up.

1090
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,526
Nobody gets through
to the Commonwealth building.

1091
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,090
Nobody!

1092
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,087
Looks like the big one is right over
the Commonwealth building.

1093
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,281
That's where
he'll be headed.

1094
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,725
Yeah. Good read.

1095
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,409
You're agreeing with me?
That's weird.

1096
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,683
Yeah. Feels strange.

1097
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,685
Kind of tingly.

1098
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,249
Deados on wheels.

1099
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,446
That's disappointing.

1100
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,284
I was hoping to get
a little break here.

1101
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,730
Make it go away, Nick!

1102
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,400
I got it.

1103
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,685
Holy shit!

1104
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,166
That actually scared
the shit out of me.

1105
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,366
Get the gold up top.

1106
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,920
I gotta wait for
the final piece.

1107
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,567
Hey. Are you okay?

1108
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,641
What the hell is going on?

1109
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,882
Lots going on. I'm glad
you're here with me.

1110
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,166
We need to get inside.

1111
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,243
Listen. There's something
I should tell you.

1112
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,810
It's something
I've been hiding.

1113
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,166
Bobby, I think it can wait.

1114
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,004
And it might
seem a little weird.

1115
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,726
But I think you should just
try to keep an open mind,

1116
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,167
and not judge
right away, okay?

1117
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,761
Oh-ho!

1118
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,441
Eh?

1119
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,403
<i>Skycam 4 is on the
scene with continuing coverage.</i>

1120
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,363
<i>We are looking
down on the Commonwealth building</i>

1121
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,086
<i>which is swarming with, there's
really no other way to say this,</i>

1122
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,207
<i>monsters.</i>

1123
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,203
I urge everyone to stay inside
until this situation...

1124
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,481
<i>Dave!</i>

1125
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,521
Wicked.

1126
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,810
Looks like they
built a barricade.

1127
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,645
And there's Fat Elvis.

1128
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,885
Hit him in the jiggly.

1129
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,402
Whoa!

1130
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,369
Hi! Whoa!

1131
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,766
Not bad!

1132
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,761
My door!

1133
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,881
Can't shake me!

1134
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,449
Still here, dicks!

1135
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,481
Oh.

1136
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,486
Relax body.

1137
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,207
Death.

1138
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,047
I hope they have
an elevator.

1139
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,246
Oh, shit.

1140
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,687
Reverse the tunnel,
the dead come pouring back.

1141
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,569
We stay here forever.

1142
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,643
Kind of
a high-five moment.

1143
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:10,486
All we gotta do is
fire up this bad boy.

1144
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,441
Yeah!

1145
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,287
Okay-

1146
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,804
This is where it gets
a little uncomfortable.

1147
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,964
There's no great way to say
this, so I'll just say it.

1148
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,964
These ancient things, they
often involve an element of,

1149
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,690
I don't want to say
"human sacrifice,"

1150
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,886
but human sacrifice.

1151
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,122
I'll jump before
you can even touch me.

1152
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,207
Julia, come on. Be cool.

1153
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,610
This is an honor. I'm trusting
you with the heavy shit.

1154
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,126
Julia!

1155
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,369
Oh-ho! Just in time.

1156
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,891
Bobby! Don't!

1157
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,001
No!

1158
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,646
Move!

1159
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,481
Nice shot.

1160
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,200
I'm gonna go get Julia.
You take care of the Staff.

1161
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,723
That golden pecker
is coming down.

1162
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,127
You frosty?

1163
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,569
Icy hot, partner.

1164
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,201
What now, Nick?

1165
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,563
You know, it didn't
have to be Julia,

1166
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,405
but I just couldn't resist
bringing it full circle.

1167
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,801
Come on.
It's good, right?

1168
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,041
Ow!

1169
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,565
Get over here!

1170
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,125
How's it coming, Roy?

1171
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,368
It's harder than it looks!

1172
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,569
Killing you never
gets old, Nicky.

1173
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,047
Any time now!

1174
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,725
I hear you!

1175
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,369
Come on, Roy!

1176
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,570
Do some cowboy stuff!

1177
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,520
Please!

1178
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,681
Roy!

1179
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,446
There it is.

1180
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,561
No.

1181
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,251
Well, partner.

1182
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,609
I have a new partner.

1183
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,810
I missed you.

1184
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,167
I missed you so much.

1185
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,121
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1186
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,124
It's okay,
you're back with me now.

1187
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,084
That's all I wanted.

1188
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,050
But not like this.

1189
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:21,325
Julia,
you gotta live your life,

1190
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,926
without me.

1191
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,642
I don't want to say goodbye.

1192
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,484
You can't stay here.

1193
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,443
It's okay.

1194
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,287
Go.

1195
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,410
I will always love you.

1196
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,641
Goodbye.

1197
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,850
She's gonna be okay.

1198
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:10,921
Thank you.

1199
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,724
You owe me for that.

1200
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,241
Let's settle up.

1201
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,446
Sure.

1202
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,807
I would like to be allowed
to design my own medal.

1203
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,881
Not so fast.

1204
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,850
The Eternals
went ahead and had

1205
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,530
your disciplinary
hearing without you.

1206
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,684
While we were
saving the world?

1207
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,003
Nick, as a new recruit, you've
been let off with a warning.

1208
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,366
Reasonable.

1209
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,403
Roy, as punishment...
"Punishment"?

1210
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,809
Yes. Fifty-three more years
have been added to your term.

1211
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,006
Fifty-three years?

1212
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,281
That's a lot.

1213
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,330
This is
honky-tonk bullshit.

1214
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,370
You just like having me
around, don't you, Mildred?

1215
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,726
My hat.

1216
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,245
You went off
and found it?

1217
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,924
I guess I could've bought
you flowers once or twice.

1218
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,925
I like violets.

1219
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,487
She "billy goat-ed" me.

1220
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,688
It's something
we used to do.

1221
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,641
Why she covers up them ankles
with them damn white boots

1222
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,531
I'll never understand.

1223
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,204
Fifty-three more years, huh?

1224
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,568
Well, I still got
some things to work on.

1225
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:50,126
Hell, this is the third time
I've been extended.

1226
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,331
Oh, say, I got you something.

1227
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,801
What's this?

1228
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,726
I knew you weren't happy
with Grandpa Chen,

1229
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,646
so I pulled a few strings,
got you some new ID.

1230
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,609
Thank you. Thank you, Roy.
I mean that.

1231
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,326
This is great.

1232
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,450
Oh, you gotta be
shitting me.

1233
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,843
I did what I could.
Inventory is what it is.

1234
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,407
You thought this was an improvement?
