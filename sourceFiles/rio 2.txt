1
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,901
What is love if it's not with you?

2
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,322
I know when you're alone
You feel it too

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,826
In your arms is where I long to be

4
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,370
'Cause being with you gives me sanity

5
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,372
Welcome to Rio!

6
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,209
Listen to me, darling

7
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,838
I wake up every morning
thinking about the way you feel

8
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,259
I wonder if you know it

9
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,387
And what good is the party
If you're not around?

10
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,555
But listen to me now

11
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,725
What good is love?

12
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:29,271
If it's not your love

13
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,940
What good is love?

14
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,400
Am I your baby love?

15
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,069
If it's not your love

16
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,446
Is it a crazy love?

17
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,949
This is a crazy party
I'm so glad I'm here with everybody

18
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,951
Baby, move your body
Shake it to the ground

19
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,329
Break it, break it,
break it down, Blu

20
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,914
Me?

21
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,917
What's a song if you
can't hear it too?

22
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,130
Can't imagine dancing without you

23
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,008
A shooting star
Ain't really nothing to see

24
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,472
If you're not right here
Standing next to me

25
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,309
Listen to me, darling

26
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,144
I wake up every morning

27
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,688
Thinking about the way you feel

28
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,192
I wonder if you know it

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,487
What good is the party
if you're not around?

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,113
Listen to me now

31
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,324
What good is love?

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,954
If it's not your love

33
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,001
For a bird from Minnesota,
you've got some moves.

34
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,003
That wasn't a move.
That was an accident.

35
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,505
But I accept the compliment.

36
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,049
It's great Rafael
could watch the kids.

37
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,177
Yeah, it looks like
you're stuck with me all night.

38
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,012
You're my one and only, Blu.

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,724
That's a good thing,
since I'm the only other one.

40
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,352
Hey, you lovebirds! Happy New Year!

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,545
Rafi? Where are the...

42
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,314
The kids are with Luiz. No worries!

43
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,483
Worries. Right here.

44
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,988
Luiz? Where are the kids?

45
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,031
What? I don't have any kids.

46
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,157
Our kids!

47
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,535
Oh, right. I left them with Tiny.

48
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,536
Tiny?

49
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,622
What? She's an excellent babysitter.

50
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,708
I'm a terrible babysitter!

51
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,710
This is gonna be awesome!

52
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,878
All right,
I've done all the calculations...

53
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,631
and each explosion
will be perfectly synced to the beat.

54
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,342
Unless I didn't carry the one.

55
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,343
Here's my vision.

56
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,305
Red, blue, green, yellow, yellow!
Purple.

57
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,309
Here's my vision.
Boom! Crash! Bang! Kapow!

58
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,894
I don't think your parents
would like this very much.

59
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,147
Here we go.

60
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,799
Where are you going, little bird?

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,484
- Hey, what is this?
- Oh, Dad.

62
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,636
Guys, you know the rules.

63
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,863
No pyrotechnics
without adult supervision.

64
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,197
We asked Tiny.

65
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,741
That's even worse.
Sorry, Tiny.

66
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,076
You don't have to pay me, Senhor Blu.

67
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,703
Kids, next time, ask me.

68
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,413
But you always say "no."

69
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,414
No, I don't.

70
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,333
Dad, you're in denial.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,168
Honey, do I always say "no"?

72
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,755
- Yes. I mean, no.
- Great.

73
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,673
Now Mom's saying it, too.

74
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,887
Listen, we are the last
blue Spix's Macaws left on the planet.

75
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,723
We have to stay safe.
Birds of blue feathers...

76
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,018
Have to stick together.

77
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,269
I smell chicken.

78
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,108
No, no, no!

79
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,860
No, no, no!

80
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,739
By my calculations,
that's his twenty-seventh "no" today.

81
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,620
Help!

82
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:39,461
- Five, four, three, two, one!
- Everybody, fly!

83
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,088
Happy New Year!

84
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,059
Oh, man. How come Dad
gets to have all the fun?

85
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,978
Look! It worked!

86
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,899
Well, this year is off
to a great start.

87
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,547
Amazon Expedition, day seven.

88
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,340
Two thousand miles from Rio...

89
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,188
we've reached the center
of the rainforest.

90
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,346
We are surrounded
by plants and animals...

91
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,765
struggling for survival...

92
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,726
as we glide effortlessly
down the river.

93
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,104
Effortless for you.

94
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,273
How pretty.

95
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,942
Spit it out, spit it out!

96
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,822
We are near the nesting grounds
of the Amazonian Wood Quail.

97
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,907
Odontophorus gujanensis.

98
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,285
Six months ago,
we rescued this little bird...

99
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,870
from smugglers.

100
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,872
It was sick, malnourished...

101
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,291
with a broken leg, but now...

102
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,876
my trusty assistant...

103
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,339
I mean, loving wife and colleague,
will release her...

104
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,341
back to her natural habitat.

105
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,426
It's okay.

106
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,052
You can go now.

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,929
Just like this.

108
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,306
Let me talk to her.

109
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,312
Go on.

110
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,733
FREAKS!

111
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,988
Do you think she's
gonna be all right?

112
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,865
Give it some time.

113
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,709
Welcome home.

114
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,133
Wait a minute.
What is she saying, Tulio?

115
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,886
It's just hard for
her to say goodbye.

116
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,679
No.

117
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,473
I think she's trying to warn us.

118
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,892
No, no, no, Linda.

119
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,144
It might be some sort
of mating dance.

120
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,071
Tulio! Look!

121
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,365
Paddle! Now!

122
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,201
Okay, okay, okay. Paddle.

123
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,411
Watch out!

124
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,456
Paddle, paddle! Backward, backward!

125
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,000
To the right! No, left!
Forward, forward! No, no!

126
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,919
Make up your mind, Tulio!

127
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,048
Cheese and sprinkles!

128
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,518
Oh, no!

129
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,980
Paddle, paddle! Faster!

130
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,441
Tulio!

131
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,745
Linda! Linda!

132
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,289
Tulio!

133
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,714
Thank heavens you're okay.

134
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,055
Tulio, is that a...

135
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,497
Linda! This is incredible!

136
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,361
Good morning, Jewel!

137
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,664
Hey! Everyone, look what I found.

138
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,916
Blu?

139
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,001
Kids?

140
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,069
Where did everybody...?

141
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,506
Okay, who's ready for some breakfast?

142
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:36,007
Unbelievable.

143
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,594
Did you know...

144
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,180
that these whole wheat pancakes have
twice the vitamins and minerals...

145
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,348
of regular pancakes?

146
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,768
And with the blueberries,
it's four times as tasty.

147
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,772
Hey, where are the blueberries?

148
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,232
Oh, Dad!

149
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,858
Looking for this?

150
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,110
Bring it.

151
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,221
It's down to the final minutes.
He's got magic in his feet!

152
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,155
He shoots!

153
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,949
- He scores! Goal!
- Goal!

154
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,493
Yeah, I got it. I'm good.

155
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,578
Heads up, Dad!

156
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,416
No.

157
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,299
Awesome.

158
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,304
Hi, Mom.

159
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,432
Busted.

160
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,850
Time to go.

161
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,310
Hey, honey. Hey. You hungry?

162
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,521
Blu, we talked about this.

163
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,647
Did we? I don't...

164
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,482
Yeah, so, what do you got there?

165
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,483
Breakfast.

166
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,610
That's funny.
But seriously, what is that?

167
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,320
It's a Brazil nut.

168
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,598
I never thought I would find one
this close to the city.

169
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,991
I wanna show the kids
how to open one.

170
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,159
You mean like this?

171
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,703
Dad already showed us.

172
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,456
Wait. Wait, go back.

173
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,665
Mom! Dad!

174
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,833
You're on TV!

175
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,960
Doctor Tulio Monteiro,
the Bird Man of Brazil...

176
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,337
announced an important
discovery today.

177
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,966
We believe we have encountered
a wild blue Spix's Macaw...

178
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,718
deep in the Amazon jungle.

179
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,097
The blue Spix's Macaw
was thought to be practically extinct...

180
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,224
with the last remaining family
living under protection...

181
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,351
at the Blu Bird Sanctuary
in Rio de Janeiro.

182
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,853
We're famous!

183
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,565
If these birds can be found,
their home will be saved.

184
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,734
There may be a whole flock out there.

185
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,529
And if there is,
we will find them and protect them.

186
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,780
Hi, Blu!

187
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,407
Hi, Linda!

188
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,576
We're not the only ones.

189
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,204
There are more of us out there.

190
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,705
Yeah, that's great.
I'm sure they're...

191
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,041
All this time, I thought...

192
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,211
I thought we were alone.

193
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,379
Hey, it hasn't been all bad.

194
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,508
Of course not.

195
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,885
But just imagine
if there was a whole flock of us.

196
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,888
How amazing would that be?

197
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,351
- We gotta do something.
- We do?

198
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,896
Yeah, we have to fly to the Amazon
and help Linda and Tulio find them!

199
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,565
Whoa, we can't just pack up and go.

200
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,441
Why not?

201
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,736
It's about time this family
got a little air under our wings.

202
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:06,074
Look at us. IPods, TV. Pancakes?

203
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,786
We're not people, we're birds.

204
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,413
We have to get out into the wild
and be birds, Blu.

205
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,249
Let the kids connect to their roots.

206
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,959
Show them what I had.

207
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,127
They need this. We need this.

208
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,088
Come on, Blu, what do you say?

209
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,090
I don't know.

210
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,258
Maybe.

211
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,467
He didn't say "no."

212
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,469
Which means he
practically said "yes."

213
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,538
- Hey, wait a sec...
- It's gonna be so much fun!

214
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,139
Yeah!

215
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,433
We're going to the Amazon!

216
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,228
Wait. What's the Amazon?

217
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,606
The Amazon is one of Earth's
most endangered ecosystems...

218
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,733
due to illegal logging and farming.

219
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,902
Let's hope Doctor Monteiro
and his team...

220
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,656
can find these rare birds
so their home can be saved.

221
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,950
There may be a whole flock out there.

222
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,620
And if there is,
we will find them and protect them.

223
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,956
Tree huggers.

224
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,791
Get my boat ready.

225
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,128
I need to deal with this personally.

226
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,760
Next!

227
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,471
That would be me.
Okay, everybody can go home now.

228
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,142
You're looking at the next
King of Carnival!

229
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,480
Hey, big bird! Break a leg!

230
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,235
Walk it off, buddy!

231
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,280
You can't see it coming

232
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:32,994
You won't find it anywhere else

233
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,669
That was amazing!

234
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:46,007
Eva, darling, you hit every note.
Huh, guys?

235
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,510
Yeah, along with a bunch of notes
I never heard of.

236
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,678
Rafi!

237
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,014
Don't worry. I'll talk to them.

238
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,350
We'll find the perfect spot for you.

239
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,851
Antarctica, maybe.

240
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,186
You better.

241
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,772
Bye, boys.

242
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,816
See you back at home, my tasty mango!

243
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,862
None of these acts are inspiring.
I'm just not inspired.

244
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,074
Carnival is right around the corner,
and our reputations are on the line.

245
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:11,991
Copy that.

246
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,827
We need something that can make us wiggle.
Something that make us jiggle.

247
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,329
We need something that pops.

248
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,749
You know what "pop" is backwards?
Pop.

249
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,084
Next.

250
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,795
Blu?

251
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,796
Sorry, bro!

252
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:28,424
It's okay, Luiz. Good
to see you, too.

253
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,802
Listen, Blu,
we are looking for a singer...

254
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,428
a dancer, the whole package.

255
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,764
Yeah, and you're more of
a mumbler-shuffler.

256
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,224
You catch my drift?

257
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,727
No, I'm not here to audition.
I've got news.

258
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,814
I am going to the Amazon.

259
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,399
Yay.

260
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,319
The Amazon? Wow, that's wild.

261
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,114
Yeah, Jewel thinks
it'll be good for us.

262
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,281
How wild?

263
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,658
Real wild.

264
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,619
They got mosquitoes
that suck your blood like Slurpees.

265
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,163
Snakes that can swallow you whole.

266
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,793
Flesh-eating piranhas that eat flesh.

267
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,513
Great, that sounds really nice.
I'm not going.

268
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,630
Guys, guys, guys.

269
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,799
Blu, you have nothing to worry about.

270
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,093
All those stories
are highly exaggerated.

271
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,886
- You think so?
- Of course!

272
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,556
If this is important to Jewel,
just do it.

273
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,934
Happy wife, happy life.
Remember that.

274
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,061
Okay, yeah, you're right.

275
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,856
A little family vacation
might actually be fun.

276
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,482
Plus, it's not like it's forever.

277
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,734
That's the spirit.

278
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,652
Yeah. Okay.

279
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,112
Thanks, guys.

280
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,281
See you in a couple of weeks!

281
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,866
Safe travels, Blu!

282
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,451
Bring me back a souvenir!

283
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:41,330
Dawg, he ain't coming back.
He is dead.

284
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,167
Amazon!

285
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,252
Let's go! Come on, Dad! Come on!

286
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,715
Okay. Bug spray, check.
Water purifier, check. Band-Aids.

287
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,925
- I feel like I'm forgetting something.
- Cool!

288
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,845
The all-in-one adventurer's knife!

289
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,764
I'll be in charge of this.

290
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,973
That's not for you.

291
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,099
Hey, Dad, look at this.

292
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,019
Did you know the Amazon has snakes
that can swallow you whole?

293
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,355
Actually, Bia, all those stories
are highly exaggerated.

294
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,815
No, really. Look.

295
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,695
That's sick!

296
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,156
All right, are we ready to go?

297
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,532
- A fanny pack?
- Yeah.

298
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,868
Linda gave it to me.
I need it for the GPS.

299
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,186
Where's the GPS?

300
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,163
- Hey!
- Carla, we're leaving.

301
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,291
I'm not going. It's gonna be lame.

302
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,210
Okay, here it is.

303
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,546
The voice recognition makes it
totally foolproof. Here, watch this.

304
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,590
Find Linda and Tulio.

305
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,343
Searching for "Dinner in Tokyo."

306
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,137
Okay. Actually,
that does sound like a nice suggestion.

307
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,223
- You trust this woman?
- Yes, I do.

308
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,849
Hey, wait up, family!

309
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,976
I'm coming, too!

310
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,978
Don't worry, buddy. We got your back.

311
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,146
Eva let you come?

312
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,857
Sure. I promised her a spot
in the Carnival show.

313
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,901
- You did what?
- You guys are late.

314
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,862
- Clock-late.
- But musician-early.

315
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,739
Wait, you guys are coming?

316
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,990
We wouldn't miss it for the world.

317
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,785
We gonna scout the wildest,
coolest talent in the jungle!

318
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,538
It's our inspiration
for this year's Carnival show.

319
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,874
"Amazon Untamed."

320
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,125
Cool!

321
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,754
I mean, yeah. Okay. I guess I'll go.

322
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,548
Amazon jungle or bust, baby!

323
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,883
Who is ready for a
tropical adventure?

324
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,884
I know I am!

325
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,761
- All right!
- Let's go, birds!

326
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,139
Wait, we didn't do a head count.
Hey, guys, wait up!

327
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,225
Recalculating.

328
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,980
Hey, birds! Come back!

329
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,400
They left without me. Again!

330
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,986
That's messed up.

331
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,521
Heavy traffic ahead.

332
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,440
Great. Thanks a lot, GPS lady.

333
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,634
Faster, faster, faster!

334
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,304
Slower! Slower! Slower!

335
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,097
Help!

336
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:13,334
From Rio to Manaus
We are here in paradise

337
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,003
Here we are, kids.
The gateway to the Amazon.

338
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,717
"To be...

339
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,513
"or not to be...

340
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,015
"that is the question.

341
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,184
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

342
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,855
"to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

343
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,026
"or to take arms
against a sea of troubles...

344
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:43,072
"and, by opposing, end them."

345
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,492
That's beautiful, Nigel.

346
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,035
What does it mean?

347
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,704
Death, Gabi.

348
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,039
It's about death.

349
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,669
Nigel, I love it
when you get all dark and brooding.

350
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,381
Hey, bird. It's show time!

351
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,633
My audience awaits.

352
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,848
From the streets of Rio,
to the Amazon jungle...

353
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,850
the bird of mystery!

354
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,728
Miracle cures! Poison frogs!

355
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,563
- Fire ants!
- Don't be shy!

356
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,732
Learn your destiny!

357
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,575
Hey!
Get away from those! Back to work.

358
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,581
Mommy, Mommy, I want one!
I want a fortune!

359
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,541
Welcome, madame.

360
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,754
This amazing cockatoo
will reveal your future.

361
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,090
All right, bird. Pick a fortune.

362
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,675
Come on, bird.

363
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,594
You're doing great, Nigel.

364
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,388
Pick it already.

365
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:52,016
Come on, gang. Almost there.

366
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,935
No more flying today.
We've got a boat to catch.

367
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,231
According to my little friend here,
this boat will get us there by morning.

368
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,107
Yeah!

369
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:09,075
He'll live, but he'll
never fly again.

370
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,955
- Come on, bird.
- I want my fortune!

371
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,624
You're doing great, Nigel.

372
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,417
What's taking so long?

373
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,797
What's the matter with you?

374
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,052
That blue bird caused my misery.

375
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,102
Nice birdie?

376
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,383
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

377
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,444
Wow. Nigel is muy macho.

378
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,658
Thank you.

379
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,663
I'm free!

380
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,833
Poison frog!

381
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:15,182
The croaking cockatoo
doth bellow for revenge.

382
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,851
That's Shakespeare, by the way.

383
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,603
Without your performance,
it's nothing.

384
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,855
Fair point.

385
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,465
This air! It's so fresh and full.

386
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,844
Goodbye, stinky city air!

387
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,054
Yeah, bye.

388
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,894
Hey. Thank you for doing this.

389
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,687
I really appreciate it.

390
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,481
I would do anything for you.
You know that, right?

391
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,734
Of course I do.

392
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,836
We aren't here to snack.
We are here to avenge.

393
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,672
Once these pesky passengers
fall asleep...

394
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,426
we'll show our blue friends
some love. Some...

395
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,179
poisonous love.

396
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,431
That's my specialty.

397
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,934
We attack at the midnight hour...

398
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,269
because it's more evil.

399
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,271
Stay alert.

400
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,863
Midnight! Time to attack.

401
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,116
Nigel! Nigel?

402
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,538
Look at us. Misfits.

403
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,543
A toxic frog, and a flightless freak.

404
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:11,090
So different, and yet, the same.

405
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,259
My darling, while you sleep
All is well

406
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:17,596
We are friends, and that's swell
But the truth is that I have a secret to tell

407
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,558
I love you

408
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,771
People say it's wrong
It's absurd

409
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,774
That a frog and a bird are in love
But I know in my heart

410
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:33,320
This was so meant to be

411
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,074
If only we could hug and could kiss
It'd be heavenly bliss

412
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,483
But your lungs would explode
And you'd look just like this

413
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,288
And you'd gag
With your face turning blue

414
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,789
Eww

415
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,001
But, darling, I'll protect you
I will, don't worry, just chill

416
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,962
'Cause there isn't a bird
That I wouldn't kill

417
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:55,092
For you
Can't you see

418
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,179
We were destined to be?

419
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:03,851
- For we have love
- Love

420
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,313
- Poisonous love
- Love

421
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,150
And although, yes

422
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:16,655
I know that you can't hold me

423
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,782
Feel me close now.

424
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,871
Your loving wings enfold me

425
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,124
Fate told me

426
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,876
Love

427
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,378
- Poisonous love
- Love

428
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,882
Standing here

429
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,510
You're so near
And yet

430
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,096
So far

431
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,848
Like a star.

432
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,017
Here we are

433
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,894
Where?

434
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,605
What to do?

435
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,358
To do

436
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,568
Oh, pooh.

437
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,406
You're my Romeo I'm Juliet

438
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,742
We're so perfect, and yet

439
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,078
If we touch, not by much

440
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,246
Still on all you can bet

441
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,249
It's goodbye

442
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,087
And I'll cry

443
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:18,967
As you die

444
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,099
From our poisonous love

445
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,614
What a nightmare.

446
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,449
Charlie!

447
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,285
You were supposed to wake me!

448
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,621
It's time.

449
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,507
I love being on Team Nigel!

450
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:08,577
I can't think of anything more romantic than
poisoning passengers on a moonlight cruise.

451
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,578
Stop.

452
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,165
That one is mine.

453
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,542
Twinkle, twinkle little Blu.

454
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,212
How I wondered, where were you?

455
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,256
Up above the world so high...

456
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,383
are you ready...

457
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,677
to die?

458
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,513
You need a breath mint.

459
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,432
Even in sleep, you mock me.

460
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,534
Wait for me!

461
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,203
Don't leave me!

462
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,747
Tiago! Stop fooling around.

463
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,374
I didn't do anything.

464
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,292
Tiago Gunderson,
listen to your mother.

465
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,419
Man.

466
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,256
We're almost there, right?

467
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,966
- Hey, guys. Wait up.
- Come on, Blu.

468
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,634
Remember, birds of a...

469
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,928
Nevermind.

470
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,975
They're getting away!

471
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,436
Wake up, you insect-eating idiot.
Follow them.

472
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,275
Better. Now go ten times faster.

473
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,112
River hogs!

474
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,819
You!

475
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,323
I always suspected
you were dumber than a monkey.

476
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,033
And now, I know.

477
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,369
Boss! What are you
doing in the jungle?

478
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,330
Perhaps the better question is...

479
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,081
what are they doing?

480
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,584
Nature freaks.

481
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,589
Two million square miles of jungle...

482
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,009
and they're playing in my backyard?

483
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,054
I don't think so.

484
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:36,058
As you know, my friends,
this logging operation is a little...

485
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,018
illegal.

486
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,855
If those two nuts find those birds,
we're out of business.

487
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,023
And that's why you...

488
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,235
must put an end to their
little bird-watching expedition.

489
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,781
Find them and get rid of them.

490
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,950
The rest of you, go cut some trees.

491
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,081
Who cares about a bunch of birds?

492
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:03,126
The macaws should
be nesting near the Brazil nut trees.

493
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,379
So, I think
that we should continue with go...

494
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,257
Tulio! Are you listening to me?

495
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,635
You have reached your destination.

496
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,971
You see? It works like a charm.
Here we are.

497
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,724
Where?

498
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,726
These things have a margin of error.

499
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,229
I told you not to trust that woman.

500
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,900
That's a Heliconious larva.
It's about to enter the pupa stage.

501
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,735
You said "poop!"

502
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,821
Hey, kids. Stay close.

503
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,239
I'll get them.

504
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,742
Okay, you guys stay put.
I'll look around.

505
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,413
No worries. We'll be here.
We're not going anywhere.

506
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,581
My feathers is popping up
on the back of my neck.

507
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,083
I don't like this.

508
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,918
Let's back it up.

509
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,090
Bia? Tiago?

510
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,011
Come on, lady.

511
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,849
- Don't let me down.
- Calculating route to "Funky Town."

512
00:31:58,916 --> 00:31:59,850
Oh, great.

513
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,775
Okay, guys!

514
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,320
Guys?

515
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,117
Good one, guys. Very funny.

516
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,161
Good, good. Very witty.

517
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,997
Jewel, where are you?

518
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,041
Kids? Jewel?

519
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,795
It's a Macaw!

520
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,130
Linda!

521
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,465
Let me go!

522
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,469
Let me go, you heathens!

523
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,803
Blu?

524
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,810
I swear that sounded like Blu.

525
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,479
That's impossible, Linda.

526
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,315
He's back home in
Rio, safe and sound.

527
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,192
I am an American citizen, you savage!

528
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,860
I demand to see my ambassador!

529
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,820
I know my rights! I know my rights!

530
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,325
Back. Back, you barbarian!

531
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,826
Yeah, that's right.

532
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,204
It's a spoon and a fork.

533
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,831
Be afraid! Be very afraid.

534
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,752
Whoa! Whoa, buddy.
Put the spork down.

535
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,045
- Let me go!
- Bring it!

536
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,172
Come on! You lucky I ain't big.

537
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:43,620
I can't believe we found them!

538
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,331
Technically, they found us.

539
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,959
Okay, we're gonna need some nametags.

540
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,586
Hello. Okay.

541
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,089
No, those are breath mints.
Not that you need one.

542
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,299
But they're good. You eat them.

543
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,969
No, no, no! Not the whole box.

544
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,846
Get that out of your mouth!

545
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,143
What is this doing here?
What's going on?

546
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,229
We found them flying too close
to the humans.

547
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,147
- What? And who are you?
- Uh...

548
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,066
"Uh" is not an appropriate answer.

549
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,402
I asked you a question.
Where did you come from?

550
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,528
Hey! Back off!

551
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,697
Hey, excuse me, young lady.

552
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,159
I can't believe it.

553
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,704
How is this...?

554
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,664
When the loggers came...

555
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:32,127
there was fire, and so much smoke.

556
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,422
I had you under my wing,
and then you were...

557
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,381
Gone.

558
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,341
I've looked everywhere for you.

559
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,552
I'm here.

560
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,137
Daddy!

561
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,639
"Daddy"?

562
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,185
I missed you.

563
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,689
It's okay. It's okay, now.

564
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,233
Daddy has you.

565
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,446
Look at you.

566
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,116
It's my little girl, all grown up.

567
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,660
You're so beautiful.

568
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,997
Just like your mother.

569
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,168
I'm so sorry I lost you.

570
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,297
I can't imagine you alone,
all this time.

571
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,092
No, it's okay, Dad. I wasn't alone.

572
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,386
Blu found me.

573
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,059
Sure is nice to meet you, sir.

574
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,354
Tuck that wing away, Stu.

575
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,106
- Now, come here.
- Right, sure. Okay.

576
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,025
- Closer.
- Really?

577
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,318
Closer.

578
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,572
You brought my Jewel back to me.
I thank you.

579
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,909
- I'm gonna hug you now.
- Okay.

580
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,663
- Now, come here, you.
- Okay. There we are.

581
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,914
My pleasure.

582
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,749
Nico. You crying?

583
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,377
It's a heavy moment,
and I'm very vulnerable right now.

584
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,379
Come here. Let me get you a hug.

585
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,052
Mom, are you okay?

586
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,303
"Mom"?

587
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,431
I'm a grandpa? I'm a grandpa.

588
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,100
Look at me, I'm a grandpa!

589
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,353
Daddy, this is Carla, Bia and Tiago.

590
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,729
Nice to meet you, sir.

591
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,898
There is no "sir" around here,
young lady.

592
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,234
- You will call me "Pop-Pop!"
- Pop-Pop.

593
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,736
I like that. It's got
a nice ring to it.

594
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,115
I am a Pop-Pop!
Yeah, I'm the Pop-Pop-Pop.

595
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:28,368
Kids, go easy on old Pop-Pop.

596
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,036
You can call me "sir."

597
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,415
My daughter has returned!

598
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,672
For years, we have been on the run...

599
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,882
as the humans push us
deeper into the jungle.

600
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,219
But as you can see,
we have found sanctuary.

601
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,139
A place we can finally
put down roots.

602
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:53,393
Everyone! Come on!
Everyone, out of your nests!

603
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,564
My daughter is home!

604
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,026
Come on, birds. My Jewel is back!

605
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,530
Jewel?

606
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,700
Make way. Make way! Jewel!

607
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,201
Aunt Mimi? Aunt Mimi!

608
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,581
I missed you so much!

609
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,667
My little wildflower has returned!

610
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,963
I knew you were coming back.
I saw it in the droppings.

611
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,716
And look at the little ones!

612
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,679
Aren't you the fluffiest,
most delicious little macaws?

613
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,932
- You're big for your age.
- Mimi...

614
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,017
this is Sue.

615
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,187
- Actually, I'm Blu.
- Aren't we all?

616
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,938
No, really, that's my name.

617
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,857
That's why they call
us "Blue Macaws."

618
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,150
Just go with it.

619
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,451
So, that's what a Blue Macaw
is supposed to look like?

620
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,958
Look at her shining

621
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,544
Her feathers, they glow

622
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,464
Now the jungle is smiling

623
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,382
'Cause our baby's home

624
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,344
Can you feel what I feel?

625
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,513
The day has come at last

626
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,307
Our precious Jewel has returned

627
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,978
I'll be the first to sing
Welcome back

628
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,815
Roberto. I...

629
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,484
Welcome back

630
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:30,240
I said welcome, welcome, welcome

631
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,997
back

632
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,208
Wow, you look great!

633
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,168
So do you.

634
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:46,089
Hi, hey. Hi, there.
I am Jewel's significant other.

635
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,343
So, you're the lucky bird
who swept Ju-Ju off her feet.

636
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,178
- "Ju-Ju"?
- Yeah.

637
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,889
When we were kids, we always had
the cutest nicknames for each other.

638
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,350
We did. I called him "Beto."

639
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,394
That's adorable.
I love doing the nicknames.

640
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,396
You never mentioned any "Roberto."

641
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,772
There's nothing to mention.

642
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,023
Hey.

643
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,358
There's my wingman!

644
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,485
We can rest easy
with Roberto on the lookout.

645
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,530
Eduardo taught me everything I know.
He's the bird.

646
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,323
No. You're the bird.

647
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,159
- No, you're the bird.
- You're the bird!

648
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,161
We get it. You're both "the bird."

649
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,830
Now, can we stop yakking
and start partying?

650
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,042
Wow! I remember this song.

651
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,879
How could you forget?
It's in our blood, baby.

652
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,548
It's who we are.

653
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,383
You don't mind
if I borrow her for a minute, do you?

654
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,093
- Actually...
- Come on, Ju-Ju!

655
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,387
Let's go!

656
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,892
Let's come together
Singing love and harmonia

657
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,354
We are so different

658
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,941
But the same inside our hearts

659
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,028
Blue-tiful colors

660
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,614
As far as the eye can see

661
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,784
Open your wings

662
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:01,122
Fly when you hear the call

663
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:06,377
Let's celebrate
Calling all beautiful creatures

664
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:11,049
Come spread your wings
Dance and sing songs about freedom

665
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,759
Like la-la-la, ooh-ooh

666
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,761
- One for the jungle família
- Come on, Blu!

667
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,722
Like ba-ba-ba, boom-boom

668
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,227
- Calling all beautiful creatures
- Hey, Jewel? Jewel!

669
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:26,272
Come this way, celebrate

670
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,609
Laugh and dance all the way

671
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:36,115
Yo, this is untapped territory.
I'm loving this sound.

672
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,090
Pop-Pop! I am a Pop-Pop!

673
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,261
I am your Pop-Pop!
Yeah, I am the Pop-Pop

674
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,471
Hey, the Pop-Pop!

675
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:04,644
Let's celebrate
Calling all beautiful creatures

676
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:09,315
Come spread your wings
Dance and sing songs about freedom

677
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,109
Like la-la-la, ooh-ooh

678
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,112
One for the jungle família

679
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,738
Like ba-ba-ba, boom-boom

680
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,659
Calling all beautiful creatures

681
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,800
You're the only one who knows
what it feels like to be all alone.

682
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,677
Misunderstood.

683
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,263
You're the evil to my lethal.

684
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,682
I can see why they call you "Gabi."

685
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,852
Where are you, you filthy fowl?

686
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,938
Halt!

687
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,988
I've been going about this all wrong.

688
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,699
I need to search from higher ground.

689
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,622
You stayed airborne
for almost a full second that time.

690
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,545
What are you looking at?
Get me up there.

691
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,048
Higher.

692
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,717
Higher! Even higher.

693
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,136
Little bit higher.

694
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,056
Lower. Lower, now.

695
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,976
Yes. Perfect.

696
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,190
It's an infestation.

697
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:38,029
Keep celebrating. I'll be
pooping on your party promptly.

698
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,494
Hi, Nico! Hi, Pedro!

699
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,413
We came to the right place.

700
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,749
This is popping.
It's popping in the Amazon.

701
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,626
We could bring these macaws
back to Rio...

702
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,629
and have the best Carnival show ever.

703
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,590
I am inspired!

704
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,928
Sorry to break it to
you, city boys...

705
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,763
but you'll have to find
some other talent.

706
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,765
Nobody leaves the tribe.

707
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,269
And no human things in the jungle.
Understood?

708
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,398
What? What's his problem?

709
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,108
I feel naked.

710
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,569
We could have been legends.

711
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,155
We already are
super-mega-dope, but...

712
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,407
You know what I'm saying?

713
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,992
We had it all.
The undiscovered talent...

714
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,061
the big idea, the inspiration.

715
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,789
But if we can't bring
these guys to Rio...

716
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,915
we got nothing.

717
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:31,999
Nothing?

718
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,003
Hold your mangoes. We still have Eva.

719
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,840
What?

720
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,139
Wow! You still got the moves, Ju-Ju.

721
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,807
- I'm so exhausted.
- Yeah.

722
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,269
We should get some rest.
Find a local inn, or B and B nearby.

723
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,645
What is this crazy talk?

724
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,814
No, you guys are staying in my nest.

725
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,315
I'm on patrol tonight.

726
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,276
Mi casa es su casa.

727
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,819
That's really nice, Beto.

728
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,320
Thank you, but we're fine.

729
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,991
Besides, our whole family couldn't
possibly fit in your bachelor pad.

730
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,659
Whoa.

731
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,579
Real estate must be pretty cheap
around here.

732
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:12,039
Wow. This is incredible.

733
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,377
This old nest? It's just something
I put together last minute.

734
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,838
With my own two wings, of course.

735
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,548
And my strength.

736
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,175
And my brawn.

737
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,596
Dad, it's huge! It has six bedrooms!

738
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,515
- I get the big one!
- No! I'm the oldest.

739
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,185
Only by 3 minutes, 2.5 seconds.

740
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,460
I had hoped to one day be blessed...

741
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,731
with a flock of little Robertos
to call my own.

742
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,774
- I bet you did.
- No way!

743
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,610
A bird bath!

744
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,236
Tiago, caref...

745
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,533
Jacuzzi.

746
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:51,954
Blu, let me tell you something.

747
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:56,709
If anything, and I mean anything,
ever happens to you...

748
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,794
I will take care of your family.

749
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,214
All right, buddy. Sleep well.

750
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,050
- Good night, Ju-Ju.
- Good night.

751
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,857
Okay. All clear.

752
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,776
Moon beams and starlight

753
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,489
Magical twilight

754
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:30,326
The warmest rain

755
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:34,914
Hear it whispering your names?

756
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,376
Rainbows at midnight

757
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,420
Sparkling night skies

758
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:45,508
Don't go away

759
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,595
Stay another day

760
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,349
Can you sing it again, please?

761
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,602
Time for bed, now.

762
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,069
What an amazing day.

763
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,655
All this time...

764
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:12,535
I never let myself hope
that they were alive.

765
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,204
But they are.

766
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,333
We found our family, Blu.

767
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,754
This changes everything.

768
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,298
Yeah.

769
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,801
Wait. What? What's changing?

770
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,430
Jewel?

771
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,384
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Go on.

772
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,580
Honey, stop. That tickles.

773
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,254
That was fun!

774
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,633
Tiago!

775
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,177
Come on, Tiago. Let's go.

776
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,480
Morning.

777
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,024
Or should I say "afternoon"?

778
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,403
Morning, sir.

779
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,988
Our days here in the jungle,
they start early.

780
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,448
Morning, Daddy.

781
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,243
That's my girl. See?
Already up and at 'em.

782
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,452
Morning, sweetie.

783
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,830
Why did you let me sleep in?

784
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,374
What are you talking about?
You sleep in every day.

785
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,959
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, Dad.

786
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,128
Aunt Mimi says
clay is good for your digestion.

787
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,071
- Try some.
- No, sweetie. I just brushed my...

788
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,549
It's good, right?
I'm gonna go get some more.

789
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,300
Smart girl.

790
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,640
So, I thought I'd take Louie, here,
for a little tour of the area.

791
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,975
Show him around.

792
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,560
- That's a great idea.
- What?

793
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:46,105
You go have fun with Daddy, and I'll
explore around here with the kids.

794
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,733
- Yeah, okay. Sure.
- You'll love it.

795
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,193
Yeah, great. I just gotta...

796
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,159
Okay, ready.

797
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,913
Okay.

798
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,374
Lou, come closer.

799
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,756
- Not so close.
- Okay.

800
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,424
Listen...

801
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,761
I can barely look at it.
You gotta lose that human pocket, okay?

802
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,471
This is a fanny pack.

803
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,098
"Fanny pack." Adorable.

804
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,475
It's human.

805
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:26,145
And now that you're joining the tribe,
you won't be needing it anymore.

806
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,647
I'll meet you by the clay banks.

807
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,274
"Joining the tribe"?

808
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,882
He doesn't actually think
we're moving to the jungle, does he?

809
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,280
No. He's just excited
we're all here.

810
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,115
Let's not ruin the moment, okay?

811
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:42,203
Besides, it won't kill you
to leave behind the fanny pack.

812
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,123
All right, you win.
I will leave the fanny pack behind.

813
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,335
Happy wife, happy li...

814
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,336
Bye, honey.

815
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,921
Have fun.

816
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,508
Yeah. Sure. Bye.

817
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,271
You guys. Wakey-wakey!

818
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,066
- Wake up!
- Eva! You got it!

819
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,777
What happened to "Amazon Untamed"?

820
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,862
Here's the plan. Auditions today...

821
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,114
and we preview the show tomorrow.

822
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,700
"We"? What you talking about, "we"?
You speak French?

823
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:25,079
Come on, chop-chop.
Let's get started!

824
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,332
Kid's been working.

825
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,503
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go

826
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,338
Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go!

827
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,052
'Cause shawty got low,
low, low, low, low

828
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,806
Any time you're ready.

829
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,766
Every time I come a
fella gotta get it

830
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,560
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then they gotta blow

831
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,728
And then I gotta show that any little
thing A fella think that he be doing

832
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,438
'Cause it doesn't matter, I'm done

833
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:58,904
Next!

834
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,408
We are the amazing Capoeira Turtles.

835
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,323
- Bravo! Encore! Encore!
- Encore!

836
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,046
Sorry, guys. Did I miss anything?

837
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,798
Mosquito.

838
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,651
Hi, my name is Claira
the capybara...

839
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:40,487
and I will be singing
my favorite song.

840
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,491
Memory

841
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,454
All alone in the moonlight

842
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,837
Touch me

843
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,799
It's so easy to leave me

844
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,010
If they keep eating each other,
we got no show.

845
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,220
This ain't an
all-you-can-eat competition!

846
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:16,190
Hey. You are fast.
You are really, really fast.

847
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,278
I think I pulled a wing or something.
You are really fast for an old bird.

848
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:23,280
For such a wise bird,
is what I meant to say. Wise bird.

849
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,032
Which sometimes comes with age...

850
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,909
but also can happen when you're
young, like in your case.

851
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,328
You could be wise and young, which
is kind of a rare combination...

852
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,688
but thrilling when it happens.

853
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,206
- Be quiet.
- Thank you, sir.

854
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,975
It's time to shake
that city off of you.

855
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,669
You need to learn
the basics of jungle survival.

856
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,337
I thought we were going sightseeing.

857
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,256
It's training day.

858
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,551
Come on! The mud is your friend.

859
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,596
This is your camouflage!
Feel it. Taste it!

860
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,516
If you don't feel crusty,
you're not doing it right!

861
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,061
You don't wanna be seen by humans!

862
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,939
Come on!
Are you a macaw or a turkey?

863
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,406
Faster. Faster.

864
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,534
Come on!
You don't wanna be eaten!

865
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,081
You're alone in the jungle.
You get caught in a trap.

866
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,874
What do you do?

867
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,251
If I had my fanny pack...

868
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,919
No! You use your beak.

869
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,767
- My beak.
- It's your most important tool.

870
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,923
Okay, okay. No, I use my beak.

871
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,592
- Almost.
- Time's up!

872
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,386
You're jaguar meat.

873
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,304
Roberto got it on the first try.

874
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,223
Of course he did.

875
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,727
Up, up! And hover!

876
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,562
- Now, backwards!
- What, backwards?

877
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,605
No, only hummingbirds
can fly backwards.

878
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,315
Backwards.

879
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,443
Over! Under! Over!

880
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,737
Under! Over!

881
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,572
- Good job.
- Thanks.

882
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,948
Not you.

883
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,075
Hi.

884
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,245
Brazil nut trees.

885
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:58,125
These trees are the key
to our way of life.

886
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,170
The trees feed us.

887
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,589
They sustain us.

888
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,012
- Wake up!
- I'm up.

889
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,097
Nutty Brazil...
Brazil nut trees, something.

890
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,432
Yeah, got it.

891
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,727
This is important.
We have to protect these trees.

892
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,771
Our future depends on it.

893
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:19,938
Yo, Eddie.

894
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,440
Who is your sidekick?

895
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,317
You got a nurse now?

896
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:24,943
Hi, I'm...

897
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,780
Aren't you boys getting
a little bit too close to our side?

898
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,156
We have a deal, Felipe.

899
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,824
Hey, relax.

900
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:33,160
You know we got nothing
but mad love for you.

901
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,079
Come on, boys, let's fly.

902
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:39,166
Paint the sky. Before
they start to cry.

903
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,827
- They seem nice.
- They have their side of the grove...

904
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,087
and we have ours.

905
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,339
Food is scarce these days.

906
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,268
Never seen them
this close to the village before.

907
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,186
What?

908
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,022
- Don't let them see you!
- Right, right. Sorry.

909
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,483
Maybe we should go find Linda.

910
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,778
- What's a Linda?
- Linda is the person that raised me.

911
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,655
What? You're a pet?

912
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:13,325
No, it wasn't anything like that.
I was a companion.

913
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,286
You liked it?
That explains everything.

914
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,622
- Linda is family.
- Family?

915
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,833
Humans aren't family.

916
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,668
No, you don't understand.
They're coming here to help.

917
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,627
Listen to me.

918
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,505
We do not bring humans
into the tribe.

919
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,715
That is the only reason
we're still alive.

920
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:32,010
You cannot be confused about this.
Understood?

921
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,887
Yeah. Got it.

922
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,057
Sightseeing is over.

923
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,523
Do you see the nest?

924
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,820
Tulio, are you okay?

925
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,531
I'm fine! I'm okay!

926
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,786
Not okay.

927
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,543
Tulio, they're cutting
down the forest!

928
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,378
Linda, where are you going?

929
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,631
To talk to them.
You talk to birds, I talk to humans.

930
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,383
No! Wait, don't!

931
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,053
Hey! Hey, mister!

932
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,972
Hello!

933
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,308
You take it easy with that chainsaw.

934
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:24,897
There are rare birds living around here.
You can't cut down these trees!

935
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,858
Sweetheart! There you are.

936
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,484
I was looking for you.

937
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,571
Hi, there. Beautiful
out here, isn't it?

938
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,698
You two lost?

939
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,035
Lost? No!

940
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:39,870
Lost?

941
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,580
No.

942
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,416
We're here on our honeymoon.

943
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,085
We're actually just heading back
to join the tour.

944
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,588
It's karaoke night.

945
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:53,425
Come along, honey.
Moon River isn't going to sing itself.

946
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,179
Linda, logs aren't the only things
these guys cut.

947
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,599
Run, Linda. I'll hold them off.

948
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,769
- Go, go, go! Run!
- Okay, okay, okay!

949
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,692
Excuse me, excuse me!

950
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,074
Come on, I'll race you.

951
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,827
- This is great!
- All right, Tiago!

952
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,787
Oh, yeah!

953
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,789
Tiago!

954
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:25,874
Hey!

955
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,339
That is so good.

956
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,966
Hey, you're back.

957
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,802
How did it go?

958
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,640
We had a great time.
It was educational.

959
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,768
Dad! Uncle Beto showed me
some cool flying tricks.

960
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,852
"Uncle"?

961
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,230
Look, I can fly backwards.

962
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,315
Yeah, you're a natural, T-Bird.

963
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:56,154
It's never too soon to learn
the ways of the jungle, Tiago.

964
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,241
Although, some may never learn.

965
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,370
I'm gonna go clean up.

966
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,292
Roberto, we saw humans
near the grove.

967
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,711
I need you to stay alert.

968
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,171
"Ways of the jungle."

969
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,841
I would like to learn a way
out of this jungle.

970
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,891
There he is. Now is our chance.

971
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,268
I'm so excited!

972
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,103
Prepare the tongue-a-pult.

973
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,485
Charlie, make me fly again.

974
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,030
Go get them, tiger!

975
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,287
Bow before the conquering cockatoo.

976
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,539
What is your problem, dude?

977
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,000
Bird, that was sick!

978
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,336
Now, that's the energy
you bring into an audition.

979
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,587
Audition?

980
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,922
Yeah, that's actually why I'm here.

981
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,549
I've got a great little...

982
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,426
Go on.

983
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,762
We're looking for a new star.

984
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,347
Star?

985
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,641
You look familiar.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

986
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,187
No, I don't think so. No. I'm...

987
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:15,025
Bob. Yes. Bob, the bird.

988
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,487
Okay, Bob, whatever.
Show us what you got.

989
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:25,118
Well, at first I was afraid

990
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,037
I was petrified

991
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,624
I kept thinking that
I could never live

992
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,710
I could barely fly

993
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,630
And I spent, oh, so many nights

994
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,341
thinking how he did me wrong

995
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,593
And I grew strong

996
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,764
And I learned how to get along

997
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,934
Go on, now, go
Walk out the door

998
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,728
Just turn around now

999
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,147
It is I who have the floor

1000
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,943
Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

1001
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,195
- Did you think I'd crumble?
- Oh, no!

1002
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,239
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

1003
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,281
Oh, no, not Nige

1004
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:06,743
I will survive

1005
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,954
As long as I know how to hate

1006
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,081
I know I'll stay alive

1007
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,209
I've got all my life to live

1008
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,002
And I've got all my love to give

1009
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,088
- And I will survive
- You will survive

1010
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,382
- I will survive
- We will survive

1011
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,843
I'm a survivor
I've got the eye of a tiger

1012
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,494
Been training again
And eating my fiber

1013
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,972
You been staying alive
Well, I've been staying alive-er

1014
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,516
Watch where you sit
when I spit my saliva, like boom

1015
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,059
You've never seen a cockatoo

1016
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,145
Rocking and shocking and dropping
And popping and locking, too?

1017
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,939
Watch what I can do
Without no Auto-Tune

1018
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:36,940
Say what?

1019
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:40,944
Oh, no, he didn't.

1020
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,904
If you try to keep me down

1021
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,365
I'll just come back stronger

1022
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,075
You try to cut me short

1023
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,453
I'll just come back longer

1024
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,623
If you beat me at ping pong
I'll just play ping pong-er

1025
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,542
Give me my throne, I
am ready to thrive

1026
01:00:55,651 --> 01:00:56,585
One thing I know

1027
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,087
I will survive

1028
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:05,260
I will survive

1029
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,432
Yes, thank you.
I've been Bob the bird.

1030
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,102
He is so hot.

1031
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,896
Boom. That's it. You in.

1032
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,231
You're no Eva, but you're awesome.

1033
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,525
We'll see you at the performance
tomorrow night.

1034
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,237
Everyone from the village is coming.
It's gonna be off the charts.

1035
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,114
Everyone?

1036
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,407
Everyone?

1037
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,117
It's the perfect plan.

1038
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,871
Be happy we're only
plucking you, porcupine.

1039
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,040
Go away.

1040
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,210
Instead of chasing that bird
all over the jungle...

1041
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:42,380
we let him come to us,
at the Carnival show.

1042
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:46,259
I'll mesmerize them from the stage,
while in the audience...

1043
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,220
you, my little Gabi...

1044
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:53,225
you'll be my petite
weapon of mass destruction.

1045
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,477
It will be a performance...

1046
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,313
to die for.

1047
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,655
It only works when I do it.

1048
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:08,949
Okay. Love you.

1049
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,252
So minty.

1050
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:26,633
Yes!

1051
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:36,601
Hey, sweetie, there you are.
What's taking you so long?

1052
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,520
Enough with that GPS, really.

1053
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,839
The whole tribe's gathering
to watch the sunset. Come on.

1054
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,858
No, no. Hang on. I just found
Linda and Tulio's coordinates.

1055
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,443
They are just
on the other side of the grove.

1056
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,945
Look, they're really close.

1057
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,446
Yeah.

1058
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,365
Now, I know your dad
doesn't totally trust humans...

1059
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,701
but I'm sure if he met them,
he would change his mind.

1060
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:54,327
They can help keep this place safe.

1061
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,537
Yeah, Blu...

1062
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,455
my dad knows what he's doing.

1063
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,877
And can't you just forget Linda and Tulio
for one minute and enjoy a sunset?

1064
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,796
But I thought that was our plan.

1065
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,673
Route guidance complete.

1066
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:12,804
You know, maybe some places
shouldn't be found.

1067
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,141
Maybe they should just be left alone.

1068
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,646
She ate a bug. A bug!

1069
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,898
Blu, Blu, Blu! Calm down.

1070
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,650
Calm down? We had a plan.

1071
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,986
Help Linda and Tulio find the flock
and get home.

1072
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,514
But when I mentioned it to her,
she completely shut me down.

1073
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:33,992
And her father? A total nut job.

1074
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,827
He's got this weird
thing about humans.

1075
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,996
He's got this weird
thing about humans!

1076
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,206
He loves them. He's a pet!

1077
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,833
A pet?

1078
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,209
He called me a pet.

1079
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,670
I can't believe he used
the "P" word to my face.

1080
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,422
It's like he thinks
I'm the enemy or something.

1081
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,842
He's not one of us, Roberto.
Keep an eye on him.

1082
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,261
And that Roberto? He
is always watching.

1083
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,973
He is always hovering around Jewel.
He is always singing something.

1084
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,350
I can't compete with that.

1085
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,477
You gotta bird up, bird!

1086
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,811
You gotta emancipate yourself
from domestication.

1087
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,897
Try to see this place
through her eyes.

1088
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,900
Taste the flavors she's tasting.

1089
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,360
So I should eat a bug?

1090
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,569
That's just nasty,
thinking about it.

1091
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,655
Glitter. Where is my glitter?

1092
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:12,739
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1093
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,700
I don't want apologies.
I want glitter.

1094
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:19,412
Glitter is absolutely essential
for a magical performance.

1095
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,373
- Do you know nothing?
- Guys!

1096
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,750
Rehearsals, big day tomorrow.

1097
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,087
Ring a bell? Come on.
You're coming, right, Dad?

1098
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,546
Oh, yeah, of course.

1099
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:31,591
That girl put the "business"
in "show business."

1100
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:32,717
Blu, remember...

1101
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:36,262
I know, I know. Happy
wife, happy life.

1102
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,561
What a glorious morning!

1103
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,402
I forgot I could have
mornings like this.

1104
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,909
Yeah.

1105
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,081
Your favorite.

1106
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,250
You remembered.

1107
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,877
Isn't that nice?

1108
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:14,259
It's so crazy good.

1109
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,636
Thank you so much, Blu.

1110
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,476
That's it!

1111
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,608
I'll be the one to surprise her.

1112
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,820
Breakfast in bed, coming up.

1113
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,150
Brazil nuts.

1114
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,319
Where are you?

1115
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,616
I know you're around here somewhere.

1116
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,829
Hey! Hey.

1117
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,498
No! Come back here. Wait!

1118
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:27,957
No!

1119
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,042
That's not a toy.

1120
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:31,169
Erratic driving. Pull over.

1121
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,305
No, no. Don't do it.

1122
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:03,868
I got you!

1123
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,329
Thank you.

1124
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:09,833
Finally!

1125
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,709
Brazil nuts.

1126
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,883
This is my most important tool.

1127
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,487
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

1128
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:46,202
I guess old Eddie's rules
don't apply to everyone.

1129
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,874
You're on our side.

1130
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,500
Really? Okay, my bad.

1131
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,043
I didn't know that. Sorry.

1132
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,921
Sorry! Sorry.

1133
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,092
You come over here, take our food...

1134
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,261
and now you insult me?

1135
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,599
No, no, no. This is all just
a big misunderstanding.

1136
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:11,227
You know,
I wish I could accept your apology.

1137
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:14,105
You seem like a nice bird.

1138
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,690
But this means war!

1139
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,444
What? Does it have to?
Can it mean something else?

1140
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,196
Today, in the Pit of Doom.

1141
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,616
Sorry, the "Pit of Doom"? Really?

1142
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,367
Really?

1143
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,954
High noon. I'll make some room.

1144
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,707
Sweep you up like a broom.

1145
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,299
You did what?

1146
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,467
It was an accident.

1147
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,469
- An accident?
- Hey, what's going on?

1148
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,430
Thanks to Drew, here, we could lose
our entire side of the grove.

1149
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,891
I was just trying to get a nut.
One nut!

1150
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,977
You don't even like nuts!
What's gotten into you, Blu?

1151
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,812
I was getting it for you.

1152
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,773
You were?

1153
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,317
Roberto, I want your
best birds on this.

1154
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,152
We are not giving up without a fight.

1155
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,236
Got it.

1156
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,489
You. Stay out of it.

1157
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,823
You've done enough.

1158
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,492
- Wait!
- Blu, he's right.

1159
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,494
Maybe you should just let
Dad and Roberto handle it.

1160
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,162
You don't think I can do this?

1161
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,665
No, I just don't know...

1162
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:18,127
if it's your exact area of expertise.

1163
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,839
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Pit of Doom, now!

1164
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,193
Radio!

1165
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:47,991
I hope you don't mind.

1166
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,535
I made myself at home.

1167
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,620
Lollipop?

1168
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:05,508
It's a shame, really. You came all
this way to protect the jungle.

1169
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:08,636
Let's see if it will
return the favor.

1170
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,555
Tree huggers.

1171
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,067
Roberto.

1172
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:24,986
Felipe.

1173
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,490
No mercy!

1174
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,700
I have to stop this.

1175
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:31,826
What? Blu!

1176
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,536
Stop! Stop!

1177
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:34,996
Eduardo, this is crazy.

1178
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,044
We are an intelligent species with
advanced problem-solving capabilities.

1179
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,752
You brought this on us. Now, watch.

1180
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,266
Heads.

1181
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,392
Tails.

1182
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,395
I hate this job.

1183
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,445
It's a game. It's a game!

1184
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:10,448
It's not a game! It's war.

1185
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,786
It's a beautiful day
in the Pit of Doom!

1186
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,913
It's winner take all!

1187
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,456
It's the best of seven.

1188
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:22,752
The winner will take control
of the entire Brazil nut grove!

1189
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,670
It's just like soccer. I can do this.

1190
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,197
All right, any special strategies?

1191
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,091
What are we running at,
4-4-2 or a 5-4-1?

1192
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,134
What are we doing here, coach?
What position do I play?

1193
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:32,678
Actually, I do have
a perfect spot for you.

1194
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:36,307
Water. Water here. Get your water.

1195
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,350
Okay, thanks.

1196
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:42,021
Roberto is unstoppable!
He's incredible! He's everywhere!

1197
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,523
Go, Roberto!

1198
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,816
I could have done that.

1199
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,192
Roberto springs free!

1200
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,521
There he goes, there he goes,
there he goes! He shoots!

1201
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,030
Goal!

1202
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,031
Goal!

1203
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,200
Goal! Goal!

1204
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,993
Goal!

1205
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,664
Oh, my!

1206
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:03,042
Felipe has the ball.
The Red Macaws...

1207
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,335
are making a comeback.

1208
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,212
Felipe pass to Tito. Tito with Mario.

1209
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,506
Mario with Cesar. Cesar to Antonio.

1210
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,341
Felipe scores!

1211
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,136
Yes! In your face!

1212
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:16,347
Felipe, Roberto. Roberto, Felipe.
Roberto, Felipe. Felipe, Roberto!

1213
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,145
Goal!

1214
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,189
That has got to hurt.

1215
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,691
Go, go!

1216
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:31,529
Felipe-lipe-lipe!

1217
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:33,865
Hey!

1218
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:34,866
Foul!

1219
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,159
Come on, ref!

1220
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,703
Okay, you're in.

1221
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,495
Really?

1222
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:41,038
Not you. You.

1223
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,207
Watch and learn...

1224
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,542
water boy.

1225
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:47,670
All right, just get in there.

1226
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,588
Yes!

1227
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,215
Okay. Here we go, coach.

1228
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:52,216
Yeah, Dad!

1229
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:55,928
A new player is coming off the bench.
Is he a secret weapon?

1230
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:58,848
I think it's the water boy.

1231
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,016
Hey, I'm open!

1232
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,559
I'm open, toss it to me!

1233
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,353
Hey, pass to me, I'm open.
I'm wide open!

1234
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,564
Pass the ball to me!

1235
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:10,359
Thanks for the pass, Blu!

1236
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:11,407
Mind if I borrow this?

1237
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,571
Roberto moves in. He shakes one...

1238
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:14,614
then another!

1239
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:15,740
Roberto!

1240
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,241
Goal!

1241
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:20,244
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

1242
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,087
We are tied in the Pit of Doom.

1243
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:31,923
Whoever scores next...

1244
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,299
wins it all!

1245
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,092
I got it, I got it!

1246
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,387
Come on, Blu.

1247
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,979
Wow! The water boy is suddenly
playing like a pro!

1248
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,613
Pass the ball to Roberto!

1249
01:13:57,975 --> 01:13:59,784
Pass the ball! Pass the ball!

1250
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,453
- Blu, wait!
- No, this bird's got it covered.

1251
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,513
Goal!

1252
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,648
It looks like the secret weapon
just backfired!

1253
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,317
Let's go to Eduardo for his reaction.

1254
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,114
I'm gonna kill you, fanny pack!

1255
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,292
Check it out, old Eddie.

1256
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,170
Looks like you guys are going to
have to start a nut-free diet.

1257
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:57,508
We're gonna be talking about that
for a long time.

1258
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:05,224
I should never have expected more
from a human's pet.

1259
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,408
Hey.

1260
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,704
What happened back there?

1261
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,081
I was trying to be one of the tribe.

1262
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:32,418
But I guess I'm never gonna be
"the bird" like your dad wants me to be.

1263
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:35,755
- What?
- I think it's time to go home.

1264
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:37,673
We should talk about this.

1265
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,383
Talk about what?

1266
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,885
Blu, look around.

1267
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:45,556
The kids are thriving.
They love being in the wild.

1268
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:48,225
Maybe this place is home.

1269
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:50,686
Home? How could this be home?

1270
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:52,964
I have done everything I can
to fit in and help out...

1271
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,607
but no matter what I do, it's wrong.

1272
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,233
That's not home, Jewel.

1273
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:59,236
Maybe for you, but not for me.

1274
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:02,239
You know what?
You need to figure out what you want.

1275
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:07,411
And maybe, stop thinking about just
yourself and start thinking about us.

1276
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:46,784
Hey, you heard the boss.

1277
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,411
Move out! Let's go!

1278
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,835
Beautiful.

1279
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,978
Linda! Tulio!

1280
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,321
Goodbye, Linda.

1281
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,495
Goodbye, fanny pack.

1282
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:33,831
Turn around when possible.

1283
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:37,835
Sorry, GPS lady.
It's not you. It's me.

1284
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:42,006
Goodbye, pancakes. Goodbye, coffee.

1285
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,426
Goodbye, coffee.

1286
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,681
Linda?

1287
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:52,850
Linda!

1288
01:17:57,964 --> 01:17:59,106
Eduardo was right!

1289
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,835
- Traitor!
- Wait, you don't understand.

1290
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,194
What don't I understand?
Siding with humans?

1291
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,761
What do you even know about humans?

1292
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,866
I know everything.
They lure you in, they trap you.

1293
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,701
They destroy your mind!

1294
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,786
Polly want a cracker?
Polly want a cracker?

1295
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,788
No! Enough crackers!

1296
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,457
I hate crackers!

1297
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:21,253
Come on, Roberto!

1298
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,696
It's them. It's them!

1299
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:23,881
It's them!

1300
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:25,763
Roberto, get out of...

1301
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,889
Not again! Not again!
No more crackers!

1302
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:33,641
Snap out of it!

1303
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:35,559
Look...

1304
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,328
we've got one chance
to stop this, okay?

1305
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:38,379
I have to find my friends.

1306
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,314
You fly back and warn the others.
You got it?

1307
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,565
Yeah. I got it.

1308
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:43,067
- Okay. Go!
- Okay!

1309
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,572
Humans, humans!

1310
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,911
- Your left! Your right!
- My left?

1311
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,412
Left or right?

1312
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,167
- Your right leg, my left leg.
- Okay.

1313
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:02,419
Good! Good! Good!

1314
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,421
- Now, go up.
- Go up.

1315
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:06,757
Reach!

1316
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,467
Almost there!

1317
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,096
Linda...

1318
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:14,098
I'm so sorry.

1319
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,058
As bad as this is...

1320
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:20,771
there is no place I would rather be
in the whole world than with you.

1321
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:23,440
Even if it is tied to a tree.

1322
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:30,948
Linda!

1323
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,158
Blu!

1324
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:34,577
Blu!

1325
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:36,245
- Linda?
- Down here!

1326
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:39,456
What? Blu!

1327
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:42,293
What are you doing here?
This is dangerous!

1328
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,962
That's incredible!
It's a 2,000-mile flight!

1329
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,491
- Let's follow him!
- It's amazing!

1330
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,758
I told you I heard him.

1331
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,860
I'll take those.

1332
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,769
Game over!
It's over!

1333
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:44,021
Humans! The lights!

1334
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,440
It's over!

1335
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,609
He's been blabbering like this
since we found him.

1336
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,819
The loggers are coming!
And Blu is with them!

1337
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:51,945
- Traitor!
- No!

1338
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,530
No, Blu is trying to help us.

1339
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:54,948
What? By himself?

1340
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,700
Let's evacuate! We're leaving.

1341
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,035
Let's go. Everyone move out.

1342
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,370
- Go, go, go!
- Dad?

1343
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:01,330
No, not this time.
I'm not going with you.

1344
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:04,291
You have to go with me!
I will not put my family in danger again.

1345
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,127
Blu is my family,
and I'm not leaving him behind.

1346
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,046
You don't have to.

1347
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,883
Are you okay?

1348
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:18,305
Look, Eduardo, I might not be
the birdliest bird in the flock...

1349
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,391
but, for once,
that's actually a good thing.

1350
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:21,892
You know the jungle...

1351
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,560
I know humans.

1352
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,813
And I know that, together,
we can stop them.

1353
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:28,565
We can't let them take our home.

1354
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,819
Sure, it's hot and loud
and filled with creepy bugs...

1355
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,529
but it's ours.

1356
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:35,906
Let's fight for it. Who's with me?

1357
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,366
I'm with you!

1358
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,744
Anybody else?

1359
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:50,921
Stop! Stop!

1360
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:53,924
Stop!

1361
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:00,264
Stop!

1362
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:09,189
Yeah. Respect the rainforest!

1363
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,000
I knew it! I knew it!

1364
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:34,256
Hey. Where do you think you're going?

1365
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:37,301
It's just a bunch of pigeons.

1366
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,927
Get back to work!

1367
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,349
Lead the way, Blu.

1368
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,393
That's my name! Yes!
You called me Blu.

1369
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,228
Yes, I am Blu!

1370
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,314
What? Right.

1371
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,940
Birds of blue feathers...

1372
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:54,193
Have to stick together!

1373
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:08,999
Everybody ready? And under!

1374
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:12,127
Over!

1375
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:16,423
Backwards!

1376
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:25,766
I will survive
I will survive

1377
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:31,563
- Got him!
- Wow, precise.

1378
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,900
I ain't afraid of no birds.

1379
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,155
Attack!

1380
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:41,907
It's on in the Amazon.

1381
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,826
All right, hit it!

1382
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:47,704
High-five!

1383
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,170
Why? Why?

1384
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:56,713
Get a grip!

1385
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,636
Incoming!

1386
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,016
Halt!

1387
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,477
There he is.

1388
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,564
Charlie, prepare the nose-zooka.

1389
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:15,440
Tiago!

1390
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:17,025
Now we're talking.

1391
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:18,068
Ready...

1392
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,319
aim...

1393
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:20,404
fire!

1394
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,201
Foiled again.

1395
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:30,247
- Good job, Tiago.
- We're a great team, Dad!

1396
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,874
- Hey, old Eddie.
- Felipe.

1397
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:35,002
You think I would miss this party?
Game on!

1398
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,924
Hey! Come back!

1399
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:43,093
You're useless, all of you!

1400
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,720
Look out!

1401
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:51,435
Pick on someone your own size.

1402
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,235
No! No!

1403
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:04,907
I got you, I got you.
It's okay, you're safe now.

1404
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,624
That's a Linda.

1405
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,131
Yeah!

1406
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,678
We still got it, Blu!

1407
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,650
I have to do everything myself.

1408
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,239
Hey! Get away from that!

1409
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:49,326
No! No one steals my scene.

1410
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,000
Lollipop?

1411
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,007
What?

1412
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:07,719
What are you doing? Let go!

1413
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:08,845
Save yourself!

1414
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:12,015
Come on, let go!

1415
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,184
- Never!
- Are you crazy?

1416
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,144
You'll bring both of us down! Let go!

1417
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,522
Fly!

1418
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:20,899
Déjà vu, Blu.

1419
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:21,817
Nigel!

1420
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:24,569
Blu!

1421
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,572
Nigel!

1422
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:50,721
You.

1423
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:55,934
You will pay a painful price
for your pestilence!

1424
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:57,894
Hey, stop that! Get off of me!

1425
01:26:57,962 --> 01:27:00,564
A flurry of furious feathers
in your face!

1426
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,274
You don't have to do this!

1427
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:04,526
No, I just want to.

1428
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:05,736
Hey, stop! Stop!

1429
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:08,739
Oh, my goodness. Charlie!
This is it. This is it!

1430
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,699
Steady. Steady.

1431
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,117
Slap fight!

1432
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:16,246
Shoot! Shoot!

1433
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:25,756
Nigel!

1434
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:39,978
Is this the end?

1435
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:41,605
I was too young...

1436
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,483
too beautiful to live.

1437
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:50,113
- Bob?
- Hold up! That ain't Bob!

1438
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:52,157
I told you I knew him from somewhere.

1439
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,367
My final curtain call.

1440
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:57,788
And it's standing room only.

1441
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,457
Goodbye.

1442
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:16,556
No!

1443
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:18,558
No! What have I done?

1444
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,644
If I cannot liveth with thee...

1445
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:23,480
then I shall not liveth at all.

1446
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:49,089
That frog is not poisonous.

1447
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,507
What?

1448
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:51,925
We're not dead?

1449
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,262
It's a very common mistake.
But she's a harmless pseudo-dendrobates.

1450
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:56,888
You can tell by the pink spots.

1451
01:28:56,956 --> 01:29:01,184
But my parents always told me I was
poisonous and shouldn't touch anyone.

1452
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,687
You just had really mean parents.

1453
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:05,355
Oh, wow.

1454
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:06,857
So, now...

1455
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:09,109
we can be together!

1456
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,951
- Nigel! Nigel-Wigel-Wigglepuss!
- No!

1457
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:21,037
- Somebody, help me!
- I'm going to never let you go.

1458
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,873
- I'm sorry, I'll be nicer. No!
- Never gonna let you go!

1459
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,291
No, Charlie!

1460
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,877
Charlie!

1461
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:30,088
This is unnatural!

1462
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,729
Hey, guys! Hi!

1463
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,565
There's nothing in my hair, right?
Okay.

1464
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:51,443
Directly from the heart of the
Amazon rainforest...

1465
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,320
we have some breaking news.

1466
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:55,447
Thanks to Dr. Monteiro
and his team...

1467
01:29:55,515 --> 01:30:00,118
the entire area will be designated
as a National Wildlife Refuge.

1468
01:30:00,186 --> 01:30:03,288
And together, we'll make
sure this place stays safe.

1469
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,456
Right, Blu?

1470
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,001
But that's not the only good news.

1471
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,295
We found this cockatoo
deep in the Amazon...

1472
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,006
and he seems to have bonded
with a tree frog.

1473
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:17,093
We are bringing them back to Rio
for continuing observation.

1474
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,640
Oh, Nigel! Wow!
A honeymoon in Rio!

1475
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:26,645
Put your paws, talons
and tails together...

1476
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:29,689
for the most amazing talent
ever gathered in one jungle.

1477
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:33,485
It's "Amazon Untamed!"

1478
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:35,487
Come on! Get up!

1479
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:36,613
Yeah!

1480
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,950
What's up? Don't bite it
What's up? Don't bite it

1481
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:43,828
Where my birds at?

1482
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:47,290
We're together no matter
Where we might go

1483
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,127
Flap your wings!

1484
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:53,213
If we're not all together
We can't go far

1485
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,506
Amazon!

1486
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:58,802
It's an emerald we treasure

1487
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,971
Coming from the jungle to you

1488
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:02,389
Bam!

1489
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:06,476
Beating like its heart beats

1490
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:09,479
Playing rhythms we've grown to

1491
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:13,817
It's the emerald we treasure

1492
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:17,529
- Coming from the place where we live
- The place where we live

1493
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:20,156
- The home of freedom and happiness
- Happiness

1494
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:22,684
Time flies forever The jungle's
like a breeze, it's a wonder

1495
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:25,161
Now get out your tutu
In case someone wants you to dance

1496
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,999
- Hello, Amazon!
- Hey, Luiz!

1497
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:32,877
- Hey birds, I made it!
- Welcome to the jungle, dawg!

1498
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:41,344
All my turtles! Hardcore turtles!

1499
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,437
Sing it, baby!

1500
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:54,691
Rafi!

1501
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:00,989
Are you sure you can make
the Amazon our home...

1502
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,366
with the heat and the creepy bugs?

1503
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:05,493
Are you kidding? I am Mr. Jungle.

1504
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:08,288
Totally wild, and very birdly.

1505
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:12,250
Maybe we can do summers in Rio.

1506
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:14,044
You're my one and only, Jewel.

1507
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:18,173
We're together
No matter where we might go

1508
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:24,846
Forever together
We can go far

1509
01:32:26,582 --> 01:32:29,726
That's the end?
