1
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,244
My name is Kathy H.

2
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:01,414
I'm 28 years old.

3
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,128
I've been a carer
for nine years.

4
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,470
And I'm good at my job.

5
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:20,099
My patients always do
better than expected

6
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,184
and are hardly ever
classified as agitated,

7
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:26,480
even if they're
about to make a donation.

8
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,444
I'm not trying to boast,

9
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:34,655
but I feel a great sense
of pride in what we do.

10
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:38,367
Carers and donors
have achieved so much.

11
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,998
That said,
we aren't machines.

12
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:49,754
In the end,
it wears you down.

13
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:56,010
I suppose that's why I now spend
most of my time not looking forwards

14
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:58,262
but looking back,

15
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:01,557
to The Cottages and Hailsham,

16
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,060
and what happened to us there.

17
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:06,979
Me,

18
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:10,232
Tommy,

19
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,152
and Ruth.

20
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:27,792
When we are scattered
afar and asunder

21
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:32,630
Parted are those
who are singing today

22
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:38,219
When we look back
and forgetfully wonder

23
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,265
What we were like
in our learning and play

24
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:48,896
Oh, the great days will
bring distance enchanted

25
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:53,984
Days of fresh air in
the rain and the sun

26
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:59,281
How we rejoiced as we
struggled and panted

27
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:06,288
Echoes of dreamland,
Hailsham lives on

28
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,839
Good morning, students.

29
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:17,800
Good morning,
Miss Emily.

30
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:23,055
It has come to my attention that three
burned cigarettes were discovered,

31
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:26,517
hidden behind a pot
in the flower garden.

32
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:30,980
I know that on occasion
students have seen

33
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:34,859
some of the caretakers and
deliverymen smoking cigarettes,

34
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,405
but I must emphasize, once again,
that it is much, much worse

35
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,992
for a student of Hailsham to
smoke cigarettes than anyone else.

36
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,747
Students of Hailsham
are special.

37
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:54,837
Keeping yourselves well,
keeping yourselves healthy inside,

38
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,089
is of paramount importance.

39
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:59,383
Have I made myself clear?

40
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,594
Yes, Miss Emily.

41
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,850
I think, one day,
I'd like five horses.

42
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:13,606
I don't know all their names,
but I know I'd like five horses.

43
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,441
The best
would be Thunder.

44
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,694
He'd be dangerous to ride,
so you can't ride him.

45
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,864
You can ride

46
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,450
Bramble.

47
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:28,287
Just so long as you don't
use your crop on him.

48
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,957
That's pretty.

49
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,459
You have it.

50
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,048
Look. Who's that
with Miss Emily?

51
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,718
Do you think
it's the new guardian?

52
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:43,969
Miss Lucy.

53
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,431
I think it must be.

54
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:50,142
We haven't had
a new guardian for ages.

55
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:05,242
Arthur! Arthur!

56
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,664
Catch it, Tommy.

57
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:35,981
Why didn't Tommy
get the ball?

58
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,359
Excuse me, Miss Lucy?

59
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:42,028
Why didn't Tommy
get the ball?

60
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,072
When it bounced
over the fence,

61
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:45,532
it couldn't have
been far from him.

62
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,577
The fence is the boundary
of the Hailsham grounds.

63
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:51,371
We don't go outside
the boundary, Miss Lucy.

64
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:53,373
It's too dangerous.

65
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,292
Dangerous?

66
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:58,003
There was once a boy who had
a big row with all his friends

67
00:06:58,087 --> 00:07:00,463
and then ran off
beyond the boundary.

68
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:04,759
They found him, two days later,
in the woods. Tied to a tree.

69
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,886
With his hands
and feet cut off.

70
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,930
Dead.

71
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:11,683
And there was the girl
who climbed over the fence,

72
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,101
by the front gate.

73
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:16,438
And when she tried to get back,
she wasn't allowed.

74
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,357
And then she starved.
Out there.

75
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,818
Right by the gates.

76
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,739
Who told you
these stories?

77
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:28,325
Everybody knows them.

78
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,243
And how do you know
they're true?

79
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:31,578
Of course
they're true.

80
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:34,956
Who'd make up stories
as horrible as that?

81
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:04,486
Tommy, what are you doing?

82
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,905
What is it, exactly?

83
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:09,783
I think it must be a dog.
Is it a dog, Tommy?

84
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,702
It can't be a dog.
Its eyes are too small.

85
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:15,288
I think it must be
a kind of rat.

86
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:17,165
Yes, that's it.
Tommy's drawn a rat.

87
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,333
It's not finished yet.

88
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:20,418
That's right.
You haven't finished the whiskers.

89
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,462
Do you think Tommy's rat will
be selected for The Gallery?

90
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:24,089
It's not a rat.

91
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,468
It's an elephant.

92
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,470
Children,
back to work.

93
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:03,712
He's got his shirt on.
His favorite polo shirt.

94
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:07,340
He really doesn't
suspect a thing.

95
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:11,636
Looks like no one
wants you, Tommy.

96
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,774
What's he doing?

97
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,276
It's his own fault.

98
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,821
If he learnt to keep his cool,
they'd leave him alone.

99
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,948
I hate you!
I hate you all!

100
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,241
Kath... No, don't!

101
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:46,171
You shouldn't have...

102
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,236
Kathy H.

103
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,084
What's this from?

104
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:27,420
I don't remember.

105
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,464
Doctor?

106
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:38,932
It's nothing.
Just a bruise.

107
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:47,232
Hello.

108
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:49,776
Kathy. Kathy H.

109
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,946
Of course. Kathy H.

110
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:55,156
Come in.

111
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:02,705
So what can
I do for you?

112
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:05,583
Well,

113
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:09,462
I was wondering
what you said to Tommy.

114
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,590
Out on the
playing fields.

115
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,676
I see. Oh.

116
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:17,262
So what did I say?

117
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:22,183
I believe I was trying
to calm him down.

118
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:24,143
Because he seemed upset.

119
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:28,231
He explained he was often
teased about sport and art,

120
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:31,651
so I told him he shouldn't
get upset about these things.

121
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:35,697
The other children are only
teasing him to get a reaction.

122
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:40,493
And if it happens that he's not
particularly good at sport or art,

123
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:42,620
well, that doesn't matter.

124
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:45,290
It's not so important.

125
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:52,505
Thank you.

126
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:16,696
Kathy.

127
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,117
Aren't you sitting
with the girls?

128
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:22,201
Well, I just checked

129
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,913
and I'm pretty sure I'm
not sitting with the girls.

130
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:26,247
I'm sitting with you.

131
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,084
I wanted to say

132
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:34,005
I'm sorry.

133
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:37,383
I didn't mean
to hit you.

134
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:42,138
I mean, I wouldn't
want to hit any girl.

135
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,601
But particularly
not you.

136
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:50,855
Well, it was an accident,
that's all.

137
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,652
Tommy,
finish those vegetables.

138
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,505
I'm not gonna get angry
like that anymore.

139
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:19,384
Because of what Miss Lucy told you,
about being creative?

140
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:21,052
How do you know
about that?

141
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,178
I'm nosey.

142
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:29,811
She can't actually mean that being
creative isn't important, can she?

143
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,188
I mean, what about
The Gallery?

144
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,273
If being creative
isn't important,

145
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:36,359
then why have
a gallery at all?

146
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:40,613
I don't know.

147
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:49,123
...by arching her back,
or perhaps with the aid of a pillow,

148
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,042
the woman can
arrange herself...

149
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,227
Smile

150
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:25,826
Good morning, ma'am.

151
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,077
Good morning.

152
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,662
Can I help you?

153
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:31,665
I wanted one tea,
with milk and sugar in it.

154
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,960
One tea. Right.

155
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,010
Tommy.

156
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:45,679
Oh! One tea with milk
and sugar in it, please.

157
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:48,015
No, Tommy.

158
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:52,811
I want to hear
your own order.

159
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:54,563
Don't simply repeat
the one you've just heard.

160
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:58,192
What other drinks
do they serve in cafes?

161
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,610
Water.

162
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:03,781
Coffee.

163
00:15:03,865 --> 00:15:04,865
Coffee.

164
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,035
So, then.

165
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:10,204
So, then,

166
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:14,041
one coffee, please,
with milk and sugar in it.

167
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:21,256
Thank you.

168
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,226
I think Laura
likes Arthur.

169
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:35,687
All the girls like
Arthur, don't they?

170
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:38,065
Maybe.

171
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:40,984
I'm not sure you do.

172
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:44,488
He's not my type.

173
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:47,825
I think Laura and Arthur will be
the first in our year to have sex

174
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:51,370
because, if Arthur wants to,
Laura wouldn't stop him.

175
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,248
I'm sure you're right.

176
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,045
Tommy's changed.

177
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,464
Changed how?

178
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:05,259
Just changed.

179
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:07,803
That's all.

180
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,794
What about this one
by Madeleine Kane?

181
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:44,464
I think it shows more
than technical ability.

182
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:47,176
It gives a real insight
into the child.

183
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:50,345
Which is precisely what
Marie-Claude wants for The Gallery.

184
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,222
Yes, I agree.

185
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,060
Mmm.

186
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,479
Put these
two together.

187
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:02,191
Madame is coming.

188
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:54,534
Good morning, students.

189
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:57,663
Good morning,
Miss Emily.

190
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,750
There are several
points of order today.

191
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:05,587
The first is that our good friend,
Madame Marie-Claude, is visiting us.

192
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:09,967
She will, as usual, be carefully
inspecting your artwork and poetry

193
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:14,096
and selecting the very best pieces
for inclusion in her Gallery.

194
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:16,974
We will, of course,
extend to her every courtesy

195
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:19,726
and make her feel
most welcome.

196
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:23,647
Second point of order,
a piece of good news for all students

197
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:26,608
who have been diligent
in collecting tokens.

198
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:29,820
After studies tomorrow,
there will be a sale.

199
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,407
The delivery
will arrive in the morning,

200
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,867
and I was assured
by the van driver

201
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:39,204
that the boxes will
contain a bumper crop.

202
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,089
Is it really
a bumper crop?

203
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,886
I should say so. Yeah, sweetheart.
It's a bumper crop.

204
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,077
Hey.

205
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:44,955
Aren't you buying?

206
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:48,792
If you've already spent all your tokens,
you can have some of mine.

207
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:52,629
I have tokens. I was just gonna
wait till the rush died down.

208
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:55,465
I'm sure there'll be
something good left.

209
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,552
What's the matter, Kath?

210
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,932
Well, anyway,
it doesn't matter

211
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:06,560
if you can't find
anything in the sale

212
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:10,272
because I already
found you something.

213
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:14,443
A music tape.

214
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:18,155
I don't know much about it,
if it's much good or anything.

215
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:23,827
Thank you.

216
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:31,585
* Darling *

217
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:45,266
* Hold me *

218
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,934
* And never *

219
00:21:47,978 --> 00:21:51,772
* Never *

220
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:56,068
* Let me go *

221
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:07,663
* Darling *

222
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:21,052
* Kiss me *

223
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:23,012
* And never *

224
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:27,642
* Never *

225
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:32,813
* Let me go *

226
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:05,763
The problem is

227
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,142
you've been told
and not told.

228
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:13,479
That's what I've seen
while I've been here.

229
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:16,732
You've been told

230
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:19,652
but none of you
really understand.

231
00:23:20,654 --> 00:23:24,782
So I've decided I'll talk to you
in a way that you will understand.

232
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:30,746
Do you know what happens to
children when they grow up?

233
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,211
No, you don't,
because nobody knows.

234
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:42,091
They might grow up
to become actors,

235
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:45,052
move to America.

236
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:49,307
Or they might work
in supermarkets.

237
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:51,726
Or teach in schools.

238
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:57,648
They might become sportsmen or bus
conductors or racing car drivers.

239
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:00,318
They might do
almost anything.

240
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:04,614
But with you
we do know.

241
00:24:07,743 --> 00:24:10,036
None of you
will go to America.

242
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,790
None of you will work
in supermarkets.

243
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,337
None of you will do anything
except live the life

244
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:21,631
that has already
been set out for you.

245
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,344
You will
become adults,

246
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:29,764
but only briefly.

247
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,935
Before you are old,

248
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:38,856
before you are
even middle-aged,

249
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:42,610
you will start to donate
your vital organs.

250
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:47,615
That's what you were
created to do.

251
00:24:50,118 --> 00:24:54,622
And sometime around your
third or fourth donation,

252
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:58,459
your short life
will be complete.

253
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:04,548
You have to know who you
are and what you are.

254
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:08,678
It's the only way you'll
lead decent lives.

255
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:03,107
There will be only one
announcement this morning,

256
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,901
which is that Miss Lucy,

257
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:08,404
who was guardian
to the fourth-year students,

258
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,157
is no longer
working at Hailsham.

259
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:17,955
A replacement will be found for her,
and in the meantime

260
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,042
her classes will be divided
between Miss Geraldine and myself.

261
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,714
It is hard, is it not,

262
00:26:27,257 --> 00:26:31,260
to continue in the face
of deliberate subversion.

263
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:37,057
There are those who seek
to thwart us, this is clear.

264
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:41,145
And we are aware that the tide
is not with forward thinking.

265
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:42,563
It never is.

266
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:47,485
No, the tide is with
the entrenched mindset.

267
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,196
With values that
are still unexamined.

268
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:55,326
But I will not be coerced.

269
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:02,416
I will not be coerced.

270
00:27:05,378 --> 00:27:07,755
And neither will Hailsham.

271
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:16,824
I didn't understand why,
after all her teasing,

272
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:22,037
Ruth would decide that Tommy was
the boy she liked most of all.

273
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:34,300
They say girls are always
mean to the boys they like.

274
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:40,681
So maybe Ruth
had liked him all along.

275
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:48,564
Maybe I should have
teased him, too.

276
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:05,205
I kept hoping
they would separate,

277
00:29:05,415 --> 00:29:09,168
like the other childhood and
teenage romances at the school.

278
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:16,675
They never did.

279
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:53,838
We were moved
from Hailsham at 18

280
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:56,341
and sent to various
accommodations around the country,

281
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:59,678
to wait until we were old
enough to start the donations.

282
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:04,307
Tommy, Ruth and I

283
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:08,353
were sent to a collection of farm
buildings called The Cottages.

284
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:15,860
During our stay there,
we were told

285
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:19,572
that some of us would be
permitted to volunteer as carers.

286
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:25,954
But, apart from that,
we'd be left largely to our own devices

287
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,250
and even allowed to take day trips
into the surrounding countryside.

288
00:30:35,297 --> 00:30:37,215
The Cottages were also
our first contact

289
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:40,218
with those who had not
grown up at Hailsham.

290
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:42,470
There were people
from White Mansion,

291
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:47,517
Oakhill, Morningdale and other
homes I'd never heard of.

292
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:54,149
Everyone seemed wiser
and more worldly than us.

293
00:30:56,694 --> 00:30:59,654
None more so than
Rodney and Chrissie.

294
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:02,449
They'd already been at The
Cottages for over a year

295
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:05,744
and would soon be leaving
for the completion centers.

296
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:08,580
Ricky?
I don't know what you're talking about.

297
00:31:08,664 --> 00:31:10,540
Oh, I can
help you out there.

298
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:14,544
He's talking about blue eyes,
blond hair, cute dimples when he smiles.

299
00:31:14,628 --> 00:31:17,338
And biceps that
could crack walnuts.

300
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:21,843
Jennifer, get real,
I saw you with him.

301
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:25,513
Jen and Ricky sitting in
a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

302
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:28,892
That is so not true.

303
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:32,687
We weren't in a tree.

304
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:51,873
Hey.

305
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,712
Where you going?

306
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,507
I thought
I'd go for a walk.

307
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:04,886
Does that mean
you want to be alone?

308
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:38,044
I'm not even saying that
I'll apply to be a carer.

309
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:40,380
Just that several people have
said that I'd be good at it.

310
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:42,590
But then Laura went around
telling everyone

311
00:32:42,675 --> 00:32:45,176
that I'd been saying I was the
most likely to get selected.

312
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:46,344
That's so not true.

313
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:47,887
So not true.

314
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:49,848
Thank you.

315
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,769
I'm getting
more plates.

316
00:32:56,438 --> 00:32:58,273
Is there
anything left for us?

317
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,400
I don't know.

318
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,154
Perhaps not.

319
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:07,866
Ruth, why do you
do that thing?

320
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:09,993
Squeezing
Tommy's shoulder.

321
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:13,955
I'm allowed to touch Tommy,
aren't I?

322
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,291
It's the way
you're touching him.

323
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:18,793
You know what I mean.
It's copied from that television show.

324
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:20,962
That's so not...

325
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:23,590
Don't tell me
"that's so not true."

326
00:33:25,593 --> 00:33:28,553
All that behavior, that's not what
people do out there, in real life,

327
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:29,888
if that's what
you were thinking.

328
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:33,057
So what? Look, it's no big deal.
A lot of us do it.

329
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:35,226
What you mean is
Chrissie and Rod do it.

330
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:38,146
Oh, Kathy.

331
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,109
So that's what
this is about.

332
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:45,153
It must be really
awful for you,

333
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:46,696
surrounded by
all these couples.

334
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:51,075
I never said that.
I just think it's daft.

335
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:54,370
You copy them,
and they copy from a television show.

336
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,539
I'm right,
aren't I?

337
00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:01,878
You don't like the fact that Tommy and
I are friends with Chrissie and Rod,

338
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:03,838
whereas you hardly
speak to anyone.

339
00:34:06,842 --> 00:34:09,844
No. You're not right.

340
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:12,931
"So" not right?

341
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:34,202
Thank you, Mr. Keffers.

342
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,270
Hello, Tommy.

343
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:44,856
Hello, Kath.

344
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:52,447
Well, don't just hover in the doorway.
Come in. Join the fun.

345
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:56,784
Didn't know you liked
that sort of stuff.

346
00:35:58,078 --> 00:35:59,829
You're very welcome to them
after I've finished.

347
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:02,415
Oh, no,
it's just sex stuff.

348
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,793
I expect I've seen
them all already anyway.

349
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:12,216
Kathy, what are
you looking for?

350
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:16,304
What do you mean?
I'm just looking at dirty pictures.

351
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,723
What, just for kicks?

352
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:21,267
I suppose you could
say that, yes.

353
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:30,610
If it's just for kicks,
then you don't do it like that.

354
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,447
You need to look at each
picture more carefully.

355
00:36:34,656 --> 00:36:36,991
Nothing really happens
if you go that fast.

356
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:39,619
How do you know
what works for girls?

357
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,332
Kath, you're not
looking for kicks.

358
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:52,090
Here, give it to Ruth.
See if it does anything for her.

359
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:11,859
Hi.

360
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,656
I suppose you've heard what Rod
and Chrissie have been saying.

361
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:19,200
No, I haven't.

362
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:26,416
Well, you know that
Rod and Chrissie

363
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,960
have been thinking of
applying to be carers,

364
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:29,044
so they've been
learning how to drive.

365
00:37:29,129 --> 00:37:30,129
Yeah.

366
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:34,883
Well, last weekend, they went up
to a town on the Norfolk coast,

367
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:38,387
and they think
they saw this person.

368
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:39,972
What kind of person?

369
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:42,683
A lady

370
00:37:43,852 --> 00:37:45,310
working in an office.

371
00:37:45,854 --> 00:37:47,020
And...

372
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:50,399
What is it, Ruth?

373
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:55,154
But they thought this
person was a Possible.

374
00:37:57,532 --> 00:37:59,283
For me.

375
00:37:59,993 --> 00:38:01,326
They found
your Original?

376
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:03,745
They aren't sure,
obviously,

377
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,832
but Rodney said that the
resemblance was really striking.

378
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:09,209
Oh, my God. Ruth!
I know.

379
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:14,131
They want to drive me back up
there so that I can see for myself.

380
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:16,508
Tommy will come, but...

381
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:18,260
Do you want me to come?

382
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,724
Ruth, of course.

383
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:38,030
So, exactly how much experience
have you guys had with the outside?

384
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:39,948
Quite a lot.

385
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:41,450
No, we haven't.

386
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,205
We did a lot of role-playing
exercises at Hailsham.

387
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:47,956
They don't count.

388
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:51,585
Okay. Well,
don't feel scared.

389
00:38:51,711 --> 00:38:54,713
Okay? There's really...
There's nothing to it.

390
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:58,133
We aren't scared.

391
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,427
Good.

392
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:25,077
I'll get sausage,
egg and chips.

393
00:39:29,624 --> 00:39:30,749
Sausage,
egg and chips, please.

394
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:31,917
Yes, sausage,
egg and chips.

395
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:34,044
Sausage, egg and chips,
me, too, please.

396
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:38,382
Well, I suppose I'd better get sausage,
egg and chips, too, then.

397
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:42,594
Five sausage,
egg and chips. Drinks?

398
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:46,848
Five Cokes, please.

399
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:03,657
It was good.
It was really good.

400
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:06,410
What?
Sorry.

401
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:15,502
You know, there's something I've been
wanting to talk to you lot about.

402
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:19,131
The problem is that back there
at The Cottages it's impossible.

403
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,550
Someone's always
listening in.

404
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:24,303
So,

405
00:40:27,015 --> 00:40:29,308
someone was saying that some
Hailsham students in the past

406
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:32,060
have managed
to get a deferral.

407
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:33,729
Apparently those
Hailsham students

408
00:40:33,813 --> 00:40:36,898
could have their first
donation put back by three

409
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,027
or even four years.

410
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:45,407
As long as they qualified.

411
00:40:46,326 --> 00:40:48,535
If there was a boy
and a girl,

412
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:50,954
and they were in love
with each other,

413
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,875
really properly in love,
and they could prove it,

414
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:58,462
then they would be given
a few years together

415
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:01,089
before they began
their donations.

416
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,511
Where did you
hear about this?

417
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:08,764
When we were
at White Mansion.

418
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,058
People there were always going
on about this Hailsham couple.

419
00:41:11,726 --> 00:41:13,310
When the guy was only a
few weeks from donation,

420
00:41:13,394 --> 00:41:16,897
he just went to see someone. He applied,
and everything got sorted out.

421
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:21,401
I suppose you lot would know
about that sort of thing.

422
00:41:21,486 --> 00:41:25,280
Being from Hailsham,
you'd know how that sort of thing works.

423
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:28,283
Who is it
you go to?

424
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:32,788
Who would we talk to
if we wanted to apply?

425
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:43,090
To be honest,
I don't know what you're talking about.

426
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:46,635
Come on.

427
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:49,638
Do you expect us
to believe that?

428
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:52,557
Everybody knows
Hailsham is special.

429
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:54,810
So what is it?

430
00:41:56,104 --> 00:41:58,689
Why keep these
things to yourself?

431
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:07,823
There were lots of
stories at Hailsham.

432
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:12,285
I don't think many of them
turned out to be true.

433
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:40,939
It may be
down here.

434
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,409
Yeah.

435
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:54,202
That's it.

436
00:43:20,646 --> 00:43:22,397
God, it must be her.

437
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:25,692
Yeah, that's her.

438
00:43:52,053 --> 00:43:53,678
It's not her.

439
00:43:55,306 --> 00:43:57,307
I'm not her.
No, you're not.

440
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,017
It was really
close, though.

441
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:01,686
Oh, shut up, Tommy! It wasn't close.
It wasn't close at all.

442
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:05,106
And I knew it wasn't gonna be
her before we even got here!

443
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:07,317
It was never
gonna be her.

444
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:10,487
They never, ever model us
on people like that woman.

445
00:44:10,571 --> 00:44:12,197
Ruth, don't.
What?

446
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:14,950
We all know it,
we just never say it.

447
00:44:16,244 --> 00:44:18,537
We are modeled on trash.

448
00:44:18,663 --> 00:44:22,624
Junkies, prostitutes,
winos, tramps.

449
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:26,336
Convicts, maybe,
as long as they aren't psychos.

450
00:44:27,463 --> 00:44:31,466
If you want to look for Possibles,
if you want to do it properly,

451
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:34,845
look in the gutter.

452
00:44:36,764 --> 00:44:38,765
That's where we came from.

453
00:45:06,335 --> 00:45:10,714
Hey.

454
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:44,206
We should go back.

455
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,750
Don't tell me
to calm down!

456
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:13,045
You walked down the pier
and you left me there.

457
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,797
You knew
I was well upset.

458
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:28,644
Out here.

459
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:48,247
Chrissie and Rod are pretty obsessed
about this rumor, aren't they?

460
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:50,291
About the deferrals?
Mmm.

461
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:55,504
I was thinking about it
again last night,

462
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,965
and if this
rumor's true

463
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,427
it might explain
a few things.

464
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:03,262
Such as?
Well,

465
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,265
The Gallery,
for instance.

466
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:10,061
We never got to the bottom of it,
what The Gallery was for.

467
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:12,605
Pictures, poetry
and sculpture.

468
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,231
Say something
about yourself.

469
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:16,567
That's the whole point
about art, isn't it?

470
00:48:16,651 --> 00:48:19,904
It says what's inside of you.
It reveals your soul.

471
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:21,947
Yeah. So?

472
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:35,878
Suppose for a second
that the rumor is true.

473
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:39,173
That there is a special
arrangement for Hailsham students,

474
00:48:39,257 --> 00:48:40,800
if they're in love.

475
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:45,054
Well, there would have
to be some kind of way

476
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:49,391
to decide if couples
are telling the truth

477
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,478
and not just lying
to put off their donations.

478
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:02,988
That's what The Gallery could be for.

479
00:49:03,865 --> 00:49:06,242
In The Gallery they have everything
about us they need to know.

480
00:49:06,326 --> 00:49:08,661
So if we say that
we're in love,

481
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:12,790
they can look into our
souls and they can see.

482
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:15,584
They'll know if it's real
love or if it's just a lie.

483
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,796
That's a strange idea, Tommy.

484
00:49:20,382 --> 00:49:21,465
What?

485
00:49:23,635 --> 00:49:26,637
No, no. I don't think that's any
stranger than any other idea.

486
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:30,141
And didn't Miss Lucy say that making art
for The Gallery wasn't even important?

487
00:49:30,225 --> 00:49:31,600
Yes.

488
00:49:33,395 --> 00:49:35,604
But look what
happened to her.

489
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:48,659
Are you thinking
of applying?

490
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:50,953
With Ruth?

491
00:49:54,332 --> 00:49:55,374
No.

492
00:49:56,668 --> 00:49:57,877
It wouldn't work.

493
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,213
Why?

494
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:10,139
Because

495
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:19,815
you forget that

496
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,569
you got lots of stuff into
The Gallery over the years,

497
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:27,114
and if I applied they wouldn't
have anything to go on.

498
00:50:41,546 --> 00:50:43,714
It's all just rumors
and theories.

499
00:50:48,094 --> 00:50:49,553
Yeah, I know.

500
00:50:52,807 --> 00:50:54,308
Tommy.

501
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:54,618
* Kiss me *

502
00:51:54,703 --> 00:51:57,162
* And never *

503
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:01,709
* Never *

504
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:05,587
* Let me go *

505
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,265
* Lock my heart *

506
00:52:18,727 --> 00:52:22,187
* Throw away the key *

507
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:26,066
* Feel my love *

508
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,463
I know what
you think, Kathy.

509
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:54,720
I know you think that you and Tommy
would have made a more natural couple,

510
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,972
and you believe

511
00:52:57,057 --> 00:53:00,517
that there's a chance that Tommy
and I will split up some day.

512
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,689
And when we do, perhaps that
will be your chance with Tommy.

513
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:08,984
Chance to do it
right this time.

514
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:19,037
But you see,
the thing is, Kathy,

515
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,999
although Tommy really
likes you as a friend,

516
00:53:24,126 --> 00:53:26,836
he just doesn't
see you that way.

517
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:34,094
He told me about
the porno magazines.

518
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:39,140
We had quite
a laugh about it.

519
00:53:42,103 --> 00:53:45,897
He doesn't understand
what you were doing.

520
00:53:47,983 --> 00:53:49,651
But I did.

521
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:54,364
Oh!

522
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:17,262
I said I'll just be five minutes.

523
00:54:22,435 --> 00:54:24,227
I want to be
a carer.

524
00:54:26,272 --> 00:54:27,647
It's you who
I apply to, isn't it?

525
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,065
Yeah.

526
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:31,192
I said that
I'm applying.

527
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:35,572
I'll bring
the forms tomorrow,

528
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:37,740
and that'll start
the process.

529
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:52,255
By the time Ruth and Tommy
actually did separate,

530
00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:54,466
my carer training
had already begun.

531
00:54:56,677 --> 00:54:59,262
So I was hardly ever
at The Cottages.

532
00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:27,707
It had never occurred to me
that our lives,

533
00:55:28,209 --> 00:55:30,627
which had been
so closely interwoven,

534
00:55:33,547 --> 00:55:36,132
could unravel
with such speed.

535
00:55:50,898 --> 00:55:52,357
If I'd known,

536
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:55,652
maybe I'd have kept
tighter hold of them

537
00:55:58,113 --> 00:56:01,324
and not let unseen tides
pull us apart.

538
00:56:46,787 --> 00:56:48,454
Once I began working
with my donors,

539
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:51,708
I didn't have much time
to dwell on Tommy or Ruth.

540
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,419
Eventually,
so many years had passed

541
00:56:54,503 --> 00:56:57,255
I came to think I would
never see them again.

542
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:08,099
Many carers find themselves
just going through the motions,

543
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:12,395
waiting for the day that they
can stop and become donors.

544
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:20,320
But for the most part,
being a carer has suited me fine.

545
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:25,658
I quite enjoy traveling
across the country,

546
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:29,370
shuttling from center to center,
hospital to hospital.

547
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,469
Here you are.

548
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,930
Dark chocolate.

549
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:52,101
If you knew how many shops I had
to go to before I found those.

550
00:57:52,353 --> 00:57:55,730
I thought I wasn't allowed to
eat so soon before the operation.

551
00:57:55,814 --> 00:57:58,983
Oh, you're not.
But I am.

552
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:00,193
And after the operation,

553
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:03,237
you can wolf down
the whole packet in one go.

554
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:20,880
For me,
the real test of being a carer

555
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:24,092
is when a donor completes
earlier than expected.

556
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:28,137
On the second
or even first donation.

557
00:58:28,555 --> 00:58:29,931
Can I just have
a quick word?

558
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,099
Okay.

559
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:34,727
I was wondering who'd be
working on Hannah today.

560
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:38,147
I'd never say I've become
immune to the completions.

561
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:42,110
But they are something
I am able to live with.

562
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,950
You're Hannah's carer,
aren't you?

563
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:51,619
Hannah's carer?
Yes.

564
00:58:52,913 --> 00:58:56,541
I'm sorry, it's always hard,
but there were complications.

565
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,130
You need me
to sign the release?

566
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:03,423
Please.

567
00:59:05,634 --> 00:59:07,719
Are you going
to leave now?

568
00:59:07,803 --> 00:59:09,929
We can quite easily provide
you with a bed tonight

569
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,514
if you've got
a long drive.

570
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,016
I can be back home
in under two hours.

571
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:15,727
It's always better to wake at home,
isn't it?

572
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:26,946
Is that someone
you know?

573
00:59:27,072 --> 00:59:28,531
Yeah.

574
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:32,827
Actually,
we grew up together.

575
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:34,996
Oh.
How is she?

576
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:37,165
Were you close?

577
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:39,876
We haven't seen each other
now for almost 10 years.

578
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,338
Well, Ruth isn't as strong as
we would hope, at this stage.

579
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,509
She's done
two donations.

580
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:50,386
She has.

581
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,889
You think she'll complete on the third?

582
00:59:53,766 --> 00:59:55,975
I think she wants
to complete.

583
00:59:56,894 --> 01:00:01,230
And, as you know, when they want
to complete, they usually do.

584
01:01:20,436 --> 01:01:22,104
Kathy.

585
01:01:32,532 --> 01:01:35,492
I've been keeping tabs
on you over the years.

586
01:01:35,743 --> 01:01:37,286
And Tommy, too.

587
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,580
What do you
hear about Tommy?

588
01:01:39,664 --> 01:01:42,916
That he's done
his second donation, too,

589
01:01:43,001 --> 01:01:45,836
and apparently he's
doing very well on it.

590
01:01:46,504 --> 01:01:47,671
Apparently
he's in better shape

591
01:01:47,755 --> 01:01:50,215
than some after
their first donation.

592
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:53,176
Good old Tommy.
I'm not surprised.

593
01:01:55,305 --> 01:01:57,264
Are you surprised at me?

594
01:01:59,267 --> 01:02:02,102
I expect I look
a bit broken, Kath.

595
01:02:04,355 --> 01:02:06,023
It's okay.

596
01:02:06,316 --> 01:02:09,359
I don't think I'd want to survive
my third donation, anyway.

597
01:02:10,028 --> 01:02:12,154
You hear things,
don't you?

598
01:02:12,363 --> 01:02:14,323
What kind of things?

599
01:02:14,866 --> 01:02:16,658
Oh, you know.

600
01:02:19,871 --> 01:02:22,039
How, maybe,
after the fourth donation,

601
01:02:22,123 --> 01:02:24,917
even if you've
technically completed,

602
01:02:25,043 --> 01:02:28,211
you're still conscious
in some sort of way.

603
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:33,300
And then you find out that there
are more donations, plenty of them.

604
01:02:33,384 --> 01:02:37,596
No more recovery centers.
No more carers.

605
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:41,391
Just watching
and waiting.

606
01:02:43,144 --> 01:02:45,479
Till they switch you off.

607
01:02:51,319 --> 01:02:53,737
I don't think
I fancy that.

608
01:02:57,742 --> 01:03:00,160
Is it the end
of the day already?

609
01:03:01,537 --> 01:03:03,288
Do you know,
it's funny,

610
01:03:03,373 --> 01:03:07,668
I think I've thought about you
every day for the last few months.

611
01:03:07,752 --> 01:03:09,753
Hoping I'd see you again.

612
01:03:11,422 --> 01:03:14,257
Do you know,
I felt sure that I would.

613
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,847
Seemed impossible that I'd complete
without seeing you one last time.

614
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:25,769
It's not
the last time, Ruth.

615
01:03:26,771 --> 01:03:28,647
They offered me a bed.

616
01:03:28,731 --> 01:03:31,108
I was planning on
staying the night anyway.

617
01:03:31,317 --> 01:03:32,943
Well.

618
01:03:57,885 --> 01:04:00,387
I always knew
you'd be a good carer.

619
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:02,973
Your donors
are very lucky.

620
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:11,440
Look, I was lying
awake last night

621
01:04:11,524 --> 01:04:14,484
and I suddenly had an idea
that we'd take a trip together.

622
01:04:14,694 --> 01:04:16,486
Where to?

623
01:04:16,988 --> 01:04:19,865
I hadn't much thought
of where, just a trip.

624
01:04:24,245 --> 01:04:25,829
Although

625
01:04:27,415 --> 01:04:29,166
a place
did spring to mind.

626
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,752
One of the boys on the other
floor was talking about it.

627
01:04:31,836 --> 01:04:33,670
It's near the
Kingsfield Recovery Center.

628
01:04:34,172 --> 01:04:37,674
Is it the boat?
The one left on the beach?

629
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,384
You've heard
about it, too?

630
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:42,012
I heard.
One of the carers who worked there.

631
01:04:45,224 --> 01:04:46,975
And do you suppose,

632
01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:51,229
if we're driving
all that way,

633
01:04:51,981 --> 01:04:54,274
that we could
call in on Tommy?

634
01:04:58,488 --> 01:05:01,448
Told you I'd been
keeping tabs on you.

635
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:04,576
Have you seen him?

636
01:05:05,828 --> 01:05:07,162
No, not since
The Cottages.

637
01:05:08,206 --> 01:05:09,831
No, neither have I.

638
01:05:15,963 --> 01:05:17,464
How will
we find him?

639
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:20,217
His carer said
he'd be waiting outside.

640
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:38,568
Look, there he is.

641
01:05:45,451 --> 01:05:48,662
Do you think he's recognized
us through the glass?

642
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:52,749
No, no, no.

643
01:05:52,834 --> 01:05:54,835
Let's not get out.

644
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:12,686
Ruth's
in the car.

645
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,937
Oh, right.

646
01:06:14,063 --> 01:06:15,438
Hey!

647
01:06:15,898 --> 01:06:17,274
Hi!

648
01:06:18,776 --> 01:06:20,110
Hi.
Hi.

649
01:06:21,571 --> 01:06:22,612
How are you?

650
01:06:22,697 --> 01:06:23,780
I'm good.

651
01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:25,323
Look at your hair.

652
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:27,117
Oh, yeah.
My hair.

653
01:06:35,543 --> 01:06:37,878
I can't quite believe
that I have you both here.

654
01:06:40,923 --> 01:06:42,507
Does it feel to you that
we're back at Hailsham again?

655
01:06:42,592 --> 01:06:44,885
Like no time
has passed?

656
01:06:45,511 --> 01:06:46,595
No, it doesn't.

657
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:47,971
No, it doesn't
at all, does it?

658
01:06:48,389 --> 01:06:51,141
It really doesn't at all.
It's really weird.

659
01:06:51,267 --> 01:06:52,893
But a good weird, I think.

660
01:06:57,773 --> 01:07:01,318
I don't suppose you both heard
that Hailsham was closed?

661
01:07:03,905 --> 01:07:07,157
The only schools left now,
you hear they're like battery farms.

662
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:09,826
Like Morningdale.

663
01:07:10,286 --> 01:07:13,330
I'm sure that's
an exaggeration, though.

664
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,667
Are you sure we're going the right way?

665
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:35,352
It's locked,
it looks like.

666
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:37,771
No one said
anything about this.

667
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,606
No one said anything
about a locked gate.

668
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,525
Ruth, just relax.
It's okay.

669
01:07:51,202 --> 01:07:53,036
Can walk through here.

670
01:08:21,065 --> 01:08:22,107
Wow.

671
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,706
Hey, come on.

672
01:09:25,339 --> 01:09:28,466
I wonder if that's what
Hailsham looks like now.

673
01:09:31,094 --> 01:09:34,055
Do you ever hear, Kath,
about any of the students from Hailsham?

674
01:09:34,139 --> 01:09:36,057
Sometimes, yeah.

675
01:09:37,559 --> 01:09:42,521
I heard that Amanda completed
on her first donation.

676
01:09:43,148 --> 01:09:46,233
I think that happens
more than they ever tell us.

677
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:47,318
Hmm.

678
01:09:47,402 --> 01:09:51,197
Yeah, there was this
guy at my care center

679
01:09:51,323 --> 01:09:56,327
who was always really scared of
completing on his first donation.

680
01:09:57,537 --> 01:09:59,330
But it was all fine.

681
01:09:59,414 --> 01:10:02,333
And he's just come
through his third one now,

682
01:10:02,959 --> 01:10:05,836
and he's completely
all right.

683
01:10:10,967 --> 01:10:13,094
It's funny,
I don't think...

684
01:10:14,179 --> 01:10:16,263
Well, I know I wouldn't
have been a very good carer,

685
01:10:16,348 --> 01:10:18,391
but in a way I actually
think I'm quite a good donor.

686
01:10:18,475 --> 01:10:21,185
That's what we're supposed to be,
isn't it?

687
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,366
I'd like you
to forgive me.

688
01:10:37,994 --> 01:10:39,787
I don't expect
you to.

689
01:10:40,372 --> 01:10:41,497
Forgive you
for what?

690
01:10:48,797 --> 01:10:51,132
For keeping you
and Tommy apart.

691
01:10:55,011 --> 01:10:58,305
Should have been you two together,
I always knew it.

692
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,641
As far back
as I can remember.

693
01:11:02,644 --> 01:11:06,063
It wasn't just because of
the rumors about deferrals.

694
01:11:10,527 --> 01:11:12,736
It was because
I was jealous.

695
01:11:15,323 --> 01:11:19,452
You had real love
and I didn't,

696
01:11:23,248 --> 01:11:26,584
and I didn't want to be
the one that was left alone.

697
01:11:37,721 --> 01:11:39,388
It's the worst thing
I ever did.

698
01:11:43,935 --> 01:11:46,270
And now I want
to put it right.

699
01:11:46,646 --> 01:11:48,355
I don't know how you can do that, Ruth.

700
01:11:48,857 --> 01:11:50,274
I can

701
01:11:51,776 --> 01:11:53,444
if you two
get a deferral.

702
01:11:54,446 --> 01:11:56,614
It's too late
for that, Ruth.

703
01:11:57,115 --> 01:11:59,950
Way too late.
It's stupid to even think about it.

704
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:04,330
It isn't too late.
Look, you'll see, both of you.

705
01:12:05,081 --> 01:12:09,627
I wanted to do this trip because I had
something that I wanted to give you.

706
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:12,963
It's Madame's address.

707
01:12:15,884 --> 01:12:19,595
That's who you apply to.
That's who you have to go and see.

708
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:24,183
How did you
get this?

709
01:12:25,894 --> 01:12:29,688
It wasn't easy, but I've had
years to think about what I did.

710
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:34,318
And years to try and work
out a way to make it right.

711
01:13:19,364 --> 01:13:22,575
I started doing them when
we were at The Cottages.

712
01:13:22,742 --> 01:13:25,244
The day after we went
to find Ruth's Possible.

713
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,289
I realized that if I was ever
going to apply for a deferral,

714
01:13:28,373 --> 01:13:30,624
then I'd have to
show them something.

715
01:13:32,043 --> 01:13:35,045
And I've done hundreds
of them over the years.

716
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:38,257
They're wonderful.

717
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:40,551
What? Really?

718
01:13:40,802 --> 01:13:42,219
Yeah.

719
01:13:43,805 --> 01:13:45,472
Well, thank you.

720
01:13:57,611 --> 01:14:00,738
I have never showed
anyone them until now.

721
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,284
They were my secret.

722
01:14:06,995 --> 01:14:09,747
Just like you and those porno magazines.

723
01:14:10,498 --> 01:14:12,166
You remember that?

724
01:14:12,584 --> 01:14:13,667
Yeah.

725
01:14:16,171 --> 01:14:18,088
Ruth said you didn't
understand what I was doing.

726
01:14:18,173 --> 01:14:20,299
No, I don't think she
understood what you were doing.

727
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:22,468
She thought you were looking
at the dirty pictures

728
01:14:22,552 --> 01:14:25,095
in order
to find out about sex

729
01:14:27,182 --> 01:14:30,809
and to find out what you were
missing out on or something.

730
01:14:34,314 --> 01:14:35,856
I knew.

731
01:14:37,525 --> 01:14:40,653
I knew you were looking
for your Original.

732
01:14:43,323 --> 01:14:47,117
I used to have these huge
urges to have sex sometimes.

733
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:50,663
And sometimes
they'd be so powerful,

734
01:14:51,206 --> 01:14:53,123
I just thought
I'd do it with anyone.

735
01:14:55,627 --> 01:14:58,462
So I thought that
had to tell me something.

736
01:14:58,588 --> 01:15:01,382
Something about the kind
of person I was modeled on.

737
01:15:03,802 --> 01:15:05,469
It's stupid,

738
01:15:07,055 --> 01:15:10,140
but I guessed the magazines would be
the most likely place I'd find her.

739
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,061
You know those urges
are natural, don't you?

740
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:17,690
You know all of us had them.
You know that now, right?

741
01:15:31,413 --> 01:15:33,163
"From Basrah we sailed,

742
01:15:34,582 --> 01:15:38,335
"day after day,
night after night, over the sea,

743
01:15:39,462 --> 01:15:43,340
"visiting island after
island and land after land,

744
01:15:44,676 --> 01:15:47,720
"selling or bartering
our goods at each.

745
01:15:51,307 --> 01:15:55,769
"One day, after some weeks of
sailing out of sight of land,

746
01:15:55,854 --> 01:15:58,564
"we saw an island in the sea
with such fair greenery

747
01:15:58,648 --> 01:16:01,859
"that it appeared like one
of the gardens of Eden.

748
01:16:02,444 --> 01:16:05,863
"At once the captain made
towards this delectable land

749
01:16:05,947 --> 01:16:09,950
"and, when the anchor had been
cast and the ladder lowered,

750
01:16:10,034 --> 01:16:12,870
"allowed his passengers
to disembark."

751
01:16:19,502 --> 01:16:21,211
Don't stop.

752
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:51,946
Ruth got it right. Right street,
right door, everything.

753
01:18:56,452 --> 01:18:59,996
We have to decide which of
my drawings we're gonna take.

754
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:06,044
Just take the best ones.
Maybe six or seven of them.

755
01:19:06,128 --> 01:19:08,129
You have to help me.
Yeah, I know.

756
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:17,305
So, we'll just go there.

757
01:19:17,389 --> 01:19:18,431
Mmm.

758
01:19:18,515 --> 01:19:20,183
Next week.

759
01:19:20,267 --> 01:19:22,810
I'll take you out for lab tests,
I'll sign you out for the whole day

760
01:19:22,895 --> 01:19:24,604
and we'll visit Madame
on the way back.

761
01:19:41,288 --> 01:19:43,414
We're going to do it.

762
01:19:45,709 --> 01:19:47,752
I thought you should know.

763
01:19:50,756 --> 01:19:52,632
You're going to apply?

764
01:19:55,386 --> 01:19:56,761
Yes.

765
01:20:02,518 --> 01:20:03,935
Good.

766
01:22:07,059 --> 01:22:08,935
Madame?

767
01:22:14,233 --> 01:22:15,650
Sorry.

768
01:22:16,527 --> 01:22:18,736
We didn't mean
to startle you.

769
01:22:19,404 --> 01:22:21,155
We were at Hailsham.

770
01:22:25,911 --> 01:22:28,246
I'm Kathy.
This is Tommy.

771
01:22:30,749 --> 01:22:33,084
We're not here to
give you any trouble.

772
01:22:36,547 --> 01:22:38,005
From Hailsham?

773
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,632
We just came
to talk to you.

774
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:43,761
And I brought you
some things.

775
01:22:44,763 --> 01:22:47,640
Some things you might
like for your Gallery.

776
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:51,394
Come inside.

777
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:28,890
Please, wait here.

778
01:23:46,992 --> 01:23:48,784
Look, it's Hailsham.

779
01:23:50,495 --> 01:23:52,663
Kathy, it's Hailsham.

780
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:57,335
That's exactly
how I remember it.

781
01:24:04,426 --> 01:24:06,052
Please, sit down.

782
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,735
So...

783
01:24:25,948 --> 01:24:27,448
We're in love.

784
01:24:28,242 --> 01:24:30,785
And it's true love.
It's verifiable.

785
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:33,871
Verifiable. I see.

786
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,420
Go on.

787
01:24:41,672 --> 01:24:43,089
Well,

788
01:24:44,758 --> 01:24:47,385
we'd heard about
the deferrals.

789
01:24:49,596 --> 01:24:52,349
And we'd worked out the
purpose of The Gallery.

790
01:24:53,726 --> 01:24:55,477
Tell me the purpose.

791
01:24:57,272 --> 01:25:00,357
To use our art
from Hailsham

792
01:25:00,566 --> 01:25:02,901
to look into
our souls,

793
01:25:03,945 --> 01:25:07,364
which would verify that
we deserved a deferral.

794
01:25:08,074 --> 01:25:11,451
But the problem is

795
01:25:11,536 --> 01:25:14,413
I was a little bit
mixed up back then

796
01:25:14,497 --> 01:25:18,709
and I didn't
really do any art,

797
01:25:20,378 --> 01:25:22,713
so you never took
anything of mine.

798
01:25:22,797 --> 01:25:26,258
I know, I know that
that is my fault

799
01:25:26,342 --> 01:25:29,553
and it is probably
much too late,

800
01:25:29,637 --> 01:25:31,638
but I brought some stuff with me today.

801
01:25:37,603 --> 01:25:40,689
This is a book
of stuff and...

802
01:25:52,785 --> 01:25:54,828
Other stuff here.

803
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:02,753
Some of them I've done
quite recently,

804
01:26:03,796 --> 01:26:05,130
and others

805
01:26:07,091 --> 01:26:09,968
were done several years ago,
so there's a real spread.

806
01:26:11,262 --> 01:26:14,556
You already have a load of
stuff from Kath already.

807
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,684
She got loads of stuff into The
Gallery over the years, didn't...

808
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:19,478
I'm sorry.

809
01:26:22,815 --> 01:26:24,775
I never know
what to do.

810
01:26:31,616 --> 01:26:33,492
I'll take it
from here.

811
01:26:39,374 --> 01:26:41,041
Thank you, George.

812
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:47,923
Kathy H and Tommy D.

813
01:26:49,675 --> 01:26:51,635
I remember you both.

814
01:26:52,178 --> 01:26:55,305
Kathy, a bright girl,
and so creative.

815
01:26:55,598 --> 01:26:58,892
And Tommy, a big heart
and terrible rages.

816
01:27:03,147 --> 01:27:04,856
You have to understand,

817
01:27:05,858 --> 01:27:10,445
Hailsham was the last place to
consider the ethics of donation.

818
01:27:10,863 --> 01:27:14,241
We used your art to show
what you were capable of.

819
01:27:14,909 --> 01:27:17,577
To show that donor children
are all but human.

820
01:27:19,414 --> 01:27:23,375
But we were providing an answer
to a question no one was asking.

821
01:27:24,961 --> 01:27:27,170
If you ask people
to return to darkness,

822
01:27:27,255 --> 01:27:31,758
the days of lung cancer,
breast cancer, motor neurone disease,

823
01:27:32,718 --> 01:27:34,594
they'll simply say no.

824
01:27:37,974 --> 01:27:41,268
We used to get two or three
couples like you a year.

825
01:27:42,895 --> 01:27:44,813
Not so much these days.

826
01:27:46,315 --> 01:27:48,817
You're the first
for quite a while.

827
01:27:52,947 --> 01:27:55,240
To apply
for a deferral?

828
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:06,084
There are
no deferrals, Tommy.

829
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:15,302
There are no deferrals.
And there never have been.

830
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:29,524
We didn't have The Gallery in
order to look into your souls.

831
01:28:29,942 --> 01:28:33,153
We had The Gallery to see
if you had souls at all.

832
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:47,876
Do you understand?

833
01:28:58,763 --> 01:29:00,138
Yes.

834
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:09,814
Your drawings
are very good.

835
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:13,652
If you want,
I'll keep them.

836
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:18,216
Thank you
for talking to us.

837
01:30:22,054 --> 01:30:23,805
You poor creatures.

838
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,559
I wish I could help you.

839
01:31:27,495 --> 01:31:30,121
Sorry, can we stop for a second?
I need to get out.

840
01:34:37,936 --> 01:34:40,521
It's been two weeks
since I lost him.

841
01:35:11,136 --> 01:35:13,345
I've been given my notice now.

842
01:35:17,183 --> 01:35:19,852
My first donation
is in a month's time.

843
01:35:28,528 --> 01:35:31,780
I come here and imagine
that this is the spot

844
01:35:31,865 --> 01:35:35,784
where everything I've lost since
my childhood has washed up.

845
01:35:39,748 --> 01:35:43,083
I tell myself
if that were true,

846
01:35:43,919 --> 01:35:46,253
and I waited long enough,

847
01:35:47,339 --> 01:35:51,216
then a tiny figure would appear
on the horizon across the field

848
01:35:51,384 --> 01:35:55,346
and gradually get larger
until I'd see it was Tommy.

849
01:35:58,391 --> 01:35:59,975
He'd wave

850
01:36:00,435 --> 01:36:02,311
and maybe call.

851
01:36:04,648 --> 01:36:07,691
I don't let the fantasy
go beyond that.

852
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:09,234
I can't let it.

853
01:36:11,363 --> 01:36:15,366
I remind myself I was lucky to
have had any time with him at all.

854
01:36:19,913 --> 01:36:22,164
What I'm not sure about

855
01:36:23,057 --> 01:36:26,313
is if our lives have been so different
from the lives of the people we save.

856
01:36:30,215 --> 01:36:32,132
We all complete.

857
01:36:34,594 --> 01:36:38,305
Maybe none of us really understand
what we've lived through

858
01:36:40,266 --> 01:36:42,810
or feel we've had
enough time.

859
01:43:05,857 --> 01:43:11,261
When we are scattered
afar and asunder

860
01:43:11,596 --> 01:43:16,795
Parted are those
who are singing today

861
01:43:17,402 --> 01:43:23,034
When we look back
and forgetfully wonder

862
01:43:23,541 --> 01:43:28,979
What we were like
in our learning and play

863
01:43:29,414 --> 01:43:34,909
Oh, the great days
will bring distance enchanted

864
01:43:35,186 --> 01:43:40,249
Days of fresh air
in the rain and the sun

865
01:43:40,792 --> 01:43:46,128
How we rejoiced
as we struggled and panted

866
01:43:46,597 --> 01:43:53,560
Echoes of dreamland
Hailsham lives on
