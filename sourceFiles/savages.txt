in business and botany.

to help out at the grow-op,

113

And it's progressive

118
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,548
because from what
I've seen, at Ieast,

119
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,842
it helps with the pain.

can't all be wrong.

121

from shipping it out of state.

Who's got the tango at my six?

1866
02:07:13,126 --> 02:07:14,209
AII right, Jesse.

1867
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:24,469
Shoot whatever
the fuck you got! Go!

1868
02:07:25,555 --> 02:07:26,555
Come on, guys!
It's raining buIIets, here.

1869
02:07:26,722 --> 02:07:27,889
What the fuck are you doing?

1870
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:29,766
Shit! Move, Sam !

1871
02:07:29,934 --> 02:07:31,059
Chief, shouId we shift?

1872
02:07:31,227 --> 02:07:33,145
Negative, stay put!

1873
02:07:41,654 --> 02:07:42,696
Go!

1874
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:44,489
Oh, fuck!

1875
02:07:47,743 --> 02:07:48,910
Smoke that motherfucker.

1876
02:07:54,375 --> 02:07:55,375
DOC: Sam, cover Ben !

1877
02:07:55,459 --> 02:07:57,752
BILLY: Move! Cover me,
cover me! HoId !

1878
02:08:03,176 --> 02:08:04,593
Move!

1879
02:08:04,802 --> 02:08:08,346
Mommy, Mommy!
I Iove you, Mommy!

1880
02:08:14,687 --> 02:08:16,021
No, no, no!

1881
02:08:17,982 --> 02:08:20,192
HeIp Magda.

1882
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:23,737
Save Magda. Save Magda.

1883
02:08:23,821 --> 02:08:24,905
Get out of here!

1884
02:08:24,989 --> 02:08:26,281
Go, come on !

1885
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:42,297
(GUN FIRES)

1886
02:09:00,149 --> 02:09:01,191
Fuck!

1887
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:25,382
Don't shoot.
PIease, OpheIia.

1888
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:28,343
I have a famiIy.

1889
02:09:28,511 --> 02:09:31,179
Three IittIe ones, you know?
PIease.

1890
02:09:50,908 --> 02:09:52,033
Ben !

1891
02:09:56,372 --> 02:09:57,706
DOC: Chief, they took off.
We're coming in.

1892
02:09:57,873 --> 02:10:00,125
HoId on.
We'II be there in 1 0 or Iess.

1893
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:02,711
Chon?

1894
02:10:04,964 --> 02:10:06,214
PIease, heIp him.

1895
02:10:11,637 --> 02:10:12,846
(BEN GASPS)

1896
02:10:16,392 --> 02:10:17,892
OPHELIA: Shh. . . It's okay.

1897
02:10:18,602 --> 02:10:19,602
It's okay.

1898
02:10:23,065 --> 02:10:24,733
He's going to die.

1899
02:10:27,069 --> 02:10:29,404
Chon,
I don't want to Ieave him.

1900
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:31,823
No.

1901
02:10:39,457 --> 02:10:40,749
(GASPS)

1902
02:10:52,928 --> 02:10:55,930
You're reaIIy
going to Iove it there.

1903
02:10:57,475 --> 02:11:00,769
Soft water.

1904
02:11:01,437 --> 02:11:03,313
Stars.

1905
02:11:03,939 --> 02:11:05,982
And the peopIe

1906
02:11:06,150 --> 02:11:08,818
smiIe. . .

1907
02:11:22,541 --> 02:11:23,875
(ALL GASPING)

1908
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:26,461
I'm coId.

1909
02:11:40,893 --> 02:11:43,728
OPHELIA: That's the way
l imagined it.

1910
02:11:44,063 --> 02:11:46,856
But the truth has
a mind of its own.

1911
02:11:54,532 --> 02:11:58,493
What really happened
was more of a fuck-up
than a shoot-out.

1912
02:11:58,953 --> 02:12:01,996
And gave us all
a second chance.

1913
02:12:32,111 --> 02:12:33,987
CHON: We said
"aIone," EIena.

1914
02:12:34,363 --> 02:12:38,616
I am one, you are two.
Let's just do
what we came to do.

1915
02:12:42,121 --> 02:12:43,371
And the snipers.

1916
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:48,751
TeII them to put
the scopes on the ground,
hands in the air.

1917
02:12:48,919 --> 02:12:51,463
Or we're back in
the jeep and we're gone.

1918
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:55,842
Get rid of them.

1919
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:03,641
ELENA: So how do you
want to do this?

1920
02:13:04,685 --> 02:13:06,186
(ENGINE STARTING)

1921
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:09,230
Adios, amiguitas.

1922
02:13:10,065 --> 02:13:11,065
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)

1923
02:13:14,778 --> 02:13:15,862
Go, go!

1924
02:13:16,363 --> 02:13:17,739
Magda!

1925
02:13:21,535 --> 02:13:24,078
OPHELIA: And oId Dennis,
who couIdn't Ieave town
with his three miI

1926
02:13:24,288 --> 02:13:27,165
had to horn in on the action.

1927
02:13:29,543 --> 02:13:30,710
Go! Go!

1928
02:13:31,337 --> 02:13:32,337
Run !

1929
02:13:35,466 --> 02:13:37,675
"La Reina" EIena!

1930
02:13:37,843 --> 02:13:39,302
We gotcha!

1931
02:13:47,436 --> 02:13:50,188
DENNIS: Today,
we have made great strides

1932
02:13:50,356 --> 02:13:53,775
to further
protect our children
and our freedoms.

1933
02:13:53,943 --> 02:13:57,070
OPHELIA: And Dennis sure
made a big shot
of himseIf on the news.

1934
02:13:57,238 --> 02:14:01,366
By dismantling the leadership
of the Baja cartel

1935
02:14:01,575 --> 02:14:03,993
and the curse of
illicit drugs in our country.

1936
02:14:04,203 --> 02:14:08,122
It is an Indian reservation.
lt is technically
not our country.

1937
02:14:08,290 --> 02:14:11,501
But, as we know, it is.
(LAUGHS) So...

1938
02:14:11,669 --> 02:14:15,630
OPHELIA: EIena took the faII
and went to prison
for 30 years.

1939
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:18,299
With EIena
out of the picture,

1940
02:14:18,384 --> 02:14:20,176
and Dennis
running interference,

1941
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:24,514
Lado and AzuI
created a new carteI.

1942
02:14:24,682 --> 02:14:26,349
The AzuIatos.

1943
02:14:27,977 --> 02:14:31,896
Ben being Ben,
he had the goods on Dennis.

1944
02:14:32,064 --> 02:14:36,150
And Dennis,
identifying Ben and Chon
as his confidentiaI informants

1945
02:14:36,318 --> 02:14:39,988
for the last six years,
took care of them.

1946
02:14:40,531 --> 02:14:42,824
But who really trusted who?

1947
02:14:43,617 --> 02:14:45,243
I have no idea.

1948
02:14:45,911 --> 02:14:48,288
Ben and Chon spent
a couple of weeks
in the sIammer

1949
02:14:48,455 --> 02:14:52,667
and then, weII, vanished.

1950
02:14:53,419 --> 02:14:54,627
Like I did.

1951
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:04,804
They say we're in Africa

1952
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:08,182
off Kenya.

1953
02:15:09,518 --> 02:15:12,937
Or some magic
isIand in Indonesia.

1954
02:15:18,777 --> 02:15:21,571
They still talk about
Ben and Chon's herb.

1955
02:15:25,909 --> 02:15:29,245
And it surfaces
every now and then
over the years.

1956
02:15:35,878 --> 02:15:38,463
These things that happened...

1957
02:15:40,299 --> 02:15:42,467
You can never go back.

1958
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:53,061
It took me a whiIe,

1959
02:15:53,771 --> 02:15:56,147
but l began to live again.

1960
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:10,536
I'm not so sure there can
ever be three people
equally in love.

1961
02:16:10,704 --> 02:16:12,538
lt just doesn't work that way.

1962
02:16:15,918 --> 02:16:19,003
l looked up
the definition of "savage."

1963
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:23,257
It means, "CrueI, crippIed.

1964
02:16:24,259 --> 02:16:28,096
"Regressed back to
a primal state of being."

1965
02:16:31,934 --> 02:16:36,145
One day, maybe,
we'II be back.

1966
02:16:42,277 --> 02:16:46,989
For now,
we live like savages.

1967
02:16:48,325 --> 02:16:50,785
Beautiful savages.
