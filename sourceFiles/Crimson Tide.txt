00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,398
This is Richard Valeriani
reporting live for CNN...

2
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,461
from the French
aircraft carrier Foch...

3
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,836
somewhere in the Mediterranean.

4
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:18,868
Six days ago,
as the rebellion in Chechnya spread
to the neighboring Caucas republics...

5
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,813
the Russian president
ordered massive bombing strikes
against rebel positions...

6
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,681
around Rutul and Belokany.

7
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:30,156
Appalled at the loss ofhuman life,
the President of the United States...

8
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,159
joined by the French president
and the British prime minister...

9
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,661
suspended all foreign aid to Russia.

10
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,994
Ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Radchenko...

11
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:42,001
denounced the U.S. Pressure
as an act of war...

12
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,095
against the Russian Republic
and Russian sovereignty.

13
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:48,039
Denouncing his own president
as a U.S. Puppet...

14
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:52,375
he called on the Russian people
to join him in revolt.

15
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,439
He said, "This brutish and
hypocritical American intervention...

16
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,415
will not go unanswered."

17
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,352
On Tuesday, at 10::00
in the morning Moscow time...

18
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:05,188
the Russian parliament was suspended
and martial law was declared.

19
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,695
With the government in crisis,
the Russian Republic...

20
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,698
was entering into what can only
be described as a state of civil war.

21
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:16,202
Then yesterday at dawn,
Radchenko and rebel forces...

22
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,534
seized the region
around Vladivostok...

23
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:24,044
including a naval base and a nuclear
missile base housing Russian ICBMs.

24
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:29,048
As regular Russian military forces
move in to encircle Radchenko...

25
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:32,574
allied military forces
are in a state ofhigh alert.

26
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,315
These French planes
taking off behind me...

27
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,619
have been deployed near the Caucasus
since the beginning of the crisis.

28
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,388
And the crisis which started
in the Caucasus...

29
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,623
has now spread to the Far East...

30
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:49,226
and appears to be turning into the worst
standoff since the Cuban missile crisis.

31
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:52,568
This is Richard Valeriani
reporting live for CNN...

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,576
from the French aircraft carrier Foch,
somewhere in the Mediterranean.

33
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:06,276
- Abracadabra!
- I-I-I-I can't hear you.

34
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,754
Abracadabra!

35
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,155
- Ooh!
- Oh, he shot fire!

36
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,025
- I need a volunteer...
- Me! Me!
- From the audience.

37
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,598
- Uh, uh, me, me, me, me, me!
- Me! Me! Me!

38
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,362
A brave volunteer.

39
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,595
Me! Me!

40
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:27,505
Preferably... Preferably
somebody who was born...

41
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:33,046
- on October 18,
- Me! Me! Me!
- Nineteen hundred and ninety.

42
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:35,377
- That's you, honey. That's you.
- Me! Me!

43
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,110
- Me!
- Over here? Over here?

44
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:43,316
- Ahh, you must be the birthday girl.
What's your name?
- Robin.

45
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,019
- Russian ultranationalist leader,
backed by his rebel army...
- Stand up here on the chair.

46
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:51,393
- Threatened nuclear attack
on the United States and Japan.
- And turn around.

47
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,399
The threats come as a response
to the United States'
involvement in Chechnya...

48
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,299
and are not considered idle.

49
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:02,809
Now, sit on the board and tell me,
Robin, do you believe in magic? Good.

50
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,140
- Because if you believe in magic...
- Where'd he go?
- I'll get him. I'll get him.

51
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,203
- We can suspend you in the air...
- Be right back.

52
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,976
- Without the help of a flying carpet.
- Meeting in an emergency session...

53
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,574
- Come on. You'll miss
your daughter's levitation.
- While the President is sequestered...

54
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,552
with theJoint Chiefs of Staff.

55
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,150
That footage was taken yesterday,
but half an hour ago...

56
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,494
surrounded by hostile forces,
rebel leader Vladimir Radchenko...

57
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,034
- threatened to use nuclear arms...
- Maybe it's not as bad as it looks.

58
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,161
On the United States and Japan...

59
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,434
should anyone, including the Russian
Army, attempt to move in on him.

60
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:41,105
Based on the history of this man,
this cannot be viewed as an idle threat.

61
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,548
- Sander Vanocur is standing by...
- It is.

62
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,921
Commander Hunter.

63
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,318
Annapolis.
Five patrols on fast attacks.

64
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:28,054
Two on boomers: One as X.O.

65
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,725
Hmm. Ayear at...

66
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,502
Excuse me. Harvard.

67
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,639
I talked to your former C.O.
He tells me he tried to adopt you.

68
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:53,515
As you no doubt heard,
my X.O. Has appendicitis.

69
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,815
He's the best I ever had.

70
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,323
I need a good man
to fill his spot.

71
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:02,521
- Your name was at the top of the list.
- Well, that's good to know, sir.

72
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,360
It was a short list.

73
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,695
Your interests, Mr. Hunter.
What do you like to do? Do you, uh...

74
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:16,708
Do you paint, play ball, play an
instrument, ride motorcycles? Wh-What?

75
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,302
- Ride horses.
- Horses.

76
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,248
- What's the best horse you ever rode?
- Arabian, sir.

77
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,875
An Arabian?
Now, that's a powerful animal.

78
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,318
Yes.

79
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,756
- You ever ridden one?
- Who, me? Are you kidding?

80
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,590
Nah, I couldn't handle an Arabian.
Yeah, just give me an old paint.

81
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,395
Yeah, horses are
fascinating animals.

82
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,097
Dumb as fence posts
but very intuitive.

83
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,038
In that way, they're not too different
from high school girls.

84
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,771
They might not have a brain
in their head, but they do know
all the boys want to fuck 'em.

85
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,680
You don't have to be able
to read Ulysses to know
where they're comin' from.

86
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,685
No, sir.

87
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,257
He approves of you.

88
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,126
Jack Russells.
Smartest dogs alive.

89
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,689
Name's Bear.
Goes every place with me.

90
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,276
Well, welcome aboard
the Alabama, son.

91
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,938
- Do me proud.
- I will, sir.

92
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,709
- Congratulations, Mr. Hunter.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:35,412
If one Russian citizen is killed,
and I am president...

94
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:40,984
then I will kill 900,000
of the people who are responsible.

95
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,562
- You'd use nuclear weapons?
- Yes, I would hit them...

96
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,064
- Attention!
- With nuclear weapons.

97
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,465
- At ease. Be seated.
- Sir, such talk is highly inflammatory.

98
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,232
My dear young lady,
I do not engage in "talk."

99
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:56,436
These are serious threats which I hope
to be in the position to carry out.

100
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,238
I take it you've seen enough?

101
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:04,273
Gentlemen, after a nice little vacation,
looks like we're back at it again.

102
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,651
I hope you enjoyed the peace, because
as of now, we're back in business.

103
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,918
In the good old days
of the Cold War, the Russians
could always be depended on...

104
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,756
doing whatever was
in their own best interest.

105
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,194
But this Radchenko's playing
a whole new ball game...

106
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,595
with a whole new set of rules.

107
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,601
Now, I've heard people talk,
but I don't think this man's talking...

108
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,762
just to get his picture
in the paper.

109
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,365
He seems to have a serious weed
up his ass and a legitimate gripe.

110
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,306
Always a dangerous combination.

111
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,677
And I think he's capable of doing every
damn thing he says he's going to do.

112
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:39,616
That's why we have to go out there
and give the man a moment of pause.

113
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,782
So ends theory.
Thus, let us begin the facts.

114
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:48,658
We've been informed by the NSA
that an entire rebel corps
of the Russian Army is involved.

115
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:52,062
That's four armored divisions
numbering 60,000 men.

116
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,065
There seems to be
massive defections.

117
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:58,228
Vladimir appears to be
winning the hearts and minds
of the Russian soldiers.

118
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,363
Admiral?

119
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,374
Thank you.

120
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:11,306
They've seized the region by
the Chinese and North Korea borders.

121
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,683
That includes a submarine base...

122
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,655
from which they've surged
four Akula-class attack subs.

123
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,386
They have acquired
a nuclear base at Artem...

124
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:24,931
that houses 25 hardened silos
for Russian ICBMs...

125
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,763
armed with up to
ten warheads apiece.

126
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,770
Now, the Russian government has
assured us that talks are under way.

127
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,363
They claim
that Radchenko forces...

128
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,500
do not possess the launch codes.

129
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,772
But if Radchenko
were to crack them...

130
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,347
they could launch against
our west coast direct...

131
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,715
or come in over the Pole,
take out Washington and New York.

132
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,882
The Commander-in-Chief has directed
U.S. Military forces...

133
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,949
to set DEFCON four.

134
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,688
We've been ordered to get
under way at 0600 hours...

135
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:00,096
to assume alert coverage, mid-Pacific,
the Far Eastern TVD target package.

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,432
Please keep your men informed.
Lieutenant Commander Hunter
is our new X.O.

137
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:08,872
Please bring him up to speed on
ship's personnel and supplies. Admiral?

138
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,469
- No, that's it.
- On your feet.

139
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,277
- Holy shit.
- Wow.

140
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,618
- Here we go again, Commander.
- Thank you.

141
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:27,421
You bet. Hey, Bobby.
This is Bobby Dougherty, Supplies.

142
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,985
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Mr. Dougherty.
- Billy Linkletter, TSO.

143
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,724
- Hey.
- Mr. Linkletter.
- Commander.

144
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,925
- And, uh, you know Darik.
- Yes. Westergaurd.

145
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,060
- Hey.
- Long time no see.
- Yeah. How's Julia?
- She's excellent.

146
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,570
- Good.
- And, uh, Roy Zimmer, Communications.

147
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,903
- Mr. Zimmer.
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

148
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,432
- Uh, we served together
on the Baton Rouge.
- Twice.

149
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,675
That's right.
And, uh, we're lucky to have him.

150
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,410
I think his dog gave me
the final seal of approval.

151
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,680
He's crazy about that dog.
Takes him everywhere.

152
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,448
The Navy looks the other way
'cause he's Ramsey.

153
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,752
The Navy looks the other way 'cause
he's one of the few skippers left...

154
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,260
- who've actually seen some combat.
- Hey, he took SEALS into Panama in '89.

155
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,820
- Tomahawks in the Gulf in '91.
- Took out what? Eight or nine
X.O. S in '94?

156
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,866
- Ouch.
- Last one caught...
What was it? Appendicitis?

157
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:08,866
Yeah, right.

158
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,773
The Enemy Below.

159
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,244
- Robert Mitchum.
- And?

160
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,941
- And what? Robert Mitchum.
- Incomplete answer.

161
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,780
- What, the German guy
with the white hair?
- Yeah. What's his name?

162
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,912
- Who was it?
- Curt Jurgens.
- No.

163
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,250
Right over there!

164
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,461
Bye-bye. I love you!

165
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:44,263
- Hardy Kruger.
- No way.

166
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,532
Robert Shaw in his Nazi period.

167
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,767
Question is invalid.
We're even.

168
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,938
- How you doin'?
- Hi. I'm fine. Thanks.
- Good.

169
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:58,951
Address me as "sir" when you speak
to me! Stand at attention, sailor!

170
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:03,513
- Is he gonna fit in the sub?
- Doubtful.

171
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,183
Who played the German sub commander
in The Enemy Below with Robert Mitchum?

172
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,558
- Was it CurtJurgens or Hardy Kruger?
- Sir?

173
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,564
Wrong answer!
Drop down and give me 20! Now!

174
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,830
- Move! Move!
- One. Two.

175
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,031
- Run Silent, Run Deep.
- Three.

176
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,506
- The guy with the ears...
- Four.
- And the little moustache.

177
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,305
- Five.
- Cary Grant.

178
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,471
I'm worried about T.

179
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,654
- Why?
- She doesn't know what's goin' on.

180
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,316
I think she thinks
I'm goin' away forever.

181
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,153
I'll take care of her.

182
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,356
- You will?
- Yeah.
- You promise?

183
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,365
I promise.

184
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,662
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, son.

185
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,268
Okay. Um.

186
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,944
- You know I don't know what to say.
- Just say good-bye.

187
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,690
See you in my dreams.

188
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,196
Give me a kiss.

189
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,433
Mmm.

190
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,652
- Davis.
- How you doin', sir?

191
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,004
Crew present
and accounted for, sir!

192
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,250
Little ducks...

193
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,352
there's trouble in Russia.

194
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,589
So they called us.

195
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,459
And we're going over there...

196
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,861
and bringing the most lethal
killing machine ever devised.

197
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,367
We're capable of launching
more firepower...

198
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,271
than has ever been released
in the history of war.

199
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,610
For one purpose alone:

200
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,310
To keep our country safe.

201
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:47,844
We constitute the front line...

202
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,354
and the last line of defense.

203
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,798
I expect and demand...

204
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,799
your very best.

205
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:06,403
Anything less, you should have
joined the Air Force.

206
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,840
This might be our
Commander-in-Chief's Navy...

207
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,179
but this is my boat.

208
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,481
And all I ask is that
you keep up with me.

209
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,488
And if you can't...

210
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:27,219
that strange sensation you'll be
feeling in the seat of your pants...

211
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,022
will be my boot in your ass!

212
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,572
- Mr. Cob?
- Yes, sir!

213
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,878
You're aware of the name
of this ship, aren't you, Mr. Cob?

214
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,943
Very aware, sir!

215
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,854
- It bears a proud name,
doesn't it, Mr. Cob?
- Very proud, sir!

216
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,792
- It represents fine people.
- Very fine people, sir!

217
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:05,820
- Who live in a fine, outstanding state.
- Outstanding, sir!

218
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,333
In the greatest country
in the entire world.

219
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,892
In the entire world, sir!

220
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,701
- And what is that name, Mr. Cob?
- Alabama, sir!

221
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,504
- And what do we say? Go, 'Bama.!
- Go, 'Bama.!

222
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,272
Roll tide!

223
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,041
Chief of the boat,
dismiss the crew.

224
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,174
Dismiss the crew.
Aye, aye, sir!

225
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,688
Crew! Department heads!
Attend to your departments!

226
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,690
Fall out!

227
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,386
Here.

228
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,752
Part of your qualification
for command.

229
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,590
Ahh.

230
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,722
My last breath of polluted air
for the next 65 days.

231
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,394
Gonna miss it.
I don't trust air I can't see.

232
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:32,273
This is my favorite part.
Right here, right now.

233
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,696
Bravo, Hunter.

234
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,496
Sir?

235
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,537
You knew to shut up
and enjoy the view.

236
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,006
Most eggheads want to
talk it away.

237
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,169
Your stock just went up
a couple of points.

238
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,110
Thank you, sir.

239
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,979
Allow me to give you
a tiny bit of advice.

240
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,143
If you want your own boat
some day...

241
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:11,054
the very worst thing you can do is worry
about yourself or try to impress me.

242
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,888
I can't stand save-asses,
and I won't abide kiss-asses.

243
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:19,328
You keep your priorities straight:
Your mission and your men.

244
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,896
How do you like that cigar?

245
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:32,308
- It's good, sir.
- It's your first.
- Yeah.

246
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,142
Don't like it too much.
They're more expensive than drugs.

247
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,847
- X.O., take her down.
- Take her down. Aye, sir.

248
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,253
Control/Bridge: Sounding.

249
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,985
Bridge/Control: :
Sounding 130 fathoms.

250
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,535
- Lookouts, clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge. Aye, sir.

251
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,071
Officer of the deck,
prepare to dive.

252
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,504
- Captain's down.
- Captain is down.

253
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,548
- X.O. Down.
- X.O. Is down.

254
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,530
- Submerge the ship.
- Diving Officer, submerge the ship.

255
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:29,364
- Make your depth 150 feet.
- Make my depth 150 feet. Aye, sir.

256
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,371
Chief of the watch,
on the 1 MC, dive, dive!

257
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,654
Make your depth 150 feet.

258
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,888
Five degree down bubble.

259
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,471
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

260
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,772
Radchenko is a fanatic, okay?
He's a potential Hitler.

261
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:48,143
- Somebody should just
step up and shoot him.
- I have no problem with that.

262
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,682
- Good.
- Well, it's fanatics who make history.

263
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,115
- Hell, Patton was a fanatic.
- It's what made him great.

264
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:55,450
You think this guy is Patton?

265
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,649
He's a dangerous lunatic and
he's threatening nuclear war,
and he means it.

266
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,888
What's that make us,
since we're the only nation
to ever drop a nuclear bomb on anyone?

267
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,963
It makes us a prime target.

268
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,464
I mean, there's half a dozen other
Third World countries with atom bombs...

269
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,467
- who'd love to drop one on us.
- That's right. That's why
we should drop one on them.

270
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:13,471
What are you, a communist?
You have a problem with us
dropping nuclear bombs on Japan?

271
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,337
Shut up, Dougherty.

272
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,503
- You think it was a mistake, Mr. Hunter?
- Sir?

273
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,241
Using the bomb
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

274
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,319
Well, if I thought that, sir,
I wouldn't be here.

275
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,689
- Interesting way you put that.
- How'd I put it, sir?

276
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,824
Very carefully.

277
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,898
You do qualify your remarks.

278
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,163
If somebody asked me
if we should have bombed Japan...

279
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:49,334
a simple "Yes, by all means,
sir, drop that fucker. Twice."

280
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:54,344
I don't mean to suggest
that you're indecisive, Mr. Hunter.

281
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,507
Not at all.

282
00:21:56,582 --> 00:22:00,484
Just, um, complicated.

283
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,849
Of course, that's the way
the Navy wants you.

284
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:09,054
Me, they wanted simple.

285
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,359
Well, you certainly
fooled them, sir.

286
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,626
Be careful there, Mr. Hunter.

287
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:19,193
It's all I got to rely on:
Bein' a simpleminded son of a bitch.

288
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:23,404
Rickover gave me
my command, a checklist...

289
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,910
a target and a button to push.

290
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,708
All I had to know is how to push it.
They'd tell me when.

291
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:32,615
They seem to want you to know why.

292
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,619
I would hope they'd want us
all to know why, sir.

293
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:43,726
At the Naval War College,
it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors,
not 19th-century philosophy.

294
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:49,056
"War is a continuation
of politics by other means."

295
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:52,730
Von Clausewitz.

296
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:56,070
I think, uh, sir, that
what he was actually trying
to say was a little more...

297
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:59,509
Complicated?

298
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:06,649
Y-Yes, the purpose of war is,
is to serve a political end...

299
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:10,849
- but the true nature of war
is to serve itself.
- I'm very impressed.

300
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:14,919
In other words, the sailor
most likely to win the war...

301
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,519
is the one most willing to part
company with the politicians...

302
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,996
and ignore everything except
the destruction of the enemy.

303
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,193
- Uh, you'd agree with that?
- Well...

304
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:25,998
I'd agree that, uh...

305
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:29,040
that's what Clausewitz
was trying to say.

306
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,940
- But you wouldn't agree with it?
- No, sir, I do not.

307
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:34,639
No, l-I just think
that in the nuclear world...

308
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,714
the true enemy can't be destroyed.

309
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:50,026
Attention on deck.
Von Clausewitz will now tell us
exactly who the real enemy is.

310
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:54,130
Von?

311
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,833
In my humble opinion...

312
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:05,400
in the nuclear world,
the true enemy is war itself.

313
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,319
Everywhere I go
your face I see

314
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,361
Every step I take

315
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,329
You take with me

316
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:28,993
- Nowhere to run to, baby
- Nowhere to run, baby

317
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,504
Nowhere to hide

318
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:36,406
Got nowhere to run, baby

319
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,603
Nowhere to hide

320
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,204
I know you're no good for me

321
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:47,378
But free of you
I'll never be, baby

322
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:01,366
- Look out!
- Move!

323
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,698
Move it, move it, move it!

324
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:16,603
Fire in the galley!
Fire in the galley! Chief of
the watch, sound the general alarm!

325
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,234
Forward damage control, bring
additional fire extinguishers to the...

326
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,836
- Fire's out of control. He's hurtin'.
- You hit the kill switch?

327
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,847
Couldn't get to it.
Too hot.

328
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,934
Attention, all hands.
The fire has been contained.

329
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:16,941
Damage control party,
assess damage and report to Control.

330
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,308
- Initiate weapons system readiness test.
- Aye, sir.

331
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:28,047
All right, station a reflash watch.
This thing could flare back up again.

332
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,959
Conn/Radio: We are receiving
flash traffic emergency action message.

333
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,899
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.

334
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:46,961
Alert one, alert one.
Man battle stations missile for
weapons systems readiness test.

335
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,974
- Spin up all missiles.
- What the hell is he runnin'
a missile drill now for?

336
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,634
- You're in charge.
- Aye, sir.

337
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,578
Man battle stations missiles
for weapons system readiness test.

338
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,308
Spin up all missiles.
This is an exercise.

339
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,319
Captain's in Control!

340
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,820
I agree. The message
is properly formatted.

341
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,762
Sir, we have a properly
formatted emergency action message...

342
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,833
for weapons system
readiness test, sir.

343
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,993
- I concur, sir.
- Where's the X.O.?

344
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,200
- Sir.
- Good of you to make it, Mr. Hunter.

345
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:27,177
- Get the authenticator.
- Get the authenticator.

346
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:41,526
Let's go.

347
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,033
Sir, request permission
to authenticate.

348
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,535
Permission granted.
Authenticate.

349
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:59,434
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo, Echo,
Charlie, Zulu, Tango."

350
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:04,312
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo, Echo,
Charlie, Zulu, Tango."

351
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,544
- Captain, message is authentic.
- I concur, sir.

352
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,383
- I agree.
- Message is authentic.

353
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,889
Sir, your captain's missile key.

354
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:23,000
Set condition 1 SQ for WSRT. This is
the captain. This is an exercise.

355
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,833
Set condition 1 SQ for WSRT.
This is the X.O. This is an exercise.

356
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,803
- Captain, that fire
in the galley could still flare...
- Now is not the time.

357
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,573
Make your depth 150 feet.
All stop.

358
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:37,673
Make my depth 150 feet.
All stop. Aye, sir.

359
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,944
Weapons/Conn:
Simulate pressurizing, all tubes.

360
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,988
Weapons/Conn:
Simulate pressurizing, all tubes.

361
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:46,525
Conn/Weapons: : Simulate pressurizing,
all missiles. Aye, aye, sir.

362
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,822
- Simulate pressurizing, all missiles.
- Simulate pressurizing,
all missiles. Aye.

363
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:58,270
All stations, proceed to 1 SQ.
Ready all missiles for launch.

364
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,271
Come on, guys. Let's go!

365
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,039
Weapons/Captain: Report
approximate time for 1 SQ.

366
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:10,639
Captain/Weapons: Approximate
time to weapons system 1 SQ:

367
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,877
Fourteen minutes, sir.

368
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,954
Ship is at launch depth.
Ready to hover, sir.

369
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,489
- Very well. Commence hovering.
- Commence hovering. Aye, sir.

370
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:23,153
Control/Sick Bay: Chief Petty Officer
Marichek is undergoing cardiac arrest.

371
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:27,165
- We're beginning CPR.
- Chief of the watch, on the 1 MC.

372
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,292
Gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?

373
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,462
We've received word that one
of our shipmates is experiencing
a medical problem.

374
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:36,736
We're terminating the drill. Mr.
Mahoney, take the conn. I'm going below.

375
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,572
- X.O.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

376
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,478
Clear.

377
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,851
Clear.

378
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,703
It's okay, Chief.

379
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:10,170
Thank you, sir. Sorry, sir.

380
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,194
Hiya, boy. Hiya, hiya, hiya.

381
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,398
How ya doin'? Oh, boy. Yeah.

382
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:48,308
So, Mr. Hunter, do you think
I was wrong to run that drill?

383
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:51,247
- Not necessarily, sir.
- Do you think I got that man killed?

384
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:56,653
No, sir. One thing had nothing to do
with the other. It was an accident.

385
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,223
- Would you have run the drill?
- No, sir, I wouldn't have.

386
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,418
Why not?

387
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,428
The fire in the galley could
have flared back up. I would
have seen to it first, sir.

388
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,397
I'm sure you would have.

389
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:12,096
Me, on the other hand,
I tend to think that that's
the best time to run a drill.

390
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:14,230
Confusion on the ship
is nothing to fear.

391
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:18,105
It should be taken
advantage of.

392
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:22,273
Lest you forget, Mr. Hunter, we are
a ship of war, designed for battle.

393
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:25,249
You don't just fight battles
when everything is hunky-dory.

394
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,151
What'd you think, son?
I was just some crazy old coot...

395
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:32,986
putting everyone in harm's way
as I yelled "yee-haw"?

396
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,925
That was not
my first thought, sir.

397
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:39,795
But there's no excuse. At the time
I was fighting the fire in the galley...

398
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,595
I did not agree
with your call, sir.

399
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,305
Take a seat.

400
00:31:57,683 --> 00:32:01,278
Just so we understand
each other...

401
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,379
I don't have any problems
with questions or doubts.

402
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,722
As I said to you before, I'm not
seeking the company of kiss-asses.

403
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,819
When you got something to say to me,
you say it in private.

404
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:15,230
And if privacy doesn't permit itself,
then you bite your fucking tongue.

405
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,664
- Are we clear about that, Commander?
- As a bell, sir.

406
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,373
Those sailors out there
are just boys...

407
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,001
boys who are training to do
a terrible and unthinkable thing.

408
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,309
And if that ever occurs,
the only reassurance they'll have...

409
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,645
that they're doing
the proper thing...

410
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:35,175
is gonna derive from their unqualified
belief in the unified chain of command.

411
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:39,918
That means we don't question each
other's motives in front of the crew.

412
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,516
It means we don't
undermine each other.

413
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,653
It means in a missile drill...

414
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,257
they hear your voice
right after mine, without hesitation.

415
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,098
- Do you agree with that policy, sailor?
- Absolutely, sir.

416
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:59,603
We're here to preserve democracy,
not to practice it.

417
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:06,612
There'll be a memorial service in
the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.

418
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,017
- Go see to it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

419
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,284
Oh, Hunter.

420
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,359
Short of the outbreak
of World War III...

421
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:18,692
the ship sinking or being
attacked by a giant octopus...

422
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:23,463
- I'd like to be undisturbed
for the next 30 minutes.
- I'll see to it, sir.

423
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:27,164
By the way, it was Marichek's
300 pounds that killed him.

424
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,376
Not the fire.

425
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,614
Dismissed.

426
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,228
One, two, three, four.

427
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,834
Jab. Jab.

428
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,407
One, two. One, two.

429
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:23,319
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

430
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,421
Does it make any sense to you to start
a drill in the middle of a fire?

431
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,264
- Fire was out, wasn't it?
- Yeah, and a man died too.

432
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:34,203
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- What?

433
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:39,334
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- Weps.

434
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:44,041
A fire is a serious threat to the ship.
Now, where was he?
Why didn't he check it out first, huh?

435
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,811
That's his style.
He's a hard-ass.

436
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,718
- So what?
- So you wanna fight him, go ahead.

437
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,552
You wanna get along, you gotta get
to understand him a little bit.

438
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,956
Two schools of thought here.

439
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:57,393
To him, you're Annapolis,
Harvard...

440
00:34:57,496 --> 00:35:01,057
- expert on theory,
well-versed in world affairs.
- Ha!

441
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,294
He's had his head up his ass
drivin' ships for the last 25 years.

442
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,633
He's probably a little
paranoid about that.

443
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,469
I mean, Navy's all he's got.

444
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,066
Navy and that little
rat-dog of his.

445
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:14,145
That's why his wife left him.

446
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,739
So what are you saying?

447
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,910
I'm just sayin' watch out,
give him a little room.

448
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,419
Let him get to know you.

449
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:27,816
You do pants too?

450
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,074
Conn/Radio: Receiving
emergency action message.

451
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:45,872
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.

452
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:49,971
Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming emergency action message!

453
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:53,074
Alert one. Alert one.
Incoming EAM.

454
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,387
Captain.

455
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:13,230
Captain has asked me
to brief you on the emergency
action message we just received.

456
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,670
As you know,
before we got under way...

457
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,735
the Russian Army was in position
and circling the rebel camps...

458
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:26,409
and Radchenko started making extravagant
threats should anyone move in on him...

459
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:31,923
that he would launch his
land-based nuclear weapons at
the United States and atJapan.

460
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,791
The only safeguard was
that the Russian government
controlled the launch codes.

461
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:41,424
Intel now indicates that those
launch codes have been compromised.

462
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,163
And U.S. Military forces
have been directed to set DEFCON three.

463
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,637
The last time we hit this state of
emergency was 32-and-a-half years ago...

464
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,108
during the Cuban missile crisis.

465
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:54,805
So this is what it's all about,
gentlemen. It's what we've trained for.

466
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,974
Captain.

467
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:03,453
The NCA has determined that...

468
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:08,482
should our satellites detect
rebel missiles being fueled...

469
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,291
which means they could be
launched in just over one hour...

470
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,298
we'll be compelled to act.

471
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:21,472
Now, given our patrol sector
here in the Emperor Sea Mounts...

472
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,306
it seems clear that
our friends in the Pentagon...

473
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:28,642
are setting us up for
a potential preemptive strike.

474
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,816
It's important to remain focused.

475
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:37,481
Keep your men informed.

476
00:37:41,193 --> 00:37:43,093
Any questions?

477
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,359
Dismissed.

478
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,670
We lost that frying unit,
and then, uh, we...

479
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:00,712
we can't get the same capacity
in here any more.

480
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,511
- I'm gonna fuck you up!
- Get out! Get...

481
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:12,284
- Get out of here, man! Get him out!
- Motherfucker!

482
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,291
- Fuckin' dirty piece of shit!
- Bennefield, you crazy, man?

483
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,452
- Whoa.
- All right.

484
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,921
- Rivetti, what's up?
- I'm sorry, sir.

485
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:24,196
- It's just a difference
of opinion that got out of hand.
- What about?

486
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,635
It's really too silly to talk about,
sir. I'd rather just forget about...

487
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:30,936
I don't give a damn about
what you'd rather forget about.
Why were you two fighting?

488
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:34,479
Well, I said that the Kirby
Silver Surfer was the only
real Silver Surfer...

489
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,706
and that the Moebius
Silver Surfer was shit.

490
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,376
And Bennefield's
a big Moebius fan, and, uh...

491
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:42,249
things got out of hand.
I pushed him: He pushed me.

492
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:46,280
- I lost my head, sir. I'm sorry.
- Rivetti, you're a supervisor.

493
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,791
You can get a commission
like that.

494
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:51,556
I know it, sir.
You're 100 percent right.

495
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,258
- Uh, it'll never happen again,
all right?
- It better not happen again.

496
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,894
I see this kind of nonsense,
I'm gonna write you up. You
understand? Do you understand?

497
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:01,063
- Yes, sir.
- You have to set an example
even in the face of stupidity.

498
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:05,405
Everybody that reads comic books
knows that Kirby's Silver Surfer
is the only true Silver Surfer.

499
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,741
- Now, am I right or wrong?
- Y... You're right, sir.

500
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:10,077
- All right. Get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

501
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,752
- Captain.
- How can I help you?

502
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,765
Test results
from the missile drill.

503
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,297
- This the best they can do?
- No, sir, but that's what they did.

504
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:41,369
- I want this down to
five minutes. Train on it.
- Yes, sir.

505
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,314
You tell your buddy Weps
we're gonna do it again.

506
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:48,945
We're gonna keep on doing it
until he gets it right. Damn.

507
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:54,685
Feels like the whole crew
needs a kick in the ass.

508
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,193
Or a pat on the back, sir.

509
00:39:57,295 --> 00:40:00,526
I just witnessed a fight
down in crew's mess. No big deal, but...

510
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:03,499
I think the men are...

511
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,832
a little on edge with
all we're going through.

512
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,134
Morale seems to be a bit low.

513
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:14,673
Well, you seem to have
the pulse of the men.

514
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,215
Thank you, sir.

515
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:32,661
- May I have your attention, please?
- Summer's here and the time is right

516
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:36,258
- Mr. Hunter has brought it
to my attention...
- For dancin'in the streets

517
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:40,668
that morale may be a bit low...

518
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:43,503
that you may be a bit...

519
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:46,874
- On edge, sir.
- On edge.

520
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,212
So I suggest this:

521
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:55,049
Any crew member who feels
he can't handle this situation...

522
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,419
can leave the ship right now.

523
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:02,687
Gentlemen, we're at DEFCON three.
War is imminent.

524
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,453
This is the captain.

525
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,432
That is all.

526
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,204
Very inspiring, sir.

527
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,209
Come on, Bear. Come on. Come on.

528
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:37,892
Supe? Come here.

529
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,231
You hear that?

530
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:47,829
I've got a broadband contact
bearing 047.

531
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,100
Assigning tracker sierra in ATF.

532
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:54,737
Conn/Sonar: We have a possible
submerged submarine bearing 047.

533
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,906
Designate contact: Master 28.

534
00:41:56,982 --> 00:42:00,782
Sonar/Conn: Aye. Man battle
stations torpedo. Rig for ultra-quiet.

535
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,319
Rig tubes one and four
fully ready.

536
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,411
Rig tubes one and four
fully ready. Aye, sir.

537
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,325
Man battle stations torpedo.

538
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,692
- All right, what do you got?
- Sir, we have a possible
submerged submarine...

539
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:20,293
bearing 049,
designate master 28.

540
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,475
Best step for evasion,
sir, is 831 feet...

541
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:27,034
to avoid that sub.

542
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,635
Lieutenant Mahoney,
this is the captain.

543
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,774
Increase your speed to standard.
Come left to course 270.

544
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:36,150
Make your depth 831 feet, smartly.

545
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:40,788
- You find out who that is.
- Aye, sir.

546
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,522
Who are you, sweetheart?

547
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,119
Helm, all ahead standard.

548
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,655
- Dive, make your depth
831 feet, smartly.
- Aye, sir.

549
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,676
Conn/Radio: Receiving
emergency action message.

550
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,578
- Recommend alert one!
Recommend alert one!
- Recommend alert one.

551
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:06,651
Alert one, alert one.
Incoming emergency action message.

552
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,723
Captain, we have a properly
formatted emergency action message...

553
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,322
from National Command Authority
for strategic missile launch, Captain.

554
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,096
- I concur, sir.
- Get the authenticator.

555
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:49,383
Chief of the watch,
secure for battle stations torpedo.

556
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,362
Man battle stations missile
for strategic launch.

557
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,196
Secure for battle stations torpedo.
Man battle stations missile...

558
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,065
- Sir, request permission
to authenticate.
- Permission granted. Authenticate.

559
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,910
"Bravo, Echo, Echo,

560
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,709

561
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,410
"Bravo, Echo, Echo,

562
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:17,717

563
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,455

564
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,723
I concur, sir.

565
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:27,731
Message is authentic.

566
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:29,767
Sir, your captain's missile key.

567
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:44,838
This is the captain. Set condition 1 SQ
for strategic missile launch.

568
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:48,612
Spin up missiles 1-5 and 20-24.

569
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:51,679
The release of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

570
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,856
This is not a drill.

571
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:03,528
X.O., take the conn. I'm going
to my stateroom for the launch keys.

572
00:45:03,635 --> 00:45:05,762
X.O. Has the conn.

573
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:15,206
Set condition 1 SQ
for strategic missile launch.

574
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,339
Spin up missiles 1-5, 20-24.

575
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,144
The release of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

576
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,279
This is the X.O.

577
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:29,486
Conn/Weapons: Estimated time to 1 SQ
for strategic launch is 14 minutes, sir.

578
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:43,330
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

579
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,342
Go, sailor, go.

580
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,044
Set condition 1 SQ
for strategic missile launch.

581
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:57,713
- Comin' through!
- Spin up missiles 1-5 and 20-24.

582
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,668
- I have the conn.
- The captain has the conn.

583
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,670
Passing 550 feet.

584
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:25,008
Conn/Radio: Sir, we're out of VLF radio
range. Full message capacity is cut off.

585
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:28,109
Radio/Conn: Extend extremely
low frequency antenna.

586
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,949
Passing 600 feet.
Coming to 831 feet, sir.

587
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,396
Oh, Jesus.

588
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:47,962
Oh, God, uh... Conn/Sonar: Uh, sir,
we have his classification.

589
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,633
Mark that tape.
Get the classification on your monitor.

590
00:46:52,744 --> 00:46:55,372
- Rivetti, what the hell is going on?
- Sir, the master 28...

591
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:58,210
is classified as a Russian
Akula-class hunter-killer.

592
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:02,219
Bearing 196, sir! He's close,
but I don't think he's spotted us.

593
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:09,817
- Stay on him!
- Aye, sir.

594
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:14,058
- Captain has the conn.
- Passing 800 feet, sir.

595
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:16,965
Continue to dive.
Give me five degree down bubble.

596
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:19,935
- Continue rigging for ultra-quiet.
- Aye, aye, sir.

597
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,440
Five degree down bubble.
Rigging for ultra-quiet, sir.

598
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,754
Gentlemen, this is the captain.

599
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:44,624
We have an Akula-class
submarine out there.

600
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:49,099
We know that Radchenko controls
at least four submarines.
This could be one of them.

601
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,864
Russian rebels have threatened
a launch against our country...

602
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:54,666
and are fueling right now.

603
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:58,799
They will have launch
capability in 60 minutes.

604
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:03,644
We also have orders to launch
our missiles, which is exactly
what we're going to do.

605
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:07,651
We are rigging for ultra-quiet.
All hands be ready.

606
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:10,119
This is as real as it gets.

607
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:14,124
We'll presume nothing,
defend ourselves at all cost.

608
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:17,684
If that sub so much as comes
around or opens up a tube door,
we're gonna take her out.

609
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,327
Passing 900 feet.

610
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:37,076
- He's gone.
- Like hell he is. He's up there.

611
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,876
950.

612
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:42,885
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in 11 minutes.

613
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:58,734
Conn/Radio: Receiving transmission on
extremely low frequency receiver, sir.

614
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:01,828
Very well. Mr. Hunter,
go to Radio, please.

615
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,839
- Okay, pull up the code.
- What do you got?

616
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,936
X.O., incoming EAM
on the broadcast...

617
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:12,244
but we're too deep to receive
any radio communication, sir.

618
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,853
- Captain.
- X.O.

619
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:23,451
We got a limited radio transmission
indicating an incoming EAM.

620
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:28,362
- We need to go shallow
to reestablish communications.
- With that sub still up there?

621
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:31,027
Mr. Hunter, it's my inten...

622
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,093
- Come up to the conn, Mr. Hunter.
- Yes, sir.

623
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,975
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble. Aye, sir. 1,275 feet, sir.

624
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:49,617
Conn/Weapons: : Missile systems
ready to launch in 10 minutes.

625
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:53,082
- Sir.
- Attention, all hands.

626
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,648
- Ship has been rigged for ultra-quiet.
- Captain?

627
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:07,732
When our missile system is ready,
Mr. Hunter, it is my intention...

628
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:11,935
to rise to launch depth,
launch our birds and then
get the hell out of there.

629
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,740
Not until then.

630
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:18,509
- I can't jeopardize
the safety of this ship.
- Yes, sir.

631
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:24,319
May I suggest that we float the buoy,
sir? We have enough cable.

632
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:28,859
That should give us enough reach
to receive the EAM transmission, sir.

633
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,925
Very well. Float the buoy.

634
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:38,833
- Chief of the watch, float the buoy.
- Float the radio buoy. Aye, sir.

635
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:51,046
Radio buoy deploying, sir.
Tension 2,000 pounds.

636
00:50:52,818 --> 00:50:55,810
Very well.

637
00:50:55,888 --> 00:50:59,915
Conn/Weapons: Estimated time of 1 SQ:
Eight minutes, 30 seconds, sir.

638
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:11,029
- The winch!
- Conn/Sonar: We have a sound
short from the buoy winch!

639
00:51:11,103 --> 00:51:13,003
Stop the goddamn winch!

640
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,767
The winch is stopped, sir!

641
00:51:17,977 --> 00:51:19,569
Goddamn it.

642
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:37,257
- TSO, is that sound still out there?
- Sonar/TSO: Is that sound
still out there?

643
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,263
Sound's gone, sir.

644
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:57,975
I'm getting something.

645
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:06,890
- Supe, he's coming around!

Sonar/Conn, Conn/Sonar: Second torpedo

Uh, we lost him, sir.

679
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,770
- Well, keep looking.
He's out there looking for us.
- Aye, sir.

680
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,870
Weapons/Conn:
Estimated time to 1 SQ.

681
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:48,670
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in six minutes.

682
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,940
- Very well.
- Main seawater pump
is out of commission.

683
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,680
Mr. Zimmer, where's that EAM?

684
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,550
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.
- I got it.

685
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,790
- That's it?
- Uh, uh-huh. It's incomplete, sir.

686
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,460
- We lost it when the radio
buoy cable got severed.
- All right.

687
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,010
All right, gentlemen, let's
get on with it. All ahead one-third.

688
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,050
Steady as you go.

689
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:28,020
All ahead one-third.
Steady. Aye, sir.

690
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,720
Make your depth 150 feet.

691
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,490
Zero bubble.
Up slow and silent to launch depth.

692
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,490
Up slow and silent
to launch depth. Aye, aye, Captain.

693
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:43,100
Captain? Got the EAM.

694
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,570
- What do you think?
- I think there's nothing on this.

695
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,700
Yes, sir. It, uh,
it got cut off during the attack.

696
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,270
Then it's meaningless.

697
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,010
- Sir, this is an EAM pertaining
to nuclear missile launch.
- No, Mr. Hunter.

698
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,950
- That's a message fragment.
- Because it got cut off
during the attack, sir.

699
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,180
The message could mean anything.
It could be a message to abort.

700
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,350
- It could be a message that...
- It could be a fake Russian
transmission.

701
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,390
Which is exactly why
we need to confirm, sir.

702
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,450
- All I'm asking for is the time
we need to get back on line.
- Calm down, Mr. Hunter.

703
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,690
- I am calm.
- You don't appear to be calm.

704
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,600
Conn/Weapons: : Missile systems
ready to launch in four minutes.

705
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,400
- Step aside, seaman.
- Yes, sir.

706
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,440
We have orders in hand, and those orders
are to make a preemptive launch.

707
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:33,210
Every second that we lose
increases the chances that
by the time our missiles arrive...

708
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,250
their silos could be empty
'cause they've flown
their birds and struck us first.

709
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,590
- Yes, sir.
- You know as well as I do
that any launch order...

710
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,420
received without authentication
is no order at all.

711
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,460
- Ye... Captain...
- That's our number-one rule.
- National Mili...

712
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,460
That rule is the basis for the scenario
we've trained on time and time again.

713
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,800
- Yes, sir.
- It's a rule we follow
without exception.

714
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:53,630
Captain, National Military Command
Center knows what sector we're in.

715
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,640
They have satellites looking down on us
to see if our birds are aloft...

716
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,400
and if they're not then
they give our orders to somebody else.

717
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,110
That's why we maintain more than one
sub. It's what they call "redundancy."

718
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,120
- I know about redundancy, Mr. Hunter.
- All I'm saying...

719
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,760
All I'm saying, Captain,
is that we have backup.

720
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,160
Now, it's our duty not to launch
until we can confirm.

721
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,470
You're presuming that we have other
submarines out there ready to launch.

722
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:31,480
Well, as captain I must assume
that our submarines could've
been taken out by other Akulas.

723
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,110
We can play these games all night,
Mr. Hunter, but I don't have
the luxury of your presumptions.

724
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,710
- Sir...
- Mr. Hunter, we have rules that
are not open to interpretation...

725
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,840
personal intuition,
gut feelings...

726
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:44,150
hairs on the back of your neck,
little devils or angels
sitting on your shoulders.

727
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,690
- Captain...
- We're all very well aware
of what our orders are...

728
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,520
and what those orders mean.

729
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,620
They come down from
our Commander-in-Chief.
They contain no ambiguity.

730
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,190
- Captain...
- Mr. Hunter, I've made the decision.

731
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,700
I'm captain of this boat.
Now shut the fuck up!

732
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,540
Damn.

733
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,140
Weapons/Conn:
Shift targeting...

734
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,710
to target package SLBM 64741/2.

735
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,720
This is the captain.

736
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,030
- Captain, I cannot concur.
- Repeat my command.

737
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,360
Sir, we don't know what this
message means. Our target
package could have changed.

738
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:32,770
You repeat this order
or I'll find somebody who will!

739
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,240
- Hell, no, you won't, sir.
- You're relieved of your position.

740
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:39,540
- Cob, remove Mr. Hunter
from the control room.
Get Lieutenant Zimmer in here right now!
- No, sir. No, sir.

741
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:44,610
No, sir, I do not concur and I do not
recognize your authority to relieve me
on the command under Navy regulations.

742
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,080
- Cob, arrest this man
and get him out of here!
- Captain Ramsey...

743
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,850
under the operating procedures governing
the release of nuclear weapons...

744
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,410
- we cannot launch our missiles
unless both you and I agree.
- Cob!

745
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,960
- What are you waiting for?
- Now, this is not a formality, sir!

746
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,290
This is expressly why
your command must be repeated.

747
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,520
It requires my assent.
I do not give it.

748
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,860
And furthermore,
you continue upon this course...

749
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,930
- and insist upon this launch without
confirming this message first...
- Son of a bitch!

750
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,730
- I will be forced...
- Chief of the boat!
- Backed by the rules of precedents...

751
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,430
- As captain
and commanding officer...
- authority and command...

752
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,480
- of the USS Alabama, I order you...
- regulation 08150H6...

753
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,310
- to place the X.O. Under arrest
on the charge of mutiny!
- Of the Navy regulations...

754
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:17,580
- I say again, I order you
to place the X.O. Under arrest...
- to relieve you of command, Captain!

755
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:20,780
On the charge of mutiny!

756
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,120
- Cob!
- Captain, please. The X.O. Is right.

757
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:28,960
We can't launch unless he concurs.

758
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,790
"To the USS Alabama: :

759
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,830
Rebel controlled missiles
being fueled.

760
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,800
Launch codes compromised.
Dissidents threaten launch
at continental United States.

761
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,460
Set DEFCON 2.

762
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,900
Immediately launch
ten Trident missile sorties."

763
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,140
They're fueling their missiles!
We don't have time to fuck around!

764
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,340
Sir, I think you need time
to think this over.

765
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,810
I don't have to think this over!

766
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,410
Captain, I relieve you
of your command of this ship.

767
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,480
Cob, escort the captain
to his stateroom.

768
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,610
- I'm assuming command.
- You're not assuming anything.

769
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,180
Chief of the boat,
Captain Ramsey's under arrest!

770
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:05,020
- Lock him in his stateroom.
- Captain, please...

771
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:08,030
- Now, Cob!
- Aye, sir.

772
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:11,690
Mitchell. Walker.
Take the captain below.

773
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:42,430
You're way out
of your league, Hunter.

774
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:45,440
You're not ready to make
tough decisions yet.

775
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,090
What the hell are we waitin' for?

776
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,940
Anybody here disagrees
with what I've done...

777
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,280
then you feel free to
relieve yourself of duty now.

778
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,080
Anybody?

779
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:46,260
All right.

780
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:54,400
- All stations.
- Aye, sir.

781
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:08,910
This is the executive officer.

782
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:13,920
I've assumed command of
this ship under authority
granted me by Navy regulations.

783
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,130
I have relieved
Captain Ramsey ofhis duties...

784
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,500
for acting in contravention
of the rules and regulations...

785
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,190
regarding nuclear weapons release.

786
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,830
It is my intention
to delay the missile launch...

787
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:31,640
maintaining our current
state of readiness...

788
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:35,670
pending confirmation of
an emergency action message
that was cut off during the attack.

789
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,620
Remain at battle stations missile.

790
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,220
Carry on.

791
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,560
- What the hell are we doin', Fred?
- I don't know about you,
but I'm pissin' my pants.

792
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,880
Come on, boy.

793
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,230
Conn/Weapons: Russians
will have missile launch capability...

794
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:28,030
in 39 minutes.

795
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,030
Chief of the boat.

796
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,410
Sir?

797
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,400
- Thank you, Cob.
- "Thank you"?

798
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:45,110
Fuck you. Get it straight, Mr. Hunter.
I'm not on your side.

799
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,380
Now, you could be wrong.

800
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,390
But wrong or right, the captain
can't just replace you at will.

801
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,690
That was completely improper,
and that's why I did what I did.

802
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,250
- By the book.
- I thank you anyway.

803
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:16,300
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer, get
those communications back on line now.

804
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,080
We're working on it, sir.
Aye, aye, Captain.

805
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:26,120
- Are you ready?
- Uh, ready. Go.

806
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:31,290
- Jesus Christ.
- Fuckin' thing.
- Come on. This whole system is crashed.

807
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,260
- Radio buoy is severed.
What the fuck does he want us to do?
- Shit electrons?

808
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:39,290
- Hey, Vossler, we need communications,
not smart-ass remarks.
- Aye, sir.

809
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,960
- All stop, ten degrees up.
- Ten up. Aye, sir.

810
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,970
All stop. Aye, sir.
Enters all stop.

811
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:08,290
Conn/Sonar: Holy shit, sir! He's right
on top of us! He's turning toward!

812
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,960
- Range.
- 600 yards.

813
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:21,500
Conn/Sonar: Torpedoes in the water!
Bearing 048, 050!

814
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,850
- Left full rudder!
- Left full rudder! Aye, sir!
- All ahead full, zero bubble.

815
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,810
Sir, don't you want to fire back?
Torpedoes are ready, sir.

816
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:33,790
No, we're in too close. Our weapons
won't have time to arm. All ahead flank!

817
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:37,350
- Chief of the watch to Maneuvering,
give me max speed now!
- Maximum speed. Aye, sir!

818
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:47,530
Sonar/Conn: Let me know when our range
to that Akula is open to 1,000 yards!

819
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:51,580
- Conn/Sonar: Aye, sir!
- Goddamn it, let's just shoot
this fucker. What's 1,000 yards for?

820
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,550
'Cause it takes 1,000 yards
for the torpedoes to arm. Jesus,
who'd you fuck to get on this ship?

821
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:02,880
Conn/Sonar: Torpedoes 150 yards
and closing fast, sir!

822
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:07,220
Bearing 070, 074.!

823
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,020
Launch port countermeasures!

824
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,190
- Countermeasures away, sir!
- Rig ship for impact!
- Rig ship for impact! Aye, sir!

825
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,940
- They missed! They missed!
- Yeah!

826
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,180
They passed astern!
They were too close to arm, sir!

827
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:38,210
Conn/Sonar: Range to the Akula:
950 yards and opening fast!

828
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,590
Go to manual on the arming mechanisms,
tubes two and four.

829
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,760
- Snapshot, two and four.
- Snapshot, two and four.
Tubes fired electrically, sir.

830
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,140
Sonar/Conn: Give me
exact ranging and speed on our weapons.

831
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,740
Range: 300 yards
at 50 knots, sir!

832
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,280
200 yards, 50 knots.!

833
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,620
100 yards, 55 knots!

834
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,450
75 yards!
Weapons ready for arming, sir!

835
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,960
- Steady course 231.
- Aye, sir. 231.

836
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,960
Arm torpedoes two and four...

837
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,970
- now!
- Torpedoes armed, sir!

838
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,500
We're locked on the Akula!

839
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,360
You got him, sir! You got him!

840
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,490
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

841
01:07:56,540 --> 01:08:00,670
Conn/Sonar: Incoming torpedo.
They must've got one off
before they got hit, sir.

842
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:02,830
Right full rudder.
Launch starboard countermeasures.

843
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,340
- Countermeasures away, sir.
- Dive!

844
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,970
- Make your depth 1,200 feet!
- Point it down now!
Take her deep! Take her deep!

845
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:11,170
Full dive on those planes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

846
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,640
Hang on, everybody!

847
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:49,750
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah!

848
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,190
Open aft
the main drain suction!

849
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,390
Start the drain pump!
Go, go, go!

850
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,400
All stations make
damage report to Control.

851
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,500
- Oh, shit!
- Control, this is Bilge Bay!

852
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:16,240
We've got out-of-control flooding!
Request damage control!

853
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:19,910
- Mr. Mahoney, get a damage
control party down there!
- Aye, sir.

854
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:24,050
Forward damage control party,
get Lieutenant Hellerman! Flooding in
the bilge bay! Get him down there now!

855
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,090
Conn/Maneuvering:
We've lost propulsion, sir!

856
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,930
- Chief of the boat, how are we doing?
- Sir, we are going down!
I need propulsion!

857
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:38,090
Forward ballast tanks
are damaged, sir!

858
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,930
Forward air pressure: Zero!

859
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,240
Maneuvering/Conn:
Restore propulsion as soon as possible.

860
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:47,800
Conn/Maneuvering: Restoring propulsion
as soon as possible. Aye, sir!

861
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,620
Control/Bilge Bay:
Flooding has slowed!

862
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:08,630
- I think we got it under control, sir.!
- Passing 1,500 feet.

863
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:11,170
At 1,850 it's all over.

864
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,310
Passing 1,600 feet.

865
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:44,630
Barnes, get over here!
Help me with this loose valve!

866
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,650
Passing 1,650 feet.

867
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,390
- What the fuck's going on?
- Take it easy!

868
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,140
Conn/Bilge Bay:
Flooding has recommenced!

869
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:30,840
It looks like three men
are trapped!

870
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,150
Bilge Bay/Conn: Try and
get those men out of there
as soon as you can and seal that bay.

871
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,810
Sir, if we don't seal
the bilge bay now, we'll lose the ship.

872
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,860
Bilge Bay/Conn:
Can you get the men out?

873
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,920
Sir, there's no fuckin' way!
If I go down there, I'll never get out!

874
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:50,160
Barnes, come on! You gotta come!

875
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:55,730
Move.! Move.! Barnes, come on, come on.!
You can do it.! Move it.!

876
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:57,900
Bilge Bay/Conn: Seal that bay.

877
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,740
Barnes, let's go! Come on!
I gotta close the hatch!

878
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,920
What the fuck are we doing here?

879
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:09,010
Bilge Bay/Conn:
I say again, seal that bay!

880
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,780
Sir, there are men down there
and they're gonna drown!

881
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,690
Lieutenant Hellerman,
you have your orders.

882
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,590
Now seal the goddamn bay
before we all go down!

883
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:21,430
Barnes! Please get the fuck out!

884
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,460
Barnes!

885
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:35,100
Come on! Barnes!

886
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:11,310
Conn/Bilge Bay:

887
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,350
Seawater hatch is sealed, sir!

888
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,660
Very well.

889
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,500
Passing 1,800 feet.

890
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:36,440
Approaching
hull crush depth, sir.

891
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,360
1825.

892
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:03,700
Conn/Maneuvering:
Turbine power restored.

893
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:06,860
Main seawater cross valve repaired.

894
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:15,270
And rising.

895
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,910
- Propulsion limit. Ahead full, sir!
- Full ahead steam.

896
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:21,250
- Take us up to periscope depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.

897
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,770
Give me five.

898
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,440
All right, we're livin'.
We're livin', gentlemen.

899
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,700
- Step aside, Tommy.
- I'm sorry, sir.

900
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,700
- The X.O. Ordered us...
- Fuck the X.O.!

901
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:18,240
The ship has been hit,
and I'm going in to see my captain.

902
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,900
Now stand aside.

903
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,570
Stand aside!

904
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,650
Captain.

905
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,690
- Sir.
- How bad is it, Mr. Dougherty?

906
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,990
It's bad, sir.

907
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:41,260
I've just been looking
at Hunter's file here.

908
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,730
Closest to combat he's been
is a policy seminar.

909
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,570
Give me an order, sir.

910
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:53,410
As quietly as you can, you get
to Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Westergaurd.

911
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:58,610
- How about Linkletter?
- Nah, you won't be able to talk
to the TSO. He's at the conn.

912
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,280
But you can get to Weps.
We gotta have Weps. He's the key.

913
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:06,520
You get me those men, a small security
force, then come back and get me.

914
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:10,530
- Aye, sir.
- Don't get overzealous now
and try to recruit the whole ship.

915
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:15,030
- We'll lead from the top down.
- Aye, sir. Right away.

916
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,540
Radio's 50 percent.

917
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,710
Can I talk to you
in the passageway?

918
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:32,380
Right now, Pete. Come on.

919
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,490
- What's goin' on?
- We're not gonna let this go down
with the X.O. At the helm.

920
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,160
- We're not?
- No, we're not.
- I been with the captain for years...

921
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:56,930
and this asshole Hunter shows up,
and I'm supposed to follow him
'cause he says so?

922
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:59,340
You're not supposed to:
You've been ordered to.

923
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,410
That's what this is about:
Proper orders.

924
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,280
Proper orders? He has proper orders.
He won't act on them.

925
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:07,180
He's in command now!

926
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:11,480
If they order him to launch, we'll
launch, and we'll blow 'em all to hell.

927
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,990
But I'd rather go down myself
than get this one wrong.

928
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:16,420
Look, our procedures are clear.

929
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:21,520
In the absence of a contravening order,
in a situation like this,
we follow the orders in hand.

930
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:25,660
Exactly. You know how many checks
we go through to make sure
a launch order is authentic?

931
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:27,670
The X.O. Agreed
with those orders.

932
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:30,040
Now he just wants to throw them away?
They don't count?

933
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,370
- He's lost his nerve.
- Bullshit!

934
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,780
- I know this guy, Bobby!
- You...
- Weps, we've been ordered to launch.

935
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:39,180
Now, why in the world would
we do that if they weren't
prepared to launch at us?

936
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,380
We don't know that for sure!
That's the whole point!

937
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,390
That's why he wants time
to confirm the message.

938
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:48,050
That's the whole fucking point
is we don't have time!

939
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,720
Radchenko is fueling his birds. Now,
why do you think he's doing that? Why?

940
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:56,890
You don't put on a condom
unless you're gonna fuck.

941
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,460
- Go back to your station.
- Excuse me.
- Go back to your station and stay there.

942
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,910
Come on, man.

943
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:09,880
Peter, think about
your family, man.

944
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:12,510
I am. I am!

945
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,820
I mean, what do you...
what do you plan to do?

946
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:26,090
Nothing without you.
You're senior officer department head.

947
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,660
- The TSO's with Hunter.
- And you have the keys
to the small arms locker.

948
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:34,330
Now, we wanna recruit
a few more men, and then
we're gonna open up that arsenal.

949
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:37,070
I just talked to the captain
in his room.

950
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:41,440
He specifically asked for you.
He says we cannot go without you.

951
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,750
I don't believe this.

952
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:50,850
This is a mutiny, Peter.
There's only two sides to a mutiny.

953
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,520
Now, your captain
is asking for your help.

954
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:57,290
What are you gonna do?

955
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,800
What are you gonna do?

956
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:15,050
All right.

957
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:22,320
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles will
have launch capability in 24 minutes.

958
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:42,900
You're doing the right thing.

959
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:59,120
Electrical power
has been restored.

960
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:02,130
All stations prepare
to reinitiate the system.

961
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:11,360
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer,
what's the status on that radio repair?

962
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:15,100
Conn/Radio: All systems are still down,
sir. Lieutenant Zimmer isn't here.

963
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:17,270
- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.

964
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,310
Very well.

965
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,510
Mr. Mahoney has the conn.

966
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:30,110
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.
- Cob.
- Sir.

967
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:32,710
- Send a man to find Zimmer.
- Aye, sir.

968
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,230
- Get a side arm.
- Aye, aye, sir.

969
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,120
- Chief Young.
- Aye, Chief.

970
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,560
Turn around! Move it!

971
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,640
At ease, sailor.

972
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:56,640
- Sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Ince.

973
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:59,010
- Mr. Westergaurd.
- Sir.

974
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,680
- Mr. Zimmer.
- Ready, sir.

975
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,250
Let's get on with it.

976
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:09,490
Stand guard.

977
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:17,270
All you people
return to your stations!

978
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,060
- Mr. Rivetti.
- Sir?

979
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,570
- Follow me, please.
- Yes, sir.

980
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:39,220
Is there a problem, sir?

981
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,560
These are the keys
to the entire submarine.

982
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,230
Conn/Weapons:

983
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:59,370
Russian missiles will have
launch capability in 21 minutes.

984
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,880
Who's in charge here?

985
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:03,880
Shit!

986
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:06,080
Me, sir. Oh, fuck.

987
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:11,250
- How long is it gonna take?
- I don't know, sir.

988
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,260
- Do you know what's going on here?
- Yes, sir.

989
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:17,120
No, I don't think you do.
Let me explain it to you.

990
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:21,720
If we launch and we're wrong, what's
left of Russia is gonna launch at us.

991
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,060
There will be a nuclear
holocaust beyond imagination.

992
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:27,230
So it's all about knowing,
Mr. Vossler.

993
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:30,070
We have to know whether or not our order
to launch has been recalled or not.

994
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:34,100
The only way we're gonna know is if
you fix that radio. You understand me?

995
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,270
Yes, sir.

996
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,610
You ever watch Star Trek?

997
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,650
- Yeah, of course I seen Star Trek.
- Star Trek. You know, Star Trek.

998
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:42,580
- The USS Enterprise.
- Yeah.
- The whole... All right.

999
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:44,680
You remember when the Klingons
were gonna blow up the Enterprise...

1000
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:47,520
and Captain Kirk calls down
to Scotty. He says, "Scotty,
I gotta have more power."

1001
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,190
- He needs more, more warp speed.
- Warp speed. Exactly.
- Yeah.

1002
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:52,990
Well, I'm Captain Kirk,
you're Scotty. I need more power.

1003
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,260
I'm telling you,
if you do not get this radio up,
a billion people are gonna die.

1004
01:22:56,330 --> 01:23:00,600
Now it's all up to you.
I know that's a shitty deal,
but you got it. Can you handle it?

1005
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,770
Scotty.

1006
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,370
Aye, Captain.

1007
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,450
- You got anything?
- No, Vossler.
- Then get on it.

1008
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,950
- I have the conn.
- X.O. Has the conn.

1009
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:28,730
Chief of the boat,
make your depth 75 feet.

1010
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:31,320
- Continue up the periscope depth.
- Belay that order!

1011
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,060
- Get up!
- Jesus.

1012
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:38,240
Okay, okay.

1013
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:51,310
Any of you officers or chiefs
feel you've been unjustly
caught up in this thing...

1014
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:53,320
you stand with me now.

1015
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,890
Sir, propulsion
has been restored.

1016
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:38,370
All flooding has been contained.

1017
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:42,300
All communications
are still down.

1018
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:52,240
Take them away. Lock them up
in the officers' mess.

1019
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:57,250
Come on...

1020
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:30,790
Of all the people.

1021
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:44,770
Weps, return to missile control.

1022
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,770
- Mr. Zimmer, you stay with me.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1023
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,270
The rest of you,
return to your stations.

1024
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:52,040
Inform your men directly
that the captain is in command.

1025
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:54,440
- I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

1026
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:57,450
Diving Officer,
make your depth 150 feet.

1027
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,780
150 feet. Aye, sir.

1028
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:01,780
- 1 MC.
- Aye, sir.

1029
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,350
May I have your attention, please?

1030
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:08,860
Crew of the USS Alabama...

1031
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,450
an attempted mutiny
has been put down.

1032
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:14,960
We'll maintain security alert.

1033
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:18,560
Authorize movement
only in two-man teams.

1034
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:20,970
In the absence of further
radio communication...

1035
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,630
on orders from
the National Command Center...

1036
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:28,840
we'll achieve launch depth as quickly as
we can for strategic missile launch.

1037
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:30,850
We all know what this means.

1038
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,910
It's not something
one would wish for...

1039
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:38,080
but we have the obligation
under authenticated orders
issued by our Commander-in-Chief...

1040
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:41,160
to prevent the attack
on our country.

1041
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:46,160
Russian missiles will have
launch capability in 15 minutes.

1042
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:48,160
Set condition 1 SQ.

1043
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:51,530
Spin up missiles 1-5 and 20-24...

1044
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,830
for strategic missile launch.

1045
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,170
The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

1046
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:01,180
This is the captain.
Mr. Zimmer is the new X.O.

1047
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:06,110
Set condition 1 SQ.

1048
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,960
Spin up missiles 1-5 and 20-24...

1049
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,680
for strategic launch.

1050
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,850
The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

1051
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:20,450
This is the X.O.

1052
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,360
Weapons/Conn:

1053
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:27,460
Confirm target package
SLBM 64741/2...

1054
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:30,540
for missiles 1-5 and 20-24.

1055
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:33,540
- Target package confirmation, sir.
- This is the captain.

1056
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,380
Conn/Weapons:

1057
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,890
Confirm target package
SLBM 64741/2...

1058
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,550
for missiles 1-5 and 20-24.

1059
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:53,060
Aye, sir.

1060
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:05,870
Look, it's not a mutiny.
I did everything by the book.

1061
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,140
It's not about the book.

1062
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:13,380
But if the Russians are gonna launch,
and we sit here and do nothing,
who's gonna stop 'em?

1063
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:15,940
Half of me's glad
the captain came back.

1064
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,250
He could be right, you know.

1065
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,420
No orders are valid, Cob,
if they're wrong.

1066
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,980
- We don't know if they're wrong.
- That's true. We don't know.

1067
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,790
That's why we have to
find out first.

1068
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:37,600
What if Radchenko surrendered
and it's over? Hmm?

1069
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:41,170
We launch. They see us.
They launch.

1070
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,580
Our birds pass each other
in the air. Boom!

1071
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:48,350
- What do you got?
- Nuclear war.

1072
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:50,850
Nuclear holocaust.

1073
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:59,460
- What are you doing down here?
- Jesus, I was just going
to the bathroom.

1074
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:01,860
Rivetti, nobody moves alone.
Come on. You know the drill.

1075
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:06,100
- What, Bennefield,
I need an escort to take a shit?
- Shut up!

1076
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:08,440
Now I'm gonna call Control.
You stay right there.

1077
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,530
- Aw, fuck that.
- I mean it, man!

1078
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,940
- Okay, Moebius, open the door.
- You broke my nose, man.

1079
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,850
Shut up, fat boy.

1080
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:27,510
- Mr. Rivetti, I'm impressed.
- I never liked him, sir.

1081
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:29,560
Rivetti, go to the laundry,
get four sets of coveralls.

1082
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:32,290
- And four caps.
- Aye, sir.

1083
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,300
Good boy.

1084
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,070
Davis. Can I talk to you a second?

1085
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:45,540
Come on.

1086
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,170
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

1087
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,480
- We're with you, sir.
- Let's go.

1088
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,370
Approaching launch depth.

1089
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,570
Very well.
Make your depth 150 feet.

1090
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,580
Zero bubble.
Commence hovering.

1091
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,580
Zero bubble.
Commence hovering. Aye, sir.

1092
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:26,740
Conn/Weapons: Estimated time to weapons
system 1 SQ: 3 minutes, 30 seconds, sir.

1093
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,110
Conn/Weapons:

1094
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,920
Russian missiles will have
launch capability in 12 minutes.

1095
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:35,420
Opening missile hatches.

1096
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:56,640
- Weps.
- Weps, this is Hunter. Listen to me.

1097
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,050
- Where are you?
- Don't worry about where I am.

1098
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,640
You cannot proceed. We got other ships
out there that can handle this.

1099
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:06,160
Now, you can't be influenced
by the captain or anybody else.
You gotta make up your own mind.

1100
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:10,790
Conn/Weapons:
Estimated time to missile launch,
three minutes and counting, sir.

1101
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,890
Weps. Weps, listen.
Don't do this.

1102
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,960
Don't do this. Once you launch,
they cannot come back.
They cannot come back, Weps.

1103
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:18,300
And you know the repercussions
if we're wrong, goddamn it.!

1104
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:23,570
Weps, if we fire now,
we'll be firing while we're blind
and crippled. Do you understand me?

1105
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:27,080
- Where the fuck are you?
- Do not remove that firing trigger.!

1106
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:29,240
Do not open the safe.
Weps, it's up to you.

1107
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:32,650
You're the only one that knows
the combination. It's up to you, Weps.!

1108
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:34,840
It's up to you.

1109
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:39,860
Mind your fuckin' panel!

1110
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:49,090
- You guys ready?
- Just about, sir.

1111
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:54,270
Radio/X. O: Vossler?

1112
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:57,600
X.O. /Radio: Sir.

1113
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,670
- I don't know, sir.
- Vossler, calm down. Just calm down.

1114
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:03,150
- Take a deep breath. Are you calm?
- Yeah, sort of.

1115
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:06,710
Get the radio fixed, Vossler.
I could have built one by now.
How long is it gonna take you?

1116
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,880
I don't know.

1117
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,290
Well, how much time do you need?

1118
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:16,960
Shit! Let's go.

1119
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:26,870
Missile tubes 1-5 and 20-24
at 1 SQ, sir.

1120
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:36,080
Ship is hovering on automatic.
Dive's at 1 SQ, Captain.

1121
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:38,880
Missiles at 1 SQ.
Ready to launch, sir.

1122
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,720
Sir, weapons system is at 1 SQ.

1123
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:52,890
- Missiles are ready for launch, sir.
- Very well.

1124
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,730
- Weapons.
- Aye, sir.

1125
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:58,860
Weapons/Conn:
Remove the tactical firing trigger.

1126
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:14,350
- 1 MC.
- Aye, sir.

1127
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:17,950
Weapons, this is the captain.
Unlock the tactical firing trigger.

1128
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:25,590
Weps?

1129
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,760
Missiles are ready to launch, man.

1130
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:33,070
Sir.

1131
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:40,280
Shit. Mr. Zimmer.

1132
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:42,470
No one is to touch this key.

1133
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,950
- I'm going to launch
from missile control.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1134
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:48,780
- Westergaurd.
- Sir?
- Dougherty. Come with me.

1135
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:52,480
- Mr. Mahoney, take the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.

1136
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,790
What are you doing, man?
We're at 1 SQ. We're ready.

1137
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,000
- Mr. Dougherty?
- Aye.

1138
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,970
- Station your guards fore and aft.
- Last two, forward hatch!

1139
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:07,440
First two, aft hatch!

1140
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:11,900
They're gonna fire
from missile control.

1141
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,280
We gotta get back to the conn
and disarm the system. Come on.

1142
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:16,180
We'll travel
in the crawl spaces.

1143
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:33,760
Mr. Ince!

1144
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:39,100
Mr. Ince, remove
the tactical firing key.

1145
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:44,670
- Sir, it is my duty to...
- Son, don't talk to me about duty.
Open the fucking safe!

1146
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,810
I can't do that, sir.

1147
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,360
I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm
gonna blow your fucking head off. One.

1148
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:14,870
Two.

1149
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,870
Shit!

1150
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:26,380
It does me no good to kill you. You're
the only one that knows the combination.

1151
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:30,190
However...

1152
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,990
Petty Officer Hilaire...

1153
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:36,860
doesn't know the combination!

1154
01:35:36,930 --> 01:35:40,660
Millions of lives are at stake here,
Peter! Don't make a dumb decision!

1155
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:43,220
One!

1156
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:45,730
Two!

1157
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,740
Sir!

1158
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,090
- Cob.
- Yo.

1159
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,290
You and Hunsicker are going
to enter the conn from the bow.

1160
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,200
Rivetti, Linkletter and myself
will come in through the aft.

1161
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:18,960
Rivetti, you jump
right on Zimmer, okay?

1162
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,460
Come on. Come on!

1163
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,760
- Fire control ready?
- Aye, sir.
- Launcher ready?

1164
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:48,800
- Aye, sir.
- Initiate fire.

1165
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,800
- Freeze! Hold it, sir.
- Drop the weapon now!

1166
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:54,630
Move forward! Move forward!
Move, move, move! Get his pistol.

1167
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:58,270
- Fire one!
- Number one did not fire, sir.

1168
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:04,010
Sir, the captain's key
has been removed.

1169
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,910
Hunter.

1170
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:09,680
- You're a piece of shit.
- Son of a bitch.

1171
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,810
All right, you and you,
man the forward hatches.

1172
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,750
- Aye, sir.
- Aye, sir.
- You, you, man the aft hatches.

1173
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:15,820
- Aye, sir.
- We're going up to periscope depth.

1174
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:19,120
We're going to
reestablish communications
and get that radio message.

1175
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:24,640
Now, anybody got a problem
with that? Chief of the boat,
make your depth 78 feet.

1176
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:27,140
Aye, aye, sir.
Make your depth 78 feet.
Five degree up bubble.

1177
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:28,930
Mr. Linkletter, man that periscope.

1178
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:33,770
- Aye, aye, sir.
Raising number two scope.
- Radio/Conn: Mr. Vossler.

1179
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:36,870
This is Captain Kirk.
I need warp speed on that radio.

1180
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:39,850
Yes, sir.

1181
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:43,440
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles will
have launch capability in nine minutes.

1182
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:51,550
- Oh, shit!
- What? What happened?
- Reattach that lead!

1183
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:07,470
Seventy-eight feet.
At periscope depth, sir!

1184
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:09,710
- Mr. Linkletter.
- No close contact, sir.

1185
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:13,310
Very well. Chief of the watch,
raise the VLF radio antenna.

1186
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:16,820
Raise the VLF antenna. Aye, sir.

1187
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:19,250
VLF antenna coming up!

1188
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:22,090
Five, four, three.

1189
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:27,730
Conn/Radio: Sir. I think
she's breathing. We're getting close.

1190
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:41,070
- Halt, sir!
- Shoot me.
- Shit. Shit.

1191
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:43,440
I got him.

1192
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,450
I have the conn.

1193
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:49,920
Give me my missile key.

1194
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:00,120
Give me the missile key,
Mr. Hunter.

1195
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,110
I'm the commander of this fucking ship!
Give me the goddamn key!

1196
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:27,050
Conn/Weapons: : Russian missiles will
have launch capability in seven minutes.

1197
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,060
Conn/Radio: : Sir.!

1198
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,070
- Radio/Conn!
- Captain/Radio: Vossler, sir.

1199
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:40,130
She's breathing again.
We are really, really close.

1200
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:44,610
- You got three minutes, Vossler.
Three minutes and counting.
- Yes, sir.

1201
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:48,980
You got three minutes.

1202
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:01,160
Come on.

1203
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:23,440
Come on, Vossler. Come on. Come on.
Keep it going. Keep it going.

1204
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:32,960
Speaking of horses...

1205
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,220
- did you ever see
those Lipizzaner stallions?
- What?

1206
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,860
From Portugal.

1207
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:43,300
The Lipizzaner stallions.

1208
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,700
The most highly trained horses
in the world. They're all white.

1209
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:51,160
Yes, sir.

1210
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:56,700
"Yes, sir," you're aware they're all
white or "yes, sir," you've seen them?

1211
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:01,050
Yes, sir, I've seen them.

1212
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:04,750
Yes, sir, I'm aware
that they're all white.

1213
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,320
They're not from Portugal:
They're from Spain.

1214
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:12,050
And at birth, they're not white,
they're black.

1215
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:15,990
Sir.

1216
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,260
I didn't know that.

1217
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,600
But they are from Portugal.

1218
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:27,100
- Come on, Vossler. Come on.
- Yes! Yes!

1219
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:29,770
Come on. Come on. You got it.

1220
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:37,120
Some of the things they do,
uh, defy belief.

1221
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,960
Their training program
is simplicity itself.

1222
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:46,520
You just stick a cattle prod
up their ass, and you can get
a horse to deal cards.

1223
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:49,960
Simple matter of voltage.

1224
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:01,800
You're gonna get it. Come on.

1225
01:42:03,410 --> 01:42:07,650
- I almost had it. You saw it.
- Conn/Weapons:

1226
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:11,050
Russian missiles will have
launch capability in four minutes.

1227
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:16,650
There you go. There you go!
Aw, shit!

1228
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,300
Look, look, look! Look at it, Vossler!
There we go. There we go!

1229
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,000
Yes!

1230
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:35,850
Conn/Radio: We are receiving
flash traffic. Emergency action message.

1231
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:39,470
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one. Fuck, yeah.!

1232
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:44,750
Alert one. Alert one.
Dougherty, Westergaurd, Zimmer.

1233
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:46,850
- Get that EAM.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1234
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:53,420
God help you if you're wrong.

1235
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:58,440
If I'm wrong, then we're at war.
God help us all.

1236
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:13,310
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message...

1237
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:15,380
from the National
Command Authority, sir.

1238
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:18,550
- Request permission
to authenticate, sir.
- Permission granted. Authenticate.

1239
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:31,030
"Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."

1240
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:35,700
"Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."

1241
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:37,900
- Message is authentic, Captain.
- I concur, sir.

1242
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:52,180
- I concur, sir.
- Message is authentic.

1243
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,700
1 MC.

1244
01:44:07,870 --> 01:44:11,740
Crew of the Alabama,
this is the captain.

1245
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,000
Set condition 2SQ.

1246
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:18,240
Terminate launch, all missiles.

1247
01:44:21,850 --> 01:44:24,510
All right! All right!

1248
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:03,990
Mr. Hunter has the conn.

1249
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,390
In the early hours of this morning,
Russian Army forces moved in...

1250
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:10,550
and met surprisingly
little resistance.

1251
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:13,460
There were some
sporadic battles...

1252
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:15,900
but, apparently, the specter
of fighting their countrymen...

1253
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,060
proved too much for these rebel troops,
and they surrendered quickly.

1254
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:24,040
And so a crisis that seemed
to be escalating beyond
the point of no return...

1255
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:27,510
was ultimately resolved with fewer
than a hundred soldiers dead.

1256
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:32,020
And the nuclear base
captured by Radchenko
is now back in government hands.

1257
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:36,710
Reporting live from the French aircraft
carrier Foch in the Mediterranean Sea...

1258
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:40,090
this is Richard Valeriani
for CNN.

1259
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:53,560
All right, stand there, uh, Lieutenant
Commander Hunter. This won't take long.

1260
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:56,870
This panel has convened in order
to investigate the events...

1261
01:46:56,940 --> 01:47:02,070
subsequent to the setting of condition
1 SQ for strategic missile launch...

1262
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:05,910
on board the USS Alabama
on 1 November.

1263
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:10,510
Now, based on the testimony
from personnel on board the Alabama...

1264
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:15,550
and, in no small measure, to that
of the senior officer, Captain Ramsey...

1265
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:18,250
I'm prepared to make
my recommendations to SUBPAC.

1266
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:23,060
- Without my testimony, sir?
- You have a problem with that?

1267
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:28,200
- I might, sir.
- I have known Captain Ramsey
for almost 30 years.

1268
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:31,370
We served together
on more than a few occasions.

1269
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,640
If he is lying,
this will be the first I've heard of it.

1270
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:36,770
Yes, sir.

1271
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:41,150
My primary concern here
is the breakdown in the system.

1272
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:44,240
In this instance,
the system failed...

1273
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:49,260
because the two senior officers did not
work to resolve their differences...

1274
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:51,820
while preserving
the chain of command.

1275
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:55,460
Now, you may have been
proven right, Mr. Hunter...

1276
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:58,830
but insofar as the letter
of the law is concerned...

1277
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:01,340
you were both right.

1278
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:04,900
And you were also both wrong.

1279
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:09,500
This is the dilemma that will
occupy this panel, this Navy...

1280
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:13,110
and this country's armed forces
as a whole...

1281
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:15,680
long after you leave this room.

1282
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:20,150
Off the record...

1283
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:23,250
you've both created
one hell of a mess.

1284
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:28,320
A mutiny aboard
a United States nuclear submarine...

1285
01:48:28,430 --> 01:48:32,660
violation of nuclear
launch protocol.

1286
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,970
For the record, it is
the conclusion of this panel...

1287
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,530
that your actions
aboard the Alabama...

1288
01:48:41,650 --> 01:48:44,510
were consistent with
the best traditions of the Navy...

1289
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:46,640
and in the interests
of the United States.

1290
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:51,380
As such, the recommendations
of this panel will be to accept...

1291
01:48:51,490 --> 01:48:56,550
in a manner reflective of his long
and dedicated service to his country...

1292
01:48:56,660 --> 01:49:01,190
Captain Ramsey's request
for early retirement from active duty.

1293
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:06,740
And based, in no small part,
on Captain Ramsey's recommendation...

1294
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:10,740
that Lieutenant Commander Hunter
be given his next command...

1295
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:14,540
at the earliest
possible convenience.

1296
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:19,050
Unless, of course, you wish
to challenge these recommendations.

1297
01:49:19,150 --> 01:49:21,740
No, sir.

1298
01:49:21,850 --> 01:49:24,080
- Captain Ramsey?
- No, sir.

1299
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:28,590
Dismissed.

1300
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:43,110
Captain?

1301
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,350
Just wanted to say thank you.

1302
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:03,720
You were right,
and I was wrong.

1303
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:10,590
About the horses, the Lipizzaners.
They are from Spain, not Portugal.

1304
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:14,440
Yes, sir.
