1
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,965
- Yeah, hold on a second.
- What were you saying?

2
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,343
- Taxi! Taxi!
- All right, what are you saying?

3
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,513
I'm asking why you thought
you didn't have to be on time.

4
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,644
Finally. God, come on.

5
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,658
- Sorry.
- Yeah. At last.

6
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,244
Good. Great.

7
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,710
Alex, cue three.
Sound, cue four and tabs, go.

8
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,887
Soul of the age

9
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,265
The applause, delight

10
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,018
The wonder of our stage

11
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,855
Our Shakespeare, rise!

12
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,691
Our Shakespeare.

13
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,028
For he is all of ours, is he not?

14
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,447
The most performed playwright
of all time.

15
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,700
The author of 37 plays...

16
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,036
...a hundred and fifty-four sonnets...

17
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,539
...and several narrative poems
that are collectively known...

18
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:09,629
...as the ultimate expressions
of humanity in the English language.

19
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,632
And yet....

20
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,344
And yet...

21
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,307
...not a single manuscript
of any kind...

22
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,812
...has ever been found
written in Shakespeare's own hand.

23
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,148
In 400 years, not one document.

24
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,568
He was born the son
of a glove maker...

25
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,322
...and at some unknown time,
armed...

26
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,659
...but with a grammar-school
education...

27
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,494
...he went to London...

28
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,498
...where, the story goes,
he became an actor...

29
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,334
...and, eventually, a playwright.

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,964
He died at the age of 52.

31
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,925
And he was survived by
his wife and two daughters...

32
00:02:56,093 --> 00:03:01,180
...who, like Shakespeare's own father,
were irrefutably illiterate.

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,017
His will famously left his
second-best bed to his widow.

34
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,604
But it made no mention
of a single book...

35
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,107
...or manuscript.

36
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,026
Our Shakespeare...

37
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,613
...is a cipher. A ghost.

38
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,367
So let me offer you a different story.

39
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:26,122
A darker story, of quills and swords.

40
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,124
Of power and betrayal.

41
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:33,296
Of a stage conquered
and a throne lost.

42
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,717
After him!

43
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,478
There he is!

44
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,480
Get him!

45
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,860
Over there!

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,237
Hurry!

47
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,244
- Break it down!
- Go, lads!

48
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,913
Put your back into it!

49
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,469
Search the place!

50
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,012
Jonson!

51
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,765
- Jonson!
- That way!

52
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,351
I know you're in here!

53
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,103
Jonson, show yourself!

54
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,855
Come out!

55
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,566
Out with you, Jonson!

56
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,527
I'll smoke you out like a rat!

57
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,405
- Torch it!
- Give it up!

58
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,491
Torch it!

59
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,909
Burn everything!

60
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,121
Do you smell that, Jonson?

61
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,794
That's the smell of your theater
going up in flames!

62
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,807
Arrest him!

63
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,310
Shall we to the Tower?

64
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,272
Make way!
This is none of your concern!

65
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,714
Chain him here, then leave us.

66
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,471
He was carrying nothing
but a quill and some empty pages.

67
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:52,601
You are Benjamin Jonson,
playwright.

68
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,521
Son of William Jonson, glassblower.

69
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,565
Yeah.

70
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,526
And have you ever
been arrested before, Mr. Jonson?

71
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,114
I'm a writer, aren't I? Of course
I've bloody well been arrested.

72
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:12,038
Ask him about the plays.

73
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,206
Plays?

74
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,170
Oh, which would you prefer,
Sir Robert Cecil? A pastoral?

75
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:23,549
An historical? An historical pastoral?
An hysterical historical pastoral?

76
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,388
We are not interested in your plays,
Mr. Jonson.

77
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:33,017
We're interested in the plays
given to you by Edward de Vere...

78
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,311
...Earl of Oxford.

79
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,523
I am sorry, sir.

80
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,903
I am not sure I know
whereof you speak.

81
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,493
Where are the plays?

82
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,996
What plays?

83
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:05,257
- Wonderful, isn't it?
- Well, it's certainly big.

84
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,886
I promise you, Edward,
you've seen nothing like it!

85
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,431
There won't be puppets, will there?

86
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:18,604
Step aside, step aside! Make way for
my Lords of Oxford and Southampton!

87
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,776
And here come the fool
and the jester again, methinks.

88
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,112
The stagecraft is quite spectacular.

89
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,989
Far more elaborate than anything
I've seen at court.

90
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,409
Sheart, what a damn'd
witty rogue's this!

91
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,954
How he confounds with his similes!

92
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,414
Better with similes than smiles.

93
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,418
And whither were you riding now,
signior?

94
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,756
Whither should I ride
but to the court?

95
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,966
Pardon me, sir.

96
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,219
Thou never saw'st
my gray hobby yet.

97
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,138
Have you such a one?

98
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,140
No!

99
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,062
Ale!

100
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,273
Marlowe, spot me a few pence,
will you?

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,567
Henslowe owes me
for Shoemaker's Holiday.

102
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,486
That's because no one saw
Shoemaker's Holiday.

103
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,654
Ale!

104
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,991
Kit, isn't that one of your
unrequited loves in the box?

105
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,660
- The Earl of Southampton?
- But with whom?

106
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,997
By the beard, that's Edward de Vere,
the Earl of Oxford.

107
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,292
Had his own acting troupe
for private court performances.

108
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,004
- I wonder if he needs any material.
- Certainly not yours.

109
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,840
What, the noble, there?
Why, he's a gull!

110
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,009
He's a fool!

111
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,847
The poor man's brain is lighter
than his feather!

112
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,932
Enough!

113
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,316
Jonson, wonderful dialogue.

114
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,194
It's absolutely wonderful.

115
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,655
- Sorry, sire.
- Will.

116
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,868
Will Shakespeare.
That is not ale in that goblet, is it?

117
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,119
Ale?

118
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,121
Me?

119
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,125
Drink during a performance?
I am a professional, Mr. Henslowe.

120
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,711
- Make way!
- An utter professional.

121
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,339
Stand aside!

122
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,050
- You stand aside!
- Watch yourself!

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,263
This play has been
declared seditious...

124
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,893
...by Lord William Cecil!

125
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,896
Why don't you disperse
William Cecil's arse?

126
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,648
Arrest that man!

127
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,483
Disperse!

128
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,693
This play is seditious...

129
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,154
- ...and will not continue!
- Seditious?

130
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:36,283
It's a comedy!
There's nothing seditious about it!

131
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,370
Is that right?
And you know this because...?

132
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,580
Because I wrote the bloody thing.

133
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,958
- Arrest this man as well!
- What? No, wait--

134
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,003
Please! I'm a poet, for God's sake!
I'm not a criminal!

135
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,548
Thus endeth the brief career
of one Ben Jonson.

136
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,927
- Disperse!
- William Cecil, you're an arsehole!

137
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,846
Well, off to Essex House, then.

138
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,516
I'd like to see his arse dispersed!

139
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,768
Disperse!

140
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,776
Out. Henry, how many people
were at that play?

141
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,361
I'm not sure.

142
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,614
Two thousand? Maybe more.

143
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,034
How many performances are there
of a play like that?

144
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,287
Five or six, I suppose.

145
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,455
- New service.
- By the beard.

146
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,626
Ten thousand souls, all listening
to the writings, the ideas of one man.

147
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,420
That's power, Essex.

148
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,923
And if there's one thing
the Cecils understand, it's power.

149
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,384
New service!

150
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,763
And since when did words
ever win a kingdom?

151
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,434
I'll keep my sword,
thank you very much.

152
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,480
Out.

153
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,987
Henry, some of my men have...

154
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,157
...intercepted some of William Cecil's
correspondence...

155
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,909
...with King James of Scotland.

156
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,121
Cecil's all but promising him
the throne.

157
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,373
To James? Elizabeth would never--

158
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,877
Elizabeth is old. Ill.

159
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,171
And yet she refuses
to name an heir.

160
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,673
But a Scotsman?
On the Tudor throne?

161
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,010
That is why we must do everything
in our power to ensure...

162
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,971
...the right man succeeds Elizabeth.

163
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,475
A man deserving
of the Tudor crown.

164
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,313
I ask you for the support
of you and your men, Henry...

165
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,484
...if it comes to a fight,
for me to seize the throne.

166
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,736
You know you need not ask.

167
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,655
I stand with you, as I always have.

168
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,958
Be careful, Henry.

169
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,337
Always concerned for me.
What would you have me do?

170
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,297
- Deny him.
- The son of the queen?

171
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,383
That is rumor alone, Henry.

172
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,967
Rumor?

173
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:03,305
All you have to do is look at Essex
to see the queen's reflection.

174
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,058
- Everyone thinks he's her son.
- My lords.

175
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,561
And I, for one...

176
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,982
...would rather bow to a Tudor, bastard
though he may be, than a Scotsman.

177
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,861
My only desire is to see the next king
be the rightful king.

178
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,408
But what Essex contemplates
will lead to civil war. No.

179
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,576
If this is to be done...

180
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,038
...it must be done carefully.

181
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,169
Tie her off there.

182
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,633
- I agree, my lord.
- My Lord of Southampton.

183
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,095
Sir Robert Cecil.

184
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,805
Have you seen Lord Essex?

185
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,391
He is in the viewing chamber
with Her Majesty.

186
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,684
Alone?

187
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:52,104
With your father in London
dealing with troubles in Ireland...

188
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,107
...who else should the queen
turn to but Essex?

189
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,323
By the grace of God,
Her Majesty, Elizabeth...

190
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,870
...Queen of England
Wales and Ireland.

191
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:15,627
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

192
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,633
- Your Majesty.
- God bless Your Majesty.

193
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,511
God bless Your Majesty.

194
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,101
Your Majesty, my Lord
of Southampton has a gift for you.

195
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,811
A gift?

196
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,899
Yes, Your Grace.
Though not from me.

197
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:08,263
Are you the gift,
my gracious little man?

198
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,599
No, no, my most majestic Majesty.

199
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,520
I am a free man. My gift is a play.

200
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,979
A play?

201
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,565
Plays are the work of the devil...

202
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,860
...born from a cesspool of plague,
whoredom, thievery...

203
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,905
...fornication and heresy.

204
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,367
- Tell your master that Her Majesty--
- Will gladly accept.

205
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,703
That is, of course,
if Your Majesty so desires.

206
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,038
Comedy or tragedy?

207
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,208
- Comedy, Majesty.
- Comedy. By whom?

208
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,586
By Anonymous, Your Majesty.

209
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,216
Anonymous.

210
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:51,723
I so admire his verse.

211
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,602
Lead us to this play.

212
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,071
The woosel cock so black of hue

213
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,741
With orange-tawny bill

214
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,243
The throstle--

215
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:16,206
The throstle with his note so true

216
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,167
The wren with little quill

217
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,298
What angel...

218
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,342
...wakes me from my flow'ry bed?

219
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,471
The finch, the sparrow and the lark

220
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,558
The plain-song cuckoo gray

221
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:38,437
If we shadows have offended,
think but this and all is mended.

222
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,066
That you have but slumber'd here
while these visions did appear.

223
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,070
And this weak and idle theme,
no more yielding but a dream.

224
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:53,243
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.

225
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,746
So good night unto you all.

226
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,123
Give me your hands,
if we be friends...

227
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,043
...and Robin shall restore amends.

228
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,757
Wonderful, wonderful.

229
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,593
Most wonderful.

230
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,185
It was so funny.
She really loved the donkey.

231
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,605
Edward, Edward,
when can we do it again?

232
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,818
There he is.

233
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,614
Your father tells me you wrote
this evening's play yourself.

234
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,532
I did indeed, Your Majesty.

235
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,910
You sport with me.

236
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,664
Compose something.

237
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,832
- Now?
- Yes, now.

238
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,752
On what subject, Your Grace?

239
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,921
On truth.

240
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,925
For truth...

241
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,927
...is truth...

242
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,888
...though never so old...

243
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:59,017
...and time cannot make that false
which once was true.

244
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,855
My Lord of Oxford,
it seems you have added a poet...

245
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,982
...to your family's line of warriors.

246
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,986
I am as accomplished with sword
and musket as I am in verse.

247
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,196
Are you indeed?

248
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,033
It is my only desire to be
Your Majesty's most trusted servant...

249
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,204
...in matters both of war and state,
if you will but have me.

250
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,542
Why, Lord Cecil, we may very well
have found your replacement.

251
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,336
We hope not too soon,
Your Majesty.

252
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:30,507
And what thought you
of our young lord's play, William?

253
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,177
If plays are indeed such a sin...

254
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:38,724
...I pray that I do not find my salvation
until very late in life.

255
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,814
Jonson!

256
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,482
Benjamin Jonson!

257
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,905
You have been released.

258
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,246
Got powerful friends now,
don't you?

259
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,557
Ship oars!

260
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,946
My lord.

261
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,240
The Tudor rose.

262
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,828
The most beautiful of flowers,
do you not think?

263
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,957
- I assume I owe my freedom to you.
- That is true.

264
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,627
And it was hard to come by.

265
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,797
One does not cross
my father-in-law lightly.

266
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,757
Lord William Cecil.

267
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,804
I have the questionable distinction
to be married to his only daughter.

268
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,476
It was helpful
when I wrote to your jailers...

269
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,729
...to release you
in my father-in-law's name.

270
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,108
My release was not
officially sanctioned?

271
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:17,030
Don't be an idiot. Of course it wasn't.
But you are free, are you not?

272
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:26,790
I enjoyed your little comedy, Jonson.
You have great potential.

273
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:27,999
Thank you, my lord.

274
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,044
But its politics did have
quite an effect on the Tower.

275
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,506
My father-in-law's men
felt it quite seditious.

276
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,384
Politics. My play has nothing
to do with politics.

277
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:38,969
It's just a simple comedy.

278
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,722
That showed your betters as fools
who would barely get food...

279
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,268
...from plate to mouth without
the cleverness of their servants.

280
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,272
All art is political, Jonson.
Otherwise, it would just be decoration.

281
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,025
And all artists have something to say.
Otherwise, they'd make shoes.

282
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,862
And you are not a cobbler,
are you, Jonson?

283
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,865
Francesco?

284
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,037
A play, my lord.

285
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,373
One you shall stage Bankside.

286
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,208
Stage?

287
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,544
Under your name.

288
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,713
My name, my lord?

289
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,882
I can't very well use my name,
can I?

290
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,717
I'm the 17th Earl of Oxford.

291
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,970
The Lord Great Chamberlain
of England, Viscount Bolebec...

292
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,223
...Lord of Escales, Sanford
and Badlesmere, etc. No.

293
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,602
I have a reputation to protect.

294
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:33,940
In my world, one does not
write plays, Jonson.

295
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,317
People like you do.

296
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,776
Yes, my lord.

297
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,989
My lord, you wrote an entire play.
I know how difficult that is.

298
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,283
Not a play, Jonson.
I've written many.

299
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,161
No doubt many more
than you yourself.

300
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:50,582
A good number performed years ago,
others never seen by a living soul.

301
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,086
And you want me
to put my name to this play?

302
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,298
No, I mean you to put your name
to all of them.

303
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,134
- All of them?
- Don't look at me...

304
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,678
...like I just gutted your pet dog.

305
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,847
I mean to make you
the most popular...

306
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,726
...and therefore most monetarily
successful playwright in London.

307
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,270
I wish you Godspeed
and good morrow.

308
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,441
My lord, I really--

309
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,945
This is for your trouble,
Signor Jonson.

310
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,613
And for your silence.

311
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,910
If you break that silence,
not so good for Signor Jonson.

312
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,040
Tell me about this play.

313
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,211
It was an anonymous gift.

314
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,216
Essex insisted it be performed
just to spite me in front of court.

315
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,635
Of course he did.
What was it about?

316
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,972
Some nonsense about fairies
and cherubs.

317
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,308
And dancing asses.

318
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,940
Edward, our poet earl,
has returned to court.

319
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,567
Father...

320
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,153
...it was just a play.

321
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,281
Know how long it took to banish them
from her presence?

322
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:09,369
She adores them!
And Edward knows it!

323
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,915
Mark my words,
he has done this to spite us.

324
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,172
Edward wishes to choose
the next king.

325
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,676
Haven't you convinced
the Privy Council...

326
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,387
...to crown James of Scotland
the next king?

327
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,848
Nobody has a better claim.

328
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,308
Except one of Elizabeth's bastards.

329
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,186
You mean Essex.

330
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,232
He despises us.

331
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,695
We shall lose all of our royal licenses,
our property!

332
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,948
I shall convince her
to send Essex to Ireland...

333
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,534
...to quell the Catholic rebellion.

334
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,370
Southampton will follow.

335
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:57,834
And if God is watching, neither will
return alive. And if he is not....

336
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,854
Robert!

337
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,692
Robert, come here!

338
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,240
I am sorry, my Lord of Oxford.

339
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,910
My son prefers
the company of himself.

340
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,914
May I present to you my wife...

341
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,792
...Lady Cecil,
and my daughter, Anne?

342
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,045
I am sorry for your loss, my lord.

343
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:45,090
The realm lost a great man
with your father's death.

344
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,926
We hope you will be happy
in our house.

345
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,928
Are you going to live here forever?

346
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,598
No. Only until I reach my maturity.

347
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,435
- Why?
- Because the queen has bade it so.

348
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,229
My lord, when we first met...

349
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,273
...you said you wished to become
a great man of state.

350
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,943
The queen and I hope
to make that so.

351
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:09,531
To that end, I have the honor
of introducing you to your tutors.

352
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:13,451
From 7 to 8, you will be tutored
in French by Mr. Crane.

353
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,453
My Lord of Oxford.

354
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,083
Nine to 10 is Greek
with Mr. Simmons.

355
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,587
- Is that Homer?
- No. Plato.

356
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,883
- Then cosmography with Dr. Richards.
- My lord.

357
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,053
Two to 3 is geography and history.

358
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,514
And 4 to 5, fencing.

359
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,475
And composition? Poetry?

360
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,520
This is a Puritan home, my lord.

361
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,940
We believe such activities
to be the worship of false idols...

362
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,568
...and therefore a sin
before the eyes of God.

363
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,319
A sin?

364
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:52,323
Surely there must be room for beauty
and art in life, my lord?

365
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,493
Not in this household.

366
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,638
You were losing anyway.

367
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,849
I was also winning.

368
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,895
Really?

369
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,819
I think we can assume
I've mastered the Punta Riversa.

370
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,822
Now I think we should move on
to the Punta Sopramano.

371
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,993
- Perchance with that, you will best me.
- Yes, my lord.

372
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,661
Apple for you, sir? There we are.

373
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,331
- Was it any good?
- How should I know?

374
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,749
You haven't read it?

375
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,918
I promised I'd finish Eastward Ho.

376
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,755
He's a nobleman, you say?
Well, is he powerful, rich?

377
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,343
Then you have to do it then,
don't you?

378
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:43,268
Will, I came to London to be
a great and soaring poet.

379
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,604
To be the conscience of our times.
The soul of the age.

380
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,439
To change the world, not--

381
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,525
Change the world?
What, with rhyme?

382
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:54,612
Yes. Why not? Why can't a man
change the world with words?

383
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,284
"I'll make you the richest and most
popular playwright in London!"

384
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,162
Bollocks! I can do that myself,
thank you very much!

385
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,455
He's an amateur.

386
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,291
A complete and utter amateur.

387
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,544
Last week, gardening.
This week, writing. Next, hawking.

388
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:14,382
No. No, I won't do it. It would be
an affront against the Muses.

389
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:21,055
How much money
did you say he gave you?

390
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,141
You think my name can be bought?

391
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,270
No, no, no, not at all. No.

392
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:31,274
I think we should keep
your good name quite intact.

393
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:38,197
King Philip of Spain sees
the current Catholic revolt in Ireland...

394
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:42,076
...as a weakness of ours.

395
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,871
A weakness to be exploited.

396
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,080
Ireland?

397
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:51,127
There are reports of his sending
financial aid, even troops.

398
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:56,007
We must act quickly. We must replace
the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland...

399
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,344
- ...and send additional troops--
- Replace?

400
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,473
- With whom?
- I would recommend...

401
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,892
...his lordship...

402
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,853
...the Earl of Essex.

403
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,524
No, that's impossible.
He cannot be spared.

404
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,610
We value his counsel greatly.

405
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,945
Essex's martial abilities are...

406
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,657
...in my opinion, the only antidote
to the plague of Spain.

407
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,994
Essex could not, unfortunately...

408
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,039
...remain in the Privy Council
while he is in Ireland.

409
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,875
And who would you advise
to replace him?

410
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,586
Sir Robert Cecil.

411
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,546
Your son?

412
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,006
Yes.

413
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:41,219
Though he is my own advisor first,
Your Majesty, my son second.

414
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,013
Yes. Yes, yes.

415
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,727
Very well. Send Essex...

416
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,687
...to Ireland.

417
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,649
And we will place Robert
on our Privy Council.

418
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,074
I saw a play this last weekend,
William.

419
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,536
It made me think of...

420
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,581
...many things long past.

421
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,335
I'd like to see more of them.

422
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,758
Has Edward been happy...

423
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,760
...William...

424
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,096
...with your daughter?

425
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,100
Murdered?!

426
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,811
- By your own hand.
- He was stealing my poems.

427
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,230
- He was doing my bidding!
- Yours?

428
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:39,444
Of course! As soon as Robert told me
you were ignoring my express orders--

429
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,613
- Robert? Robert told?
- Enough!

430
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:48,035
Thou shalt not worship false idols
in my household.

431
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:52,206
Your everlasting soul
hangs in the balance, not poems.

432
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,292
My poems are my soul!

433
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,922
You have placed me
in a grave position, Edward.

434
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,551
I cannot have my reputation soiled...

435
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,054
...by this regrettable lack of control
on your part.

436
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,602
We can claim self-defense.

437
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,105
He drew sword first.

438
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:20,193
But there is something
I wish in return.

439
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:25,406
My daughter is young
and impressionable.

440
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,450
She has feelings for you, Edward.

441
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,455
It is to be expected,
living in such close quarters.

442
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:36,334
Sir, for the last three years, you have
seized much of my inheritance.

443
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:40,004
Hold your tongue, lest you make
a claim you cannot retract.

444
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:44,050
I was legally reimbursed for your
education and living expenses.

445
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:48,971
You suggest you be reimbursed my
estate through your daughter's bed!

446
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,348
No.

447
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,059
This is how I suggest...

448
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:56,812
...we keep your noble head
from the executioner's block.

449
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:02,193
--duly considering the causes
for which matrimony was ordained.

450
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,279
One was the procreation
of children...

451
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:09,492
...to be brought up in the fear and
nurture of the Lord and faith of God.

452
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,788
Secondly, for the mutual society,
health and comfort...

453
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:17,166
...that the one ought to have
of the other in prosperity...

454
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,545
...into the which holiest state
these two persons...

455
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,297
...here present
come now to be joined.

456
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,148
Henry the Fifth, by...

457
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,402
- ...no one?
- Why would any of you...

458
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,530
...admit to trying to better me
in historical drama?

459
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,533
Comedy, yes. Tragedy, perhaps.

460
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:56,581
Ben, waiting to see how it's received
before you lay claim?

461
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,850
O for a Muse of fire...

462
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,395
...that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention...

463
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,857
...a kingdom for a stage,
princes to act...

464
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,736
...and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene!

465
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,363
Then should the warlike Harry,
like himself...

466
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,700
...assume the port of Mars,
and at his heels...

467
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,785
...should famine, sword...

468
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,914
...and fire crouch for employment.

469
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,542
The flat unraised spirits...

470
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,130
...that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold...

471
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,508
...to bring forth so great an object:

472
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:54,388
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France?

473
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,933
Or may we cram
within this wooden O...

474
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,770
...the very casques that:

475
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,234
Suppose within the girdle
of these walls...

476
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,738
...are now confined
two mighty monarchies...

477
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,575
...whose high, upreared
and abutting fronts...

478
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,495
...the perilous narrow ocean
parts asunder.

479
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,164
Make way!

480
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,416
Piece out our imperfections
with your thoughts.

481
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,002
Into a thousand parts
divide one man...

482
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:30,341
...and make imaginary puissance.
Think when we talk of horses...

483
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:38,349
...that you see them,
printing their proud hoofs...

484
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,103
...in the receiving earth.

485
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,271
For 'tis...

486
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,024
...your thoughts...

487
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:52,113
...your thoughts that now
must deck our kings.

488
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,032
Make way!

489
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,122
This story shall the good man
teach his son.

490
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,125
And Crispin Crispian
shall ne'er go by...

491
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,545
...from this day
to the ending of the world...

492
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,881
...but we in it shall be remembered.

493
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,593
We few, we happy few...

494
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,013
...we band of brothers.

495
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,933
For he today that sheds
his blood with me...

496
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:25,104
...shall be my brother,
be he ne'er so vile...

497
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,816
...this day shall gentle his condition.

498
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,283
And gentlemen in England
now a-bed...

499
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:41,162
...shall think themselves accursed
they were not here!

500
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:46,208
And hold their manhoods cheap
whiles any speaks...

501
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:51,505
...that fought with us upon
Saint Crispin's Day!

502
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,514
My sovereign lord,
bestow yourself with speed.

503
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,933
The French are bravely
in their battles set...

504
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,352
...and will with all expedience
charge on us!

505
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,522
All things are ready,
if our minds be so!

506
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,025
Perish the man whose mind
is backward now!

507
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,818
You know your places.

508
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,613
God be with you all!

509
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,041
Francesco, do you see?!

510
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,461
Do you see?!

511
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:35,841
Kill the Frenchmen!

512
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,676
Death to the French!

513
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,933
Down with the French!
Down with the French!

514
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,938
Your sword!

515
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,357
We'll follow you!

516
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,293
Edward!

517
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,380
William Cecil convinced
the queen...

518
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,132
...that only Essex
can save Ireland from revolt.

519
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,301
I've pledged to go with him.

520
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,138
I, for one, wish to see this
anonymous colleague of ours.

521
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,808
Playwright!

522
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,810
Playwright! Playwright!

523
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,354
Playwright! Playwright! Playwright!

524
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,698
- I ask for your blessing, Edward.
- I cannot give it.

525
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:44,285
If he is to be my king,
it is my duty to be with him in battle!

526
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,207
Will?

527
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,215
Sorry to disturb your entertainment!

528
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,677
Henry!

529
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,389
Thank you. And it's all written
in verse! Thank you.

530
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,934
Got it, got it, got it!
It's just-- It's just been....

531
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,062
Only-- I--

532
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,316
I want to thank my actors...

533
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,694
...whose great, great acting...

534
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:22,698
...has brought my words to life...

535
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,243
...due to their
most wonderful acting.

536
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,872
And thank you!

537
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,552
An actor!

538
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,596
An actor, for God's sake!

539
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,183
- My lord, I thought that--
- You presume to think on my behalf?

540
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,686
My lord, your voice is
completely different from mine.

541
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:57,066
Voice? You have no voice!
That's why I chose you!

542
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,367
You....

543
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,036
You at least kept my name
from him?

544
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,376
And will continue to do so?

545
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,350
A romantic tragedy.

546
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,644
In iambic pentameter.

547
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,316
All of it? Is that possible?

548
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,235
Of course it is.

549
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,827
My lord.

550
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,209
Will Shakespeare.

551
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,671
William...

552
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,339
...Shake...

553
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,467
...Speare.

554
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,097
My lady.

555
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,189
Who was that man?
I've seen him here before.

556
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,069
Edward.

557
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,197
We must discuss
our daughter's dowry.

558
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,032
- Dowry?
- She cannot marry...

559
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,869
...without a dowry becoming to
the daughter of the Earl of Oxford.

560
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,330
I can give her Brooke House
and 100 pounds.

561
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,999
A hundred pounds, Father?
Mother?

562
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,335
That is all we have to give
at the moment.

563
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,544
Leave us, Bridget.

564
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,926
Edward, our family...

565
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,762
...is in financial ruins, and you--

566
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,639
You...

567
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,016
...play the flute while Rome burns.

568
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:39,228
Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned.

569
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,396
My God.

570
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,108
You're...

571
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,776
...writing again.

572
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,486
After you promised.

573
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,447
Anne, you should have
seen them, the mob.

574
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,784
They didn't sit there
like the reptilia of court...

575
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,787
...faces motionless,
fangs momentarily retracted.

576
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,873
No! They climbed the stage!
They fought the French!

577
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,793
Stop it! Stop this at once!

578
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,588
Why must you write?

579
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:10,175
Why must you continue
to humiliate my family?

580
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,972
The voices, Anne.

581
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,101
The voices, I can't stop them.
They come to me.

582
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:22,771
When I sleep, when I wake, when
I sup. When I walk down the hall.

583
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:27,109
The sweet longings of a maiden,
the surging ambitions of a courtier...

584
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:30,487
...the designs of a murderer,
the pleas of his victims.

585
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:35,367
Only when I put their words,
their voices, to parchment...

586
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,661
...are they cast loose, freed.

587
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,414
Only then is my mind quieted.

588
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,458
At peace.

589
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:49,339
I would go mad
if I didn't write down the voices.

590
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,177
Are you possessed?

591
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,596
Maybe I am.

592
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,099
This is incredible, Ben!

593
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,393
The whole bloody thing in verse.

594
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,396
It's really not that difficult if you try.

595
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,815
Oh, and have you ever tried?

596
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:08,984
But soft!

597
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,570
What light through
yonder window breaks?

598
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,908
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

599
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,246
I'll have little trouble
parting the legs of barmaids!

600
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,123
You cannot play Romeo.

601
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,043
What? Why not?
I'm perfect for the role.

602
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:30,297
I will not let that oaf Spencer
have another go at one of my roles!

603
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:34,301
Only Will Shakespeare can pump
the life into Romeo's veins.

604
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,179
And his codpiece. No, Ben.

605
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,599
Ben, I'm an actor.
Every inch of me...

606
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,894
...right down to my very toes.
I want to....

607
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,272
No, I crave to act.

608
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,691
So bloody well act like a writer.

609
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,110
And, for God's sake,
keep off the stage.

610
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,780
Writers do not have time to act.

611
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,708
What lady's that, which doth enrich
the hand of yonder knight?

612
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,752
I know not, sir.

613
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,677
O, she doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

614
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,013
It seems she hangs upon
the cheek of night...

615
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,433
...like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear.

616
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,605
Beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

617
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:32,567
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows...

618
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,529
...as yonder lady
o'er her fellows shows.

619
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:38,407
The measure done,
I'll watch her place of stand...

620
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,743
...and, touching hers,
make blessed my rude hand.

621
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:48,250
Did my heart love till now?
Forswear it, sight!

622
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:53,422
For I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

623
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:02,264
My Lord of Oxford.

624
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,308
- That's the Earl of Oxford.
- Majesty.

625
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,478
- Yes, and doesn't he look handsome?
- Most definitely.

626
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:12,232
We very much liked
your play tonight.

627
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,569
Your young King Henry
reminded us of you.

628
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,321
Did he?

629
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,489
Brash, yet brave.

630
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,992
A boy and yet a man.

631
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,454
Fair on the eyes.

632
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,915
Fairer to the ear.

633
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,504
We are glad of your return
from the continent.

634
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:39,259
Two years is too long without
such excellent amusements.

635
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:54,941
Had I known my absence would have
caused Your Grace so much longing...

636
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,612
...I would have returned
much, much sooner.

637
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,867
Your wife must be pleased to have
you once more present at her side.

638
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,869
It is but a small comfort to me.

639
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,539
I am returned only under
my father-in-law's insistence.

640
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:22,969
Cecil told me your match
was one of love.

641
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,971
So he would wish.

642
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,478
But how could one love the moon
after having seen the sun?

643
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:41,154
Which country did you like the best
on your travels, my lord?

644
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,697
Italy, Your Grace.

645
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,411
Italy. And why is that?

646
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,413
The weather? Or the food?

647
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,040
No, no. Their theater...

648
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,543
...which they call
la commedia dell'arte.

649
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,545
And, of course...

650
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,380
...the women.

651
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,009
The women?

652
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,846
They were more clear...

653
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:11,726
...with their desires. When they
want something, they take it.

654
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,397
They do not wait to be taken.

655
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,971
I can't decide.

656
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:52,809
Are you Prince Hal?

657
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,646
Or Romeo?

658
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:07,782
No.

659
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,576
You're Puck.

660
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,787
- Puck?
- Yes, Puck.

661
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,502
Puck would never fight for you
in the Netherlands.

662
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,880
The Netherlands?

663
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,548
Well, why not?

664
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,386
It's an open secret you support
the rebels against Spain.

665
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,474
You are commissioning Englishmen
to help fight their cause.

666
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:34,518
Spain's loss is England's gain.

667
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:38,021
Is this why you bedded me?
For a commission?

668
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,857
- No, no, it's just--
- Leave me.

669
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:47,906
How dare you? How dare you?
I command you to leave my presence!

670
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,537
O mistress mine...

671
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,833
...where are you roaming?

672
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,879
O, stay...

673
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,215
...and hear...

674
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,718
...your true love's coming.

675
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,180
That can kiss...

676
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,224
...both high...

677
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,726
...and low.

678
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,731
No further, pretty sweeting.

679
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,736
Journeys end in lovers' meeting...

680
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,657
...every wise man's son doth know.

681
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,411
What is love?

682
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,998
'Tis not hereafter.

683
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:43,420
Present mirth hath present laughter.

684
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,593
What's to come is still unsure:

685
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,638
In delay there lies no plenty.

686
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,181
Then come...

687
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,768
...kiss me...

688
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,606
...sweet and twenty.

689
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,777
Youth's a stuff will not endure.

690
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,289
You will stay in England...

691
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,708
...and in my chambers.

692
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,460
I could do it if I wanted to.

693
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:24,794
Do what?

694
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,131
A play in bic-- In bia--

695
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,384
In iambic pentameter.
It's not that hard.

696
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,178
Think so? Have you ever tried?

697
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,388
Of course not.
But I could if I wanted.

698
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,974
Well, it wasn't all in verse.

699
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,477
You see? Even easier.

700
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:44,814
Henslowe wants Romeo
to run for a fortnight! A fortnight!

701
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,652
Innkeeper! Drinks for everybody!

702
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,488
Innkeeper! Billy!

703
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:52,906
A fortnight?

704
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,158
The maids love
the romantic tragedies.

705
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,994
Precisely why I avoid them.

706
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,998
Oh, well, worry not. A one-trick pony.
He'll never do it again.

707
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,965
How have you made division
of yourself?

708
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,009
An apple, cleft in twain...

709
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:17,514
...is not more twin than these
two creatures. Which is Sebastian?

710
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,265
Most wonderful!

711
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,202
- Great Caesar--
- Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

712
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,454
Speak, hands for me!

713
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,880
Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.

714
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,966
Tyranny is dead!

715
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:55,385
Freedom, liberty,
and enfranchisement!

716
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,304
- Death to tyranny!
- Freedom!

717
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,683
Yes! Freedom! Freedom!

718
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,312
Liberty!

719
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,067
- He was Scottish, wasn't he?
- Yeah.

720
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,405
Round about the cauldron go.

721
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,908
In the poison'd entrails throw.

722
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,746
Toad, that under cold stone...

723
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,749
...days and nights has thirty-one.

724
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,422
Double, double, toil and trouble.

725
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,424
Fire burn!

726
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,682
Beware...

727
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:47,061
...of entrance to a quarrel,
but being in...

728
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,482
...bear't that the opposed
may beware of thee.

729
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:55,278
Give every man thine ear,
but few thy voice.

730
00:51:55,446 --> 00:52:00,283
Take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgment.

731
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,704
Costly thy habit
as thy purse can buy...

732
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,582
...but not express'd in fancy:

733
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,251
Rich, not gaudy.

734
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,464
For the apparel
oft proclaims the man.

735
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,884
Come, come, and sit you down.
You shall not budge!

736
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,806
You go not till I set you up a glass...

737
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,308
...where you may see
the inmost part of you.

738
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,435
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?

739
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,647
- Help, help, ho!
- What, ho! Help!

740
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:34,567
How now! A rat?
Dead, for a ducat, dead!

741
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,371
I am slain!

742
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:47,956
O me, what hast thou done?

743
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,875
Nay, I know not. Is it the king?

744
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:56,923
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell!

745
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:00,343
Not a day too soon for Cecil!

746
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,950
To be, or not to be...

747
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,952
...that is the question.

748
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,875
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer...

749
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,044
...the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

750
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,506
...or to take arms against
a sea of troubles...

751
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,342
...and by opposing end them.

752
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,890
To die: to sleep, no more...

753
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:52,061
...and by a sleep to say we end
the heart-ache...

754
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,733
...and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to.

755
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,234
'Tis a consummation...

756
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,155
...devoutly to be wished.

757
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:04,824
To die, to sleep...

758
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:09,579
...to sleep: perchance to dream:
ay, there's the rub.

759
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:13,458
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come...

760
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:18,171
...when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil, must give us pause.

761
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:24,052
There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.

762
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,664
- Give it good heat.
- This hot enough?

763
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:52,724
You're certain of this?
William Cecil was murdered.

764
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,018
Not literally, of course.

765
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,395
He was a character.

766
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,356
Fictional character.

767
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:04,861
But the metaphor was clear
for anyone to see. And see, they did.

768
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,904
Will you shut it down?

769
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:12,618
Your service to his lordship
is once again greatly appreciated.

770
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:17,290
He butchered you! Not only in front
of court but the entire city as well!

771
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,625
We must arrest
this Shakespeare and--

772
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,128
No, Robert.

773
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:25,423
If he really is as popular
as you say...

774
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,717
...we would only anger the mob.

775
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:30,970
We cannot maintain authority
if we are laughingstocks!

776
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:35,349
Our authority comes
from Elizabeth and from God.

777
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,395
You must think
more deeply, Robert.

778
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:43,232
You must compensate
for your malformations.

779
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,570
You must compensate with the gifts
God did give you.

780
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,823
With cunning. With ruthlessness.

781
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,036
It's from...

782
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:59,499
...King James of Scotland.

783
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,298
James is aware of the queen's
affections for Essex...

784
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:11,094
...and of the rumors of his birth,
and he is justly concerned.

785
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,679
You will write to James.

786
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:18,267
You will tell him that I am gravely ill,
but that all is in hand.

787
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,439
And then tell him...

788
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:29,028
...Essex will not return
from Ireland alive.

789
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:35,993
God does indeed require
our help in this matter.

790
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,705
This is how kings are made,
my son.

791
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,293
So it was with Elizabeth,
so it shall ever be.

792
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:50,967
James will expect you to do the same
for him and he will reward you for it.

793
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,804
But we must...

794
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,974
...do one thing more.

795
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,478
Like Essex...

796
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:06,983
...Edward must be removed.

797
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,610
- Edward?
- You must bribe someone.

798
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,904
His fencing master, perhaps.

799
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:15,825
Promise him a fortune
if he kills him.

800
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,703
I am with child.

801
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:20,329
Are you certain?

802
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,332
Two cycles have passed, my lord.

803
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,669
- And I wish to marry him.
- Marry him?

804
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:30,006
Your Grace, he is already married.

805
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:33,301
I can do what I want.

806
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,178
Can you?

807
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:39,307
Most of the Catholic princes of Europe
seek to topple you...

808
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:43,186
...and end your Protestant reign.
All that stop them are the Channel...

809
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,981
...and the hope they marry you
and end your realm by other means.

810
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:49,025
I love him!

811
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,198
Would you risk your throne for him?

812
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,951
Would you risk England for him?

813
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:04,207
We must do as we have done before.
You must go on progress...

814
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:08,169
...somewhere isolated, accompanied
by only those whom you most trust.

815
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:13,299
After the birth, I shall find a suitable
house for the child to be reared in.

816
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,551
And Edward?

817
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,348
He must never know.

818
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,524
What have you done?

819
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,526
I am praying.

820
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,403
She will not see me!

821
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:38,032
I've gone to her, she will not
receive me, and now she's gone!

822
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,034
She is on progress.

823
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,577
Where?

824
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,205
Where did she go?

825
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,791
What did you say to her?

826
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:49,752
She does not ask my advice
on matters of the heart.

827
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,088
If she did, she would not
have chosen you.

828
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,423
You must've known
she would go elsewhere.

829
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,426
You're neither the first nor the last
of her lovers!

830
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,430
Go back to my daughter, Edward.

831
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,851
She will accept you with open arms.

832
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,939
Behave as your great title
demands you behave.

833
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,067
Tend to your estates,
your investments.

834
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,696
And make me a grandson.

835
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,283
An heir.

836
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:37,591
It's difficult to write, is it not?

837
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,219
After something like Hamlet?

838
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,388
It eats at you.

839
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,557
At your soul.

840
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:50,771
Why do you think Will
hasn't been arrested?

841
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,526
He murders a caricature
of old William Cecil himself...

842
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:59,405
...and still whores it all the way
to Westminster and back.

843
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:03,159
- Perhaps they haven't noticed.
- I made sure they did.

844
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,662
You informed on one of your own?
To the Tower?

845
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,956
Watch who you judge, Ben.

846
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:13,669
We do what we have to to survive
and survive well in this life. All of us.

847
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,630
And Will is definitely not one of us.

848
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,471
You know he's illiterate, don't you?

849
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:27,600
Oh, he can read well enough.
How else could he learn his lines?

850
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:32,355
But the man never actually learned
to form his letters.

851
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:35,483
So who did write Hamlet?

852
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,444
A nobleman.

853
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:43,908
Yes, but which?
You know, don't you, Ben?

854
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,410
Careful, Kit.

855
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:49,538
You sound like one of your plays.

856
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:58,214
Ben! Tell me.
We can go to him together.

857
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,049
Guarantee his anonymity.

858
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,010
For a price.

859
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:07,807
You reported on me as well,
didn't you, Kit?

860
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,725
Last year. For Every Man.

861
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,521
That's why I was arrested.
Wasn't it?

862
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,148
I had nothing to do with that.

863
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,068
Ben. I'll just go to Will.

864
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:22,905
And he'll tell me because he has
so much more to lose than you.

865
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,410
And you'll profit nothing from it.

866
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,078
Nothing.

867
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,671
Rebels have stripped
the northern borders.

868
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:44,093
Then we must march south
and take Cahir Castle.

869
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,763
My lord,
it is a well-defended fortress.

870
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,306
Holy Mary, mother of God.

871
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,935
A thousand men, maybe more.
We cannot attack such a force.

872
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:57,690
So, what would you have me do?
Spend the entire spring encamped?

873
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:02,278
I am sent to Ireland to end
this infernal rebellion, not to idle--

874
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,612
Robert!

875
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,081
Must have been a cutpurse.

876
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:17,835
Nowhere is bloody safe anymore,
I'll tell you that.

877
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,462
What's happened?

878
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,130
Dead body.

879
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,467
Now my tooth hurts.

880
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,055
The stench. He's done.

881
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,059
- It's that playwright.
- Kit Marlowe.

882
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,312
- It's not right.
- No, it's not.

883
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:59,001
What's going on, Beaulieu?

884
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,761
Stop it!

885
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:10,888
Beaulieu!

886
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,557
Francesco.

887
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,725
He tried to kill me.

888
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,355
The mighty Sampson!

889
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,733
What a beast!
Have you seen his claws?

890
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,569
I need more money.

891
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,572
You already make more
than any playwright Bankside.

892
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:14,827
I want to build my own theater. One
that properly fits the scale of my work.

893
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:16,912
A theater? For your work?

894
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,999
I've found someone
who will make me a coat of arms...

895
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,751
- ...and change the Stratford lists.
- Impossible.

896
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,878
Eight shillings on six dogs!

897
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,590
I'll take that bet.
Eight shillings on the bear.

898
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:30,175
That's a terrible bet, Ben!

899
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:34,346
Make do with what you've got, Will.
I won't be your beggar.

900
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:38,601
Oh, no. This isn't a request, Ben.
I'll have more money.

901
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:42,521
Or what? You'll slit my throat,
like you did Kit's?

902
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:47,443
I know he went to you last night
and was planning to expose you...

903
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:50,321
- ...if you didn't agree to his terms.
- You're mad.

904
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,364
So terrifying!

905
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:53,949
Be careful, Will.

906
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:58,078
Kill me off, you won't have any good
plays to act in after this is done.

907
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,080
I'll have my guineas, Ben.

908
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,457
One way or another...

909
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:06,754
- ...I will have my guineas.
- Unleash the dogs!

910
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,051
Go on, bear!

911
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:18,766
Thank you. Drink up, Francesco.
Another one where that came from.

912
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,811
Francesco?

913
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:24,813
Two this time.

914
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,399
- When shall I return?
- In a fortnight.

915
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:44,917
Over there.

916
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:47,670
Just pull in there.

917
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,505
- Listen.
- Yes, master.

918
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,257
- When you cut my roses, be gentle.
- Yes, master.

919
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,804
Yes, master.

920
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,483
My lord.

921
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:17,074
So you are the famous
William Shakespeare...

922
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:20,035
...whose labors I have so enjoyed.

923
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,540
I am at your service, sir.

924
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,209
- I need more money.
- I beg your pardon?

925
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:30,879
My lord, my expenses
have enlarged.

926
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,633
Aggrandized. Since all this began.

927
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,220
- Aggrandized?
- Yeah, aggrandized. And...

928
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:44,226
...if your lordship does not agree
to an increase in my fee...

929
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:49,064
...then I shall be forced
to make certain facts public.

930
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,192
Hey. Have you any idea
to whom you are speaking?

931
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,696
I am addressing
the writer of Hamlet.

932
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,243
And of Juliet and her Romeo.
Am I not?

933
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:04,580
Out. Get out.

934
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,415
As you wish.

935
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,252
My lord.

936
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:16,049
Wait.

937
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,384
How much?

938
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,430
Four hundred pounds.

939
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,266
A year.

940
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,687
No, pay him.

941
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,277
Come.

942
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,459
Is this wise?

943
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,504
They have already tried
to kill you once.

944
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,339
Wisdom...

945
01:08:55,965 --> 01:09:01,136
...Francesco, is a quality I have
unfortunately never possessed.

946
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:27,162
Edward? You know I will
have to leave court soon.

947
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,966
She will be furious
if she finds out about this.

948
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,676
She abandoned me.

949
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:42,845
She still loves you.

950
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,264
No, she doesn't.

951
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,935
You don't know...

952
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,854
...do you?

953
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,816
The queen...

954
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,443
...she had your child.

955
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,385
My Lady of Oxford, welcome home.

956
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,737
I cannot be certain, Your Majesty...

957
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,031
...when the relationship began.

958
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,242
But sometime soon after
your return to court.

959
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,411
You are sure?

960
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,248
They have not been very discreet.

961
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,420
There is more, Your Majesty.

962
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,676
The lady is pregnant.

963
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,349
Arrest them.

964
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,936
Arrest them both.

965
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,610
- What is the meaning of this?
- Edward!

966
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,445
Unhand me! Bessie!

967
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,238
- Edward!
- Bessie!

968
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:26,865
Edward!

969
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,714
Your whore gave birth last week.

970
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,723
The queen has decided
to release you.

971
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,895
Time does indeed, it seems,
heal all wounds.

972
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,856
Here are the conditions
for your release.

973
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:03,902
One, you will not
acknowledge the child.

974
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,697
Two, you will never see
the mother again.

975
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:10,200
Three, you will avoid court
at all costs.

976
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,286
Her Majesty would prefer
never to be reminded of you...

977
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,123
...in any way ever again.

978
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,332
Banished.

979
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:22,337
No, you have the freedom
of the kingdom, just not of the court.

980
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,506
Those are her terms. Here are mine.

981
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:28,301
Go back to my daughter.
Make some effort to make her happy.

982
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,971
Finally act according
to your station in life...

983
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:35,225
...and accept the responsibilities
of your great title.

984
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:40,939
My lord?

985
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,358
I, too, have a condition.

986
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:50,699
I will go back to your daughter...

987
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,244
...if you tell me the name
of the child.

988
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,458
I do not think the whore
has named the bastard.

989
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,876
No.

990
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,627
The other one.

991
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,217
The other one?

992
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,014
Who told you?

993
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,975
I will go back to your daughter.

994
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:22,522
I will give you as many grandchildren
as she can bear, or I can remain here.

995
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:25,317
There is no record of the true birth...

996
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:29,988
...nor any trail that leads back to you
or the queen. The foster parents...

997
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,741
...never knew the truth
and both now are dead.

998
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,743
The name.

999
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:39,414
Make even a hint of this
to the child or anyone else...

1000
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,626
...and this agreement is void,
and I will see your head...

1001
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:45,587
...and the head of the boy
on the block!

1002
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,174
So it's a boy.

1003
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,597
Good. Sword up. Again.

1004
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,482
Keep it high.
Mind your knee. Straight.

1005
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,485
Hello.

1006
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:12,114
- My lord.
- I'm Edward, the Earl of Oxford.

1007
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:13,865
My lord.

1008
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,118
They say you're an earl as well.

1009
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,703
I am the Earl of Southampton.

1010
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,585
Well, then. We shall be earls together,
shall we not?

1011
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:37,305
In the sweat of thy face, shalt thou
eat bread till thou return to the earth...

1012
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,266
...for from it wast thou taken...

1013
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:45,397
...because thou art dust,
and to dust thou shalt return.

1014
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,613
We wish to recall Essex.

1015
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:58,326
We feel a terrible void
without your father.

1016
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,954
A wise decision, Your Majesty.

1017
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:04,583
It will give him an opportunity
to respond to these reports.

1018
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:09,963
They say Essex is in peace
negotiations with Philip of Spain.

1019
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,299
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

1020
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:15,343
And that Essex has
promised Philip...

1021
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,971
...all of Catholic Ireland in return.

1022
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,515
In return for what?

1023
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:24,811
Spain's support of Essex's claim
to the throne of England.

1024
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,856
It is, as of yet...

1025
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,858
...just rumor.

1026
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,862
Bring Essex back to London,
William.

1027
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,865
Robert, Majesty.

1028
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:43,288
My father's death has been
a great loss for us all, Your Majesty.

1029
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,293
A curse on you, Robert Cecil!

1030
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:49,961
Leave the people alone!

1031
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:51,504
Down with the hunchback!

1032
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,220
See that it's done.

1033
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,731
My lord. From the queen.

1034
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:32,379
It's Robert Cecil. He failed to kill you,
now he tries to kill your name.

1035
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,340
I must speak to her. Myself.

1036
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,051
We leave with the tide.

1037
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,096
Boys! My boys!

1038
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:43,848
I've got it.

1039
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,103
The herald just finished it
about an hour ago.

1040
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,522
- What do you think?
- It's quite colorful?

1041
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,692
Well, what in God's name is it?

1042
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,026
My coat of arms.

1043
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:59,322
It cost a fortune,
but you can call me a gentleman now!

1044
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:02,284
I can't quite make out the motto.

1045
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,542
- "Not Without...."
- Right.

1046
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,629
"Not without right"?

1047
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,464
You....

1048
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,009
You went to him, didn't you?

1049
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:23,305
- You lying knave. You went to him.
- Can I get you a drink? Billy!

1050
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,473
Will isn't even a writer.

1051
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,642
- He can't even--
- Yeah, all right.

1052
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,894
No, get-- Unhand me!

1053
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:33,773
Here!

1054
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:35,984
A quill?

1055
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,574
Write something for us.

1056
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,410
Amaze us with your verse.

1057
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,746
Your wit.

1058
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,956
No? Well....

1059
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:53,418
Try astounding us with the letter E.

1060
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,421
Or an I?

1061
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,257
It's just a straight line.

1062
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,437
Well, you haven't got any ink.

1063
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:45,553
My lords--

1064
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,847
- Wait for me!
- Please, my lords!

1065
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,851
Your Majesty.

1066
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,187
Are you--?

1067
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,566
Get out. Get out.

1068
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,902
- Get out!
- Get out!

1069
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:11,413
He burst in! Armed.

1070
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,585
Is it an uprising? Is it a revolt?

1071
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:21,297
- Shall I order his arrest, Majesty?
- Yes, yes. No, no.

1072
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:24,300
I don't know. I don't know.

1073
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,095
What does he want?

1074
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,310
Has he gone mad?

1075
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,770
No.

1076
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,732
Unfortunately for us, Your Majesty,
he is quite sane.

1077
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:44,737
He simply believes
he is your royal equal.

1078
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,760
Edward! Halt!

1079
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:11,473
Edward, thank God you're here.

1080
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:16,144
Elizabeth has revoked
all of his royal licenses.

1081
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:20,773
Confiscated his property. She believes
every lie Cecil tells about him.

1082
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:25,153
Fight him in London
and you prove true...

1083
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:29,282
...every rumor and every lie
Cecil has ever told.

1084
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:32,202
Then what do you suggest I do?!

1085
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,497
- Let myself be arrested?
- No.

1086
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,458
No.

1087
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,461
I will visit Elizabeth myself.

1088
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,421
Alone.

1089
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:45,965
How?

1090
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,844
Cecil will not let her see a letter
without reading it first.

1091
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,096
I will not send a letter.

1092
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,851
I will send a book.

1093
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,605
She will call for me.

1094
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:05,443
While I am with her, you will come
not with an army or swords...

1095
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,362
...but with her loyal subjects.

1096
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,991
The tinkers, the cobblers,
the bricklayers of London.

1097
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,994
A mob. All of them, all of them...

1098
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:19,207
...calling for Robert Cecil to be
banished from the court.

1099
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,461
Words.

1100
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:29,717
Words will prevail with Elizabeth.

1101
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:31,803
Not swords.

1102
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:34,722
And how do you suggest
I raise this mob?

1103
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,642
Leave that to me.

1104
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,585
Oh, Will, Will!

1105
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:08,339
Hey!

1106
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,010
Hold your tongue, putana,
and get out.

1107
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,636
Out.

1108
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,639
Who's gonna pay me, then?

1109
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:22,562
What's all this about?

1110
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:28,610
Begin rehearsals immediately. It must
not be performed until I tell you...

1111
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,112
...and you may only have
a day's notice.

1112
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,908
Well, that will be expensive,
keeping all the actors ready...

1113
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:38,411
...and having props made cheaply.
All right.

1114
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,623
Oh, and congratulations.

1115
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,294
You've had a poem
published today.

1116
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,463
Published?

1117
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,466
What, do you mean like in a book?

1118
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,143
She trembles at his tale

1119
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:06,314
And on his neck
Her yoking arms she throws:

1120
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:11,319
She sinketh down
Still hanging by his neck

1121
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:14,113
He on her belly falls

1122
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:17,659
She on her back.

1123
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,827
I like this.

1124
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:25,333
'Fondling,' she saith, 'I'll be a park
And thou shalt be my deer

1125
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,669
Feed where thou wilt....'

1126
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:31,339
Seeds spring from seeds
And beauty breedeth beauty

1127
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,341
Thou wast begot

1128
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,968
To beget is thy duty.

1129
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:40,431
By law of nature
Thou art bound to breed--

1130
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:57,699
Majesty.

1131
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,537
How do you find me?

1132
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,623
You....

1133
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,794
You are the sun, Majesty.

1134
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:13,840
- The glory--
- Liar.

1135
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,136
It is hard to believe
that once I was young.

1136
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:21,431
I was beautiful.

1137
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,809
Your father knew me as such.

1138
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,396
Have you read...

1139
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,231
...the book?

1140
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,401
He writes to me.

1141
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:37,405
To remind me of that beauty.
That love.

1142
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:42,410
How I took him. How I adored him.

1143
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:47,582
Did your father tell you of the child?

1144
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:52,044
Which one, Your Majesty?

1145
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,089
Edward's and mine.

1146
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,092
He still lives?

1147
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,598
Is he well placed? A nobleman?

1148
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:07,059
Yes, Your Majesty.

1149
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:08,811
Who?

1150
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:12,982
I am your queen. Who is my son?

1151
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:17,737
The Earl of Southampton,
Your Majesty.

1152
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:23,785
Majesty, you are not having doubts
about James of Scotland--

1153
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,620
James.

1154
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:29,499
The son of Mary.

1155
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,126
She tried to take my throne.

1156
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,922
No son of hers will ever rule.

1157
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:41,260
I'll decide what is best for my people.
Not you.

1158
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,806
I have bid Edward to come to me...

1159
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,434
...when I return to London
on Monday next. It is decided.

1160
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:06,077
And so, in spite of death

1161
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:09,163
I shall survive

1162
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:12,834
In that my likeness

1163
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,628
Still is left alive.

1164
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:32,728
--love's majesty to strut
before a wanton ambling nymph.

1165
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:38,943
I, that am curtailed
of this fair proportion...

1166
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,904
...cheated of feature
by dissembling nature...

1167
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:44,490
...deformed, unfinish'd...

1168
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:49,537
...sent before my time
into this breathing world...

1169
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:54,667
...and that so lamely
and unfashionable...

1170
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:57,962
...that dogs bark at me--

1171
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,673
Come on, Burbage.

1172
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,218
I'll be arrested.

1173
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:05,887
Arrested?

1174
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,680
It's just the one performance.

1175
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:09,515
I need a drink.

1176
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:13,102
I'll be at the Mermaid.
I'll be back in a minute.

1177
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:15,521
You left the hump on.

1178
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:16,731
Burbage.

1179
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,817
Wonderful theater. Wonderful.

1180
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:24,238
So only one performance, then?
That bad, is it?

1181
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,699
Hardly. That's Will's new play.

1182
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,162
Richard the Third. We've been hired
to perform it free to the public.

1183
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,997
- Free?
- Aye.

1184
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:36,167
Some anonymous nobleman's
paid for everything.

1185
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:37,919
Been rehearsing all week.

1186
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,421
So....

1187
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,673
My best so far.

1188
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,887
I'm sorry, Ben.

1189
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:53,684
Will, he's part owner, and....

1190
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,354
I'm sorry, Ben...

1191
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,397
...but I had to agree.

1192
01:27:58,565 --> 01:28:01,943
No Jonson plays at the Globe.

1193
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:04,070
Ever.

1194
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,625
Drink.

1195
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:21,212
Best villain in theater history,
Richard Ill.

1196
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,965
- Better than Mephistopheles?
- No doubt.

1197
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:27,635
Jonson's not bad for everyday
scalawags, but Shakespeare....

1198
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:32,306
My God, the main knows his villains.
Not even the Greeks compare.

1199
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,226
To Shakespeare!

1200
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:37,228
And villainy.

1201
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,981
To Shakespeare and villainy!

1202
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,403
- Try your luck.
- Thanks.

1203
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:49,448
Fancy a tumble? Only tuppence.

1204
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,951
Wet in all the wrong places.

1205
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:56,414
- I haven't got all night, Jonson.
- I....

1206
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,501
There is a....

1207
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:07,383
There is a play to be performed...

1208
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:08,843
...on Monday.

1209
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,679
All Bankside is talking of it.

1210
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,098
The Tragedy
of King Richard the Third...

1211
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,183
...by William Shakespeare.

1212
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:21,605
He kills the king and half
the royal family to get the throne.

1213
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,191
I know who Richard Ill was.

1214
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:25,609
Yes.

1215
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:30,364
But in William Shakespeare's
version...

1216
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,992
...he is played as a hunchback.

1217
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:40,833
As a what?

1218
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:02,396
Shall I close the theater?

1219
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,483
No.

1220
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,248
Pray, stand back!

1221
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:25,252
The theater is full!
There is no more room!

1222
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:29,799
The theater is full!

1223
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:40,226
- You can't get through the crowds.
- We've turned hundreds away.

1224
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,394
Never seen anything like it.

1225
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:45,606
And you said I was mad
for building a bigger theater.

1226
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,623
- Has Francesco left?
- Yes, my lord.

1227
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:07,044
Now is the winter
of our discontent...

1228
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:11,215
...made glorious summer
by this sun of York.

1229
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,633
He's got a hunchback.

1230
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:16,804
And all the clouds that
loured upon our house...

1231
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:20,474
...in the deep bosom of the ocean.

1232
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,143
It's Cecil, isn't it?

1233
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:26,897
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths...

1234
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:29,984
...our bruised arms hung up
for monuments...

1235
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:33,988
...our stern alarums
changed to merry meetings...

1236
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:37,992
...our dreadful marches
to delightful measures.

1237
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:42,079
Grim-visaged war hath
smoothed his wrinkled front.

1238
01:31:43,165 --> 01:31:48,169
But I, that am not shaped
for sportive tricks...

1239
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:52,506
...nor made to court
an amorous looking glass.

1240
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:55,634
I, that am rudely stamped...

1241
01:31:55,802 --> 01:31:59,597
...and want love's majesty
to strut before...

1242
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:02,433
...a wanton ambling nymph.

1243
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:07,188
I, that am curtailed
of this fair proportion...

1244
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:12,443
...cheated of feature
by dissembling nature...

1245
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:14,612
...deformed, unfinish'd...

1246
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:18,866
...sent before my time
into this breathing world...

1247
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:20,701
...scarce half made up...

1248
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:25,539
...and that so lamely
and unfashionable...

1249
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:29,335
...that dogs bark at me--

1250
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:36,050
Hear this! Hear this!

1251
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:40,387
By order of the Privy Council, the
bridge must be cleared immediately!

1252
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:44,058
Anyone resisting will be
taken to the Tower!

1253
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:46,644
Clear the bridge! Clear the bridge!

1254
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:51,649
Nothing rash. No man
is to draw sword or fire musket...

1255
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,901
- ...without direct order.
- Yes, my lord.

1256
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:56,403
And the mob? When does it arrive?

1257
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,572
By the stroke of 4.

1258
01:32:59,366 --> 01:33:01,075
The streets are quiet.

1259
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:03,077
They are all at the theater.

1260
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:08,582
Edward promised us a mob,
and a mob we will have.

1261
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:12,586
I am determined to prove a villain--

1262
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:14,588
A pox on you!

1263
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,423
A pox on Cecil!

1264
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,759
Why is Oxford's man
with the groundlings?

1265
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,427
- Where?
- There.

1266
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,389
--and hate the idle pleasures
of these days.

1267
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:26,100
Plots have I laid,
inductions dangerous...

1268
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:31,063
...by drunken prophecies, libels,
and dreams, to set the--

1269
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:33,774
To set my brother Clarence
and the king....

1270
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,276
What's going on?

1271
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:16,150
Me lord?

1272
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,153
Her Majesty will be with you shortly.

1273
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:22,531
Young, valiant and wise
and no doubt right--

1274
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:26,118
Down with Cecil!

1275
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:29,121
- Richard!
- Get over here!

1276
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:31,290
Off to Stratford, then.

1277
01:34:31,458 --> 01:34:32,583
To Essex House!

1278
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:35,461
- To Essex House!
- We want Essex!

1279
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,504
Oh, my God.

1280
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:40,507
- Essex! Essex!
- Francesco!

1281
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:42,634
To Essex House!

1282
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,678
I have to warn him!

1283
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:46,597
Francesco!

1284
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:48,182
The Tower!

1285
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:49,767
Francesco!

1286
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,771
Francesco! The Tower knows!

1287
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:55,606
How do you think it ends?

1288
01:34:55,857 --> 01:34:57,191
No doubt, tragically.

1289
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:02,529
- Join us!
- Francesco!

1290
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:04,615
Essex! Essex! Essex!

1291
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:07,993
For Essex! And England!

1292
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:11,205
Francesco! I went to the Tower!

1293
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,046
To your positions!

1294
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,132
Make ready!

1295
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,728
Open fire!

1296
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,273
Fire!

1297
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:44,655
Go back!

1298
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,996
- Francesco!
- Signor Jonson!

1299
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:55,165
We are betrayed!

1300
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:56,750
No!

1301
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,433
Robert, wait.

1302
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,685
No more waiting.

1303
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:18,021
We go as we are now.

1304
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,857
Mount your horses.

1305
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,567
Mount your horses!

1306
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:23,861
On your horses, everyone!

1307
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:29,032
To the queen!

1308
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,318
It's a trap!

1309
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,570
Spread out!

1310
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:07,779
Fire!

1311
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,282
Freedom!

1312
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,076
Fire at will!

1313
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:22,669
Fireworks?

1314
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:33,055
Majesty! We must away.
Essex is in armed revolt.

1315
01:37:33,223 --> 01:37:35,516
- He's come to overthrow you.
- But, Edward--

1316
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:39,520
You must flee quickly, Majesty.
He means to kill you...

1317
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:41,939
...and take the throne for himself.

1318
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,524
Please, Majesty!

1319
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:45,859
Your Majesty!

1320
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:55,702
Robert!

1321
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,664
The men!

1322
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:00,666
We must yield!

1323
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,626
We yield!

1324
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:04,002
Hold your fire!

1325
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,879
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

1326
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:07,839
Deliver up your arms!

1327
01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:15,180
Put down your arms.

1328
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,015
Keep still!

1329
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,435
Lay down your muskets.

1330
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,563
We yield.

1331
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,066
Yield, sir!

1332
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:40,664
She will not forgive him this,
Edward.

1333
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,085
Essex will be convicted...

1334
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,754
...and executed...

1335
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,257
...for treason.

1336
01:38:52,218 --> 01:38:54,052
As will your son.

1337
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,599
What?

1338
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:01,393
Didn't you think I knew?

1339
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:07,357
My father told me all his secrets.
All of them.

1340
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:10,611
Though the most fascinating...

1341
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,448
...was not made known to me
until after his death.

1342
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:18,910
He hated you, Edward.

1343
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:22,456
But still, he married
his only daughter to you.

1344
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:26,293
He wanted his grandson
to be an earl.

1345
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:29,880
No, Edward.
He wanted his grandson to be...

1346
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:31,089
...a king.

1347
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:38,138
Elizabeth had several
bastard children, Edward.

1348
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:41,099
Not just Essex and Southampton.

1349
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:44,645
She was 16 for the first.

1350
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:50,567
Bloody Mary was still queen and our
future Gloriana was out of favor.

1351
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:55,489
No one thought her very important
at all, except my father, of course.

1352
01:39:55,657 --> 01:39:58,075
And when her first child was born...

1353
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,078
...a male...

1354
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:05,082
...my father took it and hid it.

1355
01:40:06,668 --> 01:40:09,086
The grandson of Henry Vlll.

1356
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:13,965
The foundling, of course,
had to be reared a nobleman.

1357
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,931
John de Vere...

1358
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:24,267
...the previous Earl of Oxford...

1359
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,604
...agreed to accept the task.

1360
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:29,147
You lie!

1361
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:31,024
Do I?

1362
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:36,530
Why did he work so hard to become
your guardian after your father died?

1363
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:41,618
He had it all planned.
Years in advance.

1364
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:45,205
He would teach you everything
he knew about statecraft...

1365
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:50,502
...marry you to his daughter, and after
Elizabeth's death, proclaim you...

1366
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,046
...heir.

1367
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:57,134
His own grandchild to follow you
on the throne.

1368
01:40:57,301 --> 01:41:02,305
But he could not possibly predict what
kind of failure you would become!

1369
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:06,727
How you would fail in politics!

1370
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:10,772
Ignore your estates
to the point of bankruptcy.

1371
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:14,568
All to write...

1372
01:41:18,573 --> 01:41:20,073
...poetry.

1373
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:30,584
Nor could he have predicted
that you would commit incest.

1374
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:40,218
Delicious, isn't it?

1375
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:42,721
Right out of a Greek...

1376
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:45,599
...tragedy.

1377
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:49,770
Elizabeth...

1378
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,940
- ...would never have--
- What?

1379
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,444
Slept with her son?

1380
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:02,407
I don't think she ever knew,
to tell you the truth.

1381
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:06,203
Though you never know
with the Tudors.

1382
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:11,625
They all have had such strange
tastes in bedfellows.

1383
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:18,465
You could have been
a king, Edward.

1384
01:42:20,009 --> 01:42:22,010
And your son after you.

1385
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,805
Except for the fact...

1386
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:26,848
...that you...

1387
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:29,309
...were you.

1388
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:29,327
Sentence has been passed.

1389
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,499
They are to be beheaded.

1390
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:40,505
Essex tomorrow.
Southampton in a week.

1391
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:45,218
Your son is going to be killed...

1392
01:43:47,513 --> 01:43:49,180
...by his own mother.

1393
01:43:51,017 --> 01:43:53,351
Put that in one of your plays.

1394
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:04,112
Robert Devereaux...

1395
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,657
...Earl of Essex,
is hereby executed...

1396
01:44:07,825 --> 01:44:12,162
...for treason by Her Gracious Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth...

1397
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:15,999
...on the 25th day of February
in the year of our Lord...

1398
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:18,251
...1601.

1399
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:27,302
Strike true.

1400
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:34,100
God save the queen!

1401
01:45:06,342 --> 01:45:07,842
Leave us.

1402
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,053
All of you.

1403
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:15,600
Sir Robert...

1404
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:17,644
...you as well.

1405
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:33,660
You look old.

1406
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:37,330
I thank Your Majesty for seeing me.

1407
01:45:38,457 --> 01:45:40,000
You cannot have him.

1408
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:41,334
He is our son.

1409
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:43,294
He is a traitor, like Essex.

1410
01:45:43,462 --> 01:45:46,214
They only wished for a voice
equal to their birth.

1411
01:45:46,382 --> 01:45:49,009
You caused this.
Your play, your words.

1412
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:50,927
I know what you've done.

1413
01:45:51,804 --> 01:45:53,972
Your head should be cut off, not his.

1414
01:46:02,314 --> 01:46:03,648
Then take it...

1415
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:06,151
...in our son's stead.

1416
01:46:12,324 --> 01:46:15,035
Neither they nor I
conspired against you.

1417
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,162
Cecil alone was our aim!

1418
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:20,540
The King of Spain, Mary,
four French kings, eight popes...

1419
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:24,627
...they all wanted me dead,
but here I am...

1420
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:27,464
...because of the Cecils,
my commoners.

1421
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:29,174
We would have protected you.

1422
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:31,843
You? My loyal earls?

1423
01:46:33,137 --> 01:46:35,221
I could only ever trust the Cecils...

1424
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:39,476
...because their wealth, their power,
their survival, all depended on me.

1425
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:40,685
Me.

1426
01:46:41,812 --> 01:46:43,313
Let...

1427
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:47,567
...our son live.

1428
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:54,824
Does...?

1429
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:58,244
Does he know?

1430
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:03,333
And if I give him to you...?

1431
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,424
He will never learn of it from me.

1432
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,300
But, Edward?

1433
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:59,514
None of your poems...

1434
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:01,724
...or your plays...

1435
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:04,978
...will ever carry your name.

1436
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:07,856
None.

1437
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:26,541
- Is she still refusing to sleep?
- For three days now.

1438
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:29,252
And her physicians?

1439
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:31,588
They say she's dying.

1440
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:54,944
Majesty?

1441
01:48:55,404 --> 01:48:58,865
I have brought you
a document to sign.

1442
01:49:05,456 --> 01:49:08,208
The Act of Succession.

1443
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:19,010
I beseech you...

1444
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:21,429
...sign.

1445
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:59,092
O God, bless this crown...

1446
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:01,928
...and sanctify
King James of Scotland...

1447
01:50:02,096 --> 01:50:06,307
...now and forever more
as King James the First of England...

1448
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:10,144
...Scotland, Wales and Ireland.

1449
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:29,122
God save the king!

1450
01:51:06,118 --> 01:51:07,994
No, no, no, stop!

1451
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:10,413
It's supposed to be
a bloody comedy.

1452
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:12,749
You lot are about as funny
as the plague.

1453
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,375
Will!

1454
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:17,295
- Will Shakespeare!
- Hello, Ben.

1455
01:51:17,463 --> 01:51:21,132
A command performance
for our new king!

1456
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,760
Fraud! Charlatan!

1457
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:27,513
A counterfeiter of wit!

1458
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:33,144
You came to me, Ben.

1459
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:37,065
You came to me.

1460
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:42,278
- Will! You're nothing but a puppet!
- Get out!

1461
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:44,405
Stay out!

1462
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:47,158
Master Jonson?

1463
01:51:48,369 --> 01:51:50,328
His lordship is asking for you.

1464
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:01,839
Excuse me, my lady.

1465
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:24,612
Thank you, doctor.

1466
01:52:29,785 --> 01:52:31,244
Jonson.

1467
01:52:31,787 --> 01:52:33,329
Come closer.

1468
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:48,428
Did you know my family can trace...

1469
01:52:48,595 --> 01:52:52,265
...its peerage back further than
any other family in the kingdom?

1470
01:52:53,475 --> 01:52:58,146
We fought at Crecy,
at Bosworth Field, at Agincourt.

1471
01:52:59,982 --> 01:53:01,607
When I inherited my earldom...

1472
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:05,653
...I was one of the richest men
ever to breathe English air.

1473
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:09,157
And at last breath,
I shall be one of the poorest.

1474
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:12,827
Never a voice in government.

1475
01:53:13,996 --> 01:53:17,707
Never a sword raised
in glorious battle.

1476
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,626
Words.

1477
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:25,798
Merely words shall be
my sole legacy.

1478
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:31,387
You alone watch my plays
and know them as mine.

1479
01:53:32,181 --> 01:53:34,182
When I hear the applause...

1480
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:37,727
...the cheering of the audience,
the hands clapping...

1481
01:53:37,895 --> 01:53:40,521
...I know they are celebrating
another man.

1482
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:44,192
But in that...

1483
01:53:45,486 --> 01:53:49,697
...cacophony of sounds,
I strained to hear two hands only.

1484
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:52,200
Yours.

1485
01:53:53,202 --> 01:53:55,369
But hear them, I never did.

1486
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:00,708
You have never told me....

1487
01:54:03,378 --> 01:54:04,795
Never...

1488
01:54:05,714 --> 01:54:09,008
...told me what you thought
of my work.

1489
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:18,518
I find...

1490
01:54:19,228 --> 01:54:20,895
...your words...

1491
01:54:21,563 --> 01:54:23,564
...the most...

1492
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:24,941
...wondrous...

1493
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:28,236
...heard on our stage.

1494
01:54:30,072 --> 01:54:32,073
On any stage.

1495
01:54:33,408 --> 01:54:34,867
Ever.

1496
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:38,412
You...

1497
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,790
...are the soul of the age.

1498
01:55:00,936 --> 01:55:03,229
Promise me, Jonson.

1499
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:09,819
Promise you'll keep our secret safe,
that you won't expose Shakespeare.

1500
01:55:09,987 --> 01:55:12,029
- My lord--
- I've seen it in your face.

1501
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:13,781
He vexes you.

1502
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:17,535
How could he not?
But he is not your burden.

1503
01:55:19,288 --> 01:55:20,663
He is mine.

1504
01:55:31,133 --> 01:55:32,592
All my writings...

1505
01:55:35,304 --> 01:55:37,471
...my plays, my sonnets...

1506
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:42,184
...keep them safe.
Keep them from my family.

1507
01:55:42,477 --> 01:55:44,145
The Cecils.

1508
01:55:46,273 --> 01:55:48,441
Wait a few years
and then publish them.

1509
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:49,775
My lord, I....

1510
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:52,612
I am not worthy of this charge.

1511
01:55:55,616 --> 01:55:56,866
I betrayed you.

1512
01:55:57,826 --> 01:55:59,994
I told them of your--

1513
01:56:00,162 --> 01:56:05,458
I have made it my life's work to know
the character of men, Jonson.

1514
01:56:07,836 --> 01:56:09,754
I know you.

1515
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,009
You may have betrayed me...

1516
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:20,640
...but you will never
betray my words.

1517
01:56:35,489 --> 01:56:36,489
What are those?

1518
01:56:38,367 --> 01:56:40,368
These are my....

1519
01:56:41,036 --> 01:56:43,996
- My lady, your husband was--
- Get out!

1520
01:56:44,164 --> 01:56:47,333
You, your friends,
your blasphemous theater...

1521
01:56:47,501 --> 01:56:50,002
...have brought ruin and dishonor
to this family.

1522
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,504
Ruin?

1523
01:56:52,881 --> 01:56:54,215
Dishonor?

1524
01:56:55,384 --> 01:56:56,425
My lady...

1525
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:01,347
...you, your family, even I...

1526
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:03,641
...even Queen Elizabeth herself...

1527
01:57:03,809 --> 01:57:08,562
...will be remembered solely
because we had the honor to live...

1528
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:12,358
...whilst your husband
put ink to paper.

1529
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:22,702
"To the Earl of Southampton:

1530
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:28,541
The love I dedicate
to your lordship is without end...

1531
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:31,335
...whereof this pamphlet...

1532
01:57:31,503 --> 01:57:34,296
...without a superfluous moiety.

1533
01:57:35,882 --> 01:57:38,217
What I have done is yours...

1534
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,262
...what I have to do is yours.

1535
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:44,932
Being part in all I have...

1536
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,810
...devoted yours."

1537
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:01,741
I can make...

1538
01:58:02,576 --> 01:58:04,243
...all this...

1539
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:07,705
...go away, Jonson.

1540
01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:11,500
Or I can bring you so much...

1541
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:14,086
...pain.

1542
01:58:16,131 --> 01:58:17,590
Pain.

1543
01:58:19,634 --> 01:58:21,761
I know you have them.

1544
01:58:23,472 --> 01:58:25,931
All his manuscripts.

1545
01:58:27,142 --> 01:58:31,645
My sister saw you leave Oxford Stone
with them under your arm.

1546
01:58:33,482 --> 01:58:35,608
They were destroyed.

1547
01:58:37,486 --> 01:58:38,736
Burned.

1548
01:58:38,904 --> 01:58:40,279
Burned?

1549
01:58:41,782 --> 01:58:43,115
By your men.

1550
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:49,413
Every word went up in flames
when you torched the theater.

1551
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:51,832
He's lying.

1552
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,084
My lord...

1553
01:58:54,836 --> 01:58:56,796
...why would I lie?

1554
01:58:58,006 --> 01:59:00,800
He was something...

1555
01:59:00,967 --> 01:59:02,802
...I could never be.

1556
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:07,139
An undeniable perfection...

1557
01:59:07,682 --> 01:59:10,184
...that plagued my soul.

1558
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:13,312
And to him...

1559
01:59:14,189 --> 01:59:15,856
...I was nothing.

1560
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:18,901
A messenger.

1561
01:59:21,363 --> 01:59:24,615
He tells the truth.

1562
01:59:28,203 --> 01:59:29,703
Let him go.

1563
01:59:30,497 --> 01:59:31,664
Guard!

1564
01:59:33,834 --> 01:59:35,167
Release him.

1565
01:59:43,802 --> 01:59:47,263
And, Jonson?
Better him, won't you?

1566
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:50,349
Wipe his memory for all time.

1567
01:59:51,893 --> 01:59:55,521
I'm afraid that is not possible,
my lord.

1568
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:17,293
Your Majesty.

1569
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:20,004
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

1570
02:00:21,256 --> 02:00:22,339
Marvelous.

1571
02:00:24,092 --> 02:00:26,260
Marvelous, marvelous.

1572
02:00:29,264 --> 02:00:32,266
Is it not marvelous?

1573
02:01:42,462 --> 02:01:44,797
O for a Muse of fire...

1574
02:01:45,006 --> 02:01:49,259
...that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention.

1575
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:53,138
A kingdom for a stage,
princes to act...

1576
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:57,643
...and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

1577
02:01:58,561 --> 02:02:01,605
We had seen some
of this Shakespeare's plays...

1578
02:02:01,773 --> 02:02:03,857
...in Edinburgh, Sir Robert.

1579
02:02:04,025 --> 02:02:06,819
I must tell you,
we enjoyed them immensely...

1580
02:02:06,987 --> 02:02:10,614
...and look forward to seeing
many more, now that we're in London.

1581
02:02:11,032 --> 02:02:16,245
I assume you're as avid
a theater man as myself.

1582
02:02:17,205 --> 02:02:19,456
Of course, Your Majesty.

1583
02:02:19,624 --> 02:02:24,003
--that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold...

1584
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,630
...to bring forth so great an object.

1585
02:02:26,798 --> 02:02:31,260
Robert Cecil remained
the most powerful man...

1586
02:02:31,428 --> 02:02:34,221
...in the court of King James...

1587
02:02:34,514 --> 02:02:37,224
...though he couldn't prevent
the public theaters...

1588
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:40,144
...from becoming ever more popular.

1589
02:02:40,687 --> 02:02:44,064
William Shakespeare, however,
spent the remainder of his days...

1590
02:02:44,232 --> 02:02:46,525
...not in the playhouses of London...

1591
02:02:46,693 --> 02:02:50,696
...but in the small town of his birth,
Stratford-upon-Avon...

1592
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:54,533
...as a businessman
and grain merchant.

1593
02:02:54,701 --> 02:02:57,453
Ben Jonson succeeded
in his desire...

1594
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:00,456
...to be the most celebrated
playwright of his time...

1595
02:03:00,623 --> 02:03:03,792
...becoming England's
first poet laureate.

1596
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:07,171
And in 1623,
he wrote the dedication...

1597
02:03:07,338 --> 02:03:11,508
...to the collected works
of the man we call...

1598
02:03:11,676 --> 02:03:13,469
...William Shakespeare.

1599
02:03:15,055 --> 02:03:16,597
And so...

1600
02:03:17,223 --> 02:03:22,686
...though our story is finished,
our poet's is not.

1601
02:03:23,063 --> 02:03:26,774
For his monument is ever-living...

1602
02:03:26,941 --> 02:03:32,196
...made not of stone, but of verse.

1603
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:35,074
And it shall be remembered...

1604
02:03:35,241 --> 02:03:38,911
...as long as words
are made of breath...

1605
02:03:39,079 --> 02:03:41,914
...and breath of life.
