1
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,894
Take a sample of her blood,

2
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,231
and then get rid of that.
Yes, sir.

3
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,551
<i>The Umbrella Corporation thought
they'd contained the infection.</i>

4
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,010
<i>Well, they were wrong.</i>

5
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,179
<i>Raccoon City was
just the beginning.</i>

6
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,142
<i>Within weeks, the T-virus
had consumed the United States.</i>

7
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,310
<i>Within months, the world.</i>

8
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,771
<i>The virus didn't just
wipe out human life.</i>

9
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,941
<i>Lakes and rivers dried up,
forests became deserts,</i>

10
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,026
<i>and whole continents
were reduced to</i>

11
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,571
<i>nothing more than
barren wastelands.</i>

12
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:30,868
<i>Slowly but surely, the Earth
began to wither and die.</i>

13
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,884
<i>What few survivors there were
learned to keep on the move.</i>

14
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,760
<i>We avoided major cities.</i>

15
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,681
<i>If we stopped anyplace too long,
they would be drawn to us.</i>

16
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:56,393
<i>Only a few at first,
but then more and more.</i>

17
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,272
<i>A never-ending army of undead.</i>

18
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,483
<i>For those of us left,</i>

19
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,526
<i>staying on the road</i>

20
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,904
<i>seemed the only way to 
stay alive.</i>

21
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,752
<i>This is KLKB.
We have seven people here</i>

22
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,921
<i>in need of urgent
medical attention.</i>

23
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,591
<i>We need help. This is KLKB.
Can anyone hear us?</i>

24
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,344
<i>Can anyone help us? Please?</i>

25
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,122
My baby.

26
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,166
Please.

27
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,793
Please help my baby.

28
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,477
You bitch.

29
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,646
You dropped my baby.

30
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,650
"We're surrounded.

31
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,193
We need help.
Can anyone hear us?

32
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,821
Can anyone help us? Please."

33
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,698
Works every time, Mama.

34
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,867
Let's see...

35
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,953
- what else she's packing.
- Yeah.

36
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,000
What you got down there, fishy?

37
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,961
I wouldn't do that.

38
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,965
Shut your mouth!

39
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,551
Relax!
Just show the bitch.

40
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,892
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

41
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,395
Jesus Christ! He's dead!

42
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,504
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

43
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,214
Well, you'll see.

44
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,760
There you go, bitch. I wouldn't
want it to be over too fast!

45
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,565
Open the cage!

46
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,218
Let them loose.

47
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,869
Get up now!

48
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,205
That was a juicy one, huh?

49
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,976
Hey, Carlos, this is Claire.

50
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,478
- You got any smokes?
- No.

51
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,480
Like I'm supposed
to believe that.

52
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,650
Claire, would I lie to you?

53
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,912
L.J.
Claire Redfield, how can I help you?

54
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,998
- Got any smokes?
- No can do.

55
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,292
How about alternate?

56
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,378
Sorry to say
we're out of that too.

57
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,672
You gotta be shitting me. Otto?

58
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,801
Sorry, campers. Smoked
the last of it back in Salt Lake.

59
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,094
Damn.

60
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,930
<i>Yeah, people,
Damn it.</i>

61
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,932
<i>It really is the end of the world.</i>

62
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,550
- Anyone else?
- Paris facility.

63
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,261
Food supplies
down to 50 percent.

64
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,349
Six casualties. Biohazard
numbers increasing.

65
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,643
London facility.

66
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,271
Food supplies down to 28 percent.
Seventeen casualties.

67
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,857
Biohazard numbers increasing.

68
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,526
Gentlemen.

69
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,403
Dr. Isaacs.

70
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,947
How good of the
science division to join us.

71
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,992
Chairman Wesker.
I've been busy.

72
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,912
On the subject of the biohazard, what
does the science division have to report?

73
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,917
Well, we now know conclusively that
they have no real need for sustenance.

74
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,338
They hunger for flesh
but do not require it.

75
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,092
My research indicates they
could remain active for decades.

76
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,762
We're to be trapped
underground for decades?

77
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,306
What news of Project Alice?

78
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,934
Using antibodies from her blood,

79
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:02,939
I will develop a serum that will not
just combat the effects of the T-virus,

80
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,650
but potentially reverse it,

81
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:09,112
giving back these creatures
a measure of their intelligence,

82
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,409
their memories, thus curbing
their hunger for flesh.

83
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,037
You're confident you can
domesticate them?

84
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,082
They're animals, essentially.

85
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:26,171
We can train them, if we can
take away their baser instincts.

86
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,131
They'll never be human,

87
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,093
but would provide the basis
for a docile workforce.

88
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,803
We can return to the surface.

89
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,473
After months of experiments,
you have nothing to show.

90
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,974
And we are left
to rot underground.

91
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,976
Without the original
Project Alice,

92
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,686
progress
has been difficult.

93
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,898
I've been forced to replicate her
using cloned genetic models.

94
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,276
It's laborious.
The results, unpredictable.

95
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:53,156
Project Alice and the subject of
domestication is of the highest priority.

96
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,494
You will concentrate on this to
the exclusion of all other research.

97
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,496
We'll expect an updated report
within a week.

98
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,999
Simply demanding results
will not guarantee them.

99
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,668
Then perhaps we should place
someone else in charge.

100
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,172
Someone who can give us
the reassurances we require.

101
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,175
Continue with your
research, doctor,

102
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,553
while it still is
your research.

103
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,806
This meeting is adjourned.

104
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,697
Sorry about this, Stevie.

105
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,636
<i>This is Claire Redfield's
convoy, broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

106
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,596
<i>ls anybody out there?</i>

107
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,683
<i>Broadcasting for any survivors.
ls anybody out there?</i>

108
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,983
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy,
broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

109
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,735
<i>ls anybody out there?</i>

110
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,052
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.

111
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,138
Present location,
the Desert Trail Motel.

112
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,433
Broadcasting for any survivors.
ls there anybody in there?

113
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,729
Broadcasting for any survivors.
ls there anybody in there?

114
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,564
Keep trying, Mikey.

115
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,317
<i>ls there anyone alive in there?</i>

116
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,861
<i>Please respond.</i>

117
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,655
Seems quiet.
Yeah, don't they always?

118
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,533
<i>ls there anyone
alive in there? Please respond.</i>

119
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,786
Claire. Looks clear.
Shall we go in?

120
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,080
It's your call, boys.

121
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:15,418
Come on. Let's go.
Let's do it.

122
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,623
I'm gonna get me a room.

123
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,377
I'll take a waterbed,
a Jacuzzi,

124
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,712
and I'm gonna
rent me a porno.

125
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,594
<i>What happened? You two okay?</i>

126
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,262
Yeah. It's all clear.

127
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,776
Somebody need my help?

128
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,696
Aw, it's nothing.
But if you insist...

129
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,449
That's right.
So sit back and relax.

130
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,790
Spread out. Look for anything of use.
Gas, food, ammo. You know the drill.

131
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,292
You like playing rough, huh?

132
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,254
Oh, I've had worse.
I'm sure.

133
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,465
But you've always been
gentle with me, Betty.

134
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,344
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

135
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,641
So, what do we say,
dinner at my place tonight?

136
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,269
Oh, I'm there.

137
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,604
Hey, Betty! Over here!

138
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,362
This is amazing.
He knows what it is.

139
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,244
Camera.

140
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,039
You try.

141
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,590
Stand your ground.

142
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,719
My God.
Unbelievable.

143
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,239
He has memory
and reasoning skills.

144
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,867
This is incredible.
The serum works.

145
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,494
You've domesticated them.

146
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,246
You've done it.
Congratulations.

147
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,091
No, doctor! Please. No!

148
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,885
No, no, doctor. Please, no!

149
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,695
Pork and beans. I'll get some
peaches for the little one there.

150
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,154
There you go.

151
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,949
- It's asparagus.
- Thanks.

152
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,450
For you,

153
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,119
cat food.

154
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,540
Just kidding.
It's pork and beans.

155
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,918
Hey.
What's this, huh?

156
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,295
Soup. Cream of mushroom.
Bullshit.

157
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,173
I think that's pork and beans too.
Thanks, man.

158
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,134
I'll be damned.
Asparagus.

159
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,428
How do you do that?
Just one of my skills.

160
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,514
It's a dying art,
unfortunately.

161
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,641
This is, uh--
This is the last of it.

162
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:48,644
- I think it's some kind of fruit.
- Thanks, Otto.

163
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,980
Sorry,
that's all we have.

164
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,441
Fruit. You want
some fruit?

165
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,609
Fruit.
You want some fruit?

166
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,453
Did you check out
the gas station yet?

167
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,163
Yep, it's bone-dry.

168
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,624
Well, how we looking here?

169
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,503
Well, Claire, if we can run
these trucks on rust,

170
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,505
we're looking pretty good.

171
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,257
All right.

172
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,722
Hey, sweetheart.

173
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,265
Perimeter up yet?

174
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,434
It's almost done.

175
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,312
Who's out there?
Olivera.

176
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,441
Hey, Carlos.

177
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,776
Claire.

178
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,848
<i>All that smoking's
been slowing you down.</i>

179
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:40,054
<i>Get your ass in gear, old man.</i>

180
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,531
I want my perimeter up.

181
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,424
Last sentinel in place.

182
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:05,179
Perimeter's up and running.
All motion sensors online.

183
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,723
Cameras 100 percent.

184
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,814
Refried beans.
Fruit salad.

185
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,732
Oh, my favorite.

186
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,986
Storm's coming! Let's start
packing it up and move it inside.

187
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,366
- Come on, kids, let's go!
- Hurry up!

188
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,494
Get back in the bus.
Put this fire out.

189
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,242
This is Claire Redfield's convoy. Present
location, the Desert Trail Motel.

190
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,620
<i>Lat. 35, long.
114. Calling any survivors.</i>

191
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,711
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy. Present
location, the Desert Trail Motel.</i>

192
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,715
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.
Calling any survivors.</i>

193
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,866
Activate Number 87.

194
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,908
Shit.

195
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,036
Dr. Isaacs.
What is it?

196
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,997
My sensors have detected
a peak in psionic activity.

197
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,249
Both alpha and beta wave.

198
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,792
From Number 87?

199
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,378
No, the activity's not from
one of the clones.

200
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,131
It occurred outside the complex.

201
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,135
That's not possible.
My sensors were quite clear.

202
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:17,973
Massive psionic activity
was detected 15 minutes ago,

203
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,809
centered on a desert location.

204
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,749
Claire!
What?

205
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,065
What the hell?

206
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,776
Oh, God.

207
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,120
Carlos.

208
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,622
I see them.

209
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,792
Everybody stay in your trucks.

210
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,921
What's going on?

211
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,548
<i>Everyone just stay in your trucks.</i>

212
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,134
Roll up the windows
and keep quiet.

213
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,261
Okay, close the windows up.

214
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,491
What's wrong with their eyes?

215
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,453
They've been feeding
on infected flesh.

216
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,849
Fire it up. Let's get out of here.
Yeah, that's a hell of an idea.

217
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,518
Lock and load.

218
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,110
We're stuck!
Aw, hell, no, let's get out of here.

219
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,825
Let's head for the bus,
come on.

220
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:13,166
Come on! Go! Go!

221
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,544
Come on, get in!
Come on, come on, come on.

222
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,349
Claire!

223
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,686
Damn it.

224
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,980
Mikey, Carlos,
we have to evac the bus.

225
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,733
You got it.

226
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,737
Hold it! Ah! Ah!

227
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,093
- Come on, move!
- Keep moving!

228
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,610
Come on! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

229
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,945
Betty!
Go! Just go!

230
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,418
Get out of here, Betty! Go!

231
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,295
Move! Move! Move!

232
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,463
Go!

233
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,844
Betty! Betty!
L.J., hurry up!

234
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,264
Come with me!

235
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,491
Come on! Come on!
Betty! Betty!

236
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,744
No!

237
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,167
Betty!

238
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,012
Go! Go! Go!

239
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,405
Dr. Isaacs.

240
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,908
Another spike in alpha
and beta waves detected.

241
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:37,329
Forty-five percent probability
that this is Project Alice.

242
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:40,248
Triangulate. Find her location.

243
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,338
Impressive.

244
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,216
If it is her, her development
is extraordinary.

245
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:52,135
Her powers would appear to have
grown at a geometric rate

246
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,387
since her escape from
the Detroit facility.

247
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:02,187
You've made 10 trips to the surface in
the past 24 hours. All unauthorized.

248
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:06,691
Any trip to the surface, especially to
gather fresh specimens, puts my men at risk.

249
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,902
Why do you need so many
all of a sudden?

250
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,904
Isaacs!

251
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,448
My research has intensified.

252
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,956
Don't worry.
They're perfectly secure.

253
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,587
You're supposed to be
domesticating them.

254
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:29,798
Sometimes aggression
has its uses.

255
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,384
What could you possibly need
these things for?

256
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:33,885
Dr. Isaacs.

257
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,722
Specimen 87 has reached
the final stage of the test grid.

258
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,433
Perfect. Put her on the screen.

259
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,023
Good girl.

260
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,325
Is Chairman Wesker
even aware of this?

261
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,953
He knows what he needs to know.

262
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,497
You've overstepped your mark.

263
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,417
My research will change
the face of everything.

264
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,130
If you pick a side...

265
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,592
be sure it's the right one.

266
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:36,865
Hi.

267
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,867
Hey.

268
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,956
This belong to you?

269
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,834
I gave it to you last night.

270
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,378
For luck.

271
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,589
Thank you.

272
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:54,883
What's your name?

273
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,052
K-Mart.

274
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,721
It's where they found me.

275
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:02,015
Claire and the other...

276
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,683
A few years back.

277
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:07,562
Do you have another name?

278
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,731
Never liked it.

279
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:14,903
Um, everyone I knew was dead...

280
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,406
so seemed like time
for a change.

281
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,834
Anyone want to say
something?

282
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,195
Alice,
this is Claire Redfield.

283
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,448
She's the one who put this
convoy together.

284
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,283
Thank you so much
for your help.

285
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,119
Claire!

286
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,332
Excuse me. I have things
I have to attend to.

287
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,091
In the last six months,
she lost half of the convoy.

288
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:22,137
Pretty soon there'll be
more of us dead than alive.

289
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,890
Alice, what happened to you?

290
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,476
Why did you leave
after Detroit?

291
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,647
I didn't have a choice.
They were using me.

292
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,567
What do you mean?

293
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,485
They were tracking me.

294
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,738
I couldn't be around you.
Any of you.

295
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:44,117
I would've gotten you all killed.
That's why you disappeared?

296
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:48,329
Broke into an Umbrella facility
and hacked into their computers,

297
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,249
downloaded the satellite
trajectories

298
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,501
and stayed off the grid.

299
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,712
And after the world ended?

300
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:58,381
Why stay out there alone?

301
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:04,137
It's just safer
if I'm not around people.

302
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,765
Why'd you come back?

303
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,291
Damn!

304
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,294
What time is it?

305
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,546
Chase, what time is it?

306
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:45,386
Well, Carlos, it is 12:14. Why?
You got somewhere you gotta be?

307
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,681
Guess I'm just being paranoid.

308
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,608
Welcome home.

309
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,327
Got a minute?

310
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,037
Yeah.

311
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,748
Everyone is grateful
for you helping us out.

312
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,417
But how long am I gonna stay?

313
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,628
Don't get me wrong.

314
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,422
We really are grateful.

315
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:27,762
They're all talking about
what you did. And they're scared.

316
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,889
I don't blame them.

317
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:34,811
People have a habit
of dying around me.

318
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,438
Not just you.

319
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,074
<i>You're positive it's her?</i>

320
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:52,745
Sixty-two percent. Too
great a chance to pass up.

321
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:57,417
If it is Project Alice, she's been
evading the satellite grid for years.

322
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,627
I've re-routed
the remaining satellites.

323
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,755
We can reacquire the subject and
she'll be unaware of our surveillance.

324
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,174
I can have a strike team ready
within the hour.

325
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:09,596
No. We'll establish
a positive identification first.

326
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,472
One hundred percent.

327
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,809
The group she's with
include known associates.

328
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,563
The original Project Alice
is vital to my research,

329
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,357
to the whole process
of domestication. Her blood,

330
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,651
her genetic structure, is the key.

331
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,654
The longer we leave her out there, the
greater chance we lose her again.

332
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,949
I can't risk that.
That decision isn't yours to make.

333
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,953
You will take no action until this matter
has been discussed by the committee

334
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,457
at the next scheduled meeting.
And, doctor,

335
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:38,750
that's an order.

336
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,965
Claire, this
sequence of transmissions,

337
00:48:44,991 --> 00:48:47,033
it's the best indication of
life we've seen in six months.

338
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,135
- Alaska?
- We have to check it out.

339
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,678
We can't just ignore it.

340
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,931
Have you any idea what kind
of journey that would be?

341
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,184
- Yeah. A long one.
- And at the end of it, what?

342
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,062
You have no guarantee there's
even anyone alive up there.

343
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,813
Claire, these transmissions
say that--

344
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,774
They're dated six months ago.

345
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:05,360
How many radio broadcasts
have we responded to?

346
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,821
How many times
have we got there too late?

347
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,825
The transmissions say that
there's no infection up there.

348
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,535
It's isolated.

349
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,037
Safe.

350
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:19,791
This convoy trusts me
with their lives.

351
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,001
These people don't need
pipe dreams.

352
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,545
Maybe that's exactly
what they need.

353
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:26,714
Look at them, Claire.

354
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:32,053
Six months ago, there were 50 of us,
then 40, now there's less than 30.

355
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,556
They're starting to give up.

356
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,476
They need-- They need
some kind of hope.

357
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,444
We have a decision to make.

358
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:52,824
And it's too big, it's too important
for me to make for you.

359
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,411
There's a chance
there are survivors.

360
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,954
Where?

361
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,081
In Alaska.

362
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,459
There is a chance

363
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,754
that the infection
hasn't reached that far.

364
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,215
But we don't know for sure.

365
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,259
So we have a choice.

366
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,428
We stay as we are,

367
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,264
or we try for Alaska.

368
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,518
For Alaska.

369
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,192
Alaska.

370
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,122
I hope you're right.

371
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,970
God.

372
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,945
The food's virtually gone
and the truck's running on empty.

373
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,406
I've got half a tank of gas.
That's it.

374
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,326
Chase?
Ah, shit, I don't even have empty.

375
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,829
I got enough for
a hundred miles, tops.

376
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,749
If we're gonna make this trip,
we're gonna need to resupply.

377
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,417
Yep.

378
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,253
These are our options.

379
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,839
The nearest, safest bet
is right there.

380
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,382
Mm-hm.

381
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:36,094
No, it's empty. I tried that.

382
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,097
Then, well, maybe, uh...

383
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,974
We could try this--
Vegas.

384
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,645
It's the only place we're sure
to find gasoline and supplies.

385
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:48,356
Well, there's a reason for that.
Vegas is too damn dangerous.

386
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,191
It's crawling with them
sons of bitches.

387
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,361
We have drained every small town
dry over the last six months.

388
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,947
We have to hit a big city.

389
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,865
She's right.

390
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,535
Vegas, it's our only bet.

391
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:11,379
<i>We'll establish
a positive identification first.</i>

392
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:12,880
<i>One hundred percent.</i>

393
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:18,177
<i>You will take no action until this matter
has been discussed by the committee.</i>

394
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,221
<i>Doctor...</i>

395
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,557
<i>that's an order.</i>

396
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:36,070
<i>The committee
authorizes immediate action.</i>

397
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,240
<i>Release of vehicles
and personnel</i>

398
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,743
<i>under command of Dr. Isaacs.</i>

399
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,079
<i>That's an order.</i>

400
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,587
Hey. You all right?

401
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,631
Yeah, I'm fine.

402
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:22,927
Them pork and beans, man, they lethal.
I don't see how you cowboys do it.

403
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,180
Years of practice.

404
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,777
Oh, my God.

405
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,854
What happened to it?

406
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,690
The desert must have
taken it back.

407
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:19,775
Five years.

408
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,236
No one to keep the sand back.

409
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,746
It's empty.

410
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,372
No undead.

411
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,875
Nothing.

412
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,795
Those birds must have moved
through the city block by block.

413
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,089
Picked it clean.

414
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,600
I don't see any truck stops.

415
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,186
Where are they?

416
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:56,896
There.

417
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,774
Valet parking at the casino
up ahead.

418
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,776
There's gas pumps
in there.

419
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,694
Now, how do you know that?

420
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,780
I dropped two G's
back in the day here.

421
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,115
You lost $2000?

422
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,784
Mm-hm.

423
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,050
Damn it.

424
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,064
Spread them out!

425
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,485
We're gonna
have to move it.

426
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:00,835
All right, Chase,
I need a lookout!

427
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:03,003
Up there.

428
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,556
Great.

429
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:28,154
Climb the Eiffel Tower
with a high-powered rifle.

430
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:31,365
A few years ago,
that would've caused a stir.

431
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:37,371
Well, let the good times roll.

432
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,225
Let's get this done.

433
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,187
Get the hell out of here.
Mikey, get the winch.

434
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:02,813
Yeah.
Carlos.

435
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,844
Wait.

436
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,603
Get back!

437
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:13,133
- Carlos, cover me!
- Go!

438
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:05,894
Move!

439
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:37,676
Just get to the back and stay quiet.
Go! Now! Go!

440
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,472
Get down!

441
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:58,424
She really is magnificent.

442
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:03,053
When she's dead,
make sure you move in fast.

443
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,973
I need a sample of her blood
while it's still warm.

444
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,267
That won't be a problem.

445
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:13,063
- Satellite in position?
- Yes, sir.

446
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:16,150
Then shut her down.

447
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,774
Mikey!

448
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:03,447
Hey!

449
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:23,383
Mikey!

450
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:27,971
No!

451
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:30,724
No!

452
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,380
She's fighting the conditioning.

453
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:02,923
Boost the control signal.

454
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:11,723
Shit!

455
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,560
Climb! Give me your hand!

456
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:22,776
Run!

457
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:26,446
Go! Go! Run!

458
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,407
Let's go!

459
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:42,796
L.J.!

460
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,218
L.J.

461
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,831
What is it?

462
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:20,334
Satellite. Some kind
of malfunction.

463
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:49,863
How long?

464
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,700
New feed coming online
in 15 seconds.

465
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,999
Online in three, two...

466
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,293
Now.

467
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:08,090
Where the hell is she going?

468
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:12,636
Shut her down!

469
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,518
She's still coming!

470
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:23,146
Now!
Oh, shit.

471
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:29,820
You son of a--

472
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,448
Back to base!

473
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:42,416
The anti-virus!
Get me the anti-virus!

474
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:00,892
Why didn't you shoot?

475
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:04,855
Because we're not driving to Alaska.
I want that helicopter intact.

476
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:08,400
Let's go look at the computer,
see where that chopper's headed.

477
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,332
How is he?
Under house arrest

478
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:27,044
as you instructed.
He's been quiet.

479
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:43,810
How much of this
have you used?

480
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,229
Her blood increased
the creatures' power.

481
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,858
It also increased the strength
of the infection.

482
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,946
I needed it

483
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,075
You have no idea
what this will do to you.

484
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:04,998
Oh, I have an idea.

485
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,834
You're out of control.

486
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:10,003
Well, this ends here.

487
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,839
Under executive order 1345,
issued by Chairman Wesker

488
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,342
for insubordination
and gross misconduct in the field,

489
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,928
I sentence you to
summary liquidation.

490
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,013
Liquidation?

491
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:23,100
Oh. Just die.

492
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,986
Take the body to the surface. Then
bring me the stats on Program Alice--

493
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,613
Sir!

494
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,014
Good thing we like a challenge.

495
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,076
Hold on.

496
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,328
Hold on.

497
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,790
They have the anti-virus
in there.

498
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,709
Just hold on.

499
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:33,545
It's too late, and you know it.

500
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:39,259
Besides, you need a way
to get in there.

501
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,511
And I have an idea.

502
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:58,236
You keep them safe, huh?
You got it.

503
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,453
Come here.

504
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,472
Carlos, I--

505
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,557
Save it.

506
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,315
You just promise me
one thing.

507
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,318
When you get down there...

508
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,404
Consider it done.

509
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,717
Wish I had a smoke.

510
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,198
Whoa!

511
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,076
Fuck!

512
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:26,301
I'll be damned.

513
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:29,304
L.J., you sneaky son of a bitch.

514
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:38,104
Oh, hell.

515
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,151
Come on.

516
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,828
Get the kids out quickly!

517
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,454
Go!

518
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,627
Run! Run! Hurry up!
Okay.

519
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,003
Go! Go! Go!

520
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,715
Take him!

521
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,681
You're not coming?

522
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,517
Take care of the others.

523
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:24,724
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

524
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:28,895
I am the artificial intelligence--
Yeah, I know what you are.

525
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,730
I knew your sister.

526
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,899
She was a homicidal bitch.

527
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:36,235
My sister computer was merely
following the most logical path

528
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,237
for the preservation
of human life.

529
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:40,573
Yeah. Kill a few, save a lot.

530
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:42,867
So, what happened here?

531
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:46,663
Dr. Isaacs returned in an infected
state. He was bitten by a creature

532
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,666
that had been treated
with a newly developed serum.

533
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:52,085
A serum derived from your blood.

534
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,838
The resulting infection
has caused massive mutation.

535
01:17:58,925 --> 01:17:59,926
My blood?

536
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:02,011
Your blood has bonded
with the T-virus.

537
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,763
Dr. Isaacs correctly deduced

538
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,850
that it could be used
to destroy the biohazard for good.

539
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:11,437
You mean my blood
is the cure for all this?

540
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,106
Correct.

541
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,441
So why are you helping me?

542
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:18,611
Your blood is pure,
and this facility contains

543
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:22,073
all of the equipment you will
require to synthesize a cure.

544
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,787
You mean this could all end?
Correct.

545
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:29,414
There is, however,

546
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,291
a small problem.

547
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,925
<i>I have him contained
in the lower levels,</i>

548
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:43,845
<i>but I cannot hold him there
for much longer.</i>

549
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:47,974
All right, let's go.

550
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:01,070
<i>Alice?</i>

551
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:03,322
<i>Good luck.</i>

552
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:12,488
You can't kill me.

553
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:02,288
I've told you,

554
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,915
I can't die.

555
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,314
No.

556
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:55,841
For so long, I thought
you were the future.

557
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,177
I was wrong.

558
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,347
I am the future.

559
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,313
No.

560
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,899
You're just

561
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:14,068
another asshole.

562
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:19,365
And we're both gonna die
down here.

563
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:43,889
Yeah, you're the future,
all right.

564
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:23,053
All attempts to contact the North
American facility continue to fail.

565
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,347
How long have they
been off the air?

566
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,474
Seventeen hours.

567
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:31,061
We must consider them lost.
But our plans remain unchanged.

568
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,439
All data will be transferred
to this facility

569
01:26:33,606 --> 01:26:37,067
and the research will continue
under my personal supervision.

570
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,737
I expect results
within one month.

571
01:26:39,904 --> 01:26:41,906
Oh, you won't have to wait
that long, boys.

572
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:44,283
Because I'm coming for you.

573
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:45,701
And, uh,

574
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:48,954
I'm gonna be bringing
a few of my friends.

575
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,211
<i>You're just</i>

576
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,714
<i>another asshole.</i>
