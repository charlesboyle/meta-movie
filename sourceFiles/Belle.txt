when you were spreading them, Mama?

177
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,039
May I present the second of my
two nieces: Miss Dido Lindsay.

178
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,388
A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.

179
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,919
ELIZABETH: James is the eldest.

180
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,383
To inherit the entire
Ashford fortune.

181
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,719
He's also to inherit
from his uncle...

182
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,519
a healthy man, who shows
little sign of departure.

183
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,300
OLIVER:
She is intriguing, is she not?

184
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,382
I find her repulsive.

185
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,071
Well, I suppose she is... if you find
a most rare and exotic flower so.

186
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,821
He has much to recommend him.

187
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,588
And a second fortune in life
should please any wife.

188
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,719
Dido. You are not to be
a coquette with him.

189
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,239
You already have your fortune.

190
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,704
One does not make a wife of
the rare and exotic, Oliver.

mulatto running around in their house...

207
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,519
but I will not have one
running around in mine.

208
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,189
- She is an heiress.
- Although exceptions can be made.

209
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,460
It is said her father left
her a rather vast fortune.

210

I mean to say, if that
is your inclination.

211
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,028
She is rather soft on the eye.
I have thought no further of it, Mama.

Oh, do not be selfish with
your good fortune, m'Lord.

This will be most interesting.

221
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,825
She's never played in company.

Hers was a most diligent governess.

His family name will no doubt
induce her to take him seriously.

She must not delude herself. Such
decisions are not hers to make.

Well, then spell it out to her...

before she renders herself sport
to some 'gent' of cruel promises.

LORD MANSFIELD: She has no reason. Her
inheritance leaves her free to marry.

That at least is true.

want to paint me.

The man is to be paid a fortune.
What is there to decide?

You are simply to sit still, Dido.

Should not any lady be flattered
to be such a subject?

How should any male
know the ways of a lady

249
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,879
when he has not even mastered
the ways of a gentleman?

250
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,559
Quite. Though one should be
forgiven for thinking...

251
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,159
he is in the presence of a lady

252

still a juvenile.

there otherwise might be none.

pay attention to what you are taught.

273

But you have neither the rank
nor the finances for any more.

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,265
Well if I may, my Lord,
neither did you.

I beg your pardon?

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,421

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,103
as a fourth son...

278
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,719
you had rank but not the income

279
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,079
to pay for your
qualification to the Inns.

280
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,559
Without the sponsorship of Lord
Foley and William Hamilton...

281
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,599
the English courts might not have
benefited from your brilliance...

282
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,542
and the title Lord Chief Justice
could not be yours today... my Lord.

283

And you think you are worthy
of such considerations?

284
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,519
Of that I do not know, my Lord,

285
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,439
but I do know that a country
life does not suit me.

287
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,109

to take his son under my tutelage.

288

What do you think?

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,628
Thank you for your
gracious support.

290
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,199

you since neither is my place.

pupil, you realize?

Someone to keep you company while
you take papa's dictation, Dido.

297
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,347
Truth is, there have been more men here
this week than I've seen in my entire life.

298
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,021
Hopefully we have not disappointed.

299
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,024
On the contrary.

300
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,146
Mr. Davinier, what...

301
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,519
what is the importance of the Zong?

302
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,382
Why is the case before papa's
court, the Supreme Court?

303
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,701
Well...

304
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,064
it is a ship.

305
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,703
I am aware of that.

306
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,226
It is... a human cargo ship.

308
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,986

before arriving at its destination.

309
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,906
Drowned by the crew,
on the captain's orders.

310
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,589
But... why?

311
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,559
Miss, your supper is served
now in the ladies' parlor.

312
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,225
Thank you.

313
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,584
Will you be joining us for
dinner, Mr. Davinier?

314
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,879
Uh... Thank you, madam,
but I am promised to

315
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,639
the company of my
aunt this evening.

316
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,022
Very well, as you wish.

317
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,708
Permit me to ask, but...

318
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,479
why do you not dine
with your family ever?

319
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,319
That is not correct.

320
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,919
Forgive me but twice now I have seen
you separated from the gathering.

321
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,479
I am confounded.

322

entirely destroying an economic
foundation of this land.

The insurance claim states

336
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,399
the slaves were thrown overboard
for the safety of the ship.

337
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,559
That there wasn't sufficient water
to survive the rest of the voyage.

338
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,919
- It does.
- Then, if I'm correct, the case hangs on...

339
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,199
it hangs on 'absolute necessity'.

340

If the killing of the negroes
was truly necessary...

341
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,359
to save the ship, as
the captain contends.

disposes of his cargo.

you to enter a port...

345
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,108
with barely one piece of merchandise
left to trade, what would you do?

346
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,103
Swallow financial ruin or seek
recompense from your insurer?

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,064
With due respect...

348
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,424
I should question whether human life
should be insurable as cargo at all.

349
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,423
A gentleman rather like him
once showed me great interest.

350
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,999
Mr. Davinier?

351
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,479
Really, Mary?

352
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,942
Well, don't look at me like that.

353
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,461
It was my mama who intervened.

354
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,469
I thought he had a very
great sense of duty.

355
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,119

Wait.

367
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,429
I was curious.

368
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,581
Quite a task... to sit
for so many hours.

just learned of the Zong case.

Why do you judge me so?

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,790
It is a fact that I have contemplated
on the matter for many hours and I...

374
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,439
I do not think the
slaves could have been

375
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,479

And what... what is that?

385
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,665
The slaves were thrown
into the waters...

386
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,231
chained together as one.

387
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,823
They were diseased...

388
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,985
worth more as dead insured merchandise,
than as alive spoiled goods.

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,266
Miss Lindsay...

390
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,199
But the insurers are appealing?

391
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,663
They are refusing to pay
for murdered slaves.

392
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,670
Thank you.

393
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,639
You told her they were
wantonly drowned?

394
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,879
They were diseased, but it was essential
that they die on the journey...

395
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,559
or they would not come under
the insurance consideration.

396
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,639
Neither, too, if they had expired of their
diseases. That is why they were killed.

You have taken advantage of
confidential matters afforded you.

public consumption for months.

403
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,839

As the mere son of a vicar...

408
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,221
I wonder whether the value you extend
to your very precious mulatto niece...

409
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,119
amounts to the £30 insurance

each life they murdered?

Elizabeth has no income.

429

You are to meet as many gentlemen as
possible before we make the match.

LADY MANSFIELD:
Any gentleman of good breeding...

433
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,279
would be unlikely to form a
serious attachment to Dido.

434
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,187

her position in society.

As a negro and as a woman.

794
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,279
I suppose you have.

795
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,866
Or have I?

if she is financially secure?

For who is she without a
husband of consequence?

798
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,199
It seems silly... like a free negro

799
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,839
who begs for a master.

They were kind, gentle.

805

- Mine?

811
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,981
she has given me.

812
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,945

know she was beautiful.

Is it... what you want?

818
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,199
The alternative is
to replace Lady Mary

819
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,999
in her responsibilities at Kenwood.

820
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,159
But she's a spinster.

821
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,079
Papa did not trust I
could achieve a match

822
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,986
that would raise my
rank or even equal it.

823
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,906
You are above reducing
yourself for the sake of rank.

824
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,268
I pray he would marry you
without a penny to your name...

825
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,270
for that is a man who
would truly treasure you.

831
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,799

somehow felt better in this world.

832
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,759

affections are growing

833

have no further use for

01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,839
I find in favor of the insurers...

1218
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,919
- Ah!
- (JEERING)

1219
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,239
and overturn the decision
of the Lower Court.

1220
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,224
- CLERK: All rise!

1221
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,941
You may not blame Mr. Davinier.

1222
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,946
My attendance today is
absolutely at my own volition.

1223
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,439
I'm fully aware, Dido.

1224
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:42,062
My Lord, I am inspired
by your decision today.

1225
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,942
We will not go backwards from here.

1226
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:49,306
History will judge whether
your optimism is warranted.

1227
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,422
You're a man of conviction.

1228
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,584
I'm trying to be.

1229
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:05,668
I've not changed my mind.
She is to marry a gentleman.

1230
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,510
And Mr. Davinier is
not a gentleman?

1231
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,239
He is, indeed.

1232
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,999
My affections are with him, Papa.

1233
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,719
And that is why he should have
an occupation befitting one.

1234
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:20,024
I wish for nothing if
not to be his wife.

1235
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:29,879
Mr. Davinier, I would like you to
attend my chambers in the morning.

1236
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,319
There are some matters
you can assist me with.

1237
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,559
- Your Lordship?
- And, if you think it's a good idea...

1238
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:39,865
I would like to facilitate your
entry into the Inns of Court.

1239
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,705
I think it is a very
good idea, my Lord.

1240
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,025
Can it be true?

1241
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,559
Of course. He sees what I see.
His words were as clear as...

1242
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,861
No.

1243
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,870
No, that your feelings
for me are so?

1244
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,710
That you would be my wife?

1245
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:20,945
Because I cannot conceive
of a life without you.

1246
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,184
I love you...

1247
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,627
for all that you are...

1248
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,070
and with all...

1249
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,944
all that I am.

1250
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,109
