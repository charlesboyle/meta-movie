You'd think after everything
that went down...

1689
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:52,373
Frankie would have cut
Tommy loose right then.

1693
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,627
- Tommy's in a little trouble.
- How little?

1694
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:12,719
Hundred and fifty thousand.

Oh. Why isn't he standing
here talking to me?

1696
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:20,928
Because he can't sing
"My Mother's Eyes" like I can.

Frankie. I like that.

Yeah.

I don't know, Gyp. It, uh...

01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,120
It always felt like I was playing
catch-up. It just crept up.

01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,569
I'm surprised he's
still walking around.

I've been rooming with this guy on
and off for, what is it, 10 years?

1725
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:54,995
This was not a walk in the park.
This was a sentence.

1726
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,872
A 10-year sentence.

1727
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:59,458
The man is a personal nightmare.

1728
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:02,378
He wears the same underwear

1729
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:06,215
He takes no pride in his appearance.
In the simple amenities of life.

This isn't the time...

The man cannot be in a hotel
without using all the towels.

Like he's living alone.

1736
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:20,729
You need a towel, you know
where it is? In a pile on the floor.

the man is pissing in the sink.

- I never pissed in the sink.
- Right in the fucking sink.

He says, "This was closer."

The man is not properly socialized.

You think it's easy running the group?

the managers, the record companies?

got going on, and then the group.

- I'll tell you what happens. Nothing.

1848
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:21,790
All right.

1849
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,877
That's it, then.

1850
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,755
Norm. Tommy.

1851
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,417
Excuse us.

1852
01:35:38,608 --> 01:35:40,055
Hey, Frankie.

1853
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:42,349
Frankie.

1854
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:44,976
It's that bad, huh?

1855
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:52,279
Frankie...

1856
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:56,367
you are digging a million-dollar
hole for yourself.

1857
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:01,364
Tommy took me off the streets, Gyp.
What's that worth?

1858
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:03,958
You'll be on the road till you're 90.

1859
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,261
You want, I could arrange a loan.

1860
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:12,509
Thanks, Mr. DeCarlo, but I don't want anybody
involved in our future besides me and Frankie.

1861
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:15,102
Hey, I just realized something.

1862
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17,396
I don't wanna be in
this group anymore.

1863
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:19,982
- FRANKIE: Not now, Nicky.
- No, forget that. I wanna go home.

1864
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:21,885
What are you talking about?

1865
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:23,694
I wanna go home.

1866
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,029
Good idea. After the tour,
we all take a break.

1867
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,447
No. Now.

1868
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:28,895
I quit.

1869
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:30,993
You can't quit.

1870
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:33,370
I got his attention. Hi, Bob.

1871
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,914
Nicky, Nicky, we're in
the middle of a tour.

1872
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,292
Yeah. You know, I always
hated the touring.

1873
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:41,295
Fucking hotels.
Those tiny little bars of soap.

1874
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:43,880
You're supposed to wash with that?
Can't even see it.

1875
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:46,633
You're talking crazy.
Calm down and we'll figure it out.

1876
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,581
I already figured it out.

1877
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:50,470
I'll make it easy for you.

1878
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,681
I don't want money.
I don't want side deals.

1879
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,016
All I want is out.

1880
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:55,559
You're right about the soap.

1881
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,837
Hey, Nicky. Nicky.

1882
01:36:58,438 --> 01:36:59,646
BOB: Nicky!

1883
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,891
We're in the middle of a damn tour!
Are you crazy?

1884
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:10,733
GYP: Nicky, wait.

1885
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,351
Wait up.

1886
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,786
Let me understand.

1887
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:17,372
You put in all this time,
you have all these hits...

1888
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:19,416
and yet, you're gonna just walk away?

1889
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,114
That is crazy.

1890
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:25,589
Me and the wife had a little trouble
last year, so you know what I did?

1891
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,758
I put the kids with my parents.

1892
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:30,385
And then I told them, my own kids...

1893
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:34,461
I made up this thing where I told them
I was really their uncle. Uncle Nick.

1894
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:36,183
I don't understand.

1895
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:38,727
So I could screw around, you know.
Do what I wanted.

1896
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:43,474
I figured if I wasn't home to put them to bed,
they wouldn't feel deprived of a father.

1897
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,767
I don't know what to say, Nick.

1898
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,612
All due respect, Mr. DeCarlo...

1899
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:52,187
you sell a hundred million records,
see how you handle it.

1900
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:55,360
Frankie and Bob,
they're gonna take this hard.

1901
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:57,287
I'm not worried.

1902
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:59,122
Those guys, with all their talent...

1903
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,275
they'll never even know I'm gone.

1904
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,348
You want me to go out there
by myself? Are you nuts?

1905
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:19,226
Look, there's a lot of great
backup guys out there, right?

1906
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,895
There's Joe Long, Charlie Calello.

1907
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,469
We find two more
and put you in front.

1908
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,609
Get a great drummer. A horn
section like we talked about.

1909
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,694
Like Basie and the Kenton band.

1910
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,279
- What do you do?
- Write and produce.

1911
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,447
I don't like it.

1912
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:34,074
- Why?
- You're crapping out on me.

1913
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:36,569
- I thought we had a handshake.
- We do.

1914
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:40,322
I wake up in the middle of the night,
I don't know where I am.

1915
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:44,531
I think, "What the hell happened?
What's gonna happen? Everybody leaves."

1916
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:49,206
Why does everybody leave?

1917
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,450
Frankie.

1918
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,080
This is your time.

1919
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:02,018
How do you do that?

1920
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,466
What?

1921
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:07,099
Get me to agree to stuff.

1922
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:09,302

the home and the work.

first thing is you stop that.

You could be a great singer.

1993
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:44,436

1994

Look, I know how hard it is.

1995
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:51,520
You got something you wanna share
with the world and nobody gives a shit.

1996
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:53,995
But then things turn around.

1997
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:56,915
You have to have patience,
and you gotta keep working.

1998
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:59,068
We're gonna turn things around.

I'm gonna get you in singing lessons.

You're gonna start eating right,
gonna start exercising.

I set it up with Bob Crewe, he's
gonna record you a demo. Four songs.

All you.

2005
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:21,177

01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:47,090
You know, it's funny...

2012
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:51,010
back in the day, we almost left Crewe
because he wouldn't record us a demo.

2013
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:52,679
Four songs.

2014
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:55,174
And now he's doing it for Francine.
