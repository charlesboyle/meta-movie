1
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,374
Please prepare to exit the ferry.

2
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,172
Attention, on deck.
We are now arriving at Fire Island Pines.

3
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,300
All right, welcome to
Fire Island, everybody.

4
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:51,261
Please take care, exit slowly.

5
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:52,971
Those steps can be wet.

6
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,223
Also double-check
you have all your luggage...

7
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,313
Have a good day.

8
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:24,669
- Hey, Weeks!
- Hey, honey.

9
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:26,754
How you doing?

10
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,881
We're doing great.

11
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:35,096
Here we are!

12
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,229
What are you guys doing?

13
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:46,357
Hairy is out. Your turn, teddy bear.

14
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,109
No. No. I love my teddy.

15
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,528
- Calvin Klein would not approve.
- Oh.

16
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:55,658
The baseball game is on
and my summer has officially begun.

17
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:56,951
The thing is he actually means it.

18
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,953
- Hey, baby.
- How are ya?

19
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,623
- You want a beer?
- Nah, I've already had a couple.

20
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,791
Nice stripes, Lieutenant. Hot.

21
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,044
Oh, please. Captain.

22
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,920
Just got back from the reserves.

23
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:11,257
You know what they say.
Once a month, I get to play a real man.

24
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,302
Ooh. I haven't seen you at the gym lately.

25
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,012
Bruce!

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,349
- Your turn, Bruce.
- What? What?

27
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,976
Brucey, please. Don't embarrass
our house at the beach, hon.

28
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,019
Uh-oh.

29
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,646
You gotta do it.

30
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:29,275
You know what they say, Ned.
If you can't beat 'em,

31
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:32,904
Join 'em!

32
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,783
That's my guy-

33
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,127
Craig was miserable
when you weren't interested.

34
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,502
Now look, he's got Robert Redford.

35
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:48,753
It shows you there is a god.

36
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,589
How's John?

37
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,091
- John?
- John.

38
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,594
Oh, John! No, I'm with Gregory now.

39
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,771
We're celebrating our
15th month anniversary.

40
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,557
Fifteen... That's a long
time for you, Mickey.

41
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:03,785
Oh, please! We're lovers
and we live together.

42
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:06,020
It's not like we're faithful
to each other, too.

43
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,522
He's not even Jewish.

44
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,065
Don't tell my rabbi.

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,070
- Oh, my God.

46
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,699
- Hey, Weeks! You suck!

47
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,078
Why do you even come here anymore?
We don't want you.

48
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,791
You made us look terrible in your novel.

49
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,751
Look around you. Sex is liberating.

50
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:32,463
All I said was having so much sex
makes finding love impossible.

51
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:35,883
Do not put your failure to find someone
on the rest of us.

52
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,301
Neddy!

53
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,554
- Ow!
- Oh, jeez.

54
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,104
Oh, my God!

55
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,234
Guys!

56
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,243
Hey, what happened?

57
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,328
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

58
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,272
I just got a little light-headed.
I got myself up. I'm fine.

59
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,461
I think I just got a little dizzy.

60
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,422
Does he seem okay?

61
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:19,719
Happy birthday to you

62
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:24,766
Happy birthday to you

63
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:31,564
Happy birthday, dear Craig!

64
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:37,570
Happy birthday to you!

65
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,863
Blow!

66
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,615
He's good at that!

67
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,339
I fucking love this place!

68
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,086
Hey, Ned!

69
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,046
Come on. Please?

70
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:26,572
I sold you a ceramic pig once
at Maison France on Bleecker Street.

71
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,783
I'm Sanford.

72
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,368
Yes, I remember.

73
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,453
Somebody I was friends with then
collected pigs

74
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,998
and you had the biggest pig
I'd ever seen outside a real pig.

75
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,132
They just keep getting bigger
and won't go away.

76
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,219
I'm her 20th case.

77
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:52,098
And six of them are dead.

78
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,693
Hey, Ned, won't be a minute.

79
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,581
Hey, Buzzy, I didn't know you worked here.

80
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,284
- Who are you?

81
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,914
Uh, Ned Weeks.
I spoke to you after The Times article.

82
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,459
Come in. Take your clothes off.

83
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,670
I only came to ask some questions.

84
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,759
- You are gay, aren't you?
- Yes.

85
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:34,265
Take your clothes off. Don't be nervous.
I've seen more men than you have.

86
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,563
To answer all of your questions,
I don't know.

87
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:44,191
I've never seen or heard
of anything like this.

88
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,901
Have you had any of the symptoms?

89
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,780
Most of the shit The Times said,
amoebas, gonorrhea, hepatitis.

90
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,594
You don't know what it's been like
since the sexual revolution.

91
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,744
What makes you think I don't?

92
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,538
Any fever, night sweats, weight loss?

93
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,914
Don't I wish.

94
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,082
No.

95
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,419
And purple lesions? Open your mouth.

96
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,422
It's a cancer.

97
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,425
There's a strange reaction
in the immune system.

98
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,634
It's collapsed.

99
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,763
Won't fight, so the diseases
most of my patients are coming down with

100
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,682
are brought on by germs
that wouldn't hurt a baby.

101
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,393
Ticklish.

102
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,278
At least not a baby in
New York City, anyway.

103
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,398
I mean, the immune system
is the system we know the least about.

104
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,780
So where's this big mouth
I hear you've got?

105
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:31,989
Is big mouth a symptom?

106
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,241
No. It's a cure.

107
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,661
This seems to only be happening to gay men.

108
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:40,206
Buzzy says you are well-known
in the gay community

109
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,875
and not afraid to say what you think.

110
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,795
I can't find any gay leaders,

111
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,798
and I call gay organizations,
no one ever calls me back.

112
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:52,384
Dr. Brookner, no one with half a brain
gets involved with gay politics.

113
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,804
- There's no room for criticism.
- What's your criticism?

114
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:58,182
I hate that we play victim when many of us,
most of us don't have to.

115
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,101
Then you're exactly what's needed now.

116
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,602
Maybe they're just waiting for someone
to lead them.

117
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,187
I don't want to lead them.

118
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,273
What exactly are you
trying to get me to do?

119
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,275
Tell gay men to stop having sex.

120
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,114
Do you think that this cancer
is sexually transmitted?

121
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,449
I think it is, yes.

122
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,493
Can I prove it yet? No.

123
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,082
Do you realize that you're talking about
millions of men

124
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:27,586
who have singled out promiscuity
as their principal political agenda?

125
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,421
How do you deal with that?

126
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,798
Tell them they may die.

127
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,884
- Where?
- Down the hall! Down the hall!

128
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,052
It's not that simple.

129
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,221
It's more complicated than that.

130
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,931
They think sex is all they have.

131
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,850
Mr. Weeks, if having sex can kill you,

132
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,519
doesn't anyone with half a brain
stop fucking?

133
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,109
You can go.
I'm not finding what I'm looking for here.

134
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,737
- Where is she?
- Open up!

135
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,448
- Where? Where?
- Right in that room.

136
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,201
- Easy! Easy!
- Just put him up on the table.

137
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:00,327
Up here.

138
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,412
Just try to hold him.

139
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,123
- Baby!
- Easy! Be still.

140
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,916
- Can you tell me what happened?

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,295
We were meeting him outside.
We turned the corner, he just collapsed.

142
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:16,927
Jesus!

143
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,786
Hey, get the fuck outta the street!

144
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,933
Baby!

145
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,727
Oh, my God.

146
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,936
Help!

147
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,734
- Who's the lover?
Lam, ma'am.

148
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,320
- What's your name?
- Bruce Niles.

149
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,655
- Brookner, I need a room immediately.

150
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,657
Niles, you were Reinhardt's boyfriend?

151
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,367
Yes, ma'am. How do you know that?

152
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:41,493
He died three weeks ago.

153
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,280
They wouldn't even let me say goodbye.

154
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,159
Not even let me kiss him goodbye.

155
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,746
He's dead?

156
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,839
I'm so sorry.

157
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,348
It can happen this fast?

158
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:47,935
N just did.

159
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,281
We have to do something.

160
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,075
No one else will.

161
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,911
What are we supposed to do?

162
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,961
You make these assumptions
on the basis of 46 cases!

163
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,298
You wanted to know what I think.
This is what I think.

164
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,300
You are all going to infect each other.

165
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,641
Now only a few of you have.

166
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,811
Unfortunately, we can't
tell yet which ones.

167
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,273
Long before we isolated
the hepatitis viruses,

168
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,485
we knew about the diseases they caused
and how they got around!

169
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,249
Where are the medical journals? The Times?

170
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:43,824
I sent my first report to the
medical journals over a year ago.

171
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,577
Excuse me, how do you know
what you're looking for,

172
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,204
real quick,
if you don't know what you're looking for?

173
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,706
I'm sorry. I guess that's a dumb question.

174
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,207
No, it isn't.

175
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,878
It's the smartest question of all
and the hardest one to answer.

176
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,361
Doesn't common sense tell you
you should cool it for a while?

177
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,009
Why not?

178
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,108
It doesn't leave much to look forward to.

179
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,097
What if it turns out that you're wrong?

180
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,599
Let her speak!

181
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,406
The worst that could happen
would be that you cooled it for a while.

182
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,937
No! Excuse me! Excuse me!

183
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,189
That is not...

184
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,233
Excuse me. That is not the
worst that will have happened.

185
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,152
Guys will become frightened of sex,

186
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,155
they will lose our self-respect
that we fought very, very hard for.

187
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,074
We will be scapegoated worse than ever.

188
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,367
The world will think we're carriers

189
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,731
and the moral majority
will have even more of a field day.

190
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:34,083
I am not coming back
until that bitch on wheels is gone.

191
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,419
Wait! I see more cases each week
than the week before.

192
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,380
Half of all my patients die.

193
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,593
Okay, I hope she winds this up, 'cause I've
got a tiny little orgy in New Rochelle.

194
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,678
Where's the health department?
Where's the Mayor?

195
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:47,971
Shut the fuck up, John.

196
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,640
Oh, you shut the fuck up, hon!

197
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,308
What were the numbers?

198
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,862
Ls every gay meeting like this?

199
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,534
Half these people just
showed up to get laid.

200
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,121
Quiet! Quiet!

201
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,582
We're starting a group!
We're starting a health crisis group.

202
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,917
We're gonna meet here again.

203
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,420
Next time bring some fucking food!

204
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,130
Hey, hey, hey. That's not nice.

205
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,178
- Welcome to gay politics.

206
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,588
Yeah. I'm very late for
an important meeting with Craig Claiborne.

207
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,339
He's expecting me.

208
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,398
Hi, Felix Turner.

209
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,443
- And you are?
- My name's Ned Weeks.

210
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,945
You're very cute.

211
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,866
You caught me at a rough moment, all right?
I have a deadline.

212
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,075
The First Lady's coming to town.

213
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,199
I've been told you're gay.

214
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,080
And you might be able to help me
get some vital information in The Times.

215
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,707
You've been told?

216
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,911
And who was it who told you?

217
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,752
Oh, honey, everybody's talking about it.

218
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,092
Why does everyone gay
think that I run The New York Times?

219
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,386
I can't help you with this.

220
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,555
I'm sorry to hear that.
What would you suggest I do?

221
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,681
Take your pick.

222
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,018
I got 23 parties, 37 new restaurants,
12 new discos.

223
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,146
Listen, I can't get anyone here
to write another article.

224
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,608
I've talked to half a dozen reporters
and the guy who worked on the first piece.

225
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,944
Mr. Leather? Yeah, no.

226
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,905
No one here will write
about it, and I can't.

227
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,573
Look, we're very compartmentalized.

228
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,326
You wouldn't want science
to write about sweaters, would you?

229
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,577
It's a very peculiar feeling

230
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,661
having to go out and seek support
from the straight world for something gay.

231
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,583
I wouldn't know about that.

232
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,337
I just write about gay designers
and gay discos and gay chefs

233
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,966
and gay models and gay rock stars
and gay celebrities and gay everything.

234
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,342
I just don't call them gay.

235
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,470
Isn't it time you start?

236
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,141
- Look, I really do have a deadline.
- Hmm.

237
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,602
- And you wouldn't want me to get fired.
- Hmm.

238
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,396
Would you?

239
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,567
Guys like you can be a pain in the ass.

240
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,904
- You in the book?
- Yes.

241
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,870
Hi, guys. Give to gay cancer?

242
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,415
Hi, give to gay cancer?

243
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,375
No? Hi, give to gay cancer?

244
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,835
Hi, sir...

245
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,504
Hi, give to gay cancer?
There's a cancer in the gay community.

246
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,669
Can you give to gay cancer?

247
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,758
There's a crisis in our community right now.
We could really...

248
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,385
We could use a little help.

249
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,262
- No?
- I think you could be a little less aggressive.

250
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,431
Less... We've tried that.

251
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,267
Can you give to cancer in our community?

252
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,686
Hi, give to gay..-

253
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,355
Hi, give to gay cancer?

254
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,838
It's funny. My mother sent flowers

255
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,717
and I had never told her I was gay.

256
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,345
I just told her that Craig had died.

257
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,264
I think she knew.

258
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,227
I think somehow mothers always know.

259
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,617
Doesn't spending $5 million
on a house frighten you?

260
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,913
It scared the shit out of me
even having you handling my finances.

261
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,790
You can have a house anytime you want,

262
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,753
which reminds me,
your account needs more money.

263
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,628
You're not doing too badly.

264
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,132
I miss you being in the movie business.
I like movies.

265
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,969
Do I detect a note of approval
from the big brother that called me Lemon?

266
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,596
I don't want a house.

267
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,890
Then why have you been searching
in the country for so long for?

268
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,517
No fun living in it alone.

269
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,477
This Bruce,

270
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,479
is he someone you're seeing?

271
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,065
I see him. He doesn't see me.

272
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:38,405
Ben, could your law firm
take this on for free?

273
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,240
What's it called? Pro bono?

274
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,118
We started an organization. I told you.
There's this new disease...

275
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,996
Now this sounds like just another excuse
to keep from writing.

276
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,581
Why Can't you just say yes?

277
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,084
I told you, because we have a committee
that decides that kind of a thing.

278
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,463
But you're the senior partner
and I'm your brother.

279
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,007
Hey, Mario. How's Homer?

280
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,431
If you're not gonna help,
I'm gonna have to find somebody else.

281
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,850
- Well, you're more than free to do that.
- I don't want to do that.

282
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,937
I want my big brother's
fancy, famous, big-time major law firm

283
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,775
to be the first straight New York law firm
to do pro bono work for a gay cause.

284
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,902
I would be real proud of that, and you.

285
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,945
I'll ask my partners' approval
at the next meeting.

286
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,575
I'll lobby them.
You don't sound like a very sure vote.

287
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:33,794
Okay?

288
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,503
You're getting better at it.

289
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,598
I'm seeing three to four
new patients a week.

290
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,851
I've got seven in ICU.
The whole hospital only has room for 30.

291
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,647
I've had to admit some of them
under other illnesses. That's a no-no.

292
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,358
I've got 20 in private
rooms they can't afford.

293
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,861
Okay, what about the guys who don't
have health insurance? Artists, actors?

294
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:02,545
I've got eight of them in another ward
where I shouldn't put them.

295
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,252
Why don't you wear gloves and a face mask?

296
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:18,839
I never have and I never
will, and I'm still here.

297
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:24,047
Why is all the food sitting outside their
rooms like this? It's getting cold.

298
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,931
It's always cold because the appropriate
staff won't bring it into the rooms,

299
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,642
so it sits and rots until
one of my staff can.

300
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,768
Park right there.

301
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:36,773
Right there. Yeah.
Park there. Yeah. Right through the tunnel.

302
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,442
Take the tunnel. We'll take the book back.

303
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,612
I know him. Can I go inside with you?

304
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,963
Only if you wear all the protective shit.

305
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,870
If you don't, I don't.

306
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,165
No, no, no. Over there.

307
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,376
Go the other way.

308
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,046
No, are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me? Go back.

309
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,089
Hi, Sanford.

310
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:04,467
You see it? Take the tunnel.
Go ahead. Ride straight through.

311
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,591
How are we doing, soldier?

312
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,096
I want my dog.
Can you please bring me my dog?

313
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,807
He won't be able to live without me.

314
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:11,892
I want my dog.

315
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,310
I want my dog.

316
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,897
Go ahead. That's right. Good, good.

317
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,189
No, take the book back.

318
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,401
Right there. Go park. Park right there.

319
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,323
Can you please bring me my dog?
He won't know how to live without me.

320
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,329
Don't bother.

321
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,915
Who's going to bring me my dog?

322
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:39,461
His name is Skip.
He'll come when you call him.

323
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,838
Please.

324
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,842
I miss him.

325
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,392
I miss him.

326
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,022
Can you imagine this at 19?

327
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:03,360
Your first boyfriend
you were gonna spend your whole life with.

328
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,826
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

329
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,703
You're the TV guy.

330
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,789
Please go to room 407 and fix it.

331
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,915
No, I'm not gonna do that.

332
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,792
Fix the TV! It's your fucking job.

333
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:22,629
My union says I don't gotta risk my life
for some contagious fairy.

334
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,716
If I have to go in there,
then I fucking quit.

335
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:38,561
So what exactly has your side been doing?

336
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,921
- Hi.
- Hey.

337
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,507
Thanks.

338
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,678
- You want some of this? Beer?
- Oh, beer is fine. Thanks.

339
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,474
Oh. Hey, pooch.

340
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,560
- Her name's Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

341
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,564
You know, I really used to like high tech.

342
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,441
I'm tired of it now.

343
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,277
I think I want chintz back again.

344
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,112
- Don't be insulted.
- Uh...

345
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,739
I'm not.

346
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:33,283
I want chintz back again, too.

347
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,662
- So, here we are.
- Mmm-hmm.

348
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,706
Two fellas who want chintz back again.

349
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,166
I guess this really is a date.

350
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,254
I'm starving.

351
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,257
Are you glad I'm here?

352
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,427
Oh, I'm pleased as punch you're here.
You're very good-looking.

353
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,553
What are you doing here?

354
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,847
- You think you're bad-looking or something?
- Mmm.

355
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,516
- Where you from?
- I'm from Oklahoma.

356
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,604
I left home at 18, put myself through...

357
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,190
What, you want to dance?

358
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,400
Put myself through college.

359
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,446
My dad worked at the
refinery in West Tulsa,

360
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:15,116
and my mom was a waitress
in a luncheonette in Walgreens.

361
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,956
It's amazing, isn't it, how a kid comes
out of all that to wind up on The Times

362
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,126
dictating taste and style
to the entire world.

363
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,337
And we were just starting
to talk so nicely.

364
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,423
Talking's not my problem.
Shutting up's my problem.

365
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,676
Why do you write
all that fancy ball-gown bullshit?

366
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,720
I bet you gobble it up every day.

367
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,265
I know 10 people who have died.

368
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,976
When I came to you, it was only one.

369
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,854
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,296
Is that why you agreed to this date?

371
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,575
Fork on the left,

372
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,787
knife on the right.

373
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:06,793
Did you know that Hitler's final solution
to eliminate the Polish Jews

374
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,211
was first mentioned in The Times?

375
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,297
It was on page 28,
on page six of The Washington Post.

376
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,421
They were both owned by Jews,
their very own people.

377
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:17,382
Scholars are finally writing honestly
about it, and it's damning to everyone.

378
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,640
Where was the Christian churches?
The Pope? Churchill? Roosevelt?

379
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,976
A few words from any of them
would have put Hitler on notice.

380
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,729
Dachau was open in 1933.
Where the fuck was everybody?

381
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,066
This is turning out to be
a very romantic evening.

382
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,635
You've never had a lover, have you?

383
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,780
I suppose you've had quite a few?

384
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,908
I had a very good one for a
number of years, thank you.

385
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,080
He was older than I was
and he found someone younger.

386
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,917
- You're looking for a father?
- No. I'm not looking for a father.

387
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,044
God. You're relentless.

388
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,597
Okay.

389
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,849
That's yours.

390
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,685
Everybody had a million reasons
for not getting involved.

391
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,145
The American Jews knew

392
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,563
- exactly what was going on.

393
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,691
Can you imagine if every Jew
had marched on Washington proudly, huh?

394
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:12,942
Ned.

395
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,488
You don't remember me, do you?

396
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,867
It was at the baths a few years ago.

397
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,537
Come to Man's Country.

398
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,749
See what we're all about
and what we have to offer.

399
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:30,710
Man's Country is a full facility,
multi-level complex

400
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,630
that's designed
to feature something for everyone.

401
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,968
Come to Man's Country to develop your body
or a friendship with somebody else 's.

402
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,263
Visit us once
and you'll come again and again.

403
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,949
You would have thought I was applying
for the CIA the way you looked at me.

404
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,119
And then what happened?

405
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,502
I followed you into your room.

406
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:27,100
You couldn't even open your eyes.

407
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,937
You told me your real name was Alexander.

408
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,154
I asked what you did, and you said something
like you tried a number of things,

409
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,158
and I asked if that included love.

410
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:50,331
That's when you said, I have to get
up early in the morning." Yeah.

411
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,879
Men do not naturally not love.

412
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,718
They learn not to.

413
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:06,431
I think you're a bluffer.

414
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,719
How could I not remember you?

415
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:12,895
I don't know.

416
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,230
It was very dark.

417
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,430
Do you think we could start over?

418
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:23,406
Yeah.

419
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,713
When I was going to Yale,
I thought I was the only gay guy there.

420
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:21,798
I swear to God.

421
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,469
I went to this shrink
who tried to change me.

422
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:30,765
Now they have Gay Weeks there,
and they throw the best dances of anyone.

423
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,395
Imagine being able to dance
cheek to cheek with your boyfriend

424
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,814
during your bright college days.

425
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,655
Did you ever sleep with a woman?

426
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,745
- Hey.
- Her name was

427
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,249
- Delilah.
- Delilah?

428
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:01,337
She was a stand-in on this movie I wrote.

429
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:07,760
She was very nice, pretty,
always smiling at me.

430
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:12,640
So I asked a straight
friend to explain it to me.

431
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,351
I thought I knew,
but I just wanted to make sure.

432
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,813
And I had her to dinner

433
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:22,733
and afterwards,
what I deemed to be a suitable moment,

434
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,777
because I'd been communicating
with it down there,

435
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,947
"Are you ready?
Are you absolutely certain you're ready?"

436
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,742
And when it appeared,
Abercrombie was ready,

437
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:35,705
I picked her up, very Rhett Butler,
and carried her to my bed.

438
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,708
- Where I couldn't get it up.
- Oh!

439
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,960
- But“
- I can certainly relate to that.

440
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,547
In the middle of the night,
I woke up with this gigantic erection.

441
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,175
God knows how.

442
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:51,554
So I shake her shouting, "Please, stick
it in for me, Delilah." I was...

443
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,307
I was afraid it would
go away before I could,

444
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,560
while I was hunting for the right place
to put it.

445
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,315
And she did and I did and Abercrombie did.

446
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,859
Ugh...

447
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,238
The next morning, I woke up

448
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:15,828
and I, who had been under the spell of this
shrink who was determined to change me,

449
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,663
rushed into his office,

450
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:22,001
and I, who had been fucking with fellows
since the seventh grade,

451
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:27,548
hysterically, at the age of 32 proclaimed,
"Dr. Gillespie, I am no longer a virgin!"

452
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:30,176
Aw.

453
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,732
Here's in here. I think we'll catch him.

454
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:47,902
- Go ahead.
- So I just go over and say hello?

455
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:51,364
I told him I invited you
and we went to Yale together.

456
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,367
It's my farewell party. What's he gonna do?

457
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,619
Let's go.

458
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,956
His honor would like you to get lost.

459
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,320
- This is my friend, Ned Weeks.
- Yeah, we know who he is.

460
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,380
Mr. Mayor! We need your help!
There's this new disease.

461
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,623
You must have heard about it.

462
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,966
We need your help badly!

463
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,260
Get off me, you pigs! This is America!

464
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:15,221
Mr. Mayor! We're dying!

465
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:21,519
Okay, this is what Ned wrote for us
to send out.

466
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,898
"I am sick of guys moaning that giving up
careless sex until this blows over..."

467
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,441
NED ". "...is worse than death.

468
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:30,403
"I am sick of guys
that can only think with their cocks.

469
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,238
"I am sick of closeted gays.

470
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,740
"It's 1982 now, guys.
When you gonna come out?

471
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,993
"By 1983, you could be dead."

472
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:41,080
- That's nice.
- You're crazy.

473
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,915
Am I, Bruce? Do you really think so?

474
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,375
Aren't we supposed to
elect a president tonight?

475
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,418
Yes.

476
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,670
We can't tell people
how to live their lives, Ned.

477
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,756
The entire gay political
movement is fucking.

478
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:52,216
- Hi.
- Hi.

479
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,885
I'm very interested in starting up
some sort of services for the patients.

480
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,596
We've gotta start talking about them.

481
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,223
Also, there are a lot
of very scared people out there

482
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,827
and they're desperate for information.

483
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,102
- I'd like to start a hotline.
- Oh.

484
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,606
- Who's he?
- Ooh, he does not know who I am yet.

485
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,608
His name is Tommy Boatwright.

486
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:12,528
In real life, he is a hospital administrator.
Uh, he's here to help,

487
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,572
- and he's a Southern bitch.

488
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,032
Mr. Boatwright, Bruce Niles.

489
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:17,742
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

490
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:20,161
- You're very handsome.
- He knows.

491
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:26,542
What the fuck is this?
Was this your idea, Ned?

492
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,836
- I'm looking. What am I not seeing?
- Keep looking.

493
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,338
What we put for our return address.

494
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:33,966
Do you mean because the word "gay"
is on the envelope?

495
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,636
Fucking-A, yes, instead
of just our initials.

496
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,720
We can't send these out.

497
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,556
Excuse me, if we want anybody
to show up for this dance,

498
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,058
we have to get these out tonight.

499
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,518
We could go through and scratch out
the word "gay" with a magic marker.

500
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:45,770
- Oh, honey, 10,000 times?
- Why not?

501
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:49,398
Bruce, I have sympathy for kids living at
home on Long Island with their parents,

502
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,776
but the guys who are
getting these, I mean...

503
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:55,363
Look at you. You live at home. You live alone.
You own your own apartment.

504
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:56,846
Your mother lives in another state.

505
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:58,027
Okay, what about my mailman?

506
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:01,035
Oh, you don't expect me
to take you seriously.

507
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,079
- Yes, I do.
- Okay, ladies, behave.

508
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:06,832
Look, it's getting late
and we still haven't elected a president.

509
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:10,127
Neddy, I think that it should be Bruce.

510
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,673
Everybody knows him,
everybody likes him and everybody...

511
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,716
Because he's popular
and everybody's afraid of me?

512
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:16,759
Yes!

513
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,011
I mean, look at him. He's gorgeous.

514
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,256
And all the kids on Christopher Street
and Fire Island,

515
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,683
they'll feel a little bit more comfortable
following him.

516
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,643
- Just like high school.
- Yes!

517
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:29,939
All right. All those in favor of Bruce Niles
as our first president, raise their hand.

518
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,606
I don't think I want this.

519
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:37,196
Oh, come on. You're gorgeous
and we're all gonna follow you.

520
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,657
Fuck you. I accept.

521
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,076
Well, fuck you. Congratulations.

522
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:14,650
Felix, let's move somewhere far away, just
the two of us together on a desert island.

523
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:18,446
Don't you dare stop for one single second
what you're doing.

524
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:23,325
I appreciate you not yelling at me
about what The Times isn't doing

525
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,077
and my not being more political.

526
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,121
Why don't you?

527
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,291
It's a relief not having
to have to talk politics to someone.

528
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:32,501
- That's not the reason.
- No?

529
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,173
It's because you're too good to be true.

530
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,592
Because I've been waiting for a
lover like you my whole life,

531
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,343
and you haven't showed up until now,

532
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:44,513
and I'm scared shitless
that I'm gonna do something to fuck it up.

533
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:46,182
- Am I crazy?
- Of course.

534
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,311
That's why I'm here.

535
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:58,152
Now we're getting warm.

536
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,253
Did I look okay?

537
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:00,840
Could you tell
that I was wearing all this makeup?

538
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,800
You looked great.

539
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,513
- You have got to go see Emma.

540
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:10,099
Can we just forget about this?

541
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,684
I'm all right.

542
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,353
And if I'm not, I don't want to know,
because no one will hire me,

543
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:17,356
and if I can't work, I
just as soon be dead.

544
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:22,444
I haven't lost any weight.

545
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,656
I can still cover it up.

546
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,788
- I told you not to tell him.
- Sorry.

547
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,364
You're already afraid to kiss me?

548
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:41,338
That's not true.

549
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,385
It's okay. I'm afraid to let you.

550
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,109
I love you.

551
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:10,868
I'll walk him down.

552
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,794
Okay,
he's the third guy I've been with.

553
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:26,717
Reinhardt, Craig, and I don't know
what I'll do if Albert has this.

554
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:27,885
You're gonna fight.

555
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,804
We'll fight together.

556
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,934
You're my best friend, Ned Weeks.

557
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:38,187
You're my best friend
and I've never met anyone like you before.

558
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:42,232
- What do you mean "like me"?
- Like you meaning...

559
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:48,822
Where I'm from, I mean, I didn't even
see a Jew until I was in the army,

560
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:55,245
let alone a man that was smart, funny.

561
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,253
Decently good-looking.

562
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:09,969
My friends stopped hanging out with me
because they say I depress them.

563
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,513
So be it.

564
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,020
And you,

565
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,440
you don't look that Jewish.

566
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:26,529
Well, you don't look gay, so I guess
we could both pass for white people.

567
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,371
I love Albert.

568
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,666
Bruce, look at me.

569
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,126
I love him.

570
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,586
Albert's gonna make it.

571
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,092
And what if he doesn't?

572
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,889
Let's get you home.

573
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:11,780
- I'm a mess.
- Yeah.

574
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,464
- Classy moment.
- Yeah.

575
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:51,779
Okay.

576
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,252
When I finally get you where I want you,
I don't want you anymore.

577
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,758
Hey, Bruce, I'm in love, too.

578
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:27,689
Holy shit!

579
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:33,195
Queen control.
It really works when it wants to.

580
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:45,749
Oh, hey, Felix, this is Dick Lombardo.

581
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:46,792
Hi.

582
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,794
I finally got us someone on our board
who isn't a disco dummy.

583
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,462
Well, maybe tonight.

584
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:52,464
- I'll see you.
- Nice to meet you.

585
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:54,049
Come on, babe.

586
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:40,179
We are all so happy you joined us tonight!

587
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:46,476
We are proving that we are more
than just looks, brains, talent and heart!

588
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:51,273
Together, we raised
more than any gay group ever in this city!

589
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:58,197
And I want to call over Mr. Ned Weeks.

590
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:01,909
Don't be shy!

591
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,542
We did it!

592
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,920
We will now reveal
just how much we raised together.

593
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,048
In three, two, one.

594
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:19,051
$53,000!

595
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:29,603
MANI $53,000!

596
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,320
Gay Men's Health Crisis, come on up!

597
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:41,073
Felix, honey, come up please. Come up.

598
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,532
I love you.

599
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:47,037
Let's dance!

600
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:19,236
Someday he'll come along

601
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:22,322
The man I love

602
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:26,535
And he'll be big and strong

603
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:29,746
The man I love

604
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:33,834
And when he comes my way

605
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:36,295
I'll do my best

606
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:43,385
To make him stay

607
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,890
He'll look at me and smile

608
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:51,893
I'll understand

609
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:55,605
And in a little while

610
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:59,192
He'll take my hand

611
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:03,655
And though it seems absurd

612
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,907
I know we both

613
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:12,289
Won't say a word

614
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:18,920
Maybe I shall meet him someday

615
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:23,008
Maybe Monday

616
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:28,180
Maybe not

617
00:47:28,764 --> 00:47:31,933
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

618
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,769
Imagine if we had this when we were young.

619
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:36,938
No fear, no shame.

620
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:41,109
Maybe Tuesday will be my...

621
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,945
I was imagining all those years with you.

622
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:50,911
He'll build a little home

623
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,122
Just meant for two

624
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,918
From which I'll never roam

625
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:01,213
Who would, would you?

626
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:05,759
And so all else above

627
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:09,805
I'm waiting for the man I love

628
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:13,141
Felix Turner,
would you like to move in with me?

629
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:14,309
Yes.

630
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,144
- Yes?
- Yesterday.

631
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:18,814
Yes! Yes! Yes!

632
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,733
Yes! Yes!

633
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:32,869
I'm waiting for the man

634
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:33,995
I love

635
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:51,346
We are all walking time bombs
waiting for whatever it is to set us off.

636
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:59,146
Come on. We're almost there.

637
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:01,231
If this article
doesn't scare the shit out of you,

638
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:04,151
gay men may have no future here on Earth.

639
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:08,071
Our continued existence
depends on just how angry you can get.

640
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,201
They turned us away
from four emergency rooms.

641
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:15,620
- Come in!
- I think he's lost his mind!

642
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:18,290
- Ned, where can I take him?
- Put him on the couch there. I'll call Emma!

643
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,250
- God damn it!
- I'll get some water.

644
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:24,171
- How long has he been like this?
- A couple hours.

645
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,886
Well,
I'm glad you asked me that question.

646
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:32,429
What do I think?

647
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:36,683
I know that the government
is intentionally ignoring this epidemic.

648
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:40,270
You're accusing the government
of the United States

649
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,856
of a conspiracy to murder all gay men?

650
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:49,654
Yes.

651
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:53,408
Yes, you can say that.
Yes, Sarabeth, I am. Yes.

652
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:56,286
That is a powerful accusation.

653
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:00,290
This is an epidemic and it's being ignored
by the United States government.

654
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,542
- Intentionally?
- Intentionally being ignored.

655
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:06,254
This is a national emergency.
This is an epidemic. It's a plague!

656
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:09,341
You can't go on national TV and
accuse the government of murder, Ned.

657
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:10,383
Why not?

658
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:13,345
Because one day,
we're gonna get money, research, grants.

659
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:16,973
Congress still hasn't appropriated a dime.
The Mayor's still... On and on!

660
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:20,519
Ned, when you go public, you have no right
to speak for this organization

661
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:23,897
unless we have approved
what you have to say in advance.

662
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,106
You know, in point of fact,

663
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,386
you aren't even an officer
of this organization,

664
00:50:27,387 --> 00:50:29,402
and you shouldn't be
speaking for us at all!

665
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:31,947
Thank you for sharing that with me, Dick.

666
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:49,442
Why do you think the city has been so slow
to acknowledge and deal with this emergency?

667
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:54,344
You're implying that the city's recognized
and acknowledged this emergency, Malcom.

668
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,907
- It has not.
- Why not, do you think?

669
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,059
'Cause the Mayor is gay and he's scared shitless
out of his panties it'll blow his cover.

670
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:04,665
- What did he say? Get off! Commercial.
- Are we still rolling?

671
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:07,899
You can't tell me what to say
when I'm speaking for myself.

672
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:09,359
Bullshit. They all know you're one of us.

673
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,820
It is totally and politically incorrect
to call someone gay

674
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,572
who does not self-identify as being gay.

675
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:16,700
I know it's been that way forever, but
something different is going on here now.

676
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:17,742
We're dying.

677
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:19,546
The Mayor, he's a personal friend of yours.

678
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:21,329
You want him to appoint you a judge.

679
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:23,206
Do you have a little conflict of interest
going on here?

680
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,666
I told you. I sent him a memo.

681
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:25,789
- When?
- Through channels.

682
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:27,002
- When?
- He'll answer me.

683
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:30,880
When? There's 110 new cases this month!

684
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:33,216
Still, no meeting with our gay mayor.

685
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,218
No meeting with his gay assistant!

686
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,016
What, do I embarrass you, Bruce?

687
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:43,018
Yes. You do.

688
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:44,936
Yeah, you get more with honey
than with vinegar, babe.

689
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,438
God, no one's told me that one, Tommy.

690
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,481
No, obviously they haven't.

691
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:49,899
I don't believe that bullshit anyway.

692
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:52,027
We are in over our heads
with the patients we're trying to help.

693
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:55,363
Tommy, will you please read this report
out loud for Ned?

694
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:58,867
"We have trained
25 crisis counselors

695
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,120
"to help the newly diagnosed
in whatever needs that they might have.

696
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:04,039
"We have 12 group leaders

697
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:07,375
"who meet with these counselors at least
once a week to go over their clients.

698
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:12,005
"There are now 17 volunteer social workers,
psychologists and/or psychiatrists.

699
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,341
"We helped draw up 75 wills last..."

700
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:16,217
Seventy-five, Bruce.

701
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,136
You used to be a fighter once.

702
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,306
- Did you like being in the Green Berets?
- Yes. I loved it.

703
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,350
Have you completely forgotten how to fight?

704
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:25,477
Don't tell me how to fight.
I just fight differently than you do.

705
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,604
- I haven't seen your way yet.
- No?

706
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:30,315
Bruce, Albert may be dying.

707
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:31,650
You son of a bitch!

708
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:33,693
You say another word about him...

709
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:34,944
Relax.

710
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:37,322
And you,

711
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:42,827
you have no right being on this board unless
you put pressure on your friend, the Mayor.

712
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:45,789
That's why I asked you to join us
in the first place and you know it.

713
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:59,344
- No. No, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

714
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:01,174
No, you get your free
legal work from my firm.

715
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:02,895
I'm not gonna be on your
board of directors.

716
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:05,892
It's only for the stationery.
You don't have to do a thing.

717
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,353
That is just an evasion. If you thought
this was a straight disease...

718
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:09,896
It's got nothing to do with
you being gay.

719
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,981
What else does it have to do with?

720
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:13,525
One of these days I'm
gonna get you to agree

721
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,860
that over 20 million men and women
in this country

722
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:18,363
don't require the services
of a psychiatrist.

723
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,115
Look, try to understand.

724
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,991
You know, I read stuff. I see TV.

725
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:25,620
Guys in leather, chains,
dresses, high heels.

726
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,455
You know, I say to myself,
"This isn't Ned."

727
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:30,291
You know the media
always dramatizes the most extreme.

728
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,544
You guys have a dreadful image problem.

729
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:35,380
Well, that's why it's so important
to have people like you supporting us.

730
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,298
You already have your dignity.

731
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,718
We better get to lunch.
I've got an important meeting.

732
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,636
Do you? How important?

733
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:43,388
I'm asking for your support.

734
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:46,891
In every area I consider important,
you have my support.

735
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:50,854
And the only area that I consider important,
I don't have your support at all.

736
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:55,525
In some place deep down inside you,
you still think I'm sick, don't you?

737
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,444
I think you've adjusted
to life pretty well.

738
00:53:57,527 --> 00:53:58,570
All things considered.

739
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:00,739
I saw how unhappy you were.

740
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,908
So were you!
You wound up going to shrinks, too.

741
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:05,994
We grew up side by side.

742
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:08,705
We both felt the same about Mom and Pop.

743
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:13,042
I'll agree to the fact that I have any
number of awful character traits,

744
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:18,465
but not to the fact that whatever awful
things they did to us made me sick and gay

745
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,759
while you stayed straight and healthy.

746
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:23,094
We don't all react the
same way to the thing.

747
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:25,430
So you became a lawyer
and I became a writer.

748
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,640
Well, we have a difference of opinion
over theory.

749
00:54:27,724 --> 00:54:30,101
But your theory
turns me into a man from Mars.

750
00:54:30,185 --> 00:54:31,506
My theory doesn't do that to you.

751
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:36,191
Are you suggesting I did something wrong
in sending you into therapy so young?

752
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,777
I didn't know
you were gonna stay there forever.

753
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,621
I didn't think that I had done anything
wrong until you sent me there.

754
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:45,909
Ben, you mean more to me
than anyone in the whole world.

755
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:48,036
You always have.

756
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,454
Ben, you've gotta say it.

757
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,206
- Say what?
- I am the same as you.

758
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,749
Just say it. Say it.

759
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:01,216
No.

760
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:05,220
You're not.

761
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:08,932
I'm not gonna say it.

762
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:14,771
Every time I lose this fight, it hurts more.
I'm going home.

763
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,648
Oh, come on, Lemon.

764
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:18,149
I still love you.

765
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:20,652
Sarah still loves you.
The cat still loves you.

766
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:21,861
This is not a joke!

767
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:25,698
You have my love, my legal advice,
my financial supervision.

768
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:28,326
I can't give you the courage
to stand up to me and say

769
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,289
you don't give a flying fuck
about what I think!

770
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:34,582
Everybody's oppressed by somebody else
in some form or another.

771
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:40,755
Most of us learn to fight against it despite
people's opinions without the help of others.

772
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:44,551
Now stop trying to wring
some kind of admission of guilt out of me!

773
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:47,220
Agreeing that you were born
just the same as I was born

774
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:48,930
isn't gonna save your dying friends.

775
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:52,517
That is exactly what is going to save
my dying friends!

776
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,352
You make it sound like I'm the enemy!

777
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:57,605
I am beginning to think that
you and your straight world are our enemy!

778
00:55:57,689 --> 00:55:59,941
I am furious with you

779
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:04,320
and every goddamn doctor
who made me feel it was sick to love a man!

780
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:09,701
I am trying to understand
why nobody gives a shit that we're dying!

781
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:15,874
$5 million for a house?
We can't even get 27 cents from the city.

782
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:20,044
I know 43 guys who have died
and you say it's my cause, not yours?

783
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:22,755
You still think I'm sick!

784
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,343
I simply cannot allow it
for one single second longer.

785
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:32,390
I will not speak to you again
until you accept me as your equal!

786
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:35,310
Your healthy equal! Your brother!

787
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:47,322
Yeah, be careful with that, boys.
That is a precious antique.

788
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:48,615
- Easy.
- Mmm-hmm.

789
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,575
Don't you think
we should put that in the grand salon?

790
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,410
Do we have a basement?
That's where it should go.

791
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:55,053
Bella, I think it's time
we moved your filthy mouth above ground.

792
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,581
I'll decorate tomorrow.

793
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:58,917
Just shove it all in
there the best you can.

794
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,712
- Yeah, okay. Knock it off, both of you.

795
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:05,673
Excuse me.

796
00:57:05,757 --> 00:57:07,008
Yes? Hi.

797
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:08,259
Hi.

798
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:13,264
My name is Estelle,
and my best friend Harvey died last night.

799
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:19,646
We went everywhere together, you know?

800
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:24,442
Like Broadway and the Rockettes
and the ice skating.

801
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:29,238
He was a beautiful skater.

802
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:33,284
I'm a klutz, but he didn't care.

803
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,038
We had so much fun.

804
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,459
Damn it, I want to do something,

805
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:45,838
even though all my lesbian friends say,
"What have you guys ever done for us?"

806
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:47,548
But I don't care.

807
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:51,135
This is for Harvey.

808
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:55,056
Please.
Tell me you can use me for something.

809
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,853
Oh.

810
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:07,235
I need a hotline director.
Do you think you can do that?

811
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,737
- I don't know how.
- I don't either.

812
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:14,200
Hey.

813
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:19,330
Let me buy you a cup of coffee
and we'll figure this out, okay?

814
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,540
Okay.

815
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,803
- So, you want to set up here?
- Yeah, this is good, let's do it.

816
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,388
What are you doing?

817
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:37,974
- We're from the NBC affiliate.
- So?

818
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,226
This is the new
Gay Men's Health Crisis office?

819
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,603
- Who are you?
- I'm Bruce Niles. I'm the president.

820
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:45,527
I didn't sign any consent form
for you to film me or this establishment.

821
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:46,691
Please turn it off immediately.

822
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:48,067
- Right now.
- Don't touch my camera.

823
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:50,987
- Who sent you here?
- Somebody named Ned.

824
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:53,614
Weeks.

825
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:54,782
- Oh, great, you're here.

826
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,451
- Anybody homo?
- Son of a bitch.

827
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,161
Hello, is this thing rolling?

828
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:01,539
Look at this!
We're in both of them the same week!

829
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:06,169
Every major network,
and now finally, our very first office.

830
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:09,464
I want to introduce you to our gay
president who's in the closet,

831
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,466
and he's so handsome, don't you think?

832
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:15,094
Such a very handsome cover boy
going to waste.

833
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,099
Oh, great. Now you fight.
Great! Fight, Bruce!

834
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:22,602
You make me sound like a coward
and I'm not a coward.

835
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,187
You know what? You have nothing to lose.

836
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,230
Your brother invested for you
so you have income.

837
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:30,693
You can be gay 24/7, Ned, but I can't.
I can't. So fuck you!

838
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:32,236
No, fuck you, Bruce.

839
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:35,239
- Man!
- Oh, oh, oh! Jesus!

840
00:59:37,075 --> 00:59:40,578
When I look at you, I
am filled with despair.

841
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:43,164
When I look at you,
I worry we're not gonna win.

842
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,957
How do you think this country was founded?

843
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:48,544
I thought I was getting started
with Paul Revere, not some coward.

844
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:55,259
Ned, look at me! Look at me! Look at me!

845
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,639
We are doomed if we do it your way. Doomed!

846
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,933
How are they gonna help us
if they don't know who we are?

847
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,852
They won't help us, Ned, if they do.

848
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:13,277
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, wait.

849
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:15,029
Come on! Come on!

850
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,656
Shit.

851
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:19,450
Shit!

852
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,676
Okay, I'll get it. Sure.

853
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:41,222
Hello? Yeah, you are our very first call.
How can I help you?

854
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,352
I'm sorry. You have the wrong number.

855
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,568
You two gotta
pull your shit together now, okay?

856
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:57,363
And you need to stop being
such a fucking drama queen.

857
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:58,906
God damn.

858
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:02,160
This is Estelle.

859
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:04,328
Hey.

860
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:06,455
How's it going?

861
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:07,957
Welcome.

862
01:01:59,217 --> 01:02:03,054
Well, we have four hands and two incomes.
You're not getting any younger, you know.

863
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,973
All right. Let's leave my age out of this.

864
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:16,651
- Very beautiful in the country.
- Very quiet in the country.

865
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:23,074
- No, no. Don't you dare.
- I have to.

866
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:26,958
You didn't leave this number
on your machine...

867
01:02:28,496 --> 01:02:29,664
- You promised.
- Hello?

868
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:33,334
I do think we should picket the Mayor.

869
01:02:34,252 --> 01:02:37,421
Yes, I said that and I stand by that.
Thank you.

870
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:39,840
- You promised.

871
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:41,759
No, no, no, no, no, no.

872
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:42,927
Wait.

873
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:53,312
"And every gay man who is unable to come
forward and fight to save his own life

874
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,481
"is truly helping to kill the rest of us."

875
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,901
How many of us have to die before you get
scared off your ass and into action?

876
01:02:58,985 --> 01:02:59,986
Thank you.

877
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:03,990
Who was that?

878
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,287
I hear it's being called
the Ned Weeks School of Outrage.

879
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:14,041
I did speak to one of
our science reporters.

880
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,377
- What'd he say?
- It turns out he's gay and he won't...

881
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:19,964
Don't yell at me.

882
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,128
All those shrinks,
they must have done something right.

883
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:29,849
- Dr. Ritvo, Dr. Malev.
- Malev.

884
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:32,393
Dr. Gillespie.

885
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,564
Dr. Patti, Dr. Maxine, Dr. Laverne.

886
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,152
Why does it have to take so long?

887
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,404
All you ever eat is desserts.

888
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:46,567
Sugar is the most important thing in life.
All the rest is just to stay alive.

889
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:49,410
Mmm.

890
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:55,124
Argh!

891
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:59,170
- Shit.
- What?

892
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:03,174
The fucking board! They say I'm causing a
panic, that I'm making myself a celebrity.

893
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:08,012
Not one of them will be interviewed or
appear on TV, so I do it all by default.

894
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:11,474
And you're becoming a leader.
And you love to fight.

895
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:14,685
- I like to fight? Moi?
- Who, you? Yeah.

896
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:16,687
And you're having a great time.

897
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:18,272
I am.

898
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:24,612
It's funny, I never wanted to be a leader.
I'm not doing very well.

899
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:27,365
It's sad how much time we lost.

900
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:29,784
We just weren't ready then.

901
01:04:36,749 --> 01:04:40,252
If I had it, would you leave me?

902
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:46,384
I don't know.

903
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:50,721
Would you if I did?

904
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:51,806
No.

905
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:54,809
How do you know?

906
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:58,354
Because my mother ran the local chapter of
the Red Cross, and she put me to work

907
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:01,732
in the blood mobile when I was eight.

908
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,442
I'm not programmed for anything else.

909
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,098
Ned, I have something to tell you.

910
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:11,450
You're finally pregnant?

911
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:16,997
I was married once.

912
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,962
You never told me that.

913
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:24,630
Yeah, I...

914
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:29,093
She said I had been unfair to her,
which I had been.

915
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:32,888
I have a son.

916
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:34,515
You have a son?

917
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:36,559
She won't let me see him.

918
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:37,935
You can't see your own son?

919
01:05:39,145 --> 01:05:40,771
But didn't you fight?

920
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:44,066
That means you're ashamed,
so he will be, too.

921
01:05:45,693 --> 01:05:49,530
This is why I didn't tell you.
Who says I didn't fight, Ned?

922
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,658
Well, what happens to people who can't be
as strong as you want them to be?

923
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:55,119
Weakness scares the shit out of me.

924
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:58,372
My father was weak
and I'm afraid I'll be like him.

925
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:01,500
His life didn't stand for anything
and then it was over!

926
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:03,836
So I fight constantly, and if I can do it,

927
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:07,798
I can't understand why everybody else
can't do it too, okay?

928
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:11,385
Where are you going?
Felix, where are you going?

929
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:21,395
Felix, I didn't mean anything by that, Felix.
I'm scared of lots of things, really.

930
01:06:21,479 --> 01:06:24,607
Heights. I never told
you I'm terrified of...

931
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,025
What?

932
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:46,128
It's... it keeps getting bigger and bigger.
It doesn't go away.

933
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:00,309
Felix.

934
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:06,232
Who, may I ask, is Felix?

935
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:10,694
I've never been so in love in my life.

936
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:12,947
I've never been in love in my life.

937
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:18,452
Tell him to come see me
first thing tomorrow, 7:30.

938
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,162
Ned, God damn it.

939
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:23,415
What am I supposed to do,
not be with anybody ever?

940
01:07:23,499 --> 01:07:25,584
It's not as easy as you might think.

941
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:29,129
- Oh, Emma, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

942
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:33,801
How'd you get it?

943
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:36,929
I was five years old.

944
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:40,516
A woman from the Bahamas came to our town
carrying the polio virus.

945
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,063
She stayed with friends.
Their kid was in my kindergarten class.

946
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:49,650
Four of us in that class got polio.

947
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:56,073
I was all dressed up in my Halloween
costume to go trick or treating,

948
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:59,660
and my mother felt my forehead,
put me to bed.

949
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:02,788
In the middle of the night,
I realized my whole body

950
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:05,541
except my arms and my hands were paralyzed.

951
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:10,462
I was crying out for my mother,
"I can't move. I can't move."

952
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:16,260
They rushed me to the hospital,
were told I'd be dead in 24 hours.

953
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,386
I fought. I lived.

954
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:19,138
Were you in an iron lung?

955
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:21,599
- I was.

956
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:24,226
Then I was in bed at home.

957
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:29,440
I was connected to my
class with this little,

958
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:33,319
little loud speaker.

959
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:36,238
All the children were required to visit me.

960
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:42,453
We would say, "Hello,"
and then not know what to say next.

961
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:49,293
They were all terrified of me. Still are.
I scare the shit out of people.

962
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:52,880
The holy terror in a wheelchair.

963
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,174
I'm scaring people, too.

964
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:59,970
Learn how to use it.
Don't need everybody's love and approval.

965
01:09:01,972 --> 01:09:05,017
Ned, your organization is worthless.

966
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:07,186
I can't get anyone important on the board.

967
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:09,938
I've seen over 300
patients, me, one doctor.

968
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:15,778
All these guys who made millions off of us,
fashion, rock, movies, real estate, forget it.

969
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:20,074
And anytime Bruce doesn't agree with me,
he puts it to a board vote.

970
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,200
And you lose.

971
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:25,579
I can't pass along sex recommendations
or any information that isn't 100% certain.

972
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:30,125
Nothing is 100% certain in science.
It wouldn't matter what you say anyway.

973
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,961
Don't yell at me for what I'm not doing.
What the fuck is your side doing?

974
01:09:33,045 --> 01:09:34,646
- I don't know!
- Well, where's your AMA?

975
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,427
Does being Jewish always make you hungry?

976
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:41,804
I don't know. I'm not Jewish.

977
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:44,807
I'm German.

978
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:49,812
- Everybody thinks you're Jewish.
- I know.

979
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:50,896
In medicine, it helps.

980
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:57,027
You stayed in bed
the whole way through school?

981
01:09:58,362 --> 01:10:03,325
By college I had my first braces
and I could walk a little.

982
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:07,204
I don't walk so good anymore,
probably because I'm too busy to practice.

983
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:12,418
You must practice. Right now. I mean it.

984
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:14,920
Right now. Come on.

985
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:16,922
- Don't scratch my Mathis.

986
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:27,474
May I have this dance?

987
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:34,231
Okay. You asked for it.

988
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:40,779
Give me crutches.

989
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:47,745
Mmm. Thank you.

990
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:06,346
Mmm-mmm. I got it.

991
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:12,770
Oh! Okay. Okay.

992
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:14,021
Mmm-mmm.

993
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,586
I'm afraid to leave him alone now.

994
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:41,673
I'm afraid a cure won't come in time.

995
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:45,302
I'm afraid of my anger.

996
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:47,971
I'm a terrible leader and...

997
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:49,640
A lousy dancer. Put me back.

998
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:11,245
Polio was a virus, too.

999
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,252
Nobody gets polio anymore.

1000
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:48,615
Where is he? I mean, we've been here
for an hour and a half.

1001
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:51,611
Who are these people?
We're in a fucking dungeon here!

1002
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:56,999
He can't do this to us. He cannot
do this to us and get away with it.

1003
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:01,753
- Did you start? No? Thank God. Hi.
- Hi.

1004
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:03,547
Jesus Christ, what a tomb.

1005
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:06,174
What, do they not want us
to be seen above ground?

1006
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:08,051
Where is he? I'm an hour late.

1007
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:10,721
- An hour and a half.
- Yeah, don't start on me, lamb chop.

1008
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:13,807
- Tommy, where were you?
- I was up at Bellevue.

1009
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:17,394
I had to put a sweet, dying child together
with his momma.

1010
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:21,106
They hadn't seen each other
for 15 years.

1011
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:24,192
He never told her he was gay.
He didn't want to see her.

1012
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:28,947
He refused to see her for weeks. Oh, he
was angry when I waltzed in with her.

1013
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:35,746
That was a real weeper,
momma holding her son. He's dead now.

1014
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:42,127
I'm truly sorry I'm late.
I'm Hiram Keebler.

1015
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:43,253
- Hello.
- Hi.

1016
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:46,089
Are you related to the folks who make
the crackers? I'm kidding.

1017
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,425
- I'm Tommy Boatwright.
- Ned Weeks.

1018
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:52,262
Bruce Niles. I'm the president.

1019
01:13:52,346 --> 01:13:54,932
The Mayor wants you to know how much
he cares and how impressed he is

1020
01:13:55,015 --> 01:13:58,185
with how you've been shouldering
your own responsibilities.

1021
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:01,605
- Thank you.
- Thank you? Responsibilities?

1022
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:04,483
Everything we're doing is the stuff you
guys should be doing, and we need help.

1023
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:07,611
What Mr. Weeks is trying to say,
sir, is that we're swamped,

1024
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:11,823
and we're fielding over 500 calls a day
on our emergency hotline,

1025
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:15,953
and we're providing information that quite
frankly the city should be providing and isn't.

1026
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:18,246
Sir, we need office space.
We have one small room.

1027
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:20,892
We have over 100 people calling
or walking in and out every day,

1028
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:23,627
and plus, it's real hard when
people don't want to rent to us because...

1029
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,296
- Oh, that's illegal discrimination.
- Yeah, we know that to be true, sir.

1030
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,021
Mr. Keebler, it is not illegal
to discriminate against homosexuals.

1031
01:14:29,049 --> 01:14:31,593
We've been waiting for 14 months
to see the Mayor.

1032
01:14:31,677 --> 01:14:33,220
It's taken us a year
to get this meeting with you.

1033
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:34,721
You're an hour and a half late.

1034
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:36,974
Have you told the Mayor
there's an epidemic going on?

1035
01:14:37,057 --> 01:14:38,517
- Says who?
- The government.

1036
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,686
Which government? What, our government?
An epidemic?

1037
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:43,230
- The Centers for Disease Control declared...
- Seventeen months ago.

1038
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:44,564
You can't not know this!

1039
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:46,191
Will you please reduce
your level of hysteria?

1040
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:47,693
Certainly.

1041
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:54,116
New York City, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Denver,

1042
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:57,828
every single major American city is now
showing cases.

1043
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:01,415
At least 25 foreign countries,
but New York City, our home,

1044
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:04,710
the city that you have pledged to protect
has more than half of everything.

1045
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:06,503
Half the cases, half the dead.

1046
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:09,256
I know 57 of the dead ones.
I don't want to know any more.

1047
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:11,258
Now, when do we get to see the Mayor?

1048
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:13,593
Fourteen months is a long time
to be out to lunch.

1049
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:16,430
- You wait a minute.
- No, you wait a minute. We can't.

1050
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:20,600
Time is not on our side. Now if you won't
take word to the man, what are we gonna do?

1051
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:23,520
Hire a hunky hustler
and send him up to Gracie Mansion

1052
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:24,938
with a plea tattooed to his cock?

1053
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:26,773
Mayor Koch is not gay!

1054
01:15:26,857 --> 01:15:29,985
- Oh, come on, Blanche!

1055
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:34,823
Listen, don't you think I want to help you?

1056
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:40,704
I have a friend who is dying of this shit
right now in the VA hospital.

1057
01:15:41,288 --> 01:15:42,289
But it's very tricky.

1058
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:45,083
You can see that. It is very tricky.

1059
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:49,046
Tricky, shit. There are a million gay people
in New York, a million and one counting you!

1060
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:52,716
You know what? A fire goes out
in a school furnace on the West Side,

1061
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:56,970
I get 3,000 calls in one day.
You know what I mean?

1062
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:01,266
If so many of you are so upset,
why am I only hearing from this loud mouth?

1063
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,726
That's a very good question.

1064
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:05,937
Okay, so there are half a million
gay men in our area.

1065
01:16:06,021 --> 01:16:11,234
315 cases doesn't seem too high considering
how many of us, of you, there are.

1066
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:12,861
- This is bullshit!
- Ned, please.

1067
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:15,906
Look, I understand this is tricky,
sir, but we need your help.

1068
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:18,575
I think, that is, the Mayor thinks,
you guys are overreacting.

1069
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:24,331
You tell that cocksucker
he is a selfish, heartless son of a bitch.

1070
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:32,214
You are Michael R. Marcus.

1071
01:16:32,297 --> 01:16:34,758
You hold an unsecure job
with the city's Department of Health.

1072
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,642
I'd watch out for your
friends if I were you.

1073
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:50,565
I don't believe that just happened.

1074
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:54,653
Mickey, I am going on The Today Show
tomorrow and I am telling them

1075
01:16:54,736 --> 01:16:57,823
that the Mayor just threatened your job
to shut us up!

1076
01:16:57,906 --> 01:16:59,658
The Today Show? You're gonna what?

1077
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:02,869
They are treating us like shit
and we're allowing them!

1078
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:06,498
No politicians... The only thing
they really respond to is pressure!

1079
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:11,002
You heard him with his 3,000 West Side calls!
We're not yelling loud enough!

1080
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:19,803
Get your stuff. Get your stuff.

1081
01:17:39,114 --> 01:17:43,118
- This is Tommy. Hey.
- Tommy, it's Ned. Nick died.

1082
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:48,415
Shit. God damn.

1083
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:53,378
I'll call later when I know more
about the memorial.

1084
01:18:00,302 --> 01:18:01,887
I have this tradition.

1085
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:06,057
It's something I do now when a friend dies.

1086
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:10,937
I save his Rolodex card.

1087
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:17,235
What am I supposed to do? Throw it
away in the trashcan? I won't do that.

1088
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:22,032
No, I won't. It's too final.

1089
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:27,495
Last year, I had five cards.

1090
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:32,000
Now I have 50.

1091
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:36,463
A collection of cardboard tombstones
bound together with a rubber band.

1092
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:42,552
I hate these fucking funerals. I really do.

1093
01:18:44,346 --> 01:18:48,391
And you know what else I hate?
I hate the memorials.

1094
01:18:48,475 --> 01:18:51,978
That's our social life now,
going to these things.

1095
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:02,072
Nick was a choreographer.

1096
01:19:02,155 --> 01:19:04,950
I don't know if any of you knew that.

1097
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:08,078
He was just starting out.
He didn't tell a lot of people.

1098
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:13,291
He was waiting to invite you
to his big debut at Carnegie Hall

1099
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,878
or some shit so we could
all be proud of him.

1100
01:19:19,506 --> 01:19:22,717
But he was so good.

1101
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:25,387
He had such promise.

1102
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:31,893
We're losing an entire generation.

1103
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:36,147
Young men at the beginning, just gone.

1104
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:43,363
Choreographers, playwrights,
dancers, actors,

1105
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:48,910
all those plays that won't get written now,

1106
01:19:51,413 --> 01:19:54,916
all those dances never to be danced.

1107
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:03,008
In closing, I'm just gonna say I'm mad.

1108
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:06,303
I'm fucking mad.

1109
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:10,181
I keep screaming inside,
"Why are they letting us die?

1110
01:20:10,265 --> 01:20:12,392
"Why is no one helping us?"

1111
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:20,900
And here's the truth. Here's the answer.

1112
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:26,823
They just don't like us.

1113
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:42,899
I'm going to beat this.

1114
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:48,613
I've always been lucky.

1115
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:52,033
Good. That's the right attitude.

1116
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:57,705
I wanted a job on The Times, I got it.

1117
01:21:58,123 --> 01:21:59,833
I wanted Ned.

1118
01:22:05,046 --> 01:22:06,506
Have I given it to Ned?

1119
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:08,716
I don't know.

1120
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:20,603
One person has a cold, sometimes
the partner catches it, sometimes not.

1121
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:24,357
Some doctors are saying
it's okay if we use condoms.

1122
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:25,483
I know they are.

1123
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,041
- Can we kiss?
- Felix,

1124
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:46,129
you have nothing to fight back with.
You have no immune system to speak of.

1125
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:49,174
Your body is now open to
every conceivable type of infection.

1126
01:22:49,257 --> 01:22:52,177
You must be careful.
I'm going to do my damnedest. So must you.

1127
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:57,765
- I bet you say that to all the boys.
- As a matter of fact,

1128
01:22:58,766 --> 01:22:59,767
I do.

1129
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,502
Oh, God.

1130
01:23:30,548 --> 01:23:31,925
Oh.

1131
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:42,393
Once upon a time, there was a little boy who
always wanted to love another little boy.

1132
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:45,939
One day, he finally found that love,
and it was wonderful.

1133
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,362
I'm supposed to use gloves. I'm supposed to
do this. I'm supposed to do that.

1134
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:54,197
I'm supposed to not kiss him.

1135
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,240
I'm so sorry.

1136
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:57,617
I'm not supposed to be only 45 years old

1137
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:02,497
and taking care of a 35-year-old young man
who's 100 years old and dying.

1138
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:08,920
Emma calls it a seesaw.

1139
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:14,509
He's fine. He gets sick. He gets better.

1140
01:24:17,554 --> 01:24:19,472
He gets sicker.

1141
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:22,809
God help me.

1142
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:38,449
He's afraid I'll leave him.

1143
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,660
I told him I wouldn't leave him,

1144
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:45,290
that I never, for one second,
would think of leaving him.

1145
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:47,375
But he doesn't believe me.

1146
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:53,006
It's hard to believe in much these days.

1147
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:56,593
But we must never stop believing
in each other.

1148
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:05,560
I'm a mess. That's what I am.

1149
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:13,109
You cry and you cry
until you think you can't cry anymore.

1150
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:17,488
And then you cry some more.

1151
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:26,789
Not only for yourself and Felix,
but for all the little boys

1152
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:29,834
who finally found their other little boys
they've wanted all their lives

1153
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,253
now that we're men.

1154
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:39,177
- GMHC.

1155
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,845
Estelle speaking. How may I assist you?

1156
01:25:41,346 --> 01:25:42,472
Someone needs a will.

1157
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:43,890
Where's Ned? I want to speak to him.

1158
01:25:43,973 --> 01:25:45,516
- He's in the back.
- Here, give him this number.

1159
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,601
GMHC.

1160
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:47,727
GMHC.

1161
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:51,314
Tommy, I think I got us maybe
four qualified social workers to volunteer.

1162
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:53,191
They're all lesbians.

1163
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:54,609
- Thank God for the lesbians.

1164
01:25:54,692 --> 01:26:00,198
Your anus? Oh, Planet Uranus.
Thank you for sharing.

1165
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:03,942
Mickey, why aren't you in Rio?

1166
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:06,996
I put the phones on service.
You guys should get some rest.

1167
01:26:07,372 --> 01:26:09,791
We don't want any burn-out.

1168
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:12,752
- Good night, Phil. Thank you.
- Good night, honey.

1169
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:15,380
- Night. Good night, sweetie.
- Bye, baby.

1170
01:26:15,463 --> 01:26:17,590
- Good work today.
- All right.

1171
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:24,263
Phil got diagnosed today.

1172
01:26:29,477 --> 01:26:31,396
Mickey, why aren't you on vacation in Rio?

1173
01:26:31,938 --> 01:26:34,941
I was in Rio. Gregory and I were in Rio.

1174
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:39,862
I get a call from Hiram's office
saying I should be in his office

1175
01:26:39,946 --> 01:26:41,239
right away first thing this morning.

1176
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:43,074
From Rio? What kind of meeting?

1177
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:48,496
I get to City Hall.
Hiram keeps me waiting forever,

1178
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:51,332
and finally the commissioner comes out
and he says

1179
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:54,293
that Hiram doesn't want to see me anymore.

1180
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:59,966
I wanted to scream, "I haven't slept
in two days, you dumb fuck!"

1181
01:27:01,718 --> 01:27:07,640
But I didn't. Instead, I said, "Please,
sir, then why did he make me come

1182
01:27:07,724 --> 01:27:10,643
"all the way back from Rio?"

1183
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:14,230
And he says, "Oh, I'm afraid
he didn't take me into his confidence,"

1184
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:16,023
and he walks off.

1185
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:22,029
Ned's article attacking
Hiram just came out.

1186
01:27:22,113 --> 01:27:25,116
I'm not gonna lose my job
because Ned doesn't like himself.

1187
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,200
What's that, Mick?

1188
01:27:28,369 --> 01:27:31,748
You keep trying to get us to say things
that we don't want to say,

1189
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:35,543
and I don't think we can afford to make so
many enemies before we have enough friends.

1190
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:40,757
Terry Spalding is calling all of his friends
from under his oxygen tank to say goodbye.

1191
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:45,928
Tibby Maurer took an overdose.
Hal Schechter has got stumps for feet.

1192
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:47,930
Frannie Santuzza has lost his mind.

1193
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:49,599
Will you stop it? Just stop!

1194
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:53,436
- Mickey, are you all right?
- I don't think so.

1195
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,273
Why can't they find the virus?

1196
01:27:58,024 --> 01:27:59,025
Baby, it takes time.

1197
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:05,072
I work all day for this city writing
stuff on breast feeding versus formula

1198
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:06,783
and how to stay calm when you have herpes,

1199
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:09,952
and at night, I work on our newsletter
and our health column for The Native,

1200
01:28:10,036 --> 01:28:12,205
and I don't... I just...

1201
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:17,251
I can't take it anymore.
I have written about every single theory.

1202
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:20,880
Repeated infection by a virus,
new appearance by a dormant virus,

1203
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:24,072
single virus, new virus,
old virus, multi-virus,

1204
01:28:24,073 --> 01:28:26,928
partial virus, latent
virus, mutant virus...

1205
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:29,138
Okay. Okay. Take it easy, honey.

1206
01:28:29,222 --> 01:28:31,943
No, we mustn't forget about fucking and
sucking and kissing and blood

1207
01:28:31,974 --> 01:28:35,937
and voodoo and drugs and paupers
and needles and Africa, Haiti, Cuba,

1208
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:40,107
blacks, amoebas, pigs, fucking Uranus!

1209
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:45,313
What if it isn't any of them?

1210
01:28:45,822 --> 01:28:46,906
I don't know.

1211
01:28:47,907 --> 01:28:50,952
The Great Plague of London was caused
by drinking water from a pump

1212
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:54,539
that just, nobody noticed it.

1213
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:58,876
Maybe it's predisposition or there's just
the theory of the herd.

1214
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:03,214
Only so many of us are gonna get it
and then the pool's used up.

1215
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:07,510
What's if it's monogamy? Bruce, you
and I could actually be worse off

1216
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:11,389
because of constant bombardment
from a single source, our lovers.

1217
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:15,309
So maybe the guys who go to the baths,
maybe they've built up the best immunity.

1218
01:29:15,393 --> 01:29:19,397
I don't know. I don't know what to tell
anybody anymore, and everybody asks me.

1219
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:22,942
Who's right? I don't know. Who's wrong?

1220
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:28,072
I feel so fucking inadequate.
How can we tell people, "Stop"?

1221
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:32,285
It's just, I don't... it
might be caused by...

1222
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:33,828
I don't know. I don't know.

1223
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:35,621
That's exactly how I feel.

1224
01:29:36,998 --> 01:29:40,084
And maybe he's right. And that scares me.

1225
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:45,715
Neddy, you scare me.
You really think the President,

1226
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,174
that he wants this to happen?

1227
01:29:47,258 --> 01:29:50,469
You really think the CIA
has unleashed germ warfare

1228
01:29:50,595 --> 01:29:53,139
to kill off all the queers
that Jerry Falwell doesn't want?

1229
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:55,516
- Mick, try to hold on.
- To what?

1230
01:29:56,976 --> 01:29:58,853
I used to love my country.

1231
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:01,336
The Native received an anonymous letter
describing top secret

1232
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:04,233
Defense Department experiments
at Fort Detrick, Maryland,

1233
01:30:04,317 --> 01:30:07,820
that have produced a virus
that can destroy the immune system.

1234
01:30:07,904 --> 01:30:09,739
Its code name was "Firm Hand."

1235
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:12,742
They started testing it in 1978
on a group of gays.

1236
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,535
I never used to believe shit like this.

1237
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:17,914
They're gonna persecute us.
They're gonna cancel our health insurance.

1238
01:30:17,997 --> 01:30:19,916
They're gonna put us into camps.
They're gonna quarantine us.

1239
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:21,667
And you think that I'm killing people?

1240
01:30:21,751 --> 01:30:22,919
That is not what I said.

1241
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:25,671
It is! You know you said it.

1242
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:31,677
I've spent 15 years of my life fighting for
our right to be free and to make love

1243
01:30:31,761 --> 01:30:35,389
wherever, whenever, and you're telling me
all those years of what being gay stood for

1244
01:30:35,473 --> 01:30:38,976
is wrong and that I'm a murderer!

1245
01:30:41,187 --> 01:30:45,483
We have been so oppressed.
Don't you remember?

1246
01:30:45,608 --> 01:30:51,697
Can't you see how important it is for us to
love openly without hiding, without guilt?

1247
01:30:53,032 --> 01:30:55,868
Why can't you see that?

1248
01:30:59,789 --> 01:31:01,749
I went to the top of the
Empire State Building.

1249
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:03,125
Okay, I'm taking you home.

1250
01:31:03,209 --> 01:31:05,086
You can jump off from there
when nobody's looking.

1251
01:31:05,169 --> 01:31:08,005
All right, Mickey.
Let's go home right now.

1252
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:16,722
I'm not a murderer. I'm not.

1253
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:23,020
All my life I've been hated for being gay,
for being short, for being Jewish.

1254
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,260
So go ahead. You tell everybody.

1255
01:31:25,314 --> 01:31:27,483
Tell everybody that we were wrong
and I'm sorry.

1256
01:31:27,566 --> 01:31:31,570
Someday, somebody's gonna come along
and they're gonna stick the knife in you

1257
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:34,949
and tell you everything that
you've fought for your whole life is shit!

1258
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:39,245
Mickey! Mickey! Get up! Get up. Get up.

1259
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,539
- It's okay.
- Come on.

1260
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:45,793
I'm gonna take you home now, okay?

1261
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:49,380
I don't want to go home.
Take me to St. Vincent's.

1262
01:31:50,047 --> 01:31:53,551
Okay. That's fine. Come. Let's go.

1263
01:31:55,011 --> 01:31:58,097
Look, we're all real tired, you hear me?

1264
01:31:58,264 --> 01:32:02,184
We got ourselves here
a lot of bereavement overload.

1265
01:32:09,275 --> 01:32:12,737
We're the fighters. Aren't we? We're the...

1266
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:16,532
You bet, sweetness. And you're a hero.

1267
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:20,119
You hear me?
You're a hero whether you know that or not.

1268
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:24,790
You're our first hero. Let's go.

1269
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:38,387
- You want to be president?
- I just want Felix to live.

1270
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:53,694
Gay Men's Health Crisis.

1271
01:32:53,778 --> 01:32:56,405
Hiram, old buddy, how's it hanging?

1272
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:06,123
Mmm.

1273
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:12,838
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1274
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:17,551
The Mayor's found a secret little fund
for giving away money secretly.

1275
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:21,222
We are not allowed to tell anyone
where we got it, and if we do,

1276
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:22,348
we'll never get any more.

1277
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,684
- How much?
- $9,000.

1278
01:33:27,353 --> 01:33:28,395
Ned.

1279
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:33,692
Albert's dead.

1280
01:33:37,488 --> 01:33:41,742
His mother wanted to see him in Phoenix
before he died,

1281
01:33:41,826 --> 01:33:45,204
and this was the last
week when it was obvious,

1282
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:48,958
so I got permission from Emma
and took him to the airport.

1283
01:33:58,259 --> 01:33:59,499
And when we got to the airport,

1284
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:03,556
the pilot refused to fly the plane,

1285
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:07,309
so I refused to get off of it.

1286
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:10,062
You would have been very proud of me, Ned.

1287
01:34:11,397 --> 01:34:13,899
So finally we get another pilot,

1288
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:17,194
and when we take off,

1289
01:34:18,863 --> 01:34:20,906
Albert just loses his mind.

1290
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:24,204
- I don't want to be in this plane.
- It's okay.

1291
01:34:24,285 --> 01:34:25,661
I don't want to be in this...

1292
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:27,288
I'm just gonna go.

1293
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:30,875
- No. Albert.
- I don't want to be here.

1294
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:32,678
- I don't want to...
- Tell him to sit down.

1295
01:34:33,919 --> 01:34:35,421
Sorry. Sorry.

1296
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:37,965
Sir? Sir? You have to keep seated.

1297
01:34:38,924 --> 01:34:39,925
Sit down!

1298
01:34:40,009 --> 01:34:42,219
- Sir, I repeat. You have...
- No!

1299
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:45,598
- Sir! Sir!
- Stop!

1300
01:34:46,265 --> 01:34:49,435
You have to sit down, okay?

1301
01:34:49,602 --> 01:34:52,354
- Get him back in his seat.
- He doesn't recognize me.

1302
01:34:54,148 --> 01:34:55,608
It's me.

1303
01:34:55,691 --> 01:34:57,067
He doesn't know where we're going.

1304
01:34:57,151 --> 01:34:58,194
We're almost home.

1305
01:34:58,277 --> 01:35:00,446
That we're going to see his mother
in Phoenix, nothing.

1306
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:04,491
He just becomes...

1307
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,330
Oh, shit. Can I get a
goddamn towel, please?

1308
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:12,708
When we land in Phoenix
and when we get to the hospital

1309
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:16,754
where his mother had fixed up
the room real nice,

1310
01:35:20,466 --> 01:35:21,967
Albert's dead.

1311
01:35:27,348 --> 01:35:31,560
The hospital doctors refused to examine
him and give him a cause of death

1312
01:35:31,644 --> 01:35:34,355
on his death certificate.
Without the death certificate,

1313
01:35:34,438 --> 01:35:37,858
the undertakers will not take him
and neither would the police.

1314
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:39,568
Come on, man. Pull it down.

1315
01:35:40,653 --> 01:35:43,530
Finally, some orderly comes
and then stuffs my Albert

1316
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,743
in an oversized Glad garbage bag
and puts him in the alley

1317
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:49,328
with the rest of the garbage.

1318
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:55,626
I did you a favor, man. I got him out.
I want 50 bucks.

1319
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:21,068
Is that all of him?

1320
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:24,989
Yep. You want him? $3,000.

1321
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,708
He's gone. He's gone.

1322
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:38,544
Oh, my God.

1323
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:44,591
Oh, God.

1324
01:36:47,344 --> 01:36:50,723
I am telling you, they are murdering us
and we are letting them.

1325
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:52,683
- We're gonna die.

1326
01:36:52,766 --> 01:36:54,310
We're gonna die very soon

1327
01:36:54,393 --> 01:36:57,146
unless you get off your fucking asses
and fight back.

1328
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:15,289
Emma's in there waiting.

1329
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:30,721
Come on, two bites. Come on.

1330
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,767
Don't make me break out the yogurt.

1331
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:43,233
- One more.
- Have you talked to your brother yet?

1332
01:37:47,154 --> 01:37:48,155
Mmm.

1333
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,451
I remember that about you.

1334
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:57,122
You don't talk to the people
you love most in the world.

1335
01:38:04,338 --> 01:38:08,634
You want me to get better, and I'm not
getting better and I feel so fucking guilty.

1336
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:25,484
You have a lunch meeting
with Bill Blass on Friday. Fancy.

1337
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:26,568
Mmm.

1338
01:38:28,404 --> 01:38:30,239
I'll call with my regrets.

1339
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:34,159
What are you doing?

1340
01:38:34,493 --> 01:38:36,370
I'm making a date with you
two months from now.

1341
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:40,833
I've been invited to speak
at Yale's Gay Week and we're going.

1342
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:43,627
Remember how I told you they had
those dances there now?

1343
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,003
You're my date.

1344
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:16,660
I want you to live so much.

1345
01:39:16,743 --> 01:39:19,621
- Don't say it.
- I'm not supposed to say that.

1346
01:39:25,752 --> 01:39:28,714
Please, God, give us one more year.

1347
01:39:32,885 --> 01:39:34,803
I promise I'll eat my spinach.

1348
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:05,667
I am taking care of more victims of
this disease than anyone in the world.

1349
01:40:06,126 --> 01:40:08,212
We have more frozen blood samples,

1350
01:40:08,295 --> 01:40:11,882
more data of every kind
and much more experience.

1351
01:40:15,344 --> 01:40:18,764
Dr. Brookner,
the government's position is this.

1352
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:22,768
There are $5 million
in the pipeline for which we have received

1353
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:25,687
over $55 million worth of requests.

1354
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:29,566
5 million doesn't seem quite right
for some 2,000 cases?

1355
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:34,321
The government spent 3 million
investigating seven deaths from Tylenol.

1356
01:40:34,446 --> 01:40:35,697
We're entering the third year.

1357
01:40:35,948 --> 01:40:37,828
We voted to reject
your application for funding.

1358
01:40:39,493 --> 01:40:40,494
Oh.

1359
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,622
I'd like to hear your reasons.

1360
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:48,335
The direction of the research you're
suggesting is imprecise and unfocused.

1361
01:40:48,418 --> 01:40:49,419
Oh, it is, is it?

1362
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:53,340
You don't know what's
going on any more than I do.

1363
01:40:53,423 --> 01:40:56,677
Could you tell me precisely
why you're blocking my efforts?

1364
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,555
Dr. Brookner,
there are now other investigators.

1365
01:40:59,638 --> 01:41:02,641
This is no longer only your disease,
though you seem to think it is.

1366
01:41:02,724 --> 01:41:04,309
Oh, I do, do I?

1367
01:41:04,393 --> 01:41:07,396
And you're here to take it away from me,
is that it?

1368
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:10,190
Well, I'll let you in on a little
secret, Doctor. You can have it.

1369
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:11,316
I didn't want it in the first place.

1370
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:13,944
You think it's a privilege
to watch young men die?

1371
01:41:14,027 --> 01:41:15,571
What am I arguing with you for?

1372
01:41:15,654 --> 01:41:18,073
You do not know enough
to study boiled water.

1373
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:20,242
How dare you come down here and judge me?

1374
01:41:20,325 --> 01:41:23,537
We only serve on this peer review
panel at the behest of Dr. Murray.

1375
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:27,082
Another idiot, and, by the way,
a closeted homosexual

1376
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:30,669
doing everything in his power
to sweep this under the rug.

1377
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:34,047
And I vowed I'd never say anything
like that in public.

1378
01:41:34,923 --> 01:41:37,593
How does it always
happen that all of the idiots

1379
01:41:37,676 --> 01:41:39,011
are always on your team?

1380
01:41:39,094 --> 01:41:45,434
How can you refuse to fund my research
or not invite me to participate in yours?

1381
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:51,273
Your National Institutes of Health received
my first request for money two years ago.

1382
01:41:51,356 --> 01:41:54,610
It took you one year
just to print up application forms.

1383
01:41:54,693 --> 01:41:58,780
It's taken you three years from my first
reported case just to show up here for a look,

1384
01:41:58,864 --> 01:42:02,743
and the paltry amount of
money you are forcing us to beg for

1385
01:42:02,826 --> 01:42:07,456
out of the $4 billion
you now receive each and every year

1386
01:42:07,539 --> 01:42:11,168
to protect the health
of the American people

1387
01:42:11,376 --> 01:42:14,421
won't come to anyone
before only God knows when.

1388
01:42:14,588 --> 01:42:17,007
A promising virus has been discovered
in France.

1389
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:19,009
Why do you refuse to cooperate
with the French?

1390
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:22,596
Why are we
told not to cooperate with the French

1391
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:24,806
just so you can steal a Nobel Prize

1392
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:28,935
while something is being passed around
that causes death?

1393
01:42:31,021 --> 01:42:32,564
Women have been discovered
to have it in Africa

1394
01:42:32,648 --> 01:42:35,442
where it is clearly
transmitted heterosexually.

1395
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:39,071
It is only a question of time.
We could all be dead

1396
01:42:39,154 --> 01:42:41,573
before you do anything. You want my data?

1397
01:42:41,657 --> 01:42:44,368
You want my ideas? You want my pages?
Take 'em!

1398
01:42:44,451 --> 01:42:46,578
Just do something with them!

1399
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:55,837
You're fucking right.
I am imprecise and unfocused,

1400
01:42:55,921 --> 01:42:57,839
and you are all idiots!

1401
01:43:12,396 --> 01:43:14,156
Did you organize
that picketing of the Mayor?

1402
01:43:14,231 --> 01:43:15,190
Yes.

1403
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:17,693
- And the signs?
- Yes.

1404
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:22,364
And your next play is about a first lady
who gave the best blowjobs in Hollywood?

1405
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:24,991
- Yes.
- This place is perfect for a new office.

1406
01:43:25,075 --> 01:43:26,159
Yes.

1407
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:37,421
Tidy.

1408
01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:40,340
Here.

1409
01:43:42,008 --> 01:43:43,802
- Oh.
- I got him. I got it.

1410
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:45,512
Come on. Let's get you back to bed.

1411
01:43:45,595 --> 01:43:46,722
Okay.

1412
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:50,183
There you go.

1413
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:53,395
Estelle made you some stuffed cabbage
for later.

1414
01:43:53,478 --> 01:43:54,604
Ooh.

1415
01:43:56,982 --> 01:43:59,025
There's this new drug in Paris.

1416
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:02,529
Kessler's lover's flying out to get it.

1417
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:06,032
Here it is.

1418
01:44:06,116 --> 01:44:07,909
HPA-23.

1419
01:44:10,662 --> 01:44:11,705
Ned...

1420
01:44:15,459 --> 01:44:16,543
He looks awful.

1421
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:20,159
Do you think this is anything or is this
just another shit drug like all the rest?

1422
01:44:25,177 --> 01:44:28,513
I think you need to prepare yourself
for letting go.

1423
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,685
You can't stop fighting
for the ones you love.

1424
01:44:34,394 --> 01:44:36,646
Haven't you ever had to
fight for somebody you love?

1425
01:44:46,823 --> 01:44:50,035
Tommy, you gotta start
putting yourself out there

1426
01:44:50,118 --> 01:44:52,704
in a way that everyone else
could see what I see.

1427
01:44:56,666 --> 01:45:00,212
- What kind of a fucked
up love scene is this?

1428
01:45:10,931 --> 01:45:14,059
Yes? Yes, ma'am.

1429
01:45:15,894 --> 01:45:17,395
4:30 tomorrow?

1430
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:18,730
Yes, ma'am.

1431
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:22,400
The fucking White House.

1432
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:26,822
Fuck the Mayor.
I've just been invited to the White House!

1433
01:45:26,905 --> 01:45:27,989
They're gonna do something!

1434
01:45:33,078 --> 01:45:35,205
- Oh, just so I understand,

1435
01:45:35,288 --> 01:45:38,917
what exactly does your title mean
in terms of our plague?

1436
01:45:39,251 --> 01:45:40,252
Ah...

1437
01:45:40,335 --> 01:45:43,129
We prefer not to use negative terms.
It only scares people.

1438
01:45:43,338 --> 01:45:47,175
Well, there's 3,339 cases so far.

1439
01:45:47,259 --> 01:45:49,469
1,122 dead.

1440
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:53,181
It sounds like a plague to me.
I'm scared. Aren't you?

1441
01:45:53,265 --> 01:45:56,017
What does your title mean again?

1442
01:45:56,101 --> 01:46:00,230
I come up with ideas for the President about
what he ought to be doing and not doing.

1443
01:46:00,313 --> 01:46:03,525
Okay, good. Got it.
So, the money's there, right?

1444
01:46:03,608 --> 01:46:07,112
It just hasn't been spent.
So there's this new drug in France.

1445
01:46:07,696 --> 01:46:10,740
Why doesn't the NIH study it?
I mean, what I want, what we want,

1446
01:46:10,824 --> 01:46:15,412
what we desperately need is for somebody
to help us cut through all this red tape.

1447
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:17,497
I can assure you that not a week goes by

1448
01:46:17,581 --> 01:46:20,292
that I don't bring new information
and reports to the President.

1449
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:22,294
The progress that's been made
on this disease is unprecedented.

1450
01:46:22,377 --> 01:46:25,922
But it's contagious.
Can't you see that because it's contagious,

1451
01:46:26,006 --> 01:46:28,133
you have to work faster?

1452
01:46:30,969 --> 01:46:34,723
Do you really believe that anybody
in a serious public policy position

1453
01:46:34,806 --> 01:46:38,768
in their heart of hearts, or even in their
most closeted meeting says to each other,

1454
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,646
"Hey, guys, let's not get
too upset about this"?

1455
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:45,108
Yes. Your boss hasn't said
the word "AIDS" out loud.

1456
01:46:57,954 --> 01:47:00,332
Answer me this one question. Um...

1457
01:47:01,082 --> 01:47:05,420
This shit, can hookers get it or, you know,
someone who had a one-night stand?

1458
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:07,505
- Of course!
- You can't prove that.

1459
01:47:07,589 --> 01:47:09,341
I mean, from what I understand,
from what I've read,

1460
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:12,969
female-to-male transmission through
normal vaginal intercourse

1461
01:47:13,053 --> 01:47:14,137
does not seem to be very efficient.

1462
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:17,474
That simply isn't true. It's a virus.
It doesn't discriminate.

1463
01:47:17,557 --> 01:47:21,770
Yes, but it's very difficult, isn't it?

1464
01:47:21,853 --> 01:47:26,691
It's almost impossible for a straight,
you know, regular

1465
01:47:26,775 --> 01:47:28,652
heterosexual guy to get it. Am I right?

1466
01:47:28,735 --> 01:47:31,154
- I'm sorry?
- There's no documented cases, am I right?

1467
01:47:31,237 --> 01:47:35,825
I mean, there's not a single
documented case of a heterosexual man

1468
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:39,621
getting it, not from fucking or a blowjob.

1469
01:47:39,704 --> 01:47:41,581
I don't have that information.

1470
01:47:47,921 --> 01:47:50,215
Great. That's what I thought.

1471
01:47:56,346 --> 01:48:00,934
Susan, call my meeting.
I'll be about 15 minutes late. Thanks.

1472
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:07,899
Thank you so much.

1473
01:48:07,983 --> 01:48:10,485
- Call me any time.
- Wait. Please, sir. Wait...

1474
01:48:18,243 --> 01:48:24,416
One hundred million predicted and
nobody is paying any attention!

1475
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:27,752
I need security on the second floor.

1476
01:48:57,615 --> 01:48:58,936
Why are you sitting on the floor?

1477
01:48:59,284 --> 01:49:02,162
I fell down trying to
get from there to here.

1478
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:09,335
Oh, don't touch me. God.

1479
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:15,383
I hate it when you look at me.

1480
01:49:19,471 --> 01:49:22,307
You hungry? I'm hungry. How about you?

1481
01:49:24,809 --> 01:49:26,186
I looked in all my date books.

1482
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:31,107
No one else I slept with is sick.
Maybe you're the carrier.

1483
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:40,658
We don't have to do this to each other.

1484
01:49:41,701 --> 01:49:43,369
You're gonna get better, Felix. You are.

1485
01:49:47,832 --> 01:49:48,958
- Emma says the NIH...
- Emma, oh, God.

1486
01:49:49,042 --> 01:49:51,419
Is finally starting research.
We have to hope.

1487
01:49:51,503 --> 01:49:52,712
- Oh, do we?
- Yes, we do.

1488
01:49:52,796 --> 01:49:55,882
Do we?
And how am I supposed to do that? Huh?

1489
01:50:02,097 --> 01:50:03,598
Stop eating that shit!

1490
01:50:05,141 --> 01:50:06,392
No!

1491
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:10,105
You know how important it is
to watch your nutrition!

1492
01:50:10,188 --> 01:50:12,315
I have a life expectancy
of 10 more minutes.

1493
01:50:12,398 --> 01:50:14,526
I'll eat what I want to eat.

1494
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:22,700
Ned...

1495
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:27,038
It's getting messier, okay?

1496
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:31,459
I don't want to make you see it.

1497
01:50:31,543 --> 01:50:34,423
Nobody can make me do anything.
You should know that better than anybody.

1498
01:50:34,462 --> 01:50:36,714
Now are you gonna sit there
on the floor for the rest of your life?

1499
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:38,133
- Do you hear me?
- Do you hear me?

1500
01:50:38,216 --> 01:50:40,009
No!
- No?

1501
01:50:40,093 --> 01:50:42,345
I've had over 40 treatments. No?

1502
01:50:43,388 --> 01:50:47,517
I've had three, no, four different
kinds of chemo. No!

1503
01:50:47,976 --> 01:50:49,727
I've had three different experimentals.

1504
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:53,565
Emma has spent more time on me than
anyone else, and it hasn't done a thing!

1505
01:50:55,859 --> 01:50:58,319
You cannot force the goddamn sun
to come out!

1506
01:50:58,403 --> 01:51:05,326
I am so sick of fighting and everybody's
stupidity and blindness and guilt trips.

1507
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:07,495
You know, if you can't
eat the food, don't eat the food.

1508
01:51:07,579 --> 01:51:09,789
I don't care. Take your poison.
I don't care!

1509
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:13,251
Fish is good for you!
Don't want any of that, do we?

1510
01:51:13,626 --> 01:51:14,878
No green salad!

1511
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,966
No broccoli! No vegetables!
No bread with seven grain!

1512
01:51:21,759 --> 01:51:23,199
Why would anyone ever want any milk?

1513
01:51:23,261 --> 01:51:26,139
- You might get some calcium in your bones!

1514
01:51:26,222 --> 01:51:29,601
Do you want to die, Felix? Die!

1515
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:59,631
- Please don't leave me, Felix.
- I'm sorry.

1516
01:52:07,347 --> 01:52:09,224
Keep out! Keep out! Keep out!

1517
01:52:09,307 --> 01:52:11,809
Keep out! Keep out! Keep out!

1518
01:52:11,893 --> 01:52:14,270
Keep out! Keep out!

1519
01:52:14,354 --> 01:52:16,689
Keep out! Keep out! Keep out!

1520
01:52:16,773 --> 01:52:20,777
Keep out! Keep out! Keep out!
Keep out! Keep out!

1521
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:23,821
Keep out! Keep out! Keep out!

1522
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:37,085
Assholes.

1523
01:52:37,335 --> 01:52:38,836
- Gay Men's Health Crisis.
- And the other reporter,

1524
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,001
and they're gonna be there?

1525
01:52:40,004 --> 01:52:40,964
Thrush is a fungus, yes.

1526
01:52:41,047 --> 01:52:42,423
Can you tell him that
we'll be picketing there?

1527
01:52:42,507 --> 01:52:44,676
And not afraid of arrest
or police brutality.

1528
01:52:44,759 --> 01:52:45,760
That's right.

1529
01:52:45,843 --> 01:52:49,430
The Mayor has four more hours before we
carry out our threats of civil disobedience

1530
01:52:49,514 --> 01:52:50,682
if he doesn't meet with us.

1531
01:52:50,848 --> 01:52:52,209
Tommy got the call yesterday, Ned.

1532
01:52:54,852 --> 01:52:56,187
Why didn't you tell me?

1533
01:52:57,355 --> 01:52:58,606
You see, it works!

1534
01:52:59,357 --> 01:53:02,360
- When? When?
- Only two can go to the meeting, Ned.

1535
01:53:04,195 --> 01:53:05,238
When?

1536
01:53:05,321 --> 01:53:07,490
- Tommy's executive director.
- I'm going.

1537
01:53:09,284 --> 01:53:12,328
- I polled the fucking board, Ned.
- I wrote that letter to the Mayor.

1538
01:53:12,412 --> 01:53:16,082
That meeting is mine. I am going to
go and represent this organization

1539
01:53:16,165 --> 01:53:18,876
that I've spent every minute
of my life fighting for

1540
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,379
and that was started in my living room,
or I quit.

1541
01:53:29,012 --> 01:53:30,054
You'd let me quit?

1542
01:53:39,939 --> 01:53:42,025
The board asked me to read this
out loud to you.

1543
01:53:42,108 --> 01:53:43,276
- Read what?
- A letter.

1544
01:53:51,075 --> 01:53:52,076
Go on. Read it.

1545
01:53:55,872 --> 01:54:00,084
"We are circulating this letter widely
among people of judgment and good sense.

1546
01:54:02,086 --> 01:54:05,340
"You are on a colossal ego trip
we must curtail.

1547
01:54:07,008 --> 01:54:11,179
"To manipulate fear, as you have done
repeatedly, is to us sheer barbarism.

1548
01:54:13,598 --> 01:54:16,934
"To exploit the deaths of gay men,
as you have done on television

1549
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:22,774
"and in publications all over America,
is to us an act of vandalism.

1550
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:29,947
"And after years of liberation,
you helped make sex dirty again for us,

1551
01:54:31,282 --> 01:54:33,910
"terrible and forbidden.

1552
01:54:34,952 --> 01:54:39,791
"We are more angry at you than
ever in our lives toward anyone.

1553
01:54:40,917 --> 01:54:43,503
"We think you want to lead us all.

1554
01:54:44,462 --> 01:54:48,341
"Well, we do not want you to lead us.

1555
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:58,684
"In accordance with our bylaws as drawn
out by Weeks, Frankel, Levinstein,

1556
01:54:59,936 --> 01:55:04,524
"Mr. Ned Weeks is hereby removed as
a director of Gay Men's Health Crisis.

1557
01:55:05,983 --> 01:55:08,236
"We beg that you leave us quietly

1558
01:55:09,987 --> 01:55:13,491
"and not destroy us
and what good work we manage

1559
01:55:14,409 --> 01:55:18,162
"despite your disapproval,
effective immediately."

1560
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:47,984
Ned, the executive director isn't on the board.
You know that. I don't have a vote.

1561
01:55:48,192 --> 01:55:49,944
And what could I have done?

1562
01:55:50,027 --> 01:55:52,196
- You didn't support me.
- That's not true.

1563
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:55,575
You're all nothing but undertakers. This
whole organization is a funeral parlor.

1564
01:55:55,658 --> 01:55:57,785
- Ned.
- All you do is take care of the dying.

1565
01:55:57,869 --> 01:55:59,710
Who's fighting so the
living can go on living?

1566
01:56:00,413 --> 01:56:02,248
Who's fighting for my Felix?

1567
01:56:02,331 --> 01:56:04,584
Tommy, we need you upstairs.

1568
01:56:10,882 --> 01:56:15,803
I belong to a culture that includes Marcel
Proust, Walt Whitman, Tennessee Williams,

1569
01:56:15,887 --> 01:56:19,390
Alexander the Great, so many
popes and cardinals you wouldn't believe.

1570
01:56:20,057 --> 01:56:23,186
Mr. Green Beret, did you know
that it was an openly gay Englishman

1571
01:56:23,269 --> 01:56:25,480
who was responsible for winning
World War ll?

1572
01:56:25,563 --> 01:56:28,691
His name's Alan Turing
and he cracked the German's Enigma code.

1573
01:56:29,108 --> 01:56:32,195
After the war was over, he committed
suicide 'cause he was so hounded

1574
01:56:32,278 --> 01:56:35,781
for being gay. Why didn't they
teach any of that in schools?

1575
01:56:36,782 --> 01:56:40,495
A gay man is responsible
for winning World War ll!

1576
01:56:42,413 --> 01:56:44,999
If they did, maybe he wouldn't have
killed himself and you wouldn't be so

1577
01:56:45,082 --> 01:56:46,626
terrified of who you are.

1578
01:56:50,922 --> 01:56:52,798
That's how I want to be remembered,

1579
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:55,411
as one of the men who won the war.

1580
01:57:00,097 --> 01:57:05,770
Bruce, I know that I'm an asshole.
But please don't shut me out.

1581
01:57:44,141 --> 01:57:45,184
Go.

1582
01:58:00,324 --> 01:58:02,285
Your brother and I are lovers.

1583
01:58:04,412 --> 01:58:06,330
I'm dying and I need to make a will.

1584
01:58:09,667 --> 01:58:11,335
- Please.
- Thank you.

1585
01:58:25,224 --> 01:58:27,935
I want to leave everything to Ned.

1586
01:58:31,272 --> 01:58:32,273
How's my brother?

1587
01:58:32,481 --> 01:58:35,318
Well, he blames himself for everything,

1588
01:58:35,401 --> 01:58:39,864
from my dying to the state
of the entire world.

1589
01:58:40,698 --> 01:58:43,200
All that plus you two still not talking.

1590
01:58:46,412 --> 01:58:48,372
You must be as stubborn as he is.

1591
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,752
I'll call him right away.

1592
01:58:52,835 --> 01:58:55,421
Do. He's at home packing.

1593
01:58:55,504 --> 01:58:58,215
We're going to Yale in a few days

1594
01:58:58,299 --> 01:59:00,468
for Gay Week.

1595
01:59:02,386 --> 01:59:03,888
He says he can't believe it.

1596
01:59:06,682 --> 01:59:09,185
He tried to kill himself there
when he was a freshman.

1597
01:59:14,899 --> 01:59:16,734
I haven't much, uh,

1598
01:59:18,903 --> 01:59:23,616
except for a beautiful piece of land
on the Cape in Wellfleet.

1599
01:59:25,576 --> 01:59:29,538
Ned doesn't know about it.
It was to have been a surprise

1600
01:59:30,247 --> 01:59:35,378
for when we'd live there together
or riding away happily ever after.

1601
01:59:36,921 --> 01:59:41,926
I also have an insurance policy
with The Times.

1602
01:59:42,009 --> 01:59:45,262
I'm a reporter for The New York Times.

1603
01:59:45,346 --> 01:59:47,139
It's meant to come to my next of kin.

1604
01:59:49,016 --> 01:59:50,726
I'm afraid they might not give it to him.

1605
01:59:50,810 --> 01:59:52,853
Well, if he's listed as a
beneficiary, they must.

1606
01:59:52,937 --> 01:59:55,272
You're smarter than that.
Don't be so naive.

1607
01:59:55,398 --> 01:59:58,442
I assure you, I will fight to
make sure that they do.

1608
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:04,323
I was hoping you'd say that.

1609
02:00:12,957 --> 02:00:14,166
Felix,

1610
02:00:16,752 --> 02:00:18,713
I wish we'd met sooner.

1611
02:01:14,685 --> 02:01:17,188
I should be
wearing something white.

1612
02:01:17,271 --> 02:01:19,023
You are, honey.

1613
02:01:20,357 --> 02:01:25,654
It should... It should be something
Perry Ellis ran up for me

1614
02:01:25,738 --> 02:01:26,739
personally.

1615
02:01:34,246 --> 02:01:35,289
Ned...

1616
02:01:41,295 --> 02:01:43,297
You find a way to fight again.

1617
02:01:45,883 --> 02:01:47,301
I Will.

1618
02:01:52,848 --> 02:01:57,019
Hey, hey, hey-Hey-

1619
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:08,781
Emma, Emma,

1620
02:02:09,031 --> 02:02:10,074
could we...

1621
02:02:10,658 --> 02:02:12,785
Could we start now, please?

1622
02:02:22,127 --> 02:02:26,507
We are gathered here in the sight
of God to join together these two men.

1623
02:02:28,175 --> 02:02:29,593
They love each other

1624
02:02:30,511 --> 02:02:36,433
very much and want to be married in the
presence of their family and friends.

1625
02:02:40,855 --> 02:02:45,526
I see no objection. Do you, Felix Turner,

1626
02:02:46,652 --> 02:02:47,945
take Ned Weeks...

1627
02:02:48,028 --> 02:02:50,781
Alexander. Yeah.

1628
02:02:53,993 --> 02:02:55,286
To be your...

1629
02:02:55,369 --> 02:02:59,248
My great true love.

1630
02:03:05,129 --> 02:03:07,590
- I do.
- Yeah?

1631
02:03:10,467 --> 02:03:13,637
I do. I do.

1632
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:21,145
I do. I do. I do. I do.

1633
02:03:50,382 --> 02:03:52,509
This is Tommy.

1634
02:04:00,017 --> 02:04:01,852
Thanks for letting me know.
