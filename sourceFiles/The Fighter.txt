1
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,856
- You bringing Micky in?
- Yeah, he's gonna come.

2
00:00:47,993 --> 00:00:49,722
He should be here as well.

3
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,692
You think he'll answer questions?

4
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,821
They said it was
gonna be both of us here.

5
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,901
- Am I looking right in the camera here?
- Just look at me, right here.

6
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:02,598
All right. You don't want me to look
in the camera with the...

7
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:04,504
- Right over here.
- ...interviews?

8
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,378
I started boxing
when I was 12 years old,

9
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:11,880
and I'd lie and say I was 18,
or whatever it was.

10
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:13,985
You know, I had a different
name and everything.

11
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:15,313
I mean, I don't know how many fights...

12
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:18,854
I'd done a hundred, more than that,
before I turned professional.

13
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,891
- Go ahead and sit right there.
- Why we doing this?

14
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:24,154
- I don't wanna do this.
- You want to start again?

15
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:27,993
This is my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.

16
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,033
I'm still his trainer.
You know, we got different styles.

17
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:34,195
I'm fuckin' squirrelly as fuck.
I'm like... I'm not even there.

18
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:35,806
You know, that's what Sugar Ray said.

19
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,341
I was the most tricky fighter
he'd ever come across.

20
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:41,769
In '78, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard.

21
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:44,177
I went toe-to-toe with him.
He couldn't get to me.

22
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:46,113
He couldn't get to me.

23
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,913
They called me the pride...
the pride of Lowell.

24
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:51,682
Everybody still talks about it,
especially my brother.

25
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:53,654
His whole life he wanted
to do what I did, you know?

26
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:56,625
But we're very different fighters.

27
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,490
Micky's, you know,
he's a heavy hitter.

28
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,894
He's got... a thunderous,

29
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:04,058
I'm telling you,
thunderous left punch.

30
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:06,534
Micky, he gets you
and he takes a punishment,

31
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:09,037
I don't know why he does it,
till you're right fuckin' in there.

32
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:11,233
He likes getting on the inside,
I stay on the outside.

33
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:42,203
Come on.

34
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,106
Dicky.

35
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:52,312
Would you come on?

36
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,283
Will you stop...?
You gotta help me finish this.

37
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:59,123
Come on!

38
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:01,122
- And predictable as ever.
- All right.

39
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:02,453
- You don't need to be Columbo
- Here you go.

40
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,858
to see where this fight is headed.

41
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:09,023
Bam! Over right hand
puts Micky Ward down!

42
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:12,500
HBO's making a movie
on me and my comeback!

43
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:18,269
And my brother is gonna beat
Saoul Mamby in Atlantic City next week!

44
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,176
The pride of Lowell is back!

45
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:26,114
Quacka!
Who wants some?!

46
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:28,344
Who wants some?!

47
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:50,941
Hey! I want a cut.

48
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:56,946
Are you good?
You guys having a good day?

49
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,913
How are ya?

50
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,619
Come on! What you got?
What you got going on?

51
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:08,590
Lou! Hey, Lou!

52
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,922
- How are you guys?
- Dicky.

53
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,597
Making my comeback.

54
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:20,697
Hey, naughty, naughty.
What's going on here?

55
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:26,341
Hey, Dicky, Micky!
Take my picture.

56
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:27,740
- Take a picture?
- Yeah.

57
00:04:36,988 --> 00:04:38,751
- Hey!
- Hey, Louie!

58
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,949
HBO's making a movie on me!

59
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:43,492
What's going on? Hey, beautiful.

60
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,463
Did you tap that?

61
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:54,197
I can't remember. I got CRS:
I Can't Remember Shit!

62
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,241
Hey, Jerry Garcia!

63
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,571
Are you nuts?

64
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:03,442
How'd you get here?
You drive around?

65
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,880
Hey, Ray. Ray. I love you, Ray.

66
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:08,747
You're doing well.

67
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,424
You're walking. Get on it.

68
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:36,346
- We make a mistake?
- Nah, I mean, he'll be here.

69
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:38,915
You know, like I said,
sometimes he goes on his own schedule

70
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,610
but when he gets here, we work hard.
You know, nobody pushes me harder.

71
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:44,950
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

72
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,820
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters? They'll talk your ear off.

73
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,051
You gotta pay them to shut up.

74
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:51,287
He can tell you
how Dicky was helping him.

75
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:53,659
Yeah, come on, Micky.

76
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:58,201
- O'Keefe!
- Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

77
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:00,327
You know where he is.

78
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:21,122
What's that Keystone Kop
doing in there? Where's Dicky? Girls?

79
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:23,227
- I don't know.
- Did you see him, your brother?

80
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,352
- Not this morning?
- Look at Ma!

81
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:28,557
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

82
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,225
- Wow!
- Get outta the ring, O'Keefe.

83
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:33,269
My Dicky should be doing that, huh?

84
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:35,668
Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.

85
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:38,605
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

86
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:41,439
Don't. Just forget about him.

87
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,979
He's number two man.
He's not part of this, all right?

88
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:45,878
- He's not being handled right.
- You get me coming in all right?

89
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:47,245
You want me to do that again?

90
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:49,910
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
Dicky's the trainer.

91
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:53,046
- I'm doing a favor, Alice.
- I will show you over here

92
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:56,490
these scrapbooks
I've been collecting for years.

93
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:59,324
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

94
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:01,022
Taught ya everything, didn't he, honey?

95
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:05,500
In '78, we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

96
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:07,696
Oh, my God, it was...
Have you seen that video?

97
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, you're from HBO.
You gotta see it again. Come on.

98
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,574
Art, Art, where's the video at?

99
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:21,584
Tonight, my son is gonna surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.

100
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:23,914
Believe me, I know it.

101
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:27,948
Sugar Ray might have
some trouble tonight.

102
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:31,391
That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,

103
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:34,794
a young man who can punch,
and I would like to say at this time

104
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,197
that physically
they're just about equal.

105
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:58,984
Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockdown.

106
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,088
This is unbelievable.

107
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:06,326
Eklund just walked over him!

108
00:08:06,464 --> 00:08:09,456
Nobody seems
to know what's happening!

109
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:18,506
Dicky did it.
Yeah. Tricky Dicky did it.

110
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,276
- Dicky did it.
- Weren't you supposed to be

111
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,438
training Micky right now?

112
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:28,109
- No, it ain't till 9:00.
- Dicky, it's fucking 11 :45!

113
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:30,778
- It's 11 :45, Dick.
- What?!

114
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:33,447
Where'd you fuckin'
park the car, Boo Boo?!

115
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:35,616
I didn't park it. You did.
I didn't park it.

116
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,159
Check your fuckin' pockets
for the keys.

117
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:39,695
- You got the keys, yeah?
- I didn't park it, man.

118
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:42,595
- Down there? I don't know.
- Check your pockets, all right?

119
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,531
- You're fuckin' mental.
- Fuck it!

120
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:46,762
I'll run. I need the fuckin' roadwork.

121
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:51,967
- Roadwork? Are you crazy?
- He's a great runner.

122
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:19,202
Hey.

123
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,395
Hey!

124
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,332
Quacka!

125
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:27,069
- Hey, Dicky.
- Better late than never.

126
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:30,203
Oh, look! Detective's on the scene.

127
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,781
Gonna get to the bottom of this.

128
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,016
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Dick, you're an asshole.

129
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:41,648
Hold it, hold it.
Let me get this straight.

130
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:45,229
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

131
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:48,196
Yeah. Yeah, they're both in my corner,
and this is what goes on.

132
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,630
OK.

133
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:51,564
Don't you have
a job to go to or something?

134
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:54,399
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

135
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,700
Yeah, Sergeant
O'Keefe's working overtime here.

136
00:09:56,841 --> 00:10:01,244
So we got Saoul Mamby,
Jewish, black, former world champ.

137
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,244
I think we got all the bases covered.

138
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:07,818
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

139
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:09,783
You know, he can't get used
to losing. It's a mental thing.

140
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:12,185
But we're gonna break
that with Mamby, right?

141
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:13,688
Yeah, I hope, if we can train...

142
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:16,453
We can train, right. Enough of you
wasting time, Mick. You know?

143
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:18,027
- Wasting time?
- Half the fuckin' day's gone!

144
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:20,153
- We got work to do.
- Yeah, half the day's gone,

145
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:21,856
- and I been waiting here for you.
- You wanna win?

146
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,337
Jab, two, three, four.
Left, right, punch right. Jab...

147
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:37,744
And again! One, two, three, four...

148
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:40,908
One, two, three, four, five...
Jab, jab...

149
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:44,119
There you go! There you go!

150
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:54,494
Come on, move!
Might as well drop the weight,

151
00:10:54,632 --> 00:10:56,224
we're gonna out-box Mamby.

152
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,527
- Take it out on the mitts.
- Head, body, head.

153
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,103
That's your fuckin' combo.
Head, body, head.

154
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,673
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

155
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:06,504
You know,
Sugar Ray's gonna be there,

156
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,272
calling the fight for ESPN.

157
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:12,679
I ain't seen him
since I knocked him down.

158
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,876
Like 14 years ago or somethin'. Right?

159
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,309
Hook!

160
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,548
Let's get
a real sparring going on here.

161
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,157
Don't wanna embarrass yourself.

162
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:23,419
Don't wanna embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, do you, Mick?

163
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,291
- You got him...
- Come on. Head, body, head!

164
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:27,557
Fuck.

165
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:31,334
- Fuckin' yeah. That's your punch, Mick.
- Oh, my God.

166
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:33,096
That's your punch.

167
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:35,933
That's your liver punch.
It shuts the whole fuckin' body down.

168
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:39,440
George's fingers are so fuckin' fat,
he can't even dial the phone!

169
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,578
Hey, right there, Tar!

170
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:45,147
That's not helping, George!

171
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:47,444
- Hold on. Wait a minute. I'm confused.
- What?

172
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:49,450
- Yeah, I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

173
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:52,055
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

174
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,957
- Dick Eklund Sr. is Dicky's...
- Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis's father.

175
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:58,322
- Is Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:02,263
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so is Cindy and Cathy,

177
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,460
- George is really their...
- And Micky...

178
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:07,594
- No. Micky and I are...
- Sherri Ward.

179
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:08,966
- We're Wards.
- The Wards.

180
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:13,202
It's not the way it sounds. Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

181
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:16,677
And then there was George,
just George. George is my man.

182
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:21,080
- Georgie's our poppa.
- After Dick, it was just George.

183
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:24,048
Charlene! Charlene!

184
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:28,482
Hey, Charlene!

185
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:31,424
- We're doing shots with Charlene!
- Yeah, you get over here.

186
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:34,725
- Come on! Come over here.
- Come on, drink yours.

187
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:38,525
On the count of three... Three!

188
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:44,436
Good job, fellas.
Oh, hey, one more time.

189
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:54,011
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

190
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,387
I told her all about you.

191
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:59,888
I don't wanna ask her
if she's gonna say no.

192
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,019
Can't beat that ass, can ya?

193
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:07,892
Get out of the booth.
Come on. Come on.

194
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:16,931
Are you just gonna stand there
and stare at my ass?

195
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:21,101
Your father stares at my ass,
but he talks to me.

196
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:23,338
Thinks you're the greatest.

197
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:25,915
- He didn't tell me you were mute.
- Keep the change, doll.

198
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,381
He told me you're
Kenny Fleming's sister.

199
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:29,213
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip.

200
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:30,945
You know what the bell
says about this tip?

201
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:33,750
Cheap bastard. Cheap fucker.

202
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,688
Comes in here every day,
gives me shitty tips.

203
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:38,386
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck you, too.

204
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,896
- Forget it, boys...
- You pave streets, right?

205
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,194
- Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.
- Oh, yeah,

206
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:45,825
I heard you were a stepping-stone.

207
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,272
- No, I'm no stepping-stone.
- You're the guy they use,

208
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:53,639
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

209
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:55,803
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

210
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:58,347
The next fight's gonna show who I am.

211
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:00,575
Yeah, and he's
gonna lose that one, too.

212
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:03,346
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

213
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:06,422
So move that sugar ass
and get my...

214
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:08,491
You be nice. OK?

215
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:10,287
Be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

216
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:13,124
Hey, don't hurt your hands.
We got a fight next week.

217
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:15,732
Besides, you wipe
your ass with that one.

218
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,800
Don't lean up, or I'm gonna hit you
in the cocksucker.

219
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:20,961
- He's gonna beat Saoul Mamby, say it!
- Yeah, he's gonna beat him!

220
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:24,199
Right? Right? Hey!

221
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:26,503
- Right.
- That's right!

222
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:28,202
I'm gonna take your drink, as well.
I'm taking his drink.

223
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:31,179
Hey, this guy's gonna be champion.
He's a great guy.

224
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:34,443
He's a great fighter. You can't
go wrong. Thanks for the drink.

225
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,053
Those cameras are makin'
a movie about him.

226
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,520
He knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO,

227
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,318
that's why they're following him
around with the camera.

228
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,188
And now they're making
a movie about his comeback.

229
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,955
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fightin'?

230
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:48,793
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

231
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:51,993
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

232
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:54,229
Where did they find a guy like that?

233
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,203
He's no joke. Former world champ.

234
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,672
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:00,743
- I match up good with him though.
- Yeah?

236
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:02,573
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

237
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:05,648
Well, I got lighter, you know?
I have a reputation for brawlin',

238
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,411
but I'm not gonna brawl with him.
I'm gonna try and out-box him.

239
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:10,179
- And there's a difference?
- Yeah, you know.

240
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,516
Brawlin', you slug it out.
I hit you, you hit me.

241
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:15,956
Boxing's a chess game, you know?
I pick my punches to take him down.

242
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:18,618
And go head, body, head, body.

243
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:22,657
- What is "head, body, head, body"?
- Well, I hit him in the head,

244
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,132
and then his hand's gonna go up
to protect himself,

245
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,203
so it opens up his body,
and then when I hit him in the body,

246
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:29,636
the hand goes back down,
I go back up to the head,

247
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,742
hand goes back up, hit him in the body.

248
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:34,367
People who don't know fighting
think you can do a lot of damage

249
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:38,346
hitting somebody in the head,
but you do more hitting 'em in the body.

250
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:41,076
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

251
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:45,350
Are you married?

252
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:47,354
No. Would I ask you out
if I was married?

253
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:49,618
- What kind of guy do you think I am?
- Happens all the time. Trust me.

254
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,421
I'm not like that.

255
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:54,531
I'm not married. I got a daughter.
I see her every other weekend.

256
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:57,031
Her name's Kasie. But that's it.

257
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:59,363
Come on. Let me take you out.

258
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:02,901
When?

259
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,372
Saturday night.
I get back from Atlantic City.

260
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:25,321
- Is this the real number?
- You have to call it and see.

261
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:28,864
I will. Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

262
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:53,217
- Hey. Jimmy.
- Micky, hey. How's it going?

263
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,518
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

264
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:59,527
What's he doin' here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

265
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:01,824
Look, I just want to say hi to Kasie.

266
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:03,524
It's not your day. Good-bye.

267
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,601
Yeah, but I'm not
around next weekend.

268
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:10,002
- You ditchin' the days you do have?
- No, I have a fight. I told you that.

269
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,803
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

270
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:18,073
I can't talk to her, OK?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

271
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,445
I want to talk to my daughter. Now.

272
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:23,018
- Talk to your father.
- Goddamn it, Jimmy.

273
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,054
Daddy's gonna fight Saoul Mamby.

274
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,054
That's right. I want
to tell you that after I win,

275
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm gonna start making good money,
and I'll move into a bigger apartment

276
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:32,524
like we talked about
so you can live with me more days, OK?

277
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:34,563
- Yeah, bigger apartment!
- Wish me luck, all right?

278
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:38,134
Don't hold your breath, Kasie.
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

279
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:39,736
Good luck, Daddy.

280
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,169
Thanks, Kasie.
I love you, honey. Bye, baby.

281
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:45,864
Where is he?

282
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,979
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.

283
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,315
- Quit worrying, for crying out loud.
- Blow that shit in my face.

284
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:03,718
You know, it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

285
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:06,728
and they have a saying,
"Let Go and Let God."

286
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:09,162
- You gotta let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

287
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,030
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

288
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:13,602
You're already doing it without him.

289
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:16,228
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

290
00:18:16,373 --> 00:18:19,365
Look, you know where he is.
Why don't you just go get him?

291
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,604
- Can you get him?
- I'm not fuckin' going to get him.

292
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:26,614
Are we all gonna go over there in
the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

293
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:36,759
Dicky.

294
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:41,457
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

295
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,530
Dicky, your mother's outside!
She's down there!

296
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,402
I'm not here.

297
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,301
- Oh, no.
- What?

298
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:56,970
- I gotta go check...
- Dicky, no!

299
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:59,014
Don't, Dicky! Dicky!

300
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:00,377
- He's goin'...
- Dicky...

301
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,144
- ...better get out of here.
- Dicky, no!

302
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:05,448
Quacka, what the fuck are you doing?

303
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,784
You know we gotta go to the airport
now. We got a flight to catch.

304
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:10,450
You know how important
this fight is to me.

305
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:12,653
Hey, don't tell Ma I'm here,
all right?

306
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:13,854
- She knows!
- No, no, no.

307
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:15,932
- Pick me up back at the house.
- Are you fucking...

308
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:18,125
- I'll go through the yards.
- She's in the driveway right now.

309
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:20,203
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fuckin' driveway.

310
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:22,032
- We got a flight to catch.
- You son of a bitch.

311
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:24,606
You do this on the day your
brother's traveling?!

312
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:27,335
What are you doing?

313
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,207
- Why'd you make me do that?
- What the fuck you hit him for?

314
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:30,643
Why'd you make me do that to you?

315
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:32,043
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky.

316
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:33,706
I was on my way! Ma...

317
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:37,048
- What are you doing in this place?
- There you go. There you go.

318
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:39,883
Why can't we just go to the fuckin'
airport for once, please?

319
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:42,788
- We got a plane to catch.
- Hey, Alice, what about your husband?

320
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,395
He's laying on the fuckin' ground.
You wanna help your husband?

321
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:48,259
What are you doing running in here
like a silverback fuckin' gorilla?

322
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,890
- We had to get him, for Chrissakes.
- Yeah, you got him all right.

323
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:52,468
You got him, pal.

324
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:13,919
You see Mamby?
You see how Mamby's arm comes up?

325
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:17,459
Leaves his side open, you just
light him up like a pinball machine.

326
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:21,030
He's gonna be pissin' blood.
No way you lose, Mick. No way.

327
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:22,689
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky boy.

328
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,200
Hey, listen, what? ESPN can't
get us better rooms than this?

329
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:28,032
I wouldn't worry about
the rooms right now, Dicky.

330
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,470
- We got bigger headaches.
- Like what?

331
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:34,407
- Doctor won't let Mamby fight.
- Why not?

332
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:36,672
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

333
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:37,906
Yeah.

334
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:39,379
Micky, we can still have a fight.

335
00:20:39,516 --> 00:20:42,314
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

336
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:43,647
Mike who, Mungin?
Who's that?

337
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:45,652
Guy from Philly?
Isn't he in prison?

338
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:48,587
He's been out a few months. I've
called everybody, checked everywhere.

339
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,853
He's the only guy I could find.

340
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:53,657
My last few fights were rough, Lou.
This one's supposed to be easier.

341
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:55,924
I mean, we've been fuckin'
preparing for Mamby.

342
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,761
Yeah, but this guy
just came off the couch.

343
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:01,166
He's been sittin' on his ass.
Could be an easy win for Mick.

344
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:04,497
Joey Ferrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

345
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:06,165
Micky knocked out Joey Ferrell.

346
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,437
Exactly.
And Mungin just got off the couch.

347
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:10,513
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

348
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:13,741
- How over?
- Maybe 162, 165.

349
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:18,014
One-sixty-five?
Micky dropped weight. He's 146.

350
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:21,716
Lou, we prepared for Mamby. All right?
We prepared for Mamby.

351
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:24,851
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

352
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:28,294
Roadwork, everything else.
This other guy, he hasn't done dick.

353
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:32,027
Don't forget, you don't fight,
nobody gets paid.

354
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:37,974
OK.

355
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,571
So, Lou... Come on, please.

356
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:46,683
Mick...
Joey Ferrell knocked him out.

357
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,250
Gonna be a hell of a fight, huh?

358
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:52,287
- I'm not doing this. 165 is big.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

359
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:55,415
- So what? He's a middleweight.
- He just got off the couch.

360
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,050
He's got 20 pounds on me, Dicky.

361
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:00,959
Joey Ferrell knocked him out,
you knocked out Joey Ferrell.

362
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,692
- You just said that.
- Yeah, right. You can't be scared.

363
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,994
- Scared?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,433
- Why don't you go fuckin' fight him?
- I'll go fuckin' fight him. He's fat.

365
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:09,664
Good. Snap out the teeth.
This is your big comeback, right?

366
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:13,208
- That's what Alice wants.
- You knocked out Joey Ferrell.

367
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:16,574
All right. I knocked out Joey Ferrell,
OK? But the guy is a middleweight.

368
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:19,773
I'm a welterweight. They didn't have
a fuckin' heavyweight to throw in there?

369
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,477
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

370
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,849
Oh, yeah, Alice. No problem.

371
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:27,320
You watch from the outside, pal.

372
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:32,725
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!

373
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:36,722
Holy shit.

374
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,165
Hey, hey, look.
That's Sugar Ray Leonard.

375
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:40,998
Hey, Ray. Ray, Ray, Ray.

376
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:43,766
- Hey, Ray! Sugar Ray! Over here!
- Dicky.

377
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,704
Come on, look at the size of that guy.

378
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,142
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

379
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,871
That guy's no welterweight.

380
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,778
All right, Mick. We'll have to run
the first few rounds, tire him out.

381
00:22:54,918 --> 00:22:56,317
He did not just get off
the fuckin' couch.

382
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:58,353
If he did,
I'm gonna buy a couch like that.

383
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:00,719
I don't care who that guy is...

384
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:03,156
Look at me.
You're Micky Ward.

385
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:05,488
You're Micky Ward.

386
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:11,665
Micky Ward, fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia.

387
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:14,236
Ward, thrown around
by a much bigger man!

388
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:17,340
- Punches, smashing Ward back!
- Jab!

389
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,274
Now it's big Mike...

390
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:22,674
Ward goes down! Ward goes down!

391
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:25,748
- Come on! Come on!
- ...four, five...

392
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:28,314
...six...

393
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,852
Micky Ward's a fuckin' bum!
Get rid of this dude!

394
00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:32,148
- Shut up!
- Motherfucker!

395
00:23:33,857 --> 00:23:36,052
Mungin didn't even
know he'd be fighting today.

396
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:37,990
Hey, you, back off!

397
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:42,687
Come on! No, no, no, Mick!

398
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:46,625
Ward, a respected fighter.

399
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,034
You hope this mismatch
doesn't hurt his confidence.

400
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:53,166
- You're a loser!
- You're a loser!

401
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:16,225
Ladies and gentlemen,

402
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:18,027
before we get started,
a lot of people have been asking

403
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,932
about the big night
of boxing on November 4.

404
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:23,369
Three world championship bouts...

405
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:26,442
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

406
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:31,278
- Hey!
- Dicky. How you doin', man?

407
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:33,645
- How are ya?
- All right, man.

408
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:37,345
He's 165 pounds.
ESPN screwed us. You know?

409
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:40,684
- The guy was huge.
- Hey. You know, I...

410
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:42,815
I knocked Ray down.

411
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,621
I look like shit,
but I knocked Ray down.

412
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:47,161
Hey, let me buy
you guys a drink. All right?

413
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:49,288
- Want a cold one?
- No, no, no.

414
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,799
I got to leave. I got a plane to catch.
Next time, right?

415
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:54,836
Hey, Ray, wait, wait. HBO's makin'
a movie on me. You know?

416
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:57,496
Can I call ya?

417
00:24:57,641 --> 00:25:01,338
I'm gonna get a fight, and I just like
ya to be there for old time's sakes.

418
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:04,140
- You commentate or something.
- What's the movie about?

419
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:06,511
My comeback. Right?

420
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,483
- Call me. Love you, brother.
- I'll call ya.

421
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,110
You don't be a stranger!

422
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:14,152
He's funny,
"What's the movie about?"

423
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:15,280
What's that?

424
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:17,916
You can do better. You're too
good a boxer, I've watched you.

425
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:20,086
- Are you going to the hospital?
- What is that?

426
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,030
- They said I need to get stitches.
- Mick, nobody's got heart like you.

427
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:27,102
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

428
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:29,603
- It's killing your chances.
- What's he talking to Mike Toma for?

429
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,265
- I don't know, Dick.
- I want to give you a real shot.

430
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:35,970
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

431
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:37,478
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

432
00:25:37,614 --> 00:25:40,845
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

433
00:25:40,984 --> 00:25:42,542
What about my brother?

434
00:25:42,686 --> 00:25:45,154
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

435
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:48,417
You owe it to yourself
to come to Vegas.

436
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,083
Come on, Mick,
what has Dicky done for you?

437
00:25:51,228 --> 00:25:53,992
He got you into fights, he lets
you get beat, like you did tonight.

438
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:57,794
You shouldn't have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds, think of it that way.

439
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:59,401
You should've given it up.

440
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:04,031
Sit down in the car there.
Come on, you.

441
00:26:04,174 --> 00:26:07,041
- Sit the hell down.
- A little more Scotch for Mama.

442
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:09,668
There you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back.

443
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:12,714
- Will ya, ya old broad ya?
- Oh, my God.

444
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:16,114
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray,
he's a beautiful man, isn't he?

445
00:26:16,253 --> 00:26:17,618
He didn't recognize me
straight away.

446
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:19,585
You seen the way
he was looking at me?

447
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,824
He's a good guy.
I like him, I like him.

448
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,988
I seen him on ringside, he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

449
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,065
He's all about family, that guy.
Loves to see a family stick together.

450
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,897
Mick, what'd Mike Toma
want with you last night?

451
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:36,267
- He wants to train me in Vegas.
- What?

452
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:38,601
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

453
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:43,304
You don't know him. He say anything
about me? Did he say I could come?

454
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:45,278
He didn't mention you.

455
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,914
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without your brother?

456
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:52,351
That guy just wants to use you
like a piece of toilet paper.

457
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:54,889
What are you gonna do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

458
00:26:55,025 --> 00:26:57,789
- I know, that's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

459
00:26:57,928 --> 00:27:00,726
Yeah, I told him. I said that I needed
to be with my family in Lowell.

460
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:03,128
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

461
00:27:03,266 --> 00:27:05,097
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're gonna call him, baby.

462
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:06,224
That's right.

463
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,429
You guys can spar a little, right?

464
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:10,631
Where are they?

465
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:12,605
- There's my champ!
- Daddy's home!

466
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:16,509
- Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
- Give him a big hug.

467
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:17,704
I love you!

468
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:19,776
Thank you.

469
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,941
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

470
00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:26,283
No? 'Cause it's killing me.
Come on.

471
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:27,651
Did Uncle Micky win the fight?

472
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,419
No, Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

473
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,087
Hey, Mick, you take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

474
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:36,597
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

475
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,860
I don't know, Ma. I don't
think I wanna do this no more.

476
00:27:39,002 --> 00:27:40,401
What don't you wanna do no more?

477
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:42,027
Just, I don't wanna do it anymore.

478
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:46,438
- What are you...?
- Hey, Mick, ESPN screwed us.

479
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:50,979
All right? They owe us. We'll get
another fight. You'll heal up.

480
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:53,514
- It's gonna be OK.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

481
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,618
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

482
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:57,481
Maybe they'll even
do Dicky's comeback fight.

483
00:27:57,621 --> 00:27:59,145
What do you think?

484
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:02,717
Oh, come on, cheer up. You take
a little soak when you get home,

485
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:05,054
have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight.

486
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:06,890
A much better fight.
I'm gonna talk to them.

487
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,464
- For Chrissakes, Alice.
- What?

488
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,191
He's been through the ringer.
Leave him alone, will ya?

489
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:12,323
What are you talking about?

490
00:28:12,469 --> 00:28:14,300
Let him get some time to himself.
He just got finished.

491
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:16,303
- What's your fuckin' problem?
- Come on.

492
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,567
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not gonna come in?

493
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:21,472
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

494
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:24,142
Come on, let's go inside.

495
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:26,579
No. He's gonna go rest.
He's all grumpy.

496
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:29,184
He's beat up,
he's a little embarrassed, I think.

497
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,082
Look at him.
Have you even seen him?

498
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:30,773
Who is it?

499
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:53,967
I saw the shade move.

500
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:55,867
Micky, the shade is still moving.

501
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:59,237
I saw you come to the window,
I know you're in there.

502
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:02,243
Least you can do is open up
this door and tell me to my face

503
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:04,574
why you didn't call me yesterday.

504
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:11,817
Why'd you stand me up last night?

505
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:16,221
I started to call. I was gonna call,
but... I just couldn't.

506
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,883
'Cause you lost the fight?

507
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,622
Maybe, yeah.
'Cause I lost the fight.

508
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:22,561
How'd you know my house, anyway?

509
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,496
I asked my brother.

510
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:27,469
Your thing's coming off.

511
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:29,504
I mean your other thing.

512
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:33,268
You got any tape?

513
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:44,214
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

514
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:47,755
I didn't get to fight
the black Jewish guy.

515
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:51,588
You didn't get to go
head, body, head?

516
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:55,630
Saoul Mamby got the flu. Guy who
took his place had 20 pounds on me.

517
00:30:55,765 --> 00:30:58,461
I never should've fought him.

518
00:30:58,602 --> 00:31:03,266
- Why did you?
- Nobody would've got paid.

519
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:06,170
Everybody said I could've beat him.

520
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,675
Who's everybody?

521
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:11,610
My mother, my brother.

522
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:17,311
So are you gonna take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

523
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:47,278
- Hey.
- Hey.

524
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:51,777
- You look great.
- Thank you.

525
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:53,752
Got a nice house, too.

526
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,949
It's an apartment building.
There's five of 'em in there.

527
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:57,787
One of my old roommates lives in one.

528
00:31:57,927 --> 00:31:59,326
Roommate?
What, were you in the Army?

529
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:01,589
- College.
- College. Wow.

530
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:04,359
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

531
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:07,402
Well, you seem to enjoy it.
You're very popular down there.

532
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:10,097
Yeah, popular.
I gotta get out of there.

533
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,800
If I don't drink while I'm working,
I'll fuckin' kill myself.

534
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:16,036
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

535
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:17,339
Full boat's a scholarship, right?

536
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,641
- Yeah.
- For what?

537
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:23,116
- I was a high jumper.
- High jumper? You gotta be kidding me.

538
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:26,552
Fuck you. I was good. I was
New England champ. I cleared 5' 8".

539
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,625
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

540
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,919
You?

541
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:48,306
What are we doing
in Richie Rich Lexington?

542
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:49,776
You come to this theater a lot?

543
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:51,881
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They got good movies here.

544
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:55,041
- Yeah, like what?
- Belli Epi-que.

545
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:58,916
I think it's Belle Epic.
It's "epic." Belle Epic.

546
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:02,183
Belle Epoque.
The New York Times loved it.

547
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,190
Well, I never heard of it.

548
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,420
Where'd you hear about it?
The New York Times?

549
00:33:06,563 --> 00:33:08,827
No, a guy from work.

550
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:10,796
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

551
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:12,231
Oh, cool.

552
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:30,315
Thank you.

553
00:33:39,662 --> 00:33:42,426
That's the movie you wanted to see?

554
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:44,863
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

555
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:48,402
Had to read the whole fuckin' movie.
Fuckin' subtitled.

556
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:51,771
And some guy from a road crew
recommended it to you?

557
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,739
A fuckin' subtitled movie?

558
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:56,978
What's going on?

559
00:33:57,113 --> 00:34:00,207
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

560
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,875
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

561
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:04,816
I... I like you.

562
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:08,753
I came here 'cause I don't
wanna show my face in Lowell.

563
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:11,326
I told everybody I was gonna win
that fight and get back on track.

564
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:14,055
I told my daughter I was gonna get
a bigger apartment so she can move in.

565
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:15,994
You don't think I wanted to call you?

566
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:21,434
I was embarrassed. I mean... I'm sick
of being a fuckin' disappointment. I...

567
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:28,676
You really think
your family's looking out for you?

568
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:33,878
Don't say that about my family.

569
00:34:34,017 --> 00:34:37,953
What else can I say
after what you told me?

570
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:40,112
I mean, look at your face.

571
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:42,922
Look at you.

572
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:10,710
Bullshit, Lou. I'm not gonna
stop callin' till you make this right

573
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:13,220
and give us a fight that's fair.

574
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:16,120
My boy could've got killed last time.

575
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:19,855
Yeah, like what?

576
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,065
Just don't tell me he just
got off the fuckin' couch.

577
00:35:28,204 --> 00:35:31,173
He's coming off a loss?

578
00:35:31,307 --> 00:35:34,071
Sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

579
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,371
We got a great opportunity here.

580
00:35:37,447 --> 00:35:38,846
We gotta go find Micky.

581
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:41,780
Nobody's seen him
for like three weeks.

582
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:44,081
Jesus.

583
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:47,712
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find,
now it's both of them?

584
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:49,916
Ma, I think he's
with that girl from the bar.

585
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:53,051
- What girl?
- It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.

586
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:55,164
That's who he's with.
That girl from the bar.

587
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:58,426
George was all fuckin' eager
for them to get together.

588
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:00,760
I heard she's into three-ways.

589
00:36:00,904 --> 00:36:03,737
- Yeah, with other girls.
- Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

590
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:05,636
MTV...
What are you talking about?

591
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:07,003
Wild.

592
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:10,203
She acts all fuckin' superior
'cause she went to college.

593
00:36:11,414 --> 00:36:14,042
You girls just go
find your brother, Micky.

594
00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:16,674
Tell him we've got important
business to discuss.

595
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,688
I've gotta go find Dicky.

596
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:30,259
Dicky!

597
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:22,041
Hey, Ma, there's nothing
in there. I just...

598
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:26,551
It was just some friends I was seeing,
you know?

599
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:29,348
Don't worry about it, Ma.

600
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,129
I was just helping 'em out, you know?

601
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:39,666
Hey, Alice...

602
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:42,768
Alice...

603
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:46,671
I started a joke

604
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:51,746
Which started the whole world cryin'

605
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:56,045
Oh, if only I'd seen

606
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:59,916
That the joke was on me

607
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:03,753
I started to cry

608
00:38:03,893 --> 00:38:09,229
Which started
the whole world laughin'

609
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:13,165
Oh, if only I'd seen

610
00:38:13,302 --> 00:38:16,635
That the joke was on me

611
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:20,470
I looked at the skies

612
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:26,480
Runnin'my hands over my eyes

613
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:32,282
And I fell out of bed

614
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:34,822
Hurting my head...

615
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:54,368
So you're Beaver
and you're Red Bear.

616
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,469
- Red Beard.
- She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

617
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:01,082
You're Red Dog. You're Beaver.

618
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:03,777
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

619
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,785
Be nice.

620
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:07,583
Don't use the nicknames.

621
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:11,390
I don't think
I'll fuckin' call 'em anything.

622
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:14,124
Speaking of family...

623
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,770
Hello.

624
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:32,441
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

625
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:35,474
I've heard a lot about you.

626
00:39:35,618 --> 00:39:37,586
Really? I've heard
a lot about you, too.

627
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,654
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

628
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:41,848
Can we just sit down
and talk about business?

629
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:47,092
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

630
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:50,055
Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.

631
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,728
Just like I told you. Joe Belinc.
Six weeks. The Foxwoods.

632
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:59,308
Kid's like, you know,
ten and eight, he's nothin'.

633
00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:00,739
You know? And they're
gonna pay us 20 grand.

634
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:03,539
- Seventeen-five, Dick.
- Seventeen-five.

635
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,671
Which is still... good money, Mick.

636
00:40:06,816 --> 00:40:08,477
Yeah.

637
00:40:10,987 --> 00:40:12,249
Yeah, that's good, Dick. I'm just,

638
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:14,913
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for me.

639
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:19,817
Like what?

640
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,498
What's best for you, sweetheart?

641
00:40:26,636 --> 00:40:28,763
Come on, Mick, I thought
you'd be more excited.

642
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:31,271
Why ain't you more excited?
It's a good fight, good money.

643
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:34,706
I got tough with Lou Gold.
Told him he owes us.

644
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:39,879
Yeah, I know, Ma. I don't want things
going the way they've been going.

645
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:43,918
Mick, that last fight,
it was unfair. That was unfair.

646
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:47,386
- And we ain't gonna repeat that. Right?
- No, not on your life.

647
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:50,955
No, but...
It's just you in the ring.

648
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:52,651
Yeah, I know it's me in the ring.

649
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:54,922
But I don't like the way things
have been going here.

650
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:57,362
- Where?
- Here. This. Us. Lowell.

651
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,365
The whole routine.

652
00:40:59,502 --> 00:41:01,732
- George, stay out of it.
- You're doing all the talking.

653
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:03,270
Let him talk. Listen.

654
00:41:03,406 --> 00:41:06,239
- I'm askin' him.
- You're tellin' him.

655
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,774
- Listen.
- Stay out of it.

656
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,707
Don't tell me to stay out of it.

657
00:41:10,112 --> 00:41:12,103
Mick, what's the problem?

658
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:15,981
- The problems.
- What problems?

659
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:19,383
- Problems...
- Like what?

660
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:23,652
Like, maybe you not
showing up on time to train.

661
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:27,024
Like maybe him having to come
find you in a crack house

662
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:29,825
when you're supposed
to be at the airport.

663
00:41:32,335 --> 00:41:35,827
I'm sorry. I don't know who
you are, or why you're talking.

664
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:39,533
I'm Charlene. We just met.

665
00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:42,610
We're together. Do we need
to do this again? Hi, I'm Charlene.

666
00:41:42,745 --> 00:41:45,179
Hi, I'm Charlene.

667
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:46,637
Hi, I'm Charlene.

668
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:49,478
Hey, we're together!

669
00:41:50,486 --> 00:41:54,616
What are you gonna do, Mick? Listen
to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

670
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:56,622
What's she know about boxing?

671
00:41:56,759 --> 00:42:01,753
I know that going to Vegas
and gettin' paid to train year-round

672
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:04,388
sounds a hell of a lot better
than what you got him doing here.

673
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:10,163
You gonna let her talk
like that to your mother?

674
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:11,773
Come on, Micky.

675
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:15,468
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

676
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,810
I have done everything...
everything I could for you, Micky.

677
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:25,409
- This MTV girl comes along...
- Stop calling me an MTV girl,

678
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:26,851
whatever the fuck that means.

679
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:28,388
- Skank.
- It's wild.

680
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:35,060
I've been doing this over 15 years.
She comes in, disrespects me.

681
00:42:35,197 --> 00:42:37,859
She don't mean no disrespect, OK?

682
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,232
I had a chance to get paid to train
year-round, year-round, OK?

683
00:42:42,371 --> 00:42:43,633
That's all she's talking about.

684
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:45,741
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

685
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,971
I know what you're talking about.
All right? I could've had that.

686
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:55,709
You know? I had... I had opportunities,
like maybe you're gonna have.

687
00:42:55,851 --> 00:43:01,346
Now... You want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

688
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,355
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

689
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:05,483
- You? How?
- Yeah, I'll do it. Trust me.

690
00:43:05,628 --> 00:43:09,394
Hey, trust me. All right? Done.

691
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:15,428
All right? Charlene? Yeah? Everyone?

692
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:23,437
So, you put in $200, right?

693
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,275
Then you get ten other people
to put in 200...

694
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:29,711
...and you got your 2,000.

695
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:39,092
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody, just ten of you.

696
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:40,786
Ten lucky ones.

697
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,389
You rip us off.

698
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:47,126
No, no, I'm giving you an opportunity.

699
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:49,362
You give me $200.

700
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:53,498
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

701
00:43:53,642 --> 00:43:56,270
Right? You understand? No?

702
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,751
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

703
00:44:04,954 --> 00:44:09,050
I love Cambodian people.
I mean, look at Karen.

704
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:12,257
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

705
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:15,091
You know, and Brian.
We work on a road crew together.

706
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,758
- Well, not so much lately.
- We work on a road crew together.

707
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:21,233
You haven't been showing up,
that's all I'm saying.

708
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,066
This ain't an anti-Cambodian thing.

709
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:26,174
White people do this
to other white people.

710
00:44:26,308 --> 00:44:29,209
- It's what makes the world go round.
- Boo Boo, I don't think that's helping.

711
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:33,042
I mean, this is...
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

712
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:39,982
I mean, they didn't understand.

713
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:42,249
You know, I mean,
they're practically my gang.

714
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:45,792
Usually, they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand

715
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:48,226
the opportunity, you know,
I was offering them.

716
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:50,798
- What were we talking about?
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.

717
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:53,868
Right, right, right. I mean,
Sugar Ray was too much too soon.

718
00:44:54,003 --> 00:44:57,495
You know, I needed to build up slow.
You know, right?

719
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,699
What's this movie about, again?

720
00:44:59,842 --> 00:45:02,402
I told you,
it's about crack addiction.

721
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:06,413
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

722
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:10,646
Fuck.

723
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:14,947
We gotta get Mick's money.

724
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:29,829
Yes! That was awesome!

725
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:55,889
Go. Right now.

726
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:01,829
Go, go, go...

727
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,984
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

728
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,781
Get out of the car, now!
Move!

729
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:22,322
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof!

730
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:24,050
- That's it! Empty your pockets!
- Are you a cop?

731
00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:28,220
Go to the fuckin' sidewalk. Move!
Fuckin' move! Don't turn around!

732
00:46:28,364 --> 00:46:31,060
Don't turn around!
Gonna have to take your vehicle.

733
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,691
- How am I gonna get home?
- That's your problem!

734
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:37,105
Get us some rocks.
How much we got here? Count it.

735
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,037
What the fuck?!

736
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:44,873
That's the guy! He did it to me
and he's doing it again!

737
00:46:45,014 --> 00:46:48,745
- Dicky, get on the ground, right now!
- Get that fucking...!

738
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:22,813
Ta-da! What do you think?

739
00:47:24,286 --> 00:47:27,687
Open the door!
Trying to get off the fuckin' street!

740
00:47:27,823 --> 00:47:31,782
What the fuck! I'm trying
to get off the fuckin' street!

741
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:33,986
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

742
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:38,925
Did you hear me?!

743
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,970
You gotta see this!
They're fuckin' up Dicky Eklund!

744
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:52,573
It's Dicky! It's Dicky Eklund.
The cops are all over him.

745
00:47:52,715 --> 00:47:55,309
They're fuckin' punching him,
they're beatin' him. He needs help!

746
00:47:57,586 --> 00:48:00,282
Stay here! Don't get up. Stay here!

747
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:02,287
- Listen to him. You stay right here.
- I gotta go.

748
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:05,791
You better get back here.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

749
00:48:13,535 --> 00:48:15,332
Hey, what the fuck? Come on,
just put him in the car!

750
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:18,031
You don't need to do that!
Just put him in the car!

751
00:48:18,173 --> 00:48:20,403
- Come on, just let him go!
- You wanna get involved?

752
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:22,840
Now you're involved!

753
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:26,414
You're fuckin' up my brother!
I'll kill you!

754
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:28,539
He's a fighter! Break his fuckin' hands!

755
00:48:30,352 --> 00:48:33,810
- Don't!
- I didn't do nothing!

756
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:36,288
- I didn't do nothing!
- Shut the fuck up.

757
00:48:40,562 --> 00:48:42,154
Move 'em out!

758
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:46,266
Micky, your hand. Your hand.

759
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:48,463
Don't tell me to come on.

760
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:50,401
Back up yourself, for Chrissake.

761
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:52,939
Hey, separate cars, separate cells.

762
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:56,135
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

763
00:48:56,278 --> 00:48:58,439
Come on, folks,
time to go home. Let's go.

764
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:01,743
- No blankets.
- Dicky!

765
00:49:01,884 --> 00:49:03,044
What the fuck, man!

766
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:05,983
- Micky!
- Jesus Christ.

767
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:08,021
Don't get involved.
You shouldn't get involved, sir.

768
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:09,590
Look at his hands.

769
00:49:09,725 --> 00:49:10,919
Shit.

770
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:17,358
Go home, folks. Good night!

771
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:40,781
Welcome back, Dicky.
That's 27 arrests.

772
00:49:49,064 --> 00:49:52,033

Bail set at $25,000.
Case continued, two weeks from today.

778
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:16,053
- Come on.
- Judy, can I have the file three-57?

779
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:19,285
I need a copy
of the discovery reports as well.

780
00:50:23,198 --> 00:50:25,098
Mick, you're gonna say it
was self-defense, right?

781
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:26,394
- You did it to yourself, Dicky.
- What?

782
00:50:26,535 --> 00:50:27,797
You're gonna say it was
self-defense, right?

783
00:50:27,936 --> 00:50:30,700
You came outside, you seen them
beatin' on me, I didn't do nothin'.

784
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,740
Right? I was just waitin' outside like
anybody? Mick, I was doing it for you!

785
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:35,343
You did it for me? What, this?

786
00:50:35,477 --> 00:50:38,071
Do me a favor, don't do fuckin'
nothing for me no more, OK?

787
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:39,976
I'm fuckin' done lyin' for you.

788
00:50:40,115 --> 00:50:42,208
What are you
gonna do without me?

789
00:50:43,285 --> 00:50:45,719
This isn't how it was meant to go down!

790
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:47,754
They should've just put me in the car!

791
00:50:48,657 --> 00:50:51,455
Oh, Mick, come on! Mick!

792
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,005
Dicky!
Hey, what's up, Dicky?!

793
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:11,644
Hey, Eklund!

794
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,372
Dicky!

795
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,345
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

796
00:51:16,485 --> 00:51:19,386
Dicky, Dicky, Dicky...

797
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:03,730
Who is it?

798
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:12,265
I don't want to see you, Micky.

799
00:52:12,407 --> 00:52:15,774
- Charlene...
- I can't take it.

800
00:52:15,911 --> 00:52:18,846
I'm not gonna let you
or your family drag me down.

801
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:21,541
I'm quitting, Charlene, OK?
I'm done fightin'.

802
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:23,674
I don't need it anymore.

803
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,618
- That's fuckin' stupid.
- What? Why?

804
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:30,122
Because it's sad that you
let them take it away from you

805
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:32,159
with their stupid bullshit.

806
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:36,458
What else can I do, Charlene?

807
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:38,156
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

808
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,063
There's this guy that
your dad wants you to meet.

809
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:43,000
You just don't think you
can do it without Dicky.

810
00:52:43,138 --> 00:52:45,504
Charlene...

811
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:47,006
Don't call.

812
00:52:47,142 --> 00:52:49,167
Come on.

813
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:50,938
Don't call me, OK?

814
00:53:00,255 --> 00:53:02,621
Hey, Dicky, you hurtin', man?

815
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:06,284
Poor fucker!

816
00:53:09,464 --> 00:53:11,022
Hang in there, man!

817
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:12,895
Go, Dicky!

818
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:21,201
Hey, Dicky!

819
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,542
Hey, keep it quiet!

820
00:53:40,796 --> 00:53:43,230
Hey, Micky!
Bring another bucket, huh?

821
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,562
Good.

822
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:59,945
And this Friday,
an HBO original documentary.

823
00:54:00,082 --> 00:54:03,051
Right here in Lowell, Mass,
the story of Dick Eklund,

824
00:54:03,185 --> 00:54:05,278
a once-promising boxer
who turned criminal...

825
00:54:20,068 --> 00:54:21,592
Oh, look who it is.

826
00:54:25,273 --> 00:54:26,638
That's him.
That's Dicky's brother.

827
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:28,037
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

828
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:33,042
Hey.

829
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:36,473
- Hey, what's up, Mick?
- Look who's here.

830
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,786
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

831
00:54:40,922 --> 00:54:43,049
How you feeling? How's the hand?

832
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:46,558
- It's gettin' there.
- Looks better.

833
00:54:46,695 --> 00:54:50,358
Why don't you come down to the gym?
And work out. If you want.

834
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:53,696
- Hey, you fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

835
00:54:53,835 --> 00:54:55,894
Been roofin' with my father,
spending time with Kasie.

836
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:57,903
Now I gotta worry about
this movie on HBO tonight.

837
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,530
What are yous looking at?

838
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:03,504
Movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

839
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,374
I gotta go.

840
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:08,176
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick!

841
00:55:08,316 --> 00:55:11,342
Don't go watch
that crazy shit on TV, don't!

842
00:55:16,892 --> 00:55:18,621
Hollywood!

843
00:55:19,661 --> 00:55:22,960
Get a look! Get a look, all right!

844
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:27,667
Going to Hollywood!
Going to Hollywood, yeah!

845
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:34,272
All right!

846
00:55:42,617 --> 00:55:44,175
All right, get this started!

847
00:55:57,332 --> 00:56:00,460
Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.

848
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:04,231
Industrial Revolution... Lowell.

849
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:08,565
I used to live over there.
This town got good memories, right?

850
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,678
- Check it out.
- Fuck, yeah.

851
00:56:10,812 --> 00:56:13,542
- This house here, this white house?
- Oh, yeah.

852
00:56:13,682 --> 00:56:16,242
White, big fat guy.
First time I got my crack, over here.

853
00:56:16,384 --> 00:56:18,511
Did you ever know that?
They smoke crack at the White House?

854
00:56:19,988 --> 00:56:21,979
White, black, Puerto Rican, everything.

855
00:56:22,124 --> 00:56:24,649
The first time I did crack, or whatever,
I was about 23

856
00:56:24,793 --> 00:56:26,522
and a friend of mine gave me
a gram, or whatever.

857
00:56:26,661 --> 00:56:28,629
Fuck, I wish that'd never happened.

858
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:32,255
Before that, I'd been doing
the Silver Mittens and stuff.

859
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,961
I was the only kid.
I'd be 12... I was shit-faced.

860
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,662
I'll tell ya how crack works.

861
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:43,834
When it enters your lungs...
When it enters your lungs...

862
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:47,710
- I wanna watch, Daddy.
- Oh, my God. No, sweetie.

863
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:51,012
- You go back upstairs.
- But I wanna watch Daddy on TV.

864
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:54,213
I know, baby. You can't watch
Daddy right now, all right?

865
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:56,881
You go back upstairs
and go to bed, OK?

866
00:56:57,025 --> 00:56:59,152
OK, yeah, there's my boys
right there. Check 'em out.

867
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:02,855
- What kind of snake's that? Python?
- Yeah, check it out, man.

868
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:05,296
- It's not gonna bite me or something?
- He's cool.

869
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:10,435
It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.

870
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:13,671
I never thought
I'd kiss a fuckin' snake.

871
00:57:13,808 --> 00:57:15,173
I always dreamed about it...

872
00:57:17,479 --> 00:57:19,947
Do a lot of shit
when you're high, right?

873
00:57:22,617 --> 00:57:25,017
Dicky... put Lowell on the map.

874
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:27,713
He knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down.

875
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:32,691
Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockdown.

876
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:35,523
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.

877
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:38,030
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.

878
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,430
- Oh... and you're from Lowell.
- Yeah, come on.

879
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:44,027
- That's a fuckin' lie!
- They said he's in trouble with drugs.

880
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:46,936
What is this? Are you talking
shit about the family?

881
00:57:47,075 --> 00:57:50,272
- Oh, no, no, no...
- I heard you say "Dicky, Micky..."

882
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:52,471
We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.

883
00:57:52,614 --> 00:57:54,013
I thought he could make a comeback

884
00:57:54,149 --> 00:57:56,982
- and make us proud, but he didn't.
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.

885
00:57:57,118 --> 00:57:59,245
Very disappointing,
very disgusting.

886
00:57:59,387 --> 00:58:02,618
You brought the city of
Lowell back 30 years. We're not happy.

887
00:58:02,757 --> 00:58:04,554
- Hello?
- Jimmy?

888
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:07,321
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

889
00:58:07,462 --> 00:58:10,056
Actually, we're watching it right now,
Mick, but don't worry about it.

890
00:58:10,198 --> 00:58:11,893
I got it...

891
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:15,161
I want her to see it.
Let her see who her uncle is.

892
00:58:15,303 --> 00:58:16,702
- What?
- Who you are.

893
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:18,965
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

894
00:58:19,107 --> 00:58:22,372
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.

895
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,910
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it.

896
00:58:25,046 --> 00:58:26,445
She's a kid.

897
00:58:26,982 --> 00:58:30,509
When you smoke crack, you know...

898
00:58:30,652 --> 00:58:32,847
...you feel so much lighter.

899
00:58:32,988 --> 00:58:36,219
You know, you feel young, like when
everything was in front of you,

900
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:38,690
everything was just...

901
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,894
...everything was... just...

902
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:44,896
...it was in front of you, you know?

903
00:58:46,334 --> 00:58:48,700
And then...

904
00:58:48,837 --> 00:58:51,499
...it fades and you
gotta get high again.

905
00:58:56,811 --> 00:59:00,508
Your part in the movie
is gonna end with you going to jail.

906
00:59:02,284 --> 00:59:06,414
What about little Dicky?
Who's gonna take care of him, huh?

907
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:12,159
You guys can't talk to 'em?

908
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:15,261
Oh, man...

909
00:59:15,397 --> 00:59:17,957
Turn this shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

910
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:20,090
Turn it off. Will you turn this off?

911
00:59:20,235 --> 00:59:22,726
If you don't...
I'm turning it fuckin' off.

912
00:59:26,007 --> 00:59:27,702
Hey, hey, that is my life.

913
00:59:27,842 --> 00:59:29,434
- My movie night!
- That's my fuckin' life out there.

914
00:59:29,577 --> 00:59:32,444
- I wanna watch this. I don't care.
- I will fuck you up!

915
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,174
You fuckin' want some?
Don't fuckin' try me.

916
00:59:35,317 --> 00:59:37,911
I still fuckin' got it, OK?

917
00:59:38,053 --> 00:59:39,816
You fuckin' want some?!

918
00:59:39,954 --> 00:59:42,616
That's my son there,
and you're laughin' at him?!

919
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:49,060
That's my son. He's crying. He needs me.
And I'm fuckin' stuck in here?

920
00:59:49,197 --> 00:59:52,223
But you know what?
Dicky was a street kid.

921
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:56,565
Micky, you watching this?
What are they doing to us?

922
00:59:58,273 --> 01:00:01,640
Ma, I don't know what to tell you.

923
01:00:01,776 --> 01:00:03,710
You're pretending like you
don't know what's going on.

924
01:00:03,845 --> 01:00:05,779
He's been doing this for years.

925
01:00:07,015 --> 01:00:10,041
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Ma, but...

926
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:17,081
- What do you think?
- You think they set him up?

927
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:19,318
What do you think he was doing?

928
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:22,862
You know, gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie. Right?

929
01:00:26,201 --> 01:00:29,830
Micky... Micky?

930
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:32,400
Shit. Micky...

931
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:50,368
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

932
01:02:50,512 --> 01:02:52,742
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

933
01:02:52,881 --> 01:02:55,577
- What happened to the peanut?
- I don't know.

934
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:58,042
It's like a beach ball.

935
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:29,237
- Mick. Sal Lonano.
- Hey, Mick, how you doing?

936
01:04:29,377 --> 01:04:30,935
You own a cab company,
you're a good businessman, right?

937
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,014
- Yeah, he's very organized.
- How's the hand?

938
01:04:34,148 --> 01:04:37,174
It's good. You know,
it's getting better. Stronger.

939
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:41,084
Yeah, you know, I made a few calls
already. I talked to Buddy Tags.

940
01:04:41,222 --> 01:04:44,953
Said he can set up something local,
something to start back with.

941
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:47,027
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it.

942
01:04:47,161 --> 01:04:49,026
You gotta get your confidence back.
That's all.

943
01:04:51,466 --> 01:04:55,732
Your dad wants Sal to manage ya,
and he wants me to train ya.

944
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:58,338
But I'll only do it on one condition.

945
01:05:00,341 --> 01:05:04,402
- No crazy-time nonsense.
- It's how it's gotta be.

946
01:05:04,545 --> 01:05:07,810
- No Dicky. No Alice.
- No Dicky. No Alice.

947
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:10,611
I get it, I get it.
I'm good, I understand.

948
01:05:10,752 --> 01:05:13,050
- Look, I appreciate the opportunity.
- I can't take the bullshit, Mick.

949
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:16,054
- No offense, Georgie.
- None taken.

950
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:19,455
I'm gonna be the one who gets
his balls cut off, anyway.

951
01:05:20,595 --> 01:05:23,223
- Yeah. You laugh.
- You...

952
01:05:23,364 --> 01:05:26,561
- ...fuckin' traitor!
- What are you doing?

953
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:31,638
What the hell's the matter with you?!
Come on! The pans hurt!

954
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:33,104
Do they hurt?! I hope it hurts!

955
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:35,573
- Sal Lonano is a good man!
- A good man?!

956
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:37,974
He's a legitimate businessman,
for Chrissakes!

957
01:05:38,112 --> 01:05:40,239
- Legitimate businessman?
- Yes. What?

958
01:05:40,381 --> 01:05:42,008
Oh, my God,
you know what that sounds like?

959
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,812
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxi cab company!

960
01:05:44,952 --> 01:05:47,318
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God. He's a cab driver.

961
01:05:47,455 --> 01:05:48,922
He knows everything
about boxing, right?

962
01:05:49,057 --> 01:05:53,221
I don't think so! He's gonna steal
your son's money and rob him blind!

963
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:55,886
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

964
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:58,590
- Why can't you trust anybody with...?
- I know people.

965
01:05:58,733 --> 01:06:01,361
I know, George, you think I don't
know anything, but I know people.

966
01:06:01,502 --> 01:06:03,470
- I know you know people.
- And that Sal Lonano

967
01:06:03,604 --> 01:06:07,267
banana fucking thing,
we don't need that in our lives!

968
01:06:07,408 --> 01:06:09,273
We haven't made one dollar
with these kids!

969
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:12,004
- You betrayed me!
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

970
01:06:12,146 --> 01:06:14,307
- You always react the same way.
- He's a fuckin' crook!

971
01:06:14,449 --> 01:06:17,145
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail!

972
01:06:17,285 --> 01:06:20,083
We're not talking about his trainer,
sweetheart!

973
01:06:20,221 --> 01:06:23,384
We're talking about his manager,
that's me!

974
01:06:23,524 --> 01:06:25,719
But, Mom, maybe Micky
should try something different!

975
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,851
What are you doing opening
your mouth in my kitchen?

976
01:06:27,995 --> 01:06:31,795
- You owe me $200.
- I said I was gonna pay you next week.

977
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:33,594
I don't want
another word outta you.

978
01:06:33,735 --> 01:06:35,327
That was last month
you told me two weeks.

979
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:38,735
You take sides against me in
my own house, you owe me money?

980
01:06:38,873 --> 01:06:40,500
And Ma's been great
to Micky, Sherri.

981
01:06:40,641 --> 01:06:43,610
Really, I mean, who's gonna look out
for Micky better than his own mother?

982
01:06:43,745 --> 01:06:46,543
It's that fuckin' girl, Charlene.
We gotta get rid of her.

983
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:49,616
Ma, we gotta get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She gotta go.

984
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:51,150
You're gonna get Charlene involved?

985
01:06:51,285 --> 01:06:54,846
- Is that what you're telling me?
- I know where she lives.

986
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:56,456
What are you pickin' on her for?

987
01:06:56,591 --> 01:06:59,492
She lives in that
yellow house on Stevens Street.

988
01:06:59,627 --> 01:07:02,118
I'm gonna go talk to Micky,
sort this out for myself.

989
01:07:02,263 --> 01:07:07,360
Yeah, sure. You go handle it
with your vigilantes. All of yous now.

990
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:08,594
This is wrong, Alice!

991
01:07:16,144 --> 01:07:17,475
I got it!

992
01:07:17,612 --> 01:07:19,409
Get outta my way! Get in the car!

993
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:21,912
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

994
01:07:22,683 --> 01:07:24,514
Get in the car.

995
01:07:47,775 --> 01:07:50,141
- Yeah, they're in there!
- Up there on the second floor.

996
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:51,768
Micky!

997
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,480
Where the hell are you?
You up there? Come on down!

998
01:07:56,617 --> 01:07:58,141
Where are you?

999
01:07:59,187 --> 01:08:02,156
Holy shit, Micky, your mother
and your sisters are here.

1000
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:05,316
No, don't.
Do not go out there. Please.

1001
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:09,054
No, I'm not hiding from
your crazy fuckin' family.

1002
01:08:20,608 --> 01:08:21,836
Hi.

1003
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:23,705
Well, well, well.
Look at this.

1004
01:08:23,845 --> 01:08:24,971
Look at what?

1005
01:08:25,947 --> 01:08:29,178
- Why you hiding from us, Micky?
- He's not hiding.

1006
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:31,842
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my son.

1007
01:08:31,986 --> 01:08:33,419
What are you doing, Mickster?

1008
01:08:33,554 --> 01:08:35,954
I'm right here.
I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

1009
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:39,753
You're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend Lonano.

1010
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:42,294
What are you gonna do,
turn your back on Dicky next?

1011
01:08:43,998 --> 01:08:46,694
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

1012
01:08:46,834 --> 01:08:49,394
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

1013
01:08:49,537 --> 01:08:51,937
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank.

1014
01:08:52,073 --> 01:08:55,668
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that nasty
hair right out of your fuckin' head.

1015
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:58,210
I'm his mother. And his manager.

1016
01:08:58,346 --> 01:09:00,644
You're not my manager anymore.
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, OK?

1017
01:09:00,781 --> 01:09:02,578
I'm not gettin' any younger.

1018
01:09:02,717 --> 01:09:04,651
Who's gonna look after you, sweetheart?

1019
01:09:04,785 --> 01:09:08,277
I mean, come on. I know you don't
understand it, but I had nine kids

1020
01:09:08,422 --> 01:09:11,823
- and I love every one of you the same.
- You got a funny way of showing it,

1021
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:13,824
letting him get beat up,
letting him get his hand broken.

1022
01:09:13,961 --> 01:09:16,725
- You're crazy.
- You fuckin' bar skank!

1023
01:09:16,864 --> 01:09:19,389
- What did I just say to you?
- Don't put your hands on her...

1024
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:26,639
- Get off of me!
- Stop it!

1025
01:09:28,743 --> 01:09:31,075
Let her go!
Let her go!

1026
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,173
- Fuck you, Charlene!
- Fuck you!

1027
01:09:35,316 --> 01:09:39,150
- Get the fuck outta here! Now!
- Fuck you, Charlene!

1028
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:41,187
- Skank!
- Micky...

1029
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:46,958
- Fuckin' bitch!
- Oh, my God! Gail!

1030
01:09:47,094 --> 01:09:49,187
What'd she do to your nose?

1031
01:09:56,837 --> 01:09:59,032
What is happenin'?
What is happenin' to everybody?

1032
01:09:59,173 --> 01:10:01,471
I don't understand, sweetheart.

1033
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:50,422
Why... Why do you think
I spell my name with an E?

1034
01:10:50,558 --> 01:10:52,025
'Cause I don't.

1035
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,457
- No-E Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push the button.

1036
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,824
- Where we going? What's with the ring?
- Ring's across the street.

1037
01:10:58,966 --> 01:11:00,991
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

1038
01:11:01,135 --> 01:11:03,695
Yeah, smaller venue.
They got no dressin' rooms over there.

1039
01:11:03,838 --> 01:11:07,831
- Yeah, but...
- Micky, It's just a start. Don't worry.

1040
01:11:10,211 --> 01:11:13,271
Hey. Good luck.

1041
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:26,558
That's it!

1042
01:11:29,563 --> 01:11:32,555
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1043
01:12:58,819 --> 01:13:00,946
Visit for Dick Eklund.

1044
01:13:01,088 --> 01:13:02,316
Dicky!

1045
01:13:02,456 --> 01:13:04,822
Eklund, you got a visitor!

1046
01:13:06,026 --> 01:13:10,122
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

1047
01:13:10,264 --> 01:13:12,164
I know you know what I been doing.

1048
01:13:12,299 --> 01:13:15,029
I'm sure Alice
and everybody else told you.

1049
01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:17,797
I just wanted to tell you
to your face myself.

1050
01:13:17,938 --> 01:13:21,374
I got new management.
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

1051
01:13:21,509 --> 01:13:23,500
It's all good.

1052
01:13:23,644 --> 01:13:26,943
Yeah. They got you fightin'
Alfonso Sanchez.

1053
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:28,673
- On HBO.
- And you're proud of that?

1054
01:13:28,816 --> 01:13:32,775
- Fuckin' right.
- HBO is invested in the Mexican.

1055
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,854
I didn't think they were gonna be
invested in me?

1056
01:13:36,023 --> 01:13:38,355
- I got a shot. I'm gonna take it.
- Wake up.

1057
01:13:38,492 --> 01:13:40,585
They don't care if he kills you.

1058
01:13:40,728 --> 01:13:45,256
Mike Toma did it. He's using you,
like a stepping-stone for Sanchez.

1059
01:13:47,334 --> 01:13:50,098
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

1060
01:13:50,237 --> 01:13:53,764
How could I stand a chance without the
great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

1061
01:13:53,908 --> 01:13:56,206
You didn't give a fuck
if I got killed by Mungin.

1062
01:13:56,343 --> 01:14:00,074
Now all of a sudden you're worried
Sanchez is gonna hurt me? Why?

1063
01:14:00,214 --> 01:14:03,183
'Cause you're stuck in here and can't
be the center of attention no more?

1064
01:14:03,317 --> 01:14:05,114
- You need it that bad?
- I've seen this Mexican fight.

1065
01:14:05,252 --> 01:14:08,050
He fights, hits,
like a fuckin' mule, all right?

1066
01:14:08,189 --> 01:14:10,487
Fifteen knockouts, undefeated.
You crazy?

1067
01:14:10,624 --> 01:14:13,115
And that taxi cab idiot,
Lonano, he went right for it.

1068
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,888
He's a paper gangster,
he's using you to steal money.

1069
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:19,397
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

1070
01:14:19,533 --> 01:14:22,798
I spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

1071
01:14:22,937 --> 01:14:24,666
I finally got a good thing going for me

1072
01:14:24,805 --> 01:14:27,535
and you can't be fuckin'
happy for me? Why?

1073
01:14:28,576 --> 01:14:30,806
What's your plan?
How you gonna fight Sanchez?

1074
01:14:30,945 --> 01:14:34,540
- I ain't here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1075
01:14:34,682 --> 01:14:37,242
- I am not here to talk about that.
- What's your plan?

1076
01:14:37,384 --> 01:14:39,375
Yes, you are.

1077
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,579
You watch the fight
and you'll see the plan.

1078
01:14:41,722 --> 01:14:44,953
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fuckin' violent. I mean...

1079
01:14:45,092 --> 01:14:46,525
Two minutes, Dicky.

1080
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:49,026
They'll let us watch a stupid
documentary about crack,

1081
01:14:49,163 --> 01:14:52,929
but I can't watch my own
brother fighting, you know?

1082
01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:56,867
Hey... Mick, what is it?

1083
01:14:57,004 --> 01:14:59,336
You scared? You embarrassed
because you don't even have a plan?

1084
01:14:59,473 --> 01:15:01,498
I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1085
01:15:01,642 --> 01:15:03,269
Are you gonna shit on it
no matter what I say?

1086
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,275
I'm not gonna shit on it. Just tell me.

1087
01:15:08,382 --> 01:15:10,509
Go toe-to-toe.
Overhand right in the middle rounds.

1088
01:15:10,651 --> 01:15:12,744
He's weak against the overhand right.

1089
01:15:13,954 --> 01:15:16,286
Who came up with that?
Fatty fuck O'Keefe?

1090
01:15:16,423 --> 01:15:17,447
Fuck you, Dicky.

1091
01:15:18,092 --> 01:15:20,754
You gotta run against this guy.
Let him punch himself out.

1092
01:15:20,894 --> 01:15:22,953
Take him to the body, right? Get inside.

1093
01:15:23,097 --> 01:15:25,861
Switch stances like you're gonna
work his right, hit him on the left.

1094
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,934
You ain't me. All right?
You can't be me.

1095
01:15:28,068 --> 01:15:29,695
- Careful. Switch outside...
- You had a hard enough time

1096
01:15:29,837 --> 01:15:31,532
being you when you had
your fuckin' chance,

1097
01:15:31,672 --> 01:15:35,130
and that's why you're in here.
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1098
01:15:35,276 --> 01:15:37,836
I'm talking about the way
you fight, you moron!

1099
01:15:39,246 --> 01:15:42,079
Yeah, you know I'm right!
He knows I'm right. All right.

1100
01:15:45,552 --> 01:15:46,985
He knows I'm right.

1101
01:15:50,524 --> 01:15:55,962
Ward's record: 29 wins,
seven losses so far, 20 KOs.

1102
01:15:56,096 --> 01:15:59,429
He's been a little better since
he refocused himself on the sport,

1103
01:15:59,566 --> 01:16:01,090
as JB pointed out.

1104
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,134
Now, here's Ward's opponent,
Alfonso Sanchez, out of Tijuana, Mexico.

1105
01:16:11,278 --> 01:16:16,409
You see the record: 16 wins,
15 KOs, eight first-round KOs.

1106
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:18,313
There's Mike Toma,
the promoter of the fight,

1107
01:16:18,452 --> 01:16:20,079
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

1108
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,847
And he says that Sanchez is

1109
01:16:21,989 --> 01:16:26,289
one of the most talented young
prospects in the sport of boxing.

1110
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:40,496
This is really one of
the saddest kinds of fights in boxing.

1111
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:43,337
- Get out of the corner!
- Micky Ward is 31 years old,

1112
01:16:43,477 --> 01:16:46,503
he's here because he needs the money,
he's taking a beating...

1113
01:16:46,647 --> 01:16:48,911
And my point is
that he doesn't really have to sit here

1114
01:16:49,049 --> 01:16:51,711
and take this beating.
He can do something about it.

1115
01:16:51,852 --> 01:16:53,945
Which is what?
Have his corner throw in the towel?

1116
01:16:54,088 --> 01:16:56,113
- Or fight back.
- Get back.

1117
01:16:58,492 --> 01:16:59,481
You can see his power.

1118
01:16:59,626 --> 01:17:01,685
Every time he hits Ward,
he backs him up.

1119
01:17:01,829 --> 01:17:03,763
How about taking points away from him?

1120
01:17:04,832 --> 01:17:06,732
Larry, unless
the referee does, you can't.

1121
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:08,391
The referee should just go
ahead and stop this fight.

1122
01:17:08,535 --> 01:17:12,062
He knows that Micky doesn't want
to be here. I wouldn't even make...

1123
01:17:12,206 --> 01:17:14,299
He's fightin' scared, Dick.

1124
01:17:14,441 --> 01:17:16,534
Runnin' away, not hittin' back.

1125
01:17:16,677 --> 01:17:20,306
Oh, Jesus. He's gonna get hurt.

1126
01:17:20,447 --> 01:17:22,438
Doing that same old shit.

1127
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,915
They never seen such
an embarrassing performance.

1128
01:17:25,052 --> 01:17:27,145
He's doing what I told him, Ma.
He's doing what I told him.

1129
01:17:27,287 --> 01:17:28,982
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1130
01:17:29,123 --> 01:17:31,990
Micky Ward, showing nothing
but respect.

1131
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:33,718
What are you runnin' around for?
Stop running around!

1132
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:36,921
Shut the fuck up, Sal!
Shut the fuck up!

1133
01:17:37,064 --> 01:17:39,430
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
Want to fuckin' tell me?

1134
01:17:39,566 --> 01:17:40,794
'Cause I don't know what you're doing.

1135
01:17:40,934 --> 01:17:43,459
We have lost all five rounds,
is that what you want?

1136
01:17:43,604 --> 01:17:45,936
Dreadful.
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1137
01:17:46,073 --> 01:17:48,701
You gotta show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm gonna stop the fight.

1138
01:17:48,842 --> 01:17:49,968
Now they're gonna stop the fight, Micky.

1139
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:52,044
He's gotta go inside, Ma.

1140
01:17:52,179 --> 01:17:54,340
He's gotta take it to the body.
He's gotta.

1141
01:17:54,481 --> 01:17:55,709
Come on, get your punches up...

1142
01:17:55,849 --> 01:17:58,079
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're gonna stop this fight.

1143
01:17:58,218 --> 01:18:00,413
Then you gotta do something, baby.

1144
01:18:00,554 --> 01:18:02,215
That's not what we talked about, Micky.

1145
01:18:02,356 --> 01:18:05,416
We had a plan and you're
not doing it. Now, let's go.

1146
01:18:05,559 --> 01:18:06,617
All right, Micky.

1147
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,696
You've lost the first five rounds.
What's the next strategy gonna be?

1148
01:18:10,831 --> 01:18:14,597
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1149
01:18:14,735 --> 01:18:17,727
A couple of the left hooks landed
flush on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1150
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:20,169
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1151
01:18:20,307 --> 01:18:22,138
Very curious performance
by Micky Ward.

1152
01:18:22,276 --> 01:18:23,607
Come on, Micky, come on!

1153
01:18:23,744 --> 01:18:26,577
Ward seems...
trying to land one big shot

1154
01:18:26,713 --> 01:18:28,977
to change Sanchez's mind...

1155
01:18:29,116 --> 01:18:30,811
And he's beginning to open up.

1156
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:33,511
Taking advantage of more and more
opportunities to get close to Ward

1157
01:18:33,654 --> 01:18:35,121
and throw against a fighter...

1158
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:36,279
Time!

1159
01:18:36,423 --> 01:18:38,755
...who's not defending himself
by punching.

1160
01:18:39,526 --> 01:18:41,858
Sanchez is gonna try
to end this fight.

1161
01:18:48,435 --> 01:18:50,300
- What are you doing? Come on!
- That's it.

1162
01:18:51,338 --> 01:18:52,703
Good boy!

1163
01:18:54,074 --> 01:18:55,336
He's down on an uppercut!

1164
01:18:59,546 --> 01:19:03,038
- Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.
- ...three, four, five...

1165
01:19:03,183 --> 01:19:06,448
And right after Ward threw
a pretty good right hand.

1166
01:19:06,587 --> 01:19:09,556
Mick, you all right?
Come to me. Come to me.

1167
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:11,590
This is a fight
that should be stopped.

1168
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,484
Come on, head, body, head.

1169
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:18,821
This is not professional.

1170
01:19:18,966 --> 01:19:20,729
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1171
01:19:20,868 --> 01:19:23,894
- Punch him! You gotta punch!
- Someone should pay me to watch this.

1172
01:19:24,037 --> 01:19:27,029
Come on, man! Head, body, head!

1173
01:19:28,775 --> 01:19:30,072
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1174
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:32,701
That was good.
Maybe it'll turn him around.

1175
01:19:32,846 --> 01:19:35,007
Maybe. I'm talking about if I...

1176
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,251
Sanchez drops
like he's shot! Oh, my God!

1177
01:19:39,386 --> 01:19:43,482
The most unlikely
knockout you have ever seen.

1178
01:19:43,624 --> 01:19:46,525
That was a kidney shot,
the kind of kidney shot...

1179
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,560
...nine, ten!

1180
01:19:51,164 --> 01:19:53,462
I still don't believe
what I just saw.

1181
01:19:57,404 --> 01:19:59,599
Oh, Micky won!

1182
01:20:02,175 --> 01:20:04,541
Now, did Micky Ward
just make idiots of us all

1183
01:20:04,678 --> 01:20:08,705
with a spectacular piece of strategy?
Take another look. Amazing.

1184
01:20:08,849 --> 01:20:11,477
A brilliant win in the career
of Micky Ward out of Lowell, Mass.

1185
01:20:11,618 --> 01:20:14,917
Unbelievable defeat
at the hands of Micky Ward,

1186
01:20:15,055 --> 01:20:19,492
who had all but given away the first
half-dozen rounds of the bout.

1187
01:20:19,626 --> 01:20:21,753
I think what Micky did was he recognized

1188
01:20:21,895 --> 01:20:23,692
that he'd hurt the guy
with the body shot.

1189
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:26,628
Micky's a better fighter than that to
not be runnin' from that guy like that.

1190
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:28,758
Theater of the unexpected.

1191
01:20:28,902 --> 01:20:31,268
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1192
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:32,872
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

1193
01:20:33,874 --> 01:20:35,466
You can't make it up, folks.

1194
01:20:35,609 --> 01:20:37,099
You hear what he said?

1195
01:20:37,244 --> 01:20:38,939
He said, "You can't give up
in this game."

1196
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:42,014
Well, maybe Micky Ward
heard me say you should stop this fight

1197
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:43,878
and he went out and stopped it.

1198
01:20:44,551 --> 01:20:47,213
- Right there. Right there.
- Yeah! I can't believe it.

1199
01:20:47,354 --> 01:20:50,221
I'm lookin' over, and I'm thinkin'
to myself like they were thinkin':

1200
01:20:50,357 --> 01:20:51,585
This thing is over.

1201
01:20:51,725 --> 01:20:53,659
But I tell you what, if you
looked at the commentators,

1202
01:20:53,794 --> 01:20:56,422
they started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

1203
01:20:56,563 --> 01:20:57,928
They just wanted to get out of there.

1204
01:20:58,065 --> 01:21:00,761
Mick, Mick.
I just spoke to Mike Toma.

1205
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:03,267
- He told me something very interesting.
- Holy shit, what?

1206
01:21:03,403 --> 01:21:04,768
He just told me,

1207
01:21:04,905 --> 01:21:07,465
had Sanchez won tonight,
he would've gotten the title shot.

1208
01:21:07,608 --> 01:21:10,702
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1209
01:21:10,844 --> 01:21:15,440
- A title shot. Mick gets the shot.
- Micky gets the shot!

1210
01:21:15,582 --> 01:21:18,983
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you sure about that?

1211
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:22,350
I just spoke to the guy. Mike!
Come here, Mike. Look, tell these guys.

1212
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:24,286
- Hey, Mike Toma. Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1213
01:21:24,424 --> 01:21:27,518
You're not a stepping stone anymore.
I always knew you had the talent.

1214
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:30,494
That was a hell of a strategy, wearing
him down and taking it to the body.

1215
01:21:30,631 --> 01:21:33,600
Thirty years in the business,
I'd never seen a knockout like that.

1216
01:21:33,734 --> 01:21:35,224
Larry Merchant was writing
your obituary,

1217
01:21:35,369 --> 01:21:36,666
and Sanchez drops
like he's shot with a gun.

1218
01:21:36,803 --> 01:21:38,566
Where'd you get that?

1219
01:21:38,705 --> 01:21:40,070
That's the first thing
my brother taught me.

1220
01:21:40,207 --> 01:21:41,640
Tap 'em to the head,
ding 'em to the body.

1221
01:21:41,775 --> 01:21:43,800
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1222
01:21:43,944 --> 01:21:47,004
- You ready for a title shot?
- I ain't gettin' no younger.

1223
01:21:47,648 --> 01:21:49,980
Thanks, Mr. Toma. Thank you.

1224
01:21:50,117 --> 01:21:52,017
He's ready. You're ready, aren't ya?

1225
01:21:52,986 --> 01:21:55,614
Shea Neary in London
for the title.

1226
01:21:55,756 --> 01:21:57,690
Are you kidding,
we got some celebrating to do.

1227
01:21:57,824 --> 01:21:59,223
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

1228
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:01,850
- Gonna have a great champ in my boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Toma.

1229
01:22:04,431 --> 01:22:06,422
It's what your brother
would've always wanted.

1230
01:22:06,566 --> 01:22:08,295
He's not even gonna be there.

1231
01:22:34,361 --> 01:22:37,421
- Hey!
- Daddy!

1232
01:22:37,564 --> 01:22:39,589
- Come here, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1233
01:22:40,701 --> 01:22:42,862
Good to see you!

1234
01:22:44,304 --> 01:22:48,570
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Yeah!

1235
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:51,041
- Sweetheart.
- Hey, Ma.

1236
01:22:51,178 --> 01:22:55,740
Oh, you look so good. Oh, my God.

1237
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:05,988
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1238
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:08,727
I got new teeth. Everything.

1239
01:23:08,862 --> 01:23:10,193
How you think I look?

1240
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:12,457
- Good.
- Yeah?

1241
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,439
Cake and more cake.

1242
01:23:27,581 --> 01:23:30,175
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream and cake.

1243
01:23:30,317 --> 01:23:32,911
Ice cream and cake and cake. Right?

1244
01:23:33,053 --> 01:23:36,216
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake...

1245
01:23:36,356 --> 01:23:37,914
Quacka!

1246
01:23:43,096 --> 01:23:44,586
Ma.

1247
01:23:57,544 --> 01:24:00,570
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

1248
01:24:04,985 --> 01:24:07,317
Hey, Georgie. What, they let
you outta the house now?

1249
01:24:07,454 --> 01:24:09,979
- Yeah.
- Lettin' him outta the house, Ma?

1250
01:24:10,123 --> 01:24:12,148
Hey, look, I want you
to meet Sal Lonano.

1251
01:24:18,999 --> 01:24:20,967
How you doing, Dicky?

1252
01:24:23,003 --> 01:24:24,470
Let's spar.

1253
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:34,146
Hey, Charlene.

1254
01:24:59,372 --> 01:25:01,033
Welcome back!

1255
01:25:01,174 --> 01:25:03,836
It's supposed to be a surprise.
You're late.

1256
01:25:04,945 --> 01:25:07,175
- Hey.
- Hey.

1257
01:25:07,314 --> 01:25:10,806
Mick, I can't even tell you, being in
this smelly-ass locker room. You know?

1258
01:25:10,951 --> 01:25:13,613
Being back with you,
this is what got me through.

1259
01:25:13,753 --> 01:25:18,122
- You look good. Your eyes are clear.
- Yeah. You know...

1260
01:25:19,326 --> 01:25:22,056
...Alice says prison might've
been the best thing for me.

1261
01:25:22,195 --> 01:25:25,596
Got me clean. Got me clear. Up here.

1262
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,668
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1263
01:25:30,403 --> 01:25:34,237
- I gotta talk to you about something.
- Yeah.

1264
01:25:34,374 --> 01:25:37,866
Look at this locker.
The old locker.

1265
01:25:38,011 --> 01:25:39,638
I love it. Fuckin' love it.

1266
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:45,139
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1267
01:25:54,995 --> 01:25:58,726
I had to. After everything
that happened, I'm sorry.

1268
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:06,036
You stickin' to that?

1269
01:26:07,474 --> 01:26:12,070
I'm glad you're back. You look good.

1270
01:26:12,212 --> 01:26:15,443
I don't know what else to say.

1271
01:26:22,422 --> 01:26:24,720
- Mick, you fuckin' kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1272
01:26:29,496 --> 01:26:32,465
- Oh, hey, Mick.
- Come on, come on!

1273
01:26:32,599 --> 01:26:36,695
You gotta... Ma. You gotta
do this at home. Please?

1274
01:26:36,836 --> 01:26:38,531
What are you talkin' about?
What's the matter?

1275
01:26:38,672 --> 01:26:40,731
Mom, please?

1276
01:26:40,874 --> 01:26:43,206
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1277
01:26:43,343 --> 01:26:44,776
I know. We'll see him at home.

1278
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,466
- What the hell...?
- Would you please pack it up?

1279
01:27:09,602 --> 01:27:11,001
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

1280
01:27:11,771 --> 01:27:14,604
If that's what Micky wants,
we're gonna put it away.

1281
01:27:14,741 --> 01:27:16,971
- There's your brother.
- Dicky...

1282
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:20,307
- How ya doing?
- Micky?

1283
01:27:24,985 --> 01:27:27,476
That's nice. That's nice.

1284
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:29,087
We've been working on it
for two weeks.

1285
01:27:29,222 --> 01:27:31,156
Sherri, come on, stop it.

1286
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:32,758
All right, girls,
come on, let's go home.

1287
01:27:32,892 --> 01:27:35,258
It's not the time to do this,
obviously. Come on.

1288
01:27:35,395 --> 01:27:39,661
You stay here.
What the hell's going on?

1289
01:27:39,799 --> 01:27:42,290
- What's going on?
- We ain't gonna work together.

1290
01:27:43,336 --> 01:27:45,099
He don't want me to work with him.

1291
01:27:45,238 --> 01:27:47,331
What're you talking about?

1292
01:27:47,474 --> 01:27:49,533
That's not right.

1293
01:27:49,676 --> 01:27:53,168
Micky never would've won
Sanchez without Dicky.

1294
01:27:53,313 --> 01:27:55,543
That's fuckin' bullshit! Take it back!

1295
01:27:55,682 --> 01:27:58,048
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fuckin'
talk to my mother that way.

1296
01:27:58,184 --> 01:27:59,173
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1297
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:00,911
Take 'em home.

1298
01:28:02,956 --> 01:28:04,389
Why don't you ask Micky?

1299
01:28:05,325 --> 01:28:07,589
If we're gonna train, they gotta go.

1300
01:28:07,727 --> 01:28:09,661
They gotta go, Mick, come on.

1301
01:28:10,663 --> 01:28:14,360
Ask him, George. Ask him if he would've
won Sanchez without his brother?

1302
01:28:14,501 --> 01:28:16,162
Hey, take him outside, all right?

1303
01:28:18,371 --> 01:28:20,703
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1304
01:28:21,841 --> 01:28:23,035
How can you say that to O'Keefe?

1305
01:28:23,176 --> 01:28:24,666
Because it's true.

1306
01:28:25,512 --> 01:28:27,275
I went with that game plan,
it wasn't working.

1307
01:28:27,414 --> 01:28:29,439
So I went back to what
I learned with Dicky.

1308
01:28:29,582 --> 01:28:32,483
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, OK?

1309
01:28:33,319 --> 01:28:36,186
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

1310
01:28:36,322 --> 01:28:38,813
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1311
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:42,189
and from Sal and
your father and from me.

1312
01:28:43,763 --> 01:28:45,958
- Dicky's a junk bag.
- Hey.

1313
01:28:46,099 --> 01:28:47,259
He's a junk bag!

1314
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,992
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Fuck you.

1315
01:28:49,135 --> 01:28:50,568
- I'm eight months sober.
- Oh, yeah,

1316
01:28:50,703 --> 01:28:52,500
and I'm sure you're gonna need
something now that you're out.

1317
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:54,436
"Oh, my back. Oh, my back."

1318
01:28:54,574 --> 01:28:56,906
- Fuck you always picking on me for?
- No, fuck you!

1319
01:28:57,043 --> 01:28:58,806
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1320
01:28:58,945 --> 01:29:01,573
One day at a fucking time, right,
O'Keefe? You know what I mean?

1321
01:29:01,714 --> 01:29:03,113
What, it's all right
for him to be here?

1322
01:29:03,249 --> 01:29:05,615
Why am I the fuckin' problem?
I'm his blood, I'm his family!

1323
01:29:05,752 --> 01:29:07,777
- You are the problem!
- I'm the one fighting, OK?

1324
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:10,389
Not you, not you, and not you.

1325
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:13,759
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

1326
01:29:13,893 --> 01:29:15,417
I want Dicky back.

1327
01:29:16,629 --> 01:29:18,927
And I want you, Charlene.
And I want O'Keefe.

1328
01:29:19,065 --> 01:29:21,465
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1329
01:29:23,369 --> 01:29:25,360
It's not the deal we made, baby.

1330
01:29:25,505 --> 01:29:26,995
She's right, Micky.
That's not the deal.

1331
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:31,099
It wasn't the deal.
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1332
01:29:31,244 --> 01:29:32,905
- You sound like them now.
- I sound like them now?

1333
01:29:33,046 --> 01:29:34,673
- Yeah, you sound like them.
- You sound like them.

1334
01:29:34,814 --> 01:29:36,281
How could I do this to you?
"You can't do that to us.

1335
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:40,045
He can't do that to us."
You sound like them.

1336
01:29:40,186 --> 01:29:41,813
You should fuckin' listen to yourself.

1337
01:29:41,955 --> 01:29:44,515
You sound like them and maybe
this is where you belong.

1338
01:29:44,657 --> 01:29:46,124
That's the way you love him?

1339
01:29:46,259 --> 01:29:48,284
- Charlene!
- Come on!

1340
01:29:48,428 --> 01:29:51,693
- You wanted your brother? Good luck.
- O'Keefe, come on.

1341
01:29:51,831 --> 01:29:54,527
- Mickey.
- Mickey.

1342
01:29:57,637 --> 01:30:00,128
Come on, everything
happens for a reason.

1343
01:30:00,974 --> 01:30:06,139
You know? Maybe it's for the best.
God has a plan.

1344
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:10,378
Wanna spar with your brother?

1345
01:30:17,056 --> 01:30:19,183
Dick Eklund, pride of Lowell!

1346
01:30:20,126 --> 01:30:22,219
Watching that for years, huh?

1347
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:26,290
Micky, Micky!

1348
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:28,957
Whoa, hey!
What the hell are you doing?

1349
01:30:29,102 --> 01:30:30,364
Micky!

1350
01:30:30,503 --> 01:30:32,403
- Daddy! Daddy, Daddy!
- For crying out loud!

1351
01:30:32,539 --> 01:30:34,097
Take that baby out of here.

1352
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,832
I told you take him away
ten minutes ago!

1353
01:30:36,809 --> 01:30:40,108
Sweetheart, you all right?
You OK? Your back?

1354
01:30:40,246 --> 01:30:43,545
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1355
01:30:43,683 --> 01:30:47,414
Can this be my fight, Alice?
Just once?

1356
01:30:47,554 --> 01:30:51,115
Maybe just this one time
not for Dicky?

1357
01:30:51,257 --> 01:30:53,316
I know you think he's coming back.

1358
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:55,359
He's 40 years old and doesn't
have a tooth in his head

1359
01:30:55,495 --> 01:30:58,191
- that's his fuckin' own.
- I'll go fuckin' ten rounds.

1360
01:30:58,331 --> 01:31:00,458
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1361
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,397
- What are you sayin', sweetheart?
- I'm Shea Neary...

1362
01:31:02,535 --> 01:31:05,595
Shut up before I bust your
fuckin' head open, Dicky.

1363
01:31:05,738 --> 01:31:08,673
- Hey, hey...
- What're you gonna do? I'm Shea Neary.

1364
01:31:08,808 --> 01:31:10,173
You want me to bust
your fuckin' head open?

1365
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:11,709
Come on, come on! George, please!

1366
01:31:11,844 --> 01:31:13,971
- Dicky!
- Please! What are you saying?

1367
01:31:14,113 --> 01:31:17,571
- Tell me what you're saying.
- This is supposed to be my fight.

1368
01:31:17,717 --> 01:31:20,277
This is my shot at a title.
I won't get another one after this.

1369
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:21,910
- Am I being selfish?
- No.

1370
01:31:22,055 --> 01:31:24,853
Am I saying, "Micky, Micky, Micky?"
You know what? If I am, I'm sorry.

1371
01:31:24,991 --> 01:31:26,458
I thought I was fightin'
for the championship.

1372
01:31:26,593 --> 01:31:28,618
And I thought you
were my mother, too.

1373
01:31:29,963 --> 01:31:31,988
I am your mother.

1374
01:31:32,865 --> 01:31:34,423
Yeah, Ma.

1375
01:31:36,803 --> 01:31:40,967
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

1376
01:31:41,107 --> 01:31:43,268
If I made mistakes,
I'm gonna be better.

1377
01:31:44,444 --> 01:31:48,813
I don't wanna hurt you.
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

1378
01:31:54,621 --> 01:31:55,918
Dicky!

1379
01:31:56,055 --> 01:31:57,420
Stay with him.

1380
01:31:58,391 --> 01:32:02,157
Dicky... Dicky!

1381
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,691
- Dicky!
- Gotta do something.

1382
01:32:09,836 --> 01:32:12,361
Dicky, wait, come on!

1383
01:32:12,505 --> 01:32:16,635
- Micky wants you! I want you!
- I gotta do something.

1384
01:32:16,776 --> 01:32:19,040
I know what that means.
Don't do this!

1385
01:32:47,473 --> 01:32:49,065
Hey, Chan.

1386
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:56,271
- What's going on?
- Hey, Dicky.

1387
01:32:58,217 --> 01:32:59,650
Hey, Dicky's back!

1388
01:32:59,786 --> 01:33:01,378
Hey!

1389
01:33:03,356 --> 01:33:04,653
Look at you!

1390
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:07,919
What's up, my boy?
How you doing? Good to see you, man.

1391
01:33:08,061 --> 01:33:11,588
- You look good. Welcome back.
- Yeah, you're looking good.

1392
01:33:11,731 --> 01:33:13,392
- Great.
- Good to see ya.

1393
01:33:13,533 --> 01:33:16,058
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

1394
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:20,202
What's up, man?
You're looking good.

1395
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:22,672
- Wanna head upstairs?
- Dicky's back.

1396
01:33:22,809 --> 01:33:25,175
- Hi, Dicky. We're gonna party.
- Go upstairs, man?

1397
01:33:29,148 --> 01:33:32,015
- Go upstairs, take a while?
- We missed you!

1398
01:33:32,151 --> 01:33:35,382
- Let's go, buddy.
- Come on, Dicky.

1399
01:33:38,891 --> 01:33:42,850
- Make for a little party for you...
- Hey, come back.

1400
01:33:43,696 --> 01:33:46,130
- What the fuck's that all about?
- What the hell was that?

1401
01:34:02,081 --> 01:34:04,743
Charlene? It's Dicky.

1402
01:34:06,519 --> 01:34:08,749
Get off my porch,
you piece of shit.

1403
01:34:11,124 --> 01:34:12,751
How fuckin' dare you...

1404
01:34:14,193 --> 01:34:15,387
...cocksucker...

1405
01:34:16,195 --> 01:34:17,321
...fuckin'...

1406
01:34:20,767 --> 01:34:22,098
You're a fuckin' asshole, Dicky.

1407
01:34:22,235 --> 01:34:24,135
I want you off my fuckin' porch!

1408
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:27,330
Why don't you just fuckin'
come down here and talk to me?

1409
01:34:27,473 --> 01:34:29,805
Such an asshole, coming to my
fucking house. You piece of shit!

1410
01:34:29,942 --> 01:34:31,500
- Standing on my porch...
- Charlene...

1411
01:34:31,644 --> 01:34:35,273
It's not fuckin' lady-like to be
shoutin' in the street like this.

1412
01:34:35,415 --> 01:34:37,144
You're such a fuckin' cocksucker
coming over here.

1413
01:34:37,283 --> 01:34:39,114
- Please?
- Oh, yeah, you think I fuckin' care?

1414
01:34:39,252 --> 01:34:42,483
- Come on, just fuckin'...
- Get off my fuckin' porch, Dicky!

1415
01:34:42,622 --> 01:34:46,524
Would you just fuckin'
come down here... and talk to me?

1416
01:34:56,102 --> 01:34:58,832
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a Cocker Spaniel?

1417
01:35:04,477 --> 01:35:06,172
All right, I know you
can't fuckin' stand me.

1418
01:35:06,312 --> 01:35:07,472
Really, what makes you say that?

1419
01:35:07,613 --> 01:35:11,105
I ain't got no use for you, either.
All right? But my brother loves ya.

1420
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,411
And you can't just
run away because of me.

1421
01:35:13,553 --> 01:35:15,521
He don't deserve that. All right?

1422
01:35:15,655 --> 01:35:18,146
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1423
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:21,124
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

1424
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,228
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

1425
01:35:23,362 --> 01:35:24,989
But I want you to think about something.

1426
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:28,157
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did.

1427
01:35:28,301 --> 01:35:29,859
That in my time, I never had.

1428
01:35:30,002 --> 01:35:33,062
"Oh, yeah, my big chance
was with Sugar Ray Leonard.

1429
01:35:33,206 --> 01:35:35,140
I'm so great.
I'm the pride of fuckin' Lowell.

1430
01:35:35,274 --> 01:35:37,265
Oh, yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."
I've heard it.

1431
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:38,638
I came here to make things right.

1432
01:35:38,778 --> 01:35:40,177
- OK, let's make things right.
- Yeah.

1433
01:35:40,313 --> 01:35:44,579
Number one: You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1434
01:35:46,219 --> 01:35:48,847
I was in the ring. Don't you think
I know what really happened that day?

1435
01:35:48,988 --> 01:35:52,321
All right? What have you
ever done with your life?

1436
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:54,483
- I like my life.
- Yeah, what you ever done with it?

1437
01:35:54,627 --> 01:35:57,357
- I like my life now, Dicky.
- What have you done with your life?

1438
01:35:57,497 --> 01:35:58,896
You're a college dropout, Charlene.

1439
01:35:59,031 --> 01:36:01,829
You're just a little bar girl.
Your life sucks.

1440
01:36:03,302 --> 01:36:06,362
All right. I drank too much.

1441
01:36:06,506 --> 01:36:08,565
I worked in a lot of bars.

1442
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:11,700
And I ruined a lot of opportunities, but
I'm trying to do something better here.

1443
01:36:11,844 --> 01:36:14,210
- And so is Micky.
- And so am I.

1444
01:36:16,015 --> 01:36:20,850
And he needs me. You heard him.
And I know he needs you.

1445
01:36:23,956 --> 01:36:26,049
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1446
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:28,887
It's icing.

1447
01:36:32,098 --> 01:36:36,432
OK. I'll see ya in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1448
01:36:36,569 --> 01:36:38,503
- It's a deal.
- All right? It's a deal.

1449
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:53,314
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1450
01:36:54,987 --> 01:36:58,548
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1451
01:36:59,592 --> 01:37:01,355
I will.

1452
01:37:06,632 --> 01:37:07,690
Hey, Mick...

1453
01:37:10,102 --> 01:37:13,560
You think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

1454
01:37:13,706 --> 01:37:17,472
Went ten rounds. One of the best
ever and he couldn't hurt you.

1455
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:19,544
You were my hero.

1456
01:37:20,179 --> 01:37:21,976
I was.

1457
01:37:23,516 --> 01:37:25,040
I was.

1458
01:37:30,222 --> 01:37:32,247
I'm sorry.

1459
01:37:32,391 --> 01:37:33,949
You are?

1460
01:38:51,871 --> 01:38:53,964
There's a press conference downstairs.

1461
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,398
Come on, let's go.

1462
01:38:56,909 --> 01:38:58,035
Spot of tea, mate!

1463
01:38:58,177 --> 01:39:02,307
Neary: ten stone... six pound.

1464
01:39:08,954 --> 01:39:13,015
Ward: ten stone... six pound.

1465
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:16,924
Hey, Micky, Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

1466
01:39:19,165 --> 01:39:22,134
- How you been training?
- I train, I train hard.

1467
01:39:22,268 --> 01:39:24,532
Shea's 22 and 0.
He's never been knocked down.

1468
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:27,002
- That's gonna change tomorrow.
- In fact, we expected

1469
01:39:27,139 --> 01:39:28,367
a much better fighter.

1470
01:39:29,275 --> 01:39:31,175
I'm just grateful to be here
and have the opportunity.

1471
01:39:31,310 --> 01:39:32,777
Thank you guys for the shot.

1472
01:39:32,912 --> 01:39:37,008
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?
And who would you like to fight next?

1473
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:40,582
I plan on moving right
through Micky Ward tomorrow.

1474
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,813
Moving on to other great fighters,
like Gatti.

1475
01:39:42,955 --> 01:39:45,219
Yeah, I believe Gatti and I
would make a great match.

1476
01:39:45,357 --> 01:39:46,847
Are you scared, Mr. Ward?

1477
01:39:59,972 --> 01:40:03,237
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, 12 rounds of boxing

1478
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:09,007
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1479
01:40:12,985 --> 01:40:14,111
I can't see!

1480
01:40:15,588 --> 01:40:18,989
Here I go again on my own

1481
01:40:20,659 --> 01:40:24,220
Goin' down the only road
I've ever known

1482
01:40:25,898 --> 01:40:30,164
Like a drifter
I was born to walk alone

1483
01:40:31,537 --> 01:40:35,064
- Hey, fellas, let's go.
- I made up my mind

1484
01:40:37,643 --> 01:40:40,510
I ain't wasting no more time

1485
01:40:41,914 --> 01:40:46,317
Here I go again on my own

1486
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,183
Going down the only road
I've ever known

1487
01:40:52,792 --> 01:40:56,421
Like a drifter I was born
to walk alone

1488
01:40:56,562 --> 01:40:58,496
Don't listen to 'em, Mick.

1489
01:40:59,431 --> 01:41:01,991
I made up my mind

1490
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:07,701
I ain't wasting no more time...

1491
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:13,940
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts,

1492
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:17,480
entering the ring. It's his
first fight outside the United States.

1493
01:41:17,616 --> 01:41:23,612
Micky Ward: 30 wins, seven losses.
He's gotten better recently, 20 KOs.

1494
01:41:24,957 --> 01:41:28,518
And now Ward awaits his
opponent, Shea Neary.

1495
01:41:28,661 --> 01:41:33,462
Neary regards himself
as the European Arturo Gatti.

1496
01:41:33,599 --> 01:41:36,227
Meaning that he is a head-on,
high-contact fighter

1497
01:41:36,368 --> 01:41:39,201
who throws 70 punches per round.

1498
01:41:40,773 --> 01:41:42,434
Neary's from Liverpool
and should have

1499
01:41:42,575 --> 01:41:44,509
a huge following here tonight.

1500
01:41:46,445 --> 01:41:50,939
Accompanied
by Paint the Town Red by The Mahones.

1501
01:41:51,083 --> 01:41:54,519
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1502
01:41:54,653 --> 01:41:58,282
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated.

1503
01:41:58,424 --> 01:42:02,258
Lives a Spartan existence.
And according to his promoters,

1504
01:42:02,394 --> 01:42:06,797
does nothing but eat,
drink, think, fantasize...

1505
01:42:06,932 --> 01:42:09,332
...dream of fighting.

1506
01:42:09,468 --> 01:42:13,131
Shea Neary has had 22
professional fights and won them all.

1507
01:42:13,272 --> 01:42:15,263
Seventeen KOs.

1508
01:42:25,551 --> 01:42:29,180
Come out when you hear the bell.
Don't piss about. Shake hands.

1509
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:33,348
Both of ya... shake hands!

1510
01:42:33,492 --> 01:42:37,326
As close as we just saw
them in the middle of the ring,

1511
01:42:37,463 --> 01:42:39,795
- forehead to forehead,
- Did you see that?

1512
01:42:39,932 --> 01:42:45,564
that's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

1513
01:42:45,704 --> 01:42:47,638
Ward is a long ways from home.

1514
01:42:47,773 --> 01:42:49,502
Don't coast in a foreign country.

1515
01:42:49,642 --> 01:42:51,371
Well, the big challenge for Ward

1516
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:54,502
is to get off to a faster start
than is customary for him.

1517
01:42:54,647 --> 01:42:58,208
Micky Ward, a notoriously
slow starter in big fights,

1518
01:42:58,350 --> 01:43:00,784
Shea Neary, an ultra-fast starter.

1519
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:03,150
And that's the question
that hovers over round one.

1520
01:43:03,289 --> 01:43:04,813
Will Ward be ready for the fight?

1521
01:43:04,957 --> 01:43:08,393
Already, Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes!

1522
01:43:08,527 --> 01:43:11,655
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1523
01:43:12,965 --> 01:43:15,160
Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1524
01:43:15,301 --> 01:43:17,166
And a big uppercut by Neary.

1525
01:43:17,303 --> 01:43:19,533
Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1526
01:43:19,672 --> 01:43:21,606
- Come on, Micky!
- Keeps Ward off balance,

1527
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:23,105
jabbing here and there.

1528
01:43:25,144 --> 01:43:29,308
There's a good left hook
by Neary as he stepped in on Ward.

1529
01:43:29,448 --> 01:43:34,351
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

1530
01:43:34,486 --> 01:43:36,477
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1531
01:43:36,622 --> 01:43:39,147
And a left hook
lands up top from Micky Ward.

1532
01:43:40,326 --> 01:43:42,191
Neary digging his
own right hand to the body.

1533
01:43:42,328 --> 01:43:44,296
They trade shots at close range.

1534
01:43:45,631 --> 01:43:48,031
Ward, he's trying
to match Neary blow for blow

1535
01:43:48,167 --> 01:43:53,503
and now Neary starts to come on and
take the last 30 seconds of the round...

1536
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:54,833
How about that?

1537
01:43:54,974 --> 01:43:56,202
Break!

1538
01:43:57,443 --> 01:44:00,310
Tremendous barrage in
the first minute. Just look at this.

1539
01:44:00,446 --> 01:44:04,007
- Unbelievable.
- What a great round one!

1540
01:44:04,149 --> 01:44:07,949
Ward is gonna have
to pick up the tempo

1541
01:44:08,087 --> 01:44:10,180
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1542
01:44:10,322 --> 01:44:13,416
No doubt, Neary is a better boxer.

1543
01:44:15,894 --> 01:44:20,729
Four hard right hands...
Neary has belted in the last minute.

1544
01:44:20,866 --> 01:44:24,233
Quicker than Ward,
more assertive than Ward,

1545
01:44:24,370 --> 01:44:26,031
surer of what he wants to do.

1546
01:44:26,171 --> 01:44:28,833
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

1547
01:44:28,974 --> 01:44:30,874
Ward's gonna have
to step it up a little bit more

1548
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,136
than he is right now.

1549
01:44:32,277 --> 01:44:34,074
Micky Ward's corner
taking a real deep look

1550
01:44:34,213 --> 01:44:35,510
at what's going on now.

1551
01:44:35,647 --> 01:44:39,310
And his family at ringside well aware
he's stepping up in class.

1552
01:44:39,451 --> 01:44:42,386
Ward has fallen to the pedal.
He's gotta be more aggressive.

1553
01:44:42,521 --> 01:44:44,716
He can't just try to wait
until everything is perfect.

1554
01:44:44,857 --> 01:44:47,849
His dominance over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

1555
01:44:47,993 --> 01:44:52,362
because his technical plan
was the right one and he's executing it.

1556
01:44:52,498 --> 01:44:56,195
Punches like these make it seem...

1557
01:44:57,036 --> 01:44:59,698
...that it's now Neary's fight.

1558
01:45:01,206 --> 01:45:03,140
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war

1559
01:45:03,275 --> 01:45:05,709
with this strong of fighter as Neary.

1560
01:45:07,413 --> 01:45:11,372
They are trying
to hurt each other with every punch.

1561
01:45:11,517 --> 01:45:16,011
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

1562
01:45:16,155 --> 01:45:19,420
And Ward wobbled there
by a right cross from Neary!

1563
01:45:19,558 --> 01:45:22,118
Ward hurting now. His legs are gone.

1564
01:45:22,261 --> 01:45:25,822
Neary goes to the body
as he tries to finish Micky.

1565
01:45:27,066 --> 01:45:29,125
Vicious body shots from Neary.

1566
01:45:29,268 --> 01:45:32,795
And Ward still doesn't
even try to move off the ropes!

1567
01:45:32,938 --> 01:45:35,133
I don't know if he can, Jim.

1568
01:45:35,274 --> 01:45:37,333
He's waiting for Neary
to punch himself out.

1569
01:45:37,476 --> 01:45:40,206
Down goes Micky Ward! He may be out.

1570
01:45:40,345 --> 01:45:41,607
That ain't fuckin' it!

1571
01:45:41,747 --> 01:45:45,080
- One... two...
- Come on! That's it!

1572
01:45:46,452 --> 01:45:49,910
- That's my boy!
- Forward! Forward! Come on!

1573
01:45:51,723 --> 01:45:53,884
Ward is out on his feet.

1574
01:45:54,026 --> 01:45:56,995
Loser! Go back to America!

1575
01:45:57,129 --> 01:46:00,530
- This could be it for Micky Ward.
- Dicky, give him the fuckin' stool.

1576
01:46:00,666 --> 01:46:02,691
Charlene, will you get
the fuck outta here.

1577
01:46:02,835 --> 01:46:04,860
He needs to fuckin' sit down!

1578
01:46:05,537 --> 01:46:08,097
His brother's got
Ward jumping to wake up his legs.

1579
01:46:10,008 --> 01:46:13,967
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

1580
01:46:14,113 --> 01:46:16,172
It's Micky Ward
against the aggressiveness

1581
01:46:16,315 --> 01:46:18,283
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1582
01:46:19,451 --> 01:46:22,716
If you don't have your defense up,
you can really get hurt.

1583
01:46:22,855 --> 01:46:24,982
He's making it very
difficult for Micky Ward.

1584
01:46:25,124 --> 01:46:27,752
I don't think he's gonna
get into it at this rate.

1585
01:46:27,893 --> 01:46:30,088
This is a survival mode...

1586
01:46:30,229 --> 01:46:34,029
Are you like me? Was just
good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1587
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:35,724
Never had to win, did I?

1588
01:46:35,868 --> 01:46:39,031
You gotta do more in there.
You gotta win a title.

1589
01:46:39,171 --> 01:46:42,163
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1590
01:46:42,307 --> 01:46:45,105
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

1591
01:46:45,244 --> 01:46:47,178
I had my time and I blew it.
You don't have to.

1592
01:46:47,312 --> 01:46:49,109
All right?
You fuckin' get out there,

1593
01:46:49,248 --> 01:46:51,273
and use all the shit
that you've been through,

1594
01:46:51,416 --> 01:46:53,316
all the shit we've gone through
over the fuckin' years

1595
01:46:53,452 --> 01:46:56,478
and you put it in that ring right now.
This is yours. This is fuckin' yours.

1596
01:46:56,622 --> 01:46:59,591
OK. Fuckin' head, body, head, body.

1597
01:46:59,725 --> 01:47:01,317
Say it back to me.
Fuckin' say it back to me.

1598
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:03,018
- Head, body, head, body.
- Head, body, head, body.

1599
01:47:03,162 --> 01:47:05,824
Get in your mind this is
fucking yours. Fuckin' do it.

1600
01:47:05,964 --> 01:47:07,761
Stay off the fuckin' ropes.

1601
01:47:12,704 --> 01:47:14,899
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1602
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,804
I thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

1603
01:47:17,943 --> 01:47:20,503
he'll just get totally wiped out.

1604
01:47:22,214 --> 01:47:24,307
Off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

1605
01:47:25,684 --> 01:47:28,414
Once again, Ward against
the ropes as Neary is free to attack.

1606
01:47:28,554 --> 01:47:31,148
What are you doing? Come on, Mick!

1607
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:34,791
Sometimes if you wanna win,
you gotta be something that you're not.

1608
01:47:34,927 --> 01:47:36,554
Come on!

1609
01:47:37,596 --> 01:47:39,860
Off the fuckin' ropes, Mick,
that ain't it!

1610
01:47:39,998 --> 01:47:41,863
Neary continues to pound away.

1611
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:50,106
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time Micky! It's up to you!

1612
01:47:50,242 --> 01:47:53,473
- Two big misses by Neary!
- That's it! That's it!

1613
01:47:53,612 --> 01:47:56,911
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

1614
01:47:57,049 --> 01:47:59,108
He backs Neary off.

1615
01:47:59,251 --> 01:48:01,048
- Ward trades his way back.
- That's it!

1616
01:48:01,186 --> 01:48:03,654
Ward nods as if to say,
"Come on!"

1617
01:48:04,223 --> 01:48:05,781
"Come on, let's fight!"

1618
01:48:05,924 --> 01:48:07,721
Just imagine if you bought a ticket.

1619
01:48:07,859 --> 01:48:10,157
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1620
01:48:10,295 --> 01:48:12,991
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1621
01:48:13,131 --> 01:48:15,099
And a left hook to the body
and an uppercut lands

1622
01:48:15,234 --> 01:48:17,566
- and now he backs Neary off.
- Head, body, head fuckin' body!

1623
01:48:19,071 --> 01:48:21,301
Ward hurt Neary with a body shot.

1624
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,102
Ward hurts him again
with that left to the body.

1625
01:48:24,243 --> 01:48:27,940
Oh, and that one plants
Neary on his butt.

1626
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,640
First time in 23 professional fights

1627
01:48:30,782 --> 01:48:33,910
- that Shea Neary has been down.
- This is it! This is it!

1628
01:48:34,052 --> 01:48:36,612
This is it, Micky!

1629
01:48:36,755 --> 01:48:39,815
Keep going! Don't look at me for it!
Take it to him!

1630
01:48:42,294 --> 01:48:46,697
- Come on, Micky, get in there!
- Ward lands a huge left hook!

1631
01:48:46,832 --> 01:48:49,596
As Micky Ward pounds away!

1632
01:48:49,735 --> 01:48:53,432
Goes to the body with the left hook!
Lands the uppercut again!

1633
01:48:53,572 --> 01:48:55,540
Neary down for the second time.

1634
01:48:55,674 --> 01:48:57,699
Mickey Vann's gonna stop it there.

1635
01:48:57,843 --> 01:49:02,246
"Irish" Micky Ward
with a big eighth-round TKO!

1636
01:49:03,015 --> 01:49:04,277
He's done it again.

1637
01:49:06,084 --> 01:49:07,278
He's done it again.

1638
01:49:07,419 --> 01:49:12,379
The grinding, gutty Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory!

1639
01:49:25,237 --> 01:49:28,604
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fuckin' champ of the world!

1640
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:31,403
You fuckin' did it!

1641
01:49:39,651 --> 01:49:42,119
Oh, you're the best!

1642
01:49:42,254 --> 01:49:46,850
- Oh, I love you!
- My boy's the champion of the world!

1643
01:49:47,759 --> 01:49:49,249
I love you!

1644
01:50:19,758 --> 01:50:23,125
This town always said,
you're a fuckin' boxer, right?

1645
01:50:23,261 --> 01:50:27,197
He thought he was a piece of shit. He
put Lowell back on the map, you know?

1646
01:50:27,332 --> 01:50:28,594
- We.
- I tell ya...

1647
01:50:28,734 --> 01:50:30,998
- We.
- No, but hold on.

1648
01:50:31,136 --> 01:50:33,070
Who used to be the pride of Lowell?

1649
01:50:33,205 --> 01:50:35,639
Right here.
Who's the pride of Lowell now?

1650
01:50:35,774 --> 01:50:38,675
Right there.
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

1651
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:40,641
Handin' it down to him.

1652
01:50:40,779 --> 01:50:44,271
Nothin' better than that.
Nothin' better than that.

1653
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:47,977
He did it. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

1654
01:51:16,715 --> 01:51:19,946
Oh, look at cabbage head. Boo Boo!
Quacka!

1655
01:51:22,854 --> 01:51:25,414
- What's up buddy?
- Boo, where's your teeth?

1656
01:51:25,557 --> 01:51:28,720
Oh, I'm under arrest!
Let's go, move it out!

1657
01:51:30,929 --> 01:51:32,328
It's been real, ain't it?

1658
01:51:32,464 --> 01:51:35,900
It's been real, it's been unreal.
It's been a great experience.

1659
01:51:36,034 --> 01:51:37,968
Just glad it's done, finally,

1660
01:51:38,103 --> 01:51:41,163
and thanks to everyone so much,
from the bottom of my heart.

1661
01:51:41,306 --> 01:51:43,672
Thanks so much,
all you Hollywood people.

1662
01:51:43,809 --> 01:51:46,710
Now you know what I mean
when I say I can't get a word in.

1663
01:51:46,845 --> 01:51:49,473
I'm telling ya.
He'll never get a word in.

1664
01:51:49,614 --> 01:51:51,206
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

1665
01:51:51,349 --> 01:51:53,317
Peace, everybody.
