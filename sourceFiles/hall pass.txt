1
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,208
Do you recognize who this stud is
in the blue shorts right here?

2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,931
That's me
the summer I got out of college.

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,050
Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles.

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,009
Well, I still got a few.

5
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,321
Where?

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,121
They're hibernating.

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,160
Who's that girl?

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,647
That's Mommy.

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,565
No, the young one standing next to you.

10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,370
That's Mommy.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,251
How come Mommy
doesn't wear a bikini anymore?

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,562
Is it because of her fat ass?

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,961
Yeah. I guess.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,283
What? No.
Who said Mommy has a fat ass?

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,885
Mommy did.

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,485
Words hurt, Gunnar.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,331
Hey, honey. We better get a move on. We
gotta meet up with Fred and Grace soon.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,568
No, I know, I know. I'm trying.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,529
How long do you think you're gonna be?

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,968
Uh, 45 minutes?
Less, if you help with the kids.

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,804
No, 45 minutes is good.

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,930
And this photograph is of me
in high school.

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,765
I'm kidding. A joke. Come on.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,448
Okay, come on. Bath time. Time to scrub
some backs and clean some cracks.

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,042
I miss going out with you
on Saturday nights.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,090
I wanna have a new policy of going out
six nights a week without the kids.

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,920
I think it would be good for us
to go out one night a week...

28
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,209
- ...where it's just you and me. It would be--
- You gotta be kidding.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,488
- What?
- You just checked out that girl's butt.

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,967
- Who did?
- You did. And it's rude.

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,327
- What? Do you think she noticed?
- I noticed.

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,126
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm just spacy tonight, honey, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,089
Hey, guys, come on. We're late.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,163
- Hey.
- Hi.

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,691
- Hey, Rick.
- How you doing?

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,411
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,369
Grace, let me ask you a question.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,921
Does Fred ever check out other women
in front of you?

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,567
No, no. Fred's not a gawker.
He's a good boy. Ha, ha.

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,246
- Hmm.
- Come on, let's go say hi to Dr. Lucy.

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,887
- Let's go get a beer.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,281
- Hey.
- Hi.

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,522
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,250
Our first friend to win an award.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,801
Oh, stop it.
Listen, I don't deserve this thing.

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,281
- Oh. Come on. Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
- Oh, come on.

47
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,250
- The whole thing is just embarrassing.
- Stop it.

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,686
What is this, amateur hour?

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,366
How does your wife catch you
checking out another girl?

50
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,211
She walked by and I glanced back
for like half a second.

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,243
- Two beers, please.
- You got it.

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,206
Hey, Quagmire, you don't wait for the girl
to walk past and glance back at her.

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,729
You spot her from 15 feet away, turn, then
wait for her to walk into your line of vision.

54
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,564
- What do you mean?
- Don't you get it?

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
You can't help if her butt walks
where you're looking.

56
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,522
Where you're looking.
It was your air space.

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,170
- What could you do?
- Exactly.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,526
- Is that an original?
- No.

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,920
- Who?
- Coakley.

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,491
- Coakley? He did.
- Hey, guys.

61
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,801
Hey, Missy.

62
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,008
Drink up, guys.
Let's get this party started.

63
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,207
- Yes.
- Whoo!

64
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,930
- Whoo! Ha, ha.
- Whoo! OW.

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,129
Missy sure is looking chipper for
someone going through a divorce.

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,691
Yeah. God.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,649
You know what I love about divorcÃ©es?

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,926
They love sex.

69
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,650
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,327
- I like to think so, though. Ha, ha.
- You would like to think it was true.

71
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,481
God.

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,325
Look at those meatheads
checking out Missy.

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,801
- Do they think, they're invisible?
- I know.

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,122
Hey, I thought you said Fred
isn't a gawker.

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,965
He was standing right there.
I can't let him know I know.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,367
- it'll take all the fun out of it.
- Ha, ha.

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,490
Oh, God, he has this stupid move
where he looks back...

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,483
...and he waits for the girl to pass...

79
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,610
...so that it seems like he couldn't
help but notice her ass. it's pathetic.

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,770
You wanna hear a great idea?

81
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,208
Why don't you go upstairs
and slip into something uncomfortable...

82
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,169
...while I give the babysitter a ride home?

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,610
I want to, honey. I really do.

84
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,525
It's after midnight
and I gotta get up early with the kids.

85
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,365
No, I'll get up with the kids.
I'll take them to the park.

86
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,808
I'll take them to Finn's birthday party.
You just stay in bed...

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,850
...and play back some of the more
acrobatic highlights...

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,321
...from the show
I'm about to put on for you.

89
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,848
- Mm. Okay. I'm in. Ha, ha.
- Ah.

90
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,690
They're home!

91
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,841
Sorry.

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,771
He couldn't fall asleep.

93
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,689
So how were the little monsters tonight?

94
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,370
Perfect.

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,363
That Gunnar is so cute.

96
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,603
He's like a little monkey.
He just wants to climb all over me.

97
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,167
Hmm.

98
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,206
All right, here we are.

99
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,603
Good night. Thank you.

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,649
Mr. Mills, can I ask you something?

101
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,847
Yeah, shoot.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,206
I was wondering, um ....

103
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,331
Could you buy me some beer?

104
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,561
Buy you some--?

105
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,166
How old are you?

106
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,328
I'll be 21 next week.

107
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,081
- Wow. That's a biggie. Happy birthday.
- Yeah.

108
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,971
So could you?

109
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,686
Well, you know,
the law's pretty clear on this.

110
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,081
I think you can get into a lot of trouble--

111
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,083
Come on, I'm a junior in college.

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,890
You drank when you were in college.

113
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,850
- I ....
- Besides, it's so arbitrary.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,526
How does it make sense that 20's
old enough to vote or watch porn...

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,371
- ...but it's too young to have a beer?
- Really?

116
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,761
Twenty's old enough to, um--?

117
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,605
- Vote?
- No. The other thing.

118
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,604
Watch porn? Yeah. Half the girls
in those things are my age.

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,560
I mean, unless it's that weird fetish stuff
where the women are, like, 40. Ha, ha.

120
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,767
Mm.

121
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,571
Look, I promise,
no one's gonna find out.

122
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,611
Join me down at the river. We'll listen
to some tunes and suck down a few beers.

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,446
Oh ....

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,047
Freeze right there!

125
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,282
You're under arrest for supplying alcohol
to a minor.

126
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,930
Mills, you're fired!

127
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,930
I award your wife the house,
the cars and half your wages.

128
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,363
I don't want you walking me down
the aisle. You cheated on mom!

129
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,961
I don't want you at my civil ceremony.
You cheated!

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,247
Get out.

131
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,967
What?

132
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,251
What I mean is that I'm sorry,
I can't do that.

133
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,807
Why not?

134
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,328
Because it would be inappropriate,
Paige.

135
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,927
What, is that your adult voice?
"That would be inappropriate, Paige."

136
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,963
- Come on, it's for the--
- No, Paige.

137
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,164
What are you thinking?
I'm a married man. I have children.

138
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,483
You think they'd like me at the river
alone drinking with a coed?

139
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,440
I never said alone. My boyfriend
and his roommates are down there.

140
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,246
Okay, you better head inside now.

141
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,129
Good night, Paige.

142
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,481
Ew.

143
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,002
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Okay, scoot along now, Paige.

144
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,048
Oh, thank God, you're still awake.

145
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,403
Quiet. Gunnar just fell asleep.

146
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,131
Okay. Let's tiptoe.

147
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,369
- Be very quiet, but still excited.
- Ha, ha.

148
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,685
- Okay.
- Ha, ha.

149
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,206
I'm scared.

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,330
- Can I sleep with you tonight?
- Aw.

151
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,323
- Daddy?
- No, absolutely not.

152
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,528
Daddy, words hurt, you know.

153
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,250
- Well ....
- Come on, she's scared.

154
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,323
- We can let her--
- What? Are you serious?

155
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,801
Look, this isn't just about her
cock blocking me.

156
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,282
I don't like that my daughter needs
someone to sleep with her every night.

157
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,727
That's not gonna be good
when she goes to college.

158
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,123
Well, can someone
at least read me a story?

159
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,285
Okay, one quick story.

160
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,050
Jump up.

161
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,608
And what is this new expression,
words hurt?

162
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,250
- Where did you get that?
- Mommy.

163
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,447
- Mommy?
- Mm-hm.

164
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,045
Okay, well,
Mommy isn't always right.

165
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,641
You know what my dad had?
A belt. Yeah. Now, that hurt.

166
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,087
"Amazingly, our plan worked.

167
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,529
The gum kept the door from banging, and
we never heard 'Don't slam the door' again.

168
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,727
The end."

169
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,729
- There. You look pretty, Daddy.
- Good.

170
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,084
Okay, that was the last ponytail.
It's time for you to go night-night.

171
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,369
Give me a big hug and a kiss.

172
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,569
Mwah. Mwah.

173
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,720
- I love you, Emma.
- I love you more.

174
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,121
No, I love you more.

175
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,251
Honey? Honey?

176
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,050
Honey?

177
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,201
No. No.

178
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,970
I won. Uh.

179
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,364
Come on.
Let's go to the slides, Gunnar.

180
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,522
Can you believe
all the talent here today?

181
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,727
I know.

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,609
I mean, look at this buffet of ass.

183
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,649
Imagine coming here back
when we were single.

184
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,326
- Ooh. The damage we would do?
- Ha, ha, oh, boy.

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,608
Oh, man. Oh.

186
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,842
- Hey, did you get any action last night?
- Nah.

187
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,691
Came close, but kids were awake
when we got home.

188
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,524
- What about you, you get lucky?
- No.

189
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,920
Well, I mean, kind of.

190
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,481
You know, Grace conked out
right when we got home...

191
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,450
...so I snuck out to the car,
rubbed one out.

192
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,409
What are you, Knight Rider?

193
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,211
Why canât you do it in the bathroom
like every other guy?

194
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,125
What, and get caught by Grace?
No way. I can't risk that. Uh-uh.

195
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,850
No, besides, cars turn me on.

196
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,970
It's where I lost my virginity.

197
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,771
So I go out there, put the seat back,
pump some tunes.

198
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,365
It's pretty nice.

199
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,526
That's one of those things
they don't tell you, huh?

200
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,727
What?

201
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,690
That you're still gonna be jerking off
after you get married.

202
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,810
I mean, I thought that was just gonna be
a teenage thing, right?

203
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,804
Yeah, I didn't see that one coming.

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,331
I gotta get going.

205
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,047
I gotta drop the kids off
at a birthday party.

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,680
Hmm. You wanna
get a coffee afterwards?

207
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,962
Yeah. Guys, come on!

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,809
You all right? You okay?

209
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,325
Yeah.

210
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,642
I tweaked my neck
on the 17th hole yesterday.

211
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,610
I was 250 out.
Had to get over some water. I gave it my all.

212
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,728
- I didn't know you played yesterday.
- Yeah.

213
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,726
Aah.

214
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,804
Yeah, you gotta stretch.
Because even something like foosball...

215
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,681
...I've thrown my back out where
it's, like, the thing where you--

216
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,726
Oh, my God.

217
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,803
- Hey. What can I get you?
- Small coffee.

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,047
Sure.

219
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,329
Please don't have a nice ass.
Please don't have a nice ass.

220
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,723
Please don't have a nice--
Oh, come on, man.

221
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,649
- That is ridiculous.
- I know.

222
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,081
I did some recon. She's from Australia.

223
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,528
- Of course she is. Shit. Don't bring me here.
- She's been here about a month. What?

224
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,883
- Shh. Here she comes, here she comes.
- All right. Thanks.

225
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,887
HEY-
hi.

226
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,442
Uh, iced coffee, one Splenda, right?

227
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,365
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,760
And for your mate?

229
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
Same.

230
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,087
- Two Splendas.
- Okay.

231
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,129
- So pretty.
- Chick. Chick. Chick. Zzz.

232
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,850
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,401
Taking mental photographs
for my spank bank.

234
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,766
Fred, come on, dude. Just--

235
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,884
You need help.

236
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,602
No. She already got us. Thank you.

237
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,325
Wasn't a question.

238
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,970
Kid's right.

239
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,681
- Come on, guys, give it a rest.
- Hey, Ed. I didn't see you standing there.

240
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,922
Because you were eye-banging
the java babe.

241
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,127
- No.
- No.

242
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,123
You're married men. She's half your age.

243
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,442
Maybe a little growing up?
What do you think?

244
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,331
Hey, I guess I'm gonna see you
at the housewarming party next weekend.

245
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,527
Huh?

246
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,489
Yeah, next Saturday afternoon
at the new casa.

247
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,483
We're finally in.
We're having a little soiree.

248
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,687
Hmm.

249
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,320
- Next Saturday-- I think that could be tough.
- Yeah, we're jammed.

250
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,891
Your wives already RSVP'd.

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,128
- Oh. Cool.
- Can't wait.

252
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,089
Till then. Come on, pound the potato.

253
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,641
- Pshh. Ha, ha.
- Uh-oh. Ha, ha.

254
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,325
Pound it.

255
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,966
Pshh.

256
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,770
- Take care, guys.
- Okay.

257
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,410
Bye, Ed.

258
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,767
I'll pound his potato,
you know what I mean?

259
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,366
- He's a good guy.
- He is a nice guy.

260
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,605
- You open, Rick.
- I know.

261
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,604
Okay, uh, I'll say three 9s.

262
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,762
Conservative,
but that's what I'm going for.

263
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,684
Where's Coakley?
Why didn't he show up?

264
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,164
Coakley is in Arizona,
attending the Hawaiian Tropic regionals.

265
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,647
- But of course. But of course.
- Four 9s.

266
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,848
Imagine being Coakley, huh?

267
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,765
That guy's single, he's loaded.
Chicks love him.

268
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,763
He doesn't have to answer to anybody.

269
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,809
- Five 3s.
- Let me ask you something.

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,685
How much would you pay to have your way
with a Hawaiian Tropic girl...

271
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,370
...for a weekend, hmm?

272
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,683
You can have anyone you want.
You know she's not gonna get pregnant.

273
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,882
- No disease.
- Not gonna cry rape.

274
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,725
Never hear from her again.
Your wife will never find out.

275
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,451
How would I know
my wife wouldn't find out?

276
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,721
It's a game.

277
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,486
- I'm just saying if it was possible.
- it's a scenario.

278
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,768
Like I'm a genie
and I can make it happen.

279
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,890
- I can see that. A genie. Yeah. Ha, ha.
- Thank you. Thank you.

280
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,930
I can grant you this wish
and make like it never happened.

281
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,730
Okay. You know what? I'll say it.

282
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,680
I would be willing to pay 250
of your American dollars.

283
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,207
You cheap bastard.

284
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,089
This is an investment, man.

285
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,811
Get your rocks off, right?
Protect your wife's feelings.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,401
- I'm going deep with it. Five grand.
- Oh!

287
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,403
- Five grand?
- Five grand, baby.

288
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,086
And I know Hogwarts right here
would pay more.

289
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,005
- Hey, guys. Hi.
- That's why he wears a tie.

290
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,927
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hey, how's it going?

291
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,321
Hey, do you remember
my brother-in-law, Flats?

292
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,209
- Pleasure.
- Nice to see you again.

293
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,407
- Who's winning?
- Uh-oh.

294
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,568
This guy right here's got all the loot.

295
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,767
- What?
- Ha, ha.

296
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,447
Would you do me a favor and not tell Grace
that I have disposable income?

297
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,443
She'll make me take her shopping...

298
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,329
...or, like, see Kathy Griffin in concert.

299
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,250
- Yeah.
- Okay.

300
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,640
How'd the kids go down?

301
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,088
Gunnar and Emma stalled for a while,
but they weren't too bad.

302
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,369
- What about the baby?
- The baby? Not a peep.

303
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,170
- I've been listening the whole time.
- Oh.

304
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,481
- Yeah.
- All right.

305
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,449
- Well, good night.
- Mwah.

306
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,602
- All right. Have fun.
- Okay.

307
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,286
- What is that? Four 7s. Is that good?
- She's kidding.

308
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,363
- Maybe. Maybe I'm not kidding.
- Ha, ha.

309
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,369
See you later.

310
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,211
Hey, genie, can you make my dick work?

311
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,124
Oh, you poor thing.

312
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,124
Oh, silly Daddy
got the monitors mixed up.

313
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,330
Oh, have you been listening
to those loudmouths ell night?

314
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,562
A question to you, Frederick, sir.

315
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,566
How much would you be willing to spend
for a weekend of erotic pleasures...

316
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,963
- ...with one of the most beautiful women?
- Six grand.

317
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,323
I've gotta have a way to get
the money out of the checking account.

318
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,960
- I assume the genie could help with that?
- Oh. I got you.

319
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,009
- I'll just give you my routing number?
- Ha, ha.

320
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,164
Hey, hey, put me down for 7500.

321
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,722
Hog-Head,
please, man. You don't have $7500.

322
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,325
Hey, be nice.

323
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,687
Okay, Rickster. Ha, ha!

324
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
What is your number?

325
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,289
- Ahh, I don't know.
- Come on. You've gotta have a number.

326
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,323
- I don't know.
- Any girl you choose.

327
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,649
You could do anything you want.
The wife will never find out.

328
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,371
Completely harmless.
One-time thing. What would you pay?

329
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,330
- I honestly don't know.
- Ballpark, please.

330
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,050
Well, I have a great wife...

331
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,811
...so I wouldn't wanna do anything
to hurt her feelings.

332
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,687
So I guess the real question becomes...

333
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,171
...what wouldn't I pay?

334
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,001
That's why this dude 's wearing the hat.

335
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,643
This house has gotta be
worth something, right?

336
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,324
Now, mother-in-laws.
What do they go for on the black market?

337
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,005
Fifty bucks, maybe?

338
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,722
Fred said 6 grand?
Oh, God, what a douche bag.

339
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,282
He won't even spend $60 on An Evening
With Kathy Griffin tickets for me...

340
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,529
...but he's gonna give some
make-believe genie 6 G's'?

341
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,364
- Wanna near something funnier?
- Yeah.

342
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,602
Hog-Head McCormick said 7500.

343
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,125
- Wow.
- What?

344
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,767
Look, I mean, on the bright side,
they're not cheating on us, right?

345
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,048
- Although that'd be kind of fun to watch.
- Ha, ha.

346
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,004
I'd love to see the look
on the girl's face...

347
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,646
...when she wakes up next to Fred
with his sleep apnea mask on.

348
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,883
Are you kidding?
He wears one of those things...

349
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,208
- ...with the mask and the tube?
- Yeah, it's awful.

350
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,600
That is attractive.

351
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,808
Every time I wake up,
I think a plane's going down.

352
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,082
You know, sometimes I wonder
if it wouldn't be better if they did cheat.

353
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,287
Just got it over with.

354
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,411
You mean rather than take
the slow boat to resentment?

355
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,926
I'm just saying, maybe a little freedom
would be good for them, and for you.

356
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,287
Have you ever considered giving
him a hall pass?

357
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,245
- A what?
- A hall pass. A week off from marriage.

358
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,487
- No.
- Heh.

359
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,769
Wait a minute. Are you saying
let them go out and cheat?

360
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,048
I'm saying, give them a week off
from marriage.

361
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,284
Look, most married men have very
foggy memories of their single days...

362
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,364
...and they begin to believe
that if not for you...

363
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,409
...they could be with these other women.

364
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,641
That's Fred.

365
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,531
I mean, he thinks
because he sees big tits all day long...

366
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,365
...and he manages to make it home
without squeezing one...

367
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,330
...that I should be greeting him
at the door like some hero.

368
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,802
Maybe it's time to let them
go out there and find out what it's like.

369
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,406
- Huh?
- it's called the reactance theory.

370
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,967
It's a principle in psychology
which says...

371
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,283
...that if you constantly tell someone
they can't do something...

372
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,369
...they just want to do it
more than ever.

373
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,490
Conversely, if you remove the taboo,
you remove the obsession.

374
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,404
You know what? I have an idea, doc.

375
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,565
Why don' t you let your husband have a
hall pass and let us know how it turns out?

376
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
Oh, I have.

377
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,851
Are you telling us you let Charlie
sleep with another woman?

378
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,090
I'm not telling you that. I gave him
the freedom to choose for himself.

379
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,840
And?

380
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,810
All I know is our marriage
is better than ever.

381
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,484
All right.

382
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,931
Here, I'll get it. I'll get it, watch.
Watch, watch, watch.

383
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,484
- Oh, wow, look at this place.
- Pretty good, huh?

384
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,208
- Hey.
- There he is, the lord of the manor.

385
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,204
You see the Prius? We're going green.

386
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,521
I can see that.

387
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,045
Everybody in the shack!

388
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,362
- The grand tour's about to begin!
- Come on!

389
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,120
I call it headquarters.

390
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,205
And behind that wall, the war room.
A 300-square-foot humidor.

391
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,331
The humidity in there never gets above
71 percent and never below 70.

392
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,007
Oh! Unbelievable.
How does he come up with this stuff, huh?

393
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,561
Aw, thank you, Mandy.
I threw in a backup generator...

394
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,724
...in case we lose power
and the main genny doesn't kick in.

395
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,325
It's absolutely epic, Ed.

396
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,931
Who wants a Cubano, huh?

397
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,687
Oh, wait a second, Eddie.
First I want to show them my headquarters.

398
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,410
- Come, come.
- Everybody upstairs.

399
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,722
Hey, Larry, I'll get you a cigar. Come on.

400
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,208
I canât stand these look-at-how-much-I-own
parties. They're obnoxious.

401
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,365
When I got my fully loaded Honda Odyssey,
I didn't go around bragging about it, did I?

402
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,967
Well, kind of. You made me drive
around town for two hours, remember?

403
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,851
Well, I thought you'd like
to watch a movie in a minivan.

404
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,731
- You never watched a movie in a minivan.
- No.

405
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,008
But did you have
to hook your boat up to it?

406
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,606
Yeah. Yeah. it's a touring edition, dick.

407
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,603
Fridge, Sub-Zero.

408
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,685
The floors are French limestone
and the counter tops are Brazilian granite.

409
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,080
It's my paradise.

410
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,847
With a price tag north of 240 large,
it better be paradise.

411
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,207
See, this is why the terrorists hate us.

412
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,449
Oh. I love Brazilian granite.
How come I don't have Brazilian granite?

413
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,242
If you recall, we had to make a couple of
fairly substantial expenditures. Remember?

414
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,645
Hey, gang, check this out.

415
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,010
Oh. Honey, don't show them that.
They're gonna think we're wackos.

416
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,970
Sweetie, don't keep me down.

417
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,605
- What the hell is this?
- Get in here, you're gonna love this.

418
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,928
Hey, where are the guys?

419
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,649
Wow. This is like secret-agent stuff.

420
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,802
I think a safe room is a bit over-the-top.

421
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,486
Ed thought with the little ones
you can never be too cautious.

422
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,563
Oh. You're such a good daddy.

423
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,210
No, I disagree.

424
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,323
Here comes Tweedledee
and Tweedledum.

425
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,881
Who gets a minivan
when they don't have any kids?

426
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,483
Wow, man. You just don't understand
the insurance game, do you, Rick?

427
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,644
- Ah, enlighten me.
- When you pull into a person's driveway...

428
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,644
...to sell them insurance,
who do you think they'd rather see?

429
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,201
Some knucklehead hotshot
in a convertible Sebring...

430
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,044
...or a family man in a minivan?

431
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,168
Where is everybody? Hello?

432
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,927
- Guys, we're in here!
- They can't hear you.

433
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,241
Room's soundproof.

434
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,121
And bulletproof. Also, Curt Schilling's
been in here, because I know him.

435
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,767
Hmm.

436
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,766
I guess they must've gone upstairs.

437
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,126
Look at this fucking thing.

438
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,281
- I feel bad for Ed Jr.
- Mm-hm.

439
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,687
It's one thing if you wanna look
like Admiral Dipshit...

440
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,650
...but then you gotta do it to your kid?
Look at that little:

441
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,847
it's awful.

442
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,848
Got him, like,
looking like Thurston Howell too. "Eh ...."

443
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,731
Thanks for coming
to the war room, old chap.

444
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,044
By the way, did I mention that my wife's
vagina never goes above 71% humidity?

445
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,328
- Um, maybe we should turn this off.
- Not a chance.

446
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,370
What happens
if you lose power during a blow...

447
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,204
...and your main generator drops out?

448
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,569
That's why we had the backup
genny installed in Britney's rumpus.

449
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,649
- Here we go.
- Ah, good show.

450
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,290
- In the rumpus?
- Right inside.

451
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,363
And there 's room in there with the stick?

452
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,289
We had to rotate the stick a little.

453
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,011
But then it gives you a little room
to get it up there!

454
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,766
Absolutely.
Can wedge anything in that ass.

455
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,366
Ha-ha-ha. Your English accent's great!

456
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,806
Thank you.

457
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,041
Speaking of installations...

458
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,641
...what about the shiny new set of cans
on Mandy?

459
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,881
- Oh ....
- Oh, yeah.

460
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,884
Either that or she's buying her T-shirts
at Baby Gap.

461
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,209
- I don't get the whole fake-boob thing.
- What don't you get?

462
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,250
I like my bongos with a little mileage
on them, like Britney's.

463
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,602
Britney's?
No way, those are like Baja miles.

464
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
I like being able to get in there
and smoosh them...

465
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,324
...hump them, Stretch Armstrong,
just bibbety-bap them all around.

466
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,527
Okay. All right.

467
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,166
But what about the correlation
between floppy boobs...

468
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,606
...and large-mouth vaginae?

469
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,807
Okay.

470
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,043
You look down there, it's like,
"Hey, I'm Billy Big-mouth Vagina."

471
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,441
Home, home on the range

472
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,604
Where the big-mouth vaginae
Feel strange

473
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,922
- Where nothing is good
- Shh, shh, shh.

474
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,602
And it can't Ht your wood

475
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,847
You know what I mean.

476
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,570
Oh, relax. Come on, they can't hear us.

477
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,648
You people are horrible! Horrible!

478
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,928
Very disappointed, gentlemen.
Very disappointed.

479
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,609
Hey, anyone thinking chocolate-chip
cookie dough in a waffle cone?

480
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,445
Large-mouth vaginae?

481
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,491
You thought that was funny?

482
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,087
No.

483
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,925
Really? You were laughing like a hyena
when he said it.

484
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,641
Well, I was embarrassed for Fred,
to be honest. It was uncomfortable.

485
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,484
What the hell is wrong with you two?

486
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,847
You are completely obsessed with sex.

487
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,970
Honey, obsessed is a very strong word.

488
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,881
Oh, yeah? This morning you left the
computer on Cock Gobblers.Corn.

489
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,169
I get my weather from that site.

490
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,604
You know what really bothers me?

491
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,010
This thing that you're all so obsessed with
is completely meaningless to you.

492
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,323
Rick, you canât even tell me the month
that you lost your virginity.

493
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,245
I can tell you the exact day and hour
that I lost mine.

494
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,169
Well, honey, virginity's different for guys.

495
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,006
The point is, I like sex too.
It means something to me.

496
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,369
But that doesn't mean that I'm out
gawking at every guy I see.

497
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,490
Okay, so I occasionally notice
other women. I'm sorry.

498
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,687
Occasionally?

499
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,764
Driving in a car with you is like being
with a horny bobblehead.

500
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,447
I notice women. I notice all women.
I do. And you wanna know why?

501
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,047
- it's because of the way guys are wired.
- Oh, come on. Give me a break.

502
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,328
It's true. it's just the way it is.

503
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,326
It's not the way you think. it's more
like a curse. it's something you can't help.

504
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,042
I thought when we got married that it would
stop, but it doesn't. it's just-- it's there.

505
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,964
I'm giving you a hall pass.

506
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,566
- A what?
- One week off from marriage.

507
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,051
What, like a trial separation?
You are seriously overreacting.

508
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,363
No, it's not a separation, it's a hall pass.

509
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,046
You can do whatever you want.
Get it out of your system.

510
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,884
Wait a second, are you for real?

511
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,281
Rick, this isn't something that I just ....

512
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,520
I think that you need this.
I think we need this.

513
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,364
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

514
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,046
It's not a yes-or-no offer,
and it's not a debate.

515
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,443
Tomorrow morning I'm taking the kids
to my parents' Cape house.

516
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,364
We'll be back next Sunday.

517
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,727
Oh, great. So, what am I supposed to do?

518
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,285
Whatever you want.

519
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,286
As far as I'm concerned,
you have the week off from marriage.

520
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,645
They've just added this porch.

521
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,485
There's also a jogging path
right by the river.

522
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,211
But also, what they've just put in
is a new bike trail--

523
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,847
- Hello.
- Hey. Oh. What are you doing here?

524
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,368
I called the office, they said you
were in the neighborhood. Nice place.

525
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,729
This is my friend Fred. Fred,
say hello to Harold and Marcy Goldberg.

526
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,680
- They're just moving up from Long Island.
- Oh, mazeltov, folks. How are you?

527
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,526
Let me give you a card.
If you need any home, auto, life insurance.

528
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,968
- Kind of the go-to mensch here in town.
- We're okay with insurance.

529
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,203
That's what they all say until they
drop dead. Let me give you one.

530
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,011
I don't think anyone's gonna drop dead.
But thanks, Fred.

531
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,730
If you wanna take another look...

532
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,486
...I'll be waiting right here
to answer any questions.

533
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,604
- Thanks. Yeah.
- Ha, ha.

534
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,525
What are you doing, man?
The mazeltov? Give me a break.

535
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,650
- Sorry. You weren't answering your phone.
- No. I'm working.

536
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,451
I just wanna see what
trouble you got into last night.

537
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,364
- You know what Grace made me do?
- What?

538
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,330
She drove me there to apologize.
Did Maggie give you grief...

539
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,686
...when you got back home?

540
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,171
- Kind of.
- Yeah?

541
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,051
What happened?

542
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,407
She gave me a hall pass.

543
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,800
A what?

544
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,571
It's like a week off from marriage.

545
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,609
Heh, heh. Yeah, right.

546
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,121
- I'm serious.
- Fuck you.

547
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,327
It's true.

548
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,530
She's taking the kids and going up to
her parents' beach house till next Sunday.

549
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,850
Wait, I don't get it. What--? Why aren't you
buying ticker tape for the parade?

550
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,480
- I don't know how I feel about it.
- Feel about what?

551
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,611
The hall pass. I don't-- just--
Something doesn't seem quite right.

552
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,331
You think Maggie might have
a brain tumor or something?

553
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,485
No, no. it's like, just because
your wife says it's okay to cheat, is it?

554
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,926
There's a part of me that's like:

555
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,169
"Wow. You must've really pushed her
to get her to this point."

556
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,961
Is that good for a marriage, that she's
willing to try something this insane?

557
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,361
Absolutely. Come on.

558
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,366
Doesn't it ever bother you that all of our
wives' dreams come true and ours don't?

559
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,681
Look at Maggie, all right?

560
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,121
She used to play house.
You bought her a house.

561
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,443
She used to play with a Easy-Bake Oven.
You bought her a Viking.

562
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,847
She wanted to be a mommy,
you made her a mommy.

563
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,126
- GE.
- What GE?

564
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,361
The oven's a GE.

565
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,642
It doesn't matter,
you're not trying to sell.

566
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,771
Look at you, you're not living your dreams.
I don't see you hosting Wheel of Fortune.

567
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,561
Your wife is living her dreams, and now
this woman, this saint of a woman...

568
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,485
...she's giving you the opportunity
to live yours.

569
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,089
Now you watch, this thing's gonna
end up biting Maggie in the ass.

570
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,528
And I gotta admit, I lost a little respect
for Rick for accepting it.

571
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,409
- Well, it wasn't really his choice.
- Mm-hm.

572
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,130
This is really her call, Fred.

573
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,806
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point.

574
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,564
- You know what, maybe you're right.
- Huh.

575
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,967
Maybe this is the progressive,
cool thing to do.

576
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,691
Yeah, that's not what I was saying.
I said--

577
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,362
You are not getting a hall pass.
So you can cut the bullshit.

578
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,721
What?

579
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,043
Why would I need a hall pass, huh?
I got you!

580
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,568
Well, not tonight, you don't.
I'm bloated and I have cramps.

581
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,287
Ah, shit. I forgot to take out the trash.

582
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,648
Tonight's the night we'll make history

583
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,450
Honey, you and I

584
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,161
'Cause I 'll take any risk

585
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,481
To tie back the hands of time

586
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,125
And stay with you here tonight

587
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,286
I know you feel these are the worst of times

588
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,361
I do believe it's true

589
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,204
But I know
If the world just passed us by

590
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,601
Baby, I know

591
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,129
I wouldn't have the time

592
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,044
No, no

593
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,489
The best of times

594
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,886
Okay, ma'am.
If you say he's yours, you can have him.

595
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,804
Thank you, officer.

596
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,282
- Is he going to jail?
- Thank you so much.

597
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,240
What kind of sick prick
jerks off in his front yard?!

598
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,081
I got a hall pass.

599
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,690
What? How?

600
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,684
Well, it doesn't matter how. I got one.

601
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,842
Can you believe it? I got a hall pass.

602
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,525
When does yours begin?

603
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,330
Uh, 24 minutes ago.

604
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,687
Yeah, she's gonna go join Maggie
up at the Cape.

605
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,366
It's just you and me, buddy,
for the next 6 days. Ha, ha.

606
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,524
You realize how much easier this is,
having a hall-pass partner?

607
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,841
Yeah. Tell me about it.

608
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,571
It's not just me.
it's gonna be Gary, Hog-Head, Flats.

609
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,330
They're all coming out with us.

610
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,721
Are you joking?
Those guys got hall passes?

611
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,611
- No, no, no. They just wanna watch.
- Yeah. Watch what?

612
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,730
Watch us reel in the babes. Ha, ha.

613
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,327
That's good, that's good. You remember
how we dominated in JV basketball?

614
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,567
Yeah, senior year.

615
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,520
But that one game where we had a couple
fans in the stands, we played even better.

616
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,889
- We're a couple of show ponies, aren't we?
- Yeah, we came alive!

617
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,566
We gotta get out of here,
we're burning daylight.

618
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,210
- Let me log out.
- You log out.

619
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,409
- I'm gonna try to bang your receptionist.
- No, no, no! Fred. Fred.

620
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,005
Let's keep the office clean.

621
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,003
Wait till we hit the streets.

622
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,810
Class act.

623
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,208
What is taking this dude so long?

624
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,567
Just be patient. He'll come.

625
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,249
Wait, okay, I see some movement.

626
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,209
- I don't see anything.
- Yeah, upstairs window.

627
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,408
Oh. Here he comes.

628
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,648
- What the hell is he doing?
- Uh-oh.

629
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,920
- Shit!
- He's up. He's up.

630
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,286
You okay?

631
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,323
Come on, come on.

632
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,490
Get in here, Rapunzel.

633
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,371
- What the hell took you so long?
- I couldn't find my umbrella.

634
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,090
Why do you need an umbrella?

635
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,766
Apparently there's a forty percent chance
of a light drizzle.

636
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,122
Come on, come on.
Let the mayhem commence.

637
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,884
Hit it.

638
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,600
This place is dead.

639
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,970
Okay, well, the guy at the Comfy Nite Inn
said it doesn't really kick in till about 9:30.

640
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,167
All right.

641
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,322
Why are you guys staying at a hotel?

642
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,610
Well, come on, Flats, I can't very well
bring a bunch of models back to my place.

643
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,529
What if they end up stalking me?

644
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,087
And Rick's house
has got a bunch of family photos...

645
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,447
...and kids' drawings on the fridge,
you know?

646
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,849
It ain't exactly an aphrodisiac for babes.

647
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,206
Doesn't make boners.

648
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,563
Hey, hey, talking of babes,
which one have you got your eyes on?

649
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,722
- Come on, who are you gonna bone first?
- Uh ....

650
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,124
Hey, hey, hey. What about those two?
Why don't you go bang them?

651
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,403
Or maybe the hostess. Someone
should definitely jump her bones.

652
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,244
Guys, attempt to be cool.

653
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,323
You know, we've got
the whole week, so ....

654
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,244
We'll get there, we'll get there.

655
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,563
Are you guys sure Applebee's is the best
place to meet horny women?

656
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,722
What are you thinking, Olive Garden?

657
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,048
What do you want,
hot pussy or breadsticks?

658
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,407
Wait a second, wait. Where's Coakley?

659
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,086
- That's where we should be.
- Yeah. He's in Iceland.

660
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,651
Why? What's he doing there?

661
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,009
What do you think? Iceland has
the most beautiful women in the world.

662
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,400
Yeah. Bjork.

663
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,604
Okay, look. I'm taking the bull
by the horns right now, okay?

664
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,849
You guys want beautiful women, right?

665
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,889
I know a place that got ass on tap!

666
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,123
Okay? And it's not Applebee's.
And it's not Olive Garden.

667
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,367
Let's roll, baby.

668
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,330
- Follow me, fellas, for some ass.
- Good. Okay. I like it.

669
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,211
A man with an plan.
Okay. Where we going?

670
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,486
Chili'S.

671
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,880
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

672
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,845
Before we go bagging chicks,
I need a hunk of beef inside me.

673
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,805
You're not gonna get a better
hunk of beef than you get here.

674
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,161
That's true. That's true.

675
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,403
Look, we got a long night ahead of us.
Why don't we go fuel up?

676
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,201
Okay, where to now?

677
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,371
- Rick?
- Hmm?

678
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,449
- Answer Flats.
- What's the question?

679
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,723
What the hell are we doing for the rest
of the night?

680
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,450
- We're gonna get laid, right?
- Yeah.

681
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,443
Is that the plan? Yeah.

682
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,611
I gotta go home and poo.

683
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,764
Now?

684
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,410
Why don't you just back one out here?

685
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,245
Ooh, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need
a bath afterwards.

686
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,483
Come on, guys! All right, listen,
I say we go to a titty bar, yeah?

687
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,450
Where there's tits, and we look at them,
and we smoke cigars.

688
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,047
- That'll put a bit of lead back in the pencil.
- I got a better idea.

689
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,409
I say we, uh, tie a bow on it
and put her to bed.

690
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,609
It's gonna be a long week.
I think we need to pace ourselves.

691
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,928
What? it's only 9:15.

692
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,448
Mm. No, I'm with Rico. Freddie tie-tie.

693
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,687
Oh, come on!

694
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,923
Guys, guys, relax. This is just the calm
before the storm.

695
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,802
That's right, that's right. Tonight we build
up some strength, and then tomorrow, pfft...

696
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,650
...make landfall.

697
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,011
This resort sure beats the hell
out of the Comfy Nite Inn.

698
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,487
- Why aren't you guys staying here?
- Too pricey.

699
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,850
Besides, if you pay for golf you get full
access to the resort, including the pool bar.

700
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,769
- Oh!
- Not bad, yeah?

701
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,804
Mothers, lock up your daughters.
The dogs are off the leash.

702
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,042
Gentlemen, look what I got here.

703
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,201
What are those?

704
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,885
Oh, just some brownies...

705
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,530
- ...of the pot variety.
- Whoa.

706
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,609
- What?
- We're not on spring break.

707
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,445
- Where'd you get those?
- From the guy who cleans my office.

708
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,881
- Come on, who's in?
- Ehh. Ahh ....

709
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,850
No.

710
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,610
Come on, you squares.

711
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,569
It's not the same as when you smoke it.

712
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,406
When you eat it, it's a much more mellow
buzz. Makes you feel sort of relaxed.

713
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,722
- Are they chocolatey?
- Yeah.

714
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,929
You know what, Rick?
This is spring break.

715
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,724
You guys got a hall pass.

716
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,245
You need to live it up.

717
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,721
Might help your rap with the ladies at
the pool later.

718
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,089
- Ha, ha. Correct.
- You don't even have a hall pass.

719
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,322
So? I can live vicariously
through you guys.

720
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,324
It's not vicarious if you're
actually doing it, Hog-Head.

721
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,642
Get off my back.
I'm just trying to enjoy a pastry here.

722
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,087
Oh, what the hell.

723
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,891
It's not like my game
could get any worse.

724
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,890
- Come on.
- Do it.

725
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,850
- All right, give me one of those things.
- Hee-hee.

726
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,366
It's a bit naughty.

727
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,685
Hurry up!

728
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,161
What kind of soap do you use?

729
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,369
- In the shower?
- Yeah.

730
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,170
Whats the matter with you?

731
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,049
- Dove.
- I like Dove.

732
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,371
I like it, it doesn't dry your skin out
so much.

733
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,966
- Play through!
- Play through.

734
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,845
Feel this.

735
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,763
- That is so soft.
- Yeah.

736
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,890
Golly, that is soft.
Hey, Hog-Head, come here, man.

737
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,407
You gotta feel Rick's skin,
feel how soft it is.

738
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,046
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hog-Ass, you okay?

739
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,085
What the hell is he doing?

740
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,130
He's got back spasms.

741
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,290
- Not him. Him.
- No, they were delicious.

742
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,922
- Think your mother would give the recipe?
- Gary! What are you doing?

743
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,011
I'm talking to the guy
who cleans my office!

744
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,123
He says we took way too much!

745
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,011
We're only supposed to eat,
like, a quarter of a brownie each!

746
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,801
What?

747
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,324
Look, this is the third time I've had to flag
your group, and you're on the 4th hole.

748
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,520
Now, if I have to come out here again,
you're done.

749
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,324
- Sorry, we're gonna pick it up.
- Ha, ha.

750
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,686
I'll see you, Jorge.

751
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,323
Where was the last place you saw it?

752
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,445
On one of the fairways. I grabbed e club,
took e swing, looked around, gone.

753
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,726
- Vanished?
- Yes.

754
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,166
Dude, where's my golf cart?

755
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,850
- Not funny.
- Fred, knock it off.

756
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,809
Hey, guys, I need to take a poo.

757
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,200
Give us a second here.

758
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,771
I think it's been stolen.

759
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,207
- Who's gonna steal a golf cart?
- Criminals.

760
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,569
- It's probably jacked up on bricks now.
- Gary, you're being paranoid.

761
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,008
- I'll tell you this. I do remember this.
- What's up with this shit?

762
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,527
I saw it on the 11th tee.
That's the last I saw it.

763
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,648
- We're on the sixth hole.
- They're cutting.

764
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,126
Did we skip five holes?

765
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,691
Shit, where are my kids?

766
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,530
Anybody have any napkins?

767
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,531
Come on, man!

768
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,525
We're getting cut on
by the Joy Luck Club.

769
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,561
Nobody cares about this?

770
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,563
- Is that the marshal?
- Should we say something?

771
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,649
Cops! Run for it! Cutters!

772
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,241
Whoa. Oh ....

773
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,721
- Speed up, speed up!
- I can't! I've got it floored!

774
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,491
Well, cut through the woods!

775
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,563
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

776
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,370
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

777
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,921
- Go! Go! Go!
- Come on!

778
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,924
Go, go, go!

779
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,842
Ed. Britney.

780
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,843
Clones.

781
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,730
- Strike!
- Hey, ump! You're missing a hell of a game!

782
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,888
Let's go. Come on, batter up. Let's go.

783
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,649
Little hit. Little hit. Let's go, Gerry.

784
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,601
Go, go, go!

785
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,770
Safe!

786
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,964
I don't know how you can be so calm...

787
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,726
...knowing our husbands are out
chasing tail all over town.

788
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,803
Shh, keep it down.

789
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,883
Relax. Here's how I see it:

790
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,203
Rick and Fred are like a couple of
domesticated cats scratching at the door.

791
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,647
- Ha, ha.
- The first time you let them out...

792
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,844
...they are so paralyzed with fear
they bolt back into the house.

793
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,884
Okay, but we're not talking about
cats here. We are talking about dogs.

794
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,003
Ha, ha. Well, what choice do we have?

795
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,448
I don't know. I mean, why couldn't we
just keep the status quo?

796
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,524
Were things that bad that we have
to do something this extreme?

797
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,250
For me they were.

798
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,802
Remember when we went
to Lucy's award thing?

799
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,486
- Yeah.
- Well, that night Rick and I were gonna...

800
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,761
- ...you know.
- Yeah.

801
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,561
I started wondering, who is he gonna
be thinking about when we're having sex?

802
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,121
Is it gonna be that girl
that he checked out...

803
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,523
...or is it gonna be somebody
he met that day or Missy Frankinopoulos?

804
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,163
Gr some Frankinopoulos monster where he
combines his favorite parts of all of them?

805
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,840
- So when he came into the room ....
- What?

806
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,480
I pretended to be asleep.

807
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,446
You're kidding. You don't--
You've never done that before?

808
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,840
I do that all the time.

809
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,644
- Really?
- Yes.

810
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,327
I think it's our job as women that
between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m...

811
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,845
...we just fake everything.

812
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,446
- Ha, ha. Well, I don't know. I--
- Hey.

813
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,721
I'm Gerry.
Thanks for coming out to support us.

814
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,848
Yeah. That was so much fun.

815
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,843
- Go Falmouth. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

816
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,047
Thanks.

817
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,647
So we saw you guys sitting up there with
those kids. Are you nannies or something?

818
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,403
No. Those are my kids.

819
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,641
They're her kids.

820
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,325
I'm not old enough to have kids.

821
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,210
Come on. Guys, come on, let's go.
Let's pick it up.

822
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,850
- What am I, your slave?
- See you.

823
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,685
Pick up your own balls and bats!
Move your ass!

824
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,569
- Thank you, Eddie.
- Ha, ha. Hey, Dad.

825
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,563
Maggie, Grace.
Rick Coleman, my golf buddy.

826
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,688
- He's the coach.
- Hey. Hi.

827
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,003
Hope those clowns
weren't bothering you.

828
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,403
- Oh, no, they were sweet.
- Yeah. No, no. Those were cute kids.

829
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,564
We're going to the players' digs for
beer and brats. Join us?

830
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,209
- Yeah.
- No. We have to get the kids home.

831
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,409
Go. Go have some fun.
You haven't been out all week.

832
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,410
Your mother and I have the kids.
We've got Paige. No problem.

833
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,002
- I don't know. We weren't planning on--
- Come on. it's gonna be fun.

834
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,084
We're gonna have a belly-flop contest
in the pool. You all can be judges.

835
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,605
- Ha, ha. Uh--
- We're in.

836
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,570
Great. Let me clean up
and you can follow me over.

837
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,929
- Great.
- I'll go round up the kids.

838
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,765
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

839
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,284
Those guys are still in college.
And in case you forgot, we're married.

840
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,240
Uh, to who? Because you know what?
The last that I checked...

841
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,846
...Rick and Fred had the week off
from marriage...

842
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,083
...so remind me again,
who are we married to?

843
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,651
Well, I guess one beer won't kill us.

844
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,370
Now, that's my girl.

845
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,967
Come on, why can't we have some fun?
God knows our guys are living it up.

846
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,204
What would you rather?
Make out with a guy or let him blow you?

847
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,569
And you gotta pick one or your
whole family will die. That's the rule.

848
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,131
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

849
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,448
- How long would you have to make out?
- Ten minutes.

850
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,125
- Tongue?
- Of course.

851
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,049
How long would you have to
let him blow you?

852
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,651
- Seven minutes.
- Seven?

853
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,131
Couldn't last seven minutes.

854
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,126
This is tricky because, obviously, getting
a blow job from a guy, you know, is bad...

855
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,805
- ...but I don't know.
- Oh.

856
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,611
Making out with him
is just so intimate, isn't it?

857
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,127
What does he do for a living,
just out of interest?

858
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,122
Okay, look. This is some bullshit, okay?
I'm out of here, man.

859
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,682
I wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks,
not talk about dicks.

860
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,528
Whoa. Greased Lightning, take your foot
off the gas. These things take time.

861
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,446
Nah, Flats is right. This is day three.
You guys haven't even talked to a girl.

862
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,807
That's not true.
Thanks to Gary's brownies...

863
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,282
...I was talking to Judy on the drug hotline
most of last night.

864
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,683
I'm gonna get going as well, guys.
See you later.

865
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,282
Guys, it's all right if you strike out.

866
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,126
For God's sakes,
at least take a couple of swings.

867
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,765
Maybe we should just call the girls,
ask them to come home.

868
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,809
Wait a second, you wanna quit?

869
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,364
Fred, come on. We're not the same guys
we were 15 years ago when we were single.

870
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,607
We've changed.

871
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,043
No. No, you've changed.
All you're thinking about is yourself.

872
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,964
I don't care. I'm exhausted.
I wanna go home.

873
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,204
- I miss my wife and kids, okay?
- No.

874
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,042
No, no, no.
Let me explain something to you, okay?

875
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,323
If Maggie and Grace find out that we
can't get laid on our own...

876
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,051
...they'll start thinking that we need
them to get laid.

877
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,170
Do you realize what that'll do to the
balance of power in our homes? Do you?

878
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,084
Ahh. Yeah.

879
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,402
Maybe we just say that we did hook up.

880
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,848
I can't. Grace will know I'm lying.
She always knows when I'm lying.

881
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,331
And she doesn't forget.

882
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,927
I once got caught giving her fake chow
and I didn't hear the end of it for years.

883
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,845
- What's fake chow?
- When you're going south on them...

884
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,924
...and don't wanna use your tongue,
so you use fingers and smack your lips.

885
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,442
- Fake chow.
- Gotcha.

886
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,089
- What if we hit a massage parlor?
- No way. That is giving up.

887
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,605
You don't get it, do you?

888
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,003
If we can't show something positive
can come from having a hall pass...

889
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,889
...then the whole concept is dead.

890
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,566
Not just for you and me,
but for all mankind.

891
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,289
Okay, let's get out of here.
I know exactly where we should be.

892
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,521
Not tonight, fellas.

893
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,727
But there is an oldies bar
up on Mineral Spring Avenue.

894
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,161
- Check that out.
- Ha, ha. Thanks for the tip, Twilight.

895
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,324
No, no, no. Come on.
Look, let's out through the B.S. okay?

896
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,767
I know you got a tough job. I can relate.

897
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,524
When I was in college
I was right where you are.

898
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,404
Sorry, but if I let you in
I'm gonna lose my job.

899
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,763
Come on.
You're not gonna lose your job.

900
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,809
Here's 50 bucks, okay?

901
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,928
Why don't you see what you can do.

902
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,690
Ah, ah, ah.

903
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,289
Sorry about that, big man.

904
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,807
My fault. I went against my gut.

905
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,004
Oh, yeah, about that.

906
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,288
We don't mean to question
your betting process...

907
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,762
...but we were only in there for two minutes
before your boss went ballistic.

908
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,890
- So we were wondering if--
- Can I get my 50 bucks back?

909
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,161
You fucking kidding me?

910
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,930
Whoo!

911
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,649
How about you, Rick?
You have any kids?

912
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,131
I really don't like kids.

913
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,887
They're too needy. Plus, it's usually smart
to get married if you're gonna have kids...

914
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,486
...and women only like me
for three months at a time.

915
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,484
That's what you get.
That's what you get.

916
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,166
How about you?
How long have you been off the market?

917
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,926
- Over 20 years if you include dating.
- Whoa.

918
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,646
We started going out when I was a freshmen
in college.

919
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,531
- And where is he?
- He's ....

920
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,170
He's back in Providence.

921
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,490
Poor guy. All work and no play.

922
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,809
Yeah. Something like that.

923
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,725
Here we go.

924
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,009
Hey, what's with the helmet?

925
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,004
Oh, chicks dig motorcycles. Come on.

926
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,170
Hi, everybody.

927
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,089
This is Stella Bass Band.

928
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,842
We're here to tighten it up for you.

929
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,687
First we want Willie to tighten it up.

930
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,841
What's that?

931
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,045
I went online earlier this afternoon, got a
few pick-up lines to get the ball rolling.

932
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,966
"You must be from Ireland because
when I look at you my penis is Dublin."

933
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,524
You know what? I don't think
we need any phony pick-up lines.

934
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,882
I think we can just be our natural selves.

935
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,202
- Great, yeah. If you know how to.
- Oh, yeah.

936
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,249
- Give me the helmet.
- Mm-hm.

937
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,246
And right now,
there's a lot of people without jobs.

938
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,681
So, you know, just suck it up.
This is gonna--

939
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,724
Hello.

940
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,961
- Hello.
- Hi.

941
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,607
Hola.

942
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,720
Wow. This is awkward. I feel like I'm at
my first junior-high mixer. You know?

943
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,327
- When you don't know what to say.
- Ha, ha.

944
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,051
Um, so are you women
from Ireland perchance?

945
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,850
- No.
- Really?

946
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,082
Oh. I'm very surprised
to hear that news...

947
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,165
...because when I look at you,
my wiener doubles in size.

948
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,082
Oh, no, no, no.
He means that his penis is Dublin.

949
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,685
Like the city in Ireland.

950
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,887
It's doubling.

951
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,408
Do you know how much
a polar bear weighs?

952
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,641
No, how much?

953
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,689
Enough to break the ice.
Hi, Fred Searing.

954
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,729
Would you like to try the Australian kiss?

955
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,121
It's like the French kiss
except down under.

956
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,563
Excuse me? Do you think these bar
napkins smell like chloroform?

957
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,121
I'm kidding. Fred Searing.
Can I buy you a drink?

958
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,643
I feel like donkey-kicking everyone
in this bar. This is unbelievable.

959
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,686
Hey. Hey, hey, keep your chin up, okay?
No one said this was gonna be easy.

960
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,491
Even in college it took 50 rejections
for every one score.

961
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,727
Yeah, yeah.

962
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,451
Of course, it didn't sting as much
when you were drunk.

963
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,171
That's what we should do, then.
We should get drunk.

964
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,163
- You're right, we're too stiff.
- I know.

965
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,124
Let's get the creative juices flowing.

966
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,924
Let the soul come to the surface.

967
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,923
That's when we're at our most charming.

968
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,969
You say no to me?

969
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,489
You say no to me? No, no, no.
Flip it!

970
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,324
I say no to you!

971
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,484
- Come on, let's go, baby. it's time to go.
- Oh, screw you!

972
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,211
Look, hey,
you think your shit don't float?

973
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,161
Let me tell you something. I wouldn't
titty-bang any of you in a snowstorm.

974
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,322
- Come on, please?
- No!

975
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,562
- You had your shot and you blew it!
- Come on.

976
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,127
- Goodbye!
- You are the man tonight.

977
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,966
Oh, hey! Betsy Ross!
You need a pole for that flag?

978
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,011
Aw, what's the matter?
You can't get any bigger, you little bitch?

979
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,331
Hey, hon, it's me again. Just checking in.
Hope you and the kids are having fun.

980
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,361
And tell them that I'll call them at bedtime.
Okay, miss you guys.

981
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,481
- I actually didn't order any dessert.
- Yeah, I know.

982
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,523
It's on the house. it's from Diana.

983
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,203
- Ohh. Hey, thanks very much.
- No, no, no. I said the young guy.

984
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,766
Hey. Hi. This is for you.
it's from Diana.

985
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,604
- Oh, wow, thanks.
- You're welcome.

986
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,282
Zero matches?
I didn't think that was possible.

987
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,647
No, no, I'm just kind of--
I'm just messing around here.

988
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,081
- Yeah, I know.
- What a bizarre world...

989
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,242
...this internet dating thing is.

990
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,006
Hey, let me ask you something.
ls Grace a big baseball fan?

991
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,241
Grace?

992
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,722
No. No, she hates baseball.

993
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,405
- Really?
- Yeah. Despises it.

994
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,244
I just talked with Maggie's dad
and he was saying...

995
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,444
...that the girls have been going
to some minor league games.

996
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,682
- Well, the kids are probably enjoying it.
- No, that's just it.

997
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,447
It's like the kids are with the grandparents
in Nantucket for a few days.

998
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,965
Our girls been going alone.

999
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,924
What is that?

1000
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,565
Just a-- it's a picture.

1001
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,564
- That's from high school.
- Yeah, I know. I think it says a lot about me.

1002
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,610
I love football and it's--
it's just like a teaser, man. There's like--

1003
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,683
I got some more current ones. Look.

1004
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,888
- Oh, look at that.
- it's cute.

1005
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,122
Never occurred to you that
the wife and three kids...

1006
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,362
...might scare off
potential ladies though, huh?

1007
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,761
You think I should Photoshop
the baby out?

1008
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,890
Yeah. I think you should Photoshop
all of them out. Come on.

1009
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,601
Look, I'm trying to be honest here.
I don't want some gal walking away...

1010
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,128
...with a broken ticker when she finds out
I'm a one-time carnival ride.

1011
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,570
Mm-hm. Let's forget the internet, all right?

1012
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,326
You and I gotta start playing
to our strengths. Starting now.

1013
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,323
- Good. What are they?
- Let's be honest.

1014
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,005
Complete strangers do not like us.

1015
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,645
- Agreed.
- But you know who does?

1016
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,361
People that know us just a little bit.
Like in a casual surface-y kind of way.

1017
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,921
- They dig us.
- They do dig us.

1018
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,003
When they don't know us
that well.

1019
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,527
- Like who?
- Well, I was thinking about ....

1020
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,801
- Oh. Hi, Fred.
- Hey, Missy. Oh, here, I got you this.

1021
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,803
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

1022
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,322
- Stuffed grape leaves?
- Yeah, and some gyros.

1023
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,444
Gyros. However the hell you say it.
Heh, heh.

1024
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,206
- Frankinopoulos. You're Greek, right?
- My ex-husband is.

1025
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,603
Right. Right.

1026
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,925
So ....

1027
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,928
How are you, Fred?

1028
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,169
- Are you okay?
- I don't wanna get into all the details...

1029
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,646
...but my wife gave me this one time deal
where I get to be with another woman.

1030
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,930
- Really?
- Yeah.

1031
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,725
Not bad, right?

1032
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,807
Wait a second.

1033
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,050
Is that why you're here?

1034
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,090
Well, if that's what you're getting at
I'm not gonna say no.

1035
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,765
What are you, an asshole?

1036
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,241
Hey, don't go shooting
the messenger now.

1037
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,721
You come over here out of the blue
with a bag of garbage.

1038
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,723
- You're welcome.
- And you think I'm gonna fuck you...

1039
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,009
...because of some bullshit agreement
you had with your wife?

1040
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,409
You know what? Screw you, Fred.

1041
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,407
What the hell just happened?

1042
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,091
Yeah!

1043
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,925
Go, go, go!

1044
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,847
Yeah!

1045
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,044
- Hi.
- Hi. Can I take your order?

1046
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,889
I'm not quite sure what I'm gonna get.

1047
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,481
Um, hmm.

1048
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,131
Hoo. Um ....

1049
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,204
So just tell me today

1050
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,443
Um, hey, man, do you mind
if she takes my order?

1051
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,961
Why?

1052
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,202
Well, just .... You know, because ....

1053
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,287
Because she's--

1054
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,406
She's taken my order before and it's--

1055
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,928
I'm thinking she'll remember it,
and it gets a little bit complicated...

1056
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,447
...so I'm thinking it could speed up
the process.

1057
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,409
You know, if it's not a big deal.

1058
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,881
Little help. Leigh?

1059
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,811
Your unique barista skills
have been requested.

1060
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,445
Oh, hey.

1061
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,126
- Hi.
- What can I get you?

1062
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,645
Iced coffee, two Splendas.

1063
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,842
- That'll be $2.
- Nice tunes, by the way.

1064
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,651
You guys choose them yourself
or they come from Corporate?

1065
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,842
It's me. it's Snow Patrol.

1066
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,766
Oh, yeah. Good soundtrack.
Pretty good movie.

1067
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,244
Tell you one thing, Cube Gooding definitely
does not belong in the snow, does he?

1068
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,845
You're thinking of Snow Dogs,
the kiddie flick.

1069
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,606
This is Snow Patrol, the band.

1070
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,324
Thank you for the tip.

1071
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,528
Ahem. I was making a joke.

1072
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,364
- No, you weren't.
- Yeah, I was.

1073
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,682
- You were dead serious.
- It was a joke.

1074
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,245
One sec.

1075
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,571
Hello?

1076
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,885
Here you go.

1077
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,649
Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced coffee,
mister. Hmm?

1078
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,041
Why are you smiling?

1079
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,849
You think this is some alligator-infested
moat? No one can get over there to you?

1080
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,243
You know, this whole kind of
I'm-on-the-inside, too-cool-for-school...

1081
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,442
...let's-make-fun-of
the-dorky-suburban-guy.._

1082
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,683
...because-I'm-safe-on-this-side-of-the
counter routine's gonna get you hurt.

1083
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,650
Another thing?
After you've lost your parents' money...

1084
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,202
...on your avant-garde piece-of-crap
short film, you're gonna need a job.

1085
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,249
Guess what. it's guys like me that hire.

1086
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,210
Guys like me don't hire punks like you.
All right?

1087
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,443
So shape up. Good day, sir.

1088
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,762
I work out there.

1089
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,604
Oh, really? Here?

1090
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,367
Yeah, I work out at home but thinking
about taking my workouts public.

1091
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,567
What do you squat?

1092
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,731
Uh, well, I don't really squat. I just run on
the hamster wheel after work every day.

1093
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,930
Ha, ha. The old hamster wheel.
Yeah. I'm on that baby too.

1094
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,966
So did you, um, go to Harvard?

1095
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,567
Yeah. I went to a party there once.

1096
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,962
This is actually Harvard Health Care.

1097
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,806
Yeah, I had to go in when I got a bunch
of tests done for my life insurance.

1098
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,443
For your variable-term life insurance.
When you re-up on your death benefit, it--

1099
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,927
Not a big deal. This is-- Ah.

1100
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,482
This thing looks pretty good, though.
I like this. "Change your life."

1101
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,721
it's a great place.

1102
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,726
They've actually got a bar there,
so I always grab a beer after my workout.

1103
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,486
- A bar? Ha, ha.
- it's a good routine.

1104
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,324
Ha, ha. That sounds good.

1105
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,007
If you decide to join, tell them Leigh
sent you and I'll get two free months.

1106
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,441
Yeah. Sure thing, Leigh.

1107
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,806
Rocking.

1108
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,968
R-O-C-K in the U.S.A.

1109
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,167
LAUGHS]

1110
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,723
Gr whatever they say in Australia.

1111
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,368
Oh, I'm sorry. Ch.

1112
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,727
Hi. Hello. Hi, Britney.

1113
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,927
- Fred.
- Hello.

1114
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,606
Hey. And hello to Alli--

1115
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,921
- Come here.
- Anyway.

1116
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,368
Mr. Searing? You pick up other day.
No more clothes here.

1117
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,206
I know. I was just Corning by to let
you guys know what a great job you did.

1118
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,522
As always.
Just the perfect amount of starch.

1119
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,883
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1120
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,363
Ah. I'm gonna head out.

1121
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,444
Got a meeting across town in 'IO minutes,
so I should boogie.

1122
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,364
- Okay. Mm.
- Very nice seeing you.

1123
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,047
Hey, if you get a chance,
please pound Ed's potato for me.

1124
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,851
Okay. Uh, goodbye. Mwah.

1125
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,048
Oh, don't do that. That's--

1126
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,567
Okay. All right. Bye.

1127
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,651
Hi.

1128
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,881
You want a massage?

1129
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,243
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You fill out form.

1130
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,403
No, no, no. You know,
I'd prefer no paper trail.

1131
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,687
Fill out form. It policy.

1132
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,528
You know what? Um, honestly,
I'd prefer not to have anything in print.

1133
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,603
- Little man. Scram.
- Ha, ha.

1134
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,047
How I know what you want
if you no fill out form?

1135
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,771
I'll just say it to you. I'll just tell you.

1136
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,446
- So, what you waiting for'?!
- Oh. Hey. Heh, heh.

1137
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,331
Not very relaxing so far. Um ....

1138
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,482
Okay, um, come here.

1139
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,124
Can I get a rub-and-tug
and finish off with a tea bag, please?

1140
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,931
Okay. But must check with manager first.

1141
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,320
No.

1142
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,121
...rub-and-tug... tea bag...

1143
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,726
- Um, she misheard. No.
- You must fill out form.

1144
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,121
I said, rub, no tug.

1145
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,282
And the tea bags were--
You heat those up.

1146
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,490
You dip them in water, heat them up,
and put them on pressure--

1147
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,166
How do I know more about massage
than you guys know about massage?

1148
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,362
- That doesn't make sense.
- You are so busted.

1149
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,767
Sorry. Oh, God.

1150
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,604
Okay. Sorry.

1151
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,960
- Shake it, shake it, shake it
- Like a tambourine

1152
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,322
Shake it, shake it, shake it
You the one for me

1153
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,323
Shake it, shake it, Mama
You the one for me

1154
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,801
I'm realizing you're the only one
That's meant to be

1155
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,923
And when I wake up in the morning
All I wanna see

1156
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,242
ls the sun and it's shining on you
Next to me

1157
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,641
You got a little broken nail
Got a hair out of place

1158
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,411
Got a little bit of extra middle
Right around the waist

1159
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,847
- Shake it, shake it, shake it
- Like a tambourine

1160
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,241
Shake it, shake it, shake it
You the one for me

1161
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,810
Leigh?

1162
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,124
Hey, girl.

1163
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,361
An right!

1164
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,482
Hey, Clyde. This is my friend ....

1165
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,926
- Rick.
- Rick.

1166
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,206
He'd like to join.

1167
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,486
Great.

1168
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,166
- I'll get you signed right up.
- Okay.

1169
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,209
- All right. I'll see you later on.
- Yeah.

1170
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:25,046
Oh, Leigh, are you gonna grab a brew-ski
after your workout?

1171
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,406
No.

1172
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,806
Gonna grab two.

1173
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,611
Meet me down here
in about one hour sharp.

1174
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,649
Yeah. Peace it.

1175
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,445
Ah.

1176
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,925
Help!

1177
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,882
I can't feel my legs!

1178
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,401
I can't feel my muscles!

1179
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,241
Holy shit!

1180
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,924
- Did you faint, sir?
- No, I just ....

1181
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,526
I think I was in the hot tub too long.
I just ....

1182
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,444
My body just feels like jelly.

1183
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,921
You're gonna be okay.
Just take a couple breaths.

1184
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,724
Get me some towels.

1185
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,441
No, no. Do me a favor.
Irish, switch places with this guy.

1186
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,090
Why?

1187
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,651
- Does this mean you're going steady?
- it's not funny.

1188
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,202
This poor kid is spending his
hard-earned money on me. it's sad.

1189
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,451
I mean, it's cute, but it's really sad.

1190
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,525
You should be flattered. You're 38 years old
and you have college guys chasing you.

1191
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,966
He thinks I'm 32.

1192
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,325
What? Look, I just-- I feel bad if I gave him
the wrong impression, you know?

1193
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,926
No, you didn't give him
the wrong impression.

1194
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,521
"Dear Grace, our final game is tonight.

1195
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:16,162
Please meet me at my place afterwards
to toast the best summer of my life.

1196
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,483
Yours most truly, Gerald Ahem."

1197
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,730
Number 11.

1198
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,922
Yeah, thanks for piling on.

1199
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,770
I mean, I can't accept this.

1200
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,082
I'm just gonna have to go
set him straight.

1201
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,283
You know what I miss the most?

1202
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,687
What?

1203
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,961
The arch.

1204
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,607
- The arch?
- Yeah.

1205
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,205
You know that moment when you're taking
a girl's panties off for the very first time...

1206
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,442
...and you don't know
if she's gonna stop you.

1207
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,490
Then she gives
that tiny little pelvic arch thrust...

1208
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,450
...to help you out,
let you know you're in the clear.

1209
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,681
Smooth sailing.

1210
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,410
I miss that.

1211
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,449
- That's a nice moment.
- Yeah.

1212
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,202
We let down the male species,
you know that?

1213
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,886
Maybe you were right.
We should just call it quits...

1214
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,884
- ...and just ask the girls to come home.
- No!

1215
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,964
I want the hall pass, okay?

1216
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,010
At first I wasn't sure,
but now I want the dream.

1217
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,640
I don't even know
what the dream is anymore.

1218
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,006
I'll tell you what it is.

1219
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,364
I wanna remember what it feels like
to be with someone...

1220
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,409
...who really wants to be with me...

1221
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,244
...out of just pure desire...

1222
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,246
...not because they have to
out of some sense of duty.

1223
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,480
You know, all this arch talk's got me
craving some Mickey D's.

1224
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,051
- Up for it?
- Yeah.

1225
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,806
Hello?

1226
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,010
Yeah. Yeah.

1227
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,407
Okay.

1228
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,245
All right. See you there.

1229
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,241
Who was that?

1230
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,846
Ah. That was just an angel from heaven.

1231
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,570
Coakley's back in town.

1232
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,006
- What?
- Yeah.

1233
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,924
He wants to hang and he wants to bang.

1234
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,444
Waiting for a sign

1235
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,561
if I survive, I'll worship the moon

1236
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,569
Or something, anything

1237
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,725
Push the defrost button
on the microwave, boys.

1238
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,480
The deep freeze is over.

1239
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,724
And they talked

1240
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,922
And they danced

1241
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,323
Coakley.

1242
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,167
Mm.

1243
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,810
Okay, boys, you're on the clock now.

1244
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,041
What?

1245
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,488
You gotta hit them right out of the gate.
Half an hour from now you'll be old news.

1246
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,564
Oh. Should we go talk
with this girl right here?

1247
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,529
Don't waste your time, man.

1248
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,761
Why?

1249
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,207
Workaholic.
She'll be out of here in five minutes.

1250
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,761
- What are you talking about?
- Look at her hand.

1251
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,809
Carpal tunnel syndrome.

1252
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,128
Even if she stayed,
you wouldn't want her.

1253
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,002
You get a hand job from her, you need
the Jaws of Life to get you out of it.

1254
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,889
Yeah, there she goes.

1255
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,850
Wow. You're good.

1256
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,445
Oh, hey. Hey.

1257
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,211
- The tall blond, right here. Yeah.
- Hmm.

1258
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,001
Forget about it. it's an illusion.
She's surrounded by stootfish.

1259
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,525
Stootfish?

1260
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,162
When an eight surrounds herself
with less attractive women...

1261
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,842
- ...to make her look like a 10.
- What are you talking about? She is a 10.

1262
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,128
You make me laugh, Freddie.
Come on, try this.

1263
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,651
All right.

1264
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,962
- What is it?
- Now block everything out.

1265
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,525
- Tell me what you see.
- Wha--?

1266
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,843
Uh-huh. Okay, now watch this, man.

1267
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,201
Hot.

1268
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,521
FRED;
Right.

1269
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,007
- Not.
- Oh, my God.

1270
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,730
Hot.

1271
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,051
Not.

1272
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,328
- Holy shit!
- Ha-ha-ha.

1273
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,165
That's amazing.
You're like A Beautiful Mind.

1274
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,610
I can't do well
When I think you're gonna leave me

1275
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,285
But I know I try

1276
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,010
Are you gonna leave me now?

1277
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,725
Can't you be believing now?

1278
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,251
Hey, Mr. Mills.

1279
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,209
Hey! Paige!

1280
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,203
I thought you were down at the Cape.

1281
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,648
Your in-laws took the kids for the weekend,
so I came home early.

1282
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,441
- Okay.
- I turned 21 today.

1283
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,886
I'm legal now.

1284
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,684
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1285
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,205
Yeah. You out celebrating?

1286
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,681
Yeah, my cousin got me
and my aunt on the VIP list.

1287
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,765
That's my Aunt Meg over there.

1288
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,447
She's 45 years old and she still parties
like she's my age.

1289
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,887
- Whoo!
- Wow.

1290
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,601
So, Rick, how's the week off
from marriage going?

1291
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,730
You don't mind if I call you Rick?
I am officially an adult now.

1292
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,609
No, sure. But what did you just say?

1293
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,606
I was asking you about that hall-pass thing.
I babysat for the Putneys last night.

1294
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,444
I heard Mr. Putney talking about it.

1295
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,251
Gary was talk--
Who was he talking about it to?

1296
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,528
- Just everyone at the barbecue.
- What?

1297
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,047
Oh, I don't think he meant it
in a bad way.

1298
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,608
I actually think it's cool of you to be
staying at the Comfy Nite Inn...

1299
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:09,049
...instead of bringing girls back to your
home with the kids' pictures all taped up.

1300
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,440
Thank you.

1301
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,968
- What can I get you?
- Can I get three tequila shots, please?

1302
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,207
By the way, I think that I owe you
an apology.

1303
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,160
Last week when you drove me home,
I shouldn't have snapped at you like that.

1304
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,928
No, no, no. Don't be ridiculous.
It was just a misunderstanding.

1305
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,286
No, it wasn't.

1306
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,131
If you thought that I was
kind of coming on to you...

1307
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,887
...it's probably because I kind of was.

1308
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,801
- Fifty-seven bucks.
- What? Are you kidding me? That--

1309
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,685
That seems a little stiff.

1310
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,003
They're just kids in here.
I don't see how they afford these prices.

1311
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,410
- Paige, I better get going.
- What? Where are you going?

1312
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,690
Paige, you're my kids' babysitter.
Have a happy birthday.

1313
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,842
But my Aunt Meg wants to meet you.

1314
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,731
- All right.
- Yeah! Getting wasted.

1315
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,360
- Whoo! Mm.
- The spirits doth floweth.

1316
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,205
- Aah!
- Yeah! Ha, ha.

1317
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,400
That girl over there is looking at you.

1318
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:22,086
Which one? What? The one that looks
like Chief from Cuckoo's Nest?

1319
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,851
No, no, man. The one sitting next to her.

1320
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,201
Oh, yeah.

1321
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,489
She's very vulnerable.
She just quit cigarettes.

1322
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,051
How do you know?

1323
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,767
Because she can't take her eyes
off the smokers over there.

1324
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,889
How do you know
those aren't her friends?

1325
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,522
- Come on, Coakley, give me a break.
- Well, that might be plausible...

1326
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,449
...if her lips weren't shaking...

1327
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,120
...and her fingernails weren't chewed
down to the nub.

1328
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,365
And that bag, man.
That's a little big to be bringing into a club.

1329
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,406
Unless she needs room
for a $5 foot-long.

1330
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,927
- So you got a woman who quit smoking.
- Right.

1331
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,084
She's tense, she's hungry.

1332
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,040
And it all adds up to what?

1333
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,570
That woman needs something
in her mouth.

1334
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,563
Aah, that's my boy! Let's go!

1335
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,563
- Now?
- Right now, man. The universe is calling.

1336
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,449
- I don't know if we need to go now.
- Come on.

1337
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,131
Walking on a dream

1338
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,641
How can I explain?

1339
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,930
Talking to myself

1340
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,083
Will I see again?

1341
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,601
We are always running for the thrill of it
Thrill of it

1342
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,287
Always pushing up the hill
Searching for the thrill of it

1343
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,881
On and on and on
We are calling out

1344
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,486
How late's this bitch
staying open tonight?

1345
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,721
Ick.

1346
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,284
Is it real now

1347
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,407
When two people become one?

1348
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,769
I can feel it

1349
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,121
When two people become one

1350
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,409
ls it real now

1351
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,090
When two people become one?

1352
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,451
I can feel it

1353
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,687
Hey, girl.

1354
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,251
Hey.

1355
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,970
What are you doing here?

1356
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,201
Just chilling.

1357
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,129
Yeah, me too.

1358
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,203
Just chilling and wiggling.

1359
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,644
What happened to you yesterday?
Thought we were gonna get a beer.

1360
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,881
Yeah. Uh ....

1361
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,171
I got caught up in my reps and my curls
and shit and just lost track of time.

1362
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,642
So is this, like, your playground?
It seems like great energy in here.

1363
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,962
No, I've actually never been here before.

1364
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,805
A friend of mine's DJ'ing,
so I promised him I'd come.

1365
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,809
Calling out and out again

1366
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,246
Never looking down

1367
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,641
So is this guy like your boyfriend
or something?

1368
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,490
No, no,no.

1369
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,808
Well, we messed around once,
but just a little.

1370
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,008
And by a little you mean--?

1371
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,525
Anal.

1372
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,330
Okay. Yeah.

1373
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,851
I'm joking.

1374
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,525
- Oh. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

1375
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,846
He kissed me one night. Kissed him back.
It was a big mistake.

1376
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,963
So, what's with the ring?

1377
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,361
Yeah, I--

1378
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,842
You ever heard of a hall pass?

1379
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,164
All right, it's about time I take
the governor off this beyotch!

1380
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,803
It was those tall skinny guys
and they were all over my yard.

1381
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,049
But here's the weird thing.
I wasn't even afraid of them at all.

1382
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,249
And when they asked me if I wanted to go
with them, I said, "Sure."

1383
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,084
And I walked right in.

1384
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,561
Oh, my God. You are so brave.

1385
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,967
I would never climb
into one of those things.

1386
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,408
Fred, would you ever just walk into a UFO
on your own?

1387
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,331
I would if one came right now, sure.

1388
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,725
Wow, so you're married?

1389
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,125
Yeah. It wasn't like I was trying to hide it.
I mean, you know.

1390
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,882
No, I just thought your wife might've died
and you're wearing it out of respect.

1391
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,641
Oh, no. No, she's still hanging in there.

1392
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,282
Hey, you okay?
You keep checking your pulse.

1393
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,923
Yeah. I just-- I got a little chest cramp,
but I'm working through it.

1394
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,081
Ouch.

1395
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,321
- Yeah.
- Heartburn?

1396
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:13,725
No, it feels more like
excessive plaque build-up in the arteries.

1397
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,289
Hi, Maggie. This is Isabel.

1398
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,006
I went to clean the house today,
but nobody has been there...

1399
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,162
...or slept in any of the beds this week...

1400
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,567
...so I just cleaned the windows
and left early.

1401
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,210
I hope you don't mind. Bye.

1402
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,125
Hey.

1403
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,406
What are you doing here?

1404
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,484
I thought you might wanna help me
celebrate the end of the season.

1405
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,971
Oh, um ....

1406
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,046
Uh, brought some good late-night eats.

1407
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,522
Yeah. Yeah, come on in.

1408
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,131
- Come on. You gotta go.
- No.

1409
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,883
Come on. Can I go?

1410
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,646
LAUGHS]

1411
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,807
What are you doing, man? Come on.

1412
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,090
You found your dream girl, now take her
back to the hotel and take care of business.

1413
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,130
We don't have much in common.
I can't even talk to her.

1414
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,329
Talk to her? Fred, now what do you want,
a pen pal or a poon pal?

1415
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,608
I only got one shot at this, all right?

1416
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,250
I think I can do better.

1417
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,449
Every loser in Vegas
thinks they can do better.

1418
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,366
You know what winners do? They walk
away from the table while they're up.

1419
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,288
Licky like a sexy ear

1420
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,204
Lick here

1421
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,247
L-l licky C-K licky Y licky C-K licky Y

1422
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,483
Why? Because I am a /icky-/icky guy

1423
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,687
Yeah!

1424
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,406
I licky /-C /icky K-Y

1425
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,403
I'm just a /icky girl

1426
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,803
How do I know
if she'll come home with me?

1427
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,931
Oh, she'll Come home with you.
She's wearing a thong, man.

1428
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,969
How do you know that?

1429
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,724
I did a crawl-by.

1430
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,689
Coakley.

1431
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,721
Licky my sticky

1432
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,050
Fuck it. Okay, here.

1433
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,409
Give those to Rick.
I'm gonna take a cab back to the hotel. Oh.

1434
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,641
- Freddie.
- What?

1435
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,051
It has been an honor
to watch you grow up.

1436
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,091
All right.

1437
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,969
Licky like a tangerine

1438
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,008
Thirteen hundred dollars?
For two bottles of booze?

1439
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,401
Guys, it was an accident.
I'm not paying that.

1440
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,763
- Yes, you are.
- No, l-- Look, how about--

1441
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,161
How about I replace them.
First thing tomorrow morning...

1442
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,721
...I bring you four new bottles.
Not two, four...

1443
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,009
...and a couple of breakfast burritos
for the big dog here. That's a good deal.

1444
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,482
- How about you pay now.
- No. Guys ....

1445
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,684
We're taking the party back to my house.
Bring a girl or don't come, man.

1446
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,126
What?

1447
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,931
Okay, now don't even think
about putting e tip on there.

1448
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,328
Hey. There's my girl.

1449
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,771
Come on in.
I'm just mixing up some margaritas.

1450
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,207
We lost our final game today,
but I went yard.

1451
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,771
Oh, that's good.

1452
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,002
So, um, where is everybody?

1453
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,004
They all went out to some party.
Come on in.

1454
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,162
Gerry, I can't stay.

1455
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,281
What?

1456
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,606
Is everything okay?

1457
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,762
Yeah. No, everything's fine.

1458
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,323
Look, um, I really can't accept this.

1459
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,801
Why not?

1460
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,010
Because I'm a married woman, Gerry,
you know that.

1461
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,850
Oh. Um ....

1462
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,571
Look, I'm really sorry if I made you
feel uncomfortable, Grace.

1463
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,285
It's just...

1464
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,121
...I really like you.

1465
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,971
I like you too, Gerry.

1466
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,169
And, no, you didn't make me feel
uncomfortable.

1467
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,601
The mystery zone

1468
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,645
All right

1469
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,246
Wait, are you serious?

1470
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,925
You might have appendicitis?

1471
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,970
My stomach's rumbling
and I'm having these shooting pains.

1472
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,764
I should take you to the hospital.

1473
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,322
No, I'll be all right.
it's probably just this stupid patch.

1474
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,323
I mean, I quit smoking and--

1475
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,162
It's just-- I think I'm allergic to it,
and it makes me all queasy and--

1476
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,244
- Oh.
- Plus, I had a bunch of drinks at the club.

1477
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,970
Well, are you gonna throw up?

1478
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,327
Oh. No, I can't.

1479
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,847
Ooh, here. Here. Here.
Just take this just in case.

1480
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,082
No, I'm one of those people
who can never throw up.

1481
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,690
I wish I could throw up.
I know it would help.

1482
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,082
Oh. Wow.

1483
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,442
You know what?
I think I feel a little better.

1484
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,850
That sneeze helped.

1485
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,527
Take her wherever she wants to go.
Here you are.

1486
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,526
But I never got your number!

1487
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,450
- Can I help you?
- You must be Rick.

1488
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,967
Go on.

1489
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,044
Hi, my name's Meg. Paige's aunt.

1490
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,761
I guess I still have a lot
to get out of my system...

1491
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,247
...before I do the whole marriage trip,
you know?

1492
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,483
I'm one of those people that wants to try
everything once.

1493
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,846
And the good things twice.

1494
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,044
Oh, like swim with the dolphins.

1495
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,602
- Yeah. I'd love to meet the Dalai Lama.
- Mm. Sure.

1496
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,967
- Bungee jump.
- Oh, I've already done that.

1497
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,168
- Skydiving.
- Skinny-dip in the Indian Ocean.

1498
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,448
- Sleep with a married guy. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

1499
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,123
I just mean if that was
one of the things on the old bucket list...

1500
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:48,403
...I could help you cross that off.
To sleep with a married guy.

1501
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,370
Ahem. What'd you say, the Indian Ocean?

1502
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,887
- I don't wanna be a home wrecker, Rick.
- No, no, no.

1503
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,287
That's what I'm saying. I've got a pass.

1504
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,047
You could do this with a clear conscience.
I'm not trying to sell you on it.

1505
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,328
Those are the facts of the situation.

1506
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:09,121
it's getting a little loud in here. Is there
somewhere a bit more quiet we could go?

1507
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,601
Coakley's game room upstairs.
it's soundless.

1508
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,445
- it's like space.
- Leigh!

1509
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,282
- Leigh.
- Oh, this fucking guy.

1510
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,970
Brent, what are you doing here?

1511
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,646
The old dude invited me.
He invited the entire club.

1512
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,041
You knew how important tonight was!

1513
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,931
My whole family was there!
And they don't come to anything!

1514
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,366
The fuck you looking at?

1515
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,649
Everyone came tonight
and they stayed, except for you!

1516
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,484
That's not respectful!

1517
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,846
Okay, just calm down.

1518
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,328
No! I would like to speak to you alone.
Alone.

1519
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,322
I'll just be a second.

1520
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,001
- Ahem. Uh, hey.
- Oh, hey.

1521
01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:01,649
Uh, sorry about being a little, you know,
quick on the trigger there. it's just, uh ....

1522
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,885
You know, you're so hot
I couldn't help myself.

1523
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,166
Oh ....

1524
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,245
it's fine.

1525
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,691
Is, uh, everything okay?

1526
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,411
Yeah. Yeah.

1527
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:24,605
Uh .... No, everything's not okay.

1528
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,731
Um ....

1529
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,485
Look, you're a great guy, Gerry.

1530
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,371
But what just happened here ....

1531
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,043
Yeah, that can never happen again.

1532
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,929
Okay?

1533
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,327
Ch.

1534
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:45,606
I mean, I know it's kind of hard
to understand after ....

1535
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:51,651
But, um, I really love my husband.

1536
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,769
And in reality, you and me, here...

1537
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:01,051
...this could never be more
than what it just was.

1538
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,402
Yeah. I know that.

1539
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,891
You do?

1540
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,565
Well, yeah.

1541
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,929
Yeah, no. I mean, jeez, um ....

1542
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,210
Look, no offense or anything,
but let's face it. You're a lot older than me.

1543
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,446
By
- No, I don't mean that in a bad way.

1544
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,851
It's just, you know, I didn't think we were
gonna start dating or anything, you know?

1545
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,646
Jeez, can you imagine, like,
the looks that we would get?

1546
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,690
It'd be like Hugh Hefner
and his girlfriends.

1547
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,366
- Ha, ha. You'd be Hef.
- Yeah, I got that.

1548
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,280
- Yeah.
- Hmm. Huh.

1549
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,930
Um, you know what? I gotta get going.
We have a--

1550
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,930
We have a team meeting in like 20 minutes.
it's a tradition.

1551
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,481
It'd probably be really uncool
if I didn't--

1552
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,165
Yeah, you don't have to explain.

1553
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,446
Okay.

1554
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,843
Um, well, seriously, though,
thanks for everything.

1555
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,281
- You're awesome at sex.
- Oh.

1556
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:06,642
I'm sure there's an explanation
for why he hasn't slept in your bed.

1557
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,882
You know,
maybe he took a trip somewhere.

1558
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,965
No. He can't. He has two houses closing
escrow this week. He has to be in town.

1559
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,727
Maybe he has been home, but he can't
stand sleeping in your bed without you...

1560
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,326
...so he's been racking on the couch and,
you know...

1561
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,641
...banging all the women there.

1562
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,926
LAUGHS]

1563
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,690
Here, open. Oh.

1564
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,401
You--

1565
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,322
- Not bad, huh?
- All right. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

1566
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,731
Um, I wonder what's keeping Grace.

1567
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,962
She went over there
to break the kid's heart.

1568
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,691
The least she could do
is lend a sympathetic ear.

1569
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,482
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1570
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,288
I hope you don't mind
me tracking you down.

1571
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,204
Paige told me where you were staying.

1572
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,001
Please. No, not at all. No.
it's good to have company.

1573
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,367
You've been very sweet to her.

1574
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,049
Well, you know, she's a good kid. She's
a good kid and I do what I can for the kids.

1575
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:29,161
She told me everything
and I have to admit, I was very impressed.

1576
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,401
Hmm?

1577
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:36,124
I mean, I know she came on to you twice,
and that both times you set her straight.

1578
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,401
She came on to me?

1579
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,324
Rick, enough with the chivalry.

1580
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:44,566
I mean, come on. Paige has a crush on
you and you didn't take advantage of her.

1581
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:48,805
I'm just saying, that is very cool.

1582
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,404
Especially since you have
your wife's permission now.

1583
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,325
Yeah.

1584
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,761
I like that, Rick.

1585
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,200
You have morals.

1586
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,126
Yeah.

1587
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,282
Well, all you have in this world
is your word.

1588
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,521
Mm.

1589
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,329
Quiet little voices

1590
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,807
Creep into my head
I'm young again

1591
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:19,524
I'm young again, I'm young again
I'm young again

1592
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,445
Quiet little monsters

1593
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,807
Creep inside my bedroom well

1594
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,569
I 'll fall for you, I 'll fall for you
I 'll fall for you

1595
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,121
Quiet words of wisdom

1596
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,967
Creep into your victim 's ears

1597
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:40,091
I'll die for you, I'll die for you
I 'll die for you

1598
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,561
- I love that picture.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1599
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,047
- Yeah. That was a great day, man.
- It was.

1600
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,248
Everybody had a great time
at that wedding.

1601
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,368
I mean everybody.

1602
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,126
You know, I went balls deep
in one of the bridesmaids.

1603
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,520
Yeah, I remember.

1604
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:59,084
She was a really pretty girl
with these big old floppy tits. Boom.

1605
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,011
Hello? Bluh. Ha, ha.

1606
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,884
You-- What was her name, man?

1607
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,530
- Jenny. Yeah.
- Jenny.

1608
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,762
My sister, Jenny.

1609
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,201
Nice girl. Really sweet.

1610
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,650
- And how's she doing?
- Good.

1611
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,165
Oh, great, man, great.

1612
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:20,483
- Still married.
- Oh, is she? Great. I'm glad it worked out.

1613
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,405
Seemed like they were having problems,
you know?

1614
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,810
- Hey.
- Hey.

1615
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,041
There you are.

1616
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,522
Uh, yeah.
I was thinking that you were gone.

1617
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,411
No. I told you,
I just had to talk him off the ledge.

1618
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,130
I sent him home. He's fine now.

1619
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,601
- Ha, ha.
- You picked somewhere nice and quiet.

1620
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,929
Yeah. Yeah, it is, uh, quiet in here.

1621
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,722
You know, in fact, it's so quiet
I kind of just-- I kind of hit a wall.

1622
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,201
Yeah, I was-- I'm gonna split.

1623
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,567
Really? Are you--? You okay?

1624
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,960
Yeah. No, I feel good.

1625
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:21,728
I got a little tickle in my ear that I get
in the summer from mold spores that--

1626
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,646
You gotta be careful because they'll come
into your throat. But no, no, I got ....

1627
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,645
I have commitments.

1628
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,245
Wow.

1629
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,562
Hey, relax.

1630
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,362
Try not to think so much.

1631
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,842
You have your wife
for the rest of your life.

1632
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,048
Tonight, you can have me.

1633
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,889
So I drink again

1634
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:53,645
Oh, oh
And I play the game

1635
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,610
Oh, oh
Like I did yesterday

1636
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,764
Uh, you know what? I'm sorry.

1637
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:04,482
I can't do this. I can't do this, I'm sorry.

1638
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,320
Your wife didn't give you
a permission slip, did she?

1639
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,527
No, no, she did.

1640
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,843
Look, you are insanely beautiful
and sexy...

1641
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,164
...and every cell in my body
is angry at me right now.

1642
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,288
I've got, like, a mutiny on my hands.

1643
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,602
I feel like I'm vibrating. Like ....

1644
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,925
But you see this area?

1645
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,171
This spot right here.

1646
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:31,325
The first time I ever slept with Maggie back
in college, she fell asleep right here...

1647
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,960
...and she left, like,
a little pool of drool...

1648
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,124
...but it didn't really bother me.
it actually felt good.

1649
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,523
And I thought, "l wanna marry this girl."

1650
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,126
And then I did.
It was, like, a long shot.

1651
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,000
And miraculously, it came through.

1652
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,561
And then we had kids.
Emma, Gunnar and Mac.

1653
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:53,328
And that's their spot. When they're
brand-new they'd sleep right here.

1654
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,324
When it'd be 4 in the morning
you'd be holding their head...

1655
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,802
...because their little necks don't have--
They're just kind of like--

1656
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,004
And it's where we first
got to know each other.

1657
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:07,563
And it doesn't matter
how beautiful you are ....

1658
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,243
I gotta go home.

1659
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,006
I wanna go home.

1660
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,771
Well, uh, you definitely have
a screw loose.

1661
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,686
And you're probably going to regret this
for the rest of your life...

1662
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,525
...but, uh, you know what?

1663
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,210
You're a good guy.

1664
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,328
Um, do you need a ride home?

1665
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,768
No. it's only 2:30.
I'm gonna go back in the party.

1666
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,610
Okay.

1667
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,205
Peace it.

1668
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,522
R-O-C-K in the U.S.A.

1669
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,524
LAUGHS]

1670
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,165
Hello?

1671
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:08,927
Hello?

1672
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,809
- ls this Fred Searing?
- No.

1673
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,406
This is Trooper Frioli
of the Massachusetts State Police.

1674
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,246
No, it's a friend of his. I just picked
up his phone. Is everything okay?

1675
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:25,727
Yes, Rick. More tongue.

1676
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,127
Oh, God.

1677
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,406
Oh, yeah.

1678
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,085
More tongue. More tongue.

1679
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,608
There he is. Hey.

1680
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,886
What are you doing here?

1681
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,441
What do you think?
I'm looking for my aunt.

1682
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,170
Your aunt's staying here?

1683
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,047
I know you and her are hooking up.

1684
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,044
What? Paige, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1685
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,288
This is really bad timing.
I gotta get going.

1686
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,683
Look, I saw her car in the parking lot.
I know she's here.

1687
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,649
Okay, Paige. Enough, please.

1688
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,962
Just because your wife
isn't faithful to you...

1689
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:07,090
...doesn't mean you have to go around
screwing my family.

1690
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,645
What?

1691
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,961
Wow.

1692
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,209
I guess somebody doesn't know
about the baseball coach.

1693
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,963
Do the alphabet, Rick! Aah!

1694
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,162
Fred, I need to talk to you.

1695
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,486
Fred? I thought you were Rick.

1696
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,642
No, I'm Rick.

1697
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,448
- What?
- Please don't judge me.

1698
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,168
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What did
they say? Is Grace gonna be okay?

1699
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,529
They said she was in a oar accident
and they took her to the hospital.

1700
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,967
They wouldn't say any more
because I'm not you.

1701
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,891
- All right. Calm down.
- This is my fault.

1702
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,964
God is punishing me because
I'm the worst husband in the world.

1703
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,645
No, you're not. Come on, come on.

1704
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,161
Yes, I am. I've been bad, Rick.
I've been real bad.

1705
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,164
- We've both been bad.
- I kissed your babysitter's aunt.

1706
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,401
That's not so bad.

1707
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,726
- On the vagina.
- Ooh.

1708
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,730
- Oh!
- Whoa.

1709
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,326
- No, no! No. Ooh.
- Hey! Oh!

1710
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,601
Hey, what the hell?

1711
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:12,841
No, no! No!

1712
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,809
How do you like me now,
Splenda boy?

1713
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,530
Moron, this is my car!

1714
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,526
- Oh. This is your car?
- Yes!

1715
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,364
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

1716
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,567
Hey! Hey!

1717
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:25,041
You think I give a shit, pudge boy?

1718
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,531
Why am I pudge boy?

1719
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:29,206
Take it easy, okay? Relax.

1720
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,441
No! You take it easy!

1721
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,568
You think that you can
come into my club...

1722
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,688
...take my girl
and then get away with it?

1723
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,041
No. Not tonight, buddy.

1724
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:39,044
But why would you even try to have sex
with the right Rick? He was mine.

1725
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,884
- Ugh.
- Fuck, no!

1726
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,690
You're not gonna get away with it!

1727
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,490
- Never! Ever!
- Hey! Hey!

1728
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,284
Brent?

1729
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,770
Mother?

1730
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,561
- What are you doing here?
- Wait, wait, wait. Aunt Meg is your mom?

1731
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,764
How does he know your name?

1732
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,241
- Well-- Kind of--
- We-- Sort of--

1733
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,244
What? No. No, no, no.

1734
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,004
No.

1735
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,407
No. Are you telling me...

1736
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,724
...that this 40-hour-week motherfucking
soccer dad took my girl...

1737
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,649
...and this flabby asshole...

1738
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,167
...my mother?

1739
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,482
No, no, no!
I didn't have sex with your mom.

1740
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:22,367
- All I did was fake-chow her. All right?
- it's true.

1741
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,048
- That's it. You two are dead men.
- Whoa! He's got a gun!

1742
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,884
- No!
- What?

1743
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,042
- Where did you get that?
- Grandpa's closet!

1744
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,247
No! Brent!

1745
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,727
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1746
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,725
Go, go, go.

1747
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,447
Go, go, go. Get down.

1748
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,443
Am I scaring you, asshole?

1749
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,965
Do you have a shot count?

1750
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,491
- A shot count?
- Yeah!

1751
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,688
No, I didn't get a fucking shot count.

1752
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,171
Come here.

1753
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,041
Huh?
PAIGE & MEG Aah!

1754
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,007
Shooter down. Let's roll!

1755
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,205
- Go, go. Punch it. Punch it.
- I'm going.

1756
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,089
- Get off me, Mom.
- Brent, stop it.

1757
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,447
Oh, hell, no!

1758
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,641
What the hell was that?

1759
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,131
Go, go. Drive.

1760
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,969
- He's coming through the back.
- What's up, assholes?

1761
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,168
Swerve! Swerve! Swerve!

1762
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,011
Okay. No, no. He's gone. Drive. Drive.
You shook him.

1763
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:38,080
I don't believe this.
Maggie's having an affair.

1764
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,246
What?

1765
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,010
Well, you didn't give him a free pass
for nothing.

1766
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,844
So come on. Just be honest.
What were you trying to accomplish?

1767
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,444
I don't know.

1768
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,682
I just felt like...

1769
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,689
...he wasn't noticing me anymore.

1770
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:07,084
And I wanted to feel wanted again.

1771
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:13,527
And the truth is, I never really thought
he'd go through with it.

1772
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,764
Oh, my God.

1773
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,365
What?

1774
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,761
This hall pass.

1775
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,567
It was never for him.

1776
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,811
It was for me.

1777
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,528
I got a hall pass. Why shouldn't she?

1778
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,250
She's a beautiful woman.

1779
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,006
What guy isn't gonna wanna be
with a beautiful woman...

1780
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,726
...whose husband decides
he's gonna take a week off?

1781
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,521
Come on! What kind of hospital
doesn't have a live operator?

1782
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,569
Fred! Fred, it's 4 a.m.

1783
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,564
Uh-huh. And uh-huh.

1784
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,527
Huh. There's something
you don't see a lot.

1785
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:15,120
I took her for granted.
I took Maggie for granted. Yeah.

1786
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,769
I feel like I'm gonna throw up, man.

1787
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,406
Oh, great.

1788
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,450
- Okay, pull over, man.
- No way. I can outrun them.

1789
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,090
No, you can't! Not in this thing.

1790
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,441
Watch me.

1791
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,482
- Okay, now we got two of them.
- I don't care!

1792
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:33,530
- I'm not stopping till I get to Grace.
- Are you crazy?

1793
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,091
Yeah, I'm crazy!

1794
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,685
I'm crazy about my wife!

1795
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,731
What is happening?!

1796
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:45,809
Aah! Brent, that hurts!

1797
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,569
- Hey!
- What are you doing, man?

1798
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:59,122
Hear me out, gentlemen.
I can explain every-- Uh. Uh.

1799
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,245
Hold it!

1800
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,601
Aah! Aah! NO!

1801
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,928
No, no. Okay, okay! Aah.

1802
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:08,650
Oh, God. Grace needs me!

1803
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,362
- Take it easy, buddy.
- I won't take it easy!

1804
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,320
Okay, look. I did not stop because there's
a lunatic out there trying to kill us!

1805
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:19,087
And my wife's been in an accident,
and I need to see if she's okay!

1806
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,924
Because that woman is my life!

1807
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,811
Is he the husband of Grace Searing?

1808
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,606
Yes! Yes, I am. Is she okay?

1809
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,962
Please.
Please, tell me she's gonna be okay.

1810
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,766
She's having difficulty breathing.

1811
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,449
Oh, my God.

1812
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,321
Is she gonna live?

1813
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:43,330
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. She's fine.
She just broke her nose.

1814
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,763
We had to stuff some gauze up there.

1815
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,491
She's gonna be a mouth breather
for about a week.

1816
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,806
But, all in all, I would say
you're a very lucky guy.

1817
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,521
Bless you, doctor.

1818
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,682
I'll fucking kill you! Come here!

1819
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:02,242
We didn't know what was going on
because he came in through the window.

1820
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,084
That had been knocked out earlier...

1821
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,163
...back when he fired the holes in there.

1822
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,800
Rick! Rick! She's gonna be okay!

1823
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,291
- She's okay?
- She's all right.

1824
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,805
Hey, Anderson...

1825
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,726
...these guys are clean.

1826
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,281
That lunatic was attacking them
before he punched Officer Leska.

1827
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,205
Anyway, he's in bracelets.

1828
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,010
Well, I guess you're off the hook.

1829
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,207
Thank you.

1830
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:24,283
Can you believe it?
I get a second chance.

1831
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:29,725
Fred, go in there and take care
of that woman. You're lucky to have her.

1832
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,726
Okay. All right, thank you.

1833
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,281
Put her on a pedestal.
The biggest one you can find.

1834
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:37,046
Oh, wait! Rick, Rick, Rick.
Good luck with Mags.

1835
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,928
Oh, God.

1836
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,765
Oh, my God!

1837
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,403
Oh, God.

1838
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,884
Oh, my God. You poor thing.

1839
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,088
Um, hold on an second.
Rick just walked in.

1840
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,244
Grace has been in a car accident.

1841
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,970
Yeah, I know. She's okay, though.

1842
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,690
Fred's over there.

1843
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,411
Oh. So they're letting you go?

1844
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,486
Okay.

1845
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,808
You're headed here. Great.

1846
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,883
All right, I love you too.

1847
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,608
God, she scared me to death.

1848
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,364
Yeah.

1849
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,764
Hi.

1850
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,282
So, what are you doing here?

1851
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,649
March 25th, 1989.

1852
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,446
What?

1853
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,885
That's the day I lost my virginity.
March 25th, 1989.

1854
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,686
Approximately 10:30 p.m.

1855
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,841
What are you talking about?
We were dating then.

1856
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,801
I know. You were my first.

1857
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:21,846
And you were my last.

1858
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,843
And you've been everything in between.

1859
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,526
Really?

1860
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,121
Really.

1861
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,123
Is that why you were crying that night?

1862
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:36,287
I wasn't crying, I don't think.

1863
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,368
And I was--?

1864
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,883
I was your last?

1865
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,210
You're my only.

1866
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,164
Forever.

1867
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,170
Whose car is that out front?

1868
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,721
Oh, it's a friend of my dad.
Baseball player.

1869
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:10,850
He came over last night.
Drank some wine.

1870
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,049
He got a little frisky,
so I sent him home in a cab.

1871
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,561
Define frisky.

1872
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,805
Oh, don't worry. You were my last too.

1873
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,568
But I can't say you were my first.

1874
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,405
You know, words really do hurt.

1875
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,083
So I mean, what were you doing driving
around at 1 in the morning?

1876
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:51,323
No, I was just, um, upset about things...

1877
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,411
...and I wasn't paying any attention,
and I think I must have hit some sand...

1878
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:58,211
...and the next thing you know,
I'm running into a pole.

1879
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,485
Grace.

1880
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:03,605
I'm so sorry.

1881
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,250
- For what?
- For what?

1882
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,209
For putting you through all this.

1883
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,249
Hey, I love you.

1884
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,602
I love you too, Fred.

1885
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,287
It's not your fault.

1886
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:14,441
- Yes, it is.
- No.

1887
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:17,410
This is all my fault.
I'm the one that caused all of this.

1888
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:20,291
- Every single bit of this.
- "Horny old man"?

1889
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,364
No. No, that's not me.
No, that was intended for Rick.

1890
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,651
- Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1891
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,882
We need to talk about
what happened this week.

1892
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,486
Oh, Grace, no, no. Come on,
do we really have to?

1893
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,642
We really, really do.

1894
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:40,080
Okay, look. Look, whatever happened
this week doesn't matter. Okay?

1895
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,770
Because I love you and only you.

1896
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:45,806
And I am gonna treat you like the queen
that you are for the rest of your days.

1897
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,770
Okay? I'm gonna quit fantasy football
this year.

1898
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:53,005
Even though I have the first pick.
And we can do that Master Cleanse thing...

1899
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:57,563
...with the cayenne pepper and all that shit.
You will never have to shovel snow again.

1900
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:00,291
I'll do it, okay? Tennis elbow
be damned. I will do it.

1901
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:02,010
But please, I am begging you...

1902
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:05,846
...can we please just never, ever talk
about what happened this week?

1903
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,322
- Um ....
- Please.

1904
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,530
Deal. Ha, ha.

1905
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,921
- Really?
- Yeah.

1906
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,446
Thank you.

1907
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,090
Oh, thank you.

1908
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,480
Oh, my God.

1909
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:21,926
Oh, I love you, Grace.

1910
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,289
- I love you too, Fred.
- Oh, God.

1911
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,928
Does this mean that you will finally come
with me to An Evening With Kathy Griffin?

1912
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,207
Last night, I fake-chowed a DJ's mom.

1913
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,521
Let's talk about Miley Cyrus.
Who's got a stripper pole?

1914
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,202
Oh, yes.

1915
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:26,091
Fred, that is fantastic.

1916
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,241
What's that?

1917
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,244
Where did you find the Kathy Griffin
look-alike?

1918
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,006
Oh, no. No, that is Kathy Griffin.

1919
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,921
The Teen Awards,
where she went down there.

1920
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,242
And then the dads in the audience,
they're all clapping.

1921
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:40,801
Really?

1922
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,770
Better be. Cost me 275 bucks
to get her here.

1923
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,600
Plus bus fare.

1924
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,923
Kathy Griffin's a delight, isn't she?

1925
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,764
I've never seen them look happier.

1926
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,002
- Who's that, dear?
- Maggie and Grace.

1927
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:56,929
You know, I've been wondering
if maybe I should give you a hall pass.

1928
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,126
That was amazing.

1929
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:04,126
Thank you. it's nice finally to meet a
woman who's not obsessed with penis size.

1930
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,884
I appreciate that.

1931
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,210
- What the fuck is this?
- My husband!

1932
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,124
Why are you with my wife?

1933
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,521
- I've got hall pass. I have a hall pass.
- He's got a gun!

1934
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:13,767
Aah!

1935
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,204
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What if the cops question me?

1936
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:21,726
I'm weak.

1937
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:31,003
Excuse me?
Have you seen my granddaughter?

1938
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:39,563
Dude, up here.

1939
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:43,486
That was fucking awesome.
We saw the whole thing.

1940
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,610
This is racial profiling!
I wanna speak to a barrister!

1941
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,088
So, what do you think?

1942
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,842
Yeah. We'll give it a whirl. Why not?

1943
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:33,206
Tonight's the night we'll make history

1944
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:36,011
Honey, you and I

1945
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:41,767
'Cause I 'll take any risk

1946
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:46,926
To tie back the hands of time

1947
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:51,809
And stay with you here tonight

1948
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,445
Huh?

1949
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,085
Excuse me.

1950
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:06,881
What are you doing?

1951
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,768
It's not what you think. I swear.

1952
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,564
I was just giving him a faux job.

1953
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,767
Yeah. A what?

1954
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,005
A faux job.

1955
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:18,370
When you go south on a guy,
but you don't use your mouth...

1956
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:22,650
...you use your hands instead,
and then you make loud slurping noises.

1957
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,086
Hmm.

1958
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,163
Okay. Have en good night.

1959
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:34,642
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Yeah. Night.

1960
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,846
- They're nice, yeah?
- Yep.

1961
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:51,405
Yeah, you're out of breath, Stephen.

1962
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:56,609
And, action.

1963
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,169
Fucking hell.

1964
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,087
Wow.

1965
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:07,361
Wow.

1966
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,122
Good job, dude.

1967
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,609
All right, well, good luck
finishing your movie.

1968
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:18,166
I gotta change my drawers.
