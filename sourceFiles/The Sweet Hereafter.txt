It's my belief that Dolores was doing
exactly what she's done for years.

480
00:33:38,124 --> 00:33:41,126
Besides, the school board's insurance
on Dolores was minimal:

481
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:44,129
A few million at most.

482
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,590
No, the really deep pockets
are in the town.

483
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,134
Or the company that made the bus.

484
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:52,137
So you think someone else
caused the accident, Μr. Stevens?

485
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:56,938
Μrs. Otto, there is no such thing
as an accident.

486
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:00,729
The word doesn't mean anything to me.

487
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,565
As far as I'm concerned,

488
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:06,318
somebody, somewhere...

489
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,112
made a decision to cut a corner.

490
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:13,197
Some corrupt agency or corporation

491
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:17,287
accounted the cost variance
between a 10-cent bolt

492
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:21,027
and a million-dollar
out-of-court settlement.

493
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:28,632
And they decided to sacrifice
a few lives for the difference.

494
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,134
That's what's done, Μrs. Otto.

495

been driving that bus?

511

1377
01:35:46,515 --> 01:35:47,892
Yes.

1378
01:35:48,517 --> 01:35:53,045
- And what time in the morning was this?
- About 8:30 in the morning.

1379
01:35:54,357 --> 01:35:57,150
Was there anyone
waiting for the bus with you?

1380
01:35:57,151 --> 01:35:59,152
No.

1381
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:01,154
I was alone.

or the bus that particular morning?

1385

1394
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:46,011
there was nothing unusual
in the drive that morning.

1395
01:36:48,327 --> 01:36:50,836

1396
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:54,966
Yes.

1397
01:36:56,585 --> 01:37:01,014
There was a... a brown dog
that ran across the road up there.

1398
01:37:03,592 --> 01:37:05,552
Dolores slowed down
so that she wouldn't hit it

1399
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:08,652
and... he ran into the woods.

1400
01:37:09,515 --> 01:37:14,315
And then Dolores... drove on
and turned on to the Μarlow Road as usual.

1401
01:37:17,022 --> 01:37:19,383
I remember that.

1402
01:37:22,361 --> 01:37:24,280

Note that she said "pretty clearly",

1405
01:37:31,495 --> 01:37:34,372
- not "clearly".
- What was the weather like at this time?

1406
01:37:34,373 --> 01:37:35,791
<font color="#804040">NICOLE</font>: It was snowing.

01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:46,384

Yes, I understand.

1425
01:38:30,846 --> 01:38:32,518
Why were you scared?

1426
01:38:36,393 --> 01:38:39,542
Dolores was driving too fast.

1427
01:38:40,856 --> 01:38:42,857
Μrs. Driscoll
was driving too fast?

1428
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:44,731
What made you think that, Nicole?

1429
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,631
The speedometer.

1430
01:38:47,446 --> 01:38:50,490
- It... it was downhill there.
- You could see

1431
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:52,360
the speedometer?

1432
01:38:52,576 --> 01:38:54,248
Yes.

1433
01:38:55,538 --> 01:38:59,523
I looked.
I... I remember clearly now.

1434
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:03,419
Seemed we were going too fast
down the hill and I was scared.

1435
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:05,421
How fast would you say
Μrs. Driscoll was going?

1436
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:07,465
To the best of your recollection.

1437
01:39:07,466 --> 01:39:09,729
72 miles an hour.

1438
01:39:14,306 --> 01:39:16,175
72 miles an hour?

1439
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:18,012
You're sure of this?

1440
01:39:18,477 --> 01:39:20,199
Positive.

1441
01:39:21,856 --> 01:39:24,315
So you believe the bus
driven by Μrs. Driscoll

1442
01:39:24,316 --> 01:39:27,366
was traveling at 72 miles an hour
at this time?

1443
01:39:29,905 --> 01:39:31,774
I told you I was positive.

1444
01:39:32,908 --> 01:39:35,910
The speedometer was large
and easy to read from where I was.

1445
01:39:35,911 --> 01:39:37,287
You saw the speedometer?

1446
01:39:37,288 --> 01:39:39,206
Yes.

1447
01:39:40,124 --> 01:39:42,583
Did you say anything
to Μrs. Driscoll?

1448
01:39:43,752 --> 01:39:45,128
No.

1449
01:39:45,129 --> 01:39:48,425
- Why not?
- Because I was scared.

1450
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:50,983
And there wasn't time.

1451
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,991
There wasn't time?

1452
01:39:55,931 --> 01:39:57,603
No.

1453
01:39:58,726 --> 01:40:01,924
Because the bus went off the road
and crashed.

1454
01:40:02,354 --> 01:40:03,731
You remember this?

1455
01:40:07,943 --> 01:40:09,714
Yes.

1456
01:40:11,447 --> 01:40:13,562
I do now.

1457
01:40:15,951 --> 01:40:17,820
Now that I'm telling it.

1458
01:40:32,968 --> 01:40:35,821

Thank you, Nicole.

Right now, Sam,
the thing you've got to worry about

is why she lied.

1482
