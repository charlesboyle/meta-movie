1
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:08,517
For those who haven't,
uh, read the plaque,

2
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:10,338
we'll read the plaque.

3
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,165
"Here men from the planet Earth

4
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,626
first set foot upon the moon

5
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,494
July 1969.

6
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,197
We came in peace for all mankind. "

7
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,409
# It's the end of the world #

8
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,072
#As we know it #

9
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,065
# It's the end of the world #

10
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,769
#As we know it #

11
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:42,430
# It's the end of the world... #

12
00:02:44,508 --> 00:02:46,837
#And I feel fine... ##

13
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,102
If this isn't an insanely
beautiful woman,

14
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:04,786
I'm hanging up.

15
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:07,197
Sir, I... I... I think you
should listen to this.

16
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:16,341
- God damn it!
- Sir?

17
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:18,115
- Sir?
- Damn!

18
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:20,034
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

19
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,606
Come on, baby. Come on.

20
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:22,603
This better not be

21
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,176
another damn Russian spy job.

22
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:26,457
Boys from Air Traffic RES
say skies are clear.

23
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:27,901
It's the real thing.

24
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:31,043
A radio signal from another world.

25
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,775
Let... Let's not jump the gun here.

26
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,781
Get on-line with Space Command.

27
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,596
They're gonna want to know about...

28
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:38,428
Jeez, what's with the golf balls?

29
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,568
You're gonna kill me here.

30
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:41,573
Wait. wait.
This can't be right.

31
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,944
The calculated distance from source

32
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:48,368
is only 375,000 kilometers.

33
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:52,639
It's coming from the moon.

34
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,386
Who else knows about this?

35
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,467
S. E. T. I. in New Mexico
identified a signal,

36
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,901
but, uh, they're even more confused

37
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,129
than we are, sir.

38
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,051
Excuse me.

39
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:19,994
Major?

40
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:20,952
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:23,026
Radar reception has been impaired,

42
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,412
but we were able to get these.

43
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:26,854
And we estimate

44
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:29,879
that it has a diameter
of over 550 kilometers

45
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,427
and a mass roughly 1/4
the size of our moon.

46
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:35,207
What the hell is it?

47
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:36,221
A meteor?

48
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:37,234
No, sir.

49
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,712
No. Definitely not.

50
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:40,190
How do you know?

51
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:42,596
Well, sir, it's... slowing down.

52
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:44,074
It's what?

53
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,355
It's, uh... it's slowing down, sir.

54
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,912
Get me the secretary of defense.

55
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,572
Then wake him!

56
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:04,891
Hello.

57
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,413
Hi. It's me.

58
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:07,427
Hi.

59
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:09,707
What time is it there?

60
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,775
It's 2:45 in the morning.

61
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,296
<i>I know I didn't wake you. </i>

62
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:15,821
As a matter of fact, you did.

63
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:16,842
Liar.

64
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:20,854
I have a confession to make.

65
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,738
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful young brunette.

66
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,259
You didn't let her

67
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:28,160
stay up all night watching TV...

68
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,165
did you?

69
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,685
Of course not.

70
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:33,218
You're gonna come home right
after the luncheon, right?

71
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,569
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

72
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,583
Mommy?

73
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:37,111
Here's your mother.

74
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,522
Hi, honey.

75
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:42,043
Hi. I miss you.

76
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:43,108
I know.

77
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:44,922
President Whitmore's approval ratings

78
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,950
have slipped below 40%.

79
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:48,977
Even his crime bill failed to pass.

80
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:52,693
Are the salad days over for
President Whitmore? Morton?

81
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,395
Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War

82
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,055
is completely different
from leadership in politics.

83
00:05:58,181 --> 00:05:59,820
<i>Daddy let me watch Letterman. </i>

84
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:00,885
Traitor.

85
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:02,860
That's the problem.

86
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:03,925
They elected a warrior,
and they got a wimp.

87
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:06,703
Good morning, George.

88
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:08,223
Good morning, Mr. President.

89
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,215
That game couldn't have been pretty.

90
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,116
Ha ha. Thank you, sir.

91
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,506
Connie, you're up awfully
early this morning.

92
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:20,347
They're not attacking your policies.

93
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,195
They're attacking your age.

94
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:24,729
"Whitmore seems less like the president

95
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,261
and more like the orphan child Oliver

96
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:30,732
asking, 'Please, sir,
I'd like some more. "'

97
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:31,745
That's clever.

98
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,433
Yeah, well, I'm not laughing.

99
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,734
Age was never an issue

100
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:36,472
when you stuck to your guns.

101
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,238
You were thought of
as young, idealistic.

102
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:41,277
Now the message has gotten lost.

103
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:44,316
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.

104
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,835
Isn't it amazing

105
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:48,673
how quickly everyone
can turn against you?

106
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:51,036
Excuse me, Mr. President.

107
00:06:51,374 --> 00:06:53,611
It's the secretary of defense.

108
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:56,904
Yes.

109
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,265
Can you say that again?

110
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:33,629
Station WXBY out here in Brooklyn.

111
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,867
Station WXBY out here in Brooklyn.

112
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:38,400
The temperature is 95
degrees in Central Park.

113
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,953
What it is here in the borough,

114
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:40,966
God only knows.

115
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,199
Let's go to Nick Jones.

116
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:45,525
He'll give us a traffic
report to the beaches...

117
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:47,383
So why are you waiting? Hmm?

118
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:49,544
My social security will expire,

119
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,571
you'll still be sitting there.

120
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:53,047
I'm thinking.

121
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:54,568
Yeah, well, think already.

122
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:03,854
Dad, do you have any idea

123
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,626
how long it takes for
those cups to decompose?

124
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:07,062
If you don't move soon,

125
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:08,244
<i>I'm gonna start to decompose. </i>

126
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,257
OK.

127
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:15,380
Listen, David,

128
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:18,376
I've been meaning to talk with you.

129
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:21,322
It's nice that you see
me so much now, but...

130
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,681
Don't... Don't start, Dad.

131
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:23,821
I'm only saying it's been, what,

132
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,214
four years?

133
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:26,902
You're still wearing your wedding band?

134
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,957
Three years.

135
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,322
All right, three, four.
You're divorced.

136
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,095
Come on, move on.
This is not healthy.

137
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:34,374
<i>No, this is not healthy. </i>
Smoking is not healthy.

138
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,016
Checkmate.

139
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,239
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

140
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:42,866
wait a minute.

141
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,544
Wait, wait, wait.
This is not...

142
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:45,725
This is not checkmate.

143
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:46,899
See you tomorrow, Pop.

144
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:49,575
Now, just hold on.
This is not checkmate.

145
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,691
Ahh, checkmate.

146
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:54,459
Yes, we've got everybody we have

147
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,004
Yes, we've got everybody we have

148
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:56,081
working on the problem.

149
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,675
We are doing every...

150
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:00,190
<i>I love X- Files, too. </i>
I hope you get to see it.

151
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:01,866
Good morning. Compact Cable.

152
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:03,376
Anna will take care of you.
David. David.

153
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,884
What the hell's the
point of having a beeper

154
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,184
if you're not gonna turn it on?

155
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:08,022
It was turned on. I was ignoring you.

156
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,203
Hello.
What's the, uh...

157
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,712
What's the big emergency?

158
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:12,222
It started this morning.

159
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,235
Every station's making
like it's the 1950s.

160
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:16,247
We got static. We got snow.

161
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:17,581
All kinds of distortions.

162
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,922
- Nobody knows...
- Marty...

163
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:20,063
What the hell are you doing?

164
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:21,103
There's a reason

165
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:22,276
we have bins labeled "recycle. "

166
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:23,786
What the hell is going on?

167
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:24,792
My God in heaven.

168
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:27,810
So sue me. David!
We got a problem.

169
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,325
Did you try to switch
transponder channels?

170
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,339
Oh, please.
You think I'd be this panicked

171
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,849
if it was something simple?

172
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,246
OK. Let's point the dish
at another satellite.

173
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:39,097
We tried that. It didn't work.

174
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:41,487
It's almost as though
they weren't even there.

175
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:44,295
All right. All right.
What've we got here?

176
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:50,500
This is impossible.

177
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,519
We created a race of robots.

178
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:54,526
Their function...

179
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,656
Miguel, the signal's all screwed up.

180
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:58,341
Stop it.
Just leave it alone.

181
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,101
You're gonna break it, all right?

182
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,401
It's so fuzzy.

183
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:10,667
Oh, no.

184
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,611
Good morning, Lucas.

185
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:19,117
You see these?

186
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:21,632
I got a whole god damn
crop full of these.

187
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,638
If your father's not in the air

188
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:25,135
in 20 minutes...

189
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:26,983
I'm getting someone else.

190
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,887
Hey!

191
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:36,890
Russell!

192
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,729
Hey, Miguel!

193
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:42,281
Ha ha ha ha ha!

194
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,446
Russell!
What are you doing?

195
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,589
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

196
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,265
It's the wrong field, you idiot.

197
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:21,107
Lucas' farm is on the
other side of town.

198
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,675
Are you sure?

199
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:07,255
CNS is running a story
that we're covering up

200
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:08,935
some type of nuclear testing experiment.

201
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,440
Tell them to run with it

202
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,945
if they want to embarrass themselves.

203
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:13,953
NASA's been on my butt all morning.

204
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:15,457
They want to know our position.

205
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,962
Our official position is

206
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,458
we have no official position.

207
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,465
Connie, what is going on here?

208
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,471
Come on, would I keep
you out of the loop?

209
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:24,110
- Yes, absolutely.
- In a second.

210
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:25,990
What? I can't hear you.

211
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,403
At the moment,

212
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:28,909
our satellites are somewhat unreliable.

213
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,004
Isn't it possible

214
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,010
that this thing may just pass us by?

215
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,017
What if it doesn't "pass us by"?

216
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:36,776
Let's retarget some ICBMs
to blow it outta the sky.

217
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,280
And risk turning one
dangerous falling object

218
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:39,493
into many?

219
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:40,496
We don't yet know enough

220
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:41,742
about what we're dealing with

221
00:12:41,842 --> 00:12:43,749
to make any kind of
intelligent judgments.

222
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,754
Luckily, the press is
making up their own story

223
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:46,891
at this point.

224
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,730
But that's not gonna keep.

225
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:51,231
We may need to upgrade to Defcon Three.

226
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:52,743
Absolutely.
General, contact NORAD.

227
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:54,793
You tell them we've upgraded
to Defcon Three.

228
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,049
That's not what the president said.

229
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,052
That's a little premature.

230
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,131
I don't think so.

231
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:01,104
We have more than 50%
of the armed forces

232
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,142
out on weekend leave,

233
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:04,607
not to mention the commanders and troops

234
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:05,828
that are in town for
the 4th of July parade.

235
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,283
Go ahead, Commander.

236
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:08,453
Our intelligence tells us

237
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:09,715
the object has settled
into a stationary orbit.

238
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,219
Well, that's good news.

239
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:12,549
Uh, not really, sir.

240
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:13,810
Part of it has broken off

241
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:15,016
into nearly three dozen other pieces...

242
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:16,027
smaller than the whole, sir,

243
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,667
yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

244
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,884
Where are they heading?

245
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:27,347
They should be entering our atmosphere

246
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:29,362
within the next 25 minutes.

247
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:00,084
This better be good.

248
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:01,423
Captain on deck!

249
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:07,233
Sir, we're looking at
a total radar blackout

250
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,738
over a 13 kilometer area.

251
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,243
Let's do a diagnostic check...

252
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:11,413
Excuse me, sir.

253
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:12,918
The radar may be malfunctioning,

254
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,038
but the infrared

255
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:15,886
is totally off the map.

256
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:20,899
Jeez.

257
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:25,522
Get me Atlantic Command on the line.

258
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:30,270
Hang on, sir.

259
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:31,937
Sir, we have visual range

260
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:33,602
with incoming over Iraqi airspace.

261
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,845
Second sighting?

262
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:38,102
Yes, sir. This just came
in from the Persian Gulf.

263
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:39,309
Correction, sir.

264
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,308
We now have two confirmed
visual contacts.

265
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:42,675
That's affirmative. Mr. President.

266
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,174
They're tracking another one
off the California coastline.

267
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:48,173
All right, go ahead.
Put it on.

268
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,181
General, you might want to watch this.

269
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:53,880
Ladies and gentlemen...

270
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:55,380
ladies and gentlemen,

271
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,971
we are interrupting
our regular broadcast

272
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,637
to bring you extraordinary events

273
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,719
taking place in the Russian Republic.

274
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:02,253
This unexplained disturbance

275
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:03,510
and the hysteria that it's causing

276
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:04,709
are incredible.

277
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,209
How would you describe

278
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,251
what you're seeing?

279
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:09,216
It is clearing the mountains...

280
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,207
moving too slowly

281
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:13,706
to be a comet or meteor.

282
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:17,214
Widespread panic has
gripped the countryside

283
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,713
as thousands have taken to the streets.

284
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,205
It is confirmed.

285
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:22,920
The unexplained phenomenon

286
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,419
is headed for Moscow.

287
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:25,419
Mr. President,

288
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:26,919
we have an AWAC off the West Coast.

289
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:30,292
ETA with contact point: three minutes.

290
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,292
I don't understand it, sir.

291
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,291
Side radar doesn't see it.

292
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,291
I know. It's blind, sir.

293
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,791
Nothing is registering.

294
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,291
Negative.
We have zero visibility.

295
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:40,790
Visibility is at... zero.

296
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,156
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

297
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:46,155
Captain, the president is listening.

298
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,204
Repeat what you just told me.

299
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:52,285
We still have zero visibility.

300
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:56,118
Instrumentation is malfunctioning.

301
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:59,117
We can't get any kind of reading

302
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:00,367
of what's in front of us.

303
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,526
Wait a minute.

304
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,824
May be clearing.

305
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,029
Pull up! Pull up!

306
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,109
Line's gone, sir.

307
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,108
Two more have been
spotted over the Atlantic.

308
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,399
One's moving toward New York,

309
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:30,482
the other's headed this direction.

310
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:31,482
How much time do we have?

311
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:32,481
Less than 10 minutes.

312
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:34,139
Alex, organize a military escort.

313
00:16:34,238 --> 00:16:35,605
Mr. President, I strongly recommend

314
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:37,439
we move you to a secure
location immediately.

315
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:38,897
Connie, can we expect

316
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:40,888
the same kind of panic we saw in Russia?

317
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:42,062
More than likely.

318
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,561
We can discuss this on the way.

319
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:46,178
I'm not leaving.

320
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:48,102
We have to maintain a
working government...

321
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:50,101
I want you to get the vice president,

322
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:51,600
the whole cabinet, and joint chiefs,

323
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:53,682
and take them to a secured location.

324
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:54,724
I'm staying.

325
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,891
I don't want to add to a public hysteria

326
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,057
that's gonna cost lives.

327
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:00,057
Connie.

328
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,223
Yes, sir?

329
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:02,223
We'll initiate

330
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:03,347
the Emergency Broadcast System.

331
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:04,555
We'll advise people not to panic.

332
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,554
The best idea right now

333
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:08,337
is to stay in their homes.

334
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:09,836
Yes, sir.
Roy. Dean.

335
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:11,836
And, Alex, you contact
the cabinet members.

336
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:12,885
Have them rendezvous here.

337
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,127
We'll take them to NORAD.

338
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:16,426
Mr. President, with your permission,

339
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:19,259
I'd like to remain at your side.

340
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,508
I had a feeling you would.

341
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,755
And what happens if
they do become hostile?

342
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,087
Then God help us.

343
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:34,620
There it is, the strange
atmospheric phenomenon.

344
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,621
It is apparently what has been causing

345
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,211
all the distortions in our broadcasts.

346
00:17:38,378 --> 00:17:39,877
David, are you watching this?

347
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,501
Not to react

348
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,158
in a manner of cold fear.

349
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:46,658
We have no evidence

350
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:49,157
that these phenomena
are endangering anyone.

351
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:51,822
Thus far, reports of aggression...

352
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:53,321
Marty, listen to this.

353
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:55,321
I got a lock on the
pattern of that signal,

354
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:56,579
so we can filter it out.

355
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:58,362
But if my calculations are right,

356
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:00,828
it's going to be gone in,
like, seven hours anyway.

357
00:18:00,952 --> 00:18:02,993
It's reducing itself
every time it recycles,

358
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:05,451
so eventually it's gonna disappear...

359
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:06,484
You listening?

360
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:08,200
Can you believe this?

361
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,365
David, haven't you been watching?

362
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,530
David!

363
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:15,656
General.

364
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,322
Good afternoon.

365
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:20,271
So far, the phenomenon has
not caused any damage.

366
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,694
We have to ask you to try to stay calm,

367
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:24,486
and it's important for
everyone not to panic.

368
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:26,859
We have a fix on three
of the occurrences

369
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:28,101
about to appear over American cities.

370
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:29,525
It's just unreal.

371
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,025
Hey, Miguel, come here.

372
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,024
One is headed towards Los Angeles.

373
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,266
The other two are on
our eastern seaboard

374
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,607
headed towards New York
and Washington, D. C.

375
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:38,190
headed towards New York
and Washington, D. C.

376
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:39,690
Marty.

377
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,190
Marty. Jamie says

378
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:43,188
this building has an old bomb shelter.

379
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:45,188
We're heading down there now.

380
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:48,145
All right. Um, everybody,
head down to the basement.

381
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,811
Take it slow. Don't run.

382
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,686
Walk down to the basement.

383
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:55,517
There's no shame in hiding.

384
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:58,019
Oh, I better call my mother.

385
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:12,347
Well, look who we have here.

386
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:16,671
Hey, Russ, I heard

387
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:18,631
you had a little trouble this morning.

388
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,638
Dusted the wrong field.

389
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:24,629
I know you're probably
still a little confused

390
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,294
from your hostage experience.

391
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:27,294
Hostage experience?

392
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:30,252
Did something happen to you, Russ?

393
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:32,168
Oh, yeah. Seems years back,

394
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:33,251
our boy was kidnapped by aliens.

395
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,249
Did all kinds of experiments on him.

396
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:37,250
Tell them about it, Russ.

397
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,674
Get a couple beers in him,

398
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:39,841
he'll tell you all about it.

399
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:41,882
Crazy stuff. Won't you, Russ?

400
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:42,957
Russ...

401
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,331
when they took you up
in their spaceship,

402
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:46,830
did they do any...

403
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,796
sexual things, do you recall?

404
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,330
Do you recollect?

405
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,827
Oh, Russ!

406
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:58,295
Ha ha ha ha ha!

407
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,123
Let's get outta here.

408
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:13,790
What's going on?

409
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,405
What's that?

410
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:24,454
Let's get outta here.
Come on.

411
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:27,537
Oh, wow.

412
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,071
Mommy! Lookit!

413
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:52,155
Mmm...

414
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:56,321
It's too early, baby.

415
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,395
Is it a earthquake?

416
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,860
Not even a four pointer.

417
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:07,393
Go back to sleep.

418
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:08,526
Mmm...

419
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:24,397
Daddy!

420
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:29,229
What are you doing here?

421
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:31,227
You should be down in the shelter.

422
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:32,603
What's going on?

423
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:54,181
Come on!
Pass it over here, man!

424
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:55,714
Come on! Come on!

425
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:07,345
Aren't you coming, David?

426
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,635
No. I gotta see this.

427
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,379
That's cool, man!

428
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:12,702
You jerk!

429
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:36,654
The signal.

430
00:23:38,404 --> 00:23:39,237
My God.

431
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:58,857
Now what do we do?

432
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,357
Address the nation. There's gonna be

433
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:04,182
a lot of frightened people out there.

434
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:05,813
Yeah.

435
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:07,980
I'm one of them.

436
00:24:10,687 --> 00:24:12,138
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

437
00:24:12,237 --> 00:24:14,636
He's just trying to impress you.

438
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:17,636
If you want to impress me,
you need to get a job

439
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:20,060
and stop slobbering all over my shoe.

440
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:37,964
I don't believe this. Jasmine.

441
00:24:38,063 --> 00:24:39,972
Neighbors moving out.

442
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:42,921
Guess they finally got tired
of all these quakes.

443
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,420
A little shake, and they running.

444
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,052
Police and the fire departments

445
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:52,335
are asking everyone to
stay off the phone.

446
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:54,801
Baby, there's something on
the news about the quake.

447
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:57,334
The police are asking
us not to call 911.

448
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:58,508
What's up, man?

449
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,216
What you been doing out there?

450
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:02,550
Shooting the aliens.

451
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:03,757
Oh, you shooting aliens, right?

452
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:05,048
You think you tough, huh?

453
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:08,047
What you got? Turn around.
Let me see what you got.

454
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,048
Come on, Boomer.

455
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,081
Let's get you something to eat.

456
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:11,713
Mmm.
Oh, now, watch out.

457
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:13,046
Watch it now, baby.

458
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:14,621
I'll go grab the paper.

459
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,796
All right.

460
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:19,462
Darn...

461
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,083
Honey, let's go!

462
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:52,737
Babe, you want some of this coffee?

463
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:54,244
Babe.

464
00:25:57,326 --> 00:25:58,659
Boom! Boom! Boom!

465
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,901
Pentagon officials

466
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,367
are reporting more
ships have just arrived

467
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:05,867
over the capitals of India,

468
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:07,366
England, and Germany,

469
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,365
bringing estimates up to
anywhere from 10 to 15

470
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:12,814
of these city-sized spacecraft.

471
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:14,272
I know, Ma.

472
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,696
Just try and stay calm.

473
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:17,696
Tell her to pack up and leave town.

474
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:19,154
Why? What happened?

475
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,654
Just do it!

476
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,154
Oh, Ma. Ma, listen.

477
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,820
Get your stuff together
and head for Aunt Esther's.

478
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:26,986
Don't argue with me. Just go!

479
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:30,818
David, why did I just
send my mother to Atlanta?

480
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:31,985
David.

481
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,526
David, talk to me.

482
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:34,984
Did you hear me tell you

483
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:36,475
that the signal hidden
in the satellite feed

484
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:37,975
is slowly recycling down to extinction?

485
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:38,891
Not really.

486
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,391
It's a countdown.

487
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,566
A countdown?

488
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:44,223
Wait. A countdown to what, David?

489
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:46,056
Uh, it's like in chess:

490
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:48,556
First you strategically
position your pieces,

491
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:50,555
then, when the timing's right,

492
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:51,688
you strike.

493
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:53,145
See?

494
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:55,978
They're positioning
themselves all over the world

495
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:58,885
using this one signal to
synchronize their efforts.

496
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,385
In approximately six hours,

497
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,428
the signal's going to disappear,

498
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:03,052
and the countdown's going to be over.

499
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:04,685
And then what?

500
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:08,600
Checkmate.

501
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:11,849
Oh, my God.

502
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:13,141
Oh, my God!

503
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:14,848
I've got to call my brother.

504
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:16,347
I'd better call my housekeeper.

505
00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:17,847
I gotta call my lawyer.

506
00:27:17,972 --> 00:27:19,346
Eh, forget my lawyer.

507
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,347
Ladies and gentlemen,

508
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,306
the president of the United States.

509
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:24,643
Good afternoon.

510
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,323
My fellow Americans,

511
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:31,341
a historic and unprecedented
event has occurred.

512
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:32,847
The question of whether or not

513
00:27:32,972 --> 00:27:34,304
we're alone in the universe

514
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,894
has been answered.

515
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:37,368
Although it's understandable

516
00:27:37,493 --> 00:27:40,714
that many of us feel a sense
of hesitation or even fear,

517
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:43,324
we must attempt to reserve judgment...

518
00:27:43,424 --> 00:27:46,316
He says he's your husband.

519
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,793
Oh, God.

520
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:52,435
What do you want?

521
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,561
You got to leave the White House.

522
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:56,152
This is hardly the time nor the place

523
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:57,532
to be having that same old discussion!

524
00:27:57,633 --> 00:27:58,629
You don't understand.

525
00:27:58,755 --> 00:27:59,675
You got to leave Washington.

526
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,978
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

527
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:03,485
we are having a little crisis here.

528
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,991
They're communicating
with a hidden signal.

529
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,331
They're going to attack.

530
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:07,746
You are just being paranoid!

531
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:10,516
It's not paranoia.
The embedding's very subtle.

532
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:11,855
It's probably been overlooked. If...

533
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:21,565
Marty, what are you doing?

534
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:23,022
Get out of town as soon as you can.

535
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:24,705
- Please.
- OK, OK.

536
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,078
My staff and I will
remain in the White House

537
00:28:26,178 --> 00:28:27,927
as we attempt to
establish communication.

538
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:32,062
If you feel compelled
to leave these cities,

539
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:34,331
please do so in an orderly fashion.

540
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:41,110
Hey! What's going on?

541
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:43,238
Excuse me.

542
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:44,418
Coming through.

543
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:47,612
The arrival of the alien visitors

544
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:49,600
has caused over 10,000 fender-benders

545
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,023
in just a few seconds' time,

546
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:52,613
but this is just the beginning...

547
00:28:52,713 --> 00:28:53,792
Uh-uh. Come on, now, you can't go.

548
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:54,797
Uh-uh. Come on, now, you can't go.

549
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:55,885
You got to call them back.

550
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:58,773
I'm not going to do
this with you, Jasmine.

551
00:28:58,898 --> 00:29:00,405
I've got to report to El Toro.

552
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,457
But you said you was
on leave for the 4th.

553
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:03,838
Yeah, well, they canceled it!

554
00:29:06,265 --> 00:29:08,392
Look, why are you acting like this?

555
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:10,787
Why?

556
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,845
<i>That's why. </i>

557
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,687
Look...

558
00:29:25,812 --> 00:29:27,360
I really don't think

559
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:29,201
they flew 90 billion light years

560
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:30,709
to come down here and start a fight

561
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,261
and get all rowdy.

562
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:35,849
Look, why don't you just relax?

563
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:37,782
I'm going to report to El Toro

564
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:39,749
and find out what's going on.

565
00:29:43,224 --> 00:29:44,395
What are you doing in there, man?

566
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:45,944
Nothing. I'm just driving.

567
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:48,907
Honk honk!

568
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,581
Look. Here, I got these for you.

569
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:51,753
Firecrackers.

570
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:53,093
Now, you be careful.

571
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:54,147
Steve, wait.

572
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:55,771
I want to tell you something.

573
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:57,537
What is it, Jasmine?

574
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:03,147
You take care of yourself, you hear?

575
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:07,783
Look, um...

576
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:10,127
why don't you get some things packed,

577
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,269
and you and Dylan come stay
with me on the base.

578
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:15,994
And you will see that

579
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:17,326
there is nothing to be scared of.

580
00:30:17,426 --> 00:30:18,590
Really?

581
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:21,343
You don't mind?

582
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,849
Well, I mean, uh...

583
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,242
We'll have to let all
my other girlfriends know

584
00:30:26,342 --> 00:30:27,923
that they can't come over, you know,

585
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:29,932
and got to postpone
a little freaky-deaky.

586
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:31,472
There you go.

587
00:30:31,573 --> 00:30:32,980
There he goes, thinking you all that.

588
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,486
But you are not

589
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:36,454
as charming as you think you are, sir.

590
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:38,554
Yes, I am.

591
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:40,973
Them big ol' Dumbo ears.

592
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,200
Well, look at you with
them chicken legs.

593
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,498
Baw-caw.

594
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:53,706
Come on, Dylan, honey.

595
00:30:57,514 --> 00:30:59,606
Look out!
Look out!

596
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:08,138
- What?
- Hey!

597
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:09,652
The television said

598
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:11,159
they started the looting already.

599
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:12,449
Vultures.

600
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,628
You still have the Plymouth?

601
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:15,678
You want to borrow the car?

602
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:16,767
David, you don't have a license.

603
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:17,980
You're driving.

604
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,989
Yeah, I'm driv... I'm driving?

605
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:20,993
Come on, come on.

606
00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:25,005
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

607
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:26,965
You're staying there
to keep people calm.

608
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:28,425
It's the right thing to do.

609
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,168
I'm not going to let them
criticize you for it.

610
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:31,837
I appreciate your trying to help me.

611
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:33,470
Liar. Stick to the truth.

612
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:35,097
It's what you're good at.

613
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:36,215
All right.
I'll tell you the truth.

614
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:37,675
I don't want you in any
one of those cities.

615
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:41,601
I'll leave as soon as
the interviews are done.

616
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:43,929
All right. There's a helicopter waiting.

617
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,765
They're going to take you to Nellis.

618
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,108
And the munchkin?

619
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:48,275
She's going to meet you there.

620
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,435
All right.

621
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,361
I love you.

622
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:52,938
I love you.

623
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:53,988
Bye.

624
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,440
Communication attempts in 30 languages

625
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,898
over all common frequencies have failed.

626
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,908
Bye.

627
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:02,966
It's the White House,

628
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:04,614
You can't just drive up and ring a bell.

629
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,303
Can't this thing go any faster?

630
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,783
What, you think they don't
know what you know?

631
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:08,959
They know. Believe me, they know.

632
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,126
She works for the president.

633
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:11,502
They know everything.

634
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:12,871
They don't know this.

635
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:14,456
Oh, oh. You're going
to educate them, huh?

636
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:15,956
So tell me something.

637
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:16,965
You're so smart,

638
00:32:17,091 --> 00:32:18,300
how come you spend eight years at M. I. T.

639
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:19,675
to become a cable repairman?

640
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,127
All I'm saying is they got people

641
00:32:21,227 --> 00:32:22,712
who handle these things, David.

642
00:32:22,812 --> 00:32:24,847
They want HBO, they'll call you.

643
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:27,433
Look at these people.
Look. Huh?

644
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:28,468
Vultures.

645
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:29,719
They take, and then they go.

646
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:30,719
Yeah. They're going.

647
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:31,762
They're going faster than we are.

648
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:33,054
Look at this.
We're in the fast lane.

649
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:34,354
They're cutting me off here.

650
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,023
No one's cutting you off.
We're going to get a ticket.

651
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:37,149
They're getting in front of me.

652
00:32:37,274 --> 00:32:38,358
I can't go any faster.

653
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:39,601
All right. All right.
I don't want to argue.

654
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:42,069
Let's just get there
as quickly as possible.

655
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:43,104
What's the rush?

656
00:32:43,203 --> 00:32:44,363
You think we'll get to Washington,

657
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:46,157
it won't be there?

658
00:32:46,282 --> 00:32:47,783
A local crop duster

659
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,068
was arrested today

660
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,286
as he papered city hall
with leaflets from the air.

661
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:52,496
Everybody's leaving.

662
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:53,496
Can you give us some of your time?

663
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:54,539
Do you want to make a statement?

664
00:32:54,663 --> 00:32:55,831
We've got to stop them!

665
00:32:55,956 --> 00:32:58,834
I was kidnapped by space
aliens 10 years ago.

666
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:00,911
They did all kinds of experiments on me.

667
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,746
They've been studying us for years,

668
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:04,122
finding out our weaknesses.

669
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:05,624
We've gotta stop them!

670
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,500
They're gonna kill us all!

671
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,794
Some people attribute
his eccentric behavior

672
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:11,795
to post-traumatic stress syndrome

673
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:14,055
from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.

674
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:16,653
Others, however, have
a more unusual theory.

675
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:18,342
How would you describe Mr. Casse?

676
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:19,843
- Private.
- Keeps to himself.

677
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:21,344
- Real quiet.
- Quiet.

678
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:23,188
When they took him up in the spaceship,

679
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:26,858
the aliens abused him...

680
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:28,434
sexually.

681
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:30,403
Mr. Casse is in the county lockup

682
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:31,686
this evening...

683
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:33,522
Pack up. We're leaving.

684
00:33:33,622 --> 00:33:35,447
Due to extenuating circumstances,

685
00:33:35,573 --> 00:33:36,983
he may be released later tonight.

686
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,951
Miguel, what about Dad?

687
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:43,079
This could be our last night on Earth.

688
00:33:44,664 --> 00:33:47,041
You don't want to die a virgin...

689
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,042
do you?

690
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,669
Come on. We're going.

691
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,620
No. I'm not going anywhere.

692
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,184
Miguel!

693
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:54,339
Stop it!

694
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,301
Thanks a lot, partner.

695
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:05,256
You read my mind!

696
00:34:05,356 --> 00:34:07,475
Stay here.

697
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:10,145
We got to get as far away
from these things as we can.

698
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:11,679
They let you out?

699
00:34:11,779 --> 00:34:13,180
You're damn right.

700
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,140
They got bigger fish to fry now,

701
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,524
believe you me.

702
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:17,315
Come on, boy.

703
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:19,610
Once again, the L. A. P. D.
is asking Los Angelenos

704
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:22,563
not to fire their guns
at the visitor spacecraft.

705
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:25,573
You may inadvertently
trigger an interstellar war.

706
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:28,318
Think we can find something better

707
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:29,527
to do with our time, gentlemen?

708
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:31,454
Where you been, Stevie?

709
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,955
Man, this is unbelievable.

710
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:34,456
This is, like, huge.

711
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:35,957
They've recalled everybody.

712
00:34:36,082 --> 00:34:38,001
Oh. Well, looks like the
mail's still working.

713
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,044
Oh. Oh, oh.

714
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,423
Uh, you got to do
the honors for me, man.

715
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:46,925
You're a wuss.

716
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,926
Yeah, whatever.
Shut up and read it.

717
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:50,170
It says...

718
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,172
"Captain Steven Hiller, "

719
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:53,389
loser.

720
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:54,931
"United States Marine Corps... "

721
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:56,223
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

722
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:59,226
"We regret to inform you

723
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:02,145
that despite your excellent
record of service... "

724
00:35:04,564 --> 00:35:06,037
I'm sorry, man.

725
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,735
You know what you need to do?

726
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,445
You need to, like, kiss
some serious booty

727
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,821
to get ahead in this world, man.

728
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:14,448
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

729
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:16,449
See, I like the one-knee approach

730
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,451
because it puts the booty, like,

731
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:19,952
right in front of the lips...

732
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,613
What's this?

733
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:23,789
- That's nothing.
- Hold on.

734
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:24,907
Hold on, man.
What is this?

735
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:26,909
Jasmine kind of has
a thing for dolphins.

736
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,368
I don't know.

737
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:31,128
Stevie, this is a wedding ring.

738
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:37,467
I thought you said you were going

739
00:35:37,592 --> 00:35:39,468
to break the whole thing off.

740
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,969
Yeah...

741
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,809
Man, you know I really like Jasmine.

742
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:47,396
You know that, right?

743
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:51,164
Man, you're never going to get to fly

744
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:53,823
the Space Shuttle if
you marry a stripper.

745
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,462
... "it could only happen
in California" file,

746
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,457
here's Wendy Walsh
with a special report.

747
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:06,460
Below us,

748
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,888
we can see hundreds of UFO fanatics

749
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:09,892
who have gathered on rooftops

750
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:11,228
here in downtown Los Angeles

751
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:13,022
to welcome the new arrivals.

752
00:36:13,148 --> 00:36:15,526
Oh, God! I hope they bring back Elvis!

753
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:18,156
I just came in to get my check tonight,

754
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:19,575
and I got talked into working.

755
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,871
Oh, I must have been tripping.

756
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:23,365
It's being called

757
00:36:23,465 --> 00:36:24,868
the party event of the century,

758
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,829
and everyone is invited,
especially you know who.

759
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:28,374
This is so cool.

760
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:29,501
Girl, please.

761
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:33,766
Oh, hey. I made it before
I came in tonight.

762
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,137
Check it out.

763
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,140
Now I know you're not

764
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,476
thinking about joining those idiots.

765
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:42,530
Oh, I am going over there
as soon as I get off.

766
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:43,545
You want to come?

767
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:44,576
Tiffany, listen to me a sec.

768
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,957
I have got a really
bad feeling about this.

769
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:49,994
I don't want you to go.

770
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:51,997
Oh, like the really bad feeling you got

771
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:53,918
when I went to Las Vegas?

772
00:36:54,018 --> 00:36:55,260
Yeah, and I was right.
You didn't get the job,

773
00:36:55,428 --> 00:36:57,382
and you lost all your money gambling.

774
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:01,555
Yeah, but I wasn't in L. A.
for the earthquake.

775
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:04,193
Tiff, I really don't
want you to go up there.

776
00:37:10,287 --> 00:37:11,330
Everyone in the world

777
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,449
is trying to get out of Washington.

778
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:14,085
We're the only schmucks
trying to get in.

779
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:16,673
... should establish some
line of communication.

780
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:18,300
What the hell is that?

781
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:21,756
Pops, this is every
phone book in America.

782
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:22,800
You think an important
person like Constance

783
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,477
is going to be listed?

784
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:26,535
She always keeps her portable phone

785
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,059
listed for emergencies.

786
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,520
Sometimes it's just her first initial.

787
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,524
Sometimes it's her nickname.

788
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,993
Sometimes it's just her...

789
00:37:44,678 --> 00:37:47,467
So... you want to ring the bell

790
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:48,686
or should I?

791
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:51,690
Hmm?

792
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:52,985
Oh, perfect. She's using it.

793
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:54,437
Perfect. What's perfect?
It's busy.

794
00:37:54,537 --> 00:37:56,156
Yeah. I can use her signal

795
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,370
to triangulate her exact
position in the White House.

796
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,221
You can do that?

797
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,347
Yeah.

798
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,172
All cable repairmen can, Pops.

799
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,008
The visitors have arrived,

800
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:08,762
but the president remains
at the White House.

801
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:13,888
Question: Are Mr. Whitmore's
actions A... ultra brave...

802
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:16,566
or B... foolhardy?

803
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:17,568
What?

804
00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:20,072
Now, don't hang up, sweetie.

805
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,658
David. How did you get this number?

806
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:23,202
Do me a favor. Walk to the window.

807
00:38:23,495 --> 00:38:26,324
And I'm looking for what?

808
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:28,337
You'll see.

809
00:38:28,462 --> 00:38:30,382
Over here.

810
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:32,969
See us?

811
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:36,342
How does he do that?

812
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:39,272
Reporting live from
Andrews Air Force Base

813
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:41,142
just outside Washington, D. C...

814
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:43,571
Yes, that's right, Tom,
an amazing moment.

815
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,240
We're reporting from
Andrews Air Force Base...

816
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:46,617
Now in light of our apparent inability

817
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,112
to communicate with the visitors,

818
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:49,248
Pentagon officials

819
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:51,459
have retrofit this skylift helicopter

820
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:54,171
with a type of visual
communications device.

821
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,383
Mr. President.

822
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:56,426
Be seated.

823
00:38:56,552 --> 00:38:58,046
This is not a military aircraft...

824
00:38:58,146 --> 00:38:59,549
Where are we now?

825
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:01,350
They're just commencing liftoff.

826
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:02,853
and refitted

827
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:04,264
with these enormous
light panels that are

828
00:39:04,364 --> 00:39:07,144
attached to the hull and onto the sides.

829
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,230
Echo One,

830
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:09,274
Welcome Wagon is in the air.

831
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:11,452
I repeat. Welcome Wagon is in the air.

832
00:39:11,577 --> 00:39:12,905
Roger, Welcome Wagon.

833
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:15,000
Echo One right beside you.

834
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,118
This is something

835
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:17,120
I would never believe in my lifetime,

836
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,714
that I would be in the White House.

837
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,175
Look at this.

838
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:22,471
If I knew I was going
to meet the president,

839
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:24,306
I would have worn a tie.

840
00:39:24,432 --> 00:39:26,352
I mean, look at me.
I look like a schlemiel.

841
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:27,854
You look fine, Pops.

842
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:29,816
Oy, my God.

843
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:31,653
David, I don't know how happy
he's going to be to see you.

844
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:32,863
That's right. I'm telling you,

845
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:33,865
we're wasting time.

846
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,867
He's not going to listen to me.

847
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:35,868
We should go.

848
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:36,869
Why wouldn't he listen?

849
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:37,872
'Cause last time I saw him,

850
00:39:37,997 --> 00:39:38,873
we, uh, we got into a fight.

851
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:39,875
You walked in the room

852
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,877
and punched him in the head.

853
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:42,003
You punched the president?

854
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,248
He wasn't the president then.

855
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,218
I punched him, he fought back.

856
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,719
We wrestled around. It was a fight.

857
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:47,923
A fight that you started,

858
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:49,476
because David thought that
I was having an affair.

859
00:39:49,684 --> 00:39:50,636
With the president?

860
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:51,688
Which, of course, I wasn't.

861
00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:53,524
You know, either go get him,

862
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:54,734
or we should head back to the car.

863
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,362
All right. I'll get him.
You wait here,

864
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:58,023
and don't touch anything.

865
00:39:58,122 --> 00:40:00,402
You punched the president?

866
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:02,080
<i>Mein Gott! </i>

867
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,173
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.

868
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:13,341
We're closing in.

869
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:14,435
Roger that.

870
00:40:14,643 --> 00:40:15,970
You're a go to commence
sequence when ready.

871
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,724
The three choppers are
steadily approaching

872
00:40:17,824 --> 00:40:20,729
what has been unanimously agreed to be

873
00:40:20,828 --> 00:40:22,072
the front of these spaceships,

874
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:24,819
a parabolic indentation 9 city blocks...

875
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,155
You're leaving now?

876
00:40:27,331 --> 00:40:28,499
David, see if they got those pens

877
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,710
that they give away.

878
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:31,087
Dad, what?

879
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:35,713
I don't have time for this.

880
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:37,307
- Two minutes, Tom.
- Connie...

881
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:38,308
Mr. President.

882
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:40,061
Julius Levinson.
David is my son.

883
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,514
I told you he wouldn't listen.

884
00:40:41,614 --> 00:40:43,392
David, you have to tell him.

885
00:40:43,492 --> 00:40:44,435
Connie.

886
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:46,030
David, tell him!

887
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:51,665
Uh, I know why we have
satellite disruption.

888
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:55,755
All right. Go ahead.

889
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,790
OK.

890
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,627
Um...

891
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:02,090
Let's say that you want to
coordinate with spaceships

892
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,018
on different sides of the Earth.

893
00:41:04,143 --> 00:41:06,773
You couldn't send a
direct signal, right?

894
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:09,820
You're talking about line of sight.

895
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:11,323
Yeah, that's right. Exactly.

896
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:13,110
The curve of the Earth prevents it.

897
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,495
You'd need satellites
to relay that signal

898
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,573
in order to reach each ship.

899
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:19,120
Well, I found a signal

900
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,002
hidden inside our own satellite system.

901
00:41:24,387 --> 00:41:25,889
Excuse me, Mr. President.

902
00:41:26,015 --> 00:41:28,310
They're starting.

903
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:33,737
They're using our own
satellites against us...

904
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:38,703
and the clock is ticking.

905
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:44,538
Bringing it in to hover.

906
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:45,540
Welcome Wagon, Echo One.

907
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,801
Approaching alien ship.

908
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:51,850
Initiating communications
sequence, Echo One.

909
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:55,900
Welcome Wagon has commenced.

910
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:03,620
General Grey, coordinate
with the Atlantic Command.

911
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,624
Tell them to evacuate as many people

912
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,627
out of the cities as they can.

913
00:42:07,794 --> 00:42:08,795
Yes, sir.

914
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,131
Get those helicopters
away from the ship.

915
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:11,634
Call them back immediately.

916
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:13,136
What the hell's going on?

917
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:14,764
We're leaving. Kim, my daughter.

918
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,729
Uh, there's something happening here.

919
00:42:22,611 --> 00:42:23,521
They're responding.

920
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:24,523
Something's opening.

921
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:26,283
Something is happening.

922
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,909
It looks like there's some
kind of activity here.

923
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:33,037
This may be some type
of response, Echo One.

924
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:35,174
We see it, too. Can't identify it.

925
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:48,571
We are evacuating.

926
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:49,574
I repeat.

927
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:50,902
We are evacuating the White House.

928
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53,164
Load the rest of the staff

929
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:55,959
in the second helicopter.

930
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:57,838
Who should we pick?

931
00:42:57,963 --> 00:42:59,792
Is my wife in the air?

932
00:42:59,892 --> 00:43:01,052
She will be shortly.

933
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:02,387
Nice. Very nice.

934
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:04,842
OK. Buckle up. Latch secure.

935
00:43:04,942 --> 00:43:07,520
Look, we have our own phone.

936
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:12,154
Let's move outta here!

937
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,078
The president's ordered an evacuation.

938
00:43:16,203 --> 00:43:17,580
We have to leave now.

939
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:19,083
And our prayers go out

940
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,327
to the wives and children
of those brave pilots.

941
00:43:20,427 --> 00:43:22,838
Indeed, God help us all.

942
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:24,375
The visitors responded

943
00:43:24,475 --> 00:43:25,627
with terrifying...

944
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:27,631
Authorities have called for

945
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,634
a complete evacuation
of Los Angeles County.

946
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:31,136
People are advised

947
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:32,639
to avoid the highways wherever possible.

948
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:35,194
Oh, yeah. Great.
Now he tells me.

949
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,155
This is

950
00:43:42,255 --> 00:43:43,582
the Los Angeles Police Department.

951
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:47,038
Please vacate the premises immediately

952
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:49,092
for your own safety.

953
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:51,931
Take me!

954
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:53,099
Take me!

955
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:06,622
Can we move it along?

956
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:08,959
Dr. Katz's office.

957
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:10,295
Hello. Let me speak to Dr. Katz, please.

958
00:44:10,462 --> 00:44:11,629
I'm sorry.
He's not available.

959
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:12,966
Listen, for $300 an hour,
you can put me through

960
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:14,594
to his house in the Hamptons!

961
00:44:22,356 --> 00:44:25,320
This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.

962
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:26,238
Please vacate the premises immediately

963
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,275
Please vacate the premises immediately

964
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,994
for your own safety.

965
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:33,170
Mrs. Whitmore.

966
00:44:34,718 --> 00:44:36,592
You must leave now.

967
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:44,716
First lady secured. We're on the move.

968
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:55,094
Look!

969
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:56,600
They're opening up!

970
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,991
It's so pretty.

971
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,735
We gotta get the hell outta here!

972
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,961
Go ahead, pilot. We're ready
to take off right now.

973
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:58,563
Can you get a blanket for Patricia?

974
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:03,583
Here.

975
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:07,390
Over there?

976
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:20,444
Time's up.

977
00:46:46,175 --> 00:46:46,928
Get down!

978
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,508
Oh, crap.

979
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:04,619
Oh, my God.

980
00:49:04,745 --> 00:49:05,917
Come on, Dylan.
We gotta go.

981
00:49:06,503 --> 00:49:07,800
Come on, Boomer.

982
00:49:48,216 --> 00:49:49,595
Boomer!

983
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:54,407
Boomer!

984
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:23,318
Reports are unclear

985
00:50:23,443 --> 00:50:25,578
as to the extent of the devastation,

986
00:50:25,703 --> 00:50:27,083
but, from all accounts,
Los Angeles, Washington,

987
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:29,217
and New York have been left in ruins...

988
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:31,468
Good God!

989
00:50:31,568 --> 00:50:33,108
I been saying it.

990
00:50:33,234 --> 00:50:35,367
I been saying it for 10 damn years.

991
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:38,205
Ain't I been saying it, Miguel?

992
00:50:38,306 --> 00:50:39,803
Huh?
I been saying it.

993
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:42,556
Dad, I'm sick.
I don't feel good.

994
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:43,861
Pull it over, man.

995
00:50:52,522 --> 00:50:54,445
We're going to be all right, Troy.

996
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:55,952
Leave me alone, man.
I got it.

997
00:50:59,928 --> 00:51:01,636
Miguel.

998
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:03,762
Look at all that.

999
00:51:26,105 --> 00:51:29,897
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

1000
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,649
That's the advantage
of being a fighter pilot.

1001
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:37,775
In the Gulf War,

1002
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:39,484
we knew what we had to do.

1003
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:46,945
It's just... not simple anymore.

1004
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,446
A lot of people died today.

1005
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:57,116
How many didn't have to?

1006
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:01,660
Any news on my wife yet?

1007
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,161
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.

1008
00:52:07,996 --> 00:52:09,455
No radio contact.

1009
00:52:17,123 --> 00:52:19,208
Come on, Dylan.
Stay close.

1010
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:30,004
Here it is.

1011
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,431
What happened, Mommy?

1012
00:52:59,057 --> 00:53:01,933
I don't know, baby.

1013
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:03,433
You men will be

1014
00:53:03,558 --> 00:53:04,517
the first wave in our counterattack.

1015
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:07,135
Our target is to the north

1016
00:53:07,235 --> 00:53:10,519
centered above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles...

1017
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,853
You scared, man?

1018
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:15,472
No.

1019
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:17,472
You?

1020
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:18,649
Nope.

1021
00:53:18,773 --> 00:53:20,974
We will fix on our target positions...

1022
00:53:21,074 --> 00:53:22,149
Hold me.

1023
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:24,142
Hey, pay attention.

1024
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,142
Something you want to
add to this briefing,

1025
00:53:26,242 --> 00:53:27,401
Captain Hiller?

1026
00:53:27,526 --> 00:53:29,486
No, sir. I'm just a little
anxious to get up there

1027
00:53:29,693 --> 00:53:31,069
and whup E. T. 's ass, that's all.

1028
00:53:32,903 --> 00:53:34,946
And you'll get your chance.

1029
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:37,480
You'll all get your chance.

1030
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,357
Good hunting.

1031
00:53:39,456 --> 00:53:40,940
Dismissed.

1032
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,407
Let's kick the tires
and light the fires,

1033
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:44,366
big daddy.

1034
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:49,409
Let's bring it home.

1035
00:53:49,535 --> 00:53:50,910
Let's bring that bad boy home, Captain.

1036
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:51,910
You loose?

1037
00:53:52,035 --> 00:53:52,911
Yes, sir.

1038
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:54,411
You got your victory dance?

1039
00:53:54,537 --> 00:53:56,745
Well, I got it right heeere.

1040
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,912
Yeah!

1041
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,914
Hey, hey. Don't get
premature on me, soldier.

1042
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,915
We don't light up till
the fat lady sings.

1043
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,582
I'm all ears, brother.

1044
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:13,877
You the man!

1045
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,756
All right, gentlemen, we're on.

1046
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,631
General, it's NORAD.

1047
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:25,038
General Grey here.

1048
00:54:25,163 --> 00:54:26,279
Al?

1049
00:54:26,402 --> 00:54:28,884
All satellite, microwave,
and ground communications

1050
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,082
with the cities are down.

1051
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:31,771
All systems go.

1052
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,590
We believe we're
looking at a total loss.

1053
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:36,278
How about our boys?
Where are they?

1054
00:54:36,377 --> 00:54:39,057
ETA to target, four minutes.

1055
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:48,898
I shouldn't have left her.

1056
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:50,841
Don't worry about it, big man.

1057
00:54:50,965 --> 00:54:53,239
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.

1058
00:54:53,363 --> 00:54:57,582
Or, as the good reverend would say,

1059
00:54:59,194 --> 00:55:01,668
"Why we're on this particular
mission we'll never know.

1060
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:05,811
But I do know, here today,
that the Black Knights

1061
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:08,002
will emerge victorious once again. "

1062
00:55:08,126 --> 00:55:09,813
Amen, man.

1063
00:55:09,912 --> 00:55:11,187
Amen, Reverend.

1064
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,899
Holy God.

1065
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:32,275
Lock and load.

1066
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:36,037
Roger that.

1067
00:55:36,161 --> 00:55:37,071
Los Angeles Attack Squadron

1068
00:55:37,196 --> 00:55:38,760
has Amraam missiles locked on target.

1069
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:41,621
Washington and New York
squadrons reporting lock on.

1070
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:42,861
Fire at will.

1071
00:55:42,986 --> 00:55:43,854
Fire at will.

1072
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:44,970
Fire at will.

1073
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:47,898
Knights, we are red and free.

1074
00:55:47,997 --> 00:55:50,511
Knight 1, Fox 3.

1075
00:55:50,634 --> 00:55:51,678
Knight 3, Fox 3.

1076
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:53,890
Knight 7, Fox 3.

1077
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,605
Missiles have been fired.

1078
00:56:18,473 --> 00:56:19,927
Are they not getting through?

1079
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:21,604
No, sir. Not one.

1080
00:56:21,729 --> 00:56:23,358
Command, Knight 1.
Command, Knight 1.

1081
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:24,819
Switching to sidewinders.
Moving in.

1082
00:56:28,616 --> 00:56:31,788
Knight 3, Love 50.
Notch reference 1-2-0.

1083
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:35,042
Knight 7.
1-2-0.

1084
00:56:35,168 --> 00:56:36,461
Knight 1.
Sweet luck.

1085
00:56:36,587 --> 00:56:37,672
Echo, Fox 2.

1086
00:56:37,797 --> 00:56:38,674
Knight 7, Fox 2.

1087
00:56:43,683 --> 00:56:44,643
Come on. Come on.

1088
00:56:50,695 --> 00:56:51,904
They must have some kind
of protective shield

1089
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:52,990
over their hull.

1090
00:56:53,115 --> 00:56:54,158
Knights! Pull up! Pull up!

1091
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:00,880
Knight 3, pull up!

1092
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:02,957
Controls are showing
complete failure of the stats.

1093
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:04,794
Pull up!

1094
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:14,526
Blow through!
Blow through!

1095
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:16,404
There's so many of them!

1096
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,619
Aah!

1097
00:57:19,744 --> 00:57:21,372
They got another one, sir.

1098
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:27,715
Oh, no. You did not shoot
that green shit at me.

1099
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,722
I've got you covered, big daddy.

1100
00:57:36,605 --> 00:57:37,774
Damn. They got shields, too.

1101
00:57:49,126 --> 00:57:50,420
Let's go, Knights.
Move, Knights, move!

1102
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:55,679
Aah!

1103
00:57:55,887 --> 00:57:57,516
Jesus.

1104
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,769
They got another one, sir.
Two more just went down.

1105
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,021
They're dropping like flies.

1106
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:02,190
We're losing them.

1107
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:04,061
All right. Get them out of there.

1108
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:06,239
Squadron leaders, retreat
to fallback positions.

1109
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:08,200
Abort mission right away.
Do you read me?

1110
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:09,202
Do you copy?

1111
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,878
We're going to have to make
a run for this one here.

1112
00:58:15,004 --> 00:58:16,213
Let's get low.
Let's get fast.

1113
00:58:16,338 --> 00:58:18,342
I got you, big daddy.
Let's get them.

1114
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:21,807
Watch the deck.

1115
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,365
Squadron Leader, do you read?

1116
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:34,328
This isn't happening fast enough.

1117
00:58:34,453 --> 00:58:35,454
Get them out of there!

1118
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,512
What's with the monitor?
Where's the picture?

1119
00:58:44,637 --> 00:58:45,680
We've lost the satellite.

1120
00:58:49,854 --> 00:58:52,024
We got two R-6, Jimmy. Check them.

1121
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:53,818
Roger.

1122
00:58:54,904 --> 00:58:56,698
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move!

1123
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,820
He's on me like white
on rice, big daddy.

1124
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,873
They ain't got nothing for us.

1125
00:59:00,998 --> 00:59:02,659
Let's push it.
We've got to go.

1126
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:04,496
I can't shake him.
I can't shake him.

1127
00:59:04,596 --> 00:59:06,040
Yes, you can.
Just the way I showed you.

1128
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,176
Check me out. I'm going
to try something.

1129
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:09,720
Don't do nothing stupid over there.

1130
00:59:09,845 --> 00:59:10,722
You know me.

1131
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,342
That's what I'm talking about.

1132
00:59:12,442 --> 00:59:14,729
Jimmy, what are you doing?
You can't bank at that speed.

1133
00:59:15,939 --> 00:59:16,816
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

1134
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:22,492
Put your mask back on!
That's an order!

1135
00:59:22,618 --> 00:59:23,828
I can't breathe!

1136
00:59:25,163 --> 00:59:26,457
Jimmy!

1137
00:59:27,793 --> 00:59:29,003
Jimmy!

1138
00:59:31,466 --> 00:59:32,877
Jimmy! No!

1139
00:59:32,976 --> 00:59:34,554
That's affirmative.
We have incoming.

1140
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:35,590
Let me have it, son.

1141
00:59:35,689 --> 00:59:37,517
You got it.

1142
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:39,722
Friendly?

1143
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:41,108
Sergeant?

1144
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:42,569
I don't think so.

1145
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:48,870
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1146
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:12,117
Come on and get me!
Come and get me!

1147
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,877
Oh, what are you shooting at?

1148
01:00:19,171 --> 01:00:21,801
Where you at, baby?
Come on! Come on!

1149
01:00:27,269 --> 01:00:28,479
Aw, you can't hit nothing!

1150
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,553
Whoa! Low bridge!

1151
01:00:51,977 --> 01:00:53,813
See if you can fly
that thing undercover.

1152
01:00:57,486 --> 01:01:00,325
Ha ha. Hope you got an air bag.

1153
01:01:37,637 --> 01:01:39,557
Son of a bitch.

1154
01:01:43,899 --> 01:01:45,985
That's right!
That's right!

1155
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,863
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1156
01:01:47,988 --> 01:01:49,442
That's what you get!

1157
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:51,494
Look at you!

1158
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:53,163
Ship all banged up!

1159
01:01:53,331 --> 01:01:54,574
Who's the man?

1160
01:01:54,674 --> 01:01:56,286
Huh? Who's the man?

1161
01:01:56,386 --> 01:01:57,831
Wait until I get another plane!

1162
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:00,426
I'm lining all your friends
up right beside you!

1163
01:02:02,012 --> 01:02:03,298
Where you at, huh?

1164
01:02:03,398 --> 01:02:04,726
Huh? Where you at?

1165
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:18,665
Welcome to Earth.

1166
01:02:28,974 --> 01:02:31,854
Now, that's what I call
a close encounter.

1167
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:37,063
Baby, stay right here.

1168
01:02:37,163 --> 01:02:38,698
Stay right here with Boomer.

1169
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:49,259
Keys.

1170
01:02:49,385 --> 01:02:51,178
Come on. Keys.

1171
01:02:51,346 --> 01:02:52,181
Yes!

1172
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:54,302
Come on, baby.
Come on.

1173
01:02:54,432 --> 01:02:55,379
Come on.

1174
01:02:55,483 --> 01:02:56,472
Yes!

1175
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:59,644
Reports indicate that this battle

1176
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:01,632
has repeated itself all over the world

1177
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,500
with the exact same results.

1178
01:03:03,604 --> 01:03:07,418
See, Troy? You're
feeling better already.

1179
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:10,023
I couldn't find anything.

1180
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,891
Everyone's packing up.
They're leaving.

1181
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:20,705
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.

1182
01:03:20,836 --> 01:03:21,835
Still he gets sick.

1183
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,094
Oh, boy.
I don't feel so good.

1184
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:26,091
Look at me, huh?
Like a rock.

1185
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:27,603
Could be bad weather,
could be good weather.

1186
01:03:27,707 --> 01:03:28,828
It doesn't matter.

1187
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:30,304
We could go up.
We could go down.

1188
01:03:30,434 --> 01:03:32,258
We can go back.
We can go forward.

1189
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:33,561
We can go side to side...

1190
01:03:36,861 --> 01:03:37,815
What'd I say?

1191
01:03:40,162 --> 01:03:42,325
He still gets airsick, huh?

1192
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:43,931
Yeah.

1193
01:03:44,035 --> 01:03:47,406
Julius, with all of this, I, uh...

1194
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:51,063
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

1195
01:03:51,193 --> 01:03:53,538
All he could think of
was getting to you.

1196
01:03:56,534 --> 01:03:58,835
There's still love there,
I think.

1197
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:03,526
Love was never our problem.

1198
01:04:03,656 --> 01:04:06,610
"All you need is love. "

1199
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,826
John Lennon.

1200
01:04:07,956 --> 01:04:09,042
Smart man.

1201
01:04:09,173 --> 01:04:11,170
Shot in the back.
Very sad.

1202
01:04:13,037 --> 01:04:14,549
We've moved as many of our forces

1203
01:04:14,653 --> 01:04:16,373
away from our bases as possible,

1204
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,986
but we've already
sustained heavy losses.

1205
01:04:19,117 --> 01:04:21,071
I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.

1206
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:23,764
They agree we must launch
a counteroffensive

1207
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,674
with a full nuclear strike.

1208
01:04:25,804 --> 01:04:27,367
Over American soil?

1209
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:28,585
You're saying, at this point,

1210
01:04:28,715 --> 01:04:30,009
we should sacrifice more innocent

1211
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:32,058
American civilians?
Is that right?

1212
01:04:32,189 --> 01:04:33,534
Sir, if we don't strike soon

1213
01:04:33,665 --> 01:04:35,576
there may not be much
of an America left to defend.

1214
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:37,747
Sir, they've taken out NORAD.

1215
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:38,789
What?

1216
01:04:38,919 --> 01:04:39,962
It's gone, sir.

1217
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:41,995
My God.

1218
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:44,687
The vice president, joint chiefs.

1219
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:47,336
Mr. President,

1220
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,996
we must launch.

1221
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:50,768
A delay now would be more costly

1222
01:04:50,872 --> 01:04:53,859
than when you waited to
evacuate the cities.

1223
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:55,552
No, no. You're not going
to launch nuclear weapons.

1224
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,811
You're going to kill them
and us at the same time.

1225
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,374
If we fire nukes,

1226
01:04:59,504 --> 01:05:00,417
then everybody else
is going to fire them.

1227
01:05:00,547 --> 01:05:01,537
You are a guest here.

1228
01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:02,579
Ever hear of nuclear winter?

1229
01:05:02,683 --> 01:05:04,577
It's the end of life as we know it.

1230
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:05,619
Do you hear what they're talking about?

1231
01:05:05,723 --> 01:05:06,662
Don't even think about it.

1232
01:05:06,766 --> 01:05:07,834
I don't have to go.

1233
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:08,920
It can't be allowed.

1234
01:05:09,024 --> 01:05:10,831
Shut up! Captain,
get him out of here!

1235
01:05:10,935 --> 01:05:12,099
Hey, don't tell him to shut up!

1236
01:05:14,314 --> 01:05:17,701
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David.

1237
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,517
None of you did anything
to prevent this.

1238
01:05:19,621 --> 01:05:20,958
There was nothing we could do.

1239
01:05:21,089 --> 01:05:23,512
We were totally unprepared for this.

1240
01:05:23,616 --> 01:05:25,031
Don't give me unprepared.

1241
01:05:25,135 --> 01:05:26,169
Come on, Julius.

1242
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:29,252
It was in the 1950s.
You had that spaceship.

1243
01:05:29,382 --> 01:05:30,817
Dad.

1244
01:05:30,947 --> 01:05:33,813
Yeah, that thing that
you found in New Mexico.

1245
01:05:33,943 --> 01:05:36,202
Dad, no.
Not the spaceship.

1246
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:37,634
Roswell.
Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah.

1247
01:05:37,764 --> 01:05:40,319
You had the spaceship,
and you had the bodies.

1248
01:05:40,423 --> 01:05:41,543
They were all locked up in a bunker.

1249
01:05:41,717 --> 01:05:42,846
Where was that?

1250
01:05:42,975 --> 01:05:45,566
David?
In Area 51, right?

1251
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,062
Area 51.

1252
01:05:47,162 --> 01:05:48,992
You knew then, and you did nothing.

1253
01:05:50,538 --> 01:05:51,952
Sir, regardless of what

1254
01:05:52,052 --> 01:05:55,177
you may have read in the tabloids,

1255
01:05:55,386 --> 01:05:57,350
there have never been any spacecraft

1256
01:05:57,475 --> 01:05:59,305
recovered by our government.

1257
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:02,146
Take my word for it, there's no Area 51.

1258
01:06:02,246 --> 01:06:04,160
There's no recovered spaceship.

1259
01:06:04,285 --> 01:06:07,418
Uh, excuse me, Mr. President?

1260
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:11,430
That's not entirely accurate.

1261
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:19,035
What? Which part?

1262
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:26,724
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

1263
01:06:27,935 --> 01:06:29,608
Sorry.

1264
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:50,261
Can you give me a hand?

1265
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:51,377
Yeah, sure.

1266
01:06:58,731 --> 01:06:59,693
Oh, my God.

1267
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:08,835
OK, OK. Let's...
Let's get this off.

1268
01:07:08,935 --> 01:07:10,555
Here. Let me help you.

1269
01:07:14,401 --> 01:07:16,281
She's hurt pretty badly.

1270
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:24,763
You know, this was supposed
to be my weekend off.

1271
01:07:24,888 --> 01:07:27,144
But no.

1272
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:30,194
You got me out here
dragging your heavy ass

1273
01:07:30,403 --> 01:07:31,823
through the burning desert,

1274
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:33,329
with your dreadlocks

1275
01:07:33,454 --> 01:07:34,666
sticking out the back of my parachute.

1276
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:37,675
You've got to come down here
with an attitude,

1277
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,846
acting all big and bad.

1278
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:45,187
And what the hell is that smell?!

1279
01:07:45,287 --> 01:07:47,033
Aah!

1280
01:07:48,871 --> 01:07:50,418
I could've been at a barbecue!

1281
01:07:52,215 --> 01:07:53,386
But I ain't mad.

1282
01:07:53,511 --> 01:07:55,433
It's all right.

1283
01:07:55,558 --> 01:07:57,020
That is all right.

1284
01:08:12,271 --> 01:08:13,442
Hey!

1285
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:15,440
Hey!

1286
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,451
Hey!

1287
01:08:22,007 --> 01:08:22,968
Hey!

1288
01:08:36,549 --> 01:08:38,721
You need a lift, soldier?

1289
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:40,183
When I flew overhead,

1290
01:08:40,308 --> 01:08:41,813
I saw a base not too far from here.

1291
01:08:45,197 --> 01:08:46,075
It ain't on the map.

1292
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,376
Trust me. It's there.

1293
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:05,839
Ten-hut!

1294
01:09:09,724 --> 01:09:12,001
Mr. President.
General.

1295
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,830
Welcome to Area 51.

1296
01:09:13,929 --> 01:09:14,958
Please follow me.

1297
01:09:16,828 --> 01:09:19,030
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface,

1298
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:21,971
and here's our main research facility.

1299
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,059
Let's see it.

1300
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:24,139
I'm sorry, sir.
It's a clean room.

1301
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:25,509
We have to keep it static-free.

1302
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:26,539
If we'll all go to decontamination...

1303
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:28,873
Open the door.

1304
01:09:30,826 --> 01:09:31,989
Yes, sir.

1305
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:56,497
My God. Why the hell wasn't
I told about this place?

1306
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:58,158
Two words, Mr. President:

1307
01:09:58,283 --> 01:10:01,149
plausible deniability.

1308
01:10:07,628 --> 01:10:09,165
I don't understand.

1309
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,660
Where does all this come from?

1310
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:13,163
How do you get funding
for something like this?

1311
01:10:13,287 --> 01:10:14,665
You don't actually think

1312
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:16,075
they spend $20,000 on a hammer,

1313
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,670
$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

1314
01:10:20,796 --> 01:10:23,292
Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.

1315
01:10:23,392 --> 01:10:24,551
He's been heading up
the research department

1316
01:10:24,676 --> 01:10:26,721
on this project for the last 15 years.

1317
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:30,487
How do you do.

1318
01:10:30,587 --> 01:10:33,354
Mr. President.

1319
01:10:33,478 --> 01:10:35,649
Wow.

1320
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:39,527
This...
What a pleasure.

1321
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,404
As you can imagine,

1322
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,198
they don't let us out much.

1323
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,534
I can understand that.

1324
01:10:48,454 --> 01:10:51,332
Well, I guess you'd like to see

1325
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:53,452
the big tamale, huh?

1326
01:10:53,552 --> 01:10:54,921
Follow me.

1327
01:11:45,688 --> 01:11:48,065
She's a beaut, ain't she?

1328
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,528
As you can see from the repairs,

1329
01:11:51,737 --> 01:11:53,322
we've been trying to
put her back together

1330
01:11:53,448 --> 01:11:55,826
since the late 1960s.

1331
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:56,993
Don't tell me

1332
01:11:57,161 --> 01:11:58,037
you've had this for 40 years,

1333
01:11:58,162 --> 01:11:59,038
and you don't know anything about them?

1334
01:11:59,163 --> 01:12:00,331
Oh, hell, no. No, no.

1335
01:12:00,456 --> 01:12:02,575
We know tons about them.

1336
01:12:02,675 --> 01:12:04,461
But the neatest stuff...
the neatest stuff

1337
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:08,423
has only happened in the last few days.

1338
01:12:08,548 --> 01:12:10,876
See, we can't duplicate
their type of power,

1339
01:12:10,976 --> 01:12:13,346
so we've never been able to experiment.

1340
01:12:13,471 --> 01:12:14,805
But since these guys started showing up,

1341
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:19,262
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

1342
01:12:19,362 --> 01:12:22,265
The last 24 hours have
been really exciting.

1343
01:12:22,365 --> 01:12:24,726
Exciting? People are dying out there.

1344
01:12:24,826 --> 01:12:26,194
I don't think "exciting"

1345
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:29,231
is the word I'd choose to describe it.

1346
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,442
You guys are hoping to
fly this thing, huh?

1347
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:33,870
You said you can repair
their technology.

1348
01:12:33,995 --> 01:12:35,740
Can you tell us anything
useful about them?

1349
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,333
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1350
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,834
Well, I mean,

1351
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:40,878
they're not all that dissimilar from us.

1352
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:42,915
Breathes oxygen.

1353
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:45,292
Comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

1354
01:12:45,392 --> 01:12:46,794
Probably why they're interested

1355
01:12:46,894 --> 01:12:49,088
in our planet.

1356
01:12:49,188 --> 01:12:50,723
Hey.

1357
01:12:50,848 --> 01:12:51,724
Hey.

1358
01:12:54,185 --> 01:12:55,479
You guys want to see them?

1359
01:12:56,855 --> 01:12:58,482
Hmm?

1360
01:13:05,366 --> 01:13:09,412
This is...
This is the vault,

1361
01:13:09,537 --> 01:13:13,157
or as some of us have come to call it,

1362
01:13:13,257 --> 01:13:14,201
"The Freak Show. "

1363
01:13:16,763 --> 01:13:17,672
"The... "

1364
01:13:36,902 --> 01:13:39,030
When we found them,

1365
01:13:39,156 --> 01:13:43,035
they were wearing some sort
of biomechanical suits,

1366
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,153
but once we got them off,

1367
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,371
we learned a great deal
about their anatomy.

1368
01:13:46,497 --> 01:13:50,043
Eyes, ears, no vocal chords.

1369
01:13:50,169 --> 01:13:52,203
We're assuming they
communicate with each other

1370
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,081
through some other means.

1371
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:55,214
You're obviously not thinking about

1372
01:13:55,341 --> 01:13:57,586
hand signals and body language.

1373
01:13:57,686 --> 01:13:58,587
It's some kind of

1374
01:13:58,687 --> 01:14:00,506
extrasensory perception.

1375
01:14:00,606 --> 01:14:01,932
Telepathy.

1376
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:04,226
So...

1377
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,566
It's an organic life form.

1378
01:14:10,568 --> 01:14:13,566
Can they be killed?

1379
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:15,326
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

1380
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,531
These two died in the crash.

1381
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,959
This one, a few weeks later.

1382
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:21,087
You just...

1383
01:14:21,212 --> 01:14:23,248
You have to get through
their technology,

1384
01:14:23,348 --> 01:14:26,211
which is, I'm sorry to say,

1385
01:14:26,311 --> 01:14:27,470
far more advanced.

1386
01:14:28,806 --> 01:14:32,353
David, you unlocked part
of that technology.

1387
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:33,481
You cracked the code.

1388
01:14:33,647 --> 01:14:34,524
Oh, no, no.

1389
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:37,154
All I did was stumble onto their signal.

1390
01:14:37,278 --> 01:14:40,234
I don't know how helpful I can be.

1391
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:44,373
Why don't you show them
what you've discovered so far,

1392
01:14:44,499 --> 01:14:47,829
figure out what they
haven't thought of yet,

1393
01:14:47,929 --> 01:14:49,331
and we'll see

1394
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:52,636
if you're as smart as
we all hope you are.

1395
01:15:02,652 --> 01:15:04,030
What code?

1396
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,355
Captain Steven Hiller,

1397
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,515
United States Marine Corps.

1398
01:15:26,615 --> 01:15:28,777
I'm sorry, Captain.
This is a restricted area.

1399
01:15:28,902 --> 01:15:30,229
I can't let you pass without clearance.

1400
01:15:30,329 --> 01:15:33,318
OK. Come here.

1401
01:15:33,418 --> 01:15:35,119
You want to see my clearance?

1402
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:39,836
Maybe I'll just leave
this here with you.

1403
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:42,007
Let them pass.

1404
01:15:42,382 --> 01:15:43,209
Let them pass.

1405
01:15:43,309 --> 01:15:45,513
Get the hell out of the way.

1406
01:15:47,182 --> 01:15:48,600
Did you see that?

1407
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,391
Oh, boy.

1408
01:15:53,491 --> 01:15:54,394
Oh, boy.

1409
01:15:54,494 --> 01:15:55,395
How long has it been unconscious?

1410
01:15:55,495 --> 01:15:56,396
About three hours.

1411
01:15:56,496 --> 01:15:57,448
Let's get him into containment, stat.

1412
01:15:57,573 --> 01:15:59,452
My son, he's very sick.

1413
01:15:59,993 --> 01:16:01,967
As the former head of the CIA,

1414
01:16:02,067 --> 01:16:02,998
you knew about this place.

1415
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,545
When were you planning on
informing the rest of us?

1416
01:16:05,752 --> 01:16:07,456
It had been deemed classified.

1417
01:16:07,556 --> 01:16:08,959
You should have told us about this

1418
01:16:09,059 --> 01:16:10,461
when they first arrived.

1419
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,963
You should have warned us

1420
01:16:12,063 --> 01:16:13,465
before we launched a counterattack

1421
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:16,303
that cost us the lives of
hundreds of American pilots!

1422
01:16:16,403 --> 01:16:17,347
There was no way

1423
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,306
we could have known that our fighters

1424
01:16:18,406 --> 01:16:19,308
would have been that ineffective

1425
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,351
against their attackers.

1426
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:21,645
Mr. President.

1427
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:24,073
The little bit of
information that we have

1428
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,411
comes directly into
this room, Mr. President.

1429
01:16:26,536 --> 01:16:28,590
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia...

1430
01:16:28,757 --> 01:16:29,930
destroyed.

1431
01:16:30,056 --> 01:16:31,607
We've learned that NATO

1432
01:16:31,776 --> 01:16:33,409
and Western Allied Installations

1433
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:35,463
were the first to be taken out.

1434
01:16:35,589 --> 01:16:36,971
Then we were hit.

1435
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:40,275
They knew exactly where
and how to hit us.

1436
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:41,784
And our forces?

1437
01:16:41,884 --> 01:16:43,796
We're down to 15%.

1438
01:16:43,896 --> 01:16:45,983
If you calculate the time it takes

1439
01:16:46,109 --> 01:16:47,827
to destroy a city and move on,

1440
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,341
we're looking at the
worldwide destruction

1441
01:16:50,551 --> 01:16:52,605
of every major city...

1442
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:56,250
in the next 36 hours.

1443
01:16:57,466 --> 01:16:59,604
We're being exterminated.

1444
01:17:03,376 --> 01:17:04,466
Mr. President.

1445
01:17:05,639 --> 01:17:07,558
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

1446
01:17:07,658 --> 01:17:08,280
Captain.

1447
01:17:08,405 --> 01:17:09,340
Mr. President.

1448
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:10,283
Well done.

1449
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:12,218
Where is it now?

1450
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:13,727
We have it isolated

1451
01:17:13,854 --> 01:17:15,235
down in the containment lab, sir.

1452
01:17:15,362 --> 01:17:17,039
I'd like to go see it.

1453
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:26,511
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

1454
01:17:28,563 --> 01:17:30,408
Hasn't anyone told you?

1455
01:17:33,509 --> 01:17:36,484
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

1456
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:27,994
Oh, no.

1457
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:30,507
We were lucky.

1458
01:18:32,059 --> 01:18:34,314
Today was the first
time I used the subway.

1459
01:18:34,415 --> 01:18:36,157
Thank God for the metro rail.

1460
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:37,883
These should last us a while.

1461
01:18:38,638 --> 01:18:40,316
Don't move.
I'll get it for you.

1462
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:42,076
Stay still.

1463
01:18:43,668 --> 01:18:46,175
He's your son?

1464
01:18:46,275 --> 01:18:47,893
He's my angel.

1465
01:18:47,993 --> 01:18:50,994
Was his father stationed here?

1466
01:18:51,095 --> 01:18:53,476
Nah, he, uh...

1467
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:55,487
he wasn't his father.

1468
01:18:55,612 --> 01:18:56,995
But I was kind of hoping

1469
01:18:57,121 --> 01:18:59,678
he wanted the job, though.

1470
01:19:03,367 --> 01:19:05,894
So what do you do for a living?

1471
01:19:05,995 --> 01:19:06,900
I'm a dancer.

1472
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,031
Ah.

1473
01:19:08,131 --> 01:19:09,498
Ballet?

1474
01:19:09,598 --> 01:19:10,994
No.

1475
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:12,544
Exotic.

1476
01:19:13,801 --> 01:19:15,519
Oh.

1477
01:19:15,646 --> 01:19:17,063
Sorry.

1478
01:19:17,163 --> 01:19:18,538
Don't be.

1479
01:19:18,663 --> 01:19:19,668
I'm not.

1480
01:19:19,794 --> 01:19:21,179
It's good money.

1481
01:19:21,304 --> 01:19:22,260
Besides,

1482
01:19:22,361 --> 01:19:23,769
my baby's worth it.

1483
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,775
Dylan.

1484
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:25,780
Come here.

1485
01:19:25,881 --> 01:19:28,773
I want you to meet the first lady.

1486
01:19:28,872 --> 01:19:29,819
Ohh.

1487
01:19:32,354 --> 01:19:33,759
Hello.

1488
01:19:33,858 --> 01:19:35,254
Hi.

1489
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:38,295
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.

1490
01:19:38,421 --> 01:19:40,291
Well, I didn't want to say nothing.

1491
01:19:40,415 --> 01:19:42,037
I voted for the other guy.

1492
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:45,166
All right,

1493
01:19:45,265 --> 01:19:46,640
life support monitors recording.

1494
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,133
So if we screw up,
it's all on tape.

1495
01:19:49,233 --> 01:19:50,430
OK, come on, come on.

1496
01:19:50,554 --> 01:19:51,634
Let's get this biomechanical
suit off him.

1497
01:19:52,465 --> 01:19:53,912
Put the spreader right here.

1498
01:19:54,011 --> 01:19:56,329
Right along the ridge.

1499
01:19:56,453 --> 01:19:58,275
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here,

1500
01:19:58,375 --> 01:19:59,778
pick there. Good.

1501
01:19:59,986 --> 01:20:02,397
All right, now spread
it very, very gently.

1502
01:20:02,522 --> 01:20:03,892
Let me get in.

1503
01:20:10,915 --> 01:20:13,650
Gentle, gentle.
That's it.

1504
01:20:13,749 --> 01:20:16,607
That's right... easy.

1505
01:20:23,091 --> 01:20:24,245
All right. OK.

1506
01:20:24,344 --> 01:20:25,825
Let's proceed.

1507
01:20:25,924 --> 01:20:28,379
Now comes the, uh,

1508
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:29,614
the really icky part.

1509
01:20:32,301 --> 01:20:33,769
Oh, boy.

1510
01:20:33,893 --> 01:20:35,389
This is one smelly,

1511
01:20:35,514 --> 01:20:37,716
disgusting...

1512
01:20:45,653 --> 01:20:46,940
Oh, look at it.

1513
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:50,265
It doesn't look alive, does it?

1514
01:20:53,755 --> 01:20:55,251
The arm is moving.

1515
01:21:05,182 --> 01:21:06,055
Doctor!

1516
01:21:10,293 --> 01:21:11,165
Doctor! Doctor!

1517
01:21:12,703 --> 01:21:13,610
Get it off!

1518
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:16,477
Don't move!
Don't move!

1519
01:21:16,576 --> 01:21:17,730
Help me! Help me!

1520
01:21:23,807 --> 01:21:25,868
Open up that door!

1521
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:27,912
My God!

1522
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,444
Dr. Okun.

1523
01:22:23,841 --> 01:22:27,615
Release... me.

1524
01:22:27,714 --> 01:22:28,944
Open the door.
Get him out of there.

1525
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:29,949
No, wait.

1526
01:22:44,244 --> 01:22:46,861
Release me.

1527
01:22:50,393 --> 01:22:54,007
Now!

1528
01:22:59,368 --> 01:23:01,238
I know there is much

1529
01:23:01,363 --> 01:23:03,184
we can learn from each other

1530
01:23:03,284 --> 01:23:06,142
if we can negotiate a truce.

1531
01:23:06,266 --> 01:23:09,133
We can find a way to coexist.

1532
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:12,499
Can there be a peace between us?

1533
01:23:12,749 --> 01:23:16,072
Peace?

1534
01:23:16,197 --> 01:23:19,188
No peace.

1535
01:23:24,923 --> 01:23:27,125
What is it you want us to do?

1536
01:23:29,202 --> 01:23:31,863
Die.

1537
01:23:40,463 --> 01:23:43,365
Die...

1538
01:23:47,184 --> 01:23:48,737
Mr. President...

1539
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:51,112
Is that glass bulletproof?

1540
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:53,021
No, sir.

1541
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,905
Are you all right?

1542
01:24:14,029 --> 01:24:15,405
I saw his thoughts.

1543
01:24:15,572 --> 01:24:18,488
I saw what they're planning to do.

1544
01:24:20,572 --> 01:24:21,948
They're like locusts.

1545
01:24:22,073 --> 01:24:25,739
They're moving from planet to planet,

1546
01:24:25,864 --> 01:24:27,574
their whole civilization.

1547
01:24:27,781 --> 01:24:30,065
After they've consumed
every natural resource,

1548
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:33,648
they move on.

1549
01:24:33,748 --> 01:24:35,282
And we're next.

1550
01:24:46,741 --> 01:24:48,241
Nuke 'em.

1551
01:24:49,491 --> 01:24:51,741
Let's nuke the bastards.

1552
01:25:03,117 --> 01:25:06,243
Just my luck.
No ice.

1553
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,576
I take it you've heard.

1554
01:25:09,492 --> 01:25:11,701
Hey, a toast.

1555
01:25:11,826 --> 01:25:13,588
To the end of the world.

1556
01:25:13,688 --> 01:25:16,150
He didn't come to
this decision lightly.

1557
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,068
He didn't have any other choice.

1558
01:25:18,168 --> 01:25:19,068
Yeah.

1559
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:21,450
You still believe in him.

1560
01:25:21,576 --> 01:25:23,618
Yeah. Well, he's a good man.

1561
01:25:25,285 --> 01:25:26,618
He better be.

1562
01:25:26,785 --> 01:25:28,618
You left me for him.

1563
01:25:28,785 --> 01:25:31,118
Or, you know, for your... career.

1564
01:25:31,286 --> 01:25:33,119
You know, it wasn't just my... career.

1565
01:25:33,285 --> 01:25:36,243
It was the biggest
opportunity of my life.

1566
01:25:36,369 --> 01:25:38,743
I wanted my life to make a difference.

1567
01:25:38,869 --> 01:25:41,243
I wanted my life to mean something.

1568
01:25:41,368 --> 01:25:42,778
Yeah, and, um, hmm,

1569
01:25:42,878 --> 01:25:43,911
I wasn't, um...

1570
01:25:44,078 --> 01:25:45,245
ambitious enough for you?

1571
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:47,995
David, you could have done
anything that you wanted.

1572
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:48,995
Research,

1573
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,328
development...

1574
01:25:50,453 --> 01:25:52,078
Oh, honey, I was happy where I was.

1575
01:25:52,203 --> 01:25:53,619
Haven't you ever wanted

1576
01:25:53,786 --> 01:25:57,995
to be part of something special?

1577
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,870
<i>I was part of something special. </i>

1578
01:26:15,955 --> 01:26:18,363
Well, if it makes any difference,

1579
01:26:18,463 --> 01:26:20,288
I never stopped loving you.

1580
01:26:20,413 --> 01:26:23,746
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1581
01:26:41,372 --> 01:26:43,747
Let's pick it up, men.

1582
01:26:43,874 --> 01:26:46,748
We're on a tight
schedule, now. Let's go.

1583
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:52,790
Let's pick it up, men.

1584
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:54,241
We're working on a tight
schedule. Let's go!

1585
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:57,166
Pick it up, man!
Pick it up!

1586
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:02,116
What the hell are you doing?

1587
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:04,125
Get out of there!

1588
01:27:04,249 --> 01:27:05,624
Look, I got something I got to handle.

1589
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:06,867
I'm just borrowing it.

1590
01:27:06,967 --> 01:27:08,125
No, you're not, sir.

1591
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:10,708
Do you really want to shoot me?

1592
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:14,541
Just tell them I hit you.

1593
01:27:20,459 --> 01:27:22,083
Command, this is Retel Op.

1594
01:27:22,292 --> 01:27:24,201
The squadron is in the air.

1595
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:26,784
We are on station and
awaiting instructions.

1596
01:27:26,884 --> 01:27:28,626
Roger. Break formation, head to targets.

1597
01:27:32,709 --> 01:27:34,410
Sir...

1598
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:36,084
they're breaking formation.

1599
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:38,869
Mr. President,
we're initiating sequence code.

1600
01:27:38,969 --> 01:27:40,368
Verification,

1601
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:41,418
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er.

1602
01:27:41,543 --> 01:27:43,332
Which city will be reached first?

1603
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:44,332
Houston, Texas.

1604
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:46,829
ETA six minutes and counting down.

1605
01:27:46,955 --> 01:27:47,829
Houston.

1606
01:27:47,954 --> 01:27:49,861
The major cities have been deserted.

1607
01:27:49,961 --> 01:27:54,572
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

1608
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:59,517
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.

1609
01:27:59,616 --> 01:28:01,016
We are in position.

1610
01:28:01,115 --> 01:28:03,603
Tracking monitors are locked on.

1611
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:06,102
We are going to visual recon.

1612
01:28:06,227 --> 01:28:08,225
Roger that, TCW.

1613
01:28:12,013 --> 01:28:13,052
They have confirmation.

1614
01:28:13,177 --> 01:28:14,377
Launch code confirmed.

1615
01:28:14,476 --> 01:28:16,708
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er.

1616
01:28:16,807 --> 01:28:18,381
Standing by.

1617
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:23,575
Laser targeting.

1618
01:28:23,675 --> 01:28:25,158
Locked on.

1619
01:28:25,257 --> 01:28:26,623
We're locked on, sir.

1620
01:28:26,747 --> 01:28:28,578
Do you wish to deploy?

1621
01:28:31,742 --> 01:28:34,648
Mr. President, if you wish to deploy,

1622
01:28:34,748 --> 01:28:36,653
the time is now.

1623
01:28:41,731 --> 01:28:43,305
Mr. President.

1624
01:28:43,405 --> 01:28:44,513
Deploy.

1625
01:28:44,613 --> 01:28:46,011
That's a go.

1626
01:28:46,111 --> 01:28:47,468
Alpha Zulu 6-8-9er, that is a go.

1627
01:28:47,568 --> 01:28:48,933
Here we go.

1628
01:28:57,258 --> 01:28:58,790
Bird's away.

1629
01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:00,787
We have visual confirmation
of the missile.

1630
01:29:00,887 --> 01:29:01,994
It's on target...

1631
01:29:02,094 --> 01:29:04,284
approaching...

1632
01:29:04,384 --> 01:29:05,999
May our children forgive us.

1633
01:29:06,124 --> 01:29:08,163
5 seconds to impact.

1634
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:09,162
3...

1635
01:29:09,329 --> 01:29:10,319
2...

1636
01:29:10,419 --> 01:29:11,327
1...

1637
01:29:13,699 --> 01:29:15,405
Oh, yeah, it's a hit!

1638
01:29:19,609 --> 01:29:21,024
Lock it down!

1639
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:22,432
I said lock it down!

1640
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:25,263
Can I confirm that the
target was destroyed?

1641
01:29:25,363 --> 01:29:27,261
Get the tank commander on the line.

1642
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:29,300
I want confirmation that
the target was destroyed.

1643
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,471
Yes, sir. Red Arrow Alpha 9er 7-2-3,

1644
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:31,474
can you read?

1645
01:29:32,904 --> 01:29:34,108
Repeat, Commander, you're breaking up.

1646
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,872
We have lost visual.

1647
01:29:35,997 --> 01:29:37,285
Roger that.

1648
01:29:37,386 --> 01:29:39,050
We're looking for confirmation.

1649
01:29:45,322 --> 01:29:47,289
We got the bastards.

1650
01:29:47,414 --> 01:29:48,751
Yeah! Good job, everyone.

1651
01:29:48,877 --> 01:29:50,299
Congratulations.

1652
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:53,309
Commander, do you have visual?

1653
01:29:53,434 --> 01:29:55,901
I repeat, we need visual confirmation.

1654
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:57,616
Has the target been destroyed?

1655
01:30:12,167 --> 01:30:13,128
Negative.

1656
01:30:15,595 --> 01:30:18,355
Target remains.

1657
01:30:20,069 --> 01:30:22,151
I repeat...

1658
01:30:22,251 --> 01:30:24,626
target remains.

1659
01:30:27,429 --> 01:30:29,352
Call the other planes back.

1660
01:30:29,561 --> 01:30:31,686
One of the bombers might have more luck.

1661
01:30:31,786 --> 01:30:33,275
Sir, we shouldn't just give up on this!

1662
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:35,623
I said call them back.

1663
01:30:38,425 --> 01:30:39,303
Abort.

1664
01:30:39,429 --> 01:30:41,060
All right, abort mission.

1665
01:30:41,268 --> 01:30:42,557
Issue the abort codes right away.

1666
01:30:42,657 --> 01:30:44,229
This is an abort. Full abort.

1667
01:30:44,329 --> 01:30:46,412
Do you read?
Abort mission right away.

1668
01:31:23,794 --> 01:31:25,173
Jasmine?

1669
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:31,612
Yes. Yes!

1670
01:31:37,968 --> 01:31:39,298
You're late.

1671
01:31:39,398 --> 01:31:42,526
Well, you know I like
to make an entrance.

1672
01:31:50,053 --> 01:31:51,340
Right this way.

1673
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,679
Where are we going?

1674
01:31:52,779 --> 01:31:54,017
Right through there, sir.

1675
01:31:54,117 --> 01:31:55,189
Mr. President,

1676
01:31:55,289 --> 01:31:57,244
your wife is resting
comfortably at the moment.

1677
01:31:57,369 --> 01:31:59,035
Perhaps if we had gotten
to her earlier...

1678
01:31:59,135 --> 01:32:00,798
Hey, there she is.
Go on.

1679
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,397
She doesn't look too good.

1680
01:32:05,523 --> 01:32:07,614
Your wife is bleeding
internally, Mr. President.

1681
01:32:08,325 --> 01:32:09,915
Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...

1682
01:32:10,123 --> 01:32:12,548
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1683
01:32:12,841 --> 01:32:14,764
We can't stop the bleeding.

1684
01:32:15,141 --> 01:32:16,646
If we'd...

1685
01:32:16,772 --> 01:32:20,157
There's nothing we can do for her.

1686
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:21,948
We were worried.

1687
01:32:22,048 --> 01:32:24,456
We didn't know where you were.

1688
01:32:24,556 --> 01:32:26,472
I didn't know where I was either.

1689
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:32,035
You got bigger, I think.

1690
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,706
I did?

1691
01:32:33,832 --> 01:32:35,714
Mm-hmm.

1692
01:32:35,839 --> 01:32:38,682
Just keep growing and growing.

1693
01:32:40,188 --> 01:32:42,152
I can't...

1694
01:32:43,992 --> 01:32:45,405
Hey.

1695
01:32:45,505 --> 01:32:48,384
Can you, uh, wait outside
for a little bit

1696
01:32:48,509 --> 01:32:50,256
so Mom can get a rest?

1697
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:51,854
Hey.
Come on, munchkin.

1698
01:33:00,466 --> 01:33:03,309
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home

1699
01:33:03,435 --> 01:33:05,316
when you asked me to.

1700
01:33:05,443 --> 01:33:07,031
Ohh...

1701
01:33:07,158 --> 01:33:08,035
Ohh...

1702
01:33:08,162 --> 01:33:09,206
It's OK.

1703
01:33:11,589 --> 01:33:14,090
The doctors...

1704
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:16,265
think that you're...

1705
01:33:16,365 --> 01:33:18,907
gonna be just fine.

1706
01:33:21,373 --> 01:33:22,879
Liar.

1707
01:34:19,537 --> 01:34:21,543
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1708
01:34:23,258 --> 01:34:24,972
Yeah...

1709
01:34:26,226 --> 01:34:28,569
Mommy's sleeping.

1710
01:34:31,537 --> 01:34:33,293
Hey.

1711
01:35:04,318 --> 01:35:05,613
David!

1712
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:07,411
What the hell are you doing?

1713
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:09,417
I'm making a mess!

1714
01:35:09,544 --> 01:35:11,131
Yeah, this I can see.

1715
01:35:11,257 --> 01:35:12,878
We gotta burn the rain forest,

1716
01:35:12,978 --> 01:35:14,140
dump toxic waste,

1717
01:35:14,348 --> 01:35:16,647
pollute the air, and rip up the ozone,

1718
01:35:16,857 --> 01:35:18,151
'cause maybe if we

1719
01:35:18,361 --> 01:35:20,158
screw this planet up enough...

1720
01:35:20,366 --> 01:35:22,073
they won't want it anymore.

1721
01:35:22,173 --> 01:35:23,241
Wait, wait, wait.
David, David!

1722
01:35:23,341 --> 01:35:24,746
Don't do this to yourself.

1723
01:35:24,846 --> 01:35:25,883
Listen to me.

1724
01:35:26,008 --> 01:35:27,262
Are you listening to me?

1725
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:28,767
Everyone loses faith

1726
01:35:28,892 --> 01:35:30,480
at some point in their life.

1727
01:35:30,605 --> 01:35:32,904
David, look at myself.

1728
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:36,958
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1729
01:35:39,339 --> 01:35:40,593
Yes.

1730
01:35:42,515 --> 01:35:43,894
But see, sometimes,

1731
01:35:44,019 --> 01:35:46,945
we have to remember what we still have.

1732
01:35:47,113 --> 01:35:49,871
Like what?

1733
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:53,757
Well...

1734
01:35:53,884 --> 01:35:55,555
you still have your health.

1735
01:35:57,267 --> 01:35:59,692
Come on, David, David.
You need your rest.

1736
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:01,648
Come on. Get off
this freezing concrete floor

1737
01:36:01,748 --> 01:36:02,659
before you catch cold.

1738
01:36:02,826 --> 01:36:03,703
Come on.

1739
01:36:05,626 --> 01:36:07,464
What did you just say?

1740
01:36:07,589 --> 01:36:08,968
You mean about faith?

1741
01:36:09,095 --> 01:36:10,474
Well, you see,

1742
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,728
a man can live his entire life...

1743
01:36:11,853 --> 01:36:13,265
After that.
The other part.

1744
01:36:13,366 --> 01:36:14,269
What? What?

1745
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:16,450
I don't want you to catch cold.

1746
01:36:19,501 --> 01:36:20,504
Duh!

1747
01:36:20,629 --> 01:36:22,007
What is that?

1748
01:36:22,132 --> 01:36:23,136
What's the matter with you?

1749
01:36:23,262 --> 01:36:25,268
Genius.

1750
01:36:26,396 --> 01:36:27,817
Genius?

1751
01:36:27,942 --> 01:36:30,241
My dad... a total genius.

1752
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:33,242
Jim, wake up.

1753
01:36:33,342 --> 01:36:35,248
We got work to do.

1754
01:36:35,348 --> 01:36:37,679
Get everybody down here right away.

1755
01:36:37,847 --> 01:36:38,975
What?

1756
01:36:41,441 --> 01:36:42,694
Look at that.

1757
01:36:42,819 --> 01:36:44,198
Wow! Does that thing

1758
01:36:44,408 --> 01:36:46,205
really fly in outer space?

1759
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:47,709
It most certainly does.

1760
01:36:47,918 --> 01:36:49,758
Sure doesn't look like it.

1761
01:36:49,883 --> 01:36:52,097
Hey, they're here.

1762
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,602
All right, Connie,
what's this all about?

1763
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:54,806
I have no idea.

1764
01:36:54,906 --> 01:36:56,311
Get everybody off of it.

1765
01:36:56,411 --> 01:36:57,815
All right, everybody,
clear the platform.

1766
01:36:57,915 --> 01:36:59,578
Let's go.
Come on, come on.

1767
01:36:59,703 --> 01:37:01,208
Major Mitchell,

1768
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:03,047
do you have a pistol?

1769
01:37:03,172 --> 01:37:04,584
- What?
- You got a gun?

1770
01:37:04,684 --> 01:37:06,013
Sergeant, your sidearm.

1771
01:37:07,141 --> 01:37:08,554
See that, uh, Coke can

1772
01:37:08,654 --> 01:37:10,561
on top of the alien craft?

1773
01:37:10,661 --> 01:37:12,943
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1774
01:37:13,043 --> 01:37:14,782
Do it. Shoot it.

1775
01:37:14,882 --> 01:37:16,370
Sir?

1776
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:17,841
Go ahead.

1777
01:37:23,983 --> 01:37:25,990
What the hell are you doing?

1778
01:37:26,115 --> 01:37:27,327
I'm sorry. My fault.

1779
01:37:27,452 --> 01:37:28,539
My fault.

1780
01:37:28,748 --> 01:37:30,670
That Coke can was protected
by the craft's shield,

1781
01:37:30,838 --> 01:37:32,718
and we can't penetrate their defenses.

1782
01:37:32,843 --> 01:37:34,389
We know that already.
What's your point?

1783
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:35,895
Right. My point is,

1784
01:37:36,103 --> 01:37:37,023
if we can't beat their defenses,

1785
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:39,071
then we gotta get around them.

1786
01:37:39,196 --> 01:37:42,748
Major, one more time.
Anytime.

1787
01:37:53,029 --> 01:37:54,742
How did you do that?

1788
01:37:54,867 --> 01:37:56,957
I gave it a cold.

1789
01:37:57,082 --> 01:37:59,966
I gave it a virus.

1790
01:38:00,133 --> 01:38:02,214
A computer virus.

1791
01:38:02,314 --> 01:38:03,268
Are you telling us

1792
01:38:03,435 --> 01:38:04,562
you can send out a signal

1793
01:38:04,688 --> 01:38:06,727
that will disable all their shields?

1794
01:38:06,828 --> 01:38:07,905
That's right.

1795
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:09,737
Just like they used
our satellites against us,

1796
01:38:09,837 --> 01:38:12,245
we can use their own
signal against them.

1797
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:15,253
If we plant a virus
into that mother ship,

1798
01:38:15,353 --> 01:38:17,259
it's gonna then filter down

1799
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:19,147
into all the corresponding ships below.

1800
01:38:19,316 --> 01:38:21,154
I... I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

1801
01:38:21,321 --> 01:38:22,657
Just how, exactly,

1802
01:38:22,825 --> 01:38:24,162
do we infect the mother ship

1803
01:38:24,329 --> 01:38:25,666
with this virus?

1804
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:27,672
Well...

1805
01:38:27,839 --> 01:38:29,252
we're going to, uh...

1806
01:38:29,352 --> 01:38:30,758
have to, um, ahem,

1807
01:38:30,858 --> 01:38:32,764
fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere

1808
01:38:32,864 --> 01:38:34,193
and dock with it.

1809
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,697
We can enter here,

1810
01:38:35,864 --> 01:38:37,119
as shown in these satellite photos.

1811
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:39,124
We then upload the virus.

1812
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,631
We then set off some kind of explosion,

1813
01:38:41,798 --> 01:38:43,136
which will disable it,

1814
01:38:43,302 --> 01:38:44,640
and that'll disorient
the smaller ships below,

1815
01:38:44,807 --> 01:38:47,649
and that could buy,
I think, at least some time

1816
01:38:47,816 --> 01:38:48,944
to, uh...

1817
01:38:49,069 --> 01:38:50,532
to take 'em...

1818
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:52,037
take 'em out.

1819
01:38:52,246 --> 01:38:53,367
Take 'em down.

1820
01:38:53,467 --> 01:38:54,369
Do your...

1821
01:38:54,469 --> 01:38:55,381
do your stuff.

1822
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:56,886
This is ridiculous.

1823
01:38:57,094 --> 01:38:59,392
How long would their shields be down?

1824
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:00,646
Uh...

1825
01:39:00,771 --> 01:39:03,278
I don't know.
A matter of minutes.

1826
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:05,284
You want us to coordinate

1827
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:06,780
a massive worldwide counterstrike

1828
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,703
with a window of only a few minutes?

1829
01:39:08,803 --> 01:39:11,303
With the shields down,
that might be possible.

1830
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:12,432
Oh, please.

1831
01:39:12,557 --> 01:39:13,601
We don't have the manpower

1832
01:39:13,727 --> 01:39:14,688
or the resources

1833
01:39:14,813 --> 01:39:16,694
to launch that kind of a campaign.

1834
01:39:16,819 --> 01:39:18,199
Not to mention

1835
01:39:18,324 --> 01:39:19,201
that this whole cockamamie plan

1836
01:39:19,326 --> 01:39:21,157
is dependent on a machine

1837
01:39:21,258 --> 01:39:23,121
that no one in this world

1838
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:24,124
is qualified to operate.

1839
01:39:24,224 --> 01:39:25,554
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1840
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,183
I've seen these things in action,

1841
01:39:27,308 --> 01:39:29,523
and I'm well aware of their
maneuvering capabilities.

1842
01:39:29,690 --> 01:39:31,103
With your permission, General,

1843
01:39:31,203 --> 01:39:33,779
I'd like the opportunity to try.

1844
01:39:33,879 --> 01:39:36,622
That thing is a wreck.

1845
01:39:36,788 --> 01:39:39,206
Crash-landed back in the fifties.

1846
01:39:39,331 --> 01:39:40,708
We don't even know

1847
01:39:40,915 --> 01:39:42,158
if it's capable of flying.

1848
01:39:42,258 --> 01:39:44,209
Jim, uh, remove the clamps.

1849
01:40:06,683 --> 01:40:08,101
Any questions?

1850
01:40:12,646 --> 01:40:14,272
Let's do it.

1851
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,309
You heard the president.

1852
01:40:19,409 --> 01:40:20,643
Let's get this thing prepped and ready.

1853
01:40:20,743 --> 01:40:21,810
Good luck, pilot.

1854
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:23,694
Thank you, Mr. President.

1855
01:40:23,903 --> 01:40:25,646
A virus.

1856
01:40:25,746 --> 01:40:27,647
Your idea.

1857
01:40:27,746 --> 01:40:29,281
That's right.

1858
01:40:35,411 --> 01:40:36,787
You really think

1859
01:40:36,912 --> 01:40:38,455
you can fly that thing?

1860
01:40:38,579 --> 01:40:39,955
You really think

1861
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:43,458
you can do all that
bullshit you just said?

1862
01:40:49,253 --> 01:40:51,212
Hoo.

1863
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:52,756
I understand you are upset

1864
01:40:52,923 --> 01:40:54,256
over the death of your wife,

1865
01:40:54,424 --> 01:40:55,757
but that's no excuse

1866
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:56,966
for making another fatal mistake.

1867
01:40:57,091 --> 01:40:58,752
The only mistake I ever made

1868
01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:00,594
was to appoint a sniveling
little weasel like you

1869
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:01,636
as secretary of defense.

1870
01:41:01,762 --> 01:41:03,095
I don't think you understand...

1871
01:41:03,221 --> 01:41:06,047
However, that is one mistake
I'm thankful to say

1872
01:41:06,147 --> 01:41:08,549
that I don't have to live with.

1873
01:41:08,649 --> 01:41:09,884
Mr. President...

1874
01:41:09,984 --> 01:41:11,892
Mr. Nimziki... you're fired.

1875
01:41:15,021 --> 01:41:17,314
Let's organize every plane we can find

1876
01:41:17,522 --> 01:41:20,066
and get us some
goddamn pilots to fly 'em.

1877
01:41:20,191 --> 01:41:21,099
Yes, sir.

1878
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:22,816
He can't do that.

1879
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:24,560
Well, he just, uh...

1880
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:25,693
did.

1881
01:41:28,529 --> 01:41:29,855
Command has attempted

1882
01:41:29,955 --> 01:41:31,356
to compile a list of
casualties and losses,

1883
01:41:31,456 --> 01:41:33,859
but information is sketchy at best.

1884
01:41:33,959 --> 01:41:35,359
Well, we know we've lost

1885
01:41:35,459 --> 01:41:37,236
the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.

1886
01:41:37,336 --> 01:41:38,736
There's a strong possibility

1887
01:41:38,836 --> 01:41:40,238
there may be more reinforcements

1888
01:41:40,337 --> 01:41:42,239
hiding in the Golan Strait.

1889
01:41:44,206 --> 01:41:45,615
What the hell's he saying?

1890
01:41:45,715 --> 01:41:47,075
It seems they're getting a signal.

1891
01:41:47,175 --> 01:41:48,125
Old Morse code.

1892
01:42:00,634 --> 01:42:02,468
It's from the Americans.

1893
01:42:03,927 --> 01:42:06,304
They want to organize
a counteroffensive.

1894
01:42:06,429 --> 01:42:07,805
It's about bloody time.

1895
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:09,932
What do they plan to do?

1896
01:42:32,155 --> 01:42:34,731
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions

1897
01:42:34,831 --> 01:42:36,950
in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

1898
01:42:37,075 --> 01:42:38,076
That's impressive,

1899
01:42:38,242 --> 01:42:40,828
considering it's all
being done with, uh...

1900
01:42:40,953 --> 01:42:42,202
Morse code.

1901
01:42:42,328 --> 01:42:43,705
Are our forces here?

1902
01:42:43,829 --> 01:42:45,205
We have sufficient aircraft

1903
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:46,497
for the battle plan, but...

1904
01:42:46,623 --> 01:42:47,498
But what, General?

1905
01:42:47,623 --> 01:42:49,624
Pilots are coming up short.

1906
01:42:49,749 --> 01:42:51,160
Well, then find 'em.

1907
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:54,453
Ham radio operators
from New York to Japan

1908
01:42:54,553 --> 01:42:56,546
trade rumors of military
forces in hiding,

1909
01:42:56,671 --> 01:43:00,007
unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...

1910
01:43:01,757 --> 01:43:03,551
What we're planning at this time

1911
01:43:03,676 --> 01:43:04,551
is to launch a counteroffensive.

1912
01:43:04,676 --> 01:43:06,003
However, with our depleted manpower,

1913
01:43:06,103 --> 01:43:07,503
we're asking that anyone

1914
01:43:07,603 --> 01:43:08,963
with any flight experience come forward.

1915
01:43:09,062 --> 01:43:10,464
Military training is preferable,

1916
01:43:10,564 --> 01:43:14,725
but anyone who can fly
a plane would be useful.

1917
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:16,226
I can fly.

1918
01:43:16,435 --> 01:43:17,935
I'm a pilot.

1919
01:43:19,854 --> 01:43:21,711
All right, guys, listen up.

1920
01:43:21,835 --> 01:43:23,692
All right, pay close attention.

1921
01:43:23,816 --> 01:43:25,178
These F-18s are very different

1922
01:43:25,301 --> 01:43:26,615
than the jets you've piloted before.

1923
01:43:26,714 --> 01:43:27,779
It's kind of strong.

1924
01:43:27,903 --> 01:43:29,265
You'll have to forgive the expression,

1925
01:43:29,471 --> 01:43:30,462
but you're about to get

1926
01:43:30,628 --> 01:43:31,783
a crash course in modern avionics.

1927
01:43:31,907 --> 01:43:33,675
Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.

1928
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:34,714
OK. You got it.

1929
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,770
All right, listen up.
Before we can begin,

1930
01:43:36,869 --> 01:43:38,265
we're going to have to get

1931
01:43:38,388 --> 01:43:39,742
a little background information

1932
01:43:39,841 --> 01:43:40,824
on your flight experience.

1933
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:42,550
Uh, let's start with you.

1934
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:43,589
Who, me?

1935
01:43:43,796 --> 01:43:45,192
Uh...

1936
01:43:45,291 --> 01:43:47,924
Well, I'm, uh, ahem,
Russell Casse, sir.

1937
01:43:48,048 --> 01:43:49,409
Um... and, uh,

1938
01:43:49,534 --> 01:43:53,580
after 'Nam, I, uh,
got into crop-dusting.

1939
01:43:53,704 --> 01:43:56,924
And, uh, been doing that ever since.

1940
01:43:57,089 --> 01:43:59,433
Oh, and on a, uh, personal note, sir,

1941
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:02,289
I'd just like to add that, uh...

1942
01:44:02,496 --> 01:44:04,222
ever since I was kidnapped by aliens

1943
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,798
10 years ago,

1944
01:44:05,921 --> 01:44:07,945
I've been dying for some payback,

1945
01:44:08,068 --> 01:44:10,662
and I just want you to know that, uh,

1946
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:13,063
I won't let you down.

1947
01:44:13,187 --> 01:44:15,624
You have one tactical nuclear missile

1948
01:44:15,748 --> 01:44:17,605
we're loading into this launcher

1949
01:44:17,728 --> 01:44:19,008
we're installing under the right wing.

1950
01:44:19,132 --> 01:44:21,113
This is the firing mechanism,

1951
01:44:21,237 --> 01:44:23,425
to be attached to the
ship's main console.

1952
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:25,812
Just like the Amraam
launch pad on the Stealth.

1953
01:44:25,911 --> 01:44:28,989
Except the nuke will
not detonate at impact.

1954
01:44:29,088 --> 01:44:31,961
You'll have 30 seconds to get your asses

1955
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,572
out of there.

1956
01:44:33,671 --> 01:44:35,107
Good luck, gentlemen.

1957
01:44:36,264 --> 01:44:37,138
30 seconds.

1958
01:44:37,262 --> 01:44:38,212
Tell me. Tell me.

1959
01:44:38,312 --> 01:44:39,211
It was the strongest radio transmitter

1960
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:40,209
we could get. It'll tell us

1961
01:44:40,309 --> 01:44:41,924
when you've uploaded the virus.

1962
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,914
30 seconds. Don't you
think that's cutting it

1963
01:44:44,014 --> 01:44:45,079
a little too close?

1964
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:48,076
Oh, we're gonna be well
on our way back home

1965
01:44:48,176 --> 01:44:50,365
before we shoot that thing off.

1966
01:44:50,465 --> 01:44:51,365
Why you?

1967
01:44:51,465 --> 01:44:53,079
David!

1968
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:54,330
I don't... Excuse me.

1969
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:55,828
I don't understand

1970
01:44:55,952 --> 01:44:57,075
why you can't show someone else

1971
01:44:57,201 --> 01:44:59,566
how to plant the virus,
someone who is trained...

1972
01:44:59,665 --> 01:45:01,688
No, no.
Something may go wrong.

1973
01:45:01,788 --> 01:45:03,112
I may have to think quickly,

1974
01:45:03,278 --> 01:45:04,351
adjust the signal.

1975
01:45:04,451 --> 01:45:05,774
Who knows?

1976
01:45:05,899 --> 01:45:08,273
Hey, you know how,
like, I'm always trying

1977
01:45:08,439 --> 01:45:10,353
to save the planet?

1978
01:45:13,018 --> 01:45:14,059
Here's my chance.

1979
01:45:17,347 --> 01:45:18,471
Now he gets ambitious.

1980
01:45:19,262 --> 01:45:19,469
It's too tight.

1981
01:45:19,678 --> 01:45:20,968
It's too tight.

1982
01:45:21,093 --> 01:45:23,133
Well, I had to borrow it.

1983
01:45:23,299 --> 01:45:25,880
Let me see. OK. I guess
that's good enough.

1984
01:45:26,005 --> 01:45:28,868
So, how do I look?

1985
01:45:28,968 --> 01:45:31,165
Oh, thank you.
You're a lot of help.

1986
01:45:34,413 --> 01:45:35,537
You're late.

1987
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:37,069
Well, you know me.

1988
01:45:37,169 --> 01:45:39,075
I know. You like
to make a big entrance.

1989
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,574
Let me help you.

1990
01:45:40,699 --> 01:45:41,738
Um, listen...

1991
01:45:41,906 --> 01:45:43,237
before we do this,

1992
01:45:43,404 --> 01:45:44,978
I just want to say I'm sorry.

1993
01:45:45,078 --> 01:45:47,025
Sorry for what, babe?

1994
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:49,481
I should have done this
a long time ago.

1995
01:45:49,647 --> 01:45:51,637
Do you have the ring?

1996
01:45:51,737 --> 01:45:52,970
Uh, yes, sir.

1997
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:55,967
Here. Make yourself useful.

1998
01:45:56,067 --> 01:45:56,974
Ow.

1999
01:45:59,555 --> 01:46:00,462
Witnesses?

2000
01:46:02,717 --> 01:46:04,291
Sorry.
We got hung up.

2001
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:07,337
Well, let's get this show on the road.

2002
01:46:07,462 --> 01:46:08,379
Dearly beloved,

2003
01:46:08,503 --> 01:46:10,992
we're gathered here in the sight of God

2004
01:46:11,091 --> 01:46:13,705
and in the presence of these witnesses

2005
01:46:13,872 --> 01:46:16,196
to join this man and this woman

2006
01:46:16,296 --> 01:46:17,486
in holy matrimony.

2007
01:46:17,586 --> 01:46:19,609
Any person who can show good cause

2008
01:46:19,709 --> 01:46:21,698
why these two should not wed,

2009
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:25,486
please speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

2010
01:46:28,024 --> 01:46:31,854
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,

2011
01:46:32,021 --> 01:46:33,353
to live together with her

2012
01:46:33,519 --> 01:46:34,645
in the holy state of matrimony?

2013
01:46:34,852 --> 01:46:38,015
Will you love her, comfort her,

2014
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,304
honor and keep her
in sickness and in health?

2015
01:46:40,514 --> 01:46:43,759
And, forsaking all others,
keep yourself only for her

2016
01:46:43,884 --> 01:46:46,672
as long as you both shall live?

2017
01:46:46,798 --> 01:46:48,005
I will.

2018
01:46:50,169 --> 01:46:51,502
Whew.

2019
01:47:00,867 --> 01:47:02,454
Good morning.

2020
01:47:06,339 --> 01:47:08,636
They're a little young.

2021
01:47:08,844 --> 01:47:10,181
That they are.

2022
01:47:12,187 --> 01:47:13,933
They look a little nervous.

2023
01:47:14,033 --> 01:47:15,988
I'm gonna need all flight crews

2024
01:47:16,197 --> 01:47:18,411
to report to their
designated areas immediately.

2025
01:47:19,539 --> 01:47:21,418
Major, can I borrow that?

2026
01:47:21,543 --> 01:47:22,421
Sir.

2027
01:47:24,007 --> 01:47:24,843
Good morning.

2028
01:47:27,642 --> 01:47:28,727
Good morning.

2029
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:33,335
In less than an hour, aircraft from here

2030
01:47:33,435 --> 01:47:38,376
will join others from around the world,

2031
01:47:38,586 --> 01:47:41,927
and you will be launching
the largest aerial battle

2032
01:47:42,094 --> 01:47:44,224
in the history of mankind.

2033
01:47:46,062 --> 01:47:48,903
Mankind. That word
should have new meaning

2034
01:47:49,069 --> 01:47:52,410
for all of us today.

2035
01:47:52,578 --> 01:47:53,915
We can't be consumed

2036
01:47:54,082 --> 01:47:57,549
by our petty differences anymore.

2037
01:47:57,717 --> 01:48:00,549
We will be united
in our common interests.

2038
01:48:00,649 --> 01:48:06,530
Perhaps it's fate that today
is the 4th of July,

2039
01:48:06,738 --> 01:48:11,124
and you will once again be
fighting for our freedom...

2040
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,340
not from tyranny, oppression,
or persecution...

2041
01:48:16,889 --> 01:48:18,518
but from annihilation.

2042
01:48:20,021 --> 01:48:22,528
We are fighting for our right to live.

2043
01:48:24,241 --> 01:48:25,644
To exist.

2044
01:48:25,744 --> 01:48:29,630
And should we win the day...

2045
01:48:29,729 --> 01:48:33,118
the Fourth of July will
no longer be known

2046
01:48:33,218 --> 01:48:35,284
as an American holiday...

2047
01:48:35,451 --> 01:48:38,391
but as the day when the world
declared in one voice,

2048
01:48:38,491 --> 01:48:41,846
we will not go quietly into the night!

2049
01:48:42,054 --> 01:48:45,541
We will not vanish without a fight!

2050
01:48:45,749 --> 01:48:47,659
We're going to live on!

2051
01:48:47,866 --> 01:48:50,731
We're going to survive!

2052
01:48:50,856 --> 01:48:55,091
Today we celebrate
our independence day!

2053
01:49:19,839 --> 01:49:20,670
Let's go!

2054
01:49:20,835 --> 01:49:22,663
Mr. President,
right this way, sir.

2055
01:49:22,828 --> 01:49:24,656
We got your gear over here.

2056
01:49:24,822 --> 01:49:26,150
I got a jumpsuit for you,

2057
01:49:26,317 --> 01:49:27,770
and the rest of your gear's
squared away in this duffel.

2058
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,597
You got your choice of helmets.

2059
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:34,197
Mr. President,
I'd sure like to know

2060
01:49:34,297 --> 01:49:35,451
what you're doing.

2061
01:49:35,617 --> 01:49:37,736
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

2062
01:49:39,895 --> 01:49:42,012
I belong in the air.

2063
01:49:48,573 --> 01:49:50,939
OK, sir.
Let's get you airborne.

2064
01:49:51,063 --> 01:49:53,306
Right over here.

2065
01:49:53,514 --> 01:49:56,005
You know,
as soon as I get back,

2066
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:58,622
we're gonna light
those fireworks, right?

2067
01:50:04,808 --> 01:50:05,805
Here.

2068
01:50:07,092 --> 01:50:08,005
Take these.

2069
01:50:10,497 --> 01:50:12,938
Just in case.

2070
01:50:13,038 --> 01:50:14,607
Where's... Where's, um...

2071
01:50:25,611 --> 01:50:27,438
Just in case.

2072
01:50:30,178 --> 01:50:31,715
I'm very proud of you.

2073
01:50:43,424 --> 01:50:45,667
So be careful, OK?

2074
01:50:52,475 --> 01:50:53,473
It's time.

2075
01:50:59,204 --> 01:51:00,324
I love you.

2076
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:02,110
I love you.

2077
01:51:07,424 --> 01:51:08,545
Oh, damn!

2078
01:51:08,712 --> 01:51:10,165
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait.

2079
01:51:10,289 --> 01:51:11,410
We got to find some cigars.

2080
01:51:11,535 --> 01:51:12,946
Here! Here!

2081
01:51:13,113 --> 01:51:13,943
Take these.

2082
01:51:14,109 --> 01:51:15,936
My last two.

2083
01:51:16,102 --> 01:51:18,263
You are a lifesaver.

2084
01:51:18,429 --> 01:51:21,625
Almost put a hex
on the whole damn thing.

2085
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:49,229
Missile launched.

2086
01:51:49,329 --> 01:51:50,890
Oh, crap!

2087
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:53,016
What... What did I hit?

2088
01:51:55,549 --> 01:51:57,874
I picked a hell of a
day to quit drinking.

2089
01:52:13,278 --> 01:52:15,895
This is our victory dance.

2090
01:52:16,061 --> 01:52:18,006
Not until the fat lady sings.

2091
01:52:18,105 --> 01:52:20,712
Oh! Yes. OK.

2092
01:52:20,878 --> 01:52:22,302
This is important.

2093
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:23,868
Mm. Fat lady.

2094
01:52:24,034 --> 01:52:25,071
I gotcha.

2095
01:52:26,193 --> 01:52:28,642
Open launch tunnel.

2096
01:52:46,746 --> 01:52:48,192
Shaky, huh?

2097
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:48,989
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

2098
01:52:49,278 --> 01:52:50,227
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

2099
01:52:50,326 --> 01:52:51,729
Just make sure

2100
01:52:51,853 --> 01:52:52,891
your seat backs and tray tables

2101
01:52:53,015 --> 01:52:54,005
are in their upright
and locked position.

2102
01:52:54,104 --> 01:52:55,424
Yeah... Is it?

2103
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:00,366
Let's rock 'n' roll.

2104
01:53:07,342 --> 01:53:08,421
Oops.

2105
01:53:08,629 --> 01:53:09,658
Oops? What does that mean?

2106
01:53:09,758 --> 01:53:10,788
What do you mean...

2107
01:53:10,996 --> 01:53:11,942
Nah. I... I got it.

2108
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,196
Some jerk didn't put the...

2109
01:53:13,321 --> 01:53:15,140
I know what I mean when I say it.

2110
01:53:15,239 --> 01:53:16,783
What do you mean saying "oops" there?

2111
01:53:16,994 --> 01:53:19,385
What do you say we try
that one again, huh?

2112
01:53:19,554 --> 01:53:20,393
Yes, yes.

2113
01:53:20,561 --> 01:53:22,190
Yes, without the "oops. "

2114
01:53:22,291 --> 01:53:24,834
There's the... thataway.

2115
01:53:31,306 --> 01:53:33,361
I have got to get me one of these!

2116
01:53:42,554 --> 01:53:44,813
No... No. What was that?
Don't do that.

2117
01:53:44,913 --> 01:53:46,155
Just trying to get a
feel for the old girl,

2118
01:53:46,256 --> 01:53:47,170
that's all.

2119
01:53:47,338 --> 01:53:48,933
Oh, no... no, don't.
Leave her alone.

2120
01:53:49,059 --> 01:53:50,571
Look! No hands.

2121
01:53:50,737 --> 01:53:51,527
Steve!

2122
01:53:55,522 --> 01:53:56,940
You're all secured, sir.

2123
01:53:57,041 --> 01:53:58,630
Grey, do you read me?

2124
01:53:58,755 --> 01:54:00,174
Roger, Eagle One.

2125
01:54:00,275 --> 01:54:02,154
Your primary target has shifted course.

2126
01:54:02,279 --> 01:54:03,497
Which way are they headed?

2127
01:54:03,623 --> 01:54:07,148
I think our secret's out.
They're headed straight for us.

2128
01:54:07,316 --> 01:54:09,750
ETA 26 minutes.

2129
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:14,828
Still with me over there?

2130
01:54:14,955 --> 01:54:17,179
What the hell was I thinking?

2131
01:54:28,008 --> 01:54:30,987
I've been waiting
for this my whole life.

2132
01:54:42,781 --> 01:54:43,789
Head straight for it.

2133
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:51,217
What the hell...

2134
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:53,063
Don't touch them!
No, no, don't!

2135
01:54:53,190 --> 01:54:55,029
I was counting on this.

2136
01:54:55,129 --> 01:54:57,044
They are bringing us in.

2137
01:54:57,144 --> 01:55:00,695
When the hell was you gonna tell me?

2138
01:55:00,796 --> 01:55:01,870
Oops.

2139
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:04,808
We're going to have to work

2140
01:55:04,909 --> 01:55:06,327
on our communication.

2141
01:55:20,891 --> 01:55:22,276
We have visual.

2142
01:55:22,402 --> 01:55:25,080
Do not engage until we've confirmed

2143
01:55:25,181 --> 01:55:27,102
the package has been delivered.

2144
01:55:27,271 --> 01:55:28,194
Roger.

2145
01:55:33,776 --> 01:55:35,160
Major, what happens

2146
01:55:35,369 --> 01:55:36,924
if... if that thing gets here...

2147
01:55:37,049 --> 01:55:38,938
before the virus is planted?

2148
01:55:39,063 --> 01:55:40,147
Well, ma'am,

2149
01:55:40,248 --> 01:55:41,994
this facility's buried
deep within the mountain.

2150
01:55:42,095 --> 01:55:43,807
It should provide us some protection.

2151
01:55:43,933 --> 01:55:47,080
Great. What about the people outside?

2152
01:55:54,887 --> 01:55:57,027
Lieutenant Sayle, we got incoming.

2153
01:56:56,919 --> 01:56:58,254
Oh, my God.

2154
01:57:31,643 --> 01:57:32,851
Look at that.

2155
01:57:42,982 --> 01:57:44,649
There must be thousands of them,

2156
01:57:44,773 --> 01:57:45,773
millions of them.

2157
01:57:45,941 --> 01:57:47,608
What the hell are they doing?

2158
01:57:47,733 --> 01:57:50,484
Looks like they're
preparing an invasion.

2159
01:58:18,162 --> 01:58:19,537
Hey, I don't like this.

2160
01:58:19,663 --> 01:58:21,073
This is stupid.
They can see us!

2161
01:58:21,173 --> 01:58:22,123
Oh, no, no, no.

2162
01:58:22,331 --> 01:58:23,291
This thing comes fully loaded.

2163
01:58:23,457 --> 01:58:26,292
AM-FM radio, reclining
bucket seats, and...

2164
01:58:26,458 --> 01:58:28,292
power windows.

2165
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:44,083
Come on, baby.

2166
01:58:44,183 --> 01:58:45,592
Come on, baby.

2167
01:58:47,676 --> 01:58:48,960
We're in.

2168
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:50,135
Oh.

2169
01:58:54,845 --> 01:58:57,221
Oh, do it. Do it.

2170
01:58:57,345 --> 01:58:58,672
Do it.

2171
01:58:58,772 --> 01:58:59,693
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

2172
01:58:59,793 --> 01:59:00,681
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

2173
01:59:00,806 --> 01:59:03,348
Eagle One, the package
is being delivered.

2174
01:59:03,473 --> 01:59:05,474
Stand by to engage.

2175
01:59:06,975 --> 01:59:09,643
Roger. Eagle One.
Check left.

2176
01:59:13,353 --> 01:59:14,228
Hey, listen up.

2177
01:59:14,353 --> 01:59:15,679
We have an emergency situation.

2178
01:59:15,779 --> 01:59:18,013
We need everyone to grab
everything they can.

2179
01:59:18,113 --> 01:59:19,513
Only what you can carry.

2180
01:59:19,613 --> 01:59:21,773
We need to get you inside immediately.

2181
01:59:25,442 --> 01:59:26,484
The virus is in.

2182
01:59:32,819 --> 01:59:35,362
All we can do now is... pray.

2183
01:59:36,696 --> 01:59:37,938
Delivery complete.
Engage.

2184
01:59:38,038 --> 01:59:40,272
Delivery complete.
It's a go. It's a go.

2185
01:59:40,372 --> 01:59:42,616
Eagle One. Fox Three.

2186
01:59:46,867 --> 01:59:48,368
Gentlemen, this is it.

2187
01:59:51,036 --> 01:59:53,537
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

2188
02:00:00,623 --> 02:00:02,082
God.

2189
02:00:06,792 --> 02:00:08,585
Virus ineffective.
Disengage.

2190
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:10,628
Get your people out of there.

2191
02:00:10,794 --> 02:00:13,754
Disengage.
Rear flank, follow suit.

2192
02:00:13,878 --> 02:00:15,254
Hold on, Command.

2193
02:00:16,879 --> 02:00:18,706
I want another shot at it.

2194
02:00:18,806 --> 02:00:20,207
Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.

2195
02:00:20,307 --> 02:00:22,841
Eagle One.

2196
02:00:22,966 --> 02:00:23,842
Fox Three.

2197
02:00:37,222 --> 02:00:38,931
Direct hit!

2198
02:00:39,139 --> 02:00:40,882
Squadron leaders, fire
at will! Fire at will!

2199
02:00:40,982 --> 02:00:42,557
Fire at will!

2200
02:00:42,683 --> 02:00:45,559
We're going in.
Squadron leaders, take point.

2201
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:48,019
Eagle Six at seven.

2202
02:00:48,185 --> 02:00:49,011
Eagle Five at three.

2203
02:00:49,110 --> 02:00:50,020
Eagle One...

2204
02:00:50,186 --> 02:00:51,012
Fox Two!

2205
02:00:51,112 --> 02:00:52,448
Eagle 20. Fox Two!

2206
02:01:01,654 --> 02:01:02,495
Evasive maneuvers!

2207
02:01:02,665 --> 02:01:05,473
Squadron leaders,
evasive maneuvers!

2208
02:01:05,574 --> 02:01:06,826
Prepare to engage!

2209
02:01:12,208 --> 02:01:15,445
All right, Mr. President, here we go!

2210
02:01:15,571 --> 02:01:17,421
All right, baby, I've got you.

2211
02:01:19,691 --> 02:01:21,205
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

2212
02:01:24,021 --> 02:01:26,165
OK, job's done.
Let's go home.

2213
02:01:26,292 --> 02:01:28,057
Gladly.

2214
02:01:32,178 --> 02:01:33,094
What's up?

2215
02:01:33,195 --> 02:01:34,910
We're stuck.

2216
02:01:35,036 --> 02:01:35,961
What?

2217
02:01:36,087 --> 02:01:37,263
It's not responding. It's stuck.

2218
02:01:37,433 --> 02:01:38,526
Then try again.

2219
02:01:53,745 --> 02:01:55,385
Come on! Come on!

2220
02:02:28,471 --> 02:02:30,069
Steve! Steve!

2221
02:02:35,996 --> 02:02:37,552
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

2222
02:02:37,677 --> 02:02:38,637
It's not me.

2223
02:02:38,737 --> 02:02:39,906
They're overriding the system.

2224
02:02:40,032 --> 02:02:40,949
Oh... shit!

2225
02:02:41,049 --> 02:02:42,008
Um...

2226
02:02:42,218 --> 02:02:43,184
hide.

2227
02:02:49,534 --> 02:02:50,837
Everybody hold someone's hand.

2228
02:02:50,963 --> 02:02:51,846
Hold hands!

2229
02:02:53,023 --> 02:02:54,032
Come on in.

2230
02:02:57,731 --> 02:02:58,909
I'm not Jewish.

2231
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:00,632
Nobody's perfect.

2232
02:03:03,028 --> 02:03:05,312
Are you scared?

2233
02:03:05,412 --> 02:03:06,350
Me, too.

2234
02:03:08,873 --> 02:03:10,126
Eagle Seven. Fox Two.

2235
02:03:10,227 --> 02:03:11,774
Eagle Three. Fox Two.

2236
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,510
We're running out of missiles, sir.

2237
02:03:20,610 --> 02:03:22,444
We're just not causing enough damage.

2238
02:03:22,545 --> 02:03:24,091
It's settling directly over us.

2239
02:03:33,761 --> 02:03:36,115
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon!

2240
02:03:36,241 --> 02:03:39,983
Then let's take it out
before it takes us out.

2241
02:03:44,313 --> 02:03:46,121
Target at 12 o'clock.

2242
02:03:48,434 --> 02:03:49,736
My God, they're everywhere.

2243
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:52,932
Bandits on our tail!
They're locked on!

2244
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:53,941
I see 'em!

2245
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:59,659
All right, squadron leaders,
I want weapons check.

2246
02:04:01,172 --> 02:04:02,518
You're outta time!

2247
02:04:02,643 --> 02:04:03,778
You've gotta disable it now!

2248
02:04:07,394 --> 02:04:10,421
I'm in range.
Locking on.

2249
02:04:10,548 --> 02:04:13,028
I've got tone.
Eagle One. Fox Two!

2250
02:04:22,991 --> 02:04:24,580
That is a negative impact.

2251
02:04:24,681 --> 02:04:26,810
That is an N. I.
Negative impact.

2252
02:04:26,911 --> 02:04:29,887
I'm out of missiles.
Eagle Two!

2253
02:04:30,013 --> 02:04:30,896
I'm on it.

2254
02:04:33,334 --> 02:04:35,535
Oh! Oh! Jesus!

2255
02:04:37,984 --> 02:04:39,347
Sir, all missiles have been fired.

2256
02:04:39,447 --> 02:04:40,343
You're out of time!

2257
02:04:40,443 --> 02:04:41,597
Get your ass out of there!

2258
02:04:41,721 --> 02:04:42,842
We're not done yet!

2259
02:04:42,966 --> 02:04:44,171
Get as far away as you can!

2260
02:04:44,295 --> 02:04:46,247
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?

2261
02:04:46,372 --> 02:04:48,407
Sorry I'm late, Mr. President!

2262
02:04:52,186 --> 02:04:53,556
Kinda got hung up back there.

2263
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:55,467
Pilot, you armed?

2264
02:04:55,591 --> 02:04:56,961
Armed and ready, sir.

2265
02:04:57,086 --> 02:04:58,497
I'm packin'.

2266
02:04:59,909 --> 02:05:00,823
Who is that guy?

2267
02:05:00,989 --> 02:05:02,649
Put him on speaker.

2268
02:05:02,816 --> 02:05:03,646
Pilot, identify yourself.

2269
02:05:03,770 --> 02:05:06,262
It's me. Russell Casse, sir.

2270
02:05:06,471 --> 02:05:09,086
I told you I wouldn't let you down.

2271
02:05:09,293 --> 02:05:11,080
Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds,

2272
02:05:11,286 --> 02:05:12,338
will ya?

2273
02:05:12,438 --> 02:05:14,651
OK. Echo-9er, Echo-7.

2274
02:05:14,775 --> 02:05:15,647
Take flanking positions.

2275
02:05:15,771 --> 02:05:17,307
I want you to look after this guy.

2276
02:05:17,432 --> 02:05:20,870
All right, boys, let's
give Mr. Casse some cover.

2277
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:24,823
Gentlemen...
let's plow the road!

2278
02:05:32,132 --> 02:05:34,083
We'll draw 'em off,
and it'll be all yours!

2279
02:05:34,208 --> 02:05:37,198
Look out! Comin' through!

2280
02:05:38,942 --> 02:05:40,229
I've got tone.

2281
02:05:42,513 --> 02:05:44,879
Eagle 20. Fox Two.

2282
02:05:52,521 --> 02:05:53,848
Eagle 20. Fox Two.

2283
02:05:57,628 --> 02:05:58,624
It's jammed!

2284
02:05:58,749 --> 02:06:01,324
It won't fire.

2285
02:06:04,603 --> 02:06:05,933
Damn it!

2286
02:06:16,688 --> 02:06:18,183
Do me a favor.

2287
02:06:20,591 --> 02:06:22,659
Tell my children...

2288
02:06:22,758 --> 02:06:25,324
I love them very much.

2289
02:06:27,484 --> 02:06:29,768
All right, you alien assholes!

2290
02:06:29,893 --> 02:06:33,423
In the words of my generation...

2291
02:06:33,547 --> 02:06:37,483
up yours!

2292
02:06:37,582 --> 02:06:39,272
Dad!
What's he doing?

2293
02:06:39,372 --> 02:06:40,771
Come on, baby!

2294
02:06:40,870 --> 02:06:42,527
Come on, baby! Come on!

2295
02:06:46,106 --> 02:06:47,397
Good luck, buddy.

2296
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:58,216
Hello, boys!

2297
02:06:58,341 --> 02:07:02,502
I'm back!

2298
02:07:21,105 --> 02:07:22,575
He did it!

2299
02:07:22,675 --> 02:07:25,017
The son of a bitch did it!

2300
02:07:28,056 --> 02:07:29,097
All right!

2301
02:07:52,028 --> 02:07:55,557
What your father did was very brave.

2302
02:07:55,657 --> 02:07:57,478
You should be proud of him.

2303
02:07:57,605 --> 02:07:59,059
I am.

2304
02:08:17,539 --> 02:08:20,035
Now we know how
to take them out, General.

2305
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:21,575
Spread the word.

2306
02:08:24,363 --> 02:08:25,736
Get on the wire

2307
02:08:25,862 --> 02:08:28,018
to every squadron around the world.

2308
02:08:28,118 --> 02:08:31,980
Tell 'em how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

2309
02:08:45,088 --> 02:08:46,545
What do you think?

2310
02:08:48,585 --> 02:08:50,000
Checkmate.

2311
02:09:16,095 --> 02:09:17,425
Wow, it's funny.
I always thought

2312
02:09:17,592 --> 02:09:18,924
that things like these would kill me.

2313
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:24,833
Thank you.

2314
02:09:33,199 --> 02:09:35,072
It's been a pleasure.

2315
02:09:35,197 --> 02:09:36,861
Steve, you, too.

2316
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:43,020
There's only one thing left to do.

2317
02:09:43,228 --> 02:09:43,977
There's only one thing left to do.

2318
02:09:48,722 --> 02:09:50,421
Ready?

2319
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,010
Yes, sir.

2320
02:09:58,627 --> 02:09:59,534
Hey! All right!

2321
02:09:59,634 --> 02:10:00,750
Hey, hey!

2322
02:10:00,874 --> 02:10:01,914
Look at us!

2323
02:10:02,122 --> 02:10:03,454
Take a look at the Earthlings.

2324
02:10:03,621 --> 02:10:05,452
Good-bye!

2325
02:10:05,618 --> 02:10:06,568
Y'all take care, all right?

2326
02:10:06,667 --> 02:10:08,573
Nothin' but love for ya.

2327
02:10:08,698 --> 02:10:10,820
Do you think they have any clue

2328
02:10:10,946 --> 02:10:12,818
what's about to happen to 'em?

2329
02:10:12,943 --> 02:10:14,150
Oh, not a chance in hell.

2330
02:10:14,275 --> 02:10:15,149
Good night.

2331
02:10:22,431 --> 02:10:23,308
Peace!

2332
02:10:37,082 --> 02:10:37,959
We're loose.

2333
02:10:38,127 --> 02:10:38,961
Can you get us out of here

2334
02:10:39,086 --> 02:10:39,963
in 30 seconds?

2335
02:10:40,172 --> 02:10:41,249
I ain't heard no fat lady!

2336
02:10:41,349 --> 02:10:42,250
Forget the fat lady.

2337
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:43,253
You're obsessed with the fat lady.

2338
02:10:43,353 --> 02:10:44,429
Drive us outta here.

2339
02:10:51,568 --> 02:10:53,363
Ohh! They're chasing us.

2340
02:10:53,488 --> 02:10:54,365
Oh, really? You think?

2341
02:11:02,963 --> 02:11:04,082
Oh, that was a hit.
I took a hit.

2342
02:11:04,182 --> 02:11:05,300
We're not hit!
We're not hit!

2343
02:11:05,425 --> 02:11:06,636
Stop side-seat driving.

2344
02:11:10,602 --> 02:11:11,513
Left, left.
Tunnel, tunnel.

2345
02:11:11,613 --> 02:11:12,898
Exit, exit. Left!

2346
02:11:13,023 --> 02:11:14,192
Where the hell do you think I'm going?

2347
02:11:14,317 --> 02:11:15,736
Ok, we-we-we're, uh...

2348
02:11:33,602 --> 02:11:34,688
Uh-oh, they're closing up on us.

2349
02:11:34,812 --> 02:11:36,141
Is that closing?

2350
02:11:36,241 --> 02:11:37,358
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

2351
02:11:37,483 --> 02:11:39,687
Must go faster.
Must go faster.

2352
02:11:39,787 --> 02:11:41,524
Go, go, go, go!

2353
02:11:53,554 --> 02:11:55,717
Elvis has left the building!

2354
02:11:55,817 --> 02:11:57,219
Thank you very much.

2355
02:11:57,319 --> 02:11:59,941
Ohh! I love you, man.

2356
02:13:30,437 --> 02:13:32,684
They're going down
all over the world, Tom.

2357
02:13:32,784 --> 02:13:34,019
We got 'em beat.

2358
02:13:34,119 --> 02:13:36,440
How about our two delivery boys?

2359
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:37,742
Any word from them?

2360
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:41,950
We lost contact

2361
02:13:42,050 --> 02:13:44,839
with Captain Hiller and Levinson

2362
02:13:44,963 --> 02:13:46,341
nearly 20 minutes ago.

2363
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:50,591
Hold it!

2364
02:13:50,691 --> 02:13:51,592
Hold on, sir.

2365
02:13:51,692 --> 02:13:53,353
I've got something on radar.

2366
02:14:41,232 --> 02:14:42,958
Sorry, sir.

2367
02:14:43,084 --> 02:14:43,968
Good job.

2368
02:14:44,094 --> 02:14:45,223
Thank you.

2369
02:14:45,324 --> 02:14:46,233
Well done, Captain.

2370
02:14:46,334 --> 02:14:47,589
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

2371
02:14:55,588 --> 02:14:56,557
David...

2372
02:14:59,251 --> 02:15:00,513
not bad.

2373
02:15:03,629 --> 02:15:05,544
Thank you, Mr. President.

2374
02:15:06,836 --> 02:15:09,376
Not too bad at all.

2375
02:15:10,710 --> 02:15:12,578
Oh, so this is healthy?

2376
02:15:12,678 --> 02:15:15,044
Oh, I could get used to it.

2377
02:15:33,333 --> 02:15:35,574
Happy 4th of July, Daddy.

2378
02:15:35,674 --> 02:15:37,748
Same to you, munchkin.

2379
02:15:39,289 --> 02:15:41,914
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

2380
02:15:42,039 --> 02:15:43,580
Yeah.
